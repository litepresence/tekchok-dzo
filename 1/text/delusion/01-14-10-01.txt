[19975-19987] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
MISREADING:
The "threefold continuous yoga" (rgyun gyi rnal 'byor gsum) and its nine deviations (gol sa) are interpreted as precise curriculum where deviations are actual errors to be vigilantly avoided.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumerative structure triggers anxiety-formation. "Deviation" suggests wrong-path. The practitioner assumes listed errors are real dangers.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-already-complete nature is obscured by deviation-paranoia. The practitioner believes they must navigate around nine specific errors. Recognition is replaced by error-avoidance.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Deviation-monitoring consumes attention. "Am I falling into formless absorption?" becomes constant worry. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply non-recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 470-472's deviation elaboration. Each deviation becomes new fear. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is paralyzed by deviation-avoidance.

---

[19988-20003] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
MISREADING:
The description of deviations is interpreted as establishing "deviation-free practice" as advanced attainment accessible only to superior practitioners.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical sophistication suggests esoteric content. Complex deviation-catalog signals "higher teaching." The practitioner wants advanced status.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-despite-deviation nature is lost. The practitioner believes deviation-free practice is required. Elitism emerges around "avoiding all nine deviations."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Deviation-free practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Those showing deviation-signs are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply labels for non-recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Deviation-mastery becomes capacity-indicator. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having no deviations."

---

[20004-20018] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
MISREADING:
The deviation-examples—falling into formless absorptions, form realms, solid matter—are interpreted as literal geographical locations one can actually "fall into."

WHY IT ARISES:
Spatial language triggers literal mapping. "Fall into" suggests destination. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate cosmography.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-error nature of deviations is lost. The practitioner believes in literal wrong-realms. Navigation-anxiety replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Realm-maps" proliferate. Teachers who detail cosmographies gain authority. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply mistaken views is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Spatial metaphors there are also literalized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed "deviation-geography."

---

[20019-20034] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
MISREADING:
The deviation section is seen as "danger warnings" to rush through so one can reach "positive content" (practitioner types, colophon). Fear-content creates dismissive reading.

WHY IT ARISES:
Fear-triggering content creates resistance. "Deviations" suggest negativity. The practitioner wants "inspirational" material.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The protective function of deviation-teaching is missed. The practitioner has "covered" deviations without understanding them. Information substitutes for discernment.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward aversion-pattern. Difficult teachings are avoided. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached as "positive conclusion" without deviation-awareness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 470-472's deviation-elaboration is not absorbed. Arriving at PAGE 479 without deviation-understanding, the practitioner misses the colophon's protective function.

---

[20035-20050] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
MISREADING:
The "gol sa" (deviation) term itself is interpreted as establishing dzogchen's unique possession of precise error-diagnosis, superior to other traditions.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical terminology signals expertise. "Deviation" suggests diagnostic precision. The practitioner wants superior diagnostic tools.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The universal-availability of error-recognition is lost. Gol sa becomes dzogchen-exclusive concept. Elitism emerges around "having deviation-map."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Gol sa practitioner" becomes diagnostician-identity. Other traditions are deemed "deviation-ignorant." The authentic recognition that all traditions recognize error is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Gol sa distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed "gol sa superiority."

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The deviation-obsession on this page carries to PAGE 470-472's deviation-elaboration. By PAGE 473-475's practitioner-types, deviations become "type-discriminators." The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with deviation-fear.

[20051-20058] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
MISREADING:
The detailed enumeration of nine deviations—three for view, three for conduct, three for meditation—is interpreted as comprehensive error-catalog requiring vigilance against all nine.

WHY IT ARISES:
Enumerative completeness triggers anxiety. "Nine" suggests exhaustive coverage. The practitioner assumes listed errors cover all possible mistakes.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Recognition is suffocated by deviation-monitoring. The practitioner constantly checks: "Am I in formless absorption? Acting crazy? Meditating on emptiness?" Fear replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Deviation-paralysis sets in. Every practice-movement is suspected. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply non-recognition is lost in obsessive error-checking.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 471-472's deviation-consequences. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is paralyzed by fear of the nine deviations.

---

[20059-20067] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
MISREADING:
The distinction between "those with deviations" and "those who have cut deviations" is interpreted as establishing two classes of practitioners with different essences.

WHY IT ARISES:
Typological thinking triggers essentialism. "With/without" suggests categorical difference. The practitioner wants "without deviation" status.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-to-all-despite-deviation nature is lost. Deviation-free status becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes some are inherently deviation-prone.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Deviation-free" becomes exclusive identity. Those showing deviation-signs are deemed inferior capacity. The authentic recognition that deviation is simply momentary non-recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Deviation-status becomes capacity-marker. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having cut deviations."

---

[20068-20075] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
MISREADING:
The deviation-consequences—falling into god realms, becoming demons, falling into formless absorptions—are interpreted as literal fates to be avoided.

WHY IT ARISES:
Consequential language triggers literal fear. "Fall into" suggests destination. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate real dangers.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-error nature of consequences is lost. The practitioner believes in literal bad-rebirths from wrong-meditation. Soteriological fear replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
Fear-based practice emerges. Teachers promising "safety from deviations" gain authority. The authentic recognition that consequences are simply continued non-recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Consequence-metaphors are literalized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner practices from fear.

---

[20076-20084] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
MISREADING:
The deviation section's length triggers "get through this" mentality. The practitioner wants to "finish deviations" and reach "practitioner types" and colophon.

WHY IT ARISES:
Dense fear-content creates resistance. Length suggests obstacle. The practitioner wants "positive conclusion."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The protective integration of deviation-teaching is missed. The practitioner has "read" deviations without absorbing them. Information substitutes for discernment.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward dismissive pattern. Difficult sections are glossed over. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached without deviation-awareness.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 471-472's deviation-cuts are not understood. Arriving at PAGE 479 without discernment, the practitioner misses the colophon's grounding function.

---

[20085-20093] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
MISREADING:
The "cutting deviations" (gol sa bcad) terminology is interpreted as establishing dzogchen's unique possession of deviation-elimination technology.

WHY IT ARISES:
Technical terminology signals expertise. "Cut" suggests surgical precision. The practitioner wants superior cutting-tools.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The universal-availability of recognition is lost. Gol sa bcad becomes dzogchen-exclusive method. Elitism emerges around "having cut."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Cutter" becomes practitioner-identity. Other traditions are deemed "uncut." The authentic recognition that all paths cut deviation through recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. "Cutting" metaphors are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "cut" conceptually without recognition.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The deviation-fear on this page carries to PAGE 471-472's deviation-cut elaboration. By PAGE 473-475's practitioner-types, fear determines type-identification. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with residual anxiety.

[20094-20103] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
MISREADING:
The instruction that "cutting deviations" requires "settling recognition with its radiance at the sense-gates" is interpreted as technique to be executed precisely.

WHY IT ARISES:
Instructional language triggers technique-assumption. "Settling" suggests action. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate procedures.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The non-effort nature of recognition is obscured by technique-anxiety. The practitioner worries about "correct settling." Recognition is replaced by position-achievement.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Settling techniques" proliferate. Teachers who specify precise methods gain authority. The authentic recognition that recognition is not a position is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] continues through PAGE 472's deviation-details. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by technique-accumulation.

---

[20104-20113] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
MISREADING:
The distinction between "those with deviations" (sem lam byed) and "those who see directly" (rig pa mngon sum) is interpreted as establishing ontological practitioner-types.

WHY IT ARISES:
Typological language triggers essentialism. "See directly" suggests superior capacity. The practitioner wants superior type.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The recognition-available-to-all nature is lost. Direct-seeing becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes some are inherently "direct-seeers."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Direct-seer" becomes exclusive identity. Mind-path practitioners are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that direct-seeing is simply present recognition is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Direct-seeing status becomes capacity-marker. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "being direct-seer."

---

[20114-20123] [EPISTEMIC ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
MISREADING:
The description of "not going to extremes of dullness or excitation" and "not being moved by conceptual investigation" is interpreted as precise phenomenological standards to maintain.

WHY IT ARISES:
Phenomenological language triggers experience-matching. "Not" suggests prohibition. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate requirements.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
Natural recognition is suffocated by state-monitoring. The practitioner constantly checks: "Am I dull? Excited? Conceptual?" Self-policing replaces recognition.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
State-anxiety consumes practice. Teachers promising "correct state" validation gain authority. The authentic recognition that states don't matter is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. State-distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is trapped in state-optimization.

---

[20124-20133] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
MISREADING:
The approach to volume's end triggers "just finish" mentality. The practitioner wants to "complete deviations" and reach colophon.

WHY IT ARISES:
Proximity to end triggers momentum. Dense technical content creates fatigue. The practitioner wants "closure."

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The integration-function of deviation-teaching is missed. The practitioner has "finished" deviations without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern. Final sections are skimmed. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "just ending."

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 472's deviation-cuts are not contextualized. Arriving at PAGE 479 without integration, the practitioner misses dedication's importance.

---

[20134-20144] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
MISREADING:
The "spontaneous liberation" (thal byung du grol) and "arising-there liberated" (shar thog tu grol) descriptions are interpreted as special attainment-marks.

WHY IT ARISES:
Liberation-language triggers achievement-association. "Spontaneous" suggests advanced. The practitioner wants spontaneous-liberation status.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The always-already nature of liberation is lost. Spontaneous liberation becomes elite experience. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition is insufficient.

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Spontaneously liberated" becomes exclusive identity. Gradual practitioners are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that liberation is not an attainment is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Liberation-metaphors are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "achieved" spontaneous liberation conceptually.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The deviation-resolution on this page carries to PAGE 472's elaboration. By PAGE 473-475's practitioner-types, resolution-status determines type. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with "resolved" complacency.

[20145-20146] [ONTOLOGICAL ERROR] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
MISREADING:
The distinction between ground-expanse-awareness (gzhi'i dbyings rig), path-expanse-awareness (lam gyi dbyings rig), and fruition-expanse-awareness ('bras bu'i dbyings rig) is interpreted as establishing three ontological types of awareness or three classes of practitioners.

WHY IT ARISES:
Tripartite structure triggers typological thinking. "Ground, path, fruition" suggests developmental stages. The practitioner wants "fruition" awareness.

PRIMARY CONSEQUENCE:
The single-nature of all awareness is fragmented into hierarchical types. The practitioner believes fruition-awareness is superior. Elitism emerges around "which awareness one has."

SECONDARY CONSEQUENCES:
"Fruition-awareness practitioner" becomes advanced identity. Ground-awareness practitioners are deemed beginners. The authentic recognition that all three are aspects of single awareness is missed.

CASCADE EFFECTS:
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 474-475's capacity distinctions. Awareness-type becomes capacity-marker. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having fruition-awareness."
