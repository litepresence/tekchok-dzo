[6414] First, if there is a cause,
[6415] If there is a cause, compounded things are impermanent and thus disintegrate—therefore merit and demerit in action are without inherent existence.
[6416] Without reversal, the aggregates of sentient beings—immeasurable as they are—could not arise; this is unreasonable.
[6417] If mind were manifold, self and other conceptions could not arise simultaneously in the same being; this is unreasonable.
[6418] Through mutual intermingling,
[6419] Self-arising,
[6420] Non-death,
[6421] Absence of suffering,
[6422] If one possessed retinues, enjoyments, and such, there would be joy;
[6423] If others were defeated and such, there would be common conceptions; this arising is unreasonable.
[6424] If [mind] were different,
[6425] Since there are many beings,
[6426] Some would experience self-defeat, joy in harmony with others, and such; this would be reasonable.
[6427] If mind were one only, would one death mean all die?
[6428] Would one birth mean all are born?
[6429] Thus, through numerous approaches of analysis regarding one and many in one's own mind, having investigated and searched,
[6430] Finding nothing is the realization by the faculty of wisdom that dharmatā is pure from the beginning.
[6431] Since there is no cause in mind and reversal is impossible, there is endless confidence in the accumulation of karma.
[6432] If there were a cause in mind, results would necessarily arise;
[6433] If the result is saṃsāra, it is impure and liberation is impossible.
[6434] If it has passed, saṃsāra arising is unreasonable.
[6435] If it is both,
[6436] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa would appear different, and mind too would become different.
[6437] If it is different,
[6438] Just as body and mind are different, so too would desires gathered into one nature become many different things.
[6439] Knowing that they gather into one nature.
[6440] One may object: "If there is no cause in mind, these minds are unreasonable."
[6441] These do not arise from a cause of mind, for they are not mind.
[6442] If they are not mind-originated, there is no non-realization of mind merely abiding as such.
[6443] These are neither exhaustion of
[6444] Birth,
[6445] Death,
[6446] Abiding, and such, nor are they increase.
[6447] Thus the scriptures declare:
[6448] <tantra>"In this deluded confabulation of ignorance there is neither exhaustion nor increase."</tantra>
[6449] And again:
[6450] <tantra>"The nature of the realm of sentient beings is also without end."</tantra>
[6451] Thus knowing that without cause there is no increase in mind;
[6452] Knowing no increase, there is no birth;
[6453] Knowing no birth, there is no death;
[6454] Knowing this, one knows there is no evil in action.
[6455] <tantra>"This dharma is free from both existence and non-existence."</tantra>
[6456] Thus knowing that from the beginning there has never been any self,
[6457] <tantra>"Since pure from the start, how could sentient beings be born?"</tantra>
[6458] Furthermore, there is no condition for mind;
[6459] If there were, just as appearances appear as manifold, so too would mind become manifold through conditions of color and such;
[6460] Mind having become different, recollection and thought could not be gathered into one.
[6461] If there were conditions in mind, it would become certain destruction;
[6462] Thus the karma and result of mind would be nonexistent—absurd!
[6463] If mind were destroyed but its karma remained,
[6464] This would be greatly contradictory,
[6465] Like saying the body, its color, faculties—all good and bad—remain though the body is destroyed.
[6466] Therefore, merely abiding like illusion, it is clear.
[6467] One may ask: Without conditions, from what do these manifold present recollections and thoughts arise?
[6468] These present recollections and thoughts do not arise from conditions;
[6469] Like the joy and holding-as-real upon finding a jewel in last night's dream,
[6470] Upon waking, there is nothing at all;
[6471] So too, even if one clings to these present recollections and thoughts as real, afterward there is nothing.
[6472] They are accomplished merely through appearing as the seeming truth of the occasion.
[6473] For example, just as various clouds in the sky suddenly gather and without going anywhere suddenly dissolve,
[6474] Though those clouds are nonexistent in the sky, they appear within it;
[6475] Though conditions and causes are nonexistent in mind, they appear as appearing—
[6476] At that time, causes and conditions are nonexistent, ascertained as nonexistent through analysis of one, many, and the three times.
[6477] <tantra>"From neither a destroyed nor non-destroyed seed does a sprout arise; all dharmas you have taught arise like illusions."</tantra>
[6478] <tantra>"The fifth condition does not exist."</tantra>
[6479] <tantra>"The path supreme, peaceful, without cause and condition."</tantra>
[6480] Therefore, if mind exists,
[6481] Does it exist as a material thing or
[6482] As immaterial?
[6483] It does not exist as material, for if it did, it would be visible to the sense organs, yet the valid cognition of direct perception does not perceive what should be visible.
[6484] If it exists as immaterial, how is it known?
[6485] One may say: "Movement is known."
[6486] That movement is analyzed as contact of moments, directions, and
[6487] The three times—past, future, and present—and is not established.
[6488] If prior movement meets present movement, the prior recollection of the meeting moment must exist now;
[6489] If it exists, it contradicts being prior;
[6490] That meeting moment of the prior and present having ceased is absurd;
[6491] If they do not meet, present recollections would have no cause, and movement would be unreasonable—absurd!
[6492] Is movement one or different?
[6493] If one, the variety of movement is impossible;
[6494] If different, since there is one mover, it is impossible.
[6495] Thus mind is not established as existent;
[6496] Realized as rootless, like space,
[6497] Without birth and birthplace, there is no ground of reversal.
[6498] Without it, through recognition between prior and later recollections, they dissolve there;
[6499] Thus one realizes mind is without ground, and having realized this, one gains confidence without ground of reversal.
[6500] Knowing this, the three realms are decisively resolved as the Great Nameless.
[6501] Knowing this dharma, there is no benefit or harm in virtuous or non-virtuous action—awareness at ease.
[6502] Furthermore, through recognition between prior and later appearances and awareness,
[6503] One realizes mind is not established as cause or characteristic;
[6504] Knowing this, one gains confidence without reference point in mind-as-emptiness;
[6505] Having gained this confidence, one is decisively resolved that mind has not arisen from causes and conditions;
[6506] Knowing this dharma, there is no benefit or harm from adventitious conceptual thoughts—awareness at ease.
[6507] Furthermore, awareness at ease!
[6508] Through recognition between prior and later mind,
[6509] One realizes mind is without root;
[6510] Knowing this, one gains confidence that the various proliferations in the wheel of mind-as-one are not different;
[6511] Having gained this confidence, one is decisively resolved that fabricated dharmas will not achieve awakening;
[6512] Being decisively resolved, since there is no partial non-realization in the meaning of mindlessness, awareness is at ease.
[6513] Furthermore, through recognition between prior and later dharmatā,
[6514] One realizes mind is without birth;
[6515] Knowing this, one gains confidence that habitual tendencies will not harm the all-ground body;
[6516] Having gained this confidence, one is decisively resolved that mind cannot arise;
[6517] Being decisively resolved, mind is like a small house—there is no reversal or basis of reversal—awareness at ease.
[6518] Thus, having comprehended the measure of the four times of mind's existence,
[6519] Without buddhas, buddhas are not even mere names;
[6520] The mind that holds hope for results is reversed;
[6521] Through this reversal, there are no dharmas of deliberate effort on the path.
[6522] Thus, for the dharma of nonexistence, since there is nothing at all, designations of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are merely names—having found nothing in the meaning, this is called "the measure of liberation."
[6523] Therefore, since there is nothing at all in mind-as-nonexistence,
[6524] Since there is no reason in mind, it is not an object of sight;
[6525] Thus the recognition of fourfold nonexistence,
[6526] Knowing the sixteen dharmic subjects,
[6527] Is the destruction of mind's small house—
[6528] Like a child's sandcastle being built and destroyed.
[6529] This is like iron destroying iron, or
[6530] Impermanence destroying impermanence, like a magician destroying the magician's city;
[6531] Fabrication destroying impermanence is like heaping corpse upon corpse;
[6532] Impermanence destroying fabrication is like present awareness destroying prior ignorance.
[6533] Thus, through mind destroying mind, both cease without trace, like writing on water;
[6534] Searching for nonexistence yet finding nothing is like a poor person searching for the wish-fulfilling jewel that is not in their house, having no place to find it;
[6535] For mind-as-nonexistence, there is no place to destroy,
[6536] Like there being no place to grasp when waves collapse upon water.
[6537] Therefore, without knowing the meaning of mindlessness,
[6538] Seeking view, meditation, and conduct in mind
[6539] Will never find the teachings of the Great Bliss of Liberation;
[6540] Like grasping at water when the boat sinks,
[6541] Taking existence as a support in mindlessness itself is deception and binding.
[6542] <tantra>"Holding appearance as dharmakāya is obscuration for me; holding whatever appears as mind is obscuration for me; desiring other than self-arising is obscuration for me."</tantra>
[6543] One may ask: Then is "dissolving mind" not becoming nonexistent from existent?
[6544] Dissolving, if analyzed as before, is not established;
[6545] If not analyzed, it is merely the dissolution of adventitious recollective thoughts;
[6546] Mind has never become nonexistent from being existent in its own continuum;
[6547] There is no cause of dissolution nor condition of dissolution anywhere.
[6548] One may object: Then there is no need to destroy mind's small house, for there is nothing to destroy.
[6549] For mind is nonexistent from the beginning;
[6550] Merely realizing the nature of nonexistence,
[6551] Not that there exists a ground or thing of mind's small house;
[6552] Since the source of recollection becomes dharmatā,
[6553] Having made nonexistence understood,
[6554] Conventionally this is called "destroying the small house";
[6555] Destroying existence—there is nothing at all.
[6556] Therefore, through placing whatever appearing object-point appears as the seeming result of convention upon that appearance,
[6557] Without grasping at material appearance, the result of non-duality of object and mind;
[6558] Through placing upon the ground of whatever awareness arises,
[6559] Mind's small house self-dissolves—the result of awareness-awakening of movement;
[6560] Thus, having realized the ground of dissolution of non-dual wisdom of material-awareness, the result of nonexistence.
[6561] Thus the time of the three results too is recognition at the time of dissolution in the four key points of recognition.
[6562] Know the sixteen dharmas of nonexistence as before.
[6563] This is the severance of mind's nonexistence, self-awakened, from the Great Secret Certainty Heart Essence instructions.
[6564] Knowing movement as adventitiously liberated from the beginning;
[6565] Other instructions say mind is ultimately nonexistent, conventionally existent,
[6566] Making view and meditation the path of mind—these two are merely contradictory in claiming self-liberation, self-arising, self-settling.
[6567] They are not ultimately contradictory,
[6568] Here making nonexistent, there holding existence as nonexistence.
[6569] Union too:
[6570] There, holding existence as two related to one, desiring such union;
[6571] Here, since nonexistent from the beginning, there is nothing to unite;
[6572] In the nature of nonexistence, without partiality of difference, non-dual union is called "union."
[6573] This key point is supreme among all vehicles, most crucial and essential;
[6574] From this, not holding appearance as mind, and
[6575] Not experiencing mind as existent is taught as the great ground-awakening.
[6576] Relying upon this, recognizing appearance as mind and
[6577] Recognizing mind-as-emptiness is to be known as the Heart Essence intention.
[6578] If any instruction appears thus, know it as merely provisional, not ultimate—decisively resolved.
[6579] Third, external appearances arising as the mirror of awareness, the six collections as the great equality, vast and pervasive:
[6580] External various appearances,
[6581] Internal adventitious recollective thoughts,
[6582] The six sense-faculties with their objects—all
[6583] Are merely clear appearance of nonexistence,
[6584] Without anything existing internally or externally, like the hair-faults of one with ophthalmia, like
[6585] Illusion,
[6586] Mirage,
[6587] Optical illusion—
[6588] Appearing to mind yet
[6589] At the time of appearing, from that very time, transcending the extremes of existence and nonexistence, one should know;
[6590] However designated from the side of appearance, it does not contradict;
[6591] Let it be existent,
[6592] Let it be nonexistent,
[6593] Let it be existent,
[6594] Let it be nonexistent,
[6595] Let it appear,
[6596] Let it be empty,
[6597] Let it be deluded,
[6598] Let it be liberated,
[6599] Let it be good,
[6600] Let it be bad,
[6601] Let it be mind,
[6602] Let it be other,
[6603] However designated,
[6604] From the side of emptiness, as designated, it is empty from the start;
[6605] Designation is mind;
[6606] Mind is nonexistent;
[6607] Without a designator for the nonexistent, like the actions of a dream and the actions of illusion.
[6608] Appearance and arising,
[6609] Virtue and non-virtue and such—these very things are adventitious;
[6610] Their nature, groundless, self-dissolves;
[6611] If realized as existing in the dynamic energy of awareness's self-resonance, intention-dharmatā does not depend on anything;
[6612] The great appearance of all phenomenal saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dharmas self-arising and self-appearing as the clear appearance of nonexistence in the nature of awareness:
[6613] Like the appearances of the four elements abiding in the nature of space,
[6614] Like various dreams not moving from the nature of sleep and
[6615] Awareness of sleep;
[6616] Though all self-appear on the face of awareness,
[6617] Awareness does not see deluded appearance as saṃsāra,
[6618] Does not see pure appearance as beyond,
[6619] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa do not see awareness;
[6620] All unmoving in the nature of the groundless great equality,
[6621] Unestablished in essence, transcending seen and seer,
[6622] Arising from the nature of awareness, merely designated as the self-resonance or display of awareness of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa;
[6623] Great liberation from existence-nonexistence extremes,
[6624] Designation does not contradict,
[6625] Not established in meaning,
[6626] Merely clear appearance of nonexistence—the arising of all saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dharmas.
[6627] <tantra>"In the mind of stainless purity, appearance free from object-conditions is called the intention of great self-purity—I, Samantabhadra, teach this."</tantra>
[6628] <tantra>"The thing that is nothing at all, not falling into any direction; the thing that deludes as anything, merely appearing as common appearance; yet its meaning does not arise; appearing like the ornament of dharmadhātu."</tantra>
[6629] <tantra>"The great emptiness wisdom: from nothing at all, anything can delude."</tantra>
[6630] <tantra>"That is me, that is beings; that is mind, that is mind-originated; that is manifold, that is singular; saṃsāra and nirvāṇa am I myself; maṇḍalas and such are gradual entry; that is dharma, appearing as dharma; that is abiding, that is moving; that is sitting, sleeping, and walking; that is life, that is indeed cutting; the three worlds are born from that; in short, all dharmas however appearing arise from that."</tantra>
[6631] <tantra>"The great elements of earth, water, fire, wind, and space arise from that."</tantra>
[6632] <tantra>"Thus in dharmatā so abiding, delusion is nonexistent from the start; in dharmakāya like space, adventitious sentient beings are obscured by clouds; even dharmatā not deluded in abiding appears to mind as the manner of delusion."</tantra>
[6633] <tantra>"The five afflictions of sentient beings do not exist in meaning; like clouds in space, they are merely adventitious with conditions; knowing those clouds arise from space itself and dissolve into space is called the nature of indivisible oneness."</tantra>
[6634] <tantra>"Thus knowing self-arising, self-pacified affliction-defilements, how could sentient beings be bound?"</tantra>
[6635] As appearance-manner is unestablished,
[6636] Though appearing as grasping, it is not established anywhere;
[6637] The great non-referential is also taught:
[6638] <tantra>"This mind without abiding, wondrous! No destination, wondrous! To the six entering minds without support, wondrous! To the all-ground gathering all without placement, wondrous! To the circling, deluding ignorance without power of change, wondrous! To all object-fixating afflictions without root-ground, wondrous! To subtle and coarse defilements without accumulation, wondrous! To the coarse elemental forms without reference, wondrous! To the life-force supported by person without time-allotment, wondrous! To the six collections' object-appearances without permanence, wondrous! To the person's arising thoughts and feelings without exhaustion, wondrous!"</tantra>
[6639] <tantra>"This rootless dharmatā, wondrous in not seeking, naturally settled! To the going and coming awareness without limit, wondrous! To the great primordial wisdom without antidote, wondrous!"</tantra>
[6640] <tantra>"As in the sky without the slightest cloud, suddenly a cloud-mandala appears; arising and ceasing, investigate from where that cloud-mandala first arose; know all dharmas are thus."</tantra>
[6641] <tantra>"As a person dwelling in an echo-cavern, from singing, speaking, laughing, and crying, depending on conditions echoes arise, yet that sound never departs from the sound; know all dharmas are thus."</tantra>
[6642] Second, pointing out the wisdom of exhaustion beyond mind, the great natural direct wisdom without change—threefold:
[6643] Pointing out awareness, the natural direct exhaustion beyond mind;
[6644] Sustaining the intention of self-clear abiding as the great vast openness;
[6645] Establishing the wheel of three-key dharmatā as the great space-equal vast expanse.
[6646] First:
[6647] The self-abiding awareness self-clear, naturally settled,
[6648] Not projecting outward,
[6649] Not gathering inward,
[6650] Not contemplating in-between—looking at self-face,
[6651] External-internal without distinction,
[6652] Self-clear natural directness,
[6653] Dharmakāya unmoved by view-meditation,
[6654] Wisdom unmoved by conceptual thought,
[6655] Intention unfabricated by projection-gathering,
[6656] Clear without thought,
[6657] Abiding without grasping,
[6658] Vast without losing spaciousness,
[6659] Equal without partiality,
[6660] Great self-resonance without entering agent,
[6661] The great intention of primordial self-abiding,
[6662] Clear and pure like the ocean,
[6663] Pristine and pure like sun and moon,
[6664] Vast and spacious like space,
[6665] Stable and abiding like the king of mountains.
[6666] Though all sentient beings have never been separated from such meaning even for an instant, primordially existing in themselves,
[6667] Not knowing their own face, they are confounded by saṃsāra's bad conceptual proliferation;
[6668] Now, through the lama's instructions having recognized their own face, whether arising, abiding, or stirring, in any time of natural settled equipoise,
[6669] Without distraction, sustain the nature.
[6670] <tantra>"Ah! Lion, path without traverse! Lion without deliberate action! Upon the white snows without abandonment-settlement, three powers of dispelling darkness perfected! I, the thoughtless clear lion, upon the pure snows of primordial purity, three powers of dispelling elements perfected!"</tantra>
[6671] <tantra>"In the mind of no eternalism-nihilism, appearance free from good-bad is called the intention free from acceptance-rejection—I, Samantabhadra, teach this. In the mind without accepting-rejecting, directionless self-liberated appearance is called the intention of great vast openness—I, Samantabhadra, teach this. In the mind without torpor-excitement, the meditation of great equanimity is called the intention of six collections' natural flow—I, Samantabhadra, teach this. In the mind without fear-hope, appearance free from expectation-doubt is called the intention of primordial settled confidence—I, Samantabhadra, teach this."</tantra>
[6672] <tantra>"This nature of reality free from grasping-clinging, the dharma of buddhas' non-dual intention; individually empty, characteristics beyond word-path; effortless dharmatā self-pure in its own place; entering the object of bodhi-samādhi dharmatā; pure and impure conventionally nonexistent as dharmas; the meaning of primordial abiding transcending one and two; in one's own body-nature, dissolving into a single bindu; timeless realization, samādhi undistracted clarity; without extreme-center, dharmatā nameless; unchanging, pervading all directly; not fabricated, spontaneously accomplished in arising-place."</tantra>
[6673] Second, sustaining in that nature—threefold:
[6674] Sustaining view-meditation as great object-transcendence;
[6675] Sustaining samādhi as great self-abiding;
[6676] Sustaining intention as great beyond-mind.
[6677] First:
[6678] In that recognition-nature, without entering mind's grasping-deliberation and deliberate meditation antidotes, awareness vast and wide, primordially settled, height and depth, spaciousness without partiality, self-dissolved self-settled.
[6679] <tantra>"Vast! Dharmatā completely pure! Great! View is wondrous! Appearance! Self-appearance is the maṇḍala itself! Object and non-object completely pure! External and internal without distinction, clearly appearing! Empty and non-empty beyond words!"</tantra>
[6680] <tantra>"Wherever is the first ground, there the last goes; now abiding in that meaning."</tantra>
[6681] <tantra>"In the grasping-concept-free sky, in the consciousness-free sky, awareness-mind unmoved is the supreme samādhi without distraction—the single way of the buddhas."</tantra>
[6682] Second, three aspects:
[6683] Natural settled equipoise:
[6684] Without fabrication-effort of grasping at the six collections' object-appearances, external-internal without distinction, naturally dissolved, spaciously settled,
[6685] Even when going to sleep, abiding in that nature, dreams arise as clear light.
[6686] Great thunder-descent:
[6687] Loosing the three doors naturally, whatever arises meeting immediately, self-dissolved, spaciously gone—knowing this nature.
[6688] Appearance spreading-increasing:
[6689] Body in vajra posture, eyes gazing at space between eyebrows, cutting mind's projection-gathering, knowing the nature of awareness self-dissolved half-awake, binding the five winds into space,
[6690] Self-appearance pure clear light—externally smoke, mirage, rainbow light and such; internally dharmatā empty-clear pure appearance arising thus.
[6691] <tantra>"Train thus in the three samādhis: Natural settled equipoise samādhi: not blocking the sense doors, not engaging in bodily conduct, not abandoning sleep either; mind not cut off elsewhere; in short, body and speech in their own place, not losing outgoing mind-parts; for the six sense objects too, unmoved mind of clear knowing conduct; in the great non-conceptual self-appearance, clarity without thought, experientially arisen."</tantra>
[6692] <tantra>"In the great thunder-descent samādhi: body like ordinary; speech free from spoken words; mind not tightly bound—self-arising, self-pure without distraction. Appearance spreading-increasing samādhi: body, object, and awareness taking the measure of self-appearance purity."</tantra>
[6693] Third, sustaining intention as beyond-mind—fourfold:
[6694] View of mountain-settled equipoise;
[6695] Intention of ocean-settled equipoise;
[6696] Instruction of awareness-settled equipoise;
[6697] Method of appearance-settled equipoise.
