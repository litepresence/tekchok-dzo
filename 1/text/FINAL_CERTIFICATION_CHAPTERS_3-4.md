## LAYER-BY-LAYER CERTIFICATION

### COMMENTARY LAYER ✅

**Files:** 23 (all sections)
**Voice:** Anonymous hermit/yogi (corrected from imperative)
**Quality:** Exemplar grade

**Before correction:** Some files had "you must", "Look!", "You think"
**After correction:** "Some hermit...", "This old practitioner...", "This yogi..."

**Sample (01-03-01-01):**
```
[1582-1622]
Some hermit in a yak hair tent once tried to pronounce that Sanskrit title 
and gave up halfway through—too many syllables for frozen lungs at high 
altitude. But the meaning? That is simpler. This old practitioner watched 
his own hands grow stiff with cold one winter, and understood: earth element 
holding form together. Watched his frozen butter lamp melt, and saw: water 
element flowing...
```

**Metaphors present:**
- Yak hair tent
- Frozen butter lamp
- Hands growing stiff with cold
- Breath clouding the air
- Space inside the tent

### SCHOLAR LAYER ✅

**Files:** 23 (all sections)
**Format:** Four Pillars (<structure>, <philology>, <context>, <concept>)
**Quality:** Exemplar grade

**Sample (01-03-01-01):**
```
[1582-1586] <structure>
# Five Elements and Dhatus Framework
**Analysis:** The text opens the third major section analyzing the bases 
(*rten*) of the person. The five elements (*'byung ba lnga*) serve as the 
foundation for both external world (*phyi yul*) and internal mind (*nang 
sems*). Lines 1582-1586 establish the framework...
```

### EPISTEMIC LAYER ✅

**Files:** 23 (all sections)
**Format:** View-stratification with kebab-case XML tags
**Quality:** Exemplar grade

**Sample (01-03-01-01):**
```
[1653-1670] <skandhas-and-dhatus>
<The eighteen dhatus framework classifies all phenomena into six sense 
faculties, six objects, and six consciousnesses. This is Abhidharma 
classificatory schema, not ontological claim. The rigpa-side view sees these 
as display of awareness (*rig pa'i rtsal*), not independently existing 
entities. Risk: <reification-error> treating dhatus as substantial building 
blocks rather than analytic categories.>
```

### DELUSION LAYER ✅

**Files:** 23 (all sections)
**Format:** **Misreading:**, **Why it arises:**, **Primary consequence:** headers
**Quality:** Exemplar grade

**Sample (01-03-01-01):**
```
[1582-1590] <ontological-error> <element-reification>
**Misreading:**
The five elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space) interpreted as actual 
physical substances or energies existing independently of mind.

**Why it arises:**
The text uses concrete element-language (solid, moist, hot, moving, spacious) 
that naturally triggers materialist associations. Modern scientific 
framework identifies elements as fundamental constituents of matter.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen view reduced to elemental yoga or physicalist metaphysics. The 
recognition that elements are mind's display (*sems kyi rtsal*) is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <materialism-error>, <element-worship>, <physical-yoga>, and 
<practice-objectification>.
```

### COGNITIVE LAYER ✅

**Files:** 23 (all sections)
**Format:** [start-end] single paragraph blocks
**Quality:** Exemplar grade

**Sample (01-03-01-01):**
```
[1582-1622]
Structural opening of Chapter 3 on bases and aggregates. Five elements 
established as foundational framework for both external container-world 
and internal contained-beings. Key distinction between outer elements 
(phyi) and inner elements (nang). The elements serve dual function: 
cosmological (world-formation) and psychological (body-formation). 
Translation must preserve the ambiguity of 'byung ba as both elements and 
event-arising. Risk of reifying elements as substances vs. processes. 
Preserve the genitive relationships: sa'i khams (of-earth element), not 
simply "earth element."
```
