The dispute: If permanent and impermanent exist together—if impermanent appears but permanent does not, then anything goes. Similarly, samsara would be liberated without recognition, and liberated ones would revert to confusion.

Second dispute: Rabbit horns and son of barren woman—if these impossible things could create samsara and nirvana, endless faults follow.

Response: The Buddha taught that these are projections of not recognizing one's own face—establishing all as existing through delusion. Because faults of non-recognition are endless, these positions fail.

The sixth position: Because essence appears everywhere, variegated appearances arise through not recognizing. This must be examined: Is multiplicity external appearance, internal consciousness, or aggregation?

If external: ground would appear manifold externally. If internal: ground would be momentary, conceptual, afflicted. If aggregation: ground would be dualistic. All lead to contradiction.

The recognition that liberates is always immediate.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.
