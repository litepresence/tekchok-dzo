From the *Rin po che'i sgron ma 'bar ba* tantra: "Far-reaching water lamp's essence gathers both appearances; because seeing-holder grasping aspect not ceased, through holding both aspects. Recognition is immediate.

"

Do you see? These lamps are your eyes, practitioner! Not something to achieve. Turn back from grasping at what you see, and the lamp is already blazing! Emaho!

The water lamp is the essence of awareness appearing as clarity. The clarity of light-essence is the power-support of the agent seeing both pure appearance and deluded appearance. This is the key: both appearances—samsara and nirvana—are gathered in the same awareness. The seeing-holder has not ceased grasping—so we see both pure and impure appearances. When we recognize the nature, both are held in the same awareness.

Teach purpose emanate various, speak like. Self-appearance vast not-enter binding noose, appearance attachment not-exist inward samadhi bliss moisten water. Water essence gather rely water, form-appearance power-consciousness clear, light-appearance increase upward lamp. Space-awareness appearance produce base not mother, essence power form view support base mother.

The teaching emanates various forms. The self-appearance is vast, not entering binding noose. Where there is no attachment to appearance, the mind becomes moistened with inward samadhi bliss—this is called water. The water essence gathers, relying on water. The form-appearance becomes the power of consciousness, clear. The light-appearance increases upward—this is called lamp. The space-awareness produces the appearance of the base—not the mother. The essence-power form supports the view—this is the mother.

Burning-lamp definitive word like-this, distance far continuum hold, form appear hold, color gather, awareness body far see agent. Samsara thought distance outward throw distance, not-realize nirvana throw distance. Samsara appearance form desire-object five bind noose, power appearance appearance memory thought self hold noose distance hold. Sky cloud free awareness selfless body appear, vast not-enter hold noose. Water appearance attachment self-place return, all attachment mind not-exist, appearance self-place set self-grasp free water. Lamp appearance above increase, awareness pristine-awareness clear lamp, element coarse self-know experience cease not power self-door clear lamp. Awareness outer space set, inner space pure.

The outer and inner space are one space. Your own face is the space.

The definition: the form-reflection of light-luminous clarity and deluded appearance, the appearance of earth and stone, abides holding at a far distance. Through casting samsara's deluded appearance with deluded-thought far, it is far. If not realized, nirvana also casts far, thus far. When seeing self-appearance, through binding impure, to snare. If not realized, through attachment to deluded-appearance, through binding self-awareness, also snare.

Similar with rope: if examine rope also, like hair single one one bind benefit cannot do. If not examined, like collection bind agent established. If examine deluded-appearance and deluded-hold two, although ground-emptiness essence-empty. If not examined, like confusion self-awareness binding-agent appear. From bound appear time, bound not exist and. From liberated appear time, through binding-agent self-characterized not exist, liberation not exist. From magical-illusion, through anyone also not-bound, bound not exist. Bind-agent object exist not exist. Bound not exist completely untie not exist. Primordially spontaneously-complete Buddha-dharma.

Three words. Four lamps. One light. Recognition dawns.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Now I will explain further the teaching. The water lamp is the clarity of awareness appearing as light. This clarity is not something created—it is the very nature of mind. When awareness is not obscured by concepts, it shines as clarity. This clarity appears as the lights we see in meditation—the points, the lines, the colors. These are not achievements—they are the natural display of awareness.

The tantra speaks of far-casting: the appearance seems far because we grasp at it. The rope appears as snake because we do not examine. When we examine, we see the rope and the snake are not two. The rope is empty of snake-nature, yet appears as snake. Similarly, all appearances are empty of inherent existence, yet appear vividly. This is the Middle Way: appearances are neither truly existent nor non-existent.

The four lamps: water lamp, emptiness lamp, space lamp, wisdom lamp. These correspond to the four aspects of awareness. The water lamp is the clarity of awareness. The emptiness lamp is the openness of awareness. The space lamp is the expanse of awareness. The wisdom lamp is the knowing of awareness. These four are not separate—they are aspects of the one awareness.

The channels: the navel channel produces the burning-lamp. The body enters the mother womb. The body essence gathers at the navel, the great channel knot, the center triangle. Father and mother, cause and condition, produce the eye fruit. The father's portion is white, the mother's portion is black—they mix.

The channels pulsate, branch upward, move into the skull cavity, enter the three branches, pierce the right and left eyes, the middle brahma-aperture. The awareness thought-free body: vajra necklace, dot stack, five or nine arises.

The nine dots: these are the nine doorways of awareness. They are not nine—they are one. The one is not one—it is the nature of awareness, beyond one and many. Your own face is the dot—the point of awareness that knows everything.

The seven doors: the eye, the essence center straight, arises the door eye two, power object arises making, channel all appears. The eight examples: object-appearance holds like a hook, hook holds making, appears the nose holds, samsara nirvana nose holds. The nine measures: three element gathering distant-noose measure, object-appearance expands gathering, pristine-awareness measures the necklace sees, essence gathers form-appearance distinguishes.

This old wanderer has traversed these teachings. The water lamp is your own awareness, clear and luminous. The lamps are not outside—they are within. The channels are the pathways of awareness. The dots are the moments of awareness. Recognize this, and the entire mandala reveals itself. The body becomes the palace, the channels become the deities, the lights become the wisdoms.

Thus, practitioner, do not seek the lamps elsewhere. They are within you. The clarity you see in meditation is your own awareness. The lights that appear are the lights of wisdom. Recognize them as your own display, and the path completes itself.

Now I will explain further the water lamp in practice. The water lamp is the clarity of awareness—it appears as light, as points, as colors. This clarity is not something you create—it arises naturally when the mind is still. When you rest in naked awareness, without grasping at thoughts or objects, the clarity shines forth. This is the water lamp.

The practice is simple: rest in awareness. Let thoughts arise and dissolve naturally. Do not follow them, do not reject them. Let the mind be like space—open, vast, unobstructed. Within this space, clarity arises. The clarity is not different from space—they are aspects of the same awareness.

The four lamps correspond to four aspects of practice. The water lamp is the clarity of awareness. The emptiness lamp is the openness of awareness. The space lamp is the expanse of awareness. The wisdom lamp is the knowing quality of awareness. These four are not separate—they arise together, shine together, dissolve together in the single sphere of rigpa.

The channels within the body are the pathways of this clarity. The navel channel produces the burning lamp—the heat of awareness. The central channel is the pathway of the main winds. The right and left channels are the pathways of the subsidiary winds. When the winds enter the central channel, clarity arises.

The channels are not mere tubes—they are the pathways of awareness. The ancient masters mapped these channels through direct observation. They discovered that awareness has structure—it flows through specific pathways, settles in specific centers, manifests in specific forms. This mapping is the basis of the inner yoga practices.

The nine dots are the nine doorways of awareness. These are not physical—they are the points where awareness interacts with objects. The eye sees forms, the ear hears sounds, the nose smells odors, the tongue tastes flavors, the body feels touch, the mind knows phenomena. These are the six doors. The seventh is the door of mental events. The eighth is the door of aggregates. The ninth is the door of dharmata.

But these nine are not nine—they are one. The one awareness that knows through all the doors. The one awareness that is aware of itself. The one awareness that is always present, always knowing, always clear. Your own face is this awareness—this is what the text means by "the dot."

The seven doors: the eye door, the ear door, the nose door, the tongue door, the body door, the mind door, and the door of mental events. These are the gateways through which awareness experiences. Each door has its object: form, sound, smell, taste, touch, phenomena. The awareness that knows through these doors is one—it is your own rigpa.

The practice of Dzogchen is to rest in this awareness. Do not create anything, do not suppress anything. Let the mind rest in its natural state. The clarity will arise naturally. The lights will appear naturally. The recognition will happen naturally. This is the water lamp—already present, always present, never created.

This old wanderer has sat in meditation and seen these lights. I have watched the points arise, the colors shine, the forms manifest. I have felt the heat of the burning lamp, the clarity of the water lamp, the expanse of the space lamp, the knowing of the wisdom lamp. These are not hallucinations—they are the natural display of awareness.

What I tell you is from my own experience: rest in awareness. Let the lights arise. Do not grasp at them, do not reject them. They are appearances in awareness, empty of inherent existence. Rest in that awareness—the awareness that knows the lights. That awareness is your own nature. Recognize it, and the path is complete.
