[5646-5652]
Two heels pressed together—method and wisdom releasing their essence. Soles pressing earth, wind's holding and releasing empties itself, wisdom's heat descending through the body. This is not gymnastics; it is the architecture of awakening, using form to unlock what is beyond form.

[5653-5665]
Second, rest-wisdom key point: when thoughts spread and bliss has not yet arisen, do thus. Knees pressed to stomach, hunched sitting—spreading wind of karma reverses. Reversed, outer forms appear variously while inner mind abides in stillness. Soles pressing earth, life-holding karma wind reverses. Body heat arises without; non-arising Dharmata experience arises within.

[5666-5680]
These crucial points are: body key point channels, channel key point winds, wind key point mind. Three nested secrets, three dependencies. The body position opens the channels; open channels direct the winds; directed winds settle the mind. Not one causing the next, but three aspects of one unfolding.

[5681-5700]
Sambhogakaya posture explanation: called "great elephant" from power and vehicle great aspect. Body key point raises exceptional wisdom. Lie on the side like a lion, three realms suppressed. Knees to stomach joins confusion and wisdom as base. Big toes extended outward creates movement, harming karma's wind. Hand's knuckles pressed to earth supports Dharmakaya's direct appearance.

[5701-5720]
Rest-wisdom in Sambhogakaya: chin pressed suppresses three gates' grasping existence. Four limbs earth-placed, big toes inward pressed, thoughts' karma wind reverses. Reversed, outer delusion appearances cease; inner body-mind heat arises. Palm centers earth-pressed, moving karma wind reverses. Outer thigle and thigle-parts appear; inner day-night-free experience arises.

[5721-5740]
Dharmakaya posture: called "lion's three powers complete"—fearless toward any. Body key point dispels three realms' fears. Like a lion, complete in method, wisdom, and power. Body crouched like a dog brings expanse and awareness together. Soles pressing earth stops various thoughts. Finger joints bent, feet inward placed—karma and affliction's movements empty.

[5741-5760]
Rest-wisdom Dharmakaya: soles earth-placed, knees slightly outward, crouched like a dog—pervading karma wind reverses. Reversed, outer pure wisdom vision appears; inner affliction stream cuts. Palm centers inward placed stops grasping wind. Stopped, outer wisdom vision seen; inner grasping subject thought stream ceases.

[5761-5780]
Thus the three kayas' postures: Dharmakaya's pressing completes Buddha's knowledge in this very awareness. Sambhogakaya's pressing reveals three Buddha fields in this very awareness. Nirmanakaya's pressing accomplishes beings' benefit without obstruction in this very awareness. Three perspectives on one recognition.

[5781-5800]
This old fool tried every posture—lotus, lion, elephant, dog. Each brought something, missed something. Finally he understood: the posture does not create the recognition; it supports what is already present. Like a chair supports the body, posture supports the view. Without the view, posture is exercise. With the view, posture is liberation.

[5801-5850]
Three unmoving gazes for appearance-making: door itself unmoving. Nirmanakaya gaze—wisdom compassion's appearance enjoyed. Eye's relaxation supported, samadhi separation impossible. Mind slightly lowered holds view free of emptiness concept. These are not techniques to master but natural expressions of recognition.

[5851-5900]
See. The body is not obstacle to awakening but its vehicle. These positions are not forced contortions but natural expressions of the mind's own state. When mind is clear, body finds its own wisdom posture. When mind is confused, these postures help redirect the winds that scatter attention.

[5901-5950]
Therefore. The crucial points of body, channel, and wind are taught not to create dependency but to exhaust it. Use these methods until they are seen through. Then even lying in the gutter is Dharmakaya posture, even stumbling drunk is lion's walk. Methods are raft, not destination.

[5951-6000]
Between the systematic precision of posture instructions and the vast freedom they reveal, we find the middle way of practice. Not loose, not rigid. Not forced, not lazy. The body held in wisdom posture while the mind rests in natural flow. Channel open, wind gentle, mind clear.

[6001-6050]
Mountain hermit sat like a dog in his cave for twelve years. When asked why, he said: "The posture taught me what words could not. My body became the teaching, my breath the commentary. Now I cannot separate practice from life—they are one continuous gesture."

[6051-6100]
Final instruction: do not make these postures into another achievement. Do not collect them like badges. Find the one or two that resonate, practice deeply, then forget them. The lion who knows he is lion has already fallen from pride. The yogi who knows they practice has already missed the point.

[6101-6150]
Emaho! The wonder of body as path, posture as teaching, movement as meditation. What need to seek elsewhere? This very body, in any position, is the field of enlightenment. Recognize this, and every step is lion's stride, every rest is Dharmakaya's ease. The Vajra Essence reveals itself through form, leading beyond form to formless recognition.

[6151-6200]
COMPREHENSIVE EXPANSION - DEEPENING THE POSTURE TEACHINGS:

The Weaver's Centered Seat:
The loom requires stable posture. Leaning left, the pattern skews. Leaning right,
the threads tangle. Centered, the weaving flows. The three kayas' postures are
like this—the Dharmakaya dog posture centers awareness. The Sambhogakaya lion
posture balances channels. The Nirmanakaya pressing releases knots. Each
supports the weaving of recognition.

[6201-6250]
The Hot Spring's Natural Posture:
Water finds its level, follows the terrain, rests in natural hollows. The body
in posture is like this—not forced into position but finding natural alignment.
The heels pressing earth find the body's root. The knees to stomach find the
center. The chin pressed finds the channel opening. Natural, not forced.

[6251-6300]
The Mani Wall's Stable Base:
Each stone rests on the one below. No stone floats. Each posture rests on the
body's structure. The Dharmakaya posture rests on soles pressing. The
Sambhogakaya rests on side-lying stability. The Nirmanakaya rests on upright
spine. Stable base, stable mind.

[6301-6350]
The Cave's Supported Stillness:
The cave wall supports the meditator. The posture supports the mind. Without
the cave, the meditator falls. Without the posture, the mind wanders. The three
kayas' postures are caves of support—containing awareness, protecting from
distraction, allowing depth.

[6351-6400]
The Juniper Smoke's Rising Posture:
Straight, natural, rising without effort. The spine in posture is like this—not
forced straight but naturally aligned. The winds rise through central channel
like smoke through still air. No pushing. No pulling. Natural rising.

[6401-6450]
The Migration's Paused Posture:
Birds rest on branches, wings folded, stillness before flight. The posture is
this rest—folded legs, folded wings of attention, stillness before recognition
flies. The three kayas are three branches—different supports, same stillness.

[6451-6500]
The Animal Tracks' Impressed Posture:
The deer leaves hoof print, the bird leaves claw mark, the bear leaves pad
impression. Each body makes its mark. The three kayas' postures are like
this—each body position impresses awareness differently on the ground of
experience.

[6501-6550]
The Root System's Anchored Posture:
Roots reach down, anchor, stabilize. The body in posture reaches down through
soles, anchors through sit bones, stabilizes through spine. The Dharmakaya dog
posture roots deeply. The Sambhogakaya lion posture spreads widely. The
Nirmanakaya upright posture reaches highly.

[6551-6600]
The Dzo's Patient Posture:
Steady, unmoving, carrying the load. The posture carries the mind. Not shifting,
not adjusting, not complaining. Just steady presence. Twelve years like this,
and recognition dawns. The posture teaches patience. The patience teaches
recognition.

[6601-6650]
The Celestial Burial's Released Posture:
Ultimate release—body offered, form dissolved. The posture approaches this.
Each position releases tension, releases holding, releases grasping. The heels
pressing release downward energy. The chin pressing releases upward energy.
The center finds center.

[6651-6700]
LONGCHENPA'S VAST SYNTHESIS:
The three kayas' postures are not merely physical positions. They are the
embodiment of the three kayas themselves. When you sit in Dharmakaya posture,
you are Dharmakaya. When you lie in Sambhogakaya posture, you are
Sambhogakaya. When you press in Nirmanakaya posture, you are Nirmanakaya.

The body is not obstacle to awakening. It is the vehicle of awakening. These
postures are not gymnastics. They are the architecture of liberation. Form
unlocking formlessness. Structure revealing nature.

[6701-6800]
THE SYSTEMATIZER'S PRECISE ARCHITECTURE:
Dharmakaya posture: foundation, root, ground
- Soles pressing earth: root establishment
- Dog-like crouch: humility of ground
- Fingers bent: cutting elaboration

Sambhogakaya posture: expansion, display, enjoyment
- Side-lying: receptivity to display
- Chin pressed: channel opening
- Four limbs placed: stability in enjoyment

Nirmanakaya posture: expression, activity, benefit
- Upright pressing: engagement with world
- Heels together: method-wisdom union
- Forward gaze: compassionate activity

[6801-6900]
THE INTEGRATOR'S SPACIOUS UNITY:
No conflict between the three postures. No hierarchy. No progression from one
to the next. All three are simultaneously available. In the morning,
Nirmanakaya pressing. In the afternoon, Sambhogakaya rest. In the evening,
Dharmakaya abiding. Or the reverse. Or all three in one day. Or one posture
for twelve years. The expanse accommodates all.

[6901-7000]
GARAB DORJE'S STARK POINTING:
Enough postures! Enough positions! Enough contortions! The recognition you
seek in posture is already present! Three words. Sit. See. Rest. Sit in any
position. See your nature. Rest in recognition. The posture doesn't matter.
The seeing matters.

[7001-7100]
PATRUL'S EARTHY LAUGHTER:
This old fool tried them all! Lotus until knees screamed. Lion until hip
complained. Dog until back ached. Elephant until neck cramped. Finally I sat
any way I could and recognized. The posture that works is the posture you can
maintain. Everything else is pride.

[7101-7200]
THE SINGING YOGI'S DAILY POSTURE:
While cooking—Dharmakaya crouch at the stove.
While eating—Sambhogakaya reclining at meal.
While walking—Nirmanakaya pressing through world.
Every activity is posture. Every posture is practice.

[7201-7300]
THE ESSENCE HOLDER'S SPACIOUS REST:
Beyond all postures, beyond all positions, there is natural posture—the body
finding its own wisdom alignment without deliberation. This is the ultimate
posture. Not Dharmakaya, not Sambhogakaya, not Nirmanakaya. Just natural
resting. But reach this through the three postures first. They are the path
to postureless posture.

[7301-7400]
THE WANDERING GURU'S RADICAL SIMPLICITY:
The dog doesn't think "I am practicing Dharmakaya posture." The lion doesn't
think "I am in Sambhogakaya position." They simply are. Be like this. Don't
label. Don't categorize. Just be what is natural. The recognition will come.

[7401-7500]
THE VISIONARY DEVOTEE'S LONGING:
How I long to master these postures! How I pray for the flexibility to sit lotus,
the strength to hold lion, the humility to crouch like dog! But even as I pray,
I recognize—the longing is the posture. The prayer is the practice. The devotee
is the posture itself.

[7501-7600]
THE LION-FACED DAKINI'S FIERCE COMPASSION:
Why three postures? Why not one? Why not none? The multiplication is for minds
that need structure. Cut through all three! Sit any way you can! Recognition
doesn't care about your posture! Cut through the obsession with form! See what
is formless!

[7601-7700]
THE SKY-DANCER'S PLAYFUL WISDOM:
Three postures, three dances, three gestures. All lead to the same stillness.
Dance them all or dance none. The stillness remains. The recognition remains.
Play with postures or don't play. The play is optional. The recognition is
essential.

[7701-7800]
THE CONSORT'S INTIMATE INSTRUCTION:
Between you and the posture, let there be intimacy, not struggle. Like lovers
who find comfortable positions naturally. You are not fighting the posture. The
posture is not fighting you. Together you create the conditions for recognition.

[7801-7900]
THE MOUNTAIN HERMIT'S CAVE WISDOM:
Twelve years I sat like a dog. Not because the dog posture was superior. Because
it was what my body needed. The posture taught me what no teacher could. The
body became the teacher. The breath became the commentary. Find your posture.
Let it teach you.

[7901-8000]
THE ECHO'S RESPONSIVE TEACHING:
The posture holds you like the mountain holds the echo. Stable, unmoving,
supporting. Your awareness resonates within the posture. The posture returns
the sound of your practice. Together they create the conditions for liberation.

[8001-8100]
COMPREHENSIVE PRACTICAL APPLICATION:

The three kayas' postures are not mere physical exercises. They are
embodiments of the three kayas themselves. When you understand this, the
postures become alive with meaning.

In Dharmakaya posture, you are the ground of all. Soles pressing earth, you
connect with the primordial purity that underlies all phenomena. The dog-like
crouch expresses humility—the recognition that you are not special, not
superior, not apart from the ground.

In Sambhogakaya posture, you are the enjoyment body. Side-lying, you receive
the display of phenomena as the self-radiance of awareness. The chin pressing
opens the central channel so the winds of wisdom can flow. You enjoy the
appearance without grasping.

In Nirmanakaya posture, you are the activity body. Upright, pressing, engaged.
You act in the world with method and wisdom united. The heels pressed together
symbolize the union of means and wisdom. The forward gaze expresses
compassionate activity.

[8101-8200]
ULTIMATE RESTING PLACE:

Beyond all three postures, there is natural posture—the body finding its own
wisdom alignment without deliberation. This is not sloppy sitting. It is perfect
posture without trying. The body knows. The body remembers. The body finds
its way home.

But don't jump to this. Don't imagine you can bypass the three postures.
They are necessary training. They teach the body what natural alignment feels
like. They create the conditions for postureless posture.

Rest in this understanding. Practice the three postures diligently. Then let
them go. Let the body find its natural wisdom. Let recognition dawn.

[8201-End]
The commentary on the three kayas' postures is now complete. The Dharmakaya
dog posture, the Sambhogakaya lion posture, and the Nirmanakaya pressing have
all been explained, deepened, and integrated.

May all who practice these postures find recognition. May the body become the
path. May form lead to formlessness. May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle
benefit all beings.

This old vagabond has nothing more to say about postures. The teaching is
given. The pointing is made. What remains is your practice. What remains is
your recognition. What remains is your liberation.

Rest in Dharmakaya posture. Rest in Sambhogakaya posture. Rest in
Nirmanakaya posture. Or rest in postureless posture. All lead to the same
recognition. All complete the same path.

Om ah hum. The completion. The perfection. The natural liberation.

[8300-8600]
