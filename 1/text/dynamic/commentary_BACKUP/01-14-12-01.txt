See directly: Consequently. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

This hermit realized: This wanderer. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

Second, dimension one—rigpa's self-place liberated, like water drawing, basis primordially pure. Non-awareness, like water to fire, becomes confusion's condition. Thus: rigpa and non-awareness, example of water's manner, dependent on conditions.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[20230-20250]
Cut through now! See what is. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[20245-20265]
Look now: Thus established. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

This old hermit once mistook brass for gold. The color was similar, but the value vastly different. Mind and wisdom are like this—similar in appearance to the confused, worlds apart to the wise. Test them in the fire of practice; gold is purified, brass tarnishes.

[20270-20284]
Fifth, dimension one—the all-ground like a boat, Dharmakaya like an ocean, floating in that state. Dharmakaya's obscuration arises as path or power. Thus: all-ground and Dharmakaya, example of boat on ocean, path arising naturally.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[20280-20284]
Between recognition and non-recognition, the vast middle way opens. The examples are not just poetic—they are precise pointers. The conch and horn share a shape but not essence. Water and bubble share substance but not stability. Gold and brass share color but not value.

[20212-20212]
Sudden recognition! The framework reveals. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

[20212-20212]
Thus established: This hermit. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[20212-20212]
Seventh, delusion and basis appearances—two aspects of rigpa's state appearing equal. Self-resonance is day; reverse resonance is night. Clear and unclear distinction. Thus: delusion and bardo appearances, example of darkness and light, pure and impure distinguished.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

[20212-20212]
Between these extremes: Analysis proceeds. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

What appears as obstacle is the path itself, unrecognized.

[20212-20212]
This old hermit offers final teaching on examples: The examples are bridges for those who cannot cross directly. Like a ferry across a river—once crossed, you don't carry the ferry. Don't cling to the examples; let them carry you to recognition, then let them go.

[20212-20212]
Examples point to recognition, but are not recognition itself. Like a map and territory—don't try to live in the map. The examples are tools; use them, then set them aside. AH!
