[1589-1598]
First: pacifying. White dharmata is pacifying. Wherever afflictive defilements exist, the stain-free mandala—like a crystal vessel, pure—is unstained by the fault of defilement.

Thus in the pacifying dharmata, afflictions are without stain. This is not removing defilements. It is recognizing that defilements never truly stained the nature.

[1599-1609]
Second: enriching. From the yellow enriching dharmata, all qualities arise—like the wish-fulfilling jewel fulfilling all needs and desires. By that great enriching dharmata, through the dawning of various qualities, all beings are liberated.

The wish-fulfilling jewel is not external. It is the nature of awareness itself—complete, fulfilled, lacking nothing. When recognized, all qualities arise naturally.

Thus. The analysis. The framework reveals: the enrichment is not something added. It is what was always present, now recognized.

[1610-1621]
Third: power. The red power dharmata is complete in the ground without seeking. Power itself is the essence of the Dharma-body—all is complete without seeking.

Like jewel-gold, where the yellow is without need to seek. Thus in the great ground-appearance mandala, the power mandala is without need to seek.

Power is complete in the dharmata ground. Not power to do something. Power as the nature of things—already complete, already accomplished.

The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

[1622-1636]
Fourth: fierce. The green fierce dharmata—all is complete in the nature of fierceness. In the ground itself, pure dharmata, dawning without obstruction to anything.

Like wind-emanation—moves without obstruction to anything. Thus from the great ground-appearance, wisdom dawns without obstruction. That wisdom without need is the nature of pure enlightened-activity.

Thus in the essence of the ground, the enlightened-activity mandala is complete.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

[1637-1640]
These four—pacifying, enriching, power, fierce—are not four different things. They are four aspects of one dharmata, recognized from different angles.

The pacifying aspect: recognition of emptiness, no more grasping.
The enriching aspect: recognition of completeness, nothing lacking.
The power aspect: recognition of capability, nothing needed.
The fierce aspect: recognition of freedom, nothing obstructing.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Between the view and its object, recognition arises naturally, like sun appearing from behind clouds.
