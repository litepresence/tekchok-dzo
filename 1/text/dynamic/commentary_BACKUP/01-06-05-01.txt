First joy—entering wisdom, propelling and gathering winds. Dga' ba,
the bliss of initiation. Not something you create, but what arises when
create conditions without grasping. Like kindling arranged, fire comes—
not by forcing, but by proper preparation.

[8672-8673]
This old fool spent years trying to generate joy. Strained, contorted,
felt nothing but frustration. Then relaxed—stopped trying to make something
happen. Joy was there, like sun behind clouds, like water in the well.
Always present, never manufactured.

[8672-8673]
'Jug pa'i ye shes—entering wisdom, propelling and gathering winds. The
winds of prana that propel consciousness into experience, then gather it
back. In first joy, these winds are recognized as wisdom's play, not
obstacles to control.

[8672-8673]
Entering occurs. Winds settle. Joy arises. Three words—or just: Allow.

[8672-8673]
See what is. The joy of first recognition—no need to add, no need to remove.
Elemental play ('byung ba'i rtsal) —earth, water, fire, air, space—moving
naturally. Let them move. Let joy arise. Do not grasp. Rest.
