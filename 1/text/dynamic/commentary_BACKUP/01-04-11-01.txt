Nothing is established as objects. Through unestablished awareness and wisdom, beyond speech and thought—merely in ultimate truth, existing as the manner of illusion. The qualities of meditation and the ground (gzhi)s of the path. Through the result at the end, obtaining the wisdom of Buddha like illusion, from the nature (rang bzhin) of dharma-body, working benefit like illusion.

From the intermediate Prajñāpāramitā: "All phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion. Nirvāṇa is also like a dream, like an illusion. If something more excellent than nirvāṇa exists, that also is like a dream, like an illusion."

All phenomena are merely various objects and consciousness. Nirvāṇa attains form-body and works benefit. Therefore, the excellent dharma is one's own self-aware suchness and the supreme dharma-body.

[3040-3052]
The dream metaphor—not merely metaphor. Dream and waking equally unestablished. The dream horse, the waking horse—both have no essence.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Yet the dream horse carries the dreamer. The waking horse carries the walker.

Nirvāṇa itself—like a dream, like an illusion. If something excels nirvāṇa, even that. No refuge in existence, no refuge in peace. The middle way is not a path between extremes—it is the exhaustion of extremes themselves.

[3040-3056]
An old traveler. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The Mind-Only school would say the dream-mind was real. The Autonomous Middle-Way school says even the mind is like the dream—appearing, functioning, yet without essence.

All phenomena like dream, like illusion. Even the wisdom that knows this—like dream, like illusion. Even nirvāṇa! What remains?

[3046-3049]
See what is. Rest in recognition. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

All phenomena like dream. Like illusion. Nirvāṇa too. If something more excellent—that too.

Where is the dreamer when the dream is known? Where the knower?

[3057-3061]
Cut! The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

In ultimate truth, not even illusion abides! No objects! No aspects! Even self-aware experience does not exist! Like a barren woman's son—no meeting consciousness!

Conventional truth not true—ultimate truth non-abiding! When awakening from dream, horse and ox appearance stops!

Liberate!

[3057-3061]
SUDDEN. The Consequentialist arises. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The Autonomous Middle Way asserts illusion-like nature. The Consequentialist goes beyond—not even illusion remains. Like a thunderclap clearing the sky.

Beyond all assertions. Beyond all positions. This is the summit.

[3057-3061]
Like a dream within a dream—the Autonomous school wakes from Mind-Only, sees the dream. The Consequentialist wakes from the waking—sees even waking is dream.

Barren woman's son—no son exists to seek. No seeker either.
 The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.
