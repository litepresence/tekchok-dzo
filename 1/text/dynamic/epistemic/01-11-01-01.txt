<classification> Embryological development: Desire-consciousness approaching, parents' union. Father's white essence like mustard seed, small radiant eye, like mercury (pha'i dwangs ma dkar po yungs 'bru tsam mig chung 'tsher ba dngul chu lta bu). Mother's red essence of channel-caste dissolved (ma'i rigs can gyi rtsa'i dwangs ma dmar po la thim pa). Like blood and milk mixed in mother's womb, becoming one. Body formation explanation: First body abiding support is empty of four elements, space-like (nam mkha' lta bu). Parents' nature with afflictions and channel-petal winds, desire mind moved. Root channel's seed-letter wind nature YAM, fire desire actual blazing (me'i 'dod pa dngos su mched). RAM sound moved, blazing changing experience. Desire gone to attachment, desire cause and attachment conditions meet (rgyu dang chags rkyen gnyis 'dzom). Actually entering water desire, gazing at each other, laughing, embracing, holding. Desire of attachment, letter's nature-sound KHAM moved, embracing faculties meeting. Body's earth stability experiences bliss, SAM nature-sound arises. Mother's caste five channels' essence menstruation time becomes seven day sections. Red hook-like drawing wind's power (lcags kyu lta bu 'drin pa'i rlung gi stobs) draws father's essence from head, like iron filing collecting at magnet. From father's twenty-eight vertebrae through horse-transfer, white cavity path emerges. Four seven-day periods in mother's womb grasping body's basis, white bodhicitta arising—crucial point. Risk of reifying as literal biology rather than subtle body process.

<classification> Vajra channel training: Great bliss path trained at vajra root. Bliss inserted in waist channel. Bliss ripened at tip. Actually emerged to expert, mother's caste channel nose-inner tone red dissolved. Like blood and milk mixed in womb, one dissolving into one, two caste-possessing. Five caste capacities draw father's cognition also inside. Later separated from attachment, going to sky-garment, mother any caste has drawing-existence, no satisfaction with bliss—this from desire-attachment's cause-conditions. Desire and attachment two, grasped as cause and condition, thus existence body's basis wind holds. Knowing cause-condition two as non-dual, bliss and great bliss result, body and wisdom result entwined.

<classification> Womb continuation: One day night's parents' cause-condition two become external one, inner non-mixed sesame-container-like abiding. Child's wind-mind held abiding, four elements' binding cause jewel-membrane-like binding, no separation opportunity. When body completes, without mouth-food life not abiding—from this arises.

<classification> Body completion process: At that time elements wind holding body, inner wind's floating power floating up like mercury drops above, thil thil abiding. When body complete, to body-mind any sudden condition, anger-fear, body shaking—crucial point from this.

<classification> Second day: Earth mixed one, weight pressing down, child's crown pressed down, slight suffering exists. At this time body's cause flesh slightly ripened, condition channels slightly water-enlarged.

<classification> Ignorance cause-condition non-dual: Non-conceptual wisdom liberates, Dzogchen beyond rejection-acceptance crucial point. Above body's cause moist slightly blood-congealed, condition water slightly flows down. Third day also wind-mind cause-condition included, burned to atom-small, entered red fire pit, suffering experienced.

<classification> Body formation continuation: This time body's cause wind-only above, condition foot-below only mixed. Fourth day those wind-mercury atom-small scattered, killed-tree limb-section-carrying suffering. This from anger arises. Also above body's body cause atom-small ripened, condition clarity made clear. External four elements' action functioned, internal four elements held. When body complete, outer sun-moon time four.

<classification> Channels (rtsa), winds (rlung), bindus (thig le) formation: Detailed embryological process showing how subtle body structures develop from conception. Not ordinary biology but tantric physiology revealing how consciousness becomes embodied. Five elements organizing through winds and channels. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology if taken as literal anatomy rather than subtle body topology.

<classification> Dzogchen perspective: Embryological process showing how delusion becomes embodied through non-recognition. Body not ultimately real but display of ground. Recognition liberates without rejecting body. Definitive meaning: body as path, not obstacle.
