<classification> Twelve distinctions between rigpa (awareness) and sems (mind): (1) Non-thought similar, but rigpa zang-thal (unobstructed) while mind abides coiled in lhan-ne; (2) Self-abiding similar, but rigpa clear without object, mind bound by object-grasping; (3) One-pointed meditation similar, but rigpa self-settled with depth-moisture always present, rtsa-rlung meditation has dullness-excitement effort-conditions; (4) Spreading to objects similar, but rigpa arises spontaneous-thal liberated grasping-free, thought conceptually fixates outer objects; (5) Dharmata bardo and yidam illusory body appear similarly, but liberation difference in recognizing self-appearance vs habitual concept-traces; (6) Natural nirmanakaya field and path-counted Buddha field similar, but natural self-arising lhun-grub vs delusion-appearance reng-bu ma-thun; (7) Ultimate liberation ka-dag and indeterminate lhun-grub similar in essence-nature-compassion, but purity-delusion difference; (8) Lower vehicles' intellectual view and rigpa direct view similar in name, but appearing to faculties vs appearing to rigpa great difference; (9) Rigpa kayas and conceptual deity kayas similar in mere deity-appearance, but scope, permanence, and need for concept-habituation differ; (10) Rigpa appearances self-arisen and delusion appearances variously arise similarly as impure appearances, but yogins liberated like moon-water and dream naturally non-true while ordinary bound; (11) Light-rigpa thigle and wind-mind grasped rainbow thigle similar as empty-form appearances, but pure nature dbyings-rig appearance vs temporary increasing-decreasing; (12) Liberation field ka-dag and practice time outer-inner ka-dag similar in rigpa boundary-free, but wind-mind purification vs condition-dependent impurity difference. Risk: view-collapse by mistaking similarities for equivalence.

<classification> Four additional distinctions completing sixteen: (13) Inner clarity rigpa appearances variously appearing without ceasing vs mind-born thought-constructs spreading similarly as appearance-mind arising, but rigpa unaffected by conditions, abiding clear never separated, spontaneous arising and liberation simultaneous without limitation vs experience-thought distracted in objects, ordinary self-nature; (14) Wisdom self-arisen perfection and thought spreading to objects both appearing outwardly, but wisdom unobstructed zang-ngel thal-le thad-kar without circling, thought outer object grasping, returning inner one-pursuing-one connection, grasping-fixation self-nature downward; (15) Mantra peak unborn ultimate and lower vehicles' meaning-base unborn unceased words explained similarly as empty-clarity spontaneous wisdom, but here direct familiarity with key point, meaning arising from depth without intellectual thought, for thought ceases; lower vehicles' intellectual thought of "this is ultimate" throws darkness-stone of intellectual investigation; (16) Rigpa direct measure with body-speech-rigpa three key points bound vs secret cycle example-meaning-signs three rigpa measure similar, but here like person with eyes measuring conch, secret cycle like blind person explaining conch color. Kun-tu bzang po klong drug pa extensive citation comparing non-obscured self-mind and non-thought self-rigpa, unobstructed depth-clarity appearance and beings' mind-stream fixation, non-seeking resting meditation and rtsa-rlung mind rest, non-recollection rigpa appearing to objects and recollection-thought six-realm delusion, dharmata bardo pure and yidam illusory body, natural nirmanakaya field and path-counted Buddha, three kayas result ultimate and various indeterminate lhun-grub, vehicles' intellectual and rigpa direct view, effortless rigpa kayas appearing to objects and marks-meditated reflections, rigpa activity play-display and six-realm delusion appearance, pure nature thigle and wind-grasped marked thigle, dharmakaya pure field and nirvana city, self-rigpa free from thought and mind's various experiences, wisdom self-perfection and mind's memory spreading outward, great secret definitive truth-words and hidden-meaning crucial words, definitive three essences instruction and indicating-examples deception. All "similar similar but error error"—crucial great key point of gsang ba snying thig. Must be understood well, practiced in experience, not broadcast explained to all directions.
