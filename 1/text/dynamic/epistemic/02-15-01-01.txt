<classification> Transition from alaya-ground/Dharmakāya distinctions to dependent arising (rten 'byung) nature explanation. Two-fold structure: common distinction and extensive individual natures. Pedagogical framework organizing elemental wisdom teachings into accessible progression. Outer-arising and inner-arising typology from Self-Arisen tantra establishing nondual foundation for elemental correspondences.

<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Outer elements (earth, water, etc.) as basis for inner-arising—connected as basis and dependent, twofold. No beings or buddhas without these two. Sentient beings move within confused expanse of five-arising, possessing great arising self-nature. Buddhas dwell in five pure-arisings' expanse: earth without solidity, etc. Great arising possesses luminosity-wisdom and five colors; small arisings are earth, water, fire, wind, space. Declarative assertion that elements are wisdom-display, not substances to purify. Risk of view-collapse: taking "pure" vs "confused" as ontological hierarchy rather than recognition-distinction.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Five pure arisings: clear, warm, bright, cool, spacious—holding self-nature of movement. Confused five arisings arriving in luminosity-five expanse, meeting inner expanse. Elemental characteristics (mtshan nyid) correspond to awareness-wisdom (rig pa'i ye shes): wind's upliftment ('degs pa) with awareness-wisdom free from birth-cessation; fire's burning (sreg pa) with unobstructed wisdom; water's moistening (brlan pa) with wisdom entering all objects; space's vastness (yang pa) with awareness-characteristic without rupture. Declarative assertion: correspondences operate pedagogically, not ontologically—elements don't become wisdom, already-established identity.
