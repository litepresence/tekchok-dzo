<classification> Awareness-in-expanse-between teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Statement: awareness in expanse's between, not waver, make—this is definitive instruction on how recognition rests. "Between" does not refer to spatial location but to recognition that awareness is neither grasping at display nor separate from it. Instruction to "make not waver"—not effort to stabilize something unstable but recognition of what has never moved. Risk of view-collapse: treating "in expanse's between" as literal location rather than recognition-description of non-duality.

<classification> Pleasure-deriving teaching operates as instructional provisionality from sems-side. From practice, pleasure-arising—describes that pleasure arises from practice but is provisional. Worn-out analysis: when pleasure is worn-out, pursuit of external things is seen as meaningless. Statement: this is pleasure-deriving—also attaining self-power's pleasure, without artificiality, distinguishing by intellect after meditating—this is upāya for distinguishing recognition from artificial states. Risk of reification: treating pleasure as achievement rather than recognition's natural display.

<classification> Thought-poison teaching operates as instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from structured practice. Instruction: this, poison, inserted—exhausted, settled—like—indicates poison refers to conceptual thought that obscures recognition; antidote is to exhaust and settle it. Statement: thought time, without, seeing, self-prime, not-placed—establishes that recognition sees thought as primordial and never established. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating poison-inserting as formal technique rather than recognition's capacity to see through delusion.

<classification> Wind-experience teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Self-nature, wind, entering—this establishes that recognition enters into wind through self-nature's samadhi. Worn-out experience: wind experience's appearance—indicates that recognition's experience through wind is described as seeing various displays like child. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating wind-experience as subtle-body technique rather than recognition's capacity to manifest through subtle energy.

<classification> Appearance's experience teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Statement: wisdom-lamp's five-color's display seeing, samsara's actions all's extreme—establishes that recognition sees display as wisdom's five colors without grasping at samsara's extremes. Analysis: expanse's display seeing, that's self-grasping's, object's, extreme, emptiness-exhausted, self-grasping, reversed—definitively establishes that recognition sees self-grasping as exhausted by emptiness. Risk of reification: treating five-color's display as visual phenomenon rather than recognition's luminous quality.
