<classification> Awareness-in-expanse-between teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Statement: awareness in expanse's between, not waver, make—this is definitive instruction on how recognition rests. "Between" does not refer to spatial location but to recognition that awareness is neither grasping at display nor separate from it. Instruction to "make not waver"—not effort to stabilize something unstable but recognition of what has never moved. Risk of view-collapse: treating "in expanse's between" as literal location rather than recognition-description of non-duality.

<classification> Pleasure-deriving teaching operates as instructional provisionality from sems-side. From practice, pleasure-arising—describes that pleasure arises from practice but is provisional. Worn-out analysis: when pleasure is worn-out, pursuit of external things is seen as meaningless. Statement: this is pleasure-deriving—also attaining self-power's pleasure, without artificiality, distinguishing by intellect after meditating—this is upāya for distinguishing recognition from artificial states. Risk of reification: treating pleasure as achievement rather than recognition's natural display.

<classification> Thought-poison teaching operates as instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from structured practice. Instruction: this, poison, inserted—exhausted, settled—like—indicates poison refers to conceptual thought that obscures recognition; antidote is to exhaust and settle it. Statement: thought time, without, seeing, self-prime, not-placed—establishes that recognition sees thought as primordial and never established. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating poison-inserting as formal technique rather than recognition's capacity to see through delusion.

<classification> Wind-experience teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Self-nature, wind, entering—this establishes that recognition enters into wind through self-nature's samadhi. Worn-out experience: wind experience's appearance—indicates that recognition's experience through wind is described as seeing various displays like child. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating wind-experience as subtle-body technique rather than recognition's capacity to manifest through subtle energy.

<classification> Appearance's experience teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Statement: wisdom-lamp's five-color's display seeing, samsara's actions all's extreme—establishes that recognition sees display as wisdom's five colors without grasping at samsara's extremes. Analysis: expanse's display seeing, that's self-grasping's, object's, extreme, emptiness-exhausted, self-grasping, reversed—definitively establishes that recognition sees self-grasping as exhausted by emptiness. Risk of reification: treating five-color's display as visual phenomenon rather than recognition's luminous quality.

<classification> Samsara's appearance teaching operates as instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from structured path. Analysis: samsara's appearances three, from—imagination, ground, spontaneously-pure—indicates that imagination recognizes ground as spontaneously pure. Gnad: self-grasping's, object's, appearance—recognizing self-grasping's object as appearance, reversed—this is key: appearance appears as self-grasping, but recognition reverses this. Risk of view-collapse: mixing definitive "recognizing self-grasping's object" with provisional "imagination, ground, spontaneously-pure"—former is recognition, latter is delusory view.

<classification> Child-like teaching operates as instructional provisionality for recognition description. Series of seeing child-like appearing as: fire-maker, seeing, poison, peacock, flowering, star, circling, eye-born—these are recognition-descriptions, not visual objects to create. Analysis: outer, inner expanse, clouds arising and clearing, not stable—this indicates that recognition sees outer and inner display simultaneously, with clouds obscuring and clearing continuously. Risk of view-collapse: treating child-like displays as meditation objects rather than recognition's natural manifestation.

<classification> Five-families teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side of Dzogchen view. Description: Ye She's, Nyi Dzong's, Padma's precious, Offering-precious—these are not literal deities but recognition-display modes describing awareness's capacity to manifest as five wisdom-families. Gnad: Padma, emptiness-possessing seeing, arising's, bonds, liberated—establishes that when recognition sees emptiness, five arisings naturally liberate without needing to cut bonds. Recognition sees five families as one arising, not separate entities. Risk of reification: treating five families as external deities rather than recognition-display modes.

<classification> Affliction's liberation teaching operates from sems-side provisional view. Statement: self-grasping, afflictions and dharmata, self-nature—indicates that self-grasping's afflictions are recognized as dharmata's self-nature. This is sems-side analysis: through philosophical reasoning, one recognizes that afflictions lack self-nature. Gnad: not-existing, not-attaining—indicates that what was recognized as affliction never truly existed to attain. Risk of view-collapse: mistaking sems-side philosophical recognition for definitive Dzogchen recognition—former is provisional understanding through reasoning, latter is direct recognition.
