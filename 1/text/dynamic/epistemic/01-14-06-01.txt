<classification> Primordially pure dbyings, spontaneous presence self-radiance like crystal-within-light exists but actually color-form not clear five lights: white—awareness without limit not dividing anywhere; yellow—not seeking resting self-purified, not appearing as object downward; red—attachment-free self-purified, this knowing not appearing as known; green—effort-free self-purified, all doer-deed transcended; blue—unchanging vast self-purified, knowing any essence unestablished abiding. This both lights' arising basis and exhaustion place. Original dbyings-appearance, present path-appearance, bardo self-appearance from this life five lights arise outward; present or bardo or ground-appearance dissolving time, into these five's dbyings self-dissolves. In brief, inner kayas and wisdoms abiding, outer-appearing kayas and wisdoms appearing—arising basis and exhaustion place both.

<classification> Five lights possessing color: Rang-shar citation—wisdom light arose, wisdom unchanging therefore blue arose; wisdom pure therefore white arose; wisdom qualities arising therefore yellow arose; wisdom empowerment complete therefore red arose; wisdom activity complete therefore green arose; all sentient beings likewise abiding. Earlier: self-appearance clear color-possessing light five—white, yellow, red, green, blue. Declarative presentation of five-color wisdom-display as natural expression of primordial purity. Risk: reifying colors as substantial entities rather than awareness-display.

<classification> Thigle threefold: Nyid-zhla kha-sbyor citation—thigle three: basis-holding thigle, appearance-path thigle, result self-ripening thigle. First: heart-center five-light spontaneous presence thigle light-channel clear inside abiding, light-five's surrounding appearing called nature-light thigle; primordially pure rigpa adorned called Kun-tu bzang-po's thigle. Nyid-zhla: basis-holding thigle two—nature-light thigle and Kun-tu bzang-po's thigle. This Gsang-'dus called indestructible thigle, Bde-mchog called unchanging thigle: "Always abiding in heart, one thigle unchanging, those who meditate on it, wisdom definitely arises." Second path thigle two: Nyid-zhla—appearance-path thigle two: relative cause thigle, abiding ultimate thigle. First extensively taught before, briefly: relative cause thigle abiding in all sentient beings' channel-inside, father's cause and mother's condition appearing. Arising elements' essence gathered mother's red thigle arose; all bodhicitta's essence gathered father's white thigle arose. Therefore elements gathering ripens as form; bodhicitta gathering ripens as recollection-thought and experience and awareness. Miraculous birth, egg-birth, heat-moisture birth all have element-gathering seed and bodhicitta-gathering seed, two self-nature meeting taking birth. Thus all sentient beings body-collecting thigle white-red two self-nature abiding. Males' element seed element's self-essence covered not appearing; females' bodhicitta seed basis unchanging not appearing outward. Therefore females without bun bliss meditation suitable, thigle and wind meditated also not liberated. Thus two seeds doing aggregates' support, persons' life formation also these two do: elements self-awareness suddenly form; elements exhausted strength, these two abiding transferred do. Also males' thigle and element seed two separate, seed first continuum like support; finally transferred life's formation, right channel upper tip crown HAM essence actually not appearing; females' element essence pure lower tip secret place sky-protecting mandala's inside A aspect abiding not appearing. Thigle actually falling support also these two do, thigle's seed and element essence gathering's seed called. Differentiating these two crucial.
