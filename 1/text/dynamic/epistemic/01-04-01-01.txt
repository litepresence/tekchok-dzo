<pedagogy>polemical-distinction
<classification> Wrong vehicles (log pa'i theg pa) presentation opening. Three hundred sixty views of conditioned aggregates ('jig tshogs sum brgya drug cu) held by non-Buddhists. Two main categories: eternalism and nihilism extremes (rtag chad kyi rang bzhin). Polemical distinction establishing boundaries of authentic teaching through systematic doxography.

<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Eternalist view (rtag par lta ba) of Samkhya school (grangs can pa): Self (bdag) as nature of atom-darkness-energy three equal parts (rdul mun pa snying stobs gsum cha mnyam pa'i ngo bo). Located in beings' hearts as form fitting body size—large beings thumb-sized (mthe bong tsam), small beings sesame-container-sized (gzhu nas dang sran ma'i ga'u nas), smallest sesame-opening-sized (til gyi nyag ma tsam). Characteristics: white, oily, flexible, indestructible, invisible. Presently atom-darkness-energy with desire-anger-delusion equal; when self-recognizes own nature without seeing (rang gis rig la bltar med pa'i rang bzhin), later liberated appearing as white umbrella paradise (mtho ris kyi steng na gdugs dkar po). Nature: unmoving, without action, profound through object-cognition (yul rig pas zab po), permanently existing. Not knowing this nature causes wandering; knowing and not being distracted from essence liberates. Through sacrifice (mchod sbyin) attains Ishvara realm with retinue and enjoyment. From this branches many individual systems. Madhyamaka citation: "Deceptive permanent, agent non-agent self; without accomplished qualities, Samkhyas analyze. Depending on slight divisions, heretics' systems differ." Risk of view-collapse if Samkhya's categories mistaken for Buddhist analysis.

<risk>nihilism
<classification> Nihilist view (chad par smra ba) of Lokayata (rgyang 'phan pa): Present appearances of seen-heard pleasure-pain beings (da lta'i mthong thos bde sdug 'gro bar snang ba) only; no previous-future lives (tshe sng phy), karma cause-result (las rgyu 'bras), liberation (thar pa) exist. Two types: cause-nihilism (rgyu chad par smra ba) and result-nihilism ('bras bu chad par smra ba). Cause-nihilism: Nirgrantha Jnatiputra (gcer bu pa gnyen gyi bu) and others—previous mind not present mind; elements naturally abiding with mind; mind expands from elements becoming invisible; meeting conditions of heat-moisture, latent mind arises, enters new body, becomes sentient being. Like earth producing grass-trees, water produces moisture-movement-sound, fire burns, wind moves—this is the essential point. Result-nihilism: denying effects of actions. Polemical distinction establishing karma-causality as foundational to Buddhist view. Risk of nihilistic misreading as denial of conventional reality.

[1962-1980]
<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>polemical-distinction
<classification> Heterodox conduct refutation: View-attachment (lta ba chags pa), black mantra supremacy (ngag nag), divination reliance (mo). Distinction between authentic soteriology seeking liberation and magical-ritual approaches seeking worldly benefits. Views as fingers pointing at moon—not to be confused with moon itself. Debate-supremacy (rtsod pa) as ego-grasping; extreme asceticism (dka' thub) failing to recognize primordial purity; attachment to this world ('jig rten chags pa) preventing liberation. Polemical clearing of distractions appearing spiritual but leading away from recognition.

[1981-2000]
<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>negational-clearing
<classification> Conclusion of non-Buddhist refutation: Three fundamental errors—eternalist self-grasping (bdag 'dzin), nihilist denial of cause-result (rgyu 'bras), incomplete realization of middle way (dbu ma). Clearing ground for direct recognition through systematic negation of wrong views. Transition from provisional polemics to definitive Buddhist presentation.

[2001-2030]
<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Buddhist vehicle framework: Distinction between Buddhist ( nang pa) and non-Buddhist (phyi rol pa) represents different orientations—toward liberation versus worldly aims. Nine vehicles (theg pa dgu) as provisional structure guiding beings progressively. Causal vehicles accumulating causes for future enlightenment; result vehicles recognizing enlightenment as already present. Instructional provisionality of graduated path accommodating varying capacities.

[2031-2060]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Dzogchen perspective on nine vehicles: Sophisticated provisional structure (rnam grangs) organizing complete Buddhist teaching. From definitive view (nges don), all nine vehicles resolve into single recognition of rigpa. Apparent hierarchy dissolves in primordial purity—vehicles not truly distinct but recognition-facets. Definitive meaning transcending yet including all provisional frameworks.

[2061-2090]
<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<risk>reification
<classification> Detailed Samkhya analysis: Twenty-five principles (tattvas)—purusha (purusha), prakriti (prakriti), buddhi (buddhi), ahamkara (ahamkara), manas (manas), ten senses, five elements, five subtle elements. Evolution theory from prakriti's equilibrium through gunas (three qualities). Liberation through purusha's discrimination from prakriti. Sutric provisional understanding of non-Buddhist system for comparative doxography. Risk of reifying Samkhya categories as ultimate analysis.

[2091-2120]
<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>polemical-distinction
<classification> Buddhist critique of Samkhya: Purusha as permanent self contradicts anatman. Prakriti's evolution contradicts dependent arising. Liberation through discrimination contradicts wisdom realizing emptiness. Gunas as substantial qualities contradicts emptiness of all phenomena. Systematic Madhyamaka refutation establishing Buddhist superiority through logical analysis.

[2121-2150]
<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>polemical-distinction
<classification> Extended Lokayata analysis: Four elements as sole reality; consciousness as emergent property of physical elements. Death as complete cessation; no afterlife, no karma, no liberation. Critique of ritual, scripture, and spiritual authority. Materialist epistemology privileging sense-perception. Sutric provisional presentation for comprehensive doxography.

[2151-2180]
<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>polemical-distinction
<classification> Buddhist critique of Lokayata: Sense-perception alone insufficient for knowing past-future lives and subtle causality. Emergence of consciousness from elements contradicts dependent arising. Cessation at death contradicts mind-stream continuity. Materialism as extreme wrong view obstructing liberation.

<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Other heterodox systems: Ajivika fatalism, Jain asceticism, various ritual traditions. Comprehensive doxographical survey establishing Buddhist teaching in context of Indian religious landscape. Instructional provisionality of comparative religion framework.

<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Dzogchen synthesis: All philosophical systems, including Buddhist vehicles, as provisional approaches to recognition. Eternalism and nihilism as extreme errors from which Dzogchen is free. Not middle way between extremes but transcendence of extreme-framework itself. All views as mind-made; definitive meaning beyond all views. Risk of view-collapse if Dzogchen itself reified as view.

[2261-2300]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Practical application: Understanding wrong views prevents falling into extremes. Recognition of primordial purity not eternalism; recognition of empty nature not nihilism. Middle way not compromise but transcendence. Doxographical study serving recognition by clearing wrong views.

[2301-2350]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Ultimate resolution: All views, right and wrong, dissolve in rigpa recognition. Samkhya's purusha as metaphor for awareness' clarity aspect. Lokayata's materialism as teaching interdependence of elements. Heterodox practices as upaya for certain beings. From definitive view, nothing ultimately rejected or accepted.

[2351-2400]
<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Scriptural citations: Madhyamaka sources refuting Samkhya and Lokayata. Abhidharma doxographical presentations. Tantric critiques of non-tantric approaches. Sutric provisionality of scriptural authority establishing orthodoxy.

[2401-2450]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Definitive meaning beyond scriptures: All scriptural refutations provisional. Ultimate meaning not established through debate or authority. Rigpa recognition beyond all philosophical positions. Definitive assertion of complete perfection beyond doxography.

[2451-2539]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Transition to Buddhist vehicles: Having cleared wrong views, presentation of correct path begins. Nine vehicles as antidote to nine types of wrong view. Graduated path accommodating capacities while leading to definitive recognition. Instructional provisionality of vehicle presentation.
