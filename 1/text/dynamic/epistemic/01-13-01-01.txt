<classification> Karma wind (las rlung) purification and wisdom wind (ye shes kyi rlung) analysis. Distance-binding cord (rgyang zhags) emerges from wisdom wind's aspect—seeing mountains, houses, etc. as small. Technical term rgyang zhags: pure light-channel wisdom-appearance ('od rtsa dag pa ye shes kyi snang ba) perceived through deluded appearance support (rted 'khrul snang). Two aspects: support (rten) and supported (brten pa). Those with prajñā (shes rab) analyze as two parts. Dzogchen-rigpa view: Four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) separate from samsaric delusion-appearance ('khor ba'i 'khrul snang) and delusion-mind ('khrul sems), holding past aspects. Critical point (gnad 'di gal po che). Risk of reifying rgyang zhags as external object rather than wisdom-display.

<classification> Empty thigle lamp (thigle stong pa'i sgron ma): Round thigle with five-light perimeter from karma wind's pure aspect. From this arises self-arising wisdom lamp (shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma) and pure dimension lamp (dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma). Three aspects of prajñā: ngo bo (essence), rtsal (potency), gdangs (resonance). Ngo bo: When focusing on empty thigle lamp through distance-binding cord's seeing-stance vital point (rgyang zhags gzigs stangs kyi gnad), inner awareness experienced as clear self-clarity (nang gi rig pa dwangs sangs rang gsal). Rtsal: External clarity—object-knowing wisdom (yul shes kyi shes rab), sharp, swift, word-meaning appearing as hollow space (tshig don kleng 'dol du 'char ba). Gdangs: Vajra coiled-channel appearance like golden thread coiling (rdo rje lu gu rgyud kyi snang ba gser gyi skud pa lding ba). Without distinguishing these, some label awareness as self-arising wisdom lamp, some label inner resonance, some label coiled-channel—mere confusion. Dzogchen triad requiring precise discrimination. Risk of view-collapse if three aspects conflated.

<classification> Dimension lamp (dbyings kyi sgron ma) external-internal: External—blue light-ray in pure space mandala first appearing. Internal—spreading from that, five-light radiance appearing as five colors. Citation: "Dimension is external and internal; external holds cloudless sky; internal is dimension lamp purity." Some mistakenly identify external sky as merely cloudless empty space—that not valid since space doesn't relate to individual, while lamp follows individual's existence-non-existence. Here, inner sky's blue resonance (nang gi nam mkha'i gdangs sngo ba) appearing externally called external dimension (phyi dbyings). Sky-opening, appearance-ground, base-places merely—dimension itself not thus. Actual is blue-green (mthing ga); dimension is inner dimension (nang dbyings). Thus from that dimension appearances arise—though called external-internal separately, understand as merely clarity-transfer from rainbow-light's dark house (sna tshogs snang ba 'ja' 'od kyi khur khyim). Not internal-turned-out, external-turned-far; appearances arising from that known as external-internal. Five-light clarity also mind-itself's nature-clear self-resonance shining—purified of thing-stain (dngos po'i dri ma), examination-prajñā-stain (yid dpyod shes rab kyi dri ma), bad-conception-mind-stain (ngan rtog sems kyi dri ma). Lamp: when seeing that appearance, clearing karma and habitual-pattern darkness (las bag chags mun pa sel ba). First of four lamps gathering from four wheels (chos kyi 'khor lo) into clarity. Five wisdoms (ye shes lnga): mirror-like wisdom (me long lta bu'i ye shes), equality wisdom (mnyam pa nyid kyi ye shes), discriminating wisdom (so sor rtog pa'i ye shes), all-accomplishing wisdom (bya ba grub pa'i ye shes), dharmadhatu wisdom (chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes). Risk of reifying five wisdoms as substantially distinct.

<classification> Pure dimension lamp continued: Light-kāya appearance collection ('od sku 'char byed 'dus pa). Five colors collected, pervading unmoving blue-green, surrounded by diamond fence (rdo rje'i ra ba), coiling into vajra channel without exit. Inside, light-kāya with radiating light-rays appearing—here cutting dharmatā bardo, completely awakening. Light-appearance rising horizontally, spokes appearing, perimeter appearing—deluded appearance self-ceasing, shining as wisdom. From those—light garment fragments, strips, interrupted areas appearing. External-internal dimension mixing—wisdom without intermediate. From that—eye lattice (mig tshags), eye webs (mig mangs), web-areas, net (dr ba), half-net, flowers, thousand-petaled lotus, house-support, tent-house like lower part appearing—making dharmatā appearance path. Four lamps determine path-appearance four signs-measures (lam gyi snang ba bzhi'i rtags tshad).

<classification> Four lamps turning mind: Distance-binding cord sees dharmatā directly, turning mind from dogmatic grasping ('dod rgyal du 'dzin pa). Empty thigle sees increase-progression, turning mind from happiness-self-continuum grasping. Pure dimension sees awareness arriving at measure, turning mind from impure delusion appearance. Self-arising wisdom sees exhaustion-appearance, turning mind from kāya-wisdom grasping. Instructional provisionality showing how technical Dzogchen phenomenology functions as liberation support.
