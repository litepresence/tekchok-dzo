<classification> Opening passage establishing seven pith instructions (མན་ངག་གི་གལ་ཆེན་བདུན) that surpass all other paths. First pith: direct perception without effort (ངོ་སྤྲོད་ཐད་འཛིན) - not relying on wisdom achievement or sharp/dull faculties, but direct recognition. Second pith: not relying on intellectual assessment (གོ་བ་ལ་མི་བར�依赖) - self-dharmata as direct perception, not conceptual construction. Third pith: not relying on words (ཡི་གེ་མ་བརྟེན) - single letter ungrasped, meaning directly seen. Fourth pith: not relying on mind-made ground/path (སེམས་ཀྱི་གཞི་ལམ་མ་བརྟེན) - self-clear, buddhahood without reliance. Fifth pith: not affected by cause-effect (རྒྱ་མཚན་འབྲས་མི་བརྟེན) - self-dawning enlightenment. Sixth pith: not affected by aging (རྒས་པ་མ་བརྟེན) - self-arising clear light from within. Seventh pith: three bodies as path-appearance (སྤྱོན་སྣང་མཐོང་བ་) - clear light primordial purity spontaneously accomplished. Polemical distinction: Dzogchen surpasses all outer-inner secret mantra vehicles through these seven.

<classification> Ati surpasses Ati through distinction. Three sections: Mind (སེམས), Vast Expanse (ཀློང), Instruction (མན་ངག). Mind section: confidence in ground-free expanse (གཞི་མེད), rigpa directly seen (རིག་པ་ཐད་དུ་མཐོང་), mind breathing self-clear (སེམས་འབྱུང་རང་གསལ). Vast Expanse: nine changes (འགྲུབ་དགུ) as final aim. Instruction section: outer-inner-secret circles (ཕྱི་ནང་གསང་) relying on bardo time, liberating as light-body. Channels and winds: abandoning coarse (རྩོལ་ངན), three unmaking piths bind only that (གསུམ་པོ་མི་འགུགས). Risk of reifying sections as progressive stages - instructional provisionality of three-section framework as recognition-vehicle.

<classification> Channels and winds: common paths rely on coarse conventional channels/winds, body training with much effort, creating obstacles and deviations. This path abandoning coarse through three unmaking piths binds only that - not making common delusion-illusions but wisdom-channels beyond grasping. Ultimate wisdom's channels/winds beyond grasping and effort, made the path, training body to purity of light. Not relying on common delusion-illusions, obstacle-clearing - obstacles are delusion, delusion is suffering. That delusion's channels/winds made the path - elements arising from making delusion the path. This path making ultimate non-delusion the path has no obstacles or deviations. Risk of practice-methods being read as ontology - these are methods, not stages of becoming.

<classification> Deviations: those relying on mind-made intellect, not seeing meaning, deviate into paths of equality-duality and forms of experience-realization. This path directly seen through sense-powers has no deviation or deviation-place - meaning definitely directly arrived at. Delusion-place does not exist here: not establishing path-measure on raw-ri knowing-experience, instant change-return. For clear light's self-resonance, appearance-experience without deception is certainty-grasped. Unlike six applications: wind-resonance and rigpa-resonance have distinction - jewel-light and lamp-light have distinction. Delusion-appearance, rigpa's impure energy-resonance made the path, does not liberate. Pure appearance, clear light's actual resonance made the path, liberates. These distinctions are illustrated through tantra citations - Dzogchen view establishing clear distinction between confused and pure appearances without creating hierarchical ontology.

<classification> Tantra citations supporting seven pith distinction: From Definite Explanation - jewel-lamp light distinction, jewel-mind directly flows, though no distinction in wrong knowing, great distinction in meaning-doing. From Thalgyur - through pith of dharmata directly, good/bad action not realized, heart-essence summary, sense-powers sharp/dull not, intellect/words exhausted, not wisdom-sense-powers see, dharmata not seen through words, common vehicle meaning not accomplished, three bodies path-appearance, seeing this three realms do not reverse, all dharmas equal taste one, ground/fruit without reference. These citations provide scriptural authority for the seven pith distinctions - instructional provisionality using tantra to establish Dzogchen as definitive meaning.

<classification> Second: explaining path possessing distinctions - two aspects: (1) presentation of empowerments that ripen the unripened (དབང་བསྐུར་སྨིན་པ), (2) presentation of instructions that liberate the ripened (མན་ངག་བསྲུང་བ). First: empowerments and companion samaya - two. Persons whose minds have reversed from samsara, free from attachment to this world, desiring to obtain meaning of Dharma simultaneously. Outer elaboration-possessing empowerment relying on mandala and vase: body-empowerment obtaining yidam-deity body. Inner elaboration-free empowerment: speech-empowerment - speech yidam recitation clear, inner inexpressible meaning's experience arising. Secret very-elaboration empowerment: mind-empowerment - mind arrives at top, clear light great meaning experienced. These are tantric transformative methods for ripening practitioners.

<classification> Secret supreme: body-posture and gaze reliance, empowerment to body-speech-mind three. Body-posture's pith: liberating into three bodies' postures. Speech relying on speaking-ceased, sound's power exhausted, inexpressible meaning understood. Mind relying on sign's pith, blessing-energized, clear light emptiness - essence not established. This aims at ripening mantra-path. Thus: body ripening complete arising-stage instant clear; speech ripening complete uncommon power arising; mind ripening complete completion-stage signs/measures arrived at. Body-speech-mind-sems ripening complete, dharmata-direct path experience completely perfect. Samaya sequence: ripening-complete support, relying on samaya continuum. Generally samaya's root is root-guru - through desiring meaning's siddhi, guru pleased, siddhi arises. Risk of reifying empowerments as external transmissions rather than recognition-facilitating pointing.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Final synthesis: all these distinctions - seven piths, three sections, empowerments, samayas - resolve into single rigpa recognition. The elaborate presentation is for those needing structure; the final meaning is beyond structure. Whether through seven piths, three sections, or four empowerments - all point to same awareness nature. Declarative assertion: there is no attainment beyond recognition, no enlightenment beyond rigpa, no path beyond self-arising wisdom. The entire presentation is provisional scaffolding for revealing what was always already present. Final view: all elaborations (including this very presentation) dissolve into the expanse of rigpa - self-appearing, self-liberating, self-completing.
