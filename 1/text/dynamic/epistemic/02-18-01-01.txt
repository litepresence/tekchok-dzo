<classification> Seven pith instructions surpassing all paths. Rigpa self-appearance secret great Vajra Essence surpasses common vehicles through seven distinguishing points: (1) Direct perception without effort or sharp/dull faculties—not relying on wisdom achievement but recognizing directly. (2) Not relying on intellectual assessment—self-dharmatā as direct perception, not conceptual construction. (3) Not relying on words—a single letter ungrasped, meaning directly seen. (4) Not relying on mind-made ground/path—self-clear, buddhahood without reliance. (5) Not relying on cause-effect action—self-dawning enlightenment, effort and acceptance-rejection free. (6) Not affected by aging—self-arising clear light from within. (7) Three bodies as path-appearance—clear light primordial purity spontaneously accomplished. Polemical distinction: Dzogchen surpasses all outer-inner secret mantra vehicles through these seven. Risk of view-collapse: treating piths as achievements rather than recognitions.

<risk>reification
<classification> Atiyoga surpasses Atiyoga through distinction. Three sections: Mind (sems), Vast Expanse (klong), Instruction (man ngag). Mind section: confidence in ground-free expanse, rigpa directly seen, mind breathing self-clear. Instruction section: outer-inner-secret circles relying on bardo time, liberating as light-body. Channels and winds: abandoning coarse, three unmaking piths bind only that—not common delusion-illusions but wisdom-channels beyond grasping. Instructional provisionality of three-section framework as recognition-vehicle. Risk of reifying sections as progressive stages.
