Four elements' birth stages: summer-winter-autumn-spring four's work changing, elements' order transference, sickness, fever, death, body speech mind work particularities showing. Elements' order degeneration, reversal, progress, change: going life's degeneration, reversal, progress, change. Past long life changing eliminating eliminating abiding changing certainly; future long transference eliminating moved abiding certainly; present short spurting work and calculation's change knowing. Inner transference definite measure: one youth possessed, one day wind count 21,600 moving; water clock and dbyu gu's calculation connected.

One day eight sessions, session time 32; dbyu gu 64; transference 16; each transference wind 1,000 and 350; each dbyu gu 300 and 35 and 8-8 moving; each session 2,700 moving. Thus one day elements twelve work divisions 12 divisions, wind 12 increasing decreasing showing. Increasing decreasing north south Meru sun going; going south day night length arising vital point; Padma dkar po commentary: "North south going time adding subtracting" also. Sun north going month each water clock two-two day long, night short; south going reverse day short night long.

Thus wind's movement 675 increasing-decreasing, water clock each calculated. Year one month 12, days 360, meals 720 counted, one day time twelve 1,930 and 32 conceptuality adventitiously moving; 1,928 pure wisdom measure moving wind held; thus day five, night five, midnight evening two 12 parts calculated; autumn spring equal time two certainly taken. Month itself days increasing-decreasing calculation: female male difference; female six 29 less; male six 30; year one six days lacking; thus month's power established, autumn spring both middle day night equal remaining half and three excess known. Vinaya also sojong possible impossible calculated. Risk: conflating calendar calculations with Dzogchen timeless recognition.

Thal 'gyur las: day 13 also, month one; thus twelve complete, year one considered; inner and night 700, 20 complete, day 360 considered; these complete year one.

Third, wisdom and karma wind definite conclusion: general establishment; individual function explanation; change measure certainty. First, establishment actual; objection abandoning. Objection establishment and answer giving. Channels moving only one, karma and wisdom two separately moving what; moving different two logically, one then two not possible; moving only one, samsara-nirvana either from one not logically—answer: moving only one also, channels squeezed-not-squeezed moving from wisdom wind gone function bliss-emptiness, clarity-emptiness wisdom wind called.

Example: bha ra's one child angered tiger becomes, not angered human comes; awareness' sound and body's channels moving wind only one also, channels squeezed-not-squeezed from, consciousness workable wisdom, unworkable affliction becomes horse arising, faultless. Risk: nihilistic interpretation that karma and wisdom are merely mechanical results of channel manipulation, denying their deeper nature.

Second, individual function explanation: wisdom and karma wind functions. First wisdom wind's function four wisdoms: wind abiding part ground-abiding wisdom work; that done whatever appearing natural state above other changing impossible. Appearance part characteristic-holding wisdom work; that done each race and body and wisdom and light and color clear, not transcending; thus clear attachment-free wisdom called. Arising part knowable-gathering wisdom work; that done self-other benefit unhindered; doing and doer self-continuity not. Moving part consciousness-gathering wisdom work; that done worldly and transcended consciousness various arising; arising self and self-grasping not.

Thus four definite cause time; path time ultimate elements four; result time four bodies' nature ripening. Thus ground-path-result three 12 arises, Buddha's activity twelve arising cause certainly. Second karma wind's work four functions: right moving male, left female, outer coming various appearances entering, inner filling conceptuality various spreading. Right-left time definite male female ripening father-mother power; naturally right moving transference work, karma's end near; left moving time grasping work. Outer going inner filling going-coming power: outer gone joy work, inner coming unhappiness. Both also wheel's spreading-gathering vital point day-night arising.

Outer going part day appearance arising; inner filling part night appearance arising. Thus both doing functions four two-two counted eight becomes; these also parts counted 24 abiding. Karma wind's particularities twelve, 12 moving work, body's growth-decay work; that outer year 12, inner month 12, secret time 12 arising. Then samsara's work variously karma wind does. Third change measure: thus body ripened youth possessed, one day four elements each wind's change measure: earth wind 5,400; water, fire, wind winds also 5,400, 400—sum 21,600 youth possessed change measure definite.

Wind element latency life's time calculated: wind transference long life's end carried, short not carried; strong merit and enjoyment possessed; clinging disease but suffering; slow wandering disease few; dull virtuous mind not arising; 'byil always non-virtuous, decreasing abiding; excited mind distracted, beings not loving. Elderly 58 lacking, elements' order degeneration, thus greatly excited life's time quickly; sinking suffering lamentation; swirling mind natural state not reached, non-virtuous; slow life-end long always happy; 'khyig always enemy dispute basis arising; crooked work loving, life short; changing enjoyment great disease; reversed body speech karma not accomplished; increasing peaceful-increasing work quickly; short life's enemy long always suffering; opened shows good-bad.

Thus wind calculation: worldly and transcended two; worldly life and merit and happiness-suffering etc.; transcended change measure and transference time. Change measure: day part twelve, night part sixteen. Day elements work individual happiness-suffering virtue-non-virtue conceptuality various horse riding; night also same, wisdom wind increasing making. Transference time already explained.
