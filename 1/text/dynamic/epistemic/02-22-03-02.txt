<classification> This passage presents Trekchö—definitive Dzogchen practice of directly cutting through all grasping and solidity of mind. Unlike tantric completion stage working with subtle body energetics, Trekchö operates directly on level of awareness—recognizing all thoughts, emotions, appearances are self-liberated upon arising. Terminology—freedom from elaborations, unfabricated, self-settled—represents definitive meaning: no practice in conventional sense, only recognition of what already is. Longchenpa distinguishes Trekchö from all lower methods: no visualization, no mantra, no meditation object—only direct recognition of awareness's own nature. Khregs refers to reification of experience—the belief in substantial existence. Trekchö cuts through by direct recognition that all appearances are self-liberated—they leave no trace. Not analysis or transformation but recognition of empty nature from the beginning. Hallmark is freedom from all philosophical positions—no view to maintain, no meditation to perform, only naked awareness. This is direct path: cutting through all reference points to reference-free nature. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating as practice rather than recognition.

<classification> Passage establishes relationship between Trekchö and Thögal—two aspects of Dzogchen practice. Trekchö emphasizes primordial purity: cutting through to recognize empty essence. Thögal emphasizes spontaneous presence: direct crossing to luminous nature. They are non-dual: cannot have one without other. Risk of view-collapse: treating them as separate practices or believing one superior. They are two aspects of single awareness—Trekchö emptiness aspect, Thögal appearance aspect. The dyad mirrors primordial purity and spontaneous presence: two aspects of single awareness. They are not sequential but simultaneous. Both necessary, both already complete. Definitive view: no practice—only recognition that awareness is already self-liberated and already spontaneously manifesting.
