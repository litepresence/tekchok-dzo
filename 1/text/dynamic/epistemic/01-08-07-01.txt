<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Debate opening establishing primordial purity (ka-dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun-grub) objections. Three contradictions: if essence primordially pure, samsara never experienced, sentient beings' delusion impossible; if nature spontaneously present, all effortlessly liberated from beginning; if basis single, ka-dag and lhun-grub contradict as substances. Negational clearing preparing for non-dual resolution. Risk: taking objections as refutation rather than teaching-device.

<classification> Response: essence primordially pure yet samsara appears through lhun-grub's expressive power (rtsal) alone. Dream analogy: sleep-mind's nature contains no dream, yet dream appears to perception. Sentient beings appear through illusion-display, not established in actual essence. Already liberated—merely remaining in self-place like child returning to mother. No new liberation established, no binding ever occurred.

<classification> Appearance conventionally lhun-grub, emptiness ultimately ka-dag—mere verbal designation without substance distinction. Single essence, different conceptual isolates (ldog pa tha dad). Monk who is fully ordained example: single person, two aspects, non-contradictory. Klong drug pa citation cycle: essence primordially pure contradicts samsara; nature spontaneous contradicts bondage; neither contradicts because no established nature to harm. Beyond words—neither ka-dag nor lhun-grub established as thing.

<classification> Supreme basis presentation: beginning basis essence primordially pure like pure conch, nature spontaneous not established as thing, inside white mandala subtle self-light as depth-clarity, without conditions not appearing outwardly. Outside limitless youth vase body as actual dharmata state. Essence-nature-compassion triad: emptiness of things yet subtle awareness with primordial resonance; spontaneous presence as arise-base of all appearances without limiting marks. Risk: spatializing as inner/outer containers.

<classification> Bkra shis mdzes ldan chen po citation: before realized Buddhas, before unrealized sentient beings, rigpa self-arisen wisdom unmoved from basis, without conditions three appearances abide together. Self-arisen wisdom speaks its own abiding: "Great appearance vast expanse unmoved from great Dharmakaya, abides as great unconfused Buddha." Essence-body non-ceasing, unchanging, secret method, unmoved, unmoving, unshaken. All appearances complete in one time, all wisdoms complete in one instant.

<classification> Thalgyur citation: essence abides as body yet form-color-marks not perceived; nature manifesting as light yet marks without signs; essence-nature-compassion threefold abiding—Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya undivided. Five colors markless, without parts, from uncompounded display accomplished. Risk: literalizing three kayas as substantial bodies.

<risk>nihilism
<classification> Extensive tantric citations establishing primordial purity (ka-dag) through systematic negation. Yi-ge Med-pa'i rgyud: "I have no birth/death, no accumulation, no view, no meditation, no conduct, no result." Mu-tig phreng-ba: "No Buddha, no sentient beings, no ignorance, no delusion, no mind, no intellect." Klong drug-pa: "Free from elaborations, primordially pure, pure from beginning, beyond words and letters." Rang-shar: "No conceptuality, no ignorance, no mind, no intellect, no grasping." Negational clearing exhausts all conceptual constructs to reveal unfindable basis. Risk: mistaking negation for nihilistic emptiness rather than affirmative primordial purity.

<classification> Spontaneous presence (lhun-grub) detailed presentation: rtsa-rlung (channels-winds) basis where five root life-energies, five kayas, five speeches, five minds, five qualities, five activities, five wisdoms, five lights arise. Rin-po-che ga'u (jewel casket), gzhon-nu bum-pa (youth vase), inner clarity subtle, outer vast unbounded. Five colors—white clarity, yellow increase, red attachment-purified, green activity-without-effort, blue all-pervading completion—each with depth-clarity (gting-gsal) and self-resonance (rang-gdangs). Not nothingness, not established thing, but display-potential without fixation. Risk: spatializing as containers, reifying colors as substantial entities.

<classification> Five wisdoms arising from spontaneous presence: mirror-like wisdom (me-long ye-shes) forms and colors appearing as reflections; equality wisdom (mnyam-nyid) free from acceptance-rejection; discriminating wisdom (sor-rtog) individual clarity without confusion; all-accomplishing wisdom (bya-grub) effortless spontaneous activity; dharmadhatu wisdom (chos-dbyings) pervasive without center or limit. From Chos-sku (Dharmakaya) emptiness, ye-shes (wisdom) complete knowing arises naturally. Self-arisen wisdom beyond causes-conditions, unproduced-unceasing, play-display (rol-pa) only appearing, variously perfect basis. Appearances-emptiness indivisible—samsara-nirvana neither established nor separate.

<classification> Concluding synthesis of section eight: ka-dag lhun-grub indivisible great pervasion, kayas and wisdoms inseparable, beginningless suchness, self-arisen wisdom peerless unique singularity. Essence-nature-compassion threefold great identity is original Buddha (gdod-ma'i sangs-rgyas), spontaneous presence mandala, basis reality (gZhi'i gnas-lugs). Thal-gyur citation essence primordially pure, nature spontaneously present, compassion unobstructed—yet nothing established as thing. No duality, no enumeration, no existent-nonexistent establishment. Transition to next topic: how appearances arise from basis (gZhi-snang shar-tshul)—spontaneous presence appearances, Samantabhadra's liberation mode, sentient beings' delusion mode. Risk: premature resolution before understanding appearance-modes.
