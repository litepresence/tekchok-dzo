<pedagogy>negational-clearing
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Debate opening establishing primordial purity (ka-dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun-grub) objections. Three contradictions: if essence primordially pure, samsara never experienced, sentient beings' delusion impossible; if nature spontaneously present, all effortlessly liberated from beginning; if basis single, ka-dag and lhun-grub contradict as substances. Negational clearing preparing for non-dual resolution. Risk: taking objections as refutation rather than teaching-device.

<classification> Response: essence primordially pure yet samsara appears through lhun-grub's expressive power (rtsal) alone. Dream analogy: sleep-mind's nature contains no dream, yet dream appears to perception. Sentient beings appear through illusion-display, not established in actual essence. Already liberated—merely remaining in self-place like child returning to mother. No new liberation established, no binding ever occurred.

<classification> Appearance conventionally lhun-grub, emptiness ultimately ka-dag—mere verbal designation without substance distinction. Single essence, different conceptual isolates (ldog pa tha dad). Monk who is fully ordained example: single person, two aspects, non-contradictory. Klong drug pa citation cycle: essence primordially pure contradicts samsara; nature spontaneous contradicts bondage; neither contradicts because no established nature to harm. Beyond words—neither ka-dag nor lhun-grub established as thing.

<classification> Supreme basis presentation: beginning basis essence primordially pure like pure conch, nature spontaneous not established as thing, inside white mandala subtle self-light as depth-clarity, without conditions not appearing outwardly. Outside limitless youth vase body as actual dharmata state. Essence-nature-compassion triad: emptiness of things yet subtle awareness with primordial resonance; spontaneous presence as arise-base of all appearances without limiting marks. Risk: spatializing as inner/outer containers.

<classification> Bkra shis mdzes ldan chen po citation: before realized Buddhas, before unrealized sentient beings, rigpa self-arisen wisdom unmoved from basis, without conditions three appearances abide together. Self-arisen wisdom speaks its own abiding: "Great appearance vast expanse unmoved from great Dharmakaya, abides as great unconfused Buddha." Essence-body non-ceasing, unchanging, secret method, unmoved, unmoving, unshaken. All appearances complete in one time, all wisdoms complete in one instant.

<classification> Thalgyur citation: essence abides as body yet form-color-marks not perceived; nature manifesting as light yet marks without signs; essence-nature-compassion threefold abiding—Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya undivided. Five colors markless, without parts, from uncompounded display accomplished. Risk: literalizing three kayas as substantial bodies.

<classification> Basis nature analysis: from ka-dag perspective nothing established, outer clarity without form-color-marks; from lhun-grub's expanse five lights appear as bodies, rays, thigles—subtle self-identity. If ka-dag isolated, where do kayas and wisdoms arise? If nothing in basis, how do they emerge? Dzogchen resolution: not ka-dag alone, not lhun-grub alone, but indivisible essence-nature dynamic. Five colors abiding as unity without holding color as separate. Rolled-up potential without fixed shape, not ceasing without dependence, all-pervading great self-resonance.
