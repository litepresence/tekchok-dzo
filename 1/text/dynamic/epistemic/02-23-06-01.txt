<classification> Third instruction showing non-reversal—five light-rays coiled without touching five-fold conjunction, like five horse-spokes coiled—presents sophisticated recognition technique. First: awareness entering light—when looking outward at self-appearance, place in state of knowing those appearances as self-appearance. As those appearances dissolve through rays into one's own heart center, this is called light entering awareness. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating as mechanical procedure rather than recognition that appearance has never been other than awareness. External lights like armor-plates dissolving into one's own awareness's heart center, entering the lap—this is metaphor, not anatomy. Dharmata mixing, liberated in primordial purity's ground—definitive point: dissolution is not process but recognition of non-duality. Appearances dissolve not into location but into their own nature as awareness.

<classification> Sun-Moon Union citation confirms: person's luminosity dissolving into union—not two things uniting but recognition of non-duality. Further appearances self-arise as body-appearance, yet those bodies neither big nor small, equal in size, with ornaments, color, abiding-manner, thrones, each with their own mudra—all these bodies pervaded by five-fold pairs, five sets with light-enclosure, father-holding families, mother-holding families, heroes, heroines, all mandalas complete in one. At that time, extremely subtle light arises from one's own heart center, connecting to all bodies hearts and appearing—this is not visionary attainment but recognition that all bodies have always been single awareness's display. Knowing captured by one's own knowing—the capture is not grasping but recognition without fixation. Dzogchen integration: all apparent multiplicity is single bindu-thigle of awareness, never plural, never departing from primordial purity. Risk of view-collapse: treating multiplicity as real rather than display of single awareness.
