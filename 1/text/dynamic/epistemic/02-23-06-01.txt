<Masterful analysis:
The third instruction showing non-reversal (*mi ldog pa'i gdams ngag*)—at that time, five light-rays coiled without touching the five-fold conjunction, like five horse-spokes coiled—presents sophisticated recognition technique. First: rigpa entering light (*rig pa 'od la 'jug pa*)—when looking outward at self-appearance, place in the state of knowing those appearances as self-appearance. As those appearances dissolve through rays into one's own heart center, this is called "light entering rigpa" (*'od rig pa la 'jug pa*). Risk of technicism: treating this as mechanical procedure of "absorbing light" rather than recognition that appearance has never been other than awareness. The instruction: "external lights like armor-plates dissolving into one's own rigpa's heart center, entering the lap like"—this is metaphor, not anatomy. "Dharmata mixing, liberated in primordial purity's ground" (*chos nyid du 'dres pas ka dag gi sa la grol ba*)—the definitive point: dissolution is not process but recognition of non-duality. The appearances (*snang ba*) dissolve not into a location but into their own nature as awareness.>

<Masterful analysis:
The *Zla ba kha sbyor* (Sun-Moon Union) citation confirms: "That person's luminosity dissolving into union" (*skyes bu'i 'od gsal de zung 'jug la thim pa*)—not two things uniting but recognition of non-duality. The further appearances self-arise as body-appearance (*sku'i snang bar rang shar*), yet those bodies are neither big nor small, equal in size, with ornaments, color, abiding-manner, thrones, each with their own mudra—all these bodies pervaded by five-fold pairs (*lnga lnga'i zung gis khyab pa*), five sets with light-enclosure, father-holding families, mother-holding families, heroes (*sems dpa'*), heroines (*sems ma*), all mandalas complete in one. At that time, extremely subtle light arises from one's own heart center, connecting to all bodies' hearts and appearing—this is not visionary attainment but recognition that "all bodies" have always been single awareness's display. Knowing captured by one's own knowing (*rang gi shes pas zin*)—the "capture" is not grasping but recognition without fixation. The Dzogchen integration: all apparent multiplicity is single bindu-thigle of awareness, never plural, never departing from primordial purity.>
