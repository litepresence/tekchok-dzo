<risk>reification
<classification> This passage presents foundational Dzogchen view of ground as primordially pure and spontaneously present. Terminology—wisdom expanse, dharmata, self-arisen svabhvikakaya—represents definitive meaning par excellence. Unlike sutric or tantric presentations, this operates from direct view of awareness without reliance on reasoning or transformation. Epistemic status is declarative finality: these are not instructions but descriptions of ever-present reality. Ground as basis for all vehicles—the same nature underlying all vehicles. Fivefold analytical framework—essence, definitive terminology, divisions, characteristics, fruition—structures presentation while transcending it. These are pedagogical categories for category-free ground. Essence of expanse is vast, pervading greatness, self-nature of clear self-clarity. Not definition but pointing to what cannot be defined. Risk of reification: treating ground as metaphysical foundation.

<risk>nihilism
<classification> Passage continues with ground exposition emphasizing non-duality of ground and fruition. Original ground, final liberation-place, holding seat of non-delusion assert identity of path and fruition. Nothing to achieve because everything already the case. Risk of nihilism: treating ground as metaphysical foundation. Ground is way things are—empty yet manifest, pure yet appearing. Ground and fruition non-dual is not identity but recognition that what is sought is already present. Path is recognition of what was never absent. Original ground and final liberation-place distinguished only by knowing vs. not-knowing—not by any change in ground. Mirror simile: mirror's nature never changed by what appears. Freedom from elaborations prevents both nihilism and eternalism. Definitive view: not attainment but recognition.

<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Fourfold division of expanse—outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed—requires careful navigation. These are not levels to traverse but simultaneous dimensions of single awareness-display. Outer as space, inner as lamp, secret as light/bindu, unsurpassed as self-liberated delusion-appearance are pedagogical unfoldings, not ontological stratification. Risk of view-collapse: treating these as stages of practice. All four are ever-present: outer expanse IS unsurpassed when recognized. Mapping to awareness, wisdom, three kayas, fruition-object completes non-dual integration. Expanse IS awareness, IS wisdom-display, IS three kayas, IS fruition-object. These are not attributes but expanse's self-recognition. Four are co-emergent, not sequential stages.
