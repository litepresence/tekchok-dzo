<classification> Fourfold analysis of bodily signs (rtags) indicating previous training in three kayas: sequence of signs (rtags kyi rim pa), logical arising ('byung ba'i 'thad pa), results of familiarity (goms na 'bras bu), non-attainment without familiarity (ma goms na nges pa mi rnyed pa). Instructional provisionality: signs as indicators of capacity, not guarantees. Tantric physiology—sku gsung thugs marks manifesting on forehead, throat, heart. Risk: reifying signs as permanent endowments rather than recognition-signals.

<classification> Dpal nam mkha' med pa sku gdung 'bar ba chen po'i rgyud citation establishing three-kaya signs: sku'i rtags (body marks), gsung gi rtags (speech marks), thugs kyi rtags (mind marks). Specific bodily markings: forehead with right-swirling conch or trident-shaped vertical wrinkles marked with OṂ; throat right side (men) or left (women) with eight-petaled lotus, conch, banner, hook, sword marked with AḤ; heart with vajra, wheel, trident radiance, jewel shape, or HŪṂ with marks. Risk: literalizing marks as physical deformities rather than subtle-body indicators.

<risk>temporalization
<classification> Logical arising ('byung ba'i 'thad pa): three kayas inherently present in all beings, previous familiarity causes present manifestation. Citation: "Even butcher and outcaste without fortune have three kayas inherently; through previous familiarity with them, upper signs of three kayas appear when encountering obstacles." Definitive assertion: signs confirm recognition-capacity already present. Risk: temporalizing as linear causation rather than spontaneous display of ever-present nature.

<classification> Results of familiarity (goms pa): possessing signs and practicing body/speech/mind yoga leads to vajra-body, vajra-speech, vajra-mind attainment in second lifetime. Sku gdung 'bar ba citation: signs as definitive indicators—"Who previously trained in Buddha-body will have conch or trident marks on forehead." Instructional urgency: without practice, signs alone insufficient; karmic imprints ('phral gyi mi dge ba) and forceful karma (las kyi 'phren pa shugs drag) can obstruct. Risk: practice-misread-as-ontology—thinking signs guarantee liberation without practice.

<risk>elitism
<classification> Speech signs (ngag gi rtags): spontaneous eloquence indicating previous vajra-speech training. Citation: "Who previously familiarized with Buddha-speech will speak definitive words, unchanging even when interrupted." In one day, thousand verses or four hundred verses' meaning appears in mind; whatever spoken benefits others. Instructional framework: speech capacity as indicator of gsung rdo rje potential. Risk: elitism—creating hierarchy of "gifted" vs "ordinary" practitioners rather than recognizing all have capacity.
