<classification> This passage presents inner tantras—Mahayoga and Anuyoga—as advanced vehicles within tantric framework. Shift from outer to inner tantra represents epistemic elevation: dualism replaced by non-dual practice, deity-yoga becomes instantaneous rather than gradual. Inner tantras emphasizes completion stage and subtle body practices transforming energetic basis of experience. Epistemically, this is still provisional meaning within Dzogchen hermeneutics, but represents highest provisional—direct preparation for Atiyoga. Transformative view operates at level of energetic transformation rather than conceptual purification. Completion stage represents pinnacle of tantric methodology. Unlike generation stage with deliberate visualization, completion stage works with subtle body—channels, winds, and bindus—already present. Practitioner does not create deity but recognizes energetic basis of enlightenment within their own body. This is closer to Dzogchen's recognitive approach but still operates through method. Longchenpa presents inner tantras as bridge: maintaining tantric vocabulary and method while preparing practitioner for Atiyoga's direct recognition requiring no method. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating subtle body as ultimate reality, or believing energetic accomplishment equals spiritual realization. Completion stage produces genuine siddhi, but within Dzogchen hermeneutics these remain provisional.

<classification> Integration of inner tantra with Dzogchen terminology marks Longchenpa's hermeneutical strategy. Terms like spontaneously accomplished samadhi, three kayas, dharmakaya bridge tantric completion stage with Dzogchen recognition. However, epistemic status remains instructional provisionality: subtle body experiences described are still transformative rather than recognitive. Risk of view-collapse: treating visionary experiences, lights, bindus as real accomplishments rather than awareness-display. Experiences of completion stage are genuine transformations of perception but remain within realm of experience. They are signs that practice is proceeding correctly but can become obstacles if grasped. Longchenpa's presentation elevates these toward Dzogchen by interpreting them as self-display of awareness rather than achievements. Bindus appearing in vision are not external objects but awareness's own manifestation. Light is not perceived by awareness but is awareness's self-radiance. This prepares practitioner for Atiyoga: experiences recognized as ground's spontaneous presence. Completion stage produces transformation but these remain path experiences, not fruition recognition.

<classification> Passage culminates in Dzogchen terminology transcending tantric methodology: primordially liberated, self-liberated, unfabricated. These represent definitive meaning of inner tantra—recognition that all completion stage practices were never necessary because ground is already perfect. However, within full nine-vehicle hierarchy this remains provisional preparation for Atiyoga. Same nature principle: inner tantra and Dzogchen share same view but differ in method and capacity.
