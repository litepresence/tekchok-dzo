<classification> Spontaneous presence from kayas three: sambhogakaya light's aspect appearance, emanation wisdom compassion's manifestation, both dharmakaya's manner is. Thus kayas three appearance-mode only different, essence not different. Essence one nature three bodies is, nature spontaneous presence three bodies is, compassion capacity three bodies is. Spontaneous presence within three bodies abiding, spontaneous presence light five colors light sambhogakaya, spontaneous presence manifestations emanation body, both dharmakaya's essence is. Three kayas are aspects of one spontaneous presence, not ontologically distinct entities. Risk of reification: treating kayas as separate existences rather than descriptions of one ground.
