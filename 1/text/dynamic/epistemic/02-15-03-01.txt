<classification> Three kayas abiding in expanse through different aspects of single essence. Self-Arisen citation: three kayas wisdom-appearance without obstruction; perceived objects one, essence appearing individually. Awareness-itself's (rig pa gcig gi snang tshul) appearance: thought-free awareness Dharmakāya essence; uncensored clear awareness Sambhogakāya; whatever-appearing awareness Nirmāṇakāya. Complete; awakened. Declarative assertion that three kayas are simultaneous aspects of single rigpa, not sequential attainments. Risk of view-collapse: temporalizing three kayas as developmental stages or reifying them as separate locations/entities.
