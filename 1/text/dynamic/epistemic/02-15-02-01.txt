Functions: awareness-potential producing, bindhu-potential producing, light-potential producing, non-awareness root holding, mind-helper making. Life-wind potential relies upon awareness-potential abiding in life-channel. Instructional provisionality providing subtle body energetic framework for recognition.

Risk of view-collapse: treating nonduality as achievement through practice rather than recognition of always-present nature.
