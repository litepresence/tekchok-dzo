<classification> Five life-holding winds (srog 'dzin pa'i rlung lnga) from Self-Arisen: root-holding life, protecting life, spreading life, impure life, shattering life. Functions: awareness-potential producing, bindhu-potential producing, light-potential producing, non-awareness root holding, mind-helper making. Life-wind potential relies upon awareness-potential abiding in life-channel. Instructional provisionality providing subtle body energetic framework for recognition. Risk of reifying winds as physiological entities rather than wisdom-function descriptions.

<classification> Five fire-equal winds (me mnyam gyi rlung lnga): clear-impure separating, warmth-producing, clear-change, distinctions-gathering, praise-making. Nonduality (gnyis su med) sequence: nondual with life, awareness, lamp, bindhu, wisdom. Declarative assertion that winds are not separate entities to be manipulated but wisdom-display already nondual with awareness-aspects. Risk of view-collapse: treating nonduality as achievement through practice rather than recognition of always-present nature.

<classification> Remaining three wind categories completing twenty-five-fold taxonomy. Color-radiance winds (bkra gzi mdangs skyed): consciousness-producing, mental-emergence, radiance-possessing, consuming, dispersing—functioning as objects of wisdom (shes-rab), appearance (snang-ba), lamp (sgron-ma), ignorance (ma-rig-pa), and mind (yid). Pervasive winds (khyab byed): basis-pervading, immediate-pervading, hostility-fear-pervading, memory-pervading, grasping-body-pervading—appearing to wisdom, lamp, perception, thought, mind. Karma winds (snying rje med pa'i las): agitating, liberating, reversing, hastening, instantaneous—pervading aggregates, moments, bardo, concepts, three times. Instructional framework mapping energetic functions to cognitive domains. Risk: literalizing as anatomical structures rather than wisdom-body correlations.

<classification> Etymological exposition and essential synthesis: twenty-five winds reduce to five roots. Agitating wind (rnam-par skyod byed) named for moving from true ground. Life-holding (srog-'dzin) for sustaining wisdom-life. Color-radiance (bkra gzi mdangs skyed) for naturally luminous five lights. Compassionless karma (snying rje med pa'i las) for liberating into wisdom-space. Fire-equal (me-mnyam) for inseparable abiding with wisdom-appearance. Essential point: pure five winds are Buddha-wisdom, impure are sentient conceptual constructs. Branched winds (yan-lag bzhi) arise from life-wind compassion-display like sun-rays—ascending wisdom-horse, descending wisdom-light-rays, fire-equal maturation-power, pervasive completion-power. All contained within life-wind essence without dispersion, non-ceasing display-potential only. Kun-gsal citation: body like moon-water reflection, speech like four branch-winds fire-light-rays in rigpa-expanse, mind as life-wind self-nature wisdom-fire without directional limitation abiding as five wisdoms. Risk: view-collapse by treating winds as objects of manipulation rather than self-display.

<classification> Five great elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space) as supportive foundation for wisdom-display. Five fires: pervading inner-outer, illuminating inner-outer, equalizing inner-outer, conceptual-action fire, completed-action fire—abiding in heart, six sense-doors (eyes and five limbs), flesh-skin-joints, soles of feet, palms. Five earths: all-appearing, unchanging vajra, all-arising jewel, appearance-revealing Amitabha, completion-accomplishing—abiding with rigpa, lamp, thigle, wisdom, wisdom respectively. Five waters: unchanging, peaceful-clarity, qualities-expanding, attachment-free, grasping-free completion—moistening all channels, bones, blood, lymph, within two eyes. Five spaces: universally-pervading, objectless self-radiance, unmixed purity, meaning-indicating, pure-field-liberating—supporting rigpa itself, five lights, pure-dbyings lamp, signs-wisdom, twenty-one introductions confidence. Twenty-five winds and five elements as wisdom-supports (rten) of great elements, with subtle elements as actual supports. Instructional framework for subtle-body recognition. Risk: spatializing as containers, materializing as gross elements.

<classification> Section conclusion and transition: having established the nature of the elements as foundation (rten), now entering the supported (brten-pa) section on dbyings and wisdom. Rigpa jewel in secret casket, naturally luminous palace, abiding as essence-nature-compassion triad. Body as unmanifest own-benefit yet outer-appearing kayas display non-ceasing self-clarity. Nature as five-light display-base, life-wind four branches as speech-essence primordially abiding. Compassion as self-arisen rigpa-essence, two wisdoms (knowing all from inner-clarity of dharmata, knowing all aspects from outer-clarity of characteristics) spontaneously complete. Kayas and wisdoms inseparable, without change-transition. Two wisdoms: knowing-all from looking at dharmata inner-clarity, knowing-all-aspects wisdom-appearance from looking at characteristics outer-clarity. Transition to fourfold division: vessel-kayas, radiance-lights, supported-wisdom, enlightened-activity. Risk: practice-misread-as-ontology by treating subtle-body framework as literal cosmology rather than recognition-support.
