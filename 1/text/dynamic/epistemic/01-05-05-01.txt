<pedagogy>skillful-means
<classification> This section presents the tantric framework of empowerment (dbang) as the gateway to the unsurpassed vehicle. The structure presents basis, path, and result—but from the Dzogchen view, this apparentgradualism is skillful means (thabs) for practitioners requiring structured engagement. The definitive meaning (nges don) transcends yet incorporates the provisional (drang don).

<pedagogy>negational-clearing
<classification> The presentation of "empowerment" as gateway operates within the sutric provisional framework. From the Dzogchen perspective, recognition (rig pa) is not empowered from outside but is the self-arising wisdom (rang byung ye shes) that was never obscured. Empowerment points to recognizing what is already present.

<classification> The qualities of the guru described here—compassion, skill in teaching, dzogchen instruction—represent the skillful means (thabs) through which realization is pointed to. These are not causes of enlightenment but conditions for recognizing the cause that is already complete.

<risk>reification
<classification> The six characteristics (discarding samsara, few desires, contentment, experience, skill in tantra, skill in view, compassion) represent the "glorious Vajradhara" form. Risk: treating these as achievements to attain rather than recognition of what is naturally present.
