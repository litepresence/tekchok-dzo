<pedagogy>direct-pointing
<classification> Direct introduction as essence of Dzogchen—master's pointing and disciple's recognition of nature of mind. Not explanation or transmission of power but pointing to what has always been present. Bypassing conceptual understanding and gradual preparation. Definitive direct pointing to rig pa.

<view>great-perfection-awareness
<pedagogy>assertive-completion
<classification> Self-liberation principle as distinctive feature of Dzogchen. Thoughts, emotions, appearances not transformed through antidotes but liberated through recognition of nature. Delusions self-liberated when nature seen—not technique but natural—quality of awareness. Definitive recognition of liberation as natural state.

<pedagogy>direct-pointing
<classification> Direct introduction revealing three aspects of natural state: essence as emptiness, nature as clarity, compassionate energy as unobstructed manifestation. Not taught conceptually but recognized directly. Definitive recognition beyond instruction.

<view>great-perfection-awareness
<pedagogy>skillful-means
<classification> Prerequisites for direct introduction—stable mind, purified obscurations, devotion to master. Without these, introduction may not take hold. Not requiring extensive intellectual study but requiring receptive capacity. Instructional provisionality of preparation.

<view>atiyoga-recognition
<pedagogy>assertive-completion
<classification> While conventionally speaking of master and disciple, pointing and recognition, ultimately no separation. Master's pointing as display of awareness; disciple's recognition as awareness recognizing itself. Definitive non-duality of introduction.

<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Three modes of self-liberation: liberation upon arising, liberation upon recognition, liberation without trace. Progressively deeper levels of recognition, not techniques to apply. Definitive recognition of awareness's natural function.

<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Relationship between self-liberation and other methods. Gradual vehicles emphasize antidotes and transformation; Dzogchen emphasizes recognition and self-liberation. Faster but requires greater capacity. Definitive approach compared to provisional methods.

<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Delusions not enemies to be destroyed but displays of awareness that liberate themselves when recognized. Fire naturally burns, awareness naturally liberates. Definitive recognition of delusion as display.
