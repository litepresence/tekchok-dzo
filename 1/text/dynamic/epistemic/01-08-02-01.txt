<classification> First assertion negated: "Primordial nirvana spontaneously present from beginning"—if lhun-grub, unchanging, samsara-nirvana arising impossible. If effortless liberation for all, cause-effect primordially spontaneously present, cause-effect simultaneous absurdity. If desired, cause samsara time, result not nirvana clear; if two one, samsara-nirvana both absurd, nirvana-samsara absurd because two one. Klong drug pa citation: "Spontaneous presence various basis also not true basis, if thus, beings' effort not liberation, because ignorance itself obscures. If rigpa exists liberation said, result also not liberation? Like black charcoal, even washed white cannot change color. Cause-effect different, or not spontaneous presence. If cause-effect one, effort unnecessary. Therefore spontaneous presence basis meaningful or not? Kun-tu bzang po spoke to me, teacher spoke thus, great being, as you understood, this knowable phenomena only, not true nature." Polemical distinction demonstrating lhun-grub as provisional teaching, not ultimate basis. Risk: view-collapse by taking spontaneous presence as ultimate ontological category.

<classification> Second assertion negated: "Essence not established, indeterminate, conditions transform indeterminate." Sems-sde citation: "Indeterminate name various, meaning also merely imputed empty, nature not singularly determinate, however imputed thus appearing." Negation: if one, contradicts one-not-one direct contradiction different substances reasoning; if indeterminate basis samsara's arising basis, then itself determinate, self-words clear; if nirvana's basis also clear. Also when basis pure, impure not—intermittent indeterminate contradicts; also impure returning to pure absurd because basis indeterminate without part-whole. Also samsara-nirvana mutually pervaded absurd because basis indeterminate becoming anything. If desired, beings effortlessly liberated, Buddha impure returning suffering experience absurd. Also basis sentient absurd because indeterminate, definitely singly asserted. Klong drug pa citation: "Indeterminate basis taught, this also not true essence, I understand intellect thus: result intermittent? Or with returning? Indeterminate becomes determinate, indeterminate becomes determinate, own indeterminate own exists, if determinate like action's end—all these knowable not? Teacher's words thus." Polemical refutation of indeterminate basis as eternalist nihilist extreme. Risk: view-collapse by mistaking indeterminacy for freedom from extremes.

<classification> Third assertion negated: "Essence unchanging like space, appearance manner unchangeable like fire-water determinate." Negation: essence without-appearance manner unchangeable, basis cannot produce samsara, nobody can liberate. If nirvana existed from beginning, same as tirthika permanent, contradicts liberation from causes-conditions. If samsara's essence nirvana, unchanging desired, essence nirvana then liberation unnecessary, like fire hot no need to change. "Needed for mind-appearance" contradicts unchangeable appearance manner. "Samsara's appearance, not basis's appearance"—basis becomes both, because apart from basis samsara's appearance exists. Also if basis realized then determinate, basis unsuitable because before realization realization-basis exists, then realizing mind arose, realization not dependent on basis; even if realization-mind dependent on basis, must exist before realization, pervaded. If not realized also basis, who knows? If mind knows, not realized also basis revealed. Klong drug pa citation: "Determinate basis taught, this also not true essence, like eye-disease persons, from conch yellow appears, self-returning difference, self-other two-none determinate free from extremes, therefore also not true. Or cause determinate result determinate, same as permanent self, this also knowable not? Words same as before." Systematic dismantling of determinate basis position.

<classification> Fourth assertion opened: "Rigpa's essence directionless universally arising, accepting anything." Beginning of negation: accepting anything—ground abiding accepting or non-abiding accepting? [File continues in next section].
