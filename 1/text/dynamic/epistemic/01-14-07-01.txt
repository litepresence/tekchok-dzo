<classification> First thogal vision: light platter appearance ('od kyi snam bur snang ba). Self-arising rigpa's display manifesting as five-colored light field without center or boundary. Five lights—white, yellow, red, green, blue—arising from wisdom as natural self-display, not external phenomena. Instructional provisionality: appearance as recognition-object, not visual hallucination to achieve. Risk: reifying light platter as external vision to be seen rather than spontaneous display of self-arising wisdom.
