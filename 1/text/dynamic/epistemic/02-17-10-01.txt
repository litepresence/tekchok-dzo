<classification> A-clarity meditation instructions: clear A visualization, then dissolution without other thought arising, clear-essence half-arising. Meditate in that state. Very important points experienced with great effort. Instructional provisionality providing recognition-support through letter-visualization practice. Risk of practicing as concentration exercise rather than recognition of clarity-emptiness nature.

<classification> Transference ('pho ba) three types classified by practitioner capacity, not destination. Great: clear-light transference—death-time awareness extracted to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmadhatu. Medium: illusory-body transference—death-time awareness projected from illusory-body state to dharmatā deity-form, holding bardo illusory-body. Final: body-speech-mind transference depending on channel-wind points. Three capacities of transference-doer (pho mkhan gyi blo rtsal), not three places. Instructional provisionality of graded methods for different recognition-capacities. Risk of view-collapse: seeing transference as literal relocation rather than recognition-moment at death.

<classification> Body-speech-mind transference two types: actual (dngos su) with support—channel-wind dependent-origination action; actual-not (dngos med) without support—mind focus only. Actual: wind training methods through sound, craft, illusion-skill, training dependent relations, individual element internal harmony—body-speech-mind focus accomplishment. Actual-not: showing mind's familiar power. Brahma-aperture (tshangs buk) as transference path—upper nine apertures. Four Vajra Seats citation: immediate mind transference from upper apertures liberates even from killing Brahmin or five boundless crimes without doubt. Instructional provisionality providing emergency recognition-method. Risk of reifying Brahma-aperture as literal anatomical location rather than wisdom-gateway symbol.
