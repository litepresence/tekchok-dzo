<classification> Three kayas' pure appearance from Self-Arisen: one complete, two complete, all complete—wisdom-appearing unceasing and clear; pure wisdom light-rays emanating; concept-free awareness pure; five light-rays unceasing clear; non-grasping great self-liberation; outer inner secret dharmas all clear; action-released awareness; actor and acted complete in single moment; mind-separated awareness; all appearance variety complete in single moment; self-appearance's great clear purity; deluded appearances complete in single moment; great self-liberated self-appearance; other-arisen dharmas complete in single moment. Declarative assertion that completion is always-already present, not achievement through action.

<classification> Awakening is without dualistic-grasping aspect. Without action, delusion awakens; without concept, afflictions awaken; without grasping, self-arising awakens; without clinging, conceptual thought awakens; without attachment, ignorance awakens. Three kayas' awakening manner. Declarative assertion of effortless self-liberation through recognition—not destruction but awakening of confusion's nature. Risk of nihilism: misreading "without action" as license for inaction rather than recognition of non-doing as ground-nature.
