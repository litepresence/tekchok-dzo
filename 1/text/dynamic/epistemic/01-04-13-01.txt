<pedagogy>polemical-distinction
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Inner tantra (nang pa) superiority over outer tantra distinctions. Three outer tantras (phyi pa gsum) practice purity rituals, cleansing, fasting—generating disgust (gdungs) through dualistic purity/impurity. Inner tantra practitioners consume five meats/five nectars, practice with consorts (rig ma) without acceptance/rejection or pure/impure distinctions—transcending outer tantra limitations. Outer practitioners cannot comprehend deity yoga; inner practitioners have capacity and are superior. Risk: view-collapse—mistaking inner tantra as license for immoral conduct rather than recognition of primordial purity.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Inner tantra definition through five aspects: essence (ngo bo), etymology (nges tshig), purpose (dgos pa), result ('bras bu), divisions (dbye ba). Essence: nature of liberation in one lifetime through non-dual truth, equal wisdom-display (bdden pa dbyer med dg mnyam nyid ye shes kyi rol pa). Etymology: "inner" (nang pa) because great results through small effort, method-vehicle (thabs kyi theg pa). Purpose: obtaining both siddhis in one life. Result: reaching Vajradhara's level in this life. Risk: reification—taking "one lifetime" as temporal guarantee rather than recognition of timeless liberation.

<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<risk>vehicle-hierarchy
<classification> Three inner tantra divisions: Mahayoga (rgyud), Anuyoga (lung), Atiyoga/Dzogchen (man ngag). Rang shar citation: "Inner has three: Maha, Anu, Ati." Mahayoga emphasizes generation stage (bskyed rim), Anuyoga emphasizes completion stage, Atiyoga emphasizes direct recognition without staged progression. Instructional provisionality: three approaches for different capacities, not hierarchical superiority. Risk: vehicle-hierarchy—creating elitism around Atiyoga while dismissing Mahayoga/Anuyoga as "lower."
