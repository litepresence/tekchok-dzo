<classification> Four supports/helpers (grogs/rgyab brten bzhi) for key point familiarity: Dpal ri bo brtsegs pa'i rgyud citation—four divisions of key points for direct familiarity. Four key points complete path to end: outer—exhausts four appearances with elaboration; inner—exhausts four times' increase-decrease; secret—exhausts four months' changes; unsurpassable—empties basis of four body-speech-mind-consciousness. Also demonstrates four empowerments outer, completes four chakras inner, manifests four wisdoms actually secret, shows increase of four lamps unsurpassable. More than four is proliferation without need, fewer than four lacks root—fruits of desired aims don't ripen. Instructional provisionality of numerical framework as recognition-scaffold. Risk: practice-misread-as-ontology by treating fourfold structure as literal requirement rather than comprehensive coverage.

<classification> Body and speech key points (lus ngag gi gnad gzir ba): Gsang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud citation—after such preliminary, to see direct meaning, body-speech-mind thoroughly bound. Three aspects: body—postures (bzhugs stangs) of three kayas; speech—like mute, not speaking anything; mind—cutting spreading-gathering thought-constructs. Body postures: lion-like (seng ge), rishi-like (drang srong), elephant-like (glang chen)—three postures. Mu-tig phreng ba citation: body key points threefold—lion posture, elephant posture, abide like rishi. Here three kayas with different conceptual isolates (ldog pa tha dad), even single body with three different postures. These postures equal to 3000 Buddhas' fortune. Instructional framework for Thogal body conduct establishing stable foundation for vision-practice. Risk: reifying postures as causal conditions for realization rather than supports for recognition.
