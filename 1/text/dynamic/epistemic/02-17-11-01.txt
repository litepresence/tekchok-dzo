<risk>nihilism
<classification> Two-instruction capacity training for bardo mastery. Daytime illusory-body clear-light point combined with bardo-arising familiarity—dream mastery indicates bardo liberation certainty. Key point: neither abandon existence nor establish non-existence; neither attach to existence nor generate sadness about non-existence. Do-place, good-bad, appearance-manner, grasp-thought—neither cut past traces nor welcome future; neither depend on present latency with antidote. Neither stretched nor puffed nor hesitant. Practice: arise-appearance mind-touch without trace, liberate appearance at appearance-moment. Like bird leaving no trace. Instructional provisionality of moment-to-moment liberation. Risk of nihilistic misreading as denial of appearances rather than liberation within arising.

<classification> Liberation metaphors: movement liberated at move-moment, self-dissolving without trace—like space-hail dissolving; appearance-consciousness liberated as nondual without outer-inner boundary—like water dissolving in water. Thus realization cuts latency attachment. Klongchenpa Six citation: person not cutting past trace, not raising future hope, present consciousness put in its place—before-after mixed without distinction, one-gathered essence called yogi realizing three-time equality. Declarative assertion of atemporal liberation through present recognition.

<classification> Actual bardo instruction: earth-water-fire-wind-space gradually dissolve into space-clear-light. At that time, upward HAM and downward A gather at heart, bliss-clear non-conceptual clear-light appears. Instructional provisionality providing death-moment recognition-framework. Risk of reifying dissolution stages as literal elemental breakdown rather than progressive subtlety of recognition.
