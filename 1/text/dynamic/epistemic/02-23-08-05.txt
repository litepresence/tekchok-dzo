<classification> Three moments structure describes recognition phases: first, aggregate appearances cease along with four wisdom preparations; second, spontaneous presence door is seen; third, that also ceases, and primordial purity appearance is seen through self-face recognition. This is not temporal sequence but simultaneous aspects of single recognition: what appears as three moments is pedagogical description of what occurs in one instant of awareness. Risk of view-collapse: reading as first this, then that, finally enlightenment rather than recognizing all three as modalities of ever-present ground. Analogy to swift, slow, and very slow arrows indicates capacity differences in recognition-speed, not hierarchical stages—supreme faculties recognize instantly what takes others longer to stabilize, but recognition itself is identical.

<classification> Rang Shar citation enumerates liberation modes for those of supreme faculties at moment of completion: some liberate through three moments, some through mirror-like aggregate, some through mother-father union, some through flickering giving rise to self-arisen bliss, some through compassion-rays, some through two aggregates, some through whatever-appearance-as-body. This is supreme liberation mode—these are not different attainments but recognition-marks of same awareness. Ultimate point: in one moment, one buddhas and emanation arises naturally. This is Dzogchen's radical immediacy: path is not sequential cultivation but recognition that fruition has never been absent. Six other grounds contrasted with final moment indicate that even meditative days of other vehicles are surpassed instantly when recognition occurs. Risk of reification: treating liberation modes as different practices rather than recognition descriptions.

<classification> Heap-appearance ceases; momentary spontaneous presence appearance ceases; momentary primordial purity truth seen. Emanation from primordial purity ground not separate—path all empowerments suchness obtained; like shooting star sky-running mode, shooting star that light-radiates similar, emanation emanated beings benefit done. Benefit done in three days possible. This is definitive view: liberation is not achievement but recognition of what already is. Risk of nihilism: interpreting cessation as annihilation rather than recognition of self-liberated nature.
