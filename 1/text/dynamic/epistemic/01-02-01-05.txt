<risk>substantialization
<classification> Saha world as thirteenth in twenty-five stacked array. Basis-essence-flower-ornamented terminology encoding recognition-topology, preparing for definitive view. Risk of treating stacked cosmology as literal vertical arrangement rather than multidimensional recognition-mandala.

<pedagogy>assertive-completion
<classification> Dharmakaya field as ground of dharmata luminosity employing genitive to assert identity—ground IS luminosity, not possessing it. Definitive Dzogchen position establishing gzhi as primordial purity without transition or transformation.

<view>dzogchen-sems
<pedagogy>provisional-teaching
<classification> Sambhogakaya field as five-family perfected retinue operating at sems-side level, presenting visionary topology for practitioner recognition. Thirty-six activity classifications and five-syllable self-arisen letters as preparatory framework within tantric-Dzogchen transition.

<risk>thing-making
<classification> Nirmanakaya field with twelve emanation deeds and saha-world teaching activity employing tantric biographical framework. Three-kaya classification by teacher, place, and teaching following Candrakirti triadic schema. Risk of literalizing emanations as historical biography rather than recognition-display.

<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>provisional-teaching
<classification> Cosmogonic sequence of contained beings—nectar rain to jewel-trees to lotus-born beings—presenting standard Buddhist world-formation narrative. Operating within temporal framework of vivartakalpa, conventional description awaiting Dzogchen transposition.

<view>tantric-transformative
<pedagogy>skillful-means
<classification> Wish-fulfilling tree specifications and celestial distance calculations employing tantric visionary cosmology. Kalpavrksa motif and graduated spatial hierarchies configuring recognition of merit's natural display within transformative framework.

<classification> Form realm heaven enumeration with halving dimension patterns following classical Abhidharmic cosmology. Systematic reduction of body-size and lifespan operating within conventional mathematical cosmology.

<view>atiyoga-recognition
<pedagogy>polemical-distinction
<classification> Pure Abodes exclusive to aryas and inaccessible to ordinary beings marking Dzogchen distinction between recognition and non-recognition. Polemical clarification of path structure establishing certain realizations as ontologically unavailable without direct awareness recognition.

<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>skillful-means
<classification> Brahma realm completion with fractional dimensions presenting conventional cosmology. Systematic enumeration operating at form/desire realm threshold following Vasubandhu's Kosha conventions for celestial hierarchy.

<view>sutric-provisional

<classification> Six desire heavens enumeration with human-year calculations presenting standard Buddhist cosmology. Temporal magnification formulas operating within conventional karmic-merit framework.

<view>tantric-transformative
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Bodhisattva cosmology with Tusita heaven as completion place employing tantric soteriological framework. Celestial mechanics as skillful means—sun/moon arising from method/wisdom dependency—configuring path structure for recognition practice.

<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Absorption-based form realm classifications with geometric progression of body measures encoding hierarchical merit distribution. Form realms structured by absorption and virtue/light quality. Risk of confusing meditative hierarchy as eternal liberation rather than superior samsara—meditative stability result, not wisdom.

<risk>reification
<classification> Pure Abodes (gzang ma ris) enumeration: Five heavens—'Bras bu che, Bsod nams skyes, Sgra med 'od, Dge rgyas, Tshad med dge—exclusively for non-returner aryas. Body measures halving progressively (2,000 to 32 cubits), lifespans corresponding (2,000 to 32 intermediate eons). Risk of reifying pure abodes as literal locations rather than recognition-states.

<classification> Six desire god realms (lha rigs drug) with Cosmic Tree (dpag bsam shing) cosmology: 'Phrul dga', 'Dod gshen 'thab bral, Dga' ldan, 'Thab bral, Rgyal chen bzhi. Human evolution narrative—first beings rdzus skyes from light, progressively densifying through merit-decline. Human lifespan degeneration from immeasurable to 10 years through five stages. Risk of literalizing evolutionary narrative as historical fact.

<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Human realm cosmogenesis completion: Sun (nyi ma) and moon (zla ba) arising from aspiration-prayers of beings, named through functional recognition. Five stages of human development: light-body, progressively densifying through desire-arising, agriculture, conflict, and external sun/moon dependence. Tantric transformative reading: cosmogonic narrative encodes recognition-process, not literal history.
