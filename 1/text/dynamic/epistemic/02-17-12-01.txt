<classification> Seven verbal views (tshig gi lta ba) distinguished from view of meaning (don gyi lta ba). Verbal views held by individual intellectual analysis: action-free primordial liberation, effort-free primordial liberation, progressive mind-stage distinctions, transcending virtue and vice, great non-doing non-arising, great unmodified self-purity, great self-arisen self-liberation. These are conceptual formulations, not recognition itself. Meaning-view: vidya in own immediacy (rang thog tu), direct dharmatā viewed as sense-power domain—not through prajñā analysis. Polemical distinction between conceptual proliferation and direct recognition. Risk of view-collapse: mistaking verbal formulations for recognition, or thinking "no view" means nihilistic denial.

<classification> Verbal views summary: Great Perfection mind-vast (sems klong) general view condensation. Enumerated views: nine individual progressive views. Thalgyur citation: fourfold enumeration—outer (phenomena-view, eight progressive mental preferences as intellectual apprehension), inner (dharmatā-view, essence-nature seen as illusory), secret (self-awareness view, linked-chain connection seen), unsurpassed (suchness as expanse-vidya). Instructional provisionality of graded view-frameworks guiding recognition-progressively.
