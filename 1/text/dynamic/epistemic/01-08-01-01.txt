<classification> Seven extremes of ground view (gzhi bdun) establishing doctrinal precision. The ground (gzhi) is presented through seven distinct views: (1) ground as primordial purity, (2) ground as spontaneous presence, (3) ground as indivisible primordial purity and spontaneous presence, (4) ground as certainty, (5) ground as uncertainty, (6) ground as changeability, (7) ground as acceptance of anything. Each extreme is a partial view that must be transcended through recognition of ground's nature as beyond all extremes. The seven grounds are not seven different grounds but seven ways of relating to the single ground. Risk: reifying any single extreme as the complete view.

<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Awareness (rig pa) as the single ground transcending all vehicle distinctions. The essence of awareness is not established as any single thing, but as the great sphere free from elaboration (spros bral thig le chen po). This is the definitive meaning (nges don) that incorporates yet transcends provisional meaning (drang don). The ground of awareness is recognized, not produced. View register: direct recognition, not philosophical analysis. Risk: intellectualizing what must be directly recognized.
