<classification> Six student types (gdul bya rigs drug): seeds of six types exhausted, six afflictions purified, six wisdoms arise—capacity possessing these powers. Teacher typology: root teacher (rtsa ba'i bla ma) with four marks (mtshan nyid bzhi) conferring empowerment, explaining tantra, giving instructions, student practicing instructions; branch teacher (yan lag gi bla ma) when receiving oral instructions after empowerment and tantra explanation. Teachers to avoid (spang bya'i slob dpon): eight types from Rang-shar—ignorant with great pride, foolish clinging to words, not contemplating secret mantra meaning, competitive cutting others, entered wrong path, never saw mandala, samaya diluted, cannot answer questions, small learning great pride. Not secret mantra teachers, cannot teach Ati Dzogchen, association harmful. Instructional provisionality establishing proper teacher-student transmission framework. Risk: reifying teacher hierarchy as status rather than functional relationship.

<classification> Good student qualities (slob ma bzang po): mind turned from samsara, great devotion and longing for teacher/Dharma/friends, stable faith not entering other pursuits, confident in definitive meaning with generosity and perseverance, little attachment good-natured, great wisdom abiding in samaya/vows, harmonious with others' minds turned to Dharma, listening to teacher's words not mixing secret doors, extensive learning self-disciplined, especially viewing teacher as Buddha or greater—ten Dharma possessions (chos bcu). Rang-shar citation: great faith and perseverance, great wisdom without attachment, great respect practicing secret mantra, non-conceptual mind without distraction, samaya-possessing diligent in practice, pure devotion with longing, serene natural meditation, practicing according to teacher's words, not releasing samaya, conduct harmonious with others, respectful mind-field, following even single-word teachings, acting accordingly for self-benefit, capable of maintaining secrets, not straying from vajra meaning, relying on extensively-learned person, not transgressing self-benefit, speaking gently without arrogance, entering harmoniously with others' minds, making teacher and Tathagata equal without distinction—these are student marks, such student is Ati Dzogchen vessel. Students to avoid: without respect, misusing secret mantra, without lineage or good-nature, small wisdom, belittling kindness, boasting own lineage, adorning body with ornaments, meaningless dilution—unexamined student is teacher-enemy, not practicing person not taught Dzogchen meaning. Vessel metaphor: lion's milk cannot be held in clay vessel, nectar poured becomes corrupted, bad vessel goes to lower realms, must be kept secret from dull-minded. Risk: reifying student qualities as fixed categories rather than recognition-facilitators.

<classification> Common teacher-student practices (thun mong du bya ba'i chos): mutual contemplation establishing sacred bond. Teacher gazes with compassion (thugs rje breng nge), timely benefit, Dharma, even food-drink; student contemplates teacher's qualities with unceasing longing and devotion (breng nge brtse gdung mos gus rgyun chad med). Rang-shar citation: "compassion-connection unbroken, longing-continuity unceased—this is teacher-student relationship." Requesting teachings (gsol ba 'debs pa): Thal-gyur citation—offering kingdom, body, retinue, enjoyments, pleasing body-speech-conduct, serving teacher equal to Buddha, with faith and wisdom, confident without delusion, words without error, clear faculties serve teacher. With elaborate empowerment request and instruction-asking aspiration, not sudden entry like inviting guest—send messenger in advance. For three-five-seven years offer mandala of gold to teacher, repeatedly supplicate: "I am this age, please grant this empowerment or instruction." Practice teacher yoga at session-beginnings six times daily. Teacher grants permission: "If you request empowerment, until then remove obstacles and purify sins, meditate teacher on crown, supplicate six times daily." Purpose: body matures as deity-form, speech as ali-kali self-sound, mind as emptiness without thought. With intense aspiration for desired empowerment, signs of accomplished teacher appear in dreams—explaining Dharma, giving prophecies. Definite result: all wishes accomplished like wish-fulfilling jewel/tree, Thal-gyur citation—serving obtains immeasurable qualities like wish-fulfilling tree, jewel, cow of plenty; serve teacher to turn from samsara's battle.

<classification> Empowerment benefits (dbang bskur phan yon): special (khyad par) and common (thun mong). Special: bardo self-appearance recognized, stability attained therein, can separate Sambhogakaya in twenty-one days, excellent faculties' completion without suffering/fear/terror/impediment/obstruction, during practice wisdom-appearance non-ceasing clarity. Common: understanding dakini speech, receiving dakini blessings, seen as object of reverence, loving-kindness to all beings, beautiful form pleasant to see, merit greatly increases, after death born as cakravartin king, qualities arise like jewel, practice pure Dharma like lotus, seen as surrounded by all like stupa, overwhelms others like parasol, liberates beings with wisdom like fire-mass, capable of accomplishing aims like sword, holds beings with compassion like vajra-hook, realizes inseparable dbyings-wisdom like Dharma-cloud—108 qualities obtained. All activities accomplished, not harmed by obstacles/mara, many children and enjoyments are signs of obtaining empowerment, remembers previous lives, sees beings taking birth, knows others' minds, associates with non-humans. Faults of non-empowerment (dbang ma bskur ba'i nyes dmigs): Sgyu-phrul gsang-snying—without pleasing teacher, without obtaining empowerments, hearing etc. commenced without result, lost. Dbang rdzogs rang-byung chen-po'i rgyud—secret mantra accomplishment impossible without empowerment, like ferryman without hands cannot cross river. Rang-shar—bardo confusion, fear, terror, impediment, obstruction, loss of perception; until leaving habitual body not seen as object of reverence, little merit, short life, few enjoyments, unpleasant mouth, many obstacles, activities unaccomplished. Secret mantra practitioner must obtain empowerment; without empowerment even Buddha cannot turn Dharma-wheel at Tathagata-level; without turning wheel cannot accomplish beings' benefit through compassion-emanation body. Risk: reifying empowerment as causal transmission rather than recognition-gate.

<classification> Empowerment location and timing: secluded delightful places near siddhi—auspicious site-examination (sa dpyad), good forests etc. Specific locations: elaborate (spros bcas) in student's body-earth, south-exposed north-sheltered; water east-exposed west-sheltered; fire west-exposed east-sheltered; wind north-exposed south-sheltered. Unelaborate (spros med) in dense forests matching student's element-form and marks. Extremely unelaborate (shin tu spros med): mountain peak of three-valley confluence excellent. Completely unelaborate (rab tu spros med): extremely secluded or hermitage one league from village. Four empowerments' location: charnel ground with fearsome creatures, poisonous snakes, funeral grounds, extremely fierce dakinis excellent. Rdzogs-pa rang-byung citation: supreme empowerment not accomplished in great towns' centers; at towns' and cities' edges, forests, rocks, empty valleys yogin enters empowerment-meaning. Extremely secluded delightful site-examination: excellent characteristics—at town-edge limits, flourishing forest-ground, various flowers growing, west high east flat, north flat similar, south low similar, from self-visible direction no caves/hollows, front without form-body, without sentient-being-like form, back leaning on rock, sides various fruit-trees blazing, front river and pure water flowing, or life-sustaining place like that, mountain-ranges unbroken, various bird-calls sounding. Timing (nam gyi tshe): general when teacher grants and conditions gathered is auspicious; specifically autumn when enlightenment-fruit ripens, spring when liberation-seed planted. Monkey year excellent; 8th day of waxing moon good; star Rgyal-mchog good; Thursday excellent. Risk: practice-misread-as-ontology by treating geomancy and astrology as literal requirements rather than supportive conditions.
