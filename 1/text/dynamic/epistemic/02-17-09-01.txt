<classification> Mirror-reflection meditation (me long gi gzugs brnyan) instructions. Outer-inner phenomena difference non-existent; holding as true useless. All appearances illusion-reflection—meditate with non-distracted aspiration. Mirror practice: own form appearing in mirror; putting on clothes, ornaments, removing, throwing, praising, disparaging—form appears but meaning not established like phenomena. All saṃsāra-nirvāṇa phenomena—self-other, enemy-friend, food-clothing, enjoyment, pleasant-unpleasant, denial-affirmation, birth-death, happiness-suffering, sickness-pain—like mirror-reflections, essence non-existent from appearance-time itself. Mastering deluded-appearance as truthless illusion-nature; own body as illusion-body; bardo illusory-body held without doubt. Ljonpa-asked Sutra citation: mirror-mandala, face-reflection appearing, nature not established. Instructional provisionality using mirror-metaphor as recognition-vehicle. Risk of reifying "illusion" as new ontological category rather than recognizing essencelessness of all phenomena.
