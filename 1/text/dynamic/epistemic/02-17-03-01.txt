<classification> Four-fold conduct framework for progressive yogin: appearance-power-transform conduct, direct-placement instruction method, ground-rising intention of appearance-existence, and ground-transform affliction result. Three-fold conduct typology: non-attachment-holding (freedom from grasping), negate-affirm-absence (transcending logic), attachment-without-clinging (engagement without fixation). Pedagogical structure providing recognition-vehicles through activity—conduct as display of primordial freedom rather than ethical prescription. Risk of practicing conduct as technique rather than spontaneous expression of recognition.
