Analysis: outer, inner expanse, clouds arising and clearing, not stable—indicates that recognition sees outer and inner display simultaneously, with clouds obscuring and clearing continuously. Risk of view-collapse: treating child-like displays as meditation objects rather than recognition's natural manifestation.

Risk of view-collapse: mistaking sems-side philosophical recognition for definitive Dzogchen recognition—former is provisional understanding through reasoning, latter is direct recognition.
