[16770-16781] <five-perfected-activities>
<Fourth enumeration extensively explained: body speech mind qualities activity five: body beings whatever desired appearance, each part marks signs perfect; speech limbs sixty's sound meter connection good; mind as it is and as many knowing vast; qualities powers etc. dharmas all knowing complete; activity outer inner secret three's dharma wheel perfect five nature turn. From Spontaneous Liberation: "Emanation body also body speech mind, qualities activity five." Body marks and signs, tamed whoever arose body emanation; speech word connection good. These describe spontaneous display, not attained qualities. Risk of attribution error: treating these as qualities possessed rather than natural expression.>

[16807-16818] <five-perfected-teacher>
<Dharma perfected, nature Great Perfection, secret unsurpassed tantra essence seven, time perfected self-conditions pure time taught. Thus indicating teacher emanation body all outer inner secret perfected five five should know. Meaning two: wisdom's abode particular explanation three: essence—self-rigpa's nature elaboration free. From Spontaneous Liberation: "Concept free dharmata self-resonance from, objective-free wisdom appearance dawns." The perfected teacher is the spontaneous display, not a person. Risk of personification: attributing these qualities to an individual rather than recognizing the ground's nature.>

[16841-16852] <natural-compassion-energy>
<Beings delusion circling lower classes from, tamed and tamer not suitable, ground abiding wisdom outer appearance dawned. Samsara as long beings' benefit arises, nature energy's compassion deep clear knowing perfect from arose. From Spontaneous Liberation: "Dharmakaya empty nature from, wisdom knowing perfect part, energy beings to dawns, that not samsara nirvana classes, knowing knows and clear, self-knowing clear self-nature from, nature energy's compassion." Compassion is spontaneous energy, not willed. Risk of voluntarism: treating compassion as cultivated or chosen rather than ground's natural expression.>

[16886-16897] <ultimate-dharmata-knowing>
<Ultimate dharmata knowing empty and, marks not and, clear light dharma evident. That also from Spontaneous Liberation: "Emanation body knowing objects, as knowing entity's, mode self's benefit knows, as many tamed's, thought as abides knows, thus compassion's dawning manner, tamed's beings various, tamer body also that much." The knowing is dharmata's self-recognition, not cognition. Risk of cognitive appropriation: treating this as a form of knowledge acquisition rather than empty-clear self-recognition.>

[16923-16934] <self-knowing-three-wisdoms>
<Self-abode kadag's dharmadhatu self-knowing clear dharmadhatu pure aspect abiding. From Lamp Illuminating: "Truly perfected Buddha, wisdom aspect three: aspect all knowing, all knowing wisdom, ground abiding wisdom. Emanation body's wisdom two: as knowing mode knows, as many other benefit, sambhogakaya wisdom side's, clear light self-appearance known clear." The three wisdoms describe one self-knowing, not separate entities. Risk of enumerative substantialism: treating the three wisdoms as countable substances rather than aspects of non-dual recognition.>

[16960-16971] <five-kaya-display>
<From Lion Perfected Great Perfection Tantra: "Buddhas' body and, speech and mind mandala and, qualities activity five appearance." Second: body and, speech and, mind and, qualities and, activity five's thorough divisions. The five are classifications of one display, not five separate things. Risk of multiplicative reification: counting body, speech, mind, qualities, activity as five distinct existences rather than descriptions of non-dual ground.>
