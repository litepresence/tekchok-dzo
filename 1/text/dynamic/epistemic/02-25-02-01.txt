<classification> Lama early ones say: result not say, result three bodies attachment's extreme holding free make intended, or three circles sheath final that refute intended, contradiction removal done, meaning result place also, primordial purity's inner dharmadhatu's essence not intended transformation is, very mistaken not good. Here before accepted as path appearance also is, result also is not contradictory think, first path appearance is, spontaneous presence sheath primordial purity great that meaning result house like from, there enter and there from open ground primordial purity outer appearance dawns must. Apparent contradiction between result and non-result resolved in non-dual view. Risk of view-collapse: taking negations literally rather than as pointing to primordial completion.
