<classification> Threefold mind-gathering process: water-mind (chui sems) gathers memory-supporting basis, fire-mind (me'i sems) radiates to objects, wind-mind (rlung gi sems) moves/agitates. Mind-essence (sems nyid): unborn nature, unceasing memory, unchanging example-meaning-integrated, self-completed real-meaning—not divided anywhere. Distinction between sems (mind) and yid (intellect): sems-memory explained as above, yid-memory has six types. Tantric physiology: subtle body formation through elemental minds. Risk: reifying minds as substantial entities rather than process-descriptions.
