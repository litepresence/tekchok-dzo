<risk>reification
<classification> This passage presents foundational Dzogchen view of ground as primordially pure and spontaneously present. Terminology—wisdom expanse, dharmata, self-arisen svabhvikakaya—represents definitive meaning par excellence. Unlike sutric or tantric presentations, this operates from direct view of awareness without reliance on reasoning or transformation. Epistemic status is declarative finality: these are not instructions to follow but descriptions of ever-present reality. Longchenpa asserts ground as basis for all vehicles—the same nature underlying all vehicles. This is Dzogchen's unique contribution: not new philosophy but direct recognition of what was always the case. Fivefold analytical framework—essence, definitive terminology, divisions, characteristics, and fruition—structures the presentation while transcending it. These are pedagogical categories for the category-free ground. Essence of expanse is vast, pervading greatness, self-nature of clear self-clarity. This is not definition but pointing to what cannot be defined. Definitive terminology presents center, expanse, and dharmata as synonymous pointers to same non-dual ground. Risk of reification: treating ground as metaphysical foundation or substratum. Ground is not thing but way things are—empty yet manifest, pure yet appearing.

<classification> Passage continues with ground exposition emphasizing non-duality of ground and fruition. Terms like original ground, final liberation-place, holding seat of non-delusion assert identity of path and fruition. Epistemically, this is definitive meaning at most direct: nothing to achieve because everything already the case. Risk of nihilism: treating ground as metaphysical foundation. Ground is not thing but way things are. Ground and fruition non-dual is not identity in logical sense but recognition that what is sought is already present. Path is not traversal from here to there but recognition of what was never absent. Original ground and final liberation-place are distinguished only by knowing vs. not-knowing—not by any change in ground itself. Longchenpa uses mirror simile: mirror's nature to reflect is never changed by what appears in it. Similarly, ground's nature is pure awareness whether recognizing itself or not. Longchenpa's freedom from elaborations prevents both nihilism and eternalism. This is definitive view: not attainment but recognition, not transformation but revelation.

<classification> Fourfold division of expanse—outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed—requires careful epistemic navigation. These are not levels to traverse but simultaneous dimensions of single awareness-display. Outer as space, inner as lamp, secret as light/bindu, unsurpassed as self-liberated delusion-appearance are pedagogical unfoldings, not ontological stratification. Risk of view-collapse: treating these as stages of practice or degrees of realization. Definitive meaning is all four are ever-present: outer expanse IS unsurpassed expanse when recognized. Mapping to awareness, wisdom, three kayas, fruition-object completes non-dual integration. Expanse IS awareness, IS wisdom-display, IS three kayas, IS fruition-object. These are not attributes but expanse's self-recognition. Longchenpa's presentation prevents sequential reading: four are co-emergent, not sequential stages. Practitioner who recognizes outer expanse as space simultaneously recognizes it as unsurpassed expanse of self-liberated delusion-appearance. Distinction is pedagogical—addressing different capacities—not ontological. Definitive view sees all four as single expanse of awareness's own nature.
