<pedagogy>polemical-distinction
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Mind's abode (sems kyi gnas) vs wisdom's abode (ye shes kyi gnas)—crucial Dzogchen distinction. Kuntu Zangpo Klong drug pa citation: all-ground (kun gzhi) as gatherer of all objects of thought, Dharmakaya as without memory-thought, without subject-object holding consciousness. Distinction establishes basis for differentiating delusion from recognition. Risk: collapsing kun gzhi into chos sku or vice versa.

<classification> Philosophical systems conflating kun gzhi and chos sku—Abhidharma tenet that kun gzhi is basis of all pure and impure; some tantras asserting kun gzhi transforms into wisdom Dharmadhatu. Refutation: if kun gzhi were chos sku, chos sku would be defiled; kun gzhi produces container-contents illusion, implying chos sku produces illusion. Logical absurdity: Buddhas could re-delude into sentient beings. Sutric-provisional view properly distinguished from Dzogchen definitive.

<pedagogy>negational-clearing
<classification> Scriptural authority for distinction: Kuntu Zangpo Thug kyi me long—"Those considering kun gzhi as chos sku have deviated from me." Rigpa Rang shar: defining characteristics of kun gzhi refute identity with chos ku. Dialogue format: if kun gzhi basis of all completeness, then sentient beings could become Buddhas; if manifold appearance, then Buddhas could become sentient beings. Negational clearing of substantial identity.

<classification> Ocean-boat metaphor: Dharmakaya as clear ocean without defilement, all-ground as boat resting on ocean. Primordially pure rigpa as never defiled dharmadhatu, unobstructed appearing anywhere yet without establishment. Ka-dag with twofold purity: primordial purity of essence, separation from adventitious conditions. All-ground like boat not entering ocean—when delusion from primordial expanse, basis-ignorance as support, pervader, abiding entity.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Rigpa without defilement as Dharmakaya essence never object of abandonment, final liberation basis always present. All-ground like sleep, support for all delusion-appearance dreams, must be awakened. Crucial distinction: sleep and dream must cease but self-rigpa need not cease. Dharmakaya basis for recognition, familiarization with its state, fruition liberation destination. All-ground and dependent dharmas to be purified as defilement.

<classification> Eightfold analysis of all-ground from Thalgyur: essence, etymology, divisions, term application. Essence: container of conditioned phenomena, virtues, samsara dharmas with imprints. Etymology: "all" (kun) for manifold, "ground" (gzhi) for gathering place or support. Four divisions: basis of ultimate purpose, basis of connection purpose, basis of body imprints, basis of manifold imprints. Functions: delusion-basis, body-mind connection causing pleasure-pain, body conditions aggregates, imprints cause karma and afflictions.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Dharmakaya exposition from Thalgyur: beyond elaboration, without self-grasping marks, essence emptiness-clarity inseparable, divisions into three kayas. Etymology: chos as true path, sku as accomplishment from that. Definitive assertion of Dharmakaya as transcendence of all-ground framework—not transformation of kun gzhi but recognition of what was never deluded.
