[15275-15286] <bardo-recognition-practice>
<Senses final final or that above dharmata's bardo dawned but truth's power not obtained, existence's bardo dream-like path arose time, "I died" thinking, recognized. Existence intermediate existence dreamed, remembered. Lama remembered, that instruction remembered, now natural emanation's field going should—thinking merely, previous dharmata truth's blessings and, existence intermediate existence self-power not grasping's stain not, existence's future continuing latency exhausted, that field lotus miraculously moment born, breathed. Sun-moon union from, birth abode subsequently remembered, senses final natural emanation body's field three breathed. The instructions for bardo recognition are expedient means for those who have not recognized primordially. Risk: treating these as ontological descriptions of after-death states rather than skillful means for present recognition.>

[15311-15322] <natural-emanation-breathing>
<Hundred paths intermediate existence path arose also existence intermediate existence face found certain. That time field remembered merely dharmata's blessings birth is, instruction other hidden nothing. Then natural emanation breathing manner: natural two—abiding natural and counted natural. Abiding: primordially this path appearance dwells, ground-appearance spontaneous presence gate's sambhogakaya's four directions appearance. Fields ten center charnel ground fire mountain blazing eleven exist, but here liberation great breathing five recognized. The natural emanation is not a place to go but recognition of what already is. Risk of spatialization: treating fields and directions as actual locations rather than metaphorical pointers.>

[15344-15358] <pure-realm-descriptions>
<Retinue miraculously born bodhisattvas boys and girls also color yellow. Ground all jewels gold composed. Qualities immeasurable possessing. West lotus stacked, teacher Infinite Light, retinue bodhisattvas miraculously born appearance all color red. Emanation birds and deer and horses and elephants etc. all very red radiance possessing. North Las-rab-rdzogs-pa's field, teacher Don-yod-grub-pa, retinue immeasurable surrounding, emanation creatures with all green shine. Ground all jewel lapis lazuli nature. All those center front sky Jambudvipa stacked, charnel ground fire mountain blazing called, emanation wrathful field exists. There this dharma profound gate seeing merely, senses final each own family breathed. Then years five hundred, intermediate existence without Buddha only obtained. These from Ati Kodpa Chenpo: Degenerate five hundred time's end, secret essence this human land appears. The pure realm descriptions are instructional, pointing to the nature of mind rather than literal locations. Risk: reifying these as actual geographical places rather than metaphorical expressions of recognition.>

[15376-15390] <spontaneous-bodily-perfection>
<Smell fragrant gentle satisfying not enough, senses' satisfaction qualities all possessing. Color body complete food clothes time one complete. Body's effort-free wind moved going and abiding. Wind bile phlegm gathering diseases not. Limbs eight possessing taste hundred gathering water, drunk satisfying knowing, body also soft. Earth water fire wind elements benefit harm free. Hunger and thirst hot cold suffering dispelled. Desire hatred delusion afflictions, birth's cause not, consciousness spacious. Looking joking hand holding embracing desire free. Satisfaction desire-free always dharma listening. Two obscurations free, birth one only takes. Offering goddesses mind-pleasing auspicious say. The spontaneously perfected body in pure realms has no material limitations. Risk of materialism: mistaking these descriptions as literal physical perfection rather than the freedom from fixation they represent.>

[15414-15428] <pure-realm-architecture>
<Jewel horse-hoof possessing, ground all jewel crystal composed, very mind-pleasing, looking beautiful, stairs and window possessing. Four directions great skylights existing, skylights from sun dawns, jewel crystal composed struck, inside day five lights' appearance freely dawns. Measureless palace outer rim, eight limbs possessing water moat existing, that water disease struck drank, disease healed. Outer rim eight pools existing, those inside also bird sounds pleasant various. The architectural descriptions of pure realms serve as meditation supports, not literal construction plans. Risk: reifying these architectural details as ontological realities rather than skillful means for concentration.>

[15459-15473] <spontaneous-fulfillment>
<Years five hundred fifty sustained. Field that hunger and thirst mind remember merely satisfied. There anxiety not, supreme bliss. Birth existence also water eight limbs possessing drank, dispelled. Flowers various emanation body that offering great do. Palace four corners pearl composed stupas four exist, those four between bell silver net thread connecting. Thread wind moved, bell sounds mind-pleasing various arise. Four directions flags various banners four exist, wind moved fragrance pleasant various arise. Palace this from east direction five hundred yojanas passed above exists. There born bodhisattvas those thirty-three gods and enjoyment equal. East direction emanation body field that likewise exists. The spontaneous fulfillment in pure realms is not hedonistic pleasure but freedom from craving. Risk of hedonism: mistaking these descriptions as endorsing sensory indulgence rather than recognizing craving's cessation.>

[15488-15502] <gemstone-symbolism>
<Jewel variously arranged called exists, there also emanation body Don-yod-grub-pa called field that, palace qualities thus exist: jewel indranila composed house four corners possessing exists, also four directions great skylights four exist, therefrom sun dawned light green inside fills. Ground all also indranila composed. Outer rim water eight limbs possessing, water also touch bliss, drink disease all dispelled exists. Outer rim seven pools exist, inside bird sounds pleasant various forms dwell, also thus: bird king swan gold-possessing, dark-rounded. The gemstone symbolism (indranila, crystal) points to the nature of mind, not literal minerals. Risk of materialism: interpreting these as descriptions of actual wealth rather than metaphorical expressions of clarity and purity.>

[15531-15545] <liberation-in-one-birth>
<There abiding bodhisattvas birth one only takes. Years thousand sustained. Field that food and drink mind remember merely satisfied. Then phlegm arisen and, wind arisen and, bile arisen and, gathering arisen disease not. Flowers various emanation body that offering extensively do. Bodhisattvas those color green. Horses and mounts and green. Boys and girls' forms appearance. All also mind's conceptualization not. Field that beings three types not. Six consciousnesses not. Six afflictions not. The attainment in one birth is definitive—not gradual development. Risk of temporalization: treating "one birth" as literal temporal duration rather than instantaneous recognition.>

[15563-15577] <wrathful-mandala-architecture>
<Great charnel ground Ye-ri blazing called this exists, also palace thus exists: skull house four stories possessing exists, also thus: dry skulls fruit made, flesh and blood walls made, bandha Tushita tongue made, width and height immeasurable, sky-iron lightning struck, blood rain falls, sun-moon seat made, crocodile mouth bridge made, eight great gods pillars adorned, great supreme lintel exists. Day wind whistles. The wrathful architecture uses tantric symbolism (skulls, blood, charnel ground) which is instructional, not literal. Risk of tantric literalism: mistaking these symbols for actual practices or places rather than recognition of impurities' purity.>

[15605-15618] <natural-emanation-ground>
<There frightened blocked emanation body field born. These also Bhagavan Vajradhara's blessings from, nature arranged, therefore natural emanation field called. Fields those continuities: heart like mirror etc., wisdom jewel self-clear self-resonance and, skull house wrathful mandala primordially abiding appearance arose. Retinue appearance and, senses final seeing able cause and, liberation certain cause also that is, should know. CITATION: From Treasury Supreme Vehicle, senses final natural emanation body field breathing, chapter twenty-fourth. Thus secret supreme certainty key point liberated ground and path's sequence extensively explained, now that means where accomplished completion result's sequence certainly two: inner dharmadhatu kadag ground enlightenment manner generally shown, spontaneous presence clear light's dawning ground body and wisdom's appearance manner particularly explained. First three. The natural emanation is the ground's spontaneous display, not exclusive to any lineage. Risk of lineage exclusivism: claiming these teachings belong only to Dzogchen rather than recognizing them as pointing to universal nature.>
