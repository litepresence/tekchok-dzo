<classification> Senses final final or that above dharmata's bardo dawned but truth's power not obtained, existence's bardo dream-like path arose time, I died thinking, recognized. Existence intermediate existence dreamed, remembered. Lama remembered, that instruction remembered, now natural emanation's field going should—thinking merely, previous dharmata truth's blessings and, existence intermediate existence self-power not grasping's stain not, existence's future continuing latency exhausted, that field lotus miraculously moment born, breathed. Sun-moon union from, birth abode subsequently remembered, senses final natural emanation body's field three breathed. Instructions for bardo recognition are expedient means for those who have not recognized primordially. Risk of reification: treating these as ontological descriptions of after-death states rather than skillful means for present recognition.

<classification> Hundred paths intermediate existence path arose also existence intermediate existence face found certain. That time field remembered merely dharmata's blessings birth is, instruction other hidden nothing. Then natural emanation breathing manner: natural two—abiding natural and counted natural. Abiding: primordially this path appearance dwells, ground-appearance spontaneous presence gate's sambhogakaya's four directions appearance. Fields ten center charnel ground fire mountain blazing eleven exist, but here liberation great breathing five recognized. Natural emanation is not place to go but recognition of what already is. Risk of view-collapse: treating fields and directions as actual locations rather than metaphorical pointers.

These from Ati Kodpa Chenpo: Degenerate five hundred time's end, secret essence this human land appears. Pure realm descriptions are instructional, pointing to nature of mind rather than literal locations. Risk of reification: treating as actual geographical places rather than metaphorical expressions of recognition.

<classification> Spontaneous bodily perfection continues. Final recognition is not achievement but revelation of what was always present. All descriptions are provisional—recognition itself is timeless. Risk of nihilism: interpreting descriptions as denial of conventional reality.
