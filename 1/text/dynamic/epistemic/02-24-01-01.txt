<classification> Lowest faculties practitioner—dharmata bardo dawned but truth-power not obtained. Becoming bardo arises dreamlike; recognition "I have died" occurs. Remembering becoming bardo wavering, lama and instruction remembered, going to natural emanation field merely thought. Previous dharmata truth blessings and becoming bardo self-grasping stain absent, future samsara continuing latency exhausted. Born miraculously from lotus in that field, breathed. Sun Moon Union citation: birth abode subsequently remembered, lowest faculties natural emanation body fields three breathed. Risk: reifying fields as actual destinations rather than recognition-symbols.

<classification> Preliminary instructions: daytime self-appearance direct familiarization, nighttime five lights familiarized in heart, sleeping in view of emanation field. Session transference power-training. Wisdom consciousness mounted on wind-vehicle projected from heart or eyes to Buddha's heart in emanation field. Becoming bardo ravine crossed, migrating city to city without obstacles. Death moment consciousness projected before wind goes far and doesn't return—HIG transference.

<classification> Some born in pure fields immediately through this practice; hundred paths becoming bardo path arose but becoming bardo certainly recognized. That time field remembered merely through dharmata blessings is birth—no other hidden instruction. Natural emanation breathing method: two naturals—abiding natural and counted natural. Abiding: primordially this path-appearance dwells, ground-appearance spontaneous presence gate Sambhogakaya four directions appear. Ten fields center charnel ground fire mountain blazing eleven exist, here five great liberation breathings recognized. Counted: perfection paramitas eleven Kuntu Od fields. Risk: confusing abiding and counted as different ontological categories.

<classification> Here Buddha's speech heard but own bodhisattvas obscured by cognitive obscurations, bodies not seen. When their bodies seen, cognitive obscurations exhausted, become Buddhas. Some call this merit-accumulation Dharmakaya. Klong drug pa citation: merit-accumulation Dharmakaya and omniscient wisdom—similar yet distinct like "ra ra" jewels. Emanation definition: four fields center and five are Buddha five-family emanation fields. East Abhirati field, teacher Akshobhya, retinue bodhisattvas miraculously born boys and girls white-colored. Risk: literalizing directional fields as geographical locations.

<classification> South Glory-Possessing field, teacher Ratnasambhava, retinue miraculously born boys and girls yellow, ground all gold. West Lotus-Stacked, teacher Amitabha, retinue miraculously born all red, emanation creatures all very red radiance. North Las-rab-rdzogs-pa, teacher Amoghasiddha, retinue immeasurable, emanation creatures all green shine, ground lapis lazuli. Center-front sky Jambudvipa stacked charnel ground fire mountain blazing—emanation wrathful field exists. Here this Dharma profound gate seen merely, lowest faculties each own family breathed. Then five hundred years, becoming bardo without Buddha only obtained. Ati Kodpa Chenpo citation: degenerate five hundred time's end, secret essence this human land appears. Risk: literalizing color-field correspondences as physical realities.
