<risk>reification
<classification> Rainbow body as ultimate fruition—complete dissolution of material body into light at death. Natural result of complete recognition, not miraculous achievement. Material body as condensation of subtle elements appearing due to delusion. Risk of fixating on rainbow body as goal rather than natural expression.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Direct introduction as essence of Dzogchen—master's pointing and disciple's recognition of nature of mind. Not explanation or transmission of power but pointing to what has always been present. Bypasses conceptual understanding and gradual preparation. Definitive direct pointing to rig pa.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Direct introduction revealing three aspects of natural state: essence as emptiness, nature as clarity, compassionate energy as unobstructed manifestation. Not taught conceptually but recognized directly. Definitive recognition beyond instruction.

<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Prerequisites for direct introduction—stable mind, purified obscurations, devotion to master. Without these, introduction may not take hold. Dzogchen not requiring extensive intellectual study but requiring receptive capacity. Instructional provisionality of preparation framework.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> While conventionally speaking of master and disciple, pointing and recognition, ultimately no separation. Master's pointing as display of awareness; disciple's recognition as awareness recognizing itself. Definitive non-duality of introduction.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Direct introduction as cornerstone of Dzogchen practice—moment when nature of mind directly recognized, setting stage for all subsequent meditation and conduct. Definitive finality of recognition-moment.
