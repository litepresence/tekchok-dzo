Samsara without name ('khor ba ming med): Thalgyur citation—rang yul bstan pa las (from showing own domain), 'khor rkyen 'jug pa ma yin par (not entering through dependent origination). Zang ma nyid dang thal byung du (spontaneous and uncaused). Yul dang shes pa'i snang cha las (from object-consciousness display). Thad ka so so'i gzhi las grol (liberated from separate individual bases). Definitive assertion: samsara as mere naming-convention (ming tsam), not substantial existence. Primordial liberation (ye grol) view—samsara never existed as real, only appears through confusion. Risk: nihilistic misreading as denial of conventional appearance rather than recognition of empty display.

First pith: Superiority of light-liberation ('od du grol) over trekcho ('khregs chod). Trekcho liberates from rdul phran cha med (dust-atoms without parts) but 'od du 'gro mi srid (cannot journey into light). Without 'od du ma song na (if not gone to light), rdo rje'i lus mi grub (vajra body not established). Res 'ga' ba'i sgyu lus kyis (temporary illusion body cannot) mthar thug gis mi chod pa (cut finality). 'Od lus ma thob na (if light-body not obtained), 'pho ba chen po'i sku mi thob (great transference body not obtained). Other-benefit major capacity not established. Polemical distinction: trekcho alone insufficient for complete Buddhahood. Risk: view-collapse if trekcho dismissed as useless; both necessary for complete path.

Second pith: Rigpa primordially light-luminous (ye nas 'od gsal). Trekcho measures stong par 'jal ba (measures emptiness) without rang 'od mi mthong ba (not seeing self-light). Thod rgal gyis gnad gchun pas (thogal crucial-point pressing) brings chos nyid ngo bo'i 'od gsal (dharmata essence luminosity) nang du zin (into internal capture). Chos can rang gdangs kyi 'od gsal (dharmata's own radiance luminosity) phyi snang ba (outer appearance) lag len la bstan (shown in practical experience). Superiority of direct experience over inferential certainty. Rang shar citation: rang snang rig pa'i rgyal po 'di (this king of self-appearing rigpa), kun la yod de rtogs pa med (exists in all, unrecognized). Declaration: inherent luminosity obscured by conceptual investigation (rtog pas). Risk: reifying "light" as visual phenomenon rather than awareness-display.

Third pith: Rigpa'i ye shes (rigpa wisdom) in trekcho—bstar med kyi rgyas bkhab nas (covered by invisible armor), mthong du med pa (not seeable). Thag gcig tu thag gchod pa (decided with certainty). Thod rgal du ye shes kyi mthongs phyed pas (thogal opens wisdom-vision). Chos nyid kyi nyi zer gsal ba (dharmata sun-rays clear). Thalgyur citation: chos nyid mngon sum snang ba yis (dharmata direct appearance), yid dpyod 'dzin pa'i lta ba bsnumbs (destroys conceptual view-holding). Distinction: trekcho thag gchod (certainty-judgment) vs thogal mngon sum (direct seeing). Certainty-about vs direct-vision. Risk: reifying "wisdom-vision" as visual experience rather than recognition-clarity.

Fourth pith: Trekcho depends on rags pa'i rtsa rlung (coarse channels-winds). Thod rgal enters 'od rtsa dwangs pa (clear light channels) through sgron ma dngos lam du byed pa (direct application of lamps). De nyid las citation: rtsa dang 'khrul 'khor gyis (channels and illusory body), rang bzhin snang ba'i ye shes lnga (five nature wisdoms). Chu bur mig gis mthong ba'o (seen by eye like water bubbles). Physiological shift: coarse body (phung po) to subtle body (sgyu lus) to light body ('od lus). Direct application superior to manipulation.

Fifth pith: Trekcho—dbang po drug gi sgo ma dag pa (six sense-faculties not purified). Sems kyi chos la dwangs 'tshol ba (consciousness investigates dharmata). Thod rgal—dag pa 'od gsal gyi sgo (clear light gate) opened by ye shes kyi rlung (wisdom-wind). Sgron ma bzhi'i snang ba 'char (four lamp appearances arise). Superiority: spontaneous arising vs investigation. De nyid las citation: sgo nas ji ltar 'byung ba ni (how gateways emerge), 'jug pa'i rlung gis bskul ba yis (impelled by entering wind). Sgron ma bzhi las las bzhir byung (four activities arise from four lamps). Gate as opening (potential) vs gate as limitation (restriction).

Sixth pith: Trekcho—bstar med rig pa rang gdangs kyi dbang po (invisible rigpa self-radiance faculty). Dwangs 'tshol ba (seeking clarity). Thod rgal—phyi nang ye shes zang thal gyi dbang po (outer-inner wisdom unobstructed faculty). Dbyings dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa'i snang ba (inseparability of expanse-wisdom appearance). Dngos su dpyod pa (directly examining). Superiority: direct perception vs inferential search. Thalgyur citation: dag pa dbyings kyi sgron ma la (pure dharmadhatu lamp), thig le sku dang 'khrul snang dag (thigle body and illusion-appearance). Rang bzhin nyid dang ngo bo nyid (nature and essence), gnyis med 'du 'bral med par snang (non-dual inseparable appearance). Risk: reifying perception as dualistic seeing rather than non-dual recognition.

Seventh pith: Trekcho—bzhed 'dod med par ma grol (not liberated without acceptance-rejection). 'Khrul pa rim gyis zad (illusion gradually exhausted). Thod rgal—cig car grol ba (instant liberation). Phyi nang sgrib snang sgrib 'dzin (outer-inner illusion-appearance-illusion-holder). Rten med ye shes 'phel (non-dependent wisdom increase) like zla ba yar ngo 'phel (waxing moon). Bzhi snang tshad du phyin (four appearances reaching measure). Myur ba grol (swift liberation). Rang shar citation: snang ba'i tshul ni sgrib pa min (appearance mode is not illusion), rgyu rkyen dag pa'i rang bzhin (cause-condition pure nature). Yang dag dang ni yang dag min (real and unreal), phung po lnga yul dag pa'o (five sense-objects pure). Temporal comparison—thogal faster—but risk of temporalizing timeless recognition into linear progress.

Beyond seven piths: Trekcho and thod rgal not separate practices but two aspects (cha gnyis) of single recognition. Trekcho as ka dag (primordial purity) aspect—emptiness, freedom from extremes. Thod rgal as lhun grub (spontaneous presence) aspect—clarity, spontaneous display. Both equally necessary, neither sufficient alone. Dzogchen complete when both recognized simultaneously. Risk: view-collapse if thod rgal reified as "advanced" practice while trekcho dismissed as "beginner."

Light-body completion ('od lus rdzogs pa): Trekcho liberates into dharmakaya. Thod rgal manifests sambhogakaya (light-body) and nirmanakaya ('pho ba chen po). Three kayas not sequential achievements but simultaneous aspects of single recognition. 'Od lus as 'od gsal rgyun (clear light continuum) made manifest, not created. Definitive assertion: three kayas primordially complete (ye nas rdzogs), recognition makes them apparent. Risk: reifying light-body as physical transformation or visual attainment.

Practical application: Seven piths as contemplation framework for those distinguishing trekcho/thod rgal. Not intellectual exercise but recognition-support. For direct recognition capacity, seven piths spontaneously resolved without analysis. Instructional provisionality of comparative analysis. Risk: practicing "analysis of seven piths" as meditation technique; converting recognition into conceptual comparison.

Definitive meaning beyond piths: No trekcho, no thod rgal—only rig pa'i rang gdangs (awareness self-radiance). Labels useful for teaching, dissolved in recognition. Definitive assertion: complete liberation (rdzogs grol) without distinction of methods. All methods dissolve in awareness' own face.

Synthesis: Seven piths demonstrate thod rgal superiority for complete manifestation (rdzogs pa) while acknowledging trekcho necessity for stability (brtan pa). Complete buddhahood requires both stability and manifestation. Trekcho without thod rgal: stable but incomplete. Thod rgal without trekcho: manifest but unstable. Definitive meaning: both recognized as single awareness-display. Risk: nihilistic interpretation as "no need for either practice."

Dzogchen polemics: Distinction from lower vehicles explicit but not denigrating. Lower vehicles as rnam grangs (provisional), Dzogchen as nges don (definitive). Yet even Dzogchen distinctions (trekcho/thod rgal) dissolve in definitive recognition. Polemical distinction not establishing hierarchy but clarifying recognition-approach. Final view: no distinctions, no non-distinctions.

Tantric interface: Seven piths utilize tantric vocabulary (vajra body, light channels, wisdom winds) while transcending tantric framework. Tantric physiology as metaphor for recognition, not literal transformation. Four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) as tantric-Dzogchen bridge. Instructional provisionality of technical terminology.

Beyond tantra: Seven piths point beyond tantric transformation to direct recognition. Trekcho cuts through tantric visualization (bskyed rim). Thod rgal completes without tantric perfection stage (rdzogs rim). Definitive meaning: recognition transcends all tantric methodology while honoring its provisional necessity.

Final declaration: All seven piths resolve into single recognition—rig pa rang grol (self-liberated awareness). No trekcho to practice, no thod rgal to achieve. Primordially complete Buddhahood recognized as always already the case. Definitive meaning of Dzogchen: complete perfection beyond all distinctions. Risk: premature transcendence without recognition; or clinging to distinctions as necessary.

Hermeneutical note: Seven piths as example of Dzogchen pedagogy—comparative analysis leading to transcendent recognition. Structure: (1) establish problem (trekcho insufficient), (2) present solution (thod rgal superior), (3) demonstrate through seven points, (4) dissolve distinction in recognition. Instructional provisionality of all analytical frameworks.

Ultimate view: Seven piths as seven fingers pointing to single moon—recognition. Not accumulation of seven understandings but single recognition dissolving all seven. Trekcho=thod rgal=recognition. Definitive meaning: one pith, no piths, complete liberation.
