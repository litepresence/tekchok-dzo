<classification> Samsara without name ('khor ba ming med) establishes primordial liberation view. Citation from Thalgyur: self-domain display, not dependent origination; spontaneous self-arising, not fabricated; liberation from separate bases of subject-object appearance. Definitive assertion that samsara is naming-convention, not substantial existence. Risk of nihilism: misreading as denial of conventional appearance rather than recognition of empty display.

<classification> Superiority of light-liberation ('od du grol) over trekcho liberation from aggregates. Trekcho liberates from dust-atoms but cannot journey into light. Without light-transformation, vajra-body not established; temporary illusion-body cannot cut finality; great transference body not obtained. Seven piths distinguishing direct-crossing from direct-cutting. Polemical distinction within Dzogchen: trekcho alone insufficient for complete Buddhahood with major benefit-capacity.

<classification> Rigpa primordially light-luminous (ye nas 'od gsal)—trekcho measures emptiness without seeing self-light. Thogal crucial-point pressing ('g nad gchun) brings dharmata essence luminosity into experience. Chos can rang gdangs kyi 'od gsal: dharmata's own radiance appears outwardly. Rang shar citation: "King of self-appearing rigpa—exists in all, unrecognized." Declaration of inherent luminosity obscured by conceptual investigation.

<classification> Wisdom-eye in trekcho: covered by certainty-judgment (thag gchod), not seen. Thogal opens wisdom-vision, dharmata sun-rays appear. Thalgyur citation: "Dharmata direct appearance destroys conceptual view-holding." Distinction between certainty-about and direct-seeing. Risk: reifying vision as external phenomenon rather than recognition-display.

<classification> Trekcho depends on coarse channels-winds; thogal enters clear light channels through lamp direct-application. Rang shar citation: "Channels and illusory body display five nature wisdoms; water bubbles seen by eye." Physiological shift from coarse to subtle body basis. Direct application of four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) as superior to channel-wind manipulation.

<classification> Six gateways in trekcho: not purified, consciousness investigates dharmata. Thogal: wisdom-wind opens clear light gateway, four lamp appearances arise. Superiority through spontaneous arising vs investigation. Rang shar citation: "Gateway emergence through entering wind; four lamps give rise to four activities." Gate as opening vs gate as limitation.

<classification> Trekcho: invisible rigpa investigates clear sense-faculties. Thogal: outer-inner wisdom zang thal sense-faculties directly perceive dharmadhatu-wisdom inseparability. Thalgyur citation: "Pure dharmadhatu lamp—thigle body and illusory appearance, nature and essence, non-dual inseparable appearance." Direct perception vs inferential certainty. Risk: reifying perception as dualistic seeing.

<risk>temporalization
<classification> Trekcho: accepts-rejects without liberation, gradual dissolving of illusion. Thogal: instant self-liberation of outer-inner illusion-appearance-illusion-holder, non-dependent wisdom increase like waxing moon. Four appearances reaching measure, swift liberation. Rang shar citation: "Appearance mode is not illusion; cause-condition pure nature; real and unreal self-pure; five sense-objects pure." Temporal comparison—thogal faster—but risk of temporalizing timeless recognition.
