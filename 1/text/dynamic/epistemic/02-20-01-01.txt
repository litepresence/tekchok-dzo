<classification> This passage presents outer tantra vehicles—Kriya, Yoga, Yoga—as provisional meaning within tantric framework. Emphasis on purity visualization, ritual cleanliness, deity-yoga with separation characterizes these vehicles as transformative rather than recognitive. Epistemic function is upaya: gradually elevating practitioners from sutric causality to tantric result. Outer tantras maintain dualistic structure—pure/impure, deity/practitioner, ritual object/subject—while training in transformation. This is provisional meaning in Dzogchen context: necessary preparation for non-dual view of inner tantras. Transformative view operates through substitution: ordinary perception is deliberately replaced by pure perception. Practitioner visualizes themselves as deity, environment as pure land, activities as enlightened conduct. This is not yet recognition of primordial purity but progressive familiarization with purity. Longchenpa's doxography positions outer tantras as action oriented, conduct oriented, and union oriented. Each represents progressive relaxation of dualism while maintaining methodical structure. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: mistaking external purity for internal realization, or believing ritual correctness alone produces liberation.

<classification> Integration of outer tantra with Dzogchen terminology marks Longchenpa's hermeneutical elevation of tantric content. Terms like self-liberated, primordially liberated, abiding nature bridge tantric completion stage toward Dzogchen recognition. However, epistemic status remains instructional provisionality: outer tantra practices described are methods, not final view. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: practitioners may mistake ritual purity and deity visualization for ultimate reality, failing to recognize these as skillful means. Longchenpa's doxography positions outer tantras as preparatory for completion stage and Dzogchen recognition. Subtle shift from transformative to recognitive view occurs through key terminology changes. Self-liberated implies impurity liberates itself without intervention—Dzogchen principle foreign to outer tantra's deliberate purification. Primordially liberated asserts liberation was never necessary—directly contradicting outer tantra's gradual path. Abiding nature refers to ever-present condition rather than achieved state. These terms function as bridging concepts appearing within tantric context but carrying Dzogchen meaning. Longchenpa's skill: elevating tantric vocabulary toward definitive view while maintaining pedagogical accessibility.

<classification> Passage culminates in Dzogchen terminology integrating tantric practice: meaning of self-liberation, abiding nature of primordial liberation, intent of self-liberation. These represent definitive meaning of tantra—recognition that purification was never necessary because primordial purity is ever-present. However, within Dzogchen hermeneutics this remains provisional because operating through tantric methodology. Epistemic distinction: outer tantras achieve transformation, inner tantras achieve spontaneous presence, Dzogchen achieves primordial purity—three degrees of same nature with different modes of seeing. Same nature principle is crucial: all nine vehicles point to same ground but approach through different capacities and methods. This prevents hierarchical elitism: Dzogchen is not better but more direct—suitable for those with sharp faculties. Outer tantra remains valid and necessary for those requiring gradual approach. Definitive view recognizes all vehicles are expedient means for liberation and none are ultimate in themselves. This is dzogchen view beyond vehicles: not rejecting lower vehicles but recognizing their provisional status from perspective of ground that transcends all vehicles.
