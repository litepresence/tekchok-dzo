<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<risk>reification
<classification> First crucial point: decisive view (thag bcad pa). Recognition that self-arisen rigpa's empty-clear zang thal is primordially pure ka-dag—final liberation place (cher mthong) pointing to essential nature beyond light appearance. Definitive assertion: view is decisive recognition, not intellectual position. Risk: reifying ka-dag as object of recognition rather than self-recognition nature.

<classification> Second crucial point: meditation as non-meditation (bsgom pa). Within that nature, unfabricated self-liberated samadhi through decisive non-wandering, non-grasping. Instructional provisionality: "meditation" as label for non-meditative recognition. Risk: practice-misread-as-ontology—treating non-meditation as technique to perform.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Third crucial point: confidence in self-liberation (grol sa). At that time, rigpa zang thal arisen beyond meditation-object/subject, liberated without abandoning good/bad conceptual constructs. Definitive assertion: confidence (yid ches) in self-liberation as recognition-result. Three crucial points complete—secret heart essence, extremely secret, sealed for heart-sons only.

<risk>elitism
<classification> Compassion crucial point: when outward radiating rigpa for manifold objects arises, without cutting radiating-aftermath, without examining self-face, without suppressing inwardly, directly recognize zang thal instantly decisive. Instructional provisionality: thugs rje as recognition-display, not emotional state. Secrecy instruction: these instructions self-found in vajra-place of tantra—cannot be understood through teaching alone. Risk: elitism—creating hierarchy of "entrusted" vs "uninitiated."

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Thalgyur citation integration: dharmata essence established from self-nature; appearance-mode undetermined therefore entry-paths differ. Through view, recognition, liberation-seeing—entering, seeing, familiarizing—self-face from recognition, confidence as heart-ground. Definitive assertion: three aspects (ngo, shes, grol) complete essence, causes cease. Naming conventions provisional—appearances designated but empty, emptiness not established anywhere, self-nature pure appearance.

<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Three-times crucial point instruction: entering-recognition crucial point, liberation-self-face crucial point, completion-recognition crucial point. Instructional framework for temporal recognition-stages: entering external clear light as self-display, recognizing rang sa ka-dag; four wisdoms conjunction liberating external-internal-secret through self-face recognition. Risk: view-collapse—treating temporal progression as linear causation rather than spontaneous recognition.
