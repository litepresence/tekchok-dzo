Chapter 12 introduction: Three main topics (gsum) for channels (rtsa) and winds (rlung) presentation—nature of channels general presentation (rtsa'i rang bzhin spyir bstan pa), specific classifications (rnam grangs bye brag tu bshad pa), application method (nyams su blang tshul bstan pa). Framed within tantric completion stage (rdzogs rim) methodology, not Dzogchen atiyoga direct introduction.

Mu tig phreng ba citation establishing authoritative source for channel theory. Three main channels (rtsa'i gtsa mo gsum) introduced: roma (ro ma), kyangma (rkyang ma), kundarma (kun 'dar ma). Roma etymology: "ro" (taste/experience) from tasting all tastes (kun gyi ro len pa) like salt water (lan tshwa); generating uncommon bliss experience based on bindu (thig le'i bde ba). "Ma" (mother) from desire-attachment cause (rgyu 'dod chags), establishing tantric transformational logic where afflictions become path. Alternative etymology: ro as few actions (bya byed nyung ba), bindu movement experience hard to express. Conventional bindu (kun rdzob kyi thig le) moves inside, method nature (thabs kyi rang bzhin). Risk: reifying roma as anatomical tube rather than energetic pathway for bindu and wind movement.

Kyangma (rkyang ma) explanation: "Without crookedness or branches ('khyog dang yal ga med pas)" called "straight tube" (rkyang pa reng bu). From both ultimate bindu (don dam pa'i thig le) and conventional bindu (kun rdzob kyi thig le) causes, ultimate arising (don dam pa'i 'byung ba) and conventional arising (kun rdzob kyi 'byung ba) ripen and separate. Being straight, unchanging (mi 'gyur ba). Being all ground (kun gyi gzhi), called "mo" (female). Depending on this, effortless buddhahood. Central channel serves as ground for all manifestations, connecting ultimate and conventional dimensions.

Kundarma (kun 'dar ma): "All gathering" (kun 'dus pa)—depending on this bindu, channel bliss, wind bliss all arise. Pervading generally (spyi la khyab pas), called "'dar ma" (pervasive). Detailed pathway descriptions: Roma from navel left coiling, moving right. Kyangma from heart tip left emerging, from throat channel net emerging, from skull inside entering, left eye door opening. Roma from right eye. Kundarma center straight abiding, three tips diverging, middle door crown Brahma hole (tshangs pa'i bu ga) making appear, then rigpa thought-free body appears. Right tip right ear appearing, karma wind moves, fine branches two nose holes penetrating. Left ear one tip penetrating, wisdom wind making appear. Left channel natural bindu (rang bzhin gyi thig le), right conventional bindu (kun rdzob kyi thig le). Four subtle knots (mdud mo) at navel, memory, tastes, tip.

Four subtle knots (mdud mo) detailed: First—navel, generating cause (rgyus skyed byed), father's white bindu (pha'i rgyu thig le dkar po) size of mustard seed (yungs 'bru). Memory (dran pa)—mother's red bindu (ma'i rkyen thig le dmar po). Tastes (ro rnams)—wind bindu (rlung gi thig le) discerning pure/impure. Tip (rtse mo)—mind nature light bindu (sems kyi rang bzhin 'od kyi thig le). All conventional supports (kun rdzob kyi rten). When moved, body and mind separate. Roma's four knots generate: water lamp seed (rgyang zhag chu'i sgron ma'i sa bon), fire bindu of self-arisen wisdom lamp (shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma'i rten me'i thig le), five lights bindu of pure dimension (dbyings rnam dag gi rten 'od lnga'i thig le), empty bindu with light (thig le stong pa'i rten 'od kyi thig le). Risk: interpreting these as literal anatomical structures rather than subtle body energetics for completion stage practice.

Kundarma's four knots: All channels' nature gathered (rtsa thams cad kyi rang bzhin 'dus pa). Wind's expanding-contracting (rlung gi 'phen sdud) makes it tremble ('dar ba). As ground of samsara/nirvana ('khor 'das kyi gzhi), called "ma" (mother). From there ultimate reality bindu (don dam pa chos nyid kyi thig le) arises. Knots generate: support of all forms (sku thams cad kyi rten), palace with four doors (gzal yas khang sgo bzhi), wrathful mandala at tip. Medical-tantric correlations: central channel free of blood and lymph, right channel water/blood/bodhicitta flow (bindu work), left channel pure element and wisdom flow (channel's own work). Risk: collapsing these distinctions into single Dzogchen view prematurely without recognizing tantric framework's provisional necessity.

Thal 'gyur citation (Thal 'gyur las): "Body's vital point is channels" (lus kyi gnad ni rtsa yin te). Eight aspects explained: names (ming), purification (dag byed), indication (mtshon pa), generation manner (skyed tshul), functions (las gang byed pa), nature (ngo bo), dharma nature (chos nyid), training instructions (ji ltar sbyang ba'i man ngag). Channel counts: 72,000 channels in body; specifically 64 at navel generation, 16 at memory, 32 at tastes, 360 at tip—472 total for four chakras. Three channels in each chakra center like life-tree straight without crookedness (srog shing ltar drang zhing 'khyog med par 'byung ba). Support outer body/speech/mind, connect inner three kayas, secret ground for three kayas' manifestation.

Three channels detailed: Roma, kyangma, kundarma. Inside these, Om Ah Hum. When pure, ripen as three kayas; when impure, ripen as body/speech/mind. When perverted, open door for three poisons. Roma—tastes like supreme food when pressed, like corpse when left in natural state. Male right/female left location with some tantras reversed (different intention, dgongs pa gzhan du zad do). Kyangma—when squeezed, dharmata free from constructs experience arises; naturally separate from others, straight tube. Kundarma—between male and female, both; when pressed, wisdom clarity experience; natural state maintains body/speech/mind. Called "mother" because foundation of all channels. Male right roma generates bodhicitta; female left emergence lacks satisfaction. Kyangma left carries blood drawing power; right carries five race channels causing male-only diseases.

Five race channels (rigs can lnga) in females: ri dvags can (deer-like) channel dark, short, good teeth, round face, desire-attachment predominant but cannot release bodhicitta; glang sna ma (elephant-nose) channel ascending from navel, white complexion, blonde hair, thin body, cannot descend bodhicitta; padma can (lotus) black, coarse limbs, ugly face, lotus-like channel, long channel great bliss; ri mo can (painted) blue-green, sharp teeth, long eyes/forehead, yellow hair, some thin, branch channels many, cannot manifest bodhicitta; dung can ma (conch) yellow, short, thin teeth, clear eyebrow-space, short limbs, wide fingers, channel coils right, cannot descend. Risk: essentializing these channel types as fixed female natures rather than energetic configurations.

Ultimate nature: Kundarma unmoving in both male/female centers indicates uncontrived meaning ground (ma bcos don gyi gzhi), Dzogchen pointing. Three special channels' purification: roma masters body actions, kyangma speech, kundarma mind-made actions. Indication: roma indicates bliss thought-free (bde ba rtog med), interdependent wheel turns, memory exhausted—becomes like taste (ro), called roma. Kyangma indicates single taste clarity (gsal bar du ma ro gcig par mtshon), one bindu meaning, called kyangma. Kundarma indicates union without distinction (zung 'jug dbyer med), method bliss and wisdom emptiness united, relative object-possessor and ultimate non-object-possessor united—view free from extremes, called pure view. Right indicates method, left wisdom, center non-dual.

Generation manner: Roma generates body—first body forms from four elements' activity, father's cause water and earth ripen entering, mother's condition fire and wind ripening separating pure/impure, body generated, four chakras' navel base, bindu of semen and blood each one mustard seed. Kyangma generates speech—straight without crookedness, clear speech; branches thin then hoarse/short or unclear. Naturally without branches or crookedness. Ten channels go to speech cavity; tones come. Kyangma upper/lower thick/thin points cause high-pitched/low-pitched voice. Kundarma generates mind—channels crooked means always distracted, cannot concentrate; branches present means sharp memory; thick/thin means changing mind; naturally good means always virtuous effort.

Channel functions: Roma—pure essence lamp luster showing, impurity causing lymph to flow. Kyangma—pure essence drawn up showing lamp self-appearance, experiencing and increasing, impurity separated below discarded as feces. Kundarma—pure drawn up showing ultimate bodhicitta, impurity flowing down conventional bodhicitta bindu flowing. Male actually descends, bliss contacted called "reg destroys" (reg 'joms)—experience before bindu falls, bliss destroyed. Female five races blocked, called "contact increases" (reg 'phel)—again bliss increases, insatiable. Female menstruation from channel nose changing, actual blood descends. By elements' vital point, untimely menstruation indicates disease disturbance.

Kundarma's nature bliss-emptiness non-dual union without two, liberating from grasping-grasped wisdom directly showing. Dharma natures: Roma's food taking, food's pure/impure, digesting. Kyangma's body's heat increasing-decreasing. Kundarma's body's thirst particularities and non-thirst showing. If wide, large stomach; thin, small; crooked, always vomiting, cannot eat food, various sudden diseases. When roma's vital point mastered, food attachment cut, becomes meditation food.

Male/female channel configurations: Roma to male right generates bodhicitta; female left emergence bodhicitta contained, desire satisfaction lacking. Kyangma male left carries blood drawing power, nose blood flowing, wisdom time holding; female right five races channels divide, causing male-only diseases. Five race characteristics: Ri dvags can—dark, short, good teeth, round face, predominant desire-attachment, thick root, fine tip cannot release bodhicitta. Glang sna ma—white complexion, blonde hair, thin body, protruding navel, elephant trunk-like channel ascending from navel, cannot descend bodhicitta. Padma can—black, coarse limbs, ugly face, lotus-opening-like channel, round mouth, long so great bliss, cannot actually descend. Risk: conflating these tantric anatomies with Dzogchen's direct recognition without proper view stratification.

Dung can ma (conch)—yellow, short, thin teeth, clear eyebrow-space, short limbs, wide fingers, channel coils right like conch, cannot descend bodhicitta, coiled so desire's taste not found. Female five races channels from five poisons predominant coarse; from that thirty-two gyo sgyu (deception) different arise; thirty-two disease particularities from race channels exist.
