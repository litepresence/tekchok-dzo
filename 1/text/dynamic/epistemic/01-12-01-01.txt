<classification> Chapter opening: Three main topics—nature of channels general presentation (rtsa'i rang bzhin spyir bstan pa), specific classifications (rnam grangs bye brag tu bshad pa), application method (nyams su blang tshul bstan pa). Tantric instructional framework for subtle body practice.

<classification> Mu tig phreng ba citation: Channels are bindus (rtsa rnams ni thig le ste), shaking and moving nature ('phr dang 'khyug pa'i bdag nyid can), ornamented by light rays ('od zer nyid kyis mdzes pa). Three parts: right, left, center (g.yas dang g.yon dang dbus ma). Three main channels: roma (ro ma), kyangma (rkyang ma), kundarma (kun 'dar ma). Roma: taking all tastes (kun gyi ro len par byed pa) like salt water (lan tshwa), generating uncommon experience of bliss based on bindu, called "taste" (ro). From desire-attachment cause (rgyu 'dod chags), called "ma" (mother). Depends on desire-attachment for buddhahood. Alternatively, ro means few actions (bya byed nyung ba), experience based on bindu's movement hard to express, called "ma." Inside moves conventional bindu, method nature (thabs kyi rang bzhin). Risk of reifying channels as physical tubes rather than subtle body energetics.

<classification> Kyangma explanation: Without crookedness or branches ('khyog dang yal ga med pas), called "straight tube" (rkyang pa reng bu). From nature of both ultimate and conventional bindus' cause, ultimate arising (don dam pa'i 'byung ba) and conventional arising (kun rdzob kyi 'byung ba) ripen and separate. Being straight, unchanging (mi 'gyur ba). Being all ground (kun gyi gzhi), called "mo" (female). Depending on this, effortless buddhahood.

<classification> Kundarma (kun 'dar ma): All gathering (kun 'dus pa), depending on this bindu, channel bliss, wind bliss all arise, called "ku" (all). Pervading generally, called "'dar ma" (pervasive). Roma location: from navel left coiling, moving right. Kyangma: from heart tip left emerging, from throat channel net emerging, from skull inside entering, left eye door opening. Roma: from right eye. Kundarma: center straight abiding, three tips diverging, middle door crown Brahma hole making appear, then rigpa thought-free body appears. Right tip right ear appearing, karma wind moves, fine branches two nose holes penetrating, doing karma wind and included moving, wind entering avadhuti, wind samadhi meditation support. Left ear one tip penetrating, from there wisdom wind making appear. Left channel natural bindu, right conventional bindu. Right conventional bindu depending, body ripens. That itself does body pleasure, pain, neutrality, elements increasing, decreasing, etc. actions. Four subtle knots exist there.

<classification> Channel functions: Three main channels as pathway for winds and bindus. Roma as method/wisdom integration. Kyangma as ultimate nature pathway. Kundarma as central channel connecting all. Not anatomical structures but subtle body topology for completion stage practice. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology if literalized as physical anatomy.

<classification> Dzogchen perspective: Channels as display of ground, not ultimately real. Recognition transcends need for channel manipulation. Definitive meaning: channels as metaphor for awareness' dynamic energy.

<classification> Practical application: Channel knowledge for completion stage yoga. Directing winds through channels. Bindu stabilization and movement. Integration with deity yoga. Instructional provisionality of subtle body technology.
