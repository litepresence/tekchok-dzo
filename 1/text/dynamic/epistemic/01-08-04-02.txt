<classification> Atiyoga Dzogchen ground framework. Longchenpa's own view: basis of non-dual primordial purity and spontaneous presence. Seven positions refuted as one-sided; actual basis transcends all characterizations while including all. Own system not eighth position but recognition that basis is beyond positions.

<pedagogy>direct-pointing
<classification> Synthesis presenting non-dual basis. Essence primordially pure, spontaneous accomplishment depth clearly existing, non-dual portion, primordially pure awareness thing characteristic not established. Abandoning dispute from two. Scriptural citations establishing ka dag and lhun grub as grounded in tantras.

<pedagogy>assertive-completion
<classification> Non-dual basis description—nature of spontaneous accomplishment dwells as subtle inner clarity; appearance essence empty, empty nature dwells clear; essence awareness being form, primordial wisdom primordially not gathering-separating. Essence primordially pure, nature spontaneously accomplished, difference not accepted.

<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Dispute resolution—each position has faults; establishing own essence primordially pure, nature spontaneous accomplishment. Not contradictory but complementary. Dream example: sleep and dream not contradictory, both depend on mind. Risk: reifying ka dag and lhun grub as separate entities—actual meaning is non-dual.
