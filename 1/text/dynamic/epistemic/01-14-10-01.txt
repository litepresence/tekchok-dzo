<classification> Lu gu rgyud (cord) continuous practice: Nor-bu 'phrul bkod citation—view's meaning cord-like, phenomena numerous but dharmata meaning not multiple. E-ma! Continuous yoga of view: unchanging view of that meaning. Lu gu rgyud kayas appearing directly difficult to grasp, rigpa's nature unceasing unobstructed abiding example like ocean clear stars-planets appearing, various unobstructed great abiding without habitual time. Continuous yoga of view without distraction from that meaning, no habitual sleep non-sleep. Day appearance night cessation—duality non-existent. Continuous yoga of conduct: lu gu rgyud nature and four times not separated, continuous yoga of conduct. Self-rig meditation continuum even without, meditation continuous yoga arises. Time and non-time all, not separated from lu gu rgyud, meditation continuous yoga. Instructional provisionality of cord-metaphor as continuity-support. Risk: practice-misread-as-ontology by treating cord as substantial connection rather than recognition-continuity.

<classification> Identifying deviations (gol sa ngos gzung) in continuous view-meditation-conduct-result. View deviations three: looking at emptiness deviates to formless absorptions four; looking at entities deviates to form realm seventeen stations; looking at lu gu rgyud appearance as permanent deviates to six realm stations bound by great attachment. Conduct deviations three: acting like crazy person toward all appearances deviates to lha-min realm; meaningless word-repetition conduct deviates to view of self-existence; child-like conduct toward six senses' objects deviates to unspecified realm. Meditation deviations three: meditating equanimity selflessness deviates to dark-empty appearance; meditating concentration seed-syllable deviates to samsara by attachment; meditating non-thought emptiness deviates to extreme cessation. Deviation causes various but no greater deviation place than this; lu gu rgyud no deviation, travelers' continuum appears deviated, actually no deviation at all, cause-effect designated for cutting deviation places. This for yogins not seeing rigpa direct appearance doing mind-path view-meditation-conduct-result, or dull faculties seeing but holding extremes. Cutting deviations: resolve view's meaning inwardly with rigpa self-clear radiance established at faculty-gate, beyond existence-nonexistence intellectual thought extremes, self-dang, self-sang view meaning. Thal-gyur citation: view's nature seen, not agitated by intellectual words. Self-sang self-appearance thigle meditation even grasping-fixation not gone, vast khrol-chags developed, clear reached non-distracted depth-clarity wisdom recognized, universally spread meditation without deviation. Seng-ge rtsal rdzogs citation: Dzogchen unceasing conduct, not arisen by doing, touches non-attachment self-liberation three. Result self-complete primordial great attainment—this rigpa self-abiding known as result, single decisive resolution, deviations cut. Dzogchen familiarity primordially exists, not arisen by meditation, touches unchanging thought-free four.
<classification> Dzogchen meaning difficult to realize, not found by indicating words, touches instruction secret-essence two.
<classification> Dzogchen rigpa non-thought, not realized by meditation, touches one great destination.
<classification> Dzogchen self-arisen wisdom, not accomplished by practice, touches definitive essence two.
<classification> Dzogchen result single-decisive, not completed by generation, touches attachment-liberation instruction three. Risk: nihilism by treating deviations as absolute rather than recognition-corrections.

<classification> How rigpa appears to the gate (sgol la snang tshul): rigpa and appearance two. Rigpa looking at self-radiance or self-arisen recognized time called "gate appearance." At that time potential-basis thog-tu thim, clear without spreading-gathering, vast khrol-chags, har-re sang-ngel abiding. Nor-bu 'phrul bkod citation: gate arises as path, dissolves into space-equal emptiness expanse, meaning wisdom generally appearing, nature completed nature-arisen. Appearance going out from gate—light, kayas, thigle etc. Nor-bu 'phrul bkod citation: then when going out from gate, dbyings' nature wisdom kaya, rigpa's nature method kaya, inseparably manifest appearance, unceasing unceasing great essence, not abiding like crushed kaya, essence pure wisdom vast, plays in great emptiness dharmata object, clear unobstructed dharmakaya essence-empty, empty time nature indeterminate.
