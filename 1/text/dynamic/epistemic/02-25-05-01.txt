<classification> Spontaneous presence from kayas three: sambhogakaya light's aspect appearance, emanation wisdom compassion's manifestation, both dharmakaya's manner is. Thus kayas three appearance-mode only different, essence not different. Essence one nature three bodies is, nature spontaneous presence three bodies is, compassion capacity three bodies is. Spontaneous presence within three bodies abiding, spontaneous presence light five colors light sambhogakaya, spontaneous presence manifestations emanation body, both dharmakaya's essence is. Three kayas are aspects of one spontaneous presence, not ontologically distinct entities. Risk of reification: treating kayas as separate existences rather than descriptions of one ground.

<classification> Essence empty appearance clear spontaneous presence from, kayas three appearance-mode clear, five lights wisdom's display, dharmakaya non-conceptual clear light, sambhogakaya five lights ornament wheel, emanation spheres light various forms, all self-appearances not other, natural expression clear light essence. Empty and clear inseparable: empty is not void but capacity for appearance, clear is not substance but unobstructed manifestation. Ground is empty appearance, not empty then appearance. Risk of nihilism: treating appearance as emerging from or grounded in something substantial rather than recognizing empty-clear as inseparable.

<classification> Thus essence kayas three not established, nature five wisdoms not established, compassion emanations not established. Not established from where arise? From ground's power natural expression. Natural expression not other than ground, ground not other than natural expression. Self-appearances ground's play, play not different from player. Display arises spontaneously without cause, not from something other than itself. Risk of reification: seeking a cause for appearance rather than recognizing spontaneous presence.
