<classification> Essence-extraction (bcud len) instructions from Thalgyur. Two approaches: various substance-based extraction (five elements, medicine, grass, nectar) and wind-based extraction through upper-lower breath union. Precious-jewels essence-extraction supreme among methods—five nectars joined in specific proportions, sealed vessel, gradual mercury consumption. Wind method: drawn into roma channel, throat wheel visualization, earth-water wind concealment transforming all appearances into food. Pedagogical provisionality providing recognition-support through subtle body engagement. Risk of practicing as physical sustenance method rather than recognition that all appearances are self-liberated wisdom-display.
