<classification> Advanced dream yoga techniques: holding-mastering points. Stirring method: mutual reverse of meditation objects mixed and stirred; wind-mind placed in four wheels stirred by sequence. Squeezing method: lion-sleep body posture, channel squeezed, mind hidden in throat; sleep without other-thought distraction. Throwing method: fierce aspiration reaching oral-instruction point, red A on white four-petal lotus visualized in throat center, channel-waves contracted. Six practices combined—train, stir, transform, squeeze, cut, throw to point—supreme precious. Great point experienced through stirring, squeezing, throwing. Instructional provisionality providing recognition-support through sleep-state techniques. Risk of reifying techniques as mechanical operations rather than wisdom-expression.

<classification> Channel-wind binding point—precious companion for all dream time. Enter wind-drop net point: lion-sleep posture, wind slowly projected, all saṃsāra-nirvāṇa appearance-existence dissolved into nose recollection-wheel; draw wind inner. Drop falls from crown HAM, all appearances in bliss state, heart mirror-reflection clear bright focus placed. Train repeatedly; reverse upward all appearance to throat wheel, mind held on unified red A; wind-essence held in throat while sleeping—secret great point. Thus point-bound, dream and latency finally exhausted, delusion awakened. Great effort time: though focus not complete, dream may cease. Medium: quickly hold dream. Finally: become virtue-latency then cease. Dream frequency reduces from many to few. Instructional provisionality of channel-wind binding as recognition-vehicle. Risk of practicing as sleep engineering rather than recognition of dream's true nature.
