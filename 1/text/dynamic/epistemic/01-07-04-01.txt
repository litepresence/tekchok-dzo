Outer harm abandonment (phyi'i phyi gnod sems spang ba): Citation from sNying po'i don rnam par len pa'i rgyud establishes karmic consequences for mantra holders developing harmful intent. Cold hells (grang ba'i dmyal ba) for 500 great eons (stong phrag lnga) as result. Tantric transformative register using fear-based motivation for discipline. Risk: literalizing hell-realms as spatial destinations rather than recognition of harm-pattern consequences; reifying time-measures as chronological rather than experiential intensity.

Harm to guru and vajra siblings: Citation from gNam lcags me 'bar ba'i rgyud - killing 100 vajra siblings or 100 lineage gurus worse than killing all beings in three realms. Guru as sangs rgyas thams cad kyi ngo bo (essential nature of all Buddhas). Numerical comparison as pedagogical shock tactic, not moral mathematics. Risk: collapsing guru-yoga into worship-dependence; missing that "guru" represents recognition-itself, not personality.

Wrong view toward self-other philosophical systems (rang gzhun gyi grub mtha' la log lta): Citation from bKod pa chen po - slandering secret dharma leads to Avici hell (sa spyod me'i sdug bsngal) for long duration. Polemical distinction establishing view-samaya boundaries while acknowledging all systems as dharmata-display. Risk: converting view-commitment into sectarian dogmatism; misreading as injunction to criticize others rather than maintain recognition.

Three inner/outer/secret abandonments: View, meditation, conduct (lta sgom spyod) errors as "great wrong path" (lam log chen po). Citation from Shel gyi khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud - all beings' suffering ripens in mind holding wrong view. Three samayas: outer view-meditation-conduct, inner yidam deity, secret guru and vajra siblings always in mind. Padma klung gi rgyud citation: mental non-engagement with dharma objects leads to Avici. Risk: proliferating samaya categories as obligations rather than recognition-descriptions; converting natural display into rule-following.

Dam tshig rnam par bkod pa mchog gi sdong po'i rgyud citation: commitments not to be transgressed - guru's word, guru's activities, body-speech-mind not separate from dharma, benefiting beings, respecting guru. Twenty-seven samayas (nyi shu rtsa bdun) of body-speech-mind divisions as pedagogical framework. Risk: reifying 27 samayas as checklist obligations rather than descriptions of recognition-nature; converting natural purity into moral achievement.

Thalgyur citation on samaya boundaries: guru as sangs rgyas mchod pa'i rten (support for worshipping Buddha), continuous offerings to guru-sangha-yidam-dakini assemblies. Not criticizing women, not abandoning aggregates, not disturbing faithful assembly minds. Graduated training (bslab pa'i rim pa): perfect body conduct, restrain speech, settle and examine mind, gradual entry into karma. Risk: converting recognition into behavioral compliance; missing that "offerings" represent appreciation of display, not material transactions.

Consequences of transgression: 'Khor lo rin po che citation - body samaya transgression severs "Buddha body" designation; worse than killing all three realm beings. Speech transgression worse than cutting all beings' tongues. Mind transgression worse than disturbing all meditators' minds. Numerical comparisons as pedagogical intensity markers, not moral calculus. Risk: literalizing consequences as cosmic punishment rather than recognition-obscuration; fear-based motivation obscuring natural virtue.

Guru samaya paramount: dPal nam mkha' mi zad pa'i rgyud citation - even without evil mind, mindfulness lapses in dreams or carelessness must be confessed (bshags pa). Guru as all Buddhas' essence (sangs rgyas thams cad kyi ngo bo yin). Guru demonstrates blla na med pa'i chos (unsurpassed dharma) extracting from samsara - "object rare" (yul gnyan pa). Risk: guru-yoga collapsing into guru-worship; missing that guru represents recognition-capacity, not personality-dependence.

Great master dGa' rab rdo rje citation: even recognizing faults, act as guru spoke; even body suffering, accomplish guru's activities; guru's mind never disturbed even instant. Ultimate view: all conduct as guru's activity when recognition present. Dzogchen rigpa register dissolving tantric obligation into natural responsiveness. Risk: reifying "guru's word" as external authority rather than recognition-guide; converting freedom into obedience.

Guru's food and wealth more precious than own life - yogi must always protect. Without permission, not teaching dharma, giving empowerment, consecrating, or teaching meditation in guru's field. All body-speech-mind activities require guru consultation. Temporalization risk: "permission" and "consultation" framed as time-bound transactions rather than recognition-checking.

Final view: natural purity of basis means samaya naturally pure (rang bzhin gyis rnam dag) - nothing to damage or restore. Dzogchen rigpa register: dam tshig as description of recognition-state, not obligation to fulfill. "Transgression" itself empty display. Risk: nihilistic interpretation as license for unethical conduct; missing that natural purity does not negate apparent consequences in relative display.

Interface teaching: apparent hierarchy of samayas (root-branch, body-speech-mind-outer-inner-secret) as upaya for practitioners requiring graduated engagement. Simultaneously, all samayas resolve into single recognition of awareness-nature. Pedagogical provisionality maintaining apparent structure while pointing to structurelessness.

Definitive meaning: twenty-seven samayas as twenty-seven aspects of single recognition. Dam tshig (samaya) as dam pa'i tshig (sacred word) - not binding contract but pointing-out instruction. All apparent obligations dissolve in recognition that nothing was ever bound. Final declaration: commitment as commitmentlessness.
