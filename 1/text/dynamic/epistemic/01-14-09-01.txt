General characteristic of lamps (spyi'i mtshan nyid): ye shes kyi rang snang (self-appearance of wisdom) displaying 'od gsal ma bu (clear light mother-child). 'Khor 'das gnyis kyi mtshams 'byed pa (dividing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundary) - lamps as recognition-gateway. Thalgyur citation: snang ba ston pa (displaying appearances), ye shes ma bur sbrel ba (connecting wisdom as mother-child). Rang gdangs gsal ba (self-radiance clarity) gathering rTog bral ye shes (wisdom free from thought) into 'od lus (light body). Risk: collapsing lamp-display into physical eye-experience; reifying "mother-child" as temporal sequence rather than simultaneous essence-manifestation.

First specific: rgyang zhags (water lamp) characteristic - 'byung ba bzhi'i dwangs ma ('dus pa (gathered essence of four elements). Yul rnam pa gnyis kyi cha 'dzin pas snang ba mched pa'i sgo (gateway of appearance-increase through holding two aspects of objects). Thalgyur citation: khyab pas 'jug la 'jug pas khyab (pervading enters, entering pervades) - four elements as bdag byed pa (self-making). 'Dzin 'jug mched dang byed pa (holding, entering, increasing, doing). Risk: reifying water lamp as anatomical structure; literalizing "four elements" as chemistry rather than display-energies.

Blo'i rtogs pas chos nyid dag pa'i dgongs pa la gnas pa (abiding in intention of pure dharmatā through mind-realization). 'Khor 'das la bzla ba (traversing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa).

Nyon mongs las dang bag chags bsreg (burning afflictions, karma, latencies) - smin byed 'khor 'das srog gcod pa (ripening cutting saṃsāra-nirvāṇa life). Risk: converting wisdom lamp into meditation technique; seeking "inner arising" as experience to achieve.

Ground-appearance displaying to sense-faculties (gZhi snang dbang po la shar ba) - temporarily sku dang ye shes (body and wisdom). Finally mthar thug ka dag gi dbyings la sbyor ba'i 'bras bu (result connecting to primordially pure expanse).

Temporal language "ripening" pedagogical pointer, not chronological process. Risk: temporalizing timeless recognition into progressive maturation.

Thig le'i sgron ma (thigle lamp) characteristic: zlum khrrigs dmar gsal (round, firm, red, clear) appearing to eye as support for ye shes 'char ba (wisdom arising). sGron ma 'bar ba citation: zlum zhing rang bzhin kun gsal ba (round, nature all-clear), dmar dwangs kha dog gsal ba'i 'od (red-clear color clear light), spros dang bcas te mched par byed (increasing with elaboration). Thigle as empty essence (stong pa'i mtshan nyid) with spontaneous display. Risk: reifying thigle as physical bindu; seeking red light-appearance as goal.

Thalgyur citation: mthing ga rang rdzogs gnyis kyi cha (blue self-complete two portions), thabs dang shes rab rdzogs pas (complete means and wisdom), zur gnyis cha las sku gnyis 'dzin (holding two bodies from two corners). Risk: collapsing dharmadhatu lamp into physical eye-anatomy; missing "blue vast light" as metaphor for boundless recognition.

<risk>thing-making
<classification>
Four lamps collectively: outer water lamp as rtsa rlung thig le'i rtsal (energy of channels-winds-thigles). Inner wisdom lamp as rig pa rang byung (self-arisen awareness). Secret thigle lamp as gdangs ris (radiance marks). Suchness dharmadhatu lamp as mthing ga 'od (blue light). Polemical distinction: four as pedagogical entry points, not ontological layers. All dissolve in single recognition. Risk: proliferating four lamps as separate practices; reifying outer-inner-secret-suchness as spatial containers.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<risk>nihilism
<classification>
Lamps as self-appearance (rang snang) not other-appearance (gzhan snang). All four aspects simultaneously present in single recognition - not sequential cultivation. Thogal as thod rgal (direct crossing) - not "seeing lights" but direct recognition without meditation. Definitive meaning: lamps describe recognition-nature, not techniques for recognition. Risk: nihilistic interpretation as "nothing to see"; eternalist interpretation as "special visions to achieve."

<classification>
Tantric interface: lamp-terminology shared with snga 'gyur tantra systems but repurposed in Dzogchen. Water lamp anatomical descriptions (four element essences, eye structure) as transformative vocabulary, not medical facts. Pedagogical provisionality: apparent physicalism as access point for recognition. Risk: literalizing tantric physiology; missing metaphorical nature of lamp-descriptions.

Final classification: four lamps as four aspects of single rigpa gsal (awareness clarity). Not "four things to work with" but "four ways recognition displays itself." sGron ma (lamp) as sgron pa (illuminating) - awareness illuminating itself. Definitive meaning beyond all lamp-categories: recognition without framework.

<risk>reification
<classification>
Upaya framing: detailed lamp-descriptions as thabs (skillful means) for practitioners requiring structured approach. Simultaneously, all structure dissolves in direct recognition. Pedagogical dialectic: providing detailed framework while pointing to frameworklessness. Risk: clinging to framework as necessary; or rejecting framework prematurely without recognition.

<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification>
Ultimate view: lamps neither exist nor non-exist as categories. Ye shes (wisdom) neither comes from outer display nor inner realization - simultaneously both and neither. All technical vocabulary (thigle, channels, elements) as gdangs (radiance) of recognition. Final declaration: four lamps, one light, zero essence.
