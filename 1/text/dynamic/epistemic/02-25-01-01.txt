<classification> Mu-tig-phreng-ba: Liberation place itself is primordial. Primordial primordial purity, awareness self-recognition, now cause not return, confusion-basis exhausted, result called name becomes. Detailed above ground's section explained, particularly stain-free divided, know. Fruition terminology: shift from ground to result is nominal, not ontological. Longchenpa establishes that result is merely name for recognition of what was never other than primordially pure. This reflects snying thig view that path and fruition are non-dual. Second, three: expanse liberation actual; expanse dwelling nature; expanse dharmata's intent how coiled. First: faculties sharp-dull-medium three liberation time, result difference not, time three Buddhas all intent exhausted Dharmakaya expression-free that itself one, face-equal difference-free nature thigle essence single Buddha. Also this life spontaneously accomplished or bardo self-appearance recognized, or emanation field breath sent, path-appearance's body and wisdom's appearance outer-clear aspects, spontaneous presence dissolution manner stages expanse into dissolve, crystal-light inside gathered like time, appearance emptiness liberates. Wisdom expanse dissolved, form-body Dharmakaya's expanse parinirvana, entity and sign not, space-like dharmata taste one—space space into dissolve like. Risk of nihilism: interpreting dissolution as chronological process rather than atemporal recognition.

<classification> Dissolution analogies continue. Recognition is not temporal process but revelation of what was always the case. All temporal markers are provisional scaffolding.
