Refutation and response on wind duality: Channels moving only, yet karma and wisdom two separately move—what? Moving different two logically; one then two not possible; moving only one, samsara-nirvana either from one not logically—answer: moving only one, channels squeezed-not-squeezed moving, wisdom wind gone, function bliss-emptiness, clarity-emptiness, wisdom wind called. Channels moved squeezed, karma wind gone, function conceptuality various, non-virtuous connections various, unclear, sinking, excitement, dullness, coiling etc. bad wind arising. Example: one bha ra child angered tiger becomes, not angered human comes; awareness sound and body channels moving wind only one, channels squeezed-not-squeezed, consciousness workable wisdom, unworkable affliction becomes—horse arising, faultless. Risk: conflating tantric physiological explanation with Dzogchen's direct view of primordial purity.

Individual function explanation two: wisdom and karma wind functions. Wisdom wind's function four wisdoms: abiding part ground-abiding wisdom; appearance part characteristic-holding; arising part knowable-gathering; moving part consciousness-gathering. Four definite cause time; path time ultimate elements four; result time four bodies' nature ripening. Ground-path-result three 12 arises, Buddha's activity twelve cause. Karma wind's work four: right moving male, left female, outer coming various appearances entering, inner filling conceptuality spreading. Right-left time definite male-female father-mother power; naturally right transference work, karma's end near; left grasping work. Outer going inner filling going-coming power: outer joy, inner unhappiness. Wheel's spreading-gathering vital point day-night arising.

Outer going part day appearance; inner filling part night appearance. Both functions four two-two eight; parts 24. Karma wind particularities twelve, moving work body growth-decay; outer year 12, inner month 12, secret time 12. Samsara's work karma wind does. Change measure: body ripened youth, one day four elements wind change: earth 5,400; water, fire, wind 5,400, 400—sum 21,600 youth change measure. Youth 32 lacking elements not full. Wind latency life's time: transference long end carried, short not; strong merit; clinging disease suffering; slow disease few; dull virtue not; 'byil non-virtuous; excited distracted. Risk: interpreting these correspondences as fixed laws rather than recognition supports.

Risk: reifying emptiness as another thing to achieve.
