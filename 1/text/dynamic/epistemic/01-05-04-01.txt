<classification> Opening of five-fold classification (rnam grangs lnga) establishing pedagogical framework. Nyizla Khasbyor Gyud citation: root meaning establishing title (rtsa ba'i don), yoga meaning showing entry/exit (yoga don), purpose meaning establishing self-place (dgos ched don), word meaning connecting to main topic (tshig gi don), history meaning satisfying minds (lo rgyus don). Five aspects not separate additions but facets of single definitive meaning. Instructional provisionality of structural framework.

<pedagogy>negational-clearing
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Faults of non-explanation clearing misconceptions: Without historical context, doubt arises regarding gsang chen nges pa'i bka' (definitive secret teachings). Without root meaning, dharmas fail to gather creating endless fault. Without yoga meaning, vehicle distinctions unclear rendering graduated meaning meaningless. Without purpose meaning, Dzogchen effortlessness appears meaningless. Without word meaning, tantra sequence clarity fails, letters not understood. Risk of view-collapse if structural framework dismissed as merely conventional without recognizing its pedagogical necessity.
