Five-fold structural framework (rnam grangs lnga): Nyizla Khasbyor Gyud citation organizing exposition into (1) rtsa ba'i don—root meaning establishing title/meaning; (2) yoga don—yoga meaning showing entry/exit points; (3) dgos ched don—purpose meaning establishing self-place; (4) tshig gi don—word meaning connecting to main topic; (5) lo rgyus don—history meaning satisfying minds. Tantric instructional provisionality: structural framework as recognition-facilitation, not arbitrary convention. Five aspects as facets of single definitive meaning, not separate additions. Risk: reifying five-fold structure as mandatory format rather than pedagogical tool.

Faults of non-explanation (ma bshad pa'i skyon): De nyid las citation—without lo rgyus don, doubt arises regarding gsang chen nges pa'i bka' (definitive secret teachings); without rtsa ba don, dharmas fail to gather creating endless fault (mtha' yas pa'i skyon); without yoga don, vehicle distinctions unclear rendering rim pa (gradation) meaningless; without dgos ched don, Dzogchen effortlessness appears meaningless; without tshig gi don, tantra sequence clarity fails, letters not understood. Negational clearing demonstrating pedagogical necessity of structure. Risk: view-collapse if structural framework dismissed as merely conventional without recognizing its recognition-facilitating function.

Benefits of proper explanation (legs par bshad pa'i phan yon): De nyid las citation—abandoning faults thus all qualities complete (yon tan thams cad rdzogs par 'gyur). Exposition not adding new qualities but revealing primordial completeness (ye nas yon tan rdzogs) through proper engagement. Tantric transformative view recognizing explanation as recognition-facilitation, not information transfer.

Purpose (dgos pa) from Rigpa Rangrol: rang gi grub mtha' skyob pa (protecting own philosophical position) and gzhan gyi grub mtha' sun 'byin (refuting others' positions). Bshad bya (teaching topic) as that requiring exposition. Dzogchen polemical distinction not aggression but clarification—clearing obstacles to recognition. Polemics as compassionate cutting of confusion, not competitive debate.

Twenty-three/eight metaphors for teaching styles (bshad thabs) from Sna tshogs rin po che'i dpe: (1) Tiger mother's leap (stag mo'i mchongs stabs)—wisdom cutting great meaning; (2) Great garuda mind (khyung chen)—unveiling meaning's depths; (3) Lion's roar (seng ge'i gdangs skad)—overwhelming lower vehicles; (4) Tortoise movement (rus sbal nur 'gros)—collecting letter-essence; (5) Crow claw (pho rog sor tog)—cutting errors/obscurations; (6) Wrestler's throw (gyad kyi dor thabs)—condensing extensive meaning; (7) Great elephant lying (glang chen nyal ba)—guiding view to object; (8) Khyung rounding (mkha' lding rgum mthun)—searching meaning's objects; (9) Eagle gathering (glag mo gzan 'jums)—explaining without doubt; (10) Youth climbing rock (gna' 'phrug brag 'dzeg)—appropriate/inappropriate explanation; (11) Pearl threading (mu tig star brgyus)—combining pith instructions; (12) Seasonal rain (dus kyi 'brug char)—drawing out other's faults; (13) Dissolving appearances (mtshan ma bud pa)—gathering all doors; (14) Wish-fulfilling tree (dpag bsam ljon shing)—extensive great explanation; (15) Clear sky sun (mkha' gsal nyi ma)—pervading all; (16) Depth-clear moon (gting gsal zla ba)—explaining samsara/nirvana; (17) Lion's posture (seng ge bzhugs tshul)—connecting meditation meaning; (18) Goose harmony (ngang mo mthun 'gros)—combining meaning depths; (19) Sky rainbow (bar snang 'ja' tshon)—explaining dharmadhatu with ornaments; (20) Razor point (spu gri so 'debs)—distinguishing views; (21) Mirror mandala (me long dkyil 'khor)—explaining with causes/conditions; (22) Sky lightning (bar snang glog 'gyu)—quick word-by-word meaning; (23) Empty space (nam mkha' stong pa)—explaining vast without limit. Five additional: Root piercing (zug pa rtsa ba)—showing awareness' nature; Coiled trunk ('dril ba sdong po)—condensing dharmas to meaning; Branch divergence (gyes pa yal ga)—sealing pith instructions; Leaf unfolding (rgyas pa lo 'dab)—twenty-onefold explanation; Flower clarity (gsal ba me tog)—dual lamp explanation; Fruit ripening (smin pa 'bras bu)—result not returning to cause. Tantric instructional provisionality: teaching diversity as upaya for different capacities. Risk: practicing "teaching styles" as techniques rather than recognizing spontaneous communication; literalizing metaphors as required behaviors.

(5) Upa (u pa'i rgyud): combining ritual and meditation equally. (6) Yoga (rnal 'byor gyi rgyud): lha'i ngo bo mthong ba'i ting nge 'dzin (samadhi seeing deity nature) emphasized—lha dang grogs po lta bu (deity as friend). Three outer tantras using appearances as path through ritual/meditation balance.

Dzogchen summit view: Atiyoga as rtse mo (pinnacle) of nine vehicles—not superior but complete—recognition. Semde emphasizing sems nyid (mind nature); Longde emphasizing klong (openness/expanse); Menngagde emphasizing direct ngo sprod (introduction). Three sections not hierarchical but recognition-facets of single rigpa. Definitive meaning beyond all vehicles yet inclusive—all nine as thabs (skillful means) of single awareness. Dzogchen fulfilling (rdzogs) and transcending (sgrol) all vehicles simultaneously. Risk: view-collapse if Dzogchen superiority reified; or if lower vehicles dismissed as unnecessary.

Causal vs Result vehicles: rGyu'i theg pa (causal vehicles—sutric three) purifying sgrib pa (obscurations) to reveal buddha-nature. 'Bras bu'i theg pa (result vehicles—tantric six) recognizing buddha-nature as already complete (gdod nas rdzogs). Sutra-tantra distinction not ontological but pedagogical—both lead to same recognition through different thabs (methods). Polemical distinction clarifying approach differences without hierarchical denigration. Dzogchen view: all vehicles share ngo bo gcig (single essence), differ in thabs (method).

Single nature recognition: All nine vehicles as sgo dgu (nine doors) to same recognition. Rang snang (self-appearance) of awareness displaying as vehicle-diversity. No superior/inferior fruition—only recognition or non-recognition of chos sku'i rang bzhin (Dharmakaya nature). Buddha-nature as gzhi (ground), lam (path), 'bras bu (fruition) simultaneously—not sequential development.

Spontaneously pure (lhun grub rang grol) not license for conduct but recognition of conduct's empty nature. Samaya as rig pa'i rang zhal (awareness' own face)—not keeping but recognizing—primordial purity. Definitive meaning: no commitment, no transgression, no keeper, no kept. Risk: nihilistic misreading as permission for unethical behavior; missing that recognition of emptiness manifests as natural virtue (dge ba).
