<classification> Cittamatra: all appearances are aspects of consciousness, no external reality separate from mind. Three positions: each aspect has own consciousness; aspects and consciousness like shell and kernel; aspects and consciousness non-dual. All deny external objects while affirming consciousness exists. Dzogchen perspective corrects external realism but notes subtle reification.

<classification> Non-dual Cittamatra: consciousness alone perceives, entering five sense doors. Perceived-aspect and perceiving-consciousness of one nature. Cittamatra affirms non-dual consciousness as truly existent; Dzogchen view recognizes even this as empty display. Risk: eternalism through reifying self-awareness.
