<classification> Cittamatra core thesis: all appearances are aspects of consciousness, no external reality separate from mind. Jewel reflected in water illustrating appearance without external object. Three positions on consciousness and aspect outlined. Provisional meaning from Dzogchen perspective—corrects external realism but retains subtle reification of consciousness.

<pedagogy>polemical-distinction
<classification> Three Cittamatra positions on perception: each aspect with own consciousness; aspects and consciousness like shell and kernel; aspects and consciousness non-dual. All deny external objects while affirming true existence of consciousness. Polemical distinction establishing that all three remain within reification—consciousness itself is empty.

<classification> Non-dual position: consciousness alone perceives, entering five sense doors. Perceived-aspect and perceiving-consciousness of one nature in non-dual wisdom. Compared to dream appearance and perceiver being non-dual. Cittamatra affirms this non-dual consciousness as truly existent; Dzogchen view recognizing even this as empty display.

<risk>eternalism
<classification> False aspectarians holding external objects do not exist, aspects as false habit-energy. Perceiving consciousness not truly existent—meeting-consciousness also false. Both object-aspect and perceiving-consciousness of deluded appearance-nature, only experiencing self-awareness ultimately existent. Risk of eternalism through reifying self-awareness.
