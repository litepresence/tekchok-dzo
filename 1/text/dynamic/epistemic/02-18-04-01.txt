<classification> Verse citation on Dharmakaya's abiding manner operates as upāya within definitive view. The "body-point" refers to recognition of body's nature as dharmakaya, not anatomical location. The pedagogical function provides somatic access to recognition for practitioners who benefit from body-based pointing. The Dzogchen view recognizes that Dharmakaya was never separate from the body—the "abiding" is not achieved but recognized. Risk of reifying body-point as technique rather than recognition-point.

<classification> Three-kaya posture practice marks transition from sems-side methodology to definitive recognition. The three postures—frog for sprul sku, elephant for longs sku, lion for chos sku—operate as instructional provisionality. The crucial integration: three kayas abide in heart as self-existing clear light; posture practice makes manifest the three intentions already present. Three kayas are self-nature, so one's own posture becomes three-kaya posture. Without posture control, wisdom's self-radiance in channels is not evoked; without evocation, wisdom-appearance does not dawn. Posture is essential as recognition-condition, not cause. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating postures as achieving rather than revealing.

<classification> Simile of snake's limbs—present but not manifest unless coiled—illustrates posture's function: wisdom appears through crucial point, just as limbs appear through coiling. The question whether three postures are definite or variable points to definitive view: the number is pedagogical, not ultimate. All postures are equally valid recognition-supports; the "three" is upāya for structured practice, while definitive recognition transcends posture entirely—available in any position, any circumstance. Risk of view-collapse: treating number as definitive rather than pedagogical.

<classification> Threefold classification of beings according to affliction ripening: sentient beings led into three realms by three afflictions, liberation occurs through same three doorways—body, speech, mind. Three poisons (desire, confusion, anger) ripen as three forms (bird, pig, snake), each emphasizing one door as predominant. Desire-unpurified ripens into bird-form with speech predominant.
<classification> Sambhogakaya posture taught for desire-types. Provisional teaching method meeting practitioners through predominant karmic pattern. Risk of nihilism: interpreting correlations as fixed destinies rather than recognition-entry points. Dzogchen view recognizes desire, confusion, anger as modalities of single awareness; postures are pointing-devices revealing poisons as wisdom-display when recognized.

<classification> Second elaboration: confusion-unpurified ripens into pig-form with mind predominant, mental dullness, conceptual proliferation. "Waking the sleeper" indicates dormant tendency requiring awakening. Dharmakaya posture taught for confusion-types—abiding in dharmata throughout three times. "Three times" indicates recognition transcends temporal becoming: not attaining future but recognizing what has always been abiding. Instructional method: provisional for practitioners whose confusion manifests as mental dullness. Risk of reification: treating "abiding in dharmata" as progressive attainment rather than recognition of primordial abiding. Dzogchen view recognizes confusion as display of awareness.
<classification> Dharmakaya posture reveals confusion as self-arisen wisdom.

<classification> Third elaboration: anger-unpurified ripens into snake-form with body-action predominant, physical restlessness, great body-power. Nirmanakaya posture taught specifically for anger-types—abiding in this posture one certainly awakens. The connection to nirmanakaya (manifestation body) points directly to awakening as activity-display. This teaching is provisional for practitioners whose anger manifests as physical restlessness. Risk of reification: treating "anger-types" as ontologically separate category rather than recognition-pattern description. Dzogchen view recognizes anger as manifestation of awareness's energy.
<classification> Nirmanakaya posture reveals anger-energy as wisdom-display when recognized.

<classification> Definitive statements about posture completeness: three postures are certain—not more (superfluous) nor fewer (incomplete). Rationale: sentient beings' aspirations appearing in body, speech, and mind, and liberation occurring through the same three doorways. "Not more" addresses danger of proliferation; "not fewer" addresses danger of incompleteness. Final line marks transition from karmic-structural teaching to direct introduction—"cutting off speech about the speech-point" indicates definitive teaching beyond conceptual elaboration. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating three postures as rigid categories rather than skillful-means pointing beyond all categories. Dzogchen view recognizes body, speech, mind never truly separate; "cutting off of speech" marks recognition: awareness beyond all descriptions including threefold classification.

<classification> Thal Gyur citation on speech training: four phases—training (reduce speaking, cut ordinary conversation), abiding (do not reject mantras but do not mix syllables), recitation (mantra-recitation ceases), stabilization (without speaking, not departing from that state, not using body-gestures). During this process, one understands meaning of body-signs. This is skillful means (upaya) for gradual path practitioners. Risk of nihilism: interpreting silence as value itself rather than recognition-support. Dzogchen view recognizes "cutting speech" is not suppression but recognition—that speech has never been other than awareness's self-expression.
