<classification> Bardo states as opportunities for recognition, applying Dzogchen view to transitions between life, death, and rebirth. Six bardos—living, dreaming, meditation, dying, dharmata, becoming—all expressions of ground's spontaneous presence. Recognition in any bardo leads to liberation. Instructional framework for critical transitions.

<risk>reification
<classification> Rainbow body as ultimate fruition—complete dissolution of material body into light at death. Not miraculous achievement but natural result of complete recognition. Material body as condensation of subtle elements appearing due to delusion; elements return to natural state as light when delusion dissolved. Risk of reifying rainbow body as goal to achieve rather than natural expression of recognition.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Six bardos all offering opportunities for recognition, not essentially different from ordinary life. All display of awareness. Bardo of dying and dharmata particularly emphasized as ordinary perception dissolves, revealing natural state. Definitive recognition of bardos as opportunities.

<classification> Recognition in bardo of dying leading to dharmakaya liberation; in dharmata to sambhogakaya; in becoming to nirmanakaya. All three liberation; difference in clarity of recognition. Dream yoga, clear light meditation, phowa as preparations. Instructional provisionality of bardo preparation methods.

<pedagogy>upaya-statement
<classification> Relationship between bardo practice and Dzogchen's direct approach. Bardo teachings valuable but Dzogchen emphasizes recognition in this life as most effective preparation. Perfect recognition now making bardo recognition natural. Upaya acknowledging multiple entry points while emphasizing immediate recognition.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Rainbow body as ultimate sign of complete realization, demonstrating material world as display of awareness. Body dissolves into five-colored light of five wisdoms. Definitive finality of complete recognition manifesting as light-dissolution.

<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Lesser degrees of realization: body of light where body becomes light but doesn't fully dissolve; eternal body where realization complete but body remains. Four visions progressively purifying elements until only light remains. Risk of fixating on achievement-levels rather than recognition itself.

<classification> Trekcho establishing recognition of primordial purity; thodgal manifesting this as light. Both necessary for complete realization culminating in rainbow body. Definitive unity of cutting-through and direct-approach.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> While conventionally physical body dissolves, ultimately there was never physical body—only display of awareness. Dissolution revealing truth always present. Definitive recognition of appearance-emptiness unity in death-transition.
