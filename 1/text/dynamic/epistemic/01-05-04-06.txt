<classification> Teaching prophecy establishing temporal framework through sixty-four great eons. Theg mchog snying thig transmission traced from primordial Buddha through successive eons, with sixty-six directly manifested teachings and immeasurable indirect manifestations.

<classification> Enumeration of sixty-four eons as tshangs chen kalpa—cosmic time frames expressing inexhaustible teaching capacity. Ninety thousand Buddhas manifested across seven teaching phases, culminating in Vajradhara's arrangement. Numerical specificity as symbolic completeness, not quantitative census. Risk of literalizing temporal framework as historical record rather than pedagogical architecture.

<classification> Buddha activity as rang byung (self-arisen) from Samantabhadra's display—sixty-four thousand emanations from single gzhi snang (ground-appearance). Teaching capacity beyond tenth-ground bodhisattva comprehension, let alone ordinary perception. Citation from Uttaratantra and Ratnakuta establishing authoritative grounding for ineffable activity-scope.

<classification> Definitive assertion: all who attain Buddhahood do so through gsang chen (Secret Great Vehicle) connection. Recognition of rig pa mngon sum gyi chos nyid (directly manifest dharmata) as sole liberation-path. Other vehicles' fruition incomplete by comparison—not denigration but epistemic classification. Risk of hierarchical reification obscuring ngo bo gcig (single nature).

<classification> Guru devotion verses for Kunmaraja (Kumaradza)—emanation of Vimalamitra explicitly prophesied. Five distinguishing marks: mole with A-sign, nose-tip prominence, instruction-superiority, clairvoyance, clear explanation of difficult points, miraculous parinirvana signs.

Twenty great eons of non-appearance for sentient beings, then renewed manifestation through Samantabhadra's power. Cyclical cosmology as pedagogical framework, not literal astronomy.

<classification> Final teaching phases—sravaka arhats gathered, bodhisattva teachings, gradual cessation of appearances across twenty thousand eons. Provisional framework accommodating conventional Buddhist cosmology while Dzogchen view recognizes all as chos nyid rang snang. Lineage masters' differing interpretations of ultimate scope reconciled through thugs rje (compassion) inclusivity.
