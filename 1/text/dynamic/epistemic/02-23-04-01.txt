<classification> Piercing from one's own heart center into their heart center demonstrates connection of self-display—like crystal lights rays connecting to crystal. This is definitive Dzogchen: apparent other is not separate but connected through awareness's self-radiance. At that time, seeing one's own eye-rays—knowing is captured, one naturally abides in non-conceptual meditation without thought toward any object. This is not meditation as technique but recognition of natural abiding. Eye-rays are not physical phenomena extending without but radiance of awareness obstruction. Piercing indicates non-dual recognition, not spatial penetration. Dzogchen view: there was never any separation between one's heart and their heart—both are modalities of single awareness-display. Risk of view-collapse: treating as experience to have rather than recognition of what is.

<classification> Third instruction showing non-reversal—five light-rays coiled without touching five-fold conjunction, like five horse-spokes coiled—presents sophisticated recognition technique. First: awareness entering light—when looking outward at self-appearance, place in state of knowing those appearances as self-appearance. As those appearances dissolve through rays into one's own heart center, this is called light entering awareness. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating as mechanical procedure rather than recognition that appearance has never been other than awareness. External lights like armor-plates dissolving into one's own awareness's heart center, entering the lap—this is metaphor, not anatomy. Dharmata mixing, liberated in primordial purity's ground—definitive point: dissolution is not process but recognition of non-duality. Appearances dissolve not into location but into their own nature as awareness.
