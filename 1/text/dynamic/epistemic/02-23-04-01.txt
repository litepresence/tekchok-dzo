Elaborate five-element dissolution process ('byung lnga thim tshul) in three phases: external dissolution (phyi 'byung), internal dissolution (nang 'byung), and secret dissolution (gsang 'byung). External: five elements dissolve into five—earth into earth (sa sa la thim) losing body strength (lus kyi stobs shor), water into water (chu chu la thim) causing nasal/mouth moisture loss, fire into fire (me me la thim) losing body heat, wind into wind (rlung rlung la thim) losing radiance and breath. Internal: five spaces dissolve into rigpa (nam mkha' lnga dbyings rig la thim), five vital winds dissolve into consciousness. Secret: twenty-five winds dissolve into dhatu. Definitive mechanism: wind (rlung) performs all karma (las kun byed)—when winds dissolve into space, samsara liberates into nirvana, nirvana liberates into primordial purity. Risk of view-collapse: reading as literal anatomical process rather than recognition of elemental nature as rigpa-display.

Threefold dharmata bardo instruction: awareness entering luminosity (rig pa 'od gsal gyi thim tshul), luminosity self-appearance arising ('od gsal rang snang gi 'char tshul), self-appearance sense liberation (rang snang dbang po'i grol tshul). Definitive Dzogchen framework presenting bardo not as intermediate state but as dharmata self-display. When five winds dissolve into dhatu, heart center wisdom-layer enters center—separated from horse of mind/mind-activities along with all-ground, all samsaric phenomena dormant. Critical moment ('khor 'das rgyab gyed) when rigpa emerges from white clarity, exits through water lamp into pure space dhatu, arising as self-appearance. Eightfold liberation dissolution completing the process. Risk of reification: treating dissolution stages as temporal sequence rather than simultaneous recognition aspects.

Detailed luminosity appearance ('od gsal gyi snang ba): from Thal 'gyur (Thalgyur) tantra—here dharmata bardo explained, at death consciousness dissolves into space, space dissolves into luminosity, coarse/subtle appearances cease, endowed-with-all-faculties light body, karma and obscurations transform accordingly. At this time light-appearance fragmentation, skilled ones capture arising appearance. Movement wind and arising make five-by-five colors and rays, appearing as uncertain rainbow. Rigpa emerges from eye into space. Within rigpa's expanse five wisdom winds exist—through arising five luminosity appears as rainbow filling space, five wisdoms individually clear without mixing. Mirror-like wisdom (me long lta bu'i ye shes) inherently pure self-display white, clear in own place without mixing with other four—east direction in bardo, experience-time front direction own place. Rays pure projection, layered, shining like sun rays. Equality wisdom (mnyam pa nyid kyi ye shes) essence with spontaneously present qualities unobstructedly complete—self-display yellow. Discriminating wisdom (so sor rtog pa'i ye shes) with four powers unobstructedly arising—self-display red. Accomplishing wisdom (bya ba grub pa'i ye shes) with activity power inherently complete—self-display green. Dharmadhatu wisdom (chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes) with spontaneously accomplished dharmata inherently complete—self-display blue. Risk of view-collapse: spatial directional assignments misread as literal geography rather than recognition modalities.

Recognition instruction at appearance-time: consciousness abiding in natural meditation (rang bzhin gyi bsam gtan) recognizing arising appearance as self-appearance—supreme key instruction (gnad kyi man ngag mchog). If recognized here, liberated in primordial purity ground in three moments—first recognition, second liberation through knowing, third dissolution into primordial purity, no appearances thereafter. Citation from Nyi zla kha sbyor (Sun Moon Union) establishing authoritative basis. Analysis of such appearances: when consciousness dissolves into luminosity, immediately after outer-inner breath cessation, one's faculties—appearing as objects from parts—arising fire-knowing consciousness appears. Aggregate body not seen, clearly as light body. At that time faculties' activity scope becomes five-light mandala. These appearances: looking from outside, inside clear; from inside, outside clear; without outside-inside, completely penetrating; deceptive like mirage, like fire; pressing feels soft, lifting feels buoyant; extremely captivating; appearing as colors without mixing, clear in own place; equally clear, unobstructed clarity; truly looking extremely subtle, moving, quivering, flickering, shining with natural majesty; extremely vast, immeasurable, unfindable object; high depth, wide peak, abiding as source of all mandalas. Five colors: white clear in own place with ray projection; likewise yellow, red, green, blue—each clear in own place with rays, not touching but clear—individually, naturally majestic. Risk of reification: treating light descriptions as objective phenomena rather than awareness's self-radiance.

Union bindu appearance (zung 'jug tsom bu'i snang ba) extensive explanation from Thal 'gyur: entering and maturing winds make four directions, intermediate directions, above-below accomplished. Directional lights gather there, five families' bodies clearly appear—blue, white, yellow, red, green with respective consorts. If mchad and 'dzin known here, buddhas' qualities complete—not entering three realms. Characteristics: free from coarse elements, light from bindus blazing in pairs, bindus connecting five filling body, half-body from which forms complete, form-half-body five-by-five pairs, each bindu complete with five, ten, hundred, thousand, ten-thousand bindus, pure nature appearing to thought, ineffable countless. Knowing self and other here obtain three bodies gathered into one—obtaining this never returns. Risk of view-collapse: numerical enumerations (five, ten, hundred, thousand) misread as literal quantification rather than indicating infinite display nature.
