<classification> Third: arising in bindu surrounding. Heart inner bindu clear with five colors like five-colored pearl. Size like fish eye. Light measure round like sleeping eye. Clarity measure like dakini mind-agitated eye. Occasionally wisdom wind moves, within crystal-like translucent channel, quivering and abiding. Familiarity-born bindu: actually appearing wisdom, wisdom partially pure appearance. From partially pure characteristic-holding wisdom, first appearing as light platter, then segments, broken, swirling, flickering. Direct meditative experience framework.
