<classification> Three view-stance teaching operates as instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from structured approach. Citation from Thal Gyur: suffering's grasping's destruction-impossible—this is definitive teaching that suffering cannot be destroyed because it never truly existed. Instruction to distinguish and that Unborn-Gnosis eyes not needing—this is provisional: eyes don't need to not see because recognition never relies on them. From eyes side, expanse's self-born—indicates that recognition's capacity to see is intrinsic to awareness, not acquired. Risk of view-collapse: mixing definitive statement suffering's destruction-impossible with provisional eyes not needing—former ontological, latter pedagogical.

<classification> Awareness-experience teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Appearance description from Thal Gyur: dharmata-cognition, display—establishes that recognition is not separate from dharmata-display. Teaching: from affliction's door, established—this is sems-side provisional explaining how delusion's function obscures recognition. Statement: Sprin not-having in space's sphere—indicates that recognition is like space: empty yet able to contain all appearances without obstruction. Risk of view-collapse: treating awareness-experience as something to achieve rather than recognition of what is already present.

<classification> Sgron ma 'bar ba citation: Expanse makes awareness's own field; vajra is hanging cord; this placed within—establishes definitive Dzogchen view through tantric imagery. Phrase hanging cord refers to self-coiled nature of awareness, never requiring unknotting. Statement this placed within indicates recognition is not production of something new but recognition of what has always been present within. Term fruition in Dzogchen does not mean future attainment but recognition of ever-present ground. This is declarative finality. Risk of reification: treating fruition as something to attain rather than recognition of what has always been present. Dzogchen view recognizes vajra refers to awareness's indestructible nature, not external implement. Hanging cord is metaphorical description of awareness's self-arisen and self-coiled nature, not actual cord to untangle.

<classification> Detailed explanation of fruition operates from definitive rigpa-side. Explanation: when outer expanse-appearance eye does not move in its own time, inner rigpa abides in ground, radiance self-dissolves returning, separated from spleen-wind's horse, wisdom's sky dissolves into expanse's sky, liberating as equal-limitless without category. This describes not attainment but recognition of ever-present nature. Phrase spleen-wind's horse refers to subtle energy riding wind—the apparent movement of subtle energy when not recognized. Phrase separated from indicates that when recognition occurs, apparent separation between energy and awareness ceases. Conclusion: primordial purity's rigpa not moving from expanse, heart-center naturally clear-light intention self-naturally abides. Yogic called dharmata primordial clear-light captured, samsara name-empty, three realms corpse cut. Phrase primordial clear-light captured does not mean capturing something but recognizing what has always been present. Phrase samsara name-empty indicates samsara was never truly existent as name-entity. Phrase three realms corpse cut refers to recognition that cyclic existence was never truly real—the corpse is death of apparent reality through recognition. This is declarative finality. Risk of view-collapse: treating these as experiences to have rather than recognition-descriptions.

<classification> Thal Gyur citation on direct-appearance gnad operates from definitive rigpa-side. Citation: Therefore dharmata direct-appearance gnad—seeing merely knows, knowing realizes, realizing merely liberates, liberation is not separate—sky dissolves into sky, dissolves, self-nature unobservable, without category without parts, three realms samsara name-empty, three realms corpse cut. This is definitive pointing: liberation is not result of practice but recognition of nature's already-liberated state. Phrase seeing merely knows indicates recognition is not intellectual understanding but immediate knowing. Phrase knowing realizes indicates recognition naturally realizes without effort. Phrase realizing merely liberates establishes liberation is not produced by realization but recognized as ever-present. Phrase sky dissolves into sky indicates recognition is not transformation but revelation of what has always been. Phrase self-nature unobservable refers to awareness's self-nature being beyond objectification, not that it cannot be recognized. Phrase without category without parts indicates recognition transcends all classification, not that it is featureless. This is declarative finality. Risk of nihilism: treating liberation as elimination rather than recognition.

<classification> Wisdom-lights teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Analysis: also basis and delusion-circle nature's five-lights—establishes that awareness's five lights are recognition's own display, not caused by basis or delusion. Instruction: in water-well, eyes seeing—this is upaya describing recognition's capacity to see its own reflection. Statement: from self-born wisdom-lights, having light—establishes that five lights are awareness's own luminous quality, not external illumination. Risk of reification: treating five lights and water-well as visual techniques rather than recognition-descriptions.

<classification> Experience-increasing appearance section presents experiential dimension of recognition. Brief teaching: expanse-rigpa upwardly increasingly purified, outer expanse-appearance rigpa-snake-knot non-dually abides; inner primordial purity empty-expanse self-radiance rigpa-expanse non-dually abides, clear-light mother-child meet, various appearance-experiences increase. This describes natural unfoldment of recognition when dualistic confusion dissolves: not accumulation of experience in conventional sense but revealing of what was always present. Phrase upwardly increasingly purified indicates progressive clearing of obscurations, not progressive building of recognition. Phrase rigpa-snake-knot non-dually abides refers to awareness's self-coiled nature never separate from expanse, not actual knot. Phrase clear-light mother-child meet refers to primordial wisdom and recognition wisdom meeting—not two things meeting but recognition of their inseparability. This is instructional provisionality. Risk of view-collapse: treating experience increase as accumulation of special experiences rather than natural unfoldment of recognition.

<classification> Vessel-hook-continuum teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Instruction: in vessel-hook-continuum, thoroughly-shining—establishes that recognition is already luminous in the continuum of form, hook, continuum. Statement: also going and coming—indicates that recognition's display appears and disappears continuously, like coming and going. Teaching on grasping and destruction—this is sems-side provisional describing delusion's function: grasping at phenomena as grasp-able and destruction-possible. Risk of reification: treating vessel-hook-continuum as anatomical structure rather than metaphor for recognition-display.

<classification> Thal Gyur citation on experience-appearance increase operates from definitive rigpa-side. Citation: Experience-appearance increase upward is—wisdom color outwardly arising, upright-standing and spokes arise, various thigle as body, clear to appearing object's field, it is said. Phrase wisdom color outwardly arising indicates wisdom-display naturally manifests outwardly when recognition occurs. Phrase upright-standing and spokes arise refers to natural manifestation of five-color energy as awareness-display. Phrase various thigle as body indicates subtle energy-drops manifest as body without separation. Phrase clear to appearing object's field indicates recognition clears apparent objects by recognizing them as awareness-display. Extensive explanation: experience-increase's experience two—knowing's experience and appearance's experience. This is not dualistic separation but pedagogical presentation of recognition's experiential aspects: knowing refers to awareness's self-knowing nature; appearance refers to awareness's self-display. Risk of view-collapse: treating these as stages rather than simultaneous aspects.

<classification> Seng Ge teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Citation from Seng Ge: self-display, phenomena in vessel-hook-continuum, abiding—establishes that awareness's phenomena abide within vessel-hook-continuum of recognition-display. Citation from Nor Bu Phra: suffering—this is sems-side provisional describing how delusion manifests as suffering, like carrying heavy burden. Statement: also in that, Fully-Awakening's awareness in vessel-hook-continuum is thoroughly shining. Risk of reification: treating Seng Ge and Nor Bu Phra as mystical beings rather than authoritative citations.
