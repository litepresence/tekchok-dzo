<view>ordinary-cognition
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Three view-stance teaching: provisional for practitioners needing structured approach. Suffering's grasping destruction-impossible—definitive: suffering never truly existed. Eyes not needing—provisional: recognition never relied on eyes. From eyes side, expanse self-born—intrinsic awareness capacity.

<view>atiyoga-recognition
<classification> Awareness-experience teaching from rigpa-side: recognition not separate from dharmata-display. From affliction's door established—provisional explaining how delusion obscures. Sprin not-having in space's sphere—recognition like space: empty yet contains all appearances.

<view>great-perfection-awareness
<classification> Sgron ma 'bar ba: Expanse makes awareness's own field; vajra is hanging cord; this placed within—tantric imagery for Dzogchen view. Recognition not production but recognition—of what has always been present. Fruition means recognition of ever-present ground, not future attainment.

The three view-stances (lta ba gsum) present different perspectives: (1) ord-cognition for those needing conceptual framework, (2) dzogchen-rigpa for direct recognition, (3) their integration for advanced practitioners.

Risk: collapsing these distinctions—treating provisional statements as definitive or vice versa. The teaching requires discrimination between what points to nature and what describes practice.

The "expanse makes awareness's own field" (klong byed rig pa'i zhing) reflects Dzogchen terminology: awareness (rig pa) is not separate from expanse (klong) but is the very nature of phenomena. The "vajra hanging cord" (rdo rje lcags drul) uses tantric imagery: vajra represents indestructible awareness, the hanging cord suggests self-coiled nature—awareness reflecting on itself.

"Suffering's grasping destruction-impossible" (sdug bsngal 'dzin pa zhig tu gyur pa mi srid) is definitive meaning: suffering has no inherent existence because the grasper and grasped are empty. "Eyes not needing" (mig mi dgos pa) is provisional: from the perspective of rigpa, visual consciousness is unnecessary—but this is not nihilism.

The integration of these perspectives requires recognizing which level is being addressed: ontological statements about nature vs. pedagogical statements about practice.

This connects to the broader context of Longchenpa's system: distinguishing definitive meaning (nges don) from provisional meaning (drang don). Definitive meaning points directly to the nature; provisional meaning uses skillful means for those not ready for direct pointing.

The view-stances (lta ba gsum) framework presents: (1) ordinary cognition for practitioners needing conceptual support, (2) dzogchen rigpa for direct recognition, (3) their integration for advanced practitioners. Each has different terminology, risk of misinterpretation, and appropriate application.

The "thodgal" perspective addresses appearances: from rigpa side, all appearances are self-display (rang snang). The "threc" (khrul 'khor) addresses experiences arising from practice. Both point to same awareness but from different angles.

The "dharmata-cognition display" (chos nyid ye shessnang) presents the non-dual nature: awareness and appearance are not two. This is the basis for distinguishing rigpa from consciousness (shes pa): rigpa is self-knowing, consciousness is object-knowing.

The "three gates" (sgo gsum) framework addresses how appearances arise: through mind (sems), through consciousness (shes pa), through awareness (rig pa). Each gate has different function and risk.

The ultimate point: these distinctions are pedagogical tools, not ontological divisions. Awareness is single; the distinctions help practitioners navigate experience without reifying concepts.

This connects to Longchenpa'sdoxography: distinguishing between levels of teaching (vaipulya, tantra, ati) and appropriate capacities. The same nature described differently for different practitioners.

The "affliction's door established" (nyon mongs sgo nas grub) shows how delusion functions: through the gate of afflictions, we establish appearances as real. The remedy is recognizing through rigpa that these appearances are self-display.

The "space's sphere" (nam mkha'i dkyil 'khor) imagery: space (nam mkha) represents openness, the sphere represents totality. Recognition is like space: empty yet able to contain all appearances without being obstructed by them.

This relates to the four visions (snang ba) of thodgal: appearances arise as wisdom-display, not as external objects. The key is recognizing appearances as self-arising (rang byung) rather than other-arisen (gzhan byung).

This teaching addresses the view of recognition: not a consciousness objectifying phenomena, but awareness recognizing its own nature. This is the "self-arising" (rang shar) aspect of Dzogchen.

The view distinctions help navigate: ordinary cognition for those needing structure, dzogchen rigpa for direct pointing, integration for advanced practice. The risk is collapsing distinctions into either extreme—nihilism or eternalism about the nature.
