<classification> Lama early ones say: result not say, result three bodies attachment's extreme holding free make intended, or three circles sheath final that refute intended, contradiction removal done, meaning result place also, primordial purity's inner dharmadhatu's essence not intended transformation is, very mistaken not good. Here before accepted as path appearance also is, result also is not contradictory think, first path appearance is, spontaneous presence sheath primordial purity great that meaning result house like from, there enter and there from open ground primordial purity outer appearance dawns must. Apparent contradiction between result and non-result resolved in non-dual view. Risk of view-collapse: taking negations literally rather than as pointing to primordial completion.

<classification> Path appearance path fruition's manner path also is, that from open appearance wisdom path manner fruition also is. From Self-Arisen: Dharmakaya within spontaneous presence's essence primordial purity that path manner fruition also is. Path three: essence path dharmakaya's manner is, nature path sambhogakaya's manner is, compassion path emanation's manner is. These three one nature's different aspects, dharmakaya spontaneous presence, sambhogakaya light rays appearance, emanation wisdom's compassion's manifestations three limitless. Unity of path and fruition transcends teleological development. Risk of view-collapse: treating path as leading to future fruition rather than recognizing non-dual nature.
