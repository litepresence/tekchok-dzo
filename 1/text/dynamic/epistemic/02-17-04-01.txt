<classification> Characteristics vehicle conduct (rgyu mtshan nyid kyi theg pa'i spyod pa) presentation. Non-attachment-holding conduct operates through common path entry but not quick liberation—bound by great clinging to meaning without method. Negational clearing demonstrating that philosophical vehicles, while establishing non-attachment conceptually, still maintain subtle grasping at meaning. Risk of mistaking intellectual non-attachment for recognition of primordial freedom.

<classification> Secret mantra general conduct (gsang sngags spyi'i spyod pa) presentation. Negate-affirm-absence conduct: outer-inner secret mantra practice not desiring to stop afflictions or accomplish wisdom—word-meaning-connected conduct. Superior to characteristics vehicle through method existence, yet still effort-accomplishment. Not-yet-true conduct (yang dag spyod pa min). Negational clearing demonstrating transformative methods still operate within doing-framework, albeit refined. Risk of practicing method as liberation rather than recognition-display.

<classification> Great Perfection spontaneously-accomplished conduct (rdzogs chen lhun gyis grub pa'i spyod pa). Nature without acceptance-rejection or grasping-effort—conduct accordance with that. Space-like transcendence of directions-divisions, primordially-liberated primordial-conduct great abiding. Ati conduct: no to-do, no done, no arisen-ground; no going, no coming, no dwelling; no clinging, no attachment. Declarative assertion that conduct is recognition-expression, not practice to perform. Risk of reifying "primordial conduct" as special state to achieve.

<classification> Transition to twenty-one conducts extensive explanation from Sun-Moon Union Sutra. Bee-like conduct tasting all dharma-flavors, deer-like conduct—pedagogical framework providing recognition-vehicles through animal-metaphor conduct patterns. Provisionality of detailed conduct taxonomy as skillful means for those requiring structured approach.
