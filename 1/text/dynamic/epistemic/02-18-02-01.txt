<classification> Body conduct requiring settling: ordinary actions—running, lying, rising, moving limbs, circumambulation, prostration, head bowing—as transformative body when attachment naturally cut. Single Son of Buddha citation: whoever performs these physical actions, through cutting body-attachment, becomes transformative body.
