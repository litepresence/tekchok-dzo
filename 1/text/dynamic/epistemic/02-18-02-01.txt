Body conduct (lus kyi spyod pa) requiring settling: Ordinary actions (running, lying, rising, limb movements, circumambulation, prostration) become transformative body (sgyur pa'i sku) when attachment naturally cut. *Sangs rgyas sras gcig* and *Thal 'gyur* citations establish practice framework. Two purposes: common and supreme. Tantric-transformative methods using ordinary activities as recognition-vehicles, not Dzogchen direct recognition.

Future enlightenment through present conduct: *Bkod pa chen po'i le'u* citation on body-action reversal. Body attachment split open (lus ru shan phyed pa) for 7, 11, or 15 days—outer attachment reverses, inner body becomes peaceful, secret illusory body-light liberated. Temporal framework for tantric practice, not immediate recognition.

Settling practice (rnal du 'bebs pa): 3, 7, or 11 days of gradual body activities to transform aggregates into emanation body. *Gser gyi snying po'i rgyud* citation on contacting Buddha-kāya. Tantric preparatory practices, not direct Thogal recognition.

Speech conduct (ngag ru shan 'byed pa): Mantra, recitation, dharma sounds, various languages and animal calls—all become speech liberation when attachment cut. *Gsang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud* and *Thal 'gyur* citations. Six-realm languages spoken by mind-recollection. Speech reverses samsara, liberates letter-wheel. Tantric transformative practice.

<classification>
Speech practice results: Excellent practitioners cut attachment to that itself; average realize all appearances as same taste. Body as basis, mind as result, speech as connecting path. Various sounds spoken, confusion's verbal connection ceases. Risk of reifying "liberated speech" as special vocal capacity.

Mind conduct (sems kyi spyod pa): Joy, displeasure, pleasure, suffering, permanence, impermanence, view-meditation-conduct thoughts, dharma non-dharma, afflictions, virtue-vice—various thoughts acted upon. *Sangs rgyas sras gcig* and *Thal 'gyur* citations. Mind's attachment cut, samsara-nirvana split open. Three realms' wheel ceases through days of practice. Mind conduct reverses mind, not merely thinking.

Conduct completion recognition: Three months of practice, some liberated immediately, others gradually introduced. *Thal 'gyur* citation on completing conduct, always pressing the crucial point. Distinguishing laziness from direct introduction. Preliminary (sngon 'gro) vs. actual practice distinction.

Preliminary settling (sngon 'gro): Body preliminary—vajra posture, individual action causes cease. Speech preliminary—HUM abiding, blessing, energy training. Mind preliminary—arising, abiding, going examined. Two purposes: common (obstacles cleared, sins purified) and supreme (three gates liberated). Tantric preparation for Thogal.

Fourfold actual basis classification: Basis not actual (seeing palace, not king); actual not basis (seeing king, not recognizing); neither; both (direct recognition). King-palace simile for recognition levels. Direct seeing of Tigle's crucial point (snying tig gi gnad) liberates without further return. Distinguishes intellectual understanding from direct recognition.

<classification>
Direct pointing to actual basis: Rigpa self-settled, actually introduced, seeing vajra necklace appearance (rdo rje lu gu rgyud). Cannot be shown directly—like explaining jewel-platform without seeing it, or blind person explaining colors. Polemical distinction between intellectual description (yid dpyod) and direct recognition (mngon sum). Risk of view-collapse into conceptual understanding.

<classification>
Rigpa recognition: Good-bad, change-unchange absent—all goes from that nature, nowhere else to stray. Basis (gzhi) as non-wandering. Three signs—movement, bindu, vajra necklace—indicate rigpa liberation through wind-bindu-channel points. Signs not rigpa itself but dependent qualities indicating liberation. Risk of nihilism if signs dismissed as meaningless.

<classification>
Direct seeing liberation: Pristine wisdom's pure eye sees, liberation at that moment—like arrow in hero's heart. Dharmatā's pure eye sees, distinction distinguished at first instant. Movement-bindu-necklace signs indicate rigpa recognition requiring habituation. Risk of reifying signs as required rather than natural indicators.
