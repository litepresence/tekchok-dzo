<pedagogy>skillful-means

<pedagogy>assertive-completion
<classification> Conventional truth as phenomena appearing to confused perception, possessing functional efficacy while empty of inherent existence. Maya framework—appearance without substance. Eight examples of illusion demonstrating phenomena appear while lacking inherent existence. Conventional truth operating without contradiction.

<view>great-perfection-awareness
<pedagogy>direct-pointing
<classification> False conventional referring to ordinary deluded appearances—objects appearing as truly existent to confused perception. Defining characteristic: appearing to function while being empty when analyzed. Eight similes establishing appearance does not entail inherent existence. Not denial of appearance but recognition of empty nature.

<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> True conventional referring to virtuous phenomena functioning as causes for higher rebirth and liberation—ten virtuous actions, six perfections, path of seeing and meditation. Conventionally real and functionally effective while ultimately empty. Path-truths as compounded and therefore conventional. Conventional truth not inferior but two perspectives on same phenomena.

<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Ultimate truth as emptiness in two forms: nominal ultimate as conceptual understanding; non-nominal ultimate as direct realization beyond concepts. Definitive meaning pointing to non-nominal ultimate—rigpa beyond conceptual elaboration. Two truths not separate realities but two ways of describing experience.
