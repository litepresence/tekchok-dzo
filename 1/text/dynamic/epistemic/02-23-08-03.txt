<Masterful analysis:
The assertion that this ground (*sa*) transcends the coarse appearance of body and wisdom (*sku dang ye shes kyi snang ba rags pa las 'das pa*) marks definitive Dzogchen view. The emanation (*sprul pa*) dividing downward to benefit beings—arising from *ka dag* (primordial purity) through *lhun grub* (spontaneous presence) as ground-appearance (*gzi snang*)—describes the non-dual display: benefit is not "done to others" but awareness's self-recognition appearing as "other." The crucial instruction: the dream example (*rmi lam dpe*) clarifies that even when "benefiting beings," no benefit has occurred apart from self-appearance (*rang snang*)—this is not nihilistic denial of compassion but radical pointing to the non-dual nature of apparent "self and other." The Dzogchen integration: emanation (*sprul pa*) is not a buddha-power exercised upon beings but the natural display (*rang bzhin*) of recognition when confusion self-liberates.>

<Masterful analysis:
The three moments (*skad cig gsum*) structure describes recognition phases: first, aggregate appearances cease (*'gags*) along with four wisdom preparations (*ye shes bzhi sbyor*); second, spontaneous presence door (*lhun grub kyi sgo*) is seen; third, that also ceases, and primordial purity appearance (*ka dag gi snang ba*) is seen through self-face recognition. This is not temporal sequence but simultaneous aspects of single recognition: what appears as "three moments" is the pedagogical description of what occurs in one instant of *rig pa*. Risk of temporalization: reading this as "first this, then that, finally enlightenment" rather than recognizing all three as modalities of ever-present ground. The analogy to swift, slow, and very slow arrows (*mda' shugs*) indicates capacity differences (*dbang po rab 'bring tha ma*) in recognition-speed, not hierarchical stages to traverse—supreme faculties recognize instantly what takes others longer to stabilize, but the "recognition" itself is identical.>
