<classification> Assertion that ground transcends coarse appearance of body and wisdom marks definitive Dzogchen view. Emanation dividing downward to benefit beings—arising from primordial purity through spontaneous presence as ground-appearance—describes non-dual display: benefit is not done to others but awareness's self-recognition appearing as other. Crucial instruction: dream example clarifies that even when benefiting beings, no benefit has occurred apart from self-appearance—this is not nihilistic denial of compassion but radical pointing to non-dual nature of apparent self and other. Dzogchen integration: emanation is not buddha-power exercised upon beings but natural display of recognition when confusion self-liberates. Risk of view-collapse: treating emanation as real action rather than display.

<classification> Three moments structure describes recognition phases: first, aggregate appearances cease along with four wisdom preparations; second, spontaneous presence door is seen; third, that also ceases, and primordial purity appearance is seen through self-face recognition. This is not temporal sequence but simultaneous aspects of single recognition: what appears as three moments is pedagogical description of what occurs in one instant of awareness. Risk of view-collapse: reading as first this, then that, finally enlightenment rather than recognizing all three as modalities of ever-present ground. Analogy to swift, slow, and very slow arrows indicates capacity differences in recognition-speed, not hierarchical stages to traverse—supreme faculties recognize instantly what takes others longer to stabilize, but recognition itself is identical.
