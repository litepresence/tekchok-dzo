Four vital points (gnad bzhi): posture vital point (gnad ni 'dug stangs kyi gnad)—abiding in three kayas posture, dharmata truth realized, liberated from samsara's dharmas. Detailed in following. Channel vital point: twisting, pressing, stirring etc. through seeing transmission. Gate location: three gazes (gzhigs stangs gsum)—confused appearance transformed to clear light. Sleep and dream enhancement: sleep manner vital point called—lion-like sleeping, sleep clear light appearing basis; elephant-like sleeping, dream root emptying path eliminated. Delusion sleep abandoned, clear light equal meaning arises; desire sleep abandoned, desire eliminating basis found; anger sleep abandoned, dharmata equal absorption.

Sleep positions: sequentially face covering, lying on back, right upper raising abandoned. General meaning shown, now particular practice actual: preliminary and main part two. Preliminary: three-four days body relaxed; then three-four days body various oil massage and sun roast; soles good alcohol applied, strongly massaged; then three days limbs stretched, lying face-up, du sleep. That all channels aroused coming, leaping and reversing. Male's right leaping strong, sandalwood and seng ldeng's hot water applied, soft cloth from outside warmed. Thus doing vital point great. Risk: literalizing sleep positions as mechanical techniques rather than supports for recognition.

Main part: wind-favorable food and good alcohol gradually accustomed; males left flank below inserted sleeping; females right below inserted sleeping—channels each function changing vital point. That channels leaping aroused coming, whatever blazing and strong, ru rta's me rtsa gentle doing. Ring finger: right leaping channel whatever strong all pressed, first bean-seven weight, gradually more more pressing, wind inward held, again outside strongly released, again inward inhaling strongly. Thus consciousness sunk gone time risen, throat right twisted, throat right shoulder-top placed, right hand from throat's outer, leaping weak channel upward moving one exists, that first seven bean weight pressed.

Then gradually more fourteen and twenty-one weight pressing, first misty, karma and affliction channels abandoning experience; then clear lion appearance coming, wisdom's seeing natural object; then khral khrol appearance, wisdom variously pure path actualized experience. That changing time opportunity guru supplicate, path appropriate doing. Not thus done, wind breath lost channels fallen, consciousness 'ur ba coming possible. Then session divided, long time done, clear light great experience residue with appearing. Thus always done, body numb and touch exhausted, channels' object empty. Mar nag and gu gul mixed massage. Mind's various concepts all ceased, clear light great experience abiding, great wisdom bindu vital point arrived. Risk: conflating these tantric techniques with Dzogchen's effortless recognition.

Three aspects: definite moving location general presentation; definite transference location particular explanation; wisdom and karma wind definite conclusion. General: body channels abiding, channels wind abiding, wind great-small two moving; outer and inner moving. Great moving wind: healthy youth disease-free, one day 21,600 outer-inner moving definite; especially nose-mouth excepted channels' inside conceptuality and wisdom's support small moving wind leaping channels moving, 107,600 inner moving.
