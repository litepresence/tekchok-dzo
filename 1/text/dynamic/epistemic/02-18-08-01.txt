<classification> Fourfold extensive explanation of individual natures operates within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Fourfold structure: (1) direct appearance; (2) experience-increase; (3) rigpa-measure-reached; (4) dharmata-exhaustion-appearance. Detailed analysis of direct appearance includes two aspects: (1) general connection-establishment—recognizing fundamental connection between appearance and awareness; (2) individual characteristic ascertainment—recognizing unique characteristics of each appearance. Four types: (1) conventional direct appearance appearing as five sense-objects; (2) mental direct appearance appearing as conceptual certainty; (3) self-awareness direct appearance experiencing internal bliss/suffering; (4) yogic direct appearance encountering suchness, entering suchness, rigpa and appearance-object non-dual, free from grasping experience certainty. This is instructional provisionality. Risk of reification: treating four types as rigid categories rather than recognition-descriptions.

<classification> Definitive teaching on relationship operates from rigpa-side of Dzogchen view. Opening: from all phenomena, mind gathered and within that, self-nature ego-less—establishes definitive ground: all dharmas are mind-display; within that display, self-nature is ego-less, not something to establish. Statement that seeing with eyes the body, and intention causes self-grasping's intention to arise—this is instructional provisionality describing how ordinary cognition operates, not definitive mode. Instruction that intention should settle into expanse is skillful means for redirecting self-grasping toward recognition. Crucial gnad: awareness's essence is dharmata itself—establishes awareness is not some phenomenon but nature of all phenomena. Risk of view-collapse: treating "mind gathering" as mental process rather than recognizing awareness's primordial state.

<classification> Self-resonance teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Description: from its self-resonance, heart connecting with eyes outer self-display and light-resonance—establishes that recognition is aware of its own display as itself, not subject-object relationship. "Outer self-display" refers to awareness's capacity to manifest; "light-resonance" refers to luminous quality. Citation from Rang Byung: from appearance and cessation two, this is cessation-gnosis. Risk of reification: treating self-resonance and light-resonance as subtle energies to cultivate rather than descriptions of awareness's self-knowing quality.

<classification> Four-teaching presentation operates as instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from structured analysis. Four teachings: (1) circle with phenomena—teaching within cyclic existence; (2) meditation—teaching on passing beyond; (3) emptiness with phenomena—teaching on emptiness of dharmas; (4) no gnad—teaching on liberation. Statement that therefore exists liberation—this is definitive declaration: liberation is not through gnad-accomplishment but through recognizing chos nyid. Gnad that awareness-grasping is non-separated establishes that awareness never grasps at phenomena as other. Risk of reification: treating four teachings as separate doctrines rather than recognition-descriptions from different angles.

<classification> Affliction analysis operates from two perspectives. First, definitive: affliction is affliction's object—this describes delusion's function as grasping at phenomena as truly existent. Second, provisional: also not relying on intellect whenever wisdom analyzes—upāya describing limitation of intellect: wisdom never finds anything to eliminate because nothing truly exists to eliminate. Statement that not possessing mind and light, possessing light is not—this operates from sems-side to dispel clinging to form. Risk of nihilism: interpreting "nothing to eliminate" as mere absence rather than recognition of primordial state.

<classification> Definitive teaching on gnad operates from rigpa-side of Dzogchen view. Opening gnad: within mind, dharmata-object—establishes that recognition's relationship to its own display is not subject-object relationship but self-recognition. Gnad of practice's door—the path to enter. This is instructional provisionality describing how recognition recognizes itself through entering into practice. Risk of reification: treating gnad as mystical point rather than recognition-key.

<classification> Wind-resting teaching operates from sems-side pedagogy for practitioners who benefit from structured path. Three gnads: (1) wind's dwelling-place—where awareness abides; (2) path-eliminated by three—what path eliminates; (3) resting, meditation and practicing-capacity's sequence—how recognition stabilizes. Meditation sequences: meditation's sequence, worn-out sequence, and three practicing-holding together—these are structural descriptions, not temporal stages. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating meditation sequences as graduated practices rather than recognition-descriptions.

<classification> Analysis of fragile phenomena operates from definitive rigpa-side establishing that phenomena appear as fragile, impermanent, without essence but are grasped at as having self-nature. Teaching: from expanse wisdom analyzes the affliction's basis—indicates recognition sees through phenomena's lack of essence, does not eliminate anything. Statement that light-display is not having form-possessing—this is definitive: awareness's display never possesses form as inherent quality. Risk of view-collapse: mixing sutric negation (phenomena are fragile) with Dzogchen recognition (awareness sees through lack of essence)—former provisional, latter definitive.

<classification> Three-body teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Statement that lamaless, appearing—establishes that recognition's display is self-manifesting, not requiring external teacher. Citation from Rang Byung: resting thigle and accomplishment by three, body—indicates three kayas are not sequential attainments but simultaneous recognition-aspects. Statement: essence-body's self-resonance inner, appearance-awareness empty—establishes that essence-body is awareness's empty inner display. Risk of view-collapse: treating three bodies as separate entities rather than aspects of single recognition.

<classification> Continuation of three-body analysis operates from definitive rigpa-side. Description of Sambhogakaya-body's self-resonance outer, light-resonance clearly appearing, wisdom self-resonance—establishes that enjoyment-body is recognition's luminous outer display. Emanation-body's self-resonance, liberating, difference-free wisdom-analysis—establishes that emanation-body liberates through recognition's display. Gnad that basis by three established—definitive: recognition-basis is not established by three kayas but manifests as them. Risk of view-collapse: treating three bodies as ontologically distinct rather than recognition's three modes of display.

<classification> Three-points gnad operates from definitive rigpa-side. Instruction that body, speech, and mind's three points establish the basis—not to create basis but to recognize that recognition's expression through body-speech-mind is already the basis. Statement: form-possessing is breaking, spoiling—establishes that phenomena's apparent self-nature is their fragility, not intrinsic quality. Three points are recognition-coordinates, not techniques to apply. Gnad: form-possessing's essence points to recognition of what form actually is (display) versus what it appears to be (possessing essence). Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating three points as structural exercises rather than recognition-descriptions.

<classification> Unborn-Gnosis teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side of Dzogchen view. Statement that Unborn-Gnosis, fully-awakening by wisdom—establishes that recognition is wisdom's own awakening, not through accumulation. Instruction to see formless-emptiness's pure display—this is upāya pointing to recognition's capacity to see beyond form. Citation from Vajra and Precious-One connects to tantras that establish definitive path. Risk of view-collapse: treating "seeing formless-emptiness" as visual meditation rather than recognizing awareness's formless nature.

<classification> Threefold path-practice-fruition teaching operates as instructional provisionality for structured recognition. Teaching: (1) path, three eliminated obstructions—path eliminates obstacles directly, no distance; (2) practice, three placed in ground, no-obstructions—practice is grounded, no blocking; (3) fruition, three exhausted fully—fruition is exhaustion of delusion, not addition. Statement that not-abiding, not-changing—indicates that recognition never enters or changes. Risk of view-collapse: treating path-practice-fruition as chronological progression rather than simultaneous recognition-aspects.
