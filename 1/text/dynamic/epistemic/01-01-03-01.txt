<classification> Vajradhara (rdo rje 'chang) as nature of complete qualities (yon tan rdzogs pa'i rang bzhin) awakening to bodhi—not achievement but recognition of primordial state. Dharmakaya arising as Sambhogakaya demonstrates sku gsum as display-modes of single gnosis, not sequential production. Five-family bodies (rigs lnga'i sku) manifesting immeasurable pure fields from central Vairocana essence-ornament. Twenty-five stacked realms (nyi shu rtsa lnga brtsegs mar) with Jambudvipa as thirteenth indicates mandala-geometry encoding recognition-topology. Declaration: all fields arise from dharmata-nature, not external creation.

<classification> Sgra thal 'gyur (Sound Unfolding) tantra citation anchoring cosmology in Dzogchen scriptural authority. First Thal field: Thalwa Dbyangs (Sound-of-Vajra) below world—vast extent (rgya khyon), cause-condition-nature triad (rgyu dang rkyen dang rang bzhin), retinue of Teacher's teaching. Second field: Thalwa 'Dzin (Vajra-Holding) below six worlds—wheel-shaped ('khor lo'i dbyibs), completely pure (zang thal), truth itself (bden pa nyid). Tantric transformative framework presenting fields as skillful means for beings at different capacities. Provisionality: these are recognition-states, not external locations.

<classification> Third field: Thalwa Skyob (Vajra-Protection) to right of three worlds—ornamented by mothers (ma rged), light and color clear ('od dang kha dog nges gsal), Vinaya field ('dul ba'i zhing). Fourth field: Thalwa Brdal (Vajra-Breakthrough) above six worlds—lotus-blossom shaped (padma rgyas pa'i dbyibs), extremely expansive (shin tu brdal), various lights blazing (sna tshogs 'od 'bar), white-red appearing (dkar dmar snang ba), coarse forms not appearing (rags pa'i gzugs snang min). Abhidharma extensive teaching (chos mtha'). Risk of literalizing these visionary fields as physical locations rather than recognition-topology.

<classification> Fifth field: Thalwa's Drum above world—nineteen beyond (bcu dgu 'das pa), vast delightful (rab tu ljongste nyams dga'), ornamented by jewel fragments (rin chen sil ma), Prajnaparamita and Yogacara teaching (rdzogs gnyis ldan). Sixth field: Thalwa's Current northeast—stupa-shaped (mchod rten dbyibs), terraced beautiful (bang rim mdzes), five arrangements (bkod pa lnga), basis of various sounds (sgra dbyangs sna tshogs). Seventh field: complete purity pervading at twenty-one—nature of pure perception (dmigs pa dag pa'i rang bzhin), without outer or inner (phyi dang nang med), dependent arising teaching (rten 'byung). Progressive refinement from coarse to subtle recognition.

<classification> Eighth through tenth Thal fields continuation: Sound, Wind, Jewel-Thal—with specific locations, symbolic attributes, and corresponding teachings. Eleventh field: Taming Thal emphasizing mnyam pa (equality) as recognition-quality. Twelfth and thirteenth fields completing enumeration: Dung-ldan Thal, Star Thal field. Tantric transformative cosmology presenting mandala-geometry as visionary framework for recognition. Each field corresponds to specific vehicle teaching—provisional pedagogical mapping.

<classification> Concluding verses establishing causal condition pervading all (rgyu rkyen khyab 'jug). Thirteen fields mapped to: (1) general cause, (2) Vinaya, (3) Karma, (4) Abhidharma, (5) Prajnaparamita/Yogacara, (6) Mantra, (7) Dependent arising—each teaching vehicle corresponds to field-type. From Dzogchen view: all thirteen fields are none other than rigpa-nature—self-appearing luminosity (rang snang 'od gsal) manifesting as diverse recognition-fields. Interpenetration principle (sdong po bkod pa): each field contains whole, all simultaneous. Risk of reifying as physical cosmography rather than recognition-topology.
