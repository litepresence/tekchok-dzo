<classification> From Self-Arisen: Ground called elsewhere existing not. Truth-seeing person one to grounds all complete existing. Introduction-shown person that, first truth-seeing's time joy arisen is first ground Great Joy. That self-vision awareness-ground second ground Stainless obtained. Then habituation third ground Light-Doing. Habituated light's vision seeing fourth ground Light-Radiating. Fifth Difficult-to-Overcome, sixth Manifest, seventh Far-Going, eighth Immovable, ninth Perfect Intellect, tenth Cloud-Dharma. All ten grounds are complete in one moment of truth-seeing. Risk of view-collapse: reading these as sequential rather than simultaneous.

<classification> Thirteen letter wheel gathering great ground conquered. Then wisdom's appearance abiding fourteenth ground Great Samadhi conquered. Then spontaneous presence ground certainty obtained fifteenth ground Vajra-Holder obtained. The enumeration continues but all are primordially complete. Risk of reification: treating higher numbers as better rather than recognizing all as descriptions of one ground.
