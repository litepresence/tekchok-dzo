<classification> First: from ground ground-appearance arises, deluded by three ignorances and four conditions. Self-arisen: friends, pure Buddha not having delusion, yet Vajrasattva from ground beginning delusion system. Deluded from Yul Yangs Can, from Gnas Mdzes Ldan, at time Nam Sros, in Pig year, on emanated sun day, in Bya star. Human name Rgan Po Ling Tog Can, lineage uncertain. Four Rogs Mi done, five Mi Rgod Pa arose, one Rgyab Rten Pa arose, one Rkun Mo arose, all gathered one arose. Countless army hosts arose, all deluded immeasurably. From that delusion basis non-existent arose. Risk of literalizing narrative as historical.
