<classification> Self-appearance known, gradually certainty obtained—seven. Twenty-one primordial purity liberated, not-yet-dissolved between, emanation spread, primordial purity dissolved. Enumeration of seven stages and twenty-one moments is instructional provisionality, describing process of recognition for those who require gradual unfolding. Risk of view-collapse: mistaking numerical markers as ontological realities rather than pedagogical scaffolding. View remains Dzogchen—primordially complete—but path accommodates gradual recognition.

<classification> Twenty-one moments equal, but meditation's days many-few exist, senses sharp-dull placed. Those days moments joined, senses appearance-mode and days enumeration, emanation division manner different. From Self-Arisen: some white color liberated, some yellow color liberated, some red color liberated, some green color liberated, some blue color liberated, some five colors liberated, some bindu light liberated—that is final liberation manner. Various colors and bindus indicate different recognition modes, not hierarchical stages. Final liberation manner is definitive—each path leads to same recognition. Risk of reification: treating colors as separate achievements rather than aspects of single recognition.

<classification> Final senses liberation manner thus: final ground obtained—fourteen days taken. That is final ground. Specification of fourteen days for final ground serves as temporal marker for completion of recognition. Risk of view-collapse: creating hierarchies of practitioners based on time-to-recognition rather than understanding that all recognition is equally primordial.

<classification> Spontaneous presence stability continues. Final recognition is not achievement but revelation of what was always present. All temporal markers are provisional—recognition itself is timeless.
