Seven moments structure: Self-appearance gradually arising, abiding, certainty obtained—twenty-one moments to primordial purity liberation. Enumeration is instructional provisionality for gradual recognition, not temporal ontology. Risk of reifying moments as sequential stages rather than aspects of single recognition.

Twenty-one moments equal but meditation days vary by faculties sharp-dull. *Rang shar* citation: various liberation modes—white, yellow, red, green, blue, five colors, bindu light. Multiple recognition paths, not hierarchical achievements. Risk of color-reification as separate attainments.

Bardo body characteristics: Flesh-blood-rang-ka form absent, yet faculties complete through habit propensities. Mind-becoming (yid kyi srid pa) not actual body-taking. Polemical distinction from solid-body views. Risk of ordinary-cognition literalization of "dream body" as physical form.

Bardo etymology: "Bar" = interval between reality-appearance setting and six-class body not taken; "Srid" = emanation-body birth, god-human birth, bad-destiny birth, or liberation. Interval-recognition as joining-center. Not substantial intermediate state but recognition opportunity.

Comprehensive bardo summary: Water-mill samsara circling, flesh-blood separated, illusion-mind form, before-appearance ceases, after not arising, class indefinite. Essence: Self-knowing awareness clear. Final verses on recognition: Pure awareness clear, impure unclear—all from virtue-vice propensities. This all miraculous birth. Closing declaration: Becoming bardo thus explained.
