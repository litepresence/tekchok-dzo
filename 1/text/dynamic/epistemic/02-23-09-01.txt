Seven moments structure: Self-appearance gradually arising, abiding, certainty obtained—twenty-one moments to primordial purity liberation. Enumeration is instructional provisionality for gradual recognition, not temporal ontology. Risk of reifying moments as sequential stages rather than aspects of single recognition.

Twenty-one moments equal but meditation days vary by faculties sharp-dull. *Rang shar* citation: various liberation modes—white, yellow, red, green, blue, five colors, bindu light. Multiple recognition paths, not hierarchical achievements. Risk of color-reification as separate attainments.

Faculty grades liberation timetable: Supreme (14 days), Peak (15 days), Transcendent (16 days), Excellent (17 days), Intermediate (19 days). Temporal markers for recognition-completion, not fixed durations. Spontaneous presence stability obtained through self-appearance recognition—provisional framework, not metaphysical commitments.

Becoming bardo instructions: Dream-like appearance, instantaneous object-entry, miraculous power, ten-direction emanation field projection. Tantric-transformative methods for those not recognizing self-appearance. *Gser phreng* citation on self-appearance natureless knowing. Provisional techniques, not definitive view.

Twenty aspects of becoming bardo: Circling manner, definitive meaning, characteristics, clairvoyance, miraculous power, life measure, color, head direction, karma accumulation, signs, name enumeration, body measure, birth place recognition, conduct difference, light measure, karma connection, afflictions connection, realm classification, womb entry signs, examples. Comprehensive taxonomy for recognition, not ontological inventory.

Bardo body characteristics: Flesh-blood-rang-ka form absent, yet faculties complete through habit propensities. Mind-becoming (yid kyi srid pa) not actual body-taking. Polemical distinction from solid-body views. Risk of ordinary-cognition literalization of "dream body" as physical form.

Bardo etymology: "Bar" = interval between reality-appearance setting and six-class body not taken; "Srid" = emanation-body birth, god-human birth, bad-destiny birth, or liberation. Interval-recognition as joining-center. Not substantial intermediate state but recognition opportunity.

Bardo clairvoyance: Previous reality-bardo seeds manifest here. Container-contents dimensions, time, destruction known instantaneously like mirror reflection. Miraculous power arises from enjoyment-body capacity. Risk of reifying powers as personal achievements rather than natural display.

Miraculous power characteristics: Unobstructed passage, entering solid objects, form-size indefiniteness. Continuity from enjoyment-body capacity; instant arising-ceasing, dream-like memory gaps. Bardo life-measure: Seven days base, up to forty-nine days maximum. Seven death-birth cycles possible. Not literal physiology but recognition-framework.

Karma accumulation mechanism: Coarse karma not accumulated, subtle latency gathered through mind-power. Bar-ma (intermediate karma) as latency for next life. Interdependent origination continues through propensities, not substantial karma-transfer.

Comprehensive bardo summary: Water-mill samsara circling, flesh-blood separated, illusion-mind form, before-appearance ceases, after not arising, class indefinite. Essence: Self-knowing awareness clear. Final verses on recognition: Pure awareness clear, impure unclear—all from virtue-vice propensities. This all miraculous birth. Closing declaration: Becoming bardo thus explained.
