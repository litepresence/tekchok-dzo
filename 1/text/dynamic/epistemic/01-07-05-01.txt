<classification> Chapter conclusion marking completion of seventh house of the Treasury. Transition from empowerment and samaya topics to definitive meaning of basis, path, and fruit. Primordially pure dharmadhatu as ultimate truth, vajra mandala as spontaneously accomplished. Risk of practice abandonment—negations apply from recognition, not confusion. Teaching discriminating, not universal.
