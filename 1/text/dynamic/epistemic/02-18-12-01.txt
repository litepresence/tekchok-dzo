<classification> Non-dual resting teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Five-thigle non-dual recognition's appearance wisdom five—this establishes recognition rests in the union of five-thigle and wisdom. Risk of view-collapse: treating five-thigle and wisdom as separate entities rather than non-dual recognition.

<classification> Recognition-gathering teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Recognition's thigle and connection are not different—this establishes non-duality. Statement: therefore recognition's experience unfolds like ordinary mind's appearance—indicates that recognition's experience appears ordinary yet contains the gnad of resting in non-duality. Risk of reification: treating thigle as substance rather than recognition-display mode.

<classification> That itself rim-enclosing wall and individual main retinue appearance—Dharmakaya's purification completely pure measure-reached arising. This is rigpa-measure-reached appearance: preliminary times body's actions and doings' connection measure, afterward non-arising sign. Also: though appearing those appearances from preliminary antidotes etc. crucial point, labeled arisen, they are labelers of separation-result and purification-purifier cause-effect, not produced from that arising—wisdom self-existing radiance's stain obscurations purified through power of appearance. The Dzogchen view: these appearances are not produced by practice but revealed through recognition. Thal Gyur citation: Rigpa-measure-reached appearance: Sambhogakaya's marks examples clear; uncertain color rainbow from; five families father-mother appearing. Bstan bu: Likewise body up to: six and ten and five-three; unerringly Sambhogakaya. Individual nature: measure-reached definitive terminology generally shown and measure-three particular explained—two. First: rigpa-measure-reached means ground-abiding rigpa manifestly became, path-channel entered, ground-appearance's self-radiance spontaneous present arising-door body-appearance, path-appearance near exhaustion, mandala complete. Measure: first half-body to body's mandala complete. Reached: from that transcended without remainder clearly appearing. These like full moon form—waxing-waning mandala complete, self-face incontrovertible. Second, measure-three particular: outer appearance, inner body measure, secret rigpa measure. First: power-over appearance, pure realm clear-light complete. Dzogchen integration: measure is not quantity but recognition's fullness; reached is not destination but realization there was never anywhere to go. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: believing measure-reached is goal achieved through antidotes rather than recognition of ever-present wisdom.

<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Ordinary-mind-experience teaching operates as instructional provisionality from sems-side for structured path. Gnad: therefore cognition—this is upāya indicating that practitioners recognize that experience is not subject to time. Statement: not separate—establishes that delusion and emptiness appear separate but are not different. Risk of view-collapse: treating ordinary mind experience as state to achieve rather than recognition-description.
