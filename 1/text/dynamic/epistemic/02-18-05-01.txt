<classification> Thal Gyur citation on speech training presents four-phase graduated upāya for practitioners whose predominant pattern is speech/desire (bird-type): (1) Training—reduce speaking, cut ordinary conversation, begin with short sessions then extend; (2) Abiding—do not reject mantras yet do not mix syllables with others; (3) Recitation—all mantra-recitation ceases; (4) Stabilization—without speaking, not departing from that state, not using body-gestures. During this process, one understands meaning of body-signs. This is instructional provisionality for gradual path practitioners. Risk of nihilism: interpreting silence value as end itself rather than recognition-support. Dzogchen view recognizes "cutting speech" is not suppression but recognition that speech has never been other than awareness's self-expression.

<classification> Sa bon gyi rgyud citation operates from definitive rigpa-side pointing to ultimate nature of speech training. Citation: "Speech, however blocked, without any sign-making with anyone, thus, whoever does this, mind's scattering and gathering self-decides." This establishes that speech-training ultimately reveals self-liberated nature of mind. "Scattering and gathering" refers to mind's ordinary movement; "self-decides" means this movement naturally self-resolves, not through suppression but through recognition that movement and stillness are not truly separate. "However blocked" indicates blocking speech is provisional; definitive point is speech's nature never needed blocking. This is declarative finality: recognition that speech, thought, and awareness are one nature. Risk of nihilism: treating "silence" as ultimate state rather than recognizing speech as awareness-display.

<classification> Progression from speech-training to body-training to mind-training represents tantric subtle body methodology leading toward Dzogchen recognition. Training effects operate as instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from gradual path: (1) Through cutting speech, unspeakable meaning arises in continuum; (2) Through not mixing speech with others, body is trained—without body-training, buddhas and bodhisattvas cannot bless; body becomes trained as illusory body liberated; (3) Through cutting expressed-objects, speech is trained, signs appear: meeting non-human guides, communication with unseen beings; (4) Through cutting speech-expression, mind is trained, signs appear: previously unseen non-human forms, then clairvoyance dawns piece by piece. This is instructional provisionality. Risk of reification: treating these "signs" and "accomplishments" as goals rather than recognition-confirmations. Dzogchen view recognizes all "attainments" are self-liberation-display.

<classification> Crucial instruction on cutting body-mind connection through speech-gnad operates from definitive rigpa-side. Mind-gnad instruction: gaze into expanse of space without thinking anything—not spatial gazing but recognition of awareness's own expanse. Thal Gyur citation: "Mind is accomplished through placing in expanse"—mind's accomplishment is not attainment of new state but recognition of its nature as expanse. When body and speech are controlled, mind naturally follows, space-rigpa dawns, and element-bonds sever. This establishes that all training is preparation for recognition: when gross activity settles, mind reveals itself as space-rigpa awareness. Risk of view-collapse: treating "placing mind in expanse" as meditative absorption rather than direct recognition. Dzogchen view recognizes "element-bonds severing" refers to recognizing elements were never truly binding; severing is recognition of self-liberation.

<classification> Citations establishing threefold training structure operate within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Opening statement: "Training body, speech, and mind, becoming accustomed to dharmata's appearance, thus one becomes accustomed"—through systematic training, one habituates to recognizing awareness's own display. Second citation: "Knowing the gnad of body, speech, and mind and applying it, one liberates from cyclic existence"—knowledge must be coupled with application for liberation. These citations from tantric sources operate as instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from structured path. Risk of reification: treating threefold training as necessary stages rather than recognition-facilitating conditions. Dzogchen view recognizes body, speech, mind are not separate entities but display-modes of single awareness.

<classification> Definitive statement about second purpose—placing on one's own threshold the three gnads for direct recognition. Threefold structure: (1) Binding the three gnads in vajra constraint; (2) Giving the self-face of direct recognition; (3) Showing the mode of appearance from that. This establishes direct recognition requires preparation: "vajra constraint" refers to unbreakable nature of three gnads when properly understood; "self-face" refers to recognition of awareness's own face without mediation; "mode of appearance" refers to how awareness-display manifests from recognition. Subdivision: showing general constraint of three gnads and placing on individual gnad—understanding general principle must be followed by personal application. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating "vajra constraint" as fixed method rather than recognition's unshakeable nature.

<classification> Detailed explanation of three gnads—door, object, and wind-rig—operates within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Thal Gyur citation establishes: "The three gnads should not be separated from secret instruction"—they are door, object, and wind-rig gnads. Metaphorical elaboration: door-gnad like guard, object-gnad like guest, wind-rig gnad like butcher. Functional description: door-gnad makes seeing happen, object-gnad makes unchanging, wind-rig gnad places signs onto measure. This is instructional provisionality. Analogy with lethal points: just as striking vital point makes one feel nothing regardless of activity, so three gnads transform one into dharmata—not gradually but instantly. Necessity of all three: without object-gnad, no basis for support; without door-gnad, losing path of going; without wind-rig gnad, awareness does not resolve inward. Therefore these three are definite: not more—infinite would lose the gnad; not fewer—purpose would not be accomplished. Risk of reification: treating door, object, wind-rig as anatomical structures rather than recognition-coordinates. Dzogchen view recognizes these three are modes of recognition, not entities.

<classification> Second subdivision—placing on one's own individual gnad—operates from definitive rigpa-side as direct introduction. Contains two aspects: determining general order of three gnads and placing on each individual gnad. "General order" indicates sequential recognition process, but Dzogchen view recognizes all three operate simultaneously, not sequentially. "Determining" means recognizing definitively these three are necessary and sufficient. "Placing on each individual gnad" refers to direct application of each gnad in one's own experience—not theoretical understanding but experiential recognition. Opening: "body, speech, mind unmoving and controlling door, object, and wind-rig"—establishes state for applying gnads: when gross activity settles, subtle gnads become accessible. This is declarative finality: awareness is not achieved through controlling gnads but through recognizing gnads are awareness's own display. Risk of view-collapse: treating "general order" as temporal sequence rather than pedagogical presentation.

<classification> Citations establishing necessity of oral transmission and subtle body practice operate within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Rang Byung Rig Pa'i Tantra citation: "Thus, by thoroughly pressing all body-points, rigpa itself directly—known from guru's oral transmission." This establishes gnad-pressing is not mere technique but preparation for direct recognition through authentic lineage. Thal Gyur elaboration describes mechanics of subtle body practice within Dzogchen context: actual basis relied upon in continuum, body-point and speech and mind-point relied upon, wind made slow, excellently projected, from this body-mind's connection severed, not reversing even in three realms. This is instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from physical-energetic preparation. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating "pressing gnads" and "making wind slow" as manipulations rather than recognition-facilitating conditions. Dzogchen view recognizes "body-mind connection severed" means recognizing they were never truly separate.

<classification> Concise definition of three gnads operates from definitive rigpa-side pointing to recognition. Statement: "Door is three-kaya eyes seeing, object is free from obscurations, slow wind-rigpa accomplishes wisdom." This provides recognition-coordinates: (1) Door refers to three kayas as three ways awareness sees itself—not external forms but awareness's own display as trikaya; (2) Object refers to whatever is perceived being free from obscurations—not that objects lack veils but that recognition sees all appearances as already free; (3) Slow wind-rigpa refers to natural settled state of subtle energy and awareness when not agitated by dualistic grasping, which naturally accomplishes wisdom. "Slow" indicates natural settling, not forced suppression. This is declarative finality. Risk of reification: treating door, object, wind-rig as separate entities to master rather than recognition-aspects of single awareness.

<classification> Detailed instruction on door-gnad operates within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Opening: ordinary seeing-mode does not dawn wisdom, therefore train in three-kaya seeing-modes. This establishes ordinary perception is not wrong but incomplete for recognition; three-kaya seeing-modes are not new ways to see but recognition of how awareness has always seen. Dpal Nam Mkha' Dang Mnyam Pa'i Rgyud citation describes three kayas' functions: (1) Dharmakaya seeing-mode—pressing three realms' samsara, seeing all samsara as already pressed into dharmata; (2) Sambhogakaya—samsara's basis not destroyed, recognition sees without destroying appearances; (3) Nirmanakaya—liberating into buddha-fields, manifestation-liberation. Additional citations: Yi Ge Med Pa—eye examined in space-element; Gsang Ba Sgra Rgyud—three seeing-modes: casting down, turning back, glancing. This is instructional provisionality. Risk of view-collapse: treating three-kaya seeing as visualizations to create rather than recognition of awareness's own seeing. Dzogchen view recognizes these "modes" are not sequential practices but descriptions of how recognition sees—all three kayas simultaneously present.
