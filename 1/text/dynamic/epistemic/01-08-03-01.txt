<classification> Fifth position analysis—awareness essence direction not everywhere arising. Refutation: if whatever accepted, does it dwell in basis or not? If dwell, permanent-impermanent both established together. If impermanent established but permanent not, whatever-acceptance is damaged. Samsara liberates without effort, liberation reverts. Like second position, rabbit horns and barren woman's son make samsara-nirvana, limitless faults. Imputation critique: accepting "whatever" allows absurdities.

<classification> Sixth position analysis—essence arising everywhere, accepting variegated variety appearance. Refutation: is variety outer appearance, inner consciousness, or both gathered? If variety like base is one-only, fault of variety as outer arising. Analysis of variety as basis characteristic. Problem: one basis cannot produce manifold variety without losing unity.

<risk>nihilism
<classification> Six positions refuted. Exhaustive refutation demonstrates NO conceptual characterization of basis is tenable. Not nihilism but establishing-negation: basis cannot be established through conceptuality. All positions are directional projections, conceptual elaborations. Actual basis free from elaboration. Risk: intellectual satisfaction with refutation, missing pointing beyond.
