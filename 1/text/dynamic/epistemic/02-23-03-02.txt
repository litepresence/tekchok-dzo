<classification> Opening of transference section operates from sems-side pedagogical framework, presenting transference as method for practitioners who have not recognized nature of mind. Longchenpa establishes prerequisites: practitioner must have received empowerment, kept samaya vows, practiced the path. Epistemic stance begins as instructional—transference is something to be learned and executed. However, passage contains subtle shift toward rigpa-side when citing Thal Gyur to establish that even this method is ultimately unnecessary for one who has recognized awareness. Citation "to transfer is to not transfer" marks view-stratification: what appears as technique from conventional perspective is revealed as spontaneous recognition from definitive perspective. Passage operates within Dzogchen pedagogy dialectic—presenting methods while undermining attachment to them. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating transference as technique to perform rather than recognition of what is.

<risk>reification
<classification> Three prerequisites—empowerment, samaya, practice—establish sems-side context: transference is not technique for beginners but for those with foundation. Requirement of empowerment indicates tantric framework; samaya indicates commitment to view; practice indicates integration. This is gradual path structure preserved within Dzogchen exposition. Risk of reification: treating prerequisites as achievements rather than recognition-facilitating conditions.

<classification> Description of consciousness exiting through crown aperture into Buddha-fields operates within tantric physiology—channels, winds, and drops. Visualization of Amitabha and lotus seats represents Sambhogakaya display. However, epistemic warning: this is not describing actual journey of soul-entity but pedagogical framework for those still operating within reified self-view. Going and arriving are instructional fictions. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating as literal journey rather than recognition-description.

<pedclarative-finality
<risk>nihilism
<classification> Longchenpa's pivot to Thal Gyur citation marks view-shift. Recognition that there is nowhere to go and no one to go establishes definitive view. Transference, from rigpa-side, is recognition that one has never moved from primordial ground. Transferring is merely conceptual overlay on what is spontaneously present. This is quintessential Dzogchen move: using gradual path as finger pointing to what transcends all paths. Risk of nihilism: interpreting nowhere to go as excuse for no practice.
