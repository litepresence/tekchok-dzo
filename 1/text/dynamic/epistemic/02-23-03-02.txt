<classification> Red A-letter transference technique—combining visualization of red A with consciousness projection. "Piercing upward" (gyen yal) indicates directionality toward crown aperture, ultimate gateway for consciousness exit in tantric physiology. Technical instruction: consciousness mounted on wind-vehicle exits through brahma-aperture. Risk: literalizing as spatial journey rather than recognition of unimpeded nature.

<classification> Forceful transference technique for benefitting others—drawing another's consciousness into oneself through HUM visualization. "Wisdom drawn into my own rigpa" indicates tantric capacity to affect other's stream through accomplished practice. Physiological details: breath retention, forceful suction, subtle body intervention. Requires empowerment, samaya, and accomplishment prerequisites. Risk of reification: treating as mechanical procedure rather than wisdom-display.

<classification> Recognition moment at death—when appearances arise, this is dharmata bardo self-arising, not external realm. "This is it—nothing else" (rang nang 'di ka yin gyis gzhen ma yin) asserts immediate recognition without seeking elsewhere. Three recognitions: appearance-recognition, instruction-hearing, certainty. Non-conceptual samadhi attainment as Buddhahood certainty. Risk: nihilistic reading as denial of appearances rather than liberation-through-recognition.

<classification> Sun Moon Union citation establishing authoritative grounding for transference practice. Three gates opened, breath held, drawn, projected—YAM A HAM seed syllable integration for body-speech-mind empowerment. Strengthening body and mind through repeated application. Risk: fixation on technique mechanics rather than wisdom-essence.

<classification> Six signs of death and rebirth destinations—external thermal signs indicating internal consciousness trajectory. Crown-heat upward: god realm; sole-heat downward: hell; right-armpit: asura; throat: preta; bluish vision: animal; eye-heat: human. Systematic correspondences between physiological dissolution and rebirth. Ordinary cognition framework: empirical observation for prediction, not recognition-based liberation.

<classification> Special animal-rebirth signs: armpit heat, facial contortions, animal sounds, obscured vision—external-internal sign convergence. Purification rituals for rebirth destinations: three-fold timing (before death, at corpse, afterward). Tantric transformative framework: ritual intervention to alter karmic trajectory.

<classification> Death-moment transference ritual from Sun Moon Union—A-letter visualization with breath coordination. Age-breath correlation: matching consciousness projection to recipient's lifespan. Twenty-one recitations with breath-gasps projecting consciousness through crown aperture. "Even sinners drawn to higher realms"—transference power transcending individual karma. Tantric methodology overriding ordinary causality through accomplished practice.

<classification> Corpse purification ritual—elaborate mandala, precious vase, eight-petaled lotus visualization. Samantabhadra with consort in rainbow palace, five-family buddhas, lineage gurus. OM AH HUM svaha and A recitation for consecration. Abhiseka mantra for purifying specific being's obscurations. Upaya framework: ritual as condition for liberation, not liberation itself. Risk: mistaking ritual elaboration for essential recognition.
