<classification> Liberation through realization of Suchness itself: like weaver's knot released through knowing method—so liberation through knowing. When seen with eye of sublime wisdom, first instant conceptual word-differentiation severed. Subtle channels' characteristic signs directly realized. Declarative assertion that recognition, not effort, liberates. Risk of nihilism: misreading severance as annihilation rather than recognition of conceptual construction's groundlessness.
