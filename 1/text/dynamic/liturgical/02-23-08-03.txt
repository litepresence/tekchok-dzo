[14590] <ornament> Third, regarding liberation: This is the criterion for release.
[14591] <prose> The scriptural citation:
[14592] <prose> <tantra>From the Wisdom Lamp:
[14593] <verse> Momentary recognition divides in half,
[14594] <verse> Meditation days comprise the abiding portion.
[14595] <verse> Through the distinction of endowed and non-endowed,
[14596] <verse> Mixed and similar, yet unmixed—possessing such.
[14597] <verse> Thus it is clearly shown.
[14598] <prose> Here, according to our own tradition, the classification of aspects of momentary recognition is pervaded by recognition of one's own face,
[14599] <prose> Yet meditation days are not pervaded by realization, || 10 ||
[14600] <prose> For even without realization, one may abide in natural contemplation.
[14601] <prose> This is like the end of spontaneous presence.
[14602] <prose> Moreover, momentary recognition is not pervaded by meditation,
[14603] <prose> For in the moment of realization, one is liberated into primordial purity.
[14604] <prose> There exists a limit connected with meditation, from the peak of the supreme to the final.
[14605] <prose> Meditation days are not pervaded by momentary recognition, like the final delusion of the final.
[14606] <prose> There exists a limit unconnected with momentary recognition,
[14607] <prose> Like the middle and the middle of the final.
[14608] <prose> Therefore, momentary recognition and
[14609] <prose> Meditation days—dividing these is most crucial. || 20 ||
[14610] <ornament> Regarding meditation days, some hold them as present days, yet this is utterly unsuitable,
[14611] <prose> Unworthy of refutation by scripture and reasoning,
[14612] <prose> For they are not even worth the effort of refutation.
[14613] <prose><tantra> From the Definitive Distinction:
[14614] <break> <verse> Erroneous paths are limitless,
[14615] <break> <verse> These here are not to be engaged.
[14616] <verse> Thus it is taught.
[14617] <break> <prose> Erroneous conceptions may resemble, yet refute delusion.
[14618] <break> <prose> What is utterly unsuitable is the web of all elaborations, already made into a realm of shame for the wise—what is to be done here?
[14619] <prose> Those proclaiming the Victor's words become fools themselves, like the Victor—such delusion should be turned back to its own side. || 30 ||
[14620] <prose> Here, meditation days are calculated as the duration of contemplative stability,
[14621] <prose> And in the intermediate state as well, the duration of contemplative stability is taught as meditation days.
[14622] <prose> Third, the extensive explanation of the manner of faculties' liberation, having three divisions:
[14623] <list> Superior faculties,
[14624] <list> Middling,
[14625] <list> Inferior in sequence.
[14626] <prose> The first has seven aspects:
[14627] <prose> Perfection of the supreme,
[14628] <break> <prose> Liberated without connection to meditation days in three moments,
[14629] <break> <prose> Others, more or less connected with meditation days, are liberated in three moments. || 40 ||
[14630] <prose> Hence, like a shooting star racing through space, entering self-appearance as primordial purity, through the radiance of emanation's own light, emptying the saṃsāra of sentient beings in the realm of spontaneous presence's self-appearance, one is liberated.
[14631] <prose> Moreover, from that own place of primordial purity, emanation does not diverge,
[14632] <prose> For this is the ground transcending coarse Appearance of Body and pristine cognition.
[14633] <prose> Emanation diverging below, performing the actual benefit of sentient beings, arises from the ground-appearance of spontaneous presence shining forth from primordial purity.
[14634] <prose> Diverging from the Path, through holding the body of great transference and
[14635] <prose> Traversing natural emanation, one benefits sentient beings of other continuums from oneself.
[14636] <prose> The manner of emanation diverging in the intermediate state appears to perform that benefit through the door of spontaneous presence from self-appearance as saṃsāra—
[14637] <prose> Know this as similar to having benefited sentient beings in a dream, without actual benefit arising for others beyond mere self-appearance.
[14638] <prose> This ground is a unique philosophical tenet of the special Great Perfection, making it somewhat difficult to realize.
[14639] <prose> When making three moments, in the first, the sphere-appearance together with the four pristine cognitions and their connections ceases. || 50 ||
