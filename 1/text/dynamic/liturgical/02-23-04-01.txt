[13304] <prose> First, the first of the five outer elements dissolves:
[13305] <prose> The five inner earth elements dissolve into the five outer earth elements, whereby the body's power is lost and memory declines.
[13306] <break> <prose> The five water elements dissolve into water, whereby the body's fluids drip, and in that silk-like moment the mouth and nose become dry while the eyes roll upward.
[13307] <break> <prose> The five fire elements dissolve into fire, whereby the body's heat rises, memory ceases, and the lamp is no longer seen.
[13308] <prose> The five wind elements dissolve into wind, whereby the body's luster fades and breath becomes rough, ceasing in that silk-like moment.
[13309] <prose> Then the manner of the inner elements dissolving is thus:
[13310] <prose> The five space elements dissolve into the sphere of awareness; at that time, the face is grasped.
[13311] <prose> Then, the manner of the extremely clear five inner elements dissolving into the five secret elements:
[13312] <prose> The subtle aspect of the five elements dissolves into the life-force,
[13313] <prose> And the five life-forces enter into the awareness at the heart center: || 10 ||
[13314] <prose> The light-channel and
[13315] <prose> The hollow space within it and
[13316] <prose> The bindu and
[13317] <prose> The five lights—one's own body as awareness possessing the mansion of light—dissolve.
[13318] <prose> Then, those five secret elements first abiding as the life-wind, the great perfectly complete elements, the basis-appear as self-resounding awareness, the heart-center possessing self-nature as light-power, awareness possessing the mansion of light,
[13319] <prose> Possessing objects of limitless light,
[13320] <prose> Dissolve together with the appearance of the four lamps,
[13321] <prose> The Dharmakāya bardo self-resounding outwardly clear appearing aspect alone is made,
[13322] <prose> Outer and inner dharmas impure, separated from the aspect of saṃsāra,
[13323] <prose> Awareness reverts from the basis, || 20 ||
[13324] <prose> Arriving at the original primordially pure self-sphere.
[13325] <prose> Special among these: at the time of the inner elements dissolving into the outer elements,
[13326] <prose> When earth dissolves into earth: the power of emptiness emerges, wisdom latent.
[13327] <prose> The clear wisdom latent in the power of awareness, wisdom unable to appear as the Path.
[13328] <prose> When water dissolves into water: wisdom moistens, latent in the state of awareness, water flows from mouth and nose.
[13329] <prose> Wherein, that also, awareness wisdom clear and dim not, although power unable to appear outwardly, awareness latent.
[13330] <prose> When fire dissolves into fire: although primordially self-awareness abides as the essence of wisdom,
[13331] <prose> At that time, wind enters inward, power unable to appear outwardly.
[13332] <prose> When wind dissolves into wind: awareness power complete, not abiding in objects.
[13333] <prose> When the body's power is lost: because wisdom qualities are latent. || 30 ||
[13334] <prose> Moreover, when space dissolves into space, awareness dissolves into the bardo: the time of wisdom grasping its own ground.
[13335] <prose> Self-appear awareness to appearance,
[13336] <prose> Free from binding with lump and binding-agent, because near.
[13337] <prose> That body, inner basis-appear spontaneous aspect, at that time this is called the bardo.
[13338] <prose> The five elements dissolve where the lump with binding-agent,
[13339] <prose> And awareness abiding in its own clear self-ground, because it is the interval.
[13340] <prose> Therefore, when abiding in the body, relying on the heart's inner power, that Dharma-nature self-resounding, arises from the path of the eye from the body, emerging.
[13341] <prose> Although called by the symbol "Dharmakāya bardo,"
[13342] <prose> Together with awareness self-resounding, from other arises nothing at all, and
[13343] <prose> That same inner dissolving-setting time, primordially pure self-ground grasping alone, from other does not exist. || 40 ||
[13344] <prose> These inner elements are slightly difficult: explained separately.
[13345] <prose> The remainder scripture itself knows, therefore here not explained separately.
[13346] <prose> That also,
[13347] <prose> <tantra> From Awareness Self-Arisen:
[13348] <prose> Ho! Friends, beings, great cavity transference:
[13349] <prose> Outer elements dissolve into inner elements,
[13350] <prose> Inner elements dissolve into secret elements,
[13351] <prose> Secret elements dissolve into perfectly complete elements, entering the great Path; at that time, know thus.
[13352] <prose> Then, as signs of the inner five elements dissolving outward, know thus:
[13353] <prose> Earth dissolves into earth, || 50 ||
[13354] <prose> Water dissolves into water,
[13355] <prose> Fire dissolves into fire,
[13356] <prose> Wind dissolves into wind,
[13357] <prose> Space dissolves into space.
[13358] <prose> That also, earth dissolving into earth has two aspects:
[13359] <prose> Outer earth dissolving into inner earth, and
[13360] <prose> Inner earth dissolving into outer earth.
[13361] <prose> The time of outer earth dissolving into inner earth is:
[13362] <prose> The first time.
[13363] <break> <prose> The inner five elements dissolving outward || 60 ||
[13364] <break> <prose> Time is: inner earth dissolving into outer earth sign, the body's power is lost.
[13365] <prose> That also is thus:
[13366] <prose> The sign of earth dissolving where all appears: outer consciousness dulls.
[13367] <prose> The sign of unchanging vajra earth dissolving: the body's power is lost.
[13368] <prose> The sign of all-arising precious earth dissolving: declining in capacity, unable to rise.
[13369] <prose> The sign of appearance-revealing Samantabhadra earth dissolving: losing perfectly complete power, intention unclear.
[13370] <break> <prose> The sign of accomplishment-completing earth dissolving: the lamp's appearance ceases.
[13371] <break> <prose> The sign of inner water dissolving into outer water: water unable to be held.
[13372] <prose> That also is thus:
[13373] <break> <prose> The sign of unchanging water dissolving: water dripping from mouth and nose. || 70 ||
[13374] <break> <prose> Thus, the sign of peaceful clear pure water dissolving: unable to hold water from the secret place.
[13375] <prose> The sign of quality-arising spreading water dissolving: eyes rolling upward.
[13376] <prose> The sign of attachment-free water dissolving: mouth and nose dry.
[13377] <prose> The sign of grasping-free perfectly complete water dissolving: ears unable to hear sound.
[13378] <prose> The sign of inner fire dissolving into outer fire: the body's heat is lost.
[13379] <prose> That also, know thus:
[13380] <prose> The sign of all-pervading outer-inner fire dissolving: inner heat lost, consciousness unclear.
[13381] <prose> The sign of outer-inner equal fire dissolving: secret heat lost.
[13382] <prose> The sign of outer-inner activity realizing fire dissolving:
[13383] <prose> Perfectly complete heat lost. || 80 ||
[13384] <prose> The sign of outer-inner activity accomplishing fire dissolving: the empty lamp is not seen.
[13385] <prose> The sign of inner wind dissolving into outer wind: the body's power is lost.
[13386] <prose> That also, know thus:
[13387] <prose> The sign of luster-and-radiance-generating wind dissolving: body's luster lost.
[13388] <prose> The sign of fire-equal abiding wind dissolving: water dripping from the body.
[13389] <prose> The sign of life-holding wind dissolving: breath unable to be held.
[13390] <prose> The sign of all-pervading wind dissolving: body's luster and memory lost.
[13391] <prose> The sign of compassion-free karma wind dissolving: outer breath ceases.
[13392] <prose> That is called the outer element.
[13393] <prose> Space dissolving into space: || 90 ||
[13394] <prose> The space pervading all universally dissolves into the pure lamp.
[13395] <prose> The objectless clear space dissolves into awareness.
[13396] <prose> The unmixed pure space dissolves into the Expanse.
[13397] <prose> The meaning-indicating space dissolves into Prajña.
[13398] <prose> The space liberating into the pure realm dissolves into the twenty-one meanings.
[13399] <prose> That is called the inner element.
[13400] <prose> The root-holding life dissolves into the bindu.
[13401] <prose> The protecting life coalesces into space.
[13402] <prose> The extremely subtle life coalesces into the body.
[13403] <prose> The impure life dissolves into space. || 100 ||
[13404] <prose> The vibratory life dissolves into the Expanse.
[13405] <prose> That is called the secret element.
[13406] <prose> The pure-impure distinguishing wind dissolves into the sphere.
[13407] <prose> The heat-generating wind dissolves into light.
[13408] <prose> The clarifying-transforming wind dissolves into Sku.
[13409] <prose> The settling wind dissolves into Ye-shes.
[13410] <prose> The exhorting wind dissolves into compassion.
[13411] <prose> The consciousness-moving wind dissolves into emptiness.
[13412] <prose> The mind-releasing wind dissolves into non-dual.
[13413] <prose> The radiance-possessing wind dissolves into limit-free. || 110 ||
[13414] <prose> The burning wind dissolves into great bliss.
[13415] <prose> The agitated wind dissolves into clarity.
[13416] <prose> The basis-pervading wind dissolves into space-clarity.
[13417] <prose> The instant-pervading wind dissolves into depth-clarity.
[13418] <prose> The terrifying-pervading wind dissolves into objects.
[13419] <prose> The memory-pervading wind dissolves into the bardo.
[13420] <prose> The grasping body-all-pervading wind dissolves into self-appear.
[13421] <prose> The moving wind moves awareness in space.
[13422] <prose> The liberating wind separates from outer-inner dharmas.
[13423] <prose> The reversing wind reverses self-awareness into the basis. || 120 ||
[13424] <prose> The hastening wind sees the object of awareness.
[13425] <prose> The instantaneous wind brings one to the place of primordial purity in three instants.
[13426] <prose> That is the perfectly complete element.
[13427] <prose> Those persons not under the power of conditions thus engage the life-force.
[13428] <prose> Those not thus engaging the life-force:
[13429] <prose> Are called the transference method of Bodhisattvas,
[13430] <prose> Reborn possessing bliss in the birth realm.
[13431] <prose> To those exhausted of karma, not thus, know thus, it is taught.
[13432] <prose> Thus, through twenty-five winds, the five elements dissolve into the Expanse,
[13433] <prose> saṃsāra and nirvāṇa liberated, || 130 ||
[13434] <prose> Performing the action of liberating nirvāṇa into primordial purity,
[13435] <prose> By what is called "wind," all actions are performed—
[13436] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[13437] <prose> These are great essential points to be known.
[13438] <prose> These are called the bardo of death.
[13439] <prose> Moreover, third topic: extensive explanation of the Dharmakāya bardo instructions on trusting self-appear, meeting previous acquaintances, or entering the lap, in three parts:
[13440] <list> First: demonstrating abandonment through the manner of awareness dissolving into luminosity,
[13441] <list> Second: extensive explanation through the manner of luminosity self-appear arising,
[13442] <list> Third: summary of meaning through the manner of self-appear sense-power liberation.
[13443] <ornament> First: || 140 ||
[13444] <prose> The five winds dissolving into the Expanse,
[13445] <prose> The heart center's three-tiered ye-shes sound entering the throat separated from the horse, power dissolving into self, mind and mind-originated all-basis together with saṃsāra's dharmas all latent,
[13446] <prose> At that time when saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's back is turned, awareness, white silk from the channel-path, emerges from the water-lamp into the pure space of the Expanse, arising as self-appear,
[13447] <prose><tantra> From first liberation until completion through eight dissolution manners:
[13448] <prose> <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[13449] <prose> To truth-seeing beings, know thus:
[13450] <prose> Sons of family, at the time of passing beyond sorrow,
[13451] <prose> The body's pair lost, ye-shes appearance rising from the basis,
[13452] <prose> Ye-shes moving in space,
[13453] <prose> Awareness emerging from the path of the eye, moving in space, || 150 ||
[13454] <prose> That also, know thus:
[13455] <prose><tantra> From the center of the heart, awareness dissolves into the bindu,
[13456] <prose> Bindu dissolves into lamp,
[13457] <prose> Lamp dissolves into light,
[13458] <prose> Light dissolves into Sku,
[13459] <prose> Sku dissolves into sphere,
[13460] <prose> Sphere dissolves into four ye-shes,
[13461] <prose> Ye-shes dissolves into spontaneous presence,
[13462] <prose> Spontaneous presence dissolves into great primordial purity, grasping the ground.
[13463] <prose> Thus appears the liberation manner and dissolution manner of truth-seeing persons. || 160 ||
[13464] <prose> Consequently, that also, these pure ye-shes appearances do not appear to those who, in an instant from the body, transmigrate to existence and other grounds,
[13465] <prose> To others, although briefly appearing, duration short, like a swift dream, without essence, fading away, unrecognized.
[13466] <prose> Even for truth-seeing ones, if accustomed to direct perception, appearance duration long, having only the abundance of liberation-appearance,
[13467] <prose> Although directly seen, if not particularly cultivated in that, that state's realm portion without that capacity, like a shooting star, completing in but a moment, as taught,
[13468] <prose> Therefore, now, familiarity with thogel concentration is essential.
[13469] <prose> <tantra> From Sun Moon Union:
[13470] <prose> Possessing the essence of empty clarity,
[13471] <prose> Possessing the essence of clear awareness,
[13472] <prose> Possessing the mansion of awareness light,
[13473] <prose> Familiarity with the four lamps is essential. || 170 ||
[13474] <prose> Thus.
[13475] <prose> Second, extensive explanation of luminosity self-appear arising manner in five parts:
[13476] <list> First: basis-appear luminosity appearance,
[13477] <list> Second: union sphere appearance,
[13478] <list> Third: four ye-shes joining appearance,
[13479] <list> Fourth: precious spontaneous presence appearance,
[13480] <list> Extensive explanation of essential pith instructions liberating into those.
[13481] <ornament> First:
[13482] <prose> <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[13483] <prose> Here the Dharmakāya bardo is explained. || 180 ||
[13484] <prose><tantra> From death, at the time of falling,
[13485] <prose> Consciousness dissolves into pure space,
[13486] <prose> When space dissolves into luminosity,
[13487] <prose> All subtle and coarse appearances cease,
[13488] <prose> The light-body possessing all senses,
[13489] <prose> Transforms according to karma and latent tendencies.
[13490] <prose> At this time, at the time of light-appearance fragments,
[13491] <prose> The wise grasp the spreading appearance,
[13492] <prose> Moving with wind, spreading,
[13493] <prose> Five-by-five colored lights and rays, || 190 ||
[13494] <prose> Uncertain, appearing as rainbow patterns.
[13495] <prose> Thus,
[13496] <prose> Awareness not abiding, emerging, appearing in space,
[13497] <prose> Within the expanse of awareness, five ye-shes winds existing, spreading, luminosity appearance appearing as rainbow patterns, filling space,
[13498] <prose> Five ye-shes individually clear, unmixed self-resoundings,
[13499] <break> <prose> Consequently, mirror-like ye-shes, primordially pure of stain, self-resounding white clearly appearing, also not mixed with the other four, clear in its own place:
[13500] <break> <prose> At the bardo time, in the eastern direction, by oneself—
[13501] <prose> At the time of capacity, one's own forward direction is one's own place,
[13502] <prose><tantra> From that, rays self-pure and
[13503] <prose> Intertwined and || 200 ||
[13504] <prose> Direct and
[13505] <prose> Spreading like sun-rays from the eastern direction, and
[13506] <prose> The entity of equality ye-shes, spontaneous presence qualities complete without ceasing, yellow self-resounding,
[13507] <prose> At the bardo time, clear in the southern self-place, rays as above spreading, and
[13508] <prose> At the time of appearance increase, all those forward self-places,
[13509] <prose> Discriminating ye-shes, four powers arising without ceasing,
[13510] <prose> Red self-resounding from which rays as above spread, and
[13511] <prose> Accomplishing-action ye-shes, activity power primordially complete, green self-resounding,
[13512] <prose><tantra> From the northern self-place, rays as above spread, and
[13513] <prose> Dharmadhatu ye-shes, spontaneously accomplished Dharmakāya primordially complete, deep-blue self-resounding, || 210 ||
[13514] <prose><tantra> From the central self-place, rays as above spread.
[13515] <prose> At the time of capacity, all from forward self-place arising, appearance spreading,
[13516] <prose><tantra> From that, right, left, back, and above-below two, know.
[13517] <prose> Those five ye-shes self-resoundings also arise as the distinctive five Skus,
[13518] <prose><tantra> From those Skus, ye-shes light-rays spreading, one from another four finger-widths apart, not touching, white and
[13519] <prose> Yellow and
[13520] <prose> Red and
[13521] <prose> Green and
[13522] <prose> Deep-blue nature brilliantly shining, spreading in the ten directions:
[13523] <prose> Root subtle, tips vast, spontaneously thick, all appearances || 220 ||
[13524] <prose> Subtle and
[13525] <prose> Moving and
[13526] <prose> Trembling and
[13527] <prose> Flickering and
[13528] <prose> Shining,
[13529] <prose> The five lights' Expanse extremely vast, limitless, immeasurable, inconceivable,
[13530] <prose> Height high, tips vast, as the source of all mandalas, self-appear.
[13531] <prose> When seeing this appearance,
[13532] <prose> Consciousness abiding in natural absorption,
[13533] <prose> The essential pith instruction of recognizing spreading appearance as self-appear is supreme, and one should abide in that state. || 230 ||
[13534] <prose> If recognized here, liberated in three instants to the place of primordial purity:
[13535] <prose> First instant: recognition,
[13536] <prose> Second instant: liberation upon recognition,
[13537] <prose> Third instant: liberated, dissolving into primordial purity, after that no appearance whatsoever.
[13538] <prose> Those also, if scripture elaborates, beautiful to the wise,
[13539] <prose> And explained to open the eye of intelligence for the foolish.
[13540] <break> <prose> <tantra> From Sun Moon Union:
[13541] <prose> Hey! Great thought-free Sage, listen!
[13542] <break> <prose> Naturally pure appearance is thus:
[13543] <prose> The consciousness of beings dissolving into luminosity is called || 240 ||
[13544] <prose> Breath outer-inner travel severed immediately,
[13545] <prose> One's own senses
[13546] <prose><tantra> From portion appearing as thing, the consciousness thinking "fire exists" arises.
[13547] <prose> This body of lump-with-binding-agent not appearing,
[13548] <prose> Clearly as the light-body.
[13549] <prose> At that time, as much as becoming the sphere of sense activity,
[13550] <prose> Appearing as the mandala of five light-rays.
[13551] <prose> That also, those appearances, seen from outside, inside clear; seen from inside, outside clear.
[13552] <prose> Without outer-inner, all-pervading transparent,
[13553] <prose> Like a mirage, || 250 ||
[13554] <prose> Like fire,
[13555] <prose> Pressed, seeming to sink,
[13556] <prose> Lifted, seeming to leap,
[13557] <prose> Extremely captivating,
[13558] <prose> Clearly as colors, self-clear without individual mixing,
[13559] <prose> Equal portion, clarity portion not ceasing,
[13560] <prose> Truly seen, extremely subtle and
[13561] <prose> Moving and
[13562] <prose> Trembling like and
[13563] <prose> Flickering like and || 260 ||
[13564] <prose> Brilliantly shining, majestically spontaneous.
[13565] <prose> Extremely vast,
[13566] <prose> Without reckoning or object not entered,
[13567] <prose> Height high, tips vast, thus called,
[13568] <prose> Abiding as the source of all mandalas.
[13569] <prose> That also, colors are five:
[13570] <prose> White clear in self-place, rays spreading, and
[13571] <prose> Likewise yellow clear in self-place, rays spreading, and
[13572] <break> <prose> Red clear in self-place, rays spreading, and
[13573] <break> <prose> Green itself clear in self-place, rays spreading, and || 270 ||
[13574] <prose> Likewise deep-blue itself clear in self-place, rays spreading,
[13575] <prose> Those also, not touching in contact, individually self-clear as colors,
[13576] <prose> Extremely spontaneously thick abiding, thus taught.
[13577] <prose> Some persons not delighting in scripture are known as foolish, without intelligence.
[13578] <prose> The wise are especially made by scripture.
[13579] <prose> Second, extensive explanation of union sphere appearance:
[13580] <prose> <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[13581] <prose><tantra> From entering and maturing wind,
[13582] <prose> Four directions, directions, above-below accomplished.
[13583] <prose> There, gathered directional light, || 280 ||
[13584] <prose> Five families Sku also clearly appear.
[13585] <prose> Deep-blue, white, yellow, red, green,
[13586] <prose> Appearing together with individual consorts.
[13587] <prose> If spreading and grasping known in this,
[13588] <prose> The qualities of the Buddhas complete,
[13589] <prose> Not entering the three realms.
[13590] <prose> That characteristic thus:
[13591] <prose> Coarse elements free from dependency,
[13592] <prose><tantra> From light, bindu-pair blazing,
[13593] <prose> Five bindus connected, Skus filling, || 290 ||
[13594] <prose><tantra> From half-Sku, forms complete.
[13595] <prose><tantra> From form-half-Sku, five-by-five pairs,
[13596] <prose> Individual spheres complete,
[13597] <prose> Five-possessing, ten-possessing, hundred-possessing,
[13598] <prose> Spheres thousand, hundred-thousand,
[13599] <prose> Naturally pure in thought-scope,
[13600] <prose> Inexpressible, numberless.
[13601] <prose> If self and other known in this,
[13602] <prose> Obtaining the Three Skus condensed as one,
[13603] <prose><tantra> From this obtaining, no turning back. || 300 ||
[13604] <prose> Arisen from clarity-bestowal.
[13605] <prose> Thus,
[13606] <prose> In this, cause from what spreading,
[13607] <prose><tantra> From bindu, sphere appearance, essential pith instruction of non-reversal, demonstrated in three parts:
[13608] <prose> The cause is the former ye-shes wind entering objects, by that power, that same luminosity appearance here spreading as union sphere appearance.
[13609] <prose> The meaning of union: that awareness self-light spontaneously spreading, and
[13610] <prose> Dharmakāya mother's five luminosities, Sambhogakāya realm-appearance primordially existing as path-appearance, two meeting at the time at awareness's face, recognition, inseparably entering as one.
[13611] <prose> At that time, released from the binding of all-basis appropriation,
[13612] <prose> Dharmakāya eye seeing Dharmakāya appearance as self-system, entering that, and
[13613] <prose> Sambhogakāya ye-shes eye seeing awareness-son appearance, self-face inseparably entering, and || 310 ||
[13614] <prose> Former cultivated Prajña arising there, Prajña eye joining those two inseparably,
[13615] <prose> Mother-son inseparably abiding, ye-shes union dissolving, thus called.
