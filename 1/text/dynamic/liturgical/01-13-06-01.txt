[17072] <prose>First, the essential nature:
[17073] <prose>The intention of all lamps as the object of knowledge—Dharmatā empty-luminous, self-abiding, together with the dynamic of knowledge.
[17074] <prose>Method: ground-hook;
[17075] <prose>Bindu;
[17076] <prose>By placing the three dimensions unmoving,
[17077] <prose>Within, self-awareness crystal-clear split, the intention of self-abiding together with the interval of knowledge filling the expanse.
[17078] <prose><tantra>From the Blazing Lamp:
[17079] <prose><tantra>"Self-arisen wisdom lamp—
[17080] <prose><tantra>Thus, of all lamps,
[17081] <prose><tantra>Since abiding as the object of knowledge, || 10 ||
[17082] <prose><tantra>By this exactly, in all parts,
[17083] <prose><tantra>By this discriminating wisdom exactly,
[17084] <prose><tantra>Abiding in the manner of non-discrimination.
[17085] <prose><tantra>As the nature producing subtle parts,
[17086] <prose><tantra>Abiding primordially from the beginning.
[17087] <prose><tantra>Thus it is spoken."
[17088] <prose>Second, the definitive meaning:
[17089] <prose>Within self-abiding effortless intention, when knowing the time of outer-appearance self-appearance completely obvious,
[17090] <prose>Knowing dharmas all universally empty and selfless,
[17091] <prose>Knowing the measures of one's own primordial wisdom—this is called knowledge. || 20 ||
[17092] <prose><tantra>"Excellent, by all difficult to realize intention, not sought, found from self, becoming the extremely superior summit"—thus.
[17093] <prose><tantra>"Primordially existing jewel found at self, called self";
[17094] <prose><tantra>Self-arisen, ceaselessly arising, called arisen;
[17095] <prose><tantra>Knowing dharmas clearly, called lamp.
[17096] <prose><tantra>Self-appearance pervading at self-face by awareness, not by knowledge, called not.
[17097] <prose><tantra>Again, from that exactly:
[17098] <prose><tantra>By knowledge, entity and non-entity,
[17099] <prose><tantra>Completely entering into all appearances,
[17100] <prose><tantra>And knowing the universal meanings,
[17101] <prose><tantra>Obtaining the confidence of not-sought, not-placed, || 30 ||
[17102] <prose><tantra>Knowing the measures of one's own primordial wisdom,
[17103] <prose><tantra>Dharmakāya of pure nature,
[17104] <prose><tantra>By self-awareness not finding the three,
[17105] <prose><tantra>Clearly appearing surpassing all excellence.
[17106] <prose><tantra>Since no basis for examination by others,
[17107] <prose><tantra>Object of primordially pure self-arisen,
[17108] <prose><tantra>Not object of other, called self.
[17109] <prose><tantra>By doing, this meaning not found;
[17110] <prose><tantra>Since hope not existing for whom,
[17111] <prose><tantra>Called primordially self-appearance arisen. || 40 ||
[17112] <prose><tantra>By lamp, all Dharmatā,
[17113] <prose><tantra>Making appear as non-dual,
[17114] <prose><tantra>Ma pervading self-face, thus.
[17115] <prose><tantra>Thus spoken, and
[17116] <prose><tantra>From the Pearl-Garland:
[17117] <prose><tantra>"For example, like a fire-lamp,
[17118] <prose><tantra>By knowledge, dharmas simultaneously realized;
[17119] <prose><tantra>Excellent, becoming the summit of all;
[17120] <prose><tantra>Self free from other-dependent dharmas;
[17121] <prose><tantra>Arisen, unblocked, spontaneously appearing." || 50 ||
[17122] <prose><tantra>Thus spoken.
[17123] <prose>Third, divided there are five:
[17124] <list>Ground-abiding self-arisen wisdom;
[17125] <list>Inner-abiding awareness of knowledge—abiding as arising-basis and support.
[17126] <list>One-pointed-grasping-appearance wisdom;
[17127] <list>Expansive awareness non-dual union's own time self-clear, stainless, pure, conveying intention to Dharmatā.
[17128] <list>Memory ceaseless wisdom;
[17129] <list>Arising without characteristic below, yet
[17130] <list>Liberating self-face to Dharmatā as one.
[17131] <list>Analytical wisdom; || 60 ||
[17132] <list>Dharmas and dharmatās, self and universal aspects,
[17133] <list>Characteristics, etc., appearing without confusion, knowing.
[17134] <list>Three-engaging wisdom;
[17135] <list>In this bardo of nature, by hearing, establishing definitively;
[17136] <list>By thinking, determining;
[17137] <list>By meditation, tasting, certainly liberating from saṃsāra—
[17138] <list>Making realize word-meaning.
[17139] <prose><tantra>Again, from that exactly:
[17140] <prose><tantra>Divisions are five types:
[17141] <prose><tantra>By ground-abiding self-arisen wisdom, || 70 ||
[17142] <prose><tantra>Making supports of body, etc., dharmas;
[17143] <prose><tantra>By one-pointed-grasping-awareness,
[17144] <prose><tantra>Grasping support of expanse and awareness;
[17145] <prose><tantra>By memory-ceaseless wisdom,
[17146] <prose><tantra>Gathering objects, one-pointed knowledge;
[17147] <prose><tantra>By analytical wisdom,
[17148] <prose><tantra>Discriminating universal and self characteristics;
[17149] <prose><tantra>By three-engaging wisdom,
[17150] <prose><tantra>Establishing definitively in nature's bardo.
[17151] <prose><tantra>Thus it is spoken. || 80 ||
[17152] <prose>Fourth, the characteristic:
[17153] <prose>Knowing dharmas gathered by appearing objects and dharmas gathered by knowing awareness as without nature—this is the characteristic.
[17154] <prose><tantra>From that exactly:
[17155] <prose><tantra>"All dharmas appearing and not-appearing,
[17156] <prose><tantra>Who knows as without nature—
[17157] <prose><tantra>This is the characteristic."
[17158] <prose><tantra>Thus spoken, and
[17159] <prose><tantra>From the Condensed:
[17160] <prose><tantra>"Dhārmās completely transformed as without nature—
[17161] <prose><tantra>This is called supreme Prajñāpāramitā." || 90 ||
[17162] <prose><tantra>Thus spoken exactly.
[17163] <prose>Fifth, the gate of manifestation:
[17164] <prose>Five faculties—since the gate is that by power-awareness objects are measured as wisdom.
[17165] <prose>Particularly, from the nose, memory wisdom's horse wind moving—this exactly.
[17166] <prose>Fire wind wisdom's spark-like appearance at night, squeezing—know thus.
[17167] <prose><tantra>Again, from that exactly:
[17168] <prose><tantra>"Manifestation gate five faculties;
[17169] <prose><tantra>Particularly, from nose making manifest.
[17170] <prose><tantra>That sign at night time,
[17171] <prose><tantra>Groaning and fierce squeezing, || 100 ||
[17172] <prose><tantra>Extremely fierce body remaining,
[17173] <prose><tantra>Red blazing light rays,
[17174] <prose><tantra>Spreading like sparks—
[17175] <prose><tantra>By that measure and that sign,
[17176] <prose><tantra>Know the gate of manifestation."
[17177] <prose><tantra>Thus it is spoken.
[17178] <prose>Sixth, the field:
[17179] <prose>Citta on four channels of great distinction, grasped by wisdom's clarity-wind, not dispersing outward, internally self-abiding, only unclear,
[17180] <prose>By karma-wind outward-force moved, objects awareness-appeared.
[17181] <prose>That also, abiding in name-ground-gathered clarity, || 110 ||
[17182] <prose>Element,
[17183] <prose>Knowledge,
[17184] <prose>Fourfold clarity of wisdom-awareness.
[17185] <prose><tantra>From that exactly:
[17186] <prose><tantra>"From four producing channels,
[17187] <prose><tantra>Moving, shaking, dispersing,
[17188] <prose><tantra>Fire spark rising characteristic,
[17189] <prose><tantra>Five
[17190] <break> <prose><tantra>Wisdom,
[17191] <break> <prose><tantra>Karma, || 120 ||
[17192] <break> <prose><tantra>From,
[17193] <break> <prose><tantra>With wind,
[17194] <prose><tantra>Knowledge clear-clear, aware-aware;
[17195] <prose><tantra>Wisdoms' nature as
[17196] <prose><tantra>Flavor not-raw, all trembling,
[17197] <prose><tantra>Crystal tube hollow inside,
[17198] <prose><tantra>Clear, great wisdom abiding.
[17199] <prose><tantra>Name-four-gathered clarity,
[17200] <prose><tantra>As nature discriminating all,
[17201] <prose><tantra>Primordially abiding in body-parts, || 130 ||
[17202] <prose><tantra>Occasionally grasped by wind,
[17203] <prose><tantra>Knowledge memoryless, dull, yet
[17204] <prose><tantra>Wisdom powers expanded-contracted,
[17205] <prose><tantra>Clear part none, becoming dull.
[17206] <prose><tantra>When one's own wisdom-power moved,
[17207] <prose><tantra>Even dharmas not heard before,
[17208] <prose><tantra>Arise in mind, clearly appear.
[17209] <prose><tantra>Clear and unclear powers,
[17210] <prose><tantra>Arise from wind's movement alone,
[17211] <prose><tantra>Abiding in body-center channel-inside." || 140 ||
[17212] <prose><tantra>Thus it is spoken.
[17213] <prose>Seventh, the measure:
[17214] <prose>Ground-abiding wisdom's measure: abiding in heat-measure of equal-intention.
[17215] <prose>One-pointed-grasping wisdom's measure:
[17216] <prose>Expansive awareness mixed, obtaining self-power.
[17217] <prose>Memory-ceaseless wisdom's measure:
[17218] <prose>Liberating-arising without characteristic, gathering-dispersing exhausted, abiding in effortless spontaneous intention, conditions not moving awareness.
[17219] <prose>Analytical wisdom's measure:
[17220] <prose>Dualistic dharmas discriminated separately, establishing definitively.
[17221] <prose>Three-engaging wisdom's measure: || 150 ||
[17222] <prose>Realizing word-meaning, abiding in meaning's self-face.
[17223] <prose><tantra>Thus, from the Blazing Lamp:
[17224] <prose><tantra>"Ground-abiding wisdom self-arisen measure:
[17225] <prose><tantra>From equal-intention experience-arisen,
[17226] <prose><tantra>Obtained confidence of stable knowledge.
[17227] <prose><tantra>That itself, without change,
[17228] <prose><tantra>Always abiding in continuum, thus
[17229] <prose><tantra>By this, ground-abiding wisdom completed.
[17230] <prose><tantra>This body also light,
[17231] <prose><tantra>Knowledges clear. || 160 ||
[17232] <prose><tantra>One-pointed-grasping wisdom measure:
[17233] <prose><tantra>Resting-experience enjoyed signs,
[17234] <prose><tantra>Body-center five colors' light,
[17235] <prose><tantra>Without effort appearing outward,
[17236] <prose><tantra>By this knowledge self-place completed.
[17237] <prose><tantra>Body also not touching ground,
[17238] <prose><tantra>By this knowing where placed,
[17239] <prose><tantra>Material objects also able to melt.
[17240] <prose><tantra>Self-power trained measure.
[17241] <prose><tantra>Memory-ceaseless wisdom measure: || 170 ||
[17242] <prose><tantra>Knowledge not entering other,
[17243] <prose><tantra>Alone abiding, happy,
[17244] <prose><tantra>Always in secluded place,
[17245] <prose><tantra>Not desiring to be with people,
[17246] <prose><tantra>Knowledge becomes one-pointed.
[17247] <prose><tantra>Even others' spoken words,
[17248] <prose><tantra>Free from grasping as pair,
[17249] <prose><tantra>View unchanging, confidence,
[17250] <prose><tantra>Thinking going through space,
[17251] <break> <prose><tantra>Mind placed there, ceases there, || 180 ||
[17252] <prose><tantra>Others' conditions also,
[17253] <break> <prose><tantra>How could this be changed?
[17254] <prose><tantra>Carefree knowledge vast,
[17255] <prose><tantra>Person born to this,
[17256] <prose><tantra>Memory-ceaseless wisdom completed.
[17257] <prose><tantra>Analytical wisdom measure:
[17258] <prose><tantra>Ālaya and Dharmakāya also,
[17259] <prose><tantra>Thus discriminated, thus signs,
[17260] <prose><tantra>Body attachment mind free,
[17261] <prose><tantra>Awareness placed where placed, || 190 ||
[17262] <prose><tantra>Body becomes material,
[17263] <prose><tantra>Mind and wisdom discriminated,
[17264] <prose><tantra>Moving channels' gates also cease.
[17265] <break> <prose><tantra>Element clear-obscure discriminated,
[17266] <break> <prose><tantra>Coarse appearance self-liberated,
[17267] <prose><tantra>Happy like a weasel,
[17268] <prose><tantra>Thus saṃsāra-nirvāṇa discriminated,
[17269] <prose><tantra>Delusion thoughts impossible.
[17270] <prose><tantra>Even if arisen, without benefit-harm,
[17271] <prose><tantra>By such self-knowledge, || 200 ||
[17272] <prose><tantra>Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa established definitively—
[17273] <prose><tantra>Analytical thought wisdom.
[17274] <prose><tantra>Three-engaging wisdom measure:
[17275] <prose><tantra>All dharmas one word spoken,
[17276] <prose><tantra>Knowing that scripture,
[17277] <prose><tantra>Hearing wisdom measure completed.
[17278] <prose><tantra>By knowledge, what is thought,
[17279] <prose><tantra>That pair pleasantly arisen in continuum,
[17280] <prose><tantra>By thinking likewise trained,
[17281] <prose><tantra>Arisen, conditions not harming, || 210 ||
[17282] <prose><tantra>Deluded thought attachment self-liberated—
[17283] <prose><tantra>By this, meditation wisdom found."
[17284] <prose><tantra>Thus it is spoken.
[17285] <prose>Eighth, the harmonious example:
[17286] <prose>One for whom viewed objects appear and are realized, all afflictions burned—like fire blazing in tinder.
[17287] <prose><tantra>From the Blazing Lamp:
[17288] <prose><tantra>"For example, in dry tinder,
[17289] <prose><tantra>Even meeting subtle fire spark,
[17290] <prose><tantra>All tinder blazing, burned by fire,
[17291] <prose><tantra>By wisdom, habitual tendencies burned— || 220 ||
[17292] <prose><tantra>All this wisdom lamp."
[17293] <break> <prose><tantra>Thus spoken, and
[17294] <break> <prose><tantra>From the Condensed:
[17295] <prose><tantra>"By wisdom, knowing dharmas' nature completely,
[17296] <prose><tantra>Truly transcending the three realms."
[17297] <prose><tantra>Thus spoken exactly.
[17298] <ornament>From the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle,
[17299] <ornament>The presentation of the Four Lamps' sequence—thirteenth chapter.
[17300] <prose>Thus, having explained in detail the body-support and other gathered dharmas,
[17301] <prose>Now, establishing definitively the nature of knowledge depending on that—three: || 230 ||
[17302] <list>Ālaya and Dharmakāya distinction;
[17303] <list>Mind and wisdom distinction;
[17304] <list>Explanation of other distinctive dharmas.
[17305] <prose>First, two:
[17306] <prose>Brief presentation and
[17307] <prose>Detailed explanation.
[17308] <prose>First:
[17309] <prose>Looking at sentient beings' ground and Buddhas' ground, the essential nature of awareness—primordially pure, stainless,
[17310] <prose>Obscured by defilement with ignorance and thought-gatherings, becoming ground of all delusion-appearance, delusion-grasping—
[17311] <prose>From the aspect of Ālaya and Dharmakāya as two types, know. || 240 ||
[17312] <prose><tantra>From the Thalgyur:
[17313] <prose><tantra>"Ālaya and Dharmakāya's crucial point."
[17314] <prose><tantra>Thus it is spoken.
[17315] <prose>There, Ālaya—made distinct by ignorance, support of all mind and mental-events' beginning,
[17316] <prose>Intermediate abiding,
[17317] <prose>Final home,
[17318] <prose>Become vessel of habitual tendencies—like a pond;
[17319] <prose>Dharmakāya—
[17320] <prose>Made distinct by reversed ignorance,
[17321] <prose>Transcended objects of mind and mental-events, || 250 ||
[17322] <prose>Pure from all karma and habitual tendencies.
[17323] <prose>Ālaya—
[17324] <prose>Like lower garment ground, become ground of downward appearance,
[17325] <prose>Various objects appearing as objects,
[17326] <prose>As subjects, six ignorance, three realms, appearing as container-contained, and its body,
[17327] <prose>Happiness-suffering,
[17328] <prose>Mind's delusion aspects, many contained;
[17329] <prose>Dharmakāya—
[17330] <prose>All that non-existing,
[17331] <prose>Not abiding together with mind, etc. || 260 ||
[17332] <prose><tantra>From Rangshar:
[17333] <prose><tantra>"To Ālaya concept-grasping,
[17334] <prose><tantra>Various deluded knowledge deceived;
[17335] <prose><tantra>Ālaya ignorance entity,
[17336] <prose><tantra>Called Ālaya to that.
[17337] <prose><tantra>Thus spoken, and
[17338] <prose><tantra>Again:
[17339] <prose><tantra>"Sentient beings' ground and Buddhas' ground,
[17340] <prose><tantra>Distinction by one difference determined.
[17341] <prose><tantra>Thus spoken, and || 270 ||
[17342] <prose><tantra>From the Pearl-Garland:
[17343] <prose><tantra>"Since Ālaya is accumulation,
[17344] <prose><tantra>Dharmakāya exhaustion of outflows;
[17345] <prose><tantra>Empty and clear, clear and pervasive,
[17346] <prose><tantra>Uncontrived by thought, memory clear;
[17347] <prose><tantra>Free from elaboration,
[17348] <prose><tantra>Pervading like space, empty;
[17349] <prose><tantra>Self-pure, free from all demonstrations,
[17350] <prose><tantra>Ālaya with causes and conditions,
[17351] <prose><tantra>Habitual tendencies, etc., like a pond; || 280 ||
[17352] <prose><tantra>Dharmakāya free from habitual tendencies,
[17353] <prose><tantra>From mind, mental-events, gatherings,
[17354] <prose><tantra>Embodied Ālaya appearing as many;
[17355] <prose><tantra>Dharmakāya free from mind, etc.,
[17356] <prose><tantra>Form-appearances many, bodies non-existing."
[17357] <prose><tantra>Thus it is spoken.
[17358] <prose>That also, Ālaya—
[17359] <prose>
[17360] <prose>
