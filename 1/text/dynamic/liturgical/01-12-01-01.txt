[13831] <tantra>THE NATURE OF CHANNELS: General Exposition
[13832] <tantra>Particular Classifications Explained
[13833] <tantra>How to Apply in Practice
[13834] <ornament> The first:
[13835] <tantra>From the Pearl Garland:
[13836] <tantra> From the channels come the bindus,
[13837] <prose> Of radiance and vibrating nature,
[13838] <tantra>Adorned with rays of light.
[13839] <tantra>Moreover, they are of three parts:
[13840] <tantra>Right, left, and central. || 10 ||
[13841] <tantra>Thus it is stated.
[13842] <prose> Here, when explaining their meaning:
[13843] <prose> The three principal channels are:
[13844] <prose> Roma,
[13845] <prose> Kyangma,
[13846] <prose> And Kundarma.
[13847] <prose> Moreover, Roma:
[13848] <prose> Since it extracts the flavor of all, it is like salt—
[13849] <prose> Experiencing the bliss of bindu generates uncommon experience, hence "flavor."
[13850] <prose> Since it arises from desire, it is called "ma" (mother)— || 20 ||
[13851] <prose> Relying on the desirous one, one becomes a Buddha.
[13852] <prose> Alternatively, "ro" (flavor) means few activities—depending on the illusion of bindu, the experience is difficult to express, hence "ma."
[13853] <prose> Within it, the relative bindu moves, being of the nature of means.
[13854] <prose> Kyangma:
[13855] <prose> Without crookedness or branches, it is called "straight hollow."
[13856] <tantra> From the cause of both ultimate and relative bindus,
[13857] <prose> The ultimate arising,
[13858] <prose> And the relative arising are ripened and separated.
[13859] <prose> Being straight, it is unchanging.
[13860] <prose> Being the foundation of all, it is called "mo" (female). || 30 ||
[13861] <prose> Relying on this, one becomes Buddha without effort.
[13862] <prose> Kundarma:
[13863] <prose> The gathering of all—
[13864] <prose> Relying on this, bindu,
[13865] <prose> Channel bliss,
[13866] <prose> And wind bliss all arise, hence "ku."
[13867] <prose> Pervading all generally, it is called "darma."
[13868] <prose> Moreover, Roma:
[13869] <tantra> From the left of the navel it coils, circulating to the right.
[13870] <prose> Kyangma: || 40 ||
[13871] <prose> Emerging from the left of the heart's tip,
[13872] <prose> Emanating from the throat channel network,
[13873] <prose> Entering inward through the skull, opening the gate at the left eye.
[13874] <prose> Roma:
[13875] <tantra> From the right eye.
[13876] <prose> Kundarma:
[13877] <prose> Resides straight in the center,
[13878] <prose> Branching into three tips, making visible the central gate at Brahma's aperture at the crown.
[13879] <tantra> From there, the body of awareness without thought dawns.
[13880] <prose> The right tip enters the right ear, || 50 ||
[13881] <prose> Moving the karma wind.
[13882] <prose> Its two subtle branches pierce both nostrils, moving together with the karma wind,
[13883] <prose> Wind enters Avadhuti, serving as the support for meditating on wind samadhi.
[13884] <prose> One tip enters the left ear, from there causing the wisdom wind to dawn.
[13885] <prose> In the left channel is the natural bindu,
[13886] <prose> In the right is the relative bindu.
[13887] <prose> Moreover, the right relies on the relative bindu to ripen the body.
[13888] <prose> Through that very means, the body performs the activities of bliss, suffering, equanimity,
[13889] <prose> And the increase and decrease of elements.
[13890] <prose> There are four subtle knots in it: || 60 ||
[13891] <prose> The navel,
[13892] <prose> Memory,
[13893] <prose> Flavors,
[13894] <prose> And the tip.
[13895] <prose> The first generates the root of production—within the channel resides the father's white causal bindu, the size of a mustard seed divided into ten parts.
[13896] <prose> Relying on that, the body develops upward, hence "growth."
[13897] <prose> Memory:
[13898] <prose> The mother's red conditional bindu,
[13899] <prose> Residing the size of a tenth of a mustard seed,
[13900] <prose> Serves as the support for memory's manifold activity, hence "memory." || 70 ||
[13901] <prose> Thus, in the flavors resides the wind bindu, the size of a tenth of a mustard seed,
[13902] <prose> Which separates pure from impure,
[13903] <prose> Expelling impurities such as precious bile outward,
[13904] <prose> The pure generates the body's radiance and splendor, hence "flavors."
[13905] <prose> At the tip:
[13906] <prose> Hence, resides the light bindu, the nature of mind, the size of a tenth of a mustard seed, hence "tip."
[13907] <prose> These are called the supports of the relative.
[13908] <prose> When these move, body and mind separate.
[13909] <tantra> From that relative cause ripens into blood,
[13910] <tantra> From blood comes flesh, || 80 ||
[13911] <tantra> From flesh comes lymph,
[13912] <tantra> From lymph comes serum,
[13913] <tantra> From serum comes fat,
[13914] <tantra> From fat comes bone,
[13915] <tantra> From bone comes bone marrow,
[13916] <tantra> From bone marrow comes regenerative fluid,
[13917] <tantra> From regenerative fluid ripens the relative bindu.
[13918] <prose> Similarly, the four knots of Kyangma generate:
[13919] <prose> Two flickering water-lamp seeds, like rabbit eyes, reside there.
[13920] <prose> At memory: || 90 ||
[13921] <prose> Resides the blazing fire bindu, support of self-arisen wisdom lamp.
[13922] <prose> At flavors:
[13923] <prose> Resides the five-colored light bindu, size of a mustard seed with aura, support of pure space.
[13924] <prose> At the tip:
[13925] <prose> Resides the light bindu, the support of the bindu of emptiness, each with their own colors.
[13926] <prose> Relying on that, ultimate undefiled wisdom directly dawns.
[13927] <prose> Relying on that, one naturally becomes a Buddha.
[13928] <prose> Therefore, it is called the natural bindu.
[13929] <prose> When the gates are pure, they become the four lamps.
[13930] <prose> When impure, they become the four elements. || 100 ||
[13931] <prose> The central Kundarma:
[13932] <prose> Is the gathering of the nature of all channels.
[13933] <prose> Moved by wind's attraction and expulsion, it quivers.
[13934] <prose> Being the ground of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, it is called "ma."
[13935] <tantra> From there moves the ultimate bindu of dharmatā.
[13936] <prose> Its four knots:
[13937] <prose> At generation:
[13938] <prose> Resides the support of all bodies, the body the size of a mustard seed with clear light face and arms.
[13939] <prose> At memory:
[13940] <prose> The support of wisdom, the celestial palace with four gates, || 110 ||
[13941] <prose> Four archways,
[13942] <prose> And each deity's body color and hand implements, clear on a mustard seed,
[13943] <prose> Each one's mandala perfected according to one's affinity.
[13944] <prose> Through its essential point, the attainment of the flower-struck mandala is close.
[13945] <prose> At the tip:
[13946] <prose> Resides the support of all lights, the wrathful mandala.
[13947] <prose> Moreover, from the central channel without blood or serum, the empty wind activity,
[13948] <tantra> From the right circulate water, blood, and bodhicitta, the activity of bindu,
[13949] <tantra> From the left circulate element essences and wisdom, the channel's own activity.
[13950] <ornament> The second: Detailed explanation of classifications has two parts: || 120 ||
[13951] <prose> General exposition of the nature of the three principal channels,
[13952] <prose> And particular explanation of the four wheels.
[13953] <ornament> The first:
[13954] <tantra>From the Definitive Meaning:
[13955] <tantra>The body's essential point is the channel,
[13956] <tantra>Location, arrangement, and movement,
[13957] <break> <tantra>Support of wheels and body life-force,
[13958] <break> <tantra>Name, particularity, cause and condition,
[13959] <tantra>Active function and characteristic,
[13960] <tantra>Afflictive activity and wisdom activity, || 130 ||
[13961] <tantra>Depending on activity, they manifest,
[13962] <tantra>Illness and element particularities,
[13963] <tantra>Resting as agitation, distinguished by extent,
[13964] <tantra>Cutting stops, pressing binds,
[13965] <tantra>Pressing vital point, pulling clarifies,
[13966] <tantra>Pulling crosses, drawing knows,
[13967] <tantra>Pushing emptiness, fierce seizes,
[13968] <tantra>Thus also through the channel's essential point,
[13969] <tantra>The Buddha's abode is indicated.
[13970] <tantra>Thus it was taught. || 140 ||
[13971] <prose> Explaining its meaning has eight parts:
[13972] <prose> Channel names,
[13973] <prose> Purifiers,
[13974] <prose> Indicators,
[13975] <prose> Generation methods,
[13976] <prose> Activities performed,
[13977] <prose> Essence,
[13978] <prose> dharmatā,
[13979] <break> <prose> And oral instructions on how to train.
[13980] <break> <ornament> The first: || 150 ||
[13981] <prose> Generally, if one body is not established, nothing is established.
[13982] <prose> Once established, channels are established.
[13983] <tantra> From channels, winds and wisdoms are established.
[13984] <prose> Through their essential point, liberation occurs,
[13985] <prose> Hence recognizing channels.
[13986] <prose> Generally, 72,000 channels reside in the body.
[13987] <prose> Particularly at generation: sixty-four.
[13988] <prose> At memory: sixteen, making eighty.
[13989] <prose> At flavors:
[13990] <prose> Thirty-two, making one hundred twelve. || 160 ||
[13991] <prose> At the tip:
[13992] <prose> Three hundred sixty,
[13993] <prose> Making 472 when the four wheels are combined—the particular summary.
[13994] <prose> The three channels emerge straight like life-trees from the centers of the four wheels without crookedness,
[13995] <prose> Outwardly serving as the support of body, speech, and mind,
[13996] <prose> Inwardly connecting through the three vajras of body, speech, and mind,
[13997] <prose> Secretly serving as the ground for the arising of the three kayas.
[13998] <prose> The three channels are:
[13999] <prose> Roma,
[14000] <prose> Kyangma, || 170 ||
[14001] <prose> And Kundarma.
[14002] <break> <prose> Within these three reside OM, AH, and HUM,
[14003] <break> <prose> When pure, serving as the ground for ripening into the three kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[14004] <prose> When impure, serving as the ground for ripening into body, speech, and mind.
[14005] <prose> When impure, serving as the ground for ripening into body, speech, and mind.
[14006] <prose> Through perversion, opening the door for the arising of the three poisons.
[14007] <prose> Moreover, "Roma" means:
[14008] <prose> Through cutting, it tastes the supreme food-like flavor,
[14009] <prose> When left in its nature, like a corpse's flavor, unable to function.
[14010] <prose> This resides in the male's right, the female's left. || 180 ||
[14011] <tantra> Some tantras show the reverse—this is merely a different intention.
[14012] <prose> Kyangma:
[14013] <prose> Through pulling, dharmas free of thought-experience arise, hence Kyangma,
[14014] <prose> When left in its nature, unrelated to others, remaining hollow.
[14015] <prose> This resides in the male's left, the female's right.
[14016] <prose> Kundarma:
[14017] <prose> Resides in the center of both male and female,
[14018] <prose> Through pressing, the experience of clear wisdom arises,
[14019] <prose> When left in its nature, performing the activity of sustaining body, speech, and mind.
[14020] <prose> Since these three channels are the mother-ground of all channels, they are called "ma." || 190 ||
[14021] <prose> Roma entering the male's right:
[14022] <prose> Generates bodhicitta.
[14023] <prose> Arising in the female's left:
[14024] <prose> Bodhicitta gathers, without satisfaction in desire.
[14025] <prose> Kyangma entering the male's left:
[14026] <prose> Holds the power of blood's attractive force,
[14027] <prose> Through the activity of dripping blood from the nose, determining the time of wisdom.
[14028] <prose> Entering the female's right:
[14029] <tantra> From that, branching into the five-family channels, manifesting as indications of illnesses and race differences not found in males.
[14030] <prose> Moreover, of bluish color, short stature, beautiful teeth, round face, deer-type—the principal deer-channel, || 200 ||
[14031] <break> <prose> For example, like the deer's anaya muscle, thick at the root, greatly desirous,
[14032] <break> <prose> Fine at the tip, unable to actually release bodhicitta.
[14033] <prose> Here, the essential point of making the bindu's vital point into the path is chief—the oral instruction of moving channels.
[14034] <prose> Also, pale complexion, straight yellow hair, thin body, prominent navel,
[14035] <prose> Round eyes, thin limbs is the elephant-trunk type.
[14036] <prose> Like the elephant's trunk channel, the channel-nose looks upward from the navel,
[14037] <prose> Unable to actually release bodhicitta.
[14038] <prose> Lesser desire:
[14039] <prose> Arises from burst channels.
[14040] <prose> Here, the oral instruction of straightening channels is chief. || 210 ||
[14041] <prose> Also, black color, coarse limbs, rough face, unpleasant appearance:
[14042] <prose> Lotus-possessor,
[14043] <prose> Having a channel like an open lotus,
[14044] <prose> Round channel-mouth, unable to actually release bodhicitta.
[14045] <prose> Being long, great bliss.
[14046] <prose> Here, opening the channel-mouth is chief.
[14047] <prose> Also, blue-green color,
[14048] <prose> Sharp teeth,
[14049] <prose> Long eyes and face,
[14050] <prose> Yellow hair, some thin, || 220 ||
[14051] <prose> Thin limbs, prominent navel, slow gait is the line-marked type.
[14052] <prose> Like a drawn-line channel, located in the place of joy, initially great bliss of flavor.
[14053] <prose> Abundant channel-branches, unable to actually produce bodhicitta.
[14054] <prose> Many channel-branches, whatever is touched generates production.
[14055] <prose> Here, the oral instruction of gathering channels is chief.
[14056] <prose> Also, yellow color,
[14057] <prose> Short stature,
[14058] <prose> Thin teeth,
[14059] <prose> Clear brow-space,
[14060] <prose> Short limbs, || 230 ||
[14061] <prose> Wide fingers is conch-possessor.
[14062] <prose> Like a conch coiling to the right,
[14063] <prose> Unable to actually release bodhicitta.
[14064] <prose> Coiled channel, not finding the flavor of desire.
[14065] <prose> Here, the oral instruction of splitting channels is chief.
[14066] <prose> Thus, the five-family channels coming to females arise from the five poisons being particularly coarse,
[14067] <tantra> From that, thirty-two different movements and deceptions arise,
[14068] <prose> Existing are thirty-two different types of illness—arising from race channels.
[14069] <prose> Moreover, from 101 wisdom-race channels,
[14070] <prose> The five races also exist within the fetus-consuming worm's own illness in females, || 240 ||
[14071] <prose> Arising from the five-race ayatanas.
[14072] <prose> Besides that, ten different illness types exist in the menses,
[14073] <prose> Five illnesses of engagement,
[14074] <prose> Five illnesses of the vessel's holding,
[14075] <prose> Seven illnesses of the abiding seed,
[14076] <prose> Making thirty-two particularly existing in females, not found in males.
[14077] <prose> Moreover, contextually, females surpass males in the vessel womb,
[14078] <prose> Non-flowing of seeds,
[14079] <prose> And activities of many worms, etc.
[14080] <prose> Generally, many illnesses enter from the vessel womb, || 250 ||
[14081] <prose> Not existing in males, hence fewer are taught.
[14082] <prose> Race channels,
[14083] <prose> Vessel,
[14084] <prose> And entry—arising from the child's body's generation.
[14085] <prose> Kundarma residing unchanging in the center of both:
[14086] <prose> Indicates Dzogchen, the unfabricated actual ground, for all.
[14087] <ornament> The second: the purifiers of the three special channels:
[14088] <prose> Proficient in Roma's essential point, all bodily activities are purified.
[14089] <prose> Kyangma purifies speech,
[14090] <prose> Kundarma purifies mental activities. || 260 ||
[14091] <ornament> The third: what these channels indicate:
[14092] <prose> Roma indicates bliss as thought-free; through dependent origination's wheel, memory exhausts, becoming like the aspect of taste, hence "Roma."
[14093] <prose> Kyangma:
[14094] <prose> Indicates clarity as non-dual with flavor, abiding in the meaning of singular bindu, hence "Kyangma."
[14095] <prose> Kundarma indicates union without difference, means-bliss and wisdom-emptiness united,
[14096] <prose> Relative object-possessor and ultimate non-object-possessor both united,
[14097] <prose> Called the view of pure non-dual beyond extremes without difference.
[14098] <prose> Moreover, the right indicates means, the left indicates wisdom.
[14099] <prose> The center indicates non-dual.
[14100] <ornament> The fourth: how these channels generate: || 270 ||
[14101] <prose> Roma generates the body—initially body-forming from the four elements' activity,
[14102] <prose> Arising from father's cause and water, ripening in co-emergent karmic mechanism, taking the body's ground,
[14103] <tantra> From mother's condition, fire and wind's ripening mechanism, separating the body's pure and impure,
[14104] <prose> Generating body—the support of bindu drops of regenerative fluid and blood, each the size of a mustard seed, reside at the four wheels' navel.
[14105] <prose> Thus, the four wheels reside as eight causes and conditions,
[14106] <prose> Gathering and expanding the aggregates of eight consciousnesses,
[14107] <prose> Connecting the places.
[14108] <prose> Relatively, the mind's ripening place exists at the twenty-first vertebra of the born,
[14109] <prose> At the female's thirteenth, at the lotus channel's pistil tip.
[14110] <prose> Its branches gather at the breast tips. || 280 ||
[14111] <prose> Their sixteen branches exist at the intersection.
[14112] <prose> The male's exists between the ribs.
[14113] <prose> They perform the activities of body-forming, abiding, and dissolving.
[14114] <prose> Kyangma generates:
[14115] <prose> Speech.
[14116] <prose> If without crookedness and straight, speech is pleasant, signs clear.
[14117] <prose> If subtle branches exist, voice cracks, short,
[14118] <prose> Or unclear signs, stuttering comes.
[14119] <prose> Naturally without branches or crookedness.
[14120] <prose> When these channels go to the ten, voice goes gag-gag, abandoning comes. || 290 ||
[14121] <prose> If that channel has upper-lower thick-thin narrowness, voice has many peaks,
[14122] <prose> Obstructions come.
[14123] <prose> If that channel has lapping, voice comes trembling and quivering.
[14124] <prose> If channel is empty, voice comes loud, devouring others.
[14125] <prose> Yogis, through channel oral instructions, can transform these,
[14126] <prose> Split,
[14127] <prose> And press to correct.
[14128] <prose> If Roma's channels contract, body comes to the ten, etc., as before.
[14129] <prose> Residing straight, body's characteristics complete, possessing form and youth,
[14130] <prose> Is good channels bringing body's good qualities. || 300 ||
[14131] <prose> Kundarma generates mind—if many crookednesses in that channel, always distracted, not reaching one-pointedness.
[14132] <prose> If branches exist in it, sharp mind, forgetfulness.
[14133] <prose> If thick-thin exists, much mental fluctuation, not abiding one-pointedly.
[14134] <prose> Beginning many activities, no stability.
[14135] <prose> If that channel is empty, whatever is thought becomes virtue, possessing wisdom, bright mind.
[14136] <prose> If that channel has no thick-thin and is straight, stable mind without fluctuation.
[14137] <prose> If on the right, much thought.
[14138] <prose> If on the left, always dwelling in doubt and hesitation.
[14139] <prose> If that tip moves, always much suffering, unhappy mind.
[14140] <prose> If that channel smooths, always peaceful mind, diligent in virtue. || 310 ||
[14141] <prose> If that channel-mouth large, always great diligence, completing endeavors.
[14142] <prose> Moreover, body generates channels,
[14143] <prose> Channels generate speech,
[14144] <prose> Speech generates mind,
[14145] <prose> Mind generates dharmatā,
[14146] <prose> dharmatā generates yoga, hence "generation."
[14147] <ornament> The fifth: what activities these channels perform:
[14148] <prose> Roma shows the pure essence's lamp-radiance,
[14149] <prose> Impure performs the activity of dripping bile.
[14150] <prose> Kyangma, attracting pure upward, shows the lamp's self-appearance, || 320 ||
[14151] <prose> Causing experience and increase.
[14152] <prose> Its impure, moving downward, discards as precious bile.
[14153] <prose> Kundarma, attracting pure upward,
[14154] <prose> Actually shows ultimate bodhicitta,
[14155] <prose> Impure dripping downward,
[14156] <prose> Causes relative bodhicitta bindu to flow.
[14157] <prose> Moreover, males actually release it,
[14158] <prose> Meeting bliss called "contact-destruction"—
[14159] <prose> Experiencing, before bindu falls, destroying bliss.
[14160] <prose> Females, the five families gathering and abiding, called "increasing contact," bliss expands, unsatisfied. || 330 ||
[14161] <prose> Females' menses flowing:
[14162] <prose> Arises from the nose-channel's movement,
[14163] <prose> Actual blood flowing.
[14164] <prose> Moreover, through the element's essential point, untimely menses flow indicates illness-agitation.
[14165] <prose> Flowing twice or thrice in one month indicates womb-change.
[14166] <prose> Always flowing in the month's upper half indicates male increase.
[14167] <prose> Always flowing in the lower half indicates female increase.
[14168] <prose> Interrupted, making large and small, children don't come.
[14169] <prose> Yellow blood flow and color indicates few children.
[14170] <prose> Black color becoming precious bile, many sons and daughters increase; if odorless and unnoticed flowing, male-female twins come. || 340 ||
[14171] <ornament> The sixth: the essence of these channels:
[14172] <prose> Roma's essence is bliss—possessing special means, liberating into the nature of dharmatā, the pure object of apprehension.
[14173] <prose> Kyangma's essence:
[14174] <prose> Is emptiness—
[14175] <prose> Through pure wisdom, liberating apprehending mind's thought into dharmatā.
[14176] <prose> Moreover, kundarma's essence is bliss-emptiness non-dual, union without two, revealing free wisdom liberated from apprehension and apprehender.
[14177] <prose> The seventh: the dharmatā of these channels:
[14178] <prose> Roma's dharmatā is taking food and separating food's pure and impure.
[14179] <prose> If its passage wide, that person's belly large.
[14180] <prose> If narrow, belly small. || 350 ||
[14181] <prose> If crooked, always vomiting, not taking food.
[14182] <prose> Many sudden various illnesses.
[14183] <prose> Kyangma:
[14184] <prose> Performs the activity of bodily heat's fluctuation.
[14185] <prose> If this channel narrow, body naturally has great heat.
[14186] <prose> If wide, small, always cold.
[14187] <prose> Crookedness, movement, etc., as before.
[14188] <prose> Kundarma:
[14189] <prose> Shows the dharmatā of thirst's varieties and non-thirst.
[14190] <prose> If this narrow, never thirsty. || 360 ||
[14191] <prose> If wide, great thirst.
[14192] <prose> If crooked, shows various uncertain activities.
[14193] <prose> If immediately tangled, various illnesses of body, speech, and mind without autonomy arise.
[14194] <prose> Moreover, proficient in Roma's essential point, cutting food attachment, becomes samadhi-food.
[14195] <prose> Kyangma, cutting clothing attachment, becomes endowed with heat.
[14196] <prose> Central channel, cutting thirst attachment, dream-continuum ceases,
[14197] <prose> Acting in clear light's meaning.
[14198] <prose> These three's essential points are great.
[14199] <prose> The eighth: oral instructions on how to train these channels:
[14200] <prose> Body and Roma joined, body-forming is Sambhogakāya. || 370 ||
[14201] <prose> Abiding is Nirmāṇakāya.
[14202] <prose> Dissolving, liberating into Dharmakāya, body's three-kaya mandala.
[14203] <prose> Kyangma with speech's abiding is samadhi.
[14204] <prose> Speech's expression is meditation.
[14205] <prose> Speech's exhaustion shows these dharmatas,
[14206] <prose> Sound syllables of secret mantra's self-sound.
[14207] <prose> Kundarma with mind's movement, memory-thought pure dharmatā joined, thoughts before and after self-cease, self-liberated self-arisen wisdom joined, objects and conditions liberate into dharmatā,
[14208] <prose> Memory-thought self-exhausted, dharmatā's intention dawns.
[14209] <prose> Thus:
[14210] <tantra>Body is the three-kaya mandala body, || 380 ||
[14211] <break> <tantra>Whatever is spoken is mantra speech,
[14212] <break> <tantra>However contemplated is meditation itself,
[14213] <tantra>As taught in the Pearl Garland Tantra.
[14214] <prose> Moreover, stirring the channel's ripening place, the channel's own characteristic is determined.
[14215] <prose> Seeking the place, dharmatā arising from channels is recognized.
[14216] <prose> Knowing the channel's leap time, death-transference and birthplace are recognized.
[14217] <prose> Channel's nature immersed, mind's samadhi wheel is not separated.
[14218] <prose> Grasping the warmed channel's heat measure, always becomes food yoga.
[14219] <prose> Following channel movement calculation, becomes clothing yoga.
[14220] <prose> Following the channel pushing essential point, for cutting latency continuum, the channel's essential point is extremely profound. || 390 ||
[14221] <ornament> The second: the classification of the four wheels has two parts:
[14222] <prose> The establishment of the four wheels,
[14223] <prose> And explanation of their individual classifications.
[14224] <ornament> The first:
[14225] <prose> Though the body of a single being is established depending on many dharmas depending on wheels,
[14226] <prose> And not depending on wheels,
[14227] <prose> Like external existence's attachment-habit depending on wind, then water,
[14228] <prose> Then depending on water, earth, etc.,
[14229] <prose> Wind-mind gathering in pure essence, water unifying into one, internal body forming,
[14230] <prose> The first wheel is established from water's activity, || 400 ||
[14231] <prose> Arising in the ripening place of blood, serum, saliva, tears, etc.
[14232] <prose> The body's increase and decrease is performed by blood.
[14233] <prose> When elements heat, blood dries, becoming body illness.
[14234] <prose> Increasing blood eliminates illness.
[14235] <prose> When cold, blood freezes, becoming illness.
[14236] <prose> Warming eliminates illness.
[14237] <prose> Thus, earth depending on such water,
[14238] <prose> The second wheel is chief in earth's activity.
[14239] <prose> Earth: body's muscle meat,
[14240] <prose> Organ meat, || 410 ||
[14241] <prose> And meat-varieties spreading from the heart, depending.
[14242] <prose> These, cutting,
[14243] <prose> Patching,
[14244] <prose> Pounding,
[14245] <prose> And piercing cause life-time,
[14246] <prose> Moxibustion, through dependent origination, liberates from illness.
[14247] <prose> Thus, earth generating wood, etc., becomes fire's cause at the egg's empower-place,
[14248] <prose> The third wheel is chief in fire's activity.
[14249] <prose> When heat great, becomes the fire element,
[14250] <prose> Causing body illness and death condition, || 420 ||
[14251] <prose> Thus, when heat small, becomes cold illness condition, causing illness and death condition, balanced elements' dharmatā dependent origination performs liberation.
[14252] <prose> Moreover, like fire generating heat, wind agitating, greatly blazing,
[14253] <prose> The fourth wheel performs wind's activity,
[14254] <prose> Breath moving outer and inner,
[14255] <prose> Performing ascending and descending activity,
[14256] <prose> Karma wind performs saṃsāra's root,
[14257] <prose> Latency and hostility activity agitating body elements' individual activities, causing illness and death condition—
[14258] <prose> Through dependent origination of placing elements at the vital point, liberation.
[14259] <prose> Moreover, depending on water, flesh forms, body's flesh increases.
[14260] <prose> Depending on space-emptiness nature, water forms, blood increases. || 430 ||
[14261] <prose> Depending on earth, ripening into fire, body's heat and pure increase.
[14262] <prose> Depending on fire, forming into wind, breath, radiance, splendor, and strength increase.
[14263] <prose> Moreover, generation transforms into male and female.
[14264] <prose> Memory transforms long and short life.
[14265] <prose> Flavors transform great and small enjoyment.
[14266] <prose> Tip transforms pure and impure sense powers and migrators' friendliness-hostility.
[14267] <prose> Generation's attraction manifests large body, coarse limbs, great strength.
[14268] <prose> Its gathering makes small form, weak strength.
[14269] <tantra> From gathering, large form but weak strength, thin limbs.
[14270] <tantra> From gathering-leap, small form but possessing strength. || 440 ||
[14271] <prose> Memory's attraction makes bright mind, clear senses, no coarse thought.
[14272] <tantra> From gathering, great thought and forgetfulness.
[14273] <tantra> From gathering, clear senses, bright mind, forgetful.
[14274] <prose> Attraction-leap makes great thought but quick samadhi generation.
[14275] <prose> Flavors' pure attraction makes pleasant speech, clear words, skilled sound.
[14276] <prose> Gathering makes unpleasant speech.
[14277] <prose> Increase-impure makes pleasant speech, great eloquence, but speech without power.
[14278] <prose> Tip's pure attraction makes pure mind, accomplishing thought.
[14279] <prose> Increase-impure makes mind's good accomplished, but virtue not increasing.
[14280] <prose> Gathering makes mind's desire unaccomplished, wrong memory-thought. || 450 ||
[14281] <prose> Pure gathering makes mind's desire unaccomplished, but virtue increases.
[14282] <prose> This is the certainty of attraction and gathering.
[14283] <prose> Moreover, the reason for four wheels' certainty:
[14284] <prose> One and two don't ripen empowerment, path, and final result fruit; three also doesn't ripen, reverse certainty also makes four certain.
[14285] <prose> Through connection sequence of what is to be connected and connector, agreement certainty also makes four certain:
[14286] <prose> Outer four elements,
[14287] <prose> Inner four wisdoms,
[14288] <prose> Secret four lamps,
[14289] <prose> Supreme four kayas' certainty also makes four wheels certain.
[14290] <prose> Also, body, speech, mind, and consciousness four, || 460 ||
[14291] <prose> Four purifiers,
[14292] <prose> Four result fruits' certainty also makes their ground the four wheels.
[14293] <ornament> The second: explanation of individual classifications of the four wheels has four parts:
[14294] <prose> Navel Nirmāṇakāya wheel,
[14295] <prose> Heart dharmacakra wheel,
[14296] <prose> Throat Sambhogakāya wheel,
[14297] <prose> Crown great bliss wheel.
[14298] <prose> The first has four:
[14299] <prose> General classification exposition,
[14300] <prose> Individual limb explanation, || 470 ||
[14301] <prose> Particular essential point exposition,
[14302] <prose> Definite correction method explanation.
[14303] <ornament> The first:
[14304] <prose> Root channel, six petals, from four water-channels branching, countless petals,
[14305] <prose> Particularly, inner channel certainty:
[14306] <tantra>Element,
[14307] <tantra>Mind,
[14308] <tantra>Ignorance,
[14309] <tantra>Mind,
[14310] <tantra>Lethargy-gathering classification, || 480 ||
[14311] <tantra>From small wheel petals, thirty-eight, eightfold transformation,
[14312] <tantra>Divided, 2,432 exist.
[14313] <tantra>Moreover, root and limb classification:
[14314] <tantra>Channels residing in wheels,
[14315] <tantra>Nirmana wheel sixty-four petals,
[14316] <tantra>Element, etc., sequence division:
[14317] <tantra>Earth channels in five aspects
[14318] <tantra>Perform body's ground holding.
[14319] <tantra>Water channels in five aspects
[14320] <tantra>Gather body's pure essence. || 490 ||
[14321] <tantra>Fire's pure essence gathering.
[14322] <tantra>Wind channels in five aspects
[14323] <tantra>Gather wind's pure essence.
[14324] <tantra>Mind channels in five aspects
[14325] <tantra>Gather breath's pure essence.
[14326] <tantra>Ignorance channels in five aspects
[14327] <tantra>Show individual body fluid connections.
[14328] <tantra>Space mind channels in two
[14329] <tantra>Gather breath and consciousness pure essence.
[14330] <tantra>Lethargy-gathering channels six || 500 ||
[14331] <break> <tantra>Gather objects and ignorance.
[14332] <break> <tantra>These channel aspects
[14333] <tantra>Fifteen go upward,
[14334] <tantra>Fifteen go downward,
[14335] <tantra>Eight certainly transform horizontally.
[14336] <tantra>Thus it is.
[14337] <ornament> The second: explanation of outer channel limbs:
[14338] <tantra>From that:
[14339] <tantra>From this nirmana wheel,
[14340] <tantra>Aspects transforming outward, || 510 ||
[14341] <tantra>These channel aspects
[14342] <tantra>From its right-left petals,
[14343] <tantra>Great garland-like channels
[14344] <tantra>Transform with color-possessing aspects.
[14345] <tantra>Behind the knee depressions,
[14346] <tantra>Black light-possessing, one each.
[14347] <tantra>To these two, ten each.
[14348] <tantra>From their petals,
[14349] <tantra>Gold-color like channels,
[14350] <tantra>At calf center, one each. || 520 ||
[14351] <tantra>To these two, five each.
[14352] <tantra>Then to wheel petals,
[14353] <tantra>Great transforming channels,
[14354] <tantra>Two mist-like channels
[14355] <tantra>Certainly transform in elephant marrow.</tanqua>
[14356] <tantra>To these two also, five each.
[14357] <tantra>To bliss wheel's mud,
[14358] <tantra>Extremely subtle great channels
[14359] <tantra>At ankle-joint, two each.
[14360] <tantra>To these two, four each. || 530 ||
[14361] <tantra>Thus it is.
[14362] <prose> Thus, outer channel, inner, karma and wisdom movement, etc.:
[14363] <tantra>From that:
[14364] <tantra>These channel aspects
[14365] <tantra>Reside in wheel body.

[14367] <tantra>Sixty-four great channels,
[14368] <tantra>Subordinate channels unimaginable.
[14369] <tantra>These channel aspects
[14370] <tantra>Gathering channels ten reside, || 540 ||
[14371] <tantra>Performing agitation and holding activities.
[14372] <tantra>Among these,
[14373] <tantra>Gathering pure essence one each,
[14374] <tantra>Sometimes agitating elements,
[14375] <tantra>Sometimes latency,
