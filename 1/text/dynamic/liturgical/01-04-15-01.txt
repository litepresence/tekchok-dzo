[3721] <ornament> First:
[3722] <prose> Arisen, various, causeless, arisen appearance, signless, appeared—
[3723] <prose> That also, from the arisen-place, empty, appeared, liberated, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, nameless.
[3724] <prose> That also, is-not, extremes, definitive, reasoning-by, great-perfection, extremes, beyond, view, established.
[3725] <ornament> Second:
[3726] <prose> Arisen primordial-wisdom is, knowing, other-on, not, relying.
[3727] <prose> Liberated mind is, cause-conditions, applied.
[3728] <prose> Arisen-liberated, non-dual, abiding, result, primordially, liberated.
[3729] <prose> That also, similar-appearances, self-pure, definitive, reasoning-by, great-perfection, appearance-from, liberated, desired.
[3730] <ornament> Third: || 10 ||
[3731] <prose> Free from the extremes of is and is-not, beyond directional fixation,
[3732] <break> <prose> Self-nature without reliance, causeless, primordially pure—
[3733] <break> <prose> Beyond fabrication and correction, through primordial liberation the great expanse beyond extremes is set forth.
[3734] <prose> The great primordial wisdom of self-purified abiding, liberated from the beginning, is called "the exhaustion of self-basis."
[3735] <prose> This too, through the reasoning that engages deluded mind, is intended as self-liberation.
[3736] <prose> The essence is the nature of khra-bo (the variegated space).
[3737] <prose> Speaking of manifold existence:
[3738] <prose> Free from negation, directionless, self-arising everywhere—
[3739] <prose> In spontaneous play, beyond affirmation and negation, this is intended.
[3740] <prose> These divide into three: || 20 ||
[3741] <list> Assertion of existence corresponds to the Mind School, the khra-bo category;
[3742] <list> Assertion of non-existence corresponds to the Self-Essential Point, the khra-bo category;
[3743] <list> Assertion of both existence and non-existence corresponds to Supreme Instruction, the khra-bo category.
[3744] <ornament> The first:
[3745] <prose> The essence of self-purified abiding, nowhere divided, not established as affirmation or negation, transcends conceptual construction.
[3746] <prose> Without duality in characteristic, it does not depart from the single wheel of mind's existence.
[3747] <prose> Through that very activity, unceasingly radiant—
[3748] <prose> It is called "the liberation of appearance and mind without duality."
[3749] <prose> This too, through the reasoning of thought-free self-nature, intends the primordial liberation of all phenomena, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa liberated from their own ground.
[3750] <ornament> The second: || 30 ||
[3751] <prose> Moreover, through the self-nature of appearance-emptiness liberated from its own ground, dharmatā of mind is radiantly displayed in manifold forms.
[3752] <prose> Through liberation of non-appearance from its own ground, action is freed from virtue and non-virtue.
[3753] <prose> This too, through the reasoning of transformation into emptiness, establishes non-appearance as self-purified.
[3754] <ornament> The third:
[3755] <prose> Through self-emptiness, primordially pure, not relying on action's cause and effect—
[3756] <prose> Through fabrication, it arises;
[3757] <prose> Through arising as emptiness, it liberates saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in all directions.
[3758] <prose> Through appearance and concept as ground, the reasoning of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's non-establishment appears.
[3759] <prose> Through inexpressibility, the essential point beyond thought;
[3760] <prose> Through being beyond comparison, the essential point beyond meditation; || 40 ||
[3761] <prose> Hence, through liberation from the two of abiding and transformation, the essential point of mind free from transformation—
[3762] <prose> Through these three, the manifestation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's true form is intended.
[3763] <prose> The essence of white space, through the self-liberation of appearance and conditions, without fabrication, pure cause, not to be established in any mode of abiding.
[3764] <prose> Divided—
[3765] <prose><tantra> From the union of view and meditation, the two White Spaces:
