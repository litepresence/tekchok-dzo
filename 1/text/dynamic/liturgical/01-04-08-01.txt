[2989] <ornament> First: When sound is heard, only the sound-holding consciousness arises.
[2990] <prose> As with form and so forth, the holding consciousness does not arise simultaneously.
[2991] <prose> When consciousness enters an object, only that consciousness arises, others do not arise.
[2992] <prose> Whatever the number of aspects, that many consciousnesses are asserted.
[2993] <ornament> Second: Appearances also arise from consciousness in various outer forms.
[2994] <prose> The holding consciousness also arises from mind.
[2995] <prose> As an egg is split, aspects and consciousnesses possessing objects appear in a single mind.
[2996] <prose> When holding objects now, outer aspect consciousness and inner-holding consciousness both arise.
[2997] <prose> Through beginningless latent tendencies, both appear thus.
[2998] <prose> Self-awareness alone, nothing else is established—like an egg is split. || 10 ||
[2999] <prose> If one says: "When outer aspect consciousness holds, at that time holding consciousness arises, two thoughts simultaneously"—it does not become thus.
[3000] <prose> It does not change.
[3001] <prose> That aspect consciousness is without thought—for this reason.
[3002] <ornament> Third: When outer objects appear as various aspects,
[3003] <prose> A single inner-holding consciousness knows.
[3004] <prose> As when a monkey quickly enters a fortress,
[3005] <prose> Appearing in four apertures, entering and entering, looking and looking,
[3006] <prose> Entering through the five doors, a single consciousness knows the object.
[3007] <prose> At the moment of knowing, both aspect and consciousness are not different in the nature of a single mind.
[3008] <prose> Like a dream appearance and the self-appearing holder—both are undifferentiated in a single sleep consciousness. || 20 ||
[3009] <ornament> Second: The false aspects.
[3010] <prose> The outer meaning aspect appearing mistakenly to consciousness is a false latent tendency.
[3011] <prose> Not true to consciousness.
[3012] <prose> The meeting consciousness also measures falsity.
[3013] <prose> Experience measures truth—no measurement exists.
[3014] <prose> Both object and consciousness are merely the nature of mistaken false appearance.
[3015] <prose> In this, there is division: the false with stain, the false intermediate, and that which is wished.
[3016] <prose> The stainless, the pure, and the intermediate—these two.
