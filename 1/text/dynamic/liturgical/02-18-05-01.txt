[4601] <ornament> First, speech training:
[4602] <prose> Train in short sessions to speak less, cutting ordinary speech;
[4603] <prose> Then train long;
[4604] <prose> Occasionally, though no cause for speech, speak alone.
[4605] <break> <prose> Abiding: mantra and utterance, etc., virtuous utterance—not denying;
[4606] <break> <prose> Not mixing even one syllable with others.
[4607] <prose> At this time, the body's sign makes meaning understood.
[4608] <prose> Swallowing: not doing all mantra etc. utterance;
[4609] <prose> Firm: not transgressing from the state of not uttering anything—
[4610] <prose> Not even body sign. || 10 ||
[4611] <tantra>From the Seed Tantra:
[4612] <verse> Speech like a mute,
[4613] <verse> Not making sign with anyone,
[4614] <verse> Thus, whoever does this—
[4615] <verse> Mind's projecting and gathering self-cut.
[4616] <tantra>Thus it was said.
[4617] <prose> Cutting speech's speaking, inexpressible meaning arises in mind.
[4618] <prose> Not mixed with other sentient beings' speech—body purified purpose exists.
[4619] <prose> By body purified, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and sky-goer Ḍākinīs
[4620] <prose> Bless, liberating body into illusory body. || 20 ||
[4621] <prose> Then, object blocked, speech purified—
[4622] <prose> Sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes.
[4623] <prose> Speech utterance blocked, mind purified—
[4624] <prose> That sign: first seeing non-human form,
[4625] <prose> Then clairvoyance arises.
[4626] <prose> Thus, speech's main point: instruction on cutting body-mind connection.
[4627] <prose> Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse.
[4628] <tantra>From Thalgyur:
[4629] <verse> Mind placed in dhātu, accomplished.
[4630] <tantra>Thus it was said. || 30 ||
[4631] <prose> Thus, chief body and speech bound, mind secondarily caught—dhātu-awareness dawning, elements' binding cut. From the Seed Tantra:
[4632] <verse> Thus binding body, speech, and three—
[4633] <verse> In dharmadhātu's vision,
[4634] <verse> This becomes habituation.
[4635] <tantra>Thus it was said, and:
[4636] <verse> Body and speech and mind's main-point—
[4637] <verse> Know and rely, liberate from saṃsāra.
[4638] <tantra>Thus it was said.
[4639] <ornament> Second meaning: three main-points relying, direct self-point delivery, three are:
[4640] <list> Bind three main-points in vajra seal; || 40 ||
[4641] <list> Introduce awareness's own face directly;
[4642] <list> Show vision's dawning manner from that.
[4643] <prose> First, two are:
[4644] <list> Show general seal of three main-points,
[4645] <list> Deliver particular self's main-point to point.
[4646] <prose> First: three main-points—gate, field, and wind-awareness.
[4647] <tantra>From Thalgyur:
[4648] <verse> Three main-points—do not separate from instruction;
[4649] <verse> That also: gate and field itself,
[4650] <verse> Wind and awareness main-point itself seal. || 50 ||
[4651] <tantra>Thus said.
[4652] <prose> Example: like weapon hitting vital point—
[4653] <prose> Channels or heart-meaning etcetera main-point hit,
[4654] <prose> Whatever done, not feeling, dying similar.
[4655] <prose> Three main-points also: dharmatā no ground for change.
[4656] <prose> Gate main-point: cause to see;
[4657] <prose> Field main-point: cause not to change;
[4658] <prose> Wind-awareness main-point: deliver to sign-measure.
[4659] <prose> That also: gate main-point like threshold;
[4660] <prose> Field main-point like escort; || 60 ||
[4661] <prose> Wind-awareness main-point like bandit.
[4662] <prose> Arrow hit, person cannot change power, captured;
[4663] <prose> Enemy comes, cannot enter bandit's hand—
[4664] <prose> Impossible not to hit dharmatā direct main-point.
[4665] <prose> That also: field not existing, no basis ground;
[4666] <prose> Gate not existing, beings' path lost;
[4667] <prose> Wind-awareness main-point not existing, knowing-awareness does not penetrate inside—
[4668] <prose> Therefore three main-points determined.
[4669] <prose> More than that: limitless, lose main-point;
[4670] <prose> Few: meaning not accomplished—therefore three determined. || 70 ||
[4671] <ornament> Second: deliver particular self's main-point to point:
[4672] <prose> Determine general sequence of three main-points, deliver individual main-points to point. First: body, speech, mind three not moving, gate and field and wind-awareness bound.
[4673] <prose> Seeing differentiated by lineage scripture:
[4674] <tantra>From the Self-Arising Awareness Tantra,
[4675] <verse> Thus body, etcetera—
[4676] <verse> By fully pressing all main-points,
[4677] <verse> Awareness itself and directly,
[4678] <verse> From guru's instruction, know.
[4679] <tantra>Thus said, and:
[4680] <tantra>From Thalgyur: || 80 ||
[4681] <verse> Relying upon actual main, self mind,
[4682] <verse> Body main-point and speech and also,
[4683] <verse> Relying upon mind main-point,
[4684] <verse> Making wind somehow slow,
[4685] <verse> Arising from fully projecting,
[4686] <verse> Body and mind connection cut that,
[4687] <verse> Not reversing even in three realms.
[4688] <tantra>Thus said, and:
[4689] <verse> Gate: look with three-bodies' eye;
[4690] <verse> Field: separate from obscuration-doer; || 90 ||
[4691] <verse> Wind-awareness: accomplish wisdom by slowness.
[4692] <tantra>Thus it was said.
[4693] <ornament> Second: from three main-points—gate,
[4694] <list> Field,
[4695] <list> And wind-awareness.
