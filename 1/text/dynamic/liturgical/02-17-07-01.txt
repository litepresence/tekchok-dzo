[3005] <prose> First—when fear arises from fierce conditions such as water, fire, dog, enemy, etc.—think that one sits within a dream—this is called harsh-holding, holding certainly.
[3006] <prose> Then, all that was dreamed in whatever manner comes.
[3007] <prose> At the time of holding, emanation.
[3008] <prose> By made emanation, one-to-many—the deity-form of daytime mind, sentient beings, many different appearances—emanate.
[3009] <prose> See like emanation within dream.
[3010] <prose> Then mutual god-naga transformation.
[3011] <prose> Transform male-female.
[3012] <prose> What is certain is arising within dream—trained during the day without distraction from aspiration—transform one-to-many, many-to-one.
[3013] <prose> Then travel there within dream, hear dharma, etc.—mind makes before not-reached places, realms, etc.
[3014] <prose> If these fierce aspirations are made—quickly mastered. || 10 ||
[3015] <prose> Yet some actual dream meditation is explained.
[3016] <prose> Here it is suitable as preliminary—because not free from intellect truth-grasping—merely held dream, emanation-transformation is not the dharmatā meaning.
[3017] <prose> Before most, this exists not explained—a very important point said suppression explanation, dream point oral-instruction, and.
[3018] <prose> Is certainty taken from self-experience.
[3019] <prose> Second, the actual—three:
[3020] <prose> dharmatā-meaning point,
[3021] <prose> Means, and—
[3022] <prose> Focus point,
[3023] <prose> Channel-wind binding point.
[3024] <prose><tantra> From three: train, transform, cut. || 20 ||
[3025] <prose> Meditate all three—very difficult, and—
[3026] <prose> Yet also said whichever one is enough—easy, two medium.
[3027] <prose> When guiding to do practice, train all in this—meditate all time.
[3028] <prose> First train dream—day appearances all—last night's dreamed dream—clear aspiration—make emanate-transform, and.
[3029] <prose> Train outer truth-without time—training-rigpa look—arise-arise base-without, root-free nature—naked, clearly meditate.
[3030] <prose> All fixation-without, truth-without, base-without, recognition-without—recognize appearances' nature—one-pointed—meditate without losing effort-force—appearances only—actually illusion-dream arise—karma, latency, deluded-appearance, deluded-grasping all cease.
[3031] <prose> And arise without distraction from that state within dream.
[3032] <prose> Day-night dharmatā-wheel—not beyond.
[3033] <break> <prose> Dream-transform from appearance-emptiness two.
[3034] <break> <prose> Appearance-transform point—depend made upon showing deity-form in mirror, and. || 30 ||
[3035] <prose> Transform all appearances to deity's mandala, and—
[3036] <prose> Transform to Buddha's realm, and—
[3037] <prose> Do by fierce aspiration transforming illusion's eight-examples.
[3038] <prose> Transform emptiness—like smoke clearing, cloud gathering in sky.
[3039] <prose> Moment-emptiness deluded-appearance—wide flat flat meditate.
[3040] <prose> Become that thus within dream.
[3041] <prose> Upon this itself, how appear time—dream cut.
[3042] <prose> Not establish rigpa-hold top intermediate-space.
[3043] <prose> Not hold appearance form-reflection top here-rig.
[3044] <prose> Not confused by thought of connection between appearance-mind two. || 40 ||
[3045] <prose> On the two pure stages, birth is spoken.
[3046] <prose> The inner warmth is at the sixth.
[3047] <prose> Empty awareness-entity is realized as pure.
[3048] <prose> Whatever mind not do—vast release inner-clear self-clear rigpa.
[3049] <prose> Made thus—first dream coarse.
[3050] <prose> Then subtle.
[3051] <prose> Then fade.
[3052] <prose> Gone increasingly few, finally anything not dream—practice meaning day-night mixed self-clear rigpa concentration—meditation called day-night union.
[3053] <prose> Upon second means-focus point:
[3054] <prose> Stir, and— || 50 ||
[3055] <prose> Squeeze.
[3056] <prose><tantra> From three: throw point.
