[4172] <prose><tantra> The Tantra of indicating words is two:
[4173] <prose><tantra> The Tantra of meaning:
[4174] <prose> Mind itself, naturally clear light, free from the stains of thought,
[4175] <prose><tantra> Always abiding in all, is thus called Tantra,
[4176] <prose><tantra> Being the lineage of the Buddha, thus from Tantra,
[4177] <prose><tantra> Holding the characteristic of the Buddha, thus placed in Tantra.
[4178] <prose><tantra> The Tantra of words:
[4179] <prose> That same indicating basis—name, word, letter's nature, chapter, and so forth—divided,
[4180] <prose> Is the chief method of the creation sequence,
[4181] <prose> The chief discerning of the completion sequence, || 10 ||
[4182] <prose> Both equal parts: the non-dual union,
[4183] <prose> Showing beyond all: the key points of the Great Perfection.
[4184] <prose> The rising measure: chief of the great creation sequence, ten:
[4185] <list> First: basis empowerment and samaya—two,

[4194] <list> Experience and instruction—two. Eight complete: the chief rising measure of the completion sequence.
[4195] <prose> The non-dual union:
[4196] <prose> Both must complete—eighteen.
[4197] <prose> The completely perfect Great:
[4198] <prose><tantra> From creation and completion, the completion sequence.
[4199] <prose> The completion sequence: showing the sequence of channels, winds, and bindu with small elaboration,
[4200] <prose> Showing the sequence of great clear light wisdom—two.
[4201] <prose> Great—that entering the rising measure through the door of empowerment and samaya—two, || 30 ||
[4202] <prose> Path and enumeration—two,
[4203] <prose> Fruition and five complete.
[4204] <prose> Examples: like the warp,
[4205] <prose> Depending on many threads of cause, rolling like cloth,
[4206] <prose> Depending on different words, extracting one meaning.
[4207] <prose><tantra> Valid: Tantra dwelling in self, indicating, thus
[4208] <prose><tantra> Valid as Tantra.
[4209] <prose><tantra> That also, depending on the key of words, bringing meaning's basis to certainty without error, making it realized, thus placed in Tantra.
[4210] <prose> Second, extensively explaining that nature: two.
[4211] <prose><tantra> The meaning Tantra and word Tantra are extensively explained. || 40 ||
[4212] <ornament> First: two,

[4242] <prose> <tantra> One cause of emptiness, without thing,
[4243] <prose> <tantra> Beyond all things' dharma,

[4245] <break> <prose> <tantra> Becoming the basis of all, one nature,
[4246] <break> <prose> <tantra> Pervading lord itself gathered,
[4247] <prose> <tantra> Birthless, memory exhausted,
[4248] <prose> <tantra> From the distinction of nature itself,
[4249] <prose> <tantra> Empty and appearing, appearing and empty,
[4250] <prose> <tantra> Things, without things, also are,
[4251] <prose> <tantra> Exhausted, primordially dwelling in emptiness, || 80 ||
[4252] <prose> <tantra> Cause and condition separated, emptiness's object,
[4253] <prose> <tantra> Pervading vast, without thing, empty by nature,
[4254] <prose> <tantra> Without stain, unmixed, perfect,
[4255] <prose> <tantra> Thoughtless, empty nature,
[4256] <prose> <tantra> Pervading by emptiness, thus called tantra.
[4257] <prose> <tantra> Clear, nature unceasing,

[4259] <prose> <tantra> Clear, warm, cool,
[4260] <prose> <tantra> Vast, moving, nature holding,
[4261] <prose> <tantra> Pervading, primordial tone, self-clear, || 90 ||
