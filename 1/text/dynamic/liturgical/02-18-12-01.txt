[5242] <prose> First, behold the cessation of outer vision:
[5243] <prose> Within each Sphere, half-bodies dawn—
[5244] <prose> Thus manifest through the complete purification of Emanation;
[5245] <prose> Then single bodies self-arise, born of direct perception of dharmatā.
[5246] <ornament> Third: The Vision of Awareness Arriving at Its Measure.
[5247] <ornament> Regarding the manner of this vision and the explanation of its nature—
[5248] <prose> These bodies transform as five Fathers, five Mothers,

[5261] <tantra>From the Thal 'gyur: || 20 ||
[5262] <prose> The Vision of Awareness Arriving at Its Measure—
[5263] <prose> Enjoyment Body's marks and examples clearly manifest
[5264] <tantra> From rainbow lights of indeterminate hue;
[5265] <prose> The five families appear as Fathers and Mothers.
[5266] <break> <tantra>From the Bstan bu:
[5267] <break> <tantra> From such bodies to their utmost limit,
[5268] <prose> Six, ten, and five-three—
