[11825] <ornament> First, the sign of birth in hell:
[11826] <list> At the time of death, the sky gathers with black clouds,
[11827] <prose> And one proceeds as if darkness were spreading.
[11828] <prose> When rain,
[11829] <prose> Mist,
[11830] <prose> Great wind,
[11831] <prose> Hail, and.
[11832] <prose> Dust-whirlwinds swirl, one takes birth among the eight hot hells,
[11833] <prose> The eight cold hells,
[11834] <prose> The intermittent hells, || 10 ||
[11835] <prose> The neighboring hells,
[11836] <prose> The sentient-being hell Avīci, and.
[11837] <prose> The seven vajra hells.
[11838] <prose> The latter two, although included in the category of the eight hot hells, are distinguished separately due to their long lifespans and great suffering.
[11839] <prose> Moreover, by the karma of immediate actions and so forth; all who take birth in the last of the hot hells dwell for one intermediate kalpa; while those who have abandoned the Dharma remain for billions of hundreds of thousands of kalpas longer—hence it is called the Unbearable Sentient-Being Hell; As proclaimed in the Noble Sūtra of the Transcendence of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines:
[11840] <prose> Through the ripening of the karma of abandoning Dharma,
[11841] <prose> One takes birth in the great unbearable sentient-being hell,
[11842] <prose> Experiencing unbearable suffering.
[11843] <prose> Even when the great fire-gathering kalpa arises there,
[11844] <prose> One takes birth where the great sentient-being hell exists || 20 ||
[11845] <prose> In the eastern worlds—thus it is proclaimed.
[11846] <prose> To extend throughout the ten directions, limitless and boundless.
[11847] <prose><tantra> Therefore, having entered the gate of Secret Mantra, breaking great samaya with the vajra guru produces long lifespans and great suffering. From the Supreme Samaya Arrangement, the Tree Tantra:
[11848] <prose> <tantra> Whoever toward the vajra guru.
[11849] <verse> Bears evil mind, derides,
[11850] <verse> Great samaya-breaking—
[11851] <verse> As long as from the great ocean.
[11852] <verse> The water is exhausted drop by drop,
[11853] <verse> Strand by strand of hair,
[11854] <verse> That water poured out exhausted— || 30 ||
[11855] <verse> For that many ocean-kalpas.
[11856] <verse> One will dwell,
[11857] <verse> Known as the vajra hell.
[11858] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[11859] <prose> Second, the sign of birth as a hungry ghost:
[11860] <list> At the time of death, the sky becomes unclear, rays fade like the western sunset;
[11861] <prose> Sun and moon "die";
[11862] <prose> Yellow clouds obscure, sun and moon invisible;
[11863] <prose> Rain falls with cold traces;
[11864] <prose> Or in the evening, rain falls— || 40 ||
[11865] <prose> These are for hungry ghosts with outer obscuration,
[11866] <prose> Inner obscuration,
[11867] <prose> Sudden obscuration,
[11868] <prose> Distinctive obscuration,
[11869] <prose> Inverted obscuration, and.
[11870] <prose> Karma and karmic-category obscuration—
[11871] <prose> In these, one takes birth.
[11872] <prose> Third, the sign of animals:
[11873] <list> At the time of life-transference, the sky is gloomy with warmth without oiliness, black clouds gather,
[11874] <prose> Or fog banks obscure, || 50 ||
[11875] <prose> Smoke-form valleys appear blue-gray and one proceeds,
[11876] <prose> Gloomy, joyless sky appearing—one takes birth among creeping creatures with many legs,
[11877] <prose> Without legs,
[11878] <prose> Four-legged,
[11879] <prose> Winged, and.
[11880] <prose> Clawed, and so forth.
[11881] <prose> Fourth, the sign of birth as a demigod:
[11882] <list> At the time of death, strong wind rises from all directions,
[11883] <prose> Black clouds like terrifying creatures appear,
[11884] <prose> Clouds greatly disturbed, fierce thunder, lightning garlands flash, roaring sounds— || 60 ||
[11885] <prose> Sun and moon's light cloud-obscured,
[11886] <prose> Demigods with five projections,
[11887] <prose> Six faces,
[11888] <prose> Long arms,
[11889] <prose> Great belly-serpent, and.
[11890] <prose> Sky-going long-haired—five take birth.
[11891] <prose> Fifth, the sign of birth as a god:
[11892] <list> At the time of separating from breath,
[11893] <prose> The sky is clear, sun and moon clear, without yellow wind, directions beautiful, greatly joyful—
[11894] <prose> This is for desire realm gods of six races, || 70 ||
[11895] <prose> Pure realm five,
[11896] <prose> Clear light fifteen, and.
[11897] <prose> Formless four—sign of taking birth-place.
[11898] <prose> Sixth, the sign of birth as a human:
[11899] <list> At the time of death, the sky extremely clear and pure, without yellow dust,
[11900] <prose> Soft white clouds like stretched silk,
[11901] <prose> Sun and moon with rainbow light—
[11902] <prose> In sequence:
[11903] <prose> Merely human body,
[11904] <prose> Pure, || 80 ||
[11905] <prose> Jewel birth-place—sign of birth.
[11906] <prose> These are the general arrangements.
[11907] <prose> When examined specifically,
[11908] <prose> Bad—wind and.
[11909] <prose> Hail etcetera, sent by angry non-humans, or.
[11910] <prose> Other evil persons dying—these signs may also be possible.
[11911] <prose> Good—rainbow light and clear sky etcetera, may also be possible for excellent persons transferring to fields, achieving samādhi, life-transference, and so forth.
[11912] <prose> Achieving samādhi,
[11913] <prose> Life-transference, and so forth—
[11914] <prose> Here, possessing the power for signs to arise in one's own mind, || 90 ||
[11915] <prose> While alive, good mind and conduct; at death, good signs of that race—
[11916] <prose> While alive, bad, even if good signs—other's signs arising,
[11917] <prose> In the world called "meeting the rainbow seeker."
[11918] <prose><tantra> From that one's following, learning might arise; therefore these are explained for turning back.
[11919] <prose> <tantra> As proclaimed in the Blazing Relics Signs Tantra:
[11920] <verse> Thus for all sentient beings,
[11921] <verse> When the life-formations are enacted,
[11922] <verse> By the sky's own characteristic.
[11923] <verse> All these exercise in birth-places.
[11924] <verse> Whoever dies, at that time || 100 ||
[11925] <verse> The sky turns gloomy-black, darkness black,
[11926] <verse> Likewise rain and steam and wind,
[11927] <verse> Hail and dust-whirlwinds arise—
[11928] <verse> To whoever these befall,
[11929] <verse> Without intermediate state,
[11930] <verse> They become in hell's birth-place,
[11931] <verse> O Ḍākinī.
[11932] <verse> Sky like mist, light yellow,
[11933] <verse> Sun and moon die,
[11934] <verse> Without wind and dust, || 110 ||
[11935] <verse> Yellow mist, sun not visible,
[11936] <verse> Rain or traces, or at twilight.
[11937] <verse> These will fall—thus to whoever.
[11938] <verse> These befall, in hungry ghost.
[11939] <verse> Birth-place they are born, O Ḍākinī.
[11940] <verse> Sky gloomy without wind,
[11941] <verse> Clouds black without gaps,
[11942] <verse> Or mist appears,
[11943] <verse> Gloomy joyless—whoever.
[11944] <verse> Does the life-formation, || 120 ||
[11945] <verse> This is the animal place.
[11946] <verse> Greatly fierce, disturbed by wind,
[11947] <verse> Clouds black-massed, fearful forms,
[11948] <verse> Greatly disturbed with coming-going,
[11949] <verse> Thunder and lightning's tongue protrude,
[11950] <verse> Sun and moon unable to be seen—
[11951] <verse> Thus to whoever these befall,
[11952] <verse> This is the asura birth-place.
[11953] <verse> Sky clear and pure,
[11954] <verse> Sun and moon's appearance clear, || 130 ||
[11955] <verse> Wind and dust unable to rise,
[11956] <verse> This is the god's birth-place.
[11957] <verse> Also in clear pure sky,
[11958] <verse> Undivided clouds like white silk,
[11959] <verse> Greatly thin, thread-like appear,
[11960] <verse> Or sun and moon with light-housed—
[11961] <verse> Thus to whoever these befall,
[11962] <verse> This human birth-place is obtained.
[11963] <verse> Thus whoever possesses signs,
[11964] <verse> Is certainly of the six races; || 140 ||
[11965] <verse> Formations without such signs.
[11966] <verse> Are signless and uncertain.
[11967] <verse> Thus all those signs.
[11968] <verse> Come from two to three days,
[11969] <verse> These are signs of birth there.
[11970] <verse> In that birth-place—thus proclaimed.
[11971] <prose> Even those who die without signs—where they take birth is known by their own karma.

[11974] <prose> Consciousness becoming gloomy, or thinking one dwells among animals, || 150 ||
[11975] <prose> Or not seeing lands of humans before,
[11976] <prose> Or the experience inside Meru or inside the ocean,
[11977] <prose> Or appearances of seeing inside divine mansions or pleasure groves,
[11978] <prose> Or seeing appearances like white clarity—these are explained in the sūtras as inner signs certain for individual six realms.
[11979] <prose> Also from the tantra sections:
[11980] <prose> Warmth from the soles of the feet,
[11981] <prose> Teeth,
[11982] <prose> Navel, and.
[11983] <prose> Throat,
[11984] <prose> Between the eyebrows, || 160 ||
[11985] <prose> And dissolving from the crown are said to be signs of taking birthplaces of the six realms.
[11986] <prose> Also, though signs that have arisen appear in agreement with one's own mind, they should be known as certain signs of individual birthplaces.
[11987] <prose> <tantra> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[11988] <verse> The certain establishment of the arrangement of signs of the three times—the twenty-second chapter.
[11989] <verse> Thus having shown the sequence of signs, the method of liberation in this life for those of excellent faculties, effort, and places of the general instruction,
[11990] <verse> Now, for establishing extensively the Dharma arrangement of completely perfect buddhahood in the bardo for those of medium faculties, there are two:
[11991] <verse> The general establishment of the intermediate state and.
[11992] <verse> The extensive explanation of individual natures.
[11993] <verse> First, regarding the essence of the intermediate state:
[11994] <verse> Definition, || 170 ||
[11995] <verse> Division,
[11996] <verse> Appearance pattern,
[11997] <verse> And ground boundary—five aspects.
[11998] <prose> Thus have been extensively shown the arrangement of signs of the three times.
[11999] <verse> Definition,
[12000] <verse> Division,
[12001] <verse> Appearance pattern,
[12002] <verse> And ground boundary—four aspects.
