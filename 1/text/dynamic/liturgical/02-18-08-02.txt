[5035] <prose>Second: extend session, extend duration;
[5036] <prose>third: without day-night, take experience,
[5037] <prose>place awareness in dhātu fence, make not move.
[5038] <tantra>From Blazing Lamp:
[5039] <verse>Dhātu makes awareness's self-field;
[5040] <verse>vajra itself is hanging-cord;
[5041] <verse>make place this inside.
[5042] <verse>Thus it was said.
[5043] <prose>Fruit is:
[5044] <prose>when outer dhātu-vision, eye not moving, self time; || 10 ||
[5045] <prose>inner: awareness abiding in base, cause resonance to dissolve from self, circle;
[5046] <prose>separate lung wind horse cause;
[5047] <prose>wisdom sky dissolves into dhātu sky, cause equal limitless liberation;
[5048] <prose>pure awareness, not moving in dhātu, abides in nature of luminous-clear intent, heart-in mode.
[5049] <prose>That yogin: called capturing original dharmatā luminous-clear, from samsāra name empty,
[5050] <prose>three-realms corpse cut is. || 20 ||
[5051] <tantra>From Thalgyur:
[5052] <verse>That dharmatā direct main-point:
[5053] <verse>know by seeing only,
[5054] <verse>and realize by that knowing,
[5055] <verse>become liberate by realizing only.
[5056] <verse>Liberate called: not untie.
[5057] <verse>Sky in sky,
[5058] <verse>dissolve nature not-aim cause,
[5059] <verse>equal limitless, not possessing part. || 30 ||
[5060] <verse>Capacity-possess find direct:
[5061] <verse>three-realms samsāra name empty cause,
[5062] <verse>three-realms corpse cut.
[5063] <verse>Thus it was said.
[5064] <prose>Second: from two—experience increasing above vision:
[5065] <prose>briefly show:
[5066] <prose>above above purify dhātu awareness cause;
[5067] <prose>outer: like non-dual abiding of awareness hanging-cord in dhātu-vision;
[5068] <prose>inner: non-dual abiding of awareness dhātu, self-resonance in pure empty dhātu, || 40 ||
[5069] <prose>cause luminous-clear mother-son mix; experience vision increases various.
[5070] <tantra>From Thalgyur:
[5071] <verse>Experience vision increasing above is:
[5072] <verse>from wisdom color outer emerge,
[5073] <verse>up-stand and wing dawn,
[5074] <verse>various points, body itself,
[5075] <verse>clear in coarse vision field. || 50 ||
[5076] <verse>Thus it was said.
[5077] <prose>Extensively explain: two are experience called experience increasing above—
[5078] <list>—knowing experience,
[5079] <list>and vision experience.
[5080] <prose>Knowing experience: worldly knowing experience, samādhi-obtained pleasure happiness, mind desiring song, dance, and so forth, heart desire;
[5081] <prose>transcend knowing experience—empty, clear, extreme separate, realize measure with discriminating-awareness potency.
[5082] <prose>This same: from habituation of first, middle, end—
[5083] <list>—knowing pleasure happiness experience,
[5084] <list>end change experience, and vision experience, three arise.
