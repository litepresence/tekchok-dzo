[7099] <prose> First, the time and signs for empowerment with elaboration:
[7100] <tantra> From showing the crucial point of timing for sequentially entering Empowerment,
[7101] <prose> The Empowerment with elaboration:
[7102] <break> <verse> Rat, dragon, horse, and pig—
[7103] <break> <verse> Especially in these four years,
[7104] <verse> The Empowerment ritual is accomplished.
[7105] <verse> In the four first months,
[7106] <verse> Accomplished for producing complete result at the complete time.
[7107] <verse> From the first day of the waxing moon,
[7108] <verse> Until the time of the full moon. || 10 ||
[7109] <verse> The time for conferral is midday or midnight.
[7110] <verse> According to the particular body of the yogi,
[7111] <verse> Apply to the individual element-year;
[7112] <verse> The Empowerment ritual becomes auspicious.
[7113] <verse> At this time,
<verse> The student possessing Samaya,
[7114] <verse> Bodies of harmonious elements—
[7115] <verse> Number without measure,
[7116] <verse> One hundred, fifty, and so forth,
[7117] <verse> If harmonious with elements, without contradiction.
[7118] <verse> If entering the ritual, || 20 ||
[7119] <verse> Without possessing the lamp flame,
[7120] <verse> Perform the ritual of repairing Samaya;
[7121] <verse> Without defilement, siddhi—
[7122] <verse> Should be taken again and again.
[7123] <verse> Death without meaning, obstacles arise;
[7124] <verse> At complete Empowerment, forcefully exert the recitation.
[7125] <verse> At that time, among gathered relatives,
[7126] <verse> If disease arises in the body,
[7127] <verse> Perform prostration and circumambulation;
[7128] <verse> If chaos arises in speech to anyone, || 30 ||
[7129] <verse> Contemplate and recite the hundred syllables;
[7130] <verse> If mind is hungry or memory fades,
[7131] <break> <prose> Enter the generation and completion stages.
[7132] <break> <verse> If signs of improvement arise,
[7133] <verse> From the beginning, exert the Empowerment ritual.
[7134] <verse> If the substance of accomplishment increases,
[7135] <verse> Having obtained supreme siddhi,
[7136] <verse> Become faithful to the meaning of equality.
[7137] <verse> Having entered the Empowerments,
[7138] <verse> If good signs are always seen, || 40 ||
[7139] <verse> Common siddhi is accomplished thereby.
[7140] <verse> Even possessing experience and knowledge,
[7141] <verse> Through this also, engage in bliss and happiness.
[7142] <verse> To the Guru supreme,
[7143] <verse> Whoever is born with good faith,
[7144] <verse> Through this also, apply to the supreme mudrā.
[7145] <verse> If self sees body and speech blissful,
[7146] <break> <prose> This is the pure Buddha field.
[7147] <break> <verse> Thus the time of Empowerment with elaboration
[7148] <verse> And signs are well explained. || 50 ||
[7149] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7150] <prose> Second, the time and signs of empowerment without elaboration:
[7151] <verse> Also from that source:
[7152] <verse> Now, without elaboration,
[7153] <verse> Time and signs should be clearly shown.
[7154] <verse> In this, there is no distinction of year;
[7155] <verse> Whoever knows.
[7156] <verse> In this time, summer and winter are good;
[7157] <verse> Date on the waxing fortnight;
[7158] <verse> Empowerment time at dawn when sounds become clear. || 60 ||
[7159] <break> <verse> In this, five or six faithful ones,
[7160] <break> <verse> If more than seven, purpose is not accomplished.
[7161] <verse> Thus, son possessing faith,
[7162] <verse> To mind-deed virtuous,
[7163] <verse> To speech possessing Guru's praise,
[7164] <verse> At the time of Empowerment for such,
[7165] <verse> If body is not blissful,
[7166] <verse> Make confession of bodily sins afterwards;
[7167] <verse> Thus for speech and mind also,
[7168] <verse> Begin the deed of sin confession. || 70 ||
[7169] <verse> The time and signs
[7170] <verse> Of empowerment without elaboration are thus explained.
[7171] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7172] <prose> Third, the time and signs of empowerment extremely without elaboration also:
[7173] <verse> From that source:
[7174] <verse> Now, extremely without elaboration,
[7175] <verse> The supreme secret Empowerment,
[7176] <verse> Its time and signs should be explained.
[7177] <verse> That also, not a distinction of year;
[7178] <verse> Accomplished by doing what is self-suitable. || 80 ||
[7179] <verse> Outer time,
<verse> The time of seed entering,
[7180] <verse> For supporting the seed of awakening,
[7181] <verse> If empowered at this time,
[7182] <verse> Explained as increasing the self-arisen seed.
[7183] <verse> At the time of gathering grain and fruit,
[7184] <verse> If the extremely without elaboration empowerment,
[7185] <verse> For completing the fruit of wisdom,
[7186] <break> <verse> Definitely go to the ground of the Three Kayas.
[7187] <break> <verse> Inner time at the waxing moon's increase,
[7188] <verse> Avoiding the waning of date-numbers, || 90 ||
[7189] <verse> For stabilizing experience,
[7190] <verse> Experience and blessing increase upward.
[7191] <verse> Empowerment time at the risen sun-tip,
[7192] <break> <verse> For the purpose of self-arisen wisdom arising.
[7193] <break> <verse> Or at the exhaustion junction of the waning,
[7194] <verse> Do the meaning of exhausting conceptions.
[7195] <verse> One or two fortunate ones,
[7196] <verse> If more than three, purpose is not accomplished.
[7197] <verse> At this time, holding individual directions:
[7198] <verse> At the time of body, in the sky, || 100 ||
[7199] <verse> Clouds, mist, rain,
[7200] <verse> And sounds of wind and so forth;
[7201] <verse> Harsh lands, enemies, thieves,
[7202] <verse> If unpleasant forms arise,
[7203] <verse> Great sins of body;
[7204] <verse> Having made empowerment afterwards,
[7205] <verse> Without Guru's instruction shown,
[7206] <verse> To the Sugata's form,
[7207] <verse> Or to one's own Guru's dwelling,
[7208] <verse> Six hundred thousand circumambulations, || 110 ||
[7209] <verse> Or one hundred thousand prostrations should be done.
[7210] <verse> At that time, the particular sign:
[7211] <verse> Beginning present, end and middle,
[7212] <verse> From definite sign-forms,
[7213] <verse> Body's conduct is purified,
[7214] <verse> Afterwards exertion is not needed.
[7215] <verse> If the end arises,
[7216] <verse> Body's completion is not finished;
[7217] <verse> Afterwards begin conduct again,
[7218] <verse> Even again if sins not purified, || 120 ||
[7219] <verse> Meditate one thousand deity forms.
[7220] <verse> Then the Guru's instruction
[7221] <verse> Should be trained in stages.
[7222] <verse> At the time of speech also thus,
[7223] <verse> The yogi possessing should know.
[7224] <verse> If arising in the middle without beginning or end,
[7225] <break> <verse> One hundred thousand hundred syllables,
[7226] <break> <verse> Should be recited with effort.
[7227] <verse> If arising at the end,
[7228] <tantra> The secret mantra Tantra one's age number, || 130 ||
[7229] <verse> One hundred and eight should be recited.
[7230] <verse> At times without beginning, end, or middle,
[7231] <verse> Reading tantra and reciting mantra,
[7232] <break> <verse> And various praises of Guru and yidam deities,
[7233] <break> <verse> Sounds of A-li KA-li letters,
[7234] <verse> Individually recited separately,
[7235] <verse> And hūṃ, phaṭ, and oṃ,
[7236] <break> <prose> Various connected recitations,
[7237] <break> <verse> For seven months should be exerted.
[7238] <verse> Then the instruction place should be done. || 140 ||
[7239] <verse> Yidam deity's samādhi,
[7240] <verse> For three days should be meditated.
[7241] <verse> If arising in the middle,
[7242] <verse> From mantra's light rays emanating and gathering,
[7243] <verse> For seven days should be exerted.
[7244] <verse> If arising at the end, letter's
[7245] <verse> Emanating and gathering should be meditated,
[7246] <verse> For ten days should be exerted.
[7247] <verse> If arising at beginning, middle, and end,
[7248] <verse> Completion stage meditation, || 150 ||
[7249] <verse> Or meditation arising from speech,
[7250] <verse> For six months should be exerted.
[7251] <verse> If also body, speech, and mind's
[7252] <verse> Conduct at individual times,
[7253] <verse> Sky pure blue without clouds,
[7254] <verse> Without wind and hail sounds,
[7255] <verse> Gentle and soft arising,
[7256] <verse> Sins need not be purified.
[7257] <verse> If present at the beginning,
[7258] <verse> And also purified at each end, || 160 ||
[7259] <verse> Through this sins are purified,
[7260] <verse> Confession ritual need not be done.
[7261] <verse> Thus body, speech, and mind's
[7262] <break> <verse> Individual recognition should be examined by the wise;
[7263] <verse> Through that, extremely without elaboration,
[7264] <break> <verse> Empowerment's time and also
[7265] <verse> Examination of signs is explained.
[7266] <verse> Briefly, signs of obtaining empowerment:
[7267] <verse> At the time of scattering the wisdom flower,
[7268] <verse> Body shakes and forcefully jumps; || 170 ||
[7269] <verse> If arising in body, obtained by body.
[7270] <verse> Speech various sounds and voices,
[7271] <verse> Emitting and speaking dharmas,
[7272] <verse> And speaking wondrous words—
[7273] <verse> Thus also obtained by speech.
[7274] <verse> Mind samādhi descending,
[7275] <verse> Distracted and memory lost—
[7276] <verse> By mind empowerment is obtained.
[7277] <verse> If obtained by body,
[7278] <verse> Nirmāṇakāya is obtained thereby. || 180 ||
[7279] <verse> Thus for speech, Saṃbhogakāya;
[7280] <verse> Mind goes to Dharmakāya's field.
[7281] <verse> Extremely without elaboration time and signs explained.
[7282] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7283] <prose> Fourth, the time and signs of completely without elaboration also:
[7284] <verse> From that source:
[7285] <verse> Completely without elaboration,
[7286] <verse> Time and signs should be definitely shown.
[7287] <verse> Outer time, fruit ripening,
[7288] <verse> Or time of gathering grains, || 190 ||
[7289] <verse> Entrusted for liberating as fruit self-appearance.
[7290] <verse> Inner time,
<verse> The first day of waxing moon,
[7291] <verse> Or entrusted to the exhaustion junction,
[7292] <verse> Having realized the single bindu,
[7293] <verse> For exhausting actions and latencies.
[7294] <verse> Even if more than one fortunate one,
[7295] <verse> By the yogi purpose is not accomplished.
[7296] <verse> Son pleasing to the faithful mind,
[7297] <verse> Having fortune, empower to one.
[7298] <verse> Both to perfect Buddha, || 200 ||
[7299] <verse> Will definitely become without doubt.
[7300] <verse> Empowerment time at risen sun-tip,
[7301] <verse> Through individual words definitely clear,
[7302] <verse> Seeing the pure nature ground.
[7303] <verse> Whatever sign arises here,
[7304] <verse> No ritual of purifying sins.
[7305] <verse> For directly purifying above,
[7306] <verse> If cloudless clear sky,
[7307] <verse> Move in Dharmakāya's field.
[7308] <verse> If various light rays shine, || 210 ||
[7309] <verse> This is in Saṃbhogakāya's field.
[7310] <verse> If various sounds resound,
[7311] <verse> Nirmāṇakāya's field, breathe out.
[7312] <verse> If possessing fortune,
[7313] <break> <prose> At this time, skilled in body key points,
[7314] <break> <verse> And unmoving from that,
[7315] <verse> In seven years reaches exhaustion ground.
[7316] <verse> If speech's expression is lost,
[7317] <verse> This one in twenty-one months,
[7318] <verse> Reaches the ground of nature's exhaustion. || 220 ||
[7319] <verse> If skilled in mind and winds empty,
[7320] <verse> In seven months this fortunate one,
[7321] <verse> All appearances become exhausted.
[7322] <verse> If to supreme intelligence,
[7323] <verse> Beginning with elaboration,
[7324] <verse> Without interruption gradually,
[7325] <verse> The manner of completing empowerments—
[7326] <verse> To those who become supreme,
[7327] <verse> This is extremely rare,
[7328] <verse> Days and months and years, || 230 ||
[7329] <verse> Matching with one's own experience,
[7330] <verse> Complete the four empowerments.
[7331] <verse> If four empowerments not complete,
[7332] <verse> The extremely without elaboration empowerment,
[7333] <verse> The deep portion's realized object,
[7334] <verse> Through conferring this, empowerment is obtained.
[7335] <verse> Having well examined student's characteristics,
[7336] <verse> Two and three and so forth,
[7337] <verse> Match with student's prosperity measure;
[7338] <verse> Through one's own experience at the end, || 240 ||
[7339] <verse> At special time, supreme is explained.
[7340] <verse> For entering power into the son.
[7341] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7342] <prose> Fifth, the procedure for performing the feast offering:
[7343] <verse> From the Magical Display:
[7344] <verse> Great compassion, great feast offering.
[7345] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7346] <verse> And from the Empowerment King Tantra:
[7347] <verse> To the Guru ripened by empowerment,
[7348] <verse> Supreme offering of gold and silver, || 250 ||
[7349] <verse> One's own body equally offered,
[7350] <verse> Buddha result easily,
[7351] <verse> Having breathed out from saṃsāra,
[7352] <verse> Definitely obtained without doubt.
[7353] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7354] <verse> And from the Jeweled Empowerment Tantra:
[7355] <verse> Result easy and effortless,
[7356] <verse> Mind-generation, awakening completed,
[7357] <verse> For fulfilling needs and desires, Guru—
[7358] <verse> Like the wish-fulfilling cow. || 260 ||
[7359] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7360] <prose> And after empowerment, through making offerings and feast celebration,
[7361] <prose> Here also one obtains the perfection of one's desired purpose,
[7362] <prose> And in future time obtains perfect power, glory, and good qualities,
[7363] <prose> And afterwards manifests and awakens in ornamentally arrayed Buddha fields.
[7364] <verse> Thus also from the Vast Empowerment:
[7365] <verse> Desired purposes are perfected,
[7366] <verse> Glory, fame, wisdom,
[7367] <verse> Power and goodness bestowed,
[7368] <verse> Buddha fields well-arrayed, || 270 ||
[7369] <verse> Manifestly perfected awakening.
[7370] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7371] <prose> And at other times, gathering immeasurable accumulations,
[7372] <prose> At this time gathered increases a hundred thousand-fold.
[7373] <prose> Through its power, all purposes of thought are accomplished here,
[7374] <prose> And food, wealth, and so forth, special gathering definitely accomplished without difficulty.
[7375] <tantra> From completing the two accumulations, the two kayas are accomplished.
[7376] <verse> From the Jeweled Empowerment Array:
[7377] <verse> The fortunate one who relies on empowerment,
[7378] <verse> Completing the two accumulations,
<verse> The result, || 280 ||
[7379] <verse> Definitely obtains the meaning of the supreme two.
[7380] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7381] <prose> At this time, having offered various foods, drink, wealth, and so forth to the root Guru,
[7382] <prose> The merit of offering hundreds at other times and offering here—this offering here has greater merit.
[7383] <prose> At this time, giving to one woman and giving to one man—the merit of these two,
[7384] <prose> And elsewhere making great feast offering to a hundred thousand ḍākinīs—the merit of these two,
[7385] <prose> The one given at this time is superior.
[7386] <prose> And at this time, for the Guru, all Buddhas of the ten directions gathered with one-pointed compassion,
[7387] <break> <prose> Performing the activity of empowerment, turning the supreme wheel, and entering the great liberation city—
[7388] <break> <prose> And for women and men also, with heroes and heroines and supports arranged in empowerment rows, || 290 ||
[7389] <prose> Abiding with compassion and Samaya, blessing is bestowed,
[7390] <prose> Therefore the two times—empowerment time and feast celebration time—are shown to increase a hundred thousand-fold more than others.
[7391] <verse> Thus also:
[7392] <verse> From the Essence of Empowerment Classifications:
[7393] <verse> Through great feast offering worship,
[7394] <verse> To Guru and Guru's retinue,
[7395] <verse> To all including the mother,
[7396] <verse> Whoever makes feast offering,
[7397] <verse> Even if pleasing all Buddhas
[7398] <prose> Then the lama's oral instruction: || 300 ||
[7399] <verse> If touching the Guru's body pores
[7400] <verse> With sandalwood,
[7401] <verse> Here merit is limitless.
[7402] <verse> Thus one's own vajra siblings,
[7403] <verse> One, two, and three,
[7404] <verse> Or countless hundreds and thousands,
[7405] <verse> Whoever makes feast gathering,
[7406] <verse> If at non-empowerment time,
[7407] <verse> Worshipping one's own Guru,
[7408] <verse> Having done countless hundreds, || 310 ||
[7409] <verse> The merit of one done here
[7410] <verse> Cannot be measured by mind.
[7411] <verse> Through great food and drink feast,
[7412] <verse> If yogis are pleased,
[7413] <verse> All goodness is accomplished,
[7414] <verse> And liberated from faults.
[7415] <verse> If vajra sister,
[7416] <verse> Or Guru's student,
[7417] <verse> To the assembly of ḍākinīs,
[7418] <verse> If pleased with feast gathering, || 320 ||
[7419] <verse> To the eight mamos or Vārāhī,
[7420] <verse> Nine hundred feast offerings
[7421] <verse> Done at improper time,
[7422] <verse> At this time to one ḍākinī,
[7423] <verse> Food or drink,
[7424] <break> <verse> Or if giving even a little water,
[7425] <break> <verse> This merit is not equal.
[7426] <verse> Therefore to the ḍākinī city,
[7427] <verse> Go and please the ḍākinīs.
[7428] <verse> Father and mother yogis, || 330 ||
[7429] <verse> Equal and mixed, having worshipped,
[7430] <verse> Here such siddhi,
[7431] <verse> Arises possessing supreme wonder.
[7432] <verse> For desired purpose in this world,
[7433] <verse> And for future wisdom field conduct,
[7434] <verse> Sky-going siddhi,
[7435] <verse> Whoever does various lords,
[7436] <verse> With retinue in space,
[7437] <verse> Able to move as conduct.
[7438] <verse> Thus it is spoken. || 340 ||
[7439] <prose> And if the feast celebration is done extensively,
[7440] <prose> In this very life siddhi of any kind is obtained, for it is the time of special gathering.
[7441] <prose> Explanation of the signs of siddhi:
[7442] <verse> From that source:
[7443] <verse> From previously done feast offering,
[7444] <verse> Eight types of siddhi causes,
[7445] <verse> Yoginīs are explained to obtain.
[7446] <verse> And what are they:
[7447] <verse> Glory, fame, prosperity,
[7448] <verse> Gathering, siblings, obtaining, || 350 ||
[7449] <verse> Worldly empowerment, Buddha accomplishment.
[7450] <verse> Glory is retinue increase,
[7451] <verse> And possessing sons and power.
[7452] <verse> Fame is loving sentient beings,
[7453] <verse> Seeing brings joy and service,
[7454] <verse> Praise and speak pleasant words.
[7455] <verse> Prosperity is wealth and food,
[7456] <verse> And grain and desired purpose accomplished,
[7457] <verse> Fruits and crops ripen and expand,
[7458] <verse> Used without being exhausted. || 360 ||
[7459] <verse> Gathering has four types:
[7460] <verse> Humans, non-humans,
[7461] <verse> Wealth and food gathering.
[7462] <verse> Humans are birth-gatherings, women—
[7463] <verse> First gathering from that,
[7464] <verse> Then thousands gathering,
[7465] <verse> Before spreading and doing prostration,
[7466] <verse> And listening to Dharma.
[7467] <verse> Then kings, ministers,

[7476] <verse> Gods, nāgas, yakṣas,
[7477] <verse> Those delighted in Buddha's teaching,
[7478] <verse> Possessing miracles gathering, || 380 ||

[7480] <verse> Showing forms and world's
[7481] <verse> All good and bad showing.

[7483] <verse> Bestowing good and abandoning bad,
[7484] <verse> Protecting, guarding, concealing,
[7485] <verse> And bestowing various goods.
[7486] <verse> To that one's retinue and relatives,
[7487] <verse> Bestowing good and abandoning bad.
[7488] <verse> Inner food gathering: || 390 ||
[7489] <verse> Whatever exists in this land,
[7490] <verse> Pleasant and supreme-tasted,
[7491] <verse> Many gathering first,
[7492] <verse> Then other lands' food,
[7493] <verse> Fruits with essence,
[7494] <verse> Various medicinal preparations,
[7495] <verse> Wondrous foods,
[7496] <verse> Gather to the fortunate one.

[7523] <verse> Definitely obtaining worldly empowerment,
[7524] <verse> Here is vidyādhara siddhi:
[7525] <verse> Transforming harm to benefit,
[7526] <verse> And empowering others' powers,
[7527] <verse> Able to transform fire to water,

[7535] <verse> Also killing and reviving,
[7536] <verse> Binding, paralyzing, summoning,
[7537] <verse> Expelling and separating activities accomplished.
[7538] <verse> Thus it is spoken. || 440 ||
[7539] <prose> These are established as previously accomplished definite lineages.
[7540] <verse> From that source:
[7541] <verse> If this history is explained,
[7542] <verse> Formerly in central India's Odma Grove,
[7543] <verse> Lord of Gatherings Black Feet,
[7544] <verse> The completely without elaboration empowerment,
[7545] <verse> Especially conferred by me,
[7546] <verse> Six hundred thousand loads of grain,
[7547] <verse> And eating and chewing and tasting,
[7548] <verse> And drinking gathering having done, || 450 ||
[7549] <verse> Five hundred yogis and yoginīs,
[7550] <verse> Great feast celebration done.
[7551] <verse> At that time, one yoginī
[7552] <verse> Said this to that Lord of Gatherings:
[7553] <verse> E ma, one son, fortunate one,
[7554] <verse> Through this feast gathering pleasing,
[7555] <verse> Siddhi will definitely be accomplished for you;
[7556] <verse> I too obtained gathering siddhi.
[7557] <verse> Having spoken, went to the sky.
[7558] <verse> Then at that very time, || 460 ||
[7559] <verse> One hundred thousand elephant riders,
[7560] <verse> With mamos' retinue,
[7561] <verse> Went to the east in the sky.
[7562] <verse> Then after three days passed,
[7563] <break> <verse> That very Lord of Gatherings'
[7564] <break> <verse> Retinue and cattle, dogs, and so forth,
[7565] <verse> Feet not touching the ground a cubit,
[7566] <verse> Going thus.
[7567] <verse> Then that Lord of Gatherings',
[7568] <verse> All substance and prosperity, || 470 ||
[7569] <verse> Again requested empowerment,
[7570] <verse> Having done one feast gathering,
[7571] <verse> By merely doing that,
[7572] <verse> With retinue in the sky,
[7573] <verse> With sound went away.
[7574] <verse> Now in the eastern direction of Jambudvīpa,
[7575] <verse> In the land called Dhartula,
[7576] <verse> In the sky, ḍākinīs
[7577] <verse> Seven hundred thousand with retinue,
[7578] <verse> Accomplishing activities of yogis || 480 ||
[7579] <verse> Perfected in gathering prosperity.
[7580] <verse> Thus wondrous siddhi,
[7581] <verse> Accomplished from feast,
[7582] <verse> Therefore with joy sing songs,
[7583] <verse> And also with joy dance,
[7584] <verse> Various blissful conduct do,
[7585] <verse> Thus doing, feast is accomplished.
[7586] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7587] <prose> And through how much empowerment and its feast celebration are those eight siddhis accomplished:
[7588] <verse> Here showing its number: || 490 ||
[7589] <verse> Also from that source:
[7590] <verse> Thus the fortunate one,
[7591] <verse> Empowerment one's age number,
[7592] <verse> Or one hundred eight or thousand and so forth,
[7593] <verse> Buddha result will be accomplished.
[7594] <verse> Dharma, prosperity, Nirmāṇakāya,
[7595] <verse> Simultaneously obtained definitely.
[7596] <verse> Those obtained arise from empowerment.
[7597] <verse> Through twenty-one empowerments with fame,
[7598] <verse> With feast gathering accomplished. || 500 ||
[7599] <verse> Glory is well accomplished by thirty.

[7602] <verse> Siblings by one hundred twenty-one.
[7603] <verse> World-transforming by two hundred.
[7604] <verse> Buddhas by thousand accomplished.
[7605] <verse> Therefore in empowerment ritual,
[7606] <verse> Without feast, purpose not accomplished.
[7607] <verse> If great feast celebration done well,
[7608] <verse> By yogi purpose well accomplished. || 510 ||
[7609] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7610] <prose> Thus through feast celebration goodness is accomplished.
[7611] <verse> Also from the Great Array:
[7612] <verse> Having obtained empowerment from the Guru,
[7613] <verse> Various foods,
[7614] <verse> Processed cloth and medicinal scents,

[7627] <verse> To countless hundred thousand Buddhas,
[7628] <verse> Offering made, this great purpose. || 530 ||
[7629] <verse> Therefore supreme empowerment feast,

[7632] <verse> Prosperity possessed and accumulations completed,
[7633] <break> <verse> Perfect Buddha's qualities obtained.
[7634] <break> <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7635] <prose> Second topic: the actual path of empowerment has three parts:
[7636] <prose> Where to confer: the arrangement of the maṇḍala;
[7637] <prose> How to confer: the nature of empowerment;
[7638] <prose> Thus conferred: the classification of empowerment. || 540 ||
[7639] <prose> First has three parts:
[7640] <break> <prose> Essence is the definite principal and retinue of self-arisen wisdom including path and result.
[7641] <break> <prose> Etymology: from the Sanskrit word maṇḍala,
[7642] <prose> In Tibetan, maṇḍala; whatever phenomenon with retinue beautifully surrounding the principal is called maṇḍala.
[7643] <prose> Classification is three:
[7644] <prose> Ground spontaneously present root maṇḍala;
[7645] <prose> Path reflection method maṇḍala;
[7646] <prose> Result completely pure nature maṇḍala.
[7647] <verse> Thus also:
[7648] <verse> From Self-Arisen: || 550 ||
[7649] <verse> Maṇḍala is held to be three types:
[7650] <verse> Nature maṇḍala great,
[7651] <verse> Root maṇḍala great,
[7652] <verse> Reflection maṇḍala three shown.
[7653] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[7654] <prose> First is:
[7655] <prose> Self-arisen wisdom abiding in all beings,
[7656] <prose> Light maṇḍala three abiding.
[7657] <verse> From that source:
[7658] <verse> Great root maṇḍala is: || 560 ||
[7659] <verse> Each abiding in each heart center,
[7660] <verse> And this maṇḍala thus:
[7661] <verse> Self-arisen awareness is the center,

[7674] <verse> Speech's maṇḍala unceasing vast,
[7675] <verse> Mind's maṇḍala unthought certainty.
[7676] <verse> Body, speech, and mind's maṇḍalas,
