[8687] <prose> First, regarding the Mudrā: when one has not actually engaged through methods of channel generation and so forth, this is not the time for ordinary desire to flow through one's own continuum—therefore it is called the time of shifting the View.
[8688] <prose> Without the flow of ordinary desire,
[8689] <prose> The bliss depending upon one's own body arises without the mind having power over it.
[8690] <prose> Then, as the actual body extends and Bodhicitta is held, at the time when purification has not yet occurred, special bliss arises; yet the experience is not mixed with one's own continuum, and since emptiness is not recognized as mind,
[8691] <prose> The mind itself is understood merely as empty,
[8692] <list> At the time when ordinary conceptions do not exist in one's own mind whatsoever, this is called the time of obtaining the View.
[8693] <prose> Then, when Bodhicitta is purified and extended to the measure of arrival,
[8694] <prose> As the channels spread and the Mahāmudrā of non-duality of body and mind is experienced—transcending the intellect—this is called the time of stable View.
[8695] <prose> However this is done, through obtaining power over Bodhicitta, there is no change itself.
[8696] <prose> Also from before: || 10 ||
[8697] <prose> Shifting, obtaining, and stability—
[8698] <prose> These proceed to the ground of the Three Kayas.
[8699] <prose> Thus it is.
[8700] <prose> Thirteenth: Thus, having recognized the View, arranging the channel apertures and mixing with the winds, the body strength expands and one joins with ultimate Bodhicitta:
[8701] <prose> When samādhi tires, draw upward;
[8702] <prose> At this time, holding the fist and turning the eyes upward, pressing the wind inside and blocking the channel aperture definitively,
[8703] <prose> Through holding the wind power inside, mixing with the wind and not letting it go inside, body strength expands and so forth arises.
[8704] <prose> As this mixes with bodhicitta and does not come outside, it is a sign of non-extension;
[8705] <prose> Like the juice of pounded acacia,
[8706] <prose> It will not come forth even when rubbed with sesame oil. || 20 ||
[8707] <prose> Seek subsequent knowledge regarding this:
[8708] <prose> Joining with ultimate Bodhicitta.
[8709] <prose> If, not knowing these keys, one makes the path of bliss relying upon Action Mudrā,
[8710] <prose> The bindus stray in the body and go to disease—vomiting in reverse, unable to vomit,
[8711] <prose> Thinking that after drawing upward as a sign of non-extension, vomiting goes as fire and the stomach is unwell.
[8712] <prose> The obstacles of this: tongue contracting, gagging, doing empty vomiting,
[8713] <prose> The stomach mouth becoming unwell and turning to disease,
[8714] <prose> Pain in the right breast and rib side, the armpit gathering, and bodhicitta drying hard, difficult to expel,
[8715] <prose> While doing empty vomiting, blue water drips from the mouth as a side effect.
[8716] <prose> The method to dispel this: || 30 ||
[8717] <prose> Turn the body like a firebrand and speak "Hriṃ Hriṃ" with the speech,
[8718] <prose> Place the mind at the center of the fire,
[8719] <prose> Abandon alcohol and throw salt broth,
[8720] <prose> Eat three white foods and liberation is certain.
[8721] <prose> Fourteenth: For the benefit of the student, turn the Bhaga upward three times;
[8722] <break> <prose> At this time, emitting the sound "OṂ AḤ HŪṂ" is the key for the blessings of the Three Kayas to enter body, speech, and mind.
[8723] <break> <prose> Regarding that, first: mixing with the Guru's body, the student's body becomes self-natured.
