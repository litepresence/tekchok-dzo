[9024] <prose> From the first pure red,
[9025] <verse> Perfect empowerment, round, complete self-clear.
[9026] <verse> From two pure fingers, becomes three.
[9027] <verse> Then by pressing again and again,
[9028] <verse> The colors of the five wisdoms—
[9029] <verse> White, red, green, blue, and yellow—
[9030] <verse> Appear in the field through effort.
[9031] <verse> Then also outer, without effort,
[9032] <verse> Going and coming by wind's portion,
[9033] <verse> From mirror-pure shapes, || 10 ||
[9034] <verse> Appear as portions of two and three.
[9035] <verse> From constant familiarity with that itself,
[9036] <verse> Also by the five-color light,
[9037] <verse> From mere slice, edge-cut appears,
[9038] <verse> See measure from mere field-edge.
[9039] <verse> From finding familiarity's measure from that,
[9040] <verse> With body to bindu center,
[9041] <verse> Abide while in pure half-body,
[9042] <verse> To that with five-five pairs,
[9043] <verse> Connect with very clear bindu, || 20 ||
[9044] <verse> Possessing father-mother body-appearance,
[9045] <verse> Pure field from delusion-appearance ceasing.
[9046] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9047] <prose> At the time of all these, the formerly demonstrated measures and sign-manners all arise.
[9048] <prose> Wisdom-perfect appearance, space, and
[9049] <prose> Dharmatā pure appearance, awareness, and
[9050] <prose> Bindu-ripen appearance, from body reaching measure as mandala,
[9051] <prose> Again conducting dharmatā cease-appearance.
[9052] <prose> <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[9053] <verse> Wisdom-perfect appearance and || 30 ||
[9054] <verse> From dharmatā's first appearance,
[9055] <verse> From three appearances perfecting, become ceasing.
[9056] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9057] <verse> At this time, body-speech-mind measures.
[9058] <verse> When seeing individual appearances,
[9059] <verse> Signs complete by ripening in self,
[9060] <verse> Ceasing measures all manifestly appear.
[9061] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9062] <prose> Thus by taking experience, those with supreme effort: three years.
[9063] <prose> Middle ones: five years. || 40 ||
[9064] <prose> Last ones: seven years, eleven months,
[9065] <prose> Six days: seeing dharmatā cease-appearance, liberating into light-body.
[9066] <prose> <tantra> From that same source:
[9067] <verse> By great and small effort in this,
[9068] <verse> By days, months, and years,
[9069] <verse> Certainly accomplish at individual times.
[9070] <verse> From times without much moving,
[9071] <verse> Reach individual measures.
[9072] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9073] <prose> This is the great essential point of secret experience-taking. || 50 ||
[9074] <ornament> Third: determining the day-night wheel manner has four aspects:
[9075] <list> Gathering sense-faculties to the essential point of the continuum, closing memory's door.
[9076] <list> Putting knowable objects in the vase at dawn, wisdom clear directly.
[9077] <list> At morning, demonstrating clear wisdom, all arisen feelings pure in self-place.
[9078] <list> Striking with vast appearance by day,
[9079] <list> Suppressing all signs.
[9080] <prose> Though these were explained formerly,
[9081] <prose> Here also explained as thögal companion, summarizing: taking experience,
[9082] <prose> There is distinction slightly different from former.
[9083] <prose> Daytime, looking at the manifest by elephant-gaze, || 60 ||
[9084] <prose> Releasing to self-ceasing delusion-appearances, suppressing signs.
[9085] <prose> Nighttime, placing cognition on the bindu-empty lamp.
[9086] <prose> When that bindu expands, cognition also expands clear portion.
[9087] <prose> When decreasing, cognition goes increasingly subtle. In the state of going to referenceless end, equipoise without thought of emanating or gathering references.
[9088] <prose> As sleep approaches, placing mind in the state of dissolving empty bindu at the forehead center,
[9089] <prose> Seize the essence of sleep-luminosity.
[9090] <prose> At midnight, holding mind to the luminosity within the heart and sleeping,
[9091] <prose> Dreams liberate into luminosity, the continuum of habits ceasing.
[9092] <prose> Then at dawn, by lion's gaze casting consciousness to a white AH in the bow-span of sky,
[9093] <prose> The meaning free of clear-empty elaboration arises from within. || 70 ||
[9094] <prose> Meditate abiding in that state for as long as possible.
[9095] <prose> <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[9096] <verse> Pressing the bodily posture,
[9097] <verse> Cast consciousness to the range of sky.
[9098] <verse> Likewise, eyes to the space between,
[9099] <verse> By elephant gaze
[9100] <verse> Place in great spreading without memory.
[9101] <verse> Thus cast awareness to sky.
[9102] <verse> Without separating from this,
[9103] <verse> The yogin who meditates continuously || 80 ||
[9104] <verse> Expands appearances by day.
[9105] <verse> At nighttime, in one's own dwelling,
[9106] <verse> To hold the measure of four equal times,
[9107] <verse> Gathering sense doors oneself,
[9108] <verse> To the lamp of empty bindu,
[9109] <verse> The endowed yogin places mind.
[9110] <verse> When that bindu expands,
[9111] <verse> Place consciousness expanding as well.
[9112] <verse> When bindu becomes subtle,
[9113] <verse> Bindu increasingly subtle, || 90 ||
[9114] <verse> Place consciousness increasingly subtle.
[9115] <verse> By essential point of sleep and dream,
[9116] <verse> Extract root of former attachment habits.
[9117] <verse> Thus in all times of night,
[9118] <verse> The fortunate endowed yogin acts.
[9119] <break> <verse> By this, reach self-expansion of appearances.
[9120] <break> <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9121] <prose> Thus by taking experience in the day-night wheel continuum,
[9122] <prose> Delusory appearances self-cease, liberating into luminosity.
[9123] <prose> <tantra> From that same source: || 100 ||
[9124] <verse> By body, field, and awareness,
[9125] <verse> Hold all measures of pure self-appearance.
[9126] <verse> Having grasped the measure of self-appearance thus,
[9127] <verse> Appearances of six classes' delusion cease.
[9128] <verse> At the time of ceasing that,
[9129] <verse> Awareness reaches the measure.
[9130] <verse> When thus reaching the measure,
[9131] <verse> One's own body also does not appear.
[9132] <break> <verse> The flesh-blood body produced by elements
[9133] <break> <verse> Because elements are pure in their own place, || 110 ||
[9134] <verse> Because this appears as field,
[9135] <verse> The mind-body grasped by delusion
[9136] <verse> Because elements dissolve in their own place,
[9137] <verse> This also dissolves, not appearing in its own place.
[9138] <verse> The light-body grasped by awareness
[9139] <verse> Is like the water-moon mandala.
[9140] <verse> At this time, near dharmatā cessation,
[9141] <verse> Whoever becomes familiar with this, Buddha-field.
[9142] <break> <verse> Then, having exhausted the three bodies' limits,
[9143] <break> <verse> Obtain the action-free perfect body. || 120 ||
[9144] <verse> At this time, all limits of body
[9145] <verse> Are near to freedom.
[9146] <verse> The yogin familiar with the base
[9147] <verse> Also empties one's own place.
[9148] <verse> The yogin familiar with the path
[9149] <verse> Exhausts coarse elemental stains.
[9150] <verse> Whoever is familiar with the fruit
[9151] <verse> Reaches the non-return ground by this.
[9152] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9153] <prose> Moreover, the distinction between light-body and samādhi-body: the light-body, awareness's self-light without stain, is beyond the range of sentient beings' sight, visible only to Buddha-eye, || 130 ||
[9154] <prose> While the samādhi god-body should be understood as having the distinction of appearing to those with god-eye among sentient beings possessing very clear, pervasive particles of the four elements produced by ripening habit-continuum.
[9155] <break> <ornament> Third: extensively explaining the wisdom wheel of profound expanse has three aspects:
[9156] <break> <list> Briefly demonstrating the essence,
[9157] <list> Extensively explaining the nature,
[9158] <list> Summarizing the meaning by aspect.
[9159] <ornament> First:
[9160] <prose> <tantra> From the Lion Power-Perfect:
[9161] <verse> Also, what are the five intentions?
[9162] <verse> By intention of mountain's general meaning, transcend through view.
[9163] <verse> By intention of wisdom's general filling, grasp the ground. || 140 ||
[9164] <verse> By intention of bindu's range-penetration, examine the manner of appearance arising.
[9165] <verse> By intention of sun-moon equal gap, deliver to meaning's end.
[9166] <verse> By intention of ocean expanse-penetration, deliver awareness to space. Thus it is spoken.
[9167] <ornament> Second, from five:
