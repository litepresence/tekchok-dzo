[4283] <prose> First is explained: cutting through the basis,
[4284] <prose> Through the sequence of instant faculties,
[4285] <prose> Which are primordially liberated, again without basis, and so forth.
[4286] <prose> Second is explained: the path of leaping over, the gradual faculties, relying on the key of channels and winds, making liberation,
[4287] <prose> Through three preliminaries, bringing one to the natural place, directly bringing one to the self-key, until,
[4288] <prose> The body key,
[4289] <prose> The door key,
[4290] <prose> The object key,
[4291] <prose> Relying on the key of wind and awareness, taking experience,
[4292] <prose> Going to the measure of four appearances, showing liberation. || 10 ||
[4293] <prose> Also from that same <tantra>:
[4294] <prose> Those directly realizing,
[4295] <prose> Are called method—also distinction.
[4296] <prose> The person's intellect's difference,
[4297] <prose> Shows how the sequence must be explained,
[4298] <prose> Without effort and striving, self-liberation,
[4299] <prose> With effort, experience must be taken.
[4300] <prose> The effortless ones are self-pure.
[4301] <prose> The key operates through three aspects,
[4302] <prose> That meaning indicates taking experience, || 20 ||
[4303] <prose> Through body, door, and object.
[4304] <prose> The body's key includes these three,
[4305] <prose> The lion's manner, the elephant's manner,
[4306] <prose> Like a rishi, must be known.
[4307] <prose> The door remains that same, unmoved,
[4308] <prose> Clarifying two, unmoved,
[4309] <prose> The sky itself unmoved.
[4310] <prose> The object's key includes three aspects,
[4311] <prose> The pure expanse, dwelling,
[4312] <prose> Thus awareness's nature, dwelling, || 30 ||
[4313] <prose> All appearances, dwelling.
[4314] <prose> Mind remains changeless, self-abiding,
[4315] <prose> Mind remains changeless, memory clear,
[4316] <prose> Awareness unchanging, three bodies clear,
[4317] <prose> Mind, mind, slow—the memory stream ceases.
[4318] <break> <prose> Body and speech become slack, free from suffering.
[4319] <break> <prose> Awareness becomes slack, five bodies arise.
[4320] <prose> Awareness arisen, conditions cease.
[4321] <prose> Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease.
[4322] <tantra> Thus is indicated the method's Tantra. || 40 ||
[4323] <tantra> The self's Tantra, unproduced and perfected.
[4324] <prose> Indicating, thus the method is.
[4325] <tantra> Dwelling in the stream, thus called Tantra.
[4326] <prose> Thus.
[4327] <tantra> Second, the nature's Tantra:
[4328] <prose> The meaning of basis, path, and fruition.
[4329] <prose> From that same <tantra>:
[4330] <prose> Basis, path, fruition,
[4331] <tantra> Determined holding, nature's Tantra.
[4332] <prose> Thus. || 50 ||
[4333] <prose> This essence:
[4334] <prose> The empty-clear awareness's essence, basis, path, and fruition gathered.
[4335] <tantra> The definite term pervades all, accomplishing Buddha-nature, thus called nature's Tantra.
[4336] <prose> Divided into:
[4337] <prose> Basis,
[4338] <prose> Essence,
[4339] <tantra> Quintessence nature's Tantra—three.
[4340] <tantra> The basis nature's Tantra: the first ka-dag awareness, nature, compassion—three.
[4341] <prose> That too includes: essence primordially pure, non-awareness's name non-existent,
[4342] <prose> Delusion imputed only, not experienced, || 60 ||
[4343] <prose> Nature spontaneously accomplished, awareness light-clear,
[4344] <prose> Compassion all-pervading, manifesting, unceasing,
[4345] <prose> Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, whatever arises, dwelling in expanse.
[4346] <tantra> The essence nature's Tantra:
[4347] <tantra> Primordial wisdom three-stacked, in the heart-essence manner, arisen—the basis nature's Tantra, that power, basis appearance, eye, four lamps arisen,
[4348] <prose> The path's four appearances actually seen.
[4349] <tantra> The quintessence nature's Tantra:
[4350] <prose> Awareness's appearance, taking experience, fruition ripened.
[4351] <prose> That too includes: essence empty, marks awareness non-gone,
[4352] <prose> Permanent extreme-grasping non-existent, substantial entity non-established, || 70 ||
[4353] <prose> Empty self-appearance arisen, cut, cut-off non-existent,
[4354] <prose> Empty-clear, indivisible—that awareness's quintessence,
[4355] <prose> That too: measured, ripened, quintessence gathered, thus called.
[4356] <prose> V. CLEARING, STABILITY, APPEARANCE, AND EMPTYING
[4357] <prose> Clear three, and so forth: three kāyas, phenomena of path-appearance that have reached their end.
[4358] <prose> Knowledge, directionless: clear—so not emptiness cut off.
[4359] <prose> Entity, markless: clear—so not gradual.
[4360] <prose> Self-aware ultimate: those three are indivisible.
[4361] <prose> Permanent and cut, liberated from the four extremes: the mind of the indivisibility of body and primordial wisdom—thus called.
[4362] <prose> Now the three clear aspects: || 80 ||
[4363] <prose> When outer realms appear,
[4364] <prose> Awareness appears kāya-clear, dimension color-clear.
[4365] <prose> Sky, dimension-awareness, appear indivisible.
[4366] <prose> Now the three stabilities:
[4367] <prose> Thus arisen, faith: the stability of view.
[4368] <prose> Nose-held: the stability of realm.
[4369] <prose> Delusion ceased: the stability of decision.
[4370] <prose> Now the three non-returns:
[4371] <prose> When saṃsāra itself is known as primordially Buddha,
[4372] <prose> Awareness has no continuum—so no return. || 90 ||
[4373] <break> <prose> Awareness kāya appears manifestly; delusion-appearances fall into pure-appearances—so appearances do not return.
[4374] <prose> Dharmatā appears as manifold.
[4375] <break> <prose> That realization's confidence gained—so no return.
[4376] <prose> Now the three appearances:
[4377] <prose> Dimension: appearance without day or night.
[4378] <prose> Awareness: appearance without clear-dimming.
[4379] <prose> Dharmatā: appearance without transformation.
[4380] <prose> Thus liberated: delusion's appearances, self-pure, have no cause for saṃsāra.
[4381] <prose> That very purity of appearance, self-arisen, conditions of saṃsāra cease of themselves.
[4382] <prose> Even offering here, dharmatā's appearance in the intermediate state is decided—saṃsāra's result dissolves of itself. || 100 ||
[4383] <prose> Now the three emptinesses:
[4384] <prose> At that time:
[4385] <prose> Awareness without comparison—delusion emptied.
[4386] <prose> Mind without conditions—conceptual stains emptied.
[4387] <prose> Light without coming-and-going—elements' conditions emptied.
[4388] <tantra> Thus, basis, essence, flower-Tantra: shown individually even.
[4389] <prose> Only a matter of reversal distinction; one essential nature.
[4390] <tantra> How these three tantras proceed: As for what is shown as the basis-Tantra regarding reality's actual state: Buddha and all sentient beings arise from that—so the outer Tantra or the basis-Tantra is established.
[4391] <tantra> Realizing: entered the Buddha's Tantra.
[4392] <tantra> Not-realizing: entered the sentient beings' Tantra. Since that Tantra itself is made the basis, the basis-Tantra is established. || 110 ||
[4393] <tantra> The method-Tantra too is this portion.
[4394] <tantra> That meaning itself is the basis for indication, so what is indicated becomes the method-Tantra.
[4395] <prose> Without basis-awareness as support, there are no Buddhas or sentient beings whatsoever.
[4396] <tantra> Those two who hold their tantras—regarding the Tantra—
[4397] <prose> That itself understood through entering: meaning realized—that is its purpose.
[4398] <prose> Realized and liberated—that is its innermost result and fruit.
[4399] <prose> Such meaning: if the guru's instruction does not indicate it, it is not realized.
[4400] <tantra> If indicated, realizing the indicating method: that is called the method-indicating Tantra.
[4401] <prose> That method transmitted one-to-one: thus called method-indicating.
[4402] <prose> Through indication, rigpa must be seen—liberation itself must be gained. || 120 ||
[4403] <tantra> "Meaning unestablished anywhere, so no Tantra"—if one thinks this, it is not so.
[4404] <tantra> Since there is no awareness-continuum like that, meaning's Tantra is properly imputed.
[4405] <tantra> The essence-nature Tantra is awareness.
[4406] <tantra> Awareness's dharmatā seen directly: the continuum of one who has passed holds the Tantra.
[4407] <tantra> Without the guru's instruction, not seen—transmitted through saṃsāra, so it is Tantra.
[4408] <tantra> The flower-nature Tantra:
[4409] <tantra> Four lamps: whoever sees and realizes dharmatā directly, that is rigpa—so it is the flower-Tantra.
[4410] <tantra> Not seeing that, transmitted as the class of actions and kleśas—so also Tantra.
[4411] <tantra> The quintessence-nature Tantra:
[4412] <prose> That practiced: essence condensed into quintessence—thus called. || 130 ||
[4413] <tantra> Seeing wisdom's appearance: since not destroyed in the three realms, it is Tantra.
[4414] <tantra> That quintessence of indivisible space-awareness is also explained elsewhere among the seventeen great-secret definitive tantras.
[4415] <prose> From <tantra>the Continuation of the Buddha Tantras:
[4416] <prose> The Buddha's all essence gathered,
[4417] <prose> Placed into all beings' hearts.
[4418] <break> <prose> That essence: the intestine-continuum.
[4419] <break> <prose> Since clarity not gathered, called "essence."
[4420] <prose> Thus,
[4421] <prose> From <tantra>the Diligent Meaning-Possessing Tantra:
[4422] <prose> All teachings' supreme essence: || 140 ||
[4423] <prose> Dharmatā direct-path called.
[4424] <prose> Thus,
[4425] <prose> From <tantra>the Vajra-Sky-Equality Tantra:
[4426] <prose> Basis, essence, flower:
[4427] <tantra> All Buddhas' nature-Tantra.
[4428] <prose> Supreme secret distinguished, essence gathered.
[4429] <prose> This to saṃsāra's far shore,
[4430] <prose> Like an arrow-shot person.
[4431] <prose> Thus,
[4432] <prose> From <tantra>the Supreme Golden Light: || 150 ||
[4433] <prose> Basis, nature, methods:
[4434] <prose> Relying, even to the Buddha-field,
[4435] <tantra> Effortless, easy—so placed as Tantra.
[4436] <break> <prose> Thus.
[4437] <break> <prose> The Determination of These Meanings
[4438] <prose> From <tantra>the Pearl Garland:
[4439] <tantra> Nature-Tantra is this:
[4440] <prose> Basis, essence, quintessence itself.
[4441] <prose> Basis: essence, nature,
[4442] <prose> Compassion pervading all, arisen, || 160 ||
[4443] <prose> Possessing self-nature of three primordial wisdoms,
[4444] <prose> Primordially pure from stains,
[4445] <break> <prose> The unique one of indivisibility.
[4446] <break> <prose> All Buddhas' great secret.
[4447] <prose> Kāya: perfected essence-awareness.
[4448] <break> <tantra> Kāya's Tantra: pervading emptiness.
[4449] <break> <prose> Clarity itself is self-appearance.
[4450] <prose> Non-appearance possessing clarity's nature.
[4451] <tantra> Perfect essence's nature-Tantra.
[4452] <tantra> All appearances are Tantra, || 170 ||
[4453] <prose> All interconnected and clinging.
[4454] <prose> In the mandala of natural citta,
[4455] <prose> Unproduced, perfected—great essence.
[4456] <prose> Thus, gathered: essence,
[4457] <prose> Since become life's breath of all.
[4458] <tantra> Explained as essence-Tantra.
[4459] <prose> From <tantra>the Tantra of All Buddhas' Blissful Secret:
[4460] <prose> All Buddhas gathered into one,
[4461] <prose> All essences extracted,
[4462] <prose> Essence gathered—thus called essence, || 180 ||
[4463] <prose> Gathered into empty-clear awareness's essence.
[4464] <prose> All Buddhas' great blissful secret,
[4465] <prose> Possessing basis, essence, flower,
[4466] <prose> The very essence of all self-awareness.
[4467] <prose> Called the Great Perfection's essence,
[4468] <tantra> Renowned among other tantras.
[4469] <tantra> The secret Tantra explained:
[4470] <prose> Scripture held by definite ones.
[4471] <prose> Nature empty, all-pervading.
[4472] <prose> That too: essence's nature. || 190 ||
[4473] <prose> Essence gathered, three clarities,
[4474] <prose> Three clarities, pervading cognition.
[4475] <prose> Three confidences, three non-returns—
[4476] <prose> Obtain definiteness of unchanging essence.
[4477] <prose> Three appearances, three emptinesses:
[4478] <prose> Essence: pure nature.
[4479] <tantra> Established as Tantra.
[4480] <prose> Basis, path, result—
[4481] <tantra> Held definitively: nature-Tantra.
[4482] <tantra> Thus explained, Tantra established. || 200 ||
[4483] <prose> Established through natural descent.
[4484] <tantra> Thus called nature-itself Tantra.
[4485] <tantra> Thus, From the single nature of basis-awareness, Come two tantras: the indicated and the indicating method.
[4486] <tantra> THE SEVENTEEN TANTRAS
[4487] <tantra> From nature: basis and essence.
[4488] <prose> Three quintessences, though designated with five different names,
[4489] <prose> Are not beyond one meaning-essence.
[4490] <tantra> From that itself:
[4491] <tantra> From the distinction of the single basis's essence,
[4492] <tantra> Are called method and nature Tantra. || 210 ||
[4493] <prose> Though they appear merely as designations,
[4494] <prose> The essence: single basis, empty nature,
[4495] <prose> Are not different, have no variation.
[4496] <prose> For example, a person—
[4497] <prose> If many names exist,
[4498] <prose> However called, appears so,
[4499] <prose> Meaning unchanged, likewise.
[4500] <prose> Thus,
[4501] <ornament> SECOND: THE WORD TANTRAS, EXPLAINED EXTENSIVELY
[4502] <prose> Three: Enumeration, Purpose, Order. || 220 ||
