[4696] <ornament> First:
[4697] <prose> Wisdom does not dawn with ordinary gaze manner; train in three bodies' gaze manners.
[4698] <tantra>From the Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra:
[4699] <verse> By dharmakāya gaze manner,
[4700] <verse> Press and extract three-realms' saṃsāra;
[4701] <verse> Saṃbhogakāya does not destroy saṃsāra's ground;
[4702] <break> <verse> Nirmāṇakāya liberates into buddha-field.
[4703] <break> <tantra>Thus said, and:
[4704] <tantra>From the Letterless:
[4705] <verse> Gaze eye at sky element. || 10 ||
[4706] <break> <tantra>Thus said, and:
[4707] <break> <tantra>From the Secret Sound Tantra:
[4708] <verse> Lower, reverse, corner—three;
[4709] <verse> Gaze manner types three, famous.
[4710] <tantra>Thus it was said.
[4711] <prose> That also: Nirmāṇakāya, lower, Buddha, looking at disciples;
[4712] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya, corner look, Buddha, looking at field-realm;
[4713] <prose> Dharmakāya, reverse, Buddha, looking at base.
[4714] <prose> Yogin with bad eye faculty:
[4715] <prose> Harmonizing with Nirmāṇakāya gaze manner, eye not dim purpose exists. || 20 ||
[4716] <prose> Eye possessing fault:
[4717] <prose> Harmonizing with Saṃbhogakāya, eye clear purpose exists.
[4718] <prose> Eye faculty good:
[4719] <prose> Harmonizing with Dharmakāya mode, swift vision arrives at measure purpose exists. Not moving from those, determined to realize within three-eyes. Dharmakāya: dharmatā eye existing in speech.
[4720] <prose> By that blessing, wisdom actually seeing—
[4721] <prose> This same, certain.
[4722] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya: wisdom eye existing in body;
[4723] <prose> By that blessing, seeing self-clear, knowledge expands.
[4724] <prose> Nirmāṇakāya: discriminating-awareness eye existing in heart;
[4725] <prose> By that blessing, seeing separate from sound word, || 30 ||
[4726] <prose> Hearing, contemplation, meditation—all dharmatā's meaning dawns within.
[4727] <prose> That also: three-eyes gaze,
[4728] <prose> Dharmatā eye reversing up, removing latency down—main-point.
[4729] <prose> Equal gaze at wisdom's corner,
[4730] <prose> Equal mixing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa taste—main-point.
[4731] <prose> Look with discriminating-awareness lowered,
[4732] <prose> Actually deliver wisdom vision—main-point.
[4733] <prose> What is three gaze manners' determination?
[4734] <prose> Lazy one: Saṃbhogakāya;
[4735] <prose> Diligent one: Nirmāṇakāya; || 40 ||
[4736] <prose> Equanimity one: Dharmakāya gaze manner—auspicious;
[4737] <prose> Therefore three determined.
[4738] <ornament> Definitive meaning: gaze at dharmatā,
[4739] <prose> Gaze pure, obscuration exhausted;
[4740] <prose> Mode: liberating from saṃsāra.
[4741] <ornament> Second, field's main-point:
[4742] <prose> Outer dhātu's field: empty sky, separate from clouds.
[4743] <prose> Inner dhātu's field: gaze at eyebrow-center treasure-spot,
[4744] <prose> Dhātu-vision blue, and from that arise five self-resonances.
[4745] <tantra>From Thalgyur: || 50 ||
[4746] <verse> Dhātu: outer and inner;
