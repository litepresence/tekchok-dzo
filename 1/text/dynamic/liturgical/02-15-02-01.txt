[474] <tantra> From each of the five winds also abiding as five:
[475] <prose> First, the five life-holding winds from the Self-Arisen:
[476] <prose> In life-holding wind also five:
[477] <prose> Root-holding life and
[478] <prose> Protecting life and
[479] <prose> Spreading life and
[480] <prose> Impure life and
[481] <prose> Shattering life—five. Thus.
[482] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[483] <prose> Awareness-potential producing and || 10 ||
[484] <prose> Bindhu-potential producing and
[485] <prose> Light-potential producing and
[486] <prose> Non-awareness root holding and
[487] <prose> Existing in life-channel in mind-helper making manner.
[488] <prose> Life-wind potential relies upon and abides in awareness-potential.
[489] <prose> Second, the five fire-equal winds:
[490] <prose> Again from that:
[491] <prose> In fire-abiding wind also five:
[492] <prose> Clear-impure separating wind and
[493] <prose> Warmth-producing wind and || 20 ||
[494] <prose> Clear-change wind and
[495] <prose> Distinctions-gathering wind and
[496] <prose> Praise-making wind—five. Thus.
[497] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[498] <prose> Nondual with awareness,
[499] <prose> Nondual with lamp,
[500] <prose> Nondual with bindhu,
[501] <prose> Abide nondual with wisdom.
[502] <prose> Third, the five color-radiance producing winds—also from That Source:
[503] <prose> In color-radiance producing wind also five: consciousness-producing wind and || 30 ||
[504] <prose> Mind-arising wind and
[505] <prose> Radiance-possessing wind and
[506] <prose> Burning wind and
[507] <prose> Wildness wind—five. Thus.
[508] <prose> Those also according to sequence: wisdom-object,
[509] <prose> Appearing-object,
[510] <prose> Lamp-object,
[511] <prose> Non-awareness object,
[512] <prose> Mind-object horse making.
[513] <prose> Fourth, the five all-pervading winds: || 40 ||
[514] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[515] <prose> In all-pervading wind also five:
[516] <prose> Base-pervading and
[517] <prose> Immediate-pervading and
[518] <prose> Hatred-fear pervading and
[519] <prose> Memory-pervading and
[520] <prose> All body-pervading by holding—five. Thus.
[521] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[522] <prose> Wisdom-appearing,
[523] <prose> Lamp-appearing, || 50 ||
[524] <prose> Knowing-appearing,
[525] <prose> Thinking-appearing,
[526] <prose> Mind-appearing potency making.
[527] <prose> Fifth, the five compassionless karma winds:
[528] <prose> Again from That Source:
[529] <prose> In compassionless aeon-karma wind also five:
[530] <prose> Movement-making wind and
[531] <prose> Liberation-making wind and
[532] <prose> Reversal-making wind and
[533] <prose> Swiftness-making wind and || 60 ||
[534] <prose> Moments wind—five. Thus.
[535] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[536] <prose> Aggregates-pervading,
[537] <prose> Moments-pervading,
[538] <prose> Bardo-pervading,
[539] <prose> Concepts-pervading,
[540] <prose> Three-pervading—moments, actions, completion.
[541] <prose> Thus, twenty-five also gather into five roots.
[542] <prose> These terms' explanation:
[543] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen: || 70 ||
[544] <prose> Because of true-ground movement-making,
[545] <prose> Move-making wind it is called.
[546] <prose> Because of pure wisdom's life-holding,
[547] <prose> Life-holding wind it is called.
[548] <prose> Because of five wisdom-lights' self-nature existing,
[549] <prose> Color-radiance producing wind it is called.
[550] <prose> Because of wisdom's true expanse liberation ability,
[551] <break> <prose> Compassionless aeon-karma wind it is called.
[552] <break> <prose> Because of wisdom-appearing's non-gathering non-separating abiding,
[553] <prose> Fire-equal wind it is called. Thus. || 80 ||
[554] <prose> Thus, in the five essence winds, relying on awareness-wisdom, now abiding in heart,
[555] <prose> That is wisdom's self-sound-potential clearing as five lights' essential point.
[556] <prose> When awareness separates from wind, wisdom-expanse gathering,
[557] <prose> Outer-inner's non-manifest also arrives at pure wind-mind's essential point.
[558] <prose> The two-knowing:
[559] <prose> Depending on dharmatā's inner-clear essence, all-knowing;
[560] <prose> Depending on dharmapossessor's outer-clear aspect, all-aspect-knowing appearing as wisdom.
[561] <prose> Five winds: from root life-wind's portion, compassion, awareness-wisdom—if pure, Buddha-wisdom;
[562] <prose> If impure, become beings' realization-aggregate arising-base.
[563] <prose> Four branch winds emanating from that, from compassion-potency, like sun's rays: || 90 ||
[564] <prose> Upward-going wisdom-horse and
[565] <prose> Downward-clearing wisdom-ray, potential-light, and
[566] <prose> Fire-equal ripening-possessing power, and
[567] <prose> Completing-pervasion possessing power—four.
[568] <prose> Although these also exist only in life-wind's portion,
[569] <prose> In expanse, not emanated;
[570] <prose> Abiding only as emanation's non-ceasing base's essence.
[571] <prose> Essence-branch clear as light.
[572] <prose> Thus stated, also from the Kun gsal:
[573] <prose> That kaya's abiding manner: || 100 ||
[574] <prose> Like empty-luminous bubble's form-reflection.
[575] <prose> That speech's abiding nature:
[576] <prose> Like fire-sparks' rays, four branch winds
[577] <prose> Clear in awareness-expanse.
[578] <prose> That mind's clear nature:
[579] <prose> Life-wind's self-essence,
[580] <prose> Like wisdom fire-sparks without falling-direction,
[581] <prose> Abide as essence-of-essence's five wisdoms.
[582] <prose> Thus.
[583] <prose> That also is wisdom not deceived by any concept. || 110 ||
[584] <prose> Altering and transforming—
[585] <prose> Not able to be grasped by face or designated by mark,
[586] <prose> Like earth and sky,
[587] <prose> Clear and subtle, like sparks of fire behind the five lights,
[588] <prose> The expanse's heart essence, Dharmakāya,
[589] <prose> Abiding as awareness itself, holding all's basis.
[590] <prose> Its abiding palace is
[591] <tantra> From that very source:
[592] <prose> Dharmadhatu, empty and all-pervading like space—
[593] <prose> Thus it is said. || 120 ||
[594] <prose> When that Dharmakāya abides within the precious interior,
[595] <prose> It is called dharmatā's pure original tone,
[596] <prose> The house possessing awareness-light,
[597] <prose> Abiding in light's display.
[598] <prose> This is called the primordial common basis, awareness-expanse,
[599] <prose> The meaning of establishing connection with the five winds.
[600] <prose> Second, the five fires' extensive explanation, from Self-Arisen:
[601] <prose> There are five fires:
[602] <prose> Outer-inner all-pervading fire,
[603] <prose> Outer-inner all-illuminating fire, || 130 ||
[604] <prose> Outer-inner all-equalizing fire,
[605] <prose> Outer-inner action's concept fire,
[606] <prose> Outer-inner action's accomplishing fire—thus five.
[607] <prose> These also, in sequence,
[608] <prose> Reside in lungs,
[609] <prose> Eyes and five limbs, making six,
[610] <prose> Flesh gaps,
[611] <prose> Two soles of feet,
[612] <prose> And two palms of hands, producing warmth.
[613] <prose> Third, the five earths as well: || 140 ||
[614] <tantra> From that same source:
[615] <prose> There are five earths:
[616] <prose> All-illuminating earth,
[617] <prose> Unchanging vajra earth,
[618] <prose> Precious earth from which all arise,
[619] <prose> All-pervading earth showing appearances,
[620] <prose> Perfected accomplishment earth—thus five.
[621] <prose> These also, in sequence,
[622] <break> <prose> Together with awareness,
[623] <prose> Together with lamp, || 150 ||
[624] <prose> Together with thigle,
[625] <prose> Together with wisdom,
[626] <break> <prose> Together with discriminating awareness, they abide in reliance.
[627] <prose> Fourth, the five waters also from Self-Arisen:
[628] <prose> The five water kinds are:
[629] <prose> Unchanging water,
[630] <prose> Peaceful, clear, pure water,
[631] <prose> Extensively arising qualities' water,
[632] <prose> Attachment-free water,
[633] <prose> Completion-without-grasping water—thus five. || 160 ||
[634] <prose> These also, according to sequence,
[635] <prose> Together with all channels—
[636] <prose> Together with all bones,
[637] <prose> Together with all blood,
[638] <prose> Together with all lymph,
[639] <prose> Abiding within two eyes, moistening without essence-holding.
[640] <prose> Fifth, the five spaces:
[641] <prose> Again, from Self-Arisen it is taught:
[642] <prose> The five spaces are:
[643] <prose> All-common-pervading space, || 170 ||
[644] <prose> Object-free clear-tone space,
[645] <prose> Pure unmixed space,
[646] <prose> Meaning-indicating space,
[647] <prose> Pure-field liberating space—thus.
[648] <prose> These also, in sequence,
[649] <prose> Together with actual awareness,
[650] <prose> Together with five lights,
[651] <prose> Together with pure-expanse lamp,
[652] <prose> Together with signs' wisdom,
[653] <prose> Together with twenty-one pointing-out instructions, example-meaning certain confidence. || 180 ||
[654] <prose> Thus, five elements' awareness summarized attributes are the great elements,
[655] <prose> While their basis is the small elements.
[656] <tantra> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[657] <prose> The fifteenth division: Showing the Elements' Place.
[658] <prose> Thus, having established elements' nature as basis,
[659] <prose> Now, the supported's fourfold purity: expanse and wisdom:
[660] <prose> Basis: kayas,
[661] <prose> Tone: light,
[662] <prose> Supported: wisdom,
[663] <prose> Activities: enlightened actions. || 190 ||
[664] <prose> First, basis-kayas' extensive division has two parts:
[665] <prose> Three kayas' expanse general presentation, and
[666] <prose> Five kayas' enumeration particular explanation.
[667] <prose> The first has: kayas' definition brief presentation, and
[668] <prose> Place extensive explanation.
