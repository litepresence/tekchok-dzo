[1582] <prose> The essential nature of basis and aggregates, wherein all conditioned phenomena are gathered and arranged as the support for cyclic existence and liberation alike.
[1583] <prose> The distinctive characteristics of the forms and sense-sources, which serve as the gateways through which consciousness engages with its objects.
[1584] <prose> The essential nature of the powers that grasp and apprehend, being the active forces that dominate their respective spheres of engagement.
[1585] <prose> The various forms of objects and their possessors, comprising the entire field of what is grasped and that which grasps.
[1586] <ornament> First, regarding the elements: Due to their vast and extensive meaning, embracing all that can be known and experienced, these are termed "elements."
[1587] <prose> If one divides them for the purpose of clear understanding:
[1588] <prose> There are those gathered and comprehended through engagement with outer objects, and
[1589] <prose> Those gathered and comprehended through the activity of inner mind—these two categories encompass all.
[1590] <ornament> First, regarding those gathered by outer objects:
[1591] <prose> There are five great elements that serve as the foundation of all form-possessing existence. || 10 ||
[1592] <prose> Furthermore, they produce the vessels and essences of the world and abide as the support for all that possesses form.
[1593] <prose> They serve as the cause, condition, basis, and fundamental nature for both arising and destruction.
[1594] <prose> Earth abides with characteristics that are firm and solid, providing the foundation upon which all rests.
[1595] <prose> Water abides with characteristics that are moist and flowing, cohering and holding all things together.
[1596] <prose> Fire abides with characteristics that are hot and burning, ripening and transforming all that it touches.
[1597] <prose> Wind abides with characteristics that move and uplift, animating and sustaining all activity.
[1598] <prose> Space abides with characteristics that are vast and open, accommodating all without obstruction.
[1599] <prose> Through the harmonious interaction of these five, vessels and essences are produced and maintained throughout the three realms.
[1600] <tantra> From that very nature, the five elements gathered by outer objects manifest their functions thus:
[1601] <prose> The earth element produces and supports the basis of the body, giving it form and stability. || 20 ||
[1602] <prose> The water element holds and maintains names and designations, allowing cognition to occur.
[1603] <prose> The fire element ripens and matures objects, bringing them to completion.
[1604] <prose> The wind element sustains and animates the entire moving world, providing the vitality of breath and motion.
[1605] <prose> The space element holds and accommodates the powers and faculties, giving them room to function.
[1606] <prose> Thus it is taught by the Victorious Ones.
[1607] <prose> Wherein, <tantra> The elements gathered by inner mind appear as vessel and essence, two aspects of a single nature:
[1608] <tantra> The vessel appears as objects, accumulated and projected through the power of past actions.
[1609] <tantra> If one divides these for the sake of clear exposition:
[1610] <tantra> There are those arising from the delusion of mind that appears as outer objects, and
[1611] <tantra> Those arising naturally from the luminous clarity of inner mind itself—these two. || 30 ||
[1612] <prose> Moreover, <tantra> First: The latency of object-appearing mind manifests like a dream, without substantial nature yet clearly appearing.
[1613] <tantra> If one analyzes this dream-like display:
[1614] <tantra> There are the four desire-realm continents and their accompanying realms, appearing as solid yet empty.
[1615] <tantra> The five form-objects of the form realm—lights, self-arisen, appearing like rainbows in the sky.
[1616] <tantra> The formless objects: concentrations and absorptions, self-emanated yet invisible to others' perception.
[1617] <tantra> Thus it is spoken in the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra, the great seal of definitive meaning.
[1618] <prose> The elements gathered by inner mind are of two types:
[1619] <prose> The element of vessel that gathers and holds beings within the round of existence, and
[1620] <prose> The element that arises directly from mind itself, being the projection of awareness.
[1621] <ornament> Regarding the element of vessel: || 40 ||
[1622] <prose> The form element arises from the vast basis of beings' mindfulness, accumulated through countless actions.
[1623] <prose> The formless element arises from excessive mindfulness that transcends form yet still grasps.
[1624] <prose> The desire element arises from limited mindfulness that fixates upon particular objects. Thus it is taught.
[1625] <ornament> Second: Regarding that which arises naturally from the luminosity of the inner mind:
[1626] <prose> Awareness exists as the ground, and through its self-arisen potency comes the obscuration of the all-ground consciousness.
[1627] <prose>Furthermore, <tantra> From that all-ground, arising as the basis-consciousness, comes the active mind that engages with objects.
[1628] <tantra> From that mind, the five gates of perception and their faculties arise as knowing awareness.
[1629] <prose> Like a wish-fulfilling tree grown from a golden ground, with branches, flowers, and leaves spontaneously appearing.
[1630] <prose> Dividing this self-arisen display for the purpose of understanding:
[1631] <prose> There are objects that appear as what is known, || 50 ||
[1632] <prose> The faculties of cognition that apprehend them,
[1633] <prose> And feelings that arise from contact—these three encompass all.
[1634] <break> <prose> Objects are designated as the six bases of faculties when the mere knowing of the six consciousnesses, arising in this moment, is taken as the object of cognition.
[1635] <break> <prose> Thus the six bases of faculties are named according to their support.
[1636] <break> <prose> The faculties of cognition are the six present knowings of eye and ear and so forth.
[1637] <break> <prose> Feelings are the six types of future aspects, ripening from past contacts.
[1638] <break> <prose> Whatever object consciousness enters and engages with,
[1639] <break> <prose> The previous six knowings that maintain the continuum of experience are called "objects."
[1640] <prose> The knowing that grasps the nature of that in a single moment of clear apprehension is called "present knowing."
[1641] <prose> After that, feelings that gather as pleasure, pain, or neutrality are called "feelings of contact." || 60 ||
[1642] <prose> Wherein, these arise from the gathering of object and knowing, which constitutes the essential nature of feeling.
[1643] <prose> Thus, dividing the six groups into three types results in eighteen distinct categories of experience.
[1644] <tantra> From that very nature, the elements arising from mind itself are established as:
[1645] <prose> The eye element arising from the clear aspect of knowing, like a mirror reflecting form.
[1646] <prose> The ear element arising from single-pointed knowing that gathers sounds.
[1647] <prose> The nose element arising from limitless knowing that pervades all scents.
[1648] <prose> The tongue element arising from knowing gathered as one taste.
[1649] <prose> The mind element arising from knowing that enters all objects without obstruction.
[1650] <prose> The body element arising from knowing that serves as the basis for all the others.
[1651] <ornament> || 70 ||
[1652] <ornament> 
[1653] <prose> Through holding name and form, the element of eye consciousness comes to be.
[1654] <prose> Through holding accomplished actions, the element of ear consciousness manifests.
[1655] <prose> Through holding others in succession, the element of nose consciousness arises.
[1656] <prose> Through actual experience of objects, the element of tongue consciousness is established.
[1657] <prose> Through pervading all objects and even the objectless, the element of mind consciousness functions.
[1658] <prose> Through gathering all meanings comprehensively, the element of body consciousness operates.
[1659] <prose> Through grasping objects incorrectly and accomplishing apparent objects, the eye gathers and there is the element of contact.
[1660] <prose> Through the ear holding sounds and dispersing attention, there is the ear's gathering and the element of contact.
[1661] <prose> Through superior knowings gathering as one and attracting other minds, there is the nose's gathering and the element of contact. || 80 ||
[1662] <prose> Furthermore, through following and taking nearby objects as they appear, there is the tongue's gathering and the element of contact.
[1663] <prose> Through gathering all mindfulness and entering all objects, there is the mind's gathering and the element of contact.
[1664] <prose> Through holding coarse multiplicity and arising as embodied experience, there is the body's gathering and the element of contact.
[1665] <prose> Therefore, these elements also accomplish the holding and apprehension of objects through their distinct functions.
[1666] <prose> These arise from the part that holds within delusion itself, being the play of unawareness. Thus it is taught.
[1667] <ornament> Therefore, second: The aggregates arise from the essential nature of basis and aggregates, gathered and assembled as one heap of experience.
[1668] <prose> This collection is called "aggregate" because it accumulates and amasses the aspects of existence.
[1669] <prose> If one divides them according to their nature:
[1670] <prose> There are the aggregates with thought, wherein conceptual cognition operates, and those without thought—these two.
