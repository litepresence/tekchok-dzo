[16436] <ornament> The First:
[16437] <prose> In Dharmatā, from the perspective of that upon which one looks, since the essence of any is not established, it is free from the extremes of elaboration;
[16438] <prose> Since it transcends the grasping of entity identity, it is without arising, ceasing, transference, or transformation;
[16439] <break> <prose> Since the ultimate is directly manifest, Dharmatā is inconceivable.
[16440] <break> <ornament> The Second:
[16441] <prose> Hence, the Dharmakāya pervading all of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, possessing twofold purity—pure through the purification of adventitious stains—is That.
[16442] <prose> <tantra> From Hevajra:
[16443] <prose> <tantra> "Sentient beings are truly Buddhas,
[16444] <prose> <tantra> Yet obscured by adventitious stains.
[16445] <prose> <tantra> When these are cleared away, they are truly Buddhas." || 10 ||
[16446] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16447] <prose><tantra> From Uttaratantra:
[16448] <verse> "The Perfect Buddha's Body is emanating,
[16449] <verse> Suchness is without distinction,
[16450] <verse> Because of possessing the Lineage, all sentient beings
[16451] <verse> Always possess the Essence of Buddhahood."
[16452] <verse> Thus the portion of direct manifestation is spoken.
[16453] <ornament> The Third:
[16454] <prose> Each vehicle demonstrates Rigpa,
[16455] <prose> Emptiness, || 20 ||
[16456] <prose> And qualities and so forth.
[16457] <prose> Here in the Great Perfection, if divided through miraculous display:
[16458] <prose> Dharmakāya's Dharmakāya fields—inconceivable;
[16459] <prose> Abode—Dharmatā transcending the mind's grasping;
[16460] <prose> Samādhi—great Immovable;
[16461] <prose> Retinue—various self-nature, non-dual;
[16462] <prose> Teaching—indescribable Dharmatā;
[16463] <prose> Time—Dharmatā without transformation at any time.
[16464] <prose> Dharmakāya's Saṃbhogakāya fields—free from dust, without stain;
[16465] <prose> Abode—memory, mind's thought self-dissolved; || 30 ||
[16466] <prose> Samādhi—cessation of mind and mental factors' arisings, wisdom self-abiding;
[16467] <prose> Retinue—empty, self-appearance's agent;
[16468] <prose> Teaching—pure, complete perception;
[16469] <prose> Time—without investigation, great primordial equality.
[16470] <prose> Dharmakāya's Nirmāṇakāya:
[16471] <prose> Fields—emptiness, unbroken space;
[16472] <prose> Abode—arising-basis of all, great self-clarity of depth;
[16473] <prose> Samādhi—unceasing, self-clear;
[16474] <prose> Retinue—pure appearance without class-distinction;
[16475] <prose> Teaching—unfabricated self-nature; || 40 ||
[16476] <prose> Time—essence directly manifest.
[16477] <prose> These too are designated from Dharmakāya's aspect of primordial purity self-abiding.
[16478] <prose> <tantra> From Ratnaketu:
[16479] <break> <prose> <tantra> "Through self-pure Dharmakāya,
[16480] <break> <prose> <tantra> Self-pure without elaboration, in celestial palace,
[16481] <prose> <tantra> In appearance-retinue nondual with oneself,
[16482] <prose> <tantra> Through markless Speech,
[16483] <prose> <tantra> Elaboration-free words
[16484] <prose> <tantra> Are emitted from nonabiding self-dissolved Mind.
[16485] <prose> <tantra> Without speaking, without having spoken, || 50 ||
[16486] <prose> <tantra> Shown in the state of Great Equality."
[16487] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is.
[16488] <prose> These too are merely designated as aspects;
[16489] <prose> In meaning, since established nowhere, they abide in Great Perfection free from extremes.
[16490] <prose> <tantra> From that very text:
[16491] <prose> <tantra> "This abode of 'this,'
[16492] <prose> <tantra> The named designated field with its marks,
[16493] <prose> <tantra> Whatever form appears nowhere,
[16494] <prose> <tantra> Nonexistent emptiness from Dharmodaya,
[16495] <prose> <tantra> In the great secret Expanse, || 60 ||
[16496] <prose> <tantra> Abiding from the primordial beginning,
[16497] <prose> <tantra> Ungrasped, in the manner of abiding,
[16498] <prose> <tantra> Great Play arose primordially.
[16499] <prose> <tantra> Here none abide.
[16500] <prose> <tantra> None make an abode.
[16501] <prose> <tantra> Here there is no perfection.
[16502] <prose> <tantra> Devoid of dwelling and coming.
[16503] <prose> <tantra> Thus, the place of great primordial emptiness,
[16504] <prose> <tantra> From nonexistence, the Expanse's field,
[16505] <prose> <tantra> Here there is neither outer nor inner. || 70 ||
[16506] <prose> <tantra> Above and below, no looking.
[16507] <prose> <tantra> In directions and intermediate points, none ever
[16508] <prose> <tantra> Has anything to grasp here."
[16509] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is.
[16510] <ornament> The Fourth: Extensive explanation of enumerations:
[16511] <prose><tantra> From Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities, and Activities—five:
[16512] <prose> Dharmakāya's Body—empty-clarity, markless;
[16513] <prose> Speech—indescribable, transcending words and speech;
[16514] <prose> Mind—without memory, thought, or elaboration;
[16515] <prose> Qualities—never regressing, without transformation; || 80 ||
[16516] <prose> Activities—spontaneous presence, abiding as basis of unceasing manifestation-manner.
[16517] <prose> <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[16518] <prose> <tantra> "Dharmakāya: Body and Speech,
[16519] <prose> <tantra> Mind and Qualities and Activities.
[16520] <prose> <tantra> Body: emptiness and clarity,

[16532] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is.
[16533] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya extensively explained also comprises
[16534] <prose> Essence,
[16535] <break> <prose> Definitive terminology, || 100 ||

[16540] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya's definitive terminology: engaging in appearance as Saṃbhogakāya, in that itself wisdom unceasingly engaging.
[16541] <prose> Kāya: great self-clear display-arrangement.
[16542] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya's divisions are four:
[16543] <list> Great element Essence-Kāya;

[16545] <list> Appearance path Kāya; || 110 ||
[16546] <list> Those to be trained's appearance manner Kāya.
[16547] <ornament> The first:

[16549] <prose> Appearance-basis great elements' nature: clear warmth,
[16550] <prose> Coolness,
[16551] <prose> Spaciousness,
[16552] <prose> Possessing all-pervading identity.
[16553] <ornament> The second:
[16554] <prose> For all Buddhas and sentient beings, the aspect of pervasion by light and light-mansion directly manifest.
[16555] <prose> <tantra> From Self-Arisen: || 120 ||
[16556] <prose> <tantra> "Abiding as light's heart-essence for all,
[16557] <prose> <tantra> Thought-free completely pure Dharmadhātu,
[16558] <break> <prose> <tantra> The single without rival,
[16559] <break> <prose> <tantra> Maṇḍala, retinue, palace,

[16561] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16562] <ornament> The third:
[16563] <prose> The Saṃbhogakāya of appearance-basis Dharmatā, appearing to sentient beings in the bardo as path, here guiding those to be trained—self-arisen from Dharmakāya's inner Expanse,

[16576] <prose> <tantra> Nature-Kāya manifests;

[16580] <prose> <tantra> Not severed: luminosity-Kāya,
[16581] <prose> <tantra> Without distinction, without outer-inner."
[16582] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16583] <ornament> The fourth:

[16588] <prose> Internally viewed, externally clear;
[16589] <prose> Through thorough openness, without front or back;
[16590] <prose><tantra> From wherever viewed, like showing face—appearance: face in ten directions, completely open.
[16591] <prose> That field: completely adorned ornament-arrangement,

[16593] <prose> Field: completely pure dense array,
[16594] <prose> Retinue: not other than oneself,
[16595] <prose> Teaching: self-arisen wisdom self-appearing, || 160 ||
[16596] <prose> Time: realization directly manifest.
[16597] <ornament> This, regarding self-appearance primordially as emanation,
[16598] <ornament> Regarding those to be trained's luminosity, is posited as Saṃbhogakāya through perfection of marks and signs.
[16599] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya's Saṃbhogakāya: appearing as five families' principal five.
[16600] <prose> That defining characteristic: essence different, nature single.
[16601] <prose> Fields: individual families' maṇḍalas, immeasurable;

[16613] <prose> Yet not yakṣa-realm Trāyastriṃśa,

[16629] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16630] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya means:
[16631] <prose> Through essence, not demonstrating Dharmas as word—thus "unspoken."
[16632] <prose> The six syllables' self-sound heard by those to be trained:
[16633] <prose> Like dream-words, appearing as spoken.
[16634] <prose> <tantra> From Six Expanses:
[16635] <prose> <tantra> "Without speaking from one's own mouth, || 200 ||

[16681] <prose> Definitive terminology:

[16683] <prose> That very form complete with excellent marks, therefore "Kāya."
[16684] <prose> Divisions: common and uncommon approaches—two:
