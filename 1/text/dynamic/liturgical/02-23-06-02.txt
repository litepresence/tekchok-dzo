[14200] <prose> Second and Third have twenty-four each.
[14201] <prose> The remaining three have six each, thus divided into portions making one hundred thirty-four.
[14202] <prose> Those also gathered into six groups of six.
[14203] <list> The thirty-six's fifth—the six faculties with outflows,
[14204] <list> The first group's six faculties seeing beyond—thirty without outflows,
[14205] <list> The last, utterly without outflows, should be known.
[14206] <prose> Those from the <tantra>Sun-Moon Union:
[14207] <prose> Thus arising in that manner, the six clairvoyances arise for that class:
[14208] <verse> knowledge of previous realms,
[14209] <verse> death and transmigration, || 10 ||
[14210] <verse> knowledge of birth,
[14211] <verse> knowledge of others' minds,
[14212] <verse> knowledge of all hidden appearances,
[14213] <verse> seeing and knowing the six realms,
[14214] <verse> clairvoyance of purified faculties—
[14215] <prose> six arise, thus.
[14216] <verse> The fourth: attainment of retentive powers,
[14217] <verse> Previously heard Dharma all appearing simultaneously,
[14218] <verse> Innumerable Dharma categories never before heard also arising,
[14219] <verse> Therefore called the dharmatā bardo, || 20 ||
[14220] <verse> From that itself: at that time, retentive powers of non-forgetting.
[14221] <verse> Arise in one's own continuum,
[14222] <verse> All previous Dharma appearing simultaneously in the continuum,
[14223] <verse> Likewise, never-before-heard Dharma also arising,
[14224] <verse> Therefore called the dharmatā bardo, thus.
[14225] <verse> The fifth: manner of meditative absorption's arising—
[14226] <verse> At that time, mind's engagement exhausted in the manner of dharmatā's purity,
[14227] <verse> Abiding non-conceptually.
[14228] <verse> The manner of exhaustion:
[14229] <verse> Where exhausted, exhausted in one's own continuum; <verse>How exhausted? The appearance-rain of the above qualities <verse>Exhausted in the manner of dharmatā's purity. <verse>What is that appearance at that time? <verse>The appearance of dharmatā's exhaustion arising, <verse>Bad conceptuality—previous clinging || 30 ||
[14230] <verse> Subsequent grasping,
[14231] <verse> Good clairvoyance,
[14232] <verse> Recollection, and so forth—
[14233] <verse> Do not arise at all,
[14234] <verse> Like the state of pure space.
[14235] <tantra>From the Sun-Moon Union:
[14236] <verse> Continuous meditative absorption's continuum.
[14237] <verse> Arising as its own nature,
[14238] <verse> Bad conceptuality does not arise at all,
[14239] <verse> Thus. || 40 ||
[14240] <prose> At this point, the liberation and delusion modes of the twenty-one faculties should be known.
[14241] <prose> As the text is somewhat extensive, shown separately below.
[14242] <verse> The sixth: spontaneous presence's dissolution manner—
[14243] <verse> Previously arisen now gathering within:
[14244] <verse> Dissolution modes eight arising simultaneously.
[14245] <break> <verse> Compassion dissolving into compassion,
[14246] <break> <verse> Like the sun's rays gathering at sunset;
[14247] <break> <verse> The appearance-rain of the six families.
[14248] <break> <verse> Light dissolving into light,
[14249] <verse> Like a rainbow dissolving in space— || 50 ||
[14250] <verse> No trace of light and color signs,
[14251] <verse> The expanse free from grasping at emptiness,
[14252] <verse> Of single taste;
[14253] <verse> Body dissolving into Body,
[14254] <verse> Like a vase body,
[14255] <verse> Knowables luminous within,
[14256] <verse> No accomplished sign-marked face and hands,
[14257] <verse> Completely pure;
[14258] <verse> Pristine cognition dissolving into pristine cognition,
[14259] <break> <verse> Like a child entering the mother's lap— || 60 ||
[14260] <break> <verse> dharmatā mother and child without duality merged,
[14261] <verse> No grasping;
[14262] <verse> Non-duality dissolving into non-duality,
[14263] <verse> Like a river dissolving into a river—
[14264] <verse> Liberated from the beginning,
[14265] <verse> Of single taste as Dharmakāya,
[14266] <prose> 
[14267] <prose> 
[14268] <prose> 
[14269] <prose> || 70 ||
[14270] <prose> 
[14271] <prose> 
[14272] <prose> 
[14273] <prose> 
[14274] <prose> 
[14275] <prose> 
[14276] <break> <prose> 
[14277] <break> <prose>
