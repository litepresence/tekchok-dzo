[2539] <prose> Selflessness of persons is established through outer grasping being non-existent.
[2540] <prose> Selflessness of dharmas is established through lack of true existence in phenomena.
[2541] <prose> Thus is explained the complete Sautrāntika view.
[2542] <ornament> Herein, how should one explain the cultivation of the path?
[2543] <prose> The antidote for the three poisons of desire, anger, and delusion is the realization of emptiness.
[2544] <prose> Individual antidotes are applied: meditation on impurity as antidote for desire,
[2545] <prose> Meditation on love as antidote for anger, and meditation on dependent arising as antidote for delusion.
[2546] <prose> The faculties of practitioners are classified as dull, medium, and sharp.
[2547] <prose> Effort is made according to the capacity of these faculties.
[2548] <prose> The bodhisattvas' path is that of the five previously described transcendent perfections. || 10 ||
[2549] <prose> Thus is explained the cultivation of the path in brief.
[2550] <ornament> Herein, how should one explain the effects or results?
[2551] <prose> For hearers, the four effects: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and foe-destroyer.
[2552] <prose> For the self-enlightened: solitary rhinoceros-like pratyekabuddhas.
[2553] <prose> For bodhisattvas: the ten grounds beginning with great joy.
[2554] <prose> Thus are explained the various effects.
[2555] <ornament> Herein, how should one explain the self-enlightened vehicle?
[2556] <prose> They realize dependent arising through their own power of wisdom,
[2557] <prose> Without relying upon a teacher in their final life.
[2558] <prose> Like a rhinoceros wandering alone, they practice in solitude. || 20 ||
[2559] <prose> Thus is explained the self-enlightened vehicle.
[2560] <ornament> Herein, how should one explain the bodhisattva vehicle?
[2561] <prose> Through generation of bodhicitta and engagement in the six perfections,
[2562] <prose> Perfecting the two accumulations, they attain enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings.
[2563] <prose> Thus is explained the bodhisattva vehicle in brief.
[2564] <prose> Maha, Anu, and Ati are taught.
[2565] <tantra> From the Great Array of Ati:
[2566] <prose> The phenomena taught by me
[2567] <ornament> Herein, explaining in detail the Great Vehicle:
[2568] <prose> First, the essence of the bodhisattva vehicle: || 30 ||
[2569] <prose> The generation of bodhicitta and engagement in the six transcendent perfections.
[2570] <prose> Definition: That vehicle which is entered through the power of compassion.
[2571] <prose> Purpose: Establishing all sentient beings in the state of buddhahood.
[2572] <prose> Effect: Attaining the ten grounds and traversing the five paths.
[2573] <prose> Division: Two systems—the Prajñāpāramitā system and the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2574] <prose> Thus is explained the bodhisattva vehicle in detail.
[2575] <ornament> Herein, the Prajñāpāramitā system:
[2576] <prose> Realizing the three circles—subject, object, and action—as empty of inherent existence,
[2577] <prose> Perfecting the six transcendent perfections,
[2578] <prose> Attaining buddhahood through traversing the five paths and ten grounds. || 40 ||
[2579] <prose> Thus is explained the Prajñāpāramitā system.
[2580] <ornament> Herein, the Tathāgatagarbha system:
[2581] <prose> Recognizing the Buddha-nature endowed with all virtues as existent from the beginning,
[2582] <prose> Purifying adventitious defilements that obscure it,
[2583] <prose> Revealing the essence spontaneously present as the result.
[2584] <prose> Thus is explained the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2585] <ornament> Herein, the grounds and paths:
[2586] <prose> The five paths: accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, and no-more-learning.
[2587] <prose> The ten grounds: joyous, stainless, luminous, radiant, difficult-to-conquer, manifest, gone-afar, immovable, good-intelligence, and cloud-of-dharma.
[2588] <prose> Thus are explained the grounds and paths. || 50 ||
[2589] <ornament> Herein, the two accumulations:
[2590] <prose> Merit accumulated through the first five perfections of generosity, morality, patience, effort, and concentration,
[2591] <prose> Wisdom accumulated through the perfection of discernment or prajñā.
[2592] <prose> Thus are explained the two accumulations.
[2593] <ornament> Herein, the final ground:
[2594] <prose> The tenth ground, called cloud-of-dharma,
[2595] <prose> Where the bodhisattva is surrounded by Buddhas and receives the great empowerment,
[2596] <prose> Thus attaining complete and perfect buddhahood.
[2597] <prose> Thus is explained the final ground.
[2598] <ornament> Herein, the common vehicle summary: || 60 ||
[2599] <prose> Through the three vehicles, beings of three capacities—dull, medium, and sharp—are tamed.
[2600] <prose> This is the causal vehicle establishing the causes of buddhahood.
[2601] <prose> Thus is the common vehicle explained.
[2602] <prose> Sutras,
[2603] <prose> Vinaya,
[2604] <prose> Abhidharma,
[2605] <prose> Those three equally divided into twenty-one thousand,
[2606] <prose> The eighty-four thousand dharmaskandhas.
[2607] <break> <prose> Those with dull faculties and those of medium effort—
[2608] <break> <prose> Some among them obtain the result within that very life. || 70 ||
[2609] <prose> Those with sharp faculties,
[2610] <prose> And some bodhisattvas who have previously traversed the five paths, having accumulated the collections extensively as a basis, desire liberation upon one seat having completed the five paths.
[2611] <ornament> Regarding this, from the hearer vehicle perspective:
[2612] <prose> Their path, through small intellect,
[2613] <prose> Medium intellect,
[2614] <prose> And great intellect, hearers of three types
[2615] <prose> Along with self-enlightened,
[2616] <prose> And Buddha-enlightenment three—desire to accomplish these results,
[2617] <prose> But the Mahāyāna and mantra path they do not desire to traverse.
[2618] <prose> For hearers and self-enlightened, the eight inferior grounds from the White Completely-Seeing Ground and so forth are taught. || 80 ||
[2619] <prose> Relying upon these classifications: stream-enterer,
[2620] <prose> Once-returner,
[2621] <prose> Non-returner,
[2622] <prose> And foe-destroyer—
[2623] <prose> Each entered and
[2624] <prose> Each abiding are divided two-by-two, thus called the eight stages of great persons.
[2625] <prose> For bodhisattvas' ten grounds from Great Joy and so forth also, the four renunciation results are taught to exist correspondingly.
[2626] <ornament> Regarding these, from the Self-Arisen Wisdom Tantra, Rigpa Rangshar:
[2627] <tantra> "The hearer vehicle is thus explained:
[2628] <tantra> The entry gate is realization of the four truths. || 90 ||
[2629] <tantra> The hearers' general entry gate.
[2630] <tantra> Divisions are held as two types:
[2631] <tantra> Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika.
[2632] <tantra> The Vaibhāṣikas' view:
[2633] <tantra> Aggregates, elements, and sense-bases
[2634] <tantra> Are held in the manner of yak-horn and conch—distinct and real.
[2635] <tantra> When become signs of own intellect,
[2636] <tantra> Dust and dust-atoms minute particles are held as ultimately real.
[2637] <tantra> Thus completely analyzing all phenomena,
[2638] <tantra> Emptiness is meditated through reduction to atoms. || 100 ||
[2639] <tantra> The Sautrāntikas' view:
[2640] <tantra> Recitation-made self-nature through study,
[2641] <tantra> Hearing, contemplation, meditation three,
[2642] <tantra> Through cultivating wisdom of these three,
[2643] <tantra> Desire to obtain the ten grounds' supreme result.
[2644] <tantra> Hearers' general type:
[2645] <tantra> Meditating the four truths thoroughly,
[2646] <tantra> Desire to obtain the four fruitional results.
[2647] <tantra> That also, meditation-method is thus:
[2648] <tantra> Desiring to meditate cessation of suffering, || 110 ||
[2649] <tantra> Desiring to abandon origination of suffering.
[2650] <tantra> Cessation meditation-method is thus:
[2651] <tantra> Upon these external elements,
[2652] <tantra> Entering into non-attached abode of peace,
[2653] <tantra> First accustoming to food and sustenance.
[2654] <tantra> Having become accustomed to food,
[2655] <tantra> Samādhi and concentration meditate,
[2656] <tantra> Samādhi non-conceptual single-pointedly meditate.
[2657] <tantra> Upon the Victor Maitreya's teaching,
[2658] <tantra> Desire to obtain the liberating result. || 120 ||
[2659] <tantra> Origination abandonment is thus:
[2660] <tantra> Free from food's concept,
[2661] <tantra> Desiring to cut the continuum of origination.
[2662] <tantra> That also, as anger's antidote meditate,
[2663] <tantra> All afflictions completely abandon.
[2664] <tantra> Ground-path meditation is thus:
[2665] <tantra> As desire's antidote meditate,
[2666] <tantra> As delusion's antidote meditate.
[2667] <tantra> Thus the path's meditation:
[2668] <tantra> Desiring to abandon suffering's root. || 130 ||
[2669] <tantra> Path's meditation-method is thus:
[2670] <tantra> As desire's antidote,
[2671] <tantra> Upon own forehead's maṇḍala,
[2672] <tantra> A white skeleton thumb-sized visualize,
[2673] <tantra> Having meditated white light-rays accumulated,
[2674] <tantra> From that produced, then just the head visualize,
[2675] <tantra> Then just the body meditate,
[2676] <tantra> Then just own surrounding visualize,
[2677] <tantra> Then whatever-appears all meditate as skeleton.
[2678] <tantra> Thus three-thousand white skeletons, || 140 ||
[2679] <tantra> Thus white accustomed through repetition,
[2680] <tantra> Desire's suffering completely abandon.
[2681] <tantra> Delusion suffering abandon:
[2682] <tantra> Also upon own head's crown,
[2683] <break> <tantra> Fire red, clear tone visualize."
[2684] <break> <ornament> Herein, explaining the three types of vows:
[2685] <prose> Prātimokṣa vows of individual liberation, bodhisattva vows, and mantra or tantric vows.
[2686] <prose> Thus are explained the three vows in brief.
[2687] <ornament> Herein, the Prātimokṣa vows:
[2688] <prose> Eight types: bhikṣu full monk, bhikṣuṇī full nun, śikṣamāṇā probationary nun, śrāmaṇera novice monk, śrāmaṇerikā novice nun, || 150 ||
[2689] <prose> Upāsaka layman, upāsikā laywoman, and one-day upavāsa fasting vow.
[2690] <prose> Thus are explained the Prātimokṣa vows.
[2691] <ornament> Herein, the bodhisattva vows:
[2692] <prose> Aspiring bodhicitta and engaging bodhicitta.
[2693] <prose> The twenty root downfalls and forty-six branch faults to be abandoned.
[2694] <prose> Restoring broken vows through the four powers: regret, reliance, remedy, and resolve.
[2695] <prose> Thus are explained the bodhisattva vows.
[2696] <ornament> Herein, the mantra or tantric vows:
[2697] <prose> The fourteen root downfalls and eight thick branch faults.
[2698] <prose> Samaya commitments of body, speech, and mind. || 160 ||
[2699] <prose> Restoring through appropriate recitation and meditation practices.
[2700] <prose> Thus are explained the mantra vows.
[2701] <ornament> Herein, the summary of vehicles and vows:
[2702] <prose> The three vehicles for three types of beings with different capacities,
[2703] <prose> The three vows for three types of practitioners on those paths.
[2704] <prose> Thus are explained vehicles and vows together.
[2705] <ornament> Herein, the vehicle of characteristics:
[2706] <prose> Established through causes and conditions gradually cultivated,
[2707] <prose> Gradually traversed over countless aeons to reach the goal.
[2708] <prose> Thus is explained the vehicle of characteristics. || 170 ||
[2709] <ornament> Herein, the vehicle of mantra:
[2710] <prose> Established through the methods of channels, winds, and drops,
[2711] <prose> Traversed swiftly through profound skillful means to enlightenment.
[2712] <prose> Thus is explained the vehicle of mantra.
[2713] <break> <ornament> Herein, the vehicle of Ati or Great Perfection:
[2714] <break> <prose> Established through directly recognizing the nature of mind as it is,
[2715] <prose> Instantaneous liberation without need for gradual stages.
[2716] <prose> Thus is explained the vehicle of Ati.
[2717] <ornament> Herein, distinguishing the vehicles:
[2718] <prose> By method, by view, by conduct, and by effect they differ. || 180 ||
[2719] <prose> Thus are explained the distinctions among vehicles.
[2720] <prose> Thus the explanation of the common vehicle is completed.
[2721] <prose> Desiring to abandon the origin of all.
[2722] <prose> The cessation cultivation method is thus:
[2723] <prose> Toward these external elements,
[2724] <prose> Entering the abode without attachment,
[2725] <prose> First becoming accustomed to food.
[2726] <prose> Realizing that phenomena, like reflections in a mirror, are without inherent essence by nature and unarisen from the beginning.
[2727] <prose> Furthermore, the two—outer grasping toward the self-existence of dharmas
[2728] <prose> And inner knowledge grasping the antidote—are both superimpositions of true existence. || 190 ||
[2729] <prose> Therefore, the self of the person is the knowledge of abandonment regarding the dharmas comprising the five aggregates, grasping at I and mine.
[2730] <prose> These are called the self of the person and the self of dharmas.
[2731] <prose> Though ārya hearers realize the selflessness of the person, they do not realize the selflessness of dharmas.
[2732] <prose> Self-enlightened ones realize above that the outer grasping of dharmas is non-existent, yet do not realize the non-existence of the inner grasping antidote.
[2733] <tantra> From the Ornament of Clear Realization, Abhisamayālaṅkāra:
[2734] <tantra> "In order to abandon thought of the grasped object,
[2735] <tantra> "And in order not to abandon grasping itself,
[2736] <tantra> "The rhinoceros-like path of support
[2737] <tantra> "Should be known through correct summary."
[2738] <prose> Thus it is taught. || 200 ||
[2739] <prose> Wherein, the time required is through accumulating the collections comprising the path of accumulation for a hundred great kalpas.
[2740] <tantra> "The rhinoceros through the cause of a hundred kalpas"
[2741] <prose> Is thus taught in scripture.
[2742] <prose> The crow-like self-enlightened:
[2743] <prose> Meditates on dependent origination in reverse order.
[2744] <prose> Going to the charnel ground, contemplating from "From what does this corpse arise?"
[2745] <verse> "It arises from death," thus from ignorance as the root,
[2746] <prose> Based on realizing half and two aspects of selflessness,
[2747] <prose> Through meditating on the five paths, they manifest the enlightenment of knowing weariness with saṃsāra and non-arising of phenomena.
[2748] <prose> Both types of self-enlightened teach Dharma through bodily signs, not through speech. || 210 ||
[2749] <tantra> These methods are also from the Self-Arisen Wisdom Tantra, Rigpa Rangshar:
[2750] <tantra> "A-ho, Secret Lord, listen well!
[2751] <tantra> "The sūtra vehicle of the self-enlightened ones:
[2752] <tantra> "The door of entry is the twelve links of dependent origination.
[2753] <tantra> "The realized view is the selflessness of the person,
[2754] <tantra> "Holding half the power of the view of dharmas' selflessness.
[2755] <tantra> "Keeping the two hundred fifty disciplines of protection,

[2759] <tantra> "Holding the measure of perfected fruit.
[2760] <tantra> "These also are indicated by examples thus:
[2761] <tantra> "For example, like a corpse in the charnel ground,
[2762] <tantra> "Having gone to the charnel ground,

[2764] <tantra> "Now, what is the entity of this corpse?
