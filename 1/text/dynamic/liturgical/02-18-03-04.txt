[4428] <prose> Fourth, regarding these: through the four supports or companions, if the pith is not familiarized, familiarization does not reach the measure. Therefore the final support instruction and four topics are taught:
[4429] <tantra> From the Glorious Mountain-Stack Tantra:
[4430] <verse> If one desires to familiarize the direct pith,
[4431] <verse> The pith is distinguished as four sections.
[4432] <tantra>Thus it is.
[4433] <prose> The certainty of completing the path through four topics:
[4434] <prose> Externally, exhausting the appearances of the four emanations with their supports;
[4435] <prose> Internally, exhausting the increase and decrease of the four times;
[4436] <prose> Secretly, exhausting the changes of the four day-moons;
[4437] <prose> Supreme, emptying the ground of the four body-speech-mind-consciousness—thus four certainties. || 10 ||
[4438] <prose> Moreover, externally demonstrating the certainty of the four empowerments;
[4439] <prose> Internally, expanding the channels of the four wheels;
[4440] <prose> Secretly, actually clarifying the four wisdoms;
[4441] <prose> Supreme, showing the increase of the four lamps—thus four topics are taught.
[4442] <prose> If more than this, chattering is purposeless;
[4443] <prose> If fewer, without root, the fruit of the desired meaning does not ripen—depending on purpose, thus four arise.
[4444] <ornament> First, exhausting the pith of body and speech:
[4445] <tantra>From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra:
[4446] <verse> Thus having gone before,
[4447] <verse> In order to look at the direct meaning, || 20 ||
[4448] <verse> Body, speech, and mind are thoroughly bound.
[4449] <tantra>Thus it is said.
[4450] <prose> Here there are three:
[4451] <list> Establishing the three kāyas' postures of the body;
[4452] <list> Speech not speaking anything, like a mute;
[4453] <list> Cutting the proliferating thoughts of mind's dispersion and gathering.
[4454] <ornament> First:
[4455] <tantra>From that itself:
[4456] <verse> The body—like a lion,
[4457] <verse> Like a sage, and like an elephant: || 30 ||
[4458] <verse> If one does not move from these,
[4459] <verse> Even with three thousand Buddhas,
[4460] <verse> The fortune is equal.
[4461] <tantra>Thus it is said.
[4462] <tantra>From the Pearl Garland:
[4463] <verse> The body's pith is threefold:
[4464] <verse> The lion's manner and elephant's manner,
[4465] <verse> Abide like a sage.
[4466] <tantra>Thus it is said.
[4467] <prose> Here, the three kāyas too, though the supports are different, through three different postures of a single body— || 40 ||
