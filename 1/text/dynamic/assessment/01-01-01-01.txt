---

## LAYER 2: LITERAL (FROZEN/literal/)

**Status:** FROZEN - Finalized 2026-02-10
**Prompt:** 1:1 grammatical mapping, no articles, particle precision
**Lines:** 175
**Assessment:** A+ (Excellent)

### Strengths:
- Exact 1:1 line correspondence with Tibetan (175 lines)
- Zero articles (a, an, the) - meets constraint perfectly
- Proper particle rendering with slash ambiguity markers:
  - Line 7: "Indian language to/in/" (la particle ambiguity)
  - Line 8: "yAnAgra ratna koSha nA ma/" (Sanskrit preserved)
- Hyphenated compounds reflecting Tibetan structure:
  - Line 4: "Supreme-Vehicle Jewel-Treasury"
  - Line 12: "own-nature five-perfections"
  - Line 14: "aural-lineage"
- Particle precision maintained throughout
- No interpretation or smoothing - pure syntactic mapping
- Ablative default for las (lines 20, 34, 58, 64)

### Issues:
MINOR: Line 4 ends with "abides*/" - notation is correct but could be clearer.
MINOR: Some compound hyphenation choices are arbitrary but follow constraints.

### Alignment with Exemplar:
Meets exemplar standards in exemplars.md Section "LITERAL LAYER - SECTION-BASED EXEMPLARS"

**Verdict:** FROZEN status justified. Serves as excellent syntactic scaffold.

---

## LAYER 3: LITURGICAL (FROZEN/liturgical/)

**Status:** FROZEN - Finalized 2026-02-15
**Prompt:** Vairotsana voice, elegant prose/verse, XML tags, 1:1 line count
**Lines:** 175
**Assessment:** A++ (Exemplary - Gold Standard)

### Strengths:
- PERFECT 1:1 line correspondence (175 lines = 175 lines)
- Proper XML tagging system:
  - <ornament> for structural elements (lines 1-11)
  - <verse> for rhythmic homage (lines 12-27)
  - <prose> for doctrinal exposition (lines 28-110)
  - <tantra> for Guhyagarbha citation (lines 62-109)
  - <break> for section transitions
- Publication numbering every 10 lines: || 10 ||, || 20 ||, || 30 ||, etc.
- Metaphysical precision maintained throughout
- Elegant Vajra Speech cadence with parallel structures
- Proper Sanskrit/IAST transliteration
- Appropriate hyphenation and capitalization standards

### Issues: NONE SIGNIFICANT

TINY: Line 110 has <prose> but line 111 starts with lowercase "And" - minor stylistic inconsistency.

### Alignment with Exemplar:
EXCEEDS EXEMPLAR STANDARDS. Specifically cited as EXEMPLAR 1 in exemplars.md.

**Verdict:** Publication-ready. No further revision needed.

---

## LAYER 4: COMMENTARY (DYNAMIC/commentary/)

**Status:** DYNAMIC - Active refinement
**Prompt:** 27 Dzogchen master voices, line-range blocks, 40+ lines, resonating not forcing
**Lines:** 213
**Assessment:** A (Very Good with Issues)

### Strengths:
- Line-range tagged blocks: [1-4], [5-11], [12-15], etc. (proper format)
- Multiple voices present:
  - Garab Dorje voice (stark directness): "Three words. See what is. Rest."
  - Patrul voice (earthy): "This old man has seen them..."
  - Poetic/visionary voice: "Seven horses: one for each day of the week that never happened"
- Some excellent penetrating insight:
  - "The title is not the treasure. The name is not the thing named."
  - "Dzogchen is not the pinnacle - it is the ground (gzhi) before mountains."
- Resonating tone (mostly): "Rest in recognition."
- No attribution (follows constraint)
- No modern references
- Exceeds minimum 40 lines (213 lines)

### Issues:

MODERATE - Repetitive Content:
The phrase "Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts - the space you are reading these words from" appears 6 times (lines 42, 44, 97, 99, 156, 182). This is excessive repetition suggesting template-driven generation.

MODERATE - Voice Distinctiveness:
While multiple voices exist, distinction between them is sometimes unclear. File claims 27 voices but difficult to identify more than 6-8 distinct voices.

MINOR - Some "wrathful" moments edge toward commanding rather than inviting:
- Line 82: "Stop climbing." (commanding)
- Would be better as: "The ladder has no top because there is no floor to leave."

### Alignment with Exemplar:
Per exemplars.md, Commentary exemplars should have direct "you" address, tangible metaphors, piercing instructions - all present. However, exemplar PAGE_141.txt has "line-by-line engagement" - this file has more aggregated blocks.

### Recommendations:
1. Remove or vary the repeated phrase - reduce from 6 instances to 1-2
2. Clarify voice transitions - make distinct voices more obviously different
3. Check exemplar PAGE_141.txt for line-by-line pattern

**Verdict:** Good quality but needs refinement to reach A+ or A++ standards. Repetition issue is main blocker.

## LAYER 5: SCHOLAR (DYNAMIC/scholar/)

**Status:** DYNAMIC - Active refinement
**Prompt:** Four Pillars (structure, philology, context, concept), third person, no practice advice
**Lines:** 722
**Assessment:** A++ (Exemplary)

### Strengths:
- FOUR PILLARS FRAMEWORK applied comprehensively:
  - <structure>: Architectural mapping of each section
  - <philology>: Particle analysis with Wylie
  - <context>: Doxographical placement, citations from tantras
  - <concept>: Philosophical unpacking of Dzogchen tenets
- Line ranges accurate: [1-4], [5-11], [12-15], [16-19], etc.
- Third person scholarly voice: "Longchenpa presents," "The Text"
- No devotional language or practice advice
- Extensive Wylie usage with semantic explanations
- Doxographical precision on nine-vehicle framework
- Philological precision on particles and terminology
- Substantial depth: 722 lines for 175 source lines = ~4:1 ratio

### Issues: NONE SIGNIFICANT

TINY: Occasionally uses first person plural "we" - minor deviation from strict third person but acceptable in scholarly discourse.

### Alignment with Exemplar:
MEETS EXEMPLAR STANDARDS. Specifically noted in exemplars.md as A++ quality.

**Verdict:** Publication-ready. Comprehensive, rigorous, meets all Four Pillars requirements.

---

## LAYER 6: EPISTEMIC (DYNAMIC/epistemic/)

**Status:** DYNAMIC - Active refinement
**Prompt:** XML-tagged view classification (<view>, <pedagogy>, <risk>), epistemic neutrality
**Lines:** 141
**Assessment:** A+ (Excellent)

### Strengths:
- FOUR PILLARS EPISTEMIC FRAMEWORK:
  - <view> tags: dzogchen-rigpa, tantric-transformative
  - <pedagogy> tags: declarative-finality, instructional-provisionality, polemical-distinction
  - <risk> tags: reification, view-collapse, nihilism
  - <classification> statements
- Proper XML formatting with opening tags only (no closing tags)
- Epistemic neutrality: Classifies FROM WHERE spoken, not what is true
- Sophisticated view stratification across vehicle hierarchy
- Pedagogical precision on instruction types
- Risk assessment for reification, view-collapse, nihilism

### Issues: NONE SIGNIFICANT

### Alignment with Exemplar:
MEETS NEW EXEMPLAR STANDARD. Follows A++ gold standard format established in "Twelve Yogins Classification" exemplar.

**Verdict:** Excellent quality. Follows the Four Pillars format precisely.

---

## LAYER 7: DELUSION (DYNAMIC/delusion/)

**Status:** DYNAMIC - Active refinement
**Prompt:** Error analysis, failure-mode cartography, clinical tone
**Lines:** 287
**Assessment:** A+ (Excellent - Comprehensive)

### Strengths:
- COMPREHENSIVE ERROR TAXONOMY:
  - <ontological-error>, <reification-error>, <temporal-error>
  - <hierarchical-error>, <spatial-reification-error>
  - <personification-error>, <causal-inversion-error>
  - And 10+ more error types
- STRUCTURED DIAGNOSTIC BLOCKS with:
  - Misreading, Why it arises, Primary consequence
  - Secondary consequences, Cascade effects
- PAGE BLEED AWARENESS: Explicitly marks cross-page dependencies
- Clinical, exact tone throughout
- No stating correct view or practice guidance
- Realistic misreadings identified
- Cascade effect mapping showing error chains

### Issues: NONE SIGNIFICANT

MINOR: Some cascade chains are truncated but this follows "no speculation" constraint.

### Alignment with Exemplar:
MEETS PREMIER EXEMPLAR STANDARDS. At 287 lines, this is 79% of premier exemplar standard (363 lines).

**Verdict:** Comprehensive, rigorous, clinically precise. Excellent error cartography.

---

## LAYER 8: COGNITIVE (DYNAMIC/cognitive/)

**Status:** DYNAMIC - Active refinement
**Prompt:** Internal alignment log, quiet self-talk, calm settled tone
**Lines:** 87
**Assessment:** A- (Good but Short)

### Strengths:
- Proper format: Line ranges [1-11], [12-15], [16-19], etc.
- Quiet, non-didactic tone: "Opening frame establishing textual authority."
- Calm, settled voice with no urgency
- Self-talk style throughout
- No questions, no uncertainty, no teaching
- Covers implicit content requirements:
  - Structural function, View register
  - Translation risks, Preservation requirements

### Issues:

MODERATE - Too Short:
At 87 lines, this is significantly shorter than other layers (Scholar: 722, Delusion: 287, Epistemic: 141, Commentary: 213). Should be 150-200+ lines for this important opening section.

MODERATE - Content Coverage:
Some line ranges get only 2-3 lines of cognitive notes. Coverage feels thin in places.

MINOR - Could be More Explicit:
Exemplar shows longer, more detailed paragraphs. This file covers requirements implicitly but could be more explicit.

### Alignment with Exemplar:
BELOW EXEMPLAR STANDARDS. The exemplar in prompt_cognitive.md shows longer paragraphs explicitly covering all four requirements.

### Recommendations:
1. Expand to 150-200 lines for this section
2. Make view register explicit: "Dharmakaya register" or "Sutric-provisional framing"
3. Make translation risks explicit: "Risk of reifying Samantabhadra as person"

**Verdict:** Good quality but too brief. Needs expansion to reach A or A+ standards.

2. Cognitive layer: Expand from 87 lines to 150-200 lines

### Minor Issues:
1. Commentary layer: Clarify voice distinctiveness
2. Cognitive layer: Make view register and translation risks more explicit

### Strengths:
1. Liturgical layer: A++ Gold Standard - exemplary work
2. Scholar layer: Comprehensive Four Pillars analysis
3. Delusion layer: Thorough error cartography with cascade mapping
4. Epistemic layer: Precise view stratification
5. Literal layer: Exact 1:1 grammatical mapping

### Summary:
This is a HIGH QUALITY multi-layer translation of the opening prologue. The FROZEN layers (Tibetan, Literal, Liturgical) are publication-ready with the Liturgical layer serving as A++ Gold Standard. The DYNAMIC layers show strong performance with Scholar at A++, Epistemic and Delusion at A+, Commentary at A (needs repetition fix), and Cognitive at A- (needs expansion).

The project demonstrates excellent cross-layer consistency in terminology and line ranges. Voice differentiation is maintained appropriately across layers. With minor fixes to Commentary (remove repetition) and Cognitive (expand content), all layers will be at A+ or A++ standard.
