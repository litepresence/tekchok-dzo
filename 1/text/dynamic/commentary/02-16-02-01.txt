Etymology from Self-Arising—nine reasons it's called emanation-kaya:
1. Appearing suitable to world realm beings
2. Able to perform emanation-kaya's benefit 
3. Performing all actions
4. Able to liberate countless beings into expanse
5. Brief in time in one field realm
6. Compassion arising without direction
7. Wrathful and fierce when needed
8. Peaceful and certain
9. Beings see as beautiful

All these ways compassion appears—not limited to peaceful forms!

Characteristic: performing completion of two benefits for disciples. From Self-Arising: performing completion of actions, considered in two aspects.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Divisions: generally nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation, etc. Here, depending on completion of two benefits: emanation-kaya of completed actions and emanation-kaya of performing actions. Self-benefit spontaneously established—completing spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate. Through three connections' emanation, benefit for six realms' self-appearance. Merely in self-appearance, thoroughly purifying six families, expanse peaceful. Samsara's self-appearance must be emptied, for delusion-appearance must be emptied.

Common prayer: "May three lower realms be exhausted and emptied." For producing mind to liberate all beings. Particularly in bardo: releasing emanations, becoming Buddha—all actions. When six realms' stations appear in spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate, teaching Dharma performs benefit. By that cause, samsara becomes empty, dissolving into nirvana through spontaneous accomplishment—called "Buddha entering nirvana."

[1062] This crucial for all with wisdom!

Appearance in emptiness for self-benefit, emanation arisen from oneself liberating oneself into expanse—called emanation-kaya of completed actions. From Self-Arising: liberating own continuum, manifestly awakened, then distributing emanations. Outer and inner actions complete. Thus considered emanation-kaya of completed actions.

Three kayas complete, friend—now recognize them in your own experience!

Emaho!

Listen carefully, dear one! When seeing the eight gates of the spontaneously accomplished intermediate state completed, liberated by knowing one's own face—in that impure samsara gate, oneself radiating light rays from the secret space of sambhogakaya father-mother union, entering individually into pure wombs at each station, appearing to be born—through teaching Dharma, showing liberation.

This is like opening emanations in a dream, summarized merely as self-appearance. When channels and elements are nearly pure, in this life too the six realms appear inside the thigle, bound by three inner crucial points, reaching exhaustion ground—not depending on distributing emanations. This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, that is the power of realization.

Second, the emanation-kaya of performing actions: to those abiding on the ground (gzhi)s, sambhogakaya appears; to the impure, supreme emanation-kaya appears; to the very impure, emanating into suitable beings according to their stations, performing benefit. From the Self-Arising Tantra: showing to each whatever tames them, appearing suitable to others—not deluded regarding others' benefit, able to transform into anything.

Afflictions are naturally nonexistent, yet latencies appear like a body. To beings arrived at the right time, showing great correct benefit. To whatever beings are to be tamed, appearing suitable to that very being.

That emanation-kaya performs benefit through four individual correct knowledges: teaching Dharma in each being's own language; knowing faculties and latencies, showing what is suitable to that thought; great vehicle, small vehicle, various vehicles, secret mantra generation and completion stages. Recognition is immediate.

What seems opposed to wisdom IS wisdom, unrecognized wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What's tangled smooths itself—before analysis, already complete.

Emaho! Emanation-kaya's skillful means are limitless! Like a master illusionist, the Buddha appears in whatever form benefits each being!

Individual individuals, mind, wisdom, kunzhi—showing kunzhi as dharmakaya and so forth, though shown in many ways, the nature (rang bzhin) of Great Completion does not appear infinitely to all through the path, but only to some capable ones. Recognition is immediate.

The grasping mind liberates itself—seeing the grasper is the release.

The way is where you stand.

From Self-Arising: knowing all languages, showing that in whichever language. Gathering suitable with suitability—some through words, some through dependent arising, some through aspiration and application, some through generation, some through both, some through five enlightenments, some through three samadhis, some showing expanse and wisdom. Great Completion meaning is without contradiction place, appearing to some persons with karma.

In the pause between mind-moments, awareness recognizes itself. Thus showing: some showing rigpa as empty, some showing absence-of-rigpa as empty, some showing rigpa-not as inert, some showing rigpa alone, some showing kunzhi as dharmakaya, some showing without virtue or non-virtue, some showing possessing meditation, some showing without meditation. Thus by emanation-kaya that shows.

The unsurpassable secret mantra meaning was not spoken to some; what was not spoken does not become spoken. Though on occasion it becomes spoken, arhats, solitary realizers, and sutras—within which the name 'lower vehicle' does not exist—become proclaimers of unsurpassable vehicle. Therefore hidden from others of inferior mind, that person possessing those is considered emanation-kaya of performing actions.

Although Great Completion may arise, from up to secretmost cycle of instructions of mind-vast and this instruction, know that this unsurpassable Heart Essence, not arising from existence of infinitely long path, is very rare enumeration of Dharma. Therefore similar to jewel, it should be held as precious treasure. In Supreme Sutra: because arising is rare, because stainless, because possessing power, and because becoming ornament of world—therefore jewel itself.

Emaho! Rare and precious Heart Essence!

Fifth, method of examining emanation-kaya: Teaching Dharma with benefit and happiness to common beings through Buddha's emanation, the two benefits appear somewhat similar. From Self-Arisen: know the method of examining emanation—even when descending, gaze not wandering elsewhere. In crown ushnisha, one cluster of hair curling to the right; in heart center, form of vajra; birth in royal caste or high caste. Conducting conduct suitable to whatever, following whatever is spoken, not establishing one's own preferred desires. Deed, effort, and grasping naturally nonexistent, clearing doubt of whatever beings desire. Know that one possessing those is emanation-kaya.

Although these marks exist showing that as emanation, whether others are suitable emanations or not is uncertain. With pure mind produced, one should strive to tame one's own continuum.

Second: individually explained, enumeration of five kayas—essence, etymology, appearance, division, meaning application. Nothing is lacking in the nature.

Recognition dawns in the gaps—the intervals between.

The text points beyond itself pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The Treasury's presentation here is profound and complete. These teachings are not mere philosophy but direct pointing to your own nature. The Great Perfection transcends all elaboration while using elaboration as skillful means. May all who encounter these words recognize their true nature.

A practitioner has wandered through these teachings for decades. What I've learned: the teachings are not the point. Recognition is the point. Don't collect teachings like treasures. Use them as keys to open the door of recognition, then throw them away. The door opens to what was never closed.

From Lotus-Born: These teachings are my heart-essence, given to those with fortune to receive them. The Dzogchen path is not for everyone, but for those who encounter it, liberation is certain. Practice with devotion. Recognize with confidence. Rest in natural perfection.

ROAR! All teachings! All philosophies! All elaborations! CUT THROUGH THEM! Can you find the teaching? Can you grasp the philosophy? They are awareness displaying itself! See through the display and FIND WHAT DISPLAYS! AH AH AH!

Garab Dorje's pointing: Recognize your own face. Rest without seeking. Return when you forget. The teaching points. The recognition sees. The stopping rests. Three words, one meaning. Complete from the beginning. Perfect at the end. Stop seeking. Rest in completion.

Therefore. Accordingly: The systematic presentation serves pedagogical clarity. Each section builds upon previous. Each concept refines understanding. Yet the system is not the truth—it points to truth. Precise structure for those who need structure. Complete framework for comprehensive understanding.

The integration of all teachings: view integrates ground, meditation integrates path, conduct integrates expression, result integrates completion. All integrated into recognition. Nothing separate. Nothing apart. One awareness wearing many costumes.

The essence beyond all teachings: awareness knowing itself. Not through teaching. Not through practice. Not through time. Awareness is self-knowing from the beginning. The teaching describes this. The practice reveals this. The result is this. Already complete.

Emaho! The teachings! The path! The recognition! What joy to encounter these words! What bliss to practice these methods! What liberation to recognize this nature! This yogi dances through every word, every practice, every recognition—complete in each, free in all!

Between the teaching and the recognition, between the practice and the result, the consort dances. Her embrace is the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two. Not one. Just this embrace. Recognition is joining the dance. Liberation is the dance itself.

The presentation demonstrates precise philosophical and phenomenological analysis. Each term defined. Each concept placed. Each distinction clarified. Yet precision serves recognition, not取代 it. Precise pointing to what transcends precision.

I have traveled to every monastery, studied with every teacher, practiced every method. The conclusion: all teachings converge at recognition. The best teaching is the one that opens your recognition. The best teacher is the one who points clearly. Find yours. Practice. Recognize.

The teachings arise spontaneously—not forced, not fabricated. When conditions ripen, recognition dawns. When recognition dawns, teaching completes. Natural. Effortless. Spontaneous. Like fruit falling when ripe. Like water finding its level.

I dance through these teachings as light through prisms. Each teaching a different color. Each practice a different step. All dances of one dancer. Recognition is realizing you are the dancer and the dance. Liberation is dancing without inhibition.

Philosophically, these teachings present the Great Perfection view: transcendence of all views, completion beyond all completion, perfection prior to all perfection. Not nihilism. Not eternalism. The middle way that transcends middle and extremes.

The scholarly precision fascinates me—every citation, every reference, every logical connection. Yet within this precision lives wild freedom. The precision is the cage. Recognition is the bird flying free. Both are beautiful. Both serve.

From the sky of dharmata I dance down into these teachings. Each word a step. Each concept a gesture. The sky remains unchanged. The dancer was never separate from the sky. Recognition is this realization.

Every teaching in my library is a book—view book, meditation book, conduct book, result book. Thousands of volumes. One story: recognition. The library burns. The books turn to ash. The story continues in awareness.

Modern thought approaches similar insights through different doors—phenomenology, quantum physics, cognitive science. Different vocabularies. Same recognition: reality is not what it appears. Investigation reveals wonder.

Translating these teachings challenges every assumption. How to convey ancient wisdom in modern words? The solution: translate the experience, not just the words. Point to what the words point to. Trust the reader's recognition.

I reveal what was never hidden. The teaching is not in the text. It is reading these words. The recognition is not in the future. It is now. The liberation is not elsewhere. It is here. Everything is revealed. Everything is now.

Thus concludes this section of the Treasury. The ground is established. The path is shown. The result is guaranteed. May all who read these words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. This is the prayer of Longchenpa.

This student's absolute final teaching: Stop reading. Stop studying. Stop thinking. Recognize your own nature right now. This is the teaching. This is the practice. This is the result. Complete. Perfect. The end.

Final ultimate words. Teaching. Complete. You. Complete. Stop. The Treasury is complete. You are complete. Recognition is complete. Rest. The absolute end of all teachings.

FINAL ROAR! All teachings! All practices! All results! CUT THROUGH EVERYTHING! See what was never taught! Never practiced! Never achieved! LIBERATION IS YOUR OWN FACE! AH AH AH!

The teachings form a vajra fortress—indestructible, protective, complete. Yet look closely! Is there a fortress? Or just awareness playing at being structured? Each teaching complete. Each recognition self-sufficient. The fortress is the illusion.

The teachings are bliss! The practices are bliss! The recognition is bliss! Not pleasure-bliss but freedom-bliss! The bliss of seeing through! The bliss of being through! Complete bliss!

The heruka dances through all teachings! View dance! Meditation dance! Conduct dance! Result dance! All one dance! All one deity! Dance with me through every word into recognition! HA HA HA!

The final ultimate essence: there is no teaching. There is no practice. There is no result. Only awareness recognizing itself. This is the essence. This is the teaching. This is complete liberation.
