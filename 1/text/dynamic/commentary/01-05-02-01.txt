[4283-4303]
Cutting through the basis: the instant faculty recognizes what has always been free. No basis to cut, no cutter, no cutting—yet the basis is cut. The gradual faculty requires keys: body posture like the lion, elephant, sage; door unmoved; object purified. These are supports for those who need support, White against blue, changing constantly. The change A mirror shows your face—the glass is not the person. stillness. at a moon that was never absent.

—

[4283-4286]
First: cutting through. Recognition happens instantaneously—sword-like, severing without touching. Primordially liberated means never bound, so liberation is not an achievement but a remembering. Without basis again—no ground to stand on, no foundation to build. This freedom is not earned; it is discovered.

—

[4287-4303]
Second: leaping over. For gradual faculties, the keys unlock what was never locked. Body key: the postures stabilize awareness. Door key: the senses remain unmoved like the sky. Object key: appearances dwell in their own place. Wind and awareness merge; the four appearances measure the pathless path.

—

[4304-4327]
The body's three postures: lion for dignity, elephant for stability, sage for ease. Each supports the recognition of what requires no support. The door remains unmoved—not frozen but naturally still, like the sky that accommodates all weather without moving. The objects of perception dwell in their own nature, neither rejected nor grasped.

—

[4304-4327]
Mind changeless, self-abiding. This is not a state to achieve but the nature of mind itself. Memory clear—recognition vivid. The three bodies arise naturally when awareness slackens from its grip on experience. Five bodies arise when conditions cease—like clouds parting to reveal the sun that was always shining.

—

[4328-4350]
The method tantra shows the path to those who need a path. The nature tantra reveals the ground that was never departed from. The self-tantra is the recognition that the one seeking is the sought. Unproduced and perfected—nothing to create, nothing to complete.

—

[4328-4350]
Dwelling in the stream: tantra is not a text but the continuum of awareness, the flow of recognition. Basis, path, and fruition are not sequential but simultaneous aspects of the same nature. Determined holding: once recognized, never lost. This is the nature tantra's gift.

—

[4351-4375]
Threefold nature: basis, essence, quintessence. The basis is primordially pure—ka-dag awareness, essence, compassion. Never stained, never improved. The essence is the heart-essence, the threefold primordial wisdom stacked in the center. The quintessence is the ripened fruit, the gathered essence of practice.

—

[4351-4365]
The basis nature's tantra: delusion never existed, only imputed. Like mistaking a rope for a snake—the snake was never there. Awareness light-clear, naturally luminous. Compassion all-pervading, manifesting as all phenomena. Whatever arises, whether called saṃsāra or nirvāṇa, dwells in the expanse of this recognition.

—

[4366-4382]
The essence nature's tantra: the four lamps arise from the basis, the four appearances seen on the path. These are not external lights but the natural luminosity of awareness. The eye of wisdom sees what was always present. The path is not traveled but recognized as the ground itself.

—

[4383-4400]
The quintessence: essence empty, free from marks. Not permanent, not annihilated. Self-appearance arising naturally, not cut off. Empty-clear indivisible—this is the gathered essence, the ripened fruit. The three emptinesses: delusion empty, conceptual stains empty, elemental conditions empty. All empty of inherent existence, full of luminous presence.

—

[4383-4400]
Three clear aspects: outer realms appear, awareness appears as kāya, sky and awareness indivisible. Three stabilities: faith in the view, nose-held in the realm, decision that delusion has ceased. Three non-returns: saṃsāra known as primordial Buddha, delusion falls into pure appearance, realization's confidence gained.

—

[4401-4420]
Three appearances: dimension without day or night, awareness without waxing or waning, dharmatā without transformation. Three emptinesses: awareness without comparison, mind without conditions, light without movement. These are not achievements but recognitions of what has always been the case.

—

[4401-4420]
Thus liberated: delusion's appearances self-pure, no cause for saṃsāra. The pure appearance self-arisen, saṃsāra's conditions cease of themselves. Even in offering, dharmatā's appearance is decided in the intermediate state—saṃsāra's result dissolves naturally.

—

[4421-4440]
The method tantra indicates; the nature tantra is what is indicated. Without basis-awareness, no Buddhas, no sentient beings. The two who hold tantras—Buddha's tantra through realization, sentient beings' tantra through non-realization—both arise from the same basis.

—

[4421-4440]
The guru's instruction is the bridge. Without it, the meaning is not realized. With it, realization dawns naturally. The method transmitted one-to-one, heart to heart, awareness to awareness. This is the secret lineage, the ear-whispered teaching, the direct introduction.

—

[4441-4460]
The essence-nature tantra is awareness itself. Seeing awareness's dharmatā directly, one holds the continuum. Without instruction, not seen—transmitted through saṃsāra's rounds, hence called tantra. The flower-nature tantra: seeing the four lamps directly, that is rigpa.

—

[4441-4460]
The flower blooms when recognition dawns. Not seeing it, one wanders in actions and afflictions. The quintessence-nature tantra: the essence gathered, ripened, matured. Seeing wisdom's appearance, not destroyed in the three realms. This quintessence of indivisible space-awareness explained in the seventeen tantras.

—

[4461-4480]
From the Buddha Tantras' Continuation: the Buddhas' essence gathered, placed in all beings' hearts. The intestine-continuum, the life-thread, the essential vitality. The diligent ones know: all teachings' supreme essence is dharmatā's direct path.

—

[4461-4480]
From the Vajra-Sky-Equality Tantra: basis, essence, flower—the nature tantra of all Buddhas. Supreme secret distinguished, essence gathered. To saṃsāra's far shore like an arrow-shot person—swift, direct, certain.

—

[4481-4500]
From the Supreme Golden Light: basis, nature, methods. Relying on these, even to the Buddha-field—effortless, easy. The Pearl Garland teaches: nature-tantra is basis, essence, quintessence. Basis: essence, nature, compassion pervading all. Possessing three wisdoms, primordially pure, unique indivisibility.

—

[4481-4500]
The great secret of all Buddhas. Kāya: perfected essence-awareness. Kāya's tantra pervading emptiness. Clarity itself self-appearance. Non-appearance possessing clarity's nature. Perfected essence's nature-tantra.

—

[4501-4520]
All appearances are tantra—all interconnected, all the mandala of natural mind. Unproduced, perfected—great essence. Gathered: essence, life's breath of all. Explained as essence-tantra.

—

[4501-4520]
From the Blissful Secret Tantra: all Buddhas gathered into one, all essences extracted. Essence gathered, thus called essence. Gathered into empty-clear awareness's essence. Great Perfection's essence, renowned among tantras. Secret tantra explained, scripture of the definite ones.

—

[4521-4540]
Nature empty, all-pervading. Essence gathered: three clarities, three stabilities, three confidences, three non-returns. Obtain definiteness of unchanging essence. Three appearances, three emptinesses—essence pure nature, established as tantra.

—

[4521-4540]
Basis, path, result held definitively: nature-tantra. Explained, established. Natural descent: nature-itself tantra. From single basis-awareness nature: two tantras—indicated and indicating method. Basis and essence, three quintessences, five different names, one essential nature.

—

[4541-4560]
The distinction of single basis's essence: called method and nature tantra. Merely designations, appearing as distinctions. Essence single, empty nature, not different, no variation. A person with many names—however called, appears so, meaning unchanged.

—

[4541-4560]
The seventeen tantras: ocean-like Rigpa Rangshar, sun-like Vajrasattva Mirror, lion-power Dzogchen, mountain-king Letterless, wheel-like Auspicious Beauty, key-like Sudden Sound, sword-like Universal Goodness Mind-Mirror, bright lamp Blazing Lamp, gold-purity Jewel Spread, mother-child Sun-Moon Joining, mirror-like Introduction Adorning, pearl-garland Pearl Garland, snake-knot Self-Liberated Rigpa, great garuda View Tantra, river-like Perfect Self-Arisen, king's throne Blazing Body Relic, treasury Jewel Heap, razor-like Black Wrathful.

—

[4561-4580]
The eighteen wrathful ones protect the teachings. Sixteen arise from sudden sound's root. Twenty-seven refined lights taught: self-arisen, self-liberated, self-arisen essence, complete power, beautiful, pure, subtle arrangement, pearl garland, letterless, space, mind-mirror, sun-moon joined, introduction adorned, body-relic intermediate, jewel heap, blazing lamp, six great spaces.

—

[4581-4600]
Thus sixteen sequences, certainly arisen from sudden sound, appearing to disciples. Word tantras clearly divided in sequence. Ocean, sun, lion, mountain-king, wheel, key, razor, bright mirror, refined gold, mother-son connection, mirror, pearl string, snake-knot, great garuda, river, king, treasury.

—

[4581-4600]
Eleven purposes: three heart essences—knowing these three, like king ruling people, rules tantra's general meaning. Letterless shows tantra's upadeśa. Self-arisen holds view-meditation-conduct's basis. Self-liberated liberates that meaning. Three gathered, like ruling kingdom.

—

[4601-4620]
Three essences: Samantabhadra mind-mirror, Vajrasattva heart-mirror, Jewel Spread. Knowing these three, like reaching three mountains' peaks, seeing low valleys—knowing all tantra sections' inner meanings. Three flowers: Pearl Garland, Auspicious Beauty, Lion Power. Like three suns clearing world's darkness—understanding meaning and words without delusion.

—

[4621-4637]
One summary: Perfect Self-Arisen. Like fort's foundation well-laid, liberation's basis firm. Appearance depth complete: Introduction Adorning, like fort's peak unpenetrable—not fearing saṃsāra's place. Wisdom battle-turned: Sun-Moon Joining, turning intermediate delusion.

—

[4283-4303]
The distinction between cutting through and leaping over is not a hierarchy but a recognition of different capacities. The instant faculty sees directly; the gradual faculty needs supports. Both arrive at the same recognition, like two travelers reaching the same city by different routes.

—

[4304-4327]
The three keys are skillful means for those who need means. The body key stabilizes through posture. The door key opens through unmoving presence. The object key reveals through allowing appearances to dwell naturally. Together they unlock what was never locked.

—

[4328-4350]
The method tantra is the Clouds pass through sky—the shapes are not the space.; the nature tantra is the moon. The self-tantra is the recognition that finger and moon are not two. This is the supreme secret: there is nothing to achieve, nothing to become, nowhere to go.

—

[4351-4375]
The threefold classification—basis, essence, quintessence—is a way of speaking about what cannot be spoken. The basis is always pure, like the sky always clear behind clouds. The essence is the heart, the center, the core. The quintessence is the ripened recognition, the fruit fallen naturally from the tree.

—

[4376-4400]
The four lamps are not external lights but the natural luminosity of awareness. The lamp of the abiding ground, the lamp of the empty bindu, the lamp of the far-reaching lasso of water, the lamp of self-arisen wisdom. These illuminate the path that is not a path, show what was never hidden.

—

[4401-4420]
The guru's instruction is the spark that ignites recognition. It cannot be found in books, though books may describe it. It cannot be achieved through effort, though effort may prepare the ground. It is transmitted heart to heart, awareness to awareness, recognition to recognition.

—

[4421-4440]
The seventeen tantras are not seventeen separate teachings but seventeen aspects of the same recognition. Each emphasizes a different quality, uses different metaphors, speaks to different capacities. Yet all point to the same nature, all reveal the same truth, all lead to the same recognition.

—

[4441-4460]
The metaphors are not mere poetry. The ocean is the depth and vastness of awareness. The sun is its natural luminosity. The lion is its fearless power. the peaks of Minyak Gangkar king is its unchanging stability. Each metaphor opens a door to recognition for those ready to enter.

—

[4461-4480]
The three essences—Samantabhadra mirror, Vajrasattva mirror, Jewel Spread—are like three windows opening onto the same view. Each offers a different perspective, a different emphasis, yet all show the same vast expanse. To know one is to know all; to know all is to see they were never separate.

—

[4481-4500]
The quintessence is not the end of a process but the recognition of what has always been complete. Fruit ripening on a tree—it does not become what it was not; it reveals what it always was. The gathering of essence is the dissolving of separation between gatherer and gathered.

—

[4501-4520]
The self-arisen nature needs no creation. The self-liberated nature needs no freeing. The letterless nature cannot be captured in words. These three heart essences contain the whole teaching. To know them is to rule the kingdom of tantra, to master its meaning, to embody its realization.

—

[4521-4540]
The seventeen tantras are like seventeen rivers flowing into the same ocean. Each has its own source, its own course, its own character. Yet all reach the same destination, all dissolve into the same vastness. The practitioner who follows any one to its end finds the same recognition.

—

[4541-4560]
The distinction between method and nature tantra dissolves upon examination. The method is the nature's display; the nature is the method's basis. They are not two things meeting but one thing seen from different angles. Coin-like—heads or tails, it is the same coin.

—

[4561-4580]
The Pearl Garland's eleven purposes are eleven ways of describing the benefits of recognition. Each purpose addresses a different concern, a different fear, a different aspiration. Together they show how knowing these tantras transforms the practitioner, liberates the mind, fulfills the path.

—

[4581-4600]
The three flowers bloom when recognition dawns. Like the sun clearing darkness, they illuminate what was obscured. Not by adding light but by revealing that the darkness was itself luminous. The practitioner who knows these three no longer wanders in delusion about the tantras' meaning.

—

[4601-4620]
The fortress metaphor runs through the eleven purposes. Foundation, peak, windows, fences, throne, gates—these describe the structure of recognition. Built on emptiness, protected by view, the fortress of realization stands unassailable in the midst of saṃsāra's battles.

—

[4621-4637]
The weapon-like tantras protect by cutting through obstacles. Not by fighting but by revealing the emptiness of the fight. The black wrathful one is not angry but fiercely compassionate, cutting through the practitioner's self-deception with the sharp edge of recognition.

—

[4283-4303]
Between cutting through and leaping over, there is no contradiction. Both are skillful means for different minds. The instant faculty recognizes primordial freedom. The gradual faculty needs keys to unlock what was never locked. Both are expressions of the same wisdom, adapted to different capacities.

—

[4304-4327]
The three keys are supports for the gradual faculty, yet the instant faculty also benefits from understanding them. The body key reveals that posture is not mere physical arrangement but the embodiment of recognition. The door key shows that the senses can be portals to presence. The object key demonstrates that appearances are not obstacles but the very display of awareness.

—

[4328-4350]
Tantra as continuum: this is the essential meaning. Not a book, not a teaching, not a practice, but the continuous flow of awareness recognizing itself. The method tantra provides the method; the nature tantra reveals the nature; the self-tantra is the recognition of identity between method and nature, path and ground.

—

[4351-4375]
The threefold nature classification—basis, essence, quintessence—is not a hierarchy of value but a description of aspects. The basis is the ground, always pure, never stained. The essence is the heart, the vital core, that which makes alive. The quintessence is the gathered, ripened, matured recognition. All three are present simultaneously; the distinction is pedagogical, not ontological.

—

[4376-4400]
The four appearances on the path—appearance, increase, attainment, exhaustion—are not stages to be achieved but recognitions of what is always present. They appear naturally as recognition deepens, like the sky revealing itself more clearly as clouds disperse. The four lamps illuminate these appearances, showing them as they are.

—

[4401-4420]
The guru's instruction is indispensable because recognition cannot be achieved through one's own effort alone. The spark must come from outside, yet it ignites what is already present within. This is the mystery of transmission: something is given that was never absent, something is received that was always possessed.

—

[4421-4440]
The seventeen tantras form a complete mandala of teaching. Each tantra occupies a specific position, serves a specific function, addresses a specific capacity. Together they encompass all possible approaches to recognition. No practitioner is excluded; every mind finds its appropriate door.

—

[4441-4460]
The metaphors of the tantras—the ocean, sun, lion, mountain, wheel, key, sword, lamp, gold, pearl, mirror, snake, garuda, river, throne, treasury, razor—are not arbitrary. Each conveys specific qualities: vastness, luminosity, power, stability, turning, opening, cutting, illuminating, purity, preciousness, reflection, liberation, soaring, flow, sovereignty, wealth, sharpness. Together they paint a complete picture of the nature of mind.

—

[4461-4480]
The quintessence teachings are the distilled essence of the essence. If the basis is the ground and the essence is the heart, the quintessence is the very life-blood, the vital spark, the irreducible core. To taste this quintessence is to taste the nature of mind itself.

—

[4481-4500]
The Pearl Garland's verse on the threefold nature reveals the inner structure of Dzogchen teaching. Basis with its three qualities (essence, nature, compassion), essence with its threefold wisdom, quintessence with its indivisibility—these are not philosophical abstractions but direct descriptions of experience available to recognition.

—

[4501-4520]
The self-arisen, self-liberated, and letterless tantras form the heart of the heart. They contain the whole teaching in seed form. The self-arisen is the view, the self-liberated is the conduct, the letterless is the fruition. Yet these are not sequential—they are simultaneous aspects of recognition.

—

[4521-4540]
The sixteen main tantras and the single protector tantra make seventeen. The protector guards the teaching, not from outside but from within the recognition itself. The wrathful forms are not external deities but the fierce compassion of one's own awareness, cutting through self-deception.

—

[4541-4560]
The method tantra and nature tantra are ultimately indivisible. The method is the nature's skillful display; the nature is the method's essence. To practice the method without knowing the nature is to miss the point; to know the nature without practicing the method is to miss the opportunity. Both are necessary, both are one.

—

[4561-4580]
The eleven purposes of the tantras show how this teaching serves the practitioner at every stage. From establishing the foundation to protecting the result, each purpose addresses a specific need. Together they form a complete path from confusion to recognition.

—

[4581-4600]
The three flowers—Pearl Garland, Auspicious Beauty, Lion Power—illumine the meaning and words of the tantras. Like three suns, they dispel the darkness of delusion. Not gradually but instantaneously, not partially but completely, they reveal what was always present.

—

[4601-4620]
The fortress metaphor continues through the final purposes. From foundation to weapon, each aspect of the fortress corresponds to an aspect of recognition. Built on the unshakeable ground of emptiness, protected by the view, the fortress of realization stands as a refuge in the midst of saṃsāra's chaos.

—

[4621-4637]
The final purpose—the weapon-like tantra—protects by cutting. Not through aggression but through the sharpness of recognition. The black wrathful one stands at the gate, not to keep beings out but to keep obstacles from entering. This is the compassion of fierce wisdom, the protection of perfect recognition.

—

[4283-4637]
The entire section on the Dzogchen tantras presents a complete teaching. From the distinction between cutting through and leaping over, through the three keys and threefold nature, to the seventeen tantras and their eleven purposes, every aspect is covered. Yet all these elaborate presentations point to a single recognition: the nature of mind is primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated.

—

[4283-4637]
The tantras are not meant to be accumulated like possessions but realized like one's own face. The seventeen are one; the one is empty; the empty is luminous. This is the secret treasury of Dzogchen, the heart essence of all Buddhas, the natural Great Perfection.

—

[4283-4303]
The practitioner approaching these teachings for the first time may feel overwhelmed by the terminology—the three keys, the four lamps, the seventeen tantras, the eleven purposes. Yet all these elaborate presentations serve a single function: to guide recognition. A detailed map of a territory one has never visited—the map is useful but not the territory itself.

—

[4304-4327]
The three keys work together synergistically. The body key establishes the physical foundation for recognition. The door key opens the sensory gates to direct perception. The object key reveals that what is perceived is none other than awareness itself. Together they form a complete approach for those who benefit from structured practice.

—

[4328-4350]
The distinction between instant and gradual faculties is itself a skillful means. In truth, there are no faculties—only recognition and non-recognition. The instant faculty is simply recognition happening now. The gradual faculty is recognition veiled by the belief in time. Both arrive at the same place because there is nowhere to go.

—

[4351-4375]
The basis nature's tantra reveals that delusion has no substantial existence. Dream-like, it seems real until waking—saṃsāra appears until recognition dawns. The dream was never real; the waking was never absent. This is the profound simplicity that the elaborate teachings point toward.

—

[4376-4400]
The essence nature's tantra is the heart of hearts. The threefold primordial wisdom stacked in the center is not a spatial arrangement but a description of awareness's qualities: empty in essence, cognizant in nature, compassionate in manifestation. These three are indivisible, like a gold coin that is simultaneously round, valuable, and metallic.

—

[4401-4420]
The quintessence nature's tantra brings the teaching to its culmination. The ripened fruit contains all that the tree was, yet it is concentrated, accessible, immediate. The quintessence is not better than the basis or essence—it is the same nature recognized fully, completely, without remainder.

—

[4421-4440]
The seventeen tantras are like seventeen different languages describing the same landscape. One person may respond to the ocean metaphor, another to the lion, another to the mirror. The diversity of teachings ensures that every type of mind finds its entry point into recognition.

—

[4441-4460]
The guru's instruction functions like a spark in dry tinder. The tinder must be present—the practitioner must have prepared through study and reflection—but the spark comes from outside. When conditions meet, recognition flares. This is the magic of transmission that cannot be manufactured or forced.

—

[4461-4480]
The metaphors of the tantras reveal the nature of mind through familiarity. We know the ocean is vast, the sun is bright, the lion is fearless. By associating these known qualities with the unknown nature of mind, the teachings make the abstract concrete, the distant near, the difficult accessible.

—

[4481-4500]
The Pearl Garland's classification of the tantras into heart essences, essences, and flowers is a teaching on pedagogy. Some teachings go directly to the heart. Others elaborate the essential meaning. Others unfold like blossoms, revealing beauty and fragrance gradually. All serve the same purpose.

—

[4501-4520]
The self-arisen, self-liberated, and letterless tantras form a triad that encompasses view, meditation, and result. The self-arisen is the view: awareness naturally present. The self-liberated is the meditation: whatever arises freed in its own place. The letterless is the result: beyond words, beyond description, the nature as it is.

—

[4521-4540]
The method and nature tantras are the two wings of the bird of recognition. With only one wing, the bird cannot fly. With both, it soars. The method provides the structure; the nature provides the content. Together they carry the practitioner to the destination that is no destination.

—

[4541-4560]
The eleven purposes are like eleven different medicines for eleven different illnesses. Some practitioners need fortification; they receive the foundation teachings. Others need courage; they receive the peak teachings. Others need protection; they receive the weapon teachings. The treasury offers what each needs.

—

[4561-4580]
The three flowers—Pearl Garland, Auspicious Beauty, Lion Power—represent three aspects of the teaching's function. The Pearl Garland strings the teachings together coherently. The Auspicious Beauty reveals the teaching's attractiveness and benefit. The Lion Power demonstrates the teaching's ability to overcome all obstacles.

—

[4581-4600]
The fortress metaphor extends through all eleven purposes, creating a comprehensive image of the path. The foundation is view; the peak is realization; the windows are wisdom; the fences are protection; the throne is sovereignty; the gates are entry points. Together they form an impenetrable stronghold of recognition.

—

[4601-4620]
The final purpose—the weapon-like tantra—reveals that the ultimate protection is not defensive but transformative. The black wrathful one does not defend against external enemies because there are no external enemies. All enemies are self-deception, and the weapon cuts through self-deception with the sharpness of recognition.

—

[4621-4637]
The conclusion of this section on the Dzogchen tantras brings the practitioner to the threshold of practice. All the theoretical understanding, all the elaborate classifications, all the detailed descriptions serve one purpose: to prepare the mind for direct recognition. The teachings are complete; now the recognition must occur.

—

[4283-4637]
Reading through this entire section, one sees the architecture of Dzogchen teaching. It begins with the distinction between cutting through and leaping over, establishes the three keys for gradual practitioners, presents the threefold nature classification, details the seventeen tantras and their purposes, and culminates in the recognition that all of this Focusing on breath, attention drifts. The drift shows what remains focused. one's own mind. The architecture is elaborate, but what it houses is simple: the nature of mind is primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated.

—

[4283-4637]
The tantras are not meant to be worshipped or accumulated but realized. Each verse, each metaphor, each classification is a Your voice echoes through Kyirong, Sertar, and the Golok grasslands—the echo is not your voice. of awareness. The finger is not the moon; the classification is not the nature; the teaching is not the realization. Yet without the finger, the moon might not be seen. Without the teaching, the nature might not be recognized. The treasury provides the finger; the practitioner must see the moon.

—

[4283-4637]
This completes the presentation of the Dzogchen tantras. May all who encounter these teachings recognize their own nature.
