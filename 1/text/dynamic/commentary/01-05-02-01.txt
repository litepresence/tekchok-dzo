Cutting through the basis: the instant faculty recognizes what has always been free. No basis to cut, no cutter, no cutting—yet the basis is cut. The gradual faculty requires keys: body posture like the lion, elephant, sage; door unmoved; object purified. These are supports for those who need support, White against blue, changing constantly. The change A mirror shows your face—the glass is not the person. stillness. at a moon that was never absent.

The entire section on the Dzogchen tantras presents a complete teaching. From the distinction between cutting through and leaping over, through the three keys and threefold nature, to the seventeen tantras and their eleven purposes, every aspect is covered. Yet all these elaborate presentations point to a single recognition: the nature of mind is primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated.

—

[22-25]
First: cutting through. Recognition happens instantaneously—sword-like, severing without touching. Primordially liberated means never bound, so liberation is not an achievement but a remembering. Without basis again—no ground to stand on, no foundation to build. This freedom is not earned; it is discovered.

—

[26-42]
Second: leaping over. For gradual faculties, the keys unlock what was never locked. Body key: the postures stabilize awareness. Door key: the senses remain unmoved like the sky. Object key: appearances dwell in their own place. Wind and awareness merge; the four appearances measure the pathless path.

—

[43-66]
The body's three postures: lion for dignity, elephant for stability, sage for ease. Each supports the recognition of what requires no support. The door remains unmoved—not frozen but naturally still, like the sky that accommodates all weather without moving. The objects of perception dwell in their own nature, neither rejected nor grasped.

—

[67-90]
Mind changeless, self-abiding. This is not a state to achieve but the nature of mind itself. Memory clear—recognition vivid. The three bodies arise naturally when awareness slackens from its grip on experience. Five bodies arise when conditions cease—like clouds parting to reveal the sun that was always shining.

—

[91-113]
The method tantra shows the path to those who need a path. The nature tantra reveals the ground that was never departed from. The self-tantra is the recognition that the one seeking is the sought. Unproduced and perfected—nothing to create, nothing to complete.

—

[114-136]
Dwelling in the stream: tantra is not a text but the continuum of awareness, the flow of recognition. Basis, path, and fruition are not sequential but simultaneous aspects of the same nature. Determined holding: once recognized, never lost. This is the nature tantra's gift.

—

[137-161]
Threefold nature: basis, essence, quintessence. The basis is primordially pure—ka-dag awareness, essence, compassion. Never stained, never improved. The essence is the heart-essence, the threefold primordial wisdom stacked in the center. The quintessence is the ripened fruit, the gathered essence of practice.

—

[162-176]
The basis nature's tantra: delusion never existed, only imputed. Like mistaking a rope for a snake—the snake was never there. Awareness light-clear, naturally luminous. Compassion all-pervading, manifesting as all phenomena. Whatever arises, whether called saṃsāra or nirvāṇa, dwells in the expanse of this recognition.

—

[177-193]
The essence nature's tantra: the four lamps arise from the basis, the four appearances seen on the path. These are not external lights but the natural luminosity of awareness. The eye of wisdom sees what was always present. The path is not traveled but recognized as the ground itself.

—

[194-211]
The quintessence: essence empty, free from marks. Not permanent, not annihilated. Self-appearance arising naturally, not cut off. Empty-clear indivisible—this is the gathered essence, the ripened fruit. The three emptinesses: delusion empty, conceptual stains empty, elemental conditions empty. All empty of inherent existence, full of luminous presence.

—

[212-229]
Three clear aspects: outer realms appear, awareness appears as kāya, sky and awareness indivisible. Three stabilities: faith in the view, nose-held in the realm, decision that delusion has ceased. Three non-returns: saṃsāra known as primordial Buddha, delusion falls into pure appearance, realization's confidence gained.

—

[230-249]
Three appearances: dimension without day or night, awareness without waxing or waning, dharmatā without transformation. Three emptinesses: awareness without comparison, mind without conditions, light without movement. These are not achievements but recognitions of what has always been the case.

—

[250-269]
Thus liberated: delusion's appearances self-pure, no cause for saṃsāra. The pure appearance self-arisen, saṃsāra's conditions cease of themselves. Even in offering, dharmatā's appearance is decided in the intermediate state—saṃsāra's result dissolves naturally.

—

[270-289]
The method tantra indicates; the nature tantra is what is indicated. Without basis-awareness, no Buddhas, no sentient beings. The two who hold tantras—Buddha's tantra through realization, sentient beings' tantra through non-realization—both arise from the same basis.

—

[290-309]
The guru's instruction is the bridge. Without it, the meaning is not realized. With it, realization dawns naturally. The method transmitted one-to-one, heart to heart, awareness to awareness. This is the secret lineage, the ear-whispered teaching, the direct introduction.

—

[310-329]
The essence-nature tantra is awareness itself. Seeing awareness's dharmatā directly, one holds the continuum. Without instruction, not seen—transmitted through saṃsāra's rounds, hence called tantra. The flower-nature tantra: seeing the four lamps directly, that is rigpa.

—

[330-349]
The flower blooms when recognition dawns. Not seeing it, one wanders in actions and afflictions. The quintessence-nature tantra: the essence gathered, ripened, matured. Seeing wisdom's appearance, not destroyed in the three realms. This quintessence of indivisible space-awareness explained in the seventeen tantras.

—

[332-356]
The threefold classification—basis, essence, quintessence—is a way of speaking about what cannot be spoken. The basis is always pure, like the sky always clear behind clouds. The essence is the heart, the center, the core. The quintessence is the ripened recognition, the fruit fallen naturally from the tree.

—

[333-356]
The three keys are skillful means for those who need means. The body key stabilizes through posture. The door key opens through unmoving presence. The object key reveals through allowing appearances to dwell naturally. Together they unlock what was never locked.

—

[334-356]
The method tantra is the Clouds pass through sky—the shapes are not the space.; the nature tantra is the moon. The self-tantra is the recognition that finger and moon are not two. This is the supreme secret: there is nothing to achieve, nothing to become, nowhere to go.

—

[336-356]
The distinction between cutting through and leaping over is not a hierarchy but a recognition of different capacities. The instant faculty sees directly; the gradual faculty needs supports. Both arrive at the same recognition, like two travelers reaching the same city by different routes.

—

[337-356]
From the Buddha Tantras' Continuation: the Buddhas' essence gathered, placed in all beings' hearts. The intestine-continuum, the life-thread, the essential vitality. The diligent ones know: all teachings' supreme essence is dharmatā's direct path.

—

[340-356]
One summary: Perfect Self-Arisen. Like fort's foundation well-laid, liberation's basis firm. Appearance depth complete: Introduction Adorning, like fort's peak unpenetrable—not fearing saṃsāra's place. Wisdom battle-turned: Sun-Moon Joining, turning intermediate delusion.
