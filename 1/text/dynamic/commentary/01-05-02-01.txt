First: cutting through the basis. Instant faculties primordially liberated, without basis again. Second: path of leaping over, gradual faculties, relying on channels and winds key, making liberation. Three preliminaries bringing to natural place. Body key, door key, object key. Wind and awareness key, taking experience to four appearances' measure.

[4304-4327]
Therefore. Thus. Body's key: lion's manner, elephant's manner, like a rishi. Door unmoved, clarifying two unmoved, sky itself unmoved. Object's key: pure expanse dwelling, awareness's nature dwelling, all appearances dwelling. Mind changeless self-abiding, memory clear. Awareness unchanging, three bodies clear. Mind slow—memory stream ceases. Body speech slack, free from suffering. Awareness slack, five bodies arise. Awareness arisen, conditions cease. Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease.

[4328-4350]
Thus indicated method's tantra. Self's tantra, unproduced perfected. Indicating method. Dwelling in stream, called tantra. Second: nature's tantra. Meaning of basis, path, fruition. From that same tantra: Basis, path, fruition determined holding, nature's tantra. Essence: empty-clear awareness's essence, basis path fruition gathered. Definite term pervades all, accomplishing Buddha-nature.

[4351-4375]
Divided: basis, essence, quintessence—three. Basis nature's tantra: first ka-dag awareness, nature, compassion. Essence primordially pure, non-awareness's name non-existent. Delusion imputed only, not experienced. Nature spontaneously accomplished, awareness light-clear. Compassion all-pervading, manifesting unceasing. Whatever arises, dwelling in expanse.

[4376-4382]
Essence nature's tantra: primordial wisdom three-stacked, heart-essence manner arisen. Basis nature's tantra that power, basis appearance eye, four lamps arisen. Path's four appearances actually seen. Quintessence nature's tantra: awareness's appearance, taking experience, fruition ripened. Essence empty, marks awareness non-gone. Permanent extreme-grasping non-existent, substantial entity non-established. Empty self-appearance arisen, cut cut-off non-existent. Empty-clear indivisible—that awareness's quintessence.

[4383-4400]
Three emptinesses: awareness without comparison—delusion emptied. Mind without conditions—conceptual stains emptied. Light without coming-and-going—elements' conditions emptied.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Three appearances: dimension without day-night, awareness without clear-dimming, dharmata without transformation.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Three non-returns: samsara primordially Buddha—no return. Awareness kāya manifest—delusion falls into pure appearance, no return. Dharmata manifold—realization's confidence gained, no return.

[4401-4420]
An old practitioner once tried to read all seventeen tantras in one winter. He studied the Rigpa Rangshar, the Samantabhadra mirror, the lion's power tantra. He understood the words but missed the meaning. The tantras are not books to be read—they are awareness to be recognized. The method tantra shows the path. The nature tantra reveals what is. The quintessence tantra IS what is.

[4421-4440]
See what is. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[4441-4460]
Thus. We proceed. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[4461-4480]
This old fool has studied these tantras for years. He has memorized the classifications. He has recited the texts. Now he sees: the tantra is not in the words.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was. The tantra is the awareness that reads. The seventeen are one. The one is zero. The zero is YOUR face before your parents were born.

[4481-4500]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what binds The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness. The nature is complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[4501-4520]
Between the method tantra and the nature (rang bzhin) tantra, there is no separation. Like a water mill grinding grain—the wheel turns outside, the grinding happens inside. Is the method outside or inside? The question dissolves in recognition. The practitioner who recognizes this stops asking where path ends and fruit begins.

[4521-4540]
The seventeen tantras are like seventeen tools in a craftsman's belt. Each has its purpose. Each has its use. But the craftsman is not the tools.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. The recognition is not the tantra. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the tantras themselves.

[4541-4560]
Look. It is here.
 The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
