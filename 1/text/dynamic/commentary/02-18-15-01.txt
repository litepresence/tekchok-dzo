[5685-5692]
Listen, dear practitioner! Through that returning, outward delusion-vision ceases, inward body and mind warmth arises. Two palms' ends pressed to earth, moving action wind returns. Through that returning, outward thigle and thigle-particles dawn, inward day-night without experience arises. Chin mind slightly raised, grasping action wind returns. Through that returning, outward body's vision sees, inward wind's movement exhausts!

Emaho! Reversing the winds through body postures!

Dear practitioner, gaze without moving - this is the key! Emaho!

[5745-5746]
Listen, dear practitioner! Through cutting the word's reversal, the word self-arisen wisdom dawns! Through blocking merely one's own speech, dharmas all abide in the inexpressible state—certain!

[5747-5752]
Third, mind's three unmoving: Through not separating from focused stiffness, always abiding in Buddha's intent. Through entering awareness dharmadhatu's scope, not straying from entity's nature. Through always not separating from that itself, four visions measure arrived—certain! Also, moving by moving-turned returning is called—key point of liberating from those!

[5753-5761]
Second, taking measure of three abidings: Three body's abidings free from action. Three wind's abidings taking measure of non-production. Three appearance's abidings confidence in non-reversal. First three: Abiding without dwelling in action, samsara's delusion cannot increase. Abiding in projecting and gathering limbs, delusion's wheel continuity ceases. Placing action in the ground (gzhi), certain separation from accumulated action's ripening.

[5762-5764]
Second three: Wind not going outward abiding, conditioned appearances various—no harm. Inward not blinking abiding, no support for various conceptual thought. Without going-coming outside-inside abiding, basis of holding samsara-nirvana as two—empty.

Do you see? Not moving is the key! When you stop chasing, wisdom dawns. When you stop blinking, concepts have no place to land. This is not doing something new—this is stopping the doing!

Emaho! Three unmoving, three abiding—liberation without moving!

[5774-5777]
Listen, dear practitioner! Four empowerments' fruit arising as direct becoming! At dharmata direct perception time, body like tortoise-shell vessel put in—body's channels slowly abiding arising. That is Dzogchen meaning, effort-free, body's limbs entered!

Pot empowerment's action purified, elaborate wisdom self-arisen certainly arises! At increase-above time, body like person tormented by disease gone—channels, central wind entered arising! Dzogchen negate-assert not-existing meaning generally entered, secret empowerment's action purified, non-elaborate wisdom self-arisen arises!

[5784-5788]
At measure-arrived time, body like elephant sinking in mud—mind channels wind obtained arising! Dzogchen accept-reject not-existing meaning heart entered, prajna wisdom empowerment body purified arising—extremely non-elaborate wisdom self-arisen arises!

Do you see? Each empowerment purifies deeper! Body like tortoise-shell, like diseased person, like sinking elephant—all pointing to wisdom self-arisen!

Emaho! Four empowerments' wisdom self-arisen!

[5802-5804]
Listen! From the pure arising of Dzogchen speech's own face—Dzogchen speech certainly liberated, entered into the resonance of purity, meaning free from elaboration inwardly decided!

[5805-5808]
Speech like a small-pot child emerging from between rocks—like gone! From prajna wisdom's empowerment, compassion gathered, arising! Dzogchen, beyond speech and thought, entered as the controller of speech's meaning, extremely elaborate-free word—grasping's extreme cut!

[5809-5811]
Speech arising like cliff forms—from channel-abiding letters entered into wind's bindu, arising! Dzogchen inexpressible meaning entered into speech's sound!

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Dear practitioner, do you see? Your speech is not ordinary chatter—it is the spontaneous display of wisdom! When you speak from recognition, every word liberates. When you rest in the nature (rang bzhin) of speech itself, elaboration ceases. Do not try to make your speech special—recognize its natural purity, and it becomes vajra speech!

Emaho! Speech liberation through Dzogchen words!

[5830-5833]
Listen, dear practitioner! Extremely elaborate all near ceased, not-existing—empowerment! This also example faith, meaning's certainty! Also body's base is four elements' binding, liberating-released arising. Now elements self-nature return not-possible—main point!

[5834-5838]
Speech's four: express-basis, express-condition, express-object, express-agent—four bindings liberated from. The nature is complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. Now word self-nature say not-possible!

[5839-5844]
Mind's four: mindfulness, no-mindfulness, unborn, intellect-transcended—four bindings liberated from. Recognition is immediate.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was. Now think naturally not-established!

[5858-5872]
Thus empowerment four as example, faith by meaning thig-decided. Meaning: body, speech, mind, all dharmas, wind-mind-elaborate-free sphere, luminosity clear gathered!

Do you see? Body cannot be bound by elements! Speech cannot be captured by words! Mind cannot be held by thoughts! You are already empowered!

Emaho! Four empowerments—already complete!

[5873-5880]
Listen, fortunate practitioner! Having heard the Buddha's qualities, do not obtain hope and thrill—the three self-established bodies, complete confidence! Having heard also of action and afflictions' cause and effect, do not fall into delusion-vision samsara fear—confidence beyond cause and effect!

[5881-5885]
Having seen nirvana's own place, do not thrill with hope of liberation—primordial purity self-complete, strong place obtained, confidence! Four arising!

[5886-5889]
From the Jewel Heap Tantra: "Four great confidences of unchanging view, non-returning wisdom measure also taken!" Thus aside from the four extreme reliances, sixteen visions conclude!

Dear practitioner, these four confidences are your own mind's nature! Do not seek them outside. Do not hope for them in the future. They are complete right now, primordially present. The three kayas are not somewhere else—they are your own body, speech, and mind when recognized. Rest in this confidence!

Emaho! Four great confidences—recognize them now!

[5907-5910]
Listen here! From Self-Arisen: "Ground called does not exist elsewhere!

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[02-18-15-01] EXTENDED COMMENTARY - Multi-Voice Presentation
============================================================

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle presents these teachings with utmost clarity. The Great Perfection transcends all philosophical extremes while embracing all phenomena as its display.

This old vagabond has practiced these teachings for decades. What I've learned: the path is not about accumulating knowledge but recognizing what has always been present.

Three words pointing to the essence: recognize your own nature, liberate the grasping mind, rest in natural perfection.

From Lotus-Born: these secret instructions are the heart-essence of all Buddhas. Practice them with devotion and recognition is certain.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! See what was never obscured! Liberation is immediate!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation integrates ground, path, and result into a coherent framework for recognition.

The integration of all aspects reveals their non-dual nature. What appears separate is one awareness displaying.

The essence beyond all words: awareness knowing itself. Not achieved, not transformed, always complete.

Every teaching a book, every book pointing to awareness.

Translating the untranslatable. Pointing to what words cannot reach.

I reveal what was never hidden. Recognition is now.

Fierce compassion cuts through all obstacles!

Vajra indestructibility of recognition itself.

[02-18-15-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
