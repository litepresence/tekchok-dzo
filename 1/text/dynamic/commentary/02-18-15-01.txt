[5646-5652]
Two heels pressed together—method and wisdom releasing their essence. Soles pressing earth, wind's holding and releasing empties itself, wisdom's heat descending through the body. This is not gymnastics; it is the architecture of awakening, using form to unlock what is beyond form.

[5653-5665]
Second, rest-wisdom key point: when thoughts spread and bliss has not yet arisen, do thus. Knees pressed to stomach, hunched sitting—spreading wind of karma reverses. Reversed, outer forms appear variously while inner mind abides in stillness. Soles pressing earth, life-holding karma wind reverses. Body heat arises without; non-arising Dharmata experience arises within.

[5666-5680]
These crucial points are: body key point channels, channel key point winds, wind key point mind. Three nested secrets, three dependencies. The body position opens the channels; open channels direct the winds; directed winds settle the mind. Not one causing the next, but three aspects of one unfolding.

[5681-5700]
Sambhogakaya posture explanation: called "great elephant" from power and vehicle great aspect. Body key point raises exceptional wisdom. Lie on the side like a lion, three realms suppressed. Knees to stomach joins confusion and wisdom as base. Big toes extended outward creates movement, harming karma's wind. Hand's knuckles pressed to earth supports Dharmakaya's direct appearance.

[5701-5720]
Rest-wisdom in Sambhogakaya: chin pressed suppresses three gates' grasping existence. Four limbs earth-placed, big toes inward pressed, thoughts' karma wind reverses. Reversed, outer delusion appearances cease; inner body-mind heat arises. Palm centers earth-pressed, moving karma wind reverses. Outer thigle and thigle-parts appear; inner day-night-free experience arises.

[5721-5740]
Dharmakaya posture: called "lion's three powers complete"—fearless toward any. Body key point dispels three realms' fears. Like a lion, complete in method, wisdom, and power. Body crouched like a dog brings expanse and awareness together. Soles pressing earth stops various thoughts. Finger joints bent, feet inward placed—karma and affliction's movements empty.

[5741-5760]
Rest-wisdom Dharmakaya: soles earth-placed, knees slightly outward, crouched like a dog—pervading karma wind reverses. Reversed, outer pure wisdom vision appears; inner affliction stream cuts. Palm centers inward placed stops grasping wind. Stopped, outer wisdom vision seen; inner grasping subject thought stream ceases.

[5761-5780]
Thus the three kayas' postures: Dharmakaya's pressing completes Buddha's knowledge in this very awareness. Sambhogakaya's pressing reveals three Buddha fields in this very awareness. Nirmanakaya's pressing accomplishes beings' benefit without obstruction in this very awareness. Three perspectives on one recognition.

[5781-5800]
This old fool tried every posture—lotus, lion, elephant, dog. Each brought something, missed something. Finally he understood: the posture does not create the recognition; it supports what is already present. Like a chair supports the body, posture supports the view. Without the view, posture is exercise. With the view, posture is liberation.

[5801-5850]
Three unmoving gazes for appearance-making: door itself unmoving. Nirmanakaya gaze—wisdom compassion's appearance enjoyed. Eye's relaxation supported, samadhi separation impossible. Mind slightly lowered holds view free of emptiness concept. These are not techniques to master but natural expressions of recognition.

[5851-5900]
See. The body is not obstacle to awakening but its vehicle. These positions are not forced contortions but natural expressions of the mind's own state. When mind is clear, body finds its own wisdom posture. When mind is confused, these postures help redirect the winds that scatter attention.

[5901-5950]
Therefore. The crucial points of body, channel, and wind are taught not to create dependency but to exhaust it. Use these methods until they are seen through. Then even lying in the gutter is Dharmakaya posture, even stumbling drunk is lion's walk. Methods are raft, not destination.

[5951-6000]
Between the systematic precision of posture instructions and the vast freedom they reveal, we find the middle way of practice. Not loose, not rigid. Not forced, not lazy. The body held in wisdom posture while the mind rests in natural flow. Channel open, wind gentle, mind clear.

[6001-6050]
Mountain hermit sat like a dog in his cave for twelve years. When asked why, he said: "The posture taught me what words could not. My body became the teaching, my breath the commentary. Now I cannot separate practice from life—they are one continuous gesture."

[6051-6100]
Final instruction: do not make these postures into another achievement. Do not collect them like badges. Find the one or two that resonate, practice deeply, then forget them. The lion who knows he is lion has already fallen from pride. The yogi who knows they practice has already missed the point.

[6101-6150]
Emaho! The wonder of body as path, posture as teaching, movement as meditation. What need to seek elsewhere? This very body, in any position, is the field of enlightenment. Recognize this, and every step is lion's stride, every rest is Dharmakaya's ease. The Vajra Essence reveals itself through form, leading beyond form to formless recognition.
