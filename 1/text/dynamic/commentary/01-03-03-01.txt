[1751-1760]
Detailed analysis. Not for entertainment. For liberation. Form aggregate. The body. The world. All that appears "out there." But where does it appear? This is the question that matters.

[1752-1760]
A yogi once sat in a cave for three years analyzing form. He became an expert. He could describe the physics of perception. He could explain optical illusions. On the day he left the cave, he saw a wildflower and wept. All his analysis had not touched the flower's reality. He returned to the cave. This time he did not analyze. He recognized.

[1761-1780]
The form aggregate arises from elements. Elements arise from mind. Mind arises from. stop. Do not chase the chain backward forever. Recognize the arising itself. The one who chases and the chain being chased—where do they arise? Rest in that question until it dissolves you.

[1765-1770]
Feeling aggregate in detail. Pleasant feeling—attachment arises. Unpleasant feeling—aversion arises. Neutral feeling—ignorance arises. Three poisons. Three doors. But also: three opportunities. When pleasant feeling arises, recognize it as empty. Liberated as attachment. This is Dzogchen.

[1771-1780]
Not through gradual effort. Not through gradual effort. The feeling arises and liberates in the same moment. Like a bird flying through the sky—no trace. Like writing on water—no mark. This is not metaphor. This is direct instruction.

[1781-1800]
Perception aggregate. The six perceptions. Eye perception of form. Ear perception of sound.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Nose perception of smell. Tongue perception of taste.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Body perception of touch. Mind perception of phenomena. Six gates. One threshold. What perceives through all six?

[1785-1790]
This practitioner once tried to unify the six perceptions. He practiced for years. Finally he laughed. There was never six. There was never one. The number itself was conceptual proliferation. The practice was the obstacle.

[1791-1800]
Between the perception and the perceived, contact occurs. This is the moment of samsara.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. This is also the moment of liberation. The contact itself is empty.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. The one who contacts is empty. What remains? Vast awareness. Natural clarity. Your own face before your parents were born.

[1801-1830]
Formations aggregate. Fifty-one mental factors. Abhidharma lists them precisely. Cetasikas. This is scholarly material. Useful for clearing confusion. But do not become a scholar of formations. Become free of formations. The list itself is formation. The study is formation. The liberation from formation is also formation. See through the whole game.

[1810-1820]
Volition. Intention. Attention. Concentration. Energy. Faith. Mindfulness. All formations. All empty. All self-liberated. This is not nihilism. This is recognition. The formations continue to function. Liberation does not mean stopping. It means no longer being bound.

[1821-1830]
Consciousness aggregate. Eight consciousnesses. The five sense consciousnesses. The mind consciousness. The afflicted consciousness. The all-ground consciousness. Vast topic. Endless analysis possible. But where is the analyzer?

[1831-1850]
The all-ground is not something to be destroyed. It is rigpa's own nature when unrecognized. Do not make it an enemy. Recognize it. The storehouse of all tendencies. The latency of all karma. When recognized, it is the display of wisdom. Same basis. Different recognition.

[1835-1845]
This practitioner spent years trying to purify the all-ground (kun gzhi). He practiced purification mantras. He did confession. He accumulated merit. All good. All necessary on the path. But the final recognition: the all-ground (kun gzhi) was never impure. The purification itself was all-ground's play.

[1846-1850]
Recognition is immediate. See through the entire analysis. The aggregates are not something to be understood. They are something to be recognized. Form is empty. Feeling is empty.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Perception is empty. Formations are empty. Consciousness is empty. The one who sees this emptiness is also empty. Rest in that emptiness. This is the Treasury's heart.

[1851-1901]
Between the systematic analysis of the Abhidharma and the stark pointing of direct recognition, Longchenpa weaves the middle way. Not rejecting the aggregates. Not grasping their analysis. The ocean remains whether waves are counted or not. Rest in that recognition. The aggregates neither bind nor liberate. Recognition is liberation.

[1890-1901]
This old man once.
 Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.
