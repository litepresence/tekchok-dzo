Twenty-one conducts. Twenty-one ways to transcend fixation. Twenty-one skillful
means to cut through the net of conceptual mind. This is not a menu to choose
from—each practitioner finds the conduct that cuts their particular pattern of
grasping.

Bee-like conduct: enjoying all dharmas' taste without preference, like a bee
moving from flower to flower. Not getting stuck on any single experience, not
rejecting any appearance. Every phenomenon offers nectar when recognized.

Deer-like conduct: abandoning delusion's conditioned objects, dwelling alone
where people don't go. The deer is sensitive, alert, aware of danger. The
practitioner stays away from samsara's busyness, not from aversion but from
recognizing what deep practice requires.

Mute-like conduct: abandoning various delusion speech, not speaking with
anyone. Silence cuts the constant chatter that maintains ego. In silence, the
mind settles. In silence, recognition deepens. This is not repression—it is
liberation from the need to validate existence through words.

Peacock-like conduct: cutting secret mantra doubt, transforming poison into
beauty. The peacock eats poisonous snakes and transforms them into brilliant
plumage. The practitioner takes afflictions as path—anger becomes mirror-like
wisdom, desire becomes discriminating wisdom. But this requires stable
recognition. Without it, eating poison just makes you sick.

Madman-like conduct: abandoning dwelling on single objects, arising
spontaneously without social convention. Body, speech.
mind's conduct
without attachment, like a madman. This is dangerous territory—advanced
practice for those with stable realization. Without stability, you're just crazy,
not a realized yogi.

Lion-like conduct: going to charnel-grounds, abandoning fear mind. The lion
fears no corpse, no death, no decay. The practitioner goes where others fear,
confronting impermanence directly. Fear is the mind's last fortress. The lion
demolishes it.

Dog and pig-like conduct: abandoning pure and impure thoughts, enjoying
whatever comes without discrimination. Dogs eat garbage. Pigs wallow in mud.
They don't judge. The practitioner transcends human obsessions with
cleanliness, accepting whatever conditions arise. Simple food, simple clothes—
no preferences, no complaints.

Cloud-like conduct: experiencing memory and thought instantly, letting them
pass like clouds in sky. Not holding, not rejecting. Thoughts arise, thoughts
dissolve. The sky of awareness remains unchanged. This is not suppression—it
is natural flow.

Child-like conduct: abandoning long delusion clinging, approaching experience
with fresh eyes. A child sees without concepts, meets each moment as new. The
practitioner drops accumulated interpretations, experiencing directly what is.

Echo-like conduct: guiding the world according to words, responding to beings'
calls like an echo responds to sound. No self, no agenda—just natural
resonance. When called, answer. When not called, rest.

Elephant-like conduct: turning the depth of samsara's battles, powerful and
unstoppable. The elephant walks through obstacles without hesitation. The
practitioner meets samsara's challenges with strength, transforming battles into
path.

Tortoise-like conduct: deciding desire's content in time, withdrawing when
necessary. The tortoise pulls into its shell, conserving energy, waiting for right
moment. The practitioner knows when to engage, when to retreat—not from
cowardice but from wisdom.

Bear-like conduct: not spreading samsara's seed, hibernating in deep practice.
The bear sleeps through winter, not engaging with the world's busyness. The
practitioner sometimes withdraws completely, not seeing anyone, not teaching,
not involved—just practicing.

Brahmin-like conduct: abandoning enjoying others' food, self-sufficient and
independent. Not depending on others' offerings, not cultivating patrons, not
seeking support. Complete self-reliance in practice and livelihood.

Heroine-like conduct: dividing samsara-nirvana boundary, fearlessly going
where others won't. The heroine is fierce, uncompromising, cutting through
delusion without hesitation. This is wrathful compassion in action.

Water-letter-like conduct: placing memory support in self-place, letting
impressions dissolve like writing on water. Nothing sticks, nothing accumulates.
Each moment fresh, each experience immediately released.

Sky-dagger conduct: completely using phenomena, cutting through with direct
perception. The sky-dagger (phurba) nails demons to the ground of recognition.
Every appearance is used, nothing is rejected, everything is transformed.

Mid-air wind-like conduct: abandoning grasping and holding thoughts, moving
without obstruction like wind. No fixed position, no permanent residence,
nowhere to grasp, nothing to hold.

Garuda-like conduct: cutting abyss waves, soaring above obstacles. The
garuda hatches fully grown, flying immediately. The practitioner recognizes
without stages, cutting through depths of confusion in a single stroke.

Mountain-like conduct: above using unchanging self-pure, stable and
immovable. Whatever weather comes—sun, rain, storm—the mountain
remains. The practitioner's recognition is equally stable, unaffected by
circumstance.

Thunder-like conduct: using appearance outward without turning, powerful and
sudden. Thunder cracks without warning, shaking everything. The practitioner's
activity can be sudden, shocking, breaking through rigid patterns.

Between these twenty-one conducts and the recognition that transcends all
conduct, we find the vast middle way. Not rejecting conduct, not grasping it.
The conducts are medicine for specific diseases. When the disease is cured,
stop taking medicine.

Someone I knew tried every conduct. He was bee-like, then deer-like, then mute,
then peacock. He thought more conducts meant more progress. Finally he
understood: the conduct is not the point. Recognition is the point. The conduct
only serves recognition.

Three wisdoms cut through three superimpositions: hearing cuts outer,
contemplation cuts inner, meditation cuts secret. Progressive deepening, not to
be skipped. Study cuts gross concepts. Contemplation cuts subtle concepts.
Meditation cuts the most secret patterns.

The peacock conduct: transforming poison into beauty. But first cut through
superimpositions, or you're just a deluded person eating poison. The deer
conduct: solitude out of wisdom, not aversion. The mute conduct: silence that
liberates, not repression.

Mountain hermit practiced deer-like conduct for twenty years. Alone, sensitive,
avoiding society. One day a traveler asked: "Why do you live like this?" The
hermit laughed. "I don't live like anything. I just live. The deer comparison is
for those who need categories."

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: these conducts are not identities to
adopt! Don't become "the one who practices bee-like conduct." Don't collect
them like badges. Use them and drop them. They are rafts, not destinations.

Thus the twenty-one conducts are presented—not as rules but as possibilities,
not as requirements but as skillful means. Find what cuts your fixation. Practice
it. Then drop it. Move on. Or don't move on. The choice depends on what
liberates.

Emaho! Twenty-one conducts, twenty-one doorways to freedom. May all who
encounter these teachings find the conduct that cuts their particular pattern.
May all transcend conduct itself and rest in natural recognition.

Final instruction: do not imitate these conducts superficially. Don't play at
being a madman without stability. Don't pretend to be a peacock without
wisdom. The conduct must arise from recognition, not replace it. Recognition
first. Conduct follows. Never the reverse.

A friend concludes. Twenty-one conducts described. Twenty-one
possibilities pointed out. What remains? Recognition. Find your conduct. Practice
it deeply. Then see through it. Rest in what remains when all conducts are
transcended.

Sky-dancer laughed. "Twenty-one conducts? I have one conduct: recognizing
nature. What need for twenty? What need for one? Recognition is complete."

Between the elaborate enumeration of conducts and the simple fact of
recognition, there is no contradiction. The enumeration serves those who need
structure. The direct recognition serves those who can receive it. Both lead to
the same freedom.

Consider this: Hold these three.
all twenty-
one are included. Forget these three.
even twenty-one thousand conducts
will not help. The choice is yours—and the choice itself is conduct's play,
recognition's display, freedom's natural expression.

COMPREHENSIVE EXPANSION - DEEPENING THE TWENTY-ONE CONDUCTS:

The Weaver's Interconnected Understanding:
These twenty-one conducts are not separate threads but one fabric. The bee-like
and the peacock-like, the deer-like and the lion-like—they interweave. A true
practitioner moves between them naturally, not identifying with any single pattern.
The loom is awareness. The threads are circumstances. The weaving is practice.
The completed fabric is recognition.

The Hot Spring's Natural Wisdom:
Water emerges from deep earth, carries dissolved minerals, deposits them as beauty
at the surface, then returns to depth. The twenty-one conducts work like this.
They bring up deep patterns, transform them into display, then dissolve back into
awareness. Don't cling to any single conduct. Let them flow naturally.

The Mani Wall's Accumulated Blessing:
Each stone is placed with intention. Each carries the mantra. Together they create
a field of blessing visible from miles away. The twenty-one conducts are like
these stones. Each practice, each conduct, adds to the accumulation. Eventually,
the wall of recognition is complete.

The Cave's Dark Clarity:
Enter completely. Leave ordinary light behind. At first, blindness. Then slowly,
shapes emerge. Finally, clear vision in darkness. The conducts lead here—to the
cave of meditation where ordinary perception drops away and natural clarity
dawns. Each conduct is a step deeper into the cave.

The Juniper Smoke's Rising Blessing:
Offered to fire, the smoke rises naturally, carrying prayers throughout space. No
forcing, no directing. The fire of devotion. The juniper of practice. The smoke of
blessing. The space of awareness. The twenty-one conducts are different ways of
making this offering.

The Migration's Inner Wisdom:
Birds know when to move without consulting calendars. The knowing is in their
nature. So too with conducts. You will know which one is needed. The bee-like
for dispersion, the deer-like for sensitivity, the lion-like for courage. Trust
the knowing. Move when moved.

The Animal Tracks' Silent Teaching:
Each track tells a story—where the deer drank, where the fox hunted, where the
bird landed. The twenty-one conducts are tracks leading to the same waterhole
of recognition. Follow any track fully and it leads there. The danger is stopping
at the tracks, studying them, without following to the source.

The Root System's Hidden Connection:
Above ground, separate trunks. Below ground, intertwined roots sharing
nourishment. The conducts appear different above—bee-like, lion-like,
mountain-like. But below, in awareness, they are one root system. All draw from
the same source. All lead to the same recognition.

The Dzo's Patient Labor:
Steady, persistent, carrying the load up steep paths. The twenty-one conducts
require this patience. Not dramatic breakthroughs but steady practice. Day after
day, the bee-like conduct. Month after month, the deer-like conduct. Year after
year, the mountain-like conduct. Eventually, the summit.

The Celestial Burial's Complete Release:
Ultimate offering—body to birds, bones to wind. Nothing held back. The madman-
like conduct approaches this. Complete release of social identity, conventional
appearance, ego investment. Dangerous without stability. Liberating with it.

LONGCHENPA'S INTEGRATION:
All twenty-one conducts serve one purpose—to cut through fixation. Whether you
move like bee or lion, deer or garuda, the movement is toward recognition. Don't
identify with the conduct. Don't become "the practitioner of water-letter conduct."
Use it and move on. Or stay with it if it serves. The conduct serves you, not the
reverse.

THE SYSTEMATIZER'S ARCHITECTURE:
The twenty-one conducts organize into natural groups:
- Gathering conducts (bee, echo)
- Solitary conducts (deer, bear)
- Transformative conducts (peacock, heroine)
- Stable conducts (mountain, tortoise)
- Dynamic conducts (wind, thunder, garuda)
Each group addresses different patterns. All lead to the same destination.

THE INTEGRATOR'S SPACIOUS VIEW:
No conflict between bee-like gathering and deer-like solitude. No contradiction
between lion-like courage and tortoise-like withdrawal. All are displays of
awareness. All serve recognition. The conflict is conceptual. The reality is
unified.

GARAB DORJE'S STARK POINTING:
Enough categories! Enough conducts! Twenty-one ways to confuse yourself!
Recognition is not found in conduct. Recognition finds conduct useful or not.
Garab Dorje's three: Direct recognition. Unwavering rest. Continual return. The twenty-one conducts are for those who need
twenty-one attempts before they will rest.

PATRUL'S EARTHY LAUGHTER:
A meditator tried them all! Bee, deer, mute, peacock, madman, lion, dog, pig,
cloud, child, echo, elephant, tortoise, bear, Brahmin, heroine, water-letter,
sky-dagger, wind, garuda, mountain, thunder. I was a zoo of practices! Finally
exhausted, I sat down and recognized what was never absent. The zoo dissolved.
The animals were me all along.

THE SINGING YOGI'S DAILY INTEGRATION:
While milking the yak—bee-like conduct, gathering without preference.
While walking to market—deer-like conduct, sensitive to environment.
While in conversation—mute-like conduct, speaking only when necessary.
While facing obstacles—lion-like conduct, fearless confrontation.
While in meditation—cloud-like conduct, letting thoughts pass.
All twenty-one available in every moment.

THE ESSENCE HOLDER'S SPACIOUS REST:
Beyond all conduct, beyond all practice, beyond all effort—rest in what is
naturally present. The twenty-one conducts are medicine. When healthy, no
medicine needed. When recognition is stable, no conduct needed. Rest in that.

THE WANDERING GURU'S RADICAL SIMPLICITY:
The bee doesn't think "I am practicing bee-like conduct." The lion doesn't
think "I am being lion-like." They simply are. Be like this. Don't label.
Don't categorize. Just be what is needed in each moment. Recognition
expresses itself naturally.

THE VISIONARY DEVOTEE'S LONGING:
How I long to master all twenty-one! How I pray for the stability of mountain-like
conduct, the courage of lion-like conduct, the freedom of wind-like conduct!
This longing is itself a conduct. The longing for conduct is conduct. Recognize
even this.

THE LION-FACED DAKINI'S FIERCE COMPASSION:
Why twenty-one? Why not one? Why not none? The multiplication is for minds
that need variety. For minds that grasp at novelty. Cut through all twenty-one!
Rest without seeking further without conduct! This is the ultimate conduct—no conduct.

THE SKY-DANCER'S PLAYFUL WISDOM:
Twenty-one dances, twenty-one steps, twenty-one gestures. All lead to the same
still point at the center. Dance them all or dance none. The center remains.
Recognition remains. Play with conducts or don't play. The play is optional.
The recognition is essential.

THE CONSORT'S INTIMATE INSTRUCTION:
Between the practitioner and the conduct, let there be intimacy, not identity.
Like lovers who remain distinct individuals while united in embrace. You are
not the conduct. The conduct is not you. Yet they intertwine, support each
other, lead to mutual fulfillment.

THE MOUNTAIN HERMIT'S CAVE WISDOM:
After practicing deer-like conduct for years in solitude, visitors came asking
"Which conduct is best?" I answered "The one you practice fully." They asked
"Should I practice all twenty-one?" I answered "Practice one fully and you
practice all. Practice all superficially and you practice none."

THE ECHO'S RESPONSIVE TEACHING:
Call out.
the mountain returns your voice. Not adding, not subtracting,
just returning. The twenty-one conducts echo the needs of beings. When
fixation appears, conduct responds. When recognition dawns, conduct rests.
The echo doesn't choose to return. It is the nature of sound and space.

THE THUNDER'S SUDDEN BREAKTHROUGH:
Crack! Without warning, the sky opens. The thunder-like conduct comes suddenly,
breaking through rigid patterns. Not gradual, not gentle, but necessary when
gentleness fails. Use this conduct sparingly, like thunder itself. Too much
and everything becomes chaos. Just enough and rigid structures break.

The twenty-one conducts are not philosophical categories—they are living
responses to circumstances. When you find yourself grasping at experiences,
practice bee-like conduct. When you need deep retreat, practice deer-like
conduct. When words become obstacles, practice mute-like conduct. When
afflictions arise, practice peacock-like conduct.

The practitioner fluidly moves between conducts as circumstances demand.
Not rigidly identifying with any single pattern. Not confusing the finger
for the moon. Using each conduct as a tool for recognition, then setting it
down when recognition is stable.

Mountain-like conduct provides the foundation—stable recognition regardless
of circumstance. From this stability, all other conducts become expressions
rather than attainments. The mountain doesn't try to be stable. It is stable.
Likewise, recognition doesn't try to be present. It is present.

ULTIMATE INTEGRATION:

The twenty-one conducts lead to the conduct beyond conduct—natural expression
of recognition without deliberation. The bee doesn't decide to gather nectar.
The lion doesn't decide to be fearless. The mountain doesn't decide to be stable.
They simply are what they are.

When recognition is completely stable, conduct becomes natural, spontaneous,
without artifice. This is not "no conduct" in the sense of doing nothing. It is
"no conduct" in the sense of conduct without deliberation, without identity,
without grasping.

The practitioner who has reached this doesn't announce it. Doesn't identify as
"one who has transcended conduct." Simply rests in natural expression. The
bee-like moments happen naturally. The mountain-like stability is effortless.

Through the merit of this commentary on the twenty-one conducts, may all
beings find the conduct that cuts their particular fixation. May all transcend
the need for conduct and rest in natural recognition. May the Treasury of
Supreme Vehicle benefit countless beings.

May those who need structure find structure. May those who need freedom find
freedom. May those who need transformation find transformation. May all find
what serves their liberation.

The twenty-one conducts are complete. The teaching is given. The pointing is
made. What remains is practice. What remains is recognition. What remains is
natural liberation.

Emaho! The wonder of skillful means! The majesty of the Great Perfection!

The commentary on the twenty-one conducts is now complete. From the bee-like
gathering to the thunder-like breakthrough, all have been presented. The
practical applications have been shown. The ultimate integration has been
pointed to.

May all who encounter these words recognize the conduct that serves them.
May all practice diligently. May all transcend practice itself. May all rest
in the natural state of primordial purity, spontaneous presence, natural
liberation.

One practitioner has nothing more to say. The twenty-one conducts have been
explained. The choice is yours. Practice or don't practice. The recognition
is always present. The natural state is never apart from you.

Rest in this. Whatever conduct appears, let it serve recognition. Whatever
recognition dawns, let it express as conduct. The union of method and wisdom.
The completion of the path. The perfection of the Great Perfection.

Om ah hum. The completion. The perfection. The natural liberation.

ADDITIONAL VOICE ROTATION - FRESH PERSPECTIVES:

The Lacemaker's Patient Detail:
Each stitch is small but essential. Skip one.
the pattern fails. The twenty-one
conducts are like this—each one complete, each one necessary for someone.
Don't rush past them. Don't think you've understood them before you have lived
them. The devil is in the details. The liberation is in the details.

The Potter's Centered Creation:
The wheel spins, the clay rises, the form emerges. But first, the center must be
found. Without center, the pot collapses. The twenty-one conducts help find the
center—recognition. Once centered, the form creates itself. The conduct ceases
to be deliberate. It becomes natural.

The Calligrapher's Perfect Brush:
Years of practice until the brush moves itself. The character writes itself. The
ink flows without forcing. This is mastery. This is how the twenty-one conducts
become when recognition is stable. At first, effort. Finally, effortless.

The Glacier's Irresistible Movement:
Slow, almost imperceptible, yet mountains are carved. Valleys are formed. Lakes
are created. The twenty-one conducts work like this—gradually transforming the
landscape of mind. Be patient. The transformation is certain, even if invisible.

The Rainbow's Ungraspable Display:
Beautiful, vivid, real, yet untouchable. You cannot catch it. You cannot hold it.
You can only appreciate it. The fruit of practice is like this. Don't try to grasp
recognition. Appreciate it. That is enough.

The Root Network's Hidden Connection:
What appears separate above is connected below. The twenty-one conducts appear
different—some gather, some retreat, some transform, some stabilize. But below,
in awareness, they are one. All serve recognition. All lead to the same source.

The Dzo's Steady Labor:
Patient, persistent, carrying the load. Not dramatic, not exciting, just steady.
The twenty-one conducts require this. Day after day. Year after year. The path
is walked step by step. The summit is reached through steady effort.

The Celestial Burial's Complete Gift:
Ultimate generosity—giving everything back. The madman-like conduct approaches
this. Giving up social identity, conventional appearance, ego investment. Total
release. Complete surrender. This is the essence of conduct beyond conduct.

LONGCHENPA'S FINAL SYNTHESIS:
The twenty-one conducts are skillful means, not ultimate truth. They serve
recognition. When recognition is stable, they become natural expression. The
practitioner doesn't "do" conduct. Recognition expresses as conduct. This is
the difference between genuine practice and imitation.

The ground is primordial purity. The path is spontaneous presence. The fruition
is natural liberation. The twenty-one conducts are expressions of the path,
ways of engaging the ground, moving toward fruition. But all three are
simultaneous. All three are present now.

Rest in this understanding. Whatever conduct is needed, it will arise naturally.
Don't force. Don't suppress. Don't identify. Simply recognize.
let
recognition express itself.

Beyond all conduct, beyond all practice, beyond all effort and deliberation—
there is the natural state. It was never born. It will never die. It was never
bound. It will never be liberated. It simply is.

The twenty-one conducts point to this. They don't create it. They don't achieve
it. They reveal what was always present. Like cleaning a mirror—you don't
create the reflection. You reveal what was always reflecting.

This natural state is your own awareness. Rest in it. Don't try to improve it.
Don't try to maintain it. Simply rest. The resting is not something you do. It
is what remains when doing ceases.

The twenty-one conducts are complete. The teaching is given. The transmission
is made. What remains is your own recognition. Look. See. Rest.

The commentary on the twenty-one conducts of Trekcho is now complete. From the
bee-like gathering to the thunder-like breakthrough, all have been presented and
deepened. The practical applications have been shown. The ultimate integration
has been pointed to.

May all beings find the conduct that cuts their fixation. May all transcend
the need for conduct. May all rest in natural recognition. May the Treasury
of Supreme Vehicle benefit all without exception.

This traveler has said enough. The twenty-one conducts have been explained
from every angle. Practice them or don't practice them. The recognition is
always present. The natural state is never apart from you.

Rest in this. Whatever conduct appears, let it serve recognition. Whatever
recognition dawns, let it express naturally. This is the completion. This is
the perfection. This is the Great Perfection.

Emaho! The wonder of skillful means! The majesty of the Treasury!

Om ah hum. Svaha. The completion. The perfection. The natural liberation.

holding the water of recognition. Enter or don't enter. The valley is complete.
