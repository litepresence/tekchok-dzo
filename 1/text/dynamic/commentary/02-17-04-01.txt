Now listen carefully, brave yogin! The second topic: extensively explaining the twenty-one natures of secret great definite conduct and the progressive practice of vajra song and dance.

First, from the Sun-Moon Mouth-Join Tantra, these twenty-one conducts:

By bee-like conduct, enjoy all dharmas' taste; by deer-like conduct, abandon delusion's conditioned objects; by mute-like conduct, abandon various delusion speech; by peacock-like conduct, cut secret mantra doubt; by madman-like conduct, abandon dwelling on single objects; by lion-like conduct, go to charnel-grounds and abandon fear mind; by dog and pig-like conduct, abandon pure and impure thoughts; by cloud-like conduct, experience memory and thought instantly; by child-like conduct, abandon long delusion clinging; by echo-like conduct, guide the world according to words; by elephant-like conduct, turn the depth of samsara's battles; by deer-like conduct (again), abandon son and enemy concepts; by tortoise-like conduct, decide desire's content in time; by bear-like conduct, do not spread samsara's seed; by brahmin-like conduct, abandon enjoying others' food; by heroine-like conduct, divide samsara-nirvana boundary; by water-letter-like conduct, place memory support in self-place; by sky-dagger conduct, completely use phenomena; by mid-air wind-like conduct, abandon grasping and holding thoughts; by garuda-like conduct, cut abyss waves; by mountain-like conduct, above use unchanging self-pure; by thunder-like conduct, use appearance outward without turning.

Thus twenty-two enumeration exists, although two deer-like conducts gather as one—explained as twenty-one.

[2147-2168]
Second: the three aspects of vajra song and dance progressively—song dance time, song dance actuality, song dance benefit.

First: the time of conduct that divides samsara-nirvana boundary, and accumulation, and empowerment, and mandala accomplishment time, and samadhi above spreading time—these five kinds of pure time, ordinary beings cannot see, done secretly. From that itself: whatever yogin possesses fortune, when time comes to go in charnel-grounds, again and again take up vajra song, dwell in non-thought meditation with companions. Before going to all conduct, therefore itself take vajra song, enter accumulation, empowerment, mandala—that time diligently do song. Time relies on non-think mind; this occasion itself should take it up.

[2169-2177]
Particularly: the supreme explains mind settling and dullness cutting. From that: whatever meditation you enter, this settle-enter it is. If yogin experiences dullness, cutting this samadhi is good—self-rigpa's great bliss beats, linking mahamudra itself.

Emaho! Twenty-one conducts! All are skillful means to cut through fixation. Don't cling to any one—use them all as paths to freedom!

[2311-2314]
From the Sun-Moon Union: By the wisdom of hearing, cut through outer superimpositions. The nature is complete. By the wisdom of contemplation, cut through inner superimpositions. By the wisdom of meditation, cut through secret superimpositions.

Listen to this! Longchenpa is describing how to use the three wisdoms to cut through three types of conceptual overlays. First, through study and hearing, you cut through the outer projections—the way you superimpose concepts onto external phenomena. Then through contemplation, you cut through the inner projections—the way you superimpose onto your own thoughts and emotions. Finally through meditation, you cut through the secret projections—the deepest, most subtle layers of conceptual mind.

This is the progressive deepening of insight. Don't think you can skip to the end! You have to work through these stages. Study cuts the gross concepts. Contemplation cuts the subtle concepts. Meditation cuts the most secret, hidden conceptual patterns.

[2315-2316]
As a companion to that: Without doubt, entering the peacock's house—the peacock eats poison and transforms it into beautiful plumage. Before entering, superimpositions must be cut through, finished, so that confusion doesn't come. Having cut through the superimpositions of hearing and contemplation, take the instructions you're confident in into experience.

The peacock conduct! Do you know what this means? The peacock eats poisonous snakes, but instead of dying, it transforms that poison into the beauty of its feathers. This is the conduct of the tantric practitioner who takes whatever arises—afflictions, obstacles, problems—and transforms them into the path. But you can't do this if you haven't first cut through your conceptual overlays! Otherwise you're just a deluded person eating poison, not a peacock.

[2317-2318]
As a companion to that: The deer-like conduct—not in the domain of all, dwelling alone on a mountain where people don't go out of fear of falling into samsara, taking experience. Like a deer hiding alone out of fear of hunters.

This is the hermit's way. The deer is incredibly sensitive, aware, alert. It stays away from human habitation because it knows the danger. The practitioner who takes up this conduct is like that—sensitive to the dangers of samsara, staying alone in mountain retreats, not mingling with society. Not because they don't like people, but because they need the solitude to deepen their practice.

[2319-2320]
As a companion to that: The mute-like conduct—ceasing speech, not speaking with anyone.

Sometimes you need to stop talking completely. Not just reducing speech, but actual silence. No conversation, no teaching, no social interaction. Just silence. Do you know how powerful this is? When you stop talking, the mind begins to settle. The constant chatter that maintains your sense of self begins to fade.

[2321-2322]
When you do this, memory becomes rigid—madman-like conduct. Body, speech, and mind's conduct without planetary attachment, arising spontaneously like a madman.

Now this is dangerous territory! The madman conduct—acting without social conventions, without the normal constraints of decorum. This is an advanced practice for those who have stable realization. They act spontaneously, without attachment to purity or impurity, without worrying about what others think. But listen: if you try this without stable realization, you're just a crazy person, not a realized yogi!

[2323-2324]
At this time, pure and impure not distinguished, dog-pig-like conduct arises from dawn—enjoying whatever food and clothing without picking and choosing.

This is transcending the ordinary human obsessions with cleanliness and purity. The dog eats garbage. The pig wallows in mud. They don't discriminate. In the same way, the advanced practitioner is beyond pure and impure. Whatever comes, they accept. Simple food, simple clothes—no complaints, no preferences. Can you do this? Can you let go of your refined tastes and discriminating mind?

[2325-2327]
Thus when the six are complete, at that time others cannot overwhelm your manner, suppressing the far shore—lion-like conduct arises. Like a lion who has no fear or anxiety about anything, this yogin, free from the harm of all humans and non-humans, arises with the ability to overpower anything.

The lion conduct—this is mastery. The six conducts have come to completion. Now the practitioner is fearless, powerful, beyond all harm. They can transform appearances at will. But look at the progression! This doesn't happen at the beginning. It comes after the peacock conduct, the deer conduct, the mute conduct, the madman conduct, the dog-pig conduct. Each one builds on the previous.

[2328-2333]
If you give these conducts a personal name, they're called "conduct that transforms appearances." Moreover, able to overpower others' minds, able to kill and restore, accomplishing miracles, dharmata's experience blazing like alcohol intoxication, free from fear in any direction, the ability to transform the four elements arises.

The powers that arise—these are siddhis, accomplishments. But don't grasp at them! They're byproducts of realization, not goals to achieve. The real accomplishment is the freedom from fear, the blazing confidence of dharmata, the natural power that comes from recognizing your own nature.

Don't think you're ready for this conduct! Most practitioners are not. These are advanced practices for those with stable realization. If you try to act like a madman or like a dog without the inner stability, you'll just create confusion and harm.

[2334]
Second, the instruction's method of appearance direct-placement: whatever appears, by seeing mind-itself placed directly on top of appearance.

This is the key instruction! Whatever appears in your experience—thoughts, emotions, perceptions—you place your mind directly on top of it. Not analyzing it, not following it, not rejecting it. Just direct placement, naked awareness meeting naked appearance. This is the essence of the practice.

Emaho! These conducts are the expressions of realization, not the causes of it.

[2335-2346]
Like snow falling on rock salt—on top of the appearance itself, self-liberation goes spontaneously, instantly. That also: arising appearance, ceasing appearance, coming and going appearance, and so forth—training in phenomena as different pieces, grasping and attachment liberated. Although appearing, empty of truth—like reflections, water-moon, sound-echo, emanations, illusions, mirages, optical illusions, like a dream horse completely pure.

Listen to this! Longchenpa gives you eight metaphors for how appearances are: like snow on rock salt, like reflections in a mirror, like the moon in water, like echoes, like magical emanations, like illusions created by a magician, like a mirage, like optical illusions, like a dream. What do all these have in common?

They appear, but they're not real! The reflection appears, but you can't drink it. The echo sounds, but has no source. The dream horse seems completely real while you're dreaming, but leaves no trace when you wake. This is how all phenomena are—they appear, vividly, but they're empty of inherent existence.

The practice is to see this directly. When appearances arise, let them self-liberate instantly, like snow falling on salt and dissolving immediately. Don't try to stop appearances. Don't try to maintain them. Just let them arise and cease naturally, seeing their empty nature.
