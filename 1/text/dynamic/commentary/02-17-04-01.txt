Twenty-one conducts. Twenty-one ways to transcend fixation. Twenty-one skillful
means to cut through the net of conceptual mind. This is not a menu to choose
from—each practitioner finds the conduct that cuts their particular pattern of
grasping.

Bee-like conduct: enjoying all dharmas' taste without preference, like a bee
moving from flower to flower. Not getting stuck on any single experience, not
rejecting any appearance. Every phenomenon offers nectar when recognized.

Deer-like conduct: abandoning delusion's conditioned objects, dwelling alone
where people don't go. The deer is sensitive, alert, aware of danger. The
practitioner stays away from samsara's busyness, not from aversion but from
recognizing what deep practice requires.

Mute-like conduct: abandoning various delusion speech, not speaking with
anyone. Silence cuts the constant chatter that maintains ego. In silence, the
mind settles. In silence, recognition deepens. This is not repression—it is
liberation from the need to validate existence through words.

Peacock-like conduct: cutting secret mantra doubt, transforming poison into
beauty. The peacock eats poisonous snakes and transforms them into brilliant
plumage. The practitioner takes afflictions as path—anger becomes mirror-like
wisdom, desire becomes discriminating wisdom. But this requires stable
recognition. Without it, eating poison just makes you sick.

[2147-2168]
Madman-like conduct: abandoning dwelling on single objects, arising
spontaneously without social convention. Body, speech, and mind's conduct
without attachment, like a madman. This is dangerous territory—advanced
practice for those with stable realization. Without stability, you're just crazy,
not a realized yogi.

Lion-like conduct: going to charnel-grounds, abandoning fear mind. The lion
fears no corpse, no death, no decay. The practitioner goes where others fear,
confronting impermanence directly. Fear is the mind's last fortress. The lion
demolishes it.

Dog and pig-like conduct: abandoning pure and impure thoughts, enjoying
whatever comes without discrimination. Dogs eat garbage. Pigs wallow in mud.
They don't judge. The practitioner transcends human obsessions with
cleanliness, accepting whatever conditions arise. Simple food, simple clothes—
no preferences, no complaints.

[2169-2200]
Cloud-like conduct: experiencing memory and thought instantly, letting them
pass like clouds in sky. Not holding, not rejecting. Thoughts arise, thoughts
dissolve. The sky of awareness remains unchanged. This is not suppression—it
is natural flow.

Child-like conduct: abandoning long delusion clinging, approaching experience
with fresh eyes. A child sees without concepts, meets each moment as new. The
practitioner drops accumulated interpretations, experiencing directly what is.

Echo-like conduct: guiding the world according to words, responding to beings'
calls like an echo responds to sound. No self, no agenda—just natural
resonance. When called, answer. When not called, rest.

Elephant-like conduct: turning the depth of samsara's battles, powerful and
unstoppable. The elephant walks through obstacles without hesitation. The
practitioner meets samsara's challenges with strength, transforming battles into
path.

[2201-2230]
Tortoise-like conduct: deciding desire's content in time, withdrawing when
necessary. The tortoise pulls into its shell, conserving energy, waiting for right
moment. The practitioner knows when to engage, when to retreat—not from
cowardice but from wisdom.

Bear-like conduct: not spreading samsara's seed, hibernating in deep practice.
The bear sleeps through winter, not engaging with the world's busyness. The
practitioner sometimes withdraws completely, not seeing anyone, not teaching,
not involved—just practicing.

Brahmin-like conduct: abandoning enjoying others' food, self-sufficient and
independent. Not depending on others' offerings, not cultivating patrons, not
seeking support. Complete self-reliance in practice and livelihood.

Heroine-like conduct: dividing samsara-nirvana boundary, fearlessly going
where others won't. The heroine is fierce, uncompromising, cutting through
delusion without hesitation. This is wrathful compassion in action.

[2231-2260]
Water-letter-like conduct: placing memory support in self-place, letting
impressions dissolve like writing on water. Nothing sticks, nothing accumulates.
Each moment fresh, each experience immediately released.

Sky-dagger conduct: completely using phenomena, cutting through with direct
perception. The sky-dagger (phurba) nails demons to the ground of recognition.
Every appearance is used, nothing is rejected, everything is transformed.

Mid-air wind-like conduct: abandoning grasping and holding thoughts, moving
without obstruction like wind. No fixed position, no permanent residence,
nowhere to grasp, nothing to hold.

Garuda-like conduct: cutting abyss waves, soaring above obstacles. The
garuda hatches fully grown, flying immediately. The practitioner recognizes
without stages, cutting through depths of confusion in a single stroke.

[2261-2290]
Mountain-like conduct: above using unchanging self-pure, stable and
immovable. Whatever weather comes—sun, rain, storm—the mountain
remains. The practitioner's recognition is equally stable, unaffected by
circumstance.

Thunder-like conduct: using appearance outward without turning, powerful and
sudden. Thunder cracks without warning, shaking everything. The practitioner's
activity can be sudden, shocking, breaking through rigid patterns.

[2291-2310]
Between these twenty-one conducts and the recognition that transcends all
conduct, we find the vast middle way. Not rejecting conduct, not grasping it.
The conducts are medicine for specific diseases. When the disease is cured,
stop taking medicine.

This old fool tried every conduct. He was bee-like, then deer-like, then mute,
then peacock. He thought more conducts meant more progress. Finally he
understood: the conduct is not the point. Recognition is the point. The conduct
only serves recognition.

[2311-2320]
Three wisdoms cut through three superimpositions: hearing cuts outer,
contemplation cuts inner, meditation cuts secret. Progressive deepening, not to
be skipped. Study cuts gross concepts. Contemplation cuts subtle concepts.
Meditation cuts the most secret patterns.

The peacock conduct: transforming poison into beauty. But first cut through
superimpositions, or you're just a deluded person eating poison. The deer
conduct: solitude out of wisdom, not aversion. The mute conduct: silence that
liberates, not repression.

[2321-2330]
Mountain hermit practiced deer-like conduct for twenty years. Alone, sensitive,
avoiding society. One day a traveler asked: "Why do you live like this?" The
hermit laughed. "I don't live like anything. I just live. The deer comparison is
for those who need categories."

[2331-2340]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: these conducts are not identities to
adopt! Don't become "the one who practices bee-like conduct." Don't collect
them like badges. Use them and drop them. They are rafts, not destinations.

[2341-2350]
Thus the twenty-one conducts are presented—not as rules but as possibilities,
not as requirements but as skillful means. Find what cuts your fixation. Practice
it. Then drop it. Move on. Or don't move on. The choice depends on what
liberates.

[2351-2360]
Emaho! Twenty-one conducts, twenty-one doorways to freedom. May all who
encounter these teachings find the conduct that cuts their particular pattern.
May all transcend conduct itself and rest in natural recognition.

[2361-2370]
Final instruction: do not imitate these conducts superficially. Don't play at
being a madman without stability. Don't pretend to be a peacock without
wisdom. The conduct must arise from recognition, not replace it. Recognition
first. Conduct follows. Never the reverse.

[2371-2380]
This old vagabond concludes. Twenty-one conducts described. Twenty-one
possibilities pointed out. What remains? Recognition. Find your conduct. Practice
it deeply. Then see through it. Rest in what remains when all conducts are
transcended.

[2381-2390]
Sky-dancer laughed. "Twenty-one conducts? I have one conduct: recognizing
nature. What need for twenty? What need for one? Recognition is complete."

[2391-2400]
Between the elaborate enumeration of conducts and the simple fact of
recognition, there is no contradiction. The enumeration serves those who need
structure. The direct recognition serves those who can receive it. Both lead to
the same freedom.

[2401-End]
Three words. Conduct. Recognition. Freedom. Hold these three, and all twenty-
one are included. Forget these three, and even twenty-one thousand conducts
will not help. The choice is yours—and the choice itself is conduct's play,
recognition's display, freedom's natural expression.
