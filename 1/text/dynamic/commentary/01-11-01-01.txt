[13104-13108]
Between the visible and the subtle, the gandharva seeks form. White essence meeting red essence—like snow melting into a mountain lake, two waters becoming one. This is not metaphor alone; watch the moment of union and see how consciousness finds its vessel.

[13109-13115]
Thus. The four elements arise from space, yet space remains untouched. From the parents' afflictions and the channel-winds, desire-mind stirs. Like dry grass catching flame from a distant spark, the YAM sound moves and fire blazes. This is the play of cause and condition—never separate, always dancing.

[13116-13121]
This old fool watched a smith forge iron once. The hammer strikes, the metal glows, two things becoming one through fire and pressure. So too the white essence travels twenty-eight vertebrae, drawn by wind-power like filings to a magnet. What seems mechanical is the mind's own magic show.

[13122-13127]
Seven days, four times—these numbers are not just counts. Like a farmer knows the moon for planting, the body knows its rhythms. The white bodhicitta descending, the red ascending, meeting in the palace of bliss. Find this very bliss in your own breath, right now.

[13128-13135]
Three words. See what is. Rest. The vajra-channel opens great bliss. The navel receives like a valley cupping rain. The tip ripens what was sown. Then consciousness drawn inward—like a bird returning to its nest at dusk, like rivers flowing always to the sea.

[13136-13141]
This very desire—look closely! Is it different from the wisdom that knows it? Cause and condition: two words for one seamless process. The wind holds the body, yet who holds the wind? Ask this not with mind but with the body that already knows.

[13142-13148]
Between the first night and the holding, something precious occurs. Like a mustard seed in a golden box, consciousness remains distinct yet protected. The four elements bind with jewel-shell strength—no separation possible. This binding is the very condition that allows liberation later. Contained to be released.

[13149-13157]
The second day, earth presses down. The third, fire burns fine as dust. The fourth, wind scatters like mercury drops shaken from a cloth. Each element plays its part—suffering experienced, yes, but suffering that knows itself is wisdom's door.

[13158-13165]
This mountain dweller felt his body tremble in meditation once—sudden, unbidden. Now I understand: that trembling was the wind arising, the elements announcing their presence. The suffering of formation is the suffering that precedes all joy. Know this and the four empowerments reveal themselves.

[13166-13175]
The water channels clear and move. Directions four—earth, water, fire, wind—each with its letter, its color, its trembling. Like prayer flags in mountain wind, they flutter and coil. The sheep is complete; the mind moves much. Find the one who watches the movement.

[13176-13181]
Life stretches like a thong between pegs. Time, occasion, abiding, increasing—four aspects of one breath. When straight, life is long. When coiled left, obstacles arise. When bent downward, brief the stay. The sounds at birth—A YU, KHAM, A KRIM—are the body's own mantras, spoken before language.

[13182-13191]
Thus. From the treatises: life is warmth and consciousness supported. The fifth day, water holds the body clear. The sixth, fire and wind join in formation's work. Each day the elements teach—if we have ears to hear beyond the ordinary.

[13192-13202]
Listen! The SUM letter shines yellow, and from it arises the voice of beings. Walking, sleeping, sitting, moving—these four postures emerge from channels harmonious. Your very way of being in the world is written in these channels before you knew the world.

[13203-13212]
The sixth day completes what the first began. Elements form and destroy, form again. RAM blazes, consciousness sharpens or dulls according to clarity. This is not fate—this is the immediate result of conditions meeting. Change the conditions, change the result. This is the tantra's promise.

[13213-13220]
Four elements, four empowerments, four results—numbers pointing to what cannot be numbered. When male and female elements join, body grows. Like a seed swelling with rain, like a fire catching wind, the gathering happens naturally, inevitably, perfectly.

[13221-13232]
Seven days, and the four elements become one taste. Wind, mind, flesh, blood, heat, breath, channels, letters—all nur-nur, coiled and ready. From this gathering, YAM moves like rope, breath goes and comes, empty and full. This is the body's own pranayama, taught before teachers.

[13233-13243]
The five aggregates find their basis in dust-fine elements, each with its letter, its wisdom. JRI KHAM TAM MAM BYAM—five letters, five Buddha families, five lights coiling like a shell's radiance. The body is already a mandala. Recognition makes it so.

[13244-13255]
Thus. In each water channel, basis-abiding wisdom rests, face not divided. Like six thousand seeds in a cool granary, the Buddha-forms await. Characteristic-holding wisdom, consciousness-gathered wisdom—all present, all complete, waiting only for the recognition that is always available.

[13256-13270]
Wind channels hold knowing-object wisdom—non-conceptual, two gathered as one. Red for self-purpose realized, yellow for other-purpose. The body experiences all: cessation, birth, abiding, pleasure, pain. This is the yogi's body—three kayas in one form, complete from the beginning.

[13271-13280]
Seven days compress the basis. Seven days gather approach-accomplishment. The wisdoms are horse-wind—when body dissolves, they remain as light and movement. Letters, light, bodies—all rigpa's self-resonance, clearing outward, dissolving back into what never moved.

[13281-13290]
Two seven-day periods, elements work their magic. Channels eight, consciousness eight, gathering bundle definite. Like stars not touching yet held in mutual constellation, the winds move without contact. Samantabhadra's forms arise within—this is the self-arisen mandala, requiring no artist.

[13291-13305]
Fourteen days, and the four supports become mer-mer form. Water insects, fine and knowing, change and shed, karma-acting—these four become body. Not solid, not separate, yet functionally real. This is the control body: Buddha's form without Buddha's form, emptiness dancing as form.

[13306-13316]
From Vajra Tip Play: one form, body's extent, thousand beyond number. The sky-body neither comes nor goes, neither fills nor empties. This is not philosophy—this is the body you have right now, if you would only look with eyes unclouded by grasping.

[13317-13327]
Three seven-day periods complete. Fifteen days, earth channels generate light. Sixteen, mindfulness basis gold-arisen. Seventeen, sky-clouds swirl with karma-wind. Eighteen, eighteen elements complete their gathering. Twenty-one days, the alaya-support transforms—this is tantra's completion, hidden in biology.

[13328-13341]
Four elements, four diseases, four humors—wind, bile, phlegm, and their combinations. The channels multiply: four become eight, eight their basis. Light and letter clear, like starlight on snow. This is the gathering wheel, the taste-wheel, the place where senses first find their objects.

[13342-13356]
Twenty-nine to thirty-two days, water gathers and steadies. Fire blazes and grows. Wind moves and scatters. The elements exhaust their individual power, then two-by-two combine. The completion wheel—sixty-two channels showing sixty-two eons of birth and death. Contained in a month.

[13357-13372]
Thirty-two channels, thirty-two wisdoms, thirty-two activities—each channel with its letter, its light, its Samantabhadra forms. One hundred twenty-four, one hundred eighty-six, three hundred ten variations. The body is mathematics made flesh, poetry made biology, wisdom made matter.

[13373-13384]
Forty-two days, water insects multiply—eighty-four thousand forms. Sixty-two channel-petals mark sixty-two eons. Each channel contains its letter, its light-sphere, its yabyum pair. The numbers are infinite because the mind's display is infinite. Yet all resolve in one recognition.

[13385-13404]
First completion wheel: three hundred ten wisdom variations. Pure wind moves, expanding and contracting, revealing shamatha and vipashyana's work. This is called producer because it produces existence's body-basis. Thus the wheel turns, thus the basis holds all.

[13405-13417]
Forty-six days, consciousness gathering wheel completes. Elements multiply, aggregates swell, sense-bases expand, afflictions grow. The eighteen elements transform and proliferate. This is not degeneration but ripening—the same process that will lead to liberation if known.

[13418-13430]
Four elements exhaust; two combine. Channels sixteen, gathering dharmas, wisdom sixteen, letters sixteen. The empowerment's growth shows in the body's subtle architecture. Every channel a doorway, every letter a key, every light-sphere a complete universe.
