[1-5]
Between the visible and the subtle, the gandharva seeks form. White essence meeting red essence—like snow melting into a mountain lake, two waters becoming one. This is not metaphor alone; watch the moment of union and see how consciousness finds its vessel.

[6-10]
This old fool witnessed birth and death many times. Not just in meditation
but in the meadows of Sertar's turning—seeds sprouting, rivers freezing and thawing,
stars dying and birthing. The gandharva: not a spirit but the seeking
itself, the impulse toward form, the gravity of becoming.

White and red: father-mother, method-wisdom, skillful means and emptiness.
Meeting in the red palace at the navel center—this is not anatomy textbook
but the body's own tantra written in flesh and blood.

[11-17]
Thus. The four elements arise from space, yet space remains untouched. From the parents' afflictions and the channel-winds, desire-mind stirs. Like dry grass catching flame from a distant spark, the YAM sound moves and fire blazes. This is the play of cause and condition—never separate, always dancing.

[18-24]
Therefore. Thus. The systematic origination: space first, always first,
the container that is not contained. Then elements from space, like
colors from light—not different, not separate, just appearing.

YAM: the seed syllable of wind, movement, change. From wind comes fire,
from fire water, from water earth. The descent of consciousness: not
falling but entering, like water poured into water, like breath entering
breath.

[25-30]
This mountain dweller watched a smith forge iron once. The hammer strikes, the metal glows, two things becoming one through fire and pressure. So too the white essence travels twenty-eight vertebrae, drawn by wind-power like filings to a magnet. What seems mechanical is the mind's own magic show.

[31-36]
The vertebrae are not just bone but the ladder of ascent
and descent. Twenty-eight: the days of the moon, the houses of the zodiac,
the stages of consciousness. Wind-power: not physical air but the moving
principle, the energy that animates, the breath that bridges body and mind.

The magic show: consciousness fooled by its own display, magician entranced
by own magic. The white essence rises, the red descends, they meet—
conjuring trick performed by the conjurer on himself.

[37-42]
Seven days, four times—these numbers are not just counts. Like a farmer knows the moon for planting, the body knows its rhythms. The white bodhicitta descending, the red ascending, meeting in the palace of bliss. Find this very bliss in your own breath, right now.

[43-48]
Walking the high passes... lived by the moon's phases once. Planted by new moon,
harvested by full. The body too has its lunar cycles—twenty-eight days
of blood, the tide of hormones, the rhythm of sleep. Seven days: the week,
the quarter moon, the cycle of completion.

The palace of bliss at the navel: not pleasure as distraction but bliss
as recognition. When white and red meet in their dance, bliss arises
naturally, effortlessly. Find it in breath—the pause between inhalation
and exhalation, the gap where bliss abides.

[49-56]
Look. Here. Done.

[57-64]
Therefore. Thus. The movement inward: consciousness usually projects
outward—toward objects, toward world, toward other. But here it turns,
like tide returning, like breath that has reached fullness and must release.

The vajra-channel: central, subtle, complete. Not the spine exactly but
along it, within it, transcending it. Great bliss: not ordinary pleasure
multiplied but the bliss of recognition, the joy of coming home.

[65-70]
This very desire—look closely! Is it different from the wisdom that knows it? Cause and condition: two words for one seamless process. The wind holds the body, yet who holds the wind? Ask this not with mind but with the body that already knows.

[71-76]
Between the desire and the knowing, we find no boundary. Desire arises—
what knows it? Not separate from wisdom, just unrecognized as such. Like
fire burning: the burning is the nature, not a problem to solve.

The wind holds body: prana, the life-force, the breath that is not just
air but vitality. Who holds wind? The question answers itself when asked
by body rather than mind. The body knows it is held; the mind doubts.

[77-83]
Between the first night and the holding, something precious occurs. Like a mustard seed in a golden box, consciousness remains distinct yet protected. The four elements bind with jewel-shell strength—no separation possible. This binding is the very condition that allows liberation later. Contained to be released.

[84-90]
Before recognition dawned... misunderstood containment for decades. Thought liberation
meant escape, transcendence, leaving the box. Then realized: the box was
gold, the seed was precious, the containment was protection, not prison.

Jewel-shell strength: the binding of elements creates a vessel strong
enough to hold consciousness through the storm of becoming. Without this
strength, dispersion; with it, the possibility of awakening.

[91-99]
The second day, earth presses down. The third, fire burns fine as dust. The fourth, wind scatters like mercury drops shaken from a cloth. Each element plays its part—suffering experienced, yes, but suffering that knows itself is wisdom's door.

[100-108]
Therefore. Thus. The elemental sequence: earth, water, fire, wind—each
taking its turn in the formation. Not random but ordered, not chaotic but
rhythmic. The body builds itself according to ancient pattern, written
in channels, spoken by winds.

Suffering of formation: the discomfort of becoming, the pain of growth,
the stress of manifestation. But known—this is the key. Suffering known
is wisdom; suffering unknown is just suffering.

[109-116]
This mountain dweller felt his body tremble in meditation once—sudden, unbidden. Now I understand: that trembling was the wind arising, the elements announcing their presence. The suffering of formation is the suffering that precedes all joy. Know this and the four empowerments reveal themselves.

[117-124]
The trembling is auspicious—wind moving in channels,
energy clearing blockages, the body preparing for higher functioning.
Not to fear but to welcome, not to suppress but to allow.

Four empowerments: vase, secret, wisdom-word, ultimate. Each corresponds
to a stage of formation, each reveals a dimension of awakening. The body
that knows its formation knows its liberation.

[125-134]
The water channels clear and move. Directions four—earth, water, fire, wind—each with its letter, its color, its trembling. Like prayer flags in mountain wind, they flutter and coil. The sheep is complete; the mind moves much. Find the one who watches the movement.

[135-144]
This wanderer hangs prayer flags every year. Watch them in wind: earth-yellow,
water-white, fire-red, wind-green. Fluttering, coiling, trembling—just
like the channels described. The ancients saw what science later mapped:
the body as mandala, the elements as directions.

Sheep complete: the astrological moment, the conditions aligned. Mind
moves much: consciousness active, seeking, becoming. The watcher: not
separate but the knowing within the movement.

[145-150]
Life stretches like a thong between pegs. Time, occasion, abiding, increasing—four aspects of one breath. When straight, life is long. When coiled left, obstacles arise. When bent downward, brief the stay. The sounds at birth—A YU, KHAM, A KRIM—are the body's own mantras, spoken before language.

[151-156]
Therefore. Thus. The thong metaphor: life as tension, as stretch, as
vibration between poles. Not loose, not tight—just right for the song.
Four aspects: when born, how born, how long, how much growth. All written
in the channels, all readable by those who know the script.

A YU KHAM A KRIM: seed syllables, primal sounds, the mantras before
mantras. Spoken by the body at birth, announcing the elemental nature,
calling forth the wisdoms.

[157-166]
Thus. From the treatises: life is warmth and consciousness supported. The fifth day, water holds the body clear. The sixth, fire and wind join in formation's work. Each day the elements teach—if we have ears to hear beyond the ordinary.

[167-176]
This old hermit has held many dying hands. Felt the warmth fade, watched
consciousness depart. Life is warmth plus consciousness—simple formula,
profound implication. Remove warmth: death. Remove consciousness: death.
Maintain both: life continues.

Fifth day water: the fluid body, the aqueous self. Sixth day fire and
wind: the metabolic heat, the respiratory cycle. The body teaches tantra
to those who listen to its rhythms.

[177-187]
Listen! The SUM letter shines yellow, and from it arises the voice of beings. Walking, sleeping, sitting, moving—these four postures emerge from channels harmonious. Your very way of being in the world is written in these channels before you knew the world.

[188-198]
SUM: the earth seed syllable, yellow, square, stable. From stability
comes voice—not just speech but the vibration of being. The four postures:
walking like wind, sleeping like earth, sitting like water, moving like
fire. Harmonious channels: when energy flows freely, posture is natural,
movement is ease.

This mountain dweller watches villagers: some walk like wind, swift and
changeable; some like earth, steady and slow. Each reveals their channel
condition, each condition readable, each readable condition changeable
through practice.

[199-208]
The sixth day completes what the first began. Elements form and destroy, form again. RAM blazes, consciousness sharpens or dulls according to clarity. This is not fate—this is the immediate result of conditions meeting. Change the conditions, change the result. This is the tantra's promise.

[209-218]
Therefore. Thus. The sixth day culmination: fire fully present, RAM
the seed syllable blazing. Consciousness: not fixed but dependent on
conditions. Sharp or dull, bright or dim—all according to elemental
balance, channel flow, wind movement.

Not fate: this cannot be emphasized enough. The embryonic formation is
conditioned; therefore, it can be reconditioned. The tantra's promise:
know the conditions, change the conditions, change the result.

[219-226]
Four elements, four empowerments, four results—numbers You dreamt you were searching. The search was dream, the dreamer was not. what cannot be numbered. When male and female elements join, body grows. Like a seed swelling with rain, like a fire catching wind, the gathering happens naturally, inevitably, perfectly.

[227-234]
This old fool loves these numbers—four, seven, twenty-one, eighty-four
thousand. Each a Reflection appears, changes, vanishes. What reflects?, each pointing necessary for certain
minds, each ultimately provisional. What cannot be numbered: the essence,
the nature, the awakening itself.

Male-female joining: not just physical union but the union of all
dualities. Body grows naturally—no forcing needed, no control possible,
just the wisdom of allowing what happens perfectly.

[235-246]
Seven days, and the four elements become one taste. Wind, mind, flesh, blood, heat, breath, channels, letters—all nur-nur, coiled and ready. From this gathering, YAM moves like rope, breath goes and comes, empty and full. This is the body's own pranayama, taught before teachers.

[247-258]
Nur-nur—coiled, ready, potential. Like a spring wound
tight, like a seed before sprouting. All elements gathered, all conditions
present, just awaiting the trigger.

YAM like rope: wind as connection, as lifeline, as the thread that weaves
the elements into body. Breath: the first pranayama, taught by nature,
learned by body, forgotten by mind, remembered by practice.

[259-269]
The five aggregates find their basis in dust-fine elements, each with its letter, its wisdom. JRI KHAM TAM MAM BYAM—five letters, five Buddha families, five lights coiling like a shell's radiance. The body is already a mandala. Recognition makes it so.

[270-280]
Therefore. Thus. The aggregates take form: form, feeling, perception,
formation, consciousness. Each based on elements so fine they seem dust,
yet holding the whole structure. Five letters: earth JRI, water KHAM,
fire TAM, wind MAM, space BYAM. Five wisdoms: mirror-like, equality,
discriminating, all-accomplishing, dharmadhatu.

The body as mandala: not created but revealed. Recognition is the only
ritual needed.

[281-292]
Thus. In each water channel, basis-abiding wisdom rests, face not divided. Like six thousand seeds in a cool granary, the Buddha-forms await. Characteristic-holding wisdom, consciousness-gathered wisdom—all present, all complete, waiting only for the recognition that is always available.

[293-304]
This wanderer once visited a seed vault—rows of containers, each holding
thousands of seeds, dormant, potential, waiting. The body is such a vault:
six thousand Buddha-forms, countless wisdoms, all present, all complete,
just waiting for the conditions of awakening.

Basis-abiding wisdom: the wisdom that never left, never went anywhere,
never needed to be found. Face not divided: the wisdom face and ordinary
face are the same face, just seen differently.

[305-319]
Wind channels hold knowing-object wisdom—non-conceptual, two gathered as one. Red for self-purpose realized, yellow for other-purpose. The body experiences all: cessation, birth, abiding, pleasure, pain. This is the yogi's body—three kayas in one form, complete from the beginning.

[309-328]
First completion wheel: three hundred ten wisdom variations. Pure wind moves, expanding and contracting, revealing shamatha and vipashyana's work. This is called producer because it produces existence's body-basis. Thus the wheel turns, thus the basis holds all.

[313-328]
Thirty-two channels, thirty-two wisdoms, thirty-two activities—each channel with its letter, its light, its Samantabhadra forms. One hundred twenty-four, one hundred eighty-six, three hundred ten variations. The body is mathematics made flesh, poetry made biology, wisdom made matter.

[314-328]
Therefore. Thus. The wind channels: not separate from water channels but
intertwined, interdependent, co-arising. Knowing-object wisdom: the wisdom
that knows without concept, perceives without grasping, experiences without
attachment.

Red and yellow: the color-coding of tantra, not arbitrary but indicating
different functions, different flows, different wisdoms. Self-purpose and
other-purpose: the two aims, two benefits, two dimensions of awakening.

[315-328]
Four elements, four diseases, four humors—wind, bile, phlegm, and their combinations. The channels multiply: four become eight, eight their basis. Light and letter clear, like starlight on snow. This is the gathering wheel, the taste-wheel, the place where senses first find their objects.

[316-328]
Forty-six days, consciousness gathering wheel completes. Elements multiply, aggregates swell, sense-bases expand, afflictions grow. The eighteen elements transform and proliferate. This is not degeneration but ripening—the same process that will lead to liberation if known.

[317-328]
Forty-two days, water insects multiply—eighty-four thousand forms. Sixty-two channel-petals mark sixty-two eons. Each channel contains its letter, its light-sphere, its yabyum pair. The numbers are infinite because the mind's display is infinite. Yet all resolve in one recognition.

[318-328]
From Vajra Tip Play: one form, body's extent, thousand beyond number. The sky-body neither comes nor goes, neither fills nor empties. This is not philosophy—this is the body you have right now, if you would only look with eyes unclouded by grasping.

[319-328]
Seven days compress the basis. Seven days gather approach-accomplishment. The wisdoms are horse-wind—when body dissolves, they remain as light and movement. Letters, light, bodies—all rigpa's self-resonance, clearing outward, dissolving back into what never moved.
