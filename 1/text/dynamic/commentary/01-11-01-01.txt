[13104-13124] Between the mind and its objects, the gandharva seeks embodiment. Father and mother join in wisdom-space, essence meeting essence like mercury drops merging. The father's white essence, clear as quicksilver, enters the mother's red essence. In the womb, like blood and milk mixed, the body begins to form. This is the play of the four elements, the arising of existence from primordial space.

[13125-13145] Therefore. Thus. The support of the body's formation comes from the four elements, empty yet abiding like space. From the parents' self-nature afflictions and the channels' wind, desire-mind moves. The channel-abode's letter wind's sound YAM moves, fire desire blazes. From embracing and sense faculties joined, the earth stability of body experiences bliss. The SAM self-sound arises.

[13146-13165] The mother's lineage five channels twisted, the moon-time seven-day period becomes. Red, like an iron hook drawing, the wind power pulls the father's essence from the crown. Like iron gathering in a magnet, through twenty-eight vertebrae passed, the white channel-path emerges. For seven days four times in the mother's womb, the basis held and bodhicitta arises—this is the essential point.

[13166-13185] This old practitioner sees how life begins in confusion. At the vajra channel-base, great bliss path opens. At the navel, bliss pours into the sheep-like. At the tip, bliss ripens. Directly emerging to the mouth, into the mother's lineage channel nose inside red tone absorbed. In the womb like blood and milk mixed, one absorbed into one, two lineages possessing. From lineage five's power, consciousness drawn inside.

[13186-13205] Three words. See what is. Rest. Later, free from attachment, going by vomit. The mother whatever lineage pulling-possessing, to bliss contentment not-knowing is. From desire-attachment cause-condition arisen. Desire and attachment two held as cause and condition. Existence body's basis wind holds. Cause-condition two non-dual known, bliss and great bliss result. Body and wisdom's result rolled.

[13206-13225] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! From the mother's womb one night's night, father-mother cause-condition two outer cause one becoming. Inside not-mixed, like a mustard seed in a ga'u abiding, until son wind-mind held abiding. The four elements binding-cause vajra-like jewel-shell binding, separation no opportunity made. Body complete time, food element not, life not abiding—from that arisen.

[13226-13245] Between formation and dissolution, the elements play. At that time, elements wind body held, that inside wind up-blown power up-arising. Like mercury drops upward, flickering abiding. Body complete time, body-mind sudden condition whatever arisen, bright-aware body trembling essential point. Then second day, earth one compressed, weight pressed, son that crown pressed just suffering existing.

[13246-13265] Therefore. Thus. At this time, body's cause flesh just ripened just held. Condition channel just water just grown. Delusion cause-condition two non-dual. Non-conceptual wisdom liberated, great perfection acceptance-rejection beyond essential point. Above body's cause dried just, blood just becoming, condition water just cause just flowing down.

[13266-13285] Resting in the formation process, we see wisdom. Then again third day, wind-mind cause-condition with that dust-fine just burned. Fire red furnace entered just, suffering experienced. This time, body's cause wind just before. Condition foot just down just twisted. Then fourth day, that wind mercury dust-fine scattered. Chopper limbs piece carried suffering just.

[13286-13305] This old practitioner sees the suffering of formation. That from hatred arisen. That above body body's cause dust-fine ripened, condition radiant clear made. Outside four elements action done. Inside elements four held. Body complete time, outside sun-moon season four. Inside day-night evening four activity. That essential point, four empowerments' transformation showing.

[13306-13325] Then fourth day's time, pervading water channels clear moving inside. From that, directions four water-earth, fire and wind channels trembling and shaking. Coiling inside letter KHAM green and red and yellow three channels those with harmonious trembling and shaking and coiling abiding. Sheep complete mind movement much—from that arisen.

[13326-13345] Three words. See what is. Rest. Those four center, life called, stretched-thong like abiding. That life called. Time called. Occasion called. From that abiding and increasing-decreasing doing. That straight abiding, long life. Body ripened, earth fallen time, sound A YU famous. Life-thread left coiled, life obstacle arises. Born just-after, KHAM sound famous.

[13346-13365] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! Downward bent, short life. Born just-after, sound A KRIM arises. From treatises: life is life warmth and consciousness support whatever. Thus here explained. Then fifth day water clear body held. Generating action done. Inside that, letter SUM yellow clear shining possessing. Migrating beings' voice tone relying, arising.

[13366-13385] Between the days of formation, consciousness develops. That directions four earth and water and fire and wind channels held and gathered and upper inside SUM white and red and green those with harmonious abiding. Walking-sleeping-sitting-activity four from that arisen. Then sixth day, fire and wind two joined, body formation and destruction action done.

[13386-13405] Therefore. Thus. This time, fire channels blazing blazing inside letter RAM very clear flickering abiding. Migrating beings' consciousness sharp and dull distinction these clear not-clear by distinguished. Directions four inside inner four elements channels grown and blazing and burning inside. RAM producing and RUM empty and RAM resting sign possessing abiding.

[13406-13425] Resting in the process, we understand the mechanism. Migrating beings' mindfulness wheel relying, arising. Thus six completed, elements that action function formation support made, abiding. Thus four not-done, outside four relying food clothes power not. Inside dharmas four group not-becoming. Secret four empowerments' result not-ripened. Four formation support definitely.

[13426-13431] This old practitioner sees the complete picture. Then two-two days, elements two-two actions body basis held. Male-female two joined seed growing becoming like. Elements male-female joined body gathering growing. Also seventh day, elements four taste-one becoming. Cause-condition wind-mind four, flesh-blood-heat-breath four, channels four, letters four, nur-nur-form one becoming.

[13104-13104] All-gathered gathering with made. Wind channels up-clear moving inside YAM moving rope-like abiding. From that, migrating beings' breath going-coming and empty becoming. From that earth wind channels up-fallen and water's gathering-growth and fire's mode-action three inside YAM pile-divide. YE divide-gather. OM roll-bow-abide.

[13104-13104] Three words. See what is. Rest. Letters four center, form aggregate basis dust-fine abiding. Perception aggregate basis heat horse-ear empty cool portion just abiding. Feeling aggregate basis mindfulness life-thread three-parts coiled just abiding. Consciousness basis knowable color movement just abiding. Formation basis feeling-taste door-opening like abiding.

[13104-13104] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! Thus cause elements action actually done, five aggregates basis and. That condition gathering from formation done. Those five outside, color-five shell-light-rays coiled like. Abiding inside basis five heads JRI KHAM TAM MAM BYAM five adorned. Five aggregates five families Buddha essential point. OM JRI AM KHAM HUM TAM SVA MAM HA PYAM those.

[13104-13104] Therefore. Thus. Abiding transformation just, rigpa definite Buddha becoming definite. Thus water channels four each inside basis-abide wisdom three face not-divided not-divided division not. Body young seed six-thousand cool portion face-arms clear, color-five sphere possessing self-life form pure letter with. Nirvana basis holding, basis-abide wisdom called.

[13104-13104] Between the channels, wisdom abides. Earth channels four characteristic-holding wisdom five not-divided not-divided abiding. Light white-yellow-red-green-blue five thig-le mustard seed six-thousand cool just abiding. Those each light-five five beautiful around—Buddha path light-five arisen. Also each lineage color characteristic-holding. Characteristic-holding wisdom called.

[13104-13104] Resting in the body's wisdom channels, we find the kayas. Fire channels four inside consciousness-gathered basis-abide, light pillar holding consciousness gathered green abiding, action wind change. Past consciousness wisdom light-white pillar star-like abiding. Dharmata primordial-pure, action and latencies not-stained essential point. Also cyclic-existence consciousness just gathered abiding. Consciousness-gathered wisdom called.

[13104-13104] This old practitioner sees the complete mandala. Wind channels four knowing-object wisdom two not-conceptual mind abiding. Also light essence gathered red self-purpose realized abiding.

[13104-13104] Therefore. Thus. Then two seven-day periods, elements action above like done. First channel-wheel eleven days gathering water channels eight inside. Letter and light and Samantabhadra father-mother body with. Channels growing basis arisen. Those channels action wind moving trembling from. Channels eight arisen, elements male-four female-four pulling consciousness eight basis.

Lower-upper lotus petals spread like abiding. Then fourteen days, all-basis support four measure abiding those mer-mer-form becoming time. Water insect generating basis.

[13104-13104] This old practitioner sees the intricacies. Fine and change-knowing and shedding and karma-acting insects four body becoming. Those inside also. Channels and so forth support previous like formed. One body life immeasurable abiding. These control body called. Buddha body father-mother two-two not-abiding, body-less called, actual-form not.

[13104-13104] From Vajra Tip Play: form one body's extent. Grasping extent not-established extent. Thousand number beyond abiding. That sky body from. Entering action abandoned. Form extent dust-fine space know. Thus. Those insects each desire-action wind each abiding, migrating beings all desire-action near-taking—from that arisen.

[01-11-01-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
