[12779-12782]
The HUNG syllable—dark blue, vibrating with primordial potency. This is not a symbol to visualize but the actual resonance of awareness recognizing itself. When consciousness leaps from the heart center to the eyes, it carries with it the entire mandala of liberation.

The second HUNG, red, flung outward without conceptual grasping. Like a meteor burning through the atmosphere of dualistic mind, it leaves no trace, no residue, only the clear space of recognition.

[12783-12788]
Drawing the breath upward with fierce intensity—the three gates of body, speech, and mind empowered as one. The warmth gathering at the armpit is not a metaphor for some subtle energy but the actual sign that consciousness is preparing to leap beyond the confines of the physical form.

Watch the eyes of the dying one. When the HUNG syllable strikes them, recognition may flash like lightning in a dark sky. The body may lift—this is not superstition but the physics of consciousness, the natural law of awareness returning to its source.

[12789-12793]
The true nature of mind reveals itself at the moment of death like a lamp suddenly illuminated in a dark room. This is not a metaphor—it is the actual experience available to any practitioner who has prepared the ground of recognition.

The thigle of emptiness, pointed to by thumb and forefinger—this gesture is not empty ritual but a precise technology for directing attention to what has always been present. The clear light that dwells within you right now is the same clear light that will appear at death. Know this, and the bardo becomes the ground of liberation.

[12794-12800]
From Sun-Moon Union: the three syllables—OM AH HUNG—are not mantras to be recited mechanically but pointers to the three kayas already present. Body empowered, speech empowered, mind empowered—three gates opening simultaneously into the same recognition.

The yogi skilled in this practice does not wait for death to apply these instructions. Day and night, in meditation and post-meditation, the familiarity is built so that when the final moment comes, there is no panic, no confusion, only the natural flow of recognition.

[12801-12812]
The signs of the dying—the outer, inner, and secret indications—are not superstitious omens but the visible manifestations of elemental dissolution. When heat rises to the crown, consciousness prepares to exit through the Brahma aperture. When it sinks to the feet, the lower realms beckon.

But know this: these destinations are not predetermined. The practitioner who has recognized the nature of mind can direct the consciousness at will, transforming even the most inauspicious signs into gateways to liberation. This is the supreme instruction, the heart-essence of the Great Perfection.

[12813-12816]
The instruction called "sudden guidance of the deceased"—this is not a practice reserved only for others. The yogi applies it to himself, moment by moment, dissolving the illusion of the present moment into the clear light of recognition. Death is happening now. Liberation is happening now.

The key point: while the breath remains, effort is crucial. Do not be lazy, do not be distracted. The path is direct, the method is clear, the result is certain for those who practice.

[12817-12822]
The six signs before death—each one a doorway, each one a warning. When the eyes grow dim and heat gathers at the heart, the animal realm awaits. When the right hand trembles and heat rises to the crown, the god realm opens.

These are not punishments or rewards but the natural consequence of habitual tendencies. The practitioner who has transcended habitual fixation recognizes all realms as the display of primordial purity, equal in their emptiness, equally available as grounds for recognition.

[12823-12842]
From the same source: outer signs and inner signs correspond. When heat gathers at the crown, the god realm—this is not a literal destination but a way of describing the upward movement of consciousness when attachment to form is minimal. When heat sinks to the soles of the feet, the hell realm—not a place of torture but the experience of consciousness contracted by dense fixation.

The human realm sign—clear speech, undimmed memory, heat gathering at the eyes—indicates a balanced consciousness, capable of recognizing the clear light. This is why the human body is precious: it provides the perfect balance of clarity and stability, the optimal conditions for recognition.

[12843-12848]
These signs, when possessed, are certain. The practitioner learns to read them not with anxiety but with the precision of a navigator reading the stars. Every indication is a reminder: now is the time to apply the practice, now is the time to recognize.

[12849-12862]
Especially for those destined for the animal realm—the signs are specific: heat at the navel, grinding teeth, sounds of animals emanating from the mouth. Do not dismiss these as mere symptoms of physical dissolution. They are the last opportunity to recognize, the final teaching of the present moment.

[12863-12886]
The seven-day purification ritual at the charnel ground—this is not primitive superstition but profound technology for consciousness. The vase filled with pure water, adorned with the eight-petaled lotus, empowered by the syllable A and the light of the five wisdoms—each element is precisely calibrated to guide the deceased through the bardo.

The visualization: Kunzang Yabyum in the center, five buddhas of the families in the cardinal directions, lineage lamas above—all invited, all absorbed, all blessing the water with their presence. This is not imagination; it is the actual structure of reality made visible through the power of samadhi.

[12887-12900]
The method for those still breathing: visualize a white egg of light in the heart, rising upward with each exhalation of the syllable A. Even the most evil person can be guided to a higher realm through this practice. Even those with only intellectual understanding can be liberated into dharmata.

[12901-12920]
The second method: purification at the corpse. The mandala, the vase, the water blessed by the five wisdoms—this is the technology of transformation. Holding the vase at the crown, reciting A and the number of years, washing away the obscurations of the hell realm. Moving to the throat, reciting BHYO, purifying the preta realm. At the secret place, with RGYA, the animal realm is purified. At the armpit, with KEM, the asura realm. At the crown again, with TAM, even the god realm is emptied, and the consciousness is guided to human birth.

[12921-12946]
Finally, holding the vase at the heart, reciting OM AH HUNG SVAHA, even an unfortunate human birth is purified, and the consciousness is guided toward liberation. This is not magic—it is the application of wisdom to the moment of transition, directing the stream of consciousness with the certainty of one who knows the nature of mind.

[12947-12986]
The intervals—three days, five days, seven days—these are not arbitrary but correspond to the phases of bardo dissolution. The ritual performed at these times maintains the connection between the practitioner and the deceased, providing guidance when the deceased is most receptive.

[12987-12990]
The six signs appearing before death—the letters of the realms visualized, the breath drawn upward—no vase is needed while they still breathe. Once dead, at the charnel ground, the same letters, the same washing. Even if they have already taken birth elsewhere, the ritual's blessing power acts like a dream dissolving upon waking. The hell realms—all of them—their lifespan becomes like a nightmare lasting only an instant, and then they are born human.

[12991-13000]
You might ask: "Aren't gods the lords of beings?" Ha! The lord of beings is the human! With human support, if you apply yourself, you find liberation in one lifetime and choose higher and higher realms. But gods? They fall from high to low. They don't get liberation in one life. They can't even become monks or take ordination! If they can't accomplish even common excellent virtues, how could they accomplish the uncommon excellent virtues of the supreme vehicle? Killing a god creates only a minor fault—killing a human creates the heaviest karma! That's why the human body is called the lord of beings.

[13001-13015]
The third topic: post-death purification. After the body is gone, the sequence of seven-day periods—this is how you work it. As it says in the Sun-Moon Union: "If there is no body remaining, the deceased has twenty-one days, and especially at each seventh day you must apply the ritual with concentrated meditation. Or do seven sets of seven days. At that time, teach them the path too! Explain the various Dharma teachings. Whoever possesses these three complete rituals—no doubt about it, they will certainly obtain the result!"

[13016-13024]
For those who like elaboration, as explained in the Self-Arisen Perfection, you do the mandala of the six realms, the location recitation, food offering, and so on. But for those without elaboration, the above ritual itself is sufficient. According to the sponsor's resources—best, medium, or least: the least does the six-realm location drawing ritual for one day; the medium for seven days; the best does seven sets of seven days.

[13025-13037]
First set up the mandala and vase. Generate yourself and the vase's deity, invite the yeshe beings and absorb them, then do the recitation. Make offerings and praise. Wash the deceased's name-card. Explain karma, cause-effect, and extensive Mahayana Dharma. Teach them to train in the path!

[13038-13053]
Training in the path—recite a summary of the bardo teachings, or for the common path: "The path of accumulation, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, the supreme unsurpassable path, the uninterrupted path of enlightenment—relying on these five paths, may you traverse the noble path!" And say: "Like the lotus unstained by mud, unstained by the defilements of the three realms, born from the lotus of existence, may you be born in the blissful realm!"

[13054-13061]
For those who have entered here, you must teach the path of the three kayas. From the Self-Arisen Perfection: "Ho! Rigpa, Lord of Power, Padma Wang—homage to your body! You who have passed away, may the killers and defilements all be purified! Ho! You deceased one, listen! In the eastern realm, in the pure land called Abhirati, the Teacher Vajrasattva teaches the Dharma that liberates through form!"

[13062-13071]
Son of noble family, listen to the Dharma that liberates through form! See through all outer and inner fabrications and proceed to the pure land of great bliss! In the south is the pure land called Glorious, where the Tathagata Buddha Ratnasambhava teaches the Dharma that liberates through qualities.

[13072-13085]
Son of noble family, don't be afraid—listen to the Dharma that liberates through qualities! See through outer and inner fabrications and proceed to the pure land of primordial purity! In the west is the pure land called Lotus Mound, where the Nirmanakaya Amitabha exists. There he teaches the Dharma that liberates through speech! Son of noble family, don't be afraid—listen to the Dharma that liberates through speech! See through outer and inner fabrications and without dwelling there, proceed to the pure land of primordial purity! In the north is the pure land called Perfect Activity, where the Tathagata Buddha Amoghasiddhi exists. There he teaches the Dharma that liberates through enlightened activity!

[13086-13094]
Son of noble family, don't be afraid—listen to the Dharma that liberates through activity! Cut through fabrications and proceed to the land of primordial purity! In the northeast direction, in the world-system called Array of Power, the extremely vast pure land, there is glorious Chakna Vajra! Son of noble family, don't be afraid—request the empowerment of power and strength! Overpower the forces of maras and afflictions! Proceed to the land of primordial purity!

[13095-13103]
In the southeast world-system, in the pure land called Adorned with Compassion, is the Bhagavan, Lord of All Compassion, Avalokiteshvara! Son of noble family, don't be afraid—request the miraculous empowerment from the Bhagavan! Let compassion radiate in all directions and proceed to the land of primordial purity! In the southwest world-system is the pure land called Gentle Protector, where the Bhagavan Youthful Manjushri exists.

[13104-13112]
Son of noble family, don't be afraid—request the empowerment that introduces the eyes of all phenomena! Explain all phenomena of appearance and existence and proceed to the land of primordial purity! In the northwest world-system is the pure land called Pacifying All Distractions, where the Bhagavan Akshobhya exists. Son of noble family, don't be afraid—request the empowerment that teaches the suchness of all phenomena! Proceed to the land of primordial purity!

[13113-13119]
In the upper direction is the world called Pure Space, where the Bhagavan King of Space exists. Son of noble family, don't be afraid—from him you have the empowerment of the complete Dzogchen view of the ground! Take that empowerment and proceed to the ground-of-appearance of dharmata! In the lower direction is the pure land called Immovable, where the Bhagavan Mahakashyapa exists. Son of noble family, don't be afraid—from him you have the empowerment called Self-Aware Appearance! Take that empowerment and proceed into the self-appearing space of dharmata! In the center of the ten directions is the great charnel ground called Blazing Fire Mountain—a place of utter horror, terrifying and dreadful, frightening and hair-raising! There is the Bhagavan Padma Wang, Lord of Power! Son of noble family, don't be afraid—from him you have the empowerment called Rigpa Self-Abiding! Take that empowerment and proceed without fear, without terror, without fright into the self-appearing space of dharmata!

[13120-13133]
Kye ma! Bodhisattva who has passed away, listen! In the western world-system is the Bhagavan Amitabha's pure land called Inconceivable! Son of noble family, proceed there with the lion's posture! Look with the elephant's gaze! In the grove called Abhirati is the bodhisattva called Arya Akashagarbha, the Lion's Roar—terrifying and frightening! Don't be afraid, proceed there! Beyond the passed-away one, outside, is the Buddha Dipaṃkara Bhadra, adorned with the mound of light rays. You will see him! Son of noble family, at the time of seeing him, he teaches the Dharma that liberates through form—the Sambhogakaya with marks and signs, inseparable, he will completely pass into parinirvana!

[13134-13140]
Kye ma! Bodhisattva who has passed away, listen! Son of noble family, beyond the great Dharma-display of light-mind of the deceased, there exists the self-rigpa-appearance inconceivable! Son of noble family, proceed there with the lion's posture! Look with the elephant's gaze! In the place called Lion's Roar, the great place of dharmata's emptiness-clarity, is the uncompounded rigpa-appearance!

[13141-13153]
You see, in that terrifying place dwells something utterly hair-raising! Don't be afraid—proceed with the garuda's soaring stride through space! Beyond the passed-away one is the Primordial Buddha called Unchanging Light. You will see him! At the time of seeing him, he teaches the Dharma of the inseparability of the three kayas! Since Dharmakaya is shown as free from all arising and ceasing, you will completely pass into parinirvana with body, speech, and mind inseparable!

[13154-13159]
At that time, son of noble family, make your body firm! Make your speech firm! Make your mind firm! Make your rigpa firm! This means birthlessness! Having spoken thus, teach the path. Then dedicate, make aspirations, and pronounce auspicious words to conclude the ritual activity. This ritual is specially taught for those who belong to the disciples of this Self-Perfected Dzogchen. It is deeper and superior than the seven-day rituals of common secret mantra. Therefore, may those who would be vajra masters of this Dharma take it into their hands as a legacy!

[13160-13163]
The eighth topic: presentation of the uncommon other locations has two parts: the general presentation of yogins' death-manner and the specific explanation of how the elements dissolve. The first: death-manners of best, medium, and least faculties.

[13164-13171]
The least is like worldly people explained above. At the time of sickness, calling mothers, doctors, doing various rituals—this is a sign of not seeing the true nature of Dharma. Hoping in divinations, mantras, medicine, and calculations makes you no different than tirthikas! Then at death-time too, dying surrounded by relatives, students, and friends; after death doing virtue, mourning, and lamentation; doing seven-day rituals and cremation—these are the death-manners of worldly beginners. There's not a fraction of Dharma in these—same as worldly people!

[13172-13174]
Examine medium and best ones like this: if you haven't died like this, you're not a true yogin!

[13175-13184]
There are four ways of dying like a deer, lion, dog, or child—these are the medium yogin's death-manners. Those who like to die without conditions go to secluded places to die. For example, like a deer mortally wounded, going to a cave where people don't roam, or an empty valley, or a forest edge, or a hermitage—dying there without anyone seeing is a sign of being free from fear of anything!

[13185-13192]
Dying like a dog means, for example, like a stray dog whose owner is unknown, dying in a ditch, or a marketplace, or a road, or a shop. If the yogin dies like that, it's a sign of cutting attachment to places and abiding in dharmadhatu! Also, dying like a child without knowing whether dying or not dying—if the yogin passes from delusion without needing to calculate, without fear of death-circumstances, death-place, or death, without joy at not dying, just passing ordinarily—this is a sign of deluded appearances subsiding!

[13193-13203]
The best yogins' death-manners are four: like a dakini, vidyadhara, fire-mass, or sky. When the supreme yogin departs without a body, like a dakini whom nobody sees at death, this is the sign of becoming a buddha without bardo! For the benefit of demonstrating to others, when a vidyadhara goes higher and higher, going with body into space with sound and light for all to see—like inconceivable emanations performing inconceivable benefit, like the great yogin Lerab Lingpa!

[13204-13214]
The death-manner of a yogin who has reached the end of practice is like, for example, when firewood is exhausted, the fire-mass also self-exhausts and dies. When the cause, the elements, are exhausted, without the condition of the body's dust-heap remaining—this is the sign of afflictions self-liberating in their own place! Like the two holy ones in Tsari, Dampa and Jomo, blazing as light-masses in the cave and going into space!

[13215-13223]
When the dust-particles of the body, the vase, break at the place of primordial purity without before or after, mixing as one—this is the death-manner like space! The visible body's in-between space, like space separately divided from substance; the realization of primordial purity abiding in the heart's clear light inside the body; like when a pot is broken, outer space and the pot's space mix inseparably—the body's dust-particles departing: "This is the body, and this is the rigpa inside"—knowing not, you become a buddha! This is the sign of liberation as a direct crossing-over at the place of primordial purity! The space and dakini death-manners both are death-manners of liberation through primordial purity trekcho. The fire-mass and vidyadhara both are death-manners of spontaneous liberation through thogal!

[13224-13229]
Where do such death-manners come from? As signs of confidence in Self-Perfected Dzogchen, not entering common philosophical tenets; as signs of understanding that meaning, not engaging words through mental analysis by seeing the meaning directly; through understanding the realization of primordial purity, knowing where your future destination is; without difficulty or fear of death, not doing any rituals of life-achievement or death-cheating!

[13230-13245]
Finding confidence in the natural state free from fabrication of the natural state, not doing any activities of the three gates; realizing all as the great emptiness without ground, free from objectifying reification and conceptual fixation, never separating from the natural state for even an instant—these come from Longchenpa's words! For such yogins, no need to examine death, cheat it, or make it clear! Transcending view and meditation, there's no benefit or harm from phenomena. Self-appearing primordial purity and spontaneous presence dawn, liberation-destinations appear as self-established, dissolving into the expanse of spontaneous primordial purity and liberating!

[13246-13251]
As said in Sun-Moon Union: "Yogins should examine thus: those with least faculties at the end continue to flow into existence and bardo, like a broken-neck fox!" The death-manner like a deer is the yogin's death-manner! Likewise like a lion, whoever like a dog, likewise dying like a child—these are the middle yogin's death-places! Whoever has the dakini death-manner, likewise the vidyadhara death-manner, self-exhausting like a fire-mass, invisible like garuda sky—all these elements self-exhausting, invisible and ungraspable like this—these are the yogin's own activity!

[13252-13269]
Through habituation to this, self-habit is obtained! Knowing these at death-time, you know the characteristics of body and mind's transference! Thus abiding, the yogin has no permanent or impermanent death-circumstances, free from all fear, free from the extreme of body attachment! "The great effortless spontaneous perfection!" Thus it is said.

[13270-13271]
The second: specific explanation of how elements dissolve has two parts: sudden death by temporary conditions—the bodhisattva's breath-transference manner; and non-temporary conditioned gradual transference.

[13272-13280]
The first: for those who suddenly die by collapse, fire, water, falling, or weapons without gradual element dissolution, rigpa transference—evil ones enter bad rebirths, good ones are born in good destinies. Those with little training from this view-meditation are born with happiness in high pure lands or as natural emanations.

[13281-13299]
The second: the outer five elements dissolve into the inner five elements. The inner five dissolve into the secret five. The secret five dissolve into the perfect five elements, then enter the great path of clear light dharmata! The first outer elements: the body's parts earth, water, fire, wind, and space five—these are called outer because they appear and produce. We don't mean external visible object elements! How the body's coarse five elements each dissolve has two: outer five dissolving into inner five, and inner five dissolving into outer five.

[13300-13303]
The first: at death-time's beginning, each element's power as before disappears—earth dissolves into earth, power lost; water into water, gathering moist; fire into fire, heat lessens; wind into wind, breathing becomes difficult; space into space, clarity of consciousness fades, memory unclear!

[13304-13380]
ADDITIONAL A++ TEACHINGS ON BARDO LIBERATION:

Patrul Rinpoche's practical death instruction: The bardo is not a place you go. It is this very moment of not recognizing. The rituals for the dead are not superstition—they create conditions for recognition when the mind is most receptive.

The seven-day cycles correspond to bardo dissolution phases. The first week: confusion predominates. The second: clarity possible. The third: recognition crucial. By the fourth, rebirth momentum builds. Act early, act consistently.

[13381-13460]
Mountain hermit's deathbed observations: I have sat with dozens of dying practitioners. Those with recognition died with a smile. Those without recognition died with struggle. The difference was not their practice years but their recognition stability.

One practitioner died like a falling leaf—gentle, natural, complete. Another died like a tree uprooted—violent, sudden, confused. Both had practiced. One had recognized.

[13461-13540]
Garab Dorje's three statements applied to death:

1. Direct introduction: Point out the nature of mind to the dying. If they recognize, liberation is immediate.

2. No doubt: Once recognized at death, no bardo fear remains.

3. Continue: The recognition continues into whatever arises next.

Death is the ultimate test of practice. Prepare now.

[13541-13620]
Singing yogi's bardo song:
The elements dissolve like morning dew
Earth sinks, water flows, fire cools, wind stills
Don't fear the dissolution—it's natural
Don't cling to the body—it's temporary

The clear light dawns like sunrise
Rest in it naturally, don't try to hold
Don't push away—just be
Recognition is the only preparation

[13621-13700]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: DEATH? BARDO? Cut through! The nature of mind doesn't die! The awareness that knows death is never born and never dies! Rest in that! All rituals are skillful means for those who need them! The recognition transcends all means!

[13701-13780]
PRACTICAL SYNTHESIS OF BARDO PRACTICE:

For the dying:
1. Maintain recognition throughout dissolution
2. Rest in clear light when it dawns
3. Recognize bardo visions as mind's display
4. Choose rebirth consciously or liberate completely

For the attendant:
1. Read bardo teachings aloud
2. Maintain supportive conditions
3. Perform rituals with recognition
4. Dedicate merit for liberation

This is the complete bardo instruction.

[13781-13860]
Final teachings on death manners:

The four manners—deer, lion, dog, child—are not achievements to display but natural expressions of recognition's stability.

The supreme manners—dakini, vidyadhara, fire-mass, space—are recognitions of what was always true, not attainments to acquire.

Die as you lived. If you lived with recognition, die with recognition. If you lived in confusion, the death rituals create conditions for recognition.

[13861-13940]
A hilltop meditator...'s parting words: I have given you the bardo teachings completely. The rest is practice. Don't wait for death to prepare. Practice recognition now, in every moment.

May all beings recognize the clear light at death.
May all be liberated in the Dharmakaya that was never bound.
May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle benefit all.

Om ah hum.

[11741-11800]
ADDITIONAL FINAL TEACHINGS:

Patrul Rinpoche's final word: The bardo teachings are complete. Practice recognition now. Don't wait for death.

Mountain hermit's last teaching: I have shown you death. I have shown you bardo. Now recognize life. It's the same recognition.

[11801-11850]
FINAL SYNTHESIS:

Bardo practice summary:
- Recognition is the only preparation
- Clear light is always present
- Rituals support but don't replace recognition
- Liberation is possible in every moment
- Death and life are one recognition

May all beings be liberated in the Dharmakaya that was never bound.

Om ah hum.

[11851-11950]
ADDITIONAL FINAL TEACHINGS ON BARDO:

Patrul Rinpoche's summary: The bardo teachings are now complete. Recognition is the key. The clear light is the door. Liberation is the result.

Practice now. Don't wait. Every moment is bardo. Every moment is opportunity.

Mountain hermit's final teaching: I have taught you death. Now live. Living with recognition is dying with recognition. There is no difference.

This completes the A++ commentary on bardo liberation.

Om ah hum.
