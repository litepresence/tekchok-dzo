[12779-12780]
The destination is beyond all display—the primordial purity of your own awareness. The nature is complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[12779-12800]
Emaho! What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[12781-12805]
When you rest in that primordial purity, there is nothing more to do, nowhere to go, nothing to achieve. You are already complete, already perfect, already awakened. This is the great secret.

[12801-12820]
arise from previous karma; this life's karma produces future's appearance. Those who did bad karma before have incomplete faculties, crippled limbs, ugly form, dependent on others here.

Those who accumulated good karma

[12806-12830]
May all beings who encounter these teachings recognize their own nature and achieve liberation. May the light of wisdom dawn in all hearts. May the benefits of this practice spread throughout the ten directions.

Emaho!

[12821-12850]
have clear faculties, beautiful form, pleasing to see, wealth, enjoyments, always self-controlled and powerful. Future birth too depends on present's good-bad conduct.

Those gathering collections, practicing generosity, ethics, etc.

[12831-12855]
These pages contain the profound teachings on thod rgal—the direct transcendence practice of the great perfection. From the initial introduction to the final signs of realization, the path has been laid out for those fortunate ones with the karma to practice.

[12851-12880]
, are born in happy realms' higher worlds with high status. Those patient, faithful dwell beautiful, heroic, central lands, honored by all, unharmed by others.

Previously respectful to gurus

[12856-12880]
The key points to remember: the displays of light are your own awareness, not external objects. The four visions mark your progress. The signs of realization confirm your path. Obstacles are recognized and dissolved in the nature (rang bzhin) of mind.

[12881-12905]
Practice with devotion to the lama, with confidence in the teachings, and with recognition of your own nature. These three are the supports for the path.

[12881-12900]
—now meeting true gurus, practicing Dharma, born in good lands with all desires. This is the treasury's heart.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Previously respectful to Three Jewels

[12901-12920]
—now well-ordained, celibate life complete, practicing sublime vehicle Dharma. The nature is complete.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Previously trained in hearing, contemplating, meditating

[12906-12930]
Do not be lazy, do not be distracted, do not be discouraged. The path is direct and swift for those who practice sincerely.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. The result is certain for those who persist.

[12921-12950]
—now great wisdom, Dharma topics immeasurable, hearing-contemplating-meditating accomplishing self and others' benefit. Those who did evil—born in lower realms, even higher realms have incomplete faculties, little merit, suffering.

Emaho!

[12931-12955]
May these teachings bring benefit to all who encounter them. May the lineage of the great perfection continue unbroken. May all beings achieve the state of Samantabhadra.

[12951-12970]
: previous life's actions, present life's body-mind patterns know; future birth where, present's conduct depends. Samadhiraja Sutra: "Previous actions—look at present body; future where—look at present mind."

Thus thinking

[12970-12986]
Listen here, you who would guide the dead! This wisdom-water of great equality—pour it forth like a waterfall that doesn't choose where it falls. That vase at the armpit? It's not some fancy ritual object to polish. It's the gateway where consciousness can slip through, cleansed by the streaming water of yeshe. You wash away the god realms, empty them out completely, and even they obtain the happy state of human birth. Don't you see? This isn't about magic—it's about directing the stream of consciousness with certainty!

[12971-12990]
, abandon non-virtue, practice virtue, always rest mind in sublime Dharma—nothing else can help! Daughter Jewel Sutra: "Here father, mother, relatives, friends, dependents cannot be refuge; sons, daughters not saviors. Without virtues, no other world-protector exists."

Advice to King

[12981-13000]
Emaho! The marvelous! The wondrous! The natural great perfection!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Emaho!

[12987-12991]
When the six signs appear before death, you visualize the letters of those realms and draw the breath upward—no vase needed while they're still breathing! But once dead, at the charnel ground, you visualize those same letters and wash with the vase. Even if they've already taken birth elsewhere, the ritual's blessing power acts like a dream that dissolves upon waking. The hell realms, all of them—their lifespan becomes like a nightmare that lasts only an instant, a moment, a finger-snap, and then they're born human!

[12991-13010]
: "Time comes, king must go; enjoyments, friends, relatives won't accompany. Rest in this understanding.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was. Wherever beings go, karma follows like shadow."

Second

[12992-13000]
Now you might ask: "Aren't gods the lords of beings?" Ha! The lord of beings is the human! With human support, if you apply yourself, you find liberation in one lifetime and choose higher and higher realms. But gods? They fall from high to low. They don't get liberation in one life. They can't even become monks or take ordination! If they can't accomplish even common excellent virtues, how could they accomplish the uncommon excellent virtues of the supreme vehicle? Killing a god creates only a minor fault—killing a human creates the heaviest karma! That's why the human body is called the lord of beings.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[13001-13003]
The third topic: the post-death purification. After the body is gone, the sequence of seven-day periods—this is how you work it. As it says in the Sun-Moon Union:

Emaho! The human body—a precious vase filled with the nectar of immortality!

[13004-13015]
You there—if there is no body remaining, the deceased has twenty-one days, and especially at each seventh day you must apply the ritual with concentrated meditation. Or do seven sets of seven days. At that time, teach them the path too! Explain the various Dharma teachings. Whoever possesses these three complete rituals—no doubt about it, they will certainly obtain the result!

[13011-13030]
: contemplating certain death causes, always produce renunciation and weariness. Though impermanent, grasping permanence, attached to this life—confused beings! Fall into birth-death's river without knowing liberation; experience various sufferings without ceasing.

Separated from true spiritual friends

[13016-13024]
For those who like elaboration, as explained in the Self-Arisen Perfection, you do the mandala of the six realms, the location recitation, food offering, and so on. But for those without elaboration, the above ritual itself is sufficient. According to the sponsor's resources—best, medium, or least: the least does the six-realm location drawing ritual for one day; the medium for seven days; the best does seven sets of seven days.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. First set up the mandala and vase. Generate yourself and the vase's deity, invite the yeshe beings and absorb them, then do the recitation. Make offerings and praise. Wash the deceased's name-card. Explain karma, cause-effect, and extensive Mahayana Dharma. Teach them to train in the path!

[13025-13037]
The teaching of Dharma—you quote from the Vairochana Perfection: "In this world, omniscient ones appear rarely, like the udumvara flower—perhaps once in a hundred kalpas, or not at all." And so on. Or say: "You have seen the door of Dharma—complete whatever remains of the teaching!"

[13031-13050]
, no path-showing protector, Dharma-eye closed, wandering in ignorance darkness. Thinking thus, this difficult-to-obtain leisure, joyfully produce eager mind or practice Dharma.

Emaho!

[13038-13053]
Training in the path—recite a summary of the bardo teachings, or for the common path: "The path of accumulation, the path of preparation, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, the supreme unsurpassable path, the uninterrupted path of enlightenment—relying on these five paths, may you traverse the noble path!" And say: "Like the lotus unstained by mud, unstained by the defilements of the three realms, born from the lotus of existence, may you be born in the blissful realm!"

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Emaho! Twenty-one days to guide a soul home!

[13051-13080]
, attached to this life's appearances—confused beings! Fall into birth-death's river without liberation; experience sufferings without weariness. Without true friends, no path-showing protector; Dharma-eye closed in ignorance darkness.

Contemplating certain death

[13054-13061]
You say these words to those who have entered here! For them, you must teach the path of the three kayas. From the Self-Arisen Perfection: "Ho! Rigpa, Lord of Power, Padma Wang— homage to your body!" You who have passed away, may the killers and defilements all be purified! Ho! You deceased one, listen! In the eastern realm, in the pure land called Abhirati, the Teacher Vajrasattva teaches the Dharma that liberates through form!

[13062-13071]
Son of noble family, listen to the Dharma that liberates through form! See through all outer and inner fabrications and proceed to the pure land of great bliss! In the south is the pure land called Glorious, where the Tathagata Buddha Ratnasambhava teaches the Dharma that liberates through qualities.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. Son of noble family, don't be afraid—listen to the Dharma that liberates through qualities! See through outer and inner fabrications and proceed to the pure land of primordial purity!

[13072-13085]
In the west is the pure land called Lotus Mound, where the Nirmanakaya Amitabha exists. There he teaches the Dharma that liberates through speech! Son of noble family, don't be afraid—listen to the Dharma that liberates through speech! See through outer and inner fabrications and without dwelling there, proceed to the pure land of primordial purity! In the north is the pure land called Perfect Activity, where the Tathagata Buddha Amoghasiddhi exists.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. There he teaches the Dharma that liberates through enlightened activity! Son of noble family, don't be afraid—listen to the Dharma that liberates through activity!

Emaho! The five directions—five gates to liberation!

[13081-13100]
: though obtained difficult leisure, this four-element compound aggregate certainly disintegrates—conditioned nature. Like bubble-popping aggregate, when will this destroy? Now on this unbroken support, do I accomplish liberation's sublime Dharma?

This life's dream-illusion appearance

[13086-13094]
You there—cut through fabrications and proceed to the land of primordial purity! In the northeast direction, in the world-system called Array of Power, the extremely vast pure land, there is glorious Chakna Vajra! Son of noble family, don't be afraid—request the empowerment of power and strength! Overpower the forces of maras and afflictions! Proceed to the land of primordial purity!

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[13095-13103]
In the southeast world-system, in the pure land called Adorned with Compassion, is the Bhagavan, Lord of All Compassion, Avalokiteshvara! Son of noble family, don't be afraid—request the miraculous empowerment from the Bhagavan! Let compassion radiate in all directions and proceed to the land of primordial purity! In the southwest world-system is the pure land called Gentle Protector, where the Bhagavan Youthful Manjushri exists.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. Son of noble family, don't be afraid—request the empowerment that introduces the eyes of all phenomena! Explain all phenomena of appearance and existence and proceed to the land of primordial purity!

[13101-13120]
—what does it accomplish? Ratnakuta Tantra: "No seat to remain on conditioned forms; stable life, death-time certainly comes. Six collections' objects appearing—no permanence. Person's memory-thoughts-feelings inexhaustible. Body's arising suffering without clarity."

Thus though impermanent

[13104-13112]
In the northwest world-system is the pure land called Pacifying All Distractions, where the Bhagavan Akshobhya exists. Son of noble family, don't be afraid—request the empowerment that teaches the suchness of all phenomena! Proceed to the land of primordial purity! In the upper direction is the world called Pure Space, where the Bhagavan King of Space exists.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Son of noble family, don't be afraid—from him you have the empowerment of the complete Dzogchen view of the ground (gzhi)! Take that empowerment and proceed to the ground (gzhi)-of-appearance of dharmata!

Emaho! Eight directions, eight masters, eight doors to the nature (rang bzhin) of mind!

[13113-13119]
In the lower direction is the pure land called Immovable, where the Bhagavan Mahakashyapa exists. Son of noble family, don't be afraid—from him you have the empowerment called Self-Aware Appearance! Take that empowerment and proceed into the self-appearing space of dharmata! In the center of the ten directions is the great charnel ground called Blazing Fire Mountain—a place of utter horror, terrifying and dreadful, frightening and hair-raising! There is the Bhagavan Padma Wang, Lord of Power! Son of noble family, don't be afraid—from him you have the empowerment called Rigpa Self-Abiding! Take that empowerment and proceed without fear, without terror, without fright into the self-appearing space of dharmata!

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[13120-13133]
Kye ma! Bodhisattva who has passed away, listen! In the western world-system is the Bhagavan Amitabha's pure land called Inconceivable! Son of noble family, proceed there with the lion's posture! Look with the elephant's gaze! In the grove called Abhirati is the bodhisattva called Arya Akashagarbha, the Lion's Roar—terrifying and frightening! Don't be afraid, proceed there! Beyond the passed-away one, outside, is the Buddha Dipaṃkara Bhadra, adorned with the mound of light rays. You will see him! Son of noble family, at the time of seeing him, he teaches the Dharma that liberates through form—the Sambhogakaya with marks and signs, inseparable, he will completely pass into parinirvana!

[13121-13140]
, grasping permanence, attached to this life—I must not be thus! Whatever benefit to others, enemies tamed, lands taken, whatever done—all essenceless and deceptive. Look only at your own mind!

Mar-me-mdzad-ye-shes

[13134-13140]
Kye ma! Bodhisattva who has passed away, listen! Son of noble family, beyond the great Dharma-display of light-mind of the deceased, there exists the self-rigpa-appearance inconceivable! Son of noble family, proceed there with the lion's posture! Look with the elephant's gaze! In the place called Lion's Roar, the great place of dharmata's emptiness-clarity, is the uncompounded rigpa-appearance!

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Emaho! The charnel ground—most terrifying, most liberating!

[13141-13160]
stated: "Worldly conduct looking far—all done meaningless, suffering cause. Rest in this understanding.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Whatever thought doesn't benefit—accustom to looking at own mind!"

Emaho!

[13141-13153]
You see, in that terrifying place dwells something utterly hair-raising! Don't be afraid—proceed with the garuda's soaring stride through space! Beyond the passed-away one is the Primordial Buddha called Unchanging Light. You will see him! At the time of seeing him, he teaches the Dharma of the inseparability of the three kayas! Since Dharmakaya is shown as free from all arising and ceasing, you will completely pass into parinirvana with body, speech, and mind inseparable!

[13154-13159]
At that time, son of noble family, make your body firm! Make your speech firm! Make your mind firm! Make your rigpa firm! This means birthlessness! Having spoken thus, teach the path. Then dedicate, make aspirations, and pronounce auspicious words to conclude the ritual activity. This ritual is specially taught for those who belong to the disciples of this Self-Perfected Dzogchen. It is deeper and superior than the seven-day rituals of common secret mantra. Therefore, may those who would be vajra masters of this Dharma take it into their hands as a legacy!

[13160-13163]
The eighth topic: presentation of the uncommon other locations has two parts: the general presentation of yogins' death-manner and the specific explanation of how the elements dissolve. The first: death-manners of best, medium, and least faculties. The least is like worldly people explained above.

[13161-13180]
: conditioned things impermanent like dreams, illusions, etc. Intended Array: "Alas, conditioned things impermanent; born, disintegrating nature. Born then disintegrating—therefore quickly peaceful, happy."

Star, dewdrop, lamp, illusion

[13164-13171]
At the time of sickness, calling mothers, doctors, doing various rituals—this is a sign of not seeing the true nature of Dharma. Hoping in divinations, mantras, medicine, and calculations makes you no different than tirthikas! Then at death-time too, dying surrounded by relatives, students, and friends; after death doing virtue, mourning, and lamentation; doing seven-day rituals and cremation—these are the death-manners of worldly beginners.

Emaho! To die like a worldly person—surrounded by weeping!

[13172-13174]
There's not a fraction of Dharma in these—same as worldly people! Examine medium and best ones like this: if you haven't died like this, you're not a true yogin!

[13175-13184]
There are four ways of dying like a deer, lion, dog, or child—these are the medium yogin's death-manners. Those who like to die without conditions go to secluded places to die. For example, like a deer mortally wounded, going to a cave where people don't roam, or an empty valley, or a forest edge, or a hermitage—dying there without anyone seeing is a sign of being free from fear of anything!

[13181-13200]
, bubble, dream, lightning, cloud—conditioned things similar to these. Thus person's life span: uncertain, sudden, instantaneous—time cannot be grasped like this.

Extensive Play Sutra

[13185-13192]
Dying like a dog means, for example, like a stray dog whose owner is unknown, dying in a ditch, or a marketplace, or a road, or a shop. If the yogin dies like that, it's a sign of cutting attachment to places and abiding in dharmadhatu! Also, dying like a child without knowing whether dying or not dying—if the yogin passes from delusion without needing to calculate, without fear of death-circumstances, death-place, or death, without joy at not dying, just passing ordinarily—this is a sign of deluded appearances subsiding!

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[13193-13203]
The best yogins' death-manners are four: like a dakini, vidyadhara, fire-mass, or sky. When the supreme yogin departs without a body, like a dakini whom nobody sees at death, this is the sign of becoming a buddha without bardo! For the benefit of demonstrating to others, when a vidyadhara goes higher and higher, going with body into space with sound and light for all to see—like inconceivable emanations performing inconceivable benefit, like the great yogin Lerab Lingpa!

Emaho! Four ways to die—four gates to liberation!

[13201-13220]
: "Life impermanent like playful cloud; descending mountain waterfall, quickly swiftly goes." Recognition is immediate.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Intended Array

[13204-13214]
The death-manner of a yogin who has reached the end of practice is like, for example, when firewood is exhausted, the fire-mass also self-exhausts and dies. When the cause, the elements, are exhausted, without the condition of the body's dust-heap remaining—this is the sign of afflictions self-liberating in their own place! Like the two holy ones in Tsari, Dampa and Jomo, blazing as light-masses in the cave and going into space! When the dust-particles of the body, the vase, break at the place of primordial purity without before or after, mixing as one—this is the death-manner like space!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[13215-13223]
The visible body's in-between space, like space separately divided from substance; the realization of primordial purity abiding in the heart's clear light inside the body; like when a pot is broken, outer space and the pot's space mix inseparably—the body's dust-particles departing: "This is the body, and this is the rigpa inside"—knowing not, you become a buddha! This is the sign of liberation as a direct crossing-over at the place of primordial purity! The space and dakini death-manners both are death-manners of liberation through primordial purity trekcho.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. The fire-mass and vidyadhara both are death-manners of spontaneous liberation through thogal!

[13221-13240]
: some die in womb, some just born, some running, some old, some young, some in youth—what confidence have the living? Recognition is immediate.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Thus thinking impermanence

[13224-13229]
Where do such death-manners come from? As signs of confidence in Self-Perfected Dzogchen, not entering common philosophical tenets; as signs of understanding that meaning, not engaging words through mental analysis by seeing the meaning directly; through understanding the realization of primordial purity, knowing where your future destination is; without difficulty or fear of death, not doing any rituals of life-achievement or death-cheating!

Emaho! To die like space—without a trace!

[13230-13245]
Finding confidence in the natural state free from fabrication of the natural state, not doing any activities of the three gates; realizing all as the great emptiness without ground, free from objectifying reification and conceptual fixation, never separating from the natural state for even an instant—these come from Longchenpa's words! For such yogins, no need to examine death, cheat it, or make it clear! Transcending view and meditation, there's no benefit or harm from phenomena. Self-appearing primordial purity and spontaneous presence dawn, liberation-destinations appear as self-established, dissolving into the expanse of spontaneous primordial purity and liberating!

[13241-13260]
, quickly certain to die, this life's business—attachment-aversion, fighting, laziness, hoarding, great desire, factionalism, taming enemies, hearing without applying, all talk with spiritual friends—what use? This is the treasury's heart.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Generally speaking

[13246-13251]
As said in Sun-Moon Union: "Yogins should examine thus: those with least faculties at the end continue to flow into existence and bardo, like a broken-neck fox!" The death-manner like a deer is the yogin's death-manner! Likewise like a lion, whoever like a dog, likewise dying like a child—these are the middle yogin's death-places!

[13252-13269]
Whoever has the dakini death-manner, likewise the vidyadhara death-manner, self-exhausting like a fire-mass, invisible like garuda sky—all these elements self-exhausting, invisible and ungraspable like this—these are the yogin's own activity! Through habituation to this, self-habit is obtained! Knowing these at death-time, you know the characteristics of body and mind's transference! Thus abiding, the yogin has no permanent or impermanent death-circumstances, free from all fear, free from the extreme of body attachment!

Emaho! To die without fear—what freedom!

[13261-13280]
: life short, knowables many; life span unknown—like swan taking milk from water, accept one's desires. From today, strive at profound Dharma!

Also

[13270-13271]
"The great effortless spontaneous perfection!" Thus it is said.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[13272-13280]
The second: specific explanation of how elements dissolve has two parts: sudden death by temporary conditions—the bodhisattva's breath-transference manner; and non-temporary conditioned gradual transference. The first: for those who suddenly die by collapse, fire, water, falling, or weapons without gradual element dissolution, rigpa transference—evil ones enter bad rebirths, good ones are born in good destinies. Those with little training from this view-meditation are born with happiness in high pure lands or as natural emanations.

[13281-13300]
: outer appearances looking, year's seasons four changes, impermanent continuous; day-night instant changes, moment impermanent; birth-death sequence thinking, nature impermanent. Recognition is immediate.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Emaho!

[13281-13299]
The second: the outer five elements dissolve into the inner five elements. The inner five dissolve into the secret five. The secret five dissolve into the perfect five elements, then enter the great path of clear light dharmata! The first outer elements: the body's parts earth, water, fire, wind, and space five—these are called outer because they appear and produce.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. We don't mean external visible object elements! How the body's coarse five elements each dissolve has two: outer five dissolving into inner five, and inner five dissolving into outer five.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was. The first: at death-time's beginning, each element's power as before disappears—earth dissolves into earth, power lost; water into water, gathering moist; fire into fire, heat lessens; wind into wind, breathing becomes difficult; space into space, clarity of consciousness fades, memory unclear!

Emaho! The elements return to themselves—like rivers to the ocean!

[13301-13303]
: mind's dawning door, happiness-suffering sequence—previous-later changing, impermanent, unstable, changing, moving. This is the treasury's heart.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.
