[3994-4006]
Three times of purity—not that error is destroyed, but that it was never there.
Previously, not experienced. Now, not dwelling. Finally, impossible. This is not
progressive purification but progressive recognition of what was always pure.

The basis of samsara and nirvana is one. Error is completely pure. This is not
optimism or positive thinking. It is the nature of mind—confusion has no basis,
delusion has no ground. Like a snake seen in a rope: never was a snake. When
seen as rope, not that the snake was destroyed. It never existed.

[4007-4027]
Sever! The cord of action's virtue and sin is cut. Not by effort, not by
accumulation, not by purification. Cut by recognition. When you see the rope
was never a snake, the fear of snakes dissolves. When you see mind was never
deluded, the karma of delusion is exhausted.

The bindu brought to self-abiding—alone, free from elaboration. Not many
parts, not composite. This is the thigle, the concentrated essence. Dharmata
beyond words of conceptual elaboration, all-pervading like space.

[4028-4046]
Two lineages: ear lineage and explanation lineage. The ear lineage—connected
one-to-one, especially near. From ear to ear, heart to heart. No interruption by
others. This is how the secret instructions pass—not through books but through
recognition meeting recognition.

The explanation lineage—Dharmata without action, without cause. Words
pointing to what cannot be worded. But do not mistake the pointing for the
pointed. The lineage is alive when recognition transmits. Dead when only words
remain.

[4047-4070]
Four cycles: outer, inner, secret, unsurpassable secret. Like layers of an onion,
like depths of an ocean. The outer: five poisons dwell as path-vehicles. Not
abandoning afflictions but recognizing their nature. The inner: formless,
markless Dharmata. Always dwelling, never coming or going.

[4071-4090]
This old fool once received ear lineage transmission. His teacher spoke three
words in a dark room. Nothing special, nothing dramatic. Yet everything
changed. The words were ordinary. The transmission was extraordinary. This is
the mystery of lineage—not what is said but how it is heard.

[4091-4110]
The secret cycle: pointing out and realization simultaneous. No gap between
instruction and recognition. Like striking a bell—sound and vibration
simultaneous. Like lightning and light—no sequence, no before and after.
Breath cessation and buddhahood at the same time.

[4111-4130]
The unsurpassable secret: not depending on words, completely depending on
discerning wisdom. Direct seeing, not dwelling in intellect-grasping view. This is
the pinnacle—beyond all cycles, beyond all lineages, beyond all transmission.
Just recognition, naked and raw.

[4131-4150]
Therefore. The ear lineage requires confidence. The explanation lineage requires
understanding. The secret cycle requires ripeness. The unsurpassable secret
requires nothing—just the courage to see what is already present.

[4151-4170]
Between the structured presentation of lineages and cycles and the simple fact
of recognition, we find no contradiction. The structures serve those who need
them. The direct recognition serves those who can receive it. Both are valid. Both
are complete.

[4171-End]
Mountain hermit refused all lineages. "I have no teacher," he claimed. Yet when
a wandering master passed through, they sat in silence for three days. On the
fourth day, the master left. The hermit laughed for the first time in years.
Transmission had occurred without a word.

This old vagabond has seen lineages become chains. Students clinging to
teachers, teachers clinging to students. Lineage becoming pedigree,
transmission becoming inheritance. The true lineage is recognition passing to
recognition. Everything else is ornament.

Emaho! May all beings receive the ear lineage of direct transmission. May all
understand the explanation lineage that points to nature. May all enter the
secret cycle where pointing and realization are simultaneous. May all rest in
the unsurpassable secret beyond all words.

Final instruction: do not seek lineage outside yourself. The true lineage is your
own recognition. The true teacher is your own awareness. Everything else is
skillful means. Useful, but not ultimate. Rest in recognition, and you are the
source of all lineages.
