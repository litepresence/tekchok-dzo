First: Through error not experienced, ignorance's continuum is pure. Now, not dwelling in error, the basis of action and affliction is empty. Later, error becomes impossible, the cord of action's virtue and sin is cut.

Self-nature without difference—the basis of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is one. Error is completely pure. Characteristic: without error's cause, the three realms are tossed like a sack.

The third essence: The basis of falling-doers empty, the unobtainable basis is held. Self-nature beyond calculation—even as merely non-error, without establishment. Characteristic: duality not established, error and non-error separated.

Not that error is destroyed. It was never there. Like seeing a snake in a rope—never was a snake. When seen as rope, not that the snake was killed. It never existed.

[4007-4027]
Sever! Third: The essence of bindu brought to self-abiding—alone, free from elaboration, without many parts. Self-nature without multiplicity—dharmatā beyond the words of conceptual elaboration, all-pervading.

Characteristic: pointed out, the cord of confidence is cut.

Divided: the ear lineage and the explanation lineage.

Ear lineage: connected one-to-one, especially near itself. Self-nature connected to the ear faculty, without interruption by others. Without wavering, with confidence and the certainty of liberation.

Divided: with syllables and without syllables—the ear lineage of dharmatā's meaning and instruction.

Explanation lineage: Dharmatā without action, without cause, without basis to reverse the three realms. Self-nature: clear light without stain, knowing the characteristics of the five wisdoms. Characteristic: beyond thought and investigation, dwelling in the intention of the three bodies possessing the five wisdoms.

Divided into four: outer cycle, inner cycle, secret cycle, unsurpassable secret cycle.

Outer: without abandoning afflictions, the five poisons dwell as path-vehicles. Self-nature without effort or establishment—whatever appears arises as dharmatā.

Inner: formless, markless dharmatā. No coming or going, wisdom always dwelling.

Secret: pointing out and realization simultaneous. Breath cessation and buddhahood at the same time.

Unsurpassable secret: not depending on words, completely depending on discerning wisdom. Directly seeing, not dwelling in intellect-grasping view.

Thus shown, all cycles gathered into one sūtra, the definite sequence of division and summary.

Great Perfection: nine in the expanse, twenty-one thousand volumes, three sections, thirty-five thousand chapters, eight great sections, one hundred eighty sharp nails, fifteen hundred summaries, seven bundles of distinctions, one and a half hundred-thousand enumerations, five thousand essential points, sixty-four hundred-thousand ślokas, twenty thousand name-affixed tantras.

From the definitive conclusion: "From the nature of Great Perfection, Word-distinctions emanate. From the three sections, nine expanses become."

These gathered into three: Mind Section, Expanse Section, Instruction Section.

Mind Section: inexpressible expanse of dharmatā, expanse of view's non-negation, expanse of conduct's non-affirmation.

Expanse Section: expanse of meditation's presence, expanse of self-nature's non-finding, expanse of characteristic's non-distinction.

Instruction Section: All gathered into three expanses: play's non-cessation, mind's non-liberation, essence's non-good-non-bad.
