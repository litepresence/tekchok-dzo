[3994-4006]
First: Through error not experienced, ignorance's continuum is pure. Now, not dwelling in error, the basis of action and affliction is empty. Later, error becomes impossible, the cord of action's virtue and sin is cut.

Self-nature without difference—the basis of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is one. Error is completely pure. Characteristic: without error's cause, the three realms are tossed like a sack.

The third essence: The basis of falling-doers empty, the unobtainable basis is held. Self-nature beyond calculation—even as merely non-error, without establishment. Characteristic: duality not established, error and non-error separated.

[3994-4006]
Three times: past, present, future. In the past, error not experienced—ignorance pure. Now, not dwelling in error—basis empty. Future, error impossible—cord cut.

Not that error is destroyed. It was never there. Like seeing a snake in a rope—never was a snake. When seen as rope, not that the snake was killed. It never existed.

Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa one in self-nature. Error completely pure—not purified, but pure from the beginning. Without error's cause—the three realms like a tossed sack, appearing to move, but empty.

[3994-4006]
This mountain dweller. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Not that I should experience error differently. The error itself—not experienced as error. Like a dream where you do something wrong. Upon waking, was there really wrongdoing?

The cord of virtue and sin cut. Not that I should be immoral. But the binding, the judgment, the carrying—cut.

Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa one basis. Error pure. The three realms empty—like a sack tossed in the air, appearing substantial, but just cloth and wind.

[3994-4006]
See what is. Rest in recognition. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Error not experienced. Ignorance pure. Basis empty. Cord cut.

Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa one. Error pure. Without error's cause.

[4007-4027]
Sever! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Third: The essence of bindu brought to self-abiding—alone, free from elaboration, without many parts. Self-nature without multiplicity—dharmatā beyond the words of conceptual elaboration, all-pervading.

Characteristic: pointed out, the cord of confidence is cut.

Divided: the ear lineage and the explanation lineage.

[4007-4014]
SUDDEN. The lineages! The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Ear lineage: connected one-to-one, especially near itself. Self-nature connected to the ear faculty, without interruption by others. Without wavering, with confidence and the certainty of liberation.

Divided: with syllables and without syllables—the ear lineage of dharmatā's meaning and instruction.

[4015-4046]
Explanation lineage: Dharmatā without action, without cause, without basis to reverse the three realms. The nature is complete.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Self-nature: clear light without stain, knowing the characteristics of the five wisdoms. Characteristic: beyond thought and investigation, dwelling in the intention of the three bodies possessing the five wisdoms.

Divided into four: outer cycle, inner cycle, secret cycle, unsurpassable secret cycle.

Outer: without abandoning afflictions, the five poisons dwell as path-vehicles. Self-nature without effort or establishment—whatever appears arises as dharmatā. Characteristic without parts—emptiness nowhere divided.

[4025-4046]
Four cycles, like four layers of meaning: Rest in this understanding.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Outer: work with the five poisons directly. Not abandoning anger, desire, pride. They become the path. Like a skilled rider who doesn't throw away a wild horse but trains it.

Inner: formless, markless dharmatā. No coming or going, wisdom always dwelling. Like a tree growing—roots deep, unseen; branches reaching, visible.

Secret: pointing out and realization simultaneous. Breath cessation and buddhahood at the same time. No gradual accumulation needed.

Unsurpassable secret: not depending on words, completely depending on discerning wisdom. Directly seeing, not dwelling in intellect-grasping view.

[4047-4171]
Thus shown, all cycles gathered into one sūtra, the definite sequence of division and summary. Rest in this understanding.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Great Perfection: nine in the expanse, twenty-one thousand volumes, three sections, thirty-five thousand chapters, eight great sections, one hundred eighty sharp nails, fifteen hundred summaries, seven bundles of distinctions, one and a half hundred-thousand enumerations, five thousand essential points, sixty-four hundred-thousand ślokas, twenty thousand name-affixed tantras.

From the definitive conclusion:
"From the nature (rang bzhin) of Great Perfection,
Word-distinctions emanate.
From the three sections, nine expanses become."

[4078-4117]
These gathered into three: Mind Section, Expanse Section, Instruction Section. Rest in this understanding.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Mind Section: inexpressible expanse of dharmatā, expanse of view's non-negation, expanse of conduct's non-affirmation. Gathered in five thousand name-affixed tantras, eleven thousand chapters, twenty-two hundred ślokas, eleven thousand enumerations, two bundles of distinctions, five hundred summaries, one thousand essential points, fifty-one sharp nails, two emanations of meditation's presence and absence.

Expanse Section: expanse of meditation's presence, expanse of self-nature's non-finding, expanse of characteristic's non-distinction. Gathered in three thousand name-affixed tantras, eleven thousand chapters, twenty-two hundred ślokas, eight thousand enumerations, two thousand bundles of distinctions, nine hundred summaries, two thousand essential points, fifty sharp nails, three emanations of liberation through action, placement, and exactness.

[4114-4147]
SUDDEN. Instruction Section! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

All gathered into three expanses: play's non-cessation, mind's non-liberation, essence's non-good-non-bad.

Twelve thousand name-affixed tantras. Fourteen thousand chapters. Twenty-one ślokas. Eleven thousand enumerations. Four thousand distinctions. Two thousand five hundred summaries. Eighty-seven sharp nails.

Essential points: of seeing, of knowing, gathered as three emanations.

Command and treatise. Tantra, scripture, instruction treatise. Debate, establishment, intention, enumeration.

[4143-4171]
All these words, all these numbers—don't be overwhelmed. The Great Perfection can be vast or simple. The Treasury of Philosophical Systems goes into great detail, showing the full scope.

But ultimately: ear lineage or explanation lineage—they lead to the same. Outer, inner, secret, unsurpassable secret—all point to your own nature.

The great general summary of dharma, well explained.

From the Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury,
The thorough division of established views, the fourth chapter.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Thus establishing the general manner of dharma's enumeration,
Now explaining the unsurpassable vehicle in particular.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[4150-4171]
Through knowing the nature (rang bzhin) of the tantra section, and the definite basis arising from that—these two must be realized. Rest in this understanding.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The nature of the tantra section: three.
Briefly showing the summary of tantra.
Extensively explaining that nature.
The definite branches of explanation.

First: six—the essence of tantra, definite terms, divisions, rising measures, examples, validities.

The essence of tantra: awareness and that certainty brought to certainty—the great secret, cannot add or remove, definite.

Definite terms: for the purpose of indicating lineage, tantra. Making whatever lineages arise—thus tantra. Definite and unbroken middle, continuous—thus tantra.

Divided: the tantra of meaning and nature.

[4171]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what binds What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. Recognition is immediate.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

All these words. All these systems. All these distinctions.

Recognition is immediate.

Your own nature, recognizing itself.

LIBERATED!

COMPLETE!
 What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[3994-4171] The Treasury's presentation of lineages, cycles, and tantra sections is complete. Ear lineage and explanation lineage—both lead to recognition. Outer, inner, secret, unsurpassable secret cycles—all point to your nature. Mind, Expanse, Instruction sections—three doors to one room. May all who encounter these teachings recognize their own nature.

[3994-4171] This old vagabond once chased lineages! Wanted the ear lineage, the secret transmission. Then realized—the explanation lineage is just as direct. The words point, the recognition follows. Don't be attached to special methods. Recognition is special enough.

[3994-4171] The four cycles are the four consorts' embrace. Outer—embracing afflictions as path. Inner—embracing formlessness. Secret—embracing simultaneous recognition. Unsurpassable secret—embracing what cannot be embraced. All are complete.

[3994-4171] Lineages! Cycles! Tantras! All elaborations! Cut through them! Can you find the ear lineage? Can you grasp the explanation? They are awareness teaching itself! AH!

[3994-4171] Three words. Lineage. Recognition. Same. Stop. The ear lineage is recognition. The explanation lineage is recognition. Stop preferring one. Rest in recognition.

[3994-4171] Therefore. Thus. Classification system: two lineages (ear, explanation), four cycles (outer, inner, secret, unsurpassable), three sections (Mind, Expanse, Instruction). Precise pedagogical structure for complete transmission.

[3994-4171] The integration of all systems: lineage connects teacher and student, cycle provides method, section organizes content. Integration means all function together as one path to recognition.

[3994-4171] The essence beyond all classifications: awareness recognizing itself. Lineages are its whisper. Cycles are its dance. Tantras are its song. Recognition is the silence that contains all three.

[3994-4171] Emaho! The lineages! The cycles! The tantras! What vastness! What profundity! This yogi dances through all systems—not attached to any, mastering all!

[3994-4171] Thus concludes the presentation of lineages and cycles. May all who read these words find the lineage that opens their heart, the cycle that fits their capacity, the recognition that liberates. Complete.

[3994-4171] This old vagabond's final word: Don't collect lineages like stamps. Don't cycle through cycles like tourist. Find one. Practice deeply. Recognize. Complete.

[3994-4171] Final words. Lineage. Cycle. Recognize. Stop. The teaching on classifications is complete. The recognition is lineage. You are complete. Rest. The absolute end.

[3994-4171] The lineages thunder! What ear? What explanation? Cut through both! The lineage is your own heart! The cycle is your own breath! Recognition is the thunder! ROAR!

[3994-4171] The final essence of all teachings: nothing to hold, nothing to release, nothing to recognize. Just this. Complete. Perfect. Liberated. Free. Beyond words.
Recognition is the only lineage.

[3994-4171] ROAR! Lineages complete! AH!

[3994-4171] Complete. Perfect. The absolute end of all cycles.
