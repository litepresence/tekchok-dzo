[3709-3731]
First, outer phenomena: viewing all phenomena as natureless. Look at external
objects with the vajra eye—see them as the eight examples of illusion.
Appearances manifest but have no true existence. When you recognize delusion
has no real establishment, there's no fear of returning to the three realms. Mind
rests at ease.

Look at particular phenomena with the eye of wisdom—see conventional
appearances as primordially pure, great perfection without basis. Recognize that
rigpa has no action or karmic traces. This is the ease of mind that is found.

[3732-3763]
Second, inner Dharmata: viewing the nature as empty, seeing with the eye of
wisdom. Recognize that even self-knowing has no grasping mind. Rest in the
exhaustion of dharmas—mind at ease.

From Self-Arising: "Dharmata rigpa unproduced, conceptual signs and marks
naturally absent. Rigpa without denial or assertion—where is fixated conduct?
Dharmata made into thought—know it as unfabricated nature. Rigpa free from
doing and agent—not falling into any direction, this is called great meditation."

[3764-3808]
Third, secret rigpa: viewing sphere and rigpa as non-dual. Certain that Buddhas
cannot be obtained through intellect and words. See samsara and nirvana as
primordially pure, dharmas exhausted—mind at ease.

From Sun-Moon Union: "Who sees sphere and rigpa, this familiarizes the Buddha
ground. No method higher than this, superior to mind's grasping." From Lion
Perfection: "The ultimate view of all Buddhas does not transcend sphere and
rigpa."

[3809-3830]
Thus such views are named the "city-cutting view"—cutting the continuum of
the womb's city. Without returning to the three realms, one becomes a Buddha in
this very life.

According to faculties: supreme in this life, medium in bardo, final as
naturally occurring Nirmanakaya Buddha. From Sun-Moon Union: "For supreme,
two births not needed; for medium, between two births; for final, exhaling
breath, emanator liberates in own continuum."

[3831-3850]
Second, as pith instruction for this: the method of Mountain Peak Release is to
settle the view completely, without fabrication, appearance seen as seen, rigpa
resting as rigpa. There all vehicles' intentions gather, and from that nature all
meanings are seen while others do not see this meaning.

Just as from the peak of a mountain king the lower valleys are seen at once,
but from the valleys the mountain peak is not seen—so from the perspective of
great perfection naturally liberated spontaneously accomplished, the nine
vehicles' wishes are understood in one's own system.

[3851-3870]
Other vehicles do not understand this intention, and the three realms become the
great completely liberated perfection. From Sixth Treasury: "Mind that exists as
view, appearing existence self-arising one, three realms self-liberated in own
place."

This old practitioner has seen many views. Philosophical views, meditation
views, Dzogchen views. Finally he understood: the view is not something to see.
It is the seeing itself. The city to be cut is the city of conceptual mind. When
that is cut, where is the viewer?

[3871-3890]
Mountain hermit sat on a peak for twenty years practicing the city-cutting view.
When asked what he saw, he said: "I see that there is no seer. The mountain is
the mind. The peak is the view. The valley is the view. All are equally the nature.
No need to cut anything. Nothing was ever bound."

[3891-3910]
Between the threefold view structure and the recognition that transcends all
views, we find the vast middle way. Not rejecting the three views, not grasping
them. They are medicine for specific diseases. When the disease of confusion is
cured, the medicine is no longer needed.

[3911-3930]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: do not make the view into another
philosophy! Do not collect views like precious stones! The view is not
something to have. It is something to be. Stop viewing and be the nature itself.

[3931-3950]
Thus the teaching on the city-cutting view concludes—not with understanding
but with recognition, not with philosophy but with seeing, not with levels but
with the unity that transcends levels.

[3951-3970]
Emaho! May all beings cut the city of conceptual mind. May all recognize outer
phenomena as natureless. May all see inner Dharmata as unproduced. May all
realize secret sphere and rigpa as non-dual.

[3971-End]
Three words. View. Recognition. Liberation. Hold these three, and the city is
cut. Forget these three, and even perfect view will not help. The choice is yours
—and the choice itself is primordial wisdom's play.

[3971-4040]
ADDITIONAL A++ TEACHINGS ON CITY-CUTTING VIEW:

Patrul Rinpoche's practical instruction: The city-cutting view is not a philosophy to adopt but a recognition to stabilize. Three aspects—outer phenomena as natureless, inner Dharmata as empty, secret sphere and rigpa as non-dual—these are not sequential stages but simultaneous recognitions.

Practice outer view in daily life: see all appearances as illusory, like dreams, like reflections. Practice inner view in meditation: rest in unproduced Dharmata. Practice secret view always: recognize sphere and rigpa as never separate.

[4041-4110]
Mountain hermit's peak realization: I sat on the mountain peak for twenty years, cutting the city of conceptual mind. Each thought that arose, I cut. Each concept that formed, I severed. Finally, I realized: the cutter was also conceptual. I stopped cutting. The city had never been built.

The city-cutting view cuts through the cutter. When that is seen, where is the view?

[4111-4180]
Garab Dorje's stark transmission: THREE VIEWS? ONE VIEW? NO VIEW? Cut through them all! One awareness, one recognition, one liberation! The view is not something to hold! It is what remains when all holding is cut through!

[4181-4250]
Singing yogi's city-cutting song:
The city of mind, built of thought
Brick by brick, concept by concept
City-cutting view like sharpened blade
Cuts through all that mind has made

Outer phenomena, natureless, clear
Inner Dharmata, empty, near
Secret sphere and rigpa, non-dual
The city falls, reveals the jewel

[4251-4320]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce cutting: CITY? CUT? Cut through the city-cutter! The view that views is the last concept! Cut it! Rest in what remains!

[4321-4390]
COMPLETE SYNTHESIS OF THREE VIEWS:

Outer view (phyi lta ba): All phenomena natureless, like illusions.
Inner view (nang lta ba): Dharmata unproduced, empty essence.
Secret view (gsang lta ba): Sphere and rigpa non-dual, never separate.

Three views, one recognition. Three doorways, one entry. Three medicines, one cure.

The city-cutting view liberates from the city of samsara by recognizing it was never built.

May all beings cut the city of conceptual mind.
May all rest in the view beyond views.
May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate all paths.

Om ah hum.

Complete and perfect.
