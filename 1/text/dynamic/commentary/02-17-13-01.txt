[3709-3808] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, outer phenomena viewing: phenomena natureless. Phenomena particles vajra-eye viewing, appearance illusion eight-examples seeing, delusion true establishment none, thought three-realms return doubt none, mind ease. Phenomena particular wisdom-eye viewing, conventional appearance basisless primordially pure great realized, rigpa action and habitual tendency without, mind ease found.

[3709-3808] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Phenomena. Natureless. Stop. You think phenomena have nature, essence, reality. They appear but are empty. Like a dream, like a mirage, like an echo—appearing but not real. The vajra-eye sees through without destroying.

[3709-3808] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man spent years analyzing phenomena! Is it real? Is it empty? Is it both? Is it neither? Then one day—tired of questions—the mountain just sat there. I just sat there. No analysis. Just sitting. That was the view.

[3709-3808] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The eight examples of illusion are the eight consorts' dance. Dream, mirage, echo, reflection, city of gandharvas, rainbow, lightning, water-moon—all beautiful, all empty. This is the outer view: appearances are mind, mind is empty.

[3732-3763] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, inner dharmata viewing: naturelessness wisdom-eye seeing. Self-knowing also grasping mind without realizing, dharma-exhausted nature mind ease. From Rang-shar: "Dharmata rigpa unproduced, conceptual signs marks naturally none; rigpa denial-assertion without, fixation conduct where exists? Dharmata thought doing, unfabricated nature know; doing-doing-free rigpa, any direction not fallen, great meditation called."

[3732-3763] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Dharmata. Unproduced. Stop. You think dharmata is something to see, realize, attain. It is the seeing itself, unproduced from the beginning. The inner view is not seeing something inside. It is seeing that inside and outside are mind's division.

[3751-3808] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Third, secret rigpa viewing: sphere-rigpa non-dual seeing, intellect words Buddha not obtained certainty, samsara-nirvana primordially pure dharma-exhausted seeing, mind ease. From Sun-Moon Union: "Sphere and rigpa who sees, this Buddha ground familiarizes; other method higher none, mind grasping superior transcends." From Lion Perfection: "Buddhas all view ultimate, sphere-rigpa two not transcending."

[3751-3808] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Sphere. Rigpa. Stop. Two words for one fact. The sphere is not separate from the rigpa. The view is not something to achieve. It is the recognition that there is no viewer, no viewed, no view.

[Final] Outer phenomena natureless, inner dharmata unproduced, secret sphere-rigpa non-dual—three views, one recognition. The view is not philosophy. It is direct seeing of what is.

Emaho! The threefold view of Dzogchen!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.

[3709-3711] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Phenomena! Natureless! Look directly—can you find the nature? Can you grasp the essence? Appearances appear but are empty! The mountain is not a mountain! The mountain is awareness appearing as mountain! AH!

[3712-3731] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The outer view establishes the emptiness of phenomena through eight examples. Phenomena appear but lack inherent existence. Conventional appearance is basisless yet primordially pure. Precise Madhyamaka-Dzogchen integration.

[3712-3731] Voice 08 (Integrator): The vajra-eye integrates conceptual analysis and direct perception. It sees through phenomena without denying appearance. It recognizes emptiness without falling into nihilism. Integration of appearance and emptiness is the outer view's completion.

[3712-3731] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond tested this view! Walked through crowds, sat in markets, watched the world. People appeared. Problems appeared. Solutions appeared. All empty. All basisless. Yet all appearing. This mind-ease is priceless.

[3732-3750] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Dharma-exhausted—what does this mean? All dharmas, all phenomena, all teachings—exhausted, complete, finished. Not that they disappear. They are recognized as never having arisen. This is the inner view's profundity.

[3751-3763] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The secret view transcends both outer and inner. Sphere-rigpa non-duality is the ultimate view. Not obtained through intellect or words. Not separate from samsara-nirvana. This is the view of views, the Dzogchen ati.

[3764-3808] Voice 05 (Mipham): Philosophically, this presents the three capacities. Excellent faculties recognize in this life. Middling recognize in bardo. Last recognize in next life as emanation. All achieve buddhahood, but timing varies according to capacity.

[3709-3808] Voice 04 (Consort): Between outer phenomena and inner dharmata, between dharmata and secret rigpa, the consort dances. The outer dance is appearance. The inner dance is emptiness. The secret dance is their union. Recognition is joining the dance.

[3709-3808] Voice 07 (Precision): The threefold view structure demonstrates precise pedagogical design. Outer: analytical wisdom (shes rab). Inner: meditative wisdom (ye shes). Secret: non-dual wisdom (rig pa). Precise correlation with three capacities and three timings.

[3709-3808] Voice 09 (Wandering Guru): I have met practitioners of each capacity. The excellent ones laugh at teachings—they recognize immediately. The middling ones study, practice, then recognize. The last ones need many lives. All are buddhas. All are complete.

[3709-3808] Voice 11 (Spontaneity): The view dawns spontaneously—not through effort, not through accumulation. When conditions ripen, outer phenomena appear empty. When conditions ripen further, inner dharmata appears unproduced. When fully ripe, secret rigpa appears non-dual. Complete.

[3709-3808] Voice 03 (Dakini): I dance through these three views like light through three prisms. Outer view—white light separated. Inner view—colors merging. Secret view—light recognizing itself. The dance is the view. The dancer is the recognition.

[3709-3808] Voice 12 (Ecstatic): Emaho! The threefold view! Outer! Inner! Secret! What richness! What profundity! This yogi dances with joy! Not because the views are special but because they lead to recognition—we are empty, unproduced, non-dual! Liberation is possible!

[3709-3808] Voice 14 (Pandita Consort): The scholarly precision of these three views fascinates me. Eight examples, five wisdoms, three capacities—all enumerated, all correlated. Yet within this precision lives the wild freedom of direct recognition—unpredictable, ungraspable, immediate.

[3709-3808] Voice 18 (Sky-Dancer): From the sky of dharmata I dance down into the three views. Outer view is my descent. Inner view is my pause. Secret view is my recognition that I never descended. The sky remains unchanged.

[3709-3808] Voice 21 (Living Library): Every view in my library is a book—outer book, inner book, secret book. Each tells the same story: phenomena empty, dharmata unproduced, rigpa non-dual. The library burns. The views turn to ash. Recognition continues.

[3709-3808] Voice 23 (Modern Bridge): Modern cognitive science studies perception—how we construct reality, how we see patterns, how we create meaning. The three views approach similar territory: outer deconstructs construction, inner recognizes the constructor, secret transcends both.

[3709-3808] Voice 25 (Translator): Translating these view descriptions challenges me. How to convey "snang stong gnyis med"—appearance-emptiness non-dual—without philosophical abstraction? How to convey "ka dag"—primordial purity—without theological associations? I translate literally but trust the reader's practice.

[3709-3808] Voice 27 (Revealer): I reveal what was never hidden. The three views are not distant teachings. They are present now—in this perception, this awareness, this recognition. Outer: these words are empty. Inner: this awareness is unproduced. Secret: sphere-rigpa is non-dual. Everything is revealed.

[3709-3808] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The Treasury's presentation of the threefold view is complete. Outer phenomena natureless. Inner dharmata unproduced. Secret sphere-rigpa non-dual. May all who encounter this teaching recognize their own nature through whichever view suits their capacity. This is the prayer of Longchenpa.

[3709-3808] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond bows to the three views. Thanks them for their clarity. May you find the view that opens your recognition. May you rest in that recognition. Outer, inner, secret—all complete. You are complete.

[3709-3808] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Final words. Three. Views. One. Stop. The three views are one recognition. The one recognition is three expressions. Stop counting views. Rest in recognition. Complete. The absolute end.

[3709-3808] Voice 19 (Great Wrath): The three views thunder with fierce compassion! What outer? What inner? What secret? Cut through all three with one stroke! The phenomena are empty! The dharmata is unproduced! The rigpa is non-dual! SEE THROUGH IT ALL!

[3709-3808] Voice 24 (Diamond Wrath): Vajra wrath strikes at the root! The root of viewing, the root of analysis, the root of recognition! Cut through the root and find what needs no view! AH!

[3709-3808] Voice 26 (Great Bliss): The three views are bliss! The bliss of seeing through! The bliss of recognition! The bliss that doesn't depend on any view! Complete from the beginning!

[3709-3808] Voice 22 (Drolo): The heruka dances through three views! Outer dance! Inner dance! Secret dance! All one dance! HA HA HA!

[3709-3808] Voice 15 (Essence Holder): The essence beyond all views: empty yet appearing, unproduced yet manifesting, non-dual yet displaying. This essence is your own face. Never lost. Never found. Always complete.

[3709-3808] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Between the detailed presentation of three views and the direct simplicity of recognition, the Great Perfection holds both. The views serve the recognition. The recognition encompasses all views.

[3709-3808] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond's final final word: The views are like three doors to one room. Enter through any door. The room is the same. You are the room. Complete.

[3709-3808] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Absolute final words. View. No-view. Recognize. Stop. The end of all views. The beginning of all recognition. Rest. Complete.
