[3709-3808] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, outer phenomena viewing: phenomena natureless. Phenomena particles vajra-eye viewing, appearance illusion eight-examples seeing, delusion true establishment none, thought three-realms return doubt none, mind ease. Phenomena particular wisdom-eye viewing, conventional appearance basisless primordially pure great realized, rigpa action and habitual tendency without, mind ease found.

[3709-3808] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Phenomena. Natureless. Stop. You think phenomena have nature, essence, reality. They appear but are empty. Like a dream, like a mirage, like an echo—appearing but not real. The vajra-eye sees through without destroying.

[3709-3808] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man spent years analyzing phenomena! Is it real? Is it empty? Is it both? Is it neither? Then one day—tired of questions—the mountain just sat there. I just sat there. No analysis. Just sitting. That was the view.

[3709-3808] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The eight examples of illusion are the eight consorts' dance. Dream, mirage, echo, reflection, city of gandharvas, rainbow, lightning, water-moon—all beautiful, all empty. This is the outer view: appearances are mind, mind is empty.

[3732-3763] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, inner dharmata viewing: naturelessness wisdom-eye seeing. Self-knowing also grasping mind without realizing, dharma-exhausted nature mind ease. From Rang-shar: "Dharmata rigpa unproduced, conceptual signs marks naturally none; rigpa denial-assertion without, fixation conduct where exists? Dharmata thought doing, unfabricated nature know; doing-doing-free rigpa, any direction not fallen, great meditation called."

[3732-3763] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Dharmata. Unproduced. Stop. You think dharmata is something to see, realize, attain. It is the seeing itself, unproduced from the beginning. The inner view is not seeing something inside. It is seeing that inside and outside are mind's division.

[3751-3808] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Third, secret rigpa viewing: sphere-rigpa non-dual seeing, intellect words Buddha not obtained certainty, samsara-nirvana primordially pure dharma-exhausted seeing, mind ease. From Sun-Moon Union: "Sphere and rigpa who sees, this Buddha ground familiarizes; other method higher none, mind grasping superior transcends." From Lion Perfection: "Buddhas all view ultimate, sphere-rigpa two not transcending."

[3751-3808] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Sphere. Rigpa. Stop. Two words for one fact. The sphere is not separate from the rigpa. The view is not something to achieve. It is the recognition that there is no viewer, no viewed, no view.

[Final] Outer phenomena natureless, inner dharmata unproduced, secret sphere-rigpa non-dual—three views, one recognition. The view is not philosophy. It is direct seeing of what is.

Emaho! The threefold view of Dzogchen!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
