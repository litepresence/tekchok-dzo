Water fire block separate, water water saliva eye-water. Earth earth flesh, fat bone marrow bodhicitta. Earth water thig-le, mercury son, rta-rnga knot daughter, eye-corner son ripen. Earth fire heat, vessel object 'phar shib, birth aging disease death. Earth wind strength complexion. All these elements—who binds them? The unbound has no elements.

Listen here, dear practitioner! The fire channel-wind causes steaming, and from this ripening come the changes of bodhicitta—contracting, dripping, scattering, drawing. These four create impotence in men, constant numbness, untimely seed emission, and dysfunction with objects. In women, menstrual blood not descending becomes disease, untimely emission, or monthly occasional emission. When the second and third days of the waxing moon see stainless menstrual emission, this benefits male children. When it descends at the fifteenth lunar mandala and so on, this benefits females. When it constantly descends in the waning moon, both male and female children ripen as twins. If menstrual flow is heavy with much blood, or constantly flows on the twenty-second or fifth, no children will arise at all!

The earth wind generates faculties and faculty-supports, producing much karma and conception. The wind fire creates awareness-power—light, heavy, blazing, roaring, full, and empty. The wind wind moves breath outside and inside.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. In women when sons and daughters are conceived, it creates eye disease; in men, it creates alcohol disease. The water of wind stops conception and makes non-conception. The earth wind draws and gathers the limbs.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. The fire wind makes affliction-power various. When wind wind and fire mix, they create various wisdom-powers—marvelous example discrimination, skill in dharma word-meaning, skill in cooking for women, and skill in body-speech transformations. The birth order of four elements changes through the actions of summer, winter, autumn, and spring—the element ranks shift, creating disease!

Emaho! See how the elements dance in your very body!

Listen, dear practitioner! Feel the heat in your body, understand death's approach, observe the differences in the actions of body, speech, and mind. These are not random occurrences—they follow the deterioration of elements! Look: the elements deteriorate in sequence, reverse, make effort, and change. When moving, they deteriorate; when reversing, they transform; when making effort, they persist; when changing, they evolve. Past time, if long, changes and removes; future time, if long, shifts and transforms. The present, brief as it is, shows through action and counting of change. One youth moves 21,600 winds in a single day—measure this with water-clock and finger-counts! Eight watches in a day, thirty-two periods, sixty-four fingers, sixteen shifts.

Delusion is wisdom's self-display—unrecognized wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Each shift: 1,350 winds. Each finger: 338 and a half plus eight-eight movements. Each watch: 2,700 movements. Twelve element-actions create 144 permutations, showing twelve winds developing and decreasing. The sun moves south past Meru, making days long and nights short; reversed, days shorten and nights lengthen. The White Lotus commentary teaches: when going south, add and subtract. Two water-clock measures change each month. Six hundred seventy-five wind movements increase and decrease with each measure. This is the body-clock, the breath-timer, the secret of elemental balance! Understand this, and you hold the key to the body's wisdom winds. Practice with precision, and the channels open like flowers to the sun!

Look here, practitioner! The year has twelve months, and in each the elements play their game. The sun's southern journey brings longer days, the northern return brings longer nights. Six hundred seventy-five winds increase and decrease with each water-clock measure—this is the breath of the world itself! Listen to the numbers: a day has eight watches, thirty-two periods, sixty-four fingers, sixteen shifts. Each shift holds 1,350 winds, each finger 338 and one-half plus eight movements, each watch 2,700 movements. Twelve element actions multiply twelve times twelve—this shows how twelve winds develop and decrease. The White Lotus commentary reveals: when the sun travels south, add and subtract time accordingly. Two water-clock measures change each month as the sun moves.

Walking on what you seek. When going south, day lengthens and night shortens; when reversed, day shortens and night lengthens. This is not mere calculation—this is the rhythm of your own life-force! The breath moving 675 times with each water-clock measure reveals the secret of longevity and health. Understand these movements, and you understand the deterioration and renewal of the elements within. This knowledge is the physician's wisdom, the yogin's clock, the key to mastering the body's inner winds. Practice with this understanding, and the channels open, the winds flow freely, and the mind settles into natural luminosity. Do not ignore these teachings as mere technical details—they are the very structure of existence itself!

Three hundred sixty days, seven hundred twenty meals calculated! One day twelve times calculated: thousand nine hundred thirty-two and a half conception adventitious change; thousand nine hundred twenty-eight wisdom pure measure moving wind held! Thus five day, five night, two midnight—twelve parts calculated! This day-night equal time calculated! Autumn-spring two equal times certainly hold!

Moon itself increase-decrease calculation: moon female and male difference! Moon female six, twenty-nine days not more; male six, thirty complete! One year six days lacking! Thus moon controlled! Autumn-spring two middle day-night equal—remainder half and three extra fraction known! Vinaya also: sojong able-unable calculated! Thus wind calculation certainly obtained—outer year and month connected, day time divided, known! Its object summer-winter-autumn-spring four, moon twelve dawns, that confusion-wheel not reversed, all appearances certainly obtained! Also *Thal-'gyur*: "Day thirteen also, months are one! Thus twelve complete, year is one!"

Do you see? Time itself is wind-play, practitioner! Emaho!

Suit general establish, action las explain, change amount certainty. The nature lacks nothing.

Longchenpa shows what must be seen directly pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The treasury was never closed—done without doing.

Therefore. It follows that: The element calculations are not mere arithmetic. They reveal the rhythm of existence. The wind moves 21,600 times per day. The water-clock measures the impermanence of each moment. This is the body's teaching.

[15768]
A student once tried to count his breaths. He reached one thousand and lost track. Then he laughed—the counting was the breath. The breath was the counting. No separation.

[15768]
Understand this:

The gap between thoughts is where recognition dawns. The calculation points to what cannot be calculated.

The text points beyond itself pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. Rest in that.

Therefore. Hence: Precise analysis concludes: The element calculations are tools, not truths. Use them, then set them down. Like a carpenter using a measuring tape—necessary for building, then put away. The house stands without the tape.

Voice 20 proclaims: The yogi who masters wind calculation without mastering wind recognition is like a scholar who knows grammar but cannot speak. The numbers point to experience. Don't worship the pointer.

This old hermit offers final teaching: Your body is the mandala. Your winds are the prayer. Your recognition is the blessing. All else is elaboration. Rest in the natural flow of elements, and the calculation completes itself.

The Treasury's presentation of elemental calculations and body processes is complete. These are not merely physiological but the play of awareness through form. The winds, the elements, the changes—all are awareness appearing. May practitioners recognize this and rest in the natural flow.

One practitioner felt these elemental changes! The heat of fire wind, the flow of water wind, the movement of earth wind. Not medical theory but direct experience. Know your elements. Know your winds. Then know what knows them.

The four elements are the four dakinis dancing in your body. Earth is stability. Water is flow. Fire is transformation. Wind is movement. Space is awareness. They dance together. Recognition is joining the dance.

Elements! Winds! Calculations! All concepts! Cut through them! Can you find the earth that stabilizes? Can you grasp the wind that moves? They are awareness's play! AH!

Three words that liberate: Recognize primordial awareness. Rest without distraction. Return whenever lost. Stop. The elements are awareness appearing. Awareness is never separate. Stop dividing earth from air. Rest in awareness.

Therefore. In this way: Five element theory: earth, water, fire, wind, space. Each with qualities, locations, functions. Combined with wind theory: 21,600 breaths daily, 900 per hour. Precise subtle physiology for practice.

The integration of elements and winds: elements are the stage, winds are the dancers, awareness is the audience and performer both. Integration means seeing all three as one play.

The essence of elements: they are awareness's modes of appearing solid, liquid, energetic, moving, spacious. The essence is not in the element but in the awareness that appears as element.

Emaho! The elements! The winds! The calculations! What richness! This yogi dances with fire, flows with water, flies with wind! Liberation in the body!

Thus concludes the presentation of elements and body processes. May all who practice these teachings recognize their body as the mandala of elements. May they master the winds through recognition. Complete.

A friend's final teaching: Don't get lost in the calculations. The 21,600 breaths are not the point. The point is recognition in each breath. Complete.

Final words. Elements. Winds. Recognize. Stop. The teaching on elements is complete. The body is complete. You are complete. Rest. The . Complete. Perfect. Liberated. Free.

The elements speak with fierce compassion! What earth? What water? What fire? What wind? Cut through all four with one stroke of recognition! The body is empty! The winds are empty! The calculations are empty! SEE THROUGH IT ALL!

The final essence: the body is not the body. The elements are not the elements. The winds are not the winds. All are awareness playing at being these things. Recognize the player and the play dissolves into one taste.
