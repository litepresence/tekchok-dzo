First: wisdom does not dawn through ordinary ways of gazing. One must train in the three gazes of the three kayas. From the Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra: "By dharmakaya's gaze manner, press and draw out three realms of samsara; sambhogakaya does not destroy samsara's ground; nirmanakaya liberates into buddha-field."

This old hermit learned: the gaze is not merely looking—it is the training itself. Three kayas, three gazes, one wisdom unfolding.

[4705-4711]
From the Letterless Tantra: "Gaze the eye at the sky element." From the Secret Sound Tantra: "Lowering, reversing, cornering—these three; thus three types of gaze manner are renowned."

Nirmanakaya lowers the gaze toward disciples. Sambhogakaya gazes at the corner toward the field. Dharmakaya reverses upward toward the base. For those with dull eye faculties, nirmanakaya gaze prevents dimness. For those with faulty eyes, sambhogakaya gaze brings clarity. For those with good faculties, dharmakaya gaze swiftly brings vision to its measure.

[4712-4730]
Through the blessing of dharmakaya's dharmata eye in speech, wisdom is actually seen—certain in this very moment. Through sambhogakaya's wisdom eye in the body, self-clear seeing expands knowledge. Through nirmanakaya's discriminating-awareness eye in the heart, seeing free from sound and word brings forth all dharmata's meaning through hearing, contemplation, and meditation.

[4731-4740]
The three gazes: dharmata eye reversing upward, removing latencies downward—this is the essential point. Wisdom eye gazing at the corner, equalizing samsara and nirvana—this is the essential point. Discriminating-awareness eye lowering, actually bringing down wisdom's vision—this is the essential point.

Three types of practitioners determined: the lazy use sambhogakaya gaze; the diligent use nirmanakaya gaze; those dwelling in equanimity use dharmakaya gaze. Each is auspicious according to capacity.

[4741-4750]
Definitive meaning: gazing at dharmata, pure gaze, obscurations exhausted. Mode: liberating from samsara. The field's essential point: outer dhatu field is empty sky separate from clouds. Inner dhatu field is the eyebrow-center treasure-spot where blue dhatu vision and five self-resonances arise.

[4696-4750]
Thus. Three gazes. Three eyes. Three kayas. The outer field like sky, the inner field like lamp. Recognition dawns through gaze training. Wisdom is not found elsewhere—it is the natural display of trained perception.

[4696-4750]
Three words. Gaze. Train. Recognize. Stop. The teaching on gaze is complete.
