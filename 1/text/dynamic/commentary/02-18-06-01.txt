[4696-4746] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, ordinary looking way wisdom not arising, therefore three kayas' gaze manner three train. From Glorious Space-Equal Tantra: "Dharmakaya's gaze manner, three realms samsara pressed takes; sambhogakaya samsara's basis not destroy; nirmanakaya Buddha field leads." From Letterless: "Eye space sphere examine." From Secret Sound Tantra: "Down and reverse and corner, gaze manner three types famous."

[4696-4746] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Three. Gazes. Stop. You think three gazes are different practices. One recognition, three expressions. Dharmakaya gazes at the ground. Sambhogakaya gazes at the enjoyment. Nirvana gazes at the manifestation. Three gazes of one wisdom.

[4696-4746] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man once tried all three gazes! Downward gaze: saw demons. Corner gaze: saw dakinis. Reverse gaze: saw nothing. Then realized—the gaze is not the point. The looking is.

[4696-4746] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The three gazes are the three consorts' directions—downward dark one, corner red one, reverse white one. Each reveals different aspects. Combined, they reveal the three kayas in direct perception.

[4724-4746] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Also three eyes: Dharmakaya has dharmata eye, therefore speech; that blessing wisdom actually seen, this certainty. Sambhogakaya has wisdom eye, therefore body; that blessing self-clear seen, knowledge expands. Nirmanakaya has prajna eye, therefore mind; that blessing sound words without seen, hearing contemplation meditation all dharmata meaning arises.

[4724-4746] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Three. Eyes. Stop. The three eyes are not different organs. One eye, three functions. Dharmata eye sees ground. Wisdom eye sees nature. Prajna eye sees distinctions. All three see what is.

[Final] Train the three gazes. Open the three eyes. The kayas appear naturally. This is direct perception of the Great Perfection.

Emaho! The three gazes and three eyes!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
