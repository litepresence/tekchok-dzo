First: wisdom does not dawn through ordinary ways of gazing. One must train in the three gazes of the three kayas. From the Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra: "By dharmakaya's gaze manner, press and draw out three realms of samsara; sambhogakaya does not destroy samsara's ground; nirmanakaya liberates into buddha-field."

This old hermit learned: the gaze is not merely looking—it is the training itself. Three kayas, three gazes, one wisdom unfolding.

[4696-4704]
Observe. Understand. Release.
The gaze is not passive but active—not aggressive but awake. Ordinary
gazing: scattered, distracted, habitual. Extraordinary gazing: focused,
relaxed, knowing.

From the Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra: three gazes for three realms. Dharmakaya
presses and draws out—transcends completely. Sambhogakaya does not destroy
—transmutes while preserving. Nirmanakaya liberates into—transforms and
transfers. Three methods, three capacities, three results.

[4705-4711]
From the Letterless Tantra: "Gaze the eye at the sky element." From the Secret Sound Tantra: "Lowering, reversing, cornering—these three; thus three types of gaze manner are renowned."

Nirmanakaya lowers the gaze toward disciples. Sambhogakaya gazes at the corner toward the field. Dharmakaya reverses upward toward the base. For those with dull eye faculties, nirmanakaya gaze prevents dimness. For those with faulty eyes, sambhogakaya gaze brings clarity. For those with good faculties, dharmakaya gaze swiftly brings vision to its measure.

[4705-4711]
Therefore. Thus. The scriptural sources: Letterless Tantra for sky-gazing,
Secret Sound for the three gazes. Not arbitrary techniques but time-tested
methods, passed from master to disciple, refined through generations.

Three gazes for three faculties: dull, faulty, good. Not hierarchy of
value but recognition of condition. Like medicine prescribed according
to disease—the right gaze for the right condition.

[4712-4730]
Through the blessing of dharmakaya's dharmata eye in speech, wisdom is actually seen—certain in this very moment. Through sambhogakaya's wisdom eye in the body, self-clear seeing expands knowledge. Through nirmanakaya's discriminating-awareness eye in the heart, seeing free from sound and word brings forth all dharmata's meaning through hearing, contemplation, and meditation.

[4712-4730]
This mountain dweller practiced all three gazes over decades. Dharmakaya
upward gaze: at first strain, then release, then vision. Sambhogakaya
corner gaze: at first confusion, then clarity, then spaciousness. Nirmanakaya
lowered gaze: at first relaxation, then stability, then compassion.

Three eyes: dharmata eye in speech—seeing through sound, hearing as
vision. Wisdom eye in body—embodied knowing, cellular recognition.
Discriminating-awareness eye in heart—intuitive clarity, immediate understanding.

[4731-4740]
The three gazes: dharmata eye reversing upward, removing latencies downward—this is the essential point. Wisdom eye gazing at the corner, equalizing samsara and nirvana—this is the essential point. Discriminating-awareness eye lowering, actually bringing down wisdom's vision—this is the essential point.

Three types of practitioners determined: the lazy use sambhogakaya gaze; the diligent use nirmanakaya gaze; those dwelling in equanimity use dharmakaya gaze. Each is auspicious according to capacity.

[4731-4740]
Therefore. Thus. The essential points: dharmakaya removes latencies—karmic
seeds, habitual patterns, deep conditioning. Upward gaze pulls them out
like weeds from soil. Sambhogakaya equalizes—samsara and nirvana seen
as same nature, not two, not different. Corner gaze finds the middle
where extremes dissolve.

Three practitioners: lazy, diligent, equanimous. Not moral judgments but
descriptive categories. Lazy: needs ease, finds sambhogakaya suitable.
Diligent: needs effort, finds nirmanakaya appropriate. Equanimous: needs
nothing, finds dharmakaya natural.

[4741-4750]
Definitive meaning: gazing at dharmata, pure gaze, obscurations exhausted. Mode: liberating from samsara. The field's essential point: outer dhatu field is empty sky separate from clouds. Inner dhatu field is the eyebrow-center treasure-spot where blue dhatu vision and five self-resonances arise.

[4741-4750]
Definitive meaning—not provisional, not gradual, not
relative. Gazing at dharmata: the nature of phenomena itself. Pure gaze:
without agenda, without expectation, without grasping. Obscurations
exhausted: not suppressed but seen through, not covered but uncovered.

Outer field: sky, space, emptiness. Inner field: eyebrow-center, the
treasure-spot, the place where vision dawns. Blue dhatu: the element of
space, the color of clarity, the ground of appearance.

[4696-4750]
Thus. Three gazes. Three eyes. Three kayas. The outer field like sky, the inner field like lamp. Recognition dawns through gaze training. Wisdom is not found elsewhere—it is the natural display of trained perception.

[4696-4750]
A grassland wanderer... learned gaze training from a master who never spoke.
Just demonstrated: eyes up, eyes corner, eyes down. Three demonstrations,
three transmissions, three empowerments. The gaze itself was the teaching.

Outer field like sky: vast, empty, clear. Inner field like lamp: luminous,
self-illuminating, warm. Recognition dawns: not gradually but suddenly,
like sunrise, like awakening from dream.

[4696-4750]
Three words. Gaze. Train. Recognize. Stop. TheNotice. Allow. Rest.ze, train, recognize. Then stop. Stop
gazing, stop training, stop recognizing. What remains is the natural
state, the original face, the wisdom that was never separate from the
gazing itself.

One without learning... trained for years. Then one day, forgot to train. The gaze
remained, but no one gazing. Recognition remained, but no one recognized.
Complete. Perfect. Done.

The teaching on gaze: simple yet profound, easy to describe yet hard to
master. Three gazes for three kayas, three capacities, three results. Yet
all lead to the same: wisdom dawning, recognition complete, the treasury
of the supreme vehicle realized.
