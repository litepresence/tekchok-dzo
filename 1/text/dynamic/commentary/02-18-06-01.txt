[4696-4704] First: wisdom does not dawn with ordinary gaze manner. Train in three bodies' gaze manners. From the Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra: "By dharmakaya gaze manner, press and extract three-realms' samsara; sambhogakaya does not destroy samsara's ground; nirmnakaya liberates into buddha-field." Thus it was said.

[4696-4704] Wisdom doesn't dawn by ordinary looking. You must train the gaze. Three bodies, three gazes. Dharmakaya looks at the ground. Sambhogakaya looks at the field. Nirmanakaya looks at disciples. Each gaze does different work.

[4696-4704] Three words. Three. Gazes. Train. You think looking is passive. It's not. The gaze trains the mind. Three kayas, three gazes, one wisdom.

[4705-4710] From the Letterless: "Gaze eye at sky element." Thus said. From the Secret Sound Tantra: "Lower, reverse, corner—three; gaze manner types three, famous." Thus it was said.

[4705-4710] The sky element—the vast open space. Gaze at it without focusing. Let the eye rest in openness. Lower the gaze, reverse the gaze, corner the gaze—three ways to open the eye of wisdom.

[4711-4719] That also: Nirmanakaya, lower, Buddha, looking at disciples; Sambhogakaya, corner look, Buddha, looking at field-realm; Dharmakaya, reverse, Buddha, looking at base. Yogin with bad eye faculty: harmonizing with Nirmanakaya gaze manner, eye not dim purpose exists. Eye possessing fault: harmonizing with Sambhogakaya, eye clear purpose exists. Eye faculty good: harmonizing with Dharmakaya mode, swift vision arrives at measure purpose exists.

[4711-4719] Look at your eye. Is it faulty or clear? The gaze you choose determines what you see. Lower gaze for those with dull faculties. Corner gaze for those with clouded vision. Reverse gaze for those with sharp eyes. Choose your gaze according to your capacity.

[4720-4730] By that blessing, wisdom actually seeing—this same, certain. Sambhogakaya: wisdom eye existing in body; by that blessing, seeing self-clear, knowledge expands. Nirmanakaya: discriminating-awareness eye existing in heart; by that blessing, seeing separate from sound word, hearing, contemplation, meditation—all dharmata's meaning dawns within.

[4720-4730] Three eyes in three places. The eye of dharmata in speech. The eye of wisdom in body. The eye of discriminating awareness in the heart. Each eye sees a different aspect of the one reality.

[4731-4740] That also: three-eyes gaze. Dharmata eye reversing up, removing latency down—main-point. Equal gaze at wisdom's corner, equal mixing samsara-nirvana taste—main-point. Look with discriminating-awareness lowered, actually deliver wisdom vision—main-point. What is three gaze manners' determination? Lazy one: Sambhogakaya; Diligent one: Nirmanakaya; Equanimity one: Dharmakaya gaze manner—auspicious.

[4731-4740] Three types of practitioners. The lazy one uses sambhogakaya gaze—the gaze of enjoyment. The diligent one uses nirmanakaya gaze—the gaze of manifestation. The equanimous one uses dharmakaya gaze—the gaze of reality. Each finds their own gaze.

[4741-4750] Therefore three determined. Definitive meaning: gaze at dharmata, gaze pure, obscuration exhausted; mode: liberating from samsara. Second, field's main-point: outer dhatu's field—empty sky, separate from clouds. Inner dhatu's field—gaze at eyebrow-center treasure-spot, dhatu-vision blue, and from that arise five self-resonances.

[4741-4750] Three words. Field. Gaze. Liberate. The field is the dhatu—outer and inner. The gaze trains in that field. The liberation happens naturally. Three gazes, three eyes, three kayas—all one recognition.

[Final] Train the three gazes. Open the three eyes. The kayas appear naturally. The dhatu field opens. Five resonances arise. This is direct perception of the Great Perfection. Outer field—empty sky, like clouds floating in space. Inner field—treasure spot between eyebrows, the third eye. Blue dhatu vision arises, the color of the sky. From that arise five self-resonances—five wisdoms, five colors, five Buddha families. The field is the path. The gaze is the method. The result is certain. Not produced, not created—recognized. The laziness uses sambhogakaya gaze. The diligence uses nirmanakaya gaze. The equanimity uses dharmakaya gaze. All three lead to the same recognition.

Emaho! The three gazes! The three eyes! The three kayas! The field of dhatu! The five resonances!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker. What is called delusion is wisdom's play. See what is. Rest in recognition.
