First: gate of entering unsurpassed vehicle is empowerment. Definite arrangement: basis for entering, path of actual empowerment, completed result. Four: guru's characteristic who bestows-accomplishes, student's self-nature who is bestowed, Dharma to be done in common, empowerment activity how bestowed. Guru: completing all qualities suitable, free from all faults, great waves of compassion. From Rigpa Rangshar: Vajra-meaning-possessing guru, good nature, skilled in teaching, empowerment obtained, applies secret mantra meaning. Knows outer and inner actions, without gathering-separation from yi-dam, without distraction from samadhi. Possesses Dzogchen instruction meaning, skilled in secret mantra secrets tantra. Does all outer and inner accomplishments, not transgressing view's meaning. Released outer and inner secret actions. Like jewel of qualities, engaging inexhaustible treasure.

From Thalgyur: Great Vajradhara guru's sequence explained. Guru of complete characteristics: source of all qualities, holder of perfect awakening's basis. Six characteristics: discarding samsara's dharmas behind, few desires and knowing contentment, skilled in application and possessing experience, skilled in tantra's word-meaning and earnest in accomplishment, skilled in view's meaning and complete in capability, great compassion and joy in giving. Completing these: Glorious Vajradhara.

An old practitioner once searched for the perfect guru across three provinces. He found scholars in monasteries, hermits in caves, teachers in cities. Each had qualities. Each had shortcomings. Finally, exhausted, he sat by a mountain lake and saw his own reflection. The guru he sought was the awareness that sought. The six characteristics were his own nature. The Vajradhara was his own face.

See your nature. Rest. Never hidden, the treasury shows itself, only overlooked.

The maze reveals itself as path—before analysis, already complete.

Seeing simplifies the complex—before analysis, already complete.

Accordingly. The analysis. Not elsewhere: the nature is here—it is this very awareness.

Destination is departure point.

Confusion and clarity are not two—just recognition and its absence wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Slash through hesitation. The described nature is immediate—it is this very awareness.

Self-liberation: the grasping at understanding frees itself.

The way is where you stand.

A wandering fool. Obstacles are path wearing masks—recognition unmasks them.

The box contains itself—full as emptiness.

In the interval (bar snang), awareness sees itself directly.

Between the elaborate description of guru qualities and the direct recognition of your nature, Longchenpa weaves the treasury. Not rejecting the guru.

The mind that would grasp the teaching is what must be seen through. Not grasping the guru as external. The guru is the finger pointing. The moon is your own face. Rest there.

See what is. Recognition frees immediately—not in stages, never gradual.

Complexity untangles itself when seen—before analysis, already complete.

What is hard is only hard for the seeker—recognition is effortless.

In this manner. What is described is not somewhere else—it is this very awareness.

Standing still is the movement.

The treasury was never closed—whole without beginning.

An old yogi once asked his teacher: "What is the greatest empowerment?" The teacher replied: "The one you're receiving now." The yogi looked around and saw no ritual, no vase, no mantra. Then he understood: the moment itself was the empowerment. The question was the empowerment. The recognition was the empowerment.

Look. It is here. The very barrier is the gateway—gegs lam du khyer.

What seems difficult is only difficult for the one who seeks.

The analyzer is analyzed—seeing this is the teaching.

Hence. The structure. Language points past language.

Recognition, not comprehension—awareness seeing itself.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Break through.
 Each phrase indicates the beyond.

Longchenpa shows what must be seen directly pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The pattern clears when viewed—before analysis, already complete.
