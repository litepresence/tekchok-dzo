First: gate of entering unsurpassed vehicle is empowerment. Definite arrangement: basis for entering, path of actual empowerment, completed result. Four: guru's characteristic who bestows-accomplishes, student's self-nature who is bestowed, Dharma to be done in common, empowerment activity how bestowed. Guru: completing all qualities suitable, free from all faults, great waves of compassion. From Rigpa Rangshar: Vajra-meaning-possessing guru, good nature, skilled in teaching, empowerment obtained, applies secret mantra meaning. Knows outer and inner actions, without gathering-separation from yi-dam, without distraction from samadhi. Possesses Dzogchen instruction meaning, skilled in secret mantra secrets tantra. Does all outer and inner accomplishments, not transgressing view's meaning. Released outer and inner secret actions. Like jewel of qualities, engaging inexhaustible treasure.

From Thalgyur: Great Vajradhara guru's sequence explained. Guru of complete characteristics: source of all qualities, holder of perfect awakening's basis. Six characteristics: discarding samsara's dharmas behind, few desires and knowing contentment, skilled in application and possessing experience, skilled in tantra's word-meaning and earnest in accomplishment, skilled in view's meaning and complete in capability, great compassion and joy in giving. Completing these: Glorious Vajradhara.

An old practitioner once searched for the perfect guru across three provinces. He found scholars in monasteries, hermits in caves, teachers in cities. Each had qualities. Each had shortcomings. Finally, exhausted, he sat by a mountain lake and saw his own reflection. The guru he sought was the awareness that sought. The six characteristics were his own nature. The Vajradhara was his own face.

[6759-6759]
See your nature. Rest. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[6759-6759]
Accordingly. The analysis. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[6759-6759]
Slash through hesitation. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[6759-6759]
A wandering fool. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[6759-6759]
Between the elaborate description of guru qualities and the direct recognition of your nature, Longchenpa weaves the treasury. Not rejecting the guru.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. Not grasping the guru as external. The guru is the finger pointing. The moon is your own face. Rest there.

[6759-6759]
See what is. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[6759-6759]
In this manner. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[6759-6759]
An old yogi once asked his teacher: "What is the greatest empowerment?" The teacher replied: "The one you're receiving now." The yogi looked around and saw no ritual, no vase, no mantra. Then he understood: the moment itself was the empowerment. The question was the empowerment. The recognition was the empowerment.

[6759-6759]
Look. It is here. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[6759-6759]
Hence. The structure. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[6759-6759]
Break through.
 Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
