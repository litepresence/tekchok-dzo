[3307-3344] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First AH clear light, then that also not, thought other also not changing, clear clarity half appearing, that nature meditate. These experience crucial importance, so very diligent be. Fifth, transference: three aspects. Best: clear light transference. Medium: illusion-body transference. Last: body-speech transference. Also transference place three not, transference doer mind power three. Some three transference prepare, others different. Here oneself clear light mastered, death time that nature from rigpa Brahma-aperture exit, Dharma-sphere transference.

[3307-3344] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Transference. Clear-light. Stop. You think transference is moving somewhere. The clear light is not a place to go. It is what you are. The Brahma-aperture is not an exit. It is the recognition that there is nowhere to go. Stop transferring and recognize.

[3307-3344] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man has watched the dying! Some sit up straight, eyes roll, "I'm transferring!" Hah! If you haven't mastered clear light in life, death won't help. But if you have—death is just another moment of recognition. The aperture opens naturally.

[3307-3344] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The transference is the consort's farewell kiss—sweet, final, perfect. Clear light transference: dissolving into space. Illusion-body transference: dancing through the bardo. Body-speech transference: the last teaching. All three are one display of rigpa.

[3345-3353] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Sixth, union bardo instruction: two aspects. This life practiced realization union crucial point, bardo actual instruction. First: generally bardo divisions many, but here need-purpose considering, birth-death bardo, dream bardo, Dharma-nature bardo, becoming bardo—four topics. These Dzogchen view recognizing appearances all path making, here elaboration measure stopped, natural place liberated, basis actual abiding unmoving, that above abiding able, therefore.

[3345-3353] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Union. Bardo. Stop. You think bardo is a place between death and birth. It is this very moment. The union is not two things meeting. It is the recognition that there was never separation. Stop looking for the bardo. You are in it.

[Final] Transference is recognition. Bardo is recognition. Union is recognition. The three are one. The path leads nowhere because there is nowhere to go. Rest in the clear light that was never obscured.

Emaho! The transference and bardo instructions!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
