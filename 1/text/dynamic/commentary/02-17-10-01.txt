First: clear A, then that also not-existing, other thought not-changing, arise clear half-essence, meditate in that state. These very important points by experience, with very great effort do.

Fifth, transference: three aspects.
- Great: clear-light transference
- Medium: illusory-body transference  
- Finally: body-speech transference

That is not three transference places. Three capacities of the transference-doer. Some apply three transference, others do.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[3317-3326]
Here, if one masters clear-light: at death-time, from that state extract awareness to the Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmadhatu.

Furthermore, if one masters illusory-body: at death-time, from illusory-body state project awareness to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmata meaning deity-form, hold bardo illusory-body, Buddha.

If those two not mastered: depend upon body-speech-mind three points channel-wind, transference to Brahma-aperture.

Support-have channel-wind dependent-origination action depend transference. Two: support-not mind focus only transference, actual transference and actual-not transference.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[3337-3344]
Brahma-aperture is the transference path. From the Four Vajra Seats: From upper nine apertures—if immediately do mind transference, day like kill Brahmin, also do five borderless, without doubt become liberated this.

Thus it is. The transference is not moving consciousness somewhere. It is recognizing the true nature at the moment of death—when the coarse mind dissolves, the clear light is revealed.

This old wanderer watched many die. Some with great fuss—rituals, bells, calls of "transference!" But those who had familiarized with the clear light in life simply dissolved into recognition. No place to go. No consciousness to move. Just recognition recognizing itself.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Sixth, two: union bardo instruction.
- Point of union realization by practicing this life
- Actual bardo instruction

First: though generally many bardo distinctions, regarding need upon this occasion:
- Birth-death bardo
- Dream bardo
- Dharmata bardo
- Becoming bardo

These are not separate places. They are different appearances of the same awareness. The Dzogchen view recognizes all appearances as the path—here elaboration stops, natural place liberated, basis actual abiding unmoving.

The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Between the view and its object, recognition arises naturally, like sun appearing from behind clouds.
