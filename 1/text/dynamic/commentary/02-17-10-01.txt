[3307-3316]
First: clear A, then that also not-existing, other thought not-changing, arise clear half-essence, meditate in that state. These very important points by experience, with very great effort do.

Fifth, transference: three aspects.
- Great: clear-light transference
- Medium: illusory-body transference  
- Finally: body-speech transference

That is not three transference places. Three capacities of the transference-doer. Some apply three transference, others do.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[3317-3326]
Here, if one masters clear-light: at death-time, from that state extract awareness to the Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmadhatu.

Furthermore, if one masters illusory-body: at death-time, from illusory-body state project awareness to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmata meaning deity-form, hold bardo illusory-body, Buddha.

If those two not mastered: depend upon body-speech-mind three points channel-wind, transference to Brahma-aperture.

Support-have channel-wind dependent-origination action depend transference. Two: support-not mind focus only transference, actual transference and actual-not transference.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[3337-3344]
Brahma-aperture is the transference path. From the Four Vajra Seats: From upper nine apertures—if immediately do mind transference, day like kill Brahmin, also do five borderless, without doubt become liberated this.

Thus it is. The transference is not moving consciousness somewhere. It is recognizing the true nature at the moment of death—when the coarse mind dissolves, the clear light is revealed.

This old wanderer watched many die. Some with great fuss—rituals, bells, calls of "transference!" But those who had familiarized with the clear light in life simply dissolved into recognition. No place to go. No consciousness to move. Just recognition recognizing itself.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

[3345-3353]
Sixth, two: union bardo instruction.
- Point of union realization by practicing this life
- Actual bardo instruction

First: though generally many bardo distinctions, regarding need upon this occasion:
- Birth-death bardo
- Dream bardo
- Dharmata bardo
- Becoming bardo

These are not separate places. They are different appearances of the same awareness. The Dzogchen view recognizes all appearances as the path—here elaboration stops, natural place liberated, basis actual abiding unmoving.

The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Between the view and its object, recognition arises naturally, like sun appearing from behind clouds.

[3307-3353] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The six yogas—clear light, illusory body, dream, clear light, transference, union—are not separate practices but aspects of one recognition. Each addresses specific capacity. All lead to same result. The practitioner uses what suits their condition.

[3307-3353] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old fool once chased transference! Wanted to shoot consciousness out of body like arrow. Then understood: nothing moves. Recognition doesn't travel. It simply recognizes. The Brahma-aperture is not a door. It is recognition.

[3307-3353] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The three capacities for transference—great, medium, small—not judgment but diagnosis. Some recognize clear light directly. Some need illusory body support. Some need channels and winds. All are liberated. None is superior.

[3307-3353] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Transference! Movement! Look directly—can you find what transfers? Can you grasp what moves? Nothing transfers! Nothing moves! Recognition is immobile! AH!

[3307-3353] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Clear. Light. Recognize. Stop. Clear light is not something to see. It is the seeing itself. Stop seeking light. Rest in seeing. Complete.

[3307-3353] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Six yogas classification: 1) gtum mo (inner heat), 2) sgyu lus (illusory body), 3) rmi lam (dream), 4) 'od gsal (clear light), 5) 'pho ba (transference), 6) zung 'jug (union). Precise framework for completion stage practices.

[3307-3353] Voice 08 (Integrator): The six yogas integrate into complete path. Inner heat purifies channels. Illusory body purifies attachment to form. Dream purifies confusion in sleep. Clear light purifies death. Transference purifies transition. Union purifies duality.

[3307-3353] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The essence of all six: they are recognition in different contexts. Heat is recognition of bliss. Illusory body is recognition of emptiness. Dream is recognition of unreality. Clear light is recognition of luminosity. Transference is recognition at death. Union is recognition of non-duality.

[3307-3353] Voice 12 (Ecstatic): Emaho! The six yogas! The clear light! The transference! What methods! What paths! This yogi dances through all six—not clinging to any, mastering all! Liberation is certain!

[3307-3353] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thus the presentation of six yogas concludes. May all who practice these recognize their true nature in each yoga. May they rest in recognition. Complete.

[3307-3353] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond's final word: Don't collect yogas like stamps! Practice one deeply. Recognition in one is recognition in all. Rest in that. Complete.

[3307-3353] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Final words. Six. Yogas. One. Stop. The teaching on six yogas is complete. The recognition is one. You are complete. Rest. The end.
