Third, regarding liberation. The criterion for release. From the Wisdom Lamp: Momentary recognition divides in half. Meditation days comprise the abiding portion. Through distinction of endowed and non-endowed, mixed and similar yet unmixed. Thus it is shown.

The First Point speaks: Garab Dorje taught: First, recognition. Second, rest. Third, return again. The moment of recognition is the moment of liberation. Not after. Not before. In the moment. The meditation days are the abiding in that recognition. The recognition is not the meditation. The meditation serves the recognition.

The Systematizer speaks: In this way: We proceed. Our tradition classifies momentary recognition aspects. Recognition of one's own face pervades all. Yet meditation days are not pervaded by realization. One may abide in natural contemplation without realization. Like the end of spontaneous presence—present but not recognized.

The Vagabond speaks: A meditator once thought more meditation meant more realization. He sat for months, years. His meditation was stable. His recognition was absent. He was like a stable lamp with no flame. The stability is not the point. The recognition is the point.

Momentary recognition is not pervaded by meditation. In the moment of realization, one is liberated into primordial purity. Immediately. Without delay. The meditation may continue or not. The liberation has occurred. This is crucial. Do not confuse the servant for the master.

There exists a limit connected with meditation. From the peak of supreme to the final. Meditation days are not pervaded by momentary recognition. Like the final delusion of the final—stable but unrealized. There exists a limit unconnected with momentary recognition. Like the middle and middle of final. Mixed and not mixed.

The Integrator speaks: All these distinctions dissolve in recognition. Momentary and sustained are not two. Recognition and meditation are not two. But pedagogically, we distinguish. For those who think stability is enough, we say: recognition is needed. For those who seek recognition, we say: stability helps.

Some hold meditation days as present days. This is utterly unsuitable. Unworthy of refutation. Not even worth the effort. Erroneous paths are limitless. These here are not to be engaged. Erroneous conceptions may resemble wisdom. Yet they are delusion.

The Lotus-Born speaks: From Oddiyana, I see these errors as clouds. They resemble the sky. They are not the sky. Many proclaim the Victor's words. They become fools themselves. Delusion proclaiming wisdom. This should be turned back. Recognized as delusion.

Meditation days are calculated as duration of contemplative stability. In the intermediate state as well. The duration of stability is meditation days. This is technical terminology. Not ordinary days. The measure is stability, not time.

Three divisions of faculties' liberation. Superior, middling, inferior. The first has seven aspects. Perfection of supreme. Liberated without connection to meditation days in three moments. Others more or less connected with meditation days. Liberated in three moments.

Like a shooting star racing through space. Entering self-appearance as primordial purity. Through radiance of emanation's own light. Emptying samsara of sentient beings in spontaneous presence's realm. Liberated. From primordial purity's own place, emanation does not diverge. This ground transcends coarse appearance.

Emanation diverging below performs actual benefit. Arises from ground-appearance of spontaneous presence shining from primordial purity. Diverging from Path through great transference body. Traversing natural emanation. Benefiting sentient beings of other continuums.

In bardo, emanation diverges through spontaneous presence's door. From self-appearance as samsara. Know this as similar to benefiting sentient beings in dream. Without actual benefit beyond mere self-appearance. This is the unique philosophical tenet of Great Perfection. Somewhat difficult to realize.

When making three moments, the first ceases sphere-appearance with four pristine cognitions and connections. This ground is special to Dzogchen. Making it difficult. But difficulty is for the conceptual mind. Recognition is immediate.

The Omniscient speaks: Between momentary recognition and sustained meditation, between immediate liberation and gradual purification, between superior and inferior faculties, I weave this teaching. Not to confuse you with distinctions. To show you what transcends all distinction. Recognition.

The Lion-Faced speaks: This very distinction—superior, middling, inferior—is it real? Look closely. The one who recognizes immediately is not superior. The one who needs time is not inferior. Both are the play of the nature. Both recognize the same nature. The distinction is pedagogical.

The Essence Holder speaks: Rest in the nature. The three moments happen naturally. The liberation is natural. The emanation is natural. Do not try to make three moments happen. Do not try to liberate. Rest as that which is already liberated.

A student concludes. The criterion for liberation has been explained. Momentary recognition versus meditation days. The three faculties. The manner of emanation. What remains? Recognition. Only recognition. The teaching is complete.

Longchenpa presents this with precision. Not to create new concepts. To point beyond concepts. The ultimate liberation is self-recognition. The ultimate emanation is self-appearance. The ultimate benefit is recognizing there was never anyone to benefit.
