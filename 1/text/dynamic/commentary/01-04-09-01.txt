Now as various aspects appear—both meeting consciousnesses appear merely as the stain of intellect. In ultimate truth, non-dual primordial wisdom exists with its qualities. Nothing is established as consciousness.

The dharma-body of the Buddha has nothing remaining. That non-dual primordial wisdom is the stainless suchness. At the time of the remainder, when slight stain of latent tendencies appears mistaken—and it is said that taste, back sickness, and so forth exist—when now in mind, the stain of mixed affliction and wisdom is purified, removing the false part of affliction, one wishes to manifest the pure wisdom of the remainder.

[12-15]
First: Now as various aspects appear, and the meeting consciousness—both appear merely as stains of intellect. In ultimate truth, non-dual primordial wisdom exists with its qualities. Nothing whatsoever is established as consciousness.

The assertion here: apparent duality is intellectual stain. Beyond this stain, non-dual wisdom exists essentially. The Buddha's dharma-body—devoid of remainder, stainless suchness.

[10-20]
A wandering fool. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

ROAR! Ground itself! Path never walked! Cut through seeking! NOW!

THUNDER! Ground blazes! Path never walked! Sudden recognition! NOW!

But tell me—who wipes the mirror? The cloth itself is a stain! The effort to clean is more dust! 

They speak of removing the false part of affliction to manifest pure wisdom of the remainder. Like peeling layers from an onion—when you reach the center, what remains?

[14-20]
See what is. Rest in recognition. ROAR! IMMEDIATE! Cut through gradualism! NOW! Liberation! AH!

Between seeking and finding, the treasury was never hidden. Spacious completeness includes all.

The pure is not established merely as false aspects and consciousness. Beyond speech and thought. Through manifest attachment, one becomes habituated. When is thinking unnecessary? Like that likeness—appearing as non-appearing, yet clear luminosity.

Therefore, objects appear as various white and red aspects—appearing like reflections, as if both measurer and measured were non-existent. In ultimate truth, only the self-aware wisdom of one's own experience exists.

[14-20]
Slash through hesitation. The meaning arrives complete. No gradual translation. Immediate.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

While walking, cooking, singing the distinction dissolves into the song. Who was making distinctions? Just sunlight on frost.

Not established as false aspects! Not established as consciousness! Beyond speech! Beyond thought! Clear luminosity without appearance! 

Objects white and red—like reflections in water! Measurer and measured—both empty! Only self-aware wisdom exists ultimately!

Cut the rope of measurement!

[19-20]
SUDDEN. The Middle Way approaches. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Secret ground: the path is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight never leaves the moon.

Two divisions: Autonomous and Consequentialist. The Mind-Only school ends here. The Middle Way begins. Like a river flowing into the ocean—vast, open, without boundaries.

The summit awaits.
 After centuries, the rediscovery is immediate. Timeless recognition in this moment.

The Treasury weaves distinctions to reveal what transcends all weaving. Seeing this the Great Perfection.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.
