[1-371]
Listen, fortunate one! Experience increase etc. vision not arising from exhaust also exists—this mind supreme instantaneous! Before purifying action potential, respect guru—from others merely exhaust manner exists.

Second nature extensive explained: Essence, definition, nature, dharmata, boundary—five aspects. Dharmata exhaust essence: outer light five vision body together exhaust, inner dust together concept aggregate together exhaust, experience vision object exhaust, primordially-pure vision sky-like manner awareness abides—thal 'gyur! Dharmata exhaust vision, experience vision from empty, body exhaust sense object also exhaust, concept aggregate delusion-from free, express basis word and separate—thus!

Dear practitioner, all dharmas exhaust into the ground (gzhi) - this is the result! Emaho!

[1-371]
Listen here, you who think Dzogchen is complicated philosophy! Longchenpa now addresses your intellectual tendency to create contradictions where none exist. He's about to smash your conceptual thinking with simple, direct truth!

"Fruit's primordial purity without body and wisdom—heart-essence misreading arises!" Do you understand what this means? You try to separate primordial purity (*ka dag*) from its natural expressions - body and wisdom. But Longchenpa says they're inseparable! Like trying to separate fire from heat!

"Outer appearance resonance body and wisdom crystal-light inwardly returned like portion, thus said, meaning not understood merely!" Oh, how students love to analyze! You think Longchenpa is giving complex doctrinal points. But he's saying: When you over-intellectualize, you miss the direct experience!

"Actually, inner dhatu not-existing contradicts spontaneous presence; uncompounded being later not-existing certainly perished contradicts." Longchenpa is listing all the logical contradictions you create when you try to understand primordial purity through concepts!

[1-371]
Such contradictions - listen carefully! "Uncompounded being later not-existing certainly perished" - this is what happens when you think time is linear! "Inner dhatu not-existing contradicts spontaneous presence" - this happens when you separate ground from path!

But here's the key point: Longchenpa says "Such faults accepting not suitable!" Why? Because these aren't real intellectual problems to be solved - they're symptoms of conceptual mind trying to grasp what's beyond concepts!

[1-371]
Listen here, dear practitioner! This delusion-vision's vision appears like a mirror's reflection. That own body also like water-moon—wisdom illusory body, self-vision zinc-tin, free from elements' harm, vajra body obtained! For sentient beings' benefit, called arising as body of great transference!

[1-371]
Now, after destroying your intellectual errors, the master gives the actual teaching: "Fifth boundary: measure-arrived curtain from exhaustion beginning time, own four legs' fingers light five clear merely existing. This is the treasury's heart.

No process needed. No gradual opening. Immediate access to what was always present.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle."

This isn't some complex visualization technique! The "measure-arrived curtain" isn't something to practice - it's the natural display when awareness recognizes its own completeness. The "four legs' fingers light" aren't special powers - they're how your innate capacity expresses itself!

Emaho! Stop trying to understand primordial purity and just recognize it directly!

[1-371]
Others' impure eye, from merely stone-with zinc-tin not seen. Great master Vimala and Padma likewise! Then birth and entering, two powers obtained. Even instant Buddha, duration exists. Until samsara not emptied, doing sentient beings' benefit, also freedom power!

[1-371]
Birth power is: entering dharmadhatu, putting rigpa into three thousand beings, all liberated at one time—great power obtained! Insects also dive into light! Birth power obtained, whatever desired emanated, spontaneously doing sentient beings' benefit!

Do you see? Your body is the vajra body! Not seen by impure eyes, but for those with pure vision—mirror-like, water-moon-like! You have the power of birth and entering. Use it for beings!

Emaho! Vajra body of great transference!

======================================================================

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct Prayer flags carry the mantra on wind—the flag is not the prayer. your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the GreaOne without learning...lf.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words Waves rise and fall—the rising Call out, Mount Kailash returns your sound. The return is not the call. falling, both point to water. the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a Lightning illuminates the grasslands of Golok for an instant—the flash is not the storm.; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
