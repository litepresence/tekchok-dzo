. Obstacles are path wearing masks—recognition unmasks them.

Concepts fall away; what remains is mind's nature displaying itself.

The nature of mind reveals itself directly, not through understanding.

Second, measure three particular explained: outer vision, inner body measure, secret awareness measure

. First: vision control lands, light-clear complete [5283]. The Thalgyur says: "Thus from arriving complete measure, direct entity-vision cease, earth stone vision melt, self-know whatever enter"

. Transforming difficulties into practice—obstacles serve the path.

The treasury was never closed—complete from the first.

The gap between thoughts is where recognition dawns.

Dear practitioner, do you see? Your own body becomes the mandala! Emaho!

. What is revealed was never covered, only overlooked.

The text points beyond itself pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The obstacle exists only for the one who believes in obstacles.

Compassion door-from clairvoyance six sets, dharma all know wisdom dawns

. Pure wisdom door-from Buddha field pure, self-vision sambhogakaya complete, mind defilement pure, dust doubt separation itself obtains The nature is perfected from the start.

Standing still is the movement.

The mind that would understand is what must be recognized.

. Ground and ground latencies self-pure, the Thalgyur declares [5315].

The obstacle is the grasping; seeing it, it frees itself.

Separation separates itself—seeing this is the teaching.

Measure-arrive body also thus becomes [5316], individual body dust free-from, intermediate-space light star-window vision

. Then light-ray hook shape, subtle and coil-through vision hold Rest in this understanding.

Not found through analysis; awareness meets itself here.

Seeing simplifies the complex—before analysis, already complete.

. Body dust self-ceases, copper-shining stainless light body This is the treasury's heart.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The deluded mind is wisdom not recognizing itself wisdom appearing as confusion wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

This is not a concept to grasp but awareness showing its own face.

Third, secret awareness measure: subtle coarse move mind pure although, all-ground consciousness only mind exists

. Awareness quality clairvoyance and eye-attachment not-exist dawns [5337] - this itself from!

In the interval (bar snang), awareness sees itself directly.

Longchenpa indicates what words cannot reach pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Thus practitioner, your body is the mandala, your mind is the wisdom! Emaho!

. Measure-not Buddha realms and thus body also mind-to vision This is the treasury's heart.

No opening required—never incomplete.

What appears as ignorance is awareness forgetting itself wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Difficulty arises only for the one who thinks something must be achieved.

Already accessible—finished before starting.

. The liberating recognition is instant (cig car ba), never gradual.

Recognition, not comprehension—awareness seeing itself.

Understanding misses it; recognition sees what concepts cannot hold.

Star-arrow sky-to move measure-like momentary investigate agent self-dawn that self-free antidote separate-to not-look pure [5357]. Vision above two time-at wind outward throw and inward not hold-from, conceptuality moment two-in not abide ability purify cause arise

. Body copper-shining, consciousness all-ground part concept-not object awareness fire-spark emit like clear-vivid This is the treasury's heart.

. What blocks becomes the way when seen clearly.

Walking the unwalkable.

Complexity is simplicity wearing a mask—before analysis, already complete.

Outer extending vision and inner self-vision vision aspect two see-through body mind separate cut [5362]. Realms three-to outward not return ground supreme mandala great accomplish [5363]. Again Thalgyur from: "Thus vision time all-to, body mind connect cut, contaminated exhaust body-from also, outward arise characteristic clear mind, star-arrow emit manner-by also, sky realm-to clear see"

. Here is the nature—not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Immediate liberation (cig car ba)—not difficult, just unrecognized.

The way is where you stand.

That itself first time all-to, wind and separate pure-from also, effort and pure wind action, body-from outward throw cause arise

. See agent two part-from also, body light-clear pure-to, mind fire-spark emit like, one-to not abide self-clear basis Rest in this understanding.

The divider is divided—seeing this is the teaching.

The final barrier is the one building barriers—seen through, it falls.

. Vision aspect two manner-from arise, this-by body mind connect cut-from, realms three return not Recognition is immediate.

Recognition dissolves the intricate—before analysis, already complete.

What is hard is only hard for the seeker—recognition is effortless.

. The treasure was always in the open, only overlooked.

The path is the ground seen clearly.

Opening what was never shut—never partial.

This time-at see agent also all-ground consciousness part star-arrow or fire-spark emit like and, awareness compassion wisdom part two exist-from

. See object outer inner two see wisdom part-to arise. This time-at antidote intentionally gaze manner set etc. not, always dharmata wheel-from not pass-from, practice measure complete by-say

. Obstacle and path are one—recognition transforms.

The treasure was never hidden—not made, so not unmade.

Longchenpa shows what must be seen directly pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Dear one, your mind and body separate naturally - do not fear! Emaho!

. That-from moon waning like, again body that fade-from bindu-to reach etc.

The text points beyond itself pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Confusion and clarity are not two—just recognition and its absence wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. first mind-to certain vision

. The nature is not remote—it is this very awareness.

Delusion (ma rig pa) is wisdom's (ye shes) play wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Destination is departure point.

That container contents arise abide destroy empty four sequence-through vision four purify manner-to meaning sequence apply [5397]. Continuity samadhi-to abide-through dharmata wheel-from not pass [5477]. Eye and clairvoyance great control-through realms three dharma king regent-to power obtain [5478]. All-ground subtle knowable obscuration very cut white silk curtain merely-by cut except obscuration not-exist-from [5479].

Path dharma exhaust result by-say [5480]. That clear-from Buddha obscuration all separate-from inner expanse primordially-pure dharmakaya-to enter very peace [5481]. Thalgyur from: "Self-Buddha cease dharmata, element cease-from dust cease, dust and particle end cease-from, part merely also abide not, affliction cease-from delusion and, concept-free attachment not abide-from, latency and all-from arise, dust part merely also not abide, thus subtle coarse cease-from, aggregate five also end gradual subtle, element four body exhaust-from, all wisdom Sambhogakaya, concept-free samadhi self-abide, fabricate aggregate-from exceed-from, dharma by-say word-to not abide"

Listen, fortunate one! Experience increase etc. vision not arising from exhaust also exists—this mind supreme instantaneous! Before purifying action potential, respect guru—from others merely exhaust manner exists.

Second nature extensive explained: Essence, definition, nature, dharmata, boundary—five aspects. Dharmata exhaust essence: outer light five vision body together exhaust, inner dust together concept aggregate together exhaust, experience vision object exhaust, primordially-pure vision sky-like manner awareness abides—thal 'gyur! Dharmata exhaust vision, experience vision from empty, body exhaust sense object also exhaust, concept aggregate delusion-from free, express basis word and separate—thus!

Definition: Dharma by body speech mind aggregate dharma affliction together, itself purify agent path vision luminosity meditate part together. Exhaust is empty—mind meditation object vision together self-reverse-from not-exist, not observe by-say! Thus dharmata certain definition: Dharma know aggregate gather-to, action do and characteristic hold, self-vision empty do-to, individual families hold, itself fabricate not-exist-to, natural abide-through real pervade, unfabricated original continuous-to, sound word name number exhaust—thus!

Nature: outer inner vision mind exhaust sky blue-grey resonance like primordially-pure self-resonance merely-to activity—rtsal rdzogs! This time exhaust characteristic, action-free sky like thus—thus!

Dharmata two: vision dharmata—outer inner dust together exhaust-from channel wind exhaust, that exhaust-from mind-to depend latency all-from arise characteristic defilement subtle seed part those also exhaust!

Emaho! Dharmata exhaustion of all phenomena!

. The obstacle is the path in disguise—seen through, it guides.

What seems opposed to wisdom IS wisdom, unrecognized wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Delusion is wisdom's self-display—unrecognized wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Empty dharmata - channel wind coarse exhaust-from mind mental-events exhaust

. Body and wisdom vision aspect measure-arrive moon full like-also inner expanse-to set-from primordially-pure vision-to abide-from [5501]. Dharmakaya vision core result dharmata self-vision by-say express [5502].

Again before from: "Cause and result dharmata, conceptuality coarse source cease-from, memory self-pure continuum-from also, dependent-arising wind itself fully-pure, cause-from arise dharmata, primordial-from pure nature-to, one and many number exhaust, body and wisdom not-exist and, dharmas exhaust ground arrive, result dharmata is think"

. Not far: the nature is present—it is this very awareness.

The vault has no door—lacking nothing.

What seems difficult is only difficult for the one who seeks.

Dear practitioner, all dharmas exhaust into the ground (gzhi) - this is the result! Emaho!

Listen here, you who think Dzogchen is complicated philosophy! Longchenpa now addresses your intellectual tendency to create contradictions where none exist. He's about to smash your conceptual thinking with simple, direct truth!

"Fruit's primordial purity without body and wisdom—heart-essence misreading arises!" Do you understand what this means? You try to separate primordial purity (*ka dag*) from its natural expressions - body and wisdom. But Longchenpa says they're inseparable! Like trying to separate fire from heat!

"Outer appearance resonance body and wisdom crystal-light inwardly returned like portion, thus said, meaning not understood merely!" Oh, how students love to analyze! You think Longchenpa is giving complex doctrinal points. But he's saying: When you over-intellectualize, you miss the direct experience!

"Actually, inner dhatu not-existing contradicts spontaneous presence; uncompounded being later not-existing certainly perished contradicts." Longchenpa is listing all the logical contradictions you create when you try to understand primordial purity through concepts!

Such contradictions - listen carefully! "Uncompounded being later not-existing certainly perished" - this is what happens when you think time is linear! "Inner dhatu not-existing contradicts spontaneous presence" - this happens when you separate ground from path!

But here's the crucial point: Longchenpa says "Such faults accepting not suitable!" Why? Because these aren't real intellectual problems to be solved - they're symptoms of conceptual mind trying to grasp what's beyond concepts!

Listen here, dear practitioner! This delusion-vision's vision appears like a mirror's reflection. That own body also like water-moon—wisdom illusory body, self-vision zinc-tin, free from elements' harm, vajra body obtained! For sentient beings' benefit, called arising as body of great transference!

Now, after destroying your intellectual errors, the master gives the actual teaching: "Fifth boundary: measure-arrived curtain from exhaustion beginning time, own four legs' fingers light five clear merely existing. This is the treasury's heart.

The chest was always empty and full—full as emptiness.

The grasping mind liberates itself—seeing the grasper is the release."

This isn't some complex visualization technique! The "measure-arrived curtain" isn't something to practice - it's the natural display when awareness recognizes its own completeness. The "four legs' fingers light" aren't special powers - they're how your innate capacity expresses itself!

Emaho! Stop trying to understand primordial purity and just recognize it directly!

Others' impure eye, from merely stone-with zinc-tin not seen. Great master Vimala and Padma likewise! Then birth and entering, two powers obtained. Even instant Buddha, duration exists. Until samsara not emptied, doing sentient beings' benefit, also freedom power!

Birth power is: entering dharmadhatu, putting rigpa into three thousand beings, all liberated at one time—great power obtained! Insects also dive into light! Birth power obtained, whatever desired emanated, spontaneously doing sentient beings' benefit!

Do you see? Your body is the vajra body! Not seen by impure eyes, but for those with pure vision—mirror-like, water-moon-like! You have the power of birth and entering. Use it for beings!

Emaho! Vajra body of great transference!

. Freedom through recognition happens now, not later, never gradual.

The mind that would grasp the teaching is what must be seen through.

Ma rig pa ye shes su shar—delusion dawns as wisdom wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

This focus element self cease, birth and enter difference-by

. Dharma all exhaust self ground-to, what also hold not Rest in this understanding.

Concepts point but cannot capture—mind's nature shines directly.

In the pause between mind-moments, awareness recognizes itself.

. Abide is emanation body, this-by enter power control Nothing is lacking in the nature.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The one seeking liberation is already liberated—just see clearly.

. Birth self-power who obtain, that also that-to focus-from In the nature, nothing is missing.

Confusion is wisdom wearing a mask—recognition removes it wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The difficulty is thinking there's something difficult to do.

. What seems to block the way IS the way, seen differently.

Between thoughts, awareness rests in its own nature.

The box contains itself—whole without beginning.

Again time thus do time, vision self-sound rustling, manifest reverse delusion vision, this-by beings benefit all do

. Awareness equal one cause, thousand three beings, transfer great this accomplish Nothing needs to be added to the nature.

The treasury was never closed—complete from the first.

The one who divides is divided—seeing this is the teaching.

. Thus gradual and instantaneous, body this-by accomplish Recognition is immediate.

The separator melts—seeing this is the teaching.

Longchenpa indicates what words cannot reach pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

. The words gesture toward direct knowing.

Complexity untangles itself when seen—before analysis, already complete.

The pattern clears when viewed—before analysis, already complete.

That all body exhaust measure-from free, this all result certain

. Ground supreme mandala great accomplish [5588]. Thus vision four dawn that also path arise sequence by-say [5590]. Example ladder rung like, that also path abide part-from dawn agent not cease

. Never hidden, the treasury shows itself, only overlooked.

Self-liberation: the very act of grasping frees itself when recognized.

Recognition in the interval—between this thought and the next.

Path obtain part-from what also not establish not-exist [5593]. Thus vision four measure arrive-from this itself contaminated not vision Buddha-from [5594]. Vehicle common those-from especially sublime-from, dharma this meet-from diligence practice do-to effort do

. Transforming obstacles: what hinders becomes help when recognized.

Beyond concept, awareness simply is—this is the showing.

Difficulty is the mind's creation—liberation is immediate (cig car ba).

That itself-to Buddha accomplish desire person-by, this means possess thus thus

. Other conduct pride do itself is-from, entity see not This is the treasury's heart.

The knot knows how to untie—before analysis, already complete.

Not something to understand—awareness recognizing itself.

. That cause this all rare word, always jewel treasure this look Rest in this understanding.

No journey needed—already there.

The sorter gets sorted—seeing this is the teaching.

. The treasury was never concealed, only overlooked.

Grasping at meaning liberates itself when seen.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Meaning four extreme rely instruction four above those support back support or closely arise [5604].

Dear practitioner, these teachings are rare jewels - treasure them! Emaho!

Listen, dear practitioner! Three unmoving body establishes the base. Three bindings take measure. Three obtainings give pointing. Four confidences show liberation measure!

From Spontaneous Liberation: "There make extreme reliance and faith. Three unmoving base established, wind-mind arrived at key point! Three abidings measure taken, dream reverse and body, speech, mind—signs and measure certainly taken!"

From Jewel Garland: "Three unmoving confidence place, self-nature path exhausted! Confidence remaining not, doubt self-liberated. Confidence again not, hope and fear released. Confidence path not, effort spontaneously accomplished!"

Also from same: Three unmoving, three abidings, three obtainings—these are not techniques! They are recognition of what already is.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What appears difficult dissolves in recognition—immediately (cig car).

[02-18-13-01] EXTENDED COMMENTARY - Multi-Voice Presentation
============================================================

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle presents these teachings with utmost clarity. The Great Perfection transcends all philosophical extremes while embracing all phenomena as its display.

======================================================================
[02-18-13-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

A friend has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Hence: The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
