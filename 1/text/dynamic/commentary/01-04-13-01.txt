The fourth division: establishing the vehicle of mantra as action, divided into two. The presentation of the excellent mode of the causal vehicle.

See the distinction. Who makes it? Empty.

And the explanation of the excellent vehicle itself.

First: Through the vehicle of characteristics, one must strive greatly with difficulty, accomplishing through great perseverance. Through depending on causes, mantras ripen results with little effort, attaining Buddhahood, surpassing the lower vehicle.

Through causes, the path of five paths, the ten grounds with great difficulty, over countless eons, to reach the Buddha. Mantra: Excellent life alone. The intermediate bardo. Through least birth, through Buddha, quickly surpassing.

[3313-3313]
A humble practitioner. 

Diamond ground indestructible path. Never departed. Piercing clarity of unity.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

One life versus countless eons! One life, the bardo, or a few births—compared to three countless eons of the lower vehicle. Which would you choose?

But both arrive at the same peak. The difference is not the destination—it's the journey.

[3313-3313]
The Treasury here establishes the superiority of the mantra vehicle through fourfold analysis: many means, no difficulty, non-delusion, and sharp faculties accomplishing quickly. Not rejecting the causal vehicle—transcending it.

From the Lamp of the Three Modes:
"Even if one meaning, non-delusion.
Many means, no difficulty.
Through control of sharp faculties.
Surpassing the excellent mantra vehicle."

The causal vehicle prepares the ground (gzhi). The mantra vehicle harvests the fruit. Both necessary—one for the many, one for the few.

[3313-3313]
See what is. Rest in recognition. 

Essence: self-arisen wisdom, clear light expanse, truth directly realized, supreme secret means. Divisions meeting spontaneous expanse of generation and completion.

Definition: mantra, praised as supreme for quickly accomplishing enlightenment, protecting from affliction. Purpose: liberating those with sharp faculties. Result: accomplished as supreme by Vajradhara in one life, the intermediate state, or through the path.

[3313-3313]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what binds. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked. The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Divided into two: outer vehicle of Munī's tantra, inner vehicle of means tantra. Two aspects of vajra vehicle.

The guru is the Buddha. The teaching is the path. Recognition is the result.

Recognition is immediate.

[3313-3313]
SUDDEN. What is placed as tantra? The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Between the distinction and the distinguisher, vast space opens. No separation.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

When the main person's continuum meets the clear light of expanse—this is called "thus."

Three divisions:
- Kriyā—action tantra
- Upāya—both tantra 
- Yoga—yoga tantra

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Already complete. Before seeking.

From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
"The outer tantra has three aspects.
Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga."

Sudden entry through clear light!

[3313-3313]
The outer tantra begins with purification—three baths, three garments, three whites, three sweets. Like preparing for a sacred ceremony, one purifies body and speech.

The three meditations—form, sound, mind—all appearances as deity. The deity is not separate from oneself. This is the secret: appearance and emptiness united.

Kriyā view: self and deity as master and servant. Not yet the equality of higher tantras, but a beginning. Through purity, one approaches the pure.

[3313-3313]
Accomplishing through the three purifications and pure conduct as self and deity, master and servant, attaining accomplishment. The nature is complete.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself. Never departed. Piercing clarity.
