[3132-3147]
The fourth division: establishing the vehicle of mantra as action, divided into two. The presentation of the excellent mode of the causal vehicle.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching. And the explanation of the excellent vehicle itself.

First: Through the vehicle of characteristics, one must strive greatly with difficulty, accomplishing through great perseverance. Through depending on causes, mantras ripen results with little effort, attaining Buddhahood, surpassing the lower vehicle.

Through causes, the path of five paths, the ten grounds with great difficulty, over countless eons, to reach the Buddha. Mantra: Excellent life alone. The intermediate bardo. Through least birth, through Buddha, quickly surpassing.

[3135-3147]
A humble practitioner. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

One life versus countless eons! One life, the bardo, or a few births—compared to three countless eons of the lower vehicle. Which would you choose?

But both arrive at the same peak. The difference is not the destination—it's the journey.

[3132-3158]
The Treasury here establishes the superiority of the mantra vehicle through fourfold analysis: many means, no difficulty, non-delusion, and sharp faculties accomplishing quickly. Not rejecting the causal vehicle—transcending it.

From the Lamp of the Three Modes:
"Even if one meaning, non-delusion.
Many means, no difficulty.
Through control of sharp faculties.
Surpassing the excellent mantra vehicle."

The causal vehicle prepares the ground (gzhi). The mantra vehicle harvests the fruit. Both necessary—one for the many, one for the few.

[3159-3167]
See what is. Rest in recognition. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Essence: self-arisen wisdom, clear light expanse, truth directly realized, supreme secret means. Divisions meeting spontaneous expanse of generation and completion.

Definition: mantra, praised as supreme for quickly accomplishing enlightenment, protecting from affliction. Purpose: liberating those with sharp faculties. Result: accomplished as supreme by Vajradhara in one life, the intermediate state, or through the path.

[3168-3173]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what binds The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked. The nature is complete.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Divided into two: outer vehicle of Munī's tantra, inner vehicle of means tantra. Two aspects of vajra vehicle.

The guru is the Buddha. The teaching is the path. Recognition is the result.

Recognition is immediate.

[3174-3184]
SUDDEN. What is placed as tantra? The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

When the main person's continuum meets the clear light of expanse—this is called "thus."

Three divisions:
- Kriyā—action tantra
- Upāya—both tantra 
- Yoga—yoga tantra

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
"The outer tantra has three aspects.
Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga."

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Sudden entry through clear light!

[3185-3208]
The outer tantra begins with purification—three baths, three garments, three whites, three sweets. Like preparing for a sacred ceremony, one purifies body and speech.

The three meditations—form, sound, mind—all appearances as deity. The deity is not separate from oneself. This is the secret: appearance and emptiness united.

Kriyā view: self and deity as master and servant. Not yet the equality of higher tantras, but a beginning. Through purity, one approaches the pure.

[3185-3234]
Accomplishing through the three purifications and pure conduct as self and deity, master and servant, attaining accomplishment. The nature is complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. This divides into:
- The main activity of purification
- The main activity of visualization

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Entering through bath and pure sound, meditating on the body as pure deity form. Performing the three baths, changing the three garments, relying on the three whites and three sweets.

The three objects of meditation: form-statues-images, speech-syllables-letters, mind-signs-concentration. All appearances clear as deity forms. Without abandoning form, not abiding in extremes of one and many.

[3209-3234]
This binding—look closely. Is anything truly holding?.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The main activity of visualization—meditating on deity through generation and completion stages, subtle radiating and gathering. Deity's form, speech, and mind as collection of forms, sounds, and thoughts.

Common accomplishments: conventional truth not abandoned. Supreme accomplishments: ultimate truth not established. Thus surpassing!

The three samayas: body, speech, mind. Abandoning the three poisons through the three doors.

[3235-3245]
Upāya—the both tantra vehicle. Conduct as Kriyā, view as Yoga. Called the neutral vehicle—balance of outer purity and inner wisdom.

Through bathing and purity, making the three doors pure. Accomplishing the supreme maṇḍala through the five manifest enlightenments.

From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
"Upāya is thus.
View as Yoga.
Conduct as Kriyā.
Therefore it is called the both tantra."

[3246-3310]
SUDDEN. Yoga tantra vehicle. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Through the five doors of manifest enlightenment, viewing self and deity as brothers and friends. Conducting samaya and purity. Desiring to obtain through the great collection of the result wheel.

Divided: main activity of action, main activity of concentration. The supreme action king practiced through all aspects of maṇḍala accomplishment.

The five enlightenments: through seat, form, emblem, generation, syllables and letters. Thus the five enlightenments are practiced.

Deity and yogi as oneself. Desiring the manner of brother and friend. Meditating on deity and maṇḍala as non-dual with self. Deity arises from self and dissolves into self.

[3311]
The sevenfold presentation complete. From outer Kriyā to inner Yoga—the path unfolds. But all are skillful means. The destination is the same: recognition of one's own nature.
