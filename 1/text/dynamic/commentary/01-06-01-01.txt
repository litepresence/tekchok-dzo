This old practitioner once spent a season watching mountains. They did not move. Neither did I.
The vessel receives water not by effort but by being empty and open.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

Between the extremes, the vast middle way opens like a horizon that recedes as you approach.
The sun ripens all fruits without choosing. Its light asks nothing.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

Like lightning illuminating the valley for an instant—such is the nature (rang bzhin) of direct recognition.
The empowerments are rain falling on different soils. The rain is the same.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. The flowering differs.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. The knowing is not separate from what is known.
