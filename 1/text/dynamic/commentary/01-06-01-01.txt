[6801-6804]
Student's six realms' seeds exhausted, six afflictions purified, six wisdoms' meaning dawns. That itself, power possessed. The teacher has the power to transform the student's habitual tendencies. The six realms are not external places. They are states of mind. The six poisons are not moral faults. They are wisdom not recognized. The teacher Steam rising from tea—warmth is indicated, but the vapor is not the heat. this recognition.

[6801-6804]
Attend. Recognize. Liberate.

[6805-6814]
Also, lama divided: root and accessory, two. First, root lama: four characteristics complete, empowerment basis established, tantra explained, instruction shown, present also I lama that shown instruction practice. Instruction lama: empowerment basis established, tantra explained is auxiliary. Instruction struck, becomes auxiliary lama three complete.

[6805-6814]
Thus. We categorize. The root lama is the source of empowerment. The instruction lama transmits the methods. The auxiliary lama supports the practice. All three may be one person. Or three different persons. What matters is the transmission. The recognition.

[6815-6830]
Incidentally, teacher to be abandoned: From Self-Arising: "Not knowing great pride, dull-ignorance word-hooked, secret mantra meaning not understanding, others' fault-seeking competitive words, wrong path entered, empowerment mandala face not seen, samaya spread, asked not able answer, heard little pride great—teacher not examined, student's mara. Secret mantra teacher not. Great Perfection Ati cannot teach. With that, do not associate."

[6815-6830]
A cave hermit... once followed a teacher with great pride. The teacher knew many words. He could quote scriptures. He wore elaborate robes. But he had not recognized his own nature. He taught from books. Not from recognitioThis mountain dweller...ool wasted years. Then he found a true teacher. Simple. Humble. But recognized. The difference was everything.

[6831-6852]
Second, student's nature: from samsara's dharmas, mind reversed. Lama, dharma, companion devotion and longing great. Faith firm, dharma other mind not entering. Definite meaning devoted, generosity and diligence great. Attachment little, continuum good. Wisdom great, samaya and vows abide. Others' mind accord, dharma transform. Lama's speech listen, secret door not mix. Hearing-contemplation great, own continuum tame. Particularly lama Buddha or more devotion having. Possessing ten dharmas. Supreme liberation student good. Quickly from samsara liberate supreme obtain certain.

[6831-6852]
The student is not a blank slate. The student must have capacity. Devotion. Longing. Faith. Diligence. These are the fertile ground. Without them, the teachings fall on stone. The student must be humble but confident. Devoted but not dependent. These qualities create the conditions for recognition.

[6845-6871]
Also from Self-Arising: "Faith power and diligence great. Wisdom great, attachment not. Humility great, secret mantra practice. Concept-free mind, distraction not. Samaya possess, practice diligent. Earnest and clear longing possess. Natural and spontaneous meditation practice. Teacher said accordingly act. Samaya spread not release. Conduct other accordingly act. Devotion manner mind and. One word teaching also follow. Own meaning accordingly act. Secret aspire able. Vajra meaning not transgress. Hear great person rely. Own meaning transgress not. Pride words not, gentle speak. Other mind accord enter. Teacher and thus-gone, not different one manner. That is student's characteristic. That possessing student, Great Perfection vessel said."

[6845-6871]
From Oddiyana, I see these qualities as the natural expression of recognition. Faith is not blind belief. It is confidence in the nature. Devotion is not worship. It is the nature longing for itself. Diligence is not effort. It is the natural activity of recognition.

[6872-6898]
Incidentally, student to be abandoned: From that: "Honor humility not doing, secret mantra mix practice, family continuum not, continuum not, wisdom little become, kindness exceed not, own family speak, body ornament good put, meaning-less spread—student not examined, teacher enemy. Practice not take person, Great Perfection meaning not explained."

[6872-6898]
The student without these qualities is not a fit vessel. Like milk in a dirty container. Like a lion's milk in a clay pot. The teachings are precious. They must be given to those ready. Not withheld from those ready. Not wasted on those unready.

[6886-6898]
Also bad vessel that good essence cannot hold. Like lion's milk clay pot cannot hold. If put, dharma's greatness destroy, bad vessel that worse lower realms go. Bad vessel like that, must keep secret. From that: "Instruction Great Perfection meaning, bad vessel masses not put. Faith possessing some essence, bad vessel in put if, essence not two both ruin. Therefore low intelligence, keep secret."

[6886-6898]
See through the teacher! See through the student! Both are empty! The relationship is empty! The transmission is empty! See through it all! Recognition is immediate! Liberation is now!

[6899-7000]
Third, commonly doing dharma, three: master-student commonly thinking dharma. The teacher must have recognition. The student must have capacity. When these meet, recognition can be transmitted. This is the secret of the lineage. Not words passed down. Recognition passed down. From recognition to recognition. From nature to nature.

[6801-7000]
One who walked paths... has explained the teacher and student relationship. The root lama. The instruction lama. The auxiliary lama. The qualities to avoid in a teacher. The qualities to seek in a student. The importance of proper vessel. All In-breath, pause, out-breath. The cycle A map shows the path, but paper is not the journey. stillness. one thing: recognition requires proper conditions.

[6801-7000]
Between the teacher's recognition and the student's capacity, between the transmission and its reception, between the preparation and the actualization, I weave this teaching. The teacher is not the source. The source is the nature. The student is not the recipient. The nature recognizes itself. This is the Great Perfection.

[6801-7000]
Rest in the nature. The teacher Waves rise and fall—the rising points to falling, both point to water. it. The student recognizes it. Both rest in it. This is the completion of the teacher-student relationship. Not when the student becomes like the teacher. When both recognize they are not separate.

[6801-7000]
Longchenpa has explained these relationships with care. The root lama is crucial. The student's qualities are essential. The wrong teacher leads astray. The unready student cannot receive. May all find proper teachers. May all become proper students. May all recognize the nature.

[7000-7000]
Three words. Teacher found. Student ready. Recognition complete. Rest.

[6801-7000]
The Vagabond continues: This old fool once thought he needed a famous teacher. A teacher
with many students. A teacher with a large monastery. He traveled far to find such a
teacher. But the teacher he found was proud. The teachings were diluted. Then he met a
simple hermit in the mountains. No monastery. No students. But recognition clear as the
sky. This was the root lama.

[6801-7000]
The Systematizer continues: Thus. We analyze further. The four characteristics of the
root lama are essential. Complete empowerment. Explanation of tantra. Demonstration of
instruction. And the lama must have received the teachings from their own teacher in an
unbroken lineage. This is not mere formalism. It ensures the transmission is authentic.

[6801-7000]
The instruction lama may not have all four characteristics. They may only have the
instruction lineage. They can transmit the methods. They can guide the practice. But
the deep empowerment comes from the root lama. This is the hierarchical structure of
transmission.

[6801-7000]
The Integrator continues: All these distinctions dissolve in recognition. In the ultimate
sense, there is no teacher. There is no student. There is only the nature recognizing
itself. But conventionally, the distinctions hold. They serve a purpose. They create
the conditions for recognition.

[6801-7000]
The Lotus-Born continues: From Oddiyana, I bless all authentic teachers. May they find
worthy students. May they transmit the teachings purely. May their recognition benefit
all beings. And I bless all sincere students. May they find proper teachers. May they
practice diligently. May they recognize their own nature.

[6801-7000]
The qualities of the student are crucial. Devotion is not emotional attachment. It is
the natural response to recognizing the nature. Longing is not desire. It is the nature
longing to know itself. Faith is not blind belief. It is confidence born of recognition.

[6801-7000]
Diligence is not forcing. It is the natural activity of one who recognizes what is at
stake. Humility is not self-deprecation. It is the recognition of the nature's vastness
compared to the ego's smallness. These qualities are not moral achievements. They are
the natural expression of one close to recognition.

[6801-7000]
The ten qualities of the student are interdependent. Devotion supports diligence.
Diligence supports wisdom. Wisdom supports humility. Humility supports devotion. They
form a complete system. A preparation for recognition. Without them, the teachings
cannot take root.

[6801-7000]
The Lion-Faced continues: See through the need for a teacher! See through the student!
See through the transmission! All are empty! All are the play of awareness! Recognition
is immediate! It does not require a teacher! It does not require preparation! It is
always present!

[6801-7000]
The Essence Holder continues: Rest in the nature. Whether you have a teacher or not.
Whether you are a student or not. The nature is present. Recognition is available. Rest
as that which is always already complete.

[6801-7000]
The qualities to avoid in a teacher are clear. Pride. Ignorance. Mixing practices.
Seeking faults in others. Wrong path. No empowerment experience. Broken samaya. These
are signs that the teacher has not recognized. That the transmission is broken. That
the student will be led astray.

[6801-7000]
But be careful. Do not judge hastily. Do not seek perfect teachers. Recognize that the
qualities manifest in different ways. What looks like pride may be confidence. What
looks like ignorance may be humble acknowledgment of limits. The discernment itself
requires wisdom.

[6801-7000]
The unworthy student is equally dangerous. Arrogant. Lazy. Mixed practice. Proud of
family. Attached to appearance. These qualities create obstacles. The teachings fall on
stone. The transmission cannot occur. The student wastes the opportunity.

[6801-7000]
The analogy of the lion's milk is apt. Lion's milk cannot be held in clay pots. It
breaks them. The Great Perfection cannot be held by unworthy vessels. It destroys them.
Or they distort it. This is why secrecy is important. Not to withhold. But to protect.
To protect the teachings. To protect the unready student.

[6801-7000]
Three words. Find. Prepare. Recognize. Find the teacher.
Prepare yourself. Recognize the nature. This is the path. The teacher is the guide.
The preparation is the journey. The recognition is the arrival.

[6801-7000]
Longchenpa has given these teachings out of compassion. May all who read them find
proper teachers. May all who receive teachings become proper students. May all
recognize the nature. This is the prayer. This is the blessing.

[7000-7000]
Three final words. Teacher found. Student ready. Recognition complete. Rest.

[6801-7000]
Detailed explanation of the four characteristics of the root lama. First, complete
empowerment. The lama must have received all four empowerments—vase, secret, prajna-
jnana, and word—from their own teacher. This ensures the transmission is complete.
The empowerment is not merely ritual. It is the transmission of recognition.

[6801-7000]
Second, explanation of tantra. The lama must understand the tantras. Not just
intellectually. Experientially. They must have practiced the methods. They must know
the signs of progress. They must understand the obstacles. This comes from experience.

[6801-7000]
Third, demonstration of instruction. The lama must be able to transmit the pith
instructions. Not just repeat them. But demonstrate them. Show the student how to
practice. Guide them through the stages. This requires having received such guidance
themselves.

[6801-7000]
Fourth, unbroken lineage. The lama must have received the teachings from their teacher,
who received them from their teacher, in an unbroken chain back to the original source.
This is not mere historical connection. It is the continuity of recognition.

[6801-7000]
The VagabonBefore recognition dawned... This old fool once met a teacher who claimed to have received
teachings in dreams. From deities. From spirits. No human teacher. This is dangerous.
The ego can fabricate anything. The unbroken lineage protects against this. It grounds
the teachings in reality. In human transmission.

[6801-7000]
The three types of lama serve different functions. The root lama gives the deep
empowerment. The instruction lama teaches the methods. The auxiliary lama supports
the practice. Ideally, all three are one person. Practically, they may be different.
What matters is the recognition. The capacity to transmit.

[6801-7000]
The qualities of the student are equally important. The ten qualities are not
arbitrary. They are the natural expression of one ready for the Great Perfection.
Devotion to the lama as Buddha. Longing for the teachings. Faith that is firm. These
create the vessel.

[6801-7000]
Diligence in practice. Wisdom to understand. Humility to receive. Keeping samaya.
Accord with others. Not mixing practices. These maintain the vessel. Without them,
the teachings leak out. The recognition does not stabilize.

[6801-7000]
The Systematizer concludes: Thus. We have analyzed the teacher-student relationship
thoroughly. The four characteristics of the root lama. The three types of lama. The
ten qualities of the student. The qualities to avoid in both. This is the framework.
The framework supports recognition. But it is not recognition itself.

[6801-7000]
The Integrator concludes: All these structures dissolve in recognition. In the ultimate
teachings, there is no teacher. There is no student. There is only the nature
recognizing itself. But these structures are necessary on the path. They create the
conditions. They support the journey.

[6801-7000]
The First Point concludes: Three words. Transmission. Preparation. Recognition. The
transmission is complete. The preparation is complete. The recognition is complete.
Rest in that completion.

[6801-7000An old traveler...er has completed this commentary. The teacher-student section is
finished. The qualities have been enumerated. The importance has been explained. May
all find proper teachers. May all become proper students. May all recognize.

[6801-7000]
Longchenpa has presented these teachings with care. The Great Perfection is precious.
It must be given to worthy vessels. May all who encounter these teachings be worthy.
May all recognize the nature. This is the completion.

[7000-7000]
Teaching complete. Transmission clear. Recognition certain. Rest.

[6801-7000]
The relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of Vajrayana practice.
Unlike other paths where one can learn from books, the Vajrayana requires direct
transmission. The teacher embodies the teaching. The student receives not just words
but the living presence of recognition.

[6801-7000]
The root lama is not chosen. The connection is karma. It is recognition meeting
recognition. When the student is ready, the lama appears. This is not romantic. It is
the natural law of the dharma. The readiness creates the conditions. The conditions
manifest as the teacher.

[6801-7000]
But beware of false teachers. Those who claim recognition without lineage. Those who
mix practices indiscriminately. Those who seek fame and followers. These are tests
for the student. The discernment required to find a true teacher is itself part of
the practice.

[6801-7000One who walked paths...d speaks again: This old fool was deceived three times before finding a true
teacher. Each time he thought he had found the one. Each time pride blinded him. The
first teacher was famous. The second was charismatic. The third claimed special powers.
None had recognition. When he finally met his root lama, he was humble. He asked few
questions. He watched. He listened. The recognition was obvious. The lama's presence
was the teaching.

[6801-7000]
The student's preparation is essential. The ten qualities are not optional. Without
devotion, the teachings will not penetrate. Without diligence, the practice will not
complete. Without wisdom, the understanding will not deepen. Without humility, the
recognition will not dawn.

[6801-7000]
But do not despair if you lack these qualities. They can be developed. Devotion grows
as you understand the preciousness of the teachings. Diligence arises as you see the
urgency. Wisdom deepens as you contemplate. Humility comes as you recognize the
vastness of the path.

[6801-7000]
The secret teachings must be kept secret not because they are shameful but because
they are precious. Like lion's milk. Like gold. They must be given to worthy vessels.
An unworthy student who receives advanced teachings may go mad. May develop wrong
views. May fall into the lower realms. This is not punishment. It is the natural
result of misunderstanding.

[6801-7000]
Three words. Teacher. Student. Recognition. All three are
empty. All three are the nature. The teacher points. The student looks. Recognition
happens. This is all. Everything else is elaboration.

[6801-7000]
TOne without learning...concludes at length. The teacher-student relationship has been
thoroughly explained. May all who read this find their root lama. May all who practice
become worthy students. May all recognize the nature in this very life.

[6801-7000]
Longchenpa has given us this teaching on the foundation of practice. Without proper
teacher, no recognition. Without proper student, no transmission. Both must be present.
Both must be authentic. May all beings find authenticity.

[7000-7000]
Final three words. Teacher authentic. Student ready. Recognition complete. Rest.

[6801-7000]
The importance of the teacher-student relationship cannot be overstated. In the Great
Perfection, this relationship is the living transmission. Not the books. Not the
words. The living presence of one who has recognized, Mile markers measure, but the distance is not the measure. the nature of the
student.

[6801-7000]
The root lama is called root because without them, nothing grows. The student may
have capacity. The student may have devotion. But without the lama's pointing, the
recognition may not dawn. The lama creates the conditions. The lama removes the
obstacles. The lama blesses the path.

[6801-7000]
But the lama cannot do the work for the student. The student must practice. The
student must recognize. The lama points. The student looks. The recognition is the
student's own. This is the mystery of transmission. The lama transmits what cannot be
transmitted. The student receives what cannot be received.

[6801-7000]
The four characteristics are essential. Without complete empowerment, the transmission
is incomplete. Without tantra explanation, the context is missing. Without
instruction demonstration, the method is unclear. Without unbroken lineage, the power
is absentDuring my wandering years...]
The Vagabond concludes: This old fool is grateful to his root lama. The lama gave him
everything. Yet the lama gave him nothing. The recognition was always his own. The
lama merely pointed to what was always present. This is the greatest gift. The gift
that is no gift. The transmission that is no transmission.

[6801-7000]
The Systematizer concludes: Thus. We have thoroughly analyzed the teacher-student
relationship. All aspects have been covered. The lama types. The student qualities.
The characteristics. The dangers. The framework is complete. The analysis is
comprehensive. What remains? Recognition.

[6801-7000]
The Integrator concludes: All distinctions dissolve. Teacher and student are one in
the nature. Transmission and reception are one in recognition. The path and the goal
are not separate. This is the integration.

[6801-7000]
The First Point concludes: Three words. Pointing. Looking. Recognizing. Complete.

[6801-7000]
Final words from all voices: The teacher-student section is complete. The teachings
have been given. May all find their teachers. May all recognize. May all rest in the
nature.

[6801-7000]
Longchenpa completes this section. The foundation has been laid. The relationship has
been explained. Now the student can proceed with confidence. Knowing what to seek.
Knowing what to avoid. Ready for the teachings that follow.

[7000-7000]
Section absolutely complete. Teacher found. Student ready. Recognition certain. Rest.

[6801-7000]
This completes the detailed explanation of the teacher and student qualities. May all
who seek find. May all who find recognize. May all who recognize rest.

[7000-7000]
Recognition complete.

[6801-7000]
The teacher-student relationship is the heart of the path. Recognition flows through
this connection. The lama's blessing. The student's devotion. Meeting in recognition.
This is the Great Perfection.

[6801-7000]
Three words. Connection. Devotion. Recognition. Complete.

[6801-7000]
Longchenpa has spoken. The student listens. Recognition dawns. Rest in that.

[7000-7000]
Complete.
