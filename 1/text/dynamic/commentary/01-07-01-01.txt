From the Tantra of Supreme Samaya—dam tshig mchog gi rgyud. Samaya, the binding pledge, the dam that holds back the floods of delusion. But look closer—what floods? The water is calm. The vajra cross, difficult to traverse, yet certain in aim. You stumble not because the path is hard but because you look for a path where there is only ground.

The three that strike: See the nature. Remain there. Return when distracted. You think samaya is a promise to keep? It is the recognition that promises are empty. You bind yourself with vows, and I tell you—you were never loose. The vajra cross stands in the middle of the marketplace. Everyone walks around it, no one sees it.

This old man has seen them take their samaya like frightened mice! "I swear! I promise! I'll be good!" Hah! Samaya isn't a promise to a god outside. It's your own mind not breaking itself. Like a river that doesn't forget to flow—you don't keep samaya, you ARE samaya.

The binding pledge is the embrace of the consort. Vajra and bell meet, and in their meeting, the universe is sealed. Difficult to traverse? Only if you think you need to go somewhere. The aim is certain because there is nothing to aim at. Rest in the embrace, practitioner.

I made a promise to my mother before she died—to visit her grave every month. For ten years I kept it. Then one day I realized—the promise kept itself. I didn't need to remember. The visiting just happened. Samaya is like that. At first effort, then effortless.

Therefore. Given this: Samaya—dam tshig—etymology: dam meaning bound, tshig meaning word or pledge. Precise analysis reveals two aspects: the restrictive—binding negative actions—and the supportive—binding to recognition. The vajra cross—rdo rje 'da' dka'—indicates the indestructible nature that cannot be bypassed or transcended.

The pledge binds nothing. Your mind binds itself with thoughts of binding and loosening. Rest in the samaya that is never kept and never broken. Like space that is never imprisoned and never free.

BINDING? I'll show you binding! speaks with fierce compassion The lion's jaws bind the deer of delusion! But look—no deer! No jaws! The binding is empty! See the nature (rang bzhin) the samaya and find you were never bound! The vajra cross? JUST TWO STICKS! Walk through it!

Regarding the definition—rnam grangs. Generally, samaya is the mind itself, unbroken, free from deception and guile. Your mind, before you think "this is my mind," is the samaya. Unbroken because it was never whole. Free from deception because there's no one to deceive.

Consider this: You search for your mind like a man searching for his glasses while wearing them. The mind that searches and the mind that is sought—are they two? The unbroken mind is the mind that never started. No deception possible where there is no deceiver.

They want definitions! "What exactly is samaya, Rinpoche?" they ask, notebooks ready. This old man says—samaya is when you stop asking what samaya is. The mind unbroken is like a mirror that never refused to reflect. Even the dust on the mirror is reflected perfectly.

Free from deception and guile—g.yo sgyu rnam dang bral ba. The deity's mind is without strategy, without plot. It doesn't pretend to be pure. It doesn't hide its impurity. It simply is. This is your mind, practitioner. Why do you paint it with concepts?

My neighbor cheats at cards. Always has an ace up his sleeve. Me? I play with my cards showing. He wins the money, I win the peace. Samaya is playing with open hands. No deception, no guile—just the game as it is.

Therefore. Therefore: The definition emphasizes rang sems—one's own mind. Key point: unbroken—tshig pa med pa—indicates the continuous nature of awareness, not interrupted by conceptual thought. Deception—g.yo—and guile—sgyu—refer to artificiality and pretense, the opposite of naturalness.

Your mind is samaya. Not something to be achieved. Not something to be protected. Like the sun that shines without deciding to shine, your awareness is naturally free from deception.

SUDDEN WRATH! They analyze samaya like butchers cutting meat! This piece, that piece! SAMAYA IS WHOLE! One taste! One recognition! See through the analysis and SEE!

If classified—dbye na—according to the general system of Mantra, two samayas: root and branch. Root consists of three: Body, Speech, Mind. Branches are twenty-five. To accept, not to abandon, to practice, to accomplish—five each. The tree of enlightenment grows from these roots and branches.

The teaching is simple: You tend the branches and forget the root. You guard the root and ignore the branches. Fool! The root IS the branches. The branches ARE the root. Twenty-five, three, five—numbers for children. The tree stands complete without counting.

They love their categories! "Rinpoche, is this root or branch?" As if it matters! This old man has seen them debate for days whether eating after noon breaks root or branch samaya. While they debate, the meal gets cold. Eat! The samaya is in the eating, not the category.

The root samaya of Body, Speech, and Mind is the three vajras. Your body is the vajra body of all buddhas. Your speech is the vajra speech. Your mind is the vajra mind. The twenty-five branches are the play of these three, like rays from the sun.

I have a tree outside my hut. Three main branches, many small twigs. In spring, I don't count the leaves—I enjoy the shade. Root samaya, branch samaya—just words. The tree doesn't know these names. It just grows.

Therefore. It follows that: Classification system: rts ba—root—threefold (sku gsung thugs). yan lag—branch—twenty-five. Categories: shes par bya ba (to know), dang du blang ba (to accept), mi spang ba (not to abandon), spyad par bya ba (to practice), bsgrub par bya ba (to accomplish)—five by five distribution.

The root holds the tree. The branches reach the sky. Neither is more important. Rest in the body samaya, the speech samaya, the mind samaya. The twenty-five arise naturally when these three are recognized.

TWENTY-FIVE BRANCHES? I'll give you twenty-five cuts! *slash* Root samaya? CUT! Branch samaya? CUT! The tree of samsara falls! The tree of enlightenment falls! What remains? THE GROUND WHERE TREES NEVER GREW!

Specifically classified: view, conduct, practice, common, particular Body-Speech-Mind, branches, and crucial certain samaya. From the Self-Arisen—the hundred-thousand-fold spoken samayas, briefly taught. Hold these well in mind. The samaya of realizing view, tantric conduct, general practice, general commonality, Body-Speech-Mind, branch enumerations, crucial certain samaya.

Look directly: Longchenpa condenses the hundred-thousand into seven. You want to read them all? Be my guest. But in the time you read, you could recognize. The brief teaching is the only teaching. The rest is commentary.

Hundred-thousand samayas! They hear this and faint! "How can I keep them all?" You can't! That's the point! This old man keeps only one samaya—not forgetting his nature. From that, the hundred-thousand keep themselves.

The seven samayas are the seven lotus petals. View in the center, conduct surrounding, practice as fragrance, common as color, Body-Speech-Mind as form, branches as roots, crucial samaya as the jewel in the heart. The hundred-thousand are the insects that drink the nectar. Be the lotus, not the insect.

I was taught seven songs as a child. Hundred more as a youth. Now I sing one song with seven hundred variations. The brief teaching contains all. The elaborate contains nothing.

Therefore. This being so: Seven categories: lta ba (view), spyod pa (conduct), bsgrub pa (practice), thun mong ba (common), khyad par sku gsung thugs (particular), yan lag (branches), gal mdo nges pa'i dam tshig (crucial certain). Precise analysis: this taxonomy organizes the chaotic mass of tantric commitments into a coherent structure.

The seven are one. The one is seven. Rest in the crucial certain samaya—the recognition of your nature—and the other six are automatic.

SEVEN SAMAYAS? One recognition! See through the seven and find the ONE that was never divided!

The basis is teacher and student, vajra siblings. Inconceivable samayas spoken to gather in two aspects. Teacher and student—the cause of protection, universally renowned. The cause of protection is the teacher; the one who makes protection is the student.

A single point: You look for a teacher outside. You see a student in the mirror. Both are mind's display. The teacher appears because you are ready. The student appears because there is something to teach. When teaching and learning happen, both disappear.

They worship the teacher like a god! Prostrate, offer, serve—while their minds judge, compare, criticize. This old man has seen it. The true teacher is your own wisdom appearing as form. The true student is the openness that receives. When they meet, who is who?

The vajra siblings—mched lcam—are the dakas and dakinis of your own mandala. Close siblings of one Dharma-family. Mixed siblings gathered by one Guru. Extremely mixed siblings sharing one empowerment, one mandala, one lamp, one vase. In their presence, you see your own face.

I had twelve brothers and sisters. Some close, some distant. But when my mother died, we were all just children again. The Dharma family is like that—different closeness, same mother.

Therefore. Hence: Two aspects: slob dpon (teacher) and slob ma (student). The cause of protection—bsrung ba'i rgyu—indicates the condition for samaya preservation. Four types of mched lcam: spyi (general), nye (close), 'dres pa (mixed), shin tu 'dres pa (extremely mixed).

Teacher and student are mind's kindness to itself. Rest in the recognition, and both roles dissolve into the play of awareness.

TEACHER? STUDENT? speaks with fierce compassion The lion has no teacher! The lion IS the teaching! See through the hierarchy! You are the teacher! You are the student! The vajra siblings? JUST REFLECTIONS! Smash the mirror!

The four guru types: general teacher honored by all, the teacher who draws one to the Dharma, empowerment teacher bestowing samaya and vows, oral transmission teacher giving instruction. Not-knowing, training to liberate through knowing—the teacher who connects to Dzogchen meaning. The student—training through listening without distraction, becoming the vessel for instruction.

Understand this: You discriminate—this one gives empowerment, that one gives instruction. Fool! The same wisdom wears four masks. See through the masks. The face behind is your own.

They collect gurus like stamps! "I have fifteen root gurus!" they boast. This old man has one—his own rigpa. The external gurus were kindness itself, but the real guru never left home.

The four gurus are the four activities of the Buddha. Drawing, connecting, empowering, instructing—four waves from one ocean. The student who listens without distraction is the shore that receives.

My father taught me to plow. My mother taught me to cook. The old lama taught me to meditate. The mountain taught me silence. Four teachers, one lesson—be present.

Therefore. Accordingly: Four guru types: spyi (general), 'dren (drawing), dam tshig dbang (empowerment), man ngag lung (instruction). Definition: slob—not-knowing to knowing. dpon—guide to Dzogchen. Student definition: ma—vessel for teaching. Precise analysis of the pedagogical relationship.

The guru-disciple relationship rests on recognition. Both abide equally upon right ground. If possessing samaya, thus it is.

FOUR GURUS? One recognition! The guru who draws, the guru who empowers—they are ONE! See through the four and find the GURU WHO WAS NEVER APART!

Abiding in samaya and vow as taught—all intentions reach culmination. Whoever abides in supreme samaya, by the supreme, most supreme—sons and siblings are blessed in intention. This is the benefit of guarding samaya—not heaven, not superpowers, but the natural completion of all aims.

The essence: You want benefits? The benefit is the abiding itself. You want culmination? You are already there. The blessing is not something received. It is the recognition of what was never absent.

They ask "What do I get for keeping samaya?" This old man laughs! You get to keep your mind! You get to recognize your nature! Is that not enough? What more do you want—the moon on a stick?

The benefit of samaya is the samaya itself. Like a flame that gives light by being flame. It doesn't decide to benefit. It doesn't calculate its warmth. It simply is, and benefit naturally flows.

I plant seeds. I water them. The benefit? Vegetables! Simple. Keep samaya, get liberation. Even simpler. Why complicate?

Therefore. From this: Benefit—phan yon—analyzed as: external—realization of siddhis, internal—maturation of bodhicitta, secret—recognition of dharmakaya. Precise analysis: all intentions—bsam pa thams cad—reach culmination—mthar phyin—indicates the exhaustion of dualistic aims.

The benefit is peace. The peace of not needing benefits. Abide in samaya, and all aims complete themselves like dreams waking up.

BENEFIT? I'll give you benefit! speaks with fierce compassion The benefit of cutting through! The benefit of STOPPING! No sons! No siblings! No blessings to receive! JUST THIS!
Immediate (cig car ba)—not progressive, never gradual. In the nature, completion is already.

The path is the ground seen clearly.

The road is the earth.
