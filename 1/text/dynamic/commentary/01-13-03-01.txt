Listen! From the center of the eye's essence, generally the four lamps appear. Particularly, the empty bindu lamp with self-light appears. From that: "Eyes of beings unobscured by conditions, through the door called cakṣu, like the sun's mandala, self-light and rays, appear as self-possessions."

[16610-16618]
Generally, from the right eye—distance-snare and prajna two. From the left—bindu and dharmadhatu two. At the Brahma aperture, awareness body lamp blazes in manner. From Jewel Garland: "Beings' path is the seeing door. That itself, right two, left two, center—lamp blazing manner dwells."

[16619-16620]
Seventh, nature: From the nature (rang bzhin) of original kadag, clear light lhungrub bindu empty appears like a water-moon. The nature is complete.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Dear practitioner! Do you see? Your own eyes are the lamps! Right eye, left eye—distance-snare, bindu—all are wisdom's display. Do not look outside for light. The light is what sees!

Emaho! Your eyes are the four lamps blazing!

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Mix the unmixed. The unmixed is already mixed. Your own face is the mix.

[16743-16745]
You sit there, waiting for something to happen. Fool. The bindu already falls through your channels. The peacock's tail spreads in your own skull-cave. Don't look elsewhere.

[16746-16749]
Twelve similes—twelve traps for your conceptual mind. Vulture's eye, fish eye, cat eye, thief's eye. You want to understand? Look at your own eyeball. The light you see is your own rigpa shining back at you.

[16750-16755]
Peacock tail, vulture eye, fish eye, thief eye. These are not metaphors in a book. They appear in your meditation right now. You miss them because you wait for something grand.

[16756-16760]
Third sphere—completely pure lamp. Essence, definition, classification, nature, characteristic. You want to analyze? The lamp is already blazing. Your analysis is smoke obscuring the flame.

[16761-16767]
Familiarization, measure, abode, door, actual, simile. Eleven aspects. You think knowing them helps? The lamp needs no student. It shines whether you study or not. But you must look.

[16768-16768]
Five colors spread like a house under a barrel. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.
