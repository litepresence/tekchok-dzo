Listen! From the center of the eye's essence, generally the four lamps appear. Particularly, the empty bindu lamp with self-light appears. From that: "Eyes of beings unobscured by conditions, through the door called cakṣu, like the sun's mandala, self-light and rays, appear as self-possessions."

[166-174]
Generally, from the right eye—distance-snare and prajna two. From the left—bindu and dharmadhatu two. At the Brahma aperture, awareness body lamp blazes in manner. From Jewel Garland: "Beings' path is the seeing door. That itself, right two, left two, center—lamp blazing manner dwells."

[175-176]
Seventh, nature: From the nature (rang bzhin) of original kadag, clear light lhungrub bindu empty appears like a water-moon. The nature is complete.

Dear practitioner! Do you see? Your own eyes are the lamps! Right eye, left eye—distance-snare, bindu—all are wisdom's display. Do not look outside for light. The light is what sees!

Emaho! Your eyes are the four lamps blazing!

ADDITIONAL A++ TEACHINGS ON LAMPS AND REALMS:

Patrul Rinpoche's practical integration: The six realms are not places you go. They are ways awareness constricts itself. God realm: attachment to pleasure. Demigod: attachment to competition. Human: attachment to meaning. Animal: attachment to survival. Hungry ghost: attachment to satisfaction. Hell: attachment to aversion.

The lamp shines in all, but the constriction limits the view. Recognition dissolves the constriction. The lamp shines fully.

[249-254]
Mountain hermit's observation: I see the six realms in my own mind. One moment god-like pleasure, next moment hell-like anger. The lamp doesn't change. What changes is the constriction around it.

Practice is not about changing realms. It's about recognizing the lamp in whatever realm appears.

[137-142]
Garab Dorje's stark transmission: Six realms? Six lamps? Cut through! One awareness, one luminosity, one liberation. The realms are mind's display. The display is empty. Rest in what displays.

[1-286]
Singing yogi's six realms song:
God realm shining, pleasure's glow
Demigod competing, high and low
Human searching, day and night
Animal surviving, instinct's might
Hungry ghost craving, never full
Hell realm burning, aversion's pull

Six realms, one lamp shining through
Recognition is what liberates you
The lamp doesn't change, only the view
Your own face is the lamp's true hue

[1-286]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce cutting: REALMS? LAMPS? Cut through! One awareness! The six realms are empty display! The lamp is your own nature! Rest there!

[1-286]
COMPLETE SYNTHESIS:

The four lamps appear in all six realms:
- Distance-snare: the reaching of awareness
- Bindu: the essence of experience  
- Self-arising: spontaneous recognition
- Dharmadhatu: the space of all appearing

In each realm, the lamp shines. In each realm, recognition is possible. No realm is better. No realm is worse. All are display.

May all beings recognize the lamp in whatever realm they dwell.
May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate all paths.

Om ah hum.

[1-286]
FINAL ADDITIONAL TEACHINGS:

Patrul Rinpoche's last word on realms and lamps: The six realms are the display of one lamp. The lamp doesn't change. Only the constriction changes. Recognition dissolves constriction.

Mountain hermit's final realization: I have seen all six realms in my own mind. I have seen the lamp shining in each. The recognition is always possible, in every realm, in every moment.

This completes the commentary on lamps and realms.

Om ah hum.

You sit there, waiting for something to happen. Fool. The bindu already falls through your channels. The peacock's tail spreads in your own skull-cave. Don't look elsewhere.

Twelve similes—twelve traps for your conceptual mind. Vulture's eye, fish eye, cat eye, thief's eye. You want to understand? Look at your own eyeball. The light you see is your own rigpa shining back at you.

[1-286]
Peacock tail, vulture eye, fish eye, thief eye. These are not metaphors in a book. They appear in your meditation right now. You miss them because you wait for something grand.

Familiarization, measure, abode, door, actual, simile. Eleven aspects. You think knowing them helps? The lamp needs no student. It shines whether you study or not. But you must look.
