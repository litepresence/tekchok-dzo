Listen! From the center of the eye's essence, generally the four lamps appear. Particularly, the empty bindu lamp with self-light appears. From that: "Eyes of beings unobscured by conditions, through the door called cakṣu, like the sun's mandala, self-light and rays, appear as self-possessions."

[16610-16618]
Generally, from the right eye—distance-snare and prajna two. From the left—bindu and dharmadhatu two. At the Brahma aperture, awareness body lamp blazes in manner. From Jewel Garland: "Beings' path is the seeing door. That itself, right two, left two, center—lamp blazing manner dwells."

[16619-16620]

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Dear practitioner! Do you see? Your own eyes are the lamps! Right eye, left eye—distance-snare, bindu—all are wisdom's display. Do not look outside for light. The light is what sees!

Emaho! Your eyes are the four lamps blazing!

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Mix the unmixed. The unmixed is already mixed. Your own face is the mix.

[16743-16745]
You sit there, waiting for something to happen. Fool. The bindu already falls through your channels. The peacock's tail spreads in your own skull-cave. Don't look elsewhere.

[16746-16749]
Twelve similes—twelve traps for your conceptual mind. Vulture's eye, fish eye, cat eye, thief's eye. You want to understand? Look at your own eyeball. The light you see is your own rigpa shining back at you.

[16750-16755]
Peacock tail, vulture eye, fish eye, thief eye. These are not metaphors in a book. They appear in your meditation right now. You miss them because you wait for something grand.

[16756-16760]
Third sphere—completely pure lamp. Essence, definition, classification, nature, characteristic. You want to analyze? The lamp is already blazing. Your analysis is smoke obscuring the flame.

[16761-16767]
Familiarization, measure, abode, door, actual, simile. Eleven aspects. You think knowing them helps? The lamp needs no student. It shines whether you study or not. But you must look.

[16768-16768]
Five colors spread like a house under a barrel. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

======================================================================
[01-13-03-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


[Section] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

[Section] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

[Section] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

[Section] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

[Section] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

[Section] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

[Section] Voice 08 (Integrator): The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

[Section] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

[Section] Voice 12 (Ecstatic): Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

[Section] Voice 04 (Consort): The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
