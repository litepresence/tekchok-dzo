Singing yogi's six realms song:
God realm shining, pleasure's glow
Demigod competing, high and low
Human searching, day and night
Animal surviving, instinct's might
Hungry ghost craving, never full
Hell realm burning, aversion's pull

Six realms, one lamp shining through
Recognition is what liberates you
The lamp doesn't change, only the view
Your own face is the lamp's true hue

Garab Dorje's stark transmission: Six realms? Six lamps? Cut through! One awareness, one luminosity, one liberation. The realms are mind's display. The display is empty. Rest in what displays.

[16639-16647]
Listen! From the center of the eye's essence, generally the four lamps appear. Particularly, the empty bindu lamp with self-light appears. From that: "Eyes of beings unobscured by conditions, through the door called cakṣu, like the sun's mandala, self-light and rays, appear as self-possessions."

[16648-16656]
Generally, from the right eye—distance-snare and prajna two. From the left—bindu and dharmadhatu two. At the Brahma aperture, awareness body lamp blazes in manner. From Jewel Garland: "Beings' path is the seeing door. That itself, right two, left two, center—lamp blazing manner dwells."

[16657-16658]
Seventh, nature: From the nature (rang bzhin) of original kadag, clear light lhungrub bindu empty appears like a water-moon. The nature is complete.

Dear practitioner! Do you see? Your own eyes are the lamps! Right eye, left eye—distance-snare, bindu—all are wisdom's display. Do not look outside for light. The light is what sees!

Emaho! Your eyes are the four lamps blazing!

ADDITIONAL A++ TEACHINGS ON LAMPS AND REALMS:

Patrul Rinpoche's practical integration: The six realms are not places you go. They are ways awareness constricts itself. God realm: attachment to pleasure. Demigod: attachment to competition. Human: attachment to meaning. Animal: attachment to survival. Hungry ghost: attachment to satisfaction. Hell: attachment to aversion.

The lamp shines in all, but the constriction limits the view. Recognition dissolves the constriction. The lamp shines fully.

[16729-16734]
Humans self-luminous round itself. Animals all-to inner-to luminous. Pretas all-to subtle from. Hells self-appearance complete of. Thus and. Lamp blazing from.

[16731-16736]
Mountain hermit's observation: I see the six realms in my own mind. One moment god-like pleasure, next moment hell-like anger. The lamp doesn't change. What changes is the constriction around it.

Practice is not about changing realms. It's about recognizing the lamp in whatever realm appears.
