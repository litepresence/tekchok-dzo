See directly: In this manner. The liberating recognition is instant (cig car ba), never gradual.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

This hermit realized: This old man once. The very barrier is the gateway—gegs lam du khyer.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Recognition dissolves the intricate—before analysis, already complete.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

That also abides as essence-body. Dharma, enjoyment, emanation—three aspects like rain. Not divided, for division has no mode. Spontaneously accomplished, body-color and qualities are mind-objects yet nonexistent. Nature arises as light: white, red, yellow, green, blue—not marks, not signs. From compassion various arise. One as certain-nonexistent. Basis called because various appear.

The three that strike: See the nature. Remain there. Return when distracted. This is the great Dharmakaya. From Self-Arisen: Dharmakaya great primordial wisdom scripture. Characteristics: three forms. Essence, nature, compassion three. These are Dharmakaya characteristics.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Therefore: Hence. The structure. The treasury was never concealed, only overlooked.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The path seems long only to the one who has not recognized.

In the between-space (bar snang), mind meets mind.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

This old hermit laughed when he finally understood. Primordial wisdom meaning—realize without traversing path-ground. Expression-limit-free great Dharmakaya—abiding in all, realized by none. Mind nonexistent, consciousness nonexistent, ignorance nonexistent. Sometimes labeled as basis-abide primordial wisdom, sometimes Dharmakaya, sometimes liberation-basis. Nature one, reverse aspects spoken. Body and primordial wisdom without gathering or separation—this is the intention to know.

Second: definitive meaning. Profound and vast dharmas' essence gathered, called Dharmakaya. Third: divisions. Looking at original purity great meaning, nature completely pure, existing in body, adventitious stain-free supreme Dharmakaya—three aspects. Three bodies become nine when divided. From Self-Arisen: though body is inconceivable, gathered into three.

What? Dharmakaya—transcended from sign object. Sambhogakaya—transcended from grasped object. Nirmanakaya—transcended from attachment object. These are Dharmakaya's three. Dharmakaya-of-Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya-of-Sambhogakaya, Dharmakaya-of-Nirmanakaya. Dharmakaya-of-Dharmakaya is awareness.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Dharma appears as object. Body is unceasing awareness nature. Dharmakaya-of-Sambhogakaya is five lights. Dharmakaya-of-Nirmanakaya is eye sense-power seeing unceasingly. Dharmakaya object is completely pure sky. Dharmakaya abode is citta. Dharmakaya path is jewel crystal duct. Sambhogakaya also has three. See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! Stop dividing what has never been separate!

Sudden recognition! Consequently. Language points past language.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

No journey needed—already there.

Longchenpa shows what must be seen directly pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Nirmanakaya also three: Nirmanakaya-of-Dharmakaya, Nirmanakaya-of-Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya-of-Nirmanakaya. Thus: Nirmanakaya-of-Dharmakaya is two lamps. Nirmanakaya-of-Sambhogakaya is seeing five lights. Nirmanakaya-of-Nirmanakaya is individual self-awareness where five afflictions arise. Nirmanakaya abode is brain. Nirmanakaya path is eye. Nirmanakaya object is delusion-appearance.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Rest in: This wanderer. Obstacles transform into path—gegs lam du khyer.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The three kayas are not three separate places—they are one wisdom showing three faces. Like the same sun reflected in three different bowls of water. The reflections are different; the sun is one.

The divisions of Dharmakaya into three, then nine, then countless—are pedagogical devices, not ultimate truths. Like a teacher using many examples to explain one point. Don't confuse the examples with the point.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

In the secret mandala: Thus established. Words point to what exceeds words.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The final barrier is the one building barriers—seen through, it falls.

The elaborate is simple when recognized—before analysis, already complete.

ADDITIONAL COMPREHENSIVE TEACHINGS ON THE NINE KAYAS:

Patrul Rinpoche's systematic presentation: The three kayas divided into nine are not nine separate entities. They are nine ways of describing one wisdom—like describing an ocean from nine different shores. From each shore, the description differs, yet the ocean is one.

The Dharmakaya-of-Dharmakaya is rigpa itself—awareness aware of itself. The Dharmakaya-of-Sambhogakaya is the five lights—the display of awareness. The Dharmakaya-of-Nirmanakaya is the unceasing sense-power—awareness perceiving without interruption.

Don't mistake these divisions for reality. They are pedagogical devices. The truth is simpler: there is one luminosity, appearing in different ways to different capacities.

Garab Dorje's stark transmission: Nine kayas? Ninety kayas? Cut through! What counts the kayas? What divides the indivisible? The kayas are descriptions of your own face, not statues in a temple. Dharmakaya is not elsewhere—it is the awareness reading these words. Sambhogakaya is not elsewhere—it is the luminosity of that awareness. Nirmanakaya is not elsewhere—it is the display of that luminosity.

Stop collecting descriptions. Start recognizing.

Mountain hermit's thirty-year meditation: I spent three decades visualizing the three kayas. Dharmakaya above my head, Sambhogakaya at my throat, Nirmanakaya at my heart. Elaborate visualizations, precise colors, perfect forms. Then one day, laughing at a sunset, realized: the sunset was Sambhogakaya, the seeing was Dharmakaya, the moment was Nirmanakaya. All three present simultaneously, without visualization.

The ninefold division is for those who need structure. The recognition is for those who see directly.

Singing yogi's gentle song:
Three kayas, then nine, then countless more
Descriptions knocking at wisdom's door
But open the door and what do you see?
Not nine, not three, just awareness free

Dharmakaya's sky, so vast and blue
Sambhogakaya's clouds passing through
Nirmanakaya's rain falling down
All three kayas wearing nature's crown

Don't count the kayas, don't classify
Just rest in awareness, naturally high
The kayas are here, the kayas are now
In every perception, every brow

Lion-faced dakini's fierce cutting: Nine kayas? I see only one! The kayas you visualize are samsara's decoration. The kayas you recognize are wisdom's display. Cut through the multiplication! One awareness, one luminosity, one recognition. Everything else is mind's business.

A meditator has met practitioners who could list all nine kayas with their colors, directions, and attributes. But ask them "What knows the kayas?" and they fall silent. Scholarship without recognition is like a lamp without oil—shiny but dark.

Essence holder's spacious instruction: The nine kayas are like nine facets of one jewel. Turn the jewel, see different reflections. The jewel remains one. Dharmakaya is the jewel's essence. Sambhogakaya is its luminosity. Nirmanakaya is its reflections.

Rest in the recognition that you are the jewel, not the reflections. The kayas appear to you, but you are not the kayas. You are the awareness in which they appear.

Practical synthesis of nine kayas:

DHARMAKAYA aspect:
- Dharmakaya-of-Dharmakaya: Rigpa aware of itself
- Dharmakaya-of-Sambhogakaya: Five lights as display
- Dharmakaya-of-Nirmanakaya: Unceasing perception

SAMBHOGAKAYA aspect:
- Sambhogakaya-of-Dharmakaya: Five wisdoms unceasing
- Sambhogakaya-of-Sambhogakaya: Thigle with channels
- Sambhogakaya-of-Nirmanakaya: Rigpa appearing to senses

NIRMANAKAYA aspect:
- Nirmanakaya-of-Dharmakaya: Two lamps
- Nirmanakaya-of-Sambhogakaya: Seeing five lights
- Nirmanakaya-of-Nirmanakaya: Individual self-awareness

All nine are one wisdom showing nine faces. Don't prefer one over another. Don't merge them into oneness. Let them be as they are—your own display.

Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: The nine kayas are like nine costumes in a play. The actor wears different costumes but remains the same actor. Dharmakaya is the actor's essence. Sambhogakaya is the costume's beauty. Nirmanakaya is the performance.

Enjoy the play, but don't forget you're the actor. Don't get attached to costumes. Don't demand better roles. Play every part with recognition, and every performance becomes liberation.

Patrul Rinpoche's final warning: Don't make the kayas into objects of worship. Don't visualize them as external deities granting blessings. The Dharmakaya above your head is your own awareness. The Sambhogakaya in your throat is your own luminosity. The Nirmanakaya in your heart is your own display.

Worshipping external kayas is like praying to your own reflection. Turn around. See who reflects.

In my travels's summary: I've described the nine kayas extensively. I've explained their divisions, locations, and correspondences. Now forget everything. The kayas are not geography lessons. They're pointing to your own nature.

Sit down. Recognize your awareness. That is Dharmakaya. Notice its luminosity. That is Sambhogakaya. See its display. That is Nirmanakaya. One nature, three aspects, nine descriptions—all pointing to you.

FINAL INSTRUCTION ON THREE KAYAS:

The three kayas are not:
- Three separate Buddhas
- Three different places
- Three stages to achieve
- Three visualizations to perfect

The three kayas are:
- One awareness showing three aspects
- One luminosity displaying three ways
- One recognition knowing three modes

Dharmakaya: Empty essence
Sambhogakaya: Luminous nature  
Nirmanakaya: Unceasing compassion

Three words, one meaning: recognition.

May all beings recognize the three kayas as their own nature.
May the ninefold division reveal the one wisdom.
May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate all paths.

Om ah hum.

Look. See. Rest.

Complete.

Patrul Rinpoche's parting whisper: The nine kayas, the three kayas, the one wisdom—all words pointing to your own face. Turn around. See. Recognize. This is the completion of the commentary.
