[17524-17532]
See directly: In this manner. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[17531-17538]
This hermit realized: This old man once. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[17533-17544]
Voice 20 proclaims: That also abides as essence-body. Dharma, enjoyment, emanation—three aspects of rain. Not divided, division nonexistent mode. Spontaneously accomplished, body-color and qualities mind-object nonexistent. Nature arises as light: white, red, yellow, green, blue—not marks, not signs. From compassion various arise. One as certain-nonexistent. Basis called because various appear.

[17545-17553]
Three words. See what is. Rest. At delusion object, self-place and rest self-liberated. This is the great Dharmakaya. From Self-Arisen: Dharmakaya great primordial wisdom scripture. Characteristics: three forms. Essence, nature, compassion three. These are Dharmakaya characteristics.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[17554-17565]
Therefore: Hence. The structure. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[17559-17571]
This old hermit laughed when he finally understood. Primordial wisdom meaning—realize without traversing path-ground. Expression-limit-free great Dharmakaya—abiding in all, realized by none. Mind nonexistent, consciousness nonexistent, ignorance nonexistent. Sometimes labeled as basis-abide primordial wisdom, sometimes Dharmakaya, sometimes liberation-basis. Nature one, reverse aspects spoken. Body and primordial wisdom without gathering or separation—this is the intention to know.

[17572-17583]
Second: definitive meaning. Profound and vast dharmas' essence gathered, called Dharmakaya. Third: divisions. Looking at original purity great meaning, nature completely pure, existing in body, adventitious stain-free supreme Dharmakaya—three aspects. Three bodies become nine when divided. From Self-Arisen: though body is inconceivable, gathered into three.

[17583-17593]
What? Dharmakaya—transcended from sign object. Sambhogakaya—transcended from grasped object. Nirmanakaya—transcended from attachment object. These are Dharmakaya's three. Dharmakaya-of-Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya-of-Sambhogakaya, Dharmakaya-of-Nirmanakaya. Dharmakaya-of-Dharmakaya is awareness.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

[17590-17605]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Dharma appears as object. Body is unceasing awareness nature. Dharmakaya-of-Sambhogakaya is five lights. Dharmakaya-of-Nirmanakaya is eye sense-power seeing unceasingly. Dharmakaya object is completely pure sky. Dharmakaya abode is citta. Dharmakaya path is jewel crystal duct. Sambhogakaya also has three. See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! Stop dividing what has never been separate!

[17606-17617]
Sudden recognition! Consequently. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[17615-17629]
Nirmanakaya also three: Nirmanakaya-of-Dharmakaya, Nirmanakaya-of-Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya-of-Nirmanakaya. Thus: Nirmanakaya-of-Dharmakaya is two lamps. Nirmanakaya-of-Sambhogakaya is seeing five lights. Nirmanakaya-of-Nirmanakaya is individual self-awareness where five afflictions arise. Nirmanakaya abode is brain. Nirmanakaya path is eye. Nirmanakaya object is delusion-appearance.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

[17630-17643]
Rest in: This wanderer. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[17636-17643]
Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The three kayas are not three separate places—they are one wisdom showing three faces. Like the same sun reflected in three different bowls of water. The reflections are different; the sun is one.

[17640-17650]
Voice 20 proclaims: The divisions of Dharmakaya into three, then nine, then countless—are pedagogical devices, not ultimate truths. Like a teacher using many examples to explain one point. Don't confuse the examples with the point.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

[17645-17655]
In the secret mandala: Thus established.
 Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

[01-14-02-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
