First: Through the Vehicle of Characteristics, the path for those with sharp faculties and powerful minds arises. This also involves knowing the nature of the two truths of the basis, understanding how to practice, and showing the fruit of completing the path—three divisions.

The Vehicle of Characteristics—sutras and philosophical treatises—for sharp intellects. Not the quick path of tantra but the steady path of analysis. This old scholar once spent twelve years debating the two truths, filling notebooks, winning arguments. Then one morning he forgot everything. The forgetting was the understanding.

Characteristics, sharp faculties, analysis. Three supports for the Vehicle of Characteristics—or one support described three ways.

[1]
Sharp faculties cut through confusion like a sword through silk. But what cuts the sword itself? The two truths are not two—they are the same reality viewed differently. Conventional: the dream. Ultimate: knowing it's a dream.

[1]
Having known, how to practice? This is the key turn. Knowledge without practice is a map unread. Practice without knowledge is a journey without destination. The middle way walks both simultaneously.

[1]
Between knowing and practicing lies the gap where most stumble. Not-knowing-practicing is ignorance. Knowing-without-practicing is arrogance. Knowing-practicing-as-one is the path.

[1]
The fruit of completing the path—three divisions. Not stages like rungs on a ladder but aspects like facets of a jewel. Together they complete the view. Separate, they distort.

[1]
This wanderer has seen practitioners grasp one division and reject others. Like holding one facet of a diamond, claiming the whole. The three divisions need each other. The basis without the path is theory. The path without the fruit is endless journey. The fruit without the ground is hollow claim.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it. The understander dissolves in understanding. What remains is not a conclusion but an opening.

From the Treasury's heart: The Vehicle of Characteristics builds the foundation. Sharp minds analyze, know, practice, complete. But even this completion is provisional—Call out, the peaks of Minyak Gangkar returns your sound. The return is not the call. what transcends all vehicles.
