[1-144] From the first pure red, perfect empowerment, round, complete self-clear. From two pure fingers, becomes three. Then by pressing again and again, the colors of the five wisdoms—white, red, green, blue, and yellow—appear in the field through effort. Then also outer, without effort, going and coming by wind's portion, from mirror-pure shapes appear as portions of two and three. From constant familiarity with that itself, also by the five-color light, from mere slice, edge-cut appears, see measure from mere field-edge.

[-20460--20444] Five wisdom colors appear: white, red, green, blue, yellow. First pure red—the beginning. Two fingers becoming three—pressing again and again. The colors arise through effort, then without effort. The mirror-pure shapes—reflection without distortion. Five colors appear from five wisdom lights. The edge appears from mere slice—cutting through appearance to measure.

[1-144] Three words. Colors. Press. Appear. Five wisdom colors—white, red, green, blue, yellow. First red, then three, then five. Press again and again—the colors appear. Through effort first, then without effort.

[1-144] From finding familiarity's measure from that, with body to bindu center, abide while in pure half-body, to that with five-five pairs, connect with very clear bindu, possessing father-mother body-appearance, pure field from delusion-appearance ceasing. At the time of all these, the formerly demonstrated measures and sign-manners all arise. Wisdom-perfect appearance, space, and Dharmata pure appearance, awareness, and Bindu-ripen appearance, from body reaching measure as mandala, again conducting Dharmata cease-appearance.

[-20443--20434] The body at the bindu center, abiding in pure half-body. Five pairs of five—connecting with clear bindu. Father-mother—the union of wisdom and compassion. The pure field appears when delusion ceases. The three appearances: wisdom-perfect, Dharmata-pure, bindu-ripen. All manifest as mandala.

[1-144] From Thalgyur: "Wisdom-perfect appearance and from Dharmata's first appearance, from three appearances perfecting, become ceasing." Thus it is spoken. At this time, body-speech-mind measures. When seeing individual appearances, signs complete by ripening in self, ceasing measures all manifestly appear. Thus it is spoken.

[-20433--20424] The three appearances: wisdom-perfect, Dharmata-pure, bindu-ripen. They arise, perfect, and cease. The measures of body, speech, mind. The signs ripen in self. The ceasing appears manifestly.

[1-144] Thus by taking experience, those with supreme effort: three years. Middle ones: five years. Last ones: seven years, eleven months, six days: seeing Dharmata cease-appearance, liberating into light-body. From that same source: "By great and small effort in this, by days, months, and years, certainly accomplish at individual times. From times without much moving, reach individual measures."

[-20423--20414] Three categories of practitioners. Supreme effort—three years. Middle—five years. Last—seven years, eleven months, six days. The time depends on effort. But the goal is one: seeing Dharmata cease-appearance, liberating into light-body.

[1-144] This is the great essential point of secret experience-taking. Listen well, dear yogin: effort great-small-by, day and month year all-by, individual time-to certain accomplish. Move very without time all-from, individual measure-to reach indeed—thus. This experience take secret essential-point great.

[-20413--20404] Three words. Effort. Time. Accomplish. Effort determines the time. Some take three years, some five, some seven. But all reach their individual measure. The time depends on effort.

[1-144] Third day night wheel manner determine four: continuum-to sense-organ essential-point-to gather, memory door close. Dawn know object vase-in put, wisdom directly clear. Morning wisdom clear-to demonstrate, arise-feeling all self-place pure. Day appear vast-by strike, sign all suppress. This formerly also explain, here also leap-over companion-as explain summary experience take, little former-and not-different distinction exist.

[-20403--20394] The third day night wheel determines four: gathering the essential point at the sense organ, closing the memory door. Dawn—knowing the object in the vase, wisdom directly clear. Morning—wisdom clear demonstrates, feeling arises pure. Day—appear vast, strike, sign suppress. The leap-over practice explained here is not different from before.

[1-144] Day time elephant gaze-by manifest-to look, delusion-appear self-cease release sign suppress. Night time bindu empty lamp-to cognition place: bindu expand time cognition clear portion expand, decrease time cognition increasingly subtle go-from, end reference without go state, cognition reference think emanate gather without equipoise.

[-20393--20384] Day—the elephant gaze manifests, delusion appears, self-ceases, release sign suppress. Night—bindu empty lamp, cognition places: bindu expands, cognition clears, decreases, becomes subtle, ends without reference, emanates without equipoise.

[1-144] Sleep-to go time forehead center-in, bindu empty dissolve manner mind place having, sleep-of luminosity essence seize. Midnight-at heart within-of luminosity-to mind hold having sleep by, dream luminosity-to liberate having, habit-continuum cease. Then morning lion gaze by, bow-span-of sky-to AH white one-to consciousness place by, clear-empty elaboration-from free-of meaning within-from arise.

[-20383--20374] Sleep—when going to sleep, forehead center, bindu empties, dissolves, mind rests in luminosity. Midnight—at heart, luminosity holds mind, sleep liberates dream, habit-continuum ceases. Morning—lion gaze, bow-span sky, AH white, consciousness places, clear-empty arises free from elaboration.

[1-144] That manner-in how-much abide meditate—Six-Expanse from. Body-of posture press having, consciousness sky-of range-to cast. Like-that eye space-between-to, elephant-of gaze by, memory-without great-spreading great-as place. Like-that awareness sky-to place, this-from separate without. Yogin continuum-by what meditate: daytime appear expand-spread, nighttime self-of place house-in.

[-20373--20364] The manner of abiding and meditating—Six-Expanse. Body posture presses, consciousness casts to sky range. Eye space between—elephant gaze, memory without, great spreading place. Awareness sky place—separate from this. Yogin meditates: daytime appearances expand, nighttime rest in own place.

[1-144] Time four equal-of measure hold, sense-organ door all self-gather having, bindu empty-of lamp-to yogin endowed mind place. Emaho! Day-night wheel of luminosity.

[-20363--20354] Three words. Time. Measure. Hold. Four times equally—holding measure, gathering sense organs, bindu empty lamp, yogin mind place. The day-night wheel turns.

[1-144] Listen, practitioner: bindu itself expand time, consciousness itself expand place. Like-that bindu subtle become time, bindu increasingly-subtle-to, consciousness increasingly-subtle place. Sleep-and dream essential-point by, before attachment habit-continuum root-from extract. This-like nighttime time all-in, yogin fortune-with endowed act. This-by appear self-expand reach—thus.

[-20353--20344] Bindu expands—time expands. Consciousness expands—place expands. Bindu becomes subtle—time becomes subtle. Consciousness becomes subtle—place becomes subtle. Sleep and dream extract the root of habit-continuum. Nighttime—yogin acts with fortune, appearance expands.

[1-144] Like-that day-night wheel-continuum-by experience take having, delusion-appear self-cease luminosity-to liberate. That-from: body-and field-and awareness by, self-appear pure-of measure all hold. Like-that self-appear measure grasp having, six-classes delusion-of appear cease. That cease time-at, awareness measure-to reach. Like-that measure-to when reach time, self-of body-also not-appear.

[-20343--20334] Day-night wheel—experience taking, delusion appears, self-ceases, luminosity liberates. Body, field, awareness hold pure measure. Self-appear measure grasped—six classes delusion ceases. Awareness reaches measure—when measure reaches, body also not appear.

[1-144] Elements-by produced flesh-blood body, elements self-place-at pure cause. This field-as appear cause. Delusion-by grasped mind-of body, elements self-place-at dissolve cause. This-also not-appear self-place-at dissolve. Awareness-by grasped light-of body, water-moon mandala like. This time Dharma-nature cease-and near. This-in what familiar Buddha-field.

[-20333--20324] Elements produce flesh-blood body—elements pure cause. Field appears—delusion grasps mind-body, elements dissolve cause. Awareness grasps light-body—water-moon mandala. Dharma-nature ceases near—familiar in Buddha-field.

[1-144] Then body three limit exhaust having, action-free perfect body obtain. This time body-of limit all-and free-of near. Base-at familiar yogin-by, self-of place-also empty become. Path-at familiar yogin-by, elements coarse stain exhaust. Fruit-at indeed who familiar, not-return ground-to this-by reach—thus.

[-20323--20314] Body's three limits exhausted—obtain action-free perfect body. Body limits free—near base. Familiar with base—place becomes empty. Familiar with path—elements coarse stains exhaust. Fruit—reaching not-return ground.

[1-144] Also light-body-and samadhi-body two distinction: light-body awareness self-light stain without, Buddha-eye field-from sentient-being-by see unable. Samsara-and nirvana-in conduct, fruit appear-in not-abide wisdom one-cut-as arise fruit obtain.

[-20313--20304] Three words. Light. Samadhi. Distinction. Light-body—rigpa self-light, no stain, Buddha-eye unseen by beings. Samadhi-body—ripened habits, pure elements, seen by divine eye. Conduct in samsara and nirvana—fruit appears, not abides, wisdom cuts, fruit obtained.

[1-144] The light-body and samadhi-body have differences: light-body is rigpa's self-light without stain, Buddha-eye's object but unseen by sentient beings. Samadhi deity-body is ripened habitual patterns' born, extremely pure four elements' atoms, seen by sentient beings with divine eye.

[-20303--20294] Two bodies: light-body and samadhi-body. Light-body—self-light, unstained, visible to Buddha-eye only. Samadhi-body—born from habits, pure elements, visible to divine eye. Both are realizations of the path.

[Final] The practice of taking experience in thodgal: the five wisdom colors appear—white, red, green, blue, yellow. First through effort, then without effort. The body abides at the bindu center, in pure half-body. Connect with clear bindu, father-mother union. Three appearances: wisdom-perfect, Dharmata-pure, bindu-ripen. The time depends on effort: three years, five years, seven years. The goal is one—seeing Dharmata cease-appearance, liberating into light-body. The four times: gathering at sense organ, closing memory door, dawn wisdom clear, morning wisdom demonstrates, day appearances vast. Sleep—bindu dissolves at forehead, luminosity seized. Midnight—heart luminosity holds mind, dream liberates, habit ceases. Morning—lion gaze, AH white, clear-empty arises. The bindu expands, consciousness expands. The day-night wheel turns. Delusion appears, self-ceases, luminosity liberates. Body, field, awareness hold pure measure. Six classes of delusion cease. Awareness reaches measure—body not appear. Elements produce body—pure cause. Delusion grasps—elements dissolve. Awareness grasps light-body—water-moon mandala. Three limits exhausted—perfect body obtained. Light-body and samadhi-body—two distinctions. Light-body is self-light, unstained. Samadhi-body is ripened habits, pure elements. Conduct in samsara and nirvana—wisdom cuts, fruit obtained.

Emaho! The five wisdom colors! The day-night wheel! The light-body!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
