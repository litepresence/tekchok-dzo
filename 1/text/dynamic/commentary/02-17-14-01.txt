First: like royal caste receiving crown empowerment, obtaining one's own royal
seat unchanging—likewise rigpa obtains its own seat, unchanging from
Dharmata, thus own seat obtained.

This is not achievement. It is recognition of what was never lost. The king does
not become king through the crown. The crown reveals what already is. Rigpa
is not improved by recognition. Recognition reveals rigpa's unchanging nature.

Second: like one king leading armies through lands, reaching border frontiers,
the king with his retinue changes place without leaving anything behind—
likewise the five door consciousnesses' arising basis empties, thus samsara's
name becomes none.

The army moves but leaves no trace. Consciousnesses arise but leave no stain.
The border is not a place but recognition. Samsara's name disappears not
because samsara is destroyed but because it is seen through.

Third: like one king's excellent minister captured by another king, that king
must listen to whatever the other king says—likewise when mind
consciousness's moving stream ceases, the arising basis rigpa obtains self-
power.

When the moving mind stops, rigpa is not passive. It is self-powered, self-
arising, self-liberating. Not dependent on conditions, not controlled by
afflictions. The minister's capture represents mind's liberation from its own
movements.

The fruit of meaning does not reverse the cause, like the acacia fruit—not like
arising from effort-made. The meaning abiding primordially thus suddenly
spontaneously arrives, thus called fruit conventionally.

One practitioner once sought the fruit of practice. He thought effort would bring
result. Years passed. Finally he saw: the fruit was present at the beginning.
Practice did not create it. Practice removed the obscuration that hid it.

Second, the method for this: all-placement instruction of rigpa. All is rigpa's
nature—primordially self-arising, self-dwelling, self-liberating. Definitely-decided
rigpa: whatever dawns, that itself is the dawn-place. Without fabrication or
change, spaciously placed.

From Sixth Treasury: "Mind that exists as obtainable, hope-doubt itself self-pure,
free from effort-accomplishments, three kayas self-complete. Mind that exists
as countable, vehicles self-arisen."

The three purities are great self-purification of all grasping thoughts and karmic
tendencies of the three gates. Obtaining the intention free from hope and doubt
about samsara and nirvana.

From that itself: "Mind without sorrow, appearance free from hope-doubt, called
intention of definite natural placement—Samantabhadra also taught. Mind
without partiality, extremely subtle appearance, called intention of great free
from elaboration—Samantabhadra I taught."

Fourth, the fruit of afflictions self-liberating: at that time whatever afflictions
and conceptual constructs arise, they cannot be suppressed, without pair
meeting, directly self-dissolving, self-liberating—like water ripples or snake's
knot self-dissolving.

This is the yogin transcending Dharma, free from samsara-nirvana's grasping.
Arising and perception self-dissolving. From Sixth Treasury: "Mind appearing as
object, observed aspects self-purify in own place. Mind appearing as intellect,
feelings self-purify in own place."

Between the royal metaphors and the direct recognition of self-liberation, we
find no separation. The king is rigpa. The seat is the nature. The minister is
mind consciousness. All are metaphors pointing to what cannot be pointed.

Mountain hermit understood: "The king who obtains his seat is not different
from the beggar who recognizes his nature. The throne is not the point. The
recognition is the point."

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: stop seeking your seat! You are already
sitting on it. Stop trying to obtain what was never lost. The self-liberation is not
something that will happen. It is happening now, unnoticed.

The vital three: Recognize rigpa. Rest in rigpa. Return to rigpa. Hold these three, and the fruit is
complete. Forget these three, and even perfect practice will not help. The choice
is yours—and the choice itself is primordial wisdom's play.
