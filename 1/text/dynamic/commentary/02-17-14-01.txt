[3852-3920] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, like royal caste crown empowerment, own royal seat held, not changing; like rigpa own seat held, dharmata not changing, own seat held. Second, like king one country army led, border reached time, kingdom retinue with, change place none; like five doors consciousness arising basis empty, samsara name none. Third, like king minister good other king captured, that king also other king what says must listen; like mind consciousness moving continuum ceased, that arising basis rigpa self-power obtained.

[3852-3920] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Royal. Seat. Stop. The royal seat is not achieved. It is recognized. You are already king, already Buddha, already complete. The crown empowerment is not external. It is the recognition of your own nature.

[3852-3920] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man once sought empowerments everywhere! Crown, vase, bell, vajra—thought they would make me Buddha. Then realized—the empowerment was already complete. The crown was my own head. The vase was my own heart.

[3852-3920] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The three royal examples are the three consorts' embrace—empowerment as coronation, conquest as mastery, capture as binding. Rigpa sits on the throne, conquers samsara, is bound by nothing. This is the secret view.

[3864-3917] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Meaning result not-returning cause, like bse-shing fruit. Effort by made produced not, primordially thus abiding meaning peak nature arriving called result. Second, that method rigpa resting instruction: all rigpa nature primordially self-arisen self-abiding self-liberated certainty, rigpa whatever arises that itself arise-place there unfabricated directly place. From Klongchenpa: "Obtained mind essence, hope-doubt itself self-pure; effort-achievement with free, three bodies self complete. Countable mind essence, vehicles individual self-arisen; hope-royal intellect not, essence very secret complete."

[3864-3917] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Self. Liberated. Stop. You think liberation is something to achieve. It is self-liberated from the beginning. The fruit is not produced by the tree. It is the tree's nature. You are the fruit, the tree, and the ground.

[Final] Royal seat, conquest, capture—three examples, one recognition. The result is not produced. It is recognized. Rigpa rests in its own place, self-arisen, self-liberated.

Emaho! The result of natural spontaneity!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
