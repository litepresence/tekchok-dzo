[3852-3860] First: like the royal caste head empowerment, self taking the royal throne without change. Rigpa taking its own place, dharmata not-changing, taking its own place. Second: like when the king sends army to one frontier land and comes, the king-subject circle changes place with that. The five gates of consciousness dawn, ground empty, samsara name not. Third: like when the king's one excellent minister is captured and taken by another king. Like that king also must listen to what the other king says. The continuum of moving mind consciousness ceases. That dawn-ground rigpa obtains self-power.

[3852-3860] Three examples of how rigpa takes its throne. First—the royal empowerment, like a king crowned. You already are the king. The throne is your own mind. Second—the king sending army, the subjects change place. The five consciousnesses arise, samsara ends. Third—the minister captured, the king must listen. Mind consciousness stops. Rigpa gains its own power. Three stories, one meaning: rigpa is always already complete.

[3852-3860] Three words. Royal. Throne. Stop. You think you must become king. You are already king. The crown was never lost. The throne was always yours. Recognize this and you are crowned.

[3852-3860] Look at the three examples. Is there a king? Is there a throne? The king and throne appear together. The recognition and recognized are one. The empowerment is complete when you see this.

[3861-3870] Meaning: the fruit cause not-returning, like the sandalwood fruit. Not like arisen from effort doing. Meaning dwells primordially thus, nature arrives at fruit, word and concept say. Second: that method, all-placement instruction of rigpa, all rigpa nature primordially self-arises, self-dwells, self-liberates, definitely-decided rigpa, whatever dawns, that itself dawn-place, fabricate-change not, spacious place.

[3861-3870] The fruit is like the sandalwood—it doesn't need to be produced. It grows from the ground of its own nature. Not made by effort. The method is the instruction of rigpa—resting in the nature. The nature is self-arisen, self-abiding, self-liberating. Whatever arises, arises from that place. No fabrication, no change, just spaciousness.

[3871-3880] From the Six Vastnesses: "Obtain existence in mind-itself. By self-pure hope-fear. Free from effort-accomplish. Body three self complete. Wandering mind-itself, vehicles self-arisen, desire-king intellectual non-grasping, heart also great secret complete. Mind-itself directed object, appearances various self-arisen, name and color individual, in form as two aspects complete."

[3871-3880] The secret teachings of the six vastnesses. Mind-itself is the ground. Self-purified of hope and fear. Free from effort and accomplishment. The three bodies complete. Wandering in mind-itself, the vehicles arise naturally. The desire-king is not grasped. The heart is the great secret. Objects appear, names and colors arise—two aspects of the one reality.

[3881-3900] Limitless mind-itself, appearance objects truly dawn, object-substance self-arisen, directed thing complete. Thus it is spoken. Existence. Three primordially-pure gates, three grasp-thought action imprint, all self-purify, great-pure, samsara-nirvana hope-fear free, aim obtain. From that itself: "Suffering not in mind-itself. Free from hope-fear appearance. Like stable wisdom, all-good ones also teach. Appearance-less mind-itself, single aspect appearance, great hope-free meaning, all-good ones teach." Thus it is spoken.

[3881-3900] Three gates of primordial purity. Three imprints of grasping thought. All self-purify. Great purity—free from hope and fear of samsara and nirvana. Suffering is not in mind-itself. Appearance is free from hope-fear. Like stable wisdom—the Buddhas teach this-less mind—single aspect, great. Appearance meaning free from hope.

[3901-3920] Fourth: liberation's fruit. At that time, whatever afflictions and thoughts arise, unable to remain, straight self-liberate, like water-mirror or snake-knot naturally dissolves. Also, samsara-nirvana grasping free, one who has passed beyond dharma is called yogin. Experience and thought self-liberate, from six realms, appearing mind-itself, directed objects self-purify. Feelings self-purify, appearing mind-itself. Discriminations self-purify, form-appearing mind-itself, elements self-purify. Consciousness-appearing mind-itself, causes self-purify. Sense-awareness-appearing mind-itself, phenomena self-purify. Experience-appearing mind-itself, experiences self-purify. Perception-appearing mind-itself, afflictions self-purify. Thought-grasping free mind-itself, mindfulness aspects self-purify. Thus it is spoken. These are the essence of great completion, meanings involving mental elaboration.

[3901-3920] Three words. Self. Liberate. All. Whatever arises—afflictions, thoughts, experiences—all self-liberate. Not by rejecting, not by accepting. They dissolve like water in water. The snake-knot unties itself. The mirror reflects without effort. Everything purifies itself. This is the great completion—everything completing itself.

[3901-3920] Look at your thoughts. Are they binding you? The thought appears. Can you find the one who is bound? The thought liberates itself. Look at your afflictions. Do they have a center? The affliction arises. Can you find its root? It dissolves itself. This is self-liberation—not you liberates, but liberation liberates.

[Final] Royal seat—rigpa on its own throne. The three examples show the one recognition. Not produced, not created—recognized. The fruit is sandalwood, grown from its own nature. Self-arisen, self-dwelling, self-liberating. Whatever arises, arises from that place. The six realms appear, but mind-itself is free. All is self-purified. The great completion is complete.

Emaho! The royal seat! The self-arising! The self-liberation!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
