First has preliminaries and main introduction: preliminaries are preparing a retreat house half-open with sunlight's rays, crystal mirror stainless—a preliminary. From the Introduction Ornament Tantra: "The retreat place half-open, hole with sun's rays, mirror clear showing, light display seen outward."

I sat in retreat once... once spent three months preparing a retreat cave. Polished the crystal mirror daily, arranged the sun holes just so, set up the mandala with precise measurements. Finally his teacher came and laughed. "You prepare the vessel, but where is the wine? The recognition is not in the setup—it's in the seeing."

Patrul Rinpoche's practical instruction: Don't mistake preparation for practice. The crystal, the mirror, the sunlight—these are conditions, not causes. Recognition happens in awareness, not in setup. Prepare properly, then forget preparation and recognize.

Mountain hermit near a high plateau lake understood: the crystal is already pure, the mirror already clear. No need to polish what was never stained. The sunlight already enters—just open the hole. The recognition is not manufactured; it is revealed.
