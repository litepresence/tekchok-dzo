First has preliminaries and main introduction: preliminaries are preparing a retreat house half-open with sunlight's rays, crystal mirror stainless—a preliminary. From the Introduction Ornament Tantra: "The retreat place half-open, hole with sun's rays, mirror clear showing, light display seen outward." There, through Vajrasattva heart mirror's symbol introduction showing previous occurrence, in this Jambudvipa, from the Turning Samsara's Wheel Jewel Secret Tantra: "Holder of five buddhas' lineage, crystal stupa five-tiered, five wisdoms' nature, five sky-lineage holder, spreading in unseen sky, unmixed colors individually clear."

[9413-9455]
Listen here, dear practitioner! Jambu continent this-in arise manner: Samsara Dong-Sprug precious secret tantra-from! Buddha five lineage hold, crystal stupa thousand-span five! Wisdom five nature possess, sky expanse five lineage hold! Appear without sky-to pervade expand, color not-mixed individual clear! Essence nature compassion three: essence cease without pure ground, nature element great five, compassion form-body complete demonstrate!

Vajra space mandala-from, nature spontaneous complete body! Wisdom five possess water-moon body, not-clear clear self-nature possess! Crystal stupa thousand-span five, Vajra-Holder left-to descend! Tone aspect three possess, north-east direction-in corner-to enter! Nighttime direction-in daytime see, wisdom right corner near place! Buddha single certain see become, wisdom superior-seeing wisdom! Buddha intention single, nectar tongue-by meaning apply! Awareness cuckoo word one, change without vajra body supreme! Instruction commentary corner-proceed possess, Vajra-Mind testaments—thus!

Then thirty-three place, complete-victory palace upper-story, Potalaka descend! Then mountain five-peaks peak-to descend! Then Vajra-Seat-to descend! Then Gangs-Ti-Se-to descend! Then stupa great light-ray-as emanate, sentient-being concept dispel speak!

Beginning world this form time, vajra space mandala-from emanation nature blessing-from! Teacher Vajra-Holder being benefit-to, Joyful-Stacked gone left-to descend! Thirty-three-and, mountain five-peaks-and!

Thus the teachings spread for beings' benefit—know this, practitioner! All these descendings are for you, right now, in your own heart-mandala! Stop looking elsewhere!

Emaho! The descent of Vajra-Holder's blessing!

[9429-9455]
Essence, nature, compassion three—essence unceasing pure base, nature five great elements, compassion showing form bodies. From Vajra Space mandala, natural spontaneously accomplished body, five wisdoms possessing moon-water body, unclear-clear self-nature, crystal stupa five-tiered, descended to Vajradhara's left. Three aspects of sound-form, entering the corner of southeast, night direction day-like. Wisdom placed at right corner, alone certain buddha seen. Wisdom special insight is buddhas' sole intention. Nectar tongue meets meaning, rigpa's cuckoo one voice. Unchanging vajra body supreme, advice tikka corner-going, Vajrasattva's testament.

Emaho!

[9538-9584]
! Just as a crystal is pure by nature, clear inside and out without obstruction, so is the dharmakaya - the true nature of your own mind!

The crystal's inner light represents prajna, the life-force wisdom, while the outer clear light shows how emanation bodies arise. Do you see? The crystal itself demonstrates the ground (gzhi) wisdom, the primordial nature that abides unchanged!

Like a crystal reflecting all colors yet remaining pure and empty, your own awareness recognizes all appearances while itself remaining unstained. The lamp arrangements from the tantra show this directly - through example, through signs, through meaning itself!

Samantabhadra's appearance is like a mirror, dear one! When you look into a clear mirror, what do you see? Your own face! So too when you look into the nature (rang bzhin) of mind - you see the face of your own primordial wisdom, clear and unobstructed!

Do not seek elsewhere! The crystal-like rigpa is already present, spontaneously abiding, non-ceasing, without direction. This is the direct introduction to your own nature. Recognize it now!

Through example you understand the meaning. Through signs you gain confidence. Through deciding the essence, the three primordial wisdoms established in the base ripen as fruit. Without seeking, you see the result yourself!

Emaho!

[9585-9616]
! Like white light demonstrating compassion inseparable from itself - this is how the three kayas abide as one bindu!

Look here! When sunlight strikes a crystal, rays extend outward, yet the light arises from the crystal itself. So too does base-appearances arise from the base - but because of non-recognition, ignorance arises as knowable obscuration!

Samantabhadra transcends the base through wisdom's sense power! In a single moment, distinctions separate; in a single moment, complete Buddhahood! Before all Buddhas, like a great grandfather, already enlightened!

Dear practitioner, understand this: Buddhas without cause, without beginning or end, with a single wisdom eye unstained! The liberation base of Samantabhadra is demonstrated here. When you recognize base-appearance as it arises, you are liberated!

Yet sentient beings do not recognize their own appearances as self-appearances. Like various colored cloths placed over a crystal, like white light appearing as various colors - so does awareness arise as various delusions through the habit-continuum of rising and sleeping!

Do not be confused! These appearances are your own wisdom's display. Recognize them directly, without grasping. Rest in the nature (rang bzhin) as it is!

Emaho!

[9617-9633]
Wisdom body entered body's hollow, holding fourfold rigpa heart abiding, and pervading all sentient beings—shown. This is natural delusion-mode introduction. Delusion condition-arisen like crystal light, various things appearing like crystal light, appearing yet essence unchanging like crystal, inexhaustible increase-decrease absent like crystal light—understand these and properly join sign-meaning.

[9634-9665]
Sentient beings' liberation mode sign-meaning: From Blazing Lamp—"Base itself ripens result, knowing wisdom. Wisdom ripens as body, essence dharma body that, ripens as wisdom dharma body." From heart five wisdoms three-tiered, liver wind and wisdom's resonance two meeting, potency-mind arising, potency-base dissolving unmoving abiding example. Inner light outer-radiating white mind example. Sixth called mind. Five lights wisdom example. Base-holding rigpa. Mind and wisdom two example introduction thus established. Intermediate state introduction sound-light-ray three, Vajrasattva's inner channel-vein root introduction and so forth—on crystal establish certain knowledge, join yogin's face and knowledge, make certain and practice.

[9666-9696]
Liberation result mode: though inner-clear kadag liberation base self-arisen essence body clear, outer-clear five lights and white two mixed introduction, this having wisdom is crucial. Path wisdom or those wishing no wisdom, Madhyamaka extreme non-abiding, or us Dzogchen kadag no wisdom wishers—even if delusion purified from root, two bodies unceased arising, wisdom must exist in expanse. Five lights white mixed is mirror wisdom; white separately arising is sambhogakaya emanating nirmanakaya example. These are two purities possessing all aspects knowing buddhahood introduction.

[9697-9712]
Buddhas' parinirvana means sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya dissolving into dharmakaya—crystal sun's condition separated, original base kadag held unmoving unconfused abiding, essence inseparable thus ka-liberation, yet through recognizing-not recognizing difference, all as wisdom body alone abiding is called all-knowing. Especially wisdom two-possessing.

============================================================

[02-21-00-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
