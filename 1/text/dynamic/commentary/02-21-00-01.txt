First has preliminaries and main introduction: preliminaries are preparing a retreat house half-open with sunlight's rays, crystal mirror stainless—a preliminary. From the Introduction Ornament Tantra: "The retreat place half-open, hole with sun's rays, mirror clear showing, light display seen outward." There, through Vajrasattva heart mirror's symbol introduction showing previous occurrence.

This old fool once spent three months preparing a retreat cave. Polished the crystal mirror daily, arranged the sun holes just so, set up the mandala with precise measurements. Finally his teacher came and laughed. "You prepare the vessel, but where is the wine? The recognition is not in the setup—it's in the seeing."

[9413-9455]
Listen here, dear practitioner! In this Jambu continent, the manner of arising: From the Turning Samsara's Wheel Jewel Secret Tantra: "Holder of five buddhas' lineage, crystal stupa five-tiered, five wisdoms' nature, five sky-lineage holder, spreading in unseen sky, unmixed colors individually clear."

Essence, nature, compassion three—essence unceasing pure base, nature five great elements, compassion showing form bodies. From Vajra Space mandala, natural spontaneously accomplished body, five wisdoms possessing moon-water body, unclear-clear self-nature, crystal stupa five-tiered, descended to Vajradhara's left.

Three aspects of sound-form, entering the corner of southeast, night direction day-like. Wisdom placed at right corner, alone certain buddha seen. Wisdom special insight is buddhas' sole intention. Nectar tongue meets meaning, rigpa's cuckoo one voice. Unchanging vajra body supreme.

Mountain hermit near a high plateau lake understood: the crystal is already pure, the mirror already clear. No need to polish what was never stained. The sunlight already enters—just open the hole. The recognition is not manufactured; it is revealed.

Then thirty-three places, complete-victory palace upper-story, Potalaka descend! Then mountain five-peaks peak-to descend! Then Vajra-Seat-to descend! Then Gangs-Ti-Se-to descend! Then stupa great light-ray-as emanate, sentient-being concept dispel speak!

[9456-9537]
Thus the teachings spread for beings' benefit—know this, practitioner! All these descendings are for you, right now, in your own heart-mandala! Stop looking elsewhere!

This wandering yogi traced the descent from Potalaka to Gangs-Ti-Se. Each place is not a geography but a topology of mind. The thirty-three heavens are the thirty-three moments of recognition. The five-peaked mountain is the five wisdoms arising from one base. Stop counting and see.

Between the elaborate preparations and the stark recognition, we find the middle way. Set up the crystal, arrange the light, then forget the setup and see what is revealed. The preparation is the raft; the recognition is the destination.

[9538-9584]
Just as a crystal is pure by nature, clear inside and out without obstruction, so is the dharmakaya—the true nature of your own mind!

The crystal's inner light represents prajna, the life-force wisdom, while the outer clear light shows how emanation bodies arise. Do you see? The crystal itself demonstrates the ground wisdom, the primordial nature that abides unchanged!

Like a crystal reflecting all colors yet remaining pure and empty, your own awareness recognizes all appearances while itself remaining unstained. The lamp arrangements from the tantra show this directly—through example, through signs, through meaning itself!

Samantabhadra's appearance is like a mirror, dear one! When you look into a clear mirror, what do you see? Your own face! So too when you look into the nature of mind—you see the face of your own primordial wisdom, clear and unobstructed!

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why do all this preparation? The crystal is already pure! The light is already shining! Stop arranging and recognize! Cut through the elaborations!

[9585-9616]
Like white light demonstrating compassion inseparable from itself—this is how the three kayas abide as one bindu!

Look here! When sunlight strikes a crystal, rays extend outward, yet the light arises from the crystal itself. So too does base-appearances arise from the base—but because of non-recognition, ignorance arises as knowable obscuration!

Samantabhadra transcends the base through wisdom's sense power! In a single moment, distinctions separate; in a single moment, complete Buddhahood! Before all Buddhas, like a great grandfather, already enlightened!

Dear practitioner, understand this: Buddhas without cause, without beginning or end, with a single wisdom eye unstained! The liberation base of Samantabhadra is demonstrated here. When you recognize base-appearance as it arises, you are liberated!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you walk the circumambulation path, while you arrange the offering bowls, maintain this recognition. The crystal-like rigpa is already present, spontaneously abiding, non-ceasing, without direction.

[9617-9633]
Wisdom body entered body's hollow, holding fourfold rigpa heart abiding, and pervading all sentient beings—shown. This is natural delusion-mode introduction. Delusion condition-arisen like crystal light, various things appearing like crystal light, appearing yet essence unchanging like crystal, inexhaustible increase-decrease absent like crystal light—understand these and properly join sign-meaning.

[9634-9665]
Sentient beings' liberation mode sign-meaning: From Blazing Lamp—"Base itself ripens result, knowing wisdom. Wisdom ripens as body, essence dharma body that, ripens as wisdom dharma body." From heart five wisdoms three-tiered, liver wind and wisdom's resonance two meeting, potency-mind arising, potency-base dissolving unmoving abiding example. Inner light outer-radiating white mind example.

This old practitioner studied these correspondences for years. Heart and wisdom, liver and wind—each connection a doorway. Finally he understood: the body is the mandala, the organs are the palace, the elements are the deities. The introduction is not external; it is internal.

[9666-9696]
Liberation result mode: though inner-clear kadag liberation base self-arisen essence body clear, outer-clear five lights and white two mixed introduction, this having wisdom is crucial. Path wisdom or those wishing no wisdom, Madhyamaka extreme non-abiding, or us Dzogchen kadag no wisdom wishers—even if delusion purified from root, two bodies unceased arising, wisdom must exist in expanse. Five lights white mixed is mirror wisdom; white separately arising is sambhogakaya emanating nirmanakaya example. These are two purities possessing all aspects knowing buddhahood introduction.

[9697-9712]
Buddhas' parinirvana means sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya dissolving into dharmakaya—crystal sun's condition separated, original base kadag held unmoving unconfused abiding, essence inseparable thus ka-liberation, yet through recognizing-not recognizing difference, all as wisdom body alone abiding is called all-knowing. Especially wisdom two-possessing.

Essence holder's spacious instruction: rest in this. The crystal is pure whether you recognize it or not. The light shines whether you see it or not. Recognition doesn't create purity; it reveals what was never absent.

Final instruction: the introduction is not a transfer of something new. It is pointing to what you already possess. Stop seeking elsewhere. The five lights are your own light. The crystal stupa is your own heart. Recognize this, and the Treasury opens itself.
