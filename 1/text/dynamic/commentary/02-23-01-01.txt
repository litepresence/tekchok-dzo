[1-234]
The disturbances of the world fade, and the inner displays become clearer. Yet do not think 'I must have solitude!' The true solitude is the nature (rang bzhin) of mind itself.

The bardo is the intermediate state—the state between death and rebirth, between sleep and waking, between one moment and the next. The word "bardo" comes from "bar" meaning between and "do" meaning two—like a rope connecting two posts. The bardo is that connecting rope, the interval, the gap. In Tibetan, there are many bardos: the bardo of this life, the bardo of dying, the bardo of dharmata, the bardo of becoming, the bardo of dream. All are variations of the same principle: the mind in its naked state, unclothed by concepts.
