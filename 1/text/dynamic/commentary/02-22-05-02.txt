The eighth: those of inferior grounds. Seeing and Reducing and Realizing accomplishment, the Shravaka grounds, the Pratyekabuddha grounds—the eight inferior grounds. Stream-enterer, Once-returner, Non-returner, and Arhat grounds—four in all.

Eight inferior grounds. Four for shravakas—those who hear the dharma. Stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, arhat. Four for pratyekabuddhas—those who realize themselves. These are the lower paths. Not the highest, but steps on the way.

I once looked down on the "inferior" grounds. "I'm practicing Dzogchen," he boasted. "I don't need those lesser paths." Foolish pride! The stream-enterer has entered the stream—have you? The arhat is free from desire—are you? Don't despise the lower grounds. They are foundations without which the higher cannot stand.

After death, if in six days it trembles in the south, it is the Bodhisattva ground. Perfect Joy, Stainless, Luminous, Radiant, Difficult to Cultivate, Gone Afar, Immovable, Excellent Wisdom, and Dharma Cloud—the ten causal grounds. Universal Light, the resultant ground—eleven in all.

Look at the signs after death. Six days in the south—bodhisattva grounds. Ten grounds: joy, stainless, luminous, radiant, difficult, gone afar, immovable, excellent wisdom, dharma cloud. Plus universal light—eleven total. Each ground a stage. Each stage a recognition. But recognition is not staged.

Mountain hermit understood: the ten grounds are like ten valleys in a mountain range. You pass through each one, but the mountain is one. The perfect joy of the first ground, the stainless clarity of the second—they're not achievements to collect. They're descriptions of recognition deepening.

After death, if in nine days it trembles from above with some sound, one obtains the Vidyadhara ground. Maturation ground, Power over life ground, Great Seal ground, and spontaneous accomplishment ground—four in all.

Vidyadhara—holders of knowledge. Four grounds: maturation, life power, great seal, spontaneous accomplishment. These are the higher grounds of tantric practitioners. Not ordered by effort, arising naturally from practice.

This wandering yogi met a vidyadhara who had mastered the four grounds. "How long did it take?" he asked. The master laughed. "Lifetimes. But the recognition that ripened them? Instant. The maturation takes time. The realization takes no time."

Moreover, since these persons do not swiftly attain the result, having first obtained their respective grounds, they must dwell for long periods training to bring them to perfection—thus it is proclaimed. After obtaining their first ground, they must train for long periods to perfect it.

The grounds are not reached and finished. Each ground must be perfected through training. Like a student graduating but still must practice. The path is long. The patience must be great. Don't rush to completion.

Between the quick attainment of recognition and the long maturation of grounds, we find the vast middle way. Don't rush. Don't stagnate. The ground is recognized instantly. The habituation takes lifetimes. Both are true.

Through this practice, the material body becomes light, speech becomes melodious, and mind becomes all-pervasive. These are the signs of progress. Yet do not be attached even to these signs. The final result is beyond all signs and attainment.

Garab Dorje taught: First, recognition. Second, rest. Third, return again. The body becomes light—not heavy with attachment. Speech becomes melodious—harmonious with truth. Mind becomes pervasive—not limited to body. These are signs. Don't cling to signs.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why chase the grounds? Recognition is present now! Stream-enterer or vidyadhara—same recognition, different expressions! Stop counting and recognize!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you walk your daily path, remember—the stream-enterer is practicing. The arhat is practicing. The bodhisattva is practicing. You're all on the same mountain, just different elevations.

Final instruction: the eight inferior grounds, the ten bodhisattva grounds, the four vidyadhara grounds—all are skillful means. The recognition is one. The nature is spontaneously perfected. Don't cling to the stages. Rest in the nature.

Emaho! The many grounds, the one recognition, the complete nature spontaneously perfect!
