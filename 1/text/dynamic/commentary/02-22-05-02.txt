[11736-11746] The eighth: those of inferior grounds. Seeing and Reducing and Realizing accomplishment, the Sharavaka grounds, the Pratyekabuddha grounds—the eight inferior grounds. Stream-enterer, Once-returner, Non-returner, and Arhat grounds—four in all.

Eight inferior grounds. Four for shravakas—those who hear the dharma. Stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, arhat. Four for pratyekabuddhas—those who realize themselves. These are the lower paths. Not the highest, but steps on the way.

Three words. Inferior. Grounds. Stop. Eight grounds, but not the highest. These are the stages of those who have not yet recognized the nature. They climb, but the climb is not the destination.

[11747-11758] After death, if in six days it trembles in the south, it is the Bodhisattva ground. Perfect Joy, Stainless, Luminous, Radiant, Difficult to Cultivate, Gone Afar, Immovable, Excellent Wisdom, and Dharma Cloud—the ten causal grounds. Universal Light, the resultant ground—eleven in all.

Look at the signs after death. Six days in the south—bodhisattva grounds. Ten grounds: joy, stainless, luminous, radiant, difficult, gone afar, immovable, excellent wisdom, dharma cloud. Plus universal light—eleven total. Each ground a stage. Each stage a recognition. But recognition is not staged.

[11759-11763] After death, if in nine days it trembles from above with some sound, one obtains the Vidyadhara ground. Maturation ground, Power over life ground, Great Seal ground, and spontaneous accomplishment ground—four in all.

Vidyadhara—holders of knowledge. Four grounds: maturation, life power, great seal, spontaneous accomplishment. These are the higher grounds of tantric practitioners. Not orded by effort, arising naturally from practice.

[11764-11770] Moreover, since these persons do not swiftly attain the result, having first obtained their respective grounds, they must dwell for long periods training to bring them to perfection—thus it is proclaimed. After obtaining their first ground, they must train for long periods to perfect it.

The grounds are not reached and finished. Each ground must be perfected through training. Like a student graduating but still must practice. The path is long. The patience must be great. Don't rush to completion.

The grounds unfold over time. Not quickly attained. Long periods of training. The fruit ripens in its season. Don't force the flower to bloom. Let it open in its own time.

[11771-11780] Through this practice, the material body becomes light, speech becomes melodious, and mind becomes all-pervasive. These are the signs of progress. Yet do not be attached even to these signs. The final result is beyond all signs and attainment.

Three words. Light. Melodious. Pervasive. The body becomes light—not heavy with attachment. Speech becomes melodious—harmonious with truth. Mind becomes pervasive—not limited to body. These are signs. Don't cling to signs.

[11781-11793] Just as there are signs of realization, there are also signs of going astray. If you see displays but attachment arises, this is the demon of attachment. If you feel pride thinking "I am special," this is the demon of pride. Recognize these demons. Don't be fooled by progress.

Watch for the demons of attachment and pride. Progress can become a trap. The light body, the melodious speech, the pervasive mind—these can become objects of pride. Watch closely. The demon hides in the spiritual path itself.

[11794-11805] Indicate the six realms' rebirth when liberation is not achieved. Two paths exist: dharmata bardo and samsara bardo—without these, no path exists. Results: buddha or sentient being—no other destination.

Two bardos: dharmata and samsara. If you don't recognize, you go to samsara. If you recognize, you go to dharma. Two destinations: buddha or sentient being. No third option. Choose recognition.

[11806-11824] The five paths to buddhahood: accumulation, application, seeing, meditation, completion. The nature is complete.

Three words. Five. Paths. Complete. Accumulation, application, seeing, meditation, completion—five names for one path. The path is not somewhere you go. The path is recognizing you were never away.

[Final] The grounds of shravakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, vidyadhara. Eleven grounds, four paths, five progressions. All leading to the one recognition. The nature is complete. The fruit is certain. Don't cling to the stages. Rest in the nature. From the eight inferior grounds to the ten bodhisattva grounds to the four vidyadhara grounds—each stage a stepping stone. The shravaka grounds: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, arhat. The pratyekabuddha grounds: self-realization. The bodhisattva grounds: from perfect joy to dharma cloud. The vidyadhara grounds: maturation, life power, great seal, spontaneous accomplishment. All are stages. All are paths. But the destination is one—the recognition of rigpa. The five paths: accumulation, application, seeing, meditation, completion. Not five different things, but one path seen from five angles. The grounds may be many, but the ground is one. The recognition is one. The fruit is one.

Emaho! The grounds! The paths! The recognition!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
