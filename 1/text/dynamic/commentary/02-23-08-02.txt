[14589] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, realization arises.

[14589] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Realization. Arises. Stop. Realization is not something you create. It arises naturally when conditions are present. Stop trying to force it.

[Final] Second stage—realization arises. Let it come naturally.

Emaho! Realization arising!

See what is. Rest in recognition.
