First: Though wandering in samsara, awareness never corrupted. Through lama's introduction, recognize the wandering—joy arises.

You wander in samsara, lost. But awareness is always pure. Lama shows you. You recognize. Joy—the awareness was never lost.

Three words that liberate: Recognize primordial awareness. Rest without distraction. Return whenever lost.

[Final] Awareness pure. Lama points. Recognition. Joy.

Emaho!
