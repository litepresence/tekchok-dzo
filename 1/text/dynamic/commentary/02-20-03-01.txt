First: though wandering in samsara from beginning, awareness never corrupted.
Even lost in confusion, rigpa remains pure. What wanders never separate
from what knows.

[8970-8971]
This wanderer spent decades believing he corrupted his nature. Practice
became purification. Then lama pointed: "What knows it needs purification?"
The knowing—never corrupted, never pure. Just aware.

[8970-8971]
Like gold buried in mud—mud does not stain gold. Like sun behind clouds—
clouds do not diminish sun. Lama introduces, recognition dawns, joy arises.

[8970-8971]
Wandering happens. Recognition cuts through. Joy emerges. Three words, or
maybe just: Wandering is joy when recognized.

[8970-8971]
Emaho! Wanderer who never left home!

[8970-8971]
See. Your awareness right now—has confusion corrupted it? Recognize the
knower, joy arises naturally.
