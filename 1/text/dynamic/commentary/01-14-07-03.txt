Third: arising at the rim of the bindu.

The bindu within the heart, radiant with five colors, resembles a pellet of five-colored light. In size it is like a fish-eye. In its measure of light, like an eye in sleep. In its clarity, like the eye of a sky-goer with mind in motion.

At times, moved by the wind of pristine cognition, it quivers within the crystal-blue central channels and remains trembling. The bindu arisen through habituation is taken up in experience.

The appearance of manifest pristine cognition and the appearance of slightly purified pristine cognition arise. From one aspect of characteristic-holding pristine cognition purified, first as light-curtains appearing within the sphere of the senses, from that arise: boat-broken forms, flitting and darting, and dizziness. These appearances also arise.

This describes the visionary phenomena of dark retreat practice—the bindu appearing as five-colored light, quivering in the central channels. The progression from light-curtains to broken vessels to flickering movements marks the refinement of vision as practice deepens.

The five colors represent the five wisdom energies. The quivering indicates the wind of awareness moving through the channels. These are not hallucinations but the natural display of awareness when the coarse mind settles. When these appearances arise, rest in recognition—do not grasp at them, do not reject them.

The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.
