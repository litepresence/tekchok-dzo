Third: arising at the rim of the bindu.

The bindu within the heart, radiant with five colors, resembles a pellet of five-colored light. In size it is like a fish-eye. In its measure of light, like an eye in sleep. In its clarity, like the eye of a sky-goer with mind in motion.

At times, moved by the wind of pristine cognition, it quivers within the crystal-blue central channels and remains trembling. The bindu arisen through habituation is taken up in experience.

This old fool once sat in dark retreat for three months, waiting for visions. When the bindu finally appeared—five-colored, quivering, beautiful—he grasped at it. "This is it!" he thought. The vision faded. He learned: the bindu appears to those who don't grasp, dissolves for those who do.

The appearance of manifest pristine cognition and the appearance of slightly purified pristine cognition arise. From one aspect of characteristic-holding pristine cognition purified, first as light-curtains appearing within the sphere of the senses, from that arise: boat-broken forms, flitting and darting, and dizziness. These appearances also arise.

Mountain hermit described his dark retreat experience: "First, light-curtains—like aurora in the night sky. Then broken vessels—shapes that don't hold together. Then darting movements—like fireflies in summer. Each stage a purification, each appearance a sign of progress."

Between the expectation of visions and the resting in whatever appears, we find the middle way. The bindu is not a goal to achieve. It is the natural display of awareness when conditions are right. Like a rainbow—it appears when sunlight and rain meet. You don't create it. You don't own it.

This wandering yogi asked his teacher: "What do the five colors mean?" The teacher replied: "They mean you are seeing. Don't make them into philosophy. Just see."

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why analyze the bindu? It is your own face! The five colors are your own light! Stop interpreting and recognize!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you rest in darkness, while you wait for sleep, maintain the recognition that awareness is never dark. The bindu will appear when ready. Your job is to be present.

Final instruction: the visionary phenomena of dark retreat are not the point. They are signs along the way. The point is recognition—resting in awareness whether visions appear or not. The bindu at the rim is your own essence, your own nature, spontaneously displaying. Rest in that recognition.

Emaho! The wonder of five-colored bindu, quivering in the heart's center, the natural display of pristine cognition.
