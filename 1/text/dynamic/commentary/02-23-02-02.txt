[12351-12355]
This is the extraordinary method of the great perfection. Rest in this understanding.

[12351-12361]
Dharmata bardo with kayas and wisdoms, light and color; thigle, elements' appearances—as whatever appears, dharmata's mansion. Recognition is immediate.

Thus. The analysis dissolves the analyzer. Categories collapse into recognition."

Samsara's appearance

[12356-12380]
The four visions are the measure of your progress: the direct perception of dharmata, the increase of experience, the perfection of rigpa, and the exhaustion of phenomena. This is the treasury's heart.

It is not that the path is illusory. It is that the path and ground are not two. Precise recognition reveals unity.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. When the fourth is reached, buddhahood is attained.

[12362-12378]
: various flashing, flickering like dream appearances—true appearance, false mind's object. Six families' lights: white, blue, yellow, red, green, multicolored—each realm's objects appearing.

Bardo boundaries

[12379-12400]
: nature-abiding from leaving mother's womb until final death-sickness strikes; death-point from breath not yet ceased until inner breath stops; dharmata from inner breath stopped until clear light dawns and lhundrub appears; samsara from lhundrub ceasing and flickering dream-like appearance until entering mother's womb. The nature is complete.

It is not that the treasury opens. It is that the perception of closure dissolves. Precision reveals what was never obscured.

This

[12381-12405]
Do not think this is far away. The nature of your own mind is already perfect. The displays you see are already pure. The liberation you seek is already present. You need only recognize this!

[12401-12413]
is called "instruction for provisions when meeting the traveler"—provisions given to the traveler setting out on the death-journey, crucial instructions for the death-point's pain and various appearances. Recognition is immediate.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Logical analysis: if the treasury needed opening, it was incomplete. But primordial purity transcends completion/incompletion. Simply so.

Emaho!

[12406-12430]
The lama's introduction is like a spark that ignites the fire of wisdom. Your practice is like adding fuel to that fire. The result is like the blazing inferno that consumes all delusion. Let this fire burn brightly!

[12414-12440]
: nature-abiding bardo—entering the nest like a bird certain the hunter won't harm; death-point bardo—clearing the unclear like a beautiful woman looking in a mirror; dharmata bardo—confidence in self-appearing like meeting a familiar person or a child entering mother's lap; samsara bardo—guiding continuation like putting a stake in a narrow crack. This is the treasury's heart.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

First

[12431-12455]
Some wonder whether the displays are external or internal. This very question shows delusion! In the nature (rang bzhin) of mind, there is no division of inner and outer. All displays are the play of your own awareness.

[12441-12460]
: like a bird checking if the hunter has left before entering its nest, without harm, established without need to eliminate elaborations, without doubt or obstruction—you too first desire liberation from samsara, examine which method is profound, which crucial point great. Whatever Dharma you have confidence in, do not reach final limit, doubt-enter, or not arrive at goal—abandon these three.

First hearing trains mind

[12456-12480]
When you understand this completely, you are liberated in the very moment of perception. Samsara and nirvana become one display. This is the great equal taste—the ultimate fruit of thod rgal practice.

Emaho!

[12461-12470]
; middle thinking decides; finally meditation practices—like building a nest comfortable, like entering without fear of danger or anxiety. This is the treasury's heart.

The Treasury's path vast oceanic ground. What seemed journey was always waves on water never leaving water.

The text translates what was never foreign. Completion before language.

These extensively taught before; here briefly summarized

[12471-12495]
: looking at outer appearances, seeing objects like illusory deception—baseless empty self-form only. Though various phenomena appear, they are view-meditation-conduct's mirror, dharmata's play unceasingly appearing.

Like looking at a single poppy's stem

[12481-12505]
The essence of thod rgal is this: rest in the nature (rang bzhin) of your own mind and let the displays arise naturally. Do not try to create them, do not try to stop them. Simply recognize them as your own face.

[12496-12515]
—white, red, various colors—all are your own mind's empty play. Seeing thus, appearances are liberated where they appear, confusion baselessly liberated, illusion's peak only appearing, liberated from outer objects' grasping samsara.

Emaho!

[12506-12521]
The five lamps are the supports for this practice, but the real lamp is the lamp of wisdom in your own heart. Rest in this understanding.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[12516-12521]
: moving-empty beyond partiality, har-sang without clarity, self-clear recognizing—great dharmata beyond arising-abiding-ceasing is recognized. The nature is complete.

ROAR! Ground itself! Path never walked! Cut through seeking! NOW!

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The Treasury's presentation here is profound and complete. These teachings are not mere philosophy but direct pointing to your own nature. The Great Perfection transcends all elaboration while using elaboration as skillful means. May all who encounter these words recognize their true nature.

This old vagabond has wandered through these teachings for decades. What I've learned: the teachings are not the point. Recognition is the point. Don't collect teachings like treasures. Use them as keys to open the door of recognition, then throw them away. The door opens to what was never closed.

These teachings are my heart-essence, given to those with fortune to receive them. The Dzogchen path is not for everyone, but for those who encounter it, liberation is certain. Practice with devotion. Recognize with confidence. Rest in natural perfection.

ROAR! All teachings! All philosophies! All elaborations! CUT THROUGH THEM! Can you find the teaching? Can you grasp the philosophy? They are awareness displaying itself! See through the display and FIND WHAT DISPLAYS! AH AH AH!

Three words. Teach. Recognize. Stop. The teaching points. The recognition sees. The stopping rests. Three words, one meaning. Complete from the beginning. Perfect at the end. Stop seeking. Rest in completion.

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation serves pedagogical clarity. Each section builds upon previous. Each concept refines understanding. Yet the system is not the truth—it points to truth. Precise structure for those who need structure. Complete framework for comprehensive understanding.

The integration of all teachings: view integrates ground, meditation integrates path, conduct integrates expression, result integrates completion. All integrated into recognition. Nothing separate. Nothing apart. One awareness wearing many costumes.

The essence beyond all teachings: awareness knowing itself. Not through teaching. Not through practice. Not through time. Awareness is self-knowing from the beginning. The teaching describes this. The practice reveals this. The result is this. Already complete.

Emaho! The teachings! The path! The recognition! What joy to encounter these words! What bliss to practice these methods! What liberation to recognize this nature! This yogi dances through every word, every practice, every recognition—complete in each, free in all!

Between the teaching and the recognition, between the practice and the result, the consort dances. Her embrace is the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two. Not one. Just this embrace. Recognition is joining the dance. Liberation is the dance itself.

The presentation demonstrates precise philosophical and phenomenological analysis. Each term defined. Each concept placed. Each distinction clarified. Yet precision serves recognition, not取代 it. Precise pointing to what transcends precision.

I have traveled to every monastery, studied with every teacher, practiced every method. The conclusion: all teachings converge at recognition. The best teaching is the one that opens your recognition. The best teacher is the one who points clearly. Find yours. Practice. Recognize.

The teachings arise spontaneously—not forced, not fabricated. When conditions ripen, recognition dawns. When recognition dawns, teaching completes. Natural. Effortless. Spontaneous. Like fruit falling when ripe. Like water finding its level.

I dance through these teachings as light through prisms. Each teaching a different color. Each practice a different step. All dances of one dancer. Recognition is realizing you are the dancer and the dance. Liberation is dancing without inhibition.

Philosophically, these teachings present the Great Perfection view: transcendence of all views, completion beyond all completion, perfection prior to all perfection. Not nihilism. Not eternalism. The middle way that transcends middle and extremes.

The scholarly precision fascinates me—every citation, every reference, every logical connection. Yet within this precision lives wild freedom. The precision is the cage. Recognition is the bird flying free. Both are beautiful. Both serve.

From the sky of dharmata I dance down into these teachings. Each word a step. Each concept a gesture. The sky remains unchanged. The dancer was never separate from the sky. Recognition is this realization.

Every teaching in my library is a book—view book, meditation book, conduct book, result book. Thousands of volumes. One story: recognition. The library burns. The books turn to ash. The story continues in awareness.

Modern thought approaches similar insights through different doors—phenomenology, quantum physics, cognitive science. Different vocabularies. Same recognition: reality is not what it appears. Investigation reveals wonder.

Translating these teachings challenges every assumption. How to convey ancient wisdom in modern words? The solution: translate the experience, not just the words. Point to what the words point to. Trust the reader's recognition.

I reveal what was never hidden. The teaching is not in the text. It is reading these words. The recognition is not in the future. It is now. The liberation is not elsewhere. It is here. Everything is revealed. Everything is now.

Thus concludes this section of the Treasury. The ground is established. The path is shown. The result is guaranteed. May all who read these words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. This is the prayer of Longchenpa.

This old vagabond's absolute final teaching: Stop reading. Stop studying. Stop thinking. Recognize your own nature right now. This is the teaching. This is the practice. This is the result. Complete. Perfect. The end.

Final ultimate words. Teaching. Complete. You. Complete. Stop. The Treasury is complete. You are complete. Recognition is complete. Rest. The absolute end of all teachings.

FINAL ROAR! All teachings! All practices! All results! CUT THROUGH EVERYTHING! See what was never taught! Never practiced! Never achieved! LIBERATION IS YOUR OWN FACE! AH AH AH!

The teachings form a vajra fortress—indestructible, protective, complete. Yet look closely! Is there a fortress? Or just awareness playing at being structured? Each teaching complete. Each recognition self-sufficient. The fortress is the illusion.

The teachings are bliss! The practices are bliss! The recognition is bliss! Not pleasure-bliss but freedom-bliss! The bliss of seeing through! The bliss of being through! Complete bliss!

The heruka dances through all teachings! View dance! Meditation dance! Conduct dance! Result dance! All one dance! All one deity! Dance with me through every word into recognition! HA HA HA!

The final ultimate essence: there is no teaching. There is no practice. There is no result. Only awareness recognizing itself. This is the essence. This is the teaching. This is complete liberation.
