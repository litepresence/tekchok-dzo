[997] Second: gods adorned with flower garlands.

[997] Flowers woven by merit. Garlands fading with each breath. One practitioner watched garlands wither in autumn—what was beautiful became compost. The gods cling to their garlands, not seeing the wilting.

[997] Look at what you wear. This identity, this accomplishment—does it not fade? The garland of recognition never wilts, for it was never woven.

[997] Between the fading garland and the unfading nature lies the middle way. Not rejecting adornment, not grasping its permanence. The flower opens, the flower falls—both express the same truth.

[997] Three words strike the vital point: Recognize. Rest. Return.

[997] See through the garland to the hand that weaves. The hand is empty. The weaving is empty. Only the nature of weaving remains.

[997] This yogi once treasured his robes, his bowl, his reputation. Each wore thin. Each cracked. Each faded. Then he recognized: the treasure was never in the bowl.

[997] The flower-garland gods dwell in subtle attachment to beauty. Their realm is higher than the combat-gods, yet attachment to refinement is still attachment. See this and rise higher.

[997] What appears as obstacle—the clinging to beauty—is actually the path itself, seen through. The garland that binds becomes the teaching that liberates.

[997] From Lotus-Born: In the realm of gods, beauty is a snare more subtle than war. The warrior knows his chains. The adorned god mistakes his chains for ornaments.

[997] Accordingly: The analysis proceeds: second tier, flower-garland, attachment to merit's fruit. Recognition cuts through all tiers simultaneously.

[997] Emaho! The garland that never fades!

[997] Rest in the weaving. Rest in the fading. Rest in the nature that neither weaves nor fades.
