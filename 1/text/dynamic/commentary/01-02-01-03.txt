[1] Second: gods adorned with flower garlands.

[1] Flowers woven by merit. Garlands fading with each breath. One without learning... watched garlands wither in autumn—what was beautiful became compost. The gods cling to their garlands, not seeing the wilting.

[1] Look at what you wear. This identity, this accomplishment—does it not fade? The garland of recognition never wilts, for it was never woven.

[1] Between the fading garland and the unfading nature lies the middle way. Not rejecting adornment, not grasping its permanence. The flower opens, the flower falls—both express the same truth.

[1] Three words. Adorned. Fading. Nature.

[1] See through the garland to the hand that weaves. The hand is empty. The weaving is empty. Only the nature of weaving remains.

[1] This yogi once treasured his robes, his bowl, his reputation. Each wore thin. Each cracked. Each faded. Then he recognized: the treasure was never in the bowl.

[1] The flower-garland gods dwell in subtle attachment to beauty. Their realm is higher than the combat-gods, yet attachment to refinement is still attachment. See this and rise higher.

[1] What appears as obstacle—the clinging to beauty—is actually the path itself, seen through. The garland that binds becomes the teaching that liberates.

[1] From Lotus-Born: In the realm of gods, beauty is a snare more subtle than war. The warrior knows his chains. The adorned god mistakes his chains for ornaments.

[1] Thus. The analysis proceeds: second tier, flower-garland, attachment to merit's fruit. Recognition cuts through all tiers simultaneously.

[1] Emaho! The garland that never fades!

[1] Rest in the weaving. Rest in the fading. Rest in the nature that neither weaves nor fades.
