reveal the fourfold unelaborate—gateway to mind's change! This is the treasury's heart.

First, unelaborate of unelaborate! Through this, fortunate mind changes! Second, unelaborate without elaboration! The method to enter inside shown! Third, very unelaborate without elaboration! Concepts purify, mind changes! Fourth, special unelaborate without elaborate! Meaning of non-duality obtained!

These four empowerments are like four keys to four gates! Each opens deeper than the last! Body, speech, mind, consciousness—each finds bliss through purification!

reveal the three kayas' display! Unelaborate shows nirmanakaya field—aggregates, elements, sense bases emptied! Very unelaborate shows sambhogakaya field—mind's coming and going realized as non-existent! Special unelaborate gives dharmakaya prophecy—samsara and nirvana's attachment, subtle knowledge obscuration purified!

Like a knot untying itself! Like ice melting in the sun! Effortless self-liberation!

Second, self-face difference extensively explained! Four empowerments elaborated! Elaborate-with-elaborate—drink water, outer! Elaborate-without-elaborate—enter mandala, deity shown, name given! Elaborate-with-very-elaborate—sravaka vow, nine complete, breath held! Elaborate-with-special-elaborate—vase certain, body seal perfect!

Progressive like grades in school! Each builds the foundation for the next! You drink, you enter, you receive—each empowerment opens what was closed!

Also vase certain explained! Palace relied upon, deity clear! Student body becomes deity, four elements purified! Substance sun-moon given, consort given, practice certain, sign-meaning-word given!

Like receiving a key to a locked treasure house! Like being given the crown of a king! Receiving opens recognition!

Emaho! The four gates to liberation!

Thus established. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Dancing in space, distinctions play and dissolve. Who dances? Just play! Ecstatic empty play!

[30-30]
What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Attend. Recognize. Liberate.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[31-31]
See your own face. 

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[32-32]
The framework reveals. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Resting in the view, the treasury is the resting itself. Never closed. Spacious completion.

Thus. The path reveals itself as the ground. What seemed journey was always arrival.
