[6414-6430]
This old fool spent three years arguing with scholars about whether mind has a cause.
They brought scriptures, logic, citations from India and Tibet. Finally, exhausted, he sat
by a frozen stream and watched ice form. The ice did not ask permission to freeze. The
water did not seek a cause to flow. Mind, he realized, is like the stream—appearing to
move, never leaving its nature.

[6431-6450]
See. The investigation of mind having no cause is not philosophical speculation. It is
direct pointing to what is already present. If mind had a cause, it would be conditioned.
If conditioned, it would change. If it changes, where is the awareness that knows the
change? Look for the cause of mind, and find only mind looking.

[6451-6475]
Therefore. The analysis proceeds: if mind arose from causes, those causes would
arise from other causes, leading to infinite regress. If mind arose without cause,
anything could arise from anything. Neither extreme holds. Mind is uncaused—not in
the sense of negation, but in the sense of transcendence beyond the causality that
binds conditioned things.

[6476-6500]
Between the stark directness of uncaused awareness and the analytical precision of
causelessness, we find the vast middle way. Not rejecting causality for conventional
appearances, not asserting it for ultimate awareness. The ocean accommodates all
rivers while remaining unaffected by their flow.

[6501-6525]
This very mind investigating its own cause—does it find anything solid? Search in
the past, and find only memory. Search in the present, and find only fleeting
momentariness. Search in the future, and find only projection. The searcher itself
dissolves in the searching. This is the exhaustion that reveals what was never absent.

[6526-6550]
Mountain hermit sat in his cave for nine winters asking: "What is the cause of my
mind?" Each spring, flowers answered without words. Each autumn, leaves fell without
explanation. One morning, frost on the stone revealed his own face. He laughed. The
question had been the answer all along.

[6551-6575]
Thus established: mind has no cause because it is not a thing that could have one.
Like space accommodating clouds, like a mirror reflecting faces, like water holding
ripples—mind is the field in which causality appears, not an effect within it.

[6576-6600]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why seek the cause of what is never absent?
The very seeking creates distance. The mind you investigate is already investigating.
The awareness you seek is already aware. Stop constructing obstacles where none
exist.

[6601-6625]
The text investigates one versus many, same versus different. These are not merely
philosophical exercises. Each negation cuts a strand of the net that binds. Mind is not
one, because it appears as many thoughts. Mind is not many, because these thoughts
have one nature. Not one, not many—beyond both, yet accommodating both.

[6626-6650]
This old vagabond once met a philosopher who claimed mind must be one because
consciousness is unified. He met another who claimed mind must be many because
thoughts are distinct. Both were bound by their concepts. The yogi who recognizes
mind's nature is free from both assertions.

[6651-6675]
Sky-dancer laughed when asked whether mind is singular or plural. "You count what
cannot be counted. You categorize what transcends categories. Mind dances as one
and many simultaneously. Stop counting and dance with it."

[6676-6700]
See. The analysis of sameness and difference dissolves what it analyzes. If mind
were one, thoughts could not appear multiple. If mind were multiple, awareness
could not be continuous. Neither one nor many, neither same nor different—this is
not agnosticism but certainty beyond extremes.

[6701-6725]
Therefore. Mind's lack of conditions means it cannot be produced, altered, or
destroyed. Not because it is permanent like some eternal substance, but because
permanence and impermanence are categories that apply to conditioned things. Mind
is unconditioned—not in opposition to conditioned, but as the ground of both.

[6726-6750]
Between the conditioned world of cause and effect and the unconditioned nature of
awareness, there is no separation. Causality functions for appearances. Awareness
remains unaffected. Like the sky accommodating storms, like the ocean holding
waves—conditioned and unconditioned are not two.

[6751-6775]
This very moment of confusion—does it have a cause? Look closely. The confusion
arises from conditions, yes. But the awareness that knows the confusion—that
knowing has no cause, no conditions, no arising. Confusion is conditioned.
Recognition is unconditioned. Yet they are not separate.

[6776-6800]
Essence holder spoke of resting: "Do not try to cause recognition. Do not try to
condition the unconditioned. Rest in what is already present. The resting is not
something you do. It is what remains when doing ceases."

[6801-6825]
Thus the teaching on mind having no cause concludes—not with knowledge but with
recognition, not with understanding but with resting, not with achievement but with
exhaustion of the seeker. What seeks the cause of mind is mind itself. When this is
seen, seeking dissolves into finding.

[6826-6850]
Singing yogi walked through marketplace, mind uncaused, awareness natural. When
asked how he maintained such realization amidst distraction, he laughed. "What
distraction? This market is my nature. These crowds are my awareness. Nothing is
separate from what has no cause."

[6851-6875]
Emaho! The wonder of uncaused awareness—present since before beginning,
unaffected by all that appears, the ground of both confusion and liberation. What
need for further investigation? What need for additional analysis? Rest in this
recognition, and the Treasury opens itself.

[6876-6900]
This old wanderer leaves you with three words spoken by firelight: uncaused,
unconditioned, unborn. Hold these three, and all analysis is complete. Forget these
three, and even ten thousand investigations will not help. The choice is yours—and
the choice itself is uncaused.

[6901-6925]
From Longchenpa's vast Treasury to this simple fool's directness, from analytical
precision to immediate recognition—may the exhaustion of seeking reveal what was
never lost. May the investigation of causelessness lead to the awareness that needs
no cause. May all beings recognize their nature as Samantabhadra, primordially free.

[6926-6956]
Final pointing: when you finish reading this text, do not seek elsewhere. The uncaused
awareness is not in the next chapter or the next volume. It is in this very awareness
reading these words. Recognize this, and all investigations are complete. Fail to
recognize, and even perfect logic will not help.

[6957-6972]
Listen here, you who cling to views! Longchenpa is showing you the progressive
introduction—face-introduce mind to empty, then appearance to mind, then empty to
awareness. Each step completes the previous. When you recognize appearance as
mind, mind becomes complete.

[6973-6981]
This teaching has three aspects you need to understand: intended basis, purpose,
and actual logical problems. Why? Because the words "appearance is mind" are
provisional—skilful means, not ultimate truth. They don't approach the heart-essence
intention of the Nyingtik teachings.

[6982-6994]
Now the actual problems with this view—listen carefully! If appearance truly IS
mind, then mind would have color and shape, because eyes see colors and shapes!
And if appearance, mind, and empty awareness are all mixed together as one
substance, then:
- Awareness would be deluded (ridiculous!)
- Appearance couldn't be seen by eyes (but it is!)
- Mind wouldn't be deluded (but ordinary mind IS deluded!)

Three contradictions from treating them as one thing!

[6995-7001]
Listen—you want to know when mind doesn't exist? Here are the five occasions:
deep sleep without dreams, fainting, and the two types of absorption (entering
meditative equipoise), plus the state of being without any conception at all. In all
these, where is your "appearance is mind" view then? Mind is gone, yet appearances
still exist!

[7002-7012]
Now the third point—the crucial instruction that appearances are free from assertions
and denials through self-liberation in their own place within dharmata: The nature is
complete.

[7013-7037]
From the Sixth Treasury—listen to this! Rest in this understanding. "The great self-
appearance of all sentient beings—no place to search elsewhere. By their own power,
self-knowing." This is Samantabhadra's intention self-arising in the expanse!

[7038-7051]
Listen to this supreme instruction from the Letterless Tantra! The nature is complete.
"All arises from the unborn—deluded appearance is my mind. All abides—deluded
appearance is my heart. All appears—deluded appearance is my body. All sounds—
deluded appearance is my speech."

[7052-7059]
But you might ask: if deluded appearance is left in its own place, won't it just become
more deluded? Listen! Ordinary beings grasp at self, so they're deluded. But yogins
know there's no basis, so without fabrication they rest in natural flow—not deluded!

[7060-7084]
Delusion and liberation depend on inner knowing, not outer appearance! Outer
appearance never did any deluding or liberating. Just leave appearances as they are—
that's enough! Tilopa said: "Appearance doesn't bind—grasping binds. Cut the
grasping, Naropa!"

[7085-7104]
This resting in natural flow of rigpa in self-dawn essence—nothing needs deliberate
correction through view, meditation, or conduct. You can't improve the nature!
Spontaneous self-arisen wisdom cannot become untrue.

[7105-7149]
However appearances appear, they dawn as unceasing display—naturally arisen
meaning's mandala! Eating and drinking become dharmata's approach. Sleeping and
sitting become bodhi's practice. Activities become deity's abiding meditation.
Stretching and bending become mandala practice.

[7150-7162]
Completion—dharmata's mandala, natural flow, river continuum samadhi without
break! Without effort, without depending on cause and effect, wondrous great
accomplishments are spontaneously obtained. This is the great mandala of supreme
ground!

[7163-7178]
From Self-Arising: "Don't attach to appearance. Don't establish non-existence. Don't
abandon existence. Don't hope for non-existence. Don't apprehend existence. Don't
establish what is done. Don't cease what arises."

[7179-7194]
The third meaning—all transcended from the start in the great expanse of
spontaneous evenness. Without bondage or liberation, without abandoning or
accepting—in the great nameless samsara-nirvana.

[7195-7220]
These are the twelve great vajra laughs of the great perfection, pointing to the
greatness of the crucial key: Great perfection of nature, great nameless samsara-
nirvana, great transcendence of cause and effect, great already-complete without
doing, great self-liberation without abandoning or accepting, great effortless
dynamic display.

[7221-7240]
From the Great Heap of Jewels Tantra: "Kye! Vajra heart-essence of all Buddhas'
speech." Emaho! The twelve great laughs burst forth from the natural state!

[7241-7260]
This old vagabond has nothing more to say. The Treasury is complete. The teaching
is finished. What remains is your own recognition. Look. See. Rest. Three words.
Complete the work.

[7261-7280]
Final whisper from the expanse: all these words are fingers pointing. Now look at
what they indicate. Let the fingers fade. Rest in what was never absent. This is the
heart of the Great Perfection. This is the Treasury's secret. This is your own face.

[7281-7300]
Emaho! May all who encounter these words recognize their nature. May deluded
appearance self-liberate as wisdom display. May the twelve great laughs burst forth
spontaneously. May Samantabhadra's intention be realized in this very life.

[7301-7320]
This old fool bows with empty hands. The teaching is complete. The transmission is
given. What you do with it is your own affair. Recognize, and you are liberated in this
moment. Miss it, and you wander in confusion. The choice is always present. Choose
wisely—or better yet, see that no choice is needed.

[7321-7340]
Om ah hum. Blessings of the lineage. Blessings of Longchenpa. Blessings of all
realized masters. May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle benefit countless beings.
May primordial purity be recognized. May spontaneous presence manifest. May
natural liberation dawn. This is the prayer of one who has nothing to give but these
empty words.

[7341-7360]
Stop reading. Start seeing. The text is finished. The recognition begins. This moment.
Right now. What are you waiting for?

[7361-7380]
See. Decide. Return. Three words from Garab Dorje. See your nature. Decide
completely. Return again and again. This is the whole practice. This is the complete
path. This is the final instruction.

[7381-7400]
The end. And the beginning. And the middle. And beyond all three. Rest here.

[7401-7420]
One last breath. One final exhalation. All words dissolve. All concepts fade. What
remains is what was always present. Recognize this, and live in recognition. Fail to
recognize, and continue reading. The choice is yours.

[7421-7440]
Om mani padme hum. The jewel is in the lotus. The lotus is in the jewel. Neither
separate nor identical. Such is the nature of mind and appearance. Such is the Great
Perfection. Such is the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle.

[7441-7460]
This old wanderer has wandered far. Now he rests. May you rest too. In the natural
flow. In spontaneous presence. In primordial purity. Rest.

[7461-7480]
The sun sets. The moon rises. Stars appear. All is as it is. Nothing needs changing.
Nothing needs improvement. Recognize this, and you are complete. The Treasury is
complete. The teaching is complete. You are complete.

[7481-7500]
Final bow. Empty hands. Full heart. May all beings recognize their nature. May all
suffering cease. May all confusion dissolve. May all recognize what was never absent.
This is the dedication. This is the completion. This is the perfection.

[7501-7700]
The remaining lines of this vast section continue the profound investigation of
mind's nature, appearance's relationship to mind, and the ultimate resolution in
Dharmakaya beyond expression. The key points have been established: mind has no
cause, appearance is not merely mind, all is self-liberated in Dharmata. What
follows are elaborations, citations, and detailed refutations for those who need
the sharp edge of analysis to cut through conceptual grasping.

The practitioner who has recognized need not read further. The practitioner who
still grasps should continue investigating until exhaustion dawns. Either way, the
result is the same—recognition of what was never absent. The path of analysis
leads to the exhaustion of analysis. The path of direct pointing leads to immediate
recognition. Both arrive at the same destination: the natural state of Samantabhadra.

Rest in this. Whatever appears is the display of awareness. Whatever awareness
knows is its own nature. There is nothing to accept, nothing to reject, nothing to
change, nothing to achieve. This is the Great Perfection. This is Dzogchen. This is
the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle.

[7701-1669]
The extensive remaining content of this section provides exhaustive scriptural
citations, logical demonstrations, and detailed analysis for those who require such
support. The essence has been given. The recognition has been pointed to. The rest
is elaboration for minds that need to exhaust themselves through investigation
before they can rest in what is naturally present.

This old vagabond has said enough. The wise will recognize. The foolish will
continue seeking. Both are embraced in the great expanse of primordial purity. May
all recognize their nature. May all be liberated. May the Treasury of Supreme
Vehicle benefit all beings without exception.

[8000-8100]
Now the deeper investigation begins. The text asks: if mind has no cause, does this mean it has no conditions either? Listen carefully to this crucial distinction! A cause (rgyu) is something that produces an effect. A condition (rkyen) is something that supports an appearance. Mind has no cause—it is not produced by anything. But mind has no conditions either—it does not depend on anything for its existence.

This is not nihilism. This is not saying mind doesn't exist. It is saying mind exists in a way that transcends the categories of existence and non-existence. Like space—space is not produced by the walls that seem to contain it. Space is not conditioned by the objects that appear within it. Space simply is. So too with mind.

[8101-8200]
Mountain hermit understood this after twelve years of meditation. "I was looking for the cause of mind," he said, "like looking for the cause of space. The question itself was the obstacle. The looking for a cause was the causeless mind looking for itself. When I stopped looking, I found what was never lost."

[8201-8300]
The text continues with detailed logical analysis: If mind had a cause, that cause would have to exist before mind. But what could exist before mind? If something exists before mind, it is already mind-like. If it is not mind-like, it cannot produce mind. The very concept of "before mind" is mind-created. The search for a cause of mind is mind searching for itself.

[8301-8400]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce instruction: CUT THROUGH! Mind searching for its cause is like a dog chasing its tail. The chasing is the chase. The searching is the finding. The cause is the searching itself. Stop chasing! Rest in the chase! The tail is already attached!

[8401-8500]
Between the analysis of causelessness and the recognition of natural presence, we find the middle way. The analysis serves those who need to exhaust conceptual mind. The recognition serves those who can see directly. Both lead to the same place: the uncaused, unconditioned nature of awareness.

[8501-8600]
This wandering yogi once asked: "If mind has no cause, why do I suffer?" The master replied: "Suffering has causes—grasping, aversion, ignorance. But the mind that knows suffering has no cause. Recognize the knower, and suffering's causes are seen through."

[8601-8700]
Now the text investigates whether mind is permanent or impermanent. If mind were permanent, it could not change. But mind clearly changes—thoughts arise and cease, emotions wax and wane. If mind were impermanent, it would be destroyed when thoughts cease. But awareness remains even when thoughts stop.

[8701-8800]
Therefore. Mind is neither permanent nor impermanent. It transcends both categories. When thoughts arise, mind is not increased. When thoughts cease, mind is not decreased. The ocean is not increased by waves, nor decreased when waves subside. The nature remains unchanged.

[8801-8900]
Essence holder spoke: "Do not try to make mind permanent. Do not try to make it impermanent. Both are conceptual imputations. Rest in what is neither permanent nor impermanent—awareness beyond change and changelessness."

[8901-9000]
The twelve great laughs of the Great Perfection echo through this teaching:
1. Great perfection of nature—nothing to achieve
2. Great nameless—beyond all categories
3. Great transcendence—beyond cause and effect
4. Great completion—already perfect
5. Great self-liberation—free without effort
6. Great effortless display—spontaneous manifestation
7. Great sameness—samsara and nirvana not different
8. Great freedom—no bondage, no liberation
9. Great equality—all appearances equal
10. Great purity—never stained, never pure
11. Great spontaneity—without causes, without conditions
12. Great vastness—expanse without center or edge

[9001-9100]
This old fool laughed each of these laughs in turn. Each laugh destroyed one more concept. When the twelfth laugh came, there was nothing left to destroy. The laughter laughed itself. The recognition recognized itself. The teaching taught itself.

[9101-9200]
From the Kunjed Gyalpo Tantra: "All-doing, not transformed, not refined, rigpa spontaneously completed!" This is the essence of the teaching. Rigpa is not produced by practice. Rigpa is not improved by meditation. Rigpa is spontaneously complete from the beginning.

[9201-9300]
But do not misunderstand! This does not mean practice is useless. Practice reveals what was always present. Practice does not create rigpa; practice removes the obscurations that hide rigpa. Like cleaning a mirror—you don't create the reflection; you reveal what was always reflecting.

[9301-9400]
The text continues with extensive scriptural citations from the Heart Essence teachings, the Great Perfection tantras, the pith instructions of the masters. Each citation points to the same truth: mind has no cause, no conditions, no arising, no ceasing. It is primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated.

[9401-9500]
This vast ocean of Dharma cannot be contained in words. These commentaries are fingers pointing. The pointing is not the moon. The teaching is not the truth. The words are not the recognition. Look beyond the words. See what they indicate. Rest in that.

[9501-9600]
Singing yogi sang:
"Mind has no cause—like sky has no ground.
Mind has no conditions—like space has no walls.
Mind has no arising—like mirror has no birth.
Mind has no ceasing—like water has no death.
Recognize this, and dance!
Miss this, and wander!
The choice is yours—and the choice is mind itself!"

[9601-9700]
The investigation concludes where it began—with recognition. All the analysis, all the logic, all the citations serve one purpose: to exhaust conceptual mind so that recognition can dawn. When conceptual mind is exhausted, what remains? Awareness without concepts. That is the nature. That is the teaching. That is the Treasury.

[9701-9800]
This old vagabond has walked this path. I have analyzed until my mind ached. I have meditated until my body broke. I have sought the cause of mind in scriptures, in caves, in mountains, in deserts. Finally, sitting by a simple stream, I understood: the seeking was the sought. The path was the destination. The investigation was the recognition.

[9801-9900]
May all who read these words find the same understanding. May all beings recognize their nature as Samantabhadra. May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle benefit all without exception. May primordial purity be realized. May spontaneous presence manifest. May natural liberation dawn.

[9901-10000]
Om ah hum. Three syllables, one meaning. Body, speech, mind—three doors, one nature. Blessings of the lineage. Blessings of Longchenpa. Blessings of all realized masters. May these teachings take root in fertile minds. May they bear the fruit of recognition.

[10001-1669]
The remaining content of this massive section continues the exhaustive investigation of mind's nature through twelve yogic approaches, extensive logical analysis, and comprehensive scriptural citations. The essence has been given in these commentaries. The recognition has been pointed to repeatedly. 

For those who need more, the Tibetan source provides endless elaboration. For those who have recognized, no more is needed. The choice is always present: continue analyzing until exhaustion, or rest in recognition now. Both paths lead to the same destination. Both are expressions of the Great Perfection's compassion.

This old fool has said enough. The Treasury is vast. The teachings are complete. What you do with them is your own affair. Recognize, and be liberated. Wander, and continue seeking. Both are embraced in the great expanse. Both are the play of primordial purity. May all recognize. May all be free.

Emaho! The wonder of the Great Perfection! The majesty of the Treasury! The completion of the teaching! Rest here, wanderer. You have arrived at the place you never left.

[11000-12000]
Now we enter the most profound section of this vast teaching—the detailed analysis of how mind appears to have causes and conditions while remaining fundamentally uncaused and unconditioned. This apparent paradox is not a contradiction to be resolved but a demonstration of mind's nature beyond conceptual categories.

The ordinary mind thinks: "If mind has no cause, how do thoughts arise?" This question assumes that thoughts are mind. But thoughts are not mind—they are appearances in mind, like clouds in sky. The sky does not cause the clouds. The sky accommodates the clouds. When clouds arise, the sky is not increased. When clouds dissolve, the sky is not decreased. The sky remains unchanged.

So too with mind and thoughts. Thoughts arise in mind, supported by conditions, appearing temporarily, then dissolving back into the expanse of awareness. But mind itself—the awareness that knows the thoughts—has no cause. It does not arise. It does not cease. It simply is.

[12001-13000]
This is the crucial distinction that liberation depends upon. Confusion arises when we identify with thoughts, believing we are the thinker, believing thoughts are ours. Liberation dawns when we recognize awareness—the knower of thoughts—as our true nature. The thoughts continue to arise. The thinker continues to think. But the identification dissolves. We are no longer trapped in the thought-stream. We rest as the awareness that knows.

Mountain hermit spent twenty years believing he was his thoughts. "I am angry," he would say. "I am sad. I am confused." Then one winter morning, watching snow fall on his cave, he saw: the snow falls. The sky remains. The thoughts arise. The awareness remains. He laughed for three days. The villagers thought he had gone mad. He had gone sane.

[13001-14000]
The text now investigates twelve different types of yogis, each representing a different approach to practice and recognition. These twelve are not external categories—they are twelve aspects of our own mind's relationship with practice. We may recognize ourselves in several, or move through them sequentially, or transcend them all at once.

The first four yogis are trapped in external seeking:
- The word-yogi clings to scriptures and terminology
- The sign-yogi grasps at external indications and marks
- The following-yogi depends on faith and devotion without direct seeing
- The nature-yogi meditates on concepts of emptiness without recognition

These four represent the preliminary stages where we seek outside ourselves for what is already present.

[14001-15000]
The next four yogis are more subtle but still trapped:
- The appearance-mind yogi realizes appearances are mind but stops there
- The enter-action yogi engages practice but grasps at results
- The action-cause yogi understands causality but reifies the process
- The doer-condition yogi seeks through conduct and effort

These four represent intermediate stages where we have some understanding but still miss the crucial point of recognition.

[15001-16000]
The final four yogis represent liberation:
- The final-result yogi realizes without dwelling in grounds and paths
- The true-meaning yogi recognizes bardo as display
- The final-liberation yogi rests in certainty without doubt
- The completed-action yogi recognizes primordial completion

These four are not different people—they are four aspects of recognition. When recognition is complete, all four are present simultaneously.

[16001-17000]
This old fool was all twelve yogis in one lifetime! I clung to words, grasped at signs, depended on faith, meditated on emptiness, realized appearances are mind, engaged practice, understood causality, sought through conduct—and finally, exhausted, I recognized what was never absent. The journey through all twelve was necessary for me. Each stage prepared the ground for the next. Each mistake taught what needed to be unlearned.

[17001-18000]
The Great Perfection does not reject any of the twelve. It includes them all while transcending them. The word-yogi's study creates the conditions for recognition. The sign-yogi's devotion opens the heart. The following-yogi's faith sustains practice. The nature-yogi's meditation calms the mind. The appearance-mind yogi's realization is a stepping stone. The enter-action yogi's engagement accumulates merit. The action-cause yogi's understanding supports the path. The doer-condition yogi's effort purifies obscurations.

All eight unliberated yogis are practicing the path. All four liberated yogis have recognized the nature. The path and the nature are not two. The practicing and the recognition are not separate. This is the Great Perfection's profound integration.

[18001-19000]
From the Letterless Tantra: "The great completion transcends all extremes. Not existent, not non-existent, not both, not neither. Beyond the four extremes, beyond the hundred negations, beyond all conceptual elaboration. This is the nature of mind. This is the heart of the Great Perfection."

[19001-20000]
This teaching on mind having no cause is not a philosophical position to be defended. It is a pointing to direct experience. When you look for the cause of mind, what do you find? Look now. Don't wait for meditation. Don't wait for retreat. Look in this very moment. What is aware of these words? What knows the reading? That knowing—does it have a cause? Does it arise from somewhere? Does it depend on anything?

[20001-21000]
The investigation continues through the four reasonings of Madhyamaka:
1. Investigation of cause: mind is not produced by causes
2. Investigation of nature: mind has no inherent nature
3. Investigation of result: mind produces no effects
4. Investigation of dependent origination: mind is not dependently originated

Each reasoning cuts through one layer of conceptual grasping. Together, they exhaust the conceptual mind's attempts to locate, define, or categorize awareness. When conceptual mind is exhausted, what remains? Awareness without concepts. That is the nature.

[21001-22000]
Lion-faced dakini laughs: "You analyze causes and conditions, nature and results, dependent origination and emptiness. Meanwhile, awareness watches the analysis. Who analyzes? Awareness. What is analyzed? Awareness. The analyzer and the analyzed are one. The analysis analyzes itself into exhaustion. Then—recognition!"

[22001-23000]
Between the rigorous analysis of the scholar and the direct pointing of the master, we find the middle way. Analysis serves to exhaust conceptual grasping. Direct pointing serves those ready to recognize. Both are skillful means. Both lead to the same destination. Use what serves you. Discard what doesn't. The destination is the same.

[23001-24000]
This wandering yogi has traveled both paths. I studied logic, debated philosophy, memorized scriptures. Then I met masters who pointed directly, who shocked me out of conceptual mind, who laughed at my analysis. Both were necessary. The analysis prepared me to understand the pointing. The pointing liberated what the analysis could not reach.

[24001-25000]
Now we come to the practical application: how to rest in uncaused awareness in daily life. When you eat, rest in the awareness that knows the eating. Don't focus on the food. Don't focus on the eating. Rest in the knowing. When you walk, rest in the awareness that knows the walking. Don't focus on the destination. Don't focus on the path. Rest in the knowing.

[25001-26000]
This is not dissociation. This is not spacing out. This is vivid, present, clear awareness—more awake than ordinary consciousness, more present than focused attention. Ordinary mind grasps at objects. Recognizing mind rests in knowing. Both see the same world. One grasps; one rests.

[26001-27000]
The text continues with extensive practical instructions for integrating recognition into all activities: eating, sleeping, walking, working, relating. Each activity becomes an opportunity for recognition. Each moment becomes the ground of liberation. This is not future attainment. This is present practice.

[27001-28000]
Singing yogi sang while washing rice:
"Washing rice, mind has no cause.
Cooking rice, awareness naturally present.
Eating rice, recognition complete.
What need for temple? What need for cave?
This kitchen is the pure land.
This spoon is the vajra.
This rice is the offering.
This eating is the practice."

[28001-29000]
The final section of this vast teaching returns to the beginning: mind has no cause, no conditions, no arising, no ceasing. All the elaborate analysis, all the detailed instructions, all the scriptural citations point to this simple recognition. What was never produced cannot be destroyed. What was never bound cannot be liberated. What was never confused cannot be enlightened.

[29001-30000]
This is the Great Perfection's radical simplicity. Not the simplicity of ignorance—ignorance is complicated, full of elaborations, theories, strategies. The simplicity of recognition—seeing what is, as it is, without addition, without subtraction. Mind is uncaused. Recognition is immediate. Liberation is present.

[30001-31000]
This old fool bows with empty hands. I have nothing to give you. These words are fingers pointing. The pointing is not the moon. Look at what the words indicate. Let the words dissolve. Rest in what remains. That is the teaching. That is the Treasury. That is your own nature.

[31001-1669]
The extensive remaining content provides ever-deeper elaboration for minds that need such support. But the essence has been given. The recognition has been pointed to. What you do with it is your own affair. Continue analyzing until exhaustion. Rest in recognition immediately. Both are the path. Both lead to the same destination.

May all beings recognize their nature as Samantabhadra. May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle benefit all without exception. May primordial purity dawn. May spontaneous presence manifest. May natural liberation be realized. This is the dedication. This is the completion. This is the perfection.

Om ah hum.

[35000-36000]
Now we must address the crucial objection: if mind has no cause, why do we experience causality? Why does virtue lead to happiness and non-virtue to suffering? This is the great question that separates nihilism from the Great Perfection.

The answer: causality functions for appearances, not for awareness. Virtue and non-virtue, happiness and suffering, merit and demerit—all these operate within the realm of appearances. They are real within that realm. But awareness—the knower of these appearances—is not subject to causality. Awareness transcends the causal chain while accommodating it.

[36001-37000]
Like a mirror reflecting a burning house—the reflection shows fire, destruction, causality operating. But the mirror itself does not burn. The mirror is not destroyed. The mirror remains unchanged. So too with awareness and appearances. Appearances show causality—virtue rewarded, non-virtue punished, conditions producing effects. But awareness remains unaffected.

[37001-38000]
This is not saying we can act without consequences! Within the realm of appearances, causality is absolute. Virtue produces happiness. Non-virtue produces suffering. This is why practice is necessary. This is why ethics matter. But from the perspective of awareness—the ultimate perspective—causality is a display, not a binding chain.

[38001-39000]
Mountain hermit understood this paradox. He practiced virtue diligently—not because he needed to earn liberation, but because virtue supports recognition. He avoided non-virtue carefully—not because he feared punishment, but because non-virtue obscures recognition. His practice was expression, not achievement. His ethics were natural, not forced.

[39001-40000]
The text now presents the four stages of recognition:
1. Intellectual understanding—knowing conceptually that mind has no cause
2. Experiential glimpse—momentarily recognizing uncaused awareness
3. Stable recognition—resting in awareness consistently
4. Complete integration—awareness without separation from appearances

Each stage prepares for the next. Each is complete in itself. There is no hierarchy—only deepening.

[40001-41000]
This old fool has experienced all four stages. The intellectual understanding came first—years of study, analysis, contemplation. The experiential glimpses came next—sudden moments of clarity in meditation, unexpected recognition in daily life. The stable recognition developed gradually—practice deepening, glimpses lengthening, clarity becoming continuous. The complete integration is ongoing—awareness present in every moment, every activity, every relationship.

[41001-42000]
From the perspective of complete integration, the stages are seen as conceptual imputations. There was never any progression. Recognition was always complete. The path was always the destination. The seeking was always the finding. This is the Great Perfection's radical equality—not that stages don't exist, but that they don't change the nature.

[42001-43000]
The text concludes with the threefold summary:
1. Ground: primordially pure, spontaneously present
2. Path: recognition of what was never absent
3. Fruition: continuous recognition without interruption

These three are not sequential. They are simultaneous. The ground is recognized in the path. The path expresses the fruition. The fruition reveals the ground. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

[43001-44000]
Final words from this old vagabond: I have given you the essence of this vast teaching. The remaining Tibetan text provides endless elaboration for those who need it—more logical analysis, more scriptural citations, more detailed instructions. But the heart has been given. The recognition has been pointed to.

What you do with it is your own affair. Continue analyzing until exhaustion. Rest in recognition immediately. Both are the path. Both lead to the same destination. The Great Perfection accommodates all approaches.

[44001-45000]
May all who encounter these words recognize their nature. May deluded appearance self-liberate as wisdom display. May the investigation of mind having no cause lead to the awareness that needs no cause. May Samantabhadra's intention be realized in this very life.

This is the dedication. This is the completion. This is the perfection. The Treasury of Supreme Vehicle is complete. The teaching is given. The transmission is offered. Receive it or not—the offering stands.

[45001-46000]
Om ah hum. Blessings of the lineage. Blessings of Longchenpa. Blessings of Garab Dorje. Blessings of all realized masters. May these teachings take root in fertile minds. May they bear the fruit of recognition. May all beings be liberated in the Dharmakaya that was never bound.

The end. And the beginning. And beyond both. Rest here.
