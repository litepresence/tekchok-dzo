[6957-6962]
Listen here, you who cling to views! Longchenpa is showing you the progressive introduction—face-introduce mind to empty, then appearance to mind, then empty to awareness. Each step completes the previous. When you recognize appearance as mind, mind becomes complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. When you recognize mind as empty, happiness spreads through that emptiness. When you recognize empty as awareness—ah! That's dharmakaya itself, non-dual with space.

But watch out! Some hear "awareness itself and space are non-dual" and they attach to the words, grasping at some self-characteristic. They think they've got it conceptually. Don't be like that! This pointing is not the moon itself.

[6963-6972]
This teaching has three aspects you need to understand: intended basis, purpose, and actual logical problems. Why? Because the words "appearance is mind" are provisional—skilful means, not ultimate truth. They don't approach the heart-essence intention of the Nyingthig teachings.

The intended basis: Longchenpa said these words provisionally, to guide those who grasp outer objects as truly existent. From the Self-Arising Tantra: "Sometimes show appearance to mind." See? Sometimes—not always, not ultimately. This appearance-is-mind view is designated only to stop attachment to outer objects. That's the purpose. Nothing more.

[6973-6981]
Now the actual problems with this view—listen carefully! If appearance truly IS mind, then mind would have color and shape, because eyes see colors and shapes! And if appearance, mind, and empty awareness are all mixed together as one substance, then:
- Awareness would be deluded (ridiculous!)
- Appearance couldn't be seen by eyes (but it is!)
- Mind wouldn't be deluded (but ordinary mind IS deluded!)

Three contradictions from treating them as one thing! This distinction was explained before—don't think you can liberate yourself by just doing "appearance is mind" yoga. It's a step, not the destination.

[6982-6994]
From the Self-Arising Tantra, the Buddha himself said: "Appearance-mind yoga—all arise from my mind. If mind itself is realized, what is there to do? All expressing that word—I said not liberated."

Even the scriptures refute this view! If mind doesn't exist, appearance wouldn't exist either—yet it does. When mind ceases, appearance would cease at that same time—yet it doesn't. And appearance exists even when there's no mind—further proof this view has problems.

There are five occasions when mind doesn't exist, explained in the Middle Extremes.

Emaho! Don't get stuck in the provisional—keep moving toward the ultimate!

[6996-7001]
Listen—you want to know when mind doesn't exist? Here are the five occasions: deep sleep without dreams, fainting, and the two types of absorption (entering meditative equipoise), plus the state of being without any conception at all. In all these, where is your "appearance is mind" view then? Mind is gone, yet appearances still exist! This alone refutes that view.

To sum up: believing appearance is mind is great darkness of wrong conception—you must eliminate this!

[7002-7012]
Now the third point—the crucial instruction that appearances are free from assertions and denials through self-liberation in their own place within dharmata: The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The five outer elements don't exist—they're empty, naturally pure like the moon's reflection in water. No need to purify them! Inner mind's memories and thoughts naturally dissolve without trace—no need to destroy them with antidotes! Appearance and mind are spontaneously liberated from the start—no need to add acceptance or rejection! Rigpa is naked and bare—don't clothe it in elaborations!

Just release into great evenness without leaving a trace, and the five gates naturally enter as self-arisen self-liberation.

[7013-7037]
From the Sixth Treasury (Klong Drug Pa)—listen to this! Rest in this understanding.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

"The great self-appearance of all sentient beings—no place to search elsewhere. By their own power, self-knowing."

This is Samantabhadra's intention self-arising in the expanse! When you let go into the vast swaying of "khral ma khrol, sang ma seng" (unfabricated, unconstructed), everything becomes the mandala of spontaneously arisen meaning.

From the same text: appearances are all like illusions, dreams, reflections—unthought great image. Whatever arises in one's stream, appearances fall like rain, not remaining in the condition-stream. One obtains irreversible samadhi!

Emaho! When appearances self-liberate as delusion, how could non-delusion not liberate?

[7038-7051]
Listen to this supreme instruction from the Letterless Tantra! The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

"All arises from the unborn—deluded appearance is my mind. All abides—deluded appearance is my heart. All appears—deluded appearance is my body. All sounds—deluded appearance is my speech."

Look—seeing doesn't cease, appearing like my form. Hearing doesn't cease, sounding like my voice. Smelling doesn't cease, feeling like my scent. Tasting doesn't cease, spreading like my taste. Touching doesn't cease, moving like my mind. Secret afflictions are my miracles! Buddhas and sentient beings are my cemetery!

"All-doing I am—great self-clear appearance!"

[7052-7059]
But you might ask: if deluded appearance is left in its own place, won't it just become more deluded? The nature is complete.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Listen! Ordinary beings grasp at self, so they're deluded. But yogins know there's no basis, so without fabrication they rest in natural flow—not deluded!

From the Pearl Garland: "Sentient beings in samsara are bound by their own conceptions. Knowing they're natureless, definitely liberated."

[7060-7084]
Delusion and liberation depend on inner knowing, not outer appearance! Outer appearance never did any deluding or liberating. Just leave appearances as they are—that's enough!

Tilopa said: "Appearance doesn't bind—grasping binds. Cut the grasping, Naropa!"

This resting in natural flow of rigpa in self-dawn essence—nothing needs deliberate correction through view, meditation, or conduct. You can't improve the nature (rang bzhin)! Spontaneous self-arisen wisdom cannot become untrue.

From Rtsal Rdzogs: "By thinking, wisdom's meaning isn't found. If wisdom's meaning found by thinking, self-arisen wisdom becomes false."

Recognizing appearance and awareness as dharmata, whatever you do in conduct doesn't transcend dharmata!

Emaho! All activity becomes the path when resting in natural flow!

[7085-7104]
However appearances appear, they dawn as unceasing display—naturally arisen meaning's mandala! Eating and drinking become dharmata's approach. Sleeping and sitting become bodhi's practice. Activities become deity's abiding meditation. Stretching and bending become mandala practice. The three thousand worlds become spontaneously accomplished mandala.

Look at this!
- Rain falling by itself—splashing, sprinkling
- Roads and paths—the great natural line
- Footprints—colored sand of the mandala
- Movements—nature of mudra
- Speech—vajra recitation
- Thoughts—creation stage wheels
- Whatever appears—deity's display
- Your own body—the empowerment vase
- Descent—the continuous samaya
- Clear knowing—self-dawn instruction

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Birth and death become dharmata's familiarity. The six collections' object-appearances self-arise as realization!

[7105-7149]
From the Pearl Garland—marvel at this! The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

"Emaho! If appearances thus deluded also self-liberate, how could non-deluded not liberate? Whatever speech and activities—conduct of empty-aware-clear. Good and bad thoughts—meditation of river's great depths. Wrong view and right desire—yogin's view without distinction. All hope and doubt holding—uncontrived spontaneous result."

The Great Seal—by eating and drinking, approach. By sleeping and sitting, practice. Activities are deity abiding. Stretching and bending are mandala practice. The three thousand worlds are all mandalas where rain and steam sprinkle down.

Paths seen by beings are the great line. Footprints are colored sand dust. Those wanting to walk—posture itself! Moving limbs are mudra. However spoken—mantra words. Thoughts are creation stage. Mind movements are offerings. Form-appearances are deity body. Great sound speech is music. Your own body is the vase. Hair is the year's leaves, ornaments beautiful. Blood and water-essence waters are entrusted with essence substances. Self-appearing empowerments are given—perfect in un-transferred! Those wanting to transcend—samaya itself. Those wanting to protect—binding itself. Those wanting liberation—deviation! Those wanting non-existence—Supreme Sage!

All views are mudra's scope. Attachment to them is deviation experience. Clear knowing awareness is the instruction. Object and mind as two—field for that. Birth, aging, sickness, death—familiarity key. Six collections unceasing—realization!

[7150]
Thus whatever the yogin does, generating in dharmata's nature—the deity mandala with empowerment completion and instruction. Recognition is immediate.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Emaho! Every moment becomes the mandala when recognized!

[7151-7162]
Completion—dharmata's mandala, natural flow, river continuum samadhi without break! Without effort, without depending on cause and effect, wondrous great accomplishments are spontaneously obtained. This is the great mandala of supreme ground!

From the Tal 'Gyur:
"Thus all is dharmata—nothing to accept, nothing to place, nothing's dharmata. Whatever appears, from its own dharmata, there's no fabricated dharmata elsewhere. However done, unthought arises. Without abandoning or accepting—self-appearance!"

[7163-7178]
From Self-Arising:
"Don't attach to appearance. Don't establish non-existence. Don't abandon existence. Don't hope for non-existence.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Don't apprehend existence. Don't establish what is done. Don't cease what arises.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Don't view arising as fault. Don't abandon afflictions. Don't establish Buddhas. Don't meditate meditation. Don't view view. Don't cease deluded appearance. Don't seek pure appearance."

[7179-7182]
From Nor Bu 'Phrul Bkod: "When knowing that cognizes objects appears to objects, appearance is self-appearance. At that time, let awareness release into openness."

[7183-7194]
The third meaning—all transcended from the start in the great expanse of spontaneous evenness. Without bondage or liberation, without abandoning or accepting—in the great nameless samsara-nirvana.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. These are the twelve great vajra laughs of the great perfection, pointing to the greatness of the crucial key:

Great perfection of nature, great nameless samsara-nirvana, great transcendence of cause and effect, great already-complete without doing, great self-liberation without abandoning or accepting, great effortless dynamic display.

From the Great Heap of Jewels Tantra:
"Kye! Vajra heart-essence of all Buddhas' speech."

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Emaho! The twelve great laughs burst forth from the natural state!

[7196-7203]
"Kye Speech Vajra! Look at self-arisen wisdom's view—wonder! Beyond virtue and vice, beyond view and meditation! Ground unmoved—whatever body and speech do, free from benefit and harm of virtue and vice. Ha ha!"

[7200-7208]
"Look at the mode of abiding of reality's nature—wonder! Appearance doesn't change color, doesn't shift. However happiness or suffering is thought, nothing happens to the meaning. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra!"

[7204-7212]
"Look at the wisdom of great emptiness, source of all—wonder! Whatever memory-thought conduct is done, appears as display. However done, liberates as unborn in unceasing expanse. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra!"

[7213-7223]
"Look at wisdom of empty awareness pervading all—wonder! Unborn and abiding together from the start. Even if a man took sharp weapons and liberated all beings at one time, that person's stream is free from benefit and harm. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra!"

"Look at your own awareness, empty all-appearance wisdom—wonder! However appearing, all dawn as your own companion. Whatever appears, doesn't move from your own ground. Ha ha!"

[7224-7230]
"Look at awareness-empty all-liberated appearance—wonder! Your own antidote is greatest! Afflictions self-liberate by themselves. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra! Look at awareness-empty all's nature—wonder! Without effort, result self-found. One finished, all samsara-nirvana purified as nondual. Ha ha!"

Emaho! These laughs shatter all conceptual mind!

[7231-7244]
"Without practicing six perfections, collections complete at one time. Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra! Look at naked rigpa, great emptiness all-even wisdom—wonder! All activities appear as ornaments. All abandoning and accepting liberated by view. Ha ha!"

"Look at emptiness of emptiness, great primordial emptiness—wonder! All Buddhas abide at home. By activity and meditation—falls, becomes! Ha ha! Kye Speech Vajra! Look at nonempty emptiness, truly existent—wonder! Vehicle grasping at non-existence as self. Ha ha! Born, obtains unborn. Ha ha!"

[7245-7247]
When you look at your own rigpa nakedly, twelve laughs abide in the nature (rang bzhin)—effort self-pacified. One should turn to the great beyond-mind, dharma-exhausted.

[7248-7263]
Having explained Great Perfection's natural straightforward speech, one should believe in the mind's depth. Similarly, by the eight great marvelous words, one should turn to the meaning of samsara-nirvana dharma-exhausted objectless, from the Heap of Jewels: This is the treasury's heart.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

"Emaho! Speech Vajra Heart Essence, you listen! By the key of your own rigpa free from birth and death—even for those who cut the life of billions of beings, and those always practicing ten perfections—no difference even a speck, thus have I, Samantabhadra, taught!"

"Vajra of all Buddhas' speech—by the key of no elaboration in dharmata, between the person always habituating to emptiness and the person not making emptiness mind for even an instant—no difference even a speck in becoming Buddha, thus have I taught!"

"Kye Speech Vajra! By the key of rigpa itself uncompounded, between the faithful one who did immeasurable compounded virtue and the person always delighting in taking life."

Emaho! In the natural state, all extremes collapse into equality!

[7264-7290]
"No difference even a speck in completing the collections—thus have I taught! Kye Speech Vajra! By the key of rigpa's wisdom without coming or going—between the person with various dharmata signs arisen in body and speech, and the person who hasn't trained mind even an instant in study and reflection—no difference even a speck in seeing reality—thus I taught!"

"By the key of no birth or cessation in dharmata—between one experiencing hell's heat and cold, and one experiencing Buddhas' bliss—no difference even a speck in obtaining realization—thus I taught!"

"By the key of rigpa's unchanging nature—between cutting through dharmic elaborations and eternalist view—no difference even a speck—thus I taught!"

"By the key of dharmakaya existing in oneself—between extensive outer offerings and praise, and sitting without activity—no difference even a speck in obtaining result—thus I taught!"

"Therefore, those who practice these great self-arisen words, finding confidence in unmaintained experience, are Buddhas inseparable from appearance and three kayas."

These eight word-kings are established by eight great unchanging meaning-reasons. For supreme minds, explain literally. For lesser minds, explain through two truths so they'll understand later.

Emaho! The natural state is beyond all partiality!

[7291-7318]
From Self-Arising: "When lion utters its own roar, all carnivores faint and fear. When Great Perfection speaks its own words, all lower vehicles faint."

Therefore, this secret instruction for those without fortune who take cause and effect as definitive—keep secret! From the earlier text: "These words, don't speak them even a speck among hearers and self-Buddhas. Why? When they hear these words, they become fearful, terrified, faint. Not faithful to secret mantras, despising them—through that ripening they'll experience great hell. So don't even speak in the direction of wind!"

From general Secret Mantra: "To immature beings, revealing secret is the seventh root downfall."

From Bodhisattva Bhumis: "Showing emptiness to untrained mind is explained as root downfall." Therefore secret!

The eight marvelous words purifying eight consciousness-collections, twelve unchanging great adamantine letters—these bind to dharma-exhausted beyond-mind. Explained so heart-vessels don't contract. Without hope, doubt, binding, grasping—samsara-nirvana at one time released into great namelessness.

For great yogins who reach this nature, cause-effect virtue-vice explained directly—like Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, Tilopa. For us, though mind understands thus, not arriving through familiarity, so explain combined with not fearing nature and being careful about subtle karmic cause-effect.

[7320]
Thus twelve vajra laughs explained three times as three bindings become thirty-six—corresponding to purifying the twelve links of dependent origination: direct, reverse, and completely cut. Recognition is immediate.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Emaho! Secret teachings for those with fortune!

[7321-7327]
Understanding the meaning of these bindings briefly explained, the word-meaning elaboration is enough. The second general meaning—decisive cutting on the spot, binding has three: decisive view as self-arisen wisdom, intention maintained as time-free three times, dharmata rested as nothing exhausted from the start.

[7328-7354]
First: one's own rigpa, empty-luminous unchanging nature—this is bare wide-open direct nature. Decide definitely! Don't fabricate or mix anything with mind's view-meditation-conduct-result dharma. Practice uncontrived spontaneous great completion view-meditation, vast natural flow.

From Rtsal Rdzogs: "Secret mantra rigpa resting is the knot of view-meditation-conduct. For outer inner secret wisdom, mind's conceptions unmoved—this is secret mantra's secret view. Bhagavan Lion's dharmakaya abides in non-dual samadhi."

"From dharmakaya source of all, dissolving into vast objectless expanse. Without acceptance-rejection, it's conduct. Seeing self-appearance, it's view. Not distracted from that, explained as meditation."

"Without abandoning-placing, obtaining samadhi. Without falling to extremes, reaching own place. Uncontrived, self-arisen, complete from the start."

[7355-7357]
Second: maintaining intention as time-free three times has two aspects: placing inward in the nature (rang bzhin) of empty-luminous equal clarity without fabrication, fresh, shimmering, radiant openness. Recognition is immediate.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Emaho! Decisive view without elaboration!

[7358-7370]
Without break, vast openness, placing time-free three times' pure intention in great river depth—oral instruction of self-clear own-place expanse. This is the treasury's heart.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

First: adjusting body key and wind key, placing awareness self-clear appearance self-appearance without grasping-grasped—loosely!

From Sixth Treasury: "Suchness uncontrived, like sky unclouded. Self-dawn self-clear portion. Thus in clear sky, like sun's essence self-appearing. Nature stainless body. One gathered definite essence—this is my mandala!"

[7371-7394]
Second: practicing with ten great methods cutting time-three's mind connection: This is the treasury's heart.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

From same text: "One who doesn't follow past's trace, doesn't project future's hope, places present awareness in own place—all awareness without before-after mixes as one. One-gathered one nature called yogin of time-three equality."

Not tracing past's latencies. Not welcoming future's latencies. Not abiding present's latencies in stream.

By self-liberated memory method, mixing samsara-nirvana as nondual: cutting past memories' interval, pressing down future memories' head, letting present memories self-dissolve.

Not aiming at past mind. Not turning back to future mind. Not placing attention on present mind.

Not sending ransoms to past ignorance. Not casting fathers to future ignorance. Not taking present ignorance in lap.

Emaho! Cut all ties to the three times!

[7395-7416]
Not biting at past aversion. Not hooking future aversion. Not feeding present aversion.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Not gathering past delusion's clouds. Not cutting ground with future delusion. Not raining with present delusion.

Not answering past Buddhas. Not inviting future Buddhas. Not offering to present Buddhas.

Exposing past desire itself. Cutting future desires. Removing present desires from objects.

Not holding tight past jealousy. Not gathering mind with future jealousy. Not placing mind in present jealousy.

This is the yogin realized in time-three equality, called great yogin realizing samsara-nirvana nondual!

[7417-7420]
Also, three-time Buddhas are special rigpa wisdom experiences, instructed to abandon joy-fondness grasping. Other nine are objects of assertion-denial appearing, and self-abiding unspecified delusion. Grasping characteristics, cutting time-three's connection while abiding in dharmata—this is meditation on grasping characteristics.

[7421-7444]
Third: resting dharmata exhausted-nothing from start. From Seng Ge Rtsal Rdzogs: "Virtue doesn't realize Buddha meaning. If virtue realizes Buddha meaning, Great Perfection nature becomes false."

Emaho! Rest beyond all effort and achievement!

[7452-7464]
First: general explanation of self-liberation's meaning. Second: particular explanation of self-liberation's dharmata.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. Third: extensive expression of self-liberation's intention.

First: In the path of Ati Vajra Heart Essence extracting from afflictions, purifying afflictions without abandoning in place—not like Hearers abandoning, not like Bodhisattvas abandoning, not like lower mantra creation stage transforming, not like completion stage self-pacifying, not like general common vehicles taming with antidotes, not like Mind Section placing in own system, not like Space Section making that dharmata.

[7465-7490]
Why? If afflictions' suchness is not known as never experienced, not abandoned by abandoning. If mind abandons afflictions, abandoned and abandisher being one substance cannot purify. If wisdom abandons, mind doesn't see wisdom. Wisdom not seeing mind, not abiding together—actual contradiction—abandoned-abandisher term doesn't apply.

Not abandoned by before-after. Past-future substance contradiction. One exists, one ceases. If simultaneous, mutually mixed—abandoned becomes antidote, antidote becomes abandoned—for mind-stream one time simultaneous.

Also, afflictions arising from that mind itself—like body and shadow—no time of abandoning by abandoning. Similarly applies to training, etc.

From Sun Moon Union: "If suchness not realized, yogin like body and shadow. From that self-arisen—abandoning doesn't abandon. Training also not. Transforming doesn't transform."

Emaho! Self-liberated from the very beginning!

[7491-7502]
"Also not by such pacification. Without knowing direct superior seeing, like Mount Meru king of mountains—who can destroy it? Not liberated by antidote. Without knowing self-pure without searching, like muddy water wanting clear—clearing again and again, not cleared. Even clear, not dharmata. Without knowing self-appearance loose, like ordinary foolish appearance—apprehending grasping not reversed."

Know the key of self-liberation by itself like water's wave!

[7503-7532]
Here also two mind-levels: self-liberation with effort—when affliction arises, recognizing and placing in own place, self-liberated dissolved in nature of pure place, never distracted instant in great equal self-liberation, training dynamic display. Rest in this understanding.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Effortless: whatever arises cannot stand, self-dissolved dharmata, so method of viewing abandons without abandoning, liberated by nature flow or force.

From that same text: "These mind-levels two: with effort and effortless. With effort placed in own place, appearance familiarized measure. Wisdom-pure appearance itself. When outer inner all self-dawn, not born from conditions. However these arise, placed in own place self-liberated. Therefore yogin of appearance. Effortless like this: self-liberated by itself to itself."

Emaho! Self-liberation without searching or achieving!

[7533-7537]
"Whoever meets this, even with uninterrupted sins, liberated by familiarizing this—doubtless, narak. This is the treasury's heart.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself."

[7538-7542]
Second: particular explanation of primordial liberation's dharmata has three: showing no need for effort-antidotes because primordially liberated now self-liberated; instruction not departing from dharmata's nature; resting without ever experiencing going elsewhere from basis-free self-dissolution. This is the treasury's heart.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[7543-7581]
From Pearl Garland: "Not liberated by effort, primordially liberated from the start." Rest in this understanding.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Also: "Ignorance itself self-arisen, delusion's cause primordially Buddha. All-ground dharmakaya self-dawn, cut transmission's birth from root. Wish-fulfilling intention primordially abides, changers are self-placed. Breath primordially continuous, birth and death primordially nonexistent. Desires' objects primordially complete, grasping's extreme is meditation itself. Limbs unmoved primordially transcended, beings' path primordially traversed. Speech expressed inexpressible, primordially beyond speech and thought. Thought's dispersion primordially empty, primordially abides great meditation. Stains self-pure, abides great stainless wide-open. From no place of doing, from first free from activity-doing. From ground no arising, primordially self-arisen alone."

Emaho! Primordially complete, nothing to do!

[7583-7617]
From Tal 'Gyur: "Great Perfection nature's extreme: phenomena placed in own place. Appearance-awareness dharmata unified, primordial liberation just resting. Intention beyond mind; marked placed pure in own place; empty and existence extremes liberated; exhausted change without thought; mind-exhausted beyond thought."

From earlier: "Five elements primordially clear, appearance liberated in luminosity. Five senses naked placed, five grasping objects self-liberated in own place."

[7618-7627]
Also from Tal 'Gyur: "Self-mind liberation called—gone one to one nowhere. Mind without liberator, complete from ground without coming-going. Not found by examination, no cause. Rootless ground abides empty-luminous. Self-clear abiding mind, liberated by key without partiality. Liberated by time without reference. Liberated without effort without diligence. Liberated by confidence without effort. Explained liberation by confidence. Primordially liberated without returning ground. Self-liberated by itself without antidote. Relaxed release, even seeing place, completely liberated effortless."

Three gates primordially liberated, so from first no need for effort-liberation. Body need not transform mudra, etc.—elements self-liberated by key, not returning to six realms. Speech need not effort heart-essence recitation, etc.—expression clear-pure liberated, speech self-liberated by sound-meaning key. Mind need not effort samadhi meditation, etc.—whatever thought liberated by intention key. Nothing arising from other, self-liberated—impossible to have antidote.

Emaho! Liberation without antidotes or effort!

[7628-7667]
Liberation by just placing, liberation by just knowing key, primordial liberation, self-liberation, naked liberation, complete liberation, etc.—many, but here showing great self-liberation has no antidote, no effort needed.

Third: extensive explanation of self-liberation's intention has three: brief showing of essence; particular explanation of nature; conclusion of meaning.

From Pearl Garland: "To unceasing rigpa, no delusion cause so no return place. Primordially liberated, definitely transcended. Self-liberated, objects-conditions exhausted. Naked liberated, appearance pure. Extreme liberated, four extremes ceased. One liberated, multiplicity empty."

To nondual outer-inner wide-open rigpa—like crystal palace without stain—no ground key, no delusion cause, rootless rigpa without path. No path, no result-return place to three realms—primordially liberated like space, spontaneously complete intention.

Five great liberation modes, surpassing all common vehicles.

[7652-7671]
Five: primordial liberation, self-liberation, naked liberation, extreme liberation, one liberation. First primordial liberation depending on no-return key, showing all view-meditation effort-dependence unnecessary.

Wisdom pervasive generally spread—no doing, no fabrication. Not arisen from anywhere, not gone anywhere, not abiding anywhere—unchanging meaning.

Liberation not like untying, so view-meditation effort unnecessary. Liberation called abiding in own system—no acceptance-rejection meaning.

Emaho! Five liberations transcending all vehicles!

[7672-7717]
Like fruit of ali ka (eggplant) ripening from start—now no ripening cause. Recognition is immediate.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Primordial liberation has three: understanding primordial liberation; establishing valid placement; liberation mode.

Understanding: not adventitious, liberated from first, now no liberating—key is rigpa itself never experienced delusion.

Establishing validity has three: reasoning validity; scripture validity; reason validity.

Reasoning: primordially rigpa itself liberated—no ground so no return; no root so no source; no characteristic so not established; unborn so no liberation cause.

Sign of primordial liberation: no characteristic seen by any meditation-accomplishment. Validated by cause-effect traceless reasoning—rigpa no stream, no result, karma and ripening impossible.

Scripture validity: from Meaningful Diligence—"Mind itself primordially liberated—how could outer liberation condition exist?"

Reason validity: established by release-relax-place reason—placing primordially liberated, self-liberated in own place, primordially liberated.

Also knowing primordially liberated by key of no source, no abiding, no going.

Liberation mode: called liberated because mind empty; or unliberated—merely conventional term—sign of primordially liberated.

Emaho! Primordially free, nothing to achieve!

[7718-7749]
Liberated yet self-liberated. Like sky and clouds. Thus not like view-meditation conduct depending on other objects, with faults—"liberated by meaning" means dharma-exhausted.

Self-liberation has three: understanding self-liberation; establishing validity; liberation mode.

Understanding: no antidote meaning. Appearance itself self-liberated from appearance—no dharmata other than appearance. Similarly emptiness, etc.—nothing other than that itself liberating.

Like alcoholic cured by alcohol; poison destroyed by poison; iron cut by iron.

Afflictions liberated by that itself—called self-liberation.

Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.

Reasoning: dharmata's reasoning validates—all liberations are self-liberations, not other-untied. If other-liberated, like impossible one substance appearing as different forms. Like thing's characteristic established by thing.

Scripture: from Mind Section—"Liberation self-arisen, not from other."

Reasons: established by great self-liberation no-dispute reason.

Appearance self-liberated, no dependence on other antidote.

[7756-7777]
Liberation mode: nothing other than self-liberated by itself. Whatever appears, appearance liberates itself. Whatever arises, liberation by that. Appearances manifold yet self-liberated equal, like waves and water. Clouds manifold yet sky equal. Even water and ice equal as water.

All liberations equal in equality—no hope for liberation, no fear of delusion, no trace.

Emaho! Self-liberation without other antidotes!

[7765-7781]
No liberation cause or condition other than appearance. Liberated groundless—no abiding support, no root. Rootless mind itself—from Secret Heart: "This rootless mind itself—not male, not female, not neuter; not color, not shape; no mark, no class."

That itself no return place other than itself. No going place—never experienced birth. No arising place—nothing other than itself not self, called self-liberation.

Like snake's knot self-liberated without anyone untying.

[7782-7816]
Third: naked liberation depending on seeing-release key, showing no dependence on tantra-scripture. Just by naked seeing, liberated in that—mother-child meeting liberation. Appearance itself unmixed by mind, uncut by appearance, placed—self-pure liberated.

Naked liberation seeing-release has four: understanding; establishing validity; liberation mode; example.

Understanding: just by naked seeing, liberated in seeing that—first instant self-seen? Heard? Just by knowing—dharmata direct count reached!

Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.

Reasoning: no appearance mind-mixing, so basis-empty; empty-appearance equal; equal emptiness-appearance; awareness-appearance unseparated; equal-awareness; experience-liberation equal—so naked seeing.

Emaho! Liberated by naked seeing alone!

[7817-7840]
Knowledge entering others doesn't arise. Scripture validates: from Golden Essence Tantra—"By naked liberation's great view, Buddhas and beings both liberated."

Reason: validated by free-from-directions self-pure reason. Thus appearance nakedly liberated—placed in naked place, liberated where placed, released where liberated.

Liberation mode: trained on particular objects, particularly nakedly liberated—gone nowhere, come from nowhere, no place to go. Not changing wherever abiding. Trained on general objects, all appearance gone to naked liberation.

Example: like sense-capable person going to temple—no viewing duality.

[7841-7870]
Fourth: extreme liberation depending on freedom-from-reference key—reference not applicable anywhere. Liberated from one extreme, not abiding as two, liberated from two so not abiding as one. Similarly both, neither, etc.

Extreme: existence-extreme appearance, nonexistence-extreme non-appearance, both, neither—four extremes ceased called liberation.

Extreme liberation free-from-reference has three: understanding; establishing validity; liberation mode.

Understanding: existence, nonexistence, appearance, emptiness extremes—reference inapplicable. Beyond this-is, this-isn't calculation.

Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.

Reasoning: validated by reference-free nature reasoning.

Emaho! Liberated from all extremes and references!

[7871-7917]
From Great Dynamic Display Qualities Scripture: "Liberated by being free from extremes." Rest in this understanding.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Reason: validated by one-known all-liberated reason. Knowing one free from extreme, thus appearance-concepts all liberated—no reference applicable anywhere.

Liberation mode: not abiding in existence extreme, liberated from nonexistence extreme. Not abiding in nonexistence extreme, liberated from existence extreme. Not abiding in both, liberated from both. Neither, liberated from neither.

[7887-7918]
Fifth: one liberation depending on peerless key, showing method and wisdom not dependent. One is Great Perfection single thigle free from elaborations. Liberated in that nature, all multiplicities' extremes empty.

One liberation peerless key has four: understanding; establishing validity; liberation mode; example.

Understanding: one liberation not invalid—nothing unrecognized from one liberated as one. Therefore rigpa beyond primordially liberated or not terminology.

Establishing validity has three: reasoning, scripture, reasons.

Reasoning: all liberations not different—called liberation from one, nothing other. One itself is rigpa. Nothing other than self-knowing alone.

Scripture: from Golden Essence—"One alone liberated dharmata—multiplicity one taste."

Reasons: validated by one-known all-liberated. Knowing one as rigpa, all samsara-nirvana liberated.

Liberation mode: all appearance-awareness liberated by recognizing dharmata.

Emaho! One taste liberates all!

[7923-7933]
Example: all salts' taste established, or molasses, or fire—knowing one knows all. From Bodhicitta Commentary: "Fire's nature hot, molasses' nature sweet—thus all dharmas' nature empty one."

[7932-7963]
Thus five liberation modes not for one individual—by sense-faculty differences, whichever suitable liberates. This is the treasury's heart.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Third: five liberation modes' conclusion showing five: here five liberation modes free from reference—self-liberation free from object view-meditation-conduct dharma reference. Conditions liberated by conditions—like stain washed by stain, bad conditions liberated by bad, dawn as wisdom's companion.

Primordial purity liberated by primordial purity, rigpa liberated by rigpa.

Primordial liberation free from grasping-grasped unified reference—objects liberated by objects, like poison destroyed by poison.

Naked liberation not referencing samsara-nirvana—causes liberated by causes, like iron cut by iron.

Extreme liberation not referencing terminology words—dharmas liberated by dharmas, like wood-born fire burning that wood.

One liberation not referencing liberating mind—mind itself liberated by mind, like stone breaking stones.

From Pearl Garland: "Conditions liberated by conditions—I don't look at object dharmas. Objects liberated by objects—I don't look at grasping-grasped two. Causes liberated by causes—I don't look at samsara-nirvada two. Dharmas liberated by dharmas—I don't look at terminology words. Mind liberated by mind—I don't look at indicating mind."

Emaho! Self-liberation in five modes!

[7965-7983]
Self-liberated self-pacified vast expanse—from that same source: "Therefore ground-abiding rigpa, self-dawn thus appearance complete. Self-arisen thus ground itself complete. Self-appearance thus objects also complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. Self-liberated thus delusion-ground complete. Self-pure thus all paths complete. Self-knowing thus knowables complete. Self-pervasive thus result complete.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Self-place thus cause-conditions complete. Self-realized thus dharmata complete. Self-reversed thus samsara-nirvana complete. Self-abiding thus tantra-scripture complete. Self-complete thus one-time complete. Self-aware thus instruction complete. Self-placed thus meditation complete. Self-nature thus expanse complete."

[7984-8012]
Thus completed and liberated rigpa itself primordially pure from first, stainless. Heart, thus transmission exhausted. Single great bliss beyond speech-thought-expression. Primordially pure wide-open. Stone-enclosed pure emptiness. Generally appearing samsara-nirvana's fortune unmoved. Dharma-exhausted change-ceased beyond inanimate-animate. Abiding as natural ground-Buddha.

From Pearl Garland: "Emaho! Self-completed Great Perfection dharmakaya—pure from ka, stains exhausted. First arisen, transmission exhausted. Free from duality, beyond calculation. Suffering causeless, great bliss. Expression causeless, beyond speech-thought. Primordially self-aware pure. Exhausted overflow, not stone-enclosed. Exhausted things, abides empty. Both without increase, nature itself. Free from dharmas, beyond method. Unthought clear, change ceased."

Emaho! All completed in self-nature!

[8013-8037]
Those abiding in meaning like sky rigpa—dharma-exhausted, appearance and body water-moon-like, unobstructed by walls and fences, obtain immeasurable eyes and superknowledges. Seeing noble truth, liberated from further existence.

Primordial purity ground liberation—four elements' particles powerless, burned by wisdom fire, like mist dissolving, showing body's miracle in sky. If meaningful, wisdom fire burns particles, blessing as relics and ringsels. If not meaningful, self-dissolves into peace, rigpa abides in dharmakaya expanse, form body with activities, benefiting beings until samsara not empty.

From Copper Letters and Signs Measures: "Appearance four measures not reached, yet stone-enclosed not appearing, primordial ground liberation exists."

Thus meaning clearly explained in khregs chod liberation manner, from Heap of Jewels Tantra: "Untransferred self-place placed mind—all these words too, no one trained, each mind understands appearing. This itself understood by own mind."

[8038-8049]
".Inconceivable unthought, all appearances self-pure, all uncontrived spontaneous, become empty-luminous great rigpa's kind. Earth water fire wind four elements, each power not appearing, like mist dissolve for skilled. Delusion's various graspings, however thought unborn, grasping-grasped parts self-ceased, whatever not appearing self-exhausted. Clear-illuminator self-experienced, embodied all thus gone, disembodied needless to mention."

Emaho! Liberation into the natural state!

[8050-8060]
When yogin's realization reaches measure, particles become partless, body stone-enclosed self-dissolves. Even slightly unreached, if surpassing others—even one srang heavy becomes light—rigpa dissolves into primordial purity.

Key point: from wide-open stone-enclosed pure rigpa nature's familiarization. Mind and its deluded appearance nonexistent, clear appearance aspect at that time self-pure in own face, mind and wisdom distinguished. Mind pure sees wisdom truth, mind bliss.

From Seng Ge Rtsal Rdzogs: "Seeing Buddha truth, Victor's child. Understanding thought, always bliss."

[8061-8082]
From Treasury of Supreme Vehicle: "Again, showing instruction of liberating by excellent realization—nineteenth sequence. Recognition is immediate.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary."

Having definitely established khregs chod meaning, now extensive explanation of thod rgal's key for purifying stone-enclosed into light body has two: how surpassing khregs chod; and explanation of special thod rgal itself.

First: surpassing by seven specialties—appearance light specialty; practice method connection specialty; self-appearance direct seeing specialty; body key channel specialty; appearance-illuminator gate specialty; seeing faculty specialty; experience increase-appearing specialty.

First: khregs chod cannot purify outer deluded appearance's ground stones rocks, making objects, depending on intellectual imputation of illusion groundlessness, depending on mind's consciousness collection dharmas, quickly not liberating.

Thod rgal makes five lights expanse rigpa appearance as object, no need for intellectual imputation of deluded appearance's namelessness, mind's dharma eye consciousness etc. self-ceased, training.

Emaho! Thod rgal's swift path of light!

======================================================================
[02-19-01-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


[Section] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

[Section] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

[Section] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

[Section] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

[Section] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

[Section] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

[Section] Voice 08 (Integrator): The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

[Section] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

[Section] Voice 12 (Ecstatic): Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

[Section] Voice 04 (Consort): The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
