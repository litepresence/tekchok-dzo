[6957-6962]
Listen here, you who cling to views! Longchenpa is showing you the progressive introduction—face-introduce mind to empty, then appearance to mind, then empty to awareness. Each step completes the previous. When you recognize appearance as mind, mind becomes complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. When you recognize mind as empty, happiness spreads through that emptiness. When you recognize empty as awareness—ah! That's dharmakaya itself, non-dual with space.

But watch out! Some hear "awareness itself and space are non-dual" and they attach to the words, grasping at some self-characteristic. They think they've got it conceptually. Don't be like that! This pointing is not the moon itself.

[6963-6972]
This teaching has three aspects you need to understand: intended basis, purpose, and actual logical problems. Why? Because the words "appearance is mind" are provisional—skilful means, not ultimate truth. They don't approach the heart-essence intention of the Nyingthig teachings.

The intended basis: Longchenpa said these words provisionally, to guide those who grasp outer objects as truly existent. From the Self-Arising Tantra: "Sometimes show appearance to mind." See? Sometimes—not always, not ultimately. This appearance-is-mind view is designated only to stop attachment to outer objects. That's the purpose. Nothing more.

[6973-6981]
Now the actual problems with this view—listen carefully! If appearance truly IS mind, then mind would have color and shape, because eyes see colors and shapes! And if appearance, mind, and empty awareness are all mixed together as one substance, then:
- Awareness would be deluded (ridiculous!)
- Appearance couldn't be seen by eyes (but it is!)
- Mind wouldn't be deluded (but ordinary mind IS deluded!)

Three contradictions from treating them as one thing! This distinction was explained before—don't think you can liberate yourself by just doing "appearance is mind" yoga. It's a step, not the destination.

[6982-6994]
From the Self-Arising Tantra, the Buddha himself said: "Appearance-mind yoga—all arise from my mind. If mind itself is realized, what is there to do? All expressing that word—I said not liberated."

Even the scriptures refute this view! If mind doesn't exist, appearance wouldn't exist either—yet it does. When mind ceases, appearance would cease at that same time—yet it doesn't. And appearance exists even when there's no mind—further proof this view has problems.

There are five occasions when mind doesn't exist, explained in the Middle Extremes.

Emaho! Don't get stuck in the provisional—keep moving toward the ultimate!

[6996-7001]
Listen—you want to know when mind doesn't exist? Here are the five occasions: deep sleep without dreams, fainting, and the two types of absorption (entering meditative equipoise), plus the state of being without any conception at all. In all these, where is your "appearance is mind" view then? Mind is gone, yet appearances still exist! This alone refutes that view.

To sum up: believing appearance is mind is great darkness of wrong conception—you must eliminate this!

[7002-7012]
Now the third point—the crucial instruction that appearances are free from assertions and denials through self-liberation in their own place within dharmata: The nature is complete.

The five outer elements don't exist—they're empty, naturally pure like the moon's reflection in water. No need to purify them! Inner mind's memories and thoughts naturally dissolve without trace—no need to destroy them with antidotes! Appearance and mind are spontaneously liberated from the start—no need to add acceptance or rejection! Rigpa is naked and bare—don't clothe it in elaborations!

Just release into great evenness without leaving a trace, and the five gates naturally enter as self-arisen self-liberation.

[7013-7037]
From the Sixth Treasury (Klong Drug Pa)—listen to this! Rest in this understanding.

"The great self-appearance of all sentient beings—no place to search elsewhere. By their own power, self-knowing."

This is Samantabhadra's intention self-arising in the expanse! When you let go into the vast swaying of "khral ma khrol, sang ma seng" (unfabricated, unconstructed), everything becomes the mandala of spontaneously arisen meaning.

From the same text: appearances are all like illusions, dreams, reflections—unthought great image. Whatever arises in one's stream, appearances fall like rain, not remaining in the condition-stream. One obtains irreversible samadhi!

Emaho! When appearances self-liberate as delusion, how could non-delusion not liberate?

[7038-7051]
Listen to this supreme instruction from the Letterless Tantra! The nature is complete.

"All arises from the unborn—deluded appearance is my mind. All abides—deluded appearance is my heart. All appears—deluded appearance is my body. All sounds—deluded appearance is my speech."

Look—seeing doesn't cease, appearing like my form. Hearing doesn't cease, sounding like my voice. Smelling doesn't cease, feeling like my scent. Tasting doesn't cease, spreading like my taste. Touching doesn't cease, moving like my mind. Secret afflictions are my miracles! Buddhas and sentient beings are my cemetery!

"All-doing I am—great self-clear appearance!"

[7052-7059]
But you might ask: if deluded appearance is left in its own place, won't it just become more deluded? The nature is complete.

Listen! Ordinary beings grasp at self, so they're deluded. But yogins know there's no basis, so without fabrication they rest in natural flow—not deluded!

From the Pearl Garland: "Sentient beings in samsara are bound by their own conceptions. Knowing they're natureless, definitely liberated."

[7060-7084]
Delusion and liberation depend on inner knowing, not outer appearance! Outer appearance never did any deluding or liberating. Just leave appearances as they are—that's enough!

Tilopa said: "Appearance doesn't bind—grasping binds. Cut the grasping, Naropa!"

This resting in natural flow of rigpa in self-dawn essence—nothing needs deliberate correction through view, meditation, or conduct. You can't improve the nature (rang bzhin)! Spontaneous self-arisen wisdom cannot become untrue.

From Rtsal Rdzogs: "By thinking, wisdom's meaning isn't found. If wisdom's meaning found by thinking, self-arisen wisdom becomes false."

Recognizing appearance and awareness as dharmata, whatever you do in conduct doesn't transcend dharmata!

Emaho! All activity becomes the path when resting in natural flow!

[7085-7104]
However appearances appear, they dawn as unceasing display—naturally arisen meaning's mandala! Eating and drinking become dharmata's approach. Sleeping and sitting become bodhi's practice. Activities become deity's abiding meditation. Stretching and bending become mandala practice. The three thousand worlds become spontaneously accomplished mandala.

Look at this!
- Rain falling by itself—splashing, sprinkling
- Roads and paths—the great natural line
- Footprints—colored sand of the mandala
- Movements—nature of mudra
- Speech—vajra recitation
- Thoughts—creation stage wheels
- Whatever appears—deity's display
- Your own body—the empowerment vase
- Descent—the continuous samaya
- Clear knowing—self-dawn instruction

Birth and death become dharmata's familiarity. The six collections' object-appearances self-arise as realization!

[7105-7149]
From the Pearl Garland—marvel at this! The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

"Emaho! If appearances thus deluded also self-liberate, how could non-deluded not liberate? Whatever speech and activities—conduct of empty-aware-clear. Good and bad thoughts—meditation of river's great depths. Wrong view and right desire—yogin's view without distinction. All hope and doubt holding—uncontrived spontaneous result."

The Great Seal—by eating and drinking, approach. By sleeping and sitting, practice. Activities are deity abiding. Stretching and bending are mandala practice. The three thousand worlds are all mandalas where rain and steam sprinkle down.

Paths seen by beings are the great line. Footprints are colored sand dust. Those wanting to walk—posture itself! Moving limbs are mudra. However spoken—mantra words. Thoughts are creation stage. Mind movements are offerings. Form-appearances are deity body. Great sound speech is music. Your own body is the vase. Hair is the year's leaves, ornaments beautiful. Blood and water-essence waters are entrusted with essence substances. Self-appearing empowerments are given—perfect in un-transferred! Those wanting to transcend—samaya itself. Those wanting to protect—binding itself. Those wanting liberation—deviation! Those wanting non-existence—Supreme Sage!

All views are mudra's scope. Attachment to them is deviation experience. Clear knowing awareness is the instruction. Object and mind as two—field for that. Birth, aging, sickness, death—familiarity key. Six collections unceasing—realization!

[7150]
Thus whatever the yogin does, generating in dharmata's nature—the deity mandala with empowerment completion and instruction. Recognition is immediate.

[7151-7162]
Completion—dharmata's mandala, natural flow, river continuum samadhi without break! Without effort, without depending on cause and effect, wondrous great accomplishments are spontaneously obtained. This is the great mandala of supreme ground!

From the Tal 'Gyur:
"Thus all is dharmata—nothing to accept, nothing to place, nothing's dharmata. Whatever appears, from its own dharmata, there's no fabricated dharmata elsewhere. However done, unthought arises. Without abandoning or accepting—self-appearance!"

[7163-7178]
From Self-Arising:
"Don't attach to appearance. Don't establish non-existence. Don't abandon existence. Don't hope for non-existence.

Don't apprehend existence. Don't establish what is done. Don't cease what arises.

Don't view arising as fault. Don't abandon afflictions. Don't establish Buddhas. Don't meditate meditation. Don't view view. Don't cease deluded appearance. Don't seek pure appearance."

[7179-7182]
From Nor Bu 'Phrul Bkod: "When knowing that cognizes objects appears to objects, appearance is self-appearance. At that time, let awareness release into openness."

[7183-7194]
The third meaning—all transcended from the start in the great expanse of spontaneous evenness. Without bondage or liberation, without abandoning or accepting—in the great nameless samsara-nirvana.

These are the twelve great vajra laughs of the great perfection, pointing to the greatness of the crucial key:

Great perfection of nature, great nameless samsara-nirvana, great transcendence of cause and effect, great already-complete without doing, great self-liberation without abandoning or accepting, great effortless dynamic display.

From the Great Heap of Jewels Tantra:
"Kye! Vajra heart-essence of all Buddhas' speech."

Emaho! The twelve great laughs burst forth from the natural state!
