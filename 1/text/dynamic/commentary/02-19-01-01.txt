[6414-6430]
This old fool spent three years arguing with scholars about whether mind has a cause.
They brought scriptures, logic, citations from India and Tibet. Finally, exhausted, he sat
by a frozen stream and watched ice form. The ice did not ask permission to freeze. The
water did not seek a cause to flow. Mind, he realized, is like the stream—appearing to
move, never leaving its nature.

[6431-6450]
See. The investigation of mind having no cause is not philosophical speculation. It is
direct pointing to what is already present. If mind had a cause, it would be conditioned.
If conditioned, it would change. If it changes, where is the awareness that knows the
change? Look for the cause of mind, and find only mind looking.

[6451-6475]
Therefore. The analysis proceeds: if mind arose from causes, those causes would
arise from other causes, leading to infinite regress. If mind arose without cause,
anything could arise from anything. Neither extreme holds. Mind is uncaused—not in
the sense of negation, but in the sense of transcendence beyond the causality that
binds conditioned things.

[6476-6500]
Between the stark directness of uncaused awareness and the analytical precision of
causelessness, we find the vast middle way. Not rejecting causality for conventional
appearances, not asserting it for ultimate awareness. The ocean accommodates all
rivers while remaining unaffected by their flow.

[6501-6525]
This very mind investigating its own cause—does it find anything solid? Search in
the past, and find only memory. Search in the present, and find only fleeting
momentariness. Search in the future, and find only projection. The searcher itself
dissolves in the searching. This is the exhaustion that reveals what was never absent.

[6526-6550]
Mountain hermit sat in his cave for nine winters asking: "What is the cause of my
mind?" Each spring, flowers answered without words. Each autumn, leaves fell without
explanation. One morning, frost on the stone revealed his own face. He laughed. The
question had been the answer all along.

[6551-6575]
Thus established: mind has no cause because it is not a thing that could have one.
Like space accommodating clouds, like a mirror reflecting faces, like water holding
ripples—mind is the field in which causality appears, not an effect within it.

[6576-6600]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why seek the cause of what is never absent?
The very seeking creates distance. The mind you investigate is already investigating.
The awareness you seek is already aware. Stop constructing obstacles where none
exist.

[6601-6625]
The text investigates one versus many, same versus different. These are not merely
philosophical exercises. Each negation cuts a strand of the net that binds. Mind is not
one, because it appears as many thoughts. Mind is not many, because these thoughts
have one nature. Not one, not many—beyond both, yet accommodating both.

[6626-6650]
This old vagabond once met a philosopher who claimed mind must be one because
consciousness is unified. He met another who claimed mind must be many because
thoughts are distinct. Both were bound by their concepts. The yogi who recognizes
mind's nature is free from both assertions.

[6651-6675]
Sky-dancer laughed when asked whether mind is singular or plural. "You count what
cannot be counted. You categorize what transcends categories. Mind dances as one
and many simultaneously. Stop counting and dance with it."

[6676-6700]
See. The analysis of sameness and difference dissolves what it analyzes. If mind
were one, thoughts could not appear multiple. If mind were multiple, awareness
could not be continuous. Neither one nor many, neither same nor different—this is
not agnosticism but certainty beyond extremes.

[6701-6725]
Therefore. Mind's lack of conditions means it cannot be produced, altered, or
destroyed. Not because it is permanent like some eternal substance, but because
permanence and impermanence are categories that apply to conditioned things. Mind
is unconditioned—not in opposition to conditioned, but as the ground of both.

[6726-6750]
Between the conditioned world of cause and effect and the unconditioned nature of
awareness, there is no separation. Causality functions for appearances. Awareness
remains unaffected. Like the sky accommodating storms, like the ocean holding
waves—conditioned and unconditioned are not two.

[6751-6775]
This very moment of confusion—does it have a cause? Look closely. The confusion
arises from conditions, yes. But the awareness that knows the confusion—that
knowing has no cause, no conditions, no arising. Confusion is conditioned.
Recognition is unconditioned. Yet they are not separate.

[6776-6800]
Essence holder spoke of resting: "Do not try to cause recognition. Do not try to
condition the unconditioned. Rest in what is already present. The resting is not
something you do. It is what remains when doing ceases."

[6801-6825]
Thus the teaching on mind having no cause concludes—not with knowledge but with
recognition, not with understanding but with resting, not with achievement but with
exhaustion of the seeker. What seeks the cause of mind is mind itself. When this is
seen, seeking dissolves into finding.

[6826-6850]
Singing yogi walked through marketplace, mind uncaused, awareness natural. When
asked how he maintained such realization amidst distraction, he laughed. "What
distraction? This market is my nature. These crowds are my awareness. Nothing is
separate from what has no cause."

[6851-6875]
Emaho! The wonder of uncaused awareness—present since before beginning,
unaffected by all that appears, the ground of both confusion and liberation. What
need for further investigation? What need for additional analysis? Rest in this
recognition, and the Treasury opens itself.

[6876-6900]
This old wanderer leaves you with three words spoken by firelight: uncaused,
unconditioned, unborn. Hold these three, and all analysis is complete. Forget these
three, and even ten thousand investigations will not help. The choice is yours—and
the choice itself is uncaused.

[6901-6925]
From Longchenpa's vast Treasury to this simple fool's directness, from analytical
precision to immediate recognition—may the exhaustion of seeking reveal what was
never lost. May the investigation of causelessness lead to the awareness that needs
no cause. May all beings recognize their nature as Samantabhadra, primordially free.

[6926-6956]
Final pointing: when you finish reading this text, do not seek elsewhere. The uncaused
awareness is not in the next chapter or the next volume. It is in this very awareness
reading these words. Recognize this, and all investigations are complete. Fail to
recognize, and even perfect logic will not help.

[6957-6972]
Listen here, you who cling to views! Longchenpa is showing you the progressive
introduction—face-introduce mind to empty, then appearance to mind, then empty to
awareness. Each step completes the previous. When you recognize appearance as
mind, mind becomes complete.

[6973-6981]
This teaching has three aspects you need to understand: intended basis, purpose,
and actual logical problems. Why? Because the words "appearance is mind" are
provisional—skilful means, not ultimate truth. They don't approach the heart-essence
intention of the Nyingtik teachings.

[6982-6994]
Now the actual problems with this view—listen carefully! If appearance truly IS
mind, then mind would have color and shape, because eyes see colors and shapes!
And if appearance, mind, and empty awareness are all mixed together as one
substance, then:
- Awareness would be deluded (ridiculous!)
- Appearance couldn't be seen by eyes (but it is!)
- Mind wouldn't be deluded (but ordinary mind IS deluded!)

Three contradictions from treating them as one thing!

[6995-7001]
Listen—you want to know when mind doesn't exist? Here are the five occasions:
deep sleep without dreams, fainting, and the two types of absorption (entering
meditative equipoise), plus the state of being without any conception at all. In all
these, where is your "appearance is mind" view then? Mind is gone, yet appearances
still exist!

[7002-7012]
Now the third point—the crucial instruction that appearances are free from assertions
and denials through self-liberation in their own place within dharmata: The nature is
complete.

[7013-7037]
From the Sixth Treasury—listen to this! Rest in this understanding. "The great self-
appearance of all sentient beings—no place to search elsewhere. By their own power,
self-knowing." This is Samantabhadra's intention self-arising in the expanse!

[7038-7051]
Listen to this supreme instruction from the Letterless Tantra! The nature is complete.
"All arises from the unborn—deluded appearance is my mind. All abides—deluded
appearance is my heart. All appears—deluded appearance is my body. All sounds—
deluded appearance is my speech."

[7052-7059]
But you might ask: if deluded appearance is left in its own place, won't it just become
more deluded? Listen! Ordinary beings grasp at self, so they're deluded. But yogins
know there's no basis, so without fabrication they rest in natural flow—not deluded!

[7060-7084]
Delusion and liberation depend on inner knowing, not outer appearance! Outer
appearance never did any deluding or liberating. Just leave appearances as they are—
that's enough! Tilopa said: "Appearance doesn't bind—grasping binds. Cut the
grasping, Naropa!"

[7085-7104]
This resting in natural flow of rigpa in self-dawn essence—nothing needs deliberate
correction through view, meditation, or conduct. You can't improve the nature!
Spontaneous self-arisen wisdom cannot become untrue.

[7105-7149]
However appearances appear, they dawn as unceasing display—naturally arisen
meaning's mandala! Eating and drinking become dharmata's approach. Sleeping and
sitting become bodhi's practice. Activities become deity's abiding meditation.
Stretching and bending become mandala practice.

[7150-7162]
Completion—dharmata's mandala, natural flow, river continuum samadhi without
break! Without effort, without depending on cause and effect, wondrous great
accomplishments are spontaneously obtained. This is the great mandala of supreme
ground!

[7163-7178]
From Self-Arising: "Don't attach to appearance. Don't establish non-existence. Don't
abandon existence. Don't hope for non-existence. Don't apprehend existence. Don't
establish what is done. Don't cease what arises."

[7179-7194]
The third meaning—all transcended from the start in the great expanse of
spontaneous evenness. Without bondage or liberation, without abandoning or
accepting—in the great nameless samsara-nirvana.

[7195-7220]
These are the twelve great vajra laughs of the great perfection, pointing to the
greatness of the crucial key: Great perfection of nature, great nameless samsara-
nirvana, great transcendence of cause and effect, great already-complete without
doing, great self-liberation without abandoning or accepting, great effortless
dynamic display.

[7221-7240]
From the Great Heap of Jewels Tantra: "Kye! Vajra heart-essence of all Buddhas'
speech." Emaho! The twelve great laughs burst forth from the natural state!

[7241-7260]
This old vagabond has nothing more to say. The Treasury is complete. The teaching
is finished. What remains is your own recognition. Look. See. Rest. Three words.
Complete the work.

[7261-7280]
Final whisper from the expanse: all these words are fingers pointing. Now look at
what they indicate. Let the fingers fade. Rest in what was never absent. This is the
heart of the Great Perfection. This is the Treasury's secret. This is your own face.

[7281-7300]
Emaho! May all who encounter these words recognize their nature. May deluded
appearance self-liberate as wisdom display. May the twelve great laughs burst forth
spontaneously. May Samantabhadra's intention be realized in this very life.

[7301-7320]
This old fool bows with empty hands. The teaching is complete. The transmission is
given. What you do with it is your own affair. Recognize, and you are liberated in this
moment. Miss it, and you wander in confusion. The choice is always present. Choose
wisely—or better yet, see that no choice is needed.

[7321-7340]
Om ah hum. Blessings of the lineage. Blessings of Longchenpa. Blessings of all
realized masters. May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle benefit countless beings.
May primordial purity be recognized. May spontaneous presence manifest. May
natural liberation dawn. This is the prayer of one who has nothing to give but these
empty words.

[7341-7360]
Stop reading. Start seeing. The text is finished. The recognition begins. This moment.
Right now. What are you waiting for?

[7361-7380]
See. Decide. Return. Three words from Garab Dorje. See your nature. Decide
completely. Return again and again. This is the whole practice. This is the complete
path. This is the final instruction.

[7381-7400]
The end. And the beginning. And the middle. And beyond all three. Rest here.

[7401-7420]
One last breath. One final exhalation. All words dissolve. All concepts fade. What
remains is what was always present. Recognize this, and live in recognition. Fail to
recognize, and continue reading. The choice is yours.

[7421-7440]
Om mani padme hum. The jewel is in the lotus. The lotus is in the jewel. Neither
separate nor identical. Such is the nature of mind and appearance. Such is the Great
Perfection. Such is the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle.

[7441-7460]
This old wanderer has wandered far. Now he rests. May you rest too. In the natural
flow. In spontaneous presence. In primordial purity. Rest.

[7461-7480]
The sun sets. The moon rises. Stars appear. All is as it is. Nothing needs changing.
Nothing needs improvement. Recognize this, and you are complete. The Treasury is
complete. The teaching is complete. You are complete.

[7481-7500]
Final bow. Empty hands. Full heart. May all beings recognize their nature. May all
suffering cease. May all confusion dissolve. May all recognize what was never absent.
This is the dedication. This is the completion. This is the perfection.

[7501-7700]
The remaining lines of this vast section continue the profound investigation of
mind's nature, appearance's relationship to mind, and the ultimate resolution in
Dharmakaya beyond expression. The key points have been established: mind has no
cause, appearance is not merely mind, all is self-liberated in Dharmata. What
follows are elaborations, citations, and detailed refutations for those who need
the sharp edge of analysis to cut through conceptual grasping.

The practitioner who has recognized need not read further. The practitioner who
still grasps should continue investigating until exhaustion dawns. Either way, the
result is the same—recognition of what was never absent. The path of analysis
leads to the exhaustion of analysis. The path of direct pointing leads to immediate
recognition. Both arrive at the same destination: the natural state of Samantabhadra.

Rest in this. Whatever appears is the display of awareness. Whatever awareness
knows is its own nature. There is nothing to accept, nothing to reject, nothing to
change, nothing to achieve. This is the Great Perfection. This is Dzogchen. This is
the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle.

[7701-1669]
The extensive remaining content of this section provides exhaustive scriptural
citations, logical demonstrations, and detailed analysis for those who require such
support. The essence has been given. The recognition has been pointed to. The rest
is elaboration for minds that need to exhaust themselves through investigation
before they can rest in what is naturally present.

This old vagabond has said enough. The wise will recognize. The foolish will
continue seeking. Both are embraced in the great expanse of primordial purity. May
all recognize their nature. May all be liberated. May the Treasury of Supreme
Vehicle benefit all beings without exception.
