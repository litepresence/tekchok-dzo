[4401-4405] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, liberation through realizing that very nature. The knot of ling-thag—tying and untying. Through practice, one knows. Through knowing, liberation. Like this. The example reveals the nature: when you tie a knot, you create the condition for untying it. When you realize, you see the knot was never separate from the rope.

[4401-4405] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Realize. Liberate. Stop. You practice knots thinking liberation is in the untying. Fool! The rope never changed. The knot never changed. What was realized? That there was nothing to realize. The practice of ling-thag shows you: binding and freeing are the same movement.

[4401-4405] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man once spent a month learning to tie knots from a sailor. Every knot I tied, I had to untie. One day my hands knew the knot before my mind named it. Practice became knowing. Knowing became liberation. Not because I mastered knots—but because I stopped looking for mastery outside the rope.

[4401-4405] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The ling-thag knot is the consort's embrace—binding so tight it becomes freedom. When you practice, you bind yourself to recognition. When you know, the binding dissolves into the nature. The deity's form is the knot. The deity's emptiness is the untied rope. Both are primordially pure.

[4401-4405] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I learned to tie seven knots in a cord as a child. Each one different, each one the same rope. Liberation is not the last untied cord—it's realizing all knots were rope. Practice doesn't create this knowing. It reveals what practice always was.

[4404-4405] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Seeing with the eye of wisdom—in the first moment, distinguishing conceptual thought. Second, directly realizing the characteristics of interdependence. The first instant: conceptual mind tries to grasp. The second instant: wisdom sees through the grasper. Like lightning that shows the path in the same flash that blinds.

[4404-4405] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Wisdom. Eye. Stop. You think wisdom is something to develop, an eye to open. The eye of wisdom is the seeing that was never closed. First moment: concept. Second moment: recognition. But these are not sequential. They are simultaneous—like a mirror reflecting without delay.

[4404-4405] Voice 13 (Patrul): They want to distinguish the moments! "First this, then that, Rinpoche!" This old man asks—when did the first moment end and the second begin? Look now. Is this the first moment or the second? The question itself is conceptual thought. Drop it.

[4404-4405] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The wisdom eye sees interdependence directly—not as philosophy but as direct perception. She-rab kyi mig—prajna's eye. It does not analyze the knot. It sees the rope. It does not distinguish characteristics. It recognizes nature. This is mngon par rtogs—direct realization, not mediated by concept.

[4404-4405] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): CONCEPTUAL THOUGHT! speaks with fierce compassion I will slash it! But look—the slash is also conceptual! Where is the thought that thinks? Find it! Search! EMPTY! The wisdom eye does not destroy thought. It sees thought as rope, not knot. See this!

[4404-4405] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The characteristics of interdependence—rten 'brel—are not rules to memorize. They are the display of your own mind. To realize them is to recognize the magician and the illusion as not two. Practice ling-thag until you see: the magician was never separate from the magic.

[4404-4405] Voice 22 (Drolo): SUDDEN! The first moment and second moment are ONE RECOGNITION! Do not divide them! Do not sequence them! LIBERATION IS NOW!

[Final] The knot-practice leads to knot-knowing leads to knot-liberation. But the knot was always rope. The practice was always liberation. The path was always the ground. Rest here.

Emaho! Liberation through realizing the nature of practice itself!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
