Second: liberation through realization of Suchness itself. Just as weaver's knot releases through knowing method, liberation through knowing. Eye of wisdom sees—first instant words severed. Second, subtle channels directly realized.

Know the knot to unbind it. The rope of binding and freeing is the same. Liberation is knowing, not breaking free. First—words cease. Then channels realize.

Three pith instructions: Recognition of the nature. Resting in that nature. Returning to that nature.

[Final] Liberation through knowing. See with wisdom. The knot was never real.

Emaho!
