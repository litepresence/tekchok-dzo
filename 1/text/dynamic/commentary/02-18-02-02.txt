[4401-4405] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second: liberation through realization of Suchness itself. Just as weaver's knot releases through knowing method, liberation through knowing. Eye of wisdom sees—first instant words severed. Second, subtle channels directly realized.

[4401-4405] Voice 13 (Patrul): Know the knot to unbind it. The rope of binding and freeing is the same. Liberation is knowing, not breaking free. First—words cease. Then channels realize.

[4401-4405] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Realize. Liberate. See.

[Final] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Liberation through knowing. See with wisdom. The knot was never real.

Emaho!
