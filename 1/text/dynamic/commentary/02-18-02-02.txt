Second: liberation through realization of Suchness itself. De nyid rtogs
nas grol ba—freedom through recognizing that itself. Like weaver's knot
(lding 'thag gi mdud pa)—know the method to release. Knowing liberates,
not breaking free.

This wanderer once sought liberation as escape. Climbed mountains, crossed
rivers, thought freedom was elsewhere. Then recognized: the binding and
the liberating are the same rope. Knot known is knot released.

Shes rab kyi mig gis mthong na—when eye of wisdom sees. Skad cig dang

discrimination severed. Gnyis pa la lu gu rgyud kyi mtshan nyid mngon

[1-5]
Realization dawns. Liberation immediate. Seeing complete. Three words,
but really one: Knowing.

[1-5]
First instant: words severed. Not gradually silenced but immediately seen
through. Like cutting a rope—no partial cutting. Second instant: subtle
channels (lu gu rgyud) realized directly. Not through analysis but through
recognition.

[1-5]
The knot was never real. Binding and liberation—both conceptual imputations.
When wisdom eye sees, where is the knot? Where is the one bound? Emaho!
Liberation through knowing that itself.
