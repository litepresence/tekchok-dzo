[8725-8733] Third: Mixing with mind, one becomes self-natured as mind. Merging with the body relies upon the yantra of the body. Speech is three syllables. Mind is the extending and gathering of the wind. Thus, having transferred that, taking it with a mirror at the end, with the ring-thumb it should fall into the student's mouth—this makes absolute and relative inseparable. The student must drink at the mouth, not dying, must take with the tongue.

[8725-8733] Third mixing—with the body, the yantra of body. With speech, three syllables. With mind, the extending and gathering of wind. The guru transfers the essence to the student. The mirror reflects. The ring-thumb places the bindu in the mouth. This is the secret union of absolute and relative. The student drinks the teaching. Not dying to the world, but being reborn in the dharma.

[8734-8739] Fifteenth: Thus, having transferred, holding the measure of experience of great bliss free of grasped objects arising in the student. Furthermore, pressing the two branches of the Rigveda channel, experience arises free of identifying the birthless; whatever is spoken is not known—like the experience of a mute's dream.

[8734-8739] Three words. Transfer. Press. Drink. The guru transfers the great bliss. The channels are pressed. The experience arises free of grasping. Like a mute dreaming—something is experienced but cannot be spoken. This is the secret transmission beyond words.

[8740-8750] Sixteenth: The key of dependent origination for not seeing that Mudra. The right eye of a black dog, the left eye of a black jackal, the right of an owl, the left of a bat. Consequently, the right wing-tip of a crow—well joined, wrapped in a golden pill and placed in the Mudra's mouth. Holding the Damaru and so forth in the hand, that itself sees while the body is not seen. If the Mudra is seen, Siddhi is not; therefore rely on non-seeing.

[8740-8750] The Mudra is secret—not to be seen with ordinary eyes. The eyes of dogs, jackals, owls, bats—the right and left of each. The wing-tip of a crow wrapped in gold, placed in the Mudra's mouth. The Damaru in hand. Seeing without being seen. Siddhi comes to those who do not see the means.

[8751-8753] Seventeenth: If it is not the time of Empowerment, or if bliss is not relied upon elsewhere, sending to one's own land and so forth by giving gifts—having pleased with articles of gold and so forth, one must go to one's own place. By these, the third Empowerment's difficult points are explained—this is the meaning of the very great secret.

[8751-8753] Sometimes empowerment is not the time. Sometimes bliss is not available elsewhere. Then send the student home with gifts—gold and precious things. They go to their own place. The secret empowerment is complete. The difficult points are explained.

[8754-8767] Second meaning: the arrangement of the unelaborate Mandala Empowerment: bestowing Empowerment by relying upon the Mandala and Vase with the syllable wheel and verses. This is the unelaborate secret Empowerment: introducing through the bliss of pressing the pure letter of speech's basis and the channel. This has four: outer, inner, secret, and perfect. The unelaborate outer: purifying through the letters of the Three Kayas of body, speech, and mind. The inner: all Dharmas are unborn and so forth—the basis of the Vase is definite. Thus, the secret: whatever things are natureless and so forth—appearing as liberated, indicating the absence of borders. The perfect: all Dharmas are empty and selfless and so forth—the precious Empowerment of words to recite for special understanding.

[8754-8767] Four aspects of the unelaborate empowerment. Outer—purifying through the letters of the Three Kayas. Inner—all Dharmas are unborn, the Vase is definite. Secret—things are natureless, appearing as liberated, no borders. Perfect—empty and selfless, the precious empowerment of words. These four are one empowerment seen from four sides.

[8768-8769] Third: The very unelaborate Empowerment: bestowing Empowerment introducing the nature of primordial purity, self-knowing awareness empty like space, through the symbolic Empowerment dividing the border of Samsara and Nirvana. This also has four from outer, inner, secret, and perfect.

[8768-8769] Three words. Primordial. Purity. Space. The very unelaborate empowerment introduces primordial purity—self-knowing awareness empty like space. The symbolic empowerment divides the border of samsara and nirvana. There is no border to cross. The division is the recognition.

[Final] The third mixing: body, speech, mind. The transfer complete. The bindu placed. The mouth drinks. The empowerment given. The secret sealed. The student becomes the teacher. The vase fills. The mandala turns. The syllables sound. The empowerment is complete.

Emaho! The third empowerment! The secret mixing! The unelaborate teaching!

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known. The treasury is complete.
