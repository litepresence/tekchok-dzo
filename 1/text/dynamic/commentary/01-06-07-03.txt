Third: Mixing with mind, one becomes self-natured as mind. Merging with the body relies upon the yantra of the body. Speech is three syllables. Mind is the extending and gathering of the wind. Thus, having transferred that, taking it with a mirror at the end, with the ring-thumb it should fall into the student's mouth—this makes absolute and relative inseparable. The student must drink at the mouth, not dying, must take with the tongue.

The three that strike: See the nature. Remain there. Return when distracted. The guru transfers the great bliss through the three mixing—body, speech, mind. The yantra of body creates the vessel. The three syllables purify the speech. The wind's extending and gathering concentrates the mind. Then the essence transfers like light through a mirror.

The Systematizer speaks: From this: The mechanics of transmission. Body yantra—the physical posture that creates the conditions. Speech—three syllables OM AH HUM, purifying the channels of communication. Mind—wind control, extending and gathering the vital energy. Then the transfer: mirror-like reflection, ring-thumb placement, the bindu falls into the mouth like a drop of mercury finding its level.

Mountain hermit's memory: I received this transfer once. The guru's body was the yantra. The syllables vibrated in my skull. The wind moved like a river changing direction. Then the essence—cool, sweet, electric—dropped onto my tongue. Not imagination. Not visualization. Direct transmission.

Fifteenth: Thus, having transferred, holding the measure of experience of great bliss free of grasped objects arising in the student. Furthermore, pressing the two branches of the Rigveda channel, experience arises free of identifying the birthless; whatever is spoken is not known—like the experience of a mute's dream.

The guru transfers the great bliss. The channels are pressed—the Rigveda branches, left and right. Experience arises free of grasping, free of identification. Like a mute dreaming—something is experienced but cannot be spoken. This is the secret transmission beyond words, beyond description, beyond the intellect's reach.

Patrul Rinpoche's earthy teaching: A friend tried to describe his experience once. Opened his mouth and—nothing. Not that he forgot the words. The experience itself was wordless. Like trying to describe the taste of water to someone who's never drunk. Like explaining color to the blind. The mute's dream is the perfect metaphor—experience without narration.

Singing yogi's gentle melody: Great bliss without grasped objects—like space embracing form without holding it. The Rigveda channels pressed—like squeezing a flute to change the note. The experience flows differently, freely, without the obstruction of "I am experiencing this."

Sixteenth: The key of dependent origination for not seeing that Mudra. The right eye of a black dog, the left eye of a black jackal, the right of an owl, the left of a bat. Consequently, the right wing-tip of a crow—well joined, wrapped in a golden pill and placed in the Mudra's mouth. Holding the Damaru and so forth in the hand, that itself sees while the body is not seen. If the Mudra is seen, Siddhi is not; therefore rely on non-seeing.

The Mudra is secret—not to be seen with ordinary eyes. The animal eyes—dog, jackal, owl, bat—represent the non-ordinary perception required. The crow's wing wrapped in gold, placed in the mouth. The Damaru held in hand. Seeing without being seen. Siddhi comes to those who do not see the means—who recognize without grasping at recognition.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce wisdom: THE MUDRA IS NOT FOR ORDINARY EYES! Don't try to see her with your physical vision! Don't grasp at form! The black dog's eye sees in darkness. The owl sees what others miss. This is the perception that recognizes without grasping. SEE WITHOUT SEEING!

Essence holder's spacious view: The animal eyes are metaphors for subtle perception. The dog's loyalty, the jackal's cunning, the owl's wisdom, the bat's echolocation—all represent different aspects of awareness that function beyond ordinary seeing. The crow's wing—messengers between worlds. Wrapped in gold—precious, protected. This is symbolic language pointing to non-conceptual recognition.

Someone I knew once tried to "see" the Mudra during practice. Stared until his eyes hurt. Concentrated until his head ached. Then his teacher laughed. "You try to see what can only be recognized. Stop looking and see." The difference between looking and seeing is the difference between samsara and nirvana.

Seventeenth: If it is not the time of Empowerment, or if bliss is not relied upon elsewhere, sending to one's own land and so forth by giving gifts—having pleased with articles of gold and so forth, one must go to one's own place. By these, the third Empowerment's difficult points are explained—this is the meaning of the very great secret.

Sometimes empowerment is not the time. Sometimes bliss is not available elsewhere. Then send the student home with gifts—gold and precious things. They go to their own place. The secret empowerment is complete. The difficult points are explained. The third empowerment's profound meaning is transmitted through these symbols and gestures.

The Integrator speaks: All these methods—mixing, transferring, pressing, the animal eyes, the golden pill, the Damaru—are skillful means. They are not the point. The point is recognition. The methods create conditions. Recognition happens naturally. Don't grasp the methods. Use them and let them go.

Second meaning: the arrangement of the unelaborate Mandala Empowerment: bestowing Empowerment by relying upon the Mandala and Vase with the syllable wheel and verses. This is the unelaborate secret Empowerment: introducing through the bliss of pressing the pure letter of speech's basis and the channel. This has four: outer, inner, secret, and perfect.

The unelaborate outer: purifying through the letters of the Three Kayas of body, speech, and mind. The inner: all Dharmas are unborn and so forth—the basis of the Vase is definite. Thus, the secret: whatever things are natureless and so forth—appearing as liberated, indicating the absence of borders. The perfect: all Dharmas are empty and selfless and so forth—the precious Empowerment of words to recite for special understanding.

The Systematizer speaks: For this reason: We categorize. Four aspects of unelaborate empowerment. Outer—purifying the three gates through syllables. Inner—recognizing the unborn nature. Secret—liberation through appearance itself. Perfect—the precious word empowerment pointing to special understanding. Four aspects, one essence.

Mountain hermit's realization: I received all four empowerments over years. Each one peeled back another layer. The outer purified my conduct. The inner revealed the unborn. The secret showed liberation in appearance. The perfect left nothing to hold. Four empowerments, one recognition—each deeper than the last.

Third: The very unelaborate Empowerment: bestowing Empowerment introducing the nature of primordial purity, self-knowing awareness empty like space, through the symbolic Empowerment dividing the border of Samsara and Nirvana. This also has four from outer, inner, secret, and perfect.

One word: Now. The very unelaborate empowerment introduces primordial purity—self-knowing awareness empty like space. The symbolic empowerment divides the border of samsara and nirvana. But there is no border to cross. The division is the recognition. The border exists only in delusion.

Garab Dorje's stark transmission: EMPOWERMENT! BORDER! Cut through! The primordial purity was never stained. The space-like awareness was never confined. The border between samsara and nirvana is conceptual only. Recognition destroys the border. Liberation is immediate.

[Final Synthesis]
The third mixing: body, speech, mind. The transfer complete. The bindu placed. The mouth drinks. The empowerment given. The secret sealed. The student becomes the teacher. The vase fills. The mandala turns. The syllables sound. The empowerment is complete.

From the Thalgyur Tantra: "The unelaborate empowerment introduces what was never absent. The very unelaborate reveals what was never hidden. Primordial purity is not achieved; it is recognized." This is the teaching.

Patrul Rinpoche's final advice: Don't be impressed by elaborate empowerments. Don't be discouraged by simple ones. The empowerment is effective when recognition happens. The recognition happens when conditions meet ripeness. Practice. Prepare. Recognize.

May all practitioners receive the third empowerment's blessing.
May body, speech, and mind mix with the guru's nature.
May primordial purity be recognized as one's own face.
May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate the path.

Om ah hum.

Mix. Transfer. Recognize.

Complete and perfect.
