[13701-13720]
dissolving, these too experts distinguish separately. Earth's cities, if monk's staff broken—nine days likewise die.

Sumeru mountain peak

[13703-13704]
. This is how you attain liberation in the ground (gzhi) of original purity.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The text quotes the Union of Sun and Moon [13707]: "The person's clear light dissolves into union." All appearances self-arise as the display of the kayas, neither large nor small, equal in all aspects, adorned with ornaments, colors, postures, thrones, and mudras

[13710-13716]
. Each group of five is pervaded by pairs of five, with light mandalas—the father's aspect holding the lineages, the mother's aspect, the male and female bodhisattvas—all complete in one.

Emaho!

[13721-13740]
, unchanging sun set—three days also die. Rituals completely abandoned, investigate self-awareness essence meaning.

Sumeru's inside

[13727-13754]
Now the text explains how rigpa enters into the light. You rest naturally in non-conceptual meditation [13727], and all appearances become radiant and clear. From the heart's light rays, countless subtle spheres (thigles) arise [13730]. Then from your heart center, light rays thin as a horse's tail appear, coiled like thread, and you perceive all these deities dissolving into your own body

[13731-13732]
. This is called "awareness entering back into light" [13733].

ROAR! Treasury complete! Never closed! Cut through seeking! NOW!

Listen well! At this time, practitioners must remember the supreme method—like a mother embracing her child [13734].

The third topic concerns the appearances of the four wisdoms preparation dissolving into union wisdom. There are two aspects: how the appearances arise, and how to remember the essential instructions

[13735-13736]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

From the heart, about four finger-widths above, appears a subtle light of four colors—blue, white, yellow, and red—intertwined like a thin thread, thin as a horse's tail, shooting up into the sky

[13737-13738]
. With the eye of wisdom you gaze at it, and from that subtle appearance it expands greatly, becoming distinct and separate—a blue cloth large or small, within the range of your sense faculty, not mixed with other colors, appearing before you The nature is complete.

After centuries of concealment: the treasure was never hidden. Rediscovery reveals what was always present.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[13741-13760]
, dakini's sound broken—thirteen or five. From wish-fulfilling tree, death-lord demons rising—seven days certainly not deceived; not beneficial—emptiness habituation crucial.

Emaho!

[13742-13743]
. This is the appearance of dharmadhatu wisdom [13744].

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Emaho!

[13755-13784]
My devoted ones, understand that this dharmadhatu wisdom has two aspects: the objects of knowledge with their specific and general characteristics, and the experienced phenomena that appear directly Rest in this understanding.

No process needed. No gradual opening. Immediate access to what was always present.

[13755-13756]
. The dharmadhatu itself has outer and inner aspects—the outer is the empty sky with no substantial existence, while the inner is the pure lamp of awareness manifesting directly The nature is complete.

[13757-13758]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

ROAR! The distinction-maker! Cut through! NOW! Liberation is immediate! AH!

Wisdom here means recognizing what has always been present, the characteristics becoming certain at that very moment

[13759-13760]
. This wisdom holds without abandoning the characteristics of color, form, and the individual dharmata of each thing.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Then upon that, without touching or mixing, appears the white cloth of mirror-like wisdom, clear like a mirror's surface, equal to the scope of your senses, distinct from others

[13761-13800]
: if limb and nail luster gone—nine months certain; person's eye film dissolving—five months likewise; death-lord Yama self-risen—twenty-one days death; nothing helps. If foot's sole protrudes outward—one month likewise.

If examining other's body

[13764-13765]
. Upon this are clear thigles with five lights, like an overturned mirror, radiating with the deep glow of wisdom The nature is complete.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[13766-13769]
. THUNDER! Sudden recognition! Immediate liberation! No stages! NOW!

Mirror-like wisdom is illustrated by how a mirror makes forms appear. Whatever reflection appears in it is not the actual form but the mirror making that reflection visible—this is the example

[13770-13774]
. When you recognize that the reflection is your own radiance, that is wisdom.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Then appears a yellow cloth with clear thigles of five lights

[13776-13783]
. This is the deep glow of equality wisdom arising.

Emaho!

[13785-13816]
Listen, you who seek liberation! Equality wisdom has four equalities: equal cause, equal condition, equal time, and equal nature The nature is complete.

Resting in the view, the treasury is the resting itself. Never closed. Spacious completion.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[13785-13788]
. The equal cause is all phenomena of samsara and nirvana. The equal condition is familiarity with dharmata. The equal time is when realization becomes manifest. The equal nature is your own awareness

[13789-13792]
. 

When you rest in this equality, it is called "equality" because dharmata cannot be corrected by anything, cannot be labeled with concepts or words

[13793-13794]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Dancing ground! Path is dance itself! Never departed! Sky dancing!

Wisdom means recognizing what has always been equal, and the characteristics becoming certain at this very moment.

Then appears a red cloth, clear and distinct, with thigles of five lights radiating—this is discriminating wisdom

[13798-13801]
. Discriminating means the twenty-one sense faculties, which reduce to nine, then to three (sharp, medium, dull), and ultimately to two: rigpa self-display and conceptual mind The nature is complete.

Logical analysis: if the treasury needed opening, it was incomplete. But primordial purity transcends completion/incompletion. Simply so.

From Oddiyana's sky-treasure: concepts bloom and dissolve like lotus in fire. The distinguisher was never born!

[13801-13820]
: person disease-struck, teeth's root gathering pus—nine days also die. Likewise various five days also die. Limbs repeatedly moving-contracting—seven days. Eyes bean-sprout looking—three days die. Eye joints greatly shaking—half month.

Cheek's vein broken

[13802-13806]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

With direct perception and subsequent attainment, you recognize what has always existed, the characteristics becoming certain

[13809-13810]
. No ten thousand hours needed. Immediate recognition available now. Contemporary mind. Timeless wisdom.

All-accomplishing wisdom comes from the seed aspect where power is not complete, so it is established in original purity

[13811-13812]
. From Oddiyana: recognition BLAZES immediately! Not tomorrow! NOW!

Between seeking and finding, the treasury was never hidden. Spacious completeness includes all.

Emaho!

[13817-13848]
You fortunate ones who have received the teachings! When all power is not complete at the final time, it is not complete [13817]. Therefore at this stage, your own ground's appearances are the four wisdoms preparation—since you are not liberated, power is incomplete.

 This is why we accept the four wisdoms preparation

[13818-13819]
. 

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

It is not that the distinction is wrong. It is that the distinction-maker has no self-nature. Seeing this liberation.

Then comes seeing the spontaneously accomplished precious jewel appearance. Until the actual result is complete, the four wisdoms appear as qualities, but all-accomplishing wisdom's own face does not appear because only the seed power exists, so the five wisdoms' aspects appear

[13820-13823]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Upon the four wisdom cloths are four thigles, upon which are small thigles in mandala arrangement like stacked spheres [13825]. Above them is a round light like a peacock umbrella—this is the five wisdoms' dharmadhatu appearance

[13821-13860]
—likewise nineteen days. Person life's formation doing, breath layered rough—six months. Nose's nasika broken—seven days die. Eye varana broken—five days die. Left cheek flesh fallen—one day likewise die. Upper-lower teeth meeting—three days certainly.

Tongue black thigle arisen

[13826-13827]
. This is the seed of spontaneous accomplishment appearing at this time. This is called "Vajrasattva's path of the heart center" [13829].

The essential instruction for remembering: All these appearances—without altering your awareness, recognize them as your own display and rest evenly in "ce-re"

[13831-13832]
. Like a golden hook drawing forth the heart-blood, relying on the mother's essential instruction, you become certain of your own display in the bardo and are liberated.

Emaho!

[13849-13888]
Listen closely, my heart-sons and heart-daughters! At this time, you must remember the supreme method—like the golden hook [13850]. The spontaneous accomplishment precious jewel appearance has six aspects: how it arises, how subsequent memory is born, how clairvoyance arises, how dharani is obtained, how samadhi is born, and how spontaneous accomplishment dissolves

[13851-13856]
. 

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The arising: When wisdom spontaneously accomplishes and dissolves, in that instant, all previous appearances and your own awareness gather into the upper light path, and from within that, they shine forth

[13857-13860]
. IMMEDIATE! Why gradual? Liberation NOW! Not next life! THIS MOMENT!

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The eight modes of arising appear:
- Arising like compassion: samsara and nirvana's boundary is cut
- Arising like light: all appearances are internally clear
- Arising like form: the objects of knowledge are not lost externally
- Arising like wisdom: all appearances are pure from the ground (gzhi)
- Arising like non-duality: your own awareness dwells one-pointedly
- Arising like freedom from extremes: not abiding in any extreme
- Arising like the gate of impure samsara: the source of existence is not stopped
- Arising like the gate of pure wisdom: dharmata and awareness are connected like mother and child

Dancing ground! Path is dance itself! Never departed! Sky dancing!

[13861-13880]
—two days also die. Ear attached to head—that very night midnight. Chest's lheng-na destroyed—half month certainly. Sleep root gone—half month likewise.

Emaho!

[13861-13869]
Emaho! It is not that gradual practice is wrong. It is that recognition itself is never gradual. Immediate clarity.

[13881-13910]
—special fields gathering collections, elements' dependent connection wheel, deceiving demons with ransom—three reverse even exhausted life. Sun-Moon Union states: "Signs arisen in body, death-deceiving ritual explained. Person reversal action begun: own guru, sangha, gathering special field, pleasing with gifts and feasts, these rituals begun."

Elements' sounds balanced

[13889-13910]
My dear ones, the eight modes of arising are: arising like compassion cuts samsara-nirvana's boundary; arising like light makes all appearances internally clear; arising like form prevents losing the objects of knowledge externally; arising like wisdom makes all appearances pure from the ground (gzhi); arising like non-duality makes your awareness dwell one-pointedly; arising like freedom from extremes means not abiding anywhere; arising like impure samsara's gate means existence's source isn't stopped; arising like pure wisdom's gate means dharmata and awareness connect as mother and child This is the treasury's heart.

THUNDER! Sudden! The distinction-maker liberated in wrathful compassion! Obstacles become the path! NOW!

[13889-13895]
. 

At this time, remember the supreme method—like the archer's arrow shot forth without returning [13896].

When rigpa dissolves into spontaneous accomplishment, at that very moment you reach the irreversible precious king's palace without having exited the gate—this is the extremely important essential instruction

[13897-13898]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The path IS the ground! Never walked! Immediate recognition! Why seek elsewhere?

Now, though you recognize the ground (gzhi)-display of clear light with its loop and thigle, if you do not turn back from that to the ordinary, you arrive at thodgal. At that time, it collapses [13899].

The text quotes the Talgyur: "The dharmata of rigpa is explained. Seeing directly in the loop, the moving recollections of conceptual thought cease. Like birds flying in space, there's no going from dharmadhatu. Through pure rigpa-display without other, the causes and conditions of deluded appearance are exhausted"

[13900-13908]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Emaho!

[13911-13940]
—tala leaf, elements' five wheels, four calculations navel aureole included, earth-water-fire-wind-space wheels five made, colors distinguished by elements. Navel spokes five, each own five syllables, aureole ali's groups surrounding.

Thus wheels written

[13911-13940]
Listen well, you who wish to be free! The second topic concerns how subsequent memory arises. Previous accumulations and the lama's compassion, entering into the sublime Dharma and training—these habits appear here [13911].

Receiving empowerments, you see the river of empowerment flowing. Practicing generation stage, you remember the deity. Practicing completion stage, path, essential instructions, meditation, and view are remembered. Pure aspirations are remembered, and those with dull faculties are blessed to remember natural nirmanakaya

[13912-13918]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

At this stage of spontaneous accomplishment, due to previous exceptional merit, your own display appears—this is called "ground empowerment"

[13919-13920]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

First, all Tathagatas from the sky above bestow empowerment, and offering goddesses without number rain down flower showers, singing auspicious songs and dancing—great appearances arise

[13921-13922]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

At this time, for those with supreme devotion to the lama, remembering the lama, he appears in space and gives essential instructions—liberation becomes inevitable

[13923-13924]
. For those with faith in the yidam, seeing the deity's face, the karmic body does not appear. When the yidam's illusory body is taken, prophecies also arise

[13925-13927]
. From Oddiyana: recognition BLAZES immediately! Not tomorrow! NOW!

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

While walking, cooking, singing the distinction dissolves into the song. Who was making distinctions? Just sunlight on frost.

Emaho!

[13928-13929]
. As the Wheel of Delight says: "Glorious Vajra-holder, supreme deity, please pay attention!"

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[13930-13932]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Introducing through the five paths' power, remembering that very nature, you gain mastery over bardo's dharmakaya, wisdom, light, color, and so forth

[13934-13935]
. Remembering the birthplace, the final emanation realm's breath is taken, and at this time, being born there, you are liberated [13936].

Remembering meditation, for five days you naturally dwell in natural meditation. Remembering the lama's essential instruction, knowing your own display, you practice dharmata

[13937-13938]
. Remembering the view, seeing the direct dharmata view previously, now recognizing it without doubt—like meeting a person you knew before The nature is complete.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[13939-13940]
. 

Dancing completion! Never closed! Sky itself is the treasure!

Diamond treasury indestructible completion. Never closed. Piercing clarity.

This transforms the previously deluded appearance into direct appearance, restfully arranged. Delusion becomes clear light, and when rigpa free of grasping and fixation shines within, you see dharmata with the eye free of conceptual investigation

[13941-13970]
, offering, praising, confession, each desired prayer. Navel elements' deity contemplated, syllable's number recited and stabilized. Then in kapala sealed, these wheels placed, five-colored cord swastika bound.

Wood, water, fire, earth

[13941-13974]
My devoted ones, these two—deity and lama—are drawn together as one memory because the supreme deity is the lama The nature is complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[13941-13942]
. Through view and meditation free of effort, you arrive at the ground (gzhi) of original purity, reaching the end where all appearance and fixation are exhausted.

Emaho!

[13971-14000]
, different types' breath, all mixed with meal and relics, form body one cubit. Five faculties' syllables written on paper, placed inside. This cures exhausted elements.

If demon-grasped

[13975-14004]
You who seek the truth, listen! The third topic explains how clairvoyance arises—six types: clairvoyance of sense faculties, mind-made clairvoyance, wisdom-controlled clairvoyance, pure wisdom vision clairvoyance, seeing dharmata unmistakenly clairvoyance, and seeing Buddha's knowledge unmistakenly clairvoyance This is the treasury's heart.

[13975-13981]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Attend. Recognize. Liberate.

Each of these can be divided into six parts, making thirty-six.

First, the six sense faculty clairvoyances: The first is eye clairvoyance arising. From the purified bubble-eye, without half-closing, you see all substances as pure from the ground (gzhi)

[13983-13985]
. With the flesh eye purified, you see coarse hidden objects within five miles [13986]. With the completely purified flesh eye, you see one continent with Mount Meru [13987].

 With extremely purified, you see two or three. With supremely purified, you see up to thousands and hundreds of thousands

[13988-13989]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

With the wisdom eye, you simultaneously see hundreds of nirmanakaya realms [13991]. With pure, you see eight hundred thousand nirmanakaya realms [13992]. With extremely pure, you see millions [13993]. With supremely pure, you see nine hundred million

[13994-13995]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Secret instruction: the distinction-maker is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight dissolves the moon.

Dancing ground! Path is dance itself! Never departed! Sky dancing!

With the all-knowing eye, simultaneously see hundreds of sambhogakaya realms [13996]. With pure, see fifty million [13997]. With extremely pure, see five billion [13998].

Emaho!

[14001-14020]
, person's age-years past measure, color changed, own stains cloth-piece, likewise elements' substances, mixed with meal made form. Cotton, silk, feathers decorated, that form; harmonious torma likewise.

That form finally

[14005-14034]
My heart-children, continue listening! With purest purity, simultaneously see seventy billion sambhogakaya realms [14000].

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Then with the all-aspects-knowing eye, simultaneously see inconceivable dharmakaya realms [14001]. With pure, simultaneously see inconceivable sambhogakaya realms [14002]. With extremely pure, simultaneously see inconceivable nirmanakaya realms [14003].

Then ear clairvoyance: With divine ear, upon hearing actual sounds, you also hear the voices of hidden beings [14005]. With pure, hear up to a thousand miles [14006]. With extremely pure, five thousand [14007]. With supremely pure, two hundred thousand [14008].

With flesh ear, hear the sounds of hell realms up to a hundred thousand miles [14009]. With pure, hear the voices of asuras [14010]. With extremely pure, hear gods' voices [14011]. With supremely pure, simultaneously hear the voices of inconceivable beings in continents without number [14012].

With liberated ear, hear shravakas and pratyekabuddhas' voices

[14013-14014]
. With pure, hear bodhisattva servants' voices [14015]. With extremely pure, hear the speech of countless Buddhas [14016].

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

It is not that the path is illusory. It is that the path and ground are not two. Precise recognition reveals unity. With supremely pure, hear the dialogue of seventy countless Buddhas

[14017-14018]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Ground itself. Path complete.

Emaho!

[14021-14040]
, person's age-years yoga around, blessed, these words spoken: "Take, take, powerful ones! Thirst, attachment, fixation, memory, grasping, thought, touch—release, pacify, liberate!" These words three times spoken.

Emaho!

[14035-14062]
You who practice the Dharma, understand this! Then nose clairvoyance: With divine nose, smell invisible scents [14019]. With pure, smell the scents of coarse material objects [14020]. With extremely pure, smell formless beings' scents [14021]. With supremely pure, smell space-dwellers' scents [14022].

With nose possessing marks, simultaneously smell the scents of the six realms' beings [14023]. With pure, smell shravakas and pratyekabuddhas' scents [14024]. With extremely pure, smell bodhisattvas' scents [14025]. With supremely pure, smell perfectly complete Buddhas' scents [14026].

Then tongue clairvoyance: With the pure element tongue, taste divine nectar [14027]. With pure, taste the flavor of seven thousand nectars [14028]. With extremely pure, taste the great actual nectar of dakinis [14029]. With supremely pure, taste the nectar of the hero who found the swirling nectar [14030].

With pure sense organ tongue, taste the samadhi flavor of great arrangement [14031]. With extremely pure, taste the nectar of five thousand Buddhas' blessings [14032]. With supremely pure, taste the nectar of seven billion Buddhas' blessings [14033].

Then body clairvoyance: With the body of subtle atoms completely purified, touched by gentle melody [14034]. With pure, touch Maitreya's stainless body [14035]. With extremely pure, touch the mind equal to a thousand suns' radiance [14036].

Emaho!

[14041-14060]
—from death reversal, no doubt, Narag-kan. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Fourth: death-point appearances

[14051-14059]
. Counting four and four, sixty-eight is sense faculty clairvoyance, included in six internal divisions Rest in this understanding.

Thus. The structure reveals what transcends structure. Complete from the beginning. No opening necessary.

[14060-14061]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The Treasury weaves distinctions to reveal what transcends all weaving. Seeing this the Great Perfection.

Open. Was never closed.

The second, mind-made clairvoyance six, are: pure vision purifying previous attachment [14063], pure vision of future delusion being exhausted [14064], pure vision of disciples' knowledge being complete [14065], pure vision of invisible becoming path [14066], pure vision of beings being completely perfected [14067], and pure vision of faculties being liberated from perversion

[14061-14080]
—elements each dissolving, channel-wind disturbance signs: earth dissolving into earth sign—body heavy, unable to rise; water dissolving—mouth and nose's water flows out then dries; fire dissolving—body's edges' warmth departs, radiance and vitality withdraw; wind dissolving—layered breath arises, body's strength departs. The nature is complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The division dissolves into what was never divided. Recognition completes the circle.

Sun-Moon Union

[14063-14086]
Listen well, fortunate ones! With supremely pure body, touch the mind mandala of infinite Samantabhadra [14037]. With defilements exhausted body, touch past Buddhas' minds [14038]. With pure, touch present Buddhas [14039].

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. With extremely pure, touch future Buddhas [14040]. With supremely pure, simultaneously touch the minds of time-three-as-one Buddhas [14041].

Then mind clairvoyance: With ordinary self-purified mind, master the ten samadhis [14043]. With pure, master a hundred [14044]. With extremely pure, master a thousand [14045]. With supremely pure, master ten thousand [14046].

With form-liberated mind, transform the power of the four elements individually [14047]. With pure, shift beings' suitable abodes [14048]. With extremely pure, shift the abodes of the six realms mutually [14049]. With supremely pure, steal the display powers of shravakas and pratyekabuddhas [14050].

Thus for the six sense faculties—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind—six for eye, three for ear, two each for the remaining four, making seventeen

[14068-14069]
. Three words. Recognition. Immediate. Now.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Emaho!

[14070-14071]
. 

Path is ground. Never walked.

Secret completion: the treasury is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight was never obscured.

However, afflictions becoming wisdom by purification power does not mean afflictions themselves transform into wisdom—that is impossible because virtue and non-virtue are cause and effect and can never be the same

[14072-14074]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

It is not that the distinction is wrong. It is that the distinction-maker has no self-nature. Seeing this liberation.

Still, it is taught this way, and you should understand it thus. If you have wisdom, there is something extremely important here.

First, with pure vision purifying previous attachment's mind, you remember past lives—hundreds with pure, a thousand simultaneously with pure, a hundred thousand with extremely pure, and seven hundred twenty thousand simultaneously with supremely pure, like holding fresh fruit in your palm

[14076-14080]
. From Oddiyana: recognition BLAZES immediately! Not tomorrow! NOW!

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

With pure vision of future delusion being exhausted, you know the characteristics of the body taken in past lives

[14081-14100]
: "Earth into earth dissolving, likewise water, fire, wind, each self-dissolving, thus comes to person's body. Earth self-dissolving, body heavy, food not taken, rising and going strength all gone. Water into water dissolving, mouth-nose's water flows. Likewise fire into fire, mouth-nose very dry, body's edge warmth departs. Likewise wind into wind, breath rough rough, limbs shake, eyes also upward turn."

Fifth: crucial pointing-out instructions

[14081-14082]
. With pure, speech; with extremely pure, mind; with supremely pure, all three body, speech, and mind simultaneously Rest in this understanding.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[14083-14085]
. Logical analysis: if liberation were gradual, it would be compounded. But recognition is uncompounded. Immediate.

It is not that the treasury opens. It is that the perception of closure dissolves. Precision reveals what was never obscured.

Already complete. Before seeking.

With complete knowledge of disciples' mind vision, you see countless sentient beings' body characteristics

[14086-14087]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

It is not that the distinction is wrong. It is that the distinction-maker has no self-nature. Seeing this liberation.

Emaho!

[14087-14114]
My devoted students, you might wonder how clairvoyance of body and mind arises when there is no body or mind. The answer is that the obscurations to body and mind clairvoyance are purified at this time by power, so it is said. Just as the five afflictions becoming ground makes them wisdom

[14088-14120]
Listen closely, you who would be free! With pure vision, you see others' speech; with extremely pure, their mind; with supremely pure, all three simultaneously Rest in this understanding.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[14088-14090]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

While walking, the path reveals itself as ground. Just footsteps on earth. Never left.

With invisible-becoming-path mind vision, in an instant you know the number of dust particles in three thousand great thousand-worlds

[14091-14092]
. With pure, you simultaneously know the number of sentient beings in each of those dust particles and how their minds change [14093]. With extremely pure, you know the nature (rang bzhin) of vessel and contents [14094]. With supremely pure, you see dharmata emptiness [14095].

With beings-completely-perfected mind vision, you simultaneously see how many winds moved when you took bodies in the past

[14096-14097]
. With pure, you simultaneously see how many non-virtuous minds arose [14097]. With extremely pure, virtuous numbers [14098]. With supremely pure, both virtue and non-virtue simultaneously [14099].

With faculties-liberated-from-perversion mind vision, you see the characteristics of places where you took countless past lives

[14100-14101]
. With pure, see others' past birthplaces [14102]. With extremely pure, know what conduct of body, speech, and mind was done then [14103]. With supremely pure, simultaneously know both self and others' past birthplaces and three doors' conduct [14104].

Thus mind clairvoyance six, divided into four each, makes twenty-four categories [14105].

Emaho!

[14101-14120]
—three: best, familiar space-awareness self-placed; middle, transference training; last, depending on other conditions. Recognition is immediate.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

First

[14106-14141]
You seekers of truth, attend! The third, wisdom-controlled clairvoyance six, are: wisdom vision free of intellect, free of words, free of conception, free of investigation, characteristic-analyzing wisdom vision, and characteristic-free wisdom vision This is the treasury's heart.

Why wait even a moment! The distinction burns in recognition! The maker dissolves NOW!

[14106-14121]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Being free of intellect, you see your own mind's characteristics instantaneously [14113]. With pure, see self and other; with extremely pure, see self and other both; with supremely pure, see all remaining without exception

[14114-14115]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

ROAR! Treasury complete! Never closed! Cut through seeking! NOW!

Free of words wisdom vision: simultaneously see the words of the tripitaka teachings [14116]. With pure, know unmistaken and mistaken meaning [14117]. With extremely pure, know their results and liberation places [14118]. With supremely pure, see their individual entries [14119].

The unmistaken meaning of tripitaka is the uncommon secret; the mistaken is common view, conduct, and investigation

[14120-14121]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Free of conception wisdom vision: know the nature (rang bzhin) of all phenomena [14122]. With pure, see practitioners' sharp and dull faculties [14123]. With extremely pure, know faculties' liberation places [14124]. With supremely pure, know faculties' dharmic correspondences [14125].

Beyond investigation wisdom vision: see all general meaning as vipashyana [14126]. With pure, see your own meaning; with extremely pure, see both general and specific characteristics as vipashyana; with supremely pure, see meaning beyond words and letters

[14121-14140]
: yogin alone dying, if non-separation in clear light's appearance, at that time also not depending on others, self-appearing clarity from that nature unwaveringly placed. Body key posture, three or cross-legged or lion's lying, rigpa space-awareness directed, dying—at that instant upward zangthal liberation, no dharmata bardo.

Sun-Moon Union

[14127-14129]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Emaho!

[14130-14162]
My heart-sons and daughters, listen! Cutting-birth wisdom vision: see samsara's phenomena causes [14130]. With pure, see their conditions—the afflictions' characteristics [14131]. With extremely pure, see their times and characteristics [14132]. With supremely pure, see liberation from them [14133].

Free of characteristics wisdom vision: understand the measure of your mind's changes [14134]. With pure, see mind's characteristics as merely seeing; with extremely pure, see other beings' mind changes; with supremely pure, simultaneously see time-three beings' mind changes, conceptual and non-conceptual, and thought distinctions

[14135-14140]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

I have memorized all distinctions. Then I forgot: who was memorizing? The library dissolves into spaciousness.

See the distinction. Who makes it? Empty.

Thus wisdom clairvoyance six, divided into four groups, makes twenty-four [14141].

The fourth, pure wisdom vision clairvoyance six: With dharmadhatu wisdom manifest clairvoyance, know future beings' birthplaces simultaneously [14143]. Mirror-like knows past [14144]. Equality knows present [14145]. Discriminating knows future beings' death and transition [14146]. All-accomplishing knows past. Non-abiding wisdom pure vision knows present beings' death and transition [14147].

The fifth, seeing dharmata unmistakenly clairvoyance six: When born, since your own purpose is complete, you engage in others' benefit activity [14149]. With clairvoyance realizing all phenomena free of elaboration, see hell realms simultaneously and can emanate countless millions there

[14141-14160]
: "Then that fortunate person's appearance self-clear, non-dwelling awareness self-place." Lion-posture aggregates: rigpa directed at eyes, mind slightly sky-path made; if space-awareness not changing, that person without bardo becomes Buddha without doubt. Dying breath also becomes slow.

Emaho!

[14150-14151]
. I studied gradual paths for years. Then forgot: recognition was always immediate. The library blazed open.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Emaho!

[14151-14153]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Contemporary mind makes distinctions. Contemporary recognition sees through. Direct. Immediate.

ThreDirect. Immediate. Certain.th all phenomena realized as self-luminous nature, see animal realms, sufferings, lifespans, karma, and karmic results, and emanate five measures of countless forms

[14154-14158]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Thus. The analysis dissolves the analyzer. Categories collapse into recognition.

With all phenomena realized as equality, see human realms and so forth, and emanate hundreds of billions

[14158-14159]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

With all phenomena realized as empty of self or mine, see asura realms and characteristics, and emanate ninety thousand

[14159-14161]
. THUNDER! Sudden recognition! Immediate liberation! No stages! NOW!

The Treasury's path vast oceanic ground. What seemed journey was always waves on water never leaving water.

With all phenomena realized as free of words, see gods' realms, lifespans, and fall times, and emanate nine hundred thousand [14161].

Thus, through self-arising knowledge of others' benefit, the different types of beings—twenty-one hells, four hungry ghosts, two animals, four humans, three asuras, and though gods have many types, included in three realms—six birthplaces of gods, their forms, enjoyments, conduct, perceptions, and characteristics

[14161-14180]
, dying where snow or rock cave or without people, mind-distracting conditions not existing, crucial. Shantideva: "Dwellers nearby whoever, not grieving; this one Buddha-recollection, etc., no one becomes distracted."

Second: as before shown, transference crucial done

[14162-14175]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The six clairvoyances see and know faculties and powers [14175].

Thus thirty with outflows—the six sense faculty ways of seeing—and thirty without outflows—the six faculties' seeing others—sixty

[14163-14197]
Listen well, you fortunate ones! With characteristicless dharmata realization, see hungry ghost realms, lifespans, sufferings, karma, and karmic results, and emanate three measures of countless forms This is the treasury's heart.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[14176-14177]
. The Great Perfection transcends gradual and sudden. Recognition is the nature itself immediate as awareness.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Emaho!

[14178-14199]
My devoted ones, understand this distinction! Regarding object, with outflows and without are spoken.

I mapped all paths. Then forgot: the ground was never mapped. Never departed from.

[14178-14180]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

In nature, the realizing mind of aryas is without outflows, equal; ordinary beings' is with outflows—know thus

[14181-14199]
—wind consciousness entering, life-wind from heart's place moving time, this is the time. Rigpa from heart directed at own guru's kaya-colors, hi-gi sound seven or twenty-one to Brahma-opening thrown, ka-dag's ground instantly zangthal liberation.

[14181-14182]
. In a freezing cave... waited for gradual progress. Then a bird called. Immediate. Complete.

After centuries of distinction, the rediscovery: the distinguisher was never other.

The sixth, Buddha's knowledge extremely without outflows clairvoyance six: Having completed the thirty-six, dwelling as samadhi, seeing and abiding in things' mode without mistake

[14183-14186]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Essence expanding as form, see all appearances included in three kayas

[14186-14187]
. Knowledge expanding as wisdom, simultaneously see previous clairvoyances Recognition is immediate.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[14187-14188]
. Activity expanding as deeds, see thirty-six perfect marks of emanation body activity The nature is complete.

Resting in the view, the treasury is the resting itself. Never closed. Spacious completion.

Secret ground: the path is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight never leaves the moon.

[14188-14189]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Diamond precision: pierce the distinction-maker. Obstacles transform into diamond wisdom. Liberation through wrath.

Thus expanding, engaging in unceasing dharmata wisdom clairvoyance, seeing hidden objects

[14189-14190]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Self-purifying signs wisdom, self-existing nature abiding clairvoyance, emptiness appearance

[14190-14191]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Invisible faculties, knowledge, mind, wisdom, and wisdom, and compassion's aspects

[14191-14196]
—previously bound by self-belief in three kayas' hidden ordinary fixation, all liberated by knowledge, so called "great clairvoyance" Recognition is immediate.

[14197-14198]
. 

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Emaho!

[14199-14199]
You who seek liberation, listen! While walking, recognition dawns. Immediate. Not after ten thousand steps. Now.

The Treasury's path vast oceanic ground. What seemed journey was always waves on water never leaving water.

Diamond ground indestructible path. Never departed. Piercing clarity of unity.

[14199-14199]
. These also gather into six groups. 

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[13701-14200] The Treasury's extensive presentation of bardo, dissolution, lights, deities, and clairvoyances is complete. All these are supports for recognition—not things to achieve but appearances to recognize. May all who encounter these words recognize their own nature and achieve liberation.

[13701-14200] I sat in retreat once... bows to the bardo teachings. Thanks them for their clarity. Death comes to all. Recognition is the only preparation that matters. Practice now. Recognize now. Be ready now.

[13701-14200] From Lotus-Born: May all who read these bardo instructions recognize the lights as their own wisdom. May they not fear the deities. May they see through the displays and rest in dharmakaya. This is the blessing of Padmasambhava.

[13701-14200] Three ultimate words. Bardo. Recognize. Liberate. Stop. The bardo teaching is complete. The recognition is available. Liberation is certain. Rest in that. Complete.

[13701-14200] FINAL ROAR! All bardos! All lights! All deities! CUT THROUGH THEM! See what was never born! Never died! Never wandered! AH AH AH!

[13701-14200] The essence beyond all bardo teachings: awareness is never born, never dies, never wanders. The dissolution is its play. The lights are its display. The deities are its ornaments. Recognition is seeing through the play.

[13701-14200] The integration of bardo theory and practice: dissolution stages prepare the mind. Light recognition provides the method. Deity recognition offers opportunity. All integrate into one moment of recognition at death.

[13701-14200] Emaho! The bardo! The lights! The liberation! What joy to know these teachings! What bliss to practice them! This yogi dances through death into recognition!

[13701-14200] Between life and death, between death and rebirth, between all bardos, the consort dances. The lights are her ornaments. The deities are her forms. Recognition is joining her dance. Liberation is the dance itself.

[13701-14200] Thus concludes the presentation of bardo and liberation. The ground is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. May all beings recognize their nature and achieve liberation. This is the prayer of Longchenpa.

[13701-14200] This old man's final teaching: Don't fear death. Don't seek rebirth. Recognize the nature. Rest in that recognition. Complete in that. The end of all bardos.

[13701-14200] Absolute final words. Bardo. Complete. You. Complete. Stop. The teaching is complete. You are complete. Rest. The end of the bardo presentation.
