[19303-19309]
See directly: In this manner. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[19303-19316]
This hermit realized: An old traveler. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[19310-19325]
This very light—all arise-basis and cease-place both. That also: first dimension appearance, now path appearance, between self-appearance—all this life's five lights outer arise, now or between or basis appearance dissolve time, these five dimensions self-absorbed. Briefly: inner body wisdom abiding, outer appearance body wisdom appear—arise-basis and cease-place both.

[19317-19332]
Cut through now!  The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

An old traveler... walked thousands of miles. Then rested. The ground was always beneath me.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[19326-19345]
Look now: Hence. The structure. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[19333-19352]
This old hermit found an old crystal in the mountains. In its clear depths, rainbows appeared—not created by the crystal, not separate from it. The five lights are like this: not created by awareness, not separate from it. The crystal doesn't try to show rainbows; they naturally appear. So too with the bindu.

[19339-19358]
First, heart center five lights spontaneous bindu, light root clear inside dwell. Five lights' rim appear, therefore called nature light bindu. That primordially pure rigpa ornament, therefore called Samantabhadra bindu. From that: basis-grasp bindu two—nature light bindu and Samantabhadra bindu. This very Guhyasamaja indestructible bindu called.

[19345-19370]
Between form and emptiness, the vast middle way opens. The bindu is not a thing, not nothing. It is the potential for all appearance, like a seed containing the tree.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

ROAR! The distinction-maker! Cut through! NOW! Liberation is immediate! AH! Not the seed, not the tree, but the continuity between them. This is the secret of the bindu.

[19360-19380]
Sudden recognition! Consequently. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

[19370-19395]
Thus established: This cave dweller. Three words. Recognition. Immediate. Now.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[19380-19400]
The bindu is the bridge between basis and fruit. On the basis, it is the potential for all display.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

 On the path, it is the support for practice.

See the ground. Walking dissolves. In the fruit, it is the complete realization. Three names for one reality—like water, ice, and steam, all H2O.

[19400-19403]
Between these extremes: Thus established. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What appears as obstacle is the path itself, unrecognized.

[19303-19303]
This old hermit offers final teaching: Don't chase the five lights like a child chases rainbows. The rainbow is not the goal; the clear sky is. The lights are signs on the path, not the destination. Rest in the nature (rang bzhin) of awareness, and lights appear naturally. Seek the lights, and you lose the nature (rang bzhin).

[19303-19303]

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[19303-19303]
This very moment— The framework reveals.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Open. Was never closed.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.
