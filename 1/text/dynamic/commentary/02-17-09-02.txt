Secret: mind in unfabricated natural place. Thatness: clear light mother and child meet. Four times, four practices, one recognition. The body, speech, mind, and clear light—all gathered in the practice.

[3198-3210] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Four. Times. Join. The four times are not sequential—they are simultaneous. The outer channels and winds, the inner speech, the secret mind, the thatness clear light—all joined in equalness. Four names for one practice.

[3198-3210] Voice 04 (Padmasambhava): The four times are the four consorts—outer, inner, secret, thatness. The outer is the body holding channels. The inner is the speech explaining. The secret is the mind resting. The thatness is clear light mother meeting child. All four united in the bindu.

[3211-3220] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Outer time four: yogi's body power trained, channels sources holding crucial. Inner time four: yogi's speech power trained, explanation ornaments cut crucial. Secret time four: yogi's mind's power trained, sleep familiarity crucial. Thatness time four: body speech mind gathered, clear light great sleep joined, familiarized, three bodies certainly joined.

[3211-3220] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Four times training the body, speech, mind, and clear light. The body holds the channels. The speech cuts ornaments. The mind rests in sleep. The clear light joins mother and child. Three bodies are joined—the practice is complete.

[3221-3230] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Here clear light four times equal joining crucial point condensed showing: Daytime appearances wide strike, evening sense bases place gather, midnight knowables vase place, dawn wisdom clear make. First, equipoise and post-attainment two: equipoise—sleep joined, lion's manner, wind slowly held, eyes not closing, heart inside five lights ball mind held, sleeping, outer appearances gradually going, sleep and dream gap, knowing thought-free clear certain existing, that clear light recognize, that nature not dull sleep, sleep clear light appear, dream none, knowing samadhi nature self-clear.

[3221-3230] Voice 13 (Patrul): The four times in practice: daytime appearances wide strike, evening sense bases gather, midnight knowables in vase, dawn wisdom clear. Two aspects: equipoise and post-attainment. Equipoise—sleep joined, lion's manner, wind held slowly, eyes not closing, heart holding five lights, sleeping. Outer appearances gradually go. The gap between sleep and dream—knowing thought-free clear certainty. Recognize that clear light. Not dull sleep—the clear light appears in sleep. No dream—knowing samadhi nature self-clear.

[3231-3240] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Sleep gone, nearby forms sounds smells not ceased, knowing. Not gone, conditions from that nature waking. Day appearance from thought ceased merely, appearance aspect separate clear. The sleep is gone but forms, sounds, smells are not ceased—knowing continues. Not gone—the conditions from that nature become waking. Day appearance arises when thought ceases—appearance aspect separate clear.

[3231-3240] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Sleep. Wake. Clear. Sleep is not absence of waking—it is another mode of clear light. Forms and sounds continue in sleep—the knowing continues. When thought ceases, appearance becomes clear. Sleep and waking are not two.

[3241-3250] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The practice of clear light in sleep. Hold the wind slowly. Close the eyes partially. Rest the heart in the center with five lights. Let the outer appearances gradually dissolve. Find the gap between sleep and dream. In that gap, knowing is present—clear, without thought. Recognize that clear light. Not dull sleep—it is the clear light appearing. No dream—just knowing, samadhi, self-clear nature.

[3241-3250] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man practiced sleep yoga for years. The key is finding the gap. Not in deep sleep, not in dreaming—in the transition. The gap where knowing is present without thought. That's where the clear light appears. Recognize it. Stay in it.

[3251-3260] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The four times in detail. Outer: daytime practice—appearances wide, striking the eye. Inner: evening practice—sense bases gather at the heart. Secret: midnight—knowables in the vase of the central channel. Thatness: dawn—wisdom clears, makes manifest. Four times, four practices, one clear light.

[3251-3260] Voice 04 (Padmasambhava): The four times correspond to the four activities. Daytime—appearances arise widely. Evening—the senses gather inward. Midnight—the knowables rest in the central channel. Dawn—wisdom clears the darkness. These are the times of practice.

[3261-3270] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Two aspects: equipoise and post-attainment. Equipoise: sleeping in the manner of the lion. Wind held slowly, eyes not closing, heart at center with five lights. This is the practice of clear light in sleep. Post-attainment: when sleep is gone, forms and sounds continue. Knowing persists. The conditions of sleep become the conditions of waking. When thought ceases, appearance becomes clear.

[3261-3270] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): The practice in sleep: hold like a lion. Wind slow, eyes open, heart at center. Find the gap between sleep and dream. There—the clear light appears. Not dull sleep—the knowing is present. This is the recognition.

[3271-3280] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The clear light is not achieved—it is recognized. The mother clear light and child clear light were never separate. The practice joins them. The body, speech, mind are gathered in the clear light. The three bodies—nirmanakaya, sambhogakaya, dharmakaya—are certainly joined in the yogi who familiarizes with this practice.

[3271-3280] Voice 13 (Patrul): The mother clear light—your original awareness. The child clear light—the recognition in the moment. They meet in the practice. The body, speech, mind are gathered. The three bodies become one. This is the clear light practice.

[3281-3290] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The practice familiarizes the yogi with clear light. The four times: outer, inner, secret, thatness. The equal joining: channels and winds held, speech explained and cut, mind resting in natural place, clear light mother and child meeting. All four gathered in the practice. The three bodies certainly joined.

[3281-3290] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Gather. Join. Recognize. The body gathered, speech gathered, mind gathered—the clear light joins them. Mother and child meet. The three bodies complete.

[Final] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Fourth, clear light practice—four times equal joining. Outer: channels and winds continuously held. Inner: speech ornaments explained and exhausted. Secret: mind resting in unfabricated natural place. Thatness: clear light mother-child meet. The four times: daytime appearances wide, evening sense bases gather, midnight knowables in vase, dawn wisdom clears. Two: equipoise and post-attainment. Equipoise—sleep joined, lion manner, wind slowly held, eyes not closing, heart with five lights, sleeping, outer appearances gradually go, gap between sleep and dream, knowing thought-free clear, recognize clear light, not dull sleep, clear light appears, no dream, knowing samadhi self-clear. Sleep gone but forms sounds smells continue knowing. Day appearance from thought ceased, appearance aspect clear. The mother and child clear light never separate—practice joins them. Body speech mind gathered in clear light—three bodies certainly joined. The yogi who familiarizes with this achieves the three bodies. Four times, one practice. Outer, inner, secret, thatness—four gates to same recognition. Sleep and clear light are not two. Mother and child embrace in the gap between sleep and dream. Rest in this union. The practice is not achieving—it is recognizing what was always present. The clear light is always shining—the practice removes the obscuration. The yogi trains the body to hold channels, the speech to cut ornaments, the mind to rest in sleep, the clear light to join mother and child. When all four are gathered, the three bodies are complete. The outer time four trains the body's power, holding the channels. The inner time four trains speech's power, cutting ornaments. The secret time four trains the mind's power, familiarity with sleep. The thatness time four gathers body speech mind, joins clear light with great sleep. Thus familiarized, the three bodies are certainly joined in the yogi. The clear light four times equal joining crucial point condensed: daytime appearances strike widely, evening sense bases gather, midnight knowables rest in vase, dawn wisdom clears. First, equipoise and post-attainment: equipoise is sleeping joined in lion's manner, wind slowly held, eyes not closing, heart inside with five lights ball holding mind, sleeping while outer appearances gradually go, in the gap between sleep and dream knowing thought-free clear certainty exists, recognizing that clear light, that nature is not dull sleep, sleep clear light appears, dream none, knowing samadhi nature self-clear. Sleep gone but nearby forms sounds smells not ceased, knowing. Not gone—conditions from that nature become waking. Day appearance from thought ceased merely, appearance aspect separate clear.

Emaho! The four times equal joining! The clear light in sleep! The mother-child meeting!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
