[3198-3298] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Fourth, clear light practice depending on four times equal joining instruction. Outer four times equal joining channels-winds continuous hold. Inner four times equal joining speech ornament explanation exhausted. Secret four times equal joining instruction mind unfabricated natural place. Thatness four times equal joining instruction clear light mother-child meet. From that: "Outer time four, yogi body's power trained, channels sources holding crucial. Inner time four itself, yogi speech's power trained, explanation ornaments cut crucial. Secret time four also, yogi mind's power trained, sleep familiarity crucial. Thatness time four, body speech mind by gathered, clear light great sleep joined, thus familiarized three bodies certainly joined, yogi!"

[3198-3298] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Four. Times. Stop. You think four times are sequential. They are simultaneous. Outer, inner, secret, thatness—four names for one recognition. The channels, speech, mind, clear light—all gathered in the unfabricated nature. Stop dividing what is indivisible.

[3198-3298] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man once tried to practice the four times separately! Outer in morning, inner at noon, secret in evening, thatness at night. Exhausting! Then realized—the four times are always present. The body sitting is outer. The breath flowing is inner. The mind aware is secret. The clear light is thatness. All now.

[3198-3298] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The four times are the four consorts' embrace—simultaneous, complete, perfect. Outer Brahma's wife, inner Vishnu's wife, secret Shiva's wife, thatness your own wife. All four united in the bindu of clear light. The mother clear light meets the child clear light—they were never separate.

[3198-3298] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): FOUR TIMES! speaks with fierce compassion I will destroy your sequence! Outer is inner! Secret is thatness! All one clear light! The mother and child never separated! RECOGNIZE THIS!

[3221-3298] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Here clear light four times equal joining crucial point condensed showing: Daytime appearances wide strike, evening sense bases place gather, midnight knowables vase place, dawn wisdom clear make. First, equipoise and post-attainment two: equipoise—sleep joined, lion's manner, wind slowly held, eyes not closing, heart inside five lights ball mind held, sleeping, outer appearances gradually going, sleep and dream gap, knowing thought-free clear certain existing, that clear light recognize, that nature not dull sleep, sleep clear light appear, dream none, knowing samadhi nature self-clear. Sleep gone, nearby forms sounds smells not ceased, knowing. Not gone, conditions from that nature waking. Day appearance from thought ceased merely, appearance aspect separate clear.

[3221-3298] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Sleep. Clear. Stop. You think clear light is something to achieve in sleep. Sleep is clear light. The gap between sleep and dream is the mother clear light. The recognition is the child. When they meet, you recognize what was never absent.

[Final] Four times, one practice. Outer inner secret thatness—four gates to the same recognition. Sleep and clear light are not two. The mother and child embrace. Rest in this union.

Emaho! The four times equal joining!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
