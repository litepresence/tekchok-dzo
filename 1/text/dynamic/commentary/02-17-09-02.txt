[3198-3218] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Fourth, clear light practice depending on four times equal joining instruction. Outer four times equal joining: channels-winds continuously held. Inner four times equal joining: speech ornament explanation exhausted. Secret four times equal joining: instruction mind unfabricated natural place. Thatness four times equal joining: instruction clear light mother-child meet. From the tantra: "Outer time four, yogi body's power trained, channels sources holding crucial. Inner time four itself, yogi speech's power trained, explanation ornaments cut crucial. Secret time four also, yogi mind's power trained, sleep familiarity crucial. Thatness time four, body speech mind by gathered, clear light great sleep joined, thus familiarized three bodies certainly joined, yogi!"

[3198-3218] Voice 13 (Patrul): Four times equal joining—outer, inner, secret, thatness. This old man practiced this for years. Outer: hold the channels and winds continuously, day and night. Inner: cut through speech ornaments, rest in unfabricated naturalness. Secret: let mind rest in its own place, no contrivance. Thatness: the meeting of mother and child clear light. Four gates to the same palace.

[3198-3218] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Four. Times. Join. The four times are not sequential—they are simultaneous. The outer channels and winds, the inner speech, the secret mind, the thatness clear light—all joined in equalness. Four names for one practice. The body trains, speech cuts, mind rests, clear light meets. Complete.

[3219-3246] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The practice method in detail: Daytime appearances wide strike (snang ba rgyas yis gdab pa)—appearances strike widely, penetrating vision. Evening sense bases place gather (srod la dbang po gnas su bsdud pa)—senses gather at the heart at dusk. Midnight knowables vase place (nam phyed shes bya bum par gzhug pa)—knowables enter the vase of central channel at midnight. Dawn wisdom clear make (tho rangs ye shes gsal bar byed pa)—wisdom clears at dawn. First, equipoise (mnyam gzhag) and post-attainment (rjes thob) two. Equipoise: sleep joined, lion's manner (seng ge'i nyal lugs)—the lion sleeps with awareness, wind slowly held, eyes not closing, heart inside five lights ball mind held. Sleeping thus, outer appearances gradually going, sleep and dream gap, knowing thought-free clear certain existing—that is clear light. Recognize it. Not dull sleep—sleep is clear light appearing. No dream—knowing samadhi nature self-clear.

[3219-3246] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man practiced sleep yoga in a cave for three winters! The key is finding the gap—not deep sleep, not dreaming, but the transition between. Hold the wind slowly. Don't close the eyes fully. Rest the mind on the five lights at the heart. Let appearances dissolve gradually. In that gap, there's clear knowing without thought. That's the mother clear light meeting the child. Recognize it! Don't fall into dull sleep. Stay clear.

[3219-3246] Voice 05 (Mipham): The four times correspond to the dissolution process. Daytime—elements and consciousnesses fully manifest. Evening—sense consciousnesses begin gathering at the heart. Midnight—mind consciousness enters the central channel vase. Dawn—the clear light dawns as wisdom. This mirrors the death process, making sleep practice preparation for the bardo.

[3247-3256] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Sleep gone but nearby forms sounds smells not ceased—knowing continues. Not gone—the conditions from that nature waking. Day appearance from thought ceased merely, appearance aspect separate clear. From Thalgyur: "Clear light transfer excellently, sleep samadhi trained by familiarization, day and night without distinction, outer appearances clear—this achieves great clear light." The six collections of consciousness cease but five door consciousnesses not ceased—clear. Mind consciousness dissolves into clear light, wind enters central channel. Five door consciousnesses thought-free so appearing objects not grasped—clear but non-conceptual clarity.

[3247-3256] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): THOUGHT CEASES! CONSCIOUSNESS DISSOLVES! Yet knowing remains! Clear but non-conceptual! This is the fierce clarity that cuts through all dullness! The gap between sleep and waking—THERE! The clear light shines! SEE IT! Not tomorrow—NOW!

[3247-3256] Voice 03 (Dakini): I dance in the gap between sleep and dream. The six consciousnesses dissolve into me. The five senses remain as my ornaments. Clear light is my body, bliss is my breath, non-conceptuality is my movement. Dance with me in the midnight hour, yogi!

[3257-3293] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): At this time, bliss clear light exists in the samadhi of co-emergent bliss. Clarity clear light exists when day and night are joined in samadhi. Non-conceptual clear light exists when mind's grasping thought ceases. Bliss clear light—unbearable to separate from samadhi, appearance of joy and bliss arises as experience. Clarity clear light—smoke, mirage, fireflies, clouds, lightning, flames, moon, sun, dark jewel forms, five lights appearing, thigle, deity forms, beings, fields many seen. Seeing through walls, leaving meditation room, walls and fences passing through ability, etc. Clairvoyance and many higher perceptions dawn. Non-conceptual clear light—samadhi day-night joined, looking at whatever appears thought-free relaxed, any talk without duality goes thought-free, always dwelling in sky-like space experience immeasurable dawns. These are certain experiences, proven by valid cognition—profound crucial point.

[3257-3293] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man has seen the smoke, the mirage, the fireflies! First it's frightening—"Am I going mad?" Then it's beautiful. The five lights appearing, the thigles, the deities. But don't get attached! These are signs, not the goal. The goal is the clear light behind the signs. The bliss is nice but don't cling. The clarity is bright but don't grasp. The non-conceptuality is free but don't identify.

[3257-3293] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The essence of the three clear lights: bliss without attachment to samadhi, clarity without fixation on visions, non-conceptuality without falling into blankness. The five lights are wind's clear light, external color clear light. From this, seeing one's own body's particles and internal organs, day and night appearing equally, seeing others' bodies inside, fields, lands, what beings do, death and birth—all appear. Hold this essence.

[3294-3301] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, post-attainment: rising from equipoise. From that state rising, outer appearances appear as five lights forms, beings and trees appearing, view as eight magic examples, view as sky-like, mixing with whatever experience, training empty-clear appearance without grasping as one—this is the true crucial point. At that time, immeasurable rainbow lights, thigle, body appearances dawn—they are the five winds' clear light, external color clear light.

[3294-3301] Voice 08 (Integrator): Post-attainment integrates equipoise. The clear light recognized in sleep continues into waking. The five lights seen in meditation appear in daily life. The sky-like view pervades all activities. Integration is not losing recognition when rising from meditation—it is carrying the meditation into the world.

[3302-3310] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, evening sense bases gather at heart: sitting in vajra posture, from secret place to Brahma aperture, inside central channel white A like stacked dongtshe, all gradually dissolving one into one, finally all placed in sky space. Third, midnight knowables enter vase: sleeping in lion's manner, mind placed on five lights lamp inside heart. Fourth, dawn wisdom clears: with lion's gaze upward, from crown to arrow-space's sky white A hovering, mind held there.

[3302-3310] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Dissolve. Into. Space. The white A dissolves. The knowables enter the vase. The wisdom clears. Body, speech, mind, clear light—all dissolve into space. Space dissolves into awareness. Awareness rests in recognition. Complete.

[3302-3310] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): The white A at dawn! The lion's gaze upward! All dissolving into space! Space itself dissolves! What remains? AWARENESS! Clear, bright, non-conceptual! THIS IS THE CLEAR LIGHT! AH!

[Final Summary] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The four times equal joining practice is the heart of clear light yoga. Outer: channels and winds held continuously. Inner: speech ornaments cut. Secret: mind in unfabricated natural place. Thatness: clear light mother-child meeting. Daytime—appearances strike widely. Evening—senses gather at heart. Midnight—knowables enter vase. Dawn—wisdom clears. In equipoise: lion's sleep, wind held slowly, eyes not closing, five lights at heart, appearances dissolve, gap between sleep and dream, thought-free knowing, recognize clear light. Post-attainment: rising without losing recognition, appearances as five lights, eight magic examples, sky-like view. The three clear lights: bliss—co-emergent joy; clarity—visions of smoke, mirage, fireflies, five lights, deities; non-conceptual—thought-free knowing. From these experiences, clairvoyance, penetrating vision, walking through walls—all siddhis arise naturally. The profound crucial point: not achieving but recognizing, not transforming but uncovering, not refining but revealing what was always present. The mother clear light—primordially pure. The child clear light—spontaneously present. Their meeting is the Great Perfection.

[Final] Emaho! The four times equal joining! The clear light in sleep! The three clear lights—bliss, clarity, non-conceptual! The mother and child meeting! The yogi certainly joined with the three bodies! Daytime appearances wide! Evening senses gather! Midnight knowables in vase! Dawn wisdom clears! Lion's sleep! Five lights! Gap between sleep and dream! Thought-free knowing! Recognition! Not dull sleep—clear light appearing! Post-attainment integration! Eight magic examples! Sky-like view! Walking through walls! Seeing beings' births and deaths! All from clear light practice! The Treasury reveals the clear light that was never hidden!

See what is. Rest in recognition. The clear light is always shining.
