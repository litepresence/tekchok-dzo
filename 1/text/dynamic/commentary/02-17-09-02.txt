Fourth, clear light practice depending on four times equal joining instruction. Outer four times equal joining: channels-winds continuously held. Inner four times equal joining: speech ornament explanation exhausted. Secret four times equal joining: instruction mind unfabricated natural place. Thatness four times equal joining: instruction clear light mother-child meet.

From the tantra: "Outer time four, yogi body's power trained, channels sources holding crucial. Inner time four itself, yogi speech's power trained, explanation ornaments cut crucial. Secret time four also, yogi mind's power trained, sleep familiarity crucial. Thatness time four, body speech mind by gathered, clear light great sleep joined, thus familiarized three bodies certainly joined, yogi!"

A meditator spent years trying to "achieve" clear light. He forced his channels, strained his winds, chased the experience like a hunter after a shadow. Finally, exhausted, he fell asleep in meditation. When he woke, clear light had been there all along—not achieved but recognized.

Four times equal joining—outer, inner, secret, thatness. Outer: hold the channels and winds continuously, day and night. Inner: cut through speech ornaments, rest in unfabricated naturalness. Secret: let mind rest in its own place, no contrivance. Thatness: the meeting of mother and child clear light. Four gates to the same palace.

The practice method in detail: Daytime appearances wide strike—appearances strike widely, penetrating vision. Evening sense bases place gather—senses gather at the heart at dusk. Midnight knowables vase place—knowables enter the vase of central channel at midnight. Dawn wisdom clear make—wisdom clears at dawn.

First, equipoise and post-attainment two. Equipoise: sleep joined, lion's manner—the lion sleeps with awareness, wind slowly held, eyes not closing, heart inside five lights ball mind held. Sleeping thus, outer appearances gradually going, sleep and dream gap, knowing thought-free clear certain existing—that is clear light. Recognize it. Not dull sleep—sleep is clear light appearing. No dream—knowing samadhi nature self-clear.

Mountain hermit watched the sun set behind the peaks for thirty years. Each evening, as light faded, he gathered his senses to his heart. Each midnight, his mind entered the central channel. Each dawn, wisdom cleared like mist from the valley. He never "achieved" anything—he simply recognized what was already happening.

The four times correspond to the dissolution process. Daytime—elements and consciousnesses fully manifest. Evening—sense consciousnesses begin gathering at the heart. Midnight—mind consciousness enters the central channel vase. Dawn—the clear light dawns as wisdom. This mirrors the death process, making sleep practice preparation for the bardo.

Sleep gone but nearby forms sounds smells not ceased—knowing continues. Not gone—the conditions from that nature waking. Day appearance from thought ceased merely, appearance aspect separate clear.

From Thalgyur: "Clear light transfer excellently, sleep samadhi trained by familiarity, day and night without distinction, outer appearances clear—this achieves great clear light." The six collections of consciousness cease but five door consciousnesses not ceased—clear. Mind consciousness dissolves into clear light, wind enters central channel. Five door consciousnesses thought-free so appearing objects not grasped—clear but non-conceptual clarity.

This wandering yogi once slept in a cave during a storm. Thunder crashed, lightning flashed, yet his sleep was undisturbed. In that deep sleep, clear light appeared—more vivid than the lightning, more present than the thunder. He understood: clear light is not separate from sleep. It is sleep's true nature.

At this time, bliss clear light exists in the samadhi of co-emergent bliss. Clarity clear light exists when day and night are joined in samadhi. Non-conceptual clear light exists when mind's grasping thought ceases.

Bliss clear light—unbearable to separate from samadhi, appearance of joy and bliss arises as experience. Clarity clear light—smoke, mirage, fireflies, clouds, lightning, flames, moon, sun, dark jewel forms, five lights appearing, thigle, deity forms, beings, fields many seen. Seeing through walls, leaving meditation room, walls and fences passing through ability, etc. Clairvoyance and many higher perceptions dawn.

Non-conceptual clear light—samadhi day-night joined, looking at whatever appears thought-free relaxed, any talk without duality goes thought-free, always dwelling in sky-like space experience immeasurable dawns. These are certain experiences, proven by valid cognition—profound crucial point.

The essence of the three clear lights: bliss without attachment to samadhi, clarity without fixation on visions, non-conceptuality without falling into blankness. The five lights are wind's clear light, external color clear light. From this, seeing one's own body's particles and internal organs, day and night appearing equally, seeing others' bodies inside, fields, lands, what beings do, death and birth—all appear.

Second, post-attainment: rising from equipoise. From that state rising, outer appearances appear as five lights forms, beings and trees appearing, view as eight magic examples, view as sky-like, mixing with whatever experience, training empty-clear appearance without grasping as one—this is the true crucial point.

At that time, immeasurable rainbow lights, thigle, body appearances dawn—they are the five winds' clear light, external color clear light.

Post-attainment integrates equipoise. The clear light recognized in sleep continues into waking. The five lights seen in meditation appear in daily life. The sky-like view pervades all activities. Integration is not losing recognition when rising from meditation—it is carrying the meditation into the world.

Second, evening sense bases gather at heart: sitting in vajra posture, from secret place to Brahma aperture, inside central channel white A like stacked dongtshe, all gradually dissolving one into one, finally all placed in sky space.

Third, midnight knowables enter vase: sleeping in lion's manner, mind placed on five lights lamp inside heart.

Fourth, dawn wisdom clears: with lion's gaze upward, from crown to arrow-space's sky white A hovering, mind held there.

The white A dissolves. The knowables enter the vase. The wisdom clears. Body, speech, mind, clear light—all dissolve into space. Space dissolves into awareness. Awareness rests in recognition.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why make this so complicated? Four times, four joinings, four dissolutions! Meanwhile, clear light is present in every moment! Stop analyzing and recognize!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you prepare your bed, while you arrange your pillow, maintain the recognition that sleep is clear light. Daily life becomes the practice. The recognition while lying down matters as much as the recognition in meditation.

Final instruction: the four times are not stages to achieve. They are descriptions of what happens naturally. Your awareness already dissolves at evening, enters the vase at midnight, clears at dawn. Just recognize what's already happening. That's the whole teaching.

Emaho! The wonder of clear light already present, spontaneously abiding, never separate from awareness. May all beings recognize their nature as clear light, day and night without distinction.
