Fourth—self-appearance realized, true power obtained.

When appearances are recognized as self-appearance, when the display is known as one's own display, then true power is obtained. Not power over others. Not power to manipulate. The power of recognition—the power that needs no demonstration.

This old fool once sought power through force, through dominance, through control. He gained nothing but exhaustion. When he recognized self-appearance—when he saw that all phenomena were his own mind's display—then true power dawned. Not the power to change things, but the power to rest unchanged.

Three words. Self. Power. Rest. The self recognizes appearances as self. The power of that recognition is obtained. Rest in that power—not using it, not displaying it, just resting.

Mountain hermit on his cliff understood: the eagle doesn't demonstrate its power. It simply flies. The lion doesn't prove its strength. It simply rests. True power needs no show.

Between the seeking of power and the recognition of self-appearance, we find the vast expanse. The power is not gained—it is recognized as never absent. Self-appearance is the power. Recognition is the rest.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why seek power externally? Your own appearances are your power! Recognition is strength! Stop seeking and own!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you walk, while you rest, remember—every appearance is self-appearance. Every moment is the display of your power. No need to demonstrate. Just be.

Final instruction: true power is not control. It is the recognition that there is nothing to control, no one to control, no control needed. Self-appearance realized—this is the only power. Rest in it.

Emaho! The wonder of self-appearance realized, true power obtained, spontaneously present from the beginning.
