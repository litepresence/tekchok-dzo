[14752] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Fourth, self-appearance realized, true power obtained.

[14752] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Self. Power. Stop. Self-appearance realized is the only true power. Not power over others, but power over delusion. This is the great power.

[Final] Fourth stage—self-appearance realized, true power obtained.

Emaho! The true power!

See what is. Rest in recognition.
