From the first, from the three—Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya—first, extensive explanation of Dharmakaya's abode has four: essence, divisions, enumerations, extensive explanation. The essence of Dharmakaya is self-arising pristine awareness, empty-clear, free from elaboration.

From five aspects—abiding mode, characteristics, nature, compassion, appearance-mode: Essence's abiding mode: Abiding unsullied by any flaw, primordially pure nature. That essence's characteristic: Empty, possessing the heart of awareness. That essence's nature: Not mixed with anything. That essence's compassion: Undivided, non-dividing, without division. That essence's appearance-mode: Without duality.

The definition is.

Don't make this abstract! This is describing your present moment of awareness. Unsullied by any problem—ever! Empty yet aware. Not mixed with thoughts or emotions. Compassion that doesn't need to divide subject from object. And it all appears without the duality of inside and outside, self and other. This isn't philosophy—this is your immediate experience when you stop grasping!

Listen carefully! Longchenpa is explaining how designation works. "From the dharmas of mere designation aspect, ripened as body, without substantial existence." This is subtle—don't miss it! The body appears, yes, but it's ripened from mere designation, not from some solid thing. Characteristics by which nothing is definitively established. Emptiness nowhere established—therefore called Dharmakaya!

This is the key point: Dharmakaya is not "something" that exists somewhere. It's the recognition that there's no solid, findable essence. Like trying to grasp a rainbow—you can't, yet it appears. This appearance without graspability is Dharmakaya!

Now the breakdown: Dharma means unstained dharmas of the Buddha ground, connected with awareness. Body means without marks, faces, or hands, merely spoken of as the essence of unchanging awareness. Don't look for a Buddha-form in Dharmakaya! No arms, no legs, no ornaments—just the naked fact of awareness itself, unchanging, ungraspable, yet vividly present.

[1-27]
Divisions: Three Dharmakayas related to essence-characteristics, all-pervading abiding, and appearance-modes of divisions. First: With reference to suchness, nowhere established as any essence, free from elaboration extremes.

[Final]
This completes the commentary. The treasury has been opened, the meaning revealed—not through analysis but through recognition. Rest in that.
