[8810-8816]
Behold—the spontaneous sound of awareness, self-arisen, self-liberated. Not fabricated, not sought: this very sound resounds without a source.

Elaborate? It is the play of unborn emptiness.
Unelaborate? The same play, naturally free.
Very unelaborate? Awareness recognizing itself in every echo.
Utterly unelaborate? Neither sound nor silence—pure recognition, naked and immediate.

Do you hear it? This is not hearing with ears.

The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

[8817-8822]
The person capable of recognition enters thus: appearances not cut, naturally pure. Consciousness not ceased—self-liberated upon arising.

Outer: wind-mind, father-mother—all are the spontaneous display of awareness.
Inner: body-wheel, channel-difference—your own nature, naturally perfect.
Secret: lamp four appearances—self-showing, self-recognized.
Unsurpassed: no face to show, no path to clear—recognition itself is the four certainties.

Thus. The analysis. The framework reveals: awareness is not somewhere else. It is this very recognizing.

[8823-8829]
Second, showing the spontaneous ripening: When recognition dawns, ripening-appearance—pure and impure, sky and space—all included in awareness. Desire-destruction dwell in three times—all included in this instant of recognition.

Body, speech, mind—this very recognition liberates. Samsara-Nirvana—conditioned and unconditioned become one in recognition.

Appearance-control: aggregates, elements, sense-sources—spontaneously pure, never stained.
Existence-control: afflictions—self-liberated in their own ground.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

[8830-8834]
Recognition enters through body, speech, mind, consciousness—action spontaneously shows.
Elaborate recognition: obtain, dwell, stabilize, near-realize—four aspects of one taste.
Very unelaborate: body, speech, mind, consciousness—fourfold bliss of natural awareness.
Utterly unelaborate: three doors, deity body-speech-mind—beyond expression, beyond dwelling.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[8835-8840]
Third, the nature of recognition—fourfold spontaneous perfection:
The field is good: awareness itself, stainless and vast.
The seed faultless: recognition, never separate from you.
Elaborate recognition planted, unelaborate sprout arises.
Very unelaborate: the flower of awareness shines.
Utterly unelaborate: four kayas certain—this is the ripened result.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

This old wanderer heard the spontaneous sound in dark retreat. At first, silence. Then a hum. Then the hum became everything—the wind, the breathing, the heartbeat, the thoughts. All sound, one awareness.

The recognition is not in the sound. The recognition is in the hearing. But who is hearing?

When you hear the wind, is the wind outside or inside? When you hear your own mind, is the mind inside or outside? The sound and the hearer are not two. This is the spontaneous sound—awareness hearing itself.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

This is the key: awareness recognizing itself. Not awareness looking at something. Not awareness looking at itself. Just awareness. This is the spontaneous sound.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Between the view and its object, recognition arises naturally, like sun appearing from behind clouds.
