Behold—the spontaneous sound of awareness, self-arisen, self-liberated. Not fabricated, not sought: this very sound resounds without a source.

Elaborate? It is the play of unborn emptiness.
Unelaborate? The same play, naturally free.
Very unelaborate? Awareness recognizing itself in every echo.
Utterly unelaborate? Neither sound nor silence—pure recognition, naked and immediate.

Do you hear it? This is not hearing with ears.

Recognition is immediate liberation, never gradual.

The person capable of recognition enters thus: appearances not cut, naturally pure. Consciousness not ceased—self-liberated upon arising.

Outer: wind-mind, father-mother—all are the spontaneous display of awareness.
Inner: body-wheel, channel-difference—your own nature, naturally perfect.
Secret: lamp four appearances—self-showing, self-recognized.
Unsurpassed: no face to show, no path to clear—recognition itself is the four certainties.

In this way: The analysis. The framework reveals: awareness is not somewhere else. It is this very recognizing.

Second, showing the spontaneous ripening: When recognition dawns, ripening-appearance—pure and impure, sky and space—all included in awareness. Desire-destruction dwell in three times—all included in this instant of recognition.

Body, speech, mind—this very recognition liberates. Samsara-Nirvana—conditioned and unconditioned become one in recognition.

Appearance-control: aggregates, elements, sense-sources—spontaneously pure, never stained.
Existence-control: afflictions—self-liberated in their own ground.

What seems to block the way IS the way, seen differently.

Recognition enters through body, speech, mind, consciousness—action spontaneously shows.
Elaborate recognition: obtain, dwell, stabilize, near-realize—four aspects of one taste.
Very unelaborate: body, speech, mind, consciousness—fourfold bliss of natural awareness.
Utterly unelaborate: three doors, deity body-speech-mind—beyond expression, beyond dwelling.

No key needed for an unlocked door—finished before starting.

Third, the nature of recognition—fourfold spontaneous perfection:
The field is good: awareness itself, stainless and vast.
The seed faultless: recognition, never separate from you.
Elaborate recognition planted, unelaborate sprout arises.
Very unelaborate: the flower of awareness shines.
Utterly unelaborate: four kayas certain—this is the ripened result.

Concepts fall away; what remains is mind's nature displaying itself.

I heard the spontaneous sound in dark retreat. At first, silence. Then a hum. Then the hum became everything—the wind, the breathing, the heartbeat, the thoughts. All sound, one awareness.

The recognition is not in the sound. The recognition is in the hearing. But who is hearing?

When you hear the wind, is the wind outside or inside? When you hear your own mind, is the mind inside or outside? The sound and the hearer are not two. This is the spontaneous sound—awareness hearing itself.

The sorter gets sorted—seeing this is the teaching.

This is the key: awareness recognizing itself. Not awareness looking at something. Not awareness looking at itself. Just awareness. This is the spontaneous sound.

Obstacles exist only for the one who thinks they need to overcome them.

The one seeking liberation is already liberated—just see clearly.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Between the view and its object, recognition arises naturally, like sun appearing from behind clouds.
