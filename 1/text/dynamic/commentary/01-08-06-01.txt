The dispute: Those who say the view "follows as an eighth ground." The response: One recognizes primordial purity and unceasing display to be non-dual, thus one does not wish to turn away from the gathering of the seven aspects. Therefore, there is no fault of following as an eighth ground.

Moreover, this does not contradict "one's own face is primordially pure"—because one recognizes the essence to be primordially pure, there is connection.

The second dispute: Those who say primordial purity and unceasing display are non-dual in one's own face. The response addresses their concern: If the essence were exclusively primordially pure without spontaneous presence, samsara would not exist as other than purity, making sentient beings' confusion impossible. However, because primordial purity and spontaneous presence are non-dual, there is no contradiction.

The debate dissolves when we see that primordial purity (emptiness) and spontaneous presence (display) are not separate. They do not change separately or contradict—just as being a vow-holder and being fully ordained complement each other.

The essence is primordially pure from the first, so sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable as real existence. The stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted in the nature. Because the nature is spontaneously accomplished with all qualities, that also appears as play without ceasing.

The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual. The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.
