Analysis proceeds. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

This mountain dweller. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[10779-10781]
See your own face. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[10781-10781]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: The critics sharpen their swords! If primordial purity and spontaneous presence are non-dual in one's own face, they cry, then each position carries its own fault! If the essence were exclusively primordially pure without spontaneous presence, since samsara would not exist as other than purity, it would be unreasonable for sentient beings' confusion to ever arise! The ground of delusion would be removed, making delusion impossible!

[10775-10775]
This very knot—look closely. Is there anything truly binding?

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[10775-10775]
Thus. We proceed. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[10775-10775]
This old hermit tells a story: A man dreams he is bound with ropes. He struggles all night, trying to escape. Upon waking, he finds no ropes, no bondage, no escape needed. Was his struggle real? In the dream, yes. Upon waking, no. Samsara is like this dream. The ropes of delusion never truly bound the dreamer. Liberation is not a future achievement but present recognition.

[10775-10775]
Between bondage and liberation, the vast middle way opens. When appearing as liberated into the expanse of space, from that time appearing as reverted is merely reversion without new arising, because liberation newly arising and bondage are not established as real entities. The ball thrown by a child returns to the hand naturally. No new ball is created; no old ball is destroyed. The appearance of bondage and liberation is the play of spontaneous presence within the essence that was never bound.

[10775-10775]
Voice 20 proclaims: Moreover, from the conventional aspect of appearance as spontaneous presence with all qualities, from the ultimate aspect of emptiness as primordially pure, it is merely expressed in words—beyond word and concept. Because those two—primordial purity and spontaneous presence—are not separate substances, they do not change separately or contradict. Just as being a vow-possessor and being fully ordained do not contradict but complement each other in the path.

[10775-10775]
Those are also the dispute-answers establishing non-duality. From the Klongdrukpa tantra: Because the essence itself is primordially pure from the first, sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable as real existence. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted in the nature (rang bzhin). Thus spoke the Teacher, O great bodhisattva. Because the nature (rang bzhin) is spontaneously accomplished with all qualities, that also appears as play without ceasing in the field.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was. The bodhisattva himself also asked the Teacher for clarification: If the nature (rang bzhin) itself is spontaneous accomplishment complete, are these sentient beings reasonably self-liberated without effort? The Teacher responded: Because primordially spontaneously accomplished from the beginning. He spoke in response: These sentient beings, because the essence is primordially pure without stain, liberations also appear as play without contradiction.

[10775-10775]
Accordingly. The analysis. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[10775-10775]
Voice 20 proclaims: The Teacher's silence between words is the true teaching. The spoken words are invitations to silence. Don't cling to the invitation. Attend the feast of recognition where words have never been.

[10775-10775]
In this manner. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[10775-10775]
This old hermit offers final word: The debate is over. The dispute is dissolved. What remains is recognition. Rest in that, and all questions answer themselves.
