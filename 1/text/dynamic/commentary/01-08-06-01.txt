[10775-10781] First, regarding two disputes. The dispute: view "follows as eighth ground." The response: primordial purity and unceasing display non-dual, thus not turning away from seven aspects gathering. No fault of following.

[10775-10781] They say "eighth ground" like it's an achievement! This old man says—grounds are not stages to climb. Primordial purity is not ground one, and unceasing display is not ground eight. They're simultaneous.

[10775-10781] Therefore. Thus. Dispute analysis: brgyad pa'i sa brten accusation vs. ka dag lhun grub dbyer med response. Precise position: seven aspects gathering not rejected.

[10775-10781] Eighth ground! What ground? The numbering is mind-made! The ground is groundless! See through the enumeration!

[10775-10781] Three words. Dispute. Response. Rest. Both complete. The dispute arises from not seeing. The response arises from seeing. Rest in that.

[10775-10781] The accusation misses the point. Dzogchen points to the ground preceding all paths. Not higher—not lower—different dimension.

[10775-10781] Thus resolved. Not by proving superiority but clarifying unique position. Not path but ground. Not attainment but recognition.
