First: two disputes. First dispute—accusation that view "follows as eighth
ground" (sa brgyad). The response: primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous
presence (lhun grub) non-dual (dbyer med), thus not turning away from seven
aspects gathering. No fault of following.

[10777-10784]
A simple practitioner... laughs at "eighth ground" like it's achievement! Grounds are
not stages to climb. Primordial purity not ground one, spontaneous presence
not ground eight. Simultaneous, not sequential. The accusation assumes paths;
dzogchen reveals ground.

[10779-10786]
Dispute analysis precise: brgyad pa'i sa brten accusation vs. ka dag lhun
grub dbyer med response. Seven aspects gathering (gzi bdun 'du ba) not
rejected—transcended. Dzogchen doesn't reject lower grounds; Waves rise and fall—the rising points to falling, both point to water.
what precedes all grounds.

[10781-10788]
Dispute arises. Response clarifies. Rest resolves. Three words, but really
just: See through.

[10783-10790]
Eighth ground! What ground? Numbering is mind-made! Ground is groundless!
See through enumeration! Not higher, not lower—different dimension entirely.
Accusation misses: dzogchen Contours indicate height, but lines don't climb. ground preceding paths.

[10785-10792]
Rang ngo ka nas dag pa—one's own face pure from the beginning. Essence
primordially pure, thus related. The response: not rejecting, but including
all grounds in single recognition. Not attainment but recognition.

[10787-10794]
Thus resolved. Not by proving superiority but clarifying unique position.
Not path but ground. Not higher ground but groundless ground. Rest in that.
