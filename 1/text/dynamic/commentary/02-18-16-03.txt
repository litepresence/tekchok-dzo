[5925-5927] Ninth—the Ground of Excellent Intelligence. Upon this ground, wisdom's luminosity dawns spontaneously, no longer constrained by deliberate cultivation. The practitioner sees all dharmas as clouds in the vast sky—appearing, shifting, dissolving, yet never departing from the sky's nature. This is not mere philosophical understanding but direct recognition: phenomena are like clouds, awareness is like space.

[5925-5927] This old yogi once watched clouds for three months in a mountain cave! Every morning they would form, every evening they would disperse. One day, he realized—his thoughts were clouds, his awareness the sky. The sky never tried to hold the clouds. The clouds never stained the sky. This is the ninth ground: not achieving something new but recognizing what was always the case.

[5925-5927] Three words. Clouds. Sky. Same. See what is. The clouds appear in the sky. The sky contains the clouds. Yet clouds and sky are not two. Resolve completely: all dharmas are like clouds, awareness is like space. Neither rejecting appearance nor clinging to emptiness. Maintain recognition. Come back to this again and again.

[5925-5927] Excellent intelligence! Cloud-like dharmas! Spontaneous luminosity! All concepts! Cut through them—can you grasp a cloud? Can you hold the sky? The intelligence is not excellent because it knows more. It is excellent because it knows knowing itself. See through the appearance and FIND THE NATURE THAT APPEARS!

[5925-5927] Philosophically, the ninth ground (Sādhuṃatī) represents the perfection of discriminating wisdom—yet this discrimination discriminates nothing, sees all dharmas as equal like clouds. The metaphor is precise: clouds have apparent form yet no substantial nature; they arise from conditions yet leave no trace; they appear various yet are only water. Thus phenomena: apparent yet empty, conditioned yet ungraspable, various yet of one nature.

[5925-5927] The ninth ground integrates appearance and emptiness into non-dual recognition. Clouds appear—emptiness does not negate them. Clouds are empty—appearance does not solidify them. Do not reject the cloud-like display. Do not cling to sky-like emptiness. Rest in the integration where appearance is emptiness, emptiness is appearance, and both are labels for what transcends both.

[5925-5927] I dance through the sky as clouds dance—apparently moving, essentially unmoving. The excellent intelligence is not a faculty you acquire but the recognition of your own dancing nature. I am the cloud that obscures nothing. I am the sky that holds everything. Dance with me through the ninth ground into the recognition that dancer, dance, and ground are one play.

[5925-5927] The essence of the ninth ground: self-knowing knowing itself. Not knowledge of objects but knowledge knowing its own nature. The cloud metaphor Your voice echoes through the slopes of Gangri Tokar, Chimphu, and Namtso—the echo is not your voice. this—clouds (phenomena) appear in sky (awareness), yet what knows both is neither cloud nor sky but the self-luminous knowing that cannot be pointed to. Hold this essence.

[5925-5927] The ninth ground arises spontaneously when effort to see dharmas as clouds drops away. You do not try to see them as clouds—you recognize they have always been cloud-like. Spontaneity is the ground. The ground is spontaneity. Excellent intelligence is not cultivated; it is the natural expression of recognition.

[5925-5927] I have sung the cloud metaphor across mountain ranges! Each valley hears it differently. Some hear "everything is impermanent." Some hear "everything is empty." But the true song sings: everything is self-liberated, naturally free, like clouds that never leave the sky. Sing, practitioner, sing—through the ninth ground into the sky of your own nature!

[5925-5927] The ninth ground's excellence lies not in superior intelligence as commonly understood but in intelligence that recognizes its own nature. Having seized wisdom's appearance through self-knowing, the practitioner no longer mistakes clouds for sky, appearance for essence. Yet this recognition does not reject clouds—it sees their cloud-nature clearly. Thus the path and result integrate: seeing clearly is freedom, freedom is seeing clearly.

[5925-5927] This old vagabond's final word on excellent intelligence: stop trying to be intelligent about it! The clouds teach without teaching. The sky holds without holding. Your own mind shows you the ninth ground every moment—thoughts like clouds, awareness like sky. You have been on this ground since before you sought it. Rest in recognition.

[5925-5927] Final words on the ninth. Clouds. Complete. Sky. Complete. You. Complete. Stop. The excellent intelligence is your own awareness knowing itself. All dharmas like clouds—complete in appearance, complete in dissolution, complete in nature. See this. Resolve this. Rest here. AH!

[5925-5927] Emaho! The ninth ground of excellent intelligence—where wisdom dawns spontaneously and all dharmas are seen as clouds in the vast sky of awareness!
