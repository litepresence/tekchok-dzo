If at mountain-plain border, wish-fulfilling tree waist broken—this too experts distinguish. This is the treasury's heart.

Concepts fall away; what remains is mind's nature displaying itself.

Understanding misses it; recognition sees what concepts cannot hold. Ocean water's film

From your own heart center, light rays shoot forth and connect with the hearts of all these deities This is the treasury's heart.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The divider is divided—seeing this is the teaching.

. Like a mother embracing her child, the outer lights dissolve into your heart center Recognition is immediate.

Confusion and clarity are not two—just recognition and its absence wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[Final]
What was spoken here is the unspeakable nature. The words are offered; the recognition is yours. The treasury is complete.
