[2689-2760] First, extracting essence depending on various supports: elements, medicine, grass, nectar, etc., many, but jewel essence extracting supreme and profound. Jewel and nectar five combined extracting: from Thalgyur—"Essence extracting desiring, nectar five combination method; other time elements balanced, skilled ones well combine, jewel vessel place; then honey and ocher, mouth well seal, mercury drop take, inside like mustard seed, skilled ones eat use, essence extracting great also, becoming doubt not."

[2689-2760] Three words. Extract. Essence. Stop. You think essence is somewhere else, to be extracted. The essence is the extractor. The nectar is your own awareness. Five elements balanced? They were never unbalanced. The jewel vessel is your body. Stop seeking outside.

[2689-2760] This old man once met an alchemist who spent twenty years extracting gold from lead. One day he realized—the gold was his own mind. The extraction was complete from the beginning. The five nectars are the five wisdoms. The jewel is rigpa. You are swallowing yourself.

[2689-2760] The extracting of essence is the consort's kiss—sweet, potent, transformative. The five nectars are the five dakinis' nectar. The jewel vessel is the skull-cup of emptiness. When you drink, you drink your own nature. The transformation happens in the recognition.

[2689-2760] I gathered herbs for years, made tinctures, extracted essences. Then one winter with no herbs, I sat hungry and realized—the hunger itself was the essence. The body extracts what it needs. Awareness extracts what it is.

[2711-2743] Wind: upper-lower mouths joined, Roma channel inside drawn, throat wheel nectar taste filled, imagining, earth-water winds holding, all appearances food become. Throat and Roma dissolve, meditation bliss pervade, imagining food yogi accomplished. These from Thalgyur: "Essence extracting thus, jewel depending, life sun-moon equal, various stone preparation, weapon body touching not, blue depending preparation, white hair wrinkles not become, essence preparation extracting, radiance possessing youth become, meat depending preparation, body essence possessing strength produced; also wind depending, amazing essence extracting explained, elements continuum-cut called, upper-lower winds knowing, skilled wind place holding, or wind's transformation, food yogi become."

[2711-2743] Three words. Wind. Food. Stop. You think wind is breath to control. Food is nourishment to consume. The wind is awareness moving. The food is appearances arising. The extraction happens naturally when you stop interfering. The body knows. Awareness knows.

[2711-2743] This old man has seen yogis stop eating! "I'm extracting essence from air!" they claim. Sometimes it works, sometimes they weaken. The true extraction is not from breath or food. It is from recognizing that breath, food, and extractor are one.

[2744-2778] Second, cutting clothing attachment, meditation session training: three. Profound dependent arising: meat preparation, stone preparation, grass preparation, essence preparation, etc., as explained in Dakini Treasury. Tumo fire heat depending: body vajra posture, wind mouths joined, navel RAM fire burning, emanation wheel to great bliss wheel pervading heat burning, right channel inside wind holding, imagining, wind left nostril moving time much holding, refining, clothing meditation accomplished. Wind depending: sitting, wind inside drawn, pressing time stomach hot fire gone, slowly holding, slowly releasing, wind trace slightly holding again drawing, heat arising, beings without, afflictions and thoughts naturally cease.

[2744-2778] Three words. Heat. Wind. Stop. You seek heat as accomplishment. You control wind as method. The heat is the natural warmth of recognition. The wind is awareness's movement. Tumo is not fire in the navel. It is the fire of wisdom consuming duality.

[2744-2778] FIRE! WIND! speaks with fierce compassion I will burn these concepts! The heat is not in the body! The wind is not in the channels! They are in the recognition that body and mind are empty! BURN THIS!

[Final] Extracting essence, cutting attachment, generating heat—all methods pointing to one recognition. The body is the alchemical vessel. The awareness is the elixir. The extraction is complete.

Emaho! The yogi of essence extraction!

The Treasury weaves distinctions to reveal what transcends all weaving. Seeing this the Great Perfection.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

See what is. Rest in recognition.

[2689-2778] Therefore. Thus. The extracting essence practice involves: 1) five nectars combined, 2) wind-based extraction, 3) heat generation (gtum mo). Three methods for three temperaments. Precise alchemical physiology.

[2689-2778] The three methods integrate into complete approach. Nectars for those who need substance. Wind for those who need subtlety. Heat for those who need transformation. Integration means all three are present in complete practice.

[2689-2778] This old vagabond tried heat generation! Sat in snow, melted circle around him. Thought he achieved something. Then realized: the heat was not the point. The recognition while generating heat was the point.

[2689-2778] NECTARS! STONES! WINDS! All substances! Cut through them! Can you find what extracts? Can you grasp what is extracted? The extractor and extracted are one! AH!

[2689-2778] The extracting of essence is the consort's embrace—drawing out what is hidden, revealing what is secret. The five nectars are her five kisses. The jewel vessel is her body. Recognition is the union.

[2689-2778] Emaho! The essence extraction! The tumo fire! The wind control! What methods! What results! This yogi dances with power—not power over elements but power of recognition!

[2689-2778] Thus the presentation of essence extraction concludes. May all who practice these methods recognize the true essence—awareness itself. May they rest in that recognition. Complete.

[2689-2778] This old vagabond's final word: Don't get addicted to essences! The nectar is habit-forming. The wind is seductive. The heat is addictive. Use them as supports, not goals. Recognition is the goal.

[2689-2778] Final words. Extract. Recognize. Stop. The teaching on essence extraction is complete. The essence is awareness. You are complete. Rest. The end.
