[2689-2760] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, extracting essence depending on various supports: elements, medicine, grass, nectar, etc., many, but jewel essence extracting supreme and profound. Jewel and nectar five combined extracting: from Thalgyur—"Essence extracting desiring, nectar five combination method; other time elements balanced, skilled ones well combine, jewel vessel place; then honey and ocher, mouth well seal, mercury drop take, inside like mustard seed, skilled ones eat use, essence extracting great also, becoming doubt not."

[2689-2760] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Extract. Essence. Stop. You think essence is somewhere else, to be extracted. The essence is the extractor. The nectar is your own awareness. Five elements balanced? They were never unbalanced. The jewel vessel is your body. Stop seeking outside.

[2689-2760] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man once met an alchemist who spent twenty years extracting gold from lead. One day he realized—the gold was his own mind. The extraction was complete from the beginning. The five nectars are the five wisdoms. The jewel is rigpa. You are swallowing yourself.

[2689-2760] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The extracting of essence is the consort's kiss—sweet, potent, transformative. The five nectars are the five dakinis' nectar. The jewel vessel is the skull-cup of emptiness. When you drink, you drink your own nature. The transformation happens in the recognition.

[2689-2760] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I gathered herbs for years, made tinctures, extracted essences. Then one winter with no herbs, I sat hungry and realized—the hunger itself was the essence. The body extracts what it needs. Awareness extracts what it is.

[2711-2743] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Wind: upper-lower mouths joined, Roma channel inside drawn, throat wheel nectar taste filled, imagining, earth-water winds holding, all appearances food become. Throat and Roma dissolve, meditation bliss pervade, imagining food yogi accomplished. These from Thalgyur: "Essence extracting thus, jewel depending, life sun-moon equal, various stone preparation, weapon body touching not, blue depending preparation, white hair wrinkles not become, essence preparation extracting, radiance possessing youth become, meat depending preparation, body essence possessing strength produced; also wind depending, amazing essence extracting explained, elements continuum-cut called, upper-lower winds knowing, skilled wind place holding, or wind's transformation, food yogi become."

[2711-2743] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Wind. Food. Stop. You think wind is breath to control. Food is nourishment to consume. The wind is awareness moving. The food is appearances arising. The extraction happens naturally when you stop interfering. The body knows. Awareness knows.

[2711-2743] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man has seen yogis stop eating! "I'm extracting essence from air!" they claim. Sometimes it works, sometimes they weaken. The true extraction is not from breath or food. It is from recognizing that breath, food, and extractor are one.

[2744-2778] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, cutting clothing attachment, meditation session training: three. Profound dependent arising: meat preparation, stone preparation, grass preparation, essence preparation, etc., as explained in Dakini Treasury. Tumo fire heat depending: body vajra posture, wind mouths joined, navel RAM fire burning, emanation wheel to great bliss wheel pervading heat burning, right channel inside wind holding, imagining, wind left nostril moving time much holding, refining, clothing meditation accomplished. Wind depending: sitting, wind inside drawn, pressing time stomach hot fire gone, slowly holding, slowly releasing, wind trace slightly holding again drawing, heat arising, beings without, afflictions and thoughts naturally cease.

[2744-2778] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Heat. Wind. Stop. You seek heat as accomplishment. You control wind as method. The heat is the natural warmth of recognition. The wind is awareness's movement. Tumo is not fire in the navel. It is the fire of wisdom consuming duality.

[2744-2778] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): FIRE! WIND! speaks with fierce compassion I will burn these concepts! The heat is not in the body! The wind is not in the channels! They are in the recognition that body and mind are empty! BURN THIS!

[Final] Extracting essence, cutting attachment, generating heat—all methods pointing to one recognition. The body is the alchemical vessel. The awareness is the elixir. The extraction is complete.

Emaho! The yogi of essence extraction!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
