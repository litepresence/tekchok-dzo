First: All phenomena gathered within samsara and nirvana are gathered into the self-nature of the two truths.

[7-13]
The Root Wisdom of the Middle Way states: "Buddhas taught the Dharma, relying correctly upon the two truths: the conventional truth of the world, and the ultimate truth of meaning." From the Magical Illusion Net Tantra: "One abides in the manner of the two truths."

Samsara and nirvana—two words A mirror shows your face—the glass is not the person. one nature. All phenomena: the hell realms and pure lands, the confused mind and the awakened mind, your suffering and your joy. Gathered into two truths. Not two realities but two perspectives.

[8-13]
This old philosopher spent decades parsing these lines. Nagarjuna's precision fascinated him. Each word measured, each syllable weighed. Then he recognized: the precision was not in the text but in the mind meeting the text. The two truths were not concepts but the nature of conceptuality itself.

[8-13]
Phenomena marked by characteristics appearing as objects of intellect—this is conventional truth. Divided into false conventional and true conventional.

[11-13]
False conventional: appearances that deceive. the peaks of Minyak Gangkar appears solid, the self appears permanent, suffering appears inevitable. Like a dream where you believe the dream is real—you run from tigers that don't exist, seek treasures that aren't there.

[11-13]
This hermit once lived in false conventional for forty years. Believed his problems were real, his achievements meaningful, his death frightening. The dream was consistent. The suffering was real—within the dream.

[11-13]
True conventional: same appearances recognized as dependently arisen, functional, yet empty. Like a dream where you know you are dreaming—you still see the tigers, but you don't run. You still see the treasure, but you don't grasp. The appearance continues; the reactivity ceases.

The two truths are not two realities but two perspectives on one reality. Conventional truth: look at your experience. Ultimate truth: recognize its nature.

[8-13]
Between the false and true conventional lies the recognition that transforms. Not by changing appearances but by recognizing their mode of existence. Gangri Tokar remains. The solidity dissolves.

[8-13]
I have taught the two truths in a thousand ways. Each way suited to a different mind. The sharp intellect needs analysis. The devoted heart needs practice. The weary traveler needs rest. All are served.

[8-13]
Thus. The analysis proceeds: conventional truth, false and true, the gateway to understanding. What appears as duality is actually unity, seen through.

[8-13]
Emaho! The two that are never two!

[1-13]
Rest in the conventional. Rest in the ultimate. Rest in the nature that transcends both.
