First: All phenomena gathered within samsara and nirvana are gathered into the self-nature of the two truths.

The Root Wisdom (Mūlamadhyamakakārikā) states: "Buddhas taught the Dharma, relying correctly upon the two truths: the conventional truth of the world, and the ultimate truth of meaning."

From the Magical Illusion Net Tantra: "One abides in the manner of the two truths."

Phenomena marked by characteristics appearing as objects of intellect—conventional truth. Divided into false conventional and true conventional—these two.

**False conventional:** Appearances that deceive—appear as inherently real, external objects. Like a dream where you believe the dream is real.

**True conventional:** Same appearances recognized as dependently arisen, functional, yet empty. Like a dream where you know you are dreaming.

The two truths are not two realities but two perspectives on one reality. Conventional truth: look at your experience. Ultimate truth: recognize its nature. Two fingers pointing to one moon.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.
