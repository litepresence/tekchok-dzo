[3057-3120] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, dream practice time not held and not mastered, held and mastered crucial point. Whatever practiced mutually reverse order stirred, widespread trained, mastering easy. Also four wheels' places wind and mind placed, sequence stirred, accomplishing. Pressing: body posture lion's manner, channels pressing, throat mind hidden, focus pressing, other thoughts not distracted, sleeping, dream pressing. Crucial point placed: aspiration fierce instruction crucial point hit, sleeping time throat center red AH white lotus four-petals center imagined, channels waves pressed, that nature sleeping, dream arising crucial point, other than this profound not existing.

[3057-3120] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Stir. Press. Stop. You think practice needs order. The stirring is the recognition that order and disorder are mind's play. The pressing is not force. It is the natural seal of recognition. The lion's posture is not physical. It is the dignity of awareness.

[3057-3120] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man once pressed too hard! Thought force would bring results. Got headaches, not liberation. Then learned—pressing is like holding a bird. Too tight, it dies. Too loose, it flies. Just right, it rests. The throat visualization is the seal, not the squeezing.

[3057-3120] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The four wheels are the four consorts' dance. Stirring the sequence is their wild movement. Pressing the channels is their embrace. The AH at the throat is the bindu of clear light—red for method, white for wisdom, together at the center.

[3057-3120] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): STIR! PRESS! speaks with fierce compassion These are not techniques! The stirring is awareness moving! The pressing is awareness still! The lion does not practice posture! The lion IS posture! BE THE LION!

[3072-3115] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Third, channels-winds binding crucial point: dream time always important companion. Also wind bindu net placing crucial point, lion's sleeping manner, wind slowly releasing, appearance existence samsara-nirvana all, own nose mindfulness wheel dissolving, imagining. Wind inside held, crown HAM bindu descending, all appearances bliss nature, heart mirror image like, focus placed, again again trained. All appearances throat wheel upward return, red AH one becoming, mind held, wind and clarity throat held, sleeping—this crucial point great secret.

[3072-3115] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Bind. Return. Stop. You bind the wind to control the dream. The binding is the recognition that wind and mind are one. The return to AH is the return to the nature. All appearances become one taste in the throat's red lotus.

[3072-3115] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The wind-bindu is the essence of dream practice. Not wind as breath, but wind as awareness-movement. Bind it at the throat, the place of transformation. The return upward is the recognition that all appearances are the display of rigpa.

[3116-3120] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thus crucial point bound, dream and habitual tendencies exhausted, delusion awakened. This time diligence great, focus all not completed also, dream ceasing possible; medium dream quickly held; lesser virtue habitual tendency become, finally ceasing. These also first dream many, finally few go; diligence great, first forgotten-rough dream mere; medium dream very clear; lesser unclear many arise.

[Final] Dream practice—training, transforming, cutting, binding. All methods point to one recognition: the dream is mind's display. Master the dream by recognizing the dreamer. Bind the winds by binding the mind. Return to AH, return to nature.

Emaho! The dream yogi's crucial points!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
