First, dream conduct: when dreams are not held and not mastered, there is a key point for holding and mastering them. Whatever visualizations are practiced, if stirred in reverse order and trained extensively, mastering becomes easy. Also, placing wind and mind at the four wheels' locations and stirring in sequence accomplishes this.

This uneducated yogi... once tried to control his dreams by force. Like trying to hold water in cupped hands, the harder he gripped, the more it slipped away. Only when he relaxed—like a glacier slowly releasing its hold on the gorges of Yarlung—did the dreams become workable.

Pressing: body posture in lion's manner, channels pressed, mind hidden at the throat, focus pressed. Without distraction to other thoughts, sleeping presses the dream. key point placed: with fierce aspiration, instruction hits the key point.

At sleeping time, at the center of the throat, imagine a red AH at the center of a white four-petaled lotus. Pressing the channels' waves, sleeping in that nature is the key point for dreams arising—nothing is deeper than this. That also: training, stirring, transforming, pressing, severing, and placing the essential point—combining these three is supremely essential.

Channels placed at the wheel—from stirring, pressing, and placing the essential point, three are explained. But here the key point is experienced as great, thus accomplished.

Third, the vital point of channels-winds binding: at dream time, always an important companion. That also: the essential point of placing wind-bindu in the net. At the time of lion's sleeping manner, wind slowly releasing, all appearances of existence, samsara-nirvana, dissolve into the nose mindfulness wheel—imagine thus.

This wandering yogi slept in caves for years. He learned that the breath is like a pilgrimage path—each inhalation a step toward recognition, each exhalation a step toward release. The path continues whether you notice it or not.

Holding wind inside, bindu descending from the crown HAM, all appearances become bliss-nature. At the heart, like a mirror's reflection, focus placed, trained again and again. All appearances return upward to the throat wheel, becoming one red AH. Mind held, wind and clarity held at the throat—sleeping. This key point is the great secret.

By thus binding the key point, dreams and latencies are exhausted to the end, confusion is liberated. At this time, with excellent diligence, even if all focus is not complete, dreams may cease. The medium quickly holds dreams. The inferior becomes virtuous latency, finally ceasing.

These also go from many dreams at first to few at the end. For the excellent, from the first, vague, barely remembered dreams. For the medium, extremely clear dreams. For the inferior, many unclear ones appear.

Mountain hermit near a high plateau lake watched his dreams change over twelve years. At first, vivid visions of cities and wealth. Then, dreams of practice and teaching. Finally, no dreams at all—just continuous awareness like the lake's surface reflecting stars. He had stopped dreaming and started recognizing.

These dream key points are instructions for transforming delusion into clear light. From the same source: "Whoever practices sleep yoga, this transforms delusion into the path."

Third, illusion body: making all appearance-existence into magical illusion yoga. Here there are two: training the illusion body as reflection during the day, and training the illusion body in dreams at night.

Between the day practice and night practice, there is no separation. Like a pilgrimage path that continues whether the sun shines or stars appear, the practice continues through all states. The yogi who recognizes this does not distinguish between waking and dreaming—both are the magical display of awareness.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why chase dreams? Why seek special experiences? The recognition you seek in dreams is present now, while reading these words. Stop waiting for sleep. Wake up now!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you prepare your evening meal, while you arrange your sleeping place, maintain the recognition that all is illusion. The blanket you pull over yourself, the pillow you rest upon—all magical display. Sleep in this recognition.

Final instruction: dreams are not escape from reality but deeper entry into it. Do not seek dreams. Seek the recognizer of dreams. Find that, and waking and dreaming merge into one continuous recognition. This is the key point of dream yoga.
