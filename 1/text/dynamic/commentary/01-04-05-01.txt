[2849-2854]
First: all phenomena including container world and contained beings arranged by intellect—false conventional. Appearance manifests as essence of object-delusion appearing as intellect's falseness. This is precise diagnosis of samsara's disease.

[2849-2872]
In this manner. 

Between the distinction and the distinguisher, vast space opens. No separation.

[2855-2859]
The false conventional has three marks: appears as external, functions causally, yet empty when analyzed. Like a reflection in mirror—clearly appearing, able to show your face, yet nothing there when sought. This is not nihilism. This is clear seeing.

[2860-2867]
Eight examples of illusion. Dream. Illusion. Gandharva city. These are not poetic metaphors. They are exact descriptions. Arising as non-existent yet clear-appearing. Thus they arise, thus they abide, thus they cease. The Treasury does not say phenomena are like illusions. It says they are illusions.

[2860-2872]


ROAR! Ground itself! Path never walked! Cut through seeking! NOW!

The journey translates into what was never foreign. Ground itself.

[2862-2872]
True conventional: though appearing deluded, acts as cause of blissful migration and liberation. Ten virtues. Collections of merit. Generosity. These are not false. They are functionally real. They produce results. Yet they are dependently arisen. Empty. Useful emptiness.

[2865-2872]
The eight examples are medicine. Not descriptions to memorize. Pointers to recognize. When you see all phenomena as dream, you are free from the dream. Not by waking up. By recognizing it is a dream while dreaming. This is the Great Perfection hidden in the Vehicle of Characteristics.

[2867-2872]
Like a dream: you experience it fully. You suffer in it. You rejoice in it. Yet nothing happened. Like an illusion: the magician creates appearance. The audience believes it. Both suffer and rejoice. Yet nothing was there. Same with all phenomena.

[2868-2872]
The true conventional is like a well-crafted boat. It floats. It carries you. It is empty inside. Its emptiness does not prevent it from functioning. Its functioning does not negate its emptiness. This is the middle way of the Vehicle of Characteristics.

[2870-2872]
Gandharva city in the sky—appearing clearly to thirsty travelers. They see towers, gardens, water. They run toward it. It recedes. They exhaust themselves. The city was never there. Yet it appeared. This is the false conventional. Appearing. Functional. Empty.
