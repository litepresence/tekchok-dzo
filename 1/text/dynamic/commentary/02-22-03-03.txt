[11182-11190] Then after three months, others see you in five-colored light, kayas of the five families rising into space and dissolving. This is the treasury's heart. The five-colored light—five wisdoms, five Buddha families. The kayas arise and dissolve into space. The dissolution is not ending—it is completion. Three months of practice, and others can see the signs. The light arises, the bodies manifest, then dissolve. This is the path of thodgal—the direct crossing.

[11182-11190] A simple practitioner... practiced for months. Others started seeing light around him. He didn't know what it meant. Then learned—these are signs of progress. Five colors, five families, rising and dissolving. The kayas of the five Buddha families appear to others. This is not ego inflation—this is the path working. Don't be proud of signs, but don't ignore them either.

[11182-11190] Three words. Signs. Light. Dissolve. The signs arise—five colors, five families. The light appears. The kayas dissolve. This is not something you do—it happens. Don't grasp the signs. Don't reject the signs. Let them arise and dissolve.

[11191-11200] Different combinations of signs lead to different liberations—in the bardo, as a nirmanakaya, or directly. Know these distinctions well. Like different streams flowing into the same ocean, all paths of recognition lead to buddhahood, yet the manner of arrival varies. The signs indicate the path. Different signs mean different destinations. Some lead to liberation in the bardo. Some lead to nirmanakaya rebirth. Some lead to direct liberation. Know the distinctions.

[11191-11200] The signs are not the goal—they are indicators. Don't grasp them. Don't reject them. Different signs mean different liberations. Some in bardo, some as nirmanakaya, some direct. The ocean is one—the streams are many. All lead to buddhahood.

[11201-11210] The supreme bodhisattva holds beings with compassion, remaining for hundreds of thousands of years in a single human body to perfect benefit for others. This is the great play of spontaneous presence. The bodhisattva doesn't vanish into nirvana. They remain in samsara to help beings. Hundreds of thousands of years in one human body. The compassion is spontaneous. The presence is great.

[11201-11210] The bodhisattva's vow: remain until all beings are freed. Not leaving for paradise. Staying in the world, in human form, helping. The great play of spontaneous presence—appears without effort, helps without grasping.

[11211-11220] Having signs does not mean liberation; liberation always has signs. Do not be deceived by ordinary spiritual attainments or gradual paths of shravakas and pratyekabuddhas—these are different grounds without the great pure result. Signs are not the same as liberation. But liberation always has signs. Don't be deceived by ordinary attainments. Don't grasp the shravaka path. It's a different ground, without the great pure result.

[11211-11220] Some think having spiritual experiences means liberation. Not so. Having signs is not the same as liberation. But liberation always has signs. The shravaka path—different ground, different result. Not the great purity of Dzogchen.

[11221-11230] One with complete body and speech signs dwells on the great sameness ground, then manifests for others' benefit for countless aeons in a single human body, perfecting enlightenment without intermediate births. Rest in this understanding. The complete signs—body and speech. The great sameness ground—equinimity. Manifest for others—nirmanakaya. Countless aeons, one body. No intermediate births—the direct path.

[11221-11230] Three words. Complete. Sameness. Manifest. Body signs and speech signs complete. The great sameness ground—dwelling in equality. Then manifesting for others—nirmanakaya, without intermediate births.

[11231-11240] Body and mind signs together bring swift self-liberation. Speech and mind signs bring rainbow body in ten years. All three signs complete bring Buddhahood in two years. Like a mighty river that gathers tributaries, combined signs create a torrent of realization. Body signs, mind signs together—swift self-liberation. Speech and mind signs—rainbow body in ten years. All three complete—buddhahood in two years.

[11231-11240] Two years to buddhahood—with all signs complete. Body, speech, mind—all signs together. The river gathers tributaries—mighty torrent of realization. But this is mere intellectual view and meditation. Such a person cannot liberate and will remain long in samsara.

[11241-11250] But for thodgal practitioners—without distinguished outer and inner signs, mere signs are uncertain. Do not deceive yourself claiming Dzogchen view while lacking genuine confidence in the natural state. A clay pot painted gold is still clay inside. Don't claim Dzogchen without genuine confidence. The signs must be real, not pretend. Gold paint on clay is still clay.

[11241-11250] The warning is clear: don't deceive yourself. Claims of Dzogchen view without real confidence are false. The signs must arise naturally. Without real recognition, it's just intellectual understanding. Clay painted gold—still clay.

[11251-11260] These signs arise as certain liberation without deception. Therefore exert special effort. One who matures space and awareness—how could these signs not arise? Apply yourself diligently. The signs are certain liberation. Don't be lazy. Mature space and awareness—the signs will arise. Diligence is needed.

[11251-11260] The signs arise when space and awareness mature. Don't force them—let them arise naturally. But apply effort. Diligence is essential. The signs are certain liberation.

[11261-11270] One who claims confidence without signs is merely intellectualizing. Such a person wanders long in samsara. But for thodgal practitioners who truly mature space and awareness, these signs arise inevitably. Claims without signs—just intellectualizing. Wandering in samsara. For real practitioners—the signs arise inevitably.

[11261-11270] Confidence without signs—the intellectual practitioner. Wanders in samsara. But genuine thodgal practitioners—signs arise inevitably. Space and awareness mature, signs appear.

[11271-11280] Signs of liberation and buddhahood versus signs of taking rebirth through the six realms' confusion. Two aspects: brief presentation and extensive explanation. Two kinds of signs: liberation signs and rebirth signs. Brief presentation and extensive explanation. Know the difference.

[11271-11280] Three words. Liberation. Rebirth. Signs. Signs of liberation versus signs of rebirth in the six realms. Brief and extensive—two ways of explaining.

[11281-11290] The brief: even if dharmata is realized directly, without sufficient effort one may not reach measure. When the material body separates, without taking further existence, one is liberated from contaminants. Brief presentation: direct realization of dharmata, but without effort, may not reach full measure. When body separates—liberated from contaminants.

[11281-11290] Direct realization but insufficient effort—may not reach completion. The body separates, liberation from contaminants. But more effort needed for full buddhahood.

[11291-11300] Two kinds of complete buddhahood: manifest complete buddhahood with signs, light, and material remains; and true complete buddhahood without aggregates' remainder through pure effort. Rest in this understanding. Two types: with signs, light, remains—or without aggregates, through pure effort. Both complete buddhahood.

[11291-11300] Complete buddhahood: manifest—with signs, light, material remains. Or true complete—without aggregates, pure effort. Both achieve full enlightenment.

[Final] The signs of thodgal practice: five-colored light, kayas of five families rising and dissolving. Different combinations lead to different liberations: bardo, nirmanakaya, direct. The supreme bodhisattva remains in human form for countless aeons, helping beings. Signs are not liberation—but liberation has signs. Don't be deceived by mere intellectual attainment. Complete signs—body, speech, mind—bring swift liberation. Two years to buddhahood with all signs complete. But don't deceive yourself—clay painted gold is still clay. For genuine practitioners, signs arise inevitably. Two kinds of complete buddhahood: with signs and remains, or without aggregates. The path is not walked—it is realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Then after three months, others see you in five-colored light. Kayas of the five families rising into space and dissolving. This is the treasury's heart. The five-colored light—five wisdoms, five Buddha families. The kayas arise and dissolve. Not ending—completion. Different combinations lead to different liberations: bardo, nirmanakaya, direct. Like streams flowing into ocean—all paths lead to buddhahood, manner varies. Supreme bodhisattva holds beings with compassion, remaining hundreds of thousands of years in single human body. The great play of spontaneous presence. Having signs is not liberation—but liberation always has signs. Don't be deceived by ordinary attainments or gradual paths of shravakas—different grounds without great pure result. Complete body and speech signs: dwell in great sameness ground, manifest for others' benefit countless aeons in one body, perfecting enlightenment without intermediate births. Body and mind signs together bring swift self-liberation. Speech and mind signs bring rainbow body in ten years. All three complete bring buddhahood in two years. But mere intellectual view and meditation cannot liberate—remain long in samsara. Without distinguished outer and inner signs, mere signs uncertain. Don't deceive yourself claiming Dzogchen view while lacking genuine confidence—clay painted gold is still clay. For thodgal practitioners who truly mature space and awareness, signs arise inevitably. One who claims confidence without signs is merely intellectualizing—wanders long in samsara. Two aspects: brief and extensive. Brief: even with direct dharmata realization, without sufficient effort may not reach measure. When material body separates, liberated from contaminants without further existence. Two complete buddhahoods: manifest with signs, light, material remains; and true complete without aggregates remainder through pure effort.

Emaho! The five-colored light! The kayas dissolving! The signs of liberation!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.

[11182-11300] Therefore. Thus. The sign system demonstrates precise phenomenology. Five colors correlate with five wisdoms. Body, speech, mind signs correlate with three dimensions of manifestation. Time frames (two years, ten years) correlate with integration completeness. Precise mapping of practice stages.

[11182-11300] The integration of signs and liberation: signs are not separate from liberation—they are its natural expression. Body signs integrate form. Speech signs integrate energy. Mind signs integrate awareness. Integration means all three are recognized as the same display.

[11182-11300] The essence beyond all signs: awareness recognizing itself. The five colors are awareness's play. The kayas are awareness's forms. The dissolution is awareness's nature. The recognition is awareness's function. Nothing else.

[11182-11300] Emaho! The signs! The light! The kayas! What beauty! What certainty! This yogi dances with joy—signs arise, signs dissolve, recognition remains!

[11182-11300] Thus concludes the presentation of signs and liberation. May all practitioners recognize signs as natural expression, not goals. May they rest in recognition whether signs arise or not. Complete.

[11182-11300] A simple practitioner...'s final word on signs: Don't chase them. Don't fear them. Don't be proud of them. Don't ignore them. Just recognize them as your own nature's display. Rest in that. Complete.

[11182-11300] Final words. Signs. Liberation. Same. Stop. The teaching on signs is complete. The signs are liberation's display. You are complete. Rest. The end.
