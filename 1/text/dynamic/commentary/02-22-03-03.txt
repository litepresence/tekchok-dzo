[11182-11182]
Then after three months, others see you in five-colored light, kayas of the five families rising into space and dissolving. This is the treasury's heart.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. This

[11183-11231]
is the great fortunate one reaching exhaustion! Different combinations of signs lead to different liberations—in the bardo, as a nirmanakaya, or directly. Know these distinctions well! Like different streams flowing into the same ocean, all paths of recognition lead to buddhahood, yet the manner of arrival varies.

The supreme bodhisattva

[11212-11231]
holds beings with compassion, remaining for hundreds of thousands of years in a single human body to perfect benefit for others. This is the great play of spontaneous presence!

Emaho!

[11232-11244]
. Having signs does not mean liberation; liberation always has signs. Do not be deceived by ordinary spiritual attainments or gradual paths of shravakas and pratyekabuddhas—these are different grounds without the great pure result.

One with complete body and speech signs

[11245-11264]
dwells on the great sameness ground, then manifests for others' benefit for countless aeons in a single human body, perfecting enlightenment without intermediate births. Rest in this understanding.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Body and mind signs together

[11265-11278]
bring swift self-liberation; speech and mind signs bring rainbow body in ten years; all three signs complete bring Buddhahood in two years! Like a mighty river that gathers tributaries, combined signs create a torrent of realization.

But listen

[11274-11283]
—this is mere intellectual view and meditation. Such a person cannot liberate and will remain long in samsara.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

But for thodgal practitioners

[11279-11291]
—without distinguished outer and inner signs, mere signs are uncertain. Do not deceive yourself claiming Dzogchen view while lacking genuine confidence in the natural state! A clay pot painted gold is still clay inside.

The text warns

[11284-11291]
, these signs arise as certain liberation without deception. Therefore exert special effort! One who matures space and awareness—how could these signs not arise? Apply yourself diligently!

Now the text summarizes

[11292-11310]
: one who claims confidence without signs is merely intellectualizing. Such a person wanders long in samsara. But for thodgal practitioners who truly mature space and awareness, these signs arise inevitably.

Emaho!

[11292-11310]
signs of liberation and buddhahood versus signs of taking rebirth through the six realms' confusion. Two aspects: brief presentation and extensive explanation.

The brief

[11311-11321]
: even if dharmata is realized directly, without sufficient effort one may not reach measure. When the material body separates, without taking further existence, one is liberated from contaminants.

[11318-11321]
: manifest complete buddhahood with signs, light, and material remains; and true complete buddhahood without aggregates' remainder through pure effort. Rest in this understanding.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.
