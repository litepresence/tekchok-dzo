Third tier: gods perpetually intoxicated. Honey wine flows like rivers here. But what is this intoxication? Not the stumble of loss, but the sway of those who have forgotten restraint. Their bliss is thick, heavy, cloying—like nectar that coats the tongue until taste itself fades. They drink the results of their merit, cup after cup, never sobering to ask: who fills the cup? The garland-gods below had ornaments. These gods have only the haze. From such heights, the fall is farther.

[999-1010]
An old practitioner once visited this tier in meditation. He found the gods dancing, singing, lost in the nectar of their own virtue. They offered him a cup. He looked at it and saw: the cup was empty. The wine was empty. The drinking was empty. The gods laughed at him, too intoxicated to understand. He bowed and moved on.

Stop searching. Start seeing. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Hence. The structure. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[1031-1040]
Between the intoxicated gods and the recognition that transcends all states, the path continues. Not rejecting the nectar. Not grasping it. The intoxication points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[1041-1050]
This hermit. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[1051-1060]
This binding—look closely. Is anything truly holding?.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[1081-1090]
An old practitioner once asked: "Where does the hangover end?" The answer came in a flash: nowhere. There was never any intoxication. The gods were never drunk. The nectar was never poured. The drinking was never done. All was awareness, playing at being intoxicated.

[1091-1100]
Thus established. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.
