[998] Third: gods perpetually intoxicated with fragrant nectar.

[998] Nectar distilled from merit. Cup always full, never emptying. This mountain dweller has seen such nectar—in the cup of meditation, in the wine of samadhi. But cups break. Nectar spills.

[998] Perpetual intoxication—what is this but avoidance? The sweet taste masks the bitter truth. The gods drink to forget: forget what? That even nectar ends.

[998] Three pith instructions: Recognition of the nature. Resting in that nature. Returning to that nature.

[998] Between the cup and the lip, between the drinking and the drunk, lies the nature of taste itself. Not sweet, not bitter—beyond both. This is the nectar that intoxicates no one.

[998] See what is. The cup is empty. The drinker is empty. The drinking is empty. Yet the nature of emptiness—how intoxicating!

[998] This student once sought the nectar of liberation in distant lands. Found it in his own cup, already full, already empty. The seeking was the drunkenness. The finding was sobriety.

[998] The perpetually intoxicated dwell in subtle dullness. Their bliss is a thicker veil than the gods' combat. Intoxication obscures; sobriety reveals. Yet even sobriety can be grasped.

[998] What appears as bliss—this constant sipping of merit's reward—is actually the path itself, seen through. The nectar becomes medicine. The cup becomes the teacher.

[998] From Lotus-Born: I have drunk the nectar of pure realms and the poison of hells. Both taste the same to the one who recognizes. Intoxication and sobriety—two doors to one room.

[998] In this way: The structure reveals: third tier, perpetually intoxicated, attachment to bliss. Beyond bliss and pain, the nature awaits.

[998] Emaho! The nectar that needs no cup!

[998] Rest in the drinking. Rest in the sobriety. Rest in the nature that neither drinks nor refuses.
