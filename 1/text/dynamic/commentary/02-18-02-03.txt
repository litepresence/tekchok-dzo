See what is. Three eyes for seeing. The vajra eye sees pure cognition's vast display. The bubble eye sees the four appearances—flickering, going, coming, parting, gathering, trembling. These are not separate visions. One awareness, appearing differently.

Understanding misses it; recognition sees what concepts cannot hold.

When seen with the vajra eye—the vast appearances of pure pristine cognition. This is not seeing something external. This is seeing the seeing itself. Through slight familiarization with that very nature, liberation is definitively achieved.

From this: The analysis. Spontaneous presence abiding as ground, the Great Seal. The progressive fourfold life-power. Wisdom, dharmata.
discriminating awareness—these are known as the vajra bubble eye.

Between the stark pointing and the earthy experience of practice, we find the vast middle way. The vajra eye and bubble eye are not two—they are one awareness, seen from different angles.

Furthermore, when seeing with the bubble eye—the subtle movements become visible. Flickering, going, coming, parting, gathering, trembling. These are not obstacles. They are the texture of clear seeing.

Recognition frees immediately—not in stages, never gradual.

The sun. The moon. The three supports of lamps—these methods help the bubble eye develop. Not because light is special, but because light reveals what was hidden.

Transforming obstacles: what hinders becomes help when recognized.
