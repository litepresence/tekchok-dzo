First, the seven verbal views held by individual intellectual analysis: The view of action-free primordial liberation, the view of effort-free primordial liberation, the view distinguished as progressive stages of mind leading upward, the view transcending virtue and vice, the view of great non-doing and non-arising, the view of great unmodified self-purity, and the view of great self-arisen self-liberation—these seven. The view of meaning is the view of vidya in its own immediacy.

Seven views. Seven ways of seeing. But not seven different things. One recognition, seven expressions. Action-free, effort-free, progressive, transcending virtue and vice, non-doing, self-pure, self-arisen—all names for the view that sees the nature. The view of meaning is direct—vidya, awareness, knowing its own face.

[3611-3620]
From the same source: "Regarding that, views are of two types: Verbal view and view of meaning. From the sequence of seven verbal views, individual mental preferences are made: Action-free, without effort, progressive distinction of self and other, free from killing, virtue and vice, without doing, without ground of arising, unmodified, appearances self-pure, afflictions self-placed, liberated."

Two views: verbal and meaning. The verbal views are the summaries of the Great Perfection view. Seven of them: action-free, effort-free, progressive, transcending virtue and vice, non-doing, self-pure, self-liberated. Each is a finger pointing at the moon.

[3621-3630]
Verbal views are the summary of general mind-vast Great Perfection views. Second, the enumerated views are the nine individual progressive views. From the Thalgyur: "Enumerations of expressed words and names: Outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassed view—these four."

Four views: outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed. Outer—the view of phenomena. Inner—the view of dharmata. Secret—the view of self-awareness. Unsurpassed—the view beyond all views. Four names for the one view.

[3631-3640]
Outer is view of phenomena, eight progressive mental preferences, held as intellectual apprehension. Viewing inner dharmata, essence and nature seen as illusory. Viewing secret self-awareness, seeing linked-chain connection. Suchness goes to expanse-vidya. Thus it is said.

Outer view—phenomena as empty. Eight mental preferences—progressive stages of understanding. Inner view—dharmata, essence and nature illusory. Secret view—self-awareness, linked chain. Suchness goes to expanse-vidya—the wisdom that knows expanse.

[3641-3650]
Third, regarding the view of nature: the view of abiding is that samsara and nirvana are primordially liberated. The view of pure-seeing transcends cause, effect, action, and effort. The view of nature is that appearance-existence is primordially liberated appearance. The view without fabrication is the great vastness of liberation from extremes.

The view of nature—samsara and nirvana are already liberated. Not going to be liberated, not need to liberate. They are primordially free. The view of pure-seeing—transcends cause and effect. The view without fabrication—great vastness, free from extremes.

[3651-3660]
Moreover, dharmata wheel is explained. The view of abiding realizes all dharmas, nature pure, dividing samsara and nirvana, without doing, losing arising. Authentic path pervaded by emptiness.

The dharmata wheel—the view of abiding. All dharmas realized, nature pure, samsara and nirvana divided. Without doing, losing arising—the path is emptiness, pervaded by emptiness.

[3661-3670]
The view of pure-seeing: three gates of liberation—emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness. The view of nature: appearance is liberation. The view without fabrication: great vastness, extreme liberation. These four views—outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed—are the progressive views.

Four views: outer phenomena, inner dharmata, secret self-awareness, unsurpassed. Each is a progressive view. But progress is not movement. The view is the same view, seen more clearly.

[3671-3680]
Outer phenomena—form, sound, smell, taste, touch. The view sees them as empty, as illusion. Eight examples: like a dream, like a mirage, like a reflection, like an echo, like a city of gandharvas, like a magical creation, like a potion, like a flash of lightning. All appearing, none real.

[3681-3690]
Inner dharmata—the nature of mind. The view sees it as empty, as luminous, as unobstructed. Secret self-awareness—the knowing that knows itself. Unsurpassed—the view beyond all views, the view that has no view. These four are the progressive views.

[3691-3700]
The seven verbal views and four meaning views—eleven in total. All are views of the Great Perfection. All point to the one nature. The intellectual analysis holds these views. But the view is not a possession. It is the seeing that releases all holding.

[3701-3708]
The view of meaning is vidya in its own immediacy. Not mediated by thought. Not constructed by intellect. Direct seeing, immediate recognition. The seven verbal views are summaries. The four meaning views are the actual realization. All converge on one point: the nature of mind, seen directly.
