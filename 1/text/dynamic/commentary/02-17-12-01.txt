[3600-3708]
First, the seven verbal views held by individual intellectual analysis: The view of action-free primordial liberation, the view of effort-free primordial liberation, the view distinguished as progressive stages of mind leading upward, the view transcending virtue and vice, the view of great non-doing and non-arising, the view of great unmodified self-purity, and the view of great self-arisen self-liberation—these seven. The view of meaning is the view of vidya in its own immediacy.

Seven views. Seven ways of seeing. But not seven different things. One recognition, seven expressions. Action-free, effort-free, progressive, transcending virtue and vice, non-doing, self-pure, self-arisen—all names for the view that sees the nature.

A simple practitioner... once collected views like a miser collects gold. "I have the view of action-free!" he would boast. "I hold the view of effort-free!" But the views were not his—they were concepts he grasped. The true view is not possessed. It is the seeing that possesses nothing.
