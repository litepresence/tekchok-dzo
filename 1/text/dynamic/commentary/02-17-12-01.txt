[3600-3708] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, word view individual intellect's examination: primordially action-freedom desire, effort-free primordial liberation desire, mind-stages higher-higher leading depending, class different desire, virtue-vice transcended desire, done-not-arisen-not great desire, not-transformed self-purified great desire, self-arisen self-liberated great desire—seven. Meaning's view: rigpa self-peak viewing.

[3600-3708] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Seven. Views. Stop. You think seven different views. One view, seven expressions. Action-freedom, effort-free—different names for the same recognition. Stop counting views. Start recognizing.

[3600-3708] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man once collected views like stamps! "I have the self-arisen view!" Hah! The view is not a possession. It is the recognition that there is no viewer. Seven views for seven types of mind. All lead to the same peak.

[3600-3708] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The seven views are the seven consorts' dance—each different, each perfect. Word-view, meaning-view, classification-view, nature-view, non-fabrication-view—all faces of the same wisdom. The view is not something to hold. It is the seeing that holds nothing.

[3600-3600] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, outer phenomena viewing: phenomena naturelessness seeing. Also phenomena particles vajra-eye viewing, appearance illusion eight-examples seeing, delusion true establishment none, thought three-realms return doubt none, mind ease. Phenomena particular wisdom-eye viewing, conventional appearance basisless primordially pure great realized, rigpa action and habitual tendency without, mind ease found.

[3600-3600] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Outer. Phenomena. Stop. You think outer phenomena are separate from inner mind. They are mind's display. Natureless from the beginning. The eight examples of illusion—like a dream, like a mirage—all pointing to one fact: nothing is as it appears.

[3600-3600] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man looked at mountains for years before seeing they were mind! Each rock, each tree—so solid, so real. Then one day, looking, the looker dissolved. The mountains remained. The solid became luminous. That was the outer view realized.

[3600-3600] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, like royal caste crown empowerment, own royal seat held, not changing; like rigpa own seat held, dharmata not changing, own seat held. Second, like king one country army led, border reached time, kingdom retinue with, change place none; like five doors consciousness arising basis empty, samsara name none. Third, like king minister good other king captured, that king also other king what says must listen; like mind consciousness moving continuum ceased, that arising basis rigpa self-power obtained.

[3600-3600] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Royal. Seat. Stop. You seek the royal seat of enlightenment. You already occupy it. The rigpa's seat is not achieved. It is recognized. The three examples—crown, conquest, capture—all point to the same: you are already king.

[Final] Three views: outer phenomena, inner dharmata, secret rigpa. Seven word-views, four meaning-views, all converging on one recognition. The view is not a philosophy. It is direct seeing.

Emaho! The view of natural spontaneity!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
