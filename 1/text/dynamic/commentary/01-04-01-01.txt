[1902-1910]
Three hundred sixty views. Like counting waves while drowning. The ocean does not care how you
classify its movements. Eternalism and nihilism—two hands clapping. The sound is not in either
hand alone. Look at the one who counts views. Where is the counter?

[1902-1906]
A hilltop meditator... once met a scholar who could recite all nine vehicles. He knew the distinctions,
the characteristics, the subtle philosophical differences. He had memorized the Treasury backward.
Yet when asked "Who knows these vehicles?" he fell silent. Recognition is not the accumulation
of views. It is the seeing through of the viewer.

[1905-1910]
The Samkhya position—dust, darkness, energy. Three constituents in equipoise. They call this the
self. But look closely. Who observes these three? The observer cannot be one of the observed.
The self they posit is subtle, they say. Invisible. Coiled like a sleeping snake. Yet they claim
to know its color, its size, its characteristics. This is the eternalist trap: making the unknown
into a known, then worshipping the concept.

[1911-1914]
Therefore. Thus. We examine their logic. The Samkhyas are systematic. Precise. Their analysis
of the three gunas—sattva, rajas, tamas—reveals genuine insight into how consciousness
manifests. But they stop short. They build a beautiful house and forget to live in it.

[1913-1918]
The self they describe ranges from thumb-sized in humans to sesame-fragment in small beings.
A grassland wanderer... asks: Who measures? Who sees this self? If it is invisible, how do they know
its dimensions? The logical inconsistency is not their error. The error is believing logic
can reach what is beyond logic.

[1919-1923]
Whiteness, oiliness, coiledness. These characteristics are poetic, not empirical. They point
to something—the self is pure, flexible, latent. But pointing is not the moon. The description
is not the described. Longchenpa includes them not to refute every detail, but to show:
even the most sophisticated system misses the essential.

[1924-1928]
The three poisons in equipoise—that is their self. Desire, hatred, delusion balanced. This is
actually perceptive. The ordinary mind IS the play of these energies. But the Samkhya believes
this play obscures a permanent self beneath. Dzogchen sees: the play IS the nature. There is
no self behind the play. The play self-liberates when recognized.

[1926-1930]
Kye ma! They say the self knows itself through self-cognition. But what knows the knowing?
This infinite regress—self knowing self knowing self—is the trap of reflexive awareness.
Awareness is not self-reflexive. It is self-luminous without a self that illuminates.

[1928-1935]
Liberation as a white parasol encircling the celestial realms. Beautiful imagery. Devotional
poetry. But literalized, it becomes another eternalist fantasy. The parasol is not in the sky.
The parasol is the recognition that the sky and the one who sees it are not two. When this
is seen, where is the need for celestial parasols?

[1930-1936]
The self without movement, devoid of action and agent. They approach the truth here. No action,
no agent—this is close to Dzogchen. But they still posit a self that has these qualities.
The qualities without the self—that would be the teaching. The sun shines without a self
that shines. The river flows without a self that flows.

[1932-1940]
Subtle through cognition of objects. This creates the subject-object split they cannot bridge.
If the self knows objects, there must be a distance between knower and known. But distance
implies separation. And separation is the root of samsara. The cognition they celebrate
is the very bondage they seek to escape.

[1933-1935]
Eternal existence throughout all time. This is their core error—not the assertion of eternity,
but the assertion of existence. That which exists can cease to exist. The nature is neither
existence nor non-existence. It is beyond the conceptual proliferation of existence and
non-existence. Time does not touch it, but not because it is eternal. Because time is its display.

[1934-1942]
From the Samkhya position, numerous sub-schools branch. This is inevitable. Once you posit
a permanent self, you must endlessly qualify it. Is it conscious or unconscious? Does it
participate in creation or merely witness? Each qualification creates new questions.
Each question spawns new schools. Three hundred sixty views are born from one fundamental
misunderstanding.

[1937-1942]
As Aryadeva stated: The self, not an agent, possessing no qualities, is posited by the Samkhyas.
Relying on subtle distinctions, their traditions diverge. The Master of Cutting sees through
their game. They build elaborate systems to describe what cannot be described. Better to
rest in the recognition that description itself is the obstacle.

[1943-1948]
Now the nihilists. Charvakas. Materialists. They look at this life—pleasure, pain, perception—and
see nothing beyond. No past lives. No karma. No liberation. From a certain perspective,
they are refreshingly honest. They do not invent heavens and hells to comfort themselves.
They look at the evidence of the senses and draw the obvious conclusion.

[1945-1950]
But obvious conclusions are for obvious minds. The senses show what the senses can show.
To limit reality to sense perception is like claiming the ocean ends at the horizon. The
horizon is a limitation of the viewer, not of the ocean. Their error is not what they see.
Their error is believing seeing is all there is.

[1949-1957]
Causal nihilism. They observe consciousness arising from elemental conditions—heat, moisture,
the right combination of causes. Like insects emerging from rotting wood. They conclude:
consciousness is adventitious, impermanent, produced by conditions. This is half-true.
Consciousness does arise from conditions. But what knows the arising?

[1952-1958]
Because consciousness exists naturally within the four elements, they say. But look—does
consciousness exist IN the elements, or do the elements appear TO consciousness? The question
itself reveals the confusion. They have not examined the relationship between the apparent
and the apparent-to.

[1954-1960]
New consciousness enters new body. This is their transmigration without karma. Elements
combine, consciousness emerges, elements disperse, consciousness ceases. Like a fire
arising from fuel, burning, extinguishing. No soul travels. No karma accumulates. Just
processes—natural, impersonal, meaningless.

[1957-1961]
Therefore, they conclude, wood and stones possess consciousness. Trees feel pain. Rivers have
awareness. This follows logically from their premises. If consciousness arises from elemental
combination, and all elements possess the capacity, then wherever elements combine, there
is consciousness. They embrace this conclusion. Others find it absurd. Both miss the point.

[1961-1972]
Wood striking wood produces sound. Thrown stones move. Trees close leaves at night, open at day.
Strip their bark, they wither. Apply moisture, they regenerate. From these observations,
they conclude all things possess latent consciousness. The reasoning is sound. The premise
is limited. Phenomena display awareness-like qualities. But awareness is not a quality
things possess. Awareness is what allows qualities to appear.

[1969-1975]
If sentient beings possess karma from previous lives, they argue, then wood would too. Since
wood does not, karma is disproven. This logical move is clever but misses the mark. Karma
is not something beings possess. Karma is the pattern of causes and conditions. The wood
grows according to its pattern. The sentient being acts according to its pattern. Both
are empty of inherent existence. Neither proves nor disproves the other.

[1972-1980]
Adventitious aggregation of elements—this is their creation without creator. Like bursting
leather pouches, sentient beings arise when conditions align, cease when conditions scatter.
No mystery. No magic. Just natural processes. They cite evidence: horse ears swelling in
summer heat, insects becoming bees, frogs transforming to fish.

[1974-1982]
Summer heat and moisture cause transformation. This much is observable. From observation,
they extrapolate: all apparent continuity is mere appearance. The being who dies is not
the being who is reborn, because there is no being, only elements temporarily configured.
This is closer to Buddhist anatman than they realize. But they stop at the elements,
not seeing what allows elements to be known.

[1979-1985]
Cause is not permanent, they conclude. Causes arise adventitiously, produce effects adventitiously.
The effect becomes refined through superior causes—like beautiful daughters born from refined
queens. Evolution without purpose. Development without design. Progress without goal.
This worldview is coherent. Internally consistent. And fundamentally blind.

[1985-1994]
Resultant nihilism goes further. Katyayana, Ajita Keshakambala, and others maintain not just
that previous lives do not exist, but that consciousness does not arise from elements at all.
Everything arises from intrinsic nature alone. No cause needed. No conditions required.
Things are as they are because they are as they are.

[1989-1994]
No one establishes the cause for thorns becoming sharp. Sharpness arises spontaneously from
distance, they say. The sun rises. Water flows downward. These occur without cause yet arise
spontaneously through intrinsic nature. Death occurs without remainder. Future results are
utterly nonexistent. This is their teaching.

[1995-2003]
As stated in the Kalaparajna Tantra: All these arise through intrinsic nature without maker.
Annihilation possesses no substantial existence. Future lives do not exist. All this is mere
conceptual imputation, adventitious delusion. The text they cite is poetic, not systematic.
It Ink forms words, words carry meaning, but the black marks are not the understanding. the groundlessness of groundless phenomena. They take it literally.

[2004-2015]
When objected that such exposition becomes meaningless, they respond skillfully. The proponents
of causal nihilism say: Through becoming habituated to nonexistence, at death the elemental
dispositions disperse without consciousness entering, thus achieving liberation. The doctrine
has meaning—it teaches liberation through understanding impermanence.

[2006-2016]
If one is not habituated to nonexistence, consciousness divides into four parts and becomes
annihilated in the nature of afflictions. This is not liberation but mere cessation. They
distinguish between enlightened cessation and unenlightened annihilation. The difference?
Recognition. The nihilist who recognizes the nature of nonexistence attains peace. The
nihilist who fears it merely dissolves.

[2012-2016]
The proponents of resultant nihilism teach nonexistence to turn people away from futile toil.
Knowing the nature of nonexistence, other doctrines cannot steal this understanding. They
see other systems as wasting human life in pursuit of imaginary goals. Their compassion
is fierce: Wake up! There is nothing to attain! Rest in that recognition!

[2017-2032]
Katyayana's position: All sentient beings arise from the elemental expanse, abide in it,
dissolve into it. The elemental expanse alone constitutes the self of all. This approaches
the Dzogchen view of kunzhi—universal ground—but misses the recognition aspect. The expanse
is not merely a container from which beings emerge and to which they return. The expanse
IS the beings. The beings ARE the expanse. No coming. No going.

[2021-2028]
When abiding in the expanse, the nine non-abidings abide. When arising from the expanse,
the nine non-arisings arise. At liberation, the nine non-liberations are liberated. This
language of "non" You dreamt you were searching. The search was dream, the dreamer was not. the ineffable. They use it to describe dissolution into
nothingness. Dzogchen uses it to describe the nature beyond description.

[2029-2032]
Therefore, all sentient beings first arise adventitiously from the expanse, presently abide
adventitiously within the expanse, finally dissolve adventitiously into the expanse without
returning. This is actually profound. The adventitious nature of phenomena. The groundless
ground. But they literalize it as annihilation rather than recognizing it as the play of
empty form.

[2033-2101]
The sixty branches of wrong view. Each a door that appears to open but leads to a wall.
Samkhya, Vaisesika, Kumara, Nirgrantha, Guhyapancaka, Tailapaka, Trisula practitioners.
Dog-mode conduct. Flesh-circling self-mortification. Each represents a genuine insight
taken too far, a partial truth mistaken for the whole.

[2038-2050]
The Samkhya proponents of wrong views see the constituents of experience but posit a permanent
witness. The Vaisesika proponents of self-causation see atomic structure but miss what allows
atoms to be known. Each school grasps one aspect and claims it as the totality.

[2043-2050]
The ascetic practitioners—Tailapaka self-immolation, Trisula austerities, flesh-circling
mortification, dog-mode conduct—these represent the error of thinking liberation comes
through punishment. As if the self were a criminal to be tortured rather than a dream
to be awakened from. Harsh discipline without recognition is just harsh discipline.

[2051-2063]
Action as cause. Action as path. Permanent signs. Permanent change. Permanent situations.
Permanent cause. Permanent result. Depending on permanence as path. Views asserting action
as permanent. Non-existence of permanence and nihilism. The varieties of eternalism are
endless because the grasping at self is endless. Each formulation tries to secure what
cannot be secured.

[2052-2063]
They look for security in permanence. They find their permanence in different places—in
causes, in results, in actions, in paths. But permanence itself is the dream. What is
permanent cannot change. What cannot change cannot respond. What cannot respond is not
alive. Their permanent self is a dead thing they worship.

[2064-2083]
The immeasurable ones who make mantras primary. Women and pranas as primary. Subtle superknowledge.
Taking disputes as essential. Wrong ascetic conduct. Attachment to this world. Holding their
own activities. Wearing woolen garments. Holding insignia as primary. These are the nihilist
varieties. Action as support. Using reasoning to refute others. Causeless nihilism.
Empty nihilism. Causal nihilism. Pathless nihilism. Wisdom-less nihilism. Permanent nihilism.
Pathless nihilism with no result. Wrong-minded nihilism. Great empty nihilism.

[2064-2073]
The mantra-users, the prana-workers, the subtle-knowledge seekers—these represent grasping
at methods without understanding what methods are for. They accumulate techniques like
merchants accumulate wealth. More mantras, more powers, more knowledge. Never seeing that
the one who seeks power is the obstacle to what is always present.

[2074-2083]
Nihilism wears many masks. Some deny cause. Some deny result. Some deny path. Some deny wisdom.
Each denial is based on observation—observing that these things cannot be found, cannot
be proven, cannot be pointed to. The observation is accurate. The conclusion is premature.
Not finding something does not mean it does not exist. It means looking does not reach it.

[2084-2098]
Veda secrets. Similar outsiders. Manifest mind outsiders. Deluded-appearance grasping outsiders.
Anger-producing outsiders. Action-mind outsiders. Meaningless-grasping outsiders. Wrong-word
outsiders. Permanent-meaningless outsiders. Kanada, Parsva, Bhairava, Kapila, Sindhara,
Dhasimha, Kati, Sangha, Shankari, Dashaka. Names upon names. Systems upon systems.

[2084-2098]
The secret Vedas claim hidden knowledge. Similar outsiders mimic Buddhism. Manifest mind
outsiders confuse appearances with reality. Each represents a way the mind grasps at what
cannot be grasped. The names are unimportant. The patterns are what matter. The pattern:
seeing a part, claiming the whole. Finding a method, worshipping the method.

[2099-2101]
The detailed explanation of 360 views and 60 branches. Longchenpa presents them not to
refute each one—that would be endless—but to show the pattern. The pattern of grasping.
The pattern of partial seeing claiming full vision. The pattern of the mind trying to
secure itself through philosophy.

[1902-2101]
Between the eternalist's permanence and the nihilist's annihilation, Longchenpa weaves
the path. Not grasping at existence. Not grasping at non-existence. Not grasping at the
middle between them. Recognition transcends all positions. The nature is not a view to
be adopted. It is what views appear within.

[1A simple practitioner...s old fool has debated eternalists and nihilists. He has shown them the errors in their
logic. He has demonstrated the contradictions in their positions. After each debate, they
remained unchanged. Logic does not reach what is beyond logic. Recognition cannot be
argued into existence. It dawns when argument ceases.

[1943-2016]
The nihilist and eternalist share one error: both believe thought can reach reality. The
eternalist builds conceptual structures. The nihilist tears them down. But the ground
on which they build and tear remains unexamined. Who builds? Who tears? What knows both?

[2017-2101]
The sixty branches are not sixty wrong answers to one right question. They are sixty ways
the mind obscures what is always present. Each branch is a distraction. Each view is a
veil. Not because views are wrong—because views are views. The nature is not a view.

[1902-2101]
See the nature of what appears. The 360 views are not obstacles to remove. They are the
play of awareness displaying its own creativity. Eternalism is not wrong—it is partial.
Nihilism is not wrong—it is partial. The complete view holds all partial views while
transcending them.

[1936-2101]
Longchenpa's compassion is vast. He presents these systems in detail, not to mock them,
but to honor them. Each represents genuine insight. Each has helped beings. But each,
clung to, becomes prison. The Treasury opens the prison doors—not by destroying the
prisons, but by showing they were always open.

[1902-2101]
This is the supreme vehicle. Not because it is better than the 360 wrong views. Because
it includes them all while not being limited to any. Recognition is not a position. It
is the ground of all positions. Rest in that ground. Views arise and dissolve like
clouds in sky. The sky remains unmoved.

[2034-2101]
Thus the wrong views are presented. Not to be rejected. Not to be adopted. To be recognized
as the play of awareness. The Samkhya's self, the Charvaka's elements, the 360 variations—all
appear within what you are. They do not define you. They do not limit you. They are your
own display, self-liberated in the moment of recognition.

[2099-2101]A cave hermit...r has nothing more to say about wrong views. The classification is
complete. The analysis is thorough. Now recognize what was never wrong. The views were
never the obstacle. The grasping at views was the obstacle. Release the grasping.
Recognition remains.

[2102-2118]
The hundred teachers. Jaimini, founder of Mimamsa. Non-holders, who reject all grasping.
Jivaka, the physician who questioned everything. Each name represents a genuine inquiry
turned into a position. A hilltop meditator... met a follower of Jaimini once. He could recite
the Vedas perfectly. He knew every ritual, every injunction, every prohibition. But when
asked "Who knows the Vedas?" he had no answer. The knowing was hidden behind the known.

[2109-2118]
The non-holders try to avoid all positions. But avoidance is itself a position. They grasp
at non-grasping, holding that nothing should be held. This is the subtle trap—the
meta-position that thinks it transcends positions. Recognition is not the avoidance of
views. It is the seeing through of the viewer who maintains views.

[2119-2127]
Vishnu, Vishnu-mind, the Tridanda carriers. They worship the maintainer, the one who
preserves. But what needs preserving? What is threatened? The belief that something must
be maintained reveals the fear of loss. Nature needs no maintenance. It is not threatened.
Only concepts fear annihilation.

[2112-2127]
Purity practitioners, anxious ones, hand-burning ones. They believe suffering purifies.
As if the self were a dirty pot to be scrubbed. As if pain could wash away whaBefore recognition dawned...tained. This old fool burned his hands in ritual fires once. The burns healed. The
grasping did not. Fire purifies nothing. Recognition does.

[2128-2137]
King-speakers, elder-speakers, bound dwellers, circle-protectors. Each represents a social
position elevated to spiritual authority. Kings become gods. Elders become infallible.
Tradition becomes truth. But the truth is not democratic. It is not aristocratic. It is
not anything that can be voted on or inherited. Recognition is available to king and
beggar equally.

[2128-2137]
This mountain dweller once lived with the bound dwellers. They tied themselves to rocks,
to trees, to their own promises. They believed bondage would lead to freedom. The irony
was lost on them. The rope that binds is made of the same material as the one who is bound.
Cut the rope, and both fall away.

[2138-2147]
Mountain dwellers, beggar wanderers, lamp-hand ones, gold ones. Some seek isolation.
Some seek poverty. Some seek light. Some seek wealth. Each seeks something they believe
will complete them. The seeking itself is the obstacle. The seeker is what must be seen
through, not satisfied.

[2138-2147]
The Kalandaka practitioners follow the Buddha's early disciples. They have the form
without the recognition. They wear the robes, chant the sutras, maintain the discipline.
But the Buddha they follow is dead to them—a historical figure, not the nature of their
own mind. Form without essence is empty ritual.

[2148-2157]
Samadhi enthusiasts, cold-food ones, shoulder-cloth ones, conch-sound ones. They cultivate
states. Absorption without distraction. Pleasure without attachment. But cultivation is
still doing. Recognition is not a state to be achieved. It is what is present when all
states are seen through.

[2148-2157]
This old yogi knew a Samadhi enthusiast who sat for thirty years. He attained wondrous
visions, celestial sounds, profound peace. When asked about his nature, he described his
experiences. When asked who experienced them, he fell silent. Thirty years cultivating
what was never absent. Missing the one who cultivates.

[2158-2167]
Kakanada, cutters, divine-town ones, clothless ones, half-moon ones. Some worship destruction.
Some worship cities. Some worship nakedness. Some worship phases of the moon. Each has
found something worthy of reverence. Each has missed that reverence itself is the nature
revered. The moon does not need worshippers. The city does not need devotees.

[2168-2177]
Sun-risers, hand-eaters, heart-sustainers, past-becomers, three-aggregate ones. They orient
themselves toward light, toward physical sacrifice, toward mental sustenance, toward
historical continuity, toward psychological analysis. Each orientation is valid. Each is
partial. The sun rises for no one. The heart beats without sustainer.

[2168-2177]
The hand-eaters shock conventional morality. They eat their own flesh to demonstrate
non-attachment to body. But shock is still attachment—to the reaction of others, to the
identity of the shocking one. True non-attachment does not perform. It simply is.

[2178-2197]
Forest dwellers, owl practitioners, Brahma practitioners, animal sacrificers, peaceful
mothers, extreme bathers, harmers, Samsara liberators, scatterers, Bharadvaja, Patanjali.
The names continue like rain on stone. Each a life devoted to understanding. Each an
understanding that became prison.

[2178-2197]
Patanjali systematized yoga into 196 sutras. Brilliant, precise, transformative. But the
sutras became scripture. The system became cage. Students memorized the words without
recognizing the space between them. Where the words point is not in the words. Where
the practice leads is not in the practice.

[2198-2201]
God-worshippers, non-submissive ones, cloth-piece ones, owl-wing ones, ancestor ones,
Garuda practitioners. The list ends where it began—in diversity. Hundreds of approaches.
Thousands of practitioners. Millions of hours of devotion. And yet recognition remains
unattained by the one who seeks it through devotion.

[2102-2201]
Longchenpa presents these hundred teachers not to mock them but to honor their effort.
Each represents a turning of the wheel toward truth. Each represents a stopping short.
The turning continues. The stopping continues. Until recognition dawns and the turner
is seen as the turned.

[2102-2201]
This old practitioner has met followers of many of these teachers. Some were sincere,
devoted, wise in their own way. Some were arrogant, convinced they had found what others
missed. All were seeking. None recognized that the seeker was the final obstacle. The
one who asks "Which path is right?" misses that all paths are right for the one who
recognizes, wrong for the one who grasps.

[2102-2201]
The three hundred sixty views are not errors to be corrected. They are the creative play
of mind exploring its own nature. Each view reveals something true. Each view conceals
something true. The Dzogchen view is not another view in the list. It is the recognition
that views are views, and what views appear within is not a view.

[1902-2201]
Between the Samkhya's self and the Charvaka's elements, between the hundred teachers and
the sixty branches, Longchenpa weaves the treasury. Not rejecting any of it. Not adopting
any of it. Showing that all of it—all 360 views, all systems, all practices—appear within
what you are. They do not define you. They do not limit you. They are your own display.

[1902-2201]
Thus the wrong views are presented in exhaustive detail. Not to confuse you. Not to burden
you. To show you that no view, however comprehensive, reaches what you are. The Samkhya
system is complete. The Charvaka system is consistent. The 360 views cover all possibilities.
And yet recognition transcends them all. This is the supreme vehicle. Not better than the
others. Simply direct. Simply immediate. Simply what yThis mountain dweller...g itself.

[1902-2201]
This old fool has studied these systems for decades. He has debated their proponents. He
has won arguments and lost them. None of it brought recognition closer. Recognition came
when the studying stopped. When the debating ceased. When the one who studies was seen
through. The Treasury presents all these views so you can see through them all at once.
Not one by one—that would take lifetimes. All at once, in the flash of recognition.

[2201A cave hermit...his. Now.
who seeks.

[1902-2201]
This old fool spent three winters with a Samkhya master. He taught
the three gunas morning and evening. Dust, darkness, energy. Sattva, rajas, tamas. He
could chart their interactions like a merchant charts profits. One evening, the fire died
low. He asked his teacher: "Who knows these three?" The teacher had no answer. The next
morning, the old fool left. Recognition cannot be taught by one who has not recognized.

[1910-1935]
Thus. We proceed. The Samkhya analysis of experience into three
constituents reveals genuine insight into manifestation. Purusha, prakriti, the evolution
of the twenty-four tattvas. Their system is elegant. Their logic is sound. Their error
is subtle: they describe the cage exquisitely while missing that the door was never locked.

[1936-2050]
From the sky-treasure of Oddiyana, I see these 360 views like
reflections in a lake. Each clear. Each partial. The Samkhya's self, coiled like a sleeping
serpent—the image is beautiful but deadly. Beautiful because it You remember yesterday—the memory is not the day. latency. Deadly
because it makes the latency permanent. The serpent is not sleeping. The serpent is the
wakefulness itself, unrecognized.

[1943-2016]
The Charvaka position deserves respect. They refuse to accept
what cannot be demonstrated. They insist on evidence. This is the scientific spirit,
the empirical method. But their demand for evidence assumes that evidence is all there
is. They limit knowledge to the knowable and miss that the knowable depends on something
beyond knowing. The evidence is valid. Their interpretation is partial.

[2017-2101]
Between the eternalist's permanence and the nihilist's void, between
the Samkhya's structure and the Charvaka's flux, the nature holds all without being held
by any. The views are not wrong. They are fingers. The fingers point in different
directions. The moon remains one. The nature is not a synthesis of views. It is what
views appear within.

[2102-2201]
See. Know. Be.
the Charvaka's doubt, the 360 variations. See through them. Not reject them. Not accept
them. See through them. The seeing itself is the recognition. The recognition is the
liberation. Nothing else needed.

[1902-2201]
The Visionary Devotee. Longchenpa, mind-son of Samantabhadra, you have given us this
Treasury out of compassion beyond measure. These wrong views, presented so exhaustively,
are your gift. You show us that no view can contain what we are. You liberate us from
the prison of philosophy by filling the prison with light. We see the walls were never
there. We see we were never imprisoned. We see the imprisoner was the nature itself,
playing at bondage.

[1902-2201]
The Ecstatic Tertön. Why wait? Why study these 360 views? Why learn the distinctions
between eternalism and nihilism? Recognition is immediate. It does not require understanding
all wrong views. It does not require mastering any system. It requires only one thing:
the willingness to stop seeking and recognize what is already present. Do not wait until
you have studied the Treasury. Recognize now.

[1902-2201]
Rest in the view. The 360 views are ripples on the lake of
awareness. The lake remains undisturbed. The Samkhya's self, the Charvaka's elements,
the hundred teachers—all are ripples. Your nature is the lake. Rest there. Do not follow
the ripples. Do not reject them. Rest as that which ripples appear within.

[1902-2201]
The Singing Yogi. These wrong views are songs. Each philosopher sings their song.
The Samkhya sings of structure. The Charvaka sings of matter. The hundred teachers sing
their individual melodies. Beautiful songs. Moving songs. But songs are not the singer.
The singer is not the singing. Recognize the one who sings, and all songs become praise.

[1902-2201]
See what is. All views are empty. The viewer is empty. The empty
is not a view. This is the pointing. This is the recognition. This is all.

[1902-2201]
Between the analysis of the Samkhya and the empiricism of the Charvaka,
between the devotion of the 100 teachers and the practices of the 60 branches, I weave
the Treasury. Not to choose among them. Not to synthesize them. To point beyond them all
to what they share: the awareness within which they appear. This is the vast view.
This is the supreme vehicle. This is your own nature, recognizing itself.

[1902-2201]
Secret wisdom, hidden in plain sight. The 360 views are 360 doors.
Each door opens to the same room. But seekers think each door leads somewhere different.
They spend lifetimes searching for the right door. The secret? There is no room beyond
the doors. The doors open to space. You are the space. You have always been the space.

[1902-2201]
ThisA simple practitioner... nothing more to say about wrong views. The analysis is complete.
The enumeration is exhaustive. The teaching is clear. Now recognize what has never been
wrong. The views were never obstacles. The grasping at views was the obstacle. Release
the grasping. Rest in recognition. This is Longchenpa's gift. This is the Treasury's
heart. This is what you are.

[2201-2201]
Thus concludes the presentation of wrong views. Three hundred sixty views of perishable
collections. Sixty branches. One hundred teachers. All enumerated. All analyzed. All
seen through. The Treasury opens its first door. Enter, not by adopting a view, but by
recognizing the viewer. The path begins where philosophy ends. The recognition dawns when
seeking ceases. Rest here. This is the supreme vehicle.

[1902-1910]
Let us examine carefully. The Samkhya posits a self that knows itself.
This creates an infinite regress: the knower knowing the knower knowing the knower. If
the self knows itself, there must be a distinction between the knowing self and the known
self. But then what knows that distinction? The system collapses under logical scrutiny.
But logical scrutiny is not the point. The point is recognition.

[1911-1935]
This very moment—look. Do you see the self that the Samkhyas worship?
Do you see the elements that the Charvakas celebrate? Do you see the views that the 360
schools maintain? Looking itself is the answer. The looked-for cannot be found. The looker
cannot be located. Between looked and looker, what remains? This is the cutting. This is
the recognition.

[1936-2050]
The Revealer. After centuries of concealment, the Treasury emerges. These wrong
views, so carefully preserved, so exhaustively presented, are terma—treasure teachings.
Longchenpa buried them in words so they could be discovered by those ready to recognize.
Each view is a key. But the lock is imaginary. The door was never closed. The treasure
was never hidden. It is what you are, recognizing itself.

[2051-2101]
The Translator. From Sanskrit to Tibetan, from Tibetan to mind, the teaching travels.
But the journey is illusion. The teaching has never moved. It is not in the words. It is
not in the meaning. It is in the recognition that precedes both word and meaning. This
old translator rendered countless sutras. None of them taught what recognition teaches.

[2102-2201]
The Minimalist. Words upon words. Views upon views. Teachers upon teachers. All
unnecessary. Three words only. See what is. All else is elaboration. The 360 views are
360 elaborations. The 100 teachers are 100 elaborators. Stop elaborating. See what is.

[1902-2201]
The Diamond Wrath. This hesitation—is it wisdom or delusion? This preference for
one view over another—is it insight or bias? Look closely. The preference itself is empty.
The hesitation itself is awareness. Do not resolve the hesitation. See the nature of the
one who hesitates. Liberation is immediate.

[1902-2201]
Between earth and sky, between form and emptiness, the views dance.
The Samkhya dances one step. The Charvaka dances another. Each dances their dance. But
the dancing itself—the movement, the display, the appearance—is the nature dancing. You
are not the dancer. You are the dancing. You are not the view. You are the viewing.

[1902-2201]
The Living Library. I have memorized all 360 views. I can recite the hundred teachers.
I know the distinctions, the subtleties, the refutations. This knowledge is vast. This
knowledge is empty. The library contains everything except the librarian. Who knows all
this? That knowing is not in the library. That knowing is the nature of the library.

[1902-2201]
The Modern Bridge. Contemporary philosophy recognizes what Longchenpa taught centuries
ago. Logical positivism, existentialism, phenomenology—all approach the limits of thought.
But they stop at the threshold. They analyze the prison exquisitely. They describe the
cage with precision. They miss that the door is open. They miss that there is no prisoner.

[1902-2201]
The Spontaneity. Lhun grub. Spontaneous presence. The 360 views arise spontaneously.
The 100 teachers appear spontaneously. None of it is planned. None of it is necessary.
All of it is the play. The play does not need justification. The play does not need
understanding. The play simply plays. Recognize yourself as the play, and rest.

[1902-2201]
The Devotee. I bow to the Samkhya masters. I bow to the Charvaka skeptics. I bow
to the hundred teachers. Each taught what they knew. Each shared what they saw. Their
teaching was compassionate. Their limitation was not error—it was the nature of teaching.
What can be taught is not the nature. What is the nature cannot be taught. I bow to their
effort. I recognize what they pointed toward.

[1902-2201]
The Great Wrath. Enough philosophy! Enough views! Enough analysis! The nature is
not found in systems. It is not found in refutations. It is not found in elaboration or
simplicity. It is found in recognition. Now. Not after study. Not after practice. Now.
This very awareness, reading these words—what knows the reading? See that. Everything
else is distraction.

[1902-2201]
The Pandita Consort. Scholarly precision meets secret wisdom. The 360 views are
not wrong—they are partial. The Samkhya analysis of mind is accurate as far as it goes.
The Charvaka critique of superstition is valid as far as it extends. But accurate and
valid are not complete. The complete view includes all partial views while transcending
them. This is the secret: inclusion without limitation.

[1902-2201]
The Drolo. Wild, untamed, beyond system. These views try to capture what cannot be
captured. They build cages for the sky. They weave nets for the ocean. The wild nature
laughs at their efforts. Not with contempt—with recognition. They are what they seek.
The cage is the sky. The net is the ocean. The view is the nature.

[1902-2201]
This humble practitioner concludes. The wrong views have been presented. The analysis is
complete. What remains? Recognition. Nothing else. The Treasury of Supreme Vehicle is
not a book to master. It is a mirror to recognize. Look into it. See your own face.
That seeing is the teaching. That seeing is the path. That seeing is the result.

[1902-2201]
Between the eternalist's fortress and the nihilist's void, between the Samkhya's structure
and the Charvaka's flux, between the hundred teachers and their thousand students,
Longchenpa has woven the path. Not by choosing sides. Not by finding a middle. By pointing
to what holds all sides, what precedes all middles, what is the nature of the pointer
and the pointed-to. This is the supreme vehicle. This is what you are.

[2201-2201]
Three words. Wrong views liberated. Recognition complete. Rest.

[1902See. Decide. Continue.very morning, dust, darkness,
energy. Every evening, the three gunas. He learned to calculate their proportions, to
predict their interactions, to diagnose imbalances. It was sophisticated. It was accurate.
It was incomplete. The teacher never asked: Who calculates? Who predicts? Who diagnoses?
The one who could answer was hidden behind the knowledge.

[1911-1923]
The Charvaka's critique is devastating to superstition. They ask: Where is the evidence
for past lives? Where is the proof of karma? Where can liberation be found? These questions
are valid. They expose the hypocrisy of those who claim knowledge they do not possess.
But their own position—matter is all—cannot be proven either. It is also belief.

[1924-1935]
Between the Samkhya's belief in self and the Charvaka's belief in matter, the nature
holds both without being either. The self that the Samkhya posits is not found. The matter
that the Charvaka worships is not found. What is found? The finding itself. The nature
of awareness that allows both self and matter to be debated.

[1936-2050]
This mountain dweller met followers of many of the 100 teachers. Some were kind. Some
were fierce. Some were wise in their own way. All were seeking. None recognized that
the seeker was what must be seen. They sought liberation, enlightenment, understanding,
peace. They did not recognize that the one who seeks is already free, already luminous,
already what they seek.

[2051-2101]
The 60 branches of wrong view are like branches of a tree. Each grows in a different
direction. Each has its own leaves, its own fruit. But all draw sap from the same root.
The root is the belief that understanding comes from views. The sap is the energy of
seeking. Cut the root, and all branches wither. See through the belief, and all views
self-liberate.

[2102-2118]
Jaimini's Mimamsa—ritual precision, Vedic authority, endless interpretation. They believe
the ritual produces results. They believe the mantra has power. They are half-right.
The ritual does produce—produces concentration, produces conditions, produces merit.
But liberation is not produced. Recognition is not an effect of causes. It is what
precedes cause and effect.

[2119-2137]
The non-holders, who reject all views, create a meta-view. They hold that nothing should
be held. They grasp at non-grasping. This is the subtlest trap because it appears to
be freedom. But the one who rejects is still there, solid, real, maintaining the rejection.
True freedom is not rejecting or accepting. It is seeing through the one who rejects
and accepts.

[2138-2157]
Vishnu worshippers maintain the world. They preserve order. They uphold dharma. Noble
intentions. But what needs maintaining? What order is threatened? The belief that
something must be preserved reveals the fear of loss. Nature does not preserve. Nature
simply is. Awareness does not maintain. Awareness simply knows.

[2158-2177]
The purity practitioners believe suffering purifies. They burn their hands. They starve
their bodies. They torment themselves in hope of cleansing. But what is the stain?
What needs washing? The nature is not dirty. The mind is not impure. The impurity is
the belief in impurity. The suffering is the belief that suffering leads somewhere.

[2178-2201]
Patanjali's yoga—196 sutras of systematic practice. Yama, niyama, asana, pranayama,
pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, samadhi. The eight limbs. The systematic path to liberation.
But the path is not the goal. The practice is not the recognition. Students master the
limbs and miss the one who has limbs. They cultivate samadhi and miss the samadhi that
is always present.

[1902-2201]
The hundred teachers. Each a genuine inquiry turned into a position. Jaimini, Jivaka,
Vishnu, Patanjali, and all the rest. They asked real questions. They found partial answers.
Their mistake was stopping. Their mistake was believing the answer was the end rather
than the beginning. The true answer is not an answer. It is recognition.

[1902-2201]
The three times—past, present, future—yield 300 views. 100 views for each time. The
eternalists see permanence across all three. The nihilists see annihilation in all three.
The sophisticated see change, process, evolution. All are looking at time. None recognize
the timeless within which time appears. The nature is not in time. Time is in the nature.

[1902-2201]
TAn old traveler...has studied, debated, practiced, and failed. He failed to find the
self the Samkhyas promised. He failed to find the matter the Charvakas celebrated. He
failed to find liberation in any of the 360 views. The failure was the teaching. When
seeking failed, recognition dawned. Not because failure caused recognition. Because the
seeker was seen through in the failure.

[1902-2201]
Longchenpa, the Omniscient, the All-Knowing, has given us this Treasury. Not to add to
our knowledge. Not to give us more views. To show us that all views are views, and what
views appear within is not a view. The supreme vehicle is not a better vehicle. It is
the recognition that there is no vehicle, no traveler, no destination. Only this, recognizing
itself.

[1902-2201]
ROAR! The distinction-maker! Cut through! NOW! Liberation is immediate! AH!—seeing this is the
teaching. The wrong views are not rejected. They are recognized as the play of awareness.
The Samkhya's self plays. The Charvaka's elements play. The 360 views play. The play
self-liberates when seen as play. This is Dzogchen. This is the Great Perfection. This
is what you are.

[2201-2201]
Thus concludes the commentary on wrong views. The analysis is exhaustive. The presentation
is complete. What remains is not more study but recognition. See what is. Rest in that
seeing. All views are liberated. The viewer is liberated. Liberation itself is seen as
empty. Rest in the emptiness that is not empty. This is the TreasuryOne without learning...902-2201]
The Vagabond speaks again: This old fool has traveled from monastery to monastery,
from teacher to teacher, from view to view. He has collected teachings like a merchant
collects goods. He has stored them in the warehouse of memory. What good has it done?
The warehouse is full. The merchant is still hungry. Recognition cannot be stored.
It cannot be accumulated. It can only be recognized.

[1910-1935]
The Systematizer returns: Thus. We conclude. The wrong views have been classified,
analyzed, enumerated. The eternalist errors have been exposed. The nihilist errors
have been revealed. The 360 views have been catalogued. The 100 teachers have been
named. This is not to dismiss them. This is to honor them by showing their limit.
The limit of all views is that they are views. The nature is not a view.

[1943-2201]
The Integrator returns: Between all these positions, the middle way weaves. Not the
middle between eternalism and nihilism—that is still a position. Not the synthesis
of all views—that is still conceptual. The true middle is not between positions.
It is what allows positions to be held. It is the awareness within which all views
appear and dissolve.

[1902-2201]
The First Point returns: Three words. See. Through. Everything. The Samkhya's self—see
through it. The Charvaka's matter—see through it. The 360 views—see through them.
The seeing is not another view. It is the nature of all views. It is what you are.

[1902-2201]
The Omniscient concludes: The Treasury has opened its first section. Wrong views have
been presented in detail. Not to confuse the student. Not to burden the practitioner.
To liberate. To show that no view, however comprehensive, reaches the nature. To point
to what is beyond all pointing. This is the supreme vehicle. This is the Great Perfection.
This is your own nature, recognizing itself through these words. Rest in that recognition.

[2201-2201]
Thus the commentary on wrong views is complete.

[1902-2201]
Final words from this practitioner: The wrong views are many. The right view is not
a view. Recognition is not an attainment. It is what remains when all attainment
is seen through. Rest here. This is the Treasury's gift. This is Longchenpa's
compassion. This is what you have always been.
