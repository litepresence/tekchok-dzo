[1-9]
Three hundred sixty views. Like counting waves while drowning. The ocean does not care how you
classify its movements. Eternalism and nihilism—two hands clapping. The sound is not in either
hand alone. Look at the one who counts views. Where is the counter?

[10-14]
A hilltop meditator... once met a scholar who could recite all nine vehicles. He knew the distinctions,
the characteristics, the subtle philosophical differences. He had memorized the Treasury backward.
Yet when asked "Who knows these vehicles?" he fell silent. Recognition is not the accumulation
of views. It is the seeing through of the viewer.

[15-20]
The Samkhya position—dust, darkness, energy. Three constituents in equipoise. They call this the
self. But look closely. Who observes these three? The observer cannot be one of the observed.
The self they posit is subtle, they say. Invisible. Coiled like a sleeping snake. Yet they claim
to know its color, its size, its characteristics. This is the eternalist trap: making the unknown
into a known, then worshipping the concept.

[21-24]
Therefore. Thus. We examine their logic. The Samkhyas are systematic. Precise. Their analysis
of the three gunas—sattva, rajas, tamas—reveals genuine insight into how consciousness
manifests. But they stop short. They build a beautiful house and forget to live in it.

[25-30]
The self they describe ranges from thumb-sized in humans to sesame-fragment in small beings.
A grassland wanderer... asks: Who measures? Who sees this self? If it is invisible, how do they know
its dimensions? The logical inconsistency is not their error. The error is believing logic
can reach what is beyond logic.

[31-35]
Whiteness, oiliness, coiledness. These characteristics are poetic, not empirical. They point
to something—the self is pure, flexible, latent. But pointing is not the moon. The description
is not the described. Longchenpa includes them not to refute every detail, but to show:
even the most sophisticated system misses the essential.

[36-40]
The three poisons in equipoise—that is their self. Desire, hatred, delusion balanced. This is
actually perceptive. The ordinary mind IS the play of these energies. But the Samkhya believes
this play obscures a permanent self beneath. Dzogchen sees: the play IS the nature. There is
no self behind the play. The play self-liberates when recognized.

[41-45]
Kye ma! They say the self knows itself through self-cognition. But what knows the knowing?
This infinite regress—self knowing self knowing self—is the trap of reflexive awareness.
Awareness is not self-reflexive. It is self-luminous without a self that illuminates.

[46-53]
Liberation as a white parasol encircling the celestial realms. Beautiful imagery. Devotional
poetry. But literalized, it becomes another eternalist fantasy. The parasol is not in the sky.
The parasol is the recognition that the sky and the one who sees it are not two. When this
is seen, where is the need for celestial parasols?

[54-60]
The self without movement, devoid of action and agent. They approach the truth here. No action,
no agent—this is close to Dzogchen. But they still posit a self that has these qualities.
The qualities without the self—that would be the teaching. The sun shines without a self
that shines. The river flows without a self that flows.

[61-69]
Subtle through cognition of objects. This creates the subject-object split they cannot bridge.
If the self knows objects, there must be a distance between knower and known. But distance
implies separation. And separation is the root of samsara. The cognition they celebrate
is the very bondage they seek to escape.

[70-72]
Eternal existence throughout all time. This is their core error—not the assertion of eternity,
but the assertion of existence. That which exists can cease to exist. The nature is neither
existence nor non-existence. It is beyond the conceptual proliferation of existence and
non-existence. Time does not touch it, but not because it is eternal. Because time is its display.

[73-81]
From the Samkhya position, numerous sub-schools branch. This is inevitable. Once you posit
a permanent self, you must endlessly qualify it. Is it conscious or unconscious? Does it
participate in creation or merely witness? Each qualification creates new questions.
Each question spawns new schools. Three hundred sixty views are born from one fundamental
misunderstanding.

[82-87]
As Aryadeva stated: The self, not an agent, possessing no qualities, is posited by the Samkhyas.
Relying on subtle distinctions, their traditions diverge. The Master of Cutting sees through
their game. They build elaborate systems to describe what cannot be described. Better to
rest in the recognition that description itself is the obstacle.

[88-93]
Now the nihilists. Charvakas. Materialists. They look at this life—pleasure, pain, perception—and
see nothing beyond. No past lives. No karma. No liberation. From a certain perspective,
they are refreshingly honest. They do not invent heavens and hells to comfort themselves.
They look at the evidence of the senses and draw the obvious conclusion.

[94-99]
But obvious conclusions are for obvious minds. The senses show what the senses can show.
To limit reality to sense perception is as if saying the ocean ends at the horizon. The
horizon is a limitation of the viewer, not of the ocean. Their error is not what they see.
Their error is believing seeing is all there is.

[100-108]
Causal nihilism. They observe consciousness arising from elemental conditions—heat, moisture,
the right combination of causes. Like insects emerging from rotting wood. They conclude:
consciousness is adventitious, impermanent, produced by conditions. This is half-true.
Consciousness does arise from conditions. But what knows the arising?

[109-115]
Because consciousness exists naturally within the four elements, they say. But look—does
consciousness exist IN the elements, or do the elements appear TO consciousness? The question
itself reveals the confusion. They have not examined the relationship between the apparent
and the apparent-to.

[116-122]
New consciousness enters new body. This is their transmigration without karma. Elements
combine, consciousness emerges, elements disperse, consciousness ceases. Like a fire
arising from fuel, burning, extinguishing. No soul travels. No karma accumulates. Just
processes—natural, impersonal, meaningless.

[123-127]
Therefore, they conclude, wood and stones possess consciousness. Trees feel pain. Rivers have
awareness. This follows logically from their premises. If consciousness arises from elemental
combination, and all elements possess the capacity, then wherever elements combine, there
is consciousness. They embrace this conclusion. Others find it absurd. Both miss the point.

[128-139]
Wood striking wood produces sound. Thrown stones move. Trees close leaves at night, open at day.
Strip their bark, they wither. Apply moisture, they regenerate. From these observations,
they conclude all things possess latent consciousness. The reasoning is sound. The premise
is limited. Phenomena display awareness-like qualities. But awareness is not a quality
things possess. Awareness is what allows qualities to appear.

[140-146]
If sentient beings possess karma from previous lives, they argue, then wood would too. Since
wood does not, karma is disproven. This logical move is clever but misses the mark. Karma
is not something beings possess. Karma is the pattern of causes and conditions. The wood
grows according to its pattern. The sentient being acts according to its pattern. Both
are empty of inherent existence. Neither proves nor disproves the other.

[147-155]
Adventitious aggregation of elements—this is their creation without creator. Like bursting
leather pouches, sentient beings arise when conditions align, cease when conditions scatter.
No mystery. No magic. Just natural processes. They cite evidence: horse ears swelling in
summer heat, insects becoming bees, frogs transforming to fish.

[156-164]
Summer heat and moisture cause transformation. This much is observable. From observation,
they extrapolate: all apparent continuity is mere appearance. The being who dies is not
the being who is reborn, because there is no being, only elements temporarily configured.
This is closer to Buddhist anatman than they realize. But they stop at the elements,
not seeing what allows elements to be known.

[165-171]
Cause is not permanent, they conclude. Causes arise adventitiously, produce effects adventitiously.
The effect becomes refined through superior causes—like beautiful daughters born from refined
queens. Evolution without purpose. Development without design. Progress without goal.
This worldview is coherent. Internally consistent. And fundamentally blind.

[172-181]
Resultant nihilism goes further. Katyayana, Ajita Keshakambala, and others maintain not just
that previous lives do not exist, but that consciousness does not arise from elements at all.
Everything arises from intrinsic nature alone. No cause needed. No conditions required.
Things are as they are because they are as they are.

[182-187]
No one establishes the cause for thorns becoming sharp. Sharpness arises spontaneously from
distance, they say. The sun rises. Water flows downward. These occur without cause yet arise
spontaneously through intrinsic nature. Death occurs without remainder. Future results are
utterly nonexistent. This is their teaching.

[188-196]
As stated in the Kalaparajna Tantra: All these arise through intrinsic nature without maker.
Annihilation possesses no substantial existence. Future lives do not exist. All this is mere
conceptual imputation, adventitious delusion. The text they cite is poetic, not systematic.
It Ink forms words, words carry meaning, but the black marks are not the understanding. the groundlessness of groundless phenomena. They take it literally.

[197-208]
When objected that such exposition becomes meaningless, they respond skillfully. The proponents
of causal nihilism say: Through becoming habituated to nonexistence, at death the elemental
dispositions disperse without consciousness entering, thus achieving liberation. The doctrine
has meaning—it teaches liberation through understanding impermanence.

[209-219]
If one is not habituated to nonexistence, consciousness divides into four parts and becomes
annihilated in the nature of afflictions. This is not liberation but mere cessation. They
distinguish between enlightened cessation and unenlightened annihilation. The difference?
Recognition. The nihilist who recognizes the nature of nonexistence attains peace. The
nihilist who fears it merely dissolves.

[220-224]
The proponents of resultant nihilism teach nonexistence to turn people away from futile toil.
Knowing the nature of nonexistence, other doctrines cannot steal this understanding. They
see other systems as wasting human life in pursuit of imaginary goals. Their compassion
is fierce: Wake up! There is nothing to attain! Rest in that recognition!

[225-240]
Katyayana's position: All sentient beings arise from the elemental expanse, abide in it,
dissolve into it. The elemental expanse alone constitutes the self of all. This approaches
the Dzogchen view of kunzhi—universal ground—but misses the recognition aspect. The expanse
is not merely a container from which beings emerge and to which they return. The expanse
IS the beings. The beings ARE the expanse. No coming. No going.

[241-248]
When abiding in the expanse, the nine non-abidings abide. When arising from the expanse,
the nine non-arisings arise. At liberation, the nine non-liberations are liberated. This
language of "non" You dreamt you were searching. The search was dream, the dreamer was not. the ineffable. They use it to describe dissolution into
nothingness. Dzogchen uses it to describe the nature beyond description.

[249-252]
Therefore, all sentient beings first arise adventitiously from the expanse, presently abide
adventitiously within the expanse, finally dissolve adventitiously into the expanse without
returning. This is actually profound. The adventitious nature of phenomena. The groundless
ground. But they literalize it as annihilation rather than recognizing it as the play of
empty form.

[253-321]
The sixty branches of wrong view. Each a door that appears to open but leads to a wall.
Samkhya, Vaisesika, Kumara, Nirgrantha, Guhyapancaka, Tailapaka, Trisula practitioners.
Dog-mode conduct. Flesh-circling self-mortification. Each represents a genuine insight
taken too far, a partial truth mistaken for the whole.

[322-334]
The Samkhya proponents of wrong views see the constituents of experience but posit a permanent
witness. The Vaisesika proponents of self-causation see atomic structure but miss what allows
atoms to be known. Each school grasps one aspect and claims it as the totality.

[335-342]
The ascetic practitioners—Tailapaka self-immolation, Trisula austerities, flesh-circling
mortification, dog-mode conduct—these represent the error of thinking liberation comes
through punishment. As if the self were a criminal to be tortured rather than a dream
to be awakened from. Harsh discipline without recognition is just harsh discipline.

[338-637]
Between the Samkhya's self and the Charvaka's elements, between the hundred teachers and
the sixty branches, Longchenpa weaves the treasury. Not rejecting any of it. Not adopting
any of it. Showing that all of it—all 360 views, all systems, all practices—appear within
what you are. They do not define you. They do not limit you. They are your own display.

[343-355]
Action as cause. Action as path. Permanent signs. Permanent change. Permanent situations.
Permanent cause. Permanent result. Depending on permanence as path. Views asserting action
as permanent. Non-existence of permanence and nihilism. The varieties of eternalism are
endless because the grasping at self is endless. Each formulation tries to secure what
cannot be secured.

[356-367]
They look for security in permanence. They find their permanence in different places—in
causes, in results, in actions, in paths. But permanence itself is the dream. What is
permanent cannot change. What cannot change cannot respond. What cannot respond is not
alive. Their permanent self is a dead thing they worship.

[368-387]
The immeasurable ones who make mantras primary. Women and pranas as primary. Subtle superknowledge.
Taking disputes as essential. Wrong ascetic conduct. Attachment to this world. Holding their
own activities. Wearing woolen garments. Holding insignia as primary. These are the nihilist
varieties. Action as support. Using reasoning to refute others. Causeless nihilism.
Empty nihilism. Causal nihilism. Pathless nihilism. Wisdom-less nihilism. Permanent nihilism.
Pathless nihilism with no result. Wrong-minded nihilism. Great empty nihilism.

[379-637]
The Integrator returns: Between all these positions, the middle way weaves. Not the
middle between eternalism and nihilism—that is still a position. Not the synthesis
of all views—that is still conceptual. The true middle is not between positions.
It is what allows positions to be held. It is the awareness within which all views
appear and dissolve.

[388-397]
The mantra-users, the prana-workers, the subtle-knowledge seekers—these represent grasping
at methods without understanding what methods are for. They accumulate techniques like
merchants accumulate wealth. More mantras, more powers, more knowledge. Never seeing that
the one who seeks power is the obstacle to what is always present.

[398-407]
Nihilism wears many masks. Some deny cause. Some deny result. Some deny path. Some deny wisdom.
Each denial is based on observation—observing that these things cannot be found, cannot
be proven, cannot be pointed to. The observation is accurate. The conclusion is premature.
Not finding something does not mean it does not exist. It means looking does not reach it.

[408-422]
Veda secrets. Similar outsiders. Manifest mind outsiders. Deluded-appearance grasping outsiders.
Anger-producing outsiders. Action-mind outsiders. Meaningless-grasping outsiders. Wrong-word
outsiders. Permanent-meaningless outsiders. Kanada, Parsva, Bhairava, Kapila, Sindhara,
Dhasimha, Kati, Sangha, Shankari, Dashaka. Names upon names. Systems upon systems.

[423-437]
The secret Vedas claim hidden knowledge. Similar outsiders mimic Buddhism. Manifest mind
outsiders confuse appearances with reality. Each represents a way the mind grasps at what
cannot be grasped. The names are unimportant. The patterns are what matter. The pattern:
seeing a part, claiming the whole. Finding a method, worshipping the method.

[438-440]
The detailed explanation of 360 views and 60 branches. Longchenpa presents them not to
refute each one—that would be endless—but to show the pattern. The pattern of grasping.
The pattern of partial seeing claiming full vision. The pattern of the mind trying to
secure itself through philosophy.

[438-637]
Between the eternalist's permanence and the nihilist's annihilation, Longchenpa weaves
the path. Not grasping at existence. Not grasping at non-existence. Not grasping at the
middle between them. Recognition transcends all positions. The nature is not a view to
be adopted. It is what views appear within.

[1A simple practitioner...s old fool has debated eternalists and nihilists. He has shown them the errors in their
logic. He has demonstrated the contradictions in their positions. After each debate, they
remained unchanged. Logic does not reach what is beyond logic. Recognition cannot be
argued into existence. It dawns when argument ceases.

[472-637]
Longchenpa's compassion is vast. He presents these systems in detail, not to mock them,
but to honor them. Each represents genuine insight. Each has helped beings. But each,
clung to, becomes prison. The Treasury opens the prison doors—not by destroying the
prisons, but by showing they were always open.

[523-637]
From the sky-treasure of Oddiyana, I see these 360 views like
reflections in a lake. Each clear. Each partial. The Samkhya's self, coiled like a sleeping
serpent—the image is beautiful but deadly. Beautiful because it You remember yesterday—the memory is not the day. latency. Deadly
because it makes the latency permanent. The serpent is not sleeping. The serpent is the
wakefulness itself, unrecognized.

[538-637]
Longchenpa presents these hundred teachers not to mock them but to honor their effort.
Each represents a turning of the wheel toward truth. Each represents a stopping short.
The turning continues. The stopping continues. Until recognition dawns and the turner
is seen as the turned.

[553-637]
The sixty branches are not sixty wrong answers to one right question. They are sixty ways
the mind obscures what is always present. Each branch is a distraction. Each view is a
veil. Not because views are wrong—because views are views. The nature is not a view.

[564-637]
The nihilist and eternalist share one error: both believe thought can reach reality. The
eternalist builds conceptual structures. The nihilist tears them down. But the ground
on which they build and tear remains unexamined. Who builds? Who tears? What knows both?

[570-637]
Thus the wrong views are presented. Not to be rejected. Not to be adopted. To be recognized
as the play of awareness. The Samkhya's self, the Charvaka's elements, the 360 variations—all
appear within what you are. They do not define you. They do not limit you. They are your
own display, self-liberated in the moment of recognition.

[635-637]Naropa's hermitage hermit...r has nothing more to say about wrong views. The classification is
complete. The analysis is thorough. Now recognize what was never wrong. The views were
never the obstacle. The grasping at views was the obstacle. Release the grasping.
Recognition remains.

[587-637]
The Translator. From Sanskrit to Tibetan, from Tibetan to mind, the teaching travels.
But the journey is illusion. The teaching has never moved. It is not in the words. It is
not in the meaning. It is in the recognition that precedes both word and meaning. This
old translator rendered countless sutras. None of them taught what recognition teaches.

[612-637]
Thus. We proceed. The Samkhya analysis of experience into three
constituents reveals genuine insight into manifestation. Purusha, prakriti, the evolution
of the twenty-four tattvas. Their system is elegant. Their logic is sound. Their error
is subtle: they describe the cage exquisitely while missing that the door was never locked.

[613-637]
This very moment—look. Do you see the self that the Samkhyas worship?
Do you see the elements that the Charvakas celebrate? Do you see the views that the 360
schools maintain? Looking itself is the answer. The looked-for cannot be found. The looker
cannot be located. Between looked and looker, what remains? This is the cutting. This is
the recognition.

[614-637]
Patanjali's yoga—196 sutras of systematic practice. Yama, niyama, asana, pranayama,
pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, samadhi. The eight limbs. The systematic path to liberation.
But the path is not the goal. The practice is not the recognition. Students master the
limbs and miss the one who has limbs. They cultivate samadhi and miss the samadhi that
is always present.

[618-637]
Forest dwellers, owl practitioners, Brahma practitioners, animal sacrificers, peaceful
mothers, extreme bathers, harmers, Samsara liberators, scatterers, Bharadvaja, Patanjali.
The names continue like rain on stone. Each a life devoted to understanding. Each an
understanding that became prison.

[619-637]
The non-holders, who reject all views, create a meta-view. They hold that nothing should
be held. They grasp at non-grasping. This is the subtlest trap because it appears to
be freedom. But the one who rejects is still there, solid, real, maintaining the rejection.
True freedom is not rejecting or accepting. It is seeing through the one who rejects
and accepts.

[621-637]
The hundred teachers. Jaimini, founder of Mimamsa. Non-holders, who reject all grasping.
Jivaka, the physician who questioned everything. Each name represents a genuine inquiry
turned into a position. A hilltop meditator... met a follower of Jaimini once. He could recite
the Vedas perfectly. He knew every ritual, every injunction, every prohibition. But when
asked "Who knows the Vedas?" he had no answer. The knowing was hidden behind the known.

[622-637]
Purity practitioners, anxious ones, hand-burning ones. They believe suffering purifies.
As if the self were a dirty pot to be scrubbed. As if pain could wash away whaBefore recognition dawned...tained. This old fool burned his hands in ritual fires once. The burns healed. The
grasping did not. Fire purifies nothing. Recognition does.

[625-637]
The Charvaka's critique is devastating to superstition. They ask: Where is the evidence
for past lives? Where is the proof of karma? Where can liberation be found? These questions
are valid. They expose the hypocrisy of those who claim knowledge they do not possess.
But their own position—matter is all—cannot be proven either. It is also belief.

[626-637]
Between the Samkhya's belief in self and the Charvaka's belief in matter, the nature
holds both without being either. The self that the Samkhya posits is not found. The matter
that the Charvaka worships is not found. What is found? The finding itself. The nature
of awareness that allows both self and matter to be debated.

[628-637]
The non-holders try to avoid all positions. But avoidance is itself a position. They grasp
at non-grasping, holding that nothing should be held. This is the subtle trap—the
meta-position that thinks it transcends positions. Recognition is not the avoidance of
views. It is the seeing through of the viewer who maintains views.

[629-637]
Vishnu, Vishnu-mind, the Tridanda carriers. They worship the maintainer, the one who
preserves. But what needs preserving? What is threatened? The belief that something must
be maintained reveals the fear of loss. Nature needs no maintenance. It is not threatened.
Only concepts fear annihilation.

[634-637]
God-worshippers, non-submissive ones, cloth-piece ones, owl-wing ones, ancestor ones,
Garuda practitioners. The list ends where it began—in diversity. Hundreds of approaches.
Thousands of practitioners. Millions of hours of devotion. And yet recognition remains
unattained by the one who seeks it through devotion.

[637-637]
Thus concludes the presentation of wrong views. Three hundred sixty views of perishable
collections. Sixty branches. One hundred teachers. All enumerated. All analyzed. All
seen through. The Treasury opens its first door. Enter, not by adopting a view, but by
recognizing the viewer. The path begins where philosophy ends. The recognition dawns when
seeking ceases. Rest here. This is the supreme vehicle.
