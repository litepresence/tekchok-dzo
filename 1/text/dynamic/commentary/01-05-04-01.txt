The explanation tantra begins with five types of grounding—five ways of establishing meaning that ensure the teaching takes root in the listener's mind. Root meaning grasps name-identity, the foundation of designation. Yoga meaning shows the conclusion gate, where practice leads. Purpose meaning establishes one's place in the vast terrain of the teaching. Word meaning connects the straight line of communication. History meaning satisfies the mind's need for context and lineage. These five are not arbitrary but essential; without any one, the teaching remains incomplete.

—

[1-1572]
The explanation tantra is the bridge between theory and practice, between understanding and realization. It provides the framework, the structure, the method. Without this framework, Dzogchen remains abstract; with it, Dzogchen becomes accessible. The five groundings are the foundation; the twenty-three examples are the tools; the subtle body anatomy is the vehicle; the tantra divisions are the path.

—

[32-39]
From the Sun-Moon-Joined Tantra: the five groundings explained. Root meaning first—without understanding the root, the tree of knowledge cannot grow. Yoga meaning second—without knowing where the path leads, the traveler wanders aimlessly. Purpose meaning third—without knowing why one studies, enthusiasm fades. Word meaning fourth—without clear terminology, confusion arises. History meaning fifth—without confidence in the lineage, doubt undermines practice.

—

[40-62]
The defects of incomplete explanation: without history meaning, mind-not-believing arises toward this Secret Great Definite Teaching. The practitioner thinks "this is just another philosophy, another technique" and fails to recognize its unique profundity. Without root meaning, dharmas are not gathered into rigpa—the teaching disperses into limitless unrelated topics, losing coherence. Without yoga meaning, vehicle distinctions are not divided—big and small ranks become meaningless, the hierarchical structure of the path collapses into confusion.

—

[63-85]
Without great meaning explained, toward Great Perfection without effort arises the defect of meaninglessness. The practitioner cannot comprehend how liberation can be effortless, how awakening can be natural. Without word meaning, when tantras are clearly ranked, the defect of not grasping letters arises—one cannot distinguish the subtle differences in terminology that carry profound significance. Well explained, all these defects are abandoned and all qualities become perfect.

—

[86-135]
The purpose: from Rigpa Rangdrol—to protect one's own view and to refute others' views. This is not aggression but clarity. When the view is clear, wrong views naturally fall away; when the light shines, darkness naturally dispels. Also called "to explain" because explanation illuminates what was obscure, reveals what was hidden, establishes what was uncertain. The explainer clarifies; the listener recognizes.

—

[136-185]
Extensively enumerated with certainty: twenty-three jewel examples, five chapters of the Wish-fulfilling Tree, twenty-eight methods.

The seven perfections establish the complete field of practice. The four types of tantra—creation, completion, union, Great Perfection—provide progressive paths. Method tantra and nature tantra present the two aspects of the teaching. Visualization and dedication complete the framework. May all who study this find recognition and liberation.
