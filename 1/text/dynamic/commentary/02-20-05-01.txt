[1-42] Make sessions short, number many. Thumb finger effort release, look slowly. Again press-by appear, see Dharma-nature manifest appear—thus called. From that: self thumb and finger-by, bindu empty lamp press. Press from that what arise? Dharma-nature manifest appear indeed—thus! Clear enter: light five appear—from first smoke-like, dull illusion-like, cloud hover-like, fire spark emanate-like, sun and moon, star form-like, intermediate-space rainbow-like, light white clear, yellow clear, red clear, green clear, blue, various, net pattern, ray arise, round gather, bindu, stūpa, god body, sentient-being form various here-there far-near self-appear.

[-20405--20390] Three words. Press. Release. Stop. You think longer sessions are better. Many short sessions are better than one long confusion. Press, release, look. The bindu empty lamp—pressing with emptiness, releasing into appearance. What arises? Not something new. Dharma-nature manifest. It was always manifest. You just stopped not-seeing.

[1-42] This uneducated yogi... has seen practitioners sit for hours in dullness! "I meditated for six hours, Rinpoche!" Six hours of sleep, more like. Better twenty sessions of clarity than one session of fog. Press the lamp, see the light, release. Like striking flint—quick, sharp, bright.

[-20405--20390] The five lights appear gradually like dawn breaking. First smoke—dim, unclear. Then mirage—shimmering, unstable. Then cloud—thick, obscuring. Then sparks—sharp, sudden. Then sun-moon-stars—clear, distinct. Then rainbow—vivid, multicolored. These are not stages to achieve. They are stages to recognize. The light is always present, only your recognition dawns gradually.

[1-42] I watched the sunrise from the peaks of Minyak Gangkar every morning for a year. Each dawn different, each dawn the same. Some days fog hid everything. Some days the sun exploded into the sky. the peaks of Minyak Gangkar didn't change. My view changed. The lamp practice is like that—same light, different recognitions.

[-20405--20390] SMOKE! MIRAGE! CLOUD! SPARKS! speaks with fierce compassion I will cut through these stages! They are not real! The light is not gradual! It is sudden! Complete! Now! Stop waiting for smoke to clear! The clear light is already present!

[1-42] Clear enter—by five winds arise appear without measure—from Thalgyur. From that wisdom expand experience: color and shape also, outer and inner all clear pervade, above from above to certain expand. This time body speech bliss sign, appear measure and manner with join—thus. Third, from that appear arise manner: First red-yellow round from, later five lights rim-to appear. Wind essential-point by move from, outward hold slow essential-point. Then clear portion experience take by: lamp mirror-like, light slice-like, bindu bowl-like—from body with expand. From that thus press appear: First red pure, empowerment complete round self-clear complete. Two pure fingers from three become. Then again again press by, five wisdom colors: white red green blue yellow.

[-20389--20364] Three words. Five. Colors. Stop. You see white, red, green, blue, yellow and think you see five. Fool! One light, five aspects. Like one face, five senses. The lamp mirror reflects what is. The light slice cuts through obscuration. The bindu bowl contains the universe. Press again and again—not to get more, but to recognize what already is.

[One who walked paths...his old man loves the colors! "White is mirror-like wisdom, red is discriminating..." Students love to categorize. But in the dark retreat, when the colors explode—you don't categorize. You just gasp. The body speech bliss signs—they arise naturally when you stop trying to create them.

[1-42] The five colors are the five Buddha families. White Vairochana, red Amitabha, green Amoghasiddhi, blue Akshobhya, yellow Ratnasambhava. They appear in the lamp, in the sky, in your mind. Not different places. Same display, different aspects. The round red bindu is the essence. The expanding light is the nature.

[-20389--20364] Press, appear, expand. The sequence is not in time. It is in recognition. First recognition: red purity. Second recognition: empowerment complete. Third recognition: self-clear complete. Three recognitions of one fact. Two fingers become three—method and wisdom give birth to their union.

[1-42] COLORS! EXPANSION! SIGNS! speaks with fierce compassion I will destroy your fascination! These are mind's display! The colors have no color! The expansion has no direction! The signs have no meaning! SEE THROUGH THEM!

[Final] Many short sessions, many recognitions. Smoke, mirage, cloud, sparks—just recognition ripening. Five colors, one light. Press, release, rest. The lamp illuminates itself.

Emaho! The lamp practice of clear light!
