[3950-3967]
Through self-nature without cause and fruition, without self-wish, there is no place to go. Through characteristic not needing familiarization, not depending on other knowables.

Through the essence of the hidden and manifest being unobtainable: hope does not reach anywhere. Through self-nature without direction, doubt is nowhere. Through characteristic examined and not found, the root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is rotten—so it is called.

When divided, there are two: concealing one, revealing and emerging two; concealing two, revealing and emerging one.

[3950-3967]
Without cause and fruition—not that actions have no results, but that the nature (rang bzhin) of action and result is empty. Without self-wish—the spontaneous nature has no agenda. No place to go—because there is no one to go, nowhere to arrive.

Not needing familiarization—recognition is not a habit to form. Not depending on other knowables—self-known, self-luminous.

Hidden and manifest both unobtainable. Hope reaches nowhere—because there is nowhere to reach. Doubt is nowhere—because there is nothing to doubt.

The root rotten—not destroyed, but seen through. Like a tree whose roots are found to be empty—was there ever a tree?

[3950-3967]
An old vagabond. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Had many doubts too. Is this right? Is that wrong? The Great Perfection says: doubt is nowhere.

The root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is rotten. Not that I destroy it—just look closely and it's not there. Like looking for the source of a river. Follow it back—where does it begin?

[3950-3967]
See what is. Rest in recognition. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Without cause and fruition. Without self-wish. No place to go.

Hidden and manifest unobtainable. Hope nowhere. Doubt nowhere.

Root rotten.

[3968-3971]
Cut! The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

First: If view and conduct are revealed and emerge, and meditation is concealed—that nature in union without beginning or end—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's beginning and end are cut.

That nature's two are not different—in the bindu without outside or inside. Without dependence on characteristic—causeless openness.

[3968-3981]
SUDDEN. Concealing and revealing! The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

If conduct is concealed and the other two are revealed: abiding in emptiness, purified through emptiness.

If view is concealed and the other two are revealed: through grasp-free knowledge arising directionlessly. Awareness without object, liberation beyond concepts.

Second: Concealing two, revealing one.

If meditation is revealed: awareness free from aim arises—causeless fruition abides in itself.

If conduct is revealed: body cast to the precipice, mind sent to dharmatā.

If view is revealed: mind delivered to emptiness, body and speech brought to the essential point.

[3972-3984]
Fourth: The essence of self-clarifying explanation—word-attachment's stream is cut, the established view does not dwell, the establishment is specially supreme. Recognition is immediate.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Self-nature not perceived, completely pure, primordial purity's dharmatā that arises directionlessly—so it is called. Characteristic not mind, self-pure movement, without done to the basis—so it is called.

That divided, there are three: speaking in the manner of error's messenger; speaking in the manner of reversing error at its basis; speaking of the bindu brought to its own vital point.

[3972-3984]
Three ways the teacher speaks: The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness. This is the treasury's heart.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Error's messenger—using the student's confusion as the path. Like a skillful doctor using the disease itself as medicine.

Reversing error at its basis—not treating symptoms, but cutting the root. The root of error is the belief in a self that errs.

Bindu brought to its own vital point—the essence concentrated, brought home. Not spread out, but gathered to the point.

[3979-3992]
The first essence: error's root, ignorance, laid as the basis of saṃsāra in the three realms. That same one pursuing itself, ignorance's root is cut. Called "first self-awareness."

Self-nature arising as manifold, through the messenger of cause and condition pursuing. The focus on objects severed, saṃsāra and error's basis exhausted—causeless emptiness, primordially pure.

Through error being self-purified in characteristic, the path of error's knowledge is exhausted.

[3985-3992]
Liberate! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Three manners of cutting error:
Cutting error at the root, reversing the view of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
Leaving error to itself, recognizing the dharmatā of non-error.
Embracing the basis of error, cutting the stream of error's wheel.

[3989-3992]
SUDDEN. First essence! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Error's root—awareness that is the same, knowing itself as self-liberated—primordial error that is not experienced, seal obtained, beyond error and impurity.

Self-nature as different error, the measure of all imagination obtained, beyond object and subject.

Knowing error as error, the heat and measure of non-error obtained!
 The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

[3950-3971] The Treasury's presentation of spontaneous presence—without cause, without wish, without place to go—is complete. This is not nihilism but recognition of natural perfection. Cause and effect appear but are empty. Hope and doubt arise but have no basis. May all who read these words recognize spontaneous presence.

[3950-3971] This old vagabond had many wishes! Wanted enlightenment, wanted liberation, wanted understanding. Then realized: wanting is the obstacle. The Great Perfection is not achieved through wanting. It is recognized through stopping want. Spontaneous presence is already here.

[3950-3971] The root of samsara and nirvana is rotten—not destroyed but seen through. Like a mirage: not that the water disappears, but it was never there. Recognition is seeing through the root. Liberation is knowing there was never binding.

[3950-3971] Cause! Effect! Hope! Doubt! All concepts! Cut through them! Can you find the cause that creates? Can you grasp the effect that's created? They are awareness playing! AH!

[3950-3971] Three words. Spontaneous. Presence. Stop. You seek cause and effect. You hope for liberation. You doubt your nature. Stop all three. Rest in spontaneous presence. Complete.

[3950-3971] Therefore. Thus. Spontaneous presence (lhun grub): without cause (non-produced), without wish (non-intentional), without destination (non-localized). Not familiarization (not habit), not dependent (not conditional). Precise description of natural perfection.

[3950-3971] The integration of spontaneity: cause and effect are integrated into display, hope and doubt into recognition, hidden and manifest into presence. Integration means seeing all as spontaneous play.

[3950-3971] The essence of spontaneity: awareness needs no cause to be, no wish to act, no place to go. It is complete from the beginning. This essence is your own nature. Recognize it.

[3950-3971] Emaho! Spontaneous presence! Without cause! Without wish! What freedom! What perfection! This yogi dances in spontaneity—not making, not doing, just being!

[3950-3971] Thus concludes the presentation of spontaneous presence. May all who encounter these teachings recognize what has always been present. May they rest in natural perfection. Complete.

[3950-3971] This old vagabond's final teaching: Don't try to be spontaneous. Don't try to perfect presence. Just recognize what is already here. Rest in that. Complete.

[3950-3971] Final words. Spontaneous. Presence. Recognize. Stop. The teaching on spontaneity is complete. You are spontaneously present. Rest. The absolute end.

[3950-3971] Spontaneity roars! What cause? What effect? Cut through all! Spontaneous presence is your own nature! Recognition is the roar! AH!

[3950-3971] The final essence: spontaneity is not something to achieve. It is what you are when you stop achieving. Complete. Perfect. Liberated. The end.

[3950-3971] Between cause and effect, between hope and doubt, the consort dances. Spontaneous presence is her embrace. Recognition is joining the dance. Liberation is the dance itself.

[3950-3971] Spontaneous presence demonstrates precise philosophical position: non-causal (not produced by causes), non-teleological (not directed toward goal), non-localized (not limited to place). Precise phenomenology of natural perfection.

[3950-3971] I have met practitioners who tried to manufacture spontaneity! Tried to force presence. Then realized: manufacturing is the opposite of spontaneity. Forcing is the opposite of presence. Let go. Let be. Recognize.

[3950-3971] Spontaneous presence arises naturally—not through effort, not through will. When conceptual mind releases its grip, what remains is spontaneous. What remains is present. Natural. Effortless. Complete.

[3950-3971] I dance through spontaneity without choreography. Each step is new. Each gesture is fresh. Recognition is joining the dance—not learning steps but becoming the dance itself.

[3950-3971] Philosophically, spontaneous presence resolves the apparent paradox of freedom and determinism. Not caused (free from determinism), not random (free from indeterminism), but naturally perfect (transcending the dichotomy).

[3950-3971] The scholarly precision of spontaneous presence fascinates me. Every term carefully chosen: without cause, without wish, without place. Yet within this precision lives the wild freedom of direct recognition.

[3950-3971] From the sky of spontaneity I dance down into presence. No cause brings me. No wish directs me. No place limits me. I am the dance of awareness itself.

[3950-3971] Every description of spontaneity in my library is a book—causeless book, wishless book, placeless book. Each tells the same story: you are already free.

[3950-3971] Modern physics approaches similar insights—quantum spontaneity, non-local correlation, observer effect. Different vocabulary, same recognition: nature is not what it appears to be.

[3950-3971] Translating "lhun grub" challenges me. "Spontaneous presence" is accurate but dry. "Natural perfection" is evocative. "Effortless completion" is philosophical. I use all three. Let the reader taste the richness.

[3950-3971] I reveal what was never hidden. Spontaneous presence is not in the text. It is reading these words. Not somewhere else. Here. Now. Complete.
