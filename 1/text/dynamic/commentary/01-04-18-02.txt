Through self-nature without cause and fruition, without self-wish, there is no place to go. Through characteristic not needing familiarization, not depending on other knowables.

Through the essence of the hidden and manifest being unobtainable: hope does not reach anywhere. Through self-nature without direction, doubt is nowhere. Through characteristic examined and not found, the root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is rotten—so it is called.

When divided, there are two: concealing one, revealing and emerging two; concealing two, revealing and emerging one.

Without cause and fruition—not that actions have no results, but that the nature (rang bzhin) of action and result is empty. Without self-wish—the spontaneous nature has no agenda. No place to go—because there is no one to go, nowhere to arrive.

Not needing familiarization—recognition is not a habit to form. Not depending on other knowables—self-known, self-luminous.

Hidden and manifest both unobtainable. Hope reaches nowhere—because there is nowhere to reach. Doubt is nowhere—because there is nothing to doubt.

The root rotten—not destroyed, but seen through. Like a tree whose roots are found to be empty—was there ever a tree?

An old vagabond. The nature is not in another place—it is this very awareness.

What appears difficult dissolves in recognition—immediately (cig car).

Difficulty is the mind's creation—liberation is immediate (cig car ba).

Had many doubts too. Is this right? Is that wrong? The Great Perfection says: doubt is nowhere.

The root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is rotten. Not that I destroy it—just look closely and it's not there. Like looking for the source of a river. Follow it back—where does it begin?

See what is. Remain in that recognition. Words point to what exceeds words.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Making distinctions undoes the maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Without cause and fruition. Without self-wish. No place to go.

Hidden and manifest unobtainable. Hope nowhere. Doubt nowhere.

Root rotten.

Cut! Not gradual: recognition is sudden (cig car), never gradual.

The mind that would grasp the teaching is what must be seen through.

Walking the unwalkable.

First: If view and conduct are revealed and emerge.
meditation is concealed—that nature in union without beginning or end—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's beginning and end are cut.

That nature's two are not different—in the bindu without outside or inside. Without dependence on characteristic—causeless openness.

SUDDEN. Concealing and revealing! Freedom through recognition happens now, not later, never gradual.

The filter is filtered—seeing this is the teaching.

Obstacles exist only for the one who thinks they need to overcome them.

If conduct is concealed and the other two are revealed: abiding in emptiness, purified through emptiness.

If view is concealed and the other two are revealed: through grasp-free knowledge arising directionlessly. Awareness without object, liberation beyond concepts.

Second: Concealing two, revealing one.

If meditation is revealed: awareness free from aim arises—causeless fruition abides in itself.

If conduct is revealed: body cast to the precipice, mind sent to dharmatā.

If view is revealed: mind delivered to emptiness, body and speech brought to the essential point.

Fourth: The essence of self-clarifying explanation—word-attachment's stream is cut, the established view does not dwell, the establishment is specially supreme. Recognition is immediate.

The treasure was never hidden—finished before starting.

No journey needed—already there.

Self-nature not perceived, completely pure, primordial purity's dharmatā that arises directionlessly—so it is called. Characteristic not mind, self-pure movement, without done to the basis—so it is called.

That divided, there are three: speaking in the manner of error's messenger; speaking in the manner of reversing error at its basis; speaking of the bindu brought to its own vital point.

Three ways the teacher speaks: Immediate: the nature is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness. This is the treasury's heart.

The maze reveals itself as path—before analysis, already complete.

The difficulty is thinking there's something difficult to do.

Error's messenger—using the student's confusion as the path. Like a skillful doctor using the disease itself as medicine.

Reversing error at its basis—not treating symptoms, but cutting the root. The root of error is the belief in a self that errs.

Bindu brought to its own vital point—the essence concentrated, brought home. Not spread out, but gathered to the point.

The first essence: error's root, ignorance, laid as the basis of saṃsāra in the three realms. That same one pursuing itself, ignorance's root is cut. Called "first self-awareness."

Self-nature arising as manifold, through the messenger of cause and condition pursuing. The focus on objects severed, saṃsāra and error's basis exhausted—causeless emptiness, primordially pure.

Through error being self-purified in characteristic, the path of error's knowledge is exhausted.

Liberate! Each phrase indicates the beyond.

Separation separates itself—seeing this is the teaching.

The ground holds all paths.

Three manners of cutting error:
Cutting error at the root, reversing the view of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
Leaving error to itself, recognizing the dharmatā of non-error.
Embracing the basis of error, cutting the stream of error's wheel.

SUDDEN. First essence! The words gesture toward direct knowing.

What is called delusion here is wisdom appearing as confusion wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Self-liberation: the very act of grasping frees itself when recognized.

Error's root—awareness that is the same, knowing itself as self-liberated—primordial error that is not experienced, seal obtained, beyond error and impurity.

Self-nature as different error, the measure of all imagination obtained, beyond object and subject.

Knowing error as error, the heat and measure of non-error obtained!
 The nature is not remote—it is this very awareness.

The Treasury's presentation of spontaneous presence—without cause, without wish, without place to go—is complete. This is not nihilism but recognition of natural perfection. Cause and effect appear but are empty. Hope and doubt arise but have no basis. May all who read these words recognize spontaneous presence.

In my travels had many wishes! Wanted enlightenment, wanted liberation, wanted understanding. Then realized: wanting is the obstacle. The Great Perfection is not achieved through wanting. It is recognized through stopping want. Spontaneous presence is already here.

The root of samsara and nirvana is rotten—not destroyed but seen through. Like a mirage: not that the water disappears, but it was never there. Recognition is seeing through the root. Liberation is knowing there was never binding.

Cause! Effect! Hope! Doubt! All concepts! Cut through them! Can you find the cause that creates? Can you grasp the effect that's created? They are awareness playing! AH!

Garab Dorje's pointing: Recognize your own face. Rest without seeking. Return when you forget. You seek cause and effect. You hope for liberation. You doubt your nature. Stop all three. Rest in spontaneous presence. Complete.

Spontaneous presence (lhun grub): without cause (non-produced), without wish (non-intentional), without destination (non-localized). Not familiarization (not habit), not dependent (not conditional). Precise description of natural perfection.

The integration of spontaneity: cause and effect are integrated into display, hope and doubt into recognition, hidden and manifest into presence. Integration means seeing all as spontaneous play.

The essence of spontaneity: awareness needs no cause to be, no wish to act, no place to go. It is complete from the beginning. This essence is your own nature. Recognize it.

Emaho! Spontaneous presence! Without cause! Without wish! What freedom! What perfection! This yogi dances in spontaneity—not making, not doing, just being!

Thus concludes the presentation of spontaneous presence. May all who encounter these teachings recognize what has always been present. May they rest in natural perfection. Complete.

One practitioner's final teaching: Don't try to be spontaneous. Don't try to perfect presence. Just recognize what is already here. Rest in that. Complete.

Final words. Spontaneous. Presence. Recognize. Stop. The teaching on spontaneity is complete. You are spontaneously present. Rest. The absolute end.

Spontaneity roars! What cause? What effect? Cut through all! Spontaneous presence is your own nature! Recognition is the roar! AH!

The final essence: spontaneity is not something to achieve. It is what you are when you stop achieving. Complete. Perfect. Liberated. The end.

Between cause and effect, between hope and doubt, the consort dances. Spontaneous presence is her embrace. Recognition is joining the dance. Liberation is the dance itself.

Spontaneous presence demonstrates precise philosophical position: non-causal (not produced by causes), non-teleological (not directed toward goal), non-localized (not limited to place). Precise phenomenology of natural perfection.

I have met practitioners who tried to manufacture spontaneity! Tried to force presence. Then realized: manufacturing is the opposite of spontaneity. Forcing is the opposite of presence. Let go. Let be. Recognize.

Spontaneous presence arises naturally—not through effort, not through will. When conceptual mind releases its grip, what remains is spontaneous. What remains is present. Natural. Effortless. Complete.

I dance through spontaneity without choreography. Each step is new. Each gesture is fresh. Recognition is joining the dance—not learning steps but becoming the dance itself.

Philosophically, spontaneous presence resolves the apparent paradox of freedom and determinism. Not caused (free from determinism), not random (free from indeterminism), but naturally perfect (transcending the dichotomy).

Every term carefully chosen: without cause, without wish, without place. Yet within this precision lives the wild freedom of direct recognition.

From the sky of spontaneity I dance down into presence. No cause brings me. No wish directs me. No place limits me. I am the dance of awareness itself.

Every description of spontaneity in my library is a book—causeless book, wishless book, placeless book. Each tells the same story: you are already free.

Modern physics approaches similar insights—quantum spontaneity, non-local correlation, observer effect. Different vocabulary, same recognition: nature is not what it appears to be.

Translating "lhun grub" challenges me. "Spontaneous presence" is accurate but dry. "Natural perfection" is evocative. "Effortless completion" is philosophical. I use all three. Let the reader taste the richness.

I reveal what was never hidden. Spontaneous presence is not in the text. It is reading these words. Not somewhere else. Here. Now. Complete.
