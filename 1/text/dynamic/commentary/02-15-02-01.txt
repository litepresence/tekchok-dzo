Five life-holding winds from the Self-Arisen Tantra—listen closely now. Root-holding life, protecting life, spreading life, impure life, shattering life. Each abides in the heart, connected to awareness essence like a lamp in a dark cave illuminating its own nature. This old mountain dweller watched the breath for years before seeing—life wind is not breath itself, but what moves it. The difference between ordinary breathing and wisdom wind? Recognition alone.

The life wind potential relies on and abides in awareness potential. This is crucial: the vital energy and awareness are intimately connected. In sequence: producing awareness potential, producing bindhu potential, producing light potential, holding the root of non-awareness, acting as helper to mind. Five functions, five aspects, one essential point.

Five fire-equal winds—wind separating clear from impure, producing warmth, clear-change, gathering distinctions, making praise. These support the digestive fire and transformative processes. They abide nondual with life, awareness, lamp, bindhu, wisdom. Not separate entities, friend—like sunlight and warmth, inseparable in experience.

See what is. The fire-equal wind in your belly right now—digesting food, generating warmth—that's wisdom's display. No need to create it. Recognize what already burns. In sequence: nondual with life, nondual with awareness, nondual with lamp, nondual with bindhu, nondual with wisdom. Fivefold nonduality pointing to one recognition.

Color-and-radiance-producing winds now—consciousness-producing, mind-arising, possessing radiance, burning, wildness. Their objects: wisdom object, appearing object, lamp object, non-awareness object, mind's object. Like five horses carrying awareness to various pastures.

This very clarity in your eyes, this radiance of perception—wind and light dancing. The wildness is not chaos; it's unbounded movement, freedom itself. In sequence: wisdom's object, appearing's object, lamp's object, non-awareness's object, mind's object as the horse that carries. Five objects, one awareness.

Five all-pervading winds—pervading the base, pervading immediately, pervading hatred and fear, pervading memory, pervading all body by holding. They appear in wisdom, lamp, knowing, thinking, mind's potency.

The base is pervaded—can you find a corner where awareness does not reach? Immediately pervaded—no delay, no distance. Even fear and hatred are pervaded, not rejected. This is the all-pervading nature of wind wisdom. They appear in: wisdom, lamp, knowing, thinking, mind's potency performing power.

Five compassionless karma winds—making movement, making liberation, making reversal, making swiftness, wind of moments. They pervade aggregates, instantaneous time, bardo, concepts, three: moments, actions, completion.

These are the most subtle, connected with death and transition. The wind of moments—can you catch a moment? It is already gone. Yet this very wind carries awareness through all transitions, all changes, all births and deaths. Pervading: aggregates, moments, bardo, concepts, completion of moments, actions, completion.

Twenty-five winds gather into five roots. The etymology from Self-Arisen reveals their nature: "Move-making wind"—because it makes movement on true ground; "Life-holding wind"—because it holds life of pure wisdom; "Color-radiance wind"—because it's the self-nature of five wisdom lights; "Compassionless karma wind"—because it can liberate into wisdom's true dimension; "Fire-equal wind"—because it abides without gathering or separating from wisdom's appearing.

In the five essence winds, wisdom's self-sound-potential clears as five lights. When awareness separates from wind, wisdom dimension gathers. The non-manifest outer and inner arrives at the essential point of pure wind-mind. This is describing the completion stage realization where wind and mind merge into wisdom.

Here is the heart essence in brief. That awareness jewel of yours—primordially pure essence abiding in the secret cavity, palace of luminous self-nature. This body, this mind—that is the palace. Essence, nature, compassion—inseparable, abiding as one. Don't go hunting for a palace somewhere else!

When essence abides as kaya, it is self-clear, appearing as outer-kaya from a base that never stops. Your nature is where five lights arise, where life wind moves, where four branches dance. Primordially abiding as essence of speech. Compassion is self-arisen awareness, spontaneously complete. The wisdom of two-knowing—abiding without shift, without separation of kaya and wisdom. Stop trying to unite what was never apart!

Two knowings: depending on inner-clear essence of dharmata—everything known. Depending on outer-clear aspect of appearance—all aspects known. One awareness, two ways of shining. Like one sun illuminating both inside and outside the house. Not two different knowers—one awareness, two modes of expression.

Five winds—the root life wind, portion of compassion awareness wisdom. If pure, Buddha wisdom. If impure, base of sentient beings' confused aggregates. Same wind, different recognition. The difference between buddha and sentient being isn't in the wind itself—it's in whether you recognize what it is!

From that root, four branch winds emanate like rays from the sun—that's compassion's potency displaying. Upward-going wisdom horse, downward-clearing wisdom ray, fire-equal ripening power, all-pervading completing power. These four aren't somewhere else—they exist only in the portion of life wind itself. In dharmadhatu, they don't emanate out. They abide only as essence, non-ceasing base of display, essence branch clear as light. Not going anywhere, not coming from anywhere.

Kunsel teaches: kaya abides like form-reflection of empty-luminous bubble. Speech abides like fire spark rays in the expanse of awareness. Mind's clear nature is life wind itself, like wisdom fire sparks without falling in any direction, abiding as five wisdoms. And all of this—wisdom that no concept can deceive. Not your thinking mind, friend. Wisdom itself, beyond the reach of your clever ideas!

Emaho! What a wonder!

What is described cannot be fixed or altered. Cannot grab by the face, cannot mark with labels. Like trying to catch sky in hands, pin down earth under feet. It's clear yet subtle, like fire sparks dancing behind five lights. This is dharmakaya, heart essence of dharmadhatu. It abides as awareness itself, holding the basis of everything. Don't look for it somewhere else—it's what's reading these words right now!

The palace where it abides—dharmadhatu, empty and all-pervading like space. When dharmakaya abides in the precious cavity, it's called pure original tone of dharmata. Awareness possessing house of light, abiding in light's display. This is primordial common basis, expanse of awareness—how five winds connect and establish meaning. Not separate from you, friend. Never was.

Five fires from Self-Arising Tantra—fire pervading all outer and inner, fire illuminating all outer and inner, fire equalizing all outer and inner, fire of concept in outer and inner actions, fire accomplishing outer and inner actions. Where do these fires live? In your lungs, your eyes, your five limbs—six locations. In gaps of your flesh, soles of your feet, your palms. They produce warmth. Feel your hands right now—that warmth? That's wisdom displaying!

Five earths now, from same source—all-illuminating earth, unchanging vajra earth, precious earth from which all arise, all-pervading earth showing appearances, earth of perfected accomplishment. These aren't separate things somewhere else. Together with awareness, lamp, thigle, wisdom, discriminating awareness—they abide in reliance. Everything interconnected, everything supporting everything else. Like net of jewels reflecting each other!

Five waters from Self-Arising—unchanging water, peaceful clear pure water, water of extensively arising qualities, water without attachment, water of completion without grasping. Connected with all channels. Your whole body is a mandala—every part resonating with elemental wisdom. These aren't five different waters in some external ocean. They're the wisdom-qualities of fluidity itself: unchanging, peaceful, extensive, unattached, complete.

Five waters continue—together with all your bones, all your blood, all your lymph. They abide in your two eyes, moistening everything without holding to any fixed essence. This is nature of water wisdom—not grasping, just flowing, just nourishing. Feel that moisture in your eyes right now? That's not just biology, friend—that's wisdom displaying as bodily function!

Five spaces from Self-Arising Tantra—space pervading all in common, space of clear tone without object, pure unmixed space, space indicating meaning, space liberating into pure field. Connected with actual awareness, five lights, lamp of pure expanse, wisdom of signs, twenty-one pointing-out instructions. Certain confidence in example and meaning—this is what points you to what's already here!

Five elements' awareness attributes summarized—they're great elements. Their basis is small elements. This completes fifteenth division: Showing Place of Elements. Don't think you're done learning—this was just foundation for what comes next!

Now that elements established as basis, we move to fourfold purity of what's supported—expanse and wisdom: basis as kayas, tone as light, supported as wisdom, activities as enlightened actions. Structure: foundation first, then what rests upon it. Don't try to understand kayas without understanding what they rest upon!

Kayas—two aspects: general presentation of three kayas' expanse, five kayas' enumeration explained in particular. This is how supported arises from support, how wisdom manifests through elements. The structure is precise: from elements arise kayas, from kayas arise wisdoms, from wisdoms arise enlightened activities. Complete mandala of manifestation.

Thus the twenty-five winds, five elements, and their subtle connections. This body is not mere flesh—it is wisdom's mandala, element's palace, wind's dance. Recognition transforms anatomy into path. Every wind, every element, every quality—wisdom's display awaiting recognition.

Three words strike the vital point: Recognize. Rest. Return. Stop. Rest in what reads these words. The teaching on subtle body is complete.
