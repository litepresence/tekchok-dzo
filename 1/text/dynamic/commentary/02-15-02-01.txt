[1-195]
Five life-holding winds from the Self-Arisen Tantra—listen closely now. Root-holding life, protecting life, spreading life, impure life, shattering life. Each abides in the heart, connected to awareness essence like a lamp in a dark cave illuminating its own nature. This old mountain dweller watched the breath for years before seeing—life wind is not breath itself, but what moves it. The difference between ordinary breathing and wisdom wind? Recognition alone.

The life wind potential relies on and abides in awareness potential. This is vital: the vital energy and awareness are intimately connected. In sequence: producing awareness potential, producing bindhu potential, producing light potential, holding the root of non-awareness, acting as helper to mind. Five functions, five aspects, one essential point.
