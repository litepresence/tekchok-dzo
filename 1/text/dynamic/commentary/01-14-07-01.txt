First: light curtain arises. Initial thogal vision—field of light becoming
apparent. Like pink-gray before dawn—not yet color, but promise night ends.
Water-lamp beginning to manifest.

[19406-19407]
This hermit remembers first glimpse—shimmer at edge of vision. Thought eyes
were tired, rubbed them, shimmer remained. Curtain parts, what was always
behind is seen.

[19408-19409]
Not barrier but display. Like morning mist—apparently obscuring, actually
revealing. Light that seems to veil is light that illuminates.

[19410-19411]
It arises. You see. That's your nature. Three words? Maybe two: seeing
happens. Or one: This.

[19412-19413]
Already seeing—most important. You don't need to learn to see light curtain.
Recognize you're already seeing it. Like noticing you've been breathing.
