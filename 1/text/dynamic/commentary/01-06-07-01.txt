[8687-8692] First, regarding the Mudra: when one has not actually engaged through methods of channel generation and so forth, this is not the time for ordinary desire to flow through one's own continuum—therefore it is called the time of shifting the View. Without the flow of ordinary desire, the bliss depending upon one's own body arises without the mind having power over it.

[8687-8692] Here's the secret—don't force the bliss. It arises naturally when the channels are pure. The old way tries to generate bliss through effort. The dzogchen way waits for the natural arising. Like a lotus blooming in its own time—not by being told to bloom.

[8693-8696] Then, as the actual body extends and Bodhicitta is held, at the time when purification has not yet occurred, special bliss arises; yet the experience is not mixed with one's own continuum, and since emptiness is not recognized as mind, the mind itself is understood merely as empty. At the time when ordinary conceptions do not exist in one's own mind whatsoever, this is called the time of obtaining the View.

[8693-8696] Three words. Shift. Obtain. Stable. First you shift the view from ordinariness. Then you obtain the view as your own nature. Then you stabilize in that view. But there is no "you" doing the shifting. The view shifts itself. Recognition recognizes itself.

[8697-8702] Then, when Bodhicitta is purified and extended to the measure of arrival, as the channels spread and the Mahamudra of non-duality of body and mind is experienced—transcending the intellect—this is called the time of stable View. However this is done, through obtaining power over Bodhicitta, there is no change itself. Shifting, obtaining, and stability—these proceed to the ground of the Three Kayas.

[8697-8702] Look at this progression. Is there a mover? Is there a moved? The shifting is not done by you. The obtaining is not something you get. The stability is not a state you hold. The Three Kayas are not somewhere you go. They are what you are when recognition recognizes itself.

[8703-8715] Thirteenth: Thus, having recognized the View, arranging the channel apertures and mixing with the winds, the body strength expands and one joins with ultimate Bodhicitta. When samadhi tires, draw upward; at this time, holding the fist and turning the eyes upward, pressing the wind inside and blocking the channel aperture definitively. Through holding the wind power inside, mixing with the wind and not letting it go inside, body strength expands and so forth arises. As this mixes with bodhicitta and does not come outside, it is a sign of non-extension—like the juice of pounded acacia, it will not come forth even when rubbed with sesame oil.

[8703-8715] This is practical advice for the yogi. When the meditation tires, draw the wind upward. Hold the fist, turn the eyes, press the wind inside. The bindu mixes with bodhicitta and doesn't escape—like gum in the socket. This is the sign of progress. Without this key, relying on Action Mudra alone, the bindu strays and disease arises. Vomiting in reverse, tongue contracting, blue water dripping—the obstacles are real. Know the method to dispel them.

[8716-8720] The method to dispel this: turn the body like a firebrand and speak "Hrim Hrim" with the speech; place the mind at the center of the fire; abandon alcohol and throw salt broth; eat three white foods and liberation is certain.

[8716-8720] The body turns like a firebrand—the flame whirls but the fire doesn't move. The speech speaks "Hrim Hrim"—the seed syllable of all existence. The mind rests at the center of the fire—the central channel where all winds meet. Abandon alcohol, the confusion of mind. Throw salt broth—the impurities of the stomach. Eat three white foods—rice, barley, wheat—the triple grain of purity. Liberation follows naturally.

[8721-8723] Fourteenth: For the benefit of the student, turn the Bhaga upward three times; at this time, emitting the sound "OM AH HUM" is the key for the blessings of the Three Kayas to enter body, speech, and mind. Regarding that, first: mixing with the Guru's body, the student's body becomes self-natured.

[8721-8723] Three words. Turn. Emit. Mix. The Bhaga—the secret center—turns upward three times. The sound "OM AH HUM"—body, speech, mind—arises. The student mixes with the guru's body. The student becomes the guru. There is no student. There is no guru. There is only recognition.

[Final] The View shifts, obtains, and stabilizes. The body extends. The channels spread. The bindu mingles with bodhicitta. The Three Kayas enter body, speech, mind. The path is complete. The fruit is certain.

Emaho! The mudra of transformation! The key of the guru's blessing! The sound that shakes the three worlds!

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known. The treasury is complete.
