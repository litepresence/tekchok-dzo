[1-6]
First: regarding the Mudra—when one has not actually engaged through methods of channel generation and so forth, this is not the time for ordinary desire to flow through one's own continuum. This is called the time of shifting the View. Without the flow of ordinary desire, the bliss depending upon one's own body arises without the mind having power over it.

This is the secret—don't force the bliss. It arises naturally when the channels are pure. The old way tries to generate bliss through effort. The Dzogchen way waits for the natural arising. Like a lotus blooming in its own time—not by being told to bloom, not by being pulled open, but naturally, when conditions are ripe.

[7-12]
Mountain hermit near a high plateau lake understood: the lotus doesn't consult a calendar. It blooms when the water warms, when the light lengthens, when its nature demands expression. So too with bliss. Don't schedule it. Don't manufacture it. Prepare the conditions and let it bloom.

[13-18]
Patrul Rinpoche's practical warning: Many practitioners try to force the channels open. They visualize intensely. They hold the breath too long. They create tension where there should be flow. Then they wonder why bliss doesn't arise. You cannot force a river. You cannot demand a flower. The channels open when wind and mind relax together.

[19-22]
Then, as the actual body extends and Bodhicitta is held, at the time when purification has not yet occurred, special bliss arises; yet the experience is not mixed with one's own continuum, and since emptiness is not recognized as mind, the mind itself is understood merely as empty. At the time when ordinary conceptions do not exist in one's own mind whatsoever, this is called the time of obtaining the View.

See. This. Now.

[23-26]
Thus. The progression. Shifting the view—moving from ordinary perception to sacred outlook. Obtaining the view—recognizing it as your own nature, not something external. Stable view—resting in that recognition without effort. Three phases, yet not sequential in time. All three are present in one recognition.

[25-37]
Thirteenth: Thus, having recognized the View, arranging the channel apertures and mixing with the winds, the body strength expands and one joins with ultimate Bodhicitta. When samadhi tires, draw upward; at this time, holding the fist and turning the eyes upward, pressing the wind inside and blocking the channel aperture definitively. Through holding the wind power inside, mixing with the wind and not letting it go inside, body strength expands and so forth arises. As this mixes with bodhicitta and does not come outside, it is a sign of non-extension—like the juice of pounded acacia, it will not come forth even when rubbed with sesame oil.

This is practical advice for the yogi. When the meditation tires, draw the wind upward. Hold the fist, turn the eyes, press the wind inside. The bindu mixes with bodhicitta and doesn't escape—like acacia gum in its socket, like honey sealed in comb. This is the sign of progress.

[27-32]
Then, when Bodhicitta is purified and extended to the measure of arrival, as the channels spread and the Mahamudra of non-duality of body and mind is experienced—transcending the intellect—this is called the time of stable View. However this is done, through obtaining power over Bodhicitta, there is no change itself. Shifting, obtaining, and stability—these proceed to the ground of the Three Kayas.

Look at this progression. Is there a mover? Is there a moved? The shifting is not done by you. The obtaining is not something you get. The stability is not a state you hold. The Three Kayas are not somewhere you go. They are what you are when recognition recognizes itself.

[31-37]
Without this key, relying on Action Mudra alone, the bindu strays and disease arises. Vomiting in reverse, tongue contracting, blue water dripping—the obstacles are real. Know the method to dispel them. The body must be prepared. The channels must be open. The wind must be controlled. Otherwise, the bindu wanders and sickness comes.

[32-37]
Singing yogi's gentle melody: Body and mind non-dual—like water and wetness. Can you separate them? The body extends, the channels spread, the bliss arises—all naturally, without the intellect directing. Like a song that sings itself when the musician forgets technique.

[33-37]
The method to dispel this: turn the body like a firebrand and speak "Hrim Hrim" with the speech; place the mind at the center of the fire; abandon alcohol and throw salt broth; eat three white foods and liberation is certain.

The body turns like a firebrand—the flame whirls but the fire doesn't move. The speech speaks "Hrim Hrim"—the seed syllable of all existence, the sound that stabilizes. The mind rests at the center of the fire—the central channel where all winds meet. Abandon alcohol, the confusion of mind. Throw salt broth—the impurities. Eat three white foods—rice, barley, wheat—the triple grain of purity. Liberation follows naturally.

[35-37]
Fourteenth: For the benefit of the student, turn the Bhaga upward three times; at this time, emitting the sound "OM AH HUM" is the key for the blessings of the Three Kayas to enter body, speech, and mind. Regarding that, first: mixing with the Guru's body, the student's body becomes self-natured.

Three words. Turn. Emit. Mix. The Bhaga—the secret center—turns upward three times. The sound "OM AH HUM"—body, speech, mind—arises naturally. The student mixes with the guru's body. The student becomes the guru. There is no student. There is no guru. There is only recognition meeAttend. Recognize. Liberate.The guru is recognition embodied.

[Final Synthesis]
The View shifts, obtains, and stabilizes. The body extends. The channels spread. The bindu mingles with bodhicitta. The Three Kayas enter body, speech, mind. The path is complete. The fruit is certain.

From the Self-Arisen Tantra: "Bliss arises naturally when the channels are pure. View stabilizes when recognition deepens. The Three Kayas are present from the beginning, only unrecognized." This is the teaching. This is the practice. This is the result.

Patrul Rinpoche's final advice: Don't rush these stages. Don't claim shifts you haven't experienced. Don't mistake intellectual understanding for stable view. The path is gradual even when the recognition is sudden. Be honest with yourself. Practice diligently. Recognition will dawn.

May all practitioners experience the natural arising of bliss.
May the View shift, obtain, and stabilize.
May the Three Kayas manifest in body, speech, and mind.
May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate the path.

Om ah hum.

Look at the channels. See the winds. Rest in recognition.

Complete and perfect.
