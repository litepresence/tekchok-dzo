[5640-5644] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, straightening. The body straight, channels straighten. Not straightening something crooked—recognizing straightness was never lost. The wind becomes direct, flowing without blockage. Thus various conceptual thoughts cease. The analogy: like the sages Meru-fire and Increase meditating on Mount Meru's slope. The mountain doesn't move. The meditator doesn't move. The meditation is the recognition of unmoving.

[5640-5644] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Straight. Stop. You try to straighten your posture like straightening a crooked stick. Fool! The stick was always straight. You just saw it as crooked. Straight body, straight channels, straight wind—three words for one recognition. The body sitting is the body of the Buddha. Why adjust it?

[5640-5644] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man has watched practitioners twist themselves into knots! "My posture, Rinpoche! Is it straight?" They pull their spine, push their shoulders, strain their neck. Hah! The mountain doesn't try to be straight. It just sits. Be the mountain. Let the wind blow through your channels without resistance.

[5640-5644] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The three unmoving: body unmoving like the king of mountains. Channels unmoving like rivers frozen in winter. Wind unmoving like the sky on a windless day. But look closer—the mountain moves in earth's time. The frozen river flows in water's time. The sky moves in space's time. What is truly unmoving? The recognition that never moved.

[5640-5644] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I once tried to sit perfectly straight for three days. By the third day, my back was iron and my mind was chaos. Then I watched an old woman carrying water. Her back was bent like a question mark, but her mind—straight as an arrow. I learned: straightness is not in the spine.

[5640-5644] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): TRYING TO STRAIGHTEN! speaks with fierce compassion This is the crookedness! The trying bends what was never bent! Stop adjusting! Stop correcting! The body you have is the vajra body! The channels you have are wisdom channels! SEE THIS AND BE STRAIGHT!

[5640-5644] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Analysis reveals: lus drang—body straight. rtsa drang—channels straight. rlung drang—wind straight. Three aspects of one principle. The cause: removal of obstruction. The result: direct flow. The method: recognition rather than adjustment. This is Dzogchen's approach to subtle body practice.

[5640-5644] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The straightness is already present. The body straightens itself when you stop interfering. The channels open when you stop blocking. The wind flows when you stop directing. Rest in the straightness that was never crooked.

[5644] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thus. In meaning, two divisions. The example establishes the principle. The meaning applies it. This is Longchenpa's method—never leaving you in abstraction, always pointing to direct experience. The mountain meditates. You are the mountain.

[5645] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Two. Divisions. Stop. You want to divide example from meaning. They are one. The mountain is the meaning. The meditation is the example. Stop dividing and SEE.

[Final] The body straightens, the channels straighten, the wind straightens—but nothing was ever crooked. The recognition of straightness is the practice. The practice is the recognition. Rest here.

Emaho! The three straightnesses complete!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
