[5640-5644] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First: straightening. Body straight, channels straight. Wind direct. Thus thoughts cease. Like a mountain—straight, unmoving. Straighten body, straighten channels, direct wind. Thoughts stop naturally.

[5640-5644] Voice 13 (Patrul): Body straight, channels straight, wind direct. Like a tree growing toward the sun. Thoughts cease not by fighting but by straightening.

[5640-5644] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Straighten. Direct. Stop.

[Final] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First—straighten. Body, channels, wind. Thoughts cease.

Emaho!
