First: straightening the body. When body is straight, channels become straight. When channels are straight, wind flows directly. When wind flows directly, various conceptual thoughts cease.

This is illustrated by example: like sages Meditation-Sage and Expansion on the face of Mount Meru, the manner of meditating in equipoise. Straighten body, straighten channels, direct wind. Thoughts stop naturally—not by fighting but by alignment.

Consider a tree growing toward the sun. It does not struggle to reach light; it simply grows straight. So too with body and mind—straighten the posture.
awareness naturally rises.

Hence: Body straight, channels straight, wind direct. The three straightened, thoughts cease. This is the foundation of meditation posture.

Three words from Oddiyana: Recognition. Determination. Returning. When body finds its natural alignment, mind follows. No need to force thoughts away—they dissolve in the spaciousness of straightened channels.

Therefore. The teaching on straightening is complete. Body like mountain, channels like streams, wind like breath of space. Rest in natural alignment.
