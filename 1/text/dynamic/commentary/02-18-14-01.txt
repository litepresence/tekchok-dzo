First: straightening the body. When body is straight, channels become straight. When channels are straight, wind flows directly. When wind flows directly, various conceptual thoughts cease.

This is illustrated by example: like sages Meditation-Sage and Expansion on the face of Mount Meru, the manner of meditating in equipoise. Straighten body, straighten channels, direct wind. Thoughts stop naturally—not by fighting but by alignment.

Consider a tree growing toward the sun. It does not struggle to reach light; it simply grows straight. So too with body and mind—straighten the posture, and awareness naturally rises.

[5640-5644]
Thus. Body straight, channels straight, wind direct. The three straightened, thoughts cease. This is the foundation of meditation posture.

Observe. Understand. Release.

[5640-5644]
Therefore. The teaching on straightening is complete. Body like mountain, channels like streams, wind like breath of space. Rest in natural alignment.
