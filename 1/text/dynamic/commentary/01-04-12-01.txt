[3062-3076]
The wind moves through the meadows of Sertar without leaving a trace—this is how meaning appears when searched for directly. Where would it abide? The beginner's mind seeks a ground that was never absent, only overlooked in the very act of seeking.

A farmer does not search for the soil beneath his feet; he simply plants. So too, recognition requires no foundation beyond the recognition itself.

The Ratnagotravibhāga speaks of extremes dissolved, yet dissolution itself dissolves. What remains when even "emptiness" proves to be a designation, a Body touches ground—gesture is not the surrender. at moonlight that cannot be grasped?

—

[3062-3076]
The eightfold non-abiding unfolds like a lotus that needs no support. Cause without cause. Distinction without distinction. One and many, both and neither—each concept released like a breath into morning air.

This is not philosophy as accumulation but as dissolution. The Autonomous School built structures; the Consequentialist reveals they were always sandcastles, beautiful in their impermanence.

—

[3062-3067]
No saṃsāra. The wanderer asks: "Where have I been wandering?" No answer comes because the question dissolves in the asking. No nirvāṇa to reach, for reaching implies distance, and distance requires a traveler who travels.

Even emptiness—empty. The word "emptiness" itself empty. Echo-like, chasing its own source, endlessly.

—

[3068-3076]
The non-abidings listed are not achievements but recognitions. To say "cause is non-abiding" is to see that causation itself is dependently arisen, therefore empty of inherent existence. The one who sees this does not stand apart from the seeing.

Mirror reflecting mirror—where is the original image? The reflection is perfect, complete, yet nothing is there.

—

[3077-3085]
The Consequentialist's method: enter through any door, find no floor, no ceiling, no walls. The building was a dream. This is not nihilism—the appearance of the building remains, but its substantiality evaporates like dew.

The King of Samādhi Sūtra warns against even the middle. Abandoning extremes, one might rest in the center. But the center is also a position, and positions bind. The wise one does not even abide in non-abiding.

—

[3081-3091]
The Tathāgata's permanence is not the permanence of a stone but the permanence of space—unchanging because never born. All dharmas share this nature, yet the childish grasp at signs, mistaking the pointing finger for the moon.

Like mistaking the reflection of a bird in water for a bird that can be caught.

—

[3092-3101]
Nāgārjuna's homage: dependent origination is the middle way. From non-cessation, no birth. From non-annihilation, no permanence. The opposites collapse not through force but through seeing their mutual dependency.

The chariot is not found in its parts, nor apart from them. Where then is the chariot? So too with the self, with all phenomena. The search itself reveals the emptiness of the sought.

—

[3092-3101]
Thirty-seven syllables that stopped the philosophical world. Not by offering a new view but by showing all views are dependently arisen, therefore empty. The cessation of elaboration is not another elaboration but the end of the need to elaborate.

River reaching ocean—it does not cease to be water; it ceases to be "river."

—

[3102-3113]
The Refutation of Objections: Nāgārjuna has no position to defend. Therefore, no position can be attacked. The accuser projects; the accused is absent. This is not evasion—this is the nature of emptiness itself.

If I held a view, I would be vulnerable. Holding no view, there is nothing to pierce. Space cannot be wounded.

—

[3109-3113]
"Since there is nothing to refute, I refute nothing." This is not stubborn silence but the recognition that the opponent's categories are already empty. The imputation of negation belongs to the one who imputes.

Accusing silence of being loud—the accusation reveals the accuser's confusion, not the silence's volume.

—

[3114-3118]
Beyond true and false, beyond existence and non-existence, beyond even the present moment's conceptual grasp. This is the summit—yet no flag is planted here, no territory claimed. The Buddhas speak suchness without speaking it.

The view that is no view. The path that is no path. The accomplishment that is no accomplishment. All conventional designations, all ultimately empty, all equally the play of primordial wisdom.

—

[3118]
The summit. After the arduous climb through conceptual systems, the air grows thin. Views require oxygen, and here there is none. What remains is not a view but viewlessness—not blindness but the clarity that sees through all seeing.

Like the mountain peak that supports no trees, no structures—just space, just openness, just the freedom from the need to be anything at all.

—

[3119-3131]
Six treatises, six doors, all opening onto the same courtyard. Nāgārjuna did not build a system; he dismantled all systems, including his own. The first turning's four truths, the second turning's signlessness, the third turning's definitive meaning—all explained, all opened.

This master is called the Second Buddha not for founding a school but for revealing what the First Buddha revealed: dependent origination is emptiness, emptiness is dependent origination. The wheel turns, yet goes nowhere.

—

[3119-3125]
The Root Wisdom, the Sixty Verses, the Seventy on Emptiness, the Fine Analysis, the Refutation, the Conventional Establishment—each a different The bird calls, you turn to look. The call is not the bird. at the same moon. Not contradictory but complementary, like different paths up the same mountain that all dissolve at the summit.

To study one is to study all. To master all is to see they were never separate.

—

[3132-3158]
Action Tantra. The path of purity and purification, of master and servant, of deity approached with reverence and distance. Three purifications: of body through ritual bath, of speech through mantra, of mind through visualization.

The practitioner does not yet see the deity as oneself. The relationship is hierarchical, respectful, careful. Servant-like, entering the king's chamber—every movement measured, every word considered.

—

[3132-3158]
The Kriyā vehicle emphasizes external purity because the practitioner has not yet recognized internal purity. Bathing three times, changing garments, avoiding impure substances—these are training wheels for the mind that still believes in impurity.

Yet even here, wisdom whispers: the deity visualized is not different from the visualizer. The servant and master share one nature, though this is not yet seen clearly.

—

[3177-3184]
Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga—three approaches to the same realization. Like three rivers flowing from different mountains, all reaching the same ocean. Kriyā emphasizes action and purity. Upāya balances action with meditation. Yoga emphasizes meditation while maintaining some ritual.

The progression is not from wrong to right but from external to internal, from gradual to direct, from effort to recognition.

—

[3235-3245]
Upāya Tantra—the "both" vehicle. Conduct like Kriyā: purification, ritual, carefulness. View like Yoga: non-duality, emptiness, direct recognition. This is the bridge between the outer and inner, the gradual and sudden.

Bird-like with two wings—ritual and meditation together lift the practitioner. Neither alone is sufficient; together they carry one to realization.

—

[3246-3310]
Yoga Tantra. Now the relationship shifts: deity and practitioner are brothers, friends, equals. The five manifest enlightenments transform the practitioner into the deity not through supplication but through recognition.

Seat, form, emblem, generation, syllables—each a doorway through which one steps into Buddhahood. The deity does not bestow; the practitioner realizes what was always the case.

—

[3246-3264]
The five manifest enlightenments: sun and moon as method and wisdom, lotus as the source of manifestation, complete form as the purification of the senses, syllables as the purification of speech, emblem as the purification of mind.

Each enlightenment is not sequential but simultaneous, not acquired but revealed. The aggregates purify into the five Buddhas not through transformation but through recognition of their true nature.

—

[3265-3284]
Action king, maṇḍala king—different approaches to the same result. Some practitioners prefer gradual accumulation through various rituals. Others enter directly through the complete maṇḍala. Both reach the same destination, like travelers on different roads converging at the city gate.

The complete purification of aggregates, elements, actions, afflictions, objects, faculties—nothing is left impure because nothing was ever impure. The recognition itself is the purification.

—

[3285-3310]
Deity and self as non-dual. This is the heart of Yoga Tantra. Not two entities merging but one reality seen clearly. The deity arises from oneself, dissolves into oneself, is never separate from oneself.

The three shamelessnesses: no shame before the deity (for we are one), no shame before teacher and sangha (for we share the same nature), no shame before one's own mind (for it is primordially pure). This is not recklessness but confidence born of recognition.

—

[3288-3310]
From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra: the view is realization of deity and friend, not master and servant. The conduct is without refutation or establishment—neither accepting nor rejecting, neither affirming nor denying.

The five enlightenments are practiced through the five doors: seat, form, emblem, generation, syllables. But these are not steps on a ladder; they are aspects of a single recognition. The deity's maṇḍala and one's own mind—non-dual from the beginning.

—

[3132-3158]
The transition from sūtra to tantra is not a rejection but an acceleration. The causal vehicle requires eons of accumulation; the resultant vehicle recognizes that the result is already present. Like walking to a destination versus realizing you never left home.

Mantra's superiority lies not in different teachings but in direct methods. Many means, no difficulty, non-delusion, sharp faculties—four qualities that distinguish the swift path.

—

[3159-3176]
The definition of mantra: protection from affliction, quick accomplishment of enlightenment. The essence: self-arisen wisdom, clear light, direct realization. These are not new doctrines but the tantric expression of the same emptiness taught in the Middle Way.

The term "tantra" refers to continuity—the continuity of the practitioner's mindstream with the clear light expanse. Not something to achieve but something to recognize.

—

[3177-3184]
Outer and inner tantra: the outer maintains some distinction between practitioner and deity, ritual and realization. The inner dissolves all distinction into spontaneous presence. The outer is preparation; the inner is recognition.

Yet even this distinction dissolves upon examination. All three outer tantras lead to the same realization; they differ only in method and emphasis, not in goal.

—

[3185-3234]
Kriyā in detail: the three purifications are the entry. Bathing, changing garments, maintaining purity—these are supports for the mind that has not yet recognized its own purity. The view is of master and servant; the practice is of careful ritual.

Yet within this carefulness, freedom is already present. The deity visualized is one's own mind's nature. The mantra recited is one's own awareness. The distinction is pedagogical, not ontological.

—

[3235-3245]
Upāya's unique position: it combines the ritual purity of Kriyā with the view of Yoga. This makes it a "neutral" vehicle—not inferior to Yoga, not superior to Kriyā, but a bridge for those who need both structure and spaciousness.

The five manifest enlightenments appear here too, but the emphasis is balanced between external ritual and internal meditation.

—

[3246-3310]
Yoga's emphasis on meditation does not reject ritual but integrates it. The three samayas—no shame before deity, teacher, or mind—express the confidence of recognition. One is not approaching something external but revealing what is internal.

The deity's radiation and gathering, the practitioner's own awareness's play—these are not two. The illusion body is not created but recognized. The deity form is not visualized but revealed.

—

[3062-3131]
Returning to the Middle Way: all of this tantric elaboration—Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga, the five enlightenments, the three samayas—is itself dependently arisen, therefore empty. The Consequentialist's view encompasses all methods without being bound by any.

Nāgārjuna's six treatises provide the philosophical foundation: whatever is dependently arisen is empty. The tantras provide the method: recognize dependent origination directly in one's own experience. The meeting of view and method is the complete path.

—

[3132-3310]
From the causal vehicle's eons to the resultant vehicle's single lifetime—this compression is possible because the path is not actually traveled. The destination is not reached but recognized. The practitioner is not transformed but revealed.

The three outer tantras prepare the mind for this recognition through purification, through balance, through meditation. Each is appropriate for a different type of practitioner, yet all lead to the same door: the recognition of one's own nature as the deity's nature, the path's nature, the result's nature.

—

[3119-3125]
The six collections of reasoning are not philosophical exercises but liberation manuals. Each verse is a key to unlock a particular conceptual prison. The Root Wisdom on dependent origination, the Sixty on reasoning, the Seventy on emptiness, the Fine Analysis on subtle distinctions, the Refutation on objections, the Conventional Establishment on the provisional—together they form a complete toolkit for dissolving all views.

To read them as asserting a position is to miss them entirely. To read them as dissolving positions is to use them correctly.

—

[3077-3118]
The Consequentialist's freedom from extremes is the foundation for tantra's freedom from acceptance and rejection. If nothing is inherently existent, nothing needs to be rejected. If nothing is inherently non-existent, nothing needs to be accepted. The Middle Way becomes the Great Way, the single taste of all phenomena.

This is why the Buddhas' view is called the summit—not because it is higher than others, but because it is the exhaustion of all comparative positions. No higher, no lower. Just this.

—

[3062-3310]
The entire section—from Madhyamaka philosophy through the three outer tantras—presents a single continuum. Philosophy provides the view: emptiness. Tantra provides the method: direct recognition. The outer tantras provide the preparation: purification and meditation.

What begins as intellectual understanding (conventional truth is non-abiding) becomes direct experience (deity and self are non-dual). What begins as ritual purity (three baths, three garments) becomes natural purity (mind's primordial clearness). The path is one continuous revelation, unfolding according to the practitioner's capacity.

—

[3185-3234]
The Kriyā practitioner's carefulness is not foolishness but appropriate method. For one who still sees impurity, purification is necessary. For one who still sees distance, reverence is appropriate. The master-servant relationship prepares the mind for the brother-friend relationship of Yoga.

Like teaching a child to swim: first the edge of the pool, then floatation devices, then confident swimming. The methods differ but the goal is the same: comfort in the water, freedom in the ocean.

—

[3246-3284]
The Yoga Tantra's five enlightenments transform without transformation. The aggregates were always the five Buddhas; the elements were always the five consorts. The practitioner does not create this but recognizes it. The "generation" is not production but revelation.

Sun and moon, lotus and deities, syllables and emblems—these are not external supports but internal recognitions. The maṇḍala is not visualized but revealed as the nature of one's own mind.

—

[3285-3310]
The Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra's summary: entry through the five enlightenments, view as deity and friend, samayas without shame, conduct without refutation or establishment. This is Yoga Tantra in essence.

The practitioner who realizes this does not abandon Kriyā's purity or Upāya's balance but transcends them through inclusion. All methods become natural expression, all views become single taste, all paths become the recognition of what was never absent.

—

[3132-3158]
The superiority of mantra over sūtra is not doctrinal but methodological. Both teach emptiness; tantra teaches it directly through one's own body, speech, and mind. The difference is like reading about water versus drinking it—both know water, but one knows it intimately.

Many means: the tantras offer countless methods for different temperaments. No difficulty: the result is already present, not to be manufactured. Non-delusion: the view prevents error. Sharp faculties: the practitioner recognizes quickly. These four qualities make the swift path swift.

—

[3119-3131]
Nāgārjuna as Second Buddha: not because he added to the teaching but because he revealed its depth. The six treatises comment on the three turnings, showing their ultimate meaning. The first turning's four truths, the second's signlessness, the third's definitive meaning—all are emptiness, all are dependent origination, all are the Middle Way.

This is the treasury's heart: not a new teaching but the same teaching seen clearly.

—

[3062-3076]
The Ratnagotravibhāga's verses echo through the entire section. No saṃsāra, no nirvāṇa, not even emptiness—merely designated by words. This is not nihilism but the highest affirmation: the nature of reality cannot be contained in concepts, cannot be limited by existence or non-existence.

The eightfold non-abiding is the map of this freedom. Cause, distinction, one, many, beyond both, appearance—all released, all open, all the play of primordial wisdom.

—

[3102-3113]
The Refutation's final word: "You have imposed that imputation." All accusations, all positions, all views—projected by the mind onto emptiness. The Consequentialist stands nowhere, therefore cannot be pushed off any ground.

This is the ultimate protection: not a fortress of views but the open space of viewlessness. Not defensiveness but the absence of anything to defend.

—

[3062-3310]
Reading this entire section—from the eightfold non-abiding through the six treatises to the three outer tantras—one sees a single gesture: the dissolution of grasping. Whether through philosophical analysis or tantric practice, the goal is the same: freedom from fixation, recognition of the nature of mind.

The methods differ because minds differ. Some need the careful dismantling of the Middle Way. Some need the ritual purity of Kriyā. Some need the balanced approach of Upāya. Some need the meditative recognition of Yoga. All are skillful means. All lead to the same recognition.

—

[3132-3310]
The treasury's generosity: offering paths for every type of mind. The philosophical mind finds the six collections of reasoning. The devotional mind finds the three outer tantras. The direct mind finds the inner tantras yet to come. Each is complete. Each leads to the summit.

The summit is not a place but a recognition. Not a view but viewlessness. Not an achievement but a revelation. The path is walked only to discover there was never anywhere to go. The practitioner practices only to realize there was never anyone practicing.

—

[3062-3118]
The Middle Way section concludes with the summit of views. The tantra section that follows builds on this foundation. One cannot practice the outer tantras effectively without understanding emptiness. The rituals become mere superstition, the visualizations become mere fantasy.

But with the view of emptiness, everything transforms. The bath becomes the purification of conceptual mind. The mantra becomes the expression of awareness. The visualization becomes the revelation of true nature. The foundation makes the structure possible.

—

[3119-3125]
The six treatises are listed as the great treatises of this system. The Root Wisdom is the foundation; the others elaborate specific points. Together they form a complete presentation of the Middle Way view that informs all subsequent practice.

To study tantra without this foundation is like building a house without a foundation—it may stand temporarily but will collapse under pressure. The view of emptiness is the indispensable basis for all Vajrayāna practice.

—

[3062-3310]
The section moves from the highest philosophical view to the most practical ritual methods, showing their continuity. The eightfold non-abiding is not contradicted by the three purifications; it makes them possible. The absence of inherent existence makes the presence of dependent origination vivid.

This is the treasury's method: establishing the view, then applying it. Understanding emptiness, then practicing tantra. The sequence is not arbitrary but necessary. Each step prepares for the next. Each realization makes the next possible.

—

[3246-3310]
The Yoga Tantra's emphasis on non-duality represents a shift from the earlier approaches. In Kriyā, deity and practitioner are separate. In Upāya, they are connected. In Yoga, they are recognized as non-dual. This progression mirrors the deepening of understanding from the causal to the resultant vehicle.

The five manifest enlightenments are the method; the recognition of non-duality is the result. Yet method and result are not two—the enlightenments are already the nature of mind, the recognition merely reveals what was always the case.

—

[3062-3076]
Returning to the beginning: since there is no beginning, meaning stops like an unestablished cause. This is not a puzzle to solve but a reality to recognize. The search for meaning in concepts is like searching for water in a mirage—the search itself reveals the emptiness of the sought.

The treasury teaches through pointing, through negation, through the exhaustion of all positions. What remains when all views are dissolved is not nothing but the openness that accommodates all, the freedom that is the nature of mind itself.

—

[3118]
The summit. The word echoes at the beginning, middle, and end of this section. From the philosophical summit of the Middle Way to the methodological summit of the outer tantras, the treasury offers the highest teachings for those ready to receive them.

But the summit is not the end—it is the beginning of the real journey. Beyond the outer tantras lie the inner tantras, beyond the inner tantras lies the Great Perfection. Each summit reveals a higher peak. Each realization opens to a deeper recognition.

—

[3062-3310]
The entire section is a preparation. The Middle Way dissolves conceptual fixation. The outer tantras establish pure perception. Together they create the conditions for the direct recognition that is the heart of the resultant vehicle.

The practitioner who understands this section has the philosophical foundation and the practical methods to enter the swift path. The view of emptiness prevents error; the methods of the outer tantras accumulate merit and wisdom. Together, they make awakening possible in a single lifetime.

—

[3132-3158]
The comparison between causal and resultant vehicles is not invidious but descriptive. Both lead to Buddhahood. The causal vehicle takes longer because it relies on gradual accumulation. The resultant vehicle is swifter because it recognizes that the result is already present.

This recognition is possible because of the view of emptiness established in the Middle Way section. Without understanding that all phenomena are dependently arisen and therefore empty, one cannot understand how the result can be present in the cause. The view makes the method possible.

—

[3246-3310]
The three shamelessnesses of Yoga Tantra express a profound confidence. No shame before deity because deity and self are one. No shame before teacher because teacher and student share the same nature. No shame before mind because mind is primordially pure.

This confidence is not arrogance but recognition. It is based on the realization of emptiness, the understanding that all distinctions are conventional, not ultimate. The practitioner who realizes this can practice without hesitation, without doubt, without fear.

—

[3062-3310]
The section concludes having established both view and method. The Middle Way provides the view: emptiness, dependent origination, freedom from extremes. The three outer tantras provide the method: purification, balance, meditation. Together they form a complete path.

What follows in the treasury will build on this foundation, offering more direct methods, more profound recognitions. But the foundation must be firm. The view must be clear. The practitioner who has understood this section is ready for what comes next.

—

[3119-3131]
Nāgārjuna's role as commentator on all three turnings emphasizes the unity of the Buddha's teaching. The four truths, signlessness, and definitive meaning are not contradictory but progressive revelations of the same truth. The Middle Way view encompasses them all.

This is the treasury's perspective: not sectarian but inclusive, not exclusive but comprehensive. All teachings are skillful means. All lead to the same recognition. The wise practitioner appreciates them all without becoming fixated on any.

—

[3062-3118]
The Consequentialist's view is the thread that runs through the entire section. It is not abandoned when moving to tantra; it is applied. The emptiness of inherent existence makes the purity of ritual meaningful. The non-duality of subject and object makes the visualization effective.

The view and the method are inseparable. The Middle Way without tantra is incomplete; tantra without the Middle Way is dangerous. Together they form the complete path that leads to awakening in this very life.

—

[3132-3310]
The detailed presentation of the three outer tantras provides practical guidance for practitioners. Kriyā for those who need structure and purity. Upāya for those who need balance. Yoga for those who need meditation. Each is appropriate for a different disposition.

The treasury does not impose a single method but offers many, recognizing the diversity of minds and capacities. The goal is the same; the paths are many. This is the flexibility of the resultant vehicle, its generosity, its skill.

—

[3062-3076]
The opening verses set the tone for everything that follows. No saṃsāra, no nirvāṇa, not even emptiness—this is not mere philosophy but the nature of reality. To recognize this is to be free from the very beginning, to have nowhere to go and nothing to achieve.

Yet this recognition does not negate the path. The path is the process of coming to this recognition. The practices are the methods of preparation. The result is the revelation of what was always the case. This is the treasury's teaching in essence.

—

[3118]
The summit—visited repeatedly throughout this section. Each return reveals new depths. The summit of philosophical understanding. The summit of ritual practice. The summit of meditative recognition. Each is a vantage point from which to see the same view.

The treasury invites the practitioner to climb, to explore, to discover. The summit is not the end of the journey but its transformation. From the summit, all paths are visible. From the summit, the view is complete.

—

[3062-3310]
The section on Madhyamaka and the three outer tantras is a complete teaching in itself. It establishes the view, presents the methods, and Seven colors, one light. The separation is appearance, not reality. the result. The practitioner who studies it carefully, reflects on it deeply, and applies it sincerely will find the path open before them.

The treasury continues beyond this section, offering more profound teachings, more direct methods. But the foundation laid here is essential. Without it, the advanced teachings cannot be properly understood or practiced. With it, they become accessible, meaningful, transformative.

—

[3102-3113]
The Refutation of Objections provides a model for dealing with challenges to the view. Not by defending a position but by showing the emptiness of all positions. Not by asserting but by dissolving. This is the Consequentialist's skill in debate.

But the purpose of debate is not victory; it is liberation. The opponent is not an enemy but a fellow traveler. The refutation is not an attack but an offering. Both are freed in the recognition of emptiness.

—

[3062-3310]
The entire section is an invitation to recognize the nature of mind. Whether through the philosophical analysis of the Middle Way or the ritual practices of the outer tantras, the goal is the same. The methods differ; the recognition is one.

The treasury is generous in its offerings, providing paths for every type of mind. The philosophical, the devotional, the meditative—each finds appropriate methods here. And all lead to the same summit, the same recognition, the same freedom.

—

[3132-3158]
The four qualities that make mantra superior—many means, no difficulty, non-delusion, sharp faculties—are elaborations of a single principle: direct recognition. The means are many because minds are many. The difficulty is absent because the result is present. The delusion is prevented by the view. The faculties are sharp because the nature is clear.

This is the tantric path in summary. Not different from the sūtra path in essence, but different in method. More direct, more swift, more accessible to those with the capacity. The treasury offers both, leaving the choice to the practitioner.

—

[3062-3310]
The section ends where it began: with the recognition that there is no beginning. The unestablished cause, the merely designated emptiness, the non-abiding of all phenomena—this is the ground of the path, the nature of the practitioner, the essence of the result.

To recognize this is to complete the section, to complete the path, to complete the treasury. Yet completion is not an end but a beginning. From this recognition, the real practice starts. From this view, the real methods become effective. From this ground, awakening unfolds naturally.

—

[3119-3125]
The six collections of reasoning stand as monuments to analytical wisdom. Nāgārjuna's legacy, the Second Buddha's gift to future generations. Each verse a key, each treatise a door, all opening onto the same vast space of freedom.

To study them is to honor the lineage. To understand them is to continue the tradition. To apply them is to fulfill their purpose. The treasury preserves this heritage, presenting it anew for each generation of practitioners.

—

[3062-3118]
The Middle Way section's conclusion—the summit—resounds through the subsequent teachings. All that follows is built on this foundation. The tantras, the practices, the results—all depend on the view of emptiness, the freedom from extremes, the recognition of dependent origination.

This is why the treasury presents the Middle Way first, before the tantras. The foundation must be firm. The view must be clear. The practitioner must understand what is being practiced and why. Then the practice becomes meaningful, effective, transformative.

—

[3062-3310]
The complete section, from the eightfold non-abiding to the three samayas of Yoga Tantra, presents a unified teaching. Philosophy and practice, view and method, analysis and meditation—all integrated, all serving the single purpose of awakening.

This is the treasury's greatness: not presenting partial teachings but the complete path. Not offering fragments but the whole. The practitioner who engages with this section fully will find all that is needed for the journey, all that is required for the recognition, all that is necessary for the awakening.
