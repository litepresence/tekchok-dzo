Since there is no beginning, meaning stops like an unestablished cause. From the intermediate Ratnagotravibhāga: "In ultimate truth, saṃsāra does not exist. Nirvāṇa does not exist. Emptiness does not exist. It is merely designated by words—it is said."

In this, conventional truth is completely non-abiding:
- Cause is non-abiding
- Distinction is non-abiding
- The distinguisher is non-abiding
- One is non-abiding
- Many is non-abiding
- Beyond one and many is non-abiding
- Mere appearance is completely non-abiding

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

This is called the Consequentialist Middle Way Higher School.

[3062-3076]
Sever! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

No saṃsāra! No nirvāṇa! Not even emptiness exists! Merely designated by words!

All non-abiding:
- Cause? NON-ABIDING!
- Distinction? NON-ABIDING!
- One? NON-ABIDING!
- Many? NON-ABIDING!
- Beyond both? NON-ABIDING!

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

EVEN APPEARANCE COMPLETELY NON-ABIDING!

FREE FROM ALL EXTREMES!

[3062-3080]
The Consequentialist view—like space that does not abide anywhere, yet accommodates all. Saṃsāra does not exist ultimately. Nirvāṇa does not exist ultimately. Even emptiness—merely designated, not truly established.

The list of non-abidings is not a checklist to complete—it is the exhaustion of all possible positions. Wherever the mind would rest, the Consequentialist undermines. Like a mother removing the ladder when her child climbs too high—not cruelty, but protection from falling.

[3062-3076]
This cave dweller. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Saṃsāra doesn't exist. Nirvāṇa doesn't exist. Emptiness itself—just a word! Where does that leave us? Right here—without the burden of having somewhere to go.

Like a bird that doesn't need to land—flying is its nature.

[3062-3067]
See what is. Rest in recognition. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Saṃsāra—does not exist. Nirvāṇa—does not exist. Emptiness—does not exist. Merely designated by words.

What knows this designation? What remains?

[3081-3101]
From the Noble King of Samādhi Sūtra:
"Permanent and impermanent—this is also an extreme.
Existence and non-existence—both are extremes.
Therefore, both extremes are completely abandoned.
The wise one does not even abide in the middle."

From the Root Wisdom:
"Whatever depends and connects,
Through non-cessation, there is no birth.
Through non-annihilation, there is no permanence.
Through non-coming, there is no going.
Neither different meaning nor single meaning.
Showing the cessation of elaboration, peace.
The perfect Buddhas speak.
Homage to that supreme one."

[3102-3113]
SUDDEN. From the Refutation of Objections: This is the treasury's heart.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

"If I were to assert something exists,
Then I would have this fault.
Since I assert nothing,
I am only without faults."

Since there is nothing to refute,
I refute nothing.
Therefore, it is said that one refutes.
You have imposed that imputation.

The Consequentialist holds no position—therefore cannot be defeated. Like thunder that strikes without a hand to throw it.

[3114-3118]
And this also: Since no view is established by intellect, one wishes for the cessation of elaboration. Although placed as various mere appearances in the branch of conventional symbol-knowledge as worldly convention, this also is not ultimately asserted.

One wishes to be free from the extremes of existence and non-existence and from the present time, beyond true and false appearance of dharma.

This is the summit of the established views of the Buddhas who assert suchness.

[3118]
The summit. After climbing through Mind-Only, Autonomous Middle Way—finally the Consequentialist peak. But there's no flag planted here, no view to claim. Just the exhaustion of all views.

Like finally reaching the mountaintop and finding the air too thin for any position to breathe.
 The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.
