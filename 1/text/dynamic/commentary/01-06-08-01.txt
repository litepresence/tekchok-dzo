The seed planted in fertile ground does not choose to grow. It grows because growth is its nature.
The teaching opens like a door that was never closed. What enters? Only what was already inside. The words are fingers pointing at a moon that has never been absent.

This wanderer.
The vessel receives water not by effort but by being empty and open.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

Look. It is here.
Ripening is not transformation. It is recognition of what was always ripe.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

Between the extremes, the vast middle way opens like a horizon that recedes as you approach.
The sun ripens all fruits without choosing. Its light asks nothing.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

Like lightning illuminating the valley for an instant—such is the nature (rang bzhin) of direct recognition.
The empowerments are rain falling on different soils. The rain is the same.

Ma rig pa ye shes su shar—delusion dawns as wisdom wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. The flowering differs.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming.

In the interval (bar snang), awareness sees itself directly. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

Accordingly. The analysis.
The seed planted in fertile ground does not choose to grow. It grows because growth is its nature.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

This hermit.
The vessel receives water not by effort but by being empty and open.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

The sequence completes itself, not by reaching an end, but by recognizing there was never a beginning. Return to what you never left. Rest in what has never moved. The commentary ends where the teaching begins—in the space between thoughts where thoughts have never been.

In this manner. Words point to what exceeds words.

Beyond concept, awareness simply is—this is the showing.

The obstacle exists only for the one who believes in obstacles.

This old hermit once waited for empowerment for twelve years. When it finally came, he realized he had been empowered from the first moment he sought. The waiting was the empowerment. The seeking was the finding.
