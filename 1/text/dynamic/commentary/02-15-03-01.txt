Three kayas abide in expanse through different aspects, though essence is one. From Self-Arising: "Three kayas, wisdom-appearance, without obstruction to anything, perceived objects being one, essence appearing individually."

Not three separate entities—one awareness wearing three garments. Like one sun reflected in three pools, each reflection unique yet sun remains one.

[677-684]
Awareness itself appears thus: Awareness without thought—dharmakaya essence. Awareness uncensored and clear—sambhogakaya. Awareness appearing as whatever—nirmanakaya.

This very moment of recognition—complete, awakened, not elsewhere, not later. The three kayas are not destinations to reach but what you already are.

[669-684]
Thus the five kayas in particular explanation. Though we speak of five, the essence is one awareness. The enumeration serves recognition, not establishment of separate entities.

[669-684]
See clearly. Recognize fully. Rest completely.
