See directly: Hence. The structure. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[18263-18273]
This hermit realized: A practitioner. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[17884-17898]
Voice 20 proclaims: First, essence—knowledge what object-subject grasper-holder arise, possessing non-awareness pervader. Definitive meaning: because grasper-holder arise, object and subject mind through, thus called mind. Above two minds' samadhi one-pointed attachment also grasper-holder. Desire in all-conception coarse.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

[17890-17902]
Cut through now! Look. It is here. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[17902-17914]
Look now: Consequently. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[17909-17920]
These all also self-arisen ultimate meaning general grasp—directly object impossible, samsara aspect belonging, mind gathered. From Uttaratantra: self-arisen ultimate that, faith itself realization object, sun mandala clear-light though, eye not-possess see nonexistent. Thus spoken like.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[17915-17932]
This old hermit remembers his first glimpse of mind-itself. It was not in meditation, not in study, not in practice. It was while washing his bowl—the mind dropped, and there it was, clear as mountain stream. Ever-present, never hidden. The mind-itself pure, not to be made pure.

[17921-17945]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Impure mind distinction: briefly-shown and extensively-explained. First is: expanse impure nonexistent though, that from move time basis-appearance cut impossible what also arise. Non-awareness play from mind, mind ornament from intellect, intellect from affliction arise. That also play—capacity, power, ray like, that from arise tone just. Seed from sprout, face form from that reflection mirror arise like. Ornament—ripen arise grain portion, seed flower mark like.

[17933-17945]
Between seed and flower, the vast middle way opens. The seed does not become the flower—the flower was already present in the seed. Likewise, mind-itself does not become pure—it is pure from the first. The impurity is like frost on a window; the clear glass was never stained.

[17945-17962]
Thus established: Thus established. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[17946-17975]
Second extensively explained three: root ignorance division, that from arisen mind division, that from arisen affliction division. First is: ignorance thus—root mind ignorance, confusion object ignorance, confusion-basis basis ignorance, grasping thought ignorance, artificial path ignorance, not-knowing delusion ignorance. Six ignorance forms arise, self appear not-see.

[17958-17983]
Between these extremes: An old vagabond. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

[17975-18007]
Voice 20 proclaims: These all object condition through—virtuous, non-virtuous, unspecified mind three gather. Mind from intellect arise: all-search intellect etc. six. Third, that from arisen affliction distinction three: six root afflictions, sixteen proximate, subtle-arise clear limitless. First from Sun-Moon Union: afflictions six—non-awareness, delusion, anger, pride, desire, jealousy.

[18002-18028]
In the secret mandala: The framework reveals. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[18032-18053]
Between the six and sixteen, the vast middle way opens. The afflictions multiply like reflections in a hall of mirrors—sixteen becomes twenty-five, becomes fifty-one, becomes eighty-four thousand. But cut the root non-awareness, and all reflections dissolve. The mirror itself is never stained.

[18049-18074]
These all sequence: that alone not-know delusion through all affliction make, object mind grasp, subject grasp intellect, both self grasp, all conception, meaning non-awareness, nature aim not-see, word meaning non-realized, general-specific not-understand, delusion know promise meaning wrong, object I grasp, other not-happy, object take, object special desire, slightly puff pride, object spread anger. This is the treasury's heart.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[18067-18098]
This old hermit laughed at his own afflictions. Anger like tiger, desire like bird, pride like lion—how serious they seemed! But like images in a dream, they have no substance. The dreamer worries about the tiger's teeth, but upon waking, laughs at the fear. Recognize the dream nature, and afflictions self-liberate.

[18087-18116]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Third subtle-arise clear limitless afflictions: twenty-five, fifty-one, thousand eight ten four. First root non-awareness pervader separately not-counted. Pervaded five poisons five distinguish—twenty-five. From Self-Arisen: delusion five, desire five, anger five, pride five, jealousy five. Second fifty-one: twenty-five on object, twenty-five on subject, plus root—fifty-one. Third eighty-four thousand: desire twenty-one thousand, anger twenty-one thousand, delusion twenty-one thousand, part equal twenty-one thousand. Sum thousand eight four.

[18105-18128]
In the treasury's view: Analysis proceeds. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[18111-18140]
That like karma afflictions all three-realm mind mental-factors depend. That also consciousness group eight: basis-all consciousness object not-think appear cause, conception-nonexistent clear. That from spread door five knowledge: eye consciousness form grasp conception-nonexistent, ear sound, nose smell, tongue taste, body touch. That from grasper-holder intellect-consciousness two: object first general grasp, after particular grasp affliction-intellect—grasped and grasper.

[18128-18156]
In the visionary's gaze: This mountain dweller. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What appears as obstacle is the path itself, unrecognized.

[18140-18163]
Between the eight and the one, the vast middle way opens. Intellect-consciousness two on virtuous, non-virtuous, unspecified three exist, conception-possess, conception-nonexistent suitable exist. Door five and basis-all consciousness conception-nonexistent. Thus three-realm mind mental-factors fifty-one all abandon object superimposition only. From Two Truths: mind mental-factors three-realm superimposition form-possess conception. These abandon object—non-awareness nature is reason.

[18135-18163]
Voice 20 proclaims: Here mind path make Buddha desire—great text Madhyamaka etc. tradition through also. Mind mind-itself two distinguish, mind group eight or seven or six nature abandon object gather, mind-itself nature pure accept object realize, path cultivate enter do. This that and part similar: awareness awareness from arise mind-itself, self characteristic grasp mind explain.

[18157-18176]
Therefore: Thus. We proceed. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Look now: This fool.
