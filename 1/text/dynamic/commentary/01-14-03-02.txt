[18262-18263] Second: wisdom nature extensively explained. From the Thalgyur Tantra—wisdom that cannot be contained in words, yet speaks through all words.

[18262-18263] This old hermit once thought wisdom could be learned! Studied texts, memorized verses, debated scholars. Then one morning, watching mist rise from the valley—understood. Wisdom is not in the books. Books are fingers pointing. Wisdom is the moon.

[18262-18263] Therefore. Thus. ye shes kyi rang bzhin rgyas par bshad pa—the detailed exposition of wisdom's nature. Precise analysis: not conceptual knowledge but direct recognition, not accumulated information but intrinsic clarity.

[18262-18263] Wisdom beyond words! Look directly! Can you grasp it? Can you conceptualize it? The attempt itself shows its futility. Wisdom is the looking, not what is looked at. The recognizing, not what is recognized.

[18262-18263] The essence of wisdom: not separate from mind, not identical to mind. Like water and wetness—cannot be distinguished, yet not the same. This is the nature that Thalgyur reveals.

[18262-18263] Three words. Wisdom. Nature. Recognize. Stop. See your own nature—that is the wisdom. Rest in that recognition.
