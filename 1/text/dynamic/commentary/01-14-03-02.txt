Second: wisdom nature extensively explained. Ye shes kyi rang bzhin rgyas
par bshad pa—detailed exposition of wisdom's nature. From Thalgyur: wisdom
not concept, essence self-luminous. Dbye ba gsum—threefold classification.
Nges tshig—definitive meaning. This is how wisdom knows itself.

[18264-18276]
This old hermit thought wisdom could be learned. Studied texts, memorized,
debated. Then watching mist rise from valley—understood. Wisdom not in
books. Books are Prayer flags carry the mantra on wind—the flag is not the prayer.. Wisdom is the moon all fingers indicate.

[18266-18278]
Ye shes rtog pa ma yin te—wisdom is not concept. Ngo bo rang gsal snying
po'i don—essence is self-luminous, heart meaning. Not accumulated knowledge
but intrinsic clarity. Not something to get but something to recognize.

[18268-18280]
Wisdom's nature. Recognition complete. Three words—but wisdom and nature
and recognition are not three. They are the same, described differently.

[18270-18282]
Wisdom beyond words! Look directly! Can you grasp it? The attempt shows
futility. Wisdom is the looking, not what is looked at. Water and wetness—
cannot be distinguished, yet not the same. This is Thalgyur's revelation.

[18272-18284]
Threefold classification of wisdom: essence (ngo bo), definitive meaning
(nges tshig), distinctions (dbye ba). Four aspects complete the exposition.
Stop. See your own nature—that is the wisdom. Rest in that recognition.
