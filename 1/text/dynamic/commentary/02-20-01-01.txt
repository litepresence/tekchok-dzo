[8083-8102]
Turns to nameless samsara. Life that light-liberates is special. From Tal 'Gyur: "This from showing own object, conditions not entering—wide-open spontaneous, from object-knowing appearance aspect, each directly liberated from own ground."

What difference since khregs chod also explained body-liberated from aggregates without appearance measure? Great difference! Khregs chod liberates but from partless particles, cannot go to light. Without going to light, vajra body not established—occasional illusion body not cut by ultimate. Without obtaining light body, great transference body not obtained, others' benefit great support not established.

From light and particle dissolving aspect, great transference meaning not done, eyes, superknowledges, miracles—great small difference exists.

[8103-8125]
Second: Rigpa primordially said luminous, khregs chod measures emptiness, not seeing own light. Thod rgal pressing key, dharmata nature's luminosity inwardly held, objects' self-dawn luminosity outwardly appearing shown in method—surpasses.

From Self-Arising: "This self-appearance rigpa king—all have, unrecognized."

Third: Rigpa's wisdom khregs chod not-viewable, covered, not seen, decisively cut as one. Thod rgal opens wisdom's expanse, dharmata's sun rays clear.

From Tal 'Gyur: "Dharmata directly appearing, destroys intellectual apprehending view."

Fourth: Khregs chod depending on coarse channel-winds, thod rgal holding light channel essence, placing lamp on actual path.

From that: "Also channels and delusion wheels, nature-appearing five wisdoms."

Emaho! Seven specialties of thod rgal!

[8126-8163]
Khregs chod from six faculties' unpurified gates, seeking clarity in mind's dharmas. Thod rgal pure light-luminous gate, wisdom wind urged, four lamps' appearance dawns—surpasses.

From that: "How from gate arising, entering wind urges, from four lamps four activities arise."

Sixth: Khregs chod looking in rigpa self-clear faculty, seeking clarity. Thod rgal outer-inner wisdom wide-open faculty, expanse and wisdom meeting-free appearance, actually analyzing—special.

From Tal 'Gyur: "Pure expanse lamp, thigle body and deluded appearance, nature itself and own-nature, nondual meeting-free appearing."

Seventh: Khregs chod making outer objects inner mind delusion appear, accepting-rejecting-free increase, quickly not liberating. Thod rgal from moment with key, outer-inner deluded appearance with delusion-grasping self-dissolved, not abandoned in-place pure increase not depending.

Wisdom increase-appearing like waxing moon, above increasing, appearance four measures reached, quickly liberating.

From that: "Appearance mode not delusion, pure nature cause-conditions, existent nonexistent self-pure, five gates object-grasping pure, arising coarse pure, wisdom pure increase-appearing shows, from that exhausted dharmata."

These specialties if analyzed finely inconceivable, summarized spoken. Know great difference by wisdom eye possessing!

Emaho! Thod rgal's direct seeing!

[8165-8194]
Second meaning showing special thod rgal itself has three: general showing three-key dharmata wheel; particular explanation of day-night luminous wheel; extensive showing meaning expanse wisdom wheel. The nature is complete.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

First has four: body three keys; gate three keys; expanse three keys; object three keys.

First: body's three postures however suitable, inner relaxed with purpose of channel-wind abiding pleasant. If deliberately restrained, wind etc. reverses and pervades, channels contract and over-tighten.

With gaze, when wind key very loose, outwardly held expelled from mouth—this special dharma key great crucial point.

Also nose exhaling-inhaling is common method—filling four wheels, generating mind clear samadhi. That method has wind reverse, pervade, swirl, dull—four obstacles arise, deluded appearance not dawning.

Here not making wind purification increase path, four wheels inwardly filled, mind all-thoughts ceasing but not completely ceasable, so action wind self-ceased expelled from mouth.

Nose taste-pure enters, then all four wheels' channels enter, different thoughts moving horse—here blocked, mouth and throat connected, throat channels hollow pipe's inside mind horse self-ceased expelled.

Wind mouth slowly outwardly drawn, held as long as abiding, horse and person each separate, person heart-inside rigpa dissolves, unthought meditation natural-flow achieved.

Emaho! Body keys for thod rgal!

[8195-8223]
Wind gathering obstacle, mind unhappy; affliction thought movement; heart stabbing—all cleared! At those times, forcefully expelling is supreme key.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Not knowing this wind key, even meditating, appearance increase and signs measures certainly won't arise.

Second: seeing gate three keys—any gaze posture done, not restrained by effort, inner relaxed natural flow made. Eyes unmoving, gaze pressing is key.

From Tal 'Gyur: "Distant placement unmoving is key. This time three gazes combined."

Third: expanse three keys for guiding—eyes slowly corners and up-down, expanse appearance gap, eyes unmoving, knowing unmoved, placed in clear-emptiness.

From that: "Expanse key is guiding."

From Rtsal Rdzogs: "Dharmata memory awakened sky, five masses appearing golden garuda hovering. Apprehending grasping thought-extreme free manner soaring. Self-appearance direction-fall-free sky, empty-luminous elaboration-free garuda hovering. Appearance without apprehending manner soaring."

[8224-8250]
Fourth: outer object sky cloud-dissolved placed, rigpa clear-awake, appearance increase fast. Inner object expanse lamp placed, light-mother-child connected. Secret object rigpa self-clear placed, primordial purity dharma-exhausted intention self-place clear key.

From Self-Arising: "Sky empty mandala, uncontrived four lamps, unceased meaning clear. Rigpa expanse lamp, sky empty expanse center, expanse nature light body."

Emaho! Object keys for light meditation!

[8251-8266]
From Tal 'Gyur: "This object key like this: cloud-free outer object empty, yogin sky bird path abides. Not separate from this dharmata."

Also: "Object appearing characteristic: sky blue limitless, light and color shape, five wisdoms self-appearing showing. Pure expanse lamp, thigle body and deluded appearance, nature itself and own-nature, nondual meeting-free appearing."

[8267-8302]
At this time, channels-inside wind moves, subtle thoughts sha-ra-ra arise, but no harm to direct meaning. Thoughts themselves cannot stand by themselves, liberated going along—like falcon catching prey flying. Scattered objects disperse, but unlike before chain link continuing, no distraction.

Karma and latencies not accumulated. Light meditation not destroyed. Dynamic display entered, wisdom spontaneously born, opening opportunity.

Gaze posture restrained, thick thoughts self-ceased; thin subtle thoughts all self-liberated.

From Tal 'Gyur: "Intention unmoved from one. Appearance appearance's immediate clear, like face and mirror. Liberation that and that itself liberated. Knowing movement empty-release. Seeing-knowing-rigpa not different. That itself self-liberated. One known all-liberated, two three number extreme exhausted."

Emaho! Self-liberation in direct seeing!

[8303-8318]
Seeing time, sky center lightning edge unmoving looking is key. The nature is complete.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

From Letterless: "Rigpa resting instruction itself. This is secret heart. Eyes very held, also examined meeting-free. From eye corner expanse arises, light subtle swirling arises. Nature chain link, subtle and moving and moving. Eyes sky element examined, Buddha body thigle dawns. That intention warmth obtained, rigpa body chain link, body with appearance."

[8319-8342]
Here establishing three light bindings on meaning: intention essence binding, mind stain purification manner; nature unmoved even placement manner; from that signs measure time certain dawning manner—three. Rest in this understanding.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

First has three: intention essence actual; mind and latencies' example; separation manner brief binding.

First: from Samantabhadra heart mirror—"Unmoving sky, thus rigpa clear. Clear unmoving depth immeasurable manner. Empty-luminous expansive great bliss expanse pervading. One-pointed clear, ultimate expanse manner. Unmixed complete, spontaneous ground abides."

Rigpa's nature, four wisdoms self-dynamic dawning, showing realization superior seeing dharmata.

Four wisdoms from Self-Arising: "Also rigpa's nature, wisdom aspects four possessing. Wisdom aspects four like this: liberation-making wisdom, all liberating."

Emaho! Wisdom essence of dharmata!

[8375-8405]
Listen! Now Longchenpa brings the Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror tantra to drive the point home. These aren't just pretty metaphors— they're precise instructions on how afflictions bind you, and how wisdom liberates.

"Aho! Vajra holder, listen!" The tantra addresses you directly. See your own nature

"Immature conceptions in samsara—like a corpse bound in iron." Feel this! Your rigid thoughts, your fixed ideas about reality—they're the iron chains. Not liberated, the time of liberation doesn't arise. As long as ignorance binds you like this, you won't change, won't transform.

"Ignorance is like water—afflictions gather." Just as water collects in low places, ignorance is the ground (gzhi) where all afflictions pool. "Anger is fire like an eon-ending conflagration." It burns everything! "Desire for things is like drinking salt water." The more you indulge, the more you thirst—never satisfied.

"Delusion is thick like darkness in an empty house." You can't see anything clearly. "Pride and arrogance like a crushing mountain." It weighs you down, flattens you. "Jealousy and ill-will like a narrow ravine gorge." Trapped, constricted, no room to move.

These five afflictions obscure wisdom. But look deeper—mind is like a bitch thief, consciousness like a forest monkey, mind like impure mud, all-ground like a being-pig, knowing like a feather carried by wind. Grasping and grasped like man and woman entangled. Karma's varieties like birds caught in a net. Suffering's varieties like ripples on water.

The result of affliction? No method to endure it! This samsaric suffering, this spear of grasping-grasped—by doing you won't get out. But by placing awareness, you go out!

Emaho! The secret mantra king transforms afflictions into wisdom! Like raising a lamp in an empty house—the wisdom lamp makes ignorance known. Not by fighting it, not by suppressing it, but by recognizing its nature. This is the path, friend!

[8406-8437]
Third: separation manner brief binding has three: direct self-time separation actual; separation validity placement; other expressions. Recognition is immediate.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

First: outer appearance light-luminous seen, without delusion inner self-clear meditation self-place clear time, mind and wisdom instant separated, all-ground eight collections wisdom-covered, samsara dharmas not clear. Past self-nature spontaneously complete.

From Samantabhadra heart mirror—"Rigpa free from mind actual Buddha. Wisdom free from mind actual intention. Rays free from darkness actual pure appearance."

From Self-Arising: "Rigpa free from mind actual Buddha. Vajrasattva free from mind I. Clear-illuminator appearance without thought knows. Thought-free wisdom equality, self's great self-liberation."

[8438-8456]
Second validity: placed unmoving in appearance nature, samsara dharmas self-dissolved gone—like water unmoving muddiness self-dissolved. Recognition is immediate.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Jewel water clear example shows intention depth immeasurable.

From earlier: "Self-arisen nectar drop this, like jewel water clear. With impurity placed, impurity clears. Thus heart-essence instruction this, applied affliction not become stain."

Alone loose appearance companion-dawning. Unborn expanse wisdom light-luminous. All have, all not seeing. Inconceivable like sky expanse. Clear shining like sun light. Unchanging like Mount Meru. Deep immeasurable like ocean depth. Unstained like mud lotus. Unapprehended like water moon. Appearing as anything like sky miracle. Clear complete like rainbow.

Emaho! Separation from all obscurations!

[8457-8478]
"Turn all scriptures to root great scripture. Turn all instructions to free-from-expression. Turn all practices to free-from-activity. Turn all conducts to supreme uncontrived. Turn all meditations to great clear non-grasping. Turn all views to wide-open unattached.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. Turn all results to great wisdom decisive. All these to one non-abiding expanse. Abandon all samsara activities. Always familiarize with wisdom appearance. Know wisdom dawning time. Know ground dharmas all as essence-nature-compassion three.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. Know path dharmas all as five bodies five wisdoms. Know result dharmas all as three bodies irreversible. Know essence dharmas all as empty. Know nature dharmas all as clear. Know compassion dharmas all pervading beings. Know wisdom dharmas all unmixed. Know light dharmas all non-grasping. Know ray dharmas all without dispersion-gathering. Know rigpa dharmas all free from self-thought. Thus all dharmas as neither thought nor examined—turn!"

[8479-8490]
Second: nature unmoved even placement has two: briefly showing essence nature placement. This is the treasury's heart.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

From Tal 'Gyur: "Meditation characteristic appearance mode: characteristic empty-luminous rigpa, nature wherever unmixed, grasping and grasped extreme exhausted, dharmata own face pure."

Extensive explanation placing nature appearance:

From Sixth Treasury: "Past three bodies nose-placed."

Emaho! All teachings converge in natural flow!

[8491-8524]
Future three bodies back-supported, present three bodies enjoyed—is Buddhas' result made present, called primordially abiding time-three equality. The nature is complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Past five wisdoms made ground, future five wisdoms peak-placed, present five wisdoms made path—called clear by clear light gathered, time-three equality rigpa yoga.

Past rigpa confident, future rigpa measured, present rigpa made path—called mother held child, time-three equality rigpa yoga.

Past thigle part-held, future thigle mind-placed, present thigle gathered as one—called single root cut, time-three equality rolled yoga.

Past expanse interval-connected, future expanse extended, present expanse one ground abiding—called rigpa entered expanse, time-three equality primordially connected abiding.

Past lamps nose-placed, future lamps hand-held, present lamps clarified—called empty dharmadhatu lamp self-pure view, time-three equality primordially appearing.

Past lights path-placed, future lights mind-placed, present lights mind-placed—called all appearance self-reached, time-three equality primordially meeting-free.

Emaho! Time-three equality in all aspects!

[8586-8625]
"Sound also by this self-power obtained. In brief, six superknowledges, fortunate one obtains, self and others' benefits, this person will accomplish."

Second: spontaneously complete samadhi measure—"Three bodies self-arisen intention, in brief thus experience measure obtained. Nirmanakaya yoga conduct, previously nonexistent great compassion, supreme arises in own stream. At this time nirmanakaya samadhi obtained. Clear unthought knowing experience, called sambhogakaya samadhi. Unleaked empty thigle body, effortlessly self-dawn time, dharmakaya samadhi, yogin possessing obtains."

Third: unmoved even placement time has two: light-luminous directly appearing time; instruction source striking time.

First: "All appearance self-powered becomes, rigpa directly shown time, called intention true-seeing time. All appearance self-directly dawns, experience seed increasing time, rigpa itself scale reached time. Being arising power exhausted, knowing inwardly looking time, rigpa source striking time. Dharmata condition-free, all appearance blissfully expansive time, called dharmata mother-child even time."

Emaho! Signs of samadhi accomplishment!

[8632-8658]
"When samadhi power becomes, know lamp pure manifestation. When special power arises, know samadhi path widens. When rigpa body seen, know without hope. When special wisdom arises in stream, know mara deception.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was. When effortless conduct overflows, know wisdom entry direction. When empty object pervades, know light. When lamp object appears, know expanse and object."

From Seng Ge Rtsal Rdzogs: "Appearance gradually gradually, skilled should examine well. Very subtle and moving time, familiarization firmly abide. Fluctuating and subtle and moving time, seeing well seize. Rounded and subtle and swirling time, skilled unmoved samadhi stabilize. Stacked and fiery and body-appearing time, familiarization appearance increase seize."

[8659-8670]
Second: day-night light-luminous wheel has three: expanse light-luminous dawning basis recognition; from that lamp practice showing; day-night wheel meditation manner certainty. The nature is complete.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

First: though explained before, here extremely summarized clear showing five: expanse abiding manner; lamp location manner; expanse-rigpa dawning manner; practice manner; specialty certainty manner.

Emaho! Day and night luminous wheel!

[8679-8695]
"From abode entered path gate, variously emerged engaging meaning. This is the treasury's heart.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Sky wherever pervading beings, rigpa meaning also just that."

Where is it? From that: "Emaho! Rigpa's dharmata abides in own heart center. Father-mother two possessing, method and wisdom manner abides. Father possessing method body, mother possessing wisdom body, light and rays manner abides. Expanse and rigpa well adorned, spontaneously complete great thigle abides."

[8696-8718]
Also, how does rigpa in light expanse abide as body and wisdom? Certain location is what and what?

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

From Rtsal Rdzogs: "Own own citra jewel inside, colored light blazing vase manner. Inside wisdom fire light blazing. Measureless wisdom various appearing. Body essence each each, speech emanation immeasurable, heart intention transcending one."

"All-ground dharmadhatu great treasure, rigpa wisdom lump abides. Appearance non-grasping object treasure, rigpa wisdom expanse abides. Secret gathering jewel eight-cornered treasure, rigpa wisdom lump abides."

Emaho! Rigpa abides in the heart center!

[8729-8773]
"End time child egg shell liberated like." From Rtsal Rdzogs: "Ground-abiding rigpa, wisdom expanse three bodies complete, like peacock egg, inner light wisdom clearly shown. Path-dawning rigpa, like rainbow shown. End-conveyed rigpa, peacock chick eggs, burst engaging like."

Also, when wisdom not ripened, all opportunity opens. Appearing time light. Familiarizing time body-appears.

From that: "Elaboration-free expanse itself, light-luminous immediate contact arose. Appearing time light appears, complete time self-appearance. Familiarizing time becomes body. Wisdom method connected, ultimate five mandalas seen."

[8753-8773]
Thus abiding body and rigpa and expanse and wisdom characteristics: The nature is complete.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

From that same: "Body characteristic like this: unchanging and clear, empty and thought-free. Rigpa characteristic like this: subtle and moving, chain link and moving. Expanse characteristic like this: vast and spontaneous thick, empty limitless, clear and warm and cool, wide and moving nature holding, pervading and extreme edge fence. Wisdom characteristic like this: arising and arising and self-clear, primordial and knowing and realized, clear and shining and pervasive, appearing and dark and opening, empty and clear wisdom supreme, secret mantra characteristics considered."

Emaho! Characteristics of the natural state!

[8774-8804]
Second: lamp location manner—gods one fathom, demigods four inches, humans one colored-light, animals self-clear. The nature is complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Bodhicitta arrow-length, nirmanakaya one fathom.

Own light wisdom appearance existing:

From that same: "Wisdom dharmata great small, six appearances' directions, well explained like this: Tusita abides one fathom, Strife abides four inches, Equal abides one colored-light, Two-possessing self-clear only, Hunger sesame only, Suffering horse-hoof only, thus explained abiding. Buddhas immeasurable, Bodhisattvas arrow-length, Nirmanakaya abides one fathom. Buddhas Bodhisattvas and, Nirmanakaya and gods, directly object appearing. Those below five objects, not shown not seen."

[8805-8825]
Also, mid-space self-appearance Buddha Bodhisattva gods three lamp appearance great is object vast. Other five own body object, thus small.

Third: expanse-rigpa dawning manner has two: expanse inside existing five lights wisdom self-dawn outer object blue pervasive great light; from that blazing five-possessing great wisdom light two object-appearance self-dawn.

Rigpa is vajra chain link appearance part body with.

From Rtsal Rdzogs: "All Buddhas' peak intention, not beyond expanse-rigpa two."

From Vajra Chain Link itself: "Part body inconceivable, self-arisen expanse lamp, self-appearance light inconceivable, thigle empty lamp, ray-possessing thigle inconceivable, five wisdoms' nature, indicating words inconceivable, condition-free object appearance, unceased arising inconceivable."

Emaho! Expance and rigpa dawn as light!

[8826-8830]
Fourth: practice manner has two: key binding; from that arising experience appearance. The nature is complete.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[02-20-01-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
