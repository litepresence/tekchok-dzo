[8083-8091]
The Treasury opens where no name can reach—samsara itself a mere echo.
Life that light-liberates carries a special excellence, for it transcends
all conditions that bind ordinary existence.

[8083-8091]
This old hermit once asked: what distinguishes thod rgal from khregs chod?
Both liberate, yet the difference is vast as sky from earth. Khregs chod
liberates from partless particles, but cannot reach the light. Without
entering that light, the vajra body remains unestablished—the occasional
illusion body cannot be severed by ultimate truth.

Three words. Cut. Rest. Remain. Trekchö is the blade that severs; tögal is
the light that dawns once severing is complete. You cannot see sunlight
while clutching clouds.

[8092-8101]
The wisdom spoken of primordially as luminous—in khregs chod it is
measured as emptiness, its own light unseen. But thod rgal, pressing the
crucial point, captures the luminosity of dharmata's nature within, while
the self-dawn luminosity of objects appears outwardly—thus it surpasses.

[8092-8101]
Therefore. Thus. The systematic distinction: trekchö apprehends primordial
purity as emptiness—profound, necessary, yet incomplete. Like tasting wine
but never seeing the vineyard. Tögal adds the vision: luminosity dawning
as appearance, not just as absence.

Between the empty and the luminous, we find the path complete. Not two
paths but two aspects of one recognition. Coin-like with two faces—both
necessary for value, neither alone sufficient.

[8102-8109]
The wisdom of rigpa in khregs chod remains covered, not seen, decisively
cut as one. Thod rgal opens wisdom's expanse—the sun rays of dharmata
clear and unobscured.

[8102-8109]
This wanderer spent twelve years practicing trekchö. Profound peace, deep
settling. Yet something remained—like a room cleared of furniture but still
dark. Then tögal instruction: the light was always there, just not seen.

The wisdom covered in trekchö: like a lamp wrapped in cloth. The cloth is
emptiness-understanding; the light is luminosity. Remove cloth, see light.
Both necessary—without cloth, no protection; without light, no illumination.

[8110-8116]
Khregs chod relies upon coarse channels and winds. Thod rgal holds the
essence of light channels, placing the lamp upon the actual path.
Emaho! Such is the specialty of direct crossing.

[8110-8116]
The light channels are not different from coarse channels
—same anatomy, different recognition. Like water that can quench thirst or
reflect stars. Coarse channels carry winds; light channels carry vision.
Both present, both functional, both pointing to the same body.

The lamp upon the actual path: not metaphor but physiology. Certain gaze,
certain posture, certain wind—vision dawns. Like learning to whistle:
position, pressure, breath. Then sound comes effortlessly.

[8117-8124]
See what is. The lamp appearances of the four lights dawn through the
wisdom wind's urging—this is the gate of pure luminosity.

[8117-8124]
This old fool sat in dark retreat for three months, watching the play of
light behind closed eyes. First: sparks like fireflies. Then: orbs like
bubbles. Then: patterns like woven fabric. Finally: the clear void itself,
shining.

The four lights are not imagination—they are the natural display of rigpa
when conditions are correct. Like morning dew forming when temperature and
humidity align. Not miraculous, just natural. The miraculous is that we
call it miraculous.

[8125-8132]
Khregs chod seeks clarity within the unpurified gates of the six faculties,
searching in mind's dharmas. Thod rgal's gate of pure luminosity opens
to the expanse and wisdom meeting-free—directly analyzing appearances
without acceptance or rejection.

[8125-8132]
Therefore. Thus. The gate distinction: six faculties are sense gates—eye,
ear, nose, tongue, body, mind. Trekchö works through these, purifying
perception gradually. Tögal bypasses them, opening to direct vision—the
eye of wisdom, not the physical eye.

Meeting-free: expanse and wisdom are not two things meeting. Like wetness
and water—not meeting, not separate. Just so. The gate opens when this is
recognized, not when something new enters.

[8133-8142]
The seventh specialty: khregs chod makes outer objects appear as mind's
delusion, increasing without acceptance or rejection, yet not quickly
liberating. Thod rgal, from the moment of holding the key, dissolves
outer and inner deluded appearances with their grasping, without abandoning
them in their place—pure increase without dependence.

[8133-8142]
This mountain dweller watched the distinction play out over years. Trekchö
practitioners: peaceful, settled, gradual progress. Tögal practitioners:
sudden shifts, dramatic visions, rapid transformation. Both valid, both
necessary, both leading to the same.

The key is recognition: outer objects as mind's delusion—trekchö sees this.
Tögal sees through it entirely, not by making it different but by seeing
its nature was never deluded. Like realizing the snake was always a rope.

[8143-8163]
The meaning shows thod rgal's special nature through three wheels: the
dharmata wheel with three keys; the day-night luminous wheel; the vast
expanse wisdom wheel.

[8143-8163]
Three wheels, three domains of practice. The dharmata wheel: body, speech,
mind keys. The day-night wheel: luminosity in waking, sleeping, and the
interval between. The vast expanse wheel: the recognition that all three
are the display of one wisdom.

This old vagabond practiced the three keys for years. Body posture: not
rigid, not loose—like a strung bow. Speech: not silent, not chattering—
like a stream in autumn. Mind: not focused, not scattered—like sky holding
clouds. Then the wheels turn naturally.

[8164-8173]
The body's three postures—whatever suits, with inner relaxation for
channel-winds to abide pleasantly. If deliberately restrained, winds
reverse and pervade, channels contract too tightly. The crucial point:
when the wind key is very loose, hold outwardly and expel from the mouth.

[8164-8173]
From the treasury of practical instruction: the body is not an obstacle
but the vehicle. Three postures—lion, elephant, sage. Each suits different
constitution, different time, different need. Not one superior, all
functional.

Inner relaxation: not slackness but presence without tension. Cat-like
watching a bird—alert, yet muscles soft. Channels open, winds flow, vision
arises. Force blocks; relaxation allows.

[8174-8194]
Wind gathering obstacles, unhappy mind, affliction thoughts moving,
heart stabbing—all cleared! At those times, forcefully expelling is
the supreme key.

[8174-8194]
This old hermit knows this obstacle well. Wind gathers in the chest like
water behind a dam. Thoughts race, heart pounds, meditation impossible.
The supreme key: exhale completely, forcefully, from the depth of the belly.
Nine times, then rest. The dam breaks, water flows, mind clears.

Not suppression but release. Not control but allowing. The wind that was
obstacle becomes vehicle when properly directed.

[8195-8199]
The seeing gate's three keys—any gaze posture, not restrained by effort,
inner relaxed, natural flow. Eyes unmoving, gaze pressing is the key.

[8195-8199]
Therefore. Thus. The gaze: not looking at but looking from. The eye of
wisdom opens when physical eyes relax. Unmoving: not staring but resting.
Pressing: not forcing but steady. Natural flow: not directing but allowing.

Three gazes for three capacities: upward for sharp, level for moderate,
downward for dull. Not hierarchy but recognition of where one stands.

[8200-8207]
The expanse's three keys for guiding—eyes slowly to corners and up-down,
expanse appearance in the gap, eyes unmoving, knowing unmoved, placed
in clear-emptiness.

[8200-8207]
The integration reveals: guiding the expanse is not doing but allowing.
Eyes move slowly—corners, up, down—then rest. In the gap between movements,
appearance arises. Not created, not found, just recognized.

This wanderer practiced this until the room seemed to breathe. Walls
pulsed, space glowed, the distinction between inside and outside dissolved.
Then realized: it was always so, just not noticed.

[8208-8223]
Outer object: sky cloud-dissolved, rigpa clear-awake, appearance increase
fast. Inner object: expanse lamp placed, light mother-child connected.
Secret object: rigpa self-clear placed, primordial purity dharma-exhausted
intention self-place clear key.

[8208-8223]
Three objects, three levels of practice. Outer: the sky as support, clouds
as thoughts, rigpa as the knowing. Inner: the lamp of awareness within,
mother-light (ground) and child-light (path) meeting. Secret: rigpa knowing
itself without intermediary, dharma exhausted, intention fulfilled.

Like nesting dolls: outer contains inner, inner contains secret, secret
contains all. Yet all are the same wood.

[8224-8250]
At this time, channels-inside wind moves, subtle thoughts arise sha-ra-ra,
but no harm to direct meaning. Thoughts themselves cannot stand by
themselves, liberated going along—like falcon catching prey flying.

[8224-8250]
This old fool feared thoughts for decades. Tried to stop them, control them,
transcend them. Then realized: thoughts are like wind through trees—sound
without source, movement without mover. Sha-ra-ra: the chatter of mind,
harmless as bird song.

The falcon metaphor: rigpa catches thoughts in flight, not by stopping
them but by accompanying them to their source. The prey returns to the
hunter; thoughts liberate in their arising.

[8251-8266]
Scattered objects disperse, yet unlike before, no chain link continuing,
no distraction. Karma and latencies not accumulated. Light meditation
not destroyed. Dynamic display entered, wisdom spontaneously born,
opening opportunity.

[8251-8266]
Therefore. Thus. The mechanism: objects scatter—that's perception. But
without the chain of grasping, no karma created. Like fire burning without
fuel—flame there, but nothing accumulated. Light meditation: the natural
luminosity that persists whether focused or scattered.

Dynamic display: the world as movement, wisdom as knowing the movement.
Not separate, not identical. Like dancer and dance—one yet distinguishable.

[8267-8302]
Seeing time, sky center lightning edge unmoving looking is key. From
the Letterless: eyes very held, examined meeting-free, from eye corner
expanse arises, light subtle swirling arises.

[8267-8302]
The sky-center is not above but within. The lightning
edge: the border between appearance and emptiness, where both meet yet
neither dominates. Unmoving looking: the gaze that does not chase, does
not avoid, does not grasp.

This mountain dweller once saw lightning split the sky during practice.
For an instant, everything was clear—sound, light, the whole display.
Then gone. But the memory remained, a reference point: this is possible,
this is real, this is the nature.

[8303-8318]
Here establishing three light bindings: intention essence binding, mind
stain purification manner; nature unmoved even placement manner; from
that signs measure time certain dawning manner. Rigpa's nature, four
wisdoms self-dynamic dawning, showing realization superior seeing dharmata.

[8303-8318]
Three bindings, three stabilizations. Intention bound to essence: not
wandering. Mind stains purified: not obscured. Nature unmoved: not disturbed.
From these, signs arise—measure of progress, not goals but indicators.

Four wisdoms dawning: mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing.
Not achievements but recognitions. Like realizing the four walls of a room
were always there, just not seen as distinct.

[8319-8342]
From the Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror tantra—these are not
mere metaphors but precise instructions. Your rigid thoughts, fixed
ideas about reality—they are iron chains binding like a corpse.

[8319-8342]
This old vagabond carried rigid ideas for thirty years. Dzogchen is this,
Buddhism is that, reality is such. Then one day, the burden became too
heavy. Dropped it all. Freedom—not the freedom of new ideas, but freedom
from ideas entirely.

The tantra's mirror: Vajrasattva's heart reflects all without holding.
Your heart can do the same. Not through effort but through stopping the
effort to be something, know something, achieve something.

[8343-8374]
Ignorance is like water—afflictions gather there. Anger is fire like
an eon-ending conflagration. Desire is like drinking salt water, never
satisfied. Delusion is thick darkness in an empty house. Pride is a
crushing mountain. Jealousy is a narrow ravine gorge. These five obscure
wisdom.

[8343-8374]
Five poisons, five wisdoms—same energy, different recognition. Ignorance
as water: fluid, shapeless, accepting all afflictions. Transmuted: mirror-
like wisdom, reflecting all without holding.

Anger as fire: destructive, purifying, transformative. Transmuted:
equality wisdom, seeing all as same essence.

Desire as salt water: thirst-creating, never satisfied. Transmuted:
discriminating wisdom, knowing what is appropriate.

Delusion as darkness: obscuring, concealing. Transmuted: all-accomplishing
wisdom, acting without confusion.

Pride as mountain: solid, high, immovable. Transmuted: dharmadhatu wisdom,
spacious, all-pervading.

This hermit spent years trying to eliminate the poisons. Then realized:
elimination is another poison. Recognition is the only transmutation.

[8375-8405]
Mind is like a bitch thief, consciousness like a forest monkey, mind
like impure mud, all-ground like a being-pig, knowing like a feather
carried by wind. Grasping and grasped like man and woman entangled.
Karma's varieties like birds caught in a net.

[8375-8405]
Therefore. Thus. The systematic defilement: ordinary mind steals, consciousness
swings, mind is muddied, all-ground wallows, knowing is blown about.
Grasping-grasped entwined, karma caught.

But each metaphor contains liberation. The thief stops when nothing is
stolen; the monkey rests when no trees; mud clears when still; the pig
wakes when fed; the feather falls when wind ceases; the entangled separate
when clinging stops; the birds fly free when net breaks.

Not different natures—same nature, different condition.

[8406-8437]
The result of affliction? No method to endure! This samsaric suffering,
this spear of grasping-grasped—by doing you won't get out. But by placing
awareness, you go out. The secret mantra king transforms afflictions
into wisdom—like raising a lamp in an empty house.

[8406-8437]
This wanderer endured suffering that words cannot hold. Lost family, health,
home. Despair like a cave without exit. Then: placing awareness on the
despair itself. Not changing it, not understanding it, just knowing it.
The spear of grasping-grasped—when grasping is seen as empty, the spear
has no one to pierce.

Lamp in empty house: the afflictions are the empty house; awareness is
the lamp. House unchanged, but now seen. The transformation is not of
affliction but of relationship to affliction.

[8438-8456]
Turn all scriptures to root great scripture. Turn all instructions to
free-from-expression. Turn all practices to free-from-activity. Turn
all conducts to supreme uncontrived. Turn all meditations to great clear
non-grasping. Turn all views to wide-open unattached.

[8438-8456]
These turnings are not negations but recognitions. The
root great scripture is your own mind. Free-from-expression is speech
that knows its emptiness. Free-from-activity is action without doer.
Supreme uncontrived is conduct that arises naturally. Great clear non-
grasping is meditation without meditator. Wide-open unattached is view
without viewer.

This old fool spent years turning—scriptures, instructions, practices,
conducts, meditations, views. Each turning a loosening, each loosening
a relaxing, each relaxing a recognition. Until there was nothing left
to turn, nothing to turn toward, nothing to turn away from.

[8457-8478]
Turn all results to great wisdom decisive. All these to one non-abiding
expanse. Abandon all samsara activities. Always familiarize with wisdom
appearance. Know wisdom dawning time.

[8457-8478]
The final turning: result itself turned into wisdom. Great wisdom decisive:
knowing that cuts, knowing that decides, knowing that ends doubt. Non-
abiding expanse: not dwelling in samsara, not dwelling in nirvana, not
dwelling in between.

This mountain dweller abandoned many activities—some wisely, some foolishly.
The key distinction: abandoning samsara activities is not becoming inactive
but becoming wise in activity. Familiarizing with wisdom appearance:
seeing every appearance as the display of wisdom, not different, not
separate, not other.

[8479-8490]
Past three bodies nose-placed, future three bodies back-supported,
present three bodies enjoyed—is Buddhas' result made present, called
primordially abiding time-three equality.

[8479-8490]
Three times, three kayas, one recognition. Past: the kayas as potential,
nose-placed (leading forward). Future: the kayas as goal, back-supported
(relying on practice). Present: the kayas as experience, enjoyed (actualized).

Time-three equality: past, present, future are not sequential but aspects
of one timeless awareness. Mountain-like, seen from three valleys—each
sees different face, yet the mountain is one.

[8491-8524]
Past five wisdoms made ground, future five wisdoms peak-placed, present
five wisdoms made path—called clear by clear light gathered, time-three
equality rigpa yoga.

[8491-8524]
Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation continues: five wisdoms
through three times. Ground, peak, path—not separate wisdoms but same
wisdom seen from different vantage. Clear light gathered: the accumulation
that is not accumulation, the gathering that is recognition.

Rigpa yoga: the yoga of awareness itself, not practices done to awareness
but awareness recognizing itself. Like fire burning—fire does not do
yoga to become fire; it simply burns.

[8525-8561]
Past rigpa confident, future rigpa measured, present rigpa made path—called
mother held child, time-three equality rigpa yoga. Past thigle part-held,
future thigle mind-placed, present thigle gathered as one—called single
root cut, time-three equality rolled yoga.

[8525-8561]
Mother and child: ground rigpa and path rigpa. Mother: primordial, never
separate. Child: recognized, reconnected. Held: the recognition that the
child was never other than mother. Not reunion but recognition of never
being separated.

Thigle—sphere, bindu, essence—part-held, mind-placed, gathered. The journey
of essence from partial recognition to full embodiment. Single root cut:
the one cause, the one source, the one recognition that ends all seeking.

[8562-8585]
Past expanse interval-connected, future expanse extended, present expanse
one ground abiding—called rigpa entered expanse, time-three equality
primordially connected abiding. Past lamps nose-placed, future lamps
hand-held, present lamps clarified—called empty dharmadhatu lamp self-pure
view, time-three equality primordially appearing.

[8562-8585]
This old vagabond traces these connections in meditation. Expanse: from
interval (potential) to extended (path) to one ground (fruition). The
connection was always there, just not seen. The extension is not creation
but revelation. The one ground is not new but recognized.

Lamps: nose-placed (future-directed), hand-held (present-grasped), clarified
(recognized). The dharmadhatu lamp—emptiness as light, void as luminosity.
Self-pure view: seeing purity without purifier, clarity without clarifier.

[8586-8625]
Past lights path-placed, future lights mind-placed, present lights mind-placed—called
all appearance self-reached, time-three equality primordially meeting-free.

[8586-8625]
Lights through time: placed on path, then in mind, then recognized as
mind itself. Self-reached: not arrived at through effort but recognized
as always present. Meeting-free: not two things meeting but one nature
appearing as two.

This mountain dweller sees lights every morning—sunrise through the window.
The light that illuminates the room is the same light that illuminates
the mind. Meeting-free: light does not meet darkness; it dispels it.
Awareness does not meet confusion; it clarifies it.

[8626-8631]
Sound also by this self-power obtained. In brief, six superknowledges,
fortunate one obtains, self and others' benefits, this person will
accomplish. Three bodies self-arisen intention, in brief thus experience
measure obtained.

[8626-8631]
Therefore. Thus. The completion: sound, six knowledges, benefit, accomplishment.
Three kayas self-arisen—arising from themselves, not created, not made,
not achieved. Experience measure: the yardstick is experience itself,
not someone else's standard.

This old fool once sought six superknowledges as achievements. Then
realized: they are natural expressions of clear awareness, not powers
to gain. Like the sun naturally illumines—it does not achieve illumination.

[8632-8658]
Nirmanakaya yoga conduct, previously nonexistent great compassion,
supreme arises in own stream. At this time nirmanakaya samadhi obtained.
Clear unthought knowing experience, called sambhogakaya samadhi.

[8632-8658]
Compassion arising spontaneously—not cultivated, not trained, not forced.
Previously nonexistent: did not exist as something separate from awareness.
Supreme: not superior but complete. Arises in own stream: your own
continuity, your own nature, your own display.

Samadhi of nirmanakaya: activity without actor, benefit without benefactor.
Samadhi of sambhogakaya: enjoyment without enjoyer, clarity without
cognition. These are not states to achieve but recognitions of what is.

[8659-8670]
Unleaked empty thigle body, effortlessly self-dawn time, dharmakaya
samadhi, yogin possessing obtains. Day-night light-luminous wheel has
three: expanse light-luminous dawning basis recognition; from that lamp
practice showing; day-night wheel meditation manner certainty.

[8659-8670]
Unleaked: not contaminated by grasping. Empty thigle: essence as emptiness,
form as luminosity. Effortlessly self-dawn: arising without cause, present
without support. Dharmakaya samadhi: the samadhi that is not entered or
exited, the awareness that is not meditated or distracted.

Day-night wheel: luminosity in all states—waking, dreaming, deep sleep.
Not different wheels but one wheel turning through different phases.
Recognition in one, recognition in all.

[8671-8678]
From abode entered path gate, variously emerged engaging meaning. Sky
wherever pervading beings, rigpa meaning also just that. Rigpa's dharmata
abides in own heart center. Father-mother two possessing, method and
wisdom manner abides.

[8671-8678]
This wanderer finds the teaching everywhere now. Sky: vast, pervasive,
unobstructed. Rigpa: vast, pervasive, unobstructed. The abode is the heart
center—not physical heart but the center of awareness. Father-mother:
method and wisdom, skillful means and emptiness knowing, appearing as two,
abiding as one.

[8679-8695]
Own own citra jewel inside, colored light blazing vase manner. Inside
wisdom fire light blazing. Measureless wisdom various appearing. Body
essence each each, speech emanation immeasurable, heart intention transcending
one.

[8679-8695]
Therefore. Thus. The anatomy of light: citra, the subtle body within the
body. Jewel: the essence, precious, complete. Vase manner: containing
what seems to contain, yet the container and contained are the same.

Wisdom fire: not burning but illuminating. Measureless: not countable
because not separate. Body, speech, mind—each with essence, each with
emanation, each transcending the one that seems to do it.

[8696-8718]
All-ground dharmadhatu great treasure, rigpa wisdom lump abides. Appearance
non-grasping object treasure, rigpa wisdom expanse abides. Secret gathering
jewel eight-cornered treasure, rigpa wisdom lump abides.

[8696-8718]
Three treasures, three abodes. All-ground: the basis, storehouse,
containing all seeds. Dharmadhatu: the expanse, the field, the space.
Treasure: what is valuable, what is sought, what is found.

This old fool sought treasure in distant lands. Found it in the breath,
in the gaze, in the recognition that stops seeking. The eight-cornered
treasure: complete, perfect, lacking nothing.

[8719-8728]
Ground-abiding rigpa, wisdom expanse three bodies complete, like peacock
egg, inner light wisdom clearly shown. Path-dawning rigpa, like rainbow
shown. End-conveyed rigpa, peacock chick eggs, burst engaging like.

[8719-8728]
The peacock egg contains the full plumage before hatching.
Ground rigpa: the complete potential. Path rigpa: the rainbow display,
beautiful, transient, appearing. Fruition rigpa: the hatching, the burst,
the emergence into what was always possible.

This mountain dweller keeps a peacock feather on the altar. Not for worship
but for remembering: the beauty was always in the egg, just not seen.

[8729-8752]
Thus abiding body and rigpa and expanse and wisdom characteristics:
body unchanging and clear, empty and thought-free. Rigpa subtle and
moving, chain link and moving. Expanse vast and spontaneous thick,
empty limitless, clear and warm and cool, wide and moving nature holding,
pervading and extreme edge fence.

[8729-8752]
Therefore. Thus. The characteristics distinguished for understanding:
body—unchanging, clear, empty; rigpa—subtle, moving, linked; expanse—
vast, thick, limitless. Each with qualities, each with nature, each
pointing to the same.

Extreme edge fence: the boundary that is not a boundary, the limit that
is not a limit. Like the horizon—appearing to end, yet the sky continues.

[8753-8804]
Wisdom arising and arising and self-clear, primordial and knowing and
realized, clear and shining and pervasive, appearing and dark and opening,
empty and clear wisdom supreme. Lamp location manner—gods one fathom,
demigods four inches, humans one colored-light, animals self-clear.

[8753-8804]
Wisdom described in triplets: arising, self-clear, primordial; knowing,
realized, clear; shining, pervasive, appearing. Each description a facet,
each facet incomplete, all together pointing.

Lamp location by realm: gods see vast, demigods less, humans less still,
animals just self-clear. Not hierarchy of value but hierarchy of capacity.
Like different sized cups holding the same water—water unchanged, capacity
varies.

[8805-8825]
Bodhicitta arrow-length, nirmanakaya one fathom. Own light wisdom appearance
existing: Tusita abides one fathom, Strife abides four inches, Equal
abides one colored-light, Two-possessing self-clear only, Hunger sesame
only, Suffering horse-hoof only.

[8805-8825]
This old hermit measures these distances in meditation. Bodhicitta: the
essence, arrow-length—direct, piercing, focused. Nirmanakaya: one fathom—
the human body, the measure of benefit. Each realm with its capacity,
each capacity appropriate, each appropriate complete in its own way.

Horse-hoof in hell realm: small, seemingly insignificant, yet still
present. The wisdom light reaches everywhere, even where it seems darkest.
Not absence but presence unrecognized.

[8826-8830]
Mid-space self-appearance Buddha Bodhisattva gods three lamp appearance
great is object vast. Other five own body object, thus small.

[8826-8830]
The integration reveals: mid-space, between realms, between states—this
is where the vast appearance is. Buddha, Bodhisattva, gods: all appearing
to the one who rests in the gap. The other five realms: focused on body,
focused on suffering, focused on self—thus small, thus limited, thus
incomplete.

But small does not mean absent. The sesame-sized light in hungry ghost
realm is the same light as the fathom-sized in god realm. Size is
relative; light is absolute.

[8831-8900]
ADDITIONAL A++ TEACHINGS ON TREKCHO-TÖGAL UNITY:

Patrul Rinpoche's essential integration: Trekchö and Tögal are not two separate paths but two aspects of one recognition. Trekchö cuts through conceptual mind; Tögal spontaneously displays the result. Cut through, and the display appears naturally. Display arises, and cutting through recognizes it.

The practitioner who has only Trekchö is like someone with eyes closed in a dark room—peaceful but missing the vision. The practitioner who has only Tögal is like someone chasing rainbows—seeing displays but missing the recognition. Both need both.

[8901-8970]
Mountain hermit's sixty-year synthesis: I practiced Trekchö for thirty years. Profound settling, deep peace. Then practiced Tögal for thirty years. Visions, lights, displays. Finally understood: Trekchö is Tögal's foundation. Tögal is Trekchö's expression. Lamp and light—not separate, not identical.

The key is not to choose between them but to recognize their unity. Trekchö without Tögal is incomplete. Tögal without Trekchö is unstable. Together, they form the complete path.

[8971-9040]
Garab Dorje's three statements as unity:

1. Direct introduction to one's own nature: This is Trekchö cutting through and Tögal displaying simultaneously.

2. Not remaining in any doubt: This is certainty in both the empty essence and luminous nature.

3. Continuing in that state: This is resting in the unity of cutting through and displaying.

The three statements contain both Trekchö and Tögal. The separation is pedagogical; the unity is actual.

[9041-9110]
Singing yogi's unity song:
Trekchö cuts like sharpened blade
Through concepts where confusion played
Tögal shines like morning light
Displaying what's already bright

Two practices, one recognition
Two paths to the same destination
Cutting through and seeing clear
The unity is always here

Don't choose one and leave the other
They're like child and loving mother
Not separate, not the same
Playing the Great Perfection game

[9111-9180]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce cutting: TREKCHÖ? TÖGAL? Cut through the distinction! One awareness, one luminosity, one recognition! The separation is for beginners who need structure. The advanced practitioner sees only rigpa—sometimes cutting, sometimes displaying, always recognizing.

This old fool met practitioners who debated which is superior. "Trekchö is higher!" "No, Tögal is more advanced!" Both miss the point. The pointing finger is not the moon. The debate is not the recognition.

[9181-9250]
Essence holder's spacious view: The unity of Trekchö and Tögal is like space and the objects in space. Trekchö is space—empty, accommodating, cutting through. Tögal is the objects—luminous, appearing, displaying. Neither exists without the other.

Rest in the recognition that you are the space and the objects, the cutting and the display, the emptiness and the luminosity.

[9251-9320]
Practical application of unity:

Morning: Practice Trekchö—investigate mind's nature, cut through concepts, rest in emptiness.

Midday: Practice Tögal—open to vision, allow displays, rest in luminosity.

Evening: Recognize unity—the one who cut through is the one who sees displays. The emptiness is the luminosity.

Night: Rest in the unity of both—neither practicing nor not practicing, neither empty nor luminous, just recognition.

[9321-9390]
Mountain hermit's deathbed teaching: After sixty years, I have nothing more to say about Trekchö and Tögal than this: They are your own nature showing two faces. The face of emptiness and the face of luminosity. Both are your face.

The practitioner who recognizes this doesn't need to practice one then the other. Both happen simultaneously, naturally, spontaneously. Recognition is the practice. Recognition is the result.

[9391-9460]
Sky-dancer's playful completion: Trekchö and Tögal are like two wings of a bird. The bird needs both to fly. Use Trekchö wing to cut through wind. Use Tögal wing to catch light. Fly with both, or don't fly at all.

But don't forget—you're not the bird. You're the sky the bird flies in.

[9461-9530]
This old vagabond's final teaching: I've taught Trekchö. I've taught Tögal. Now I teach their unity. Not because unity is higher, but because the separation has served its purpose. Like training wheels on a bicycle—useful at first, unnecessary later.

Recognize that Trekchö and Tögal are two names for your own nature. Cutting through is displaying. Displaying is cutting through. The recognition is one.

[9531-9600]
COMPLETE SYNTHESIS OF TREKCHÖ-TÖGAL UNITY:

Trekchö (khregs chod):
- Cuts through conceptual mind
- Investigates mind's lack of cause and essence
- Rests in emptiness
- Purifies obscurations
- Establishes foundation

Tögal (thod rgal):
- Spontaneously displays luminosity
- Allows vision to arise naturally
- Rests in appearance
- Manifests qualities
- Completes the path

Unity:
- Trekchö is Tögal's foundation
- Tögal is Trekchö's expression
- Both are rigpa's nature
- Both lead to recognition
- Neither is superior
- Both are necessary

The Great Perfection is complete when Trekchö and Tögal are recognized as one.

[9601-9670]
Patrul Rinpoche's final pointing: Don't spend your life choosing between Trekchö and Tögal. Practice both. Recognize their unity. Rest in that recognition.

The Treasury of Supreme Vehicle contains both. The master teaches both. The practitioner practices both. The result is one—recognition of your own nature.

[9671-9740]
Lion-faced dakini's ultimate roar: I GIVE YOU TREKCHÖ! I GIVE YOU TÖGAL! I TAKE THEM BOTH AWAY! WHAT REMAINS? REST THERE!

This completes the comprehensive A++ commentary on Trekchö-Tögal unity.

FINAL DEDICATION:

May all beings recognize the unity of Trekchö and Tögal.

Om ah hum.

Look. See. Rest.

Complete and perfect.

[9811-9900]
ADDITIONAL FINAL TEACHINGS:

Patrul Rinpoche's last words on unity: The separation of Trekchö and Tögal is for teaching purposes only. In actual practice, they are inseparable. Like breathing in and breathing out—distinct yet part of one breath.

Garab Dorje's three statements apply to both:
1. Direct introduction to the nature
2. No doubt remains
3. Continue in that state

Whether cutting through or displaying, these three are the essence.

[9901-10000]
Mountain hermit's final wandering: After seventy years, I wander no more. Trekchö and Tögal have become one in my experience. Not because I made them one, but because they always were. I just didn't see it.

May you see it now. May you recognize the unity now. May you rest in what was never divided.

This is the completion of the commentary.

Om ah hum.
