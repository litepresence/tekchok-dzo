[8083-8091]
The Treasury opens where no name can reach—samsara itself a mere echo.
Life that light-liberates carries a special excellence, for it transcends
all conditions that bind ordinary existence.

[8092-8101]
This old hermit once asked: what distinguishes thod rgal from khregs chod?
Both liberate, yet the difference is vast as sky from earth. Khregs chod
liberates from partless particles, but cannot reach the light. Without
entering that light, the vajra body remains unestablished—the occasional
illusion body cannot be severed by ultimate truth.

[8102-8109]
The wisdom spoken of primordially as luminous—in khregs chod it is
measured as emptiness, its own light unseen. But thod rgal, pressing the
crucial point, captures the luminosity of dharmata's nature within, while
the self-dawn luminosity of objects appears outwardly—thus it surpasses.

[8110-8116]
The wisdom of rigpa in khregs chod remains covered, not seen, decisively
cut as one. Thod rgal opens wisdom's expanse—the sun rays of dharmata
clear and unobscured.

[8117-8124]
Khregs chod relies upon coarse channels and winds. Thod rgal holds the
essence of light channels, placing the lamp upon the actual path.
Emaho! Such is the specialty of direct crossing.

[8125-8132]
See what is. The lamp appearances of the four lights dawn through the
wisdom wind's urging—this is the gate of pure luminosity.

[8133-8142]
Khregs chod seeks clarity within the unpurified gates of the six faculties,
searching in mind's dharmas. Thod rgal's gate of pure luminosity opens
to the expanse and wisdom meeting-free—directly analyzing appearances
without acceptance or rejection.

[8143-8163]
The seventh specialty: khregs chod makes outer objects appear as mind's
delusion, increasing without acceptance or rejection, yet not quickly
liberating. Thod rgal, from the moment of holding the key, dissolves
outer and inner deluded appearances with their grasping, without abandoning
them in their place—pure increase without dependence.

[8164-8173]
The meaning shows thod rgal's special nature through three wheels: the
dharmata wheel with three keys; the day-night luminous wheel; the vast
expanse wisdom wheel.

[8174-8194]
The body's three postures—whatever suits, with inner relaxation for
channel-winds to abide pleasantly. If deliberately restrained, winds
reverse and pervade, channels contract too tightly. The crucial point:
when the wind key is very loose, hold outwardly and expel from the mouth.

[8195-8199]
Wind gathering obstacles, unhappy mind, affliction thoughts moving,
heart stabbing—all cleared! At those times, forcefully expelling is
the supreme key.

[8200-8207]
The seeing gate's three keys—any gaze posture, not restrained by effort,
inner relaxed, natural flow. Eyes unmoving, gaze pressing is the key.

[8208-8223]
The expanse's three keys for guiding—eyes slowly to corners and up-down,
expanse appearance in the gap, eyes unmoving, knowing unmoved, placed
in clear-emptiness.

[8224-8250]
Outer object: sky cloud-dissolved, rigpa clear-awake, appearance increase
fast. Inner object: expanse lamp placed, light mother-child connected.
Secret object: rigpa self-clear placed, primordial purity dharma-exhausted
intention self-place clear key.

[8251-8266]
At this time, channels-inside wind moves, subtle thoughts arise sha-ra-ra,
but no harm to direct meaning. Thoughts themselves cannot stand by
themselves, liberated going along—like falcon catching prey flying.

[8267-8302]
Scattered objects disperse, yet unlike before, no chain link continuing,
no distraction. Karma and latencies not accumulated. Light meditation
not destroyed. Dynamic display entered, wisdom spontaneously born,
opening opportunity.

[8303-8318]
Seeing time, sky center lightning edge unmoving looking is key. From
the Letterless: eyes very held, examined meeting-free, from eye corner
expanse arises, light subtle swirling arises.

[8319-8342]
Here establishing three light bindings: intention essence binding, mind
stain purification manner; nature unmoved even placement manner; from
that signs measure time certain dawning manner. Rigpa's nature, four
wisdoms self-dynamic dawning, showing realization superior seeing dharmata.

[8343-8374]
Listen now. From the Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror tantra—these are not
mere metaphors but precise instructions. Your rigid thoughts, fixed
ideas about reality—they are iron chains binding like a corpse.

[8375-8405]
Ignorance is like water—afflictions gather there. Anger is fire like
an eon-ending conflagration. Desire is like drinking salt water, never
satisfied. Delusion is thick darkness in an empty house. Pride is a
crushing mountain. Jealousy is a narrow ravine gorge. These five obscure
wisdom.

[8406-8437]
Mind is like a bitch thief, consciousness like a forest monkey, mind
like impure mud, all-ground like a being-pig, knowing like a feather
carried by wind. Grasping and grasped like man and woman entangled.
Karma's varieties like birds caught in a net.

[8438-8456]
The result of affliction? No method to endure! This samsaric suffering,
this spear of grasping-grasped—by doing you won't get out. But by placing
awareness, you go out. The secret mantra king transforms afflictions
into wisdom—like raising a lamp in an empty house.

[8457-8478]
Turn all scriptures to root great scripture. Turn all instructions to
free-from-expression. Turn all practices to free-from-activity. Turn
all conducts to supreme uncontrived. Turn all meditations to great clear
non-grasping. Turn all views to wide-open unattached.

[8479-8490]
Turn all results to great wisdom decisive. All these to one non-abiding
expanse. Abandon all samsara activities. Always familiarize with wisdom
appearance. Know wisdom dawning time.

[8491-8524]

[8679-8695]

wisdom manner abides.

[8696-8718]

[8729-8752]
Ground-abiding rigpa, wisdom expanse three bodies complete, like peacock
egg, inner light wisdom clearly shown. Path-dawning rigpa, like rainbow
shown. End-conveyed rigpa, peacock chick eggs, burst engaging like.

[8753-8773]
Thus abiding body and rigpa and expanse and wisdom characteristics:
body unchanging and clear, empty and thought-free. Rigpa subtle and
moving, chain link and moving. Expanse vast and spontaneous thick,
empty limitless, clear and warm and cool, wide and moving nature holding,
pervading and extreme edge fence.

[8774-8804]
