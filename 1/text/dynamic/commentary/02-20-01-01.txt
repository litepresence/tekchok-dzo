This old hermit once asked: what distinguishes thod rgal from khregs chod?
Both liberate, yet the difference is vast as sky from earth. Khregs chod
liberates from partless particles, but cannot reach the light. Without
entering that light, the vajra body remains unestablished—the occasional
illusion body cannot be severed by ultimate truth.

Direct. Immediate. Certain.
the light that dawns once severing is complete. You cannot see sunlight
while clutching clouds.
