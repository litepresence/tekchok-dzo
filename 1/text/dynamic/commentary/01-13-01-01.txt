Space pure lamp light form arise-produce gather.

The gathering and non-gathering are the same. Your own face is the gathering.

[16214-16235]
Listen well, practitioner! Look at your own mind—desire, dullness, hatred, attachment, clinging, ignorance—these arise from causes and conditions, essence and particulars. The moving mind, grasping and holding, chases past, future, and present like a dog chasing its tail. This movement creates samsara's karma, maturation, and results! Mindfulness and latent tendencies—various causes and conditions, many actions—thus we label mind. Some say mind is one, enough with that label; others say divisions are improper. Call it mental events, gather as one—enough! Fifty-one divisions, not improper, all equal. Division and gathering depend on parts, no contradiction.

[16236-16255]
Now hear the wondrous! The lamp of pure space, completely pure—this is your own nature! Light and form arise from gathering, five colors pervading, dark-blue, unchanging, surrounded by vajra fence, grasped by vajra chain with no place to escape. Inside, light-forms emanate rays—this very bardo of dharmata, cut through it and perfect buddhahood manifests! Light appears upward-standing, side-arising, rim-appearing—delusion self-ceases, wisdom clears! From these, light layers, fragments, partial breaks appear, outer and inner space mix, wisdom with no interval. Eye-webs, eye-many, eye-lines, nets, half-nets, flowers, thousand-petaled lotus, house-fire, tent-house under thatch—these appear as reality's display, made into the path! Four lamps determine the four path-appearances' measure. With the snare of distance, see dharmata directly, reverse from holding philosophical positions. Look! This is the direct path, the immediate recognition!

[16256-16258]
Look here, practitioner! The empty bindu experiences increasing visions—seeing bliss self-held in awareness, mind turns back from that appearance! Completely pure expanse—seeing awareness reach full measure, mind turns back from impure confused appearance! Self-arisen prajna—seeing exhaustion appearance, mind turns back from grasping body and wisdom!

[16259-16263]
Now the four lamps explained individually: Far-reaching water lamp, empty bindu lamp, completely pure expanse lamp, self-arisen prajna lamp. These four are not separate practices—they're four aspects of what you already see!

[16264-16273]
First, nine aspects: essence, definitive term, division, characteristic, its location, how produced, appearing door-appearance, simile, measure determination. First, water lamp's essence: holding the aspect of both samsara-nirvana, the clear support of seeing pure appearance and confused appearance, and the light-channel depending on it.

[01-13-01-01] EXTENDED COMMENTARY - Multi-Voice Presentation
============================================================

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle presents these teachings with utmost clarity. The Great Perfection transcends all philosophical extremes while embracing all phenomena as its display.

This old vagabond has practiced these teachings for decades. What I've learned: the path is not about accumulating knowledge but recognizing what has always been present.

Three words pointing to the essence: recognize your own nature, liberate the grasping mind, rest in natural perfection.

From Lotus-Born: these secret instructions are the heart-essence of all Buddhas. Practice them with devotion and recognition is certain.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! See what was never obscured! Liberation is immediate!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation integrates ground, path, and result into a coherent framework for recognition.

The integration of all aspects reveals their non-dual nature. What appears separate is one awareness displaying.

The essence beyond all words: awareness knowing itself. Not achieved, not transformed, always complete.

The intimate embrace of awareness with itself. Recognition is this intimacy realized.

Precise phenomenological mapping correlates experience with recognition.

Philosophically, these teachings resolve all apparent contradictions.

I sing these teachings as songs of liberation. Each note a recognition.

Scholarly precision within wild freedom. Both serve recognition.

From the sky of dharmata, I dance through all teachings.

Every teaching a book, every book pointing to awareness.

Ancient wisdom meets modern insight. Same recognition.

Translating the untranslatable. Pointing to what words cannot reach.

I reveal what was never hidden. Recognition is now.

Fierce compassion cuts through all obstacles!

Vajra indestructibility of recognition itself.

[01-13-01-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
