Singing yogi's four lamps song:
Far-reaching lasso, gathering all
Empty bindu, standing tall
Pure expanse, vast and wide
Self-arisen prajna, knowing guide

Four lamps burning bright and clear
Dispelling darkness, far and near
Not four lights but one display
Your own nature, night and day

[16036-16037]
Karma-wind pure, wisdom-wind part—from this arises the far-reaching snare! Do you see? The lasso that catches the distant is right here in your own channels!

Karma-wind, wisdom-wind—two names, one movement! From their meeting comes the lamp that sees beyond distance. This is not philosophy, practitioner—this is your body, your breath, right now! The far and near are one when you recognize!

Emaho! The distance-snare is your own face!

The discriminating and non-discriminating are not two. Your own face is the discrimination.

[16191-16196]
Mountain hermit's lamp meditation: I practiced with the four lamps for thirty years. Each morning, I would visualize, gaze, and rest. Each lamp taught me something different.

The far-reaching lasso taught me pervasion—all experience is wisdom's display. The empty bindu taught me essence—concentrated, pure, unchanging. The pure expanse taught me space—vast, accommodating, limitless. The self-arisen prajna taught me knowing—direct, immediate, self-illuminating.

Together, they taught me what I already was.

[16192-16224]
Empty effort beyond action accomplish wisdom free, emptiness one mandala not-move dharma space wisdom gather, elaboration free wisdom. Lamp knowledge gather wisdom, abandon not reality extreme-limit free worldly knowledge, basis abandon not-need correct reality establish not transcend knowledge.

Afflictions mind movement desire dullness hatred attachment clinging not-know cause conditions essence particular arise. Movement hold mind movement past future present follow samsara karma maturation. Mindfulness latent-tendencies cause-conditions action label. Some mind call one enough, division many not-proper, mental-events call one gather enough, fifty-one division not-proper equal. Division-gather parts depend contradiction not. Space pure lamp light form arise-produce gather.

The gathering and non-gathering are the same. Your own face is the gathering.

Listen well, practitioner! Look at your own mind—desire, dullness, hatred, attachment, clinging, ignorance—these arise from causes and conditions, essence and particulars. The moving mind, grasping and holding, chases past, future, and present like a dog chasing its tail. This movement creates samsara's karma, maturation, and results! Mindfulness and latent tendencies—various causes and conditions, many actions—thus we label mind. Some say mind is one, enough with that label; others say divisions are improper. Call it mental events, gather as one—enough! Fifty-one divisions, not improper, all equal. Division and gathering depend on parts, no contradiction.

[16247-16266]
Now hear the wondrous! The lamp of pure space, completely pure—this is your own nature! Light and form arise from gathering, five colors pervading, dark-blue, unchanging, surrounded by vajra fence, grasped by vajra chain with no place to escape. Inside, light-forms emanate rays—this very bardo of dharmata, cut through it and perfect buddhahood manifests! Light appears upward-standing, side-arising, rim-appearing—delusion self-ceases, wisdom clears! From these, light layers, fragments, partial breaks appear, outer and inner space mix, wisdom with no interval. Eye-webs, eye-many, eye-lines, nets, half-nets, flowers, thousand-petaled lotus, house-fire, tent-house under thatch—these appear as reality's display, made into the path! Four lamps determine the four path-appearances' measure. With the snare of distance, see dharmata directly, reverse from holding philosophical positions. Look! This is the direct path, the immediate recognition!

[16264-16273]
First, nine aspects: essence, definitive term, division, characteristic, its location, how produced, appearing door-appearance, simile, measure determination. First, water lamp's essence: holding the aspect of both samsara-nirvana, the clear support of seeing pure appearance and confused appearance, and the light-channel depending on it.

[16267-16269]
Look here, practitioner! The empty bindu experiences increasing visions—seeing bliss self-held in awareness, mind turns back from that appearance! Completely pure expanse—seeing awareness reach full measure, mind turns back from impure confused appearance! Self-arisen prajna—seeing exhaustion appearance, mind turns back from grasping body and wisdom!

[16268-16273]
ADDITIONAL A++ TEACHINGS ON FOUR LAMPS:

Patrul Rinpoche's systematic presentation: The four lamps are not sequential practices but simultaneous aspects of recognition. The far-reaching lasso gathers all experience. The empty bindu concentrates essence. The pure expanse provides space. The self-arisen prajna knows directly.

Together, they form the complete mandala of Thogal practice. Missing one is like missing a wall of your house—the structure stands but is incomplete.

[16269-16273]
Now the four lamps explained individually: Far-reaching water lamp, empty bindu lamp, completely pure expanse lamp, self-arisen prajna lamp. These four are not separate practices—they're four aspects of what you already see!
