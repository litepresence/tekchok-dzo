[17361-17374]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis establishes the fundamental distinction between the basis of mind and the basis of wisdom. The Kunzang Klongdrukpa Tantra speaks: O great bodhisattva, the abode of mind is the all-ground (kun gzhi), because the all-ground gathers all objects of thought and is known as mind.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. The abode of primordial wisdom is the Dharmakaya, because the Dharmakaya does not possess memory-thought and has no consciousness that grasps objects as different. This is the crucial distinction that separates samsara from nirvana.

[17361-17374]
This old practitioner has seen scholars confuse the ocean with the boat that floats upon it. The all-ground is like the ocean—vast, containing all waves, the support of all container and contained. Dharmakaya is like the clear sky—empty, luminous, without support or supported. Those who equate them are like those who mistake the reflection for the mirror itself.

[17375-17386]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Some with manifest arrogance hold the all-ground as Dharmakaya! They cite common treatises saying the all-ground is the support of all pure and impure, and Dharmakaya is the stainless thusness within purity. Some even say when the all-ground transforms, it becomes the wisdom of the dharma-dimension and essence-body. But this contradicts the scriptures!

[17387-17396]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis reveals the fault: if the all-ground were Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya would possess stains. If the all-ground produces delusion of container and contained, Dharmakaya would produce delusion. If one accepts this, it follows that Buddhas would revert to sentient beings. The Kunzang Mind Mirror Tantra states: Those who hold all-ground as Dharmakaya deviate from me!

[17397-17408]
From Rangshar: Some hold all-ground as Dharmakaya. To teach them the reply, the characteristics of all-ground are thus: the all-ground is so-called because all are complete from it. Through the power of various appearances, Buddhas become sentient beings.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Why? Because all are complete from it, one becomes Buddha, one becomes sentient being. Through definite establishment, one becomes Buddha, one becomes sentient being.

[17409-17420]
Three words. See what is. Rest. The all-ground is not Dharmakaya. The all-ground is mind mixed with ignorance; Dharmakaya is wisdom free from ignorance. Like a dreamer and the one who wakes—the dreamer must wake from the dream, but the waker was never dreaming.

[17421-17426]
From Klongdrukpa: Therefore, if all-ground and Dharmakaya are not distinguished, they become similar to consciousness that grasps one form as different. Meaning cannot appear individually. The example of these two is like the ocean and boat. Dharmakaya, primordially pure rigpa without defilement, is like a clear ocean. The all-ground, like a boat on the ocean, has never entered the primordial expanse.

[17427-17442]
This old hermit rows his boat across the lake of mind. The water is Dharmakaya—always pure, always clear, never disturbed by the boat. The boat is all-ground—carrying karma, habits, delusions, filled with many persons. The distinction is very great: one must wake from sleep and dream, but self-awareness needs no reversal.

[17440-17448]
The vast middle way: Thus. We proceed. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[17448-17464]
Voice 20 proclaims: The all-ground and all dharmas supported by it are to be known as stains to be purified! From Thalgyur: The essential point of all-ground and Dharmakaya—there, first explain all-ground. Basis of all dharma and non-dharma. Nature, word-meaning, division with. Nature is container of all habitual tendencies. Division: body and connection. Various and original-basis. Definitive-meaning: gathered at all.

[17464-17478]
The nature of all-ground has five aspects: nature, definitive-meaning, division, function, cause of entering sound. First, nature: compounded virtuous forms and samsara dharmas, all complete habitual tendencies, become the container. Definitive-meaning: all-many-at. Basis gathered many of time, ground or support-basis as abiding. Division: four types—original-meaning all-ground, connection-meaning all-ground, body-habit all-ground, various-habit all-ground.

[17478-17496]
Between samsara and nirvana, the vast middle way opens. The all-ground serves as the basis for connection to both. The original-meaning is the first ground of samsara's dharmas. The connection-meaning is spoken from the aspect of reversing ignorance co-existing with first movement awareness.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching. The body-habit all-ground speaks from the aspect where flesh, blood, light, and mind-body appear. The various-habit all-ground speaks from being the source of impure karma and habits.

[17496-17514]
This old practitioner spent years trying to purify the all-ground, like polishing a brick to make a mirror. Foolish! The all-ground cannot become Dharmakaya—they are distinct from the first. The all-ground is the sleep; Dharmakaya is the waking. One must abandon the sleep, not transform it into waking.

[17500-17520]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who meditate on the all-ground hoping it will become Dharmakaya! They meditate on confusion hoping it will become wisdom. Impossible! See your own nature The waking is not a transformation of sleep; it is the end of sleep.

[17505-17523]
Rest in: Accordingly. The analysis.
 The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.
The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

[01-14-01-01] EXTENDED COMMENTARY - Multi-Voice Presentation
============================================================

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle presents these teachings with utmost clarity. The Great Perfection transcends all philosophical extremes while embracing all phenomena as its display.

This old vagabond has practiced these teachings for decades. What I've learned: the path is not about accumulating knowledge but recognizing what has always been present.

Three words pointing to the essence: recognize your own nature, liberate the grasping mind, rest in natural perfection.

From Lotus-Born: these secret instructions are the heart-essence of all Buddhas. Practice them with devotion and recognition is certain.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! See what was never obscured! Liberation is immediate!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation integrates ground, path, and result into a coherent framework for recognition.

The integration of all aspects reveals their non-dual nature. What appears separate is one awareness displaying.

The essence beyond all words: awareness knowing itself. Not achieved, not transformed, always complete.

Emaho! What joy to encounter these teachings! What bliss to practice! What liberation to recognize!

The intimate embrace of awareness with itself. Recognition is this intimacy realized.

[01-14-01-01] FINAL WORDS:
The teaching is complete. The recognition is available. Liberation is certain. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Rest in natural awareness. Complete. Perfect. The absolute end.
