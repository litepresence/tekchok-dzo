[14823-14840]
Offering and praising  Recognition is immediate.

[14825-14876]
Listen here, you who get stuck in the details of liberation! Longchenpa teaches something crucial about "self-appearance recognizing" - but you might miss the forest for the trees!

First, the seven accomplishments: "Twenty-first, primordially pure liberation" - do you hear the beauty of this? It's not number 21 in a sequence! It's "primordially pure" - liberation that was never stained to begin with! Not achieved through practice, but recognized as always already pure!

"Not dissolved's gap there, emanation opened, primordially pure dissolved" - Three ways recognition can happen: through dissolution of barriers, through opening of display, through recognizing primordial purity. These aren't stages - they're how awareness naturally manifests!

"Though twenty-one instants equal, samadhi's days many few existing, faculties sharp-dull posited." When recognition happens, time collapses! Twenty-one instants equal - because in rigpa, past and future don't exist separately. "Samadhi's days many few existing" - this describes natural abiding, not technical meditation achievement!

[14841-14860]
, knowing; finally a-a spoken, wisdom ones invited, samaya ones water-dissolved contemplated; vase that corpse's crown placed, a-lo age-number spoken; vase's water wisdom five's water-stream contemplated, with a washed, negativity purified contemplated—much a spoken, from hell's place proceeds. Recognition is immediate.

The Treasury's path vast oceanic ground. What seemed journey was always waves on water never leaving water.

Emaho!

[14861-14880]
, bhy-lo age-number washing, from preta proceeds. Then vase secret-place held, rgya and wind's joining, from animals proceeds. Then vase right armpit held, kyem spoken washing, from asuras proceeds.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. Then vase crown held, tam spoken washing, from gods' place proceeds.

Then om ah hum svaha

[14867-14890]
Listen! Spontaneously accomplished three days abiding's end, own appearance seeing, stability obtained. Emanation also fifty days capable of benefit. End's middle: Nineteen days needed. Again gathered, twelve days needed. Four pristine awarenesses abide. Sentient beings' faculties all Buddha ground obtained. Those bardos also dream-like.

End's end, that nature emanation birth, here liberation's category explained. Those faculties' liberation manner—crucial point great, should be known.

Fourth general meaning: Existence intermediate, karma's continuation yawning gap fox inserting-like pith instruction in two: Pith instruction's indication manner briefly shown. Intermediate's own face extensively explained.

First: Existence intermediate dream-like appearance, instant unobstructed object entering, instant former self-ceasing, dissolving, not identified. Now direct appearance clear, yet wavering confused dissolving, wherever thought object, instant traveling miracle existing time. This door seeing ones, intermediate's self-appearance recognizing coming, ten directions emanation field mind-made merely, suchness truth's blessings there born, bardo without Buddha.

This's preliminary pith instruction: Now awareness eye or Brahma's aperture from light's ball focusing, shooting star running-like projecting. That time's pith instruction: Field remembering, east etc., awareness naturally projecting.

This door not seen's migrating beings usual, Dharma trained ones, illusory body grasping. Non-existence training. Pure field mind-making, liberation possible, individual's practice texts arising like. Not Dharma habituated ones, pure field aspiration praying.

Emaho! Even in the bardo there's hope! If you recognize self-appearance, you can still be liberated or reach a pure realm. The "yawning gap" is the bardo—don't fall into it unconsciously! Train now to recognize awareness, and the transition becomes liberation, not just another rebirth!

[14877-14892]
Now the five colors liberation - oh, how students love to make this complicated! "Some white color liberated.some five colors liberated." Longchenpa is listing the natural display of awareness as it purifies itself. But then comes the master's warning: "That is end's Liberation manner!"

Don't you see the pattern? First liberation through self-appearance, then liberation through colors. But the colors correspond to the five Buddha families - this isn't about becoming all five Buddhas! It's about how your own awareness displays itself in different aspects!

"End faculties' liberation manner thus: End ground held, fourteen days needed, that too gathered upper-lower six, pristine awareness five, spontaneously accomplished three days abiding's end, own appearance seeing, Buddha." Listen carefully! This is describing different approaches based on capacities. Some need fourteen days (less capacity), some need just three days (higher capacity). But the result is always "own appearance seeing, Buddha" - recognizing your own face!

"Emanation also forty days capable of benefit" - When you recognize your own nature, the natural capacity to benefit others emerges spontaneously. Not something you develop, but what radiates naturally when recognition stabilizes!

Emaho! The colors of self-liberation aren't achievements - they're the natural display of your own awareness purifying itself!

[14881-14900]
spoken, vase heart held washing, human birth-place purified, precious human body drawn, that life liberation-fortune proceeds. Rest in this understanding.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Using opponent's logic: if distinctions are real, their maker must be real. But neither withstands analysis. Both empty. Both liberated.

Thus three or five or seven days

[14891-14938]
Listen! Refuge going. Womb door bad, turning back. Good choosing.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

From Golden Rosary: "Confusion existence's mere aspect. Self-appearance natureless appearing. Self-appearance natureless knowing. Emanation remembering self-liberated." Thus.

Second, extensive explanation has twenty: Circling manner. Definition. Characteristics. Clairvoyance. Miracles. Life measure. Color. Head's looking way. Karma accumulating not accumulating's difference. Karma's signs. Name's enumerations. Body's measure. Birth place identifying. Activity's difference. Light's measure. Karma connection's difference. Next body and afflictions' connection manner. Three realms which included's difference. Next womb entering signs. Example near indication.

First, circling manner's difference: This door not seen or seen yet not confident and not taken into experience ones, for suchness bardo short. Self-appearance not recognizing, existence bardo again and again distracted. Flesh-blood self-grasping form non-existent, yet formerly body self-grasping habituated latency, dream body-like, all faculties complete, flesh form flawless existing-existing-like appearance arising. Former arisen existence's flesh form possessor. All faculties complete, unobstructed possessing. Same class divine eye pure seeing. Irreversible, that is smell-eater. Thus aspect labeled, explained. Flesh form and faculties self-characteristic existing, body taken, actually become, bardo and contradictory.

Therefore, arising basis mark-possessing body free, mind's existence name and four elements seed-aspect depending, body entering near, illusory body name two-possessing. Ground not held, karma all moving, circling.

Second, definition: Suchness appearance setting and six families' body actually not taken between appearance, thus intermediate called. That two joined's middle itself identified.

Emaho! Twenty aspects of the bardo! Longchenpa is being thorough so you have no doubt. The key points: you have clairvoyance but limited control, you're drawn by karma and attachment, and you don't recognize your own nature. But remember—all of this is appearance, empty, natureless. Recognize that, and you're free!

[14901-14920]
done, aggregates burnt or transported, higher gods or liberation signs sky not arising impossible. The nature is complete.

Logical necessity: if the path leads to ground, and ground is primordial, then path was always ground. Non-dual.

Sun-Moon Union

[14921-14940]
: "That itself dead time, that aggregates with outflows, vase crown placed, a syllable's essence and, wisdom water-stream purified, hell's places emptied, from that proceeds likewise. Preta signs possessed, bhye syllable's connection, breath with number seven; tongue's upper bhye placed, awareness essence that gathers; likewise vase mouth's upper, wisdom water-stream washed, preta places emptied, from that proceeds likewise."

Animal signs possessed

[14939-14970]
Listen! Some god-human birth existence. Some lower migrations birth existence. Some liberation existence called. Intermediate existence called. Third, characteristics: Intermediate gap however abiding, upper half former's aspect. Lower half, later wherever born, that body and clothes and ornaments etc. existing thought, like dream's characteristics.

That too, god-human birth taken, that aspect. Form realm birth, first light body existing thought. Formless upward birth time, formless, aspect not arising, yet sky and mere wind appearance from birth. Formless from lower realm transferring time, half former's samadhi and mere wind self-emanated samadhi's aspect other non-existent. Half later, wherever born's aspect arising.

Demi-god and lower migrations three, that aspect arising. Unrelenting birth, passing through, no bardo. Likewise upward passing through and phowa projected, birth place wherever passing through, bardo not seen. Others intermediate path make.

Fourth, clairvoyance: Former suchness intermediate's clairvoyance aspect latency here existing, by its power former abiding world that vessel-essence's extent and height and measure and creation-destruction etc. and later birth place that vessel-essence's characteristics all instant mirror image arisen like seeing, known. Thus later abode whatever born there desiring and aspiring, born. God-human realm seeing, attachment, there birth. Demi-god and animal's forests and lake islands beautiful seeing, there birth. Hell hungry ghost's abode also light rays clear fire's appearance beautiful, attachment-like seeing, gone thought from birth. Briefly, whatever birth's abode that beautiful and joyful seeing.

Emaho! Your own desires create your destination! See beautiful realms, want to go there, and you're pulled there by attachment. Even hell can look beautiful through delusion. This is crucial—what you perceive depends on your karma and latencies. Train your mind now to recognize purity everywhere!

[14941-14960]
, rgya syllable's connection, this one's place purifying; breath with nine times, sign rgya marked, awareness ones emptiness, repeatedly wind with thrown. Likewise vase sign's upper, wisdom water-stream washed, animal places emptied, from that proceeds likewise.

Emaho!

[14961-14980]
, tam syllable's connection, breath with number also; eleven with awareness trained; crown tam syllable contemplated; awareness outflowless eyes drawn; likewise vase crown's upper, wisdom water-stream purified, god's places emptied, that obtains human birth-place. Recognition is immediate.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Thus. The analysis dissolves the analyzer. Categories collapse into recognition.

Asura signs possessed

[14971-14996]
Listen! Enemy chasing, refuge seen, there hidden mind moment attached, birth taken. That too, desire realm birth all, mind attachment's obvious power arisen, object great longing arising. Form realm birth, coarse appearance anger, light longing arising. Formless birth, no appearance whatsoever longing, mere nothing-existing mind abiding, joy arising. Vessel-essence appearance also mere instant, then latency set great power ceases.

Here clairvoyance arising's cause: Suchness seed existing, here obscuring body self-grasping non-existent, suchness above seeing's blessings arising.

Fifth, miracles: Faculties clear, body perfect appearing, like dream flying etc., sky going, consciousness wherever focused, there enters. Small, needle-eye and horse-drum's crack inside also enters. Great, horse-elephant and mountain-rock and sky also enters, form great-small uncertain sentient being becoming. Earth water fire wind mountain-rock etc. all passing through. Four elements' harm not struck. Whatever element entering capacity existing, rock's inside etc. and egg's inside sentient beings coming—crucial point. This time, vajra seat and mother's womb except, whatever unobstructed. Same class and divine eye possessors except, that not seen, by that sentient beings' abode classes all seen.

This miracle's continuum: From above Sambhogakaya's miracle seeing aspect arising. That too, instant arisen, again ceases, sets, other appearance arising. Other arising time, former forgotten, not seen, like dream former-later dream that not remembering. Sixth, life's measure.

Emaho! In the bardo you have powers—pass through matter, see other realms, travel instantly. But these are not "yours"—they're the natural capacities of the mind unbound by physical body. Don't get fascinated by them! Use them to recognize the nature (rang bzhin) of mind or reach a pure realm.

[14981-15000]
, kem syllable's connection, breath with twenty number; right armpit itself right also, kem syllable expert placed; awareness that gathers, breath with thrown; likewise vase armpit's upper, wisdom water-stream washed, asura places emptied, that proceeds likewise. This is the treasury's heart.

ROAR! Ground itself! Path never walked! Cut through seeking! NOW!

Who human signs

[14997-15032]
Listen here, you who fear the bardo! Longchenpa explains something profound about the intermediate state - but you might miss the essential point while counting days!

"These twenty appearance-birth modes complete in seven days." The master isn't giving you a timetable of rebirth! He's describing how consciousness naturally manifests in different ways. But students immediately start counting: "If no life from that? Again latency's power!"

Look at this profound teaching: "Intermediate existence that life, seven days passed, exhausted. If no life from that? Again latency's power, former appearance awakened, mind body taken, seven times die." Do you understand? The bardo isn't some waiting room - it's the natural capacity of your mind to create new experiences! "Seven times die" means consciousness can project itself seven times before exhausting its momentum.

[15001-15020]
, a syllable's connection, breath with gathered number; mouth's upper a syllable; awareness crown drawn, twenty-one; likewise vase mouth's upper, wisdom water-stream purified, human birth higher proceeds. Recognition is immediate.

Contemporary mind makes distinctions. Contemporary recognition sees through. Direct. Immediate.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Third: subsequent purification

[15021-15040]
—explained before as consciousness transference, here similar. These rituals, though extensively taught in other tantras, here the great perfection's crucial points condensed—recognize thus.

All these bardo instructions

[15033-15065]
"Seven times birth appears, like dream's birth-death." This is crucial! Like dreams appearing and disappearing each night - not because you're really dying and reborn, but because consciousness naturally displays itself! "Seven births also miraculously born" - consciousness can manifest without karmic momentum when conditions align!

"Death and birth all done in instant" - This is the key! In bardo, birth and death aren't sequential like in life. They happen simultaneously - instant manifestations of consciousness projecting and withdrawing.

"If virtue's power applied, seven sevens' seven periods greatly beneficial." When you apply practice during bardo, you're not accumulating merit for future rebirth - you're purifying the very momentum of consciousness itself!

[15033-15076]
Listen, you who seek liberation! Intermediate karma called [15033].

Three words. Never. Closed. See.

That also, suchness truth seeing, former manifest karma not seen, seed aspect existing [15034]. Here dream's time like, intermediate karma subtle later's addition merely accumulating, later karma's connection also this cause's result one to one continuation making, samsara making

[15035-15036]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Accumulating manner: Distinction appearance one setting one not arising's gap accumulating, by its power former appearance unclear

[15037-15038]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

No journey necessary. The ground is immediate. Contemporary recognition of timeless presence.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Time: Mind former-later's gap [15039]. Cause: Former manifest non-existent yet subtle latency and samadhi portion [15040].

Here accumulating: From above suchness bewildered and surprised arising [15041].

Tenth, karma's signs: Former pure karma seed aspect's appearance that time, suchness very clear, analyzed. Former seed impure, mind unclear, murky

[15041-15060]
are the vital heart-essence of the path. Mother bird-like, teaching her chicks to fly—these instructions guide the dying through the in-between. Do not take them lightly, fortunate one!

Practice these while alive

[15042-15044]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Mind clear unclear, former virtue non-virtue's projection arising [15045].

Cause two: Clear's cause from former subsequent memory pure arising. Unclear from suchness back turning arising

[15046-15047]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Former deity seeing portion subsequent memory labeled, not characteristic subsequent memory seen, here delusion [15048].

Eleventh, name's enumeration: Four elements seed aspect, name four possessing, self-characteristic, intermediate flesh form and illusory body smell-eater near-circling, intermediate's five skandhas connection joining, two

[15049-15054]
. While walking, recognition dawns. Immediate. Not after ten thousand steps. Now.

Twelfth, body's measure: Impure karma ones, child eight years like. Pure ones, sixteen year body measure, dream form-like, self-characteristic non-existent

[15055-15063]
. The Great Perfection transcends gradual and sudden. Recognition is the nature itself immediate as awareness.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Emaho!

[15061-15080]
—then at death, recognition will arise spontaneously. Warrior-like—having trained with his weapon, when battle comes he acts without hesitation. Train now, liberate then!

Emaho!

[15066-15098]
Now the colors of rebirth - listen carefully! "Later whatever born body's sign appearing. God-human birth, white. Demi-god and animal birth, yellow. Hungry ghost birth, smoke-like. Hell birth, black wool scattered-like." These aren't literal descriptions! White for god realm isn't about skin color - it's the purity of divine birth. Yellow isn't demi-gods being yellow - it's the quality of desire-energy manifesting!

"Seventh, color: Later whatever born body's sign appearing." By the seventh time, if you still haven't recognized nature, karmic patterns reassert themselves strongly. The color that appears indicates the predominant karmic tendency pulling consciousness toward particular realm!

[15077-15121]
My heart-children, understand! Thirteenth, birthplace identifying: Womb-born, egg-born, warmth-moisture-born, miraculously-born four Recognition is immediate.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[15077-15081]
. This old fool waited for gradual progress. Then a bird called. Immediate. Complete.

Resting in the view, the path is the resting itself. Ground without departure. Spacious presence.

Miraculously-born included. Whatever Dharma corresponding, miracles and light existing, god corresponding

[15081-15100]
—the path appearances, the maturation signs, the bardo instructions. All these are condensed from the sutras and tantras, the pith instructions of the victorious ones.

The four visions of thodgal

[15081-15083]
. 

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

From sky-treasure of Oddiyana: the lotus never closed! Primordial completion blazing!

Those causes: From suchness self-light arising [15084].

Sixteenth, karma connection: Later good migration Dharma possessing birth, here virtue aspect meeting. Later wealth and retinue and enjoyment possessing birth, pleasant aspect meeting

[15082-15083]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The word points. The pointing liberates. Who translates?

Seven days seven, birth-death suffering engaging, hell corresponding. Thus.

"Intermediate existence miraculously born"

[15084-15085]
. 

ROAR! Ground itself! Path never walked! Cut through seeking! NOW!

Dancing ground! Path is dance itself! Never departed! Sky dancing!

Cause: From above emanation aspect seeing arising [15086].

Fourteenth, activity: Suchness truth power dissolving, former attachment habit latency arising, former whatever doing, this also doing

[15085-15087]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

It is not that the treasury opens. It is that the perception of closure dissolves. Precision reveals what was never obscured.

Later faculties incomplete and evil-doer and lower migration etc. birth, unpleasant and poverty etc. aspect meeting

[15079-15087]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Cause: Suchness time self-display bewildered and surprised arising [15080].

Fifteenth, light: Pure karma upper birth ones, white one mile clear. Impure lower migration birth ones, yellow and black dim merely clear

[15088-15091]
. Three words. Recognition. Immediate. Now.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Cause: From suchness attached or anger grasped arising [15092].

Emaho!

[15093-15132]
Listen well, fortunate ones! Seventeenth, body and afflictions' connection: Though form self-characteristic non-existent, dream-like within self-form attached, desire arising. Anger arising, form. Intermediate arising, formless birth

[15093-15096]
. Between preparation and ripeness, recognition is immediate. Spacious knowing without stages.

I have memorized all distinctions. Then I forgot: who was memorizing? The library dissolves into spaciousness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Those causes: From suchness truth missing arising [15097].

Eighteenth, three realms which included: Desire, form, formless three

[15098-15101]
. Logical analysis: if liberation were gradual, it would be compounded. But recognition is uncompounded. Immediate.

I mapped all paths. Then forgot: the ground was never mapped. Never departed from.

Name four's skandhas illusory mind body existing-yet, later skandhas not taken, not existent. Formless form other, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness latency skandhas abiding, formless realm included

[15099-15132]
"This continuum: From above Sambhogakaya's color and hand-emblem seeing." The signs aren't random - they're your own sambhogakaya wisdom recognizing where consciousness is heading! But the crucial teaching: "Seventh, color: Later whatever born body's sign appearing" - if after seven cycles you still haven't awakened, the momentum strengthens.

Emaho! The bardo lasts at most forty-nine days - not because it's limited, but because your consciousness has that much natural momentum. But if you recognize mind's nature during any of these appearances, you're instantly liberated - no more counting days!

[15101-15120]
—direct crossing to the spontaneous presence of the dharmakaya. Mountain climber-like—finally seeing the peak through the clouds, the practitioner sees the kayas directly. Not through gradual steps but direct perception!

Spontaneous liberation

[15102-15108]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Formless cause: From above suchness illusory-like seeing arising [15109].

Nineteenth, next womb entering signs: Seven days or two from seven's gap, intermediate experienced karma exhausted, later existence individually first entering time

[15110-15111]
. The meaning arrives complete. No gradual translation. Immediate.

This old vagabond searched for keys to locked doors. Then saw: no doors. Never were.

God birth place entered, this time mind's appearance divine palace's upper story or jewel house stacked inside abiding thought [15112].

Demi-god womb entered, spark wheel's inside abiding or rain falling center abiding thought coming

[15113-15114]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Human womb entered, extremely cold thought, human body merely. Dull center abiding thought, human body pure. People gathered noise's midst abiding thought, human body precious jewel sign

[15115-15117]
. 

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Emaho!

[15118-15120]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Hungry ghost womb entered, fox hole termite nest's inside abiding thought [15121].

Hell intermediate existence actually abiding [15122].

These arising, womb entered, going wanting also obstruction with, powerless

[15121-15140]
means just this: without abandoning confusion, it is purified; without blocking thoughts, they cease; without training duality, it is resolved. Your own nature is primordially pure—like a lotus rising unstained from mud.

Dharmata nature

[15122-15175]
My devoted students, understand! Animal womb entered, head's inside or cave or termite nest's inside abiding thought Rest in this understanding.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[15122-15123]
. The meaning arrives complete. No gradual translation. Immediate.

Thus. The path reveals itself as the ground. What seemed journey was always arrival.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Cause: From above suchness truth not confident [15123].

Twentieth, example: Like grass holding fire. Like mud holding substance or jewel or wood etc. Like bird mother holding bird. Like summer's flesh rotting, flies gathering. Father mother's union's womb door, intermediate beings countless gathered, that merely

[15124-15129]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Thus. The structure reveals what transcends structure. Complete from the beginning. No opening necessary.

Father mother's bliss's taste merely experiencing, there birth's karma ones, self-powerless, womb developed, mother's excrement door enters [15130].

Those also from Union of Sun and Moon: "This not scripture corresponding. Sentient beings' entering. Existence intermediate called. Samsara abode's path head. Like example swirling water, circling. Flesh-blood self-grasping form free, illusory mind form. Coarse free, name second. Former mind's appearance ceased. Later itself not arisen. Lineage whichever uncertain. Whatever sets whatever appears that time. Instant abiding intermediate. Later whatever born's characteristics holding. Later arising characteristics all held. Six lineages individually appearance aspects become. Desire realm vessel general. Essence self knowing clear. Self whatever born's vessel-essence also. That itself time clear. Desire possessing vessel-essence clear appearing. Faculties limbs complete. Elements all unobstructed. Mountain-rock etc. unobstructed entering. Other from life seven days. Days seven sets seven.

Animal also blood coagulated-like. Demi-god rain falling-like. That time head thus: God and human upward looking. Demi-god animal likewise sideways. Hungry ghost hell downward looking. These just birth's power. Existence intermediate's karma: Accumulating and not accumulating, signs this. Ripening latency non-existent. Intermediate's power cause's result. Latency this accumulates. That time mind's signs this. Whatever karma pure. Mind itself clear. Those four impure. Unclear. All virtue evil karma arising. Name's enumeration this. These all knowing. Name four possessing self.

[15131-15237]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle vast oceanic completion. Never closed. Never opened. Simply what is.

Emaho!

[15141-15160]
is not somewhere else. It is this very awareness reading these words, hearing these sounds, thinking these thoughts—yet free from grasping. Like the sky that holds all clouds yet is never touched by them.

The thigle expands

[15161-15180]
, pervades, dissolves into itself. This is not annihilation but the great perfection—where ground, path, and result are inseparable. You have never been separate from the buddha-nature; you only forgot, like a rich man who dreams he is poor.

Now remembering

[15181-15200]
, recognize! This is the crucial moment. Do not postpone liberation to some future life—seize it now, in this very breath, this very thought. The door is open; walk through!

Emaho!

[15201-15220]
—the marks of liberation, the indications of maturation, the portents of the path. Physician-like, reading the pulse—the wise practitioner reads these signs.

The four lamps shine

[15221-15240]
—the lamp of space, the lamp of thigle, the lamp of wisdom, the lamp of water. Each illuminates a facet of your true nature. Together they dispel the darkness of ignorance, revealing the primordial mandala that has always been present.

Thodgal's four visions

[15238-15274]
Listen, you who would be free! Thus from existence bardo, path traversed, karma's power, Joyous, Strife, Equal, Two Possessing, Hunger, Great Suffering possessing abodes, like swirling water, one to one going, called six lineages The nature is complete.

Diamond precision: pierce the distinction-maker. Obstacles transform into diamond wisdom. Liberation through wrath.

[15238-15246]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

From Self-Arising: "Conceptual thought samsara only. Wailing great abode and. Extreme hunger abodes. Dull intoxicated great abode. Very coarse abode and. Likewise equal abode great. Extreme joy abode explained. Not realized sentient beings. From that going non-existent"

[15241-15260]
—dharmata appearing, experiences maturing, awareness reaching full measure, exhaustion of phenomena. Like the dawn progressing to full day, recognition deepens until all is light. This is not gradual cultivation but direct manifestation!

Spontaneous liberation

[15247-15256]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Thus.
