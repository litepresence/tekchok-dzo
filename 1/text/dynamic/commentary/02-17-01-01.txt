[1754-1766] Now, explaining the stages of practice through determining the path. Those with object-mind (yul gyi blo can)—practitioners who cognize external objects—are led upward by entering certainty through the supreme method of gradual cultivation. Those with rigpa's self-appearance mind (rig pa rang snang gi blo can)—practitioners who recognize awareness's own display—take direct practice through well-explained crucial points. Fortunate ones journey to the great liberation city in this very life. Generally, first entering stages of mind-determining shown—the gradual progression from beginner to recognition.

[1754-1766] Three words. Path. Certainty. Stop. You think the path leads somewhere. The path is the ground you already stand on. Certainty is not something to achieve. It is the recognition that there is nothing to achieve. Those with object-mind, those with rigpa-mind—both are mind. Stop dividing. See what is. Rest.

[1754-1766] This old man has guided both types! The gradual ones need steps, signs, maps. They want to know "what comes next?" The direct ones need pointing, shocking, sudden recognition. They ask "what is this?" Both reach the same city. The city was never far. Some take the long road enjoying the scenery. Some arrive before they leave. Both are kindness. Both are necessary. Neither is wrong.

[1754-1766] Philosophically, this establishes a pedagogical distinction, not an ontological hierarchy. Object-mind practitioners operate within subject-object duality; they require methodical paths with clear stages. Rigpa-mind practitioners recognize non-dual awareness; they can engage direct pointing. Yet both are classifications of approach, not fixed identities. A practitioner may begin as object-mind and mature into rigpa-mind. The distinction serves teaching, not limitation.

[1767-1781] First place meaning: three aspects. First, general differentiations—who practices and how. From Rang-shar tantra: "Listen listen nearby retinue! Characteristic word yogi, sign merely-holding yogi, following-conduct yogi, nature-definite yogi, appearance-mind yogi, enter-action yogi, action-cause yogi, doer-condition yogi, final-result yogi, true-meaning yogi, final-liberation yogi, completed-action yogi!" Twelve types enumerated, each approaching practice differently.

[1767-1781] Three words. Twelve. Yogis. Stop. You count them like sheep. Twelve types, twelve mistakes. Each one closer, each one still missing. The word-yogi worships letters. The sign-yogi grasps at symbols. The conduct-yogi performs rituals. The nature-yogi meditates on emptiness. The mind-yogi realizes appearances are mind. All are mind's games. Stop playing. See what is.

[1767-1781] TWELVE YOGIS! TWELVE TRAPS! speaks with fierce compassion Each one thinks they're practicing! Each one thinks they're progressing! But look—who practices? Who progresses? The practitioner is the practice! The progress is the recognition that there was never anyone to progress! Cut through all twelve! SEE WHAT WAS NEVER DIVIDED!

[1782-1808] Second, explaining individual meanings: twelve yogis, first eight not liberated, later four liberated manner definitely shown. From that same Rang-shar text: "Characteristic word yogi: attached to words, operating with words, not knowing, depending on words—that I have not said is liberation." Mere scholasticism—intellectual mastery without realization. "Sign-depending yogi: oneself depending on signs, conduct makes others envious, oneself bound by own thought—that also I have not said is liberation." External signs without internal recognition. "Following yogi: those dwelling in faithful ground, doing faithful conduct, first ground hope placed—that itself I have not said is liberation." Faith without direct seeing.

[1782-1808] This old man was a word-yogi once! Knew every sutra, every shastra. Could quote Nagarjuna, Maitreya, Dharmakirti. Thought knowledge was liberation. Monks respected him; scholars consulted him. Then one day, reading the same words—suddenly they dissolved. The words remained. The knower dissolved. That was the turning. Before that, just piling up words like stones, building a wall that blocked the view.

[1782-1808] The eight unliberated yogis integrate into one lesson: seeking outside misses the mark. Whether seeking in words, signs, faith, conduct, meditation, mind, action, or causes—all seek something external to themselves. The integration recognizes: what is sought is the seeker. The liberation sought is the liberation already present. Stop seeking; start recognizing.

[1809-1846] "Appearance-mind yogi: all arisen from my mind, realizing mind itself what is there to do? Thus speaking everywhere—I have not said is liberation." The Cittamatra realization—mind-only—is profound but incomplete. Realizing appearances are mind is necessary; stopping there is limitation. "Enter-action yogi: meaning itself by action wishes to accomplish, bound by great action, first mind-generation action does, from then holding all actions doing accomplishing—that also I have not said is liberation." The karma-yogi, the engaged practitioner, accumulating merit through action—valuable but not liberation. "Action-cause yogi: continuum itself made path, depending on cause, hoping for cause, cause itself clearly shown—that also I have not said is liberation." The causal practitioner, believing liberation results from causes—missing spontaneous presence.

[1809-1846] These three—appearance-mind, enter-action, action-cause—represent progressively subtler misunderstandings. Appearance-mind is philosophical: one realizes idealism but not emptiness. Enter-action is practical: one engages virtue but grasps at results. Action-cause is metaphysical: one understands dependent origination but reifies the causal process. Each is closer; each still misses. The error is not in what they see but in what they don't see: recognition transcends all positions.

[1809-1846] Three words. Mind. Action. Cause. Stop. Three more traps. Mind-yogi thinks realizing mind is enough. Action-yogi thinks doing good liberates. Cause-yogi thinks the path is causal. All miss the crucial point: recognition is not achievement. Liberation is not result. Stop seeking liberation in doing. See what is.

[1847-1858] "Doer-condition yogi: by conduct true meaning seeks, holding discordant aspects—that also I have not said is liberation." The eighth unliberated—seeking through conduct, practicing to achieve, still bound by doing. Then the four liberated: "Final-result yogi: realization made path, not dwelling in grounds and paths, own thatness seeing, true great liberation desired." Dwelling nowhere, seeing own-nature. "True-meaning yogi: own realization obtained also, bardo appearance pure, own true nature seeing, from that final liberation desired." Recognizing bardo as display, seeing true nature. "Final-liberation yogi: certainty-obtained yogi, certainty-obtained ground itself, own thatness found seeing, true ground transcending desired." Certainty of recognition, finding own-nature, transcending even ground. "Completed-action yogi: primordially pure great Buddha, from that departed not said. Great yogi to these four, ground refining not said, path traversing not said."

[1847-1858] This old man spent years refining the ground! Polishing, cleaning, preparing. Meditation sessions, purification practices, accumulation of merit. Then one day—the ground laughed at me. "What are you polishing? I am pure from the beginning. What are you purifying? I am unsullied from the start." I wept. The tears were the path I never needed to walk. The four yogis know this secret: nothing to refine, nowhere to traverse, nothing to achieve.

[1847-1858] The essence of the four liberated yogis: they recognize what was never lost. Final-result: not dwelling in grounds and paths—transcending the very framework of practice. True-meaning: bardo appearances pure—recognizing death and intermediate states as display. Final-liberation: certainty-obtained—no doubt, no seeking, no refinement. Completed-action: primordially pure Buddha—recognition complete from the beginning. Hold this essence.

[1859-1860] Third, supreme place determining: though here clear light manifestly doing, lower entering, ground-path refining traversing not said, oneself path's three doors' stains and thick accumulations' aggregates, moving thoughts, coarse wind-mind mind needing pure, those pure when lower's ground-path coincidentally complete, upper completed lower coincidentally complete intending, Great Perfection's one, refining traversing not said. One ground is rigpa spontaneously accomplished—from Kunjed Gyalpo: "All-doing, not transformed, not refined, rigpa spontaneously completed!" Thus the Great Perfection teaches: not that lower paths are rejected, but when recognition is direct, lower paths complete coincidentally. The ground doesn't need refining—it is primordially pure. The path doesn't need traversing—it is spontaneously present.

[1859-1860] Three words. One. Ground. Stop. All paths lead to this recognition: one ground, one rigpa, one completion. Spontaneously accomplished—not achieved, not transformed, not refined. The twelve yogis are one yogi with twelve faces. The four liberated are the eight unliberated when they stop seeking. Stop counting. Start recognizing. See what is. Rest.

[1859-1860] This completes the presentation of the twelve yogis from the Rang-shar tantra. The distinction between the eight who seek outside and the four who recognize inside is not a permanent classification—it is a pedagogical pointing. Even the eight are practicing; even the four once practiced. The path accommodates all capacities. The Great Perfection doesn't reject gradual methods; it transcends them while including them. When recognition is direct, the gradual completes itself. When recognition hasn't dawned, the gradual prepares the ground. Both serve the same purpose: liberation of sentient beings. This is the compassion of the teachings.

[Final] Twelve yogis, twelve stages of recognition. Eight seek outside in words, signs, faith, conduct, meditation, mind, action, causes—and miss. Four recognize inside: realization as path, bardo purified, certainty obtained, primordially complete. All twelve are your own mind's display. Which yogi are you? The one asking is the one sought. The seeker is the finding.

Emaho! The twelve yogis and the one recognition! The path that leads everywhere and nowhere! The liberation that was never lost!

See what is. Rest in recognition. The Treasury reveals what was never hidden.
