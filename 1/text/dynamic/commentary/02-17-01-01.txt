[1754-1766] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Now, explaining the stages of practice through determining the path. Those with object-mind are led upward by entering certainty through the supreme method. Those with rigpa's self-appearance mind take direct practice through well-explained crucial points—fortunate ones journey to the great liberation city in this very life. Generally, first entering stages of mind-determining shown.

[1754-1766] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Path. Certainty. Stop. You think the path leads somewhere. The path is the ground you already stand on. Certainty is not something to achieve. It is the recognition that there is nothing to achieve. Those with object-mind, those with rigpa-mind—both are mind. Stop dividing.

[1754-1766] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man has guided both types! The gradual ones need steps, signs, maps. The direct ones need pointing, shocking, sudden recognition. Both reach the same city. The city was never far. Some take the long road enjoying the scenery. Some arrive before they leave. Both are kindness.

[1754-1766] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The path of certainty is the consort's embrace—tight, unyielding, liberating. Object-mind practitioners grasp the path as external. Rigpa-mind practitioners recognize the path as self-display. Both are embraced by the same wisdom. Both dissolve into the same expanse.

[1754-1766] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I once walked a mountain trail for three days to reach a hermitage. When I arrived, the hermit said "You could have come directly through the forest." The long path taught me patience. The short path would have taught me nothing. Both paths led to the same fire.

[1767-1781] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First place meaning: three aspects. First, general differentiations. From Rang-shar: "Listen listen nearby retinue! Characteristic word yogi, sign merely-holding yogi, following-conduct yogi, nature-definite yogi, appearance-mind yogi, enter-action yogi, action-cause yogi, doer-condition yogi, final-result yogi, true-meaning yogi, final-liberation yogi, completed-action yogi!"

[1767-1781] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Twelve. Yogis. Stop. You count them like sheep. Twelve types, twelve mistakes. Each one closer, each one still missing. The word-yogi worships letters. The sign-yogi grasps at symbols. The conduct-yogi performs rituals. All are mind's games. Stop playing.

[1767-1781] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man has met all twelve! The word-yogi can quote every text but knows nothing. The sign-yogi sees visions and thinks they're real. The final-liberation yogi thinks they're done. Hah! Twelve ways to miss the point. But missing the point is also the path. Even mistakes are wisdom's display.

[1782-1808] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, explaining individual meanings: twelve yogis, first eight not liberated, later four liberated manner definitely shown. From that same text: "Characteristic word yogi: attached to words, operating with words, not knowing, depending on words—that I have not said is liberation. Sign-depending yogi: oneself depending on signs, conduct makes others envious, oneself bound by own thought—that also I have not said is liberation. Following yogi: those dwelling in faithful ground, doing faithful conduct, first ground hope placed—that itself I have not said is liberation."

[1782-1808] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Not. Liberated. Stop. Eight yogis, eight failures. Why? Because they seek outside. Words, signs, faith, conduct—all external. Liberation cannot be external. It is the recognition of what you already are. Stop seeking liberation in doing.

[1782-1808] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man was a word-yogi once! Knew every sutra, every shastra. Thought knowledge was liberation. Then one day, reading the same words—suddenly they dissolved. The words remained. The knower dissolved. That was the turning. Before that, just piling up words like stones.

[1809-1846] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): "Appearance-mind yogi: all arisen from my mind, realizing mind itself what is there to do? Thus speaking everywhere—I have not said is liberation. Enter-action yogi: meaning itself by action wishes to accomplish, bound by great action, first mind-generation action does, from then holding all actions doing accomplishing—that also I have not said is liberation. Action-cause yogi: continuum itself made path, depending on cause, hoping for cause, cause itself clearly shown—that also I have not said is liberation."

[1809-1846] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Mind. Action. Cause. Stop. Three more traps. Mind-yogi thinks realizing mind is enough. Action-yogi thinks doing good liberates. Cause-yogi thinks the path is causal. All miss the crucial point: recognition is not achievement. Liberation is not result.

[1809-1846] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): WORDS! SIGNS! CONDUCT! speaks with fierce compassion I will slash them all! But look—nothing to slash! The yogi who seeks liberation is already liberated! The seeking is the only bondage! SEE THIS! Liberation is not something to say!

[1847-1858] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): "Doer-condition yogi: by conduct true meaning seeks, holding discordant aspects—that also I have not said is liberation. Final-result yogi: realization made path, not dwelling in grounds and paths, own thatness seeing, true great liberation desired. True-meaning yogi: own realization obtained also, bardo appearance pure, own true nature seeing, from that final liberation desired. Final-liberation yogi: certainty-obtained yogi, certainty-obtained ground itself, own thatness found seeing, true ground transcending desired. Completed-action yogi: primordially pure great Buddha, from that departed not said. Great yogi to these four, ground refining not said, path traversing not said."

[1847-1858] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Four. Liberated. Stop. Finally, four who understand. Not dwelling in grounds and paths. Not seeking liberation as result. Recognizing what was never lost. These four are not better yogis. They just stopped looking outside. The ground doesn't need refining. The path doesn't need traversing.

[1847-1858] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man spent years refining the ground! Polishing, cleaning, preparing. Then one day—the ground laughed at me. "What are you polishing? I am pure from the beginning." I wept. The tears were the path I never needed to walk. The four yogis know this secret.

[1859-1908] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Third, supreme place determining: yogi differences generally shown, suitable vessel particular explanation. Also, though here clear light manifestly doing, lower entering, ground-path refining traversing not said, oneself path's three doors' stains and thick accumulations' aggregates, moving thoughts, coarse wind-mind mind needing pure, those pure when lower's ground-path coincidentally complete, upper completed lower coincidentally complete intending, Great Perfection's one, refining traversing not said. One ground is rigpa spontaneously accomplished—Kunjed: "All-doing, not transformed, not refined, rigpa spontaneously completed!" Thus.

[1859-1908] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. One. Ground. Stop. All paths lead to this recognition: one ground, one rigpa, one completion. The twelve yogis are one yogi with twelve faces. The four liberated are the eight unliberated when they stop seeking. Stop counting. Start recognizing.

[Final] Twelve yogis, twelve stages of recognition. Eight seek outside and miss. Four recognize inside and rest. All twelve are your own mind's display. Which yogi are you? The one asking is the one sought.

Emaho! The twelve yogis and the one recognition!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
