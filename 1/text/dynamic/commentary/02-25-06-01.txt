The Buddha appears not just in pure forms, but in impure forms too—appearing as hunters, fishermen, even criminals—to benefit beings who can only be reached in those forms. This is ultimate compassion—not holding to purity, but appearing wherever needed. Emaho! Emanations everywhere, benefiting all!

Concepts fall away; what remains is mind's nature displaying itself.

The treasure was never hidden—lacking nothing.

"Nirmanakaya without fixation,
From dharma-expanse, trainees' own abode,
To six realms' fortunate, awakened,
With elaboration word-speech,
Whatever faculties, all dharmas,
From mindfulness self-clear mind,
To faculties without desire, spread on tongue,
Shown as vehicles' enumeration of dharmas.

Longchenpa indicates what words cannot reach pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Not found through analysis; awareness meets itself here."

The key insight: nirmanakaya isn't fixed in one form. It appears wherever needed, to whoever is ready, teaching according to capacity. The Buddha isn't "somewhere else"—he's right here, appearing in response to your mind.

This is the magical display of enlightenment—not bound by time, place, or form, yet appearing in all times, places, and forms to benefit beings!

Emaho! Three kayas, three levels, benefiting all!
