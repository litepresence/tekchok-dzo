See directly: So. We proceed. The hindrance liberates itself when made the path—gegs lam du khyer.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The nature of mind reveals itself directly, not through understanding.

Concepts fall away; what remains is mind's nature displaying itself.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

This hermit realized: This yogi. Liberation is simultaneous with recognition, never gradual.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path.
fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion.
the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Confusion is wisdom wearing a mask—recognition removes it wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Complexity is simplicity wearing a mask—before analysis, already complete.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

Third, rigpa's self-abiding meditation and channel-wind resting meditation—two methods of one-pointed abiding, similar in appearance. Yet self-force meditation always carries moisture of effort, while channel-wind meditation risks dullness or excitement—much effort required. Thus the difference in conditions. The nature remains complete.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The obstacle is the grasping; seeing it, it frees itself.

The path is the ground seen clearly.

Cut through now! Look. It is here. The moment of recognition is the moment of freedom, never gradual.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The chest was always empty and full—complete from the first.

The gap between thoughts is where recognition dawns.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

Look now: Accordingly. The analysis. Recognition is immediate liberation, never gradual.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Longchenpa indicates what words cannot reach pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Difficulty is the mind's creation—liberation is immediate (cig car ba).

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

This old hermit once saw a yogi practicing deity yoga. The form was beautiful, radiant. But when the session ended, the yogi returned to ordinary confusion. Another yogi saw only light, no form. Which is better? The one who recognizes the nature (rang bzhin), regardless of appearance.

Sixth, nature's emanation field appears alongside the mother bardo—Buddha's pure field showing two Buddhas. Enjoyment appearance seems similar to pure field, yet nature's emanation arises through spontaneous self-appearance, while mother bardo arises from confusion meeting stagnant appearance. Thus: self-appearance versus other-appearance—know the distinction.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

Between appearance and reality, the vast middle way opens. The distinctions are not judgments but precise diagnoses. Like a doctor distinguishing between symptoms—similar appearances, different causes, different treatments. Know the distinctions, or treat the wrong disease.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Sudden recognition! In this manner. Immediate (cig car ba)—not progressive, never gradual.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind.
the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

Obstacles exist only for the one who thinks they need to overcome them.

Seeing simplifies the complex—before analysis, already complete.

What appears as obstacle is the path itself, unrecognized.

This old hermit once heard two teachers: one said liberation is definite, one said spontaneous. He was confused until he realized—they were speaking of the same nature from different aspects. Like describing water as wet and as thirst-quenching—both true, neither the full description.

Eighth, lower mind examining view meditation and rigpa's direct view meditation—two with similar names. Yet the difference between faculty and rigpa, between appearance and non-appearance, is vast. The nature is whole as it is.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Longchenpa shows what must be seen directly pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

In the interval (bar snang), awareness sees itself directly. Ninth, rigpa body and concept deity body two deity see similar, though vast small and permanent impermanent and concept familiarization do need not need distinction.

Between these extremes: Hence. The structure. Freedom through recognition happens now, not later, never gradual.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

The deluded mind is wisdom not recognizing itself wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Self-liberation: the grasping at understanding frees itself.

The nature is not found elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

This wanderer noticed: A practitioner. Obstacle and path are one—recognition transforms.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Self-liberation: the very act of grasping frees itself when recognized.

The treasure was never hidden—full as emptiness.

Eleventh, light-clear primordial resonance bindu and wind-mind grasping rainbow light bindu—two empty forms arising similarly. Yet nature's pure bindu dimension appears as rigpa, clear and temporary improvement mandala arises between. Without wind grasping, affliction and concept self-cease. Clear self-abiding becomes meditation's ornament. Channel-wind signs—ten pure winds—effortlessly trace and follow. Increase and decrease become unstable, unclear, parts decrease. Concept and affliction, coarse at first, later clear. Abiding part becomes moist and small. Thus the distinction is very great.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path.
fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion.
the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

This very moment— Consequently. The treasury was never concealed, only overlooked.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Recognition, not comprehension—awareness seeing itself.

The divider is divided—seeing this is the teaching.

This old hermit's final word: Don't argue about which system is best. They are all fingers pointing. The finger that points most clearly for you is the best finger—for you. Don't try to use someone else's prescription for your illness.

The Treasury's presentation of distinctions—between all-ground and Dharmakaya, between rigpa and mind, between appearances and reality—these are not philosophical positions to adopt but distinctions to dissolve in recognition. The all-ground gathers habits. Dharmakaya is free from the start. Know the difference and rest in what is free.

A student once confused all-ground with Dharmakaya! Thought they were the same. Then realized: one gathers, one is free. One is confusion, one is recognition. The distinction matters—until recognition dissolves it.

The nine distinctions in this chapter are like nine keys for nine different locks. Each opens a specific confusion. But once the door is open, the key is no longer needed. Don't carry the keys after entering the house.

Distinctions! Differences! All concepts! Cut through them! Can you find the all-ground? Can you grasp the Dharmakaya? Both are awareness playing! SEE THROUGH THE PLAY!

The three that strike: See the nature. Remain there. Return when distracted. Distinguish to recognize. Recognize to dissolve. Stop in dissolution. Complete.

The nine distinctions integrate into complete diagnostic framework. Each distinction reveals a specific confusion. Each recognition dissolves that confusion. Integration means seeing through all nine simultaneously.

Emaho! The distinctions! The recognitions! What clarity! This yogi dances with joy—not because distinctions are special but because they lead to recognition!

Thus concludes the presentation of distinctions. May all who encounter these words recognize the difference between confusion and recognition. May they rest in recognition. Complete.

This traveler bows to the distinctions. Thanks them for their clarity. May you see through them quickly. Rest in what remains. Complete.

Final words. Distinguish. Dissolve. Rest. Stop. The teaching on distinctions is complete. You are complete. Rest. The end.
