See directly: Thus. We proceed. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

This hermit realized: This yogi. Secret recognition: immediate as moonlight. No gradual increase. Full in each moment.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

Third, rigpa's self-abiding meditation and channel-wind resting meditation—two methods of one-pointed abiding, similar in appearance. Yet self-force meditation always carries moisture of effort, while channel-wind meditation risks dullness or excitement—much effort required. Thus the difference in conditions. The nature remains complete.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Attend. Recognize. Liberate.

Cut through now! Look. It is here. The meaning arrives complete. No gradual translation. Immediate.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

NOW! The treasury blazes open! Was never closed! Immediate revelation!

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[20379-20404]
Look now: Accordingly. The analysis. The Great Perfection transcends gradual and sudden. Recognition is the nature itself immediate as awareness.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

This old hermit once saw a yogi practicing deity yoga. The form was beautiful, radiant. But when the session ended, the yogi returned to ordinary confusion. Another yogi saw only light, no form. Which is better? The one who recognizes the nature (rang bzhin), regardless of appearance.

[20410-20426]
Sudden recognition! In this manner. While walking, recognition dawns. Immediate. Not after ten thousand steps. Now.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears as obstacle is the path itself, unrecognized.

[20425-20426]
This old hermit once heard two teachers: one said liberation is definite, one said spontaneous. He was confused until he realized—they were speaking of the same nature from different aspects. Like describing water as wet and as thirst-quenching—both true, neither the full description.

[20426-20426]
Eighth, lower mind examining view meditation and rigpa's direct view meditation—two with similar names. Yet the difference between faculty and rigpa, between appearance and non-appearance, is vast. The nature is complete.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

 Ninth, rigpa body and concept deity body two deity see similar, though vast small and permanent impermanent and concept familiarization do need not need distinction.
