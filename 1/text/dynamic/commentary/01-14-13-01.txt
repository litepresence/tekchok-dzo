See directly: Thus. We proceed. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[20285-20305]
This hermit realized: This yogi. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[20305-20325]
Voice 20 proclaims: Third, rigpa self-abide meditation and channel wind rest meditation two one-pointed abide similar, though self-force meditation moist with always exist, channel wind meditation dull excitement much effort condition exist difference. The nature is complete.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[20320-20345]
Cut through now! Look. It is here. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[20335-20360]
Look now: Accordingly. The analysis. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[20350-20375]
This old hermit once saw a yogi practicing deity yoga. The form was beautiful, radiant. But when the session ended, the yogi returned to ordinary confusion. Another yogi saw only light, no form. Which is better? The one who recognizes the nature (rang bzhin), regardless of appearance.

[20375-20400]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Sixth, nature emanation field appear and mother bardo Buddha pure field show Buddha two, enjoyment appearance part pure field with similar similar similar, though nature emanation self-appearance spontaneous door arise, mother bardo confusion appearance stagnant mother meet appear difference. Actually self-appearance other-appearance distinction.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

[20390-20415]
Between appearance and reality, the vast middle way opens. The distinctions are not judgments but precise diagnoses. Like a doctor distinguishing between symptoms—similar appearances, different causes, different treatments. Know the distinctions, or treat the wrong disease.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

[20410-20426]
Sudden recognition! In this manner. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears as obstacle is the path itself, unrecognized.

[20425-20426]
This old hermit once heard two teachers: one said liberation is definite, one said spontaneous. He was confused until he realized—they were speaking of the same nature from different aspects. Like describing water as wet and as thirst-quenching—both true, neither the full description.

[20285-20285]
Voice 20 proclaims: Eighth, lower mind examine view meditation and rigpa direct view meditation two name similar, though faculty and rigpa appear not appear difference great. The nature is complete.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. Ninth, rigpa body and concept deity body two deity see similar, though vast small and permanent impermanent and concept familiarization do need not need distinction.

[20285-20285]
Between these extremes: Hence. The structure. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

[20285-20285]
This wanderer noticed: A practitioner. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[20285-20285]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Eleventh, light clear primordial resonance bindu and wind mind grasp rainbow light bindu two empty form arise similar, though nature pure bindu dimension rigpa appearance, clear and temporary improvement mandala between arise, wind grasp not depend, affliction concept self-cease, clear self-abide meditation ornament, channel wind sign ten pure wind effort trace follow, increase decrease many not stable, not clear, part decrease, concept affliction coarse later clear arise, abide part moist small etc., distinction very great.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

[20285-20285]
This very moment— Consequently. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[20285-20285]
This old hermit's final word: Don't argue about which system is best. They are all fingers pointing. The finger that points most clearly for you is the best finger—for you. Don't try to use someone else's prescription for your illness.

[20285-20426] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The Treasury's presentation of distinctions—between all-ground and Dharmakaya, between rigpa and mind, between appearances and reality—these are not philosophical positions to adopt but distinctions to dissolve in recognition. The all-ground gathers habits. Dharmakaya is free from the start. Know the difference and rest in what is free.

[20285-20426] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond once confused all-ground with Dharmakaya! Thought they were the same. Then realized: one gathers, one is free. One is confusion, one is recognition. The distinction matters—until recognition dissolves it.

[20285-20426] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The nine distinctions in this chapter are like nine keys for nine different locks. Each opens a specific confusion. But once the door is open, the key is no longer needed. Don't carry the keys after entering the house.

[20285-20426] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Distinctions! Differences! All concepts! Cut through them! Can you find the all-ground? Can you grasp the Dharmakaya? Both are awareness playing! SEE THROUGH THE PLAY!

[20285-20426] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Distinguish. Recognize. Stop. Distinguish to recognize. Recognize to dissolve. Stop in dissolution. Complete.

[20285-20426] Voice 08 (Integrator): The nine distinctions integrate into complete diagnostic framework. Each distinction reveals a specific confusion. Each recognition dissolves that confusion. Integration means seeing through all nine simultaneously.

[20285-20426] Voice 12 (Ecstatic): Emaho! The distinctions! The recognitions! What clarity! This yogi dances with joy—not because distinctions are special but because they lead to recognition!

[20285-20426] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thus concludes the presentation of distinctions. May all who encounter these words recognize the difference between confusion and recognition. May they rest in recognition. Complete.

[20285-20426] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond bows to the distinctions. Thanks them for their clarity. May you see through them quickly. Rest in what remains. Complete.

[20285-20426] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Final words. Distinguish. Dissolve. Rest. Stop. The teaching on distinctions is complete. You are complete. Rest. The end.
