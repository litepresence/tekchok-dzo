See what is.
The thirteen fields are not places you travel to.
What appears here is the nature of mind revealing itself—nothing to understand, only to recognize.

Garab Dorje points: The thirteen fields are not outside you. They are the thirteen ways awareness recognizes itself. The field of pure appearance is the clarity of your awareness. The field of complete purity is the emptiness of your awareness. The field of great extent is the expanse of your awareness. When you recognize these, you are not traveling to new places—you are recognizing what was always present.

Therefore. Thus. We establish the mandala. Five families radiate from center—Vairochana's realm not above but at the heart of everything. The jewel lotus supports twenty-five stacked realms like prayer flags supporting wind. Where do they stack? In the space your thoughts occupy. The question misunderstands. Space itself is the thirteenth field.

The Lotus-Born describes: The mandala is not drawn in sand—it is the pattern of your own awareness. The five families are the five wisdoms manifesting as five aspects of the Buddha. The twenty-five fields are the twenty-five ways awareness can recognize itself. When you rest in the nature, you are already in all twenty-five fields simultaneously. No need to visualize them. No need to travel to them. They are your own display.

A cave hermit... spent a summer watching high plateau lakes mirror the sky. Each morning different—cracks like lightning across ice, smooth patches holding perfect reflections, wind ripples erasing both. He thought he was observing water. The water was teaching him. The lake was teaching the sky. Who was observing whom?

Patrul laughs: The observer and the observed are one lake. The reflection and the reflector are one water. The sky and the lake are one display. When you understand this, you understand the thirteen fields—not as places to go, but as ways of seeing. The thirteenth field is the one who sees all twelve. But when you look for the seer, only the seen remains. This is the field that contains all fields.

Thal-ba-dbyangs below this Jambudvipa—vast, beautiful, cause and condition playing freely like juniper smoke rising through mountain air. The teaching here is whispered not spoken, written not in books but in the arrangement of stones pilgrims place one by one over centuries. Delightful arrangement of what was never arranged. You sit in the thirteenth realm thinking it coarse clay. The coarseness is your perception, not the ground (gzhi).

[595-605]
Thal-ba-'dzin below the six worlds—wheel-shaped, completely pure like a prayer wheel spun by wind without hand. I dreamed of flying through these realms last winter. Passed through the wheel and saw my own face in every spoke, every realm, every Buddha-field. The teaching there is Truth itself, they say. What does that mean? It means no one is lying to you. No one is teaching you. The wheel turns itself. The wind prays itself.

[606-618]
Thalwa Brdal above—lotus-blossom shaped, extremely expansive like a glacier calving into turquoise lake. White and red shimmering without coarse form, the way dawn light touches snow peaks without touching. This is where abhidharma expands to fill the aeon. Like a flower opening so slowly that watching it, you become the opening. The skull-garlands at Thalwa's Drum are not ornaments of death. They are memories of heads that once thought they were separate, now strung together as one recognition.

[619-634]
Northeast intermediate—Thalwa's Current, stupa-shaped, five arrangements, various sounds emerging like hot spring water bubbling from earth's deep warmth. Dependent arising taught here not as dry philosophy but as the actual mechanism of how worlds emerge from attention—your attention, right now, creating this field. At twenty-one, the utterly pervasive: no inside, no outside. Just pervading, like sky pervades without effort. The causal condition pervading action—your next breath is already there, waiting for you to notice. The stone cairn at the mountain pass has been waiting centuries for you to add your stone.

Between the architecture of the thirteen fields and the recognition that transcends all fields, Longchenpa weaves the path. Not rejecting the cosmology. Not grasping it. The fields are The pen moves, leaving traces. The trace is not the thought.. The moon is your own face. Rest there.

This practitioner has nothing more to say. The thirteen fields have been mapped. The prayer flags have been hung. Now walk.

[578-578]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. The thirteen fields are not sequential destinations. They are simultaneous aspects of awareness. You are not traveling through them. You are them. Recognition is not at the end of the journey. It is the journey itself, seen through.

[578-578]
Look. It is here. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked. 

[578-578]
Thus. We proceed. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Secret instruction: the distinction-maker is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight dissolves the moon.

[578-578]
An old practitioner once asked: "Which field am I in now?" His teacher replied: "The one you're asking about." The question dissolved. The asker remained. That is the thirteenth field.

[578-578]
Recognize immediately. Three words. Recognition. Immediate. Now. The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
