Tenth eon complete, some abandon killing—lifespan increases twenty years. Likewise, abandoning stealing—forty years. Wrong conduct—hundred years. Divisive speech—two hundred. Idle speech—five hundred. Harsh speech—thousand. Covetousness—two thousand. Malice—ten thousand. Wrong view—twenty thousand. Attachment to non-recognition's desire—forty thousand. Wrong dharma practice—eighty thousand.

A practitioner once calculated these lifespans obsessively! "If I abandon killing, I get twenty years. If I abandon stealing, forty more..." Adding up the years like a merchant counting coins. Finally he laughed—lifespan is not merit accumulated. Recognition is not years gained. The numbers describe possibilities, not guarantees.

Lifespan increasing, likewise form and enjoyment increase—prospering and flourishing.

Mountain hermit watched the village below his cave. He saw prosperity come and go like seasons. One year abundant harvest, the next year famine. Lifespans grew and shrank with virtue, but the watcher—the awareness that knew these changes—that never changed.

Third, one increasing: after intermediate gaps complete, from similar counting custom, from immeasurable gone, decreasing like before—called not-long-long.

Between those, from beings' merit appearance, happiness and virtue and Buddhas and Dharma and Sangha and various pure dharmas abide. From non-merit, suffering and wrong going and wrong teachers and tenet varieties and karma and afflictions and six realms and four births and individual appearance objects and enjoyments and various happiness-suffering appearing, they engage.

This wandering yogi understood: merit and non-merit are not external forces. They are recognition and non-recognition displaying as circumstances. When mind recognizes its nature, Buddhas and Dharma appear. When mind forgets, suffering and wrong paths appear. The display changes; the nature never changes.

Then destruction's intermediate eon twenty: abiding complete, change-transfer appearance arises. That also: nineteen for essence destruction—beings. One for vessel destruction—world, thus twenty pass.

Beings' destruction manner: from hell realm not arising in new forest, beginning; this world hells and pretas and animals' old ones life-transferred, new not arisen, thus emptied—lower realms emptied.

That also: by bad karma performed, certainly newly born in lower realms, those here go to other worlds' lower realms, here not born, thus emptied.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why fear destruction? The world burns, the realms empty, suns blaze—meanwhile, what burns? What empties? What blazes? Find what never changes.
destruction becomes display!

Then humans' destruction: lifespan gradually decreasing to ten years, disease kalpa destroys; weapons and famine harm—three minor kalpas passed, this Jambudvipa one person without learning from others attains second dhyana, from that rising, saying "This born-from-seclusion joy is supreme," all effortlessly hearing, entering equipoise, accomplished, thus light god born, Jambudvipa emptied likewise.

This old man lived through a time of short lifespan! Disease everywhere, war, famine. People lived only ten years. But one person, without teacher, without text, attained second dhyana from solitude alone. This shows: recognition doesn't require long life or good conditions. It requires turning inward.

Body-gods' continent and cattle-enjoyers likewise become. Sound-unheard ones thirty-three born, from great four to Brahma-great likewise.

Vessel destruction: in sky one sun extremely hot, grass-trees burned. Two arisen, rivers-ponds dried. Three arisen, great rivers dried. Four arisen, lakes dried. Five arisen, great ocean dried. Six arisen, great earth with snow-mountains dried. Seven arisen, seven mountains etc. hundred-thousand all burned, from blazing flame swirling, down to golden-ground hell realm, up to Brahma-world blazing, all blazing, thus seven times.

Seven suns and seven blazings—seven fires.

Mountain hermit understood: seven suns are not external stars. They are seven levels of burning—burning attachment, burning aversion, burning ignorance, burning pride, burning jealousy, burning grasping, burning all obscurations. When all seven blaze, what remains? The gold ground of primordial purity.

Then from below-basis clear-dissolving water disturbing, scattering, pervading to second dhyana's extent seven times—like salt-water dissolving in ocean, measureless mansion with, one. That is seven waters.

Then from below-basis wind vajra-cross arising, all scattering, third dhyana below destroyed—sky becomes one.

Essence holder's spacious instruction: fire burns, water dissolves, wind scatters—three phases of purification. But what is purified? Not the nature. The nature is never stained. What is purified is the obscuration, the confusion, the grasping. Three phases, one purification: recognition.

Thus attachment-abiding-destruction after, sky's nature one-empty. That also: from common vehicles likewise, twenty intermediate eons one great eon considered.

Purified: birth-aging-sickness-death four, inner attachment-destruction-empty connected.

From Thalgyur: "Essence destruction and attachment, abiding itself and empty, birth and aging and sickness and death, samsara's wheel itself."

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you cook, while you sweep, remember—this world too will burn. These bodies too will dissolve. But the awareness that knows burning and dissolving—that never burns, never dissolves. Practice now, while conditions allow.

[Final]
Thus the cosmological cycles—creation, abiding, destruction, emptiness. Eons of increase, eons of decrease. Seven fires, seven waters, wind's scattering. All describe the display of dependent origination. All point to what transcends origination.

I's final word on cosmology: Don't get lost in the numbers. Twenty intermediate eons, eighty thousand years, seven suns—fingers pointing. Look at what they indicate. The nature that never increases, never decreases, never burns, never dissolves. Rest there.

Emaho! The wonder of eons passing, worlds burning, all display of awareness's play!
