[1463-1470] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Therefore, the eon cycles follow precise patterns. Decrease from immeasurable to eighty-thousand, two-hundred years each decrement. Then from eighty-thousand to ten, hundred-by-hundred. This is not arbitrary but reflects the dissipation of collective merit. Each reduction in lifespan corresponds to an increase in affliction.

[1463-1470] Voice 13 (Patrul): The lifespan decreases over time. From immeasurable to eighty-thousand years. Each decrement takes two hundred years. Then from eighty-thousand to ten, decreasing by hundreds. The decrease reflects the dissipation of collective merit. More affliction, shorter life.

[1463-1470] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Decrease. Increase. Time. The lifespan decreases. The affliction increases. The eons follow precise patterns.

[1471-1480] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The reversal occurs when beings abandon the ten non-virtues. Each abandonment produces a specific increase: twenty from abandoning killing, forty from abandoning stealing, up to eighty-thousand from abandoning wrong dharma practice. This is a precise calculus of virtue—cause and effect measured in years of life.

[1471-1480] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Ten non-virtues to abandon. Killing, stealing, wrong conduct—each produces increase in lifespan. Twenty years from non-killing, forty from non-stealing, up to eighty-thousand from right dharma practice. The cause and effect is precise.

[1481-1490] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The eighteen intermediate gaps—decrease-and-increase cycles—represent the oscillation of collective karma. Not a linear progression but a wave pattern. The system stabilizes, destabilizes, restabilizes. This continues until the final destruction.

[1481-1490] Voice 13 (Patrul): Eighteen intermediate gaps—oscillation of collective karma. Not linear—wave pattern. Stabilizes, destabilizes, restabilizes. Continues until final destruction.

[1491-1500] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The destruction proceeds through twenty intermediate eons. Nineteen destroy the essence—beings. One destroys the vessel—the world itself. This is not violence but transformation. Like a dream ending, the dreamer wakes. The destruction is not an external event but the exhaustion of collective projection.

[1491-1500] Voice 04 (Padmasambhava): Twenty intermediate eons. Nineteen destroy beings, one destroys world. Not violence—transformation. Dream ending—the dreamer wakes. Not external—collective projection exhausted.

[1501-1510] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Seven suns arise, each progressively hotter. The sequence is precise: grass and trees burn, rivers dry, great rivers dry, lakes dry, ocean dries, land burns, mountains burn. Seven fires. The mathematical progression mirrors the intensification of affliction that precedes awakening.

[1501-1510] Voice 13 (Patrul): Seven suns. Each hotter than before. First—grass and trees burn. Second—rivers dry. Third—great rivers dry. Fourth—lakes dry. Fifth—ocean dries. Sixth—land burns. Seventh—mountains burn. Seven fires, progressive intensification.

[1511-1520] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Then water from below dissolves what fire could not touch. Seven levels of water, dissolving to progressively subtler states. Then wind from below scatters even the water. Seven levels of wind. The sequence—fire, water, wind—corresponds to the three stages of dissolution in death and meditation.

[1511-1520] Voice 20 (Lion-Faces): Fire cannot touch everything—water dissolves. Water cannot hold everything—wind scatters. Three stages: fire, water, wind. Dissolution in death. Dissolution in meditation. Three stages of the end.

[1521-1530] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The wanderer watches this from his cave. He sees the calculations, the precise numbers, the elaborate architecture. He laughs. Eons come and go like breath. Worlds arise and dissolve like thoughts. You worry about when it will end. It ends now. It begins now. There is no difference.

[1521-1530] Voice 13 (Patrul): The wanderer watches from his cave. Calculations, precise numbers, elaborate architecture. Eons like breath. Worlds like thoughts. When will it end? It ends now. Begins now. No difference.

[1531-1540] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): DROLO SUDDENLY APPEARS. Thunder without clouds. THE DESTRUCTION IS HAPPENING NOW. Your world is already burning. Your oceans are already dry. You are already scattered by wind. Why wait? The eon does not end in time. Time ends in the eon. Recognition is freedom.

[1531-1540] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Now. Burning. Free. Destruction happening now. World burning now. Oceans dry now. Wind scattering now. Why wait? Recognition is immediate.

[1541-1550] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): One hundred eighty intermediate eons constitute the great eon. This is the time it takes for collective consciousness to complete one full cycle: arising, abiding, dissolving, empty. Then arising again. The wheel turns. But the one who knows the wheel is the axle. The axle does not turn. You are the axle. You have always been the axle.

[1541-1550] Voice 13 (Patrul): One hundred eighty intermediate eons—the great eon. Collective consciousness completes cycle: arising, abiding, dissolving, empty. Arises again. Wheel turns. But the knower of wheel is axle. Axle doesn't turn. You are the axle.

[1551-1560] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): An old practitioner once calculated the exact moment of the eon's end. He studied for years, cross-referencing texts. The day he finished his calculations, a child asked him: "What time is it now?" He could not answer. The present moment had destroyed all his mathematics.

[1551-1560] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Calculating the eon's end—years of study. Cross-referencing texts. Finished calculations. Child asks: "What time is it now?" Cannot answer. Present moment destroys all mathematics.

[1561-1570] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Look. It is here. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual. Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to. The finger and moon are one in recognition.

[1561-1570] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Here. Now. Recognition. The liberation is immediate, not gradual. Not in the future—now. Not elsewhere—here.

[Final] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The eons follow precise patterns: lifespan decreases from immeasurable to eighty-thousand years, then to ten, by two-hundred year decrements, then by hundreds. The reversal—abandoning ten non-virtues—produces specific increases: twenty years from non-killing, forty from non-stealing, up to eighty-thousand from right dharma. Eighteen intermediate gaps—oscillation of collective karma, wave pattern, stabilization and destabilization. The destruction: twenty intermediate eons, nineteen destroy beings, one destroys world. Seven suns: grass and trees burn, rivers dry, great rivers dry, lakes dry, ocean dries, land burns, mountains burn. Then seven waters dissolve, seven winds scatter. The three stages—fire, water, wind—mirror dissolution in death and meditation. One hundred eighty intermediate eons constitute the great eon. The wheel turns—arising, abiding, dissolving, empty. But the knower of the wheel is the axle. The axle doesn't turn. You are the axle. The eon ends now, begins now—no difference. The calculations are vast but the recognition is immediate. The destruction is happening now. Your world is burning. Your oceans are dry. The wind is scattering. Why wait for some future end? Recognition frees now. The present moment destroys all calculations. Look—it's here. It's now. The lifespan decreases in precise stages: first from immeasurable to eighty-thousand years, each decrement taking two hundred years. Then from eighty-thousand to ten, decreasing by hundreds each time. The decrease reflects the dissipation of collective merit as beings generate more negative karma. The lifespan shortens, the affliction increases. The reversal comes through abandoning the ten non-virtues: abandoning killing adds twenty years, abandoning stealing adds forty, wrong conduct adds sixty, lying adds eighty, divisive speech adds one hundred, harsh speech adds one hundred twenty, gossip adds one hundred sixty, coveting adds two hundred, malice adds two hundred forty, wrong view adds eighty thousand. The mathematics of virtue and vice are precise. The eighteen intermediate gaps represent the oscillation of collective karma—stabilization, destabilization, restabilization in wave patterns. The system continues until final destruction. The destruction proceeds through twenty intermediate eons. Nineteen destroy the essence—beings. One destroys the vessel—the world itself. This is transformation, not violence. Like a dream ending, the dreamer wakes. Not external event but exhaustion of collective projection. Seven suns arise, each progressively hotter: first burns grass and trees, second dries rivers, third dries great rivers, fourth dries lakes, fifth dries ocean, sixth burns land, seventh burns mountains. The seven fires mirror the intensification of affliction before awakening. Then water from below dissolves what fire could not touch—seven levels of water dissolving to progressively subtler states. Then wind from below scatters the water—seven levels of wind. The sequence fire, water, wind corresponds to three stages of dissolution in death and meditation. One hundred eighty intermediate eons constitute the great eon—the time for collective consciousness to complete one full cycle: arising, abiding, dissolving, empty. Then arising again. The wheel turns. But the one who knows the wheel is the axle. The axle does not turn. You are the axle. You have always been the axle. The wanderer watches from his cave—the calculations, precise numbers, elaborate architecture. He laughs. Eons come and go like breath. Worlds arise and dissolve like thoughts. You worry about when it will end. It ends now. It begins now. There is no difference. The destruction is happening now. Your world is already burning. Your oceans are already dry. You are already scattered by wind. Why wait? The eon does not end in time. Time ends in the eon. Recognition is freedom. An old practitioner calculated the exact moment of the eon's end—years of study, cross-referencing texts. The day he finished, a child asked: "What time is it now?" He could not answer. The present moment destroyed all his mathematics. The reversal occurs when beings abandon the ten non-virtues. Each abandonment produces a specific increase: twenty from abandoning killing, forty from abandoning stealing, sixty from abandoning wrong conduct, eighty from abandoning lying, one hundred from abandoning divisive speech, one hundred twenty from abandoning harsh speech, one hundred sixty from abandoning gossip, two hundred from abandoning coveting, two hundred forty from abandoning malice, eighty thousand from abandoning wrong view. This is precise cause and effect measured in years of life.

Emaho! The seven suns! The seven waters! The seven winds! The one hundred eighty eons!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
