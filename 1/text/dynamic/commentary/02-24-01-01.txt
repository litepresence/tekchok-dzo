From Great Self-Arising Tantra: "Here east world's realm in. Field Joyous called exists. Emanation body field there. Emanation body Vajra Being called. Tathagatas all empowerment given and obtained place there. Palace qualities countless exists. That also thus: Jewel crystal made house four doors possessing"

—your inheritance from the beginning. Not received from a guru, not achieved through practice, not found in scriptures. Like a mute tasting sweetness, you know it directly without words.

. The treasure was always in the open, only overlooked.

The space between is not empty—it is recognition itself.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Emaho!

My heart-sons and daughters, this completes the profound instructions on the completion stage of Dzogchen! Recognition is immediate.

The chest was always empty and full—entire from the origin.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The text describes the five Buddha realms and the central wrathful realm where even those with dull faculties can attain liberation. These are not mythological locations but the natural display of enlightened mind. When recognition occurs in the bardo, one naturally abides in these pure fields.

The key point throughout all these teachings is recognition (ngo shes). Whether you are:
- A practitioner with sharp faculties who recognizes instantly in the clear light
- A medium practitioner who works through the four wisdom preparations
- Or a dull faculty practitioner who needs to reach the natural emanation fields

The text points beyond itself pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition dawns in the gaps—the intervals between.

All can attain liberation if they recognize the nature (rang bzhin) of their own mind!

The "shooting star" analogy appears throughout—the sudden flash of recognition that liberates instantly. Don't think you need eons of practice. An instant of pure recognition is enough.

The twenty-one faculties represent the full spectrum of sentient beings' capacities. Whichever describes you, there is a path. The teachings are exhaustive so that no one is left out.

Remember:
1. All appearances are your own display (rang snang)
2. Recognition liberates (ngo shes grol)
3. No recognition, wandering continues (ma ngo 'khyams)
4. The nature is originally pure (ka dag)
5. The display is spontaneously accomplished (lhun grub)

Train now in recognizing the nature (rang bzhin) of mind in this life. Familiarize yourself with the clear light in meditation and sleep. Then when death comes, you will recognize the clear light of death as your own nature, and liberation is certain.

This completes the commentary on Volume 2, pages 321-370, covering the bardo teachings, the spontaneously accomplished visions, the four wisdom preparations, clairvoyance, and the natural emanation pure fields.

May all beings recognize their own nature and attain liberation!

Emaho!

! Not elsewhere: the nature is here—it is this very awareness.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The path is the ground seen clearly.

With steps and windows, four great opening windows in four directions! From opening windows sun arises, striking jewel crystal made, inside daytime five lights' appearance free! Outside rim of that celestial palace, eight-limbed water moat exists!

Water that by drinking heals disease! Outside rim eight lakes exist, inside various sweet bird voices! Bird king swan gold-possessing, black-neck, bya-ka-ti, ne-tsho knowing human voice, cuckoo, shang-shang-te'u, re-skegs - thousand hundred sweet-voiced bird kinds!

Emaho!

, not adding anything new, not creating anything artificial—merely pointing out what has always been your own face. Look, fortunate one, and recognize!

Emaho!

—pages 251 through 300, covering the signs of the path, the four visions of thodgal, spontaneous liberation, and the nature (rang bzhin) of dharmata. Rest in this understanding.

Complexity is simplicity wearing a mask—before analysis, already complete.

The trail is the terrain.

Remember

! Those four middle bell tinkling net thread connected! Thread wind moved, bell sound pleasant various emerge!

Between one thought and another—awareness meeting itself.

Understanding undoes the understander—self-liberation of grasping.

Direction four silk various banner four exist! Wind moved fragrance pleasant various emerge! Palace measure this from east direction league five hundred beyond above exists! There born bodhisattvas thirty-three gods enjoyment equal!

East direction emanation body field realm thus exists! From here south direction glory possessing field realm emanation body dwelling place there! Jewel gold made house four-cornered balcony possessing, door four horse-projection possessing, corner four stupa possessing!

From here north direction world realm, dear practitioner! Thus in four directions, four emanation body field realms exist with immeasurable qualities! Each with its own particular excellence, yet all displaying the same Buddha activity!

Do not think these are merely stories! These are real fields of pure appearance, where practitioners who have purified their perception will take birth! Through the power of devotion and practice, you too can obtain such a birth!

Emaho!

: these teachings are not for mere intellectual understanding. Like a recipe for food, the words are useless unless put into practice. Meditate on the thigle; recognize the four lamps; rest in dharmata's natural state. This is the only way.

The signs described

—relics, lights, sounds, earth-shaking—are not fantasies or exaggerations. When awareness truly recognizes itself, the elements respond. Like a magnet affecting iron filings, pure awareness naturally purifies the material body.

Do not seek these signs

! There also emanation body Meaningful Accomplishment called field realm, palace measure such qualities!

No key needed for an unlocked door—not made, so not unmade.

No lid to lift—complete from the first.

Jewel indranila made house four-cornered possessing exists! Direction four great windows four exist! From there sun rising, light green inside filled! Ground all indranila made!

Field realm food thirst mind memory mere satisfying! From there phlegm produced, wind produced, bile produced, combination produced disease not exist!

Emaho!

as goals in themselves. They are byproducts of recognition, like flowers that bloom when spring arrives. Focus on the root: stable confidence in the natural state. Everything else follows naturally.

The bardo instructions

are your insurance policy for death. Practice them now while alive; then at death they will arise spontaneously. Like a trained dancer whose body remembers the steps, your mind will remember dharmata.

! Field realm food and thirst mind memory mere satisfying!

Longchenpa indicates what words cannot reach pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The filter is filtered—seeing this is the teaching.

No phlegm-produced, wind-produced, bile-produced, combination-produced diseases exist! Flower various emanation body worship extensive doing merely! Bodhisattvas those color green merely, horse and mount green merely, boy and girl form appearance merely!

All mind aspect thought not exist! Field realm sentient being type three not exist! Sense-base six not exist! Affliction six not exist! Ignorance not exist! Condition four possessing not exist! Ignorance similar possessing mind not exist!

Field realm those front space emanation body wrathful field realm exists! Thus in all ten directions, Buddha fields beyond measure exist for the benefit of sentient beings! Do not think this is mere imagination!

These are the actual display of Dharmakaya's compassionate activity! Through purification of your own mind, you will see such realms directly! Practice with diligence, dear one, and you too will abide in such fields!

Emaho!

: Do not waste this precious human life in distraction and worldly pursuits. The signs of death approach like a mountain's shadow at sunset—inexorable and swift. Practice now, liberate now, be free!

Emaho!

Listen! There is a great charnel ground called Blazing Ye Mountain. It has a measureless palace like this: A skull house four stories high. It is thus: Dry skulls as fruit, flesh and blood as walls, intestines with veins as roof. Measures and height immeasurable. Thunderbolt nails. Rakta as gutter water. Sun and moon as seats. Crocodile mouth as door frame. Eight great gods as pillars. Great supreme foundation. Daytime, wind swirls. Nighttime, fire blazes. Four corners of that palace, great field's canopy spread. Five goddesses dancing. All ground, rakta's waves swirling.

Inside that palace, Bhagavan Youthful Hero Powerful, mind unmoving from peace, yet body shown in wrathful aspect. Surrounded by dakinis and immeasurable wrathful gatherings. Thus: Dakini Purna Nyebar Zhiba, Brahma Dung Ngri Can, Rishi Moonlight Youth, and surrounding dakinis Ekajati six sisters, fourteen servant women, fifty-eight assistant women, and assistants hundred-thousand ten-thousand, etc., surrounded by immeasurable dakini retinue.

From Bhagavan's mind emanated retinue, Vajra Holder in hand, etc., surrounded by immeasurable wrathful retinue. Garab Dorje, etc., surrounded by immeasurable human retinue. Turning result Secret Mantra unsurpassed Dharma wheel to retinue, peaceful emanation body bodhisattvas liberated. All have wrathful frowning faces.

That palace is extremely vast. Those faculties' end persons.

Emaho! Don't be shocked by these terrifying images! This is describing the fierce aspect of wisdom—the energy that cuts through delusion. The charnel ground isn't a place—it's the recognition that all appearances are impermanent, all concepts dead. The wrathful deities aren't enemies—they're your own awareness in its most powerful form!

Listen! Astonished and amazed, born into emanation body's field realms, merely so it is said. These too, from Bhagavan Vajra Holder's blessings, naturally arranged, therefore called "nature emanation fields." Those fields' continuities—from heart's mirror-like etc., pristine awareness jewel self-clear self-radiance, and in skull house, wrathful mandala, primordially abiding appearance, arise. Appearance to retinue, faculties' objects seen capable cause, and liberation certain cause, should be known as that.

### From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle
From Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod: "Faculties' end ones, nature emanation body field, exhaling breath—twenty-fourth chapter." Having extensively explained ground and path stages of Secret Supreme certain liberation through crucial points, now ascertaining where accomplished by that method, perfected ultimate result stage in two: General presentation of manifestly awakening in internal expanse primordially pure ground. Specifically explaining appearance-modes of body and pristine awareness from spontaneously accomplished luminous clarity ground-appearance.

First has three: Held by liberation place's essence. Explained separately nature of how liberated. Ascertaining body and pristine awareness ground-appearance. First: Self-arisen awareness naturally pure, pure by all adventitious stains, two purities possessed Dharmakaya, non-dual expanse and pristine awareness primordially pure jewel secret womb is ultimate liberation place.

From Self-Arising Awareness: "Liberation place is primordially pure appearance. Like vase body example." "All Buddhas' deliverance place is primordially pure great mandala." From Jewel Heap: "Result Dharmakaya emptiness, entities exhausted, very wonderful."

This is the completion ground! Every being has this nature—just obscured. Liberation isn't going somewhere else—it's recognizing what's always been. Like realizing you've been wearing glasses your whole life!
