[1-360]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Emaho!

[1-360]
My heart-sons and daughters, this completes the profound instructions on the completion stage of Dzogchen! Recognition is immediate.

THUNDER! Treasury blazes! Was never closed! Sudden recognition! NOW!

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The text describes the five Buddha realms and the central wrathful realm where even those with dull faculties can attain liberation. These are not mythological locations but the natural display of enlightened mind. When recognition occurs in the bardo, one naturally abides in these pure fields.

The key point throughout all these teachings is recognition (ngo shes). Whether you are:
- A practitioner with sharp faculties who recognizes instantly in the clear light
- A medium practitioner who works through the four wisdom preparations
- Or a dull faculty practitioner who needs to reach the natural emanation fields

All can attain liberation if they recognize the nature (rang bzhin) of their own mind!

The "shooting star" analogy appears throughout—the sudden flash of recognition that liberates instantly. Don't think you need eons of practice. An instant of pure recognition is enough.

The twenty-one faculties represent the full spectrum of sentient beings' capacities. Whichever describes you, there is a path. The teachings are exhaustive so that no one is left out.

Remember:
1. All appearances are your own display (rang snang)
2. Recognition liberates (ngo shes grol)
3. No recognition, wandering continues (ma ngo 'khyams)
4. The nature is originally pure (ka dag)
5. The display is spontaneously accomplished (lhun grub)

Train now in recognizing the nature (rang bzhin) of mind in this life. Familiarize yourself with the clear light in meditation and sleep. Then when death comes, you will recognize the clear light of death as your own nature, and liberation is certain.

This completes the commentary on Volume 2, pages 321-370, covering the bardo teachings, the spontaneously accomplished visions, the four wisdom preparations, clairvoyance, and the natural emanation pure fields.

May all beings recognize their own nature and attain liberation!

Emaho!

[1-360]
! The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

I mapped all paths. Then forgot: the ground was never mapped. Never departed from.

With steps and windows, four great opening windows in four directions! From opening windows sun arises, striking jewel crystal made, inside daytime five lights' appearance free! Outside rim of that celestial palace, eight-limbed water moat exists!

Water that by drinking heals disease! Outside rim eight lakes exist, inside various sweet bird voices! Bird king swan gold-possessing, black-neck, bya-ka-ti, ne-tsho knowing human voice, cuckoo, shang-shang-te'u, re-skegs - thousand hundred sweet-voiced bird kinds!

Mind-pleasing bird kinds like kang-ka-ri, sba-ba, zer-mo, divine bird bell voice possessing, bya-kri-ti-pa gold vajra form! Turquoise-like blue, conch-like white, coral-like red, indranila-like green - mind-pleasing, sweet-voiced, thought immeasurable!

Thus seven days each, Dharma session four-four arises! There abiding bodhisattvas birth one obstructed merely, life five hundred fifty sustaining! Field realm from exhaustion and thirst mind memory mere satisfying!

Without weariness, supreme bliss within! Water eight-limbed drinking cleanses! Flower various emanation body worship great doing! Palace measure corner four pearl-made stupa four exist!

Emaho!

[1-360]
, not adding anything new, not creating anything artificial—merely pointing out what has always been your own face. Look, fortunate one, and recognize!

Emaho!

[1-360]
—pages 251 through 300, covering the signs of the path, the four visions of thodgal, spontaneous liberation, and the nature (rang bzhin) of dharmata. Rest in this understanding.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Path is ground. Never walked.

Remember

[1-360]
! Those four middle bell tinkling net thread connected! Thread wind moved, bell sound pleasant various emerge!

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Direction four silk various banner four exist! Wind moved fragrance pleasant various emerge! Palace measure this from east direction league five hundred beyond above exists! There born bodhisattvas thirty-three gods enjoyment equal!

East direction emanation body field realm thus exists! From here south direction glory possessing field realm emanation body dwelling place there! Jewel gold made house four-cornered balcony possessing, door four horse-projection possessing, corner four stupa possessing!

Do not think these are merely stories! These are real fields of pure appearance, where practitioners who have purified their perception will take birth! Through the power of devotion and practice, you too can obtain such a birth!

Emaho!

[1-360]
: these teachings are not for mere intellectual understanding. Words without practice are recipes without cooking—useless. Meditate on the thigle; recognize the four lamps; rest in dharmata's natural state. This is the only way.

The signs described

[1-360]
—relics, lights, sounds, earth-shaking—are not fantasies or exaggerations. When awareness truly recognizes itself, the elements respond. Pure awareness naturally purifies the material body, magnet-like drawing the elements into alignment.

Do not seek these signs

[1-360]
! There also emanation body Meaningful Accomplishment called field realm, palace measure such qualities!

ROAR! Treasury complete! Never closed! Cut through seeking! NOW!

No process needed. No gradual opening. Immediate access to what was always present.

Field realm food thirst mind memory mere satisfying! From there phlegm produced, wind produced, bile produced, combination produced disease not exist!

Emaho!

[1-360]
as goals in themselves. They are byproducts of recognition, like flowers that bloom when spring arrives. Focus on the root: stable confidence in the natural state. Everything else follows naturally.

The bardo instructions

[1-360]
are your insurance policy for death. Practice them now while alive; then at death they will arise spontaneously. Your mind will remember dharmata, dancer-like—the body knowing steps the conscious mind forgets.

[1-360]
! Field realm food and thirst mind memory mere satisfying!

THUNDER! Sudden! The distinction-maker liberated in wrathful compassion! Obstacles become the path! NOW!

No phlegm-produced, wind-produced, bile-produced, combination-produced diseases exist! Flower various emanation body worship extensive doing merely! Bodhisattvas those color green merely, horse and mount green merely, boy and girl form appearance merely!

Qualities limit not exist thus exist! Palace measure this from north direction league five hundred above exists! There born bodhisattvas form realm gods enjoyment equal! North direction emanation body field realm thus exists!

Field realm those front space emanation body wrathful field realm exists! Thus in all ten directions, Buddha fields beyond measure exist for the benefit of sentient beings! Do not think this is mere imagination!

These are the actual display of Dharmakaya's compassionate activity! Through purification of your own mind, you will see such realms directly! Practice with diligence, dear one, and you too will abide in such fields!

Emaho!

[1-360]
: Do not waste this precious human life in distraction and worldly pursuits. The signs of death approach like a mountain's shadow at sunset—inexorable and swift. Practice now, liberate now, be free!

Emaho!

[1-360]
Listen! There is a great charnel ground called Blazing Ye Mountain. It has a measureless palace like this: A skull house four stories high. It is thus: Dry skulls as fruit, flesh and blood as walls, intestines with veins as roof. Measures and height immeasurable. Thunderbolt nails. Rakta as gutter water. Sun and moon as seats. Crocodile mouth as door frame. Eight great gods as pillars. Great supreme foundation. Daytime, wind swirls. Nighttime, fire blazes. Four corners of that palace, great field's canopy spread. Five goddesses dancing. All ground, rakta's waves swirling.

Inside that palace, Bhagavan Youthful Hero Powerful, mind unmoving from peace, yet body shown in wrathful aspect. Surrounded by dakinis and immeasurable wrathful gatherings. Thus: Dakini Purna Nyebar Zhiba, Brahma Dung Ngri Can, Rishi Moonlight Youth, and surrounding dakinis Ekajati six sisters, fourteen servant women, fifty-eight assistant women, and assistants hundred-thousand ten-thousand, etc., surrounded by immeasurable dakini retinue.

From Bhagavan's mind emanated retinue, Vajra Holder in hand, etc., surrounded by immeasurable wrathful retinue. Garab Dorje, etc., surrounded by immeasurable human retinue. Turning result Secret Mantra unsurpassed Dharma wheel to retinue, peaceful emanation body bodhisattvas liberated. All have wrathful frowning faces.

That palace is extremely vast. Those faculties' end persons.

Emaho! Don't be shocked by these terrifying images! This is describing the fierce aspect of wisdom—the energy that cuts through delusion. The charnel ground isn't a place—it's the recognition that all appearances are impermanent, all concepts dead. The wrathful deities aren't enemies—they're your own awareness in its most powerful form!

[1-360]
Listen! Astonished and amazed, born into emanation body's field realms, merely so it is said. These too, from Bhagavan Vajra Holder's blessings, naturally arranged, therefore called "nature emanation fields." Those fields' continuities—from heart's mirror-like etc., pristine awareness jewel self-clear self-radiance, and in skull house, wrathful mandala, primordially abiding appearance, arise. Appearance to retinue, faculties' objects seen capable cause, and liberation certain cause, should be known as that.

### From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle
From Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod: "Faculties' end ones, nature emanation body field, exhaling breath—twenty-fourth chapter." Having extensively explained ground and path stages of Secret Supreme certain liberation through key points, now ascertaining where accomplished by that method, perfected ultimate result stage in two: General presentation of manifestly awakening in internal expanse primordially pure ground. Specifically explaining appearance-modes of body and pristine awareness from spontaneously accomplished luminous clarity ground-appearance.

First has three: Held by liberation place's essence. Explained separately nature of how liberated. Ascertaining body and pristine awareness ground-appearance. First: Self-arisen awareness naturally pure, pure by all adventitious stains, two purities possessed Dharmakaya, non-dual expanse and pristine awareness primordially pure jewel secret womb is ultimate liberation place.

From Self-Arising Awareness: "Liberation place is primordially pure appearance. Like vase body example." "All Buddhas' deliverance place is primordially pure great mandala." From Jewel Heap: "Result Dharmakaya emptiness, entities exhausted, very wonderful."

This is the completion ground! Every being has this nature—just obscured. Liberation isn't going somewhere else—it's recognizing what's always been. Like realizing you've been wearing glasses your whole life!
