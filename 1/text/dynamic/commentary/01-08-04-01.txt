Consequently. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

This yogi. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[10722-10723]
Between one and many, the vast middle way opens like a lotus at dawn. The single basis does not fragment into plurality like a mirror shattering. The manifold appearances do not coalesce into singularity like rivers merging into sea. Each appearance is complete, each contains the whole, yet none are separate from the basis. This is the great mystery of spontaneous presence within primordial purity.

[10723-10726]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: To assert multiplicity as the basis brings its own ruin! If consciousness is momentary, the basis becomes momentary—arising and ceasing like lightning flashes. If consciousness holds many thoughts, the basis fragments into a thousand shards. If consciousness is afflicted by conditions, the basis becomes stained and impure. This is the trap of identifying basis with conditioned mind!

[10724-10726]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what binds What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. Rest in this understanding.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[10726-10729]
Thus established. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[10727-10729]
This old hermit has seen ants trying to carry the mountain. Those who claim the basis is many are like those who see the forest but miss the single earth from which all trees grow. The six consciousnesses are waves on the ocean of rigpa—distinct in appearance, one in essence. To mistake the waves for the ocean itself is the great error of philosophers.

[10729-10734]
The basis cannot be held as a single expanse because it is an assembly of many—this is the final contradiction of the seventh position. From the Six Expanses tantra, the Teacher spoke scattered above, his words like autumn leaves drifting on the wind. This too, because it does not accord with any side, whose essence is that appearance.

[10733-10741]
Between scattered and gathered, the vast middle way opens like space itself. The seven positions are seven attempts to capture the sky in a net. The result different, yet that meaning similar—each position finds its own destruction. Because deterioration comes through many sounds, the words themselves become obstacles. Are not these knowable dharmas? What was spoken is just like that.

[10742-10746]
Voice 20 proclaims: The primordial wisdom of self-arisen awareness, being free from the extremes of existence and non-existence, is not established merely as primordial wisdom! One holds that from the aspect of the great bindu free from elaborations, it is not established anywhere. But this too falls into error!

[10746-10750]
The framework reveals. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[10750-10754]
From the Six Expanses: Because the essence itself is primordially pure, sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted. This is similar to the previous six bases—all positions dissolve in the light of recognition.

[10755-10756]
Third: establishing the non-dual basis of primordial purity and spontaneous presence as one's own system. This is the path of Great Perfection, beyond the seven extremes. Not one, not many, not both, not neither—the basis transcends all logical categories while remaining the foundation of all appearance.

[10757-10765]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Enough with positions! The seventh position—that primordial wisdom is not established—is itself a position! The Great Perfection is not an eighth position but the dissolution of all positions. Stop counting! Start recognizing!

[10760-10770]
Analysis proceeds.
 The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.
