First—various appearances, single basis. Fault of manifesting as variety. The mind sees multiplicity where there is unity. The single basis appears as many, and we grasp at the many, missing the one.

A hilltop meditator... once tried to eliminate multiplicity. He sought the one behind the many, the unity beyond diversity. He failed. Not because multiplicity is real, but because grasping at unity is the same error as grasping at diversity. The fault is not in the variety—the fault is in the grasping.
