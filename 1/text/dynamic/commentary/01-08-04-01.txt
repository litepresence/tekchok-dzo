First—various appearances, single basis. Fault of manifesting as variety. The mind sees multiplicity where there is unity. The single basis appears as many, and we grasp at the many, missing the one.

A hilltop meditator... once tried to eliminate multiplicity. He sought the one behind the many, the unity beyond diversity. He failed. Not because multiplicity is real, but because grasping at unity is the same error as grasping at diversity. The fault is not in the variety—the fault is in the grasping.

Sought to eliminate multiplicity. Failed. Fault is grasping, not variety. Like trying to smooth the surface of water by pressing it—the ripples multiply. The attempt to eliminate creates more elaboration.

Mountain hermit watched clouds form and dissolve in the valley sky. Each cloud different—shape, size, color. Yet all were sky. He didn't need to eliminate the clouds to see the sky. He just stopped focusing on the clouds.

Stop. Look. Know.

Between the variety of appearances and the unity of the basis, we find the middle way. Not one, not many. Both one and many. Neither one nor many. This is the Great Perfection view.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why struggle with one and many? The basis is present in every appearance! Multiplicity is the basis playing! Stop analyzing and recognize!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you see the many flowers in the meadow, while you see the single earth that holds them, remember—neither eliminates the other. Both are true. Both are empty.

Final instruction: the fault is not that appearances are multiple. The fault is grasping at multiplicity or grasping at unity. See through both. Rest in what sees. That is the single basis—not found, not lost, never absent.

Emaho! The wonder of various appearances from a single basis, neither one nor many, spontaneously perfect.
