[5923-5924] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Eighth—the Immovable Ground obtained. In the progressive path of the bodhisattva, this marks the transition from effortful to effortless, from accumulation to spontaneous expression. The eighth ground is called "unmoving" not because nothing happens but because nothing can disturb the recognition of nature. Like a mountain that remains steady whether storms rage or sunlight bathes its peak—unmoving in essence, yet continuing to manifest.

[5923-5924] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old practitioner once met a monk who had memorized all ten grounds. He could recite their names, their qualities, the practices of each. "But," this fool asked him, "which ground are you on now?" The monk fell silent. You see, the grounds are not rungs on a ladder to climb—they are descriptions of recognition from different angles. The eighth ground does not come after the seventh. It is the recognition that grounds themselves are the play of awareness.

[5923-5924] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Moving. Unmoving. Same. See what is. The ground that moves and the ground that does not move—both are awareness's display. Decide without doubt: there is no ground to obtain, no ground to traverse. Commit utterly to this recognition. Come back to this again and again. The eighth ground is every ground. Every ground is this ground.

[5923-5924] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Immovable ground! Perfection of qualities! Attainment! All concepts! Cut through them—can you find the ground that moves? Can you grasp the quality that perfects? The moving and unmoving are one nature. The perfect and imperfect are one display. See through the attainment and FIND WHAT WAS NEVER LOST!

[5923-5924] Voice 05 (Mipham): Philosophically, the ten grounds (bhūmi) present the progressive purification of adventitious obscurations. The eighth ground, Acalā (Immovable), represents the irreversibility of realization—henceforth, delusion cannot regain dominance. However, from the Dzogchen perspective, these grounds describe recognition itself, not a temporal progression. The "attainment" is not an achievement but the exhaustion of seeking achievement. The perfection of qualities is not accumulation but recognition of spontaneously present perfection.

[5923-5924] Voice 08 (Integrator): The eighth ground integrates effort and effortlessness. It integrates the path and the result. It integrates the progressive and the instantaneous. Do not reject the bodhisattva grounds as mere provisional teaching. Do not cling to them as ultimate truth. Rest in the integration where the ground that traverses and the ground that transcends are recognized as one nature.

[5923-5924] Voice 03 (Dakini): I dance on the eighth ground as on all grounds—unmoving in the center yet swirling at the edges. The perfection of qualities? I am adorned with ornaments that were never fabricated. The attainment? I obtained what was never lost. Dance with me, practitioner—through the grounds into the recognition that the dancer and the dance are not two.

[5923-5924] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The essence of the eighth ground: effort drops away. Not because one becomes lazy but because effort and effortlessness are recognized as inseparable. The perfection of qualities is not becoming adorned with new virtues but recognizing the virtues that were never absent. Hold this essence—unmoving like the mountain, complete like the moon.

[5923-5924] Voice 11 (Spontaneity): The eighth ground arises spontaneously—not through planning but through the nature's impulse to recognize itself. The immovable quality is not forced stability but spontaneous steadiness. The excellent qualities perfect themselves when the attempt to perfect drops away. Spontaneity is the ground. The ground is spontaneity.

[5923-5924] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The enumeration of grounds serves those who need progressive path, yet Dzogchen points directly to what the tenth ground realizes: that all grounds were complete from the beginning. The eighth ground's "immovability" is simply the exhaustion of doubt. The perfection of qualities is recognition of spontaneous presence. Not attainment but recognition. Not progress but direct seeing.

[5923-5924] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond has walked through all ten grounds without taking a step. The eighth ground was where he stopped trying to get somewhere. The perfection of qualities was where he recognized he was never lacking. You too are on the eighth ground right now—if you would only stop moving away from it. Rest, practitioner, rest.

[5923-5924] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Final words on grounds. Complete. All. Now. Stop. The eight ground, the tenth ground, the first ground—all complete in this moment. The perfection of qualities is your own face before parents. See it. Resolve it. Rest in it. AH!
