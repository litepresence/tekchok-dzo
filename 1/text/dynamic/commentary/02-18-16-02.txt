[5923-5924] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Eighth, unmoving ground obtained. Then qualities complete.

[5923-5924] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Unmoving. Complete. Stop. The unmoving ground is not achieved. It is recognized. Qualities complete themselves when you stop seeking them.

[Final] The eighth ground—unmoving, complete. Rest here.

Emaho! The unmoving ground!

See what is. Rest in recognition.
