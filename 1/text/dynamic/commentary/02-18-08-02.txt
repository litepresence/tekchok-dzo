[5035-5036] Second, extend session; third, extend duration. The practice of dzogchen is not measured by clock-hours but by the depth of recognition. When you place awareness in the sphere's wall without moving, you enter the dimension where time dissolves into timeless presence.

[5035-5036] This old wanderer sat for days once, trying not to blink, thinking that would make me a great yogi. My legs went numb, my mind went numb, and I learned nothing. It's not about the body staying still. It's about the mind recognizing its own nature.

[5037-5038] See what is. The sphere-wall is not a boundary to cross. It is the mind seeing itself. Look. There is no inside and outside. There never was.

[5037-5038] This very notion of "placing" awareness—look closely. Is there a placer and a placed? The search for the one who places reveals no one placed. The wall you build is the wall that imprisons. The wall that recognizes itself is the wall that liberates.

[5039-5041] Like a mirror reflecting without effort, the vajra-nature of the continuum holds everything in its own display. The lamp blazes from within. The awareness knows its own field, not by going somewhere, but by recognizing it was never elsewhere.

[5042-5048] The fruit: when outer sphere-appearance, eye unmoving, that is the time of self-presence. Inner: awareness rests in the base, self-resonance dissolves, the horse of conceptual wind is freed. Wisdom-sky dissolves into sphere-sky—limitless, equal, classless liberation. Pure rigpa, unmoving in sphere, abides in the nature of luminous clarity.

[5042-5048] Three things happen at once, not one after another. The eye sees without moving—not forced stillness, but natural resting. The wind-horse gallops free of its saddles. The sky dissolves into sky. This is not something you achieve. It is something you discover was always so.

[5049-5051] Three words. Recognize. Release. Rest. That yogin, having captured original dharmata's luminous clarity—samsara's name becomes empty. The three realms are already a corpse. They need no second killing.

[5052-5055] Voice 10): From the (Longchenpa tantra: dharmata's direct main point—know by seeing, realize by that knowing, become liberated by that realization. Liberation is not untying something. It is recognizing there was never a knot.

[5056-5058] Sky in sky—what dissolves into what? Look now. The dissolving itself dissolves. The nature that has no aim, the limitlessness with no part—these are not descriptions of something. They are descriptions of the nothing that is everything.

[5059-5062] Those with the capacity to find the direct—three realms become empty of name, samsara's corpse is cut. Not because something was removed, but because something was recognized. The illusion sees itself and the illusion becomes clear light.

[5063-5069] Second: from experience increasing above vision. The sphere-rigpa trained higher and higher. Outer: sphere-appearance and rigpa are non-dual, like the interdependence of awareness in the sphere's fence. Inner: in primordially pure empty sphere, self-radiance and rigpa-sphere are non-dual, mother and child clear light joining. Experience and vision expand variously.

[5063-5069] Two kinds of experience: knowing-experience and vision-experience. Knowing-experience is worldly—the pleasure of samadhi, the desire for song and dance. Vision-experience goes beyond, empty-clear-beyond, realized through discriminating awareness. They arise together, like three rivers from one snow mountain.

[5070-5075] Experience expands. Wisdom-colors emerge outward. Stand up, wings dawn, various points appear as the body itself, clear in the field of coarse vision. No need to seek. No need to reject. The expansion is natural when grasping ends.

[5076-5084] Extensive explanation: two experiences called "increasing above." Knowing-experience: worldly knowing, happiness from samadhi, mind attracted to song, dance, desire. Transcend knowing-experience—empty, clear, beyond extremes, realized through discriminating awareness. From first, middle, end habituation: three arise—knowing pleasure experience, final transformation experience, and vision experience.

[5076-5084] Look at your own experience. Is it knowing or vision? The desire for pleasure is the trap. The recognition of emptiness is the key. But do not cling to the key either. The three experiences arise from the three times—past, present, future—all dissolved in the one taste of dharmata.

[Final] Extend session, extend duration. Place rigpa in the sphere. The experience expands naturally. Mother and child clear light embrace. The wall becomes the doorway. The doorway was never closed.

Emaho! The increasing experience!

The division dissolves into what was never divided. Recognition completes the circle. What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.  See what is. Rest in recognition.
