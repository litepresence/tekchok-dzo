[5035-5084] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, session increase and duration extend. Third, day-night without practice, sphere's wall rigpa inserted, unmoving do. From Blazing Lamp: "Sphere rigpa's own object does, vajra itself interdependence, this inside place." Result: outer sphere appearance eye unmoving time, inside rigpa basis abides, radiance self-dissolves, conceptual wind's horse free, wisdom's sky sphere's sky dissolves, face-equal class-free liberated.

[5035-5084] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Sphere. Rigpa. Stop. You think you must insert rigpa into the sphere. They were never separate. The wall of the sphere is the boundary of your own mind. Cross it and find there was never a wall.

[5035-5084] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man once tried to extend sessions until I couldn't tell day from night! Fell into a stupor. Then learned—it's not about duration. It's about recognition. A moment of clear recognition is better than hours of dull sitting.

[5063-5084] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, experience increasing appearance: sphere-rigpa higher-higher trained, outer sphere appearance rigpa interdependence non-dual abiding; inner primordially pure empty sphere self-radiance rigpa-sphere non-dual abiding, clear light mother-child join, appearance experience various expand.

[5063-5084] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Experience. Expand. Stop. You think experiences should increase. They expand naturally when you stop grasping. Higher and higher training is not effort. It is recognition deepening.

[Final] Increase sessions, extend duration. Insert rigpa into the sphere. The experience expands naturally. Mother and child clear light embrace.

Emaho! The increasing experience!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
