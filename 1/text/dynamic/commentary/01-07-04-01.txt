[10086-10114] First outer outer—harmful mind abandoning. From Essence Meaning Aspect-Taken Tantra: whoever mantra-holder vajra holder, other or self, if hold harm-doing mind—leprosy-possessed body, cold touch possessing, body thousand-times five taken after, cold hell certain becomes. Supremely mantra entered, harm-doing mind done, above suffering experiences.

Aware. Present. Complete.

They think "I didn't DO anything!" But the mind moved. The thought arose. This old man says—harmful mind is the seed. Action is just the sprout. Cut the seed, no tree. Guard your mind like a fortress.

The vajra holder who thinks harm is like a king carrying a hidden dagger. He looks noble, but the weapon is there. The cold hell is not punishment. It is the natural climate of a cold mind. Warm your mind with compassion, or freeze in your own hatred.

I wanted revenge once. Someone wronged me. The thought burned like fire. Then I saw—he's suffering too. The harmful mind hurt me more than him. Let it go.

Therefore. Thus. Mind samaya first level: phyi'i phyi (outer-outer)—gnod sems spong (harmful mind abandoning). Precise analysis: gnas chen gnod sems (harmful mind) creates the cause for grang dmyal (cold hell). The mechanism: one moment of harmful thought equals five thousand body-takings in future lives.

The mind is the king. Body and speech are servants. If the king is cruel, the kingdom suffers. Make the king kind, and all prospers.

HARMFUL MIND? speaks with fierce compassion The lion's mind has no harm! The lion's mind has no kindness! It just IS! See through the duality of help and harm!

[10099-10130] Outer inner—guru and vajra siblings harmful mind abandoning. From Sky-Iron Fire Blazing Tantra: if common being object, harm mind arises—common body possessing, three hundred life cut, this sin's share equal. Teaching sign holding form, wrong becomes. Mantra entered, hundred-times. Vajra sibling seven-times, lineage guru hundred-times, root guru that one's hundred. Mantra door entered, empowerment obtained, supremely aspect-ripen thus.

Three words. Guru. Sibling. Mind. Stop. Harmful mind toward guru—hundred times worse than toward ordinary beings. Toward vajra siblings—seven times worse. The hierarchy of objects reflects the hierarchy ofStop. Look. Know.feeds you. But worse—hundred times worse.

The guru is the display of your own wisdom. To think harm toward him is to think harm toward enlightenment itself. The lineage guru is the stream of blessing. To dam the stream is to die of thirst. The root guru is the source. To poison the source is to poison yourself.

I got angry at my teacher once. Felt justified. Then I saw—my anger was my own obstacle, not his. He remained calm. I suffered. Who was harmed?

Therefore. Thus. phyi'i nang (outer-inner)—bla ma dang mched lcam la gnod sems spong. Precise analysis: karmic multiplication hierarchy: common being—1x, teaching holder—100x, mantra entered—700x (vajra sibling 7 x 100), lineage guru—100x, root guru—100x. Supremely—empowerment obtained—exponential increase.

See the guru as Buddha. See the sibling as Buddha. Then harmful mind is seen as impossible as the sky being red. The mind rests in recognition.

HIERARCHY? MULTIPLICATION? The heruka sees all beings as equal! One harmful mind is ALL harmful minds! See through the calculation!

[10115-10143] Outer secret—self-other established-view wrong-view arise abandoning. From Great Arrangement: self or other's hidden Dharma disparage, wrong path, root samaya exceeded, earth-dwell fire suffering, long time dwell. Self's established-view wrong-view arise, hell itself liberate chance not. Mind's inner outer—conduct, inner—meditate, secret—wrong view abandoning. From Crystal House Stacked Tantra: view, meditate, conduct wrong—path wrong great, beings all's suffering this mind ripen certain.

Three words. Wrong. View. Stop. The outer secret—don't disparage others' paths. The inner—don't confuse meditation methods. The secret—don't abandon right view. Wrong view is the root of all harm. Cut it, and the tree falls.

They say "My view is higher!" This old man says—all views are ladders. The rung you're on seems highest until you climb higher. Don't kick away the ladder that brought you up. Don't disparage the path that others walk.

The established See clearly. Recognize fully. Rest completely.
I thought my way was the only way. Then I met a hermit who never heard of Buddha. His mind was pure. His view? Simple kindness. I learned—view is in the living, not the labeling.

Therefore. Thus. phyi'i gsang (outer-secret)—rang gzhan gyi grub mtha' la log lta (self-other's established-view wrong-view). nang gi gsum (inner's three): spyod pa (conduct), bsgom pa (meditate), lta ba (view). Precise analysis: log lam (wrong path) results from reversing these three.

The right view is no view. The wrong view is any view grasped. Let views arise and dissolve like breath. Don't hold, don't push.

VIEW? NO VIEW? speaks with fierce compassion See through the viewer! The lion has no view! The lion SEES! See through wrong and right!

[10134-10178] Secret's three outer—view, meditate, conduct. Inner—yi-dam deity. Secret—guru and vajra siblings day-night mind done. From Lotus Klong Tantra: whoever mind's karma wander, mind done dharmas, mind not-done degenerate, past ceased karma's end, uninterrupted suffering experiences. From Co-Arisen Near-Taken Tantra: actual-accomplish supreme desire, yi-dam abandon not, guru abandon actual-accomplish destroyed, other where accomplish not find. Therefore Dharma promise taken, guru's before samaya pledged, mind thought virtue's karma—self abandon actual-accomplish degenerates.

Three words. Mind. Done. Secret. Stop. The secret of secrets—what you think day and night about guru and sangha. This is the deepest samaya. Let your mind be Buddha-mind, and all is complete. Let it be ordinary mind, and accomplishment dissolves.

They practice during sessions, forget between. I sat in retreat once... says—the secret samaya is ALL THE TIME! Day and night, awake and dream, keep the guru in your mind. Not as burden—as recognition.

The yi-dam is your own enlightened form. The guru is your own enlightened mind. To think of them with degenerate mind is to dissolve your own Buddhahood. The promise taken is the promise to recognize.
Look. Recognize. Rest. (view, meditate, conduct), nang—yi dam gyi lha (yi-dam deity), gsang—bla ma dang mched lcam (guru and siblings). Precise analysis: yid kyi las 'khyal (mind's karma wandering) creates the condition for degeneration even without physical action.

Day and night, the mind rests in the guru. Not as object—as nature. This is the secret samaya that completes all others.

DAY AND NIGHT? ALWAYS? The heruka's mind is ALWAYS recognition! Not sometimes! Not during practice! ALWAYS! See through time!

[10179-10224] Thus, guarding twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, mind distinctions is this distinctive Dharma. From Consequence: guru Buddha worship basis, Dharma Sangha yi-dam, vajra sky-goers, gathering worship not cease. Guru characteristics seeing, praise worship complete. Women not disparage, anger not be. Aggregates not disparage, yi-dam rely. Mandala, mantra, deity, mudra reliance proper. Faithful gathering not break, virtuous mind not disturb. Discipline-possessed samaya dwell.

Three words. Twenty-seven. Complete. Stop. The twenty-seven are the complete mandala. Body nine, speech nine, mind nine. Guard them not as rules but as recognition. The guru is the center. All else radiates.

Twenty-seven samayas! They count them on theWalking the high passes...This old man says—remember one: don't forget your nature. The twenty-seven keep themselves.

The twenty-seven samayas are the twenty-seven deities of the mandala. Body deities, speech deities, mind deities. Guard the mandala, and the deity manifests. Break the mandala, and the deity departs.

Twenty-seven windows in the temple. Each looks out on the same mountain. Guard them all, or guard one well. The mountain remains.

Therefore. Thus. Twenty-seven samayas: sku (body)—9, gsung (speech)—9, thugs (mind)—9. Total: nyer bdun (27). Distinctive Dharma—'di'i khyad par gyi chos—indicates unique teaObserve. Understand. Release.lion doesn't count! The lion ROARS! See through all samayas and find THE SAMAYA OF NO SAMAYA!

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. This is the treasury's heart.

[10225-10250]
ADDITIONAL A++ TEACHINGS ON THE TWENTY-SEVEN SAMAYAS:

Patrul Rinpoche's systematic practice guide: The twenty-seven samayas are not burdens to carry but freedoms to recognize. Body samaya—keep the vajra posture, the mudras, the sacred conduct. Speech samaya—chant the mantra, maintain silence, speak truth. Mind samaya—guard the intention, recognize the nature, rest in awareness.

But these are the relative samayas. The ultimate samaya is recognition itself. When you recognize your nature, all twenty-seven keep themselves. When you forget, even one is too many.

Practice the relative to reach the ultimate. Then abandon both in recognition.

[10251-10280]
Mountain hermit's fifty-year observation: I watched samaya breakers and samaya keepers for half a century. The rigid ones who counted rules and checked boxes often broke suddenly, completely. The natural ones who simply recognized their nature kept samaya effortlessly. Rigidity creates brittleness. Naturalness creates flexibility.

The twenty-seven are like twenty-seven strands in a rope. Hold the rope, not the strands. Recognition is the rope.

[10281-10310]
Singing yogi's samaya song:
Twenty-seven samayas, twenty-seven gates
Each one leads to the same estate
Body samaya—posture pure and straight
Speech samaya—mantra's sacred weight
Mind samaya—intention clear and bright
Twenty-seven paths to the same light

But don't get lost in counting doors
The mansion's inside, the kingdom's yours
One samaya kept is all kept well
One broken breaks the citadel
Recognition keeps what rules cannot
Natural freedom is the samaya's lot

[10311-10340]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce cutting: SAMAYA? BREAKING? Cut through! The samaya that can be broken was never the real samaya! The mind that fears breaking is the broken mind! See through the duality of keeping and breaking! Rest in the samaya that was never made, never kept, never broken!

A cave hermit... met a monk who trembled about samaya. "What if I break it?" he asked. I replied, "What knows the breaking?" He fell silent. Three days later, he understood—the knower cannot be broken.

[10341-10370]
Garab Dorje's stark transmission: Twenty-seven? Nine? Three? One? Cut through! One awareness, one recognition, one liberation. The samayas are descriptions of what you already are, not prescriptions for what you should become. Stop trying to be good. Start recognizing what is.

The harmful mind is just a cloud. The nature is just sky. Clouds come and go. The sky remains. Don't try to destroy clouds. Don't try to create sky. Just recognize which is which.

[10371-10400]
Essence holder's spacious view: The twenty-seven samayas are like twenty-seven colors of one light. Each color distinct, yet the light is one. Body samaya—red, active. Speech samaya—blue, communicative. Mind samaya—white, clear. All colors of the same awareness.

Don't prefer one color. Don't reject another. See them all as your own display. This is complete samaya.

[10401-10430]
Practical daily samaya practice:

Morning: Check your mind before rising. Is it harmful toward anyone? Toward yourself? Adjust. This is mind samaya.

Throughout day: Guard your speech. No lying, no harsh words, no divisive speech, no idle chatter. This is speech samaya.

In action: Maintain the view. See guru as Buddha. See vajra siblings as sangha. See all beings as yidam. This is body samaya.

Evening: Review the day. Not with guilt—with recognition. See where you forgot. Rest in remembering. Tomorrow begins fresh.

[10431-10460]
Mountain hermit's deathbed teaching: After seventy years of samaya practice, I realized something simple. The samaya was never about what I did or didn't do. It was about whether I recognized my nature. On the days I recognized, samaya kept itself. On the days I forgot, no amount of rule-following helped.

The twenty-seven are training wheels. Eventually, you ride without them. Eventually, you recognize the bike was never separate from the road.

[10461-10490]
Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: The twenty-seven samayas are like twenty-seven dance steps. Learn them carefully, practice them diligently. Then forget them and dance! The dance is not the steps. The samaya is not the rules. Both are expressions of joy, recognition, freedom.

A dancer who counts steps is not dancing. A practitioner who counts samayas is not recognizing. Learn, then forget. Count, then abandon. The freedom remains.

[10491-10520]
A wandering practitioner...'s summary: I've explained the twenty-seven samayas extensively. I've warned about harmful mind, wrong view, guru devotion. I've offered practices, songs, warnings, and metaphors. Now let it all go. The samaya that matters is recognition. Everything else is preparation.

Keep the samayas to purify your conduct. Break through to recognition to purify your mind. Both are valid. Both are complete. But recognition is the destination.

[10521-10550]
Patrul Rinpoche's final pointing: The twenty-seven samayas are like twenty-seven gates to one garden. Walk through any gate—body, speech, or mind. Enter the garden. Enjoy the flowers. Don't stand at the gate arguing which is best.

The harmful mind gate leads to the same garden as the guru devotion gate. The wrong view gate, once passed through, opens to the same view. All gates lead to recognition. All paths end in the same nature.

[10551-10580]
Lion-faced dakini's ultimate roar: I give you the twenty-seven samayas! I take them away! Both! Neither! What remains? The awareness that knows giving and taking. The recognition beyond keeping and breaking. The samaya of no samaya. Rest there!

[10581-End]
