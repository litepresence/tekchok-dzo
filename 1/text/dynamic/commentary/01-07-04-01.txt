[10086-10114] First outer outer—harmful mind abandoning. From Essence Meaning Aspect-Taken Tantra: whoever mantra-holder vajra holder, other or self, if hold harm-doing mind—leprosy-possessed body, cold touch possessing, body thousand-times five taken after, cold hell certain becomes. Supremely mantra entered, harm-doing mind done, above suffering experiences.

[10086-10114] Three words. Harmful. Mind. Stop. The body and speech samayas were about action. Mind samaya is about intention. One moment of harmful thought creates karma that takes five thousand bodies to exhaust. Stop the thought at the root.

[10086-10114] They think "I didn't DO anything!" But the mind moved. The thought arose. This old man says—harmful mind is the seed. Action is just the sprout. Cut the seed, no tree. Guard your mind like a fortress.

[10086-10114] The vajra holder who thinks harm is like a king carrying a hidden dagger. He looks noble, but the weapon is there. The cold hell is not punishment. It is the natural climate of a cold mind. Warm your mind with compassion, or freeze in your own hatred.

[10086-10114] I wanted revenge once. Someone wronged me. The thought burned like fire. Then I saw—he's suffering too. The harmful mind hurt me more than him. Let it go.

[10086-10114] Therefore. Thus. Mind samaya first level: phyi'i phyi (outer-outer)—gnod sems spong (harmful mind abandoning). Precise analysis: gnas chen gnod sems (harmful mind) creates the cause for grang dmyal (cold hell). The mechanism: one moment of harmful thought equals five thousand body-takings in future lives.

[10086-10114] The mind is the king. Body and speech are servants. If the king is cruel, the kingdom suffers. Make the king kind, and all prospers.

[10086-10114] HARMFUL MIND? speaks with fierce compassion The lion's mind has no harm! The lion's mind has no kindness! It just IS! See through the duality of help and harm!

[10099-10130] Outer inner—guru and vajra siblings harmful mind abandoning. From Sky-Iron Fire Blazing Tantra: if common being object, harm mind arises—common body possessing, three hundred life cut, this sin's share equal. Teaching sign holding form, wrong becomes. Mantra entered, hundred-times. Vajra sibling seven-times, lineage guru hundred-times, root guru that one's hundred. Mantra door entered, empowerment obtained, supremely aspect-ripen thus.

[10099-10130] Three words. Guru. Sibling. Mind. Stop. Harmful mind toward guru—hundred times worse than toward ordinary beings. Toward vajra siblings—seven times worse. The hierarchy of objects reflects the hierarchy of your own mind. See all as guru, and harmful mind becomes impossible.

[10099-10130] They get angry at the guru! "He didn't give me what I wanted!" This old man wants to shake them! The guru gave you the Dharma—what more do you want? Harmful mind toward guru is like biting the hand that feeds you. But worse—hundred times worse.

[10099-10130] The guru is the display of your own wisdom. To think harm toward him is to think harm toward enlightenment itself. The lineage guru is the stream of blessing. To dam the stream is to die of thirst. The root guru is the source. To poison the source is to poison yourself.

[10099-10130] I got angry at my teacher once. Felt justified. Then I saw—my anger was my own obstacle, not his. He remained calm. I suffered. Who was harmed?

[10099-10130] Therefore. Thus. phyi'i nang (outer-inner)—bla ma dang mched lcam la gnod sems spong. Precise analysis: karmic multiplication hierarchy: common being—1x, teaching holder—100x, mantra entered—700x (vajra sibling 7 x 100), lineage guru—100x, root guru—100x. Supremely—empowerment obtained—exponential increase.

[10099-10130] See the guru as Buddha. See the sibling as Buddha. Then harmful mind is seen as impossible as the sky being red. The mind rests in recognition.

[10099-10130] HIERARCHY? MULTIPLICATION? The heruka sees all beings as equal! One harmful mind is ALL harmful minds! See through the calculation!

[10115-10143] Outer secret—self-other established-view wrong-view arise abandoning. From Great Arrangement: self or other's hidden Dharma disparage, wrong path, root samaya exceeded, earth-dwell fire suffering, long time dwell. Self's established-view wrong-view arise, hell itself liberate chance not. Mind's inner outer—conduct, inner—meditate, secret—wrong view abandoning. From Crystal House Stacked Tantra: view, meditate, conduct wrong—path wrong great, beings all's suffering this mind ripen certain.

[10115-10143] Three words. Wrong. View. Stop. The outer secret—don't disparage others' paths. The inner—don't confuse meditation methods. The secret—don't abandon right view. Wrong view is the root of all harm. Cut it, and the tree falls.

[10115-10143] They say "My view is higher!" This old man says—all views are ladders. The rung you're on seems highest until you climb higher. Don't kick away the ladder that brought you up. Don't disparage the path that others walk.

[10115-10143] The established views are the cages of the mind. Wrong view is the bird that thinks the cage is the sky. Break the cage. The sky was always there. But don't tell other birds their cages are wrong. Show them the sky through your own flight.

[10115-10143] I thought my way was the only way. Then I met a hermit who never heard of Buddha. His mind was pure. His view? Simple kindness. I learned—view is in the living, not the labeling.

[10115-10143] Therefore. Thus. phyi'i gsang (outer-secret)—rang gzhan gyi grub mtha' la log lta (self-other's established-view wrong-view). nang gi gsum (inner's three): spyod pa (conduct), bsgom pa (meditate), lta ba (view). Precise analysis: log lam (wrong path) results from reversing these three.

[10115-10143] The right view is no view. The wrong view is any view grasped. Let views arise and dissolve like breath. Don't hold, don't push.

[10115-10143] VIEW? NO VIEW? speaks with fierce compassion See through the viewer! The lion has no view! The lion SEES! See through wrong and right!

[10134-10178] Secret's three outer—view, meditate, conduct. Inner—yi-dam deity. Secret—guru and vajra siblings day-night mind done. From Lotus Klong Tantra: whoever mind's karma wander, mind done dharmas, mind not-done degenerate, past ceased karma's end, uninterrupted suffering experiences. From Co-Arisen Near-Taken Tantra: actual-accomplish supreme desire, yi-dam abandon not, guru abandon actual-accomplish destroyed, other where accomplish not find. Therefore Dharma promise taken, guru's before samaya pledged, mind thought virtue's karma—self abandon actual-accomplish degenerates.

[10134-10178] Three words. Mind. Done. Secret. Stop. The secret of secrets—what you think day and night about guru and sangha. This is the deepest samaya. Let your mind be Buddha-mind, and all is complete. Let it be ordinary mind, and accomplishment dissolves.

[10134-10178] They practice during sessions, forget between. This old man says—the secret samaya is ALL THE TIME! Day and night, awake and dream, keep the guru in your mind. Not as burden—as recognition.

[10134-10178] The yi-dam is your own enlightened form. The guru is your own enlightened mind. To think of them with degenerate mind is to dissolve your own Buddhahood. The promise taken is the promise to recognize.

[10134-10178] I think of my teacher when I wake, when I sleep, when I work. Not obsession—recognition. He taught me the nature (rang bzhin) of mind. Now the teaching and the mind are one.

[10134-10178] Therefore. Thus. gsang ba'i gsum (secret's three): phyi—lta sgom spyod (view, meditate, conduct), nang—yi dam gyi lha (yi-dam deity), gsang—bla ma dang mched lcam (guru and siblings). Precise analysis: yid kyi las 'khyal (mind's karma wandering) creates the condition for degeneration even without physical action.

[10134-10178] Day and night, the mind rests in the guru. Not as object—as nature. This is the secret samaya that completes all others.

[10134-10178] DAY AND NIGHT? ALWAYS? The heruka's mind is ALWAYS recognition! Not sometimes! Not during practice! ALWAYS! See through time!

[10179-10224] Thus, guarding twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, mind distinctions is this distinctive Dharma. From Consequence: guru Buddha worship basis, Dharma Sangha yi-dam, vajra sky-goers, gathering worship not cease. Guru characteristics seeing, praise worship complete. Women not disparage, anger not be. Aggregates not disparage, yi-dam rely. Mandala, mantra, deity, mudra reliance proper. Faithful gathering not break, virtuous mind not disturb. Discipline-possessed samaya dwell.

[10179-10224] Three words. Twenty-seven. Complete. Stop. The twenty-seven are the complete mandala. Body nine, speech nine, mind nine. Guard them not as rules but as recognition. The guru is the center. All else radiates.

[10179-10224] Twenty-seven samayas! They count them on their fingers! This old man says—remember one: don't forget your nature. The twenty-seven keep themselves.

[10179-10224] The twenty-seven samayas are the twenty-seven deities of the mandala. Body deities, speech deities, mind deities. Guard the mandala, and the deity manifests. Break the mandala, and the deity departs.

[10179-10224] Twenty-seven windows in the temple. Each looks out on the same mountain. Guard them all, or guard one well. The mountain remains.

[10179-10224] Therefore. Thus. Twenty-seven samayas: sku (body)—9, gsung (speech)—9, thugs (mind)—9. Total: nyer bdun (27). Distinctive Dharma—'di'i khyad par gyi chos—indicates unique teaching of this tantra.

[10179-10224] The twenty-seven dissolve into one. The one is your awareness. Rest there, and the mandala is complete.

[10179-10224] TWENTY-SEVEN? ONE? speaks with fierce compassion See through the counting! The lion doesn't count! The lion ROARS! See through all samayas and find THE SAMAYA OF NO SAMAYA!
What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. This is the treasury's heart.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[01-07-04-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
