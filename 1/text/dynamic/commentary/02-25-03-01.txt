[1-49]
First, it is path-appearance—from the spontaneously accomplished womb of great primordial purity, like entering a house of ultimate result, then emerging from there, needing to appear externally from the primordially pure ground. The mode of appearance appears as abiding-essence-body. There are two path-appearances: those making oneself Buddha before the result, and having made oneself Buddha, the path of guiding trainees through manifest body accomplishing benefit. From this, here we hold the no-more-learning path-appearance as the three kayas being path-appearance AND being result—non-contradictory, connected meaning. Don't you see? The path and result aren't separate events in time—they're different aspects of the same recognition. Like a mirror reflecting: the reflection is both the appearing (path) and the complete image (result) simultaneously!
