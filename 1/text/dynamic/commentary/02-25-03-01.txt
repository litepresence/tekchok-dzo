First, it is path-appearance—from the spontaneously accomplished womb of great primordial purity, like entering a house of ultimate result, then emerging from there, needing to appear externally from the primordially pure ground. The mode of appearance appears as abiding-essence-body. There are two path-appearances: those making oneself Buddha before the result, and having made oneself Buddha, the path of guiding trainees through manifest body accomplishing benefit. From this, here we hold the no-more-learning path-appearance as the three kayas being path-appearance AND being result—non-contradictory, connected meaning. Don't you see? The path and result aren't separate events in time—they're different aspects of the same recognition. Like a mirror reflecting: the reflection is both the appearing (path) and the complete image (result) simultaneously!

The liberated Dharmakaya internal expanse, the three kayas appearing externally as path-appearance—body and pristine awareness display appearing, Dharmakaya as mind of pristine awareness, Sambhogakaya as its body, Nirmanakaya as appearing activity, producing benefit. This too is internal-clear ground-appearance body and pristine awareness, non-dual, non-separated Vajrasattva suchness, and from that externally clear, the three kayas' path-appearance self-arising—though similar in awareness state, internal-external distinction divided. From self-appearance aspect, in trainees' appearance field, Sambhogakaya-Nirmanakaya appearing, accomplishing benefit, though one as awareness-play, self-appearance not seen by trainees, but that which appears from it is seen—this distinction shows the two similar ones differentiated.

This is subtle! Your own awareness displays everything, but you don't see it as your own display—you see it as "external world." Like watching a movie and forgetting it's just light on a screen. The play of your own rigpa appears as samsara and nirvana, but until you recognize it, it seems like "real world out there." Recognition changes nothing in the display—only in how you understand it!

Listen! Longchenpa quotes from Sengge Tsal Dzog (Lion's Perfected Power): "Vajrasattva's suchness and self-appearance mandala pure of the two—similar ground, one, yet difference of straying is great." This is a crucial warning! The nature of mind (Vajrasattva's suchness) and its self-display (the mandala) have the same ground—they're not two different things. But the difference between recognizing this and not recognizing it? Vast! Like the difference between a rich man and a beggar who both live in the same house but one knows he owns it and the other doesn't!

[16384-16400]
Pay attention to this philosophical subtlety—it's easy to get confused! If internal expanse and external clear-appearance-path are not divided, and the three bodies are held as the result of self-appearance, then just as Nirmanakaya appears to trainees, the primordially pure Dharmakaya of the place of liberation would also appear to trainees.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Since the three bodies are one in essence, Dharmakaya would appear as gathering-dispersing and colors!

Or alternatively, Nirmanakaya would not appear to trainees because Dharmakaya doesn't appear. This is the dilemma! Longchenpa is showing the logical consequences if you hold wrong views about the kayas.

The resolution? The three bodies should not be grasped as one in essence and one in appearance. Nirmanakaya is the compassion aspect. What appears from that compassion is reflected-image emanation, not actual Nirmanakaya, because it's not compassion itself.

[16400-16402]
This distinction of tenets is extremely subtle—wise ones should examine and understand it in their minds. This is a crucial point!

Emaho! Longchenpa is protecting you from philosophical errors that could derail your practice for lifetimes. Don't just skim over this—ponder it deeply!

Second: Explaining the meaning of the context in three parts: General presentation of the abodes of three bodies. Specific explanation of pristine awareness abodes.

It is not that the treasury opens. It is that the perception of closure dissolves. Precision reveals what was never obscured. Summarizing the meaning of the five abodes of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity.

[Final]
What was spoken here is the unspeakable nature. The words are offered; the recognition is yours. The treasury is complete.
