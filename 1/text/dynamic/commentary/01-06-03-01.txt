What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[7-9]
Stop searching. Start seeing.
Ripening is not transformation. It is recognition of what was always ripe.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.
