The seed planted in fertile ground does not choose to grow. It grows because growth is its nature.
The teaching opens like a door that was never closed. What enters? Only what was already inside. The words are fingers pointing at a moon that has never been absent.

A practitioner.
The vessel receives water not by effort but by being empty and open.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

Stop searching. Start seeing.
Ripening is not transformation. It is recognition of what was always ripe.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form.

The text points beyond itself pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

Between the extremes, the vast middle way opens like a horizon that recedes as you approach.
The sun ripens all fruits without choosing. Its light asks nothing.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

Like lightning illuminating the valley for an instant—such is the nature (rang bzhin) of direct recognition.
The empowerments are rain falling on different soils. The rain is the same.

What is called delusion here is wisdom appearing as confusion wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. The flowering differs.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming.

In the pause between mind-moments, awareness recognizes itself. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

In this manner.
The seed planted in fertile ground does not choose to grow. It grows because growth is its nature.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

An old vagabond.
The vessel receives water not by effort but by being empty and open.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

The sequence completes itself, not by reaching an end, but by recognizing there was never a beginning. Return to what you never left. Rest in what has never moved. The commentary ends where the teaching begins—in the space between thoughts where thoughts have never been.

Hence. The structure. Language points past language.

Recognition, not comprehension—awareness seeing itself.

Difficulty arises only for the one who thinks something must be achieved.

Voice 20 proclaims: The sequence appears linear but is circular. End and beginning meet like snake swallowing tail. Where you start is where you finish. What you seek is what you are. This is the great joke of the path.
