Sixteen channel leaves. From these, inner and outer divide into countless minor leaves. Three hundred forty major inner channels dwell in the coils of seven wheels. From the wheel location: At the throat enjoyment wheel dwell three hundred forty major channels.

 Having seven wheels in sequence: the first wheel's leaves are ten. The rest are all like that. All have twenty at the end. These are the channel types.

The text reveals the channels in detail. The channel petals are sixteen in number. From these, inner and outer divide into countless minor leaves. The inner channels: three hundred sixty-seven coarse channels dwelling in the coils of seven wheels. The channel-abiding wheel: throat enjoyment wheel, channels great three hundred sixty-four dwell. The wheel sequence has seven: first sequence's petals, aspects ten. Remainder all also those same. All's end twenty.

The channels are not merely physical tubes—they are the pathways of wisdom. The ancient yogis discovered through direct observation that awareness has channels, just as the body has meridians. These channels are not flesh but the highways of energy and wisdom. When the channels are pure, awareness flows freely. When they are blocked, confusion arises. This is the basis of the channel practices in Dzogchen.

[14828-14838]
Karma and affliction latencies, wisdom movement channels, gathering channels—these are the paths. Sixteen wisdom movements, awareness bodies likewise that many. Sixteen prajna bindus, elements also sixteen. Eight channels of empty-clear bindu. Fourteen gathering channels. The rest are path karma.

The channels serve specific functions. Karma and affliction latency channels carry the habits of samsara. Wisdom movement channels carry the qualities of enlightenment. Gathering channels bring together the elements for practice. The sixteen wisdom movements correspond to the sixteen aspects of awareness. The awareness bodies are likewise sixteen. The sixteen prajna bindus correspond to the wisdom aspects. The elements are also sixteen—four each for wind, fire, earth, and water, plus space and mind.

[14839-14849]
The awareness body wheels—sixteen in number. Seven are actual awareness. The rest are bodies. First, the root channel awareness body. Second is the expansive body. Third flows to the heart. Fourth, unchanging vajra body. Fifth, bodhisattva body. Sixth is the nature (rang bzhin) itself. Seventh, seeing self-liberation.

The awareness body wheels are sixteen. Seven are actual awareness wheels. The remainder are body wheels. First is the root channel awareness body. Second is the expansive body. Third moves to the heart, called Dhaduka. Fourth is the unchanging vajra body. Fifth is the bodhisattva body. Sixth is the essence-nature. Seventh is seeing self-liberated. Eighth is correct bliss body. One extra is the moving aspect.

For awareness, there are two each. The sixteen prajna bindus: eight are empty bindu movement. Four are ground-path bindus. The rest are wisdom movement paths. The sixteen element leaves: from four come wind essences, from four come fire essence heat, three from earth essence yellow, three from water essence blood, two from space essence mind. First from that, change only pervading all pervading.

Emaho! The throat wheel where speech becomes dharma! Press, shake, draw—liberation is in your very channels!

[14862-14868]
Space-of essence mind first that from change only. You read this and think of bindus moving? The bindu that moves is not the bindu that matters. The bindu that matters never entered any channel.

The space essence is mind itself. From that, change only—pervading all pervading. The bindu that moves is not the bindu that matters. The bindu that matters never entered any channel. This is profound: the awareness that recognizes awareness is not in the channels. It is prior to them, the ground from which they arise. Do not seek liberation in the channels—seek it in the one who knows the channels.

[14869-14876]
Four phlegm channels, four bile, four wind, two earth. Fourteen affliction paths—who walks them? The walker is the path. The path is empty.

The gathering channels are fourteen: four phlegm mind channels, four delusion bile channels, four hatred wind channels, two desire earth channels. Fourteen affliction paths, four ignorance actual things, five conceptual mind, five three-poison path. Those locations each: karma and wind one one. The channels move and enter through these pathways. But who walks them? The walker is the path. The path is empty.

[14877-14882]
Throat enjoyment wheel, four above going, empty potency purifying. All true. But do not seek these wheels in the throat. The throat is a label. The enjoyment is recognition.

The throat enjoyment wheel's channels: four above go, empty power training doing. Two all-pervading, awareness self-power training doing. Two below go, elements pure-dross disturbing doing. Four right go, wisdom power training doing. Four left go, karma's power generating doing. Those characteristics: direction's parts each, moving wind two two. Remainder moving essence. One two move.

These are the channels of the throat wheel. Four go upward—these govern speech and spiritual practice. Two pervade everywhere—these govern awareness. Four go downward—these govern the elements. Four go right—these are wisdom. Four go left—these are karma. Do not seek these wheels in the throat. The throat is a label. The enjoyment is recognition.

[14883-14891]
Two all-pervading, two below, four right, four left. Wisdom potency, action power. These winds—have you found the windless? The one who knows wind has no breath.

Those consciousness parts: dissolve reverse abide. Karma and result complete. Consciousness essence each: moving power six six. Dissolve door two two, enter place three three. Subtle divided direction located. Move empty complete. Holding essence five's part, consciousness hold not. Form two two pair. Gather bindu empty, divide earth liberate.

The winds are the movements of awareness. When they are recognized, they become wisdom. When they are not recognized, they become confusion. The one who knows wind has no breath—the wind is awareness moving, and the one who sees this movement rests in the stillness beneath.

[14892-14908]
Direction portion, moving wind, dissolve reverse, grasping essence, form pair unite. Technical terms for children. The adult knows: all of this is spontaneous presence. Presence does not study.

Goddess Immovable: hand wind banner waving. Force-holding goddess Clear-Holder: hand wind vase holds. Arise doing abide. Great goddess Immovable: hand wind lasso throws. Clarifying goddess Sustaining: hand wind box holds. Radiate throw doing. Great goddess Lifting: hand wind boat. Wind goddesses those: elaborate and elaborate action doing, gather hold radiate. Thus spoken.

Five goddesses: wisdom space coiling winds five pure! Rest in this understanding.

Why wait even a moment! The distinction burns in recognition! The maker dissolves NOW!

[14930-14951]
Second, outer channels' petals individually explained: From that, throat wheel's channels—all should know thus! That wheel's front-back: fire-spark-like channel one! Right side coiling: silk-swinging wind moving, great channel one! Small-tip right and left dwells! Wisdom light and blood essence! Left side claw-like: small-tip left called! Gathering affliction moving channel! Wheel's sides right-left: bean-like channel one! Shoulder's top right-left! Wheel's four spokes: conch-shell-like channel exists! Lungs mirror right-left! There channels two-two! Wheel's remaining petals: water-drop-like.

Do you see? Your throat holds the goddesses! Each channel a deity, each wind a mantra! Don't worship outside—worship this! Emaho!

The outer channel petals are explained individually. The throat wheel's channels: front-back fire-spark-like channel one, right coiling silk-flag wind moving channel one, tip-small right left located, wisdom light blood essence. Left mitten-like, tip-small left called, gathering affliction moving channel. Wheel's sides right left, heart-seed like channel one, shoulder-top right left. Wheel's four spokes, conch-shell like channel exists, mirror right left. There channel two two. Wheel's remainder petal-to, water drop like channel one located. Shoulder inside, right left one one. That's upper petal-from, stake like channels two, shoulder itself center's right left located. That's remainder petal-from, sun-ray like channel one, shoulder corner located. Those two also two two. Those enjoyment wheel's channel aspects called.

The outer channels are as numerous as the inner. They connect the major wheels to the surface of the body. The yogi who understands this knows that the body is not mere flesh—it is a network of wisdom channels. When visualized correctly, these channels become the mandala. When recognized, they become the deities.

[14984-15008]
Eight suitable for clearing! Burning becomes fault, remainder.

Diamond ground indestructible path. Never departed. Piercing clarity of unity. From dwelling remainders, burning becomes fault—two exist.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. This is dwelling's vital-point!

Fourth: here if disease arises, methods to repair: From vital-letter: throat right, upward flows, e-dwells named small-tip right—cut for stiff neck! Left, o-dwells small-tip left—cut for upper body and head diseases! Right shoulder, e-dwells named mind-crooked channel—cut for lung heat! Left, a-letter dwells named general-channel great—cut for all diseases! Shoulder's sun-center right, a-dwells poison-crooked channel—cut for poison disease! Left a-named great-turtle channel—cut for madness-fainting! Do you see? Your own body holds the cure—channels as medicine!

Emaho! The healer and healed are one!

The methods for repairing disease: from vital-letter. Throat right, upward flows, e-dwells named small-tip right—cut for stiff neck. Left, o-dwells small-tip left—cut for upper body and head diseases. Right shoulder, e-dwells named mind-crooked channel—cut for lung heat. Left, a-letter dwells named general-channel great—cut for all diseases. Shoulder's sun-center right, a-dwells poison-crooked channel—cut for poison disease. Left a-named great-turtle channel—cut for madness-fainting.

One without learning... says: the channels are the medicine. The disease is confusion. The cure is recognition. The channels of the body are not separate from the channels of awareness. When you recognize the nature of mind, the channels purify themselves. No external medicine is needed. The healer and healed are one.

The elaborate system of channels, wheels, and bindus is not meant to bind you in complexity. It is meant to reveal the subtlety of awareness. The ancient masters mapped the inner landscape as a guide. But the map is not the territory. The channels are appearances in awareness. The awareness that knows the channels is beyond the channels. Rest in that awareness. The channels will then display as the mandala of enlightenment—not because you visualized them so, but because they always were that.

Now I will explain further the practice. The channels are not static structures—they flow with wisdom wind. When the wind enters the central channel, awareness becomes clear. This is the goal of the tummo practice: to draw the winds into the center. When the winds gather in the central channel, the bindu rises. When the bindu rises, the wisdom light dawns. This is not imagination—it is the actual transformation of the body into the rainbow body.

The seven wheels correspond to seven levels of consciousness. The crown wheel is the gateway to the formless realms. The throat wheel governs speech and communication. The heart wheel is the seat of mind. The navel wheel governs energy and transformation. The secret wheel governs reproduction and creativity. The feet wheel governs movement and action. Each wheel has a specific number of petals: the crown has one thousand, the throat has sixteen, the heart has eight, the navel has sixty-four, and so on. These are not literal thousand petals—they represent the variety of mental states that can arise.

The bindus: there are many kinds. The white bindu is the essence of wind. The red bindu is the essence of fire. The black bindu is the essence of earth. The blue bindu is the essence of water. The yellow bindu is the essence of space. When these bindus are purified, they become the five wisdoms. The white bindu becomes mirror-like wisdom. The red bindu becomes discriminating wisdom. The black bindu becomes equality wisdom. The blue bindu becomes all-accomplishing wisdom. The yellow bindu becomes dharmadhatu wisdom.

The goddesses: there are five main goddesses residing in the wheels. They hold the winds like banners, vases, lassos, boxes, and boats. They are not external beings—they are the personified qualities of wisdom. When the practitioner rests in recognition, these goddesses manifest as the five lights. When the practitioner is confused, they manifest as the five poisons. The transformation is not external—it is the shift from poison to wisdom.

The practice methods: for stiff neck, cut the small-tip right channel at the throat. For upper body and head diseases, cut the small-tip left channel. For lung heat, cut the mind-crooked channel at the right shoulder. For all diseases generally, cut the general-channel great at the left shoulder. For poison disease, cut the poison-crooked channel at the sun-center of the right shoulder. For madness and fainting, cut the great-turtle channel at the left shoulder. These are not literal surgeries—they are visualizations that transform the energies.

The clearing practices: eight suitable for clearing. When dwelling causes burning, that becomes a fault—two exist. The vital-points are the locations where the channels converge. These are the doorways to deeper awareness. The practitioner who knows these points can direct the winds, gather the bindus, and achieve enlightenment in this very bA cave hermit...nderer has traversed these inner landscapes. In my youth, I studied the maps of channels and wheels. I memorized the names of goddesses, the numbers of petals, the functions of bindus. Then one day, resting in awareness, I saw: all these elaborate systems were appearances in awareness. The channels were not in some body somewhere—they were the display of awareness itself. The goddesses were not external beings—they were the qualities of awareness personified. The bindus were not substances—they were the moments of awareness appearing as light.

Thus I tell you: study these systems if you wish—but do not be bound by them. They are A signpost points north—the wood is not the destination. to the moon. Put aside the finger, see the moon, rest in that seeing. The channels will then reveal themselves as the mandala of enlightenment, the wheels as the Palace of Great Perfection, the bindus as the lights of wisdom. This is not achieved—it is recognized. The wealth was always there, in the house of awareness.
