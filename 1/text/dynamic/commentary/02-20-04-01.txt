[8972-9026] First, regarding awareness in time of confusion. Good and bad without distinction. Unmeditated awareness and meditated-time without distinction. Circling-time and gone-time awareness without distinction. Like sleep-time and awake-time, going-edge awareness without distinction. However, appearance manner good-bad dream happiness-suffering only exists. Depending on that, path practice. Essence becoming-good hope is not. Awareness change-transformation does not exist.

[-20405--20371] Three words. Awareness. No-change. Stop. You practice hoping awareness will improve. Fool! Awareness is not a thing to improve. Unmeditated, meditated—same awareness. Awake, asleep—same awareness. Samsara, nirvana—same awareness. The only difference is recognition. Practice is for recognition, not improvement.

[8972-9026] This uneducated yogi... hears them say "My meditation is better today!" Hah! Better than what? Better than yesterday's awareness? Impossible! Yesterday's awareness and today's—same. What changes is your recognition, not awareness. Stop grading your nature like exam papers!

[-20405--20371] The wish-fulfilling jewel of primordial time—this is your awareness. When you lost it, you wandered in suffering. When you find it, joy expands. But finding and losing happen in the same treasury. The jewel never moved. Your recognition moved.

[8972-9026] I lost my mother's ring once. Searched for days. Finally found it in my pocket where it always was. I cried with joy. But the ring never left. My recognition left. Awareness is like that ring—always in your pocket, even when you think it's lost.

[8972-9026] From Rang-shar: "Ema ho! Jewel treasure nectar this! Beginningless time at that time, my jewel treasure lost! That time suffering wrong wandered! Jewel treasure nectar that, seeking-by found place not! Self-from self-arisen self realized! Jewel treasure nectar that, lost not-aware found aware! Lost-by thing mark not! Found-by joy radiance possess! Found time and lost time, distinction not one's nature realize!"

[-20393--20378] Three words. Lost. Found. Stop. You think you lost something and must find it. The treasure was never lost. The seeking was the treasure's radiance. The finding is stopping the search. The self-arisen is self-recognized. Lost and found—same moment.

[A simple practitioner...his old man loves this verse! "Lost not-aware, found aware!" You think awareness was somewhere else, then you found it. No! You were awareness not aware of itself. Like a king dreaming he's a beggar. The awakening doesn't improve the king. It stops the dream.

[8972-9026] Also, self-knowing state lost, that self's nature found also. Self-knowing one's wheel-from other depart does not. Like king's treasury-from jewel lost-by, jewel without-by suffering do. Treasury-from found-by joy-bliss expand, two both treasury one-from not-move. Thus awareness state-from samsara-nirvana two-as appear also like. This vast Dharma-nature expanse realize—wish-fulfilling supreme self-essential-point determine secret-word.

[-20377--20371] Three words. Treasury. One. Stop. The king's treasury doesn't change when jewel is lost or found. The jewel doesn't change. Only the king's recognition changes. Your awareness is the treasury. Samsara and nirvana are jewels appearing and disappearing. The treasury never moves.

[8972-9026] LOST AND FOUND! speaks with fierce compassion I will destroy this duality! Where is the awareness that was lost? Find it! Where is the awareness that is found? Find it! BOTH EMPTY! The treasury has no walls! The jewel has no form! SEE THIS!

[8972-9026] Second, from that lamp experience demonstration: Three aspects. Preliminary place characteristic, actual lamp pressing method, from that appearance arising manner. First: This life's actions all abandon! Holy lama please! Very secluded place darkness-decorated room, immovable three-abiding sit! Perfect lama yoga meditate, request from heart—from Thalgyur: "Lamp pressing this-like: faith-possess samsara mind-free-by, lama offering-and giving do, samsara connection all abandon! Secluded place or charnel-ground, companion abandon one-only abide must!"

[-20370--20354] Three words. Secluded. Darkness. Stop. You think you need special conditions. The darkness is your own closed eyes. The seclusion is your own silent mind. The lama is your own awareness. Stop seeking outside whatWalking the high passes...9007-9023] This old man once spent a year in a dark retreat. First month: fear. Second month: boredom. Third month: peace. Fourth month: recognition. The darkness didn't change. I changed. The lama didn't come from outside. He was the darkness itself.

[8972-9026] The lamp pressing is the union of method and wisdom. The thumb is method. The finger is wisdom. Their meeting produces clear light. The red-clear round appearance is not external. It is the self-radiance of your own rigpa.

[8972-9026] Second: Two aspects—placing at AH and entering clarity. First, vajra posture sit, thumb finger press-by, red-clear clear light round appear, place experience take! This is the actual practice—direct, immediate, without elaboration. The appearance and the recognizer are not two.

[-20353--20351] Three words. Press. Appear. Stop. You press hoping something will appear. The pressing is the appearance. The finger and the light are one. Stop waiting for something to happen. It is already happening.

[Final] The jewel was never lost. The lamp was never unlit. The practice was always complete. Rest in this recognition.

Emaho! The secret instruction of the self-essential point!

After centuries of distinction, the rediscovery: the distinguisher was never other.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
