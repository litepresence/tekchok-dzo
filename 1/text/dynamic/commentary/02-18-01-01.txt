Now again we turn to the path of elaboration-free meaning—rigpa self-appearing. This is not another method—it is the recognition that there was never any confusion to clear. The great Vajra Essence secret show: two truths, one taste.

A voiceYou have heard the common vehicles—Sarvastivada, Sautrantika, Yogacara. Each proposes a path. Each promises liberation. But listen: these paths are like ladders to climb a mountain that was always under your feet. The ladder is not Mount Kailash. The path is not the goal.

The tradition points: Three words. Rigpa. Self-appearing. Path. See what is. The rigpa is your own awareness, knowing itself. It appears to itself as phenomena—this is self-appearing. The path is not somewhere to go—it is the recognizing itself. No elaboration, no construction, no effort. This is the great secret show, not hidden but overlooked.

A clarifying voice explains: The phrase elaboration-free meaning refers to the nature that is beyond conceptual construction. All elaborations—good, bad, neutral—are fabrications of mind. Rigpa is the awareness that knows this without trying to change it. Self-appearing means the nature displays itself as everything—forms, sounds, sensations—without ever leaving its own nature.
