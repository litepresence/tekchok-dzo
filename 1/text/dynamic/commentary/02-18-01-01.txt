[3922-3930]
Now again we turn to the path of elaboration-free meaning—rigpa self-appearing. This is not another method—it is the recognition that there was never any confusion to clear. The great Vajra Essence secret show: two truths, one taste.

A voiceYou have heard the common vehicles—Sarvastivada, Sautrantika, Yogacara. Each proposes a path. Each promises liberation. But listen: these paths are like ladders to climb a mountain that was always under your feet. The ladder is not the mountain. The path is not the goal.

The tradition points: Three words. Rigpa. Self-appearing. Path. See what is. The rigpa is your own awareness, knowing itself. It appears to itself as phenomena—this is self-appearing. The path is not somewhere to go—it is the recognizing itself. No elaboration, no construction, no effort. This is the great secret show, not hidden but overlooked.

A clarifying voice explains: The phrase elaboration-free meaning refers to the nature that is beyond conceptual construction. All elaborations—good, bad, neutral—are fabrications of mind. Rigpa is the awareness that knows this without trying to change it. Self-appearing means the nature displays itself as everything—forms, sounds, sensations—without ever leaving its own nature.

[3931-3940]
The distinction: common vehicles versus secret mantra, outer versus inner, nine progressive vehicles—all surpassed. This is Ati, the supreme, beyond all rankings.

The tradition writes: The common vehicles distinguish between their paths and goals. Sarvadhatu path leads to Arhat, Solitary Buddha to Pratyekabuddha, Full Awakening to Bodhisattva. Each path has stages, each stage has achievements. But Ati—the Great Perfection—has no stages because there is no one to progress. No achievements because nothing was ever lacking. The nine vehicles are like measuring the ocean with cups; Ati is the ocean itself.

A sharp voice demands: WHAT ARE YOU MEASURING? The mind? The rigpa? The path? Measurement is the problem. Even the distinction between common and supreme is another elaboration. Drop the measuring. See what is. The rice is already cooked. Why are you still looking for fire?

A systematic voice explains: The Tibetan distinguishes elaborations from non-elaboration. Common vehicles use distinctions—path, fruitions, bodhisattva levels, Buddha qualities. Dzogchen says: these distinctions are themselves elaborations. The nature needs no distinctions because it is already complete. Not that distinctions are wrong—they are useful tools. But they are Your voice echoes through three valleys—the echo is not your voice., not the moon.

[3941-3955]
The seven pith instructions surpass all: first, seeing the pith; second, understanding the pith; third, recognizing the pith; fourth, familiarizing with the pith; fifth, realizing the pith; sixth, accomplishing the pith; seventh, the pith of self-liberation.

These are not seven steps to climb—they are seven ways of describing one recognition. First you see the nature. Then you understand what you saw. Then you recognize it again. Then you become familiar. Then you realize it fully. Then you accomplish it in action. Then you see that accomplishment was never separate from yourself. All seven are one moment—the moment of recognition.

A wandering voice tells: My teacher gave me seven pith instructions. I wrote them all down. Then I realized—I did not need the paper. The instructions were The seeking is not the finding. The path is not the ground. the paper-reading mind. When I saw that, I burned the paper. The burning was the instruction. The ashes were the pith.

The tradition cuts: The seven pith are not secrets to be hoarded. They are obvious—too obvious to see. The first pith: see your mind. The second: understand what you see. The third: recognize the understander. The fourth: let recognition settle. The fifth: realize nothing to realize. The sixth: let accomplishment happen. The seventh: rest in self-liberation. All seven happen in one breath. The breath is the teaching.

[3956-3970]
Other vehicles rely on inferior paths: intellectual understanding, philosophical analysis, gradual practice. But Ati relies on direct recognition—rigpa knowing itself, without intermediary.

The difference: Other paths use mind to transform mind. Ati sees mind has no nature to transform. Other paths create virtue to destroy vice. Ati sees vice has no nature to destroy. Other paths attain Buddha-hood through effort. Ati recognizes Buddha-hood was never lost.

A wandering voice asks: What is direct recognition? It is knowing your own face before parents. You do not learn it—you recognize it. You do not practice it—you rest in it. You do not achieve it—it was always already there. The common vehicles teach this too, but with many words. Ati says: stop words. Look.

A clarifying voice analyzes: The phrase without intermediary is crucial. All other paths have intermediary—intermediate steps. You first understand, then practice, then achieve. Ati skips all steps because all steps are recognition already. The recognition is immediate because it is you yourself—no distance to travel, no time to wait.

[3971-3985]
The four elements as paths: earth as path of stable appearance, water as path of fluid clarity, fire as path of radiant warmth, wind as path of movement without center.

These are not four different practices—they are four aspects of one recognition. Earth: the stability of the nature, unchanging through all appearances. Water: the fluidity of the nature, responding to all situations without fixity. Fire: the heat of the nature, burning all confusion without fuel. Wind: the movement of the nature, arising spontaneously without controller.

A voice describes: In the tantras, the four elements are the four paths. Earth is the path of stability—when you rest in the unchanging nature, that is earth practice. Water is the path of clarity—when you see the nature as fluid and responsive, that is water practice. Fire is the path of transformation—when you burn through all concepts, that is fire practice. Wind is the path of spontaneity—when you allow all movements to arise and dissolve without control, that is wind practice.

A wandering voice observes: I sat in a cave for ten years practicing earth. The mountain was my meditation. Then I realized: I was the mountain practicing me. Then I moved to the river—water practice. Then I saw the sun—fire practice. Then I felt the wind—wind practice. Finally I understood: there was no practitioner and no practice. There was only the nature, appearing as all four.

[3986-4000]
The elements are not external forces—they are the very texture of awareness. When you recognize the nature, earth is wisdom of equality, water is mirror-like wisdom, fire is discriminating wisdom, wind is all-accomplishing wisdom.

The five wisdoms correspond to the five elements. Dharmadhatu wisdom is space—the ground of all. Mirror-like wisdom is water—reflecting without holding. Equality wisdom is earth—all equally the nature. Discriminating wisdom is fire—burning through distinctions. All-accomplishing wisdom is wind—spontaneous action.

The tradition cuts: The elements are not four things. They are one nature seen from four angles. When you rest in awareness, all four are present simultaneously. The practice is not to develop one over the other—it is to recognize all four as your own display.

[4001-4020]
Thus the elements become the path: through earth, you achieve stability of recognition; through water, clarity of recognition; through fire, warmth of recognition; through wind, spontaneity of recognition. All four are one—recognize the nature, and the elements serve the path.

A systematic voice details: The correspondence is precise. Earth (sa) corresponds to stability (gin), the unchanging ground. Water (chu) corresponds to clarity (sal), the reflecting quality. Me (fire) corresponds to warmth (drod), the transformative heat. Rlung (wind) corresponds to movement (gyu), the spontaneous display. When these are recognized as wisdom, they are no longer elements—they are the four kayas.

A bridging voice writes: Between the stark pointing of the ancient masters and the earthy stories of practitioners, we find this teaching. The elements are not obstacles to liberation—they are the very path of liberation. When you see the nature, the elements become wisdom. When you forget, wisdom becomes elements. The switch happens in recognition.

[4021-4040]
The practitioner uses the elements without grasping: not attached to stillness, not disturbed by movement, not seeking clarity, not fearing confusion. This is the middle way of the elements—not extremes of either side.

A wandering voice tells stories: I met a yogi who only practiced earth. He became very stiff—mentally and physically. Then I met a water yogi who became very slippery—nothing stuck to him, including virtue. Then I met a fire yogi who burned everything—friends, enemies, himself. Then I met a wind yogi who went crazy—running everywhere, talking to everyone. Finally I met a yogi who used all four elements naturally. He was just a person. Ordinary. That was the teaching.

An integrating voice dissolves: The four elements are one element—the element of awareness. The one element is zero elements—the nature beyond all categories. When you rest in that, even the distinction between elements and non-elements dissolves. This is what the texts mean by great completion.

[4041-4060]
Therefore: do not grasp at the elements as paths. Use them like a raft. Once across,—to cross the river leave the raft. The nature is the goal, not the method.

A wandering voice laughs: You think you need special elements? Your body is elements. Your breath is elements. Your mind is elements. Every moment of experience is elements. You cannot escape the elements—you can only recognize them. Recognition is the path. The elements are already the path.

The tradition points: See what is. The elements are not outside. They are your own display. The earth you stand on is your own ground. The water you drink is your own clarity. The fire that warms you is your own wisdom. The wind that moves you is your own spontaneity. Recognize this and the path is complete.

[4061-4080]
The completion of element practice: not practicing elements, not failing to practice, not distinguishing between practice and non-practice. This is the great seal—the seal of all phenomena as they are.

A sharp voice roars: WHAT SEAL? The seal is not a thing you apply. It is the recognition that everything is already complete. The great seal is not something you do—it is something you see. Every phenomenon already sealed with Buddha-hood. Every moment already complete. Stop looking for another seal.

A wandering voiceMy teacher showed me the great seal by Reflection appears, changes, vanishes. What reflects? a rock. I looked at the rock. He said: seal. I looked at my mind. He said: seal. I looked at the looking. He laughed. The looking was the seal. The seal was the looking. There was no difference. This is the great seal.

[4081-4100]
Thus ends the teaching on elements as path. Remember: the elements are not the goal—they are the method. Once recognized, even the method disappears. What remains is only the nature—the ground of all, the source of all, the completion of all.

A systematic voice summarizes: The elements as path is a teaching for those who need method. Eventually, even method is recognized as nature. The teaching progresses from elements to beyond elements, from path to beyond path, from recognition to beyond recognition. This progression is not temporal—it is logical. The student moves from grasping to non-grasping through the teaching.

A bridging voice concludes: Between the elaboration of common vehicles and the non-elaboration of Ati, there is Ati itself—the middle way that includes both. The elements are elaborated appearance; their nature is non-elaboration. Recognizing appearance as nature—this is the path of Ati. Not rejecting appearance, not grasping at nature. The two truths are one taste. The path is complete.

[4101-4120]
The treasury opens by revealing what was never closed. The elements were always the path. The path was always the nature. The nature was always you. Recognition is not gaining something new—it is seeing what was always present.

A wandering voice reflects: I have spoken of elements, paths, vehicles, recognitions. But all my speaking is just pointing. The finger Lightning illuminates the valley for an instant—the flash is not the storm. the moon. The cup holds, the liquid warms, the steam rises. Each Reflection appears, changes, vanishes. What reflects? comfort.. Do not even grasp the moon. See the seeing. That is the treasury. That is the path. That is the completion.

The tradition cuts: Three words. See what is. The treasury was never closed. The path was never long. The recognition was never distant. It is here. It is now. It is you. Stop reading. Look. The look is the treasure. The treasure is the look.

Emaho! The elements are the treasury. The treasury is the elements. Recognize this and you have understood the teaching of elements as path. Fail to recognize, and even mastering all four elements will not help. The choice is yours—moment by moment, breath by breath, in every perception. May all beings recognize the elements as path and the path as liberation.

Sarva Mangalam.

[4121-4140]
Now we enter the teaching on empowerment and samaya—the heart of Dzogchen transmission. Without proper empowerment, the teachings are mere intellectual knowledge. With empowerment, they become living wisdom.

A voice teaches: Empowerment is not something the guru gives you like a gift. It is the recognition that you already have the seed. The guru simply points out what was always present. The four empowerments are four ways of pointing to the same nature.

A systematic voice details: The first is body empowerment. This is not physical—it is the recognition that your body is the mandala, your breath is the recitation, your awareness is the deity. When you sit in meditation, body empowerment is complete. Not because you sit in a special way—but because you see the sitting as the display of awareness.

The second is speech empowerment. Speech arises from emptiness and returns to emptiness. When you understand this, every word you speak is mantra. Not special words—any words. The sound of speech is the sound of reality expressing itself. This is speech empowerment.

The third is mind empowerment. Mind has no color, no shape, no location. When you recognize this, every thought is wisdom. Not because thoughts become special—but because you see through them to their nature. This is mind empowerment.

The fourth is secret empowerment. This is the ultimate—recognizing that there was never any separation. The guru, the teachings, the student, the enlightenment—all one taste. No giver, no receiver, no gift. This is secret empowerment.

A sharp voice cuts: Empowerment is not a ceremony. The ceremony is a You visualize a deity—the image is not the wisdom.. When you see the moon, forget the finger. The empowerment happens in the moment of recognition—not in the ritual hall.

A clarifying voice explains: The Tibetan distinguishes empowerment as ripen and liberate. Ripening is the process—through practice, through devotion, through recognition, the seed matures. Liberation is the result—the moment when ripening completes, when you see the fruit was always ripe.

[4141-4160]
Now we turn to samaya—the commitments that preserve the empowerment. Samaya is not rules imposed from outside—it is the natural expression of recognition.

A wandering voiceMy guru gave me samaya. I asked: how many? He said: one. I asked: what is it? He said: don't forget. I asked: forget what? He laughed. The forgetting is the samaya. The remembering is the liberation. Between forgetting and remembering, there is the practitioner.

A systematic voice explains: The Tibetan describes samaya through negation. Not transgress through body. Not transgress through speech. Not transgress through mind. These three seem like restrictions. But they are descriptions of what happens when you recognize the nature—body naturally settles, speech naturally purifies, mind naturally opens.

A bridging voice writes: Between the stark instruction of the ancient masters and the stories of practitioners, we find the meaning. Samaya is not something you keep by effort. It is what remains when effort dissolves. The commitments are not chains—they are the natural state expressed.

A wandering voice asks: What is the root samaya? Some say it's the guru. Some say it's the yidam. Some say it's the dakinis. But actually—the root samaya is recognition itself. As long as you recognize, all samayas are kept. When you forget, all samayas are broken.

The tradition points: The key is not samaya-keeping—it is recognition. If you recognize every moment, you keep samaya automatically. If you forget, even the most elaborate rituals won't help. The ritual is training for recognition. The recognition is the end of ritual.

A clarifying voice analyzes: The Tibetan mentions samaya as the support for siddhi. Without samaya, siddhi cannot arise. This is not moralistic—it is practical. Samaya creates the container. Siddhi fills the container. No container, no filling. Simple.

[4161-4180]
Now we examine the teaching on instruction presentation—the four ways the guru introduces the nature.

A systematic voice details: The first is guide manner hit. The guru guides you by pointing directly. This is not explanation—it is demonstration. The guru shows you the nature by being the nature. You see it through the teacher's presence.

The second is introduction manner hit. This is explicit introduction—you are told directly: this is it. Not hinted, not suggested, but stated: awareness, empty, luminous—this is your nature. No ambiguity.

The third is guest challenge complete hit. This is the彻底 cutting pointing—through all concepts completely. The guru uses shock, paradox, direct assault on the mind to break through to recognition.

A wandering voice tells stories: My guru introduced me to the nature seventeen times. Each time I thought I understood. Each time I was wrong. Finally I stopped thinking I understood. That was the introduction.

The tradition cuts: The introduction is not information. It is transformation. If you receive the introduction and remain the same person, you did not receive the introduction. The introduction changes you at the root.

[4181-4200]
Now we distinguish preliminary and actual practice—the foundation and the core of Dzogchen meditation.

A bridging voice writes: The preliminary creates the conditions. The actual realizes the result. Without preliminary, actual has no foundation. Without actual, preliminary has no purpose. Both are necessary. But practitioners often mistake preliminary for actual.

A systematic voice explains: The Tibetan describes preliminary as going before fear. You prepare for the path like preparing for a difficult journey. You gather supplies, you train your body, you strengthen your mind. This is necessary but not sufficient.

The actual practice is described as fear not going—you do not avoid the terror of emptiness. When you meet the nature directly, there is fear. The preliminary helps you meet that fear without running. The actual practice is meeting it and not running.

A wandering voice laughs: I did ten thousand prostrations as preliminary. Then I realized—the prostration was the practice. The preliminary was the actual. The distinction was another elaboration. Every moment is practice. Every moment is preliminary. There is no division.

A wandering voice asks: What is the relationship between the two? They are not sequential—they are simultaneous. As you do preliminary, you are already practicing actual. As you rest in actual, you are completing preliminary. The division is pedagogical, not real.

A clarifying voice analyzes: The Tibetan mentions five distinctions. The preliminaries are: world beyond method, nirvana aim, three gates training, accumulation over eons, entering the supreme vessel. These are all preparation. But the actual—the recognition—is not separate from the preparation. The preparation IS the recognition, just unrecognized.

[4201-4220]
The five aspects of preliminary practice are taught: first, recognizing samsara and nirvana as equal; second, training in three gates; third, accumulating merit over countless eons; fourth, purifying obscurations; fifth, entering the supreme vehicle.

These are not five separate practices—they are five aspects of one turning toward liberation. When you see samsara and nirvana as equal, your attachments begin to loosen. When you train in body, speech, mind, you prepare the vessel. When you accumulate merit, you create conditions. When you purify, you remove obstacles. When you enter the supreme vehicle, you take the shortest path.

The tradition cuts: All these preliminaries are methods for those who cannot recognize directly. If you can recognize directly, you don't need preliminaries. But most of us cannot. So we use the preliminaries to prepare ourselves for the moment of recognition.

An integrating voice dissolves: Eventually, even the distinction between preliminary and actual dissolves. The practice becomes one—recognizing in every moment, in every situation, in every thought. This is what the texts call the unity of practice and realization.

[4221-4240]
Now we teach the actual practice—the direct entry into Dzogchen.

A systematic voice explains: The Tibetan describes the actual as self-substance possessing final arrival. This is not something you achieve—it is what you are. The practice is recognizing this, resting in this, becoming familiar with this.

The difference from preliminary: preliminary uses method to prepare. Actual uses no method—it is the nature recognizing itself. The preliminary has practitioner and practice. Actual has neither—it is pure recognition.

A wandering voiceIn actual practice, there is no meditator and nothing meditated. There is only awareness knowing itself. Sometimes this is called meditation, sometimes called rest, sometimes called recognition. But these are all names for the same thing—the mind seeing its own nature.

A clarifying voice explains: The Tibetan says actual practice has no pith—not because it lacks essence, but because it cannot be expressed. Anything you can express is preliminary. The actual is beyond expression. This is why we use pointing instructions, stories, metaphors—all preliminary attempts to point to what cannot be pointed to.

[4241-4260]
The four elements yoga as the actual practice: earth yoga, water yoga, fire yoga, wind yoga.

These are not physical practices—they are ways of resting in the nature. Earth yoga: rest in the stability that never changes. Water yoga: rest in the clarity that reflects everything. Fire yoga: rest in the warmth that transforms everything. Wind yoga: rest in the movement that is never separate from space.

A bridging voice writes: Between the elaborate descriptions and the direct pointing, we find the meaning. The four element yogas are training wheels for those who cannot rest in naked awareness. Eventually, even these four collapse into one—the yoga of awareness.

The tradition cuts: Elements are appearances. Appearances are mind. Mind is awareness. Awareness is you. Therefore, elements are you. Rest in this—you have practiced all four yogas. No need to do anything else.

A wandering voice reflects: When I practice earth yoga, I become very still. When I practice water yoga, I become very clear. When I practice fire yoga, I become very warm. When I practice wind yoga, I become very open. But these are all the same practice—resting in awareness. The names are different. The rest is the same.

[4261-4280]
The distinction between samsara and nirvana: boundary divide non—this is the key Dzogchen teaching.

A systematic voice explains: The Tibetan says samsara and nirvana have no boundary. This is not metaphorical—it is literal. Where is the line between samsara and nirvana? Show me the place where one ends and the other begins. You cannot. Because there is no boundary. There never was.

A wandering voice tells stories: I searched for the boundary between samsara and nirvana for thirty years. I looked in meditation, in scriptures, in every state of mind. Finally I found—there is no boundary. I laughed for three days. Then I stopped laughing. The boundary was my search.

The tradition cuts: The boundary is conceptual. Concepts create samsara. Seeing through concepts is nirvana. But the seeing-through is also conceptual. Eventually, even this dissolves. What remains? No samsara, no nirvana, no boundary, no seeing-through. Just what is.

A clarifying voice analyzes: The Tibetan mentions three realms—form, formless, desire. These are divisions of samsara. But Dzogchen says: these three realms are the three kayas. Samsara is nirvana, seen correctly. The transformation is not in the realms—in the seeing.

[4281-4300]
The conclusion: the path of Dzogchen is direct recognition. Not gradual like other vehicles. Not through many practices. Just recognition—moment to moment, breath to breath, in every situation.

The treasury is the nature itself. The path is recognizing the nature. The result is the nature recognized. There is nothing to add, nothing to remove, nothing to achieve. Everything is already complete.

A wandering voice reflects: I have taught you many things—elaboration-free meaning, seven pith instructions, four elements, empowerments, samaya, preliminary and actual, the boundary between samsara and nirvana. But all of these are A doorway frames the view—the frame is not the mountain.. Do not Recollection A doorway frames the view—the frame is not the mountain. experience, but is not the experiencing.s. Do not even grasp the moon. See the seeing. That is the treasury. That is the path. That is the completion.

The tradition cuts: Three words. See what is. The treasury was never closed. The path was never long. The recognition was never distant. It is here. It is now. It is you. Stop reading. Look. The look is the treasure. The treasure is the look. This is the final teaching.

Emaho! The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle has revealed its depths. All beings possess Buddha-hood. All moments contain liberation. Recognize this and you are as all the great masters were—not different, not separate, not distant. The nature is your nature. The recognition is your recognition. The treasury is your treasury.

Sarva Mangalam. May all beings recognize the Treasury and be liberated.
