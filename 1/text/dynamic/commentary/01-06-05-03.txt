Third joy—bliss, mind and wisdom stirred. Bde ba, supreme joy where
sems and ye shes are 'khrug pa—stirred together like milk and honey,
distinct yet inseparable. Not ordinary pleasure, not ordinary bliss, but
the bliss of recognition.

This wanderer once confused this with physical ecstasy. Sought peak

Stirred together—not blended into undifferentiated mush, but dancing
as distinct yet inseparable. Like fire and heat, like water and wetness.
You cannot have one without the other, yet they are not the same.

[1-1]
Stirred together. Bliss recognized. Union complete. Three words, but really
it's the First Point again—recognize, rest, return. Here, return is the
continuous stirring.

[1-1]
Experience. The third joy is experience itself—mind and wisdom stirring
in every moment of recognition. Mix. Rest. The stirring continues, but
you are no longer stirred. You are the stirring itself.
