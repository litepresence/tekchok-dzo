[8675] Voice 10 (Longchenpa):
Third joy—bliss itself. Mind and wisdom stirred together like milk and honey.
The time of stirring—this is crucial. Not too fast, not too slow.
The dakini's spoon moves in circles, and in each circle, a universe dissolves and is born.

[8675] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje):
Recognize immediately.
What is mind? A child of conditions. What is wisdom? Mind's own nature.
When they meet—ah! Like two mirrors facing each other, infinite reflections.
But look closer—no images, only light.

[8675] Voice 13 (Patrul):
Stirred, stirred, stirred—like porridge on the fire! Too hot, it burns. Too cold, it doesn't cook.
This third bliss—they want to stay here forever, these young practitioners.
"Oh, the bliss! Oh, the rapture!" they moan. Fools! It's just the porridge boiling.
Take it off the fire before it burns the pot.

[8675] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava):
The stirring of mind and wisdom is the union of method and wisdom.
The male deity embraces the female, and their ecstasy shakes the three thousand worlds.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
But look—where is the embracer? Where the embraced?
In the stirring, find stillness. In the union, find solitude.

[8675] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi):
I was churning butter this morning. Round and round, the stick turning in the milk.
At first—nothing. Then—ripple. Then—thickening. Finally—golden butter!
This third joy is like that. The stirring of mind and wisdom—keep churning, but don't get attached to the butter.

[8675] Voice 02 (Systematizer):
Thus. We proceed.
The stirring—kshobha—indicates the activation of subtle energies.
Mind—citta—conventional consciousness. Wisdom—jnana—primordial knowing.
Precise analysis: during this phase, bindu descends and ascends, creating the experience of melting bliss.

[8675] Voice 16 (Essence Holder):
Let it stir. Let it settle.
The third joy is like a lake after a stone has been thrown—ripples expanding outward.
Do not chase the ripples to the shore. Let them dissolve on their own. The lake remains.

[8675] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced):
STIRRED? YOU CALL THIS STIRRED? I will show you stirring! *earthquake sounds*
When the lion stirs, mountains crumble! When wisdom stirs, minds shatter!
Recognition is immediate.
