Fourth, the extensive explanation of enumerations—from the five: kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity. The nature is complete.

Kaya: appearing as whatever form beings believe in, each one's portion, marks and signs complete.

Speech: sixty branches' melodious sound, well-connected.

Mind: knowing how things are and how many, expansive.

Qualities: all dharmas of powers and so forth, knowing perfectly complete.

Enlightened activity: turning the Dharma wheel of five perfections, nature of outer, inner, secret three.

From the Thalgyur:

"Nirmanakaya also: kaya, speech, mind,
Qualities and enlightened activity, five aspects. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Kaya marks and signs,
Whatever trainees arise, body emanation. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Speech word-connection good,
Brahma's expanse sixty branches. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle vast oceanic completion. Never closed. Never opened. Simply what is.

Mind by wisdom of knowables,
Abiding in intention of twofold benefit. Logical analysis: if liberation were gradual, it would be compounded. But recognition is uncompounded. Immediate.

Qualities knowing perfectly complete,
Enlightened activity outer, inner, secret,
All activities perfectly complete,
Abide as five perfections.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Why wait even a moment! The distinction burns in recognition! The maker dissolves NOW!"

This is the complete description of enlightened manifestation—not just form, but speech, mind, qualities, and activity. All five are spontaneously present, naturally complete.

[1-202]
Outer five perfections:
- Perfect place: Vulture Peak Mountain
- Perfect teacher: Shakyamuni
- Perfect Dharma: various vehicles
- Perfect retinue: common and uncommon
- Perfect time: at the time of hundred-year lifespan Rest in this understanding.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Inner five perfections:
- Perfect place: Akanistha
- Perfect teacher: Vajradhara
- Perfect retinue: dakinis, siddhas, bodhisattvas
- Perfect Dharma: secret mantra outer and inner dharmas
- Perfect time: time of conditions, karma, and fortune meeting

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Secret five perfections:
- Perfect place: charnel ground, blazing fire mountain
- Perfect teacher: Youthful Hero Powerful
- Perfect retinue: dakinis and so forth

Diamond ground indestructible path. Never departed. Piercing clarity of unity.

These describe the three levels of teaching: outer (sutra), inner (tantra), and secret (dzogchen). Each has its own context, its own teacher form, its own audience, its own Dharma, its own timing.

The key insight: the Buddha doesn't just teach one way. The teaching appears according to what's needed, where it's needed, when it's needed. This is the skillful means of enlightenment.

But don't get confused thinking these are separate teachings. They're all the same wisdom, appearing in different forms for different capacities. The essence is always the same—recognize your own nature!

Emaho! Five perfections, three levels, one wisdom!

[1-202]
Dharma perfectly complete, nature Great Perfection, Secret Unexcelled Tantra essence seven—spoken at the time perfectly complete, the time of pure self-conditions. By this indicator, know that for all teacher nirmanakayas, outer, inner, and secret perfections exist as fivefold.

This is describing the conditions under which the Dharma is taught—when all factors are perfect: the teacher, the teaching, the time, the place, the audience. These aren't arbitrary; they're the spontaneous display of wisdom when conditions align.

[1-202]
Second, the extensive explanation of the individual abodes of wisdom—three. Essence: self-nature of self-awareness, free from elaborations. From the Thalgyur:

"From concept-free dharma-nature self-sound,
Objectless wisdom appearance arises." The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

I catalogued the treasury's contents. Then forgot: who was cataloguing? The library was never closed.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Definitive terminology also from that:

"Wisdom first arising,
By knowing, afflictions' faults purified." ROAR! IMMEDIATE! Cut through gradualism! NOW! Liberation! AH!

Dancing ground! Path is dance itself! Never departed! Sky dancing!

This is the key insight: Wisdom isn't something you acquire; it's something you recognize. It's already present as the nature (rang bzhin) of your own awareness. When you recognize it, afflictions are naturally purified—not through force, but through seeing their true nature.

[1-202]
Divided into three: Dharmakaya wisdom abiding in the basis; Sambhogakaya wisdom possessing its own characteristics; Nirmanakaya all-pervading wisdom. The nature is complete.

I mapped all paths. Then forgot: the ground was never mapped. Never departed from.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

First, essence, nature, compassion—three. Essence primordially pure wisdom: awareness empty-luminous, stainless, ultimate, dharmakaya free from elaborations' extremes, nature of twofold pure expanse, abiding as basis of arising of inseparable three kayas.

Nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom: clear depth, light basis of arising, abiding—pure realms, palaces, light rays and so forth appear, fulfilling trainees' hopes.

Compassion all-pervading wisdom: at its own time, elaborations completely pacified, no conventional terminology of entering objects, yet abiding as basis of arising of all knowing wisdoms. From the state of great spontaneous expanse and wisdom, unmoving, without wavering, effortless exertion, seeds of beings' twofold benefit arise.

From the Longchenpa's Six Spaces:

"By essence primordially pure wisdom,
Separation from non-recognition's stain.
By nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom,
Separation from confusion's word-harm.
By compassion all-pervading wisdom,
All appears connected in one expanse."

This is the complete description of dharmakaya wisdom—three aspects, one nature. Primordially pure is the essence. Spontaneously accomplished is the nature (rang bzhin). All-pervading compassion is the display.

Without the portion of dharmakaya emptiness' wisdom abiding in the basis, basis of arising or seed-like portion, Buddha, non-recognition awakened, upward cut off.

This is vital! Without recognizing this dharmakaya wisdom that's already present, you can't progress on the path. It's the foundation, the seed, the basis of everything.

Emaho! Three wisdoms, one nature, complete!

[1-202]
Listen carefully! Sentient beings, wandering in confusion through samsara, are cut off from the lower realms. From the unsuitability of tamer and tamed, from the wisdom abiding in the basis, they appear as external manifestation. Arising as beings' benefit throughout samsara's duration—this comes from the natural force of compassion, clear depth of knowing awareness perfect and complete.

From the Thalgyur:

"From dharmakaya emptiness' nature,
Wisdom knowing perfectly complete,
By force appears to sentient beings.
Without this, samsara-nirvana cut off—
Knowing awareness clear.

From self-knowing clear self-nature,
Natural force of compassion itself,
Not ceasing, without cessation."

The text translates what was never foreign. Completion before language.

This is the profound mystery! Compassion isn't something the Buddha creates or generates. It's the natural radiance, the spontaneous expression of the wisdom mind. Like light radiating from the sun without the sun "trying" to shine. The wisdom basis naturally appears as benefit for beings.

Without this force of compassion, samsara and nirvana would be cut off—there would be no connection between the ultimate nature and relative appearance. But because this wisdom-compassion is spontaneously present, the benefit of beings appears naturally, effortlessly!

[1-202]
Second, the five wisdoms of sambhogakaya: possessing their own individual characteristics. For Vairochana, dharmadhatu wisdom is primary, the other four as retinue. For Akshobhya, mirror wisdom is primary. For Ratnasambhava, sameness. For Amitabha, discriminating. For Amoghasiddhi, all-accomplishing wisdom is primary—the remaining four as retinue for each. Thus twenty-five wisdoms, and from dividing those, immeasurable. Gathered, they condense into five.

From the Self-Arisen:

"Wisdom divisions thus:
From twenty-five essences,
Gathered, condense into five aspects."

The journey translates into what was never foreign. Ground itself.

ROAR! Ground itself! Path never walked! Cut through seeking! NOW!

How do they condense? From the Thalgyur:

"Sambhogakaya wisdoms possess characteristics,
Mirror—because pure actual objects,
Clear reflections of samsara-nirvana.
Sameness—because without direction/border.
Discriminating—shows sense-fields' objects.
All-accomplishing—not by effort.
Dharmadhatu—because without difference."

This is the mandala of wisdom! Each Buddha family has its primary wisdom and four supporting wisdoms. Five times five equals twenty-five. But it doesn't stop there—these can be subdivided infinitely, or gathered back into the five.

The key insight: these aren't separate things. Mirror wisdom reflects everything clearly without judgment. Sameness wisdom sees the equality of all phenomena. Discriminating wisdom knows the details. All-accomplishing wisdom acts without effort. Dharmadhatu wisdom is the space in which all appear.

They're all aspects of your own awareness! Stop thinking wisdom is something distant or difficult. It's the nature (rang bzhin) of your own mind.

[1-202]
Third, the two wisdoms of nirmanakaya: entering to pervade all knowables. Knowing however many are included in appearance. Knowing however things are included in emptiness. Knowing all relative phenomena distinctly, without mixing, teaching according to the faculties, elements, and latent tendencies of immeasurable gatherings of trainees.

This is how the Buddha works in the world—not with one method, but with infinite skillful means. Knowing what each being needs, how they understand, what their capacity is, and teaching accordingly. This isn't effortful; it's the natural display of wisdom-compassion.

Emaho! The three kayas, the wisdoms, the compassion—all complete!

[1-202]
Knowing the ultimate dharma-nature—emptiness, marklessness, luminosity—manifests the Dharma. Recognition is immediate.

It is not that the path is illusory. It is that the path and ground are not two. Precise recognition reveals unity.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. This also from the Thalgyur:

"On nirmanakaya, knowables—
Knowing how things are,
Knows the natural state as own purpose.
Knowing how many,
Knows however trainees' minds abide.

Thus from compassion's manner of arising,
For trainees' various migrations,
Taming kayas are just that much."

Thus.

Here's the profound point: Nirmanakaya isn't separate from knowing. The emanation body appears based on knowing the natural state (how things truly are) and knowing trainees' minds (what they need). The taming kayas appear spontaneously from compassion, not from effort or contrivance.

This means the forms in which the Buddha appears—whatever forms benefit beings—are not fixed. They appear based on what needs to be tamed. Don't get attached to thinking the Buddha looks a certain way!

[1-202]
The meaning of these wisdoms gathered in the three kayas, clearly summarized: Rest in this understanding.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

To such a Buddha, in the condition of dharmakaya, three wisdoms complete in the basis:
Essence primordially pure wisdom,
Nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom,
Compassion all-pervading wisdom—
Without characteristics divided into types,
From awareness' clear portion, force or power,
Makes the basis of arising of knowing.

One without learning... walked thousands of miles. Then rested. The ground was always beneath me.

Contemporary mind makes distinctions. Contemporary recognition sees through. Direct. Immediate.

In the condition of sambhogakaya, the five wisdoms possessing characteristics are clear individually:
Dharmadhatu,
Mirror-like,
Sameness,
Discriminating,
All-accomplishing wisdoms—
Not object and subject, but close self-clear appearance.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

At the time of nirmanakaya, two knowing wisdoms abide:
Knowing how things are and knowing how many. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

These two also, with action and actor, are not—
Knowing in the manner of effortless spontaneous accomplishment.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Thus, the three wisdoms possessed by the Buddha's three kayas:
From the perspective of knowing the two—appearance and emptiness—of knowables appearing externally to nirmanakaya, all-knowing wisdom of dharma's nature peace; from the perspective of knowing self-clear appearance of sambhogakaya's close self-appearance luminosity-wisdom's knowables, all-knowing wisdom; dharmakaya inner-clear essence abiding wisdom portion merely making basis of arisOne who walked paths...gabond walked thousands of miles. Then rested. The ground was always beneath me.

This is sophisticated Dzogchen cosmology. Let me break it down simply:

- **Dharmakaya wisdom**: The basis, primordially pure, spontaneously present, all-pervading compassion. This is your own nature.
- **Sambhogakaya wisdom**: The five wisdoms that appear as light, as clarity, as the mandala of deities. This is the display of your nature.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.
- **Nirmanakaya wisdom**: The two knowings—knowing reality and knowing what beings need. This is how your nature benefits others.

They're not separate! They're three aspects of the same wisdom. When you recognize your own awareness, you recognize all three. Stop dividing them!

Emaho! Three kayas, three wisdoms, one nature!

[1-202]
In the expanse of one's own primordially pure ground, self-knowing clarity—abiding in the portion of pure expanse. Rest in this understanding.

It is not that the treasury opens. It is that the perception of closure dissolves. Precision reveals what was never obscured.

 From the Sgron ma snang byed (Lamp Illuminating):

"To the perfect Buddha,
There are three wisdoms:
All-aspect knowing,
All-knowing wisdom,
Wisdom abiding in the basis.

I have memorized all distinctions. Then I forgot: who was memorizing? The library dissolves into spaciousness.

Between the distinction and the distinguisher, vast space opens. No separation.

Two wisdoms of nirmanakaya:
Knowing how things abide—knows the natural state,
Knowing how many—other-benefit.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Wisdom of sambhogakaya close by:
Luminosity self-appearance, knowables clear. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Wisdom of dharmakaya abiding in the basis:
Knowing portion makes clear,
No grasping, awareness-conceptuality.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Spontaneous force of compassion.
Clear and knowing, possessed of awareness,
Abiding without mixing with During my wandering years...old vagabond walked thousands of miles. Then rested. The ground was always beneath me.

This is essential! Three wisdoms:

1. **All-aspect knowing** (*rnam pa thams cad mkhyen pa*) - knowing all phenomena in all their aspects
2. **All-knowing wisdom** (*thams cad mkhyen pa'i ye shes*) - knowing the nature (rang bzhin) of all things 
3. **Wisdom abiding in the basis** (*gzhi la gnas pa'i ye shes*) - primordial wisdom that never moved

Then for nirmanakaya, two wisdoms: knowing the natural state (how things are) and knowing what needs to be done for beings (how many things there are).

Sambhogakaya wisdom is the luminosity, the clear appearance of knowables.

Dharmakaya wisdom is beyond grasping, beyond conceptuality—spontaneous compassion.

These aren't separate things! They're all aspects of your own awareness. Right now, you have the capacity to know. That's wisdom. Don't look for it somewhere else!

[1-202]
Third, the meaning gathering of the five—kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity—twofold: essence briefly shown, and nature extensively explained. Rest in this understanding.

 First:

Thus, if all dharmas of the Buddha-ground are gathered: kaya inexhaustible ornament wheel, appearing with form-kaya marks and signs clear; dharmakaya possessing the nature (rang bzhin) of all elaborations completely pacified; speech inexhaustible ornament wheel, with inconceivable Dharma wheels; mind inexhaustible ornament wheel, abandonment and realization nature measureless, clairvoyance inconceivable, essence of oceanic samadhi like the great ocean; qualities inexhaustible ornament wheel, ten powers, four fearlessnesses, measureless great compassion, mindfulness and so forth; enlightened activity inexhaustible ornament wheel, spontaneously accomplishing twofold benefit for all beings pervading the reaches of space.

Just this much alone, all enumerations of dharmas of the Buddha-ground are included—know this!

Look at this! This is what Buddhahood actually is—not some far-off goal, but the inexhaustible display of your own nature. The form body with its marks, the speech that teaches, the mind of wisdom, the qualities that benefit, the activities that help beings—all spontaneously present, never exhausted, never ending.

This isn't something you need to build up. It's something you need to recognize. Right now, in your own experience, these five are present. The ground of your being IS the Buddha-ground. Stop looking elsewhere!

As it is said.

Emaho! All dharmas are complete!

[1-202]
From the Senge Tsal Dzogchen Gyud, the Tantra of Lion Power Great Perfection: Rest in this understanding.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The text translates what was never foreign. Completion before language.

"The kayas of the Buddhas,
Speech and mind mandala,
Qualities and enlightened activity—
Appear as five."

Thus it is taught.

This is the summary verse. Everything that appears from a Buddha—the forms, the speech, the mind, the qualities, the activities—all five are spontaneously present. Not created, not made, not cultivated. Naturally manifesting.

[1-202]
Second, the detailed divisions of the five—kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity. First, regarding kaya: essence, definitive terminology, division into three. The essence of kaya: whatever is the Buddha-ground's support, without change or transformation.
