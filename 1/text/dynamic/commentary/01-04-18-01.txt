[3888-3888]
First: Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground. Action free from good and bad, the three realms' complete liberation. Through self-nature's emptiness arising in all aspects—action, virtue, and non-virtue not abandoned—buddhas and sentient beings do not exist.

Through characteristic not established as words or letters, the dharma of all vehicles—through non-transcendence—is the essential point of the single sovereign's path.

[3888-3888]
Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground—like space pervading all without being any thing. Action free from good and bad—not that good and bad don't appear, but their essence is empty. The three realms liberated—not destroyed, but seen through.

Buddhas and sentient beings do not exist ultimately—yet they appear. Through self-nature's emptiness, virtue and non-virtue also empty. Not abandoned through rejection, but through seeing their nature.

Not established as words or letters—yet the dharma of all vehicles is the essential point. The single sovereign's path: one path, many vehicles.

[3888-3888]
A practitioner. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Like a dream where you try to be moral. The dream-virtue and dream-vice—both empty upon waking. Yet in the dream, they matter.

Buddhas and sentient beings don't exist ultimately. But relatively? The Buddha's compassion appears. Sentient beings' suffering appears. Work with appearances, knowing their nature.

[3888-3888]
See what is. Rest in recognition. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Unelaborated essence-ground. Action free from good and bad. Three realms' complete liberation.

Not established as words or letters. Essential point of single sovereign's path.

[3888-3888]
Slash through hesitation. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Two divisions: view clinging to appearance and concept—non-arising. Investigation of mind's realization—all doubts released.

First: Through essence being without dharma, even the name of buddha does not exist. Through self-nature radiating as energy, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa appear as the view. Through characteristic not established as one, view and meditation are without measure.

[3888-3888]
SUDDEN. Investigation of mind's realization! What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Second: Through essence being unproduced and completely purified, afflictions are self-liberated. Through self-nature being unceasing and pervasively arising, acceptance and rejection do not exist at all. Through characteristic being causeless and self-liberated, the path of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is exhausted.

Afflictions self-liberated! Acceptance and rejection non-existent! Path exhausted!

[3888-3888]
Through the essence of gtar-ka's obstacle-clearing, the essential point of dharmatā is clarified. At the boundary of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa: through self-nature being unobstructed, the ground (gzhi)-basis is without the stain of ignorant mind.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. Through characteristic being causeless and the basis being pure, confusion is self-pacified.

Two divisions: removal of obstacles in the heat and clarity of view and meditation; removal of obstacles in the manner of abiding of phenomena.

The heat of view is the connection between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. When view moves, the dharmatā of cyclic existence settles as the non-dual equality of movement and stillness.

[3888-3888]
At the time of view's attainment, heat arises in body and speech—like fire blazing in wood. This is the treasury's heart.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

At the time of view's stability, the distinction between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is—like an army conquering a fortress.

At the time of meditation's movement, wind and mind are gathered—like entering the treasure-house of the body's channels.

At the time of meditation's attainment, mind enters the path—like a wild boar being tamed.

At the time of meditation's stability, the strength of awareness is found—like the royal lineage bestowing empowerment from the universal sovereign.

[3888-3888]
At the time of conduct's movement, the distant reach of knowing, with heart-wind rising—like a garuḍa's complete wings or a companion flying into the sky. Rest in this understanding.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

At the time of conduct's stability, the heat and clarity of the three bodies is attained—like the absorption of Brahmā.

Also, through conduct, appearance is purified, so the dharmatā of appearance and conditions is without path of effort.

[3888-3888]
Break through. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Through removal of obstacles in meditation's movement: the path of recollection, samādhi, and concentration is without path of effort.

Through removal of obstacles in view's dharmatā: the path of buddhahood beyond reliance on phenomena is without path of effort.

Through removal of obstacles in the manner of abiding of phenomena: the essence of dharmatā is without fabrication—whatever appears, mind does not conceptualize!

[3892]
The path without path. Effort without effort. Obstacles removed not by doing, but by seeing through.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Like ice melting in spring—not destroyed, but returning to its nature.
 The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.
