[3888-3892] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First: vital-point wind in channels, mind focused through instruction. From dharmata's source, activity of averting harm. Essential point: severing debate between buddhas and sentient beings. Wind vital-point descends into body—severing connection between body and mind. Root wind exhausted—arising's self-liberation.

[3888-3892] Voice 13 (Patrul): Four key points. Wind in channels, mind focused. Debate between buddhas and beings—severed. Body-mind connection—cut. Root wind exhausted—movement liberated.

[3888-3892] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Focus. Sever. Liberate.

[Final] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Four points. Wind. Mind. Sever. Liberate.

Emaho!
