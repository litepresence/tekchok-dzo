First: vital-point wind in channels, mind focused through instruction. From dharmakaya's source, activity of averting harm. Essential point: severing debate between buddhas and sentient beings.

Wind vital-point descends into body—severing connection between body and mind. Root wind exhausted—arising's self-liberation. Four key points that cut through the root of samsara.

A simple practitioner... once tried to force his winds through channels like water through a blocked pipe. He strained, he pushed, he visualized intensely. Finally exhausted, he let go. The wind moved naturally, the mind settled spontaneously. The forcing was the only obstacle.

Four key points. Wind in channels, mind focused. Debate between buddhas and beings—severed. Body-mind connection—cut. Root wind exhausted—movement liberated.

Mountain hermit watched the wind move through the valley below his cave. It didn't force its way through narrow passes—it found the natural opening. Your winds are like this. Don't force them. Let them find their natural course.

Direct. Immediate. Certain.

Between the effort of forcing and the relaxation of natural flow, we find the middle way. Not loose, not tight. Not wandering, not rigid. The wind moves, the mind watches, the connection severs itself.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why make this complicated? The wind is already moving! The mind is already aware! Stop interfering and let liberation happen!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you walk Amne Machin path, while you feel the wind on your face, remember—the same wind moves in your channels. The same awareness knows both.

Final instruction: the four vital points are not techniques to master. They are descriptions of what happens when you stop interfering. Wind descends naturally. Mind focuses spontaneously. Body and mind separate effortlessly. Movement liberates itself. Rest in that recognition.

Emaho! The wonder of wind's natural movement, mind's natural awareness, liberation's natural dawning.
