First, the ground—the dimension of primordial purity. The basis that is pure from the beginning, spontaneously present, never stained.

In my travels searched everywhere for purity! Found it was never lost.

See your nature. Primordially pure. Complete.

The ground cannot be found—already present!

Two aspects: seven bases presentation, supreme basis explanation.

The ground you seek is the seeking itself. Rest.
