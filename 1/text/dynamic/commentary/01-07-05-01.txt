[10471-10471] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, the ground—the dimension of primordial purity. The basis that is pure from the beginning, spontaneously present, never stained.

[10471-10471] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old fool searched everywhere for purity! Found it was never lost.

[10471-10471] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): See your nature. Primordially pure. Complete.

[10471-10471] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): The ground cannot be found—already present!

[10471-10471] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Two aspects: seven bases presentation, supreme basis explanation.

[10471-10471] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The ground you seek is the seeking itself. Rest.
