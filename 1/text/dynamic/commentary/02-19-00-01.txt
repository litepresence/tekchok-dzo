[1-451]
Dharma exhausted, mind transcended—this is not nihilism but completion. When all
 Dharmas have been exhausted, when mind itself is seen through, what remains is not
 nothing but the vast expanse beyond all categories. Here we enter the territory where
 even the path is left behind, where practice itself dissolves into recognition.

[1-451]
Beyond bondage, beyond liberation—beyond even the duality of beyond/not-beyond.
This is the Great Perfection in its natural state, not something to achieve but the nature
 of whatever appears. Like sky, it cannot be grasped. Like space, it accommodates all
 without being affected.

[1-451]
Three aspects: the nature itself, the resolution of samsara-nirvana duality, the
pervasion of all appearances. Not stages to traverse but perspectives on what is already
complete. The practitioner who understands these three understands everything. The
practitioner who misses these three misses everything, no matter how many hours they
sit.

[1-451]
Outer appearances, inner awareness, the between where grasping occurs—all gathered
into Dzogchen's vast equality. Primordially empty, universally empty, great emptiness.
Not the emptiness of absence but the emptiness that is full presence without limitation.

[1-451]
This old fool spent years seeking the experience of emptiness. He found it—and lost
it—and found it again. Finally he understood: the seeking itself was the obstacle. The
emptiness he sought was the nature of the seeker. Exhaust all Dharmas, and what
exhausts them is also exhausted. This is completion.

[1-451]
Appearance-emptiness great, mind-emptiness great, purity-emptiness great,
liberation-emptiness great. Four great emptinesses, one great recognition. Appearance
empty of inherent existence, mind empty of grasping, purity empty of distinction,
liberation empty of what needed liberating. Empty, empty, empty—yet luminous,
present, aware.

[1-451]
Not experienced as existent, not experienced as non-existent. Not experienced as true,
not experienced as false. Beyond the four extremes, beyond the eight collections,
beyond the hundred negations. This is not agnosticism but certainty—certainty that
certainty itself is empty.

[1-451]
Equal-vast, pervading-pervade, exist-nonexist direction-vast, have-not-have
appearance-vast. These are not mere words but attempts to point to what cannot be
pointed. The vastness that pervades all directions without being anywhere. The
equality that includes all distinctions without becoming confused.

[1-451]
Not moving, equal-vast. Spontaneous, primordial-vast. Natural equality, ground-vast.
Wide, pervading, awakened, liberated, exhausted, empty. These words exhaust
themselves as they speak. The vastness they describe cannot be contained in words
any more than sky can be contained in a jar.

[1-451]
Not established, not dwelling, not accepting, not going, not coming, not thinking, not
examining, not meditating, not changing. Twelve negations, twelve liberations. Each
negation cuts a strand of the net that binds. Cut all twelve, and the net dissolves—
revealing there was no net, no one bound, no binding.

[1-451]
Previously, delusion was not experienced. Now, delusion has no ground. Finally,
delusion is impossible. Three times of purity—not that delusion was purified, but that it
was never delusion. Like realizing the rope was never a snake, the freedom is not
from something but recognition of what never was.

[1-451]
Previously, liberation was not experienced. Now, liberation does not enter. Finally,
liberation is impossible. If there is nothing bound, what could be liberated? The very
concept of liberation implies bondage. Exhaust both concepts, and rest in what
precedes them.

[1-451]
Previously, no passing. Now, no dwelling. Finally, no arising. Three times transcended,
not sequentially but simultaneously. No passing into nirvana, no dwelling in samsara,
no future arising to fear. The past exhausted, present groundless, future impossible—
time itself seen through.

[1-451]
Without category, pervading-awakened, empty. Natural condition without ground.
Natural way without path. Natural liberation without result. No view or meditation's
name. No direction-category's Dharma. No have-not-have's extreme. No sky's expanse.
Sevenfold exhaustion—not destruction but recognition.

[1-451]
Beyond effort, primordially awakened. Beyond view-meditation, naturally awakened.
Beyond focus-thought, liberated-awakened. Direction-vast nameless awakened—this is
the rolling, the vast expanse where all concepts dissolve. Not meditated but
recognized. Not achieved but revealed.

[1-451]
Nothing to view, nothing viewed. No viewer. Viewing does not see. Nothing to
meditate, nothing meditated. Beyond meditation. Even if meditated, no liberation.
Nothing to analyze, nothing analyzed. No need to analyze. Analysis is futile effort.
Nothing to accomplish—already accomplished. Nothing to do.

[1-451]
This is not passivity but complete engagement. Not nihilism but fullness beyond
concept. Not escape from life but life without resistance. The exhausted mind does not
stop functioning—it functions without grasping. The transcended Dharma does not
disappear—it appears as what it always was.

[1-451]
Mountain hermit sat for forty years without moving. When asked what he practiced, he
said: "I practiced not practicing. I meditated on non-meditation. I accomplished
non-accomplishment." Fools thought him mad. The wise saw completion itself sitting by
the stream.

[1-451]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: stop seeking what you already possess! The
Dharma you exhaust is not outside you—it is your own conceptual mind. Exhaust it,
and what remains is not nothing but everything, not emptiness but fullness, not
absence but presence beyond presence/absence.

[1-451]
Between the vast view of Longchenpa and the direct pointing of this wandering fool,
we find the middle way of exhaustion. Not rejecting practice, not grasping
non-practice. The ocean holds all waves while remaining undisturbed. The exhausted
Dharma contains all Dharmas while being free from all.

[1-451]
Final secret: exhaustion is not an achievement but recognition. The Dharma was
always exhausted—empty from the beginning, free from the start. What needed
exhausting? Only the belief that something needed to be exhausted. See through this,
and the Treasury is complete.

[1-451]
Emaho! The wonder of Dharma exhausted, mind transcended. What teaching remains?
What practice continues? What result is sought? Rest in this exhaustion, and the
Supreme Vehicle has carried you to the place you never left. The Jewel Treasure
reveals itself as your own nature—primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally
exhausted.

[1-451]
A wandering practitioner... leaves you with what he was given: the path is exhausted, the fruit
is revealed. Do not seek further. Do not add more. Subtract everything, including the
subtractor, and what remains is what always was. This is Dzogchen's completion. This
is the Treasury's heart. This is your own face before parents were born.

[1-451]
COMPREHENSIVE EXPANSION - DEEPENING EXHAUSTION TEACHING:

The Weaver's Final Unraveling:
Thread by thread, the fabric is unwoven. Not destroyed—returned to original
threads. The Dharma is like this. Teaching by teaching, practice by practice,
all unwoven until only awareness remains. Not nothing. The threads are still
there. But no fabric, no pattern, no weaving. Just threads. Just awareness.

This old weaver spent decades creating beautiful fabrics. Complex patterns,
intricate designs. Finally she unwove them all. The threads returned to basket.
The basket returned to emptiness. But the emptiness was full. Full of potential.
Full of threads waiting to be woven. Full of awareness waiting to display.

[1-451]
The Hot Spring's Complete Dissolution:
Water dissolves minerals, carries them, deposits them, returns to pure water.
The Dharma dissolves confusion, carries wisdom, deposits recognition, returns
to pure awareness. The minerals are not destroyed—they are transformed. The
confusion is not destroyed—it is recognized as wisdom. The exhaustion is not
annihilation—it is completion.

[1-451]
The Mani Wall's Scattered Stones:
Stone by stone, the wall is taken down. Each mantra released. Each blessing
spread. The wall served its purpose. Now it returns to stones. Not destroyed—
redistributed. The Dharma is like this. Teaching by teaching, the structure is
dismantled. The blessings remain. The awareness remains. But no wall. No
separation. No boundary between sacred and ordinary.

[1-451]
the crystal cave's Collapsed Roof:
the crystal cave that sheltered for years collapses. Light enters everywhere. No more
walls. No more ceiling. No more floor. Just light. The Dharma is like this.
The structure that supported practice collapses. The supports are seen through.
The walls were never solid. The ceiling was never there. Just awareness. Just
light.

[1-451]
The Juniper Smoke's Complete Dispersal:
Smoke rises, spreads, disperses, becomes indistinguishable from air. The Dharma
is like this. Teachings rise, spread, exhaust themselves, become indistinguishable
from awareness. Not lost. Just everywhere. Just awareness itself.

[1-451]
The Migration's Arrived Flock:
Birds arrive at destination. No more flying. No more navigation. Just resting.
The Dharma is like this. The journey of practice arrives at destination. No more
path. No more effort. Just resting in awareness. The exhaustion of Dharma is
this arrival. The completion of journey.

[1-451]
The Animal Tracks' Faded Marks:
Rain falls. Wind blows. Tracks fade. No more marks. No more evidence of
passage. But the ground remains. The Dharma is like this. Teachings fade.
Practices fade. No more tracks. No more evidence of effort. But awareness
remains. The ground of all.

[1-451]
The Root System's Pulled Up:
Roots pulled from ground. Exposed. No more anchoring. No more drawing
nourishment. Just exposed awareness. The Dharma is like this. Roots of practice
pulled up. No more grounding in method. No more nourishment from technique.
Just exposed. Just awareness.

[1-451]
The Dzo's Unloaded Back:
The load is delivered. The back is empty. No more carrying. No more burden.
The Dharma is like this. The load of practice is delivered. Recognition is
achieved. The back is empty. The burden is exhausted. Light. Free.
Complete.

[1-451]
The Celestial Burial's Total Dissolution:
Body completely given. Completely taken. Completely dispersed. Nothing remains
of form. Nothing remains of identity. The Dharma is like this. Complete giving.
Complete release. Complete exhaustion. Not destroyed—returned. Returned to
vultures, to wind, to space. Returned to awareness.

[1-451]
LONGCHENPA'S VAST SYNTHESIS:
The exhaustion of Dharma is not the end of teaching. It is the beginning of
living teaching. The exhaustion of mind is not the end of thought. It is the
beginning of natural thought. The exhaustion of practice is not the end of
activity. It is the beginning of spontaneous activity.

When Dharma is exhausted, awareness remains. When mind is exhausted,
nature remains. When practice is exhausted, recognition remains. What is
exhausted? Only the artificial. Only the constructed. Only the conceptual.

[1-451]
THE SYSTEMATIZER'S ARCHITECTURE:
Three phases of exhaustion:
1. Outer exhaustion—forms, rituals, structures
2. Inner exhaustion—energies, channels, subtle body
3. Secret exhaustion—concepts, recognitions, even enlightenment

All three exhausted, what remains? Not nothing. The nature that was never
constructed. The awareness that was never created. The ground that was never
established.

[1-451]
THE INTEGRATOR'S SPACIOUS UNITY:
No conflict between Dharma and exhaustion of Dharma. No contradiction between
practice and completion of practice. The ocean contains all waves. The exhaustion
contains all Dharma. The vastness includes all activity. The equality includes all
distinctions.

[1-451]
GARAB DORJE'S STARK POINTING:
Exhausted? Good! Now exhaust the exhaustor! Mind exhausted? Good! Now exhaust
the one who knows mind is exhausted! Keep exhausting until nothing remains to
exhaust. Then—recognition! Complete. Total. Beyond exhaustion and non-exhaustion.

[1-451]
PATRUL'S EARTHY LAUGHTER:
This uneducated yogi... exhausted himself trying to exhaust Dharma! Years of analysis,
years of meditation, years of practice. Finally exhausted, he sat down and
laughed. The laughing exhausted the exhaustor. Complete!

[1-451]
THE SINGING YOGI'S DAILY EXHAUSTION:
While cooking—exhausting the cook.
While eating—exhausting the eater.
While walking—exhausting the walker.
Every activity, every moment, exhaust what acts. Until only activity remains.
Only moment remains. Only awareness remains.

[1-451]
THE ESSENCE HOLDER'S SPACIOUS REST:
Beyond exhaustion, beyond non-exhaustion. Beyond Dharma, beyond non-Dharma.
Rest in what never needed exhausting. Rest in what was never constructed.
Rest in the nature that precedes all exhaustion.

[1-451]
THE WANDERING GURU'S RADICAL SIMPLICITY:
Simple. Direct. Exhausted. What more to say? Dharma exhausted. Mind
exhausted. Practice exhausted. Rest in what remains. Simple.

[1-451]

How I long for complete exhaustion! How I pray for total transcendence!
But even this longing must be exhausted. Even this prayer. Even this devotee.
Exhaust all. Complete all.

THE LION-FACED DAKINI'S FIERCE COMPASSION:
Exhaust now! Don't wait! Exhaust the Dharma! Exhaust the mind! Exhaust the
exhaustion itself! Cut through completely! Total! Now!
