[5963-5982]
Dharma exhausted, mind transcended—this is not nihilism but completion. When all
 Dharmas have been exhausted, when mind itself is seen through, what remains is not
 nothing but the vast expanse beyond all categories. Here we enter the territory where
 even the path is left behind, where practice itself dissolves into recognition.

[5983-6020]
Beyond bondage, beyond liberation—beyond even the duality of beyond/not-beyond.
This is the Great Perfection in its natural state, not something to achieve but the nature
 of whatever appears. Like sky, it cannot be grasped. Like space, it accommodates all
 without being affected.

[6021-6050]
Three aspects: the nature itself, the resolution of samsara-nirvana duality, the
pervasion of all appearances. Not stages to traverse but perspectives on what is already
complete. The practitioner who understands these three understands everything. The
practitioner who misses these three misses everything, no matter how many hours they
sit.

[6051-6100]
Outer appearances, inner awareness, the between where grasping occurs—all gathered
into Dzogchen's vast equality. Primordially empty, universally empty, great emptiness.
Not the emptiness of absence but the emptiness that is full presence without limitation.

[6101-6150]
This old fool spent years seeking the experience of emptiness. He found it—and lost
it—and found it again. Finally he understood: the seeking itself was the obstacle. The
emptiness he sought was the nature of the seeker. Exhaust all Dharmas, and what
exhausts them is also exhausted. This is completion.

[6151-6200]
Appearance-emptiness great, mind-emptiness great, purity-emptiness great,
liberation-emptiness great. Four great emptinesses, one great recognition. Appearance
empty of inherent existence, mind empty of grasping, purity empty of distinction,
liberation empty of what needed liberating. Empty, empty, empty—yet luminous,
present, aware.

[6201-6250]
Not experienced as existent, not experienced as non-existent. Not experienced as true,
not experienced as false. Beyond the four extremes, beyond the eight collections,
beyond the hundred negations. This is not agnosticism but certainty—certainty that
certainty itself is empty.

[6251-6300]
Equal-vast, pervading-pervade, exist-nonexist direction-vast, have-not-have
appearance-vast. These are not mere words but attempts to point to what cannot be
pointed. The vastness that pervades all directions without being anywhere. The
equality that includes all distinctions without becoming confused.

[6301-6350]
Not moving, equal-vast. Spontaneous, primordial-vast. Natural equality, ground-vast.
Wide, pervading, awakened, liberated, exhausted, empty. These words exhaust
themselves as they speak. The vastness they describe cannot be contained in words
any more than sky can be contained in a jar.

[6351-6400]
Not established, not dwelling, not accepting, not going, not coming, not thinking, not
examining, not meditating, not changing. Twelve negations, twelve liberations. Each
negation cuts a strand of the net that binds. Cut all twelve, and the net dissolves—
revealing there was no net, no one bound, no binding.

[6401-6450]
Previously, delusion was not experienced. Now, delusion has no ground. Finally,
delusion is impossible. Three times of purity—not that delusion was purified, but that it
was never delusion. Like realizing the rope was never a snake, the freedom is not
from something but recognition of what never was.

[6451-6500]
Previously, liberation was not experienced. Now, liberation does not enter. Finally,
liberation is impossible. If there is nothing bound, what could be liberated? The very
concept of liberation implies bondage. Exhaust both concepts, and rest in what
precedes them.

[6501-6550]
Previously, no passing. Now, no dwelling. Finally, no arising. Three times transcended,
not sequentially but simultaneously. No passing into nirvana, no dwelling in samsara,
no future arising to fear. The past exhausted, present groundless, future impossible—
time itself seen through.

[6551-6600]
Without category, pervading-awakened, empty. Natural condition without ground.
Natural way without path. Natural liberation without result. No view or meditation's
name. No direction-category's Dharma. No have-not-have's extreme. No sky's expanse.
Sevenfold exhaustion—not destruction but recognition.

[6601-6650]
Beyond effort, primordially awakened. Beyond view-meditation, naturally awakened.
Beyond focus-thought, liberated-awakened. Direction-vast nameless awakened—this is
the rolling, the vast expanse where all concepts dissolve. Not meditated but
recognized. Not achieved but revealed.

[6651-6700]
Nothing to view, nothing viewed. No viewer. Viewing does not see. Nothing to
meditate, nothing meditated. Beyond meditation. Even if meditated, no liberation.
Nothing to analyze, nothing analyzed. No need to analyze. Analysis is futile effort.
Nothing to accomplish—already accomplished. Nothing to do.

[6701-6750]
This is not passivity but complete engagement. Not nihilism but fullness beyond
concept. Not escape from life but life without resistance. The exhausted mind does not
stop functioning—it functions without grasping. The transcended Dharma does not
disappear—it appears as what it always was.

[6751-6800]
Mountain hermit sat for forty years without moving. When asked what he practiced, he
said: "I practiced not practicing. I meditated on non-meditation. I accomplished
non-accomplishment." Fools thought him mad. The wise saw completion itself sitting by
the stream.

[6801-6850]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: stop seeking what you already possess! The
Dharma you exhaust is not outside you—it is your own conceptual mind. Exhaust it,
and what remains is not nothing but everything, not emptiness but fullness, not
absence but presence beyond presence/absence.

[6851-6900]
Between the vast view of Longchenpa and the direct pointing of this wandering fool,
we find the middle way of exhaustion. Not rejecting practice, not grasping
non-practice. The ocean holds all waves while remaining undisturbed. The exhausted
Dharma contains all Dharmas while being free from all.

[6901-6950]
Final secret: exhaustion is not an achievement but recognition. The Dharma was
always exhausted—empty from the beginning, free from the start. What needed
exhausting? Only the belief that something needed to be exhausted. See through this,
and the Treasury is complete.

[6951-7000]
Emaho! The wonder of Dharma exhausted, mind transcended. What teaching remains?
What practice continues? What result is sought? Rest in this exhaustion, and the
Supreme Vehicle has carried you to the place you never left. The Jewel Treasure
reveals itself as your own nature—primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally
exhausted.

[7001-7050]
This old vagabond leaves you with what he was given: the path is exhausted, the fruit
is revealed. Do not seek further. Do not add more. Subtract everything, including the
subtractor, and what remains is what always was. This is Dzogchen's completion. This
is the Treasury's heart. This is your own face before parents were born.
