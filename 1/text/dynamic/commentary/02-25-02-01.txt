First has three: General presentation of attainment mode. Specifically explained as being result. Removing contradiction with explaining as path-appearance. First: From essence's ground-appearance appearing as three kayas, shown as attained through power of purifying three gates' stains to be purified. From Thal 'gyur: "Furthermore, the result stages: Dharmakaya by mind's activity, Sambhogakaya obtained through speech's form, Nirmanakaya by body." Therefore: These are cause-result of what is to be purified. As spontaneously accomplished by nature, knowing that attainment through causes and conditions is impossible—know this! See? The purification isn't a manufacturing process—you're not building a Buddha from parts. It's removing obscurations from what's already perfect. Like cleaning a mirror: the reflection is already there, you just remove the dust!

Second: From Mu Tig Phreng Ba (Pearl Garland): "Result three kayas, five pristine awarenesses." So. From Vajrasattva Heart Mirror: "Know that all result dharmas are three kayas, irreversible." This being so: Third: If someone says explaining three kayas as path-appearance contradicts.

Longchenpa is about to resolve an apparent contradiction. Some might think: "If the kayas are already perfect as the ground (gzhi), how can they be a path we traverse?" Watch how he elegantly shows that these aren't contradictory but complementary perspectives!

Listen! The early masters said: "Not the result"—but what did they mean? They were freeing us from extreme attachment to the three kayas as truly existent results. Or they were refuting those who hold the three cycles as ultimate. Having removed these contradictions, they also established it as result in reality. But those who don't understand the essence of primordially pure internal expanse as the nature (rang bzhin)—this is a great error, not good!

Emaho! See the skill of Longchenpa! He's showing how earlier masters used skillful means. When they said "not result," they weren't denying Buddhahood—they were protecting us from grasping. Like telling a child "don't touch the stove"—the stove exists, but the warning prevents harm. The three kayas are both path-appearance AND result—there's no contradiction!

Here, as previously accepted, path-appearance exists, and it doesn't contradict being result. Rest in this understanding.

The way is where you stand.

Destination is departure point.

[Final]
The commentary ends where it began—in recognition. What Longchenpa revealed is what you are. Nothing was added; nothing was removed.
