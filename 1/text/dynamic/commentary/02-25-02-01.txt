First has three: General presentation of attainment mode. Specifically explained as being result. Removing contradiction with explaining as path-appearance. First: From essence's ground-appearance appearing as three kayas, shown as attained through power of purifying three gates' stains to be purified. From Thal 'gyur: "Furthermore, the result stages: Dharmakaya by mind's activity, Sambhogakaya obtained through speech's form, Nirmanakaya by body." Thus. These are cause-result of what is to be purified. As spontaneously accomplished by nature, knowing that attainment through causes and conditions is impossible—know this! See? The purification isn't a manufacturing process—you're not building a Buddha from parts. It's removing obscurations from what's already perfect. Like cleaning a mirror: the reflection is already there, you just remove the dust!
