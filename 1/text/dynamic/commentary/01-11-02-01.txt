[13432-13445]
Between mind and its gathering, the elements dance. First, upon mind, gathering by water-mind holds mindfulness' thought-basis. By steadiness, mind's collection gathers. Radiating by fire-mind radiates to objects. Light by wind-mind moves. Upon mind-itself, unborn meaning's mind-itself, unceasing mindfulness's mind-itself, unchanging example-meaning-mixed mind-itself, self-complete actual-meaning, nowhere differentiated mind-itself.

The mind and its objects are not separate. The water-mind gathers, holding the thought-basis. The fire-mind radiates to objects. The wind-mind moves as light. These are not metaphors—they describe the actual process of consciousness. The mind-itself is unborn meaning, unceasing mindfulness, unchanging example-meaning-mixed, self-complete actual-meaning, nowhere differentiated.

[13446-13465]
Therefore. Thus. Upon mindfulness, mind and mental two from. Mind's mindfulness is as explained before. Mental's mindfulness six are: thoroughly-searching mindfulness, pure—clear as god's body; impure—thrown into god's migration; perverted—thrown into wrong-attachment body. Definitively-settling mental mindfulness, pure—awareness-holder obtained; impure—born as god-asura; perverted—into butcher's lineage.

The mental mindfulness has six aspects. Thoroughly-searching mindfulness, when pure, is clear as a god's body; when impure, throws one into god's migration; when perverted, throws one into wrong-attachment body. Definitively-settling mental mindfulness, when pure, obtains the awareness-holder; when impure, one is born as god-asura; when perverted, into the butcher's lineage.

[13466-13485]
Definitively-placing mental mindfulness, pure—space-dweller; impure—human; perverted—into desire-possessing migration thrown. Mental-consciousness's mindfulness, pure—mudra-yoga; impure—animal; perverted—wrong-view-possessor. Affliction-possessing mind's mindfulness, pure—single-syllable yoga, impure—hungry ghost; perverted—wrong-desire migration.

Definitively-placing mental mindfulness: pure—space-dweller; impure—human; perverted—into desire-possessing migration thrown. Mental-consciousness's mindfulness: pure—mudra-yoga; impure—animal; perverted—wrong-view-possessor. Affliction-possessing mind's mindfulness: pure—single-syllable yoga, impure—hungry ghost; perverted—wrong-desire migration.

[13486-13505]
This old practitioner sees the six migrations clearly. Moving-maker-grasping mind's mindfulness, pure—wheel-grasping yoga; impure—hell; perverted—suffering-possessing migration. That also, thoroughly-investigating mind with wind-horse, from previous-memory following-grasping arises. Definitively-settling mind with earth-horse, from past-branched memory arises. Definitively-grasping mind, arising with water-horse, from present-memory following-grasping arises.

The six migrations are the six realms of samsara: gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings, demigods. Each arises from a specific type of mindfulness. The moving-maker-grasping mind, when pure, becomes wheel-grasping yoga; when impure, leads to hell; when perverted, to suffering. The thoroughly-investigating mind with wind-horse arises from previous-memory following-grasping. The definitively-settling mind with earth-horse arises from past-branched memory. The definitively-grasping mind with water-horse arises from present-memory following-grasping.

[13506-13525]
Three words. See what is. Rest. Mental-consciousness from mind-six's knowing-portion gathering arises. With mother-horse arises. From present-memory near-pointing arises. Affliction-possessor with water-earth-two-gathered horse, from future-memory following-grasping arises. Moving-maker-grasping mind: early-late latencies' aggregate gathered, with fire-wind-two horse, from future-memory branching arises.

Mental-consciousness arises from the mind's six aspects of knowing. With mother-horse, it arises from present-memory near-pointing. Affliction-possessor with water-earth-two-gathered horse arises from future-memory following-grasping. The moving-maker-grasping mind: early-late latencies' aggregate gathered, with fire-wind-two horse, from future-memory branching arises.

[13526-13545]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! Thus by six ripenings, inside consciousness aggregate-six arose. By those from individual gathering, eighteen elements growing obtained. Obtained, thus abides. That those cause and condition from earth insect thousand eighty-four arisen. Body by body generated. Speech by speech generated. Mind by mind generated.

Thus by six ripenings, the six aspects of consciousness arise. From these, eighteen elements grow. From the cause and condition of earth, one thousand eighty-four insects arise. Body is generated by body. Speech is generated by speech. Mind is generated by mind.

[13546-13565]
Between generation and completion, the tantra speaks. From Great Arrangement: generation three migrating beings, individual ripening complete. From elements body pure and from letters voice speech. Mindfulness life mind etc. Thus. Also insect-abiding letters and that support body. Those each body-speech-mind definite support abiding.

The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked. The nature is complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Now I will explain further. This section describes the process of embryonic development and the arising of consciousness. The ancient masters understood that consciousness does not arise from nothing—it arises from specific conditions, specific causes and effects. The process is intricate, detailed, systematic. The numbers describe the stages of development: the channels, the elements, the sense faculties, the mental factors.

The mind arises from the elements. The water element gathers, holding the thought-basis. The fire element radiates to objects. The wind element moves as light. These are not metaphors—they describe the actual process of consciousness. The mind-itself is unborn meaning, unceasing mindfulness, unchanging example-meaning-mixed, self-complete actual-meaning, nowhere differentiated.

The mental factors arise from specific conditions. Thoroughly-searching mindfulness, when pure, is clear as a god's body; when impure, throws one into god's migration; when perverted, throws one into wrong-attachment body. Definitively-settling mental mindfulness, when pure, obtains the awareness-holder; when impure, one is born as god-asura; when perverted, into the butcher's lineage.

The six migrations are the six realms: gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hell beings, demigods. Each arises from a specific type of mindfulness. Moving-maker-grasping mind, when pure, becomes wheel-grasping yoga; when impure, leads to hell; when perverted, to suffering. The thoroughly-investigating mind with wind-horse arises from previous-memory following-grasping. The definitively-settling mind with earth-horse arises from past-branched memory. The definitively-grasping mind with water-horse arises from present-memory following-grasping.

The process of embryonic development is described in intricate detail. From elements to channels, from channels to body, from body to faculties, from faculties to limbs. Each stage is precise. Each number has meaning. The ancient yogis mapped this process through direct observation—not of external anatomy, but of their own consciousness entering the body.

This old wanderer has traversed these stages. In the bardo, consciousness enters the body gradually. First the wind, then the channels, then the elements, then the body. The process is not random—it follows specific patterns. The mind enters through the crown, descends through the channels, settles in the heart. This is the process of birth—not just physical birth, but the birth of consciousness in a new form.

The numbers describe the completeness of the system. The channels are sixteen, then thirty-two, then sixty-four. The wisdom aspects are sixteen, then thirty-two. The letters are sixteen, then forty-eight. The light spheres are sixteen, then sixty-four. The system is vast, intricate, complete. It describes every aspect of existence.

The practitioner who understands this knows that the body is not separate from consciousness. The channels are not mere tubes—they are the pathways of awareness. The elements are not mere matter—they are the qualities of awareness. The faculties are not mere organs—they are the gateways of wisdom. When recognized, the body becomes the mandala, the channels become the deities, the elements become the wisdom aspects.

Thus, do not despise the body. Do not think that awareness is separate from flesh. The body is the vehicle of enlightenment. The channels are the pathways of wisdom. The elements are the display of awareness. Recognize this, and the body becomes the palace of the buddhas.

The practitioner who understands this knows that the body is not separate from consciousness. The channels are not mere tubes—they are the pathways of awareness. The elements are not mere matter—they are the qualities of awareness. The faculties are not mere organs—they are the gateways of wisdom. When recognized, the body becomes the mandala, the channels become the deities, the elements become the wisdom aspects.

The process of embryonic development is not merely physical—it is the descent of consciousness into form. The mind, in the bardo, sees the parents and is drawn to them. The karmic connection, the affinity, the attachment—all these draw the mind into the womb. The consciousness enters the father's seed, combines with the mother's blood, and begins to grow.

The channels form first: the central channel, then the right and left channels, then the subsidiary channels. These are not blood vessels—they are the pathways of awareness. The winds move through them, the bindus flow through them, the mind experiences through them. The channels are the infrastructure of consciousness.

The elements then form: earth gives solidity, water gives fluidity, fire gives warmth, wind gives movement, space gives openness. These are not physical elements—they are the qualities of awareness appearing as form. When recognized, the elements become the five wisdoms: earth becomes equality wisdom, water becomes discriminating wisdom, fire becomes mirror-like wisdom, wind becomes all-accomplishing wisdom, space becomes dharmadhatu wisdom.

The faculties then develop: the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind. These are the gateways through which awareness experiences the world. The eye sees forms, the ear hears sounds, the nose smells odors, the tongue tastes flavors, the body feels touch, the mind knows phenomena. These are not merely physical organs—they are the six ways awareness experiences.

The limbs then form: arms, legs, head, torso. These are not merely flesh—they are the tools of action. The arms act, the legs move, the head perceives, the torso supports. Each part has its function, each part serves awareness.

The process is precise. The numbers are exact. This is not speculation—it is observation, refined over centuries. The Tibetan masters understood consciousness because they observed their own consciousness, entering and leaving the body. They mapped the process in detail, leaving us this intricate system.

The practitioner who understands this does not cling to the body as self, nor reject it as obstacle. The body is the vehicle of enlightenment. It is the palace in which awareness dwells. It is the mandala of the buddhas. When recognized, the body itself becomes the path.

Thus, respect your body. It is not separate from awareness. The channels within you are the pathways of wisdom. The elements within you are the display of awareness. The faculties within you are the gateways of liberation. Recognize this, and every moment becomes practice. Every breath becomes meditation. Every sensation becomes wisdom.

The treasury opens by revealing what was never hidden. The body is already complete. Awareness is already present. Liberation is not something to achieve—it is something to recognize. Rest in that recognition, and the body becomes the palace of enlightenment.

Now I will explain further the meaning of these elaborate numbers. The system describes consciousness entering the body. First, the all-basis consciousness gathers. This is the storehouse of all karmic imprints, the ground from which all mental events arise. From this, the eighteen elements grow: the six sense organs, the six sense objects, and the six consciousnesses. These form the basis of experience.

The channels develop in stages. The main channels are like rivers, the subsidiary channels like streams, the finest channels like capillaries. All carry the winds, the energies of consciousness. When these winds flow freely, awareness is clear. When they are blocked, confusion arises.

The elements form progressively. First, the wind element, the earliest and most subtle. Then, the fire element, providing warmth. Then, the water element, providing fluidity. Then, the earth element, providing solidity. Each element brings specific qualities. Each quality brings specific experiences.

The sense faculties develop from the elements. The eye faculty arises from the earth element, clear and discriminating. The ear faculty arises from the space element, open and receptive. The nose arises from water, the tongue from fire, the body from wind. Each faculty has its specific object and consciousness.

The mental factors arise as well. Mindfulness, attention, discrimination, ecstasy, equanimity—all these arise from specific combinations of elements and channels. They are not separate from the body—they are functions of the body-mind system.

The elaborate enumeration is not mere classification—it is a map. The map describes the territory of consciousness. The territory is vast—so vast that the ancient masters divided it into sections, numbered the sections, and gave names to the divisions. This is not to confuse—it is to help us understand.

The numbers describe completeness. The sixteen channels become thirty-two, become sixty-four. The sixteen wisdoms become thirty-two. The sixteen letters become forty-eight. The light spheres become sixty-four. Each multiplication describes an increase in refinement. Each refinement brings us closer to the source.

This system was not invented—it was discovered. The masters observed their own consciousness in meditation. They observed consciousness entering the body at birth, leaving at death, moving in the bardo. They observed the stages of embryonic development and mapped them to the movement of consciousness. The result is this elaborate system.

The practitioner who understands this does not cling to the body as self. The body is not the self—it is a manifestation of awareness. But neither does the practitioner reject the body as obstacle. The body is the vehicle of liberation. It is the palace in which awareness dwells. It is the mandala of the five wisdoms.

Thus, treat your body with respect. It is not merely flesh—it is the temple of awareness. The channels within you are the pathways of wisdom. The elements within you are the display of awareness. The faculties within you are the gateways of liberation. When recognized, every part of the body becomes Buddha-field, every moment becomes practice.

The ancient texts say: the body is the complete Buddha. The five aggregates are the five kayas. The four elements are the four wisdoms. The six sense faculties are the six elements of enlightenment. This is not metaphor—it is description of what is, when recognized.

Therefore, do not seek enlightenment elsewhere. Do not think you must go somewhere else, become something else, achieve something else. The enlightenment is here, in this body, in this mind, in this moment. Rest in recognition, and the body reveals itself as the palace of the buddhas. The channels reveal themselves as the pathways of wisdom. The elements reveal themselves as the display of awareness.

This is the teaching of the Great Perfection: the ground is already complete. The path is already present. The result is already achieved. We do not create enlightenment—we recognize it. We do not achieve wisdom—we uncover it. The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open.

This old wanderer has traveled these paths. I have seen consciousness enter the body. I have felt the descent of awareness into form. I have experienced the stages of embryonic development from within. What I tell you is from direct observation, refined through years of practice.

The body is not an obstacle to enlightenment—it is the very ground of enlightenment. The channels are not separate from awareness—they are awareness taking form. The elements are not mere matter—they are awareness appearing as experience. When you recognize this, the body becomes the mandala, the channels become the deities, the elements become the wisdoms.

Do not think the body is impure. The body is pure—from the beginning, pure. Do not think the mind is impure. The mind is pure—from the beginning, pure. The impurity is the not recognizing. The confusion is the not seeing. When recognition dawns, impurity reveals itself as purity. When awareness sees itself, confusion reveals itself as wisdom.

The elaborate numbers in this text describe this process. They are not meant to bind you in complexity. They are meant to reveal the intricacy of awareness. Each number, each division, each enumeration points to something real. The system is comprehensive because awareness is comprehensive. The system is intricate because experience is intricate.

But remember: the map is not the territory. The finger pointing is not the moon. The numbers describe the description—they are not the thing described. Rest in recognition. Let the descriptions arise and dissolve. The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open.
