[3005-3056]
See what is. The dream state—not as escape, not as entertainment, but as the
yogin's path. When water rushes toward you in sleep, when fire burns, when dogs
chase, when enemies attack—recognize. This is the moment. Train now, and
certainty comes.

This old fool spent years chasing dreams. Visions. Prophecies. Special experiences.
One night he dreamed of falling into a river. Panic rose. Then he remembered.
"This is a dream." The river became a path. The falling became flight. Recognition
dawns in an instant—after years of preparation.
