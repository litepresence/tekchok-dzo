[3005-3010] First: water, fire, dog, enemy, etc., conditions fierce fear terror arising, in dream dwelling thought certain—roughly held called. Then all dreams held come. Held time emanation: daytime mind deity form and beings and seeing various many emanating, one from many emanating doing, in dream emanation like seeing.

[3005-3010] The dream begins with fierce conditions. Water, fire, dogs, enemies—fear and terror arise. You think they're real. You hold onto them. But the holding is the dream. When you hold the dream, you can emanate. In daytime you train the mind—deities, beings, forms. Then in dreams, the emanation happens naturally.

[3005-3010] Three words. Fierce. Hold. Emanate. The fierce conditions—water, fire, enemy—are invitations to recognize. Hold the dream, and you can emanate. The daytime training becomes nighttime transformation.

[3011-3015] Then mutually deity-naga transforming, male-female transforming, one-many transforming, many-one transforming, aspiration not distracted, daytime trained, in dream certainly arise.

[3011-3015] The transformation happens: deity becomes naga, male becomes female, one becomes many, many becomes one. The aspiration is not distracted. The daytime training becomes dream certainty. What you practice by day, you become by night.

[3016-3020] Then previously not gone lands, fields, etc., thinking, in dream there traveling and dharma hearing, etc., arise. These aspiration fierce done, quickly mastered.

[3016-3020] You dream of places you've never been. Countries, fields, landscapes you've never seen. In the dream you travel and hear the dharma. The aspiration is fierce, the practice is quick. This is the power of dream yoga.

[3021-3030] Some places dream practice main explanation, but here preliminary suitable, dream holding and transformation mere, dharmata meaning not, mind's true grasping not liberated. Earlier most not explained this, but Zilnon commentary and dream crucial instruction said, crucial great importance, oneself also practiced, certainty.

[3021-3030] Don't mistake dream holding and transformation for dharmata! They are preliminary, not the meaning. The true liberation is not in the dream—it's in recognizing the dreamer. The holding and transforming are not the point. The point is the mind's true grasping—liberated.

[3021-3030] The dream practice is preparation. Holding the dream, transforming appearances—these are not dharmata itself. The true liberation is mind's grasping—liberated. Don't confuse the practice with the goal.

[3031-3040] In dream practice, four methods: appearance, objects, nature, grasping. All dreams held: appearance objects. Transformation: nature. Dharmata meaning: grasping liberated. These four are the structure.

[3031-3040] Three words. Appearance. Nature. Grasping. Four methods in dream practice. Appearance, objects, nature, grasping. All dreams are appearance and objects. Transformation is nature. Dharmata is grasping liberated. Four names for one practice.

[3041-3052] Then, the method of arising: through four aspects. First, appearance arises without grasping. Second, objects appear as display. Third, nature is recognized as empty. Fourth, grasping liberates itself. This is dream yoga complete.

[3041-3052] Four aspects of arising. Appearance—arises without grasping. Objects—as display. Nature—recognized as empty. Grasping—liberates itself. The dream transforms when you recognize these four. Not by forcing, by seeing.

[3041-3052] In my own practice, I learned to hold the dream like holding water. Not grasping, not spilling. The appearance arises—let it. The objects appear—see them. The nature is empty—recognize it. The grasping liberates—trust it.

[Final] Dream yoga: holding the dream, transforming appearances, recognizing dharmata. Fierce conditions—water, fire, dog, enemy—become invitations to recognize. Daytime training—deity, beings, forms—becomes dream mastery. Four methods: appearance, objects, nature, grasping. All dreams held are appearance and objects. Transformation is nature. Dharmata is grasping liberated. Four names for one practice. The mutual transformations: deity becomes naga, male becomes female, one becomes many, many becomes one. Aspiration not distracted, daytime trained, dream certainly arises. Places you've never been appear. Dharma teachings you've never heard arise. The aspiration is fierce, the mastery is quick. But don't mistake the practice for the goal. Holding and transforming are preliminary. The true liberation is mind's grasping—liberated. You dream of traveling to lands you've never visited. You hear dharma from teachers you've never met. The fierce aspirations bring quick mastery. But the Zilnon commentary warns—this is not dharmata itself. It's preparation. The true meaning is mind's true grasping liberated. The dream is mind's display. The dreamer is rigpa. The liberation is complete. Through four aspects the method arises: appearance without grasping, objects as display, nature recognized as empty, grasping liberates itself. This is dream yoga complete. Train by day, transform by night. Recognize the dream, recognize yourself. The dream practice has four aspects: holding the dream, transforming the dream, recognizing dharmata, liberating grasping. These four are the structure of dream yoga. Some places call this the main practice, but it is actually preliminary. The true dharmata is beyond dream practice. The mind's true grasping must be liberated, not just the dream transformed. This crucial instruction has great importance. Those who practice it with certainty achieve mastery.

Emaho! The dream yoga! The transformation! The recognition!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
