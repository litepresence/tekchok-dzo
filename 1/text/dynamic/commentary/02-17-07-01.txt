[3005-3052] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, water, fire, dog, enemy, etc., conditions fierce fear terror arising, in dream dwelling thought certain—roughly held called. Then all dreams held come. Held time emanation: daytime mind deity form and beings and seeing various many emanating, one from many emanating doing, in dream emanation like seeing. Then mutually deity-naga transforming, male-female transforming, one-many transforming, many-one transforming, aspiration not distracted, daytime trained, in dream certainly arise.

[3005-3052] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Dream. Transform. Stop. You think dreams need to be controlled. The transformation is not something you do. It is the recognition that dream and dreamer are one. The water, fire, enemy—they are your own mind's display. Transforming them is recognizing they were never other.

[3005-3052] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man once dreamed of drowning every night for a month. He tried to control the water, command it, transform it. Nothing worked. Then one night he recognized—the water was his own fear. He dove in and swam. The transformation happened when he stopped fighting.

[3005-3052] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The dream transformation is the consort's magic—appearing as one, becoming many, male becoming female, self becoming other. All the deity-naga transformations are mind's play. When you train in daytime, you train the magician. When dreams transform naturally, the magic is recognized.

[3005-3052] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I learned to fly in dreams as a child. Not by trying, but by falling and not hitting ground. The transformation comes when you trust the nature of the dream. Let it change. Let it be wild. The control is in the surrender.

[3013-3052] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Then previously not gone lands, fields, etc., thinking, in dream there traveling and dharma hearing, etc., arise. These aspiration fierce done, quickly mastered. Some places dream practice main explanation, but here preliminary suitable, dream holding and transformation mere, dharmata meaning not, mind's true grasping not liberated. Earlier most not explained this, but Zilnon commentary and dream crucial instruction said, crucial great importance, oneself also practiced, certainty.

[3013-3052] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Hold. Transform. Stop. You hold the dream to transform it. But holding is grasping. Transformation happens in the letting go. Dream practice is not about controlling dreams. It is about recognizing the dreamer.

[3013-3052] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): DREAMS! TRANSFORMATIONS! speaks with fierce compassion I will destroy your practice! The dream is not something to hold! The transformation is not something to achieve! The dreamer and dreamed are EMPTY! SEE THIS!

[Final] Dream transformation is the recognition that all appearances are mind's display. The fierce conditions—water, fire, enemy—are invitations to recognize. Train in daytime, recognize in dream, liberate both.

Emaho! The yogi of dream transformation!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
