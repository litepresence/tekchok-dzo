[2873-2880] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First: through reasoning that examines and dissects. When nothing is established as dharma-nature. Wisdom realizing all as primordially dwelling. This is the ultimate truth as realized through analysis. Through analysis, you examine and dissect. You find nothing established as inherently existent. All dharmas are empty of nature. This is the ultimate truth realized through analysis.

[2873-2880] Voice 13 (Patrul): Analysis examines everything. Dissects every phenomenon. Finds nothing with inherent existence. This is the ultimate truth—not through faith, not through practice, but through investigation. The analytical path leads to realization.

[2873-2880] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Examine. Dissect. Find. Nothing. Analysis examines, dissects, finds nothing inherently existent. The nothing is the something.

[2881-2890] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): As Two Truths states: Negating arising and so forth is the ultimate. When elaborations of arising cease, this is termed ultimate. The negation is not destruction. It is seeing through. Like realizing the mirage was never water. The water-ness was projection. Phenomena primordial from beginning. Transcend all elaborations of existence and non-existence. Sphere pure by nature.

[2881-2890] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): The ultimate negates elaboration. Arising, ceasing—these are elaborations. When elaborations cease, the ultimate remains. Not destroyed—seen through. Like the mirage was never water. The water was projection. The projection was the truth.

[2891-2900] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): From Root Wisdom: Peace not known from elsewhere. Conceptuality nothing. Meaning not differentiated. Non-elaboration through elaborations. This is its essential characteristic. The characteristic is no characteristic. The description points beyond description. The sphere is pure by nature. Not achieved through analysis—it is recognized when analysis exhausts itself. Like a fire that burns its own fuel.

[2891-2900] Voice 13 (Patrul): The root wisdom teaches: peace is not known from elsewhere. It's not somewhere else. It's here. Conceptuality—nothing. Meaning—not differentiated. Non-elaboration through elaborations. The description points beyond description. The characteristic has no characteristic.

[2901-2910] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Knowing and practicing. The graduated path. Ten novice precepts. Two hundred fifty bhiksu precepts. Three hundred sixty-three bhiksuni precepts. Eighty-five training sutras. Four establishments of mindfulness. Four correct abandonments. Four miraculous feet. Five faculties. Five strengths. Seven limbs of enlightenment. Eight superior paths. Nine grounds. This is not bureaucracy—this is architecture. Each precept builds foundation. Each practice trains capacity.

[2901-2910] Voice 04 (Padmasambhava): The graduated path has many elements. Ten novice precepts for beginners. Two hundred fifty bhiksu precepts for monks. Three hundred sixty-three bhiksuni precepts for nuns. Eighty-five training sutras. Four establishments of mindfulness: body, feeling, mind, phenomena. Four correct abandonments. Five faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, samadhi, wisdom. Five strengths. Seven limbs: mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy, relaxation, samadhi, equanimity. Eight superior paths. Nine grounds. All build the foundation.

[2911-2920] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The path of accumulation. The path of preparation. The path of seeing. The path of meditation. The path of no-more-learning. These are the stages. Gradual, necessary for those who need stairs. Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. The four establishments of mindfulness in small path: body, feeling, mind, phenomena. Watching them without grasping. This is where recognition begins. Not as Dzogchen—as foundation, as preparation. The mindfulness itself becomes wisdom when recognition dawns.

[2911-2920] Voice 13 (Patrul): Four establishments of mindfulness: body, feeling, mind, phenomena. Watch the body without grasping. Watch feeling without grasping. Watch mind without grasping. Watch phenomena without grasping. This is where recognition begins. Not separate from Dzogchen—preparation for Dzogchen.

[2921-2930] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The seven limbs of path of enlightenment: mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy, relaxation, samadhi, equanimity. These are not obstacles to Dzogchen. They are Dzogchen's foundation. When recognized, they are self-liberated. When not recognized, they are training. The seven limbs support the path to enlightenment.

[2921-2930] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Seven. Limbs. Support. Seven limbs: mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy, relaxation, samadhi, equanimity. They support the practitioner. When recognized, they are the path. When not recognized, they are preparation.

[2931-2940] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Third: fruit of complete perfection. Ground of all-illumination. Dharmakaya for self-purpose. Two form-bodies for others. Two wisdoms. Working for beings until samsara emptied. This is not poetic aspiration—this is the natural result of path complete. From Entrance to Bodhisattva's Way: Peaceful body like wish-fulfilling tree. Like wish-fulfilling jewel. Working for benefit until liberation. Appearance free from elaboration.

[2931-2940] Voice 04 (Padmasambhava): The fruit of complete perfection—the result of the path. Dharmakaya for self-liberation. Rupakaya—nirmanakaya and sambhogakaya—for others. Two wisdoms: all-accomplishing and all-destroying. Working for beings until samsara is empty. This is not aspiration—it is natural result.

[2941-2950] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The bodhisattva does not vanish into nirvana. They remain. Serving. Until all are free. Between the graduated cultivation of the Vehicle of Characteristics and the sudden recognition of Dzogchen, Longchenpa holds both. Not rejecting gradual. Not clinging to sudden. The gradual is preparation for the sudden. The sudden is recognition of what gradual prepared.

[2941-2950] Voice 13 (Patrul): The Vehicle of Characteristics—the graduated path. Many precepts, many practices, many stages. Dzogchen—sudden recognition. Longchenpa teaches both. The graduated path prepares for sudden recognition. Sudden recognition makes sense of gradual preparation. Both are the path.

[Final] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Three paths to the fruit. First: through analysis, examining, dissecting, finding nothing inherently existent. The ultimate truth through reasoning. Second: through recognition of phenomena as primordial, sphere pure by nature, transcending elaborations. Third: the fruit—ground of all-illumination, dharmakaya, two form-bodies, working for beings. The graduated path has many elements: precepts, mindfulness, abandonments, faculties, strengths, limbs, paths, grounds. The sudden recognition of Dzogchen: direct seeing, no analysis needed. Both paths lead to the same fruit. The fruit is complete perfection. The ground is all-illumination. The dharmakaya is for self-liberation. The rupakaya is for others. The work continues until samsara is empty. This is the natural result of the path complete. Not poetic aspiration—natural result. Not achieved—recognized. The path is not walked—it is realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Through reasoning that examines and dissects. When nothing is established as dharma-nature. Wisdom realizing all as primordially dwelling. This is the ultimate truth as realized through analysis. The Two Truths: conventional and ultimate. Negating arising and so forth is the ultimate. When elaborations of arising cease, this is termed ultimate. The negation is not destruction. It is seeing through. Like realizing the mirage was never water. The water-ness was projection. Phenomena primordial from beginning. Transcend all elaborations of existence and non-existence. Sphere pure by nature. This is not achieved through analysis. It is recognized when analysis exhausts itself. Like a fire that burns its own fuel. The peace not known from elsewhere. Conceptuality nothing. Meaning not differentiated. Non-elaboration through elaborations. The characteristic is no characteristic. The description points beyond description. The graduated path: ten novice precepts, two hundred fifty bhiksu precepts, three hundred sixty-three bhiksuni precepts, eighty-five training sutras. Four establishments of mindfulness: body, feeling, mind, phenomena. Four correct abandonments. Five faculties. Five strengths. Seven limbs of enlightenment. Eight superior paths. Nine grounds. The path of accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, no-more-learning. The seven limbs: mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy, relaxation, samadhi, equanimity. The fruit: ground of all-illumination, dharmakaya for self, two form-bodies for others, two wisdoms, working until samsara emptied.

Emaho! The three paths! The graduated and the sudden! The fruit complete!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
