First: red-yellow round bindu appears. Dmar ser zlum po—spherical drop of
light, reddish-yellow, the first sign of thogal vision. Then outer ring
of five lights—'od lnga'i mu khyud—five-colored light perimeter manifests.

[9071-9081]
This mountain dweller... once strained to see lights. Pushed, contorted, achieved
nothing but headache. Then relaxed—bindu appeared naturally, like stars at
dusk when you stop looking for them. First red-yellow, then five lights.
The seeing that cannot be forced.

[9073-9083]
De'ang rlung gi gnad kyis 'gul ba las—moving through wind's crucial point.
Phir bzung dal ba gnad do—the essential is gentle holding, not grasping.
Wind moves, bindu responds. Deliberate control obscures; gentle allowing
reveals.

[9075-9085]
Bindu appears. Light manifests. Rest naturally. Three words—or simply: Look.

[9077-9087]
Dangs pa'i cha nyams su blangs pas—having taken the clear portion as path.
Sgron ma me long tsam—lamp like mirror. 'Od re lde tsam—light like flash.
Thig le 'khar phor tsam—bindu like vase. Gradual increase: from bindu to
body, from light to complete manifestation.

[9079-9089]
Thus the vision of contained appearance: wisdom perfect appears as space,
dharma-nature pure appears as awareness, bindu ripened appears as body,
mandala measure reached. All time, formerly demonstrated—signs and measures
arise naturally.

[9081-9091]
From dharma-nature ceasing, conduct—thalgyur! Wisdom perfect appears,
dharma-nature first appears, three perfections cease becoming. Thus experience
takes time: supreme effort three years, middle five, last eleven months.
Day six: dharma-nature ceases, light body free. Emaho! Bindu and light
perfection!

[9083-9093]
The commentary ends in recognition. What Longchenpa revealed is what you
are. Nothing added, nothing removed. Rest in the bindu that has always
been appearing.
