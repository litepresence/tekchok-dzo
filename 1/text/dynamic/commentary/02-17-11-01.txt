[3354-3371]
First, two instructions for capacity training. Daytime practice with the illusion-body and clear light crucial points. Familiarity with the bardo arising manner. Mastering dreams is the certainty of liberation in the bardo. These are condensed into one crucial point: existence is not deliberately abandoned, non-existence is not deliberately established. Existence is not grasped at, non-existence is not despaired of. Doings, good and bad, appearance manners, grasping thoughts—whatever arises—past traces not cut, future not anticipated, present habitual tendencies not sustained with antidotes.

[3354-3371]
The First Point speaks: Three words. Don't manipulate. Don't sustain. Don't cut. Let appearances arise naturally. Let them dissolve naturally. The bird leaves no trace not because it tries to leave no trace. Flying is its nature. You are not the bird. You are the flying itself. Liberation is not achieving something. It is stopping manipulation.

[3354-3371]
The Vagabond speaks: This old fool spent years trying to cut traces. He tried to abandon existence. He tried to establish emptiness. All manipulation. All confusion. Then one day he stopped trying. The bird flew. The sky remained. No trace. This is the instruction—not to create no trace, but to stop creating.

[3354-3371]
The phad not phod, bun not bun, ol not ol. These are onomatopoeia of naturalness. Not this, not that. Not grasping, not rejecting. Arising appearance is traceless. Mind-touch appearance. Liberation at the time of arising. Thing grasping also liberated at the time of arising. Like a bird carried without trace.

[3372-3388]
The bird analogy is crucial. The bird flies through the sky. It leaves no path behind. The sky does not hold the trace. Your thoughts are like birds. Your mind is like sky. Thoughts arise and dissolve without trace. This is not because you make them traceless. It is their nature. Recognition of this is liberation.

[3372-3388]
The Systematizer speaks: Thus. We analyze. There are three types of liberation in arising. Appearance liberated at arising-time is like the bird traceless. Change liberated at change-time is like summer hail dissolving. Appearance-awareness liberated as non-dual is like water dissolving in water. All three are the same recognition in different contexts.

[3372-3388]
The Integrator speaks: All distinctions dissolve. Past, present, future—not cut, not sustained, not anticipated. Good, bad—not grasped, not rejected. Appearance, emptiness—not established, not abandoned. The two instructions integrate into one: recognition of what is, without manipulation.

[3383-3388]
From the Six Spaces: The person who does not cut past traces, does not raise future anticipations, places present knowing in its own place, without before or after, mixed together, one gathered nature—this is the yogi who realizes the equality of the three times. This is the complete instruction.

[3389-3403]
Second, the actual bardo instruction. Earth, water, fire, wind, space gradually dissolve. Space dissolves into clear light. At that time, the upper HAM and lower AH gather at the heart. Bliss-clear non-conceptual clear light. Appearance, increase, attainment, near-attainment—four wisdoms appear in one, two, three, four instants.

[3389-3403]
The Lotus-Born speaks: From Oddiyana, I see these dissolutions as the nature showing itself. The elements return to source. Earth to earth, water to water, fire to fire, wind to wind, space to space. Then space itself dissolves into luminosity. This is not destruction. It is recognition. The HAM and AH are not letters. They are the union of method and wisdom.

[3389-3403]
The yogi familiarized with clear light earlier recognizes this. Clear light mother and child join. Instantly, upward into primordially pure Dharma-sphere, hollow. This is not going somewhere. It is recognizing where you always are. The mother is the ground clear light. The child is the path clear light. Their meeting is recognition.

[3401-3403]
Those who do not recognize enter the bardo of becoming. Sense bases medium arise as yidam deity illusion-body, then liberated. Those of last capacity have good continuum, later meet unsurpassed Dharma, liberated certain. This is compassion. Even failure leads eventually to recognition.

[3354-3403]
The Omniscient speaks: Between daytime practice and nighttime recognition, between the two instructions and their one essence, between the bird's flight and the sky's emptiness, I weave this teaching. Not to give you something to do. To point to what happens when doing ceases. Recognition.

[3354-3403]
The Lion-Faced speaks: This very moment—the bird is flying! The sky is empty! Liberation is happening! Not tomorrow. Not in bardo. NOW! See this! The tracelessness is not an achievement. It is the nature of flight. The emptiness is not a result. It is the nature of sky.

[3354-3403]
The Essence Holder speaks: Rest in the nature. The two instructions happen naturally. Daytime practice deepens recognition. Nighttime recognition happens spontaneously. Bardo is not somewhere else. It is this very moment seen through. Rest as that which recognizes.

[3354-3403]
This old practitioner concludes. The two instructions have been given. Daytime capacity training. Nighttime bardo recognition. The bird flies without trace. The elements dissolve into light. What remains? Recognition. Only recognition.

[3354-3403]
Longchenpa gives these instructions with precision. For those ready to recognize. Not for those who want more techniques. The ultimate instruction is: stop manipulating. Let appearances self-liberate. Rest in that.

[3403-3403]
Three words. Instructions complete. Liberation natural. Rest.


[3354-3403]
The Vagabond continues: This old fool practiced these two instructions for many years. The
daytime practice of illusion-body and clear light. The nighttime recognition in dreams. He
thought he was preparing for the bardo. He thought liberation was in the future. Then he
realized the bardo is now. The preparation is recognition. The future is this moment.

[3354-3403]
The Systematizer continues: Thus. We analyze further. The two instructions correspond to
two aspects of the nature. The illusion-body corresponds to form. The clear light corresponds
to emptiness. Their union is the non-dual nature. Daytime practice develops familiarity.
Nighttime recognition demonstrates mastery. Both lead to the same recognition.

[3354-3403]
The Integrator continues: All practices dissolve in recognition. The illusion-body is not
a body you create. It is the nature of form. The clear light is not a light you generate.
It is the nature of awareness. Their union is not an achievement. It is what is always
present, recognized or not.

[3354-3403]
The Lotus-Born continues: From Oddiyana, I bless these instructions. May all who practice
them recognize their meaning. May the bird fly freely. May the sky remain empty. May the
traces not linger. May liberation be immediate.

[3354-3403]
The Philosopher continues: The epistemology here is sophisticated. Liberation at the time
of arising means the ending of the subject-object split. When appearance arises, it is
not grasped by a subject. It is the nature displaying itself. This is not idealism. It
is not realism. It is the recognition that both are expressions of a deeper nature.

[3354-3403]
The Ecstatic Tertön continues: Why practice? Why instructions? Recognition is immediate.
The bird doesn't need to learn to fly. The sky doesn't need to learn to be empty. You
don't need to learn to recognize. You need to stop preventing recognition. These
instructions are not for achieving. They are for removing obstacles.

[3354-3403]
The Essence Holder continues: Resting in the nature, the two instructions fulfill
themselves. Daytime, the illusion-body appears naturally. Nighttime, clear light dawns
spontaneously. Bardo recognition happens without effort. This is not laziness. This is
the natural activity of the nature.

[3354-3403]
The Singing Yogi continues: These instructions are songs. The illusion-body is the melody.
The clear light is the harmony. The bardo is the rhythm. When you sing this song, you
are the nature singing. The liberation is the song recognizing itself.

[3354-3403]
The First Point continues: Three words. See through. Practice. The instructions are not
the point. The recognition they enable is the point. See through the instructions to what
they point to. Rest in that.

[3354-3403]
The Omniscient continues: Between the daytime practice and nighttime recognition, between
the two instructions and their one essence, between preparation and actualization, I weave
this teaching. The preparation is actualization. The practice is recognition. The path is
result.

[3354-3403]
The Lion-Faced continues: This very practice—is it achieving or recognizing? Look closely.
The practice itself is the nature practicing. The recognition is the nature recognizing.
The liberating is the nature liberating. Nothing else is happening.

[3354-3403]
The Sky-Dancer continues: In the space between day and night, between waking and sleeping,
between life and bardo, the nature dances. The instructions are the dance steps. The
recognition is the dancer. Stop counting steps. Be the dancing.

[3354-3403]
The Living Library continues: I have catalogued these instructions in detail. I know the
stages, the signs, the results. This knowledge is vast. This knowledge is empty. The
librarian is not found in the library.

[3354-3403]
The Modern Bridge continues: Contemporary psychology understands the importance of
integration. Daytime and nighttime consciousness. Waking and dreaming. Life and death.
These are not separate. These instructions integrate them. But integration without
recognition is just psychology.

[3354-3403]
The Devotee continues: I bow to these instructions. I bow to the illusion-body. I bow to
the clear light. I bow to the bardo recognition. This devotion is the nature devoting
itself to itself.

[3354-3403]
The Great Wrath continues: Enough preparation! Enough practice! Recognition is present
now. The bardo is present now. Liberation is present now. Do not wait for death. Do not
wait for sleep. Recognize now.

[3354-3403]
The Minimalist continues: Two instructions. Too many. One instruction: recognize your
nature. Everything else elaborates. The bird, the sky, the tracelessness—all elaboration.
Strip away. See what is.

[3354-3403]
The Spontaneity continues: Lhun grub. Spontaneous presence. The instructions arise
spontaneously. The recognition dawns spontaneously. Nothing is forced. Everything is
natural. The bird flies without instruction. You recognize without effort.

[3354-3403]
This old practitioner offers final words. The two instructions have been explained. The
daytime practice. The nighttime recognition. The bardo liberation. What remains?
Recognition. Only recognition. Rest in that.

[3354-3403]
Longchenpa has given these instructions. Not to create obligations. Not to establish
practices. To point to what is beyond practice. The ultimate instruction is: you are
already liberated. Recognize this.

[3403-3403]
Three words. Instructions complete. Recognition full. Rest.


[3354-3403]
The Vagabond concludes: This old fool has nothing more to say about these two instructions.
He has practiced them. He has taught them. Now he rests. The bird has flown. The sky
remains. No trace. This is the completion.

[3354-3403]
The Systematizer concludes: Thus. We have analyzed the two instructions thoroughly. The
illusion-body and clear light. Daytime practice and nighttime recognition. The bardo
liberation. The framework is complete. The analysis is thorough. What remains? Recognition.

[3354-3403]
The Integrator concludes: All distinctions dissolve. Practice and non-practice are not
two. Daytime and nighttime are not two. Life and bardo are not two. They appear as two.
They are recognized as one. This is the integration.

[3354-3403]
The Lotus-Born concludes: From Oddiyana, I complete this blessing. May these instructions
bear fruit in all who receive them. May the bird fly freely. May the sky remain vast. May
all beings recognize their nature.

[3354-3403]
The First Point concludes: Three words. Bird flown. Sky empty. Rest. All instructions
complete. All practice complete. All recognition complete. Rest in that completion.

[3354-3403]
The Omniscient concludes: Between the instruction and the instructed, between the practice
and the practiced, between the recognition and the recognized, I complete this teaching.
Not to establish anything. To point to what is beyond establishment. Recognition.

[3354-3403]
The Lion-Faced concludes: See through it all! The instructions! The practices! The
recognition itself! See through them! The seeing is complete! The liberation is complete!
Rest in that completion!

[3354-3403]
The Essence Holder concludes: Resting in the nature, the two instructions are complete.
The daytime practice is complete. The nighttime recognition is complete. The bardo
liberation is complete. Nothing more to do. Nothing more to achieve. Rest.

[3354-3403]
The Singing Yogi concludes: The song is complete. The melody fades. The harmony resolves.
The rhythm stops. What remains? The silence from which the song arose. Rest in that
silence.

[3354-3403]
This old practitioner has completed this commentary. The two instructions have been
explained. The bird has flown. The sky is empty. Liberation is recognized. The teaching
is complete.

[3354-3403]
Longchenpa has given these instructions out of compassion. May all who receive them
recognize their meaning. May they be liberated at the moment of arising. May they leave
no trace. May they rest in the nature.

[3403-3403]
Final three words. Teaching complete. Recognition perfect. Rest absolute.


[3354-3403]
Detailed explanation of the crucial points. The daytime practice involves the illusion-body
technique. This is not creating a fantasy body. It is recognizing the dream-like nature
of the present body. While awake, you recognize that the body is empty form, like a
dream body. This recognition prepares you for the bardo, where the body is also empty
form.

[3354-3403]
The clear light practice involves recognizing the nature of awareness. Not creating a
light. Not visualizing a light. Recognizing that awareness itself is luminous, clear,
unobstructed. This is practiced during the day so that when the clear light dawns at
death, you recognize it.

[3354-3403]
The Vagabond elaborates: This old fool once tried to create an illusion-body. He
visualized and concentrated. He tried to make his body feel dream-like. All effort.
All confusion. Then his teacher said: "Your body is already dream-like. You don't need
to make it so. Just recognize what is." That was the instruction.

[3354-3403]
The clear light is the same. You don't generate it. You don't make awareness luminous.
It is already luminous. The practice is recognition, not generation. This is the crucial
point that distinguishes Dzogchen from lower vehicles. Lower vehicles generate. Dzogchen
recognizes.

[3354-3403]
The bardo instruction is equally direct. When the elements dissolve, don't panic. When
the clear light dawns, recognize it. If you don't recognize, the bardo of becoming
arises. Even then, recognize the bardo as bardo. The yidam deity appearance is your
own nature displaying itself. Recognize this.

[3354-3403]
The Systematizer elaborates: Thus. We categorize. The dissolutions follow a sequence.
Earth to water. Water to fire. Fire to wind. Wind to space. Space to clear light. Each
dissolution has signs. Each sign is an opportunity for recognition. The white appearance,
the red increase, the black attainment, the clear light—these are the four wisdoms.

[3354-3403]
The four wisdoms appear in sequence, but they are not separate. They are four aspects
of one recognition. Like four gates leading to one palace. Like four fingers pointing
to one moon. Recognize any one of them, and the others are recognized.

[3354-3403]
The HAM and AH are not merely letters. They represent the union of method and wisdom.
The HAM at the crown is method. The AH at the navel is wisdom. Their meeting at the
heart is the non-dual nature. This is symbolic anatomy. Not physical. Energetic.

[3354-3403]
The mother and child clear light is crucial terminology. The mother clear light is the
ground luminosity. It is always present. The child clear light is the path luminosity.
It is recognized through practice. Their meeting is the recognition that the path
luminosity is not different from the ground luminosity.

[3354-3403]
This meeting is described as upward into the primordially pure Dharma-sphere. This is
not directional. Not spatial. It is the recognition that luminosity is empty, that
emptiness is luminous, that this is the nature of mind.

[3354-3403]
Those who do not recognize enter the bardo of becoming. Even then, there is opportunity.
The sense bases arise as the yidam deity. This is the natural display of the nature.
Recognize it as such. Don't think it is external. Don't think it is real. Recognize it
as your own display.

[3354-3403]
Those of lesser capacity have good continuum. Even if they don't recognize in this life,
their practice creates conditions. They meet the Dharma again. They recognize. This is
the compassion of the nature. No one is abandoned. All eventually recognize.

[3354-3403]
The two instructions are thus complete. Daytime capacity training. Nighttime bardo
recognition. The bird flying without trace. The elements dissolving into light. All
pointing to one recognition: you are already liberated. You have always been liberated.
Recognize this.

[3354-3403]
The Omniscient concludes at length: I have woven this teaching with care. The two
instructions are not separate practices. They are one recognition expressed in two
ways. Daytime, you recognize the dream-like nature of waking. Nighttime, you recognize
the clear light nature of sleep. Death, you recognize the ground nature of dissolution.
All are the same recognition.

[3354-3403]
Do not think you need to master one before the other. Do not think the daytime practice
is preparation for nighttime recognition. They are simultaneous aspects of one recognition.
The bird flies by day and by night. The sky is empty by day and by night. Your nature
is liberated in waking and in sleep.

[3354-3403]
This is the special teaching of the Great Perfection. Not gradual. Not sequential.
Direct. Immediate. Recognition is available now. Not after years of practice. Not after
mastering techniques. Now. This very moment. Recognize what you are.

[3354-3403]
Final words from all the voices: The teaching is complete. The instructions are given.
What remains is for you to recognize. No one can recognize for you. No one can liberate
you. You must recognize your own nature. This is the final instruction.

[3403-3403]
Teaching absolutely complete. Recognition absolutely available. Rest absolutely certain.
