[3354-3388] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, two instructions capacity training: daytime illusion-body clear light crucial point and bardo arising manner familiarity, dream mastering bardo liberation certainty. Also crucial point condensed: existence not deliberately abandoned, non-existence not deliberately established, existence not grasped, non-existence not depressed, doings and good-bad and appearance manner and grasping thought any, past trace not cut, future not raised, present habitual tendency antidote with not sustain, phad not phod, bun not bun, ol not ol, arising appearance traceless mind-touch appearance, appearance arising-time liberate, thing grasping, also that arising-time liberate, like bird traceless carried.

[3354-3388] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Liberate. Arising. Stop. You think liberation is somewhere else, later. Liberation is in the arising itself. The bird doesn't leave a trace—not because it tries, but because flying is its nature. Appearance is liberation. Arising is liberation. Stop looking elsewhere.

[3354-3388] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man loves this instruction! "Bird traceless!" You don't see the bird's path after it flies. The sky doesn't hold the trace. Your mind is the sky. Thoughts are birds. Let them fly. No trace remains. This is liberation.

[3354-3388] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The two instructions are method and wisdom—illusion-body method, clear light wisdom. Combined, they are the consort's embrace. Familiarity is not repetition. It is recognition deepened. Bardo liberation is not future hope. It is present recognition.

[3354-3388] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): BIRD! SKY! speaks with fierce compassion No trace! No trace! The bird is empty! The sky is empty! The flying is empty! Liberation is not in the future! It is NOW! SEE THIS!

[3389-3415] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, bardo actual instruction: earth water fire wind space gradually dissolve, space clear light dissolve time, central upper HAM lower AH two heart gather, bliss-clear non-conceptual clear light, appearance, increase, attainment, near-attainment wisdom four, instant one, two, three, four appearing. Earlier clear light familiarized yogi that recognize, clear light mother-child join, instant upward primordially pure Dharma-sphere hollow. Not recognize, becoming bardo sense bases medium yidam deity illusion-body arise, liberated. Last good continuum, later unsurpassed Dharma meet, liberated certain.

[3389-3415] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Dissolve. Recognize. Stop. The elements dissolve naturally. You don't need to do anything. Recognition is what matters. Recognize the clear light as yourself. Not mother meeting child—meeting what was never separate.

[Final] Two instructions for bardo mastery. Daytime practice becomes nighttime recognition. Liberation in arising, not after. The bird flies, no trace. You are the bird, the sky, the flying.

Emaho! The two instructions for liberation!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
