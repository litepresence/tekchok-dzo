The dispute: If permanent and impermanent exist together—if impermanent appears but permanent does not, then anything goes. Similarly, samsara would be liberated without recognition.
liberated ones would revert to confusion.

Second dispute: Rabbit horns and son of barren woman—if these impossible things could create samsara and nirvana, endless faults follow.

Response: The Buddha taught that these are projections of not recognizing one's own face— Because faults of non-recognition are endless, these positions fail.

The sixth position: Because essence appears everywhere, variegated appearances arise through not recognizing. This must be examined: Is multiplicity external appearance, internal consciousness, or aggregation?

If external: ground would appear manifold externally. If internal: ground would be momentary, conceptual, afflicted. If aggregation: ground would be dualistic. All lead to contradiction.

Recognition is immediate liberation.

Obstacles transform into path—gegs lam du khyer.

The box contains itself—complete from the first.

Delusion (ma rig pa) is wisdom's (ye shes) play wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Grasping at meaning liberates itself when seen.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Destination is departure point.

The gap between thoughts is where recognition dawns.

Not something to understand—awareness recognizing itself.
