The dispute: If permanent and impermanent exist together—if impermanent appears but permanent does not, then anything goes. Similarly, samsara would be liberated without recognition, and liberated ones would revert to confusion.

Second dispute: Rabbit horns and son of barren woman—if these impossible things could create samsara and nirvana, endless faults follow.

Response: The Buddha taught that these are projections of not recognizing one's own face—establishing all as existing through delusion. Because faults of non-recognition are endless, these positions fail.

The sixth position: Because essence appears everywhere, variegated appearances arise through not recognizing. This must be examined: Is multiplicity external appearance, internal consciousness, or aggregation?

If external: ground would appear manifold externally. If internal: ground would be momentary, conceptual, afflicted. If aggregation: ground would be dualistic. All lead to contradiction.

The recognition that liberates is always immediate.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

After centuries of concealment: the treasure was never hidden. Rediscovery reveals what was always present.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Between journey and destination, the ground includes both. Never departed from. Spacious presence.
