[14751] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Third, that nature momentary knowing mastered.

[14751] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Momentary. Knowing. Stop. In a moment, knowing is mastered. Not through duration, but through recognition. The nature reveals itself in an instant.

[Final] Third stage—knowing mastered in a moment.

Emaho! Knowing mastered!

See what is. Rest in recognition.
