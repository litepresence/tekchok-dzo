[14200-14200]
Sun-Moon Union What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. This is the treasury's heart.

[14200-14215]
The object, the deluded appearance, has outflows; dharmata free of elaboration, unmistaken, is without outflows. This is the treasury's heart.

Dancing in space, distinctions play and dissolve. Who dances? Just play! Ecstatic empty play! The meeting mind of these two is spoken thus

[14200-14237]
Thus sixty-eight in the first of six clairvoyances; twenty-four each in second and third; six each in remaining three—dividing parts makes one hundred thirty-four Rest in this understanding.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[14200-14201]
The thirty-six, the fifth, sense faculty way seeing six, have outflows Recognition is immediate.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[14201-14220]
: "Four winds gradually ceasing, great wind moving time; consciousness wind-mounted, wind trained; that above matured is crucial; rigpa gathering and throwing crucial; that too hi-gi throwing; that very guru's face meeting. Recognition is immediate.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating."

Rigpa's wisdom wind consciousness entering time

[14202-14203]
. The first group's five faculties' seeing others thirty are without outflows [14204]. Know the final as extremely without outflows [14205].

These also, from Union of Sun and Moon: "Thus arising, in that type, six clairvoyances arise: knowing past births, death and transition, birth, others' minds, invisible hidden all knowing, seeing and knowing six realms' abodes, and faculties purified clairvoyance—six arise"

[14206-14214]
. Recognition now. Not later.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The fourth, how dharani is obtained: All previously heard Dharma arises simultaneously, and previously unheard teachings also arise without measure, so called "dharmata bardo"

[14215-14217]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

From that: "At that time, unforgetting dharanis also arise in your own continuum. All previous teachings arise simultaneously in the continuum. Likewise, previously unheard teachings also arise, so called dharmata bardo"

[14219-14224]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

No process needed. No gradual opening. Immediate access to what was always present.

Emaho!

[14221-14240]
, here transference, instructions here clearly pointed out. Sun-Moon Union: "Then guru's instructions, own mind familiarized; these meanings clearly point out."

Breath-transference time

[14225-14266]
My heart-children, pay attention! The fifth, how samadhi is born: At that time, in pure dharmata nature, intellect's engagement ceases and you abide non-conceptually Rest in this understanding.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[14225-14226]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

How it ceases: What ceases ceases in your own continuum [14228]. How does it cease? Grasping previous qualities' appearance as dharmata pure mode ceases

[14229-14230]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Open. Was never closed.

After centuries of concealment: the treasure was never hidden. Rediscovery reveals what was always present.

What appearance at that time? Dharmata ceased appearance arises, so bad conceptual thoughts of previous attachment, future grasping, good clairvoyance, memory, and so forth definitely do not arise—like pure sky

[14231-14233]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

It is not that the distinction is wrong. It is that the distinction-maker has no self-nature. Seeing this liberation.

From Union of Sun and Moon: "Continuous samadhi continuum self-arising as nature, bad conceptual thoughts definitely do not arise"

[14235-14236]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The Treasury's path vast oceanic ground. What seemed journey was always waves on water never leaving water.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

At this stage, know the twenty-one faculties' liberation and delusion ways [14237].

The sixth, how spontaneous accomplishment dissolves: Previously arisen now gathering within

[14240-14241]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The text translates what was never foreign. Completion before language.

Eight modes of dissolving arise simultaneously [14242]:
- Compassion dissolving into compassion: like sun's rays gathering at sunset
- Six realms' appearance not seen in own face, impure delusion nameless, beyond visible appearance
- Light dissolving into light: like rainbow melting in sky, light and color signs' distinction gone, empty beyond grasping, single taste in dharmadhatu
- Form dissolving into form: like vase form, objects clear within, no signs' features as face and hands, pure
- Wisdom dissolving into wisdom: like child entering mother's lap, dharmata mother and child nondual, no grasping
- Non-duality dissolving into non-duality: like river into river, originally liberated, single taste as dharmakaya, equal, without distinction, free of elaboration

Diamond precision: pierce the distinction-maker. Obstacles transform into diamond wisdom. Liberation through wrath.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[14241-14260]
, entering object and place—transference; entering kaya and wisdom—space-awareness instruction. Two; also in space-awareness, familiar ones not depending on other conditions, and depending—two explained, thus instructions threefold.

Third: depending on other conditions

[14242-14252]
Emaho! What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Logical necessity: if the path leads to ground, and ground is primordial, then path was always ground. Non-dual.

[14260-14277]
Listen well, fortunate ones! Wisdom dissolving into wisdom is like a child entering the mother's lap [14260]. Light dissolving into light is like a rainbow melting in space [14261].

THUNDER! Sudden! The distinction-maker liberated in wrathful compassion! Obstacles become the path! NOW! Form dissolving into form is like a vase [14262].

[14261-14277]
—that time guru or vajra sibling, samaya without wavering, clearly points out. Recognition is immediate.

From sky-treasure of Oddiyana: the lotus never closed! Primordial completion blazing!

[14267-14269]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

This old fool spent years making distinctions. Then he saw: the fool and the distinctions same empty grassland.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The first: Methods shown for hitting the crucial point in both this life and bardo

[14270-14272]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

From Oddiyana's sky: the path blazes as ground itself! Never departed!

From essence, nature, and compassion three crucial points:

Essence's crucial point: Recognize your own face directly, decide directly that it is so, and be confident directly of liberation—three

[14275-14277]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

First: Though nature appears as various lights, essence is rigpa radiance not beyond one, the empty-luminous original purity ground—decide this is your own face, the final liberation place, directly introduced as true seeing
