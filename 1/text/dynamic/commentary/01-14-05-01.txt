[18610-18615]
From the Thalgyur Tantra: the wisdom of appearance is taught. From earth, water, fire, wind, and space, wisdom-appearance wondrously arises. The Bhagavan, unexcelled Lord, transcends contact. This is not philosophy but direct pointing—the five elements are not obstacles to wisdom but its very display. Earth is solidity as wisdom; water is flow as wisdom; fire is transformation as wisdom; wind is movement as wisdom; space is openness as wisdom. The elements don't hide wisdom; they express it.

—

[18610-18615]
The key word: "transcends contact." The Bhagavan is not touched by what appears, not stained by the elements, not bound by manifestation. Yet this transcendence is not escape—wisdom appears wondrously. The wonder is that transcendence and appearance are not two. The Lord transcends contact while remaining in contact; is free from the elements while being their very nature.

—

[18616-18620]
From within emptiness itself, wisdom sought by analysis is not found. This is crucial: wisdom cannot be found by looking, by analyzing, by seeking. Why? Because wisdom is not an object. The seeker is wisdom; the seeking is wisdom; the not-finding is wisdom. Analysis seeks a thing; wisdom is no-thing. From severing concepts of the three realms, the five doors' fixation-stream is cut.

—

[18616-18620]
Severing concepts of the three realms: desire, form, formless. These are not places but states of mind, and concepts about them bind more than the states themselves. The five doors—the five senses—stream fixation continuously. Cut this stream not by closing the doors but by recognizing what flows through them. The stream is cut when its source is seen as empty.

—

[18620-18631]
Moon and jewel, lapis lazuli light—whatever one desires to emanate, seize the appearance of the emanation body arisen from grasping. Or else, from knowing the essential point of great perfection, wisdom itself free from activity, like space, transcends conceptual elaboration and reference. Two approaches: work with emanation through grasping, or rest in wisdom beyond activity.

—

[18620-18631]
The first approach uses desire—the wish to emanate, to manifest, to create. This is skillful means for those who need engagement. Seize the emanation body; work with it; transform it. The second approach transcends means—know the essential point, rest free from activity like space. Both lead to the same recognition, but the second is direct, immediate, complete.

—

[18620-18631]
Wondrous, marvelous wisdom—not before, not after, not primordially existent. Now transcending objects of conceptual mind, the nature free from extremes, emptiness itself. Beyond words, free from intellect, empty of essence. This is not description but pointing. Don't analyze these words; follow where they point.

—

[18631-18641]
Since nature is not divided anywhere, compassionate activity does not appear. This is the profound point: non-division is not inactivity. When nature is recognized as undivided, activity doesn't cease—it transforms. Activity without actor, compassion without compulsion, benefit without effort. From the threefold wisdom-appearance, mind-arising, insight, and delusion-appearances are held. This has no object of observation, no extreme.

—

[18631-18641]
Threefold wisdom-appearance: mind-arising (the coming forth of consciousness), insight (the knowing quality), delusion-appearances (the mistaken identification). All three are held in wisdom—none rejected, none affirmed, all recognized as display. No object of observation: nothing to look at, nowhere to look from. No extreme: neither existence nor non-existence, neither eternalism nor nihilism.

—

[18631-18641]
From the marvelous play of neither existence nor non-existence, Buddhas attain the result. Externally and internally, all is dharmadhātu. Here nothing whatsoever appears. The play is marvelous because it defies categories—neither existing nor not-existing, yet vividly present. Buddhas attain: not by gaining something but by recognizing what is. All is dharmadhātu: not a place but the nature of all places, the space in which appearance appears.

—

[18642-18659]
Third, the wisdom of objects: when form and the other five objects are self-liberated, the nature of the four appearances progressively increases. Form, sound, smell, taste, touch—the five objects. Self-liberated not by transformation but by recognition. When seen as they are, they liberate themselves; no one liberates them. The four appearances increase: the progression of recognition from appearance to increase to attainment to exhaustion.

—

[18642-18659]
From the varieties of form and sound, the experiences to be trained become fivefold. The experience of consciousness exhausted is appearance, waxing like the moon's bright fortnight. Each appearance has its own experience. Five experiences corresponding to the five senses, each trained, each recognized, each liberated. Consciousness exhausted: the conceptual mind at rest, the intellect silent, the recognizing awareness vivid.

—

[18642-18659]
Waxing like the moon: the increase of recognition, the brightening of awareness, the fullness approaching. Not linear but cyclic, not gradual but quantum, yet described as waxing for those who need stages. Each appearance has its own experience: the uniqueness of each perception, the particularity of each recognition, the specificity of each liberation.

—

[18650-18670]
Furthermore, the wisdom of objects is taught. From warmth, measure, and signs, the two truths inseparably joined, concept-extremes exhausted. Warmth: the preliminary experience of approach. Measure: the signs of progress. Signs: the indications of recognition. Two truths—conventional and ultimate—not separate but joined, not sequential but simultaneous.

—

[18650-18670]
Without action, characteristics are empty. Since the basis of expression ceases, extremes do not dwell. Since outflows are exhausted, there is no clinging. The source of memory cut, essence clear. No action: not inactivity but action without actor. Characteristics empty: forms without inherent existence. Basis of expression ceases: the conceptual mind comes to rest. Extremes do not dwell: neither existence nor non-existence takes up residence.

—

[18650-18670]
Outflows exhausted: the leakage of awareness into distraction, into concept, into grasping—is ended. No clinging: not by effort but by exhaustion of the conditions for clinging. Source of memory cut: the chain of association, the stream of thought, the continuity of delusion—is severed. Essence clear: what remains when all this is cut? Clarity. Luminosity. Awareness.

—

[18670-18695]
Clear awareness does not conceive objects' extremes. Since it is free from sound, genuine, without words—rest in this understanding. Clear awareness: rigpa, the knowing quality of mind, stripped of content, free from concept. Does not conceive extremes: neither this nor that, neither existence nor non-existence, neither subject nor object. Free from sound: not deaf but beyond the duality of sound and silence.

—

[18670-18695]
Genuine: not fabricated, not constructed, not made. Without words: language points but does not capture, indicates but does not contain. Rest in this understanding: not thinking about it but resting as it, being it, recognizing it. This is the instruction—simple, direct, complete.

—

[18695-18720]
Voice of wisdom: This is not analysis. This is not philosophy. This is pointing at your own mind. The wisdom of appearance is not a doctrine to believe but a recognition to discover. Look at your own experience—every sight, every sound, every thought. Is it not appearing? Is it not known? This appearing-knowing is wisdom. Don't seek it elsewhere.

—

[18695-18720]
The all-ground gathers habits; Dharmakaya is free from habits. Yet they are not two separate things. The all-ground is Dharmakaya appearing as if obscured. Dharmakaya is the all-ground recognized as pure. The difference is not in the nature but in the recognition. Like water and ice—same essence, different apparent state, difference dissolved when warmth is applied.

—

[18720-18745]
Voice of the practitioner: I have sought wisdom in teachings, in practices, in experiences. Now I see: wisdom is the seeking itself, the looking itself, the awareness within which all this appears. Not found by seeking; found by stopping seeking. Not attained through practice; recognized as never lost. Not experienced in special states; present in every ordinary moment.

—

[18720-18745]
The wisdom of objects—form, sound, smell, taste, touch—when self-liberated, is not transformed into something else. Form remains form; sound remains sound. But the grasping at them, the fixation on them, the identification with them—that is liberated. Form becomes transparent; sound becomes spacious; the object becomes the subject; the known becomes the knowing.

—

[18745-18770]
Voice of completion: The Thalgyur Tantra speaks of wisdom appearance, wisdom of objects, clear awareness. These are not three different things. They are three descriptions of one recognition. Appearance is wisdom when recognized. Objects are wisdom when self-liberated. Awareness is clear when unobscured. The teaching is complete; the recognition is yours; the liberation is now.

—

[18745-18770]
Warmth, measure, signs—these describe the path for those who need stages. But the stages are not the destination. The destination is not reached by progressing through stages but by recognizing that the destination was never departed from. The two truths joined—not sequentially but simultaneously, not analytically but directly.

—

[18770-18790]
Voice of exhaustion: I am tired of seeking. I am tired of practicing. I am tired of waiting for wisdom to dawn. Good. This exhaustion is wisdom. This tiredness is recognition. The seeker exhausted is the wisdom sought. Rest in this exhaustion; don't renew the search. What remains when seeking ceases? That is what you have been seeking.

—

[18770-18790]
Neither existence nor non-existence—this is not a position to take but a position to transcend. Don't believe in existence; don't believe in non-existence. Don't even believe in the middle way between them. Rest in what cannot be described, what cannot be believed, what cannot be grasped. This resting is wisdom appearance.

—

[18790-18810]
Voice of simplicity: All this elaboration—elements, senses, objects, wisdom, appearance—is for those who need it. For those ready, one word suffices: recognize. Recognize what? This. Here. Now. The awareness reading these words. That is wisdom. That is Dharmakaya. That is liberation.

—

[18790-18810]
The Bhagavan transcends contact—not by avoiding contact but by being untouched in contact, unstained in manifestation, unbound in display. This is the mystery: freedom within engagement, transcendence within immanence, purity within manifestation. Don't seek this elsewhere; it is your own nature.

—

[18810-18830]
Voice of finality: This completes the commentary on the Thalgyur Tantra's teaching on wisdom appearance. The all-ground has been distinguished from Dharmakaya. The five elements have been recognized as wisdom display. The objects have been seen as self-liberated. Clear awareness has been pointed out. What remains is not more teaching but direct recognition. May all who read this recognize their own wisdom nature. May all be liberated.

[18610-18830]
This extensive section from the Thalgyur Tantra presents the wisdom of appearance in all its dimensions. From the five elements as wisdom display to the all-ground and Dharmakaya distinction, from the self-liberation of objects to the clear awareness beyond words—the teaching is complete, profound, and direct.

—

[18610-18620]
The wisdom of appearance arises from the five elements—not in spite of them, not by transcending them, but as their very nature. This is the key insight: earth, water, fire, wind, and space are not obstacles to be overcome but expressions to be recognized. The solidity of earth is wisdom's stability; the flow of water is wisdom's adaptability; the transformation of fire is wisdom's power; the movement of wind is wisdom's energy; the openness of space is wisdom's vastness.

—

[18610-18620]
The Bhagavan transcends contact—meaning not that he avoids manifestation but that manifestation doesn't bind him. Like a lotus rising from mud unstained, like a bird flying through space without leaving a trace. Contact occurs; manifestation appears; yet the Lord remains free. This is the model for the practitioner: engage fully without being bound, participate completely without being stained.

—

[18620-18631]
Wisdom cannot be found by analysis because it is not an object. The analytical mind seeks things; wisdom is no-thing. The more you analyze, the further you go from wisdom. The moment analysis ceases, wisdom is present—not arrived at, not achieved, but recognized as never absent. This is why the text says wisdom is not found within emptiness itself—not because it is absent but because seeking presumes a seeker and sought, and wisdom transcends this duality.

—

[18620-18631]
Severing concepts of the three realms: this is not intellectual exercise but direct cutting. The three realms—desire, form, formless—are conceptual constructs. Sever these concepts and what remains? The five doors' fixation-stream is cut. The five senses no longer bind; perception becomes liberation; experience becomes wisdom. This is not special perception but ordinary perception recognized.

—

[18631-18641]
Two approaches to emanation: through grasping or through wisdom. The first uses the path of desire—the wish to manifest, to create, to emanate. This is valid; this is skillful means; this leads to recognition. But the second approach is more direct: know the essential point, rest free from activity like space. No grasping, no wishing, no effort—just recognition, just resting, just being.

—

[18631-18641]
Wisdom not before, not after, not primordially existent—this negates all temporal categories. Wisdom doesn't exist in time; time exists in wisdom. Now transcending objects of conceptual mind—this points to immediate recognition, not future attainment. The nature free from extremes: neither eternalism nor nihilism, neither existence nor non-existence, neither affirmation nor denial. Emptiness itself: not a thing called emptiness but the empty nature of all things.

—

[18642-18659]
The wisdom of objects: form, sound, smell, taste, touch. When self-liberated, these don't disappear; they become transparent. The four appearances increase progressively: from the initial recognition of appearance, through its increase, to attainment, to exhaustion. Not linear stages but aspects of deepening recognition. Each appearance has its own experience—unique, particular, specific to that moment of recognition.

—

[18642-18659]
Five experiences corresponding to five senses, each trained through recognition, each liberated through awareness. Consciousness exhausted: the conceptual mind comes to rest, the intellect falls silent, the natural awareness becomes vivid. Waxing like the moon—the metaphor of increase, of brightening, of approaching fullness. Yet wisdom is always full; the waxing describes the recognition, not the wisdom itself.

—

[18650-18670]
Warmth, measure, signs—the preliminary experiences, the indications of progress, the marks of approaching recognition. But these too must be transcended. The two truths joined: conventional and ultimate not separate categories but simultaneous aspects. Inseparably joined—not first one then the other, not one inside the other, but two ways of describing one reality.

—

[18650-18670]
Without action, characteristics are empty. This is crucial: emptiness is not achieved through action; it is the nature of characteristics. Since the basis of expression ceases—language, concept, thought come to rest—extremes do not dwell. No place for existence or non-existence to take up residence. Outflows exhausted: the leakage of awareness into distraction ends. No clinging: not by effort but by exhaustion of conditions.

—

[18650-18670]
Source of memory cut: the chain of association, the stream of thought, the continuity of delusion—severed. What remains? Essence clear. Not something new but something revealed, not something achieved but something recognized. Clear awareness: rigpa, the knowing quality, stripped of content, free from concept. Does not conceive extremes: neither this nor that, free from duality.

—

[18670-18695]
Free from sound: not the absence of hearing but the transcendence of the sound-silence duality. Genuine: not fabricated, not constructed. Without words: language points but doesn't capture, indicates but doesn't contain. Rest in this understanding: the instruction is to rest, not to think, not to analyze, not to seek. Just rest in what is.

—

[18695-18720]
Voice of the teacher: Don't seek wisdom. Don't practice for wisdom. Don't wait for wisdom. Wisdom is present—in this seeing, this hearing, this knowing. The all-ground gathers habits; Dharmakaya is free. Yet they are one nature seen differently. Like water and ice—same essence, different state. Recognition is the warmth that melts ice back to water.

—

[18720-18745]
Voice of the student: I have sought everywhere—in scriptures, in practices, in experiences. Now I understand: seeking was the obstacle. The seeker is the sought. The looking is what was looked for. Wisdom was never absent; recognition was always possible. I stop seeking; I start being. This being is wisdom.

—

[18745-18770]
The objects—form, sound, smell, taste, touch—when self-liberated, remain what they are. Form is still form; sound is still sound. But the relationship changes. No longer grasped, no longer fixated, no longer identified with. Form becomes transparent; sound becomes spacious; touch becomes light. The object reveals itself as subject; the known shows itself as knowing.

—

[18770-18790]
Voice of exhaustion: I am tired. Tired of seeking, tired of practicing, tired of waiting. This tiredness is wisdom. The exhaustion of seeking is the birth of recognition. When seeking ceases, what remains? Awareness. Luminosity. Wisdom. Don't renew the effort; rest in the exhaustion. What is present when effort stops? That is what you sought.

—

[18790-18810]
Neither existence nor non-existence—don't take this as a position. Don't believe in the middle way. Rest in what cannot be described. This resting is wisdom appearance. The Bhagavan transcends contact—model this not by avoiding life but by engaging without being bound. Full participation, complete freedom.

—

[18810-18830]
Final voice: The teaching is complete. The wisdom of appearance has been explained. The all-ground and Dharmakaya distinction has been clarified. The self-liberation of objects has been described. Clear awareness has been pointed out. What remains? Your recognition. May you recognize. May you be liberated. This completes the commentary on the Thalgyur Tantra's teaching on wisdom appearance.
