[16769-16771] This old man searched for the blue in books for years! Then someone told me—open your eyes. Look between your eyebrows. There's the treasury. Not in some other world—in this body, in this moment.

[16772-16777] Snake-noose rays shoot from the fence. The bindu's light-house moves slightly. You feel it as dizziness, as bliss, as fear. Don't name it. Let it move.

This is unfabricated essence. You already know this—when dreams dissolve at night, the blue appears. The fence is the rim of the wheel. Self-luminous objects appear. This is the essence, unfabricated.

[16789-16796] Vast sphere, uncut expanse. Pure appearance meets pure condition. Five colors together. You think this is description? It is instruction. Look now. The sphere is vast. The expanse is uncut. Pure appearance meets pure condition. Five colors together—you think this is just description? It is instruction. Look now, don't think later.

[16789-16796] The teachers describe it and you think it's poetry. But it's instruction! Vast sphere—look at it. Five colors—see them. Don't just understand with mind. See with eyes.

[16809-16814] Aspects appear as objects. Pure defilement exhausted in number. Lamp's vajra chain-circle. 

[16809-16814] Aspects appear as objects. Are they real? The defilement is pure—exhausted in number. The lamp's vajra chain-circle—the bindu light. Don't think attainment is necessary. It's already complete.

[16815-16820] Definitive meaning: nature itself from-beginning gather-separate nonexistent. Thus. The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[16815-16820] Three words. Nature. Gather. Nonexistent. The definitive meaning: nature from the beginning—gathering and separating are nonexistent. The teaching undermines the understander. The understander is the final obstacle.

Emaho! The blue bindu! The treasury! The five colors!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
