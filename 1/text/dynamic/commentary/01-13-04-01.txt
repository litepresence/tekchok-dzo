[16769-16771] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Blue at the center. The bindu, the essence drop, sits in the center of the channel wheel. You search for this in scriptures? Open your eyes. The space between your eyebrows is the treasury. The blue light, the dhatu, is there.

[16769-16771] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man searched for the blue in books for years! Then someone told me—open your eyes. Look between your eyebrows. There's the treasury. Not in some other world—in this body, in this moment.

[16772-16777] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Snake-noose rays shoot from the fence. The bindu's light-house moves slightly. You feel it as dizziness, as bliss, as fear. Don't name it. Let it move. The rays shoot from the rim of the wheel. The bindu moves. The experience is unusual—dizziness, bliss, fear. Don't label it. Let it be.

[16772-16777] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Move. Feel. Stop. The rays shoot. The bindu moves. You feel it—dizziness, bliss, fear. Don't name what you feel. Let it move. The naming is the trap.

[16778-16783] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Who familiarizes with this meaning? You already do, every night when dreams dissolve. Blue, unchanging, self-luminous. The fence abides at the rim. Self-luminous outer objects appear. This is unfabricated essence. You already know this—when dreams dissolve at night, the blue appears. The fence is the rim of the wheel. Self-luminous objects appear. This is the essence, unfabricated.

[16778-16783] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Look at your dreams dissolving. What remains? The blue, unchanging, self-luminous. This is rigpa. Not something you create. Something you discover. The fence at the rim—where appearance meets emptiness. Self-luminous objects appear—display without doer.

[16784-16788] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First gaze: sky-blue pervades the treasury-brow. Colors five arise within. Rainbows at the eye's corners. Pearl garlands. Like sky-rainbow, pure of afflictions. The first gaze—sky-blue pervades the treasury at the brow. Five colors arise. Rainbows at the corners. Pearls like garlands. Like rainbows in the sky—pure, without affliction.

[16784-16788] Voice 04 (Padmasambhava): The first gaze opens the treasury. Blue pervades. Five colors arise—five wisdoms. Rainbows at the corners—manifestations of the dakinis. Pearl garlands—qualities unfolding. Like a rainbow in clear sky—pure, untainted by clouds.

[16789-16796] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Vast sphere, uncut expanse. Pure appearance meets pure condition. Five colors together. You think this is description? It is instruction. Look now. The sphere is vast. The expanse is uncut. Pure appearance meets pure condition. Five colors together—you think this is just description? It is instruction. Look now, don't think later.

[16789-16796] Voice 13 (Patrul): The teachers describe it and you think it's poetry. But it's instruction! Vast sphere—look at it. Five colors—see them. Don't just understand with mind. See with eyes.

[16797-16802] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Rigpa's self-object appears through display. Defilement nonexistent—completely pure. The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Chain-circle grasp from appearance-awareness clarifies through this lamp.

[16797-16802] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Display. Pure. Stop. Rigpa's self-object appears through display. Defilement is nonexistent—completely pure. The path is not walked—it is realized as the ground itself. Never departed from.

[16803-16808] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Vajra itself is chain-circle. It enters inside. Self-essence is not thought. Inside expanse, go-space—not grasping, non-abiding. Continuous appearance without separation. The vajra is the chain-circle. It enters inside. The self-essence is beyond thought. Inside the expanse—go to space. Not grasping, not abiding. Continuous appearance without separation.

[16803-16808] Voice 06 (Consort): The vajra—indestructible, like the chain-circle that enters inside. Self-essence—not thought, not concept. Inside expanse—space without boundary. Not grasping, not abiding. Continuous appearance—the display never stops.

[16809-16814] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Aspects appear as objects. Pure defilement exhausted in number. Lamp's vajra chain-circle. What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[16809-16814] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Aspects appear as objects. Are they real? The defilement is pure—exhausted in number. The lamp's vajra chain-circle—the bindu light. Don't think attainment is necessary. It's already complete.

[16815-16820] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Definitive meaning: nature itself from-beginning gather-separate nonexistent. Thus. The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[16815-16820] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Nature. Gather. Nonexistent. The definitive meaning: nature from the beginning—gathering and separating are nonexistent. The teaching undermines the understander. The understander is the final obstacle.

[16821-16828] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Three divisions: ground, path, fruit. Ground—expanse completely pure, pristine awareness and light abide clear. Path—expanse pure, bindu essence gathered at center. Fruit—chain-circle bound, light five webbed.

[16821-16828] Voice 13 (Patrul): Three divisions: ground, path, fruit. Ground—pure expanse, pristine awareness, light clear. Path—expanse pure, bindu gathered at center. Fruit—chain-circle bound, five-colored light webbed. Three things, one essence.

[16829-16835] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Projection below, design, etcetera. Lamp blazing. Three aspects exist. Ground—pure expanse, rigpa's pristine awareness body grasped. Path—expanse, rigpa's bindu essence gathered. Object—expanse, chain-circle bound.

[16829-16835] Voice 04 (Padmasambhava): Projection, design, lamp blazing—three aspects. Ground: pure expanse, rigpa's awareness body. Path: expanse, bindu gathered. Object: expanse, chain-circle bound. Three names for one reality.

[16836-16841] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Intention ka-pure and spontaneous-accomplish—two nonexistent. This is nature. Appearance unceasing. What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[16842-16848] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thought nonexistent of awareness. Not-move equality knows. All cease into space. Primordial thought cease. Nature completely pure, abiding in space. Express and appearance-word two nonexistent.

[16842-16848] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Thought is nonexistent in awareness. Equality—not moving—knows. All cease into space. Primordial thought ceases. Nature is completely pure, abiding in space. Expression and appearance—two nonexistent. Look now. Is there thought? Is there thinker?

[16849-16853] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Outer and inner nonexistent into space. Self-ease great state abide. Thus. The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[16854-16862] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Self-awareness's space ka-pure, open, primordially abiding. Outer inner nonexistent open. Unobscured, stain nonexistent. Primordial ka-pure great. Completely pure space. Characteristics primordially abide. The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Five characteristics: outer light's space empty, clear, open.

[16854-16862] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Space. Pure. Abide. Self-awareness's space—primordially pure, open, abiding. Outer and inner nonexistent in open. Unobscured—stain nonexistent. Five characteristics: empty, clear, open.

[16863-16865] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Six habituate manner. Samsara-nirvana distinction cut—body speech natural place put. What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[Final] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The bindu blue at the center. The treasury at the brow. Five colors arise. Vast sphere, uncut expanse. Ground, path, fruit—three divisions. Rigpa's self-display, completely pure. The path is not walked but realized. The ground was never departed from. Appearance and expression—two nonexistent. Space and nature—primordially pure.

Emaho! The blue bindu! The treasury! The five colors!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
