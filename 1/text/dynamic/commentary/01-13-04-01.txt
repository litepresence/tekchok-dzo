[1-3] Blue at the center. The bindu, the essence drop, sits in the center of the channel wheel. You search for this in scriptures? Open your eyes. The space between your eyebrows is the treasury. The blue light, the dhatu, is there.

[4-6] the meditation cave at Drak Yerpa hermit... searched for the blue in books for years! Then someone told me—open your eyes. Look between your eyebrows. There's the treasury. Not in some other world—in this body, in this moment.

[7-12] Snake-noose rays shoot from the fence. The bindu's light-house moves slightly. You feel it as dizziness, as bliss, as fear. Don't name it. Let it move. The rays shoot from the rim of the wheel. The bindu moves. The experience is unusual—dizziness, bliss, fear. Don't label it. Let it be.

This is unfabricated essence. You already know this—when dreams dissolve at night, the blue appears. The fence is the rim of the wheel. Self-luminous objects appear. This is the essence, unfabricated.

[25-30] Look at your dreams dissolving. What remains? The blue, unchanging, self-luminous. This is rigpa. Not something you create. Something you discover. The fence at the rim—where appearance meets emptiness. Self-luminous objects appear—display without doer.

[31-35] First gaze: sky-blue pervades the treasury-brow. Colors five arise within. Rainbows at the eye's corners. Pearl garlands. Like sky-rainbow, pure of afflictions.

Pure appearance meets pure condition. Five colors together—you think this is just description? It is instruction. Look now, don't think later.

[49-56] The teachers describe it and you think it's poetry. But it's instruction! Vast sphere—look at it. Five colors—see them. Don't just understand with mind. See with eyes.

[57-62] Rigpa's self-object appears through display. Defilement nonexistent—completely pure. Thus. The path reveals itself as the ground. What seemed journey was always arrival. Chain-circle grasp from appearance-awareness clarifies through this lamp.

[81-86] Aspects appear as objects. Pure defilement exhausted in number. Lamp's vajra chain-circle. 

[87-92] Aspects appear as objects. Are they real? The defilement is pure—exhausted in number. The lamp's vajra chain-circle—the bindu light. Don't think attainment is necessary. It's already complete.

[92-97] Definitive meaning: nature itself from-beginning gather-separate nonexistent. Thus. The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[92-97] Three words. Nature. Gather. Nonexistent. The definitive meaning: nature from the beginning—gathering and separating are nonexistent. The teaching undermines the understander. The understander is the final obstacle.

[90-97] Three divisions: ground, path, fruit. Ground—expanse completely pure, pristine awareness and light abide clear. Path—expanse pure, bindu essence gathered at center. Fruit—chain-circle bound, light five webbed.

[90-97] Three divisions: ground, path, fruit. Ground—pure expanse, pristine awareness, light clear. Path—expanse pure, bindu gathered at center. Fruit—chain-circle bound, five-colored light webbed. Three things, one essence.

[92-97] Intention ka-pure and spontaneous-accomplish—two nonexistent. This is nature. Appearance unceasing. What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[91-97] Thought nonexistent of awareness. Not-move equality knows. All cease into space. Primordial thought cease. Nature completely pure, abiding in space. Express and appearance-word two nonexistent.

[93-97] Outer and inner nonexistent into space. Self-ease great state abide. Thus. The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[89-97] Self-awareness's space ka-pure, open, primordially abiding. Outer inner nonexistent open. Unobscured, stain nonexistent. Primordial ka-pure great. Completely pure space. Characteristics primordially abide. The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Five characteristics: outer light's space empty, clear, open.

Emaho! The blue bindu! The treasury! The five colors!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
