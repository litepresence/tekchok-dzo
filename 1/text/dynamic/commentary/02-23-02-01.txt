[1-106]
Through the lama's blessing and your own sincere practice, even those with lesser faculties can progress. Do not be discouraged by thoughts of unworthiness.

[1-106]
One parted from bempo rig, dwelling in the suffering of fearing death. Dharmata bardo's appearance This is the treasury's heart.

From Oddiyana's sky-treasure: concepts bloom and dissolve like lotus in fire. The distinguisher was never born!

The Treasury weaves distinctions to reveal what transcends all weaving. Seeing this the Great Perfection.

[1-106]
The path is not long or short—it depends on your recognition. For some, liberation comes in an instant. For others, it takes months or years. Do not compare yourself to others. Practice according to your own capacity.

[1-106]
: aggregates' self-grasping support abandoned, kaya and wisdom's dharmata appears directly; karma and habitual patterns' connection severed, nature's samadhi dharmata is enjoyed; faculties' grasping objects emptied, self-appearing clear light dharmata is practiced. The nature is complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Samsara bardo's appearance

[1-106]
In the end, all displays dissolve into the expanse of dharmata. The lights fade, the forms dissolve, and only the clear light remains. This is the dharmakaya—the body of truth itself. Rest there without wavering.

Emaho!

[1-106]
: outer body's samsara, mental body with complete faculties moving without obstruction; inner mind's samsara, various thoughts moving and engaging; body-mind gathered samsara, moving without obstruction to all except two supports. Recognition is immediate.

THUNDER! Treasury blazes! Was never closed! Sudden recognition! NOW!

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Two supports

[1-106]
: vajra seat accomplished through blessing, and mother's womb. Scholars generally identify the vajra seat as India, but here it is ka-dag's unchanging inner space, excellent place where all buddhas awaken, pure nirvana's door. Mother's womb is impure samsara's door, any of six realms' birth-places—not literal words.

Emaho!

[1-106]
Thus has been explained the twenty-first chapter on the key points of thod rgal practice. The wisdom of direct transcendence is the swift path to buddhahood in one lifetime.

[1-106]
have two truths, two intentions—four modes. Tantra sections have literal and non-literal—six limits to be known.

I mapped all paths. Then forgot: the ground was never mapped. Never departed from.

The Thalgyur states

[1-106]
Through the practice of lamp-gazing, you see the displays of your own awareness. Through these displays, you recognize your true nature. Through this recognition, you are liberated.

[1-106]
: "Bardo's appearance: nature-abiding aggregates, elements, afflictions as objects; death-point like bubbles floating, awareness not abiding one-pointedly. This is the treasury's heart.

Treasury never closed. See.

While walking, the path reveals itself as ground. Just footsteps on earth. Never left.

[-20405--20395] First, three aspects: difficult to find, thinking thus, leisure without distraction, training in dharma; training dharma shown; impermanence certain, cause thinking thus, constant renunciation and weariness generated; death certain, example thinking thus, when needed, emptiness's profound meaning meditated.

[1-106] A simple practitioner... once thought he had plenty of time! Tomorrow, next month, next year—always postponing practice. Then a friend died suddenly. No warning. No time to prepare. That's when this teaching became real. Difficult to find this leisure. Don't waste it.

[-20405--20395] The precious human existence—eight freedoms, ten endowments—like a turtle surfacing to find a golden yoke. Impossibly rare. Yet here you are. Reading these words. This is the opportunity. Don't squander it on trivialities.

[1-106] Difficult to find! Precious! Look directly—can you find what finds? Can you grasp what is precious? The finder and found are one! The precious is ordinary! AH!

[-20405--20395] Three words. Find. Waste. Stop. You think existence is precious. You think time is abundant. Both are mind's constructs. Find what was never lost. Stop wasting what was never yours.

[-20394--20370] Therefore. Thus. The six difficulties establish necessary conditions: birth in favorable realm, obtaining human existence, meeting qualified teacher, entering authentic teaching, receiving profound instructions, abandoning samsara. Six-fold rare opportunity.

[1-106] The six difficulties integrate into complete framework. Each prerequisite enables the next. Missing any, the chain breaks. Integration means recognizing all six are present now—for the reader, the practitioner, the fortunate one.

[-20394--20370] This mountain dweller... checked himself against these six! Born in Jambudvipa? Yes. Leisure and endowments? Mostly. Met lama? Yes. Entered dharma? Yes. Know upadesha? Working on it. Abandoned samsara? Not completely. That's the practice.

[1-106] Six difficulties! Six opportunities! All numbers! Cut through them! Can you find the first difficulty? Can you grasp the sixth? They are simultaneous! Complete from the beginning! AH!

[1-106] The four great wheels—favorable place, holy beings, former merit, self-practice—turn together. Missing one, the vehicle doesn't move. All four present? Then move! Don't wait for better conditions. These are the best conditions.

[-20369--20340] The lower realms—hell, hungry ghost, animal—not punishments. They are mind's projections when recognition fails. But they are also dharmata's display. Even there, recognition is possible.

[1-106] Therefore. Thus. Karmic causality: past actions present results; present actions future results. Good karma—beautiful, wealthy, controlled. Bad karma—ugly, poor, controlled by others. Precise moral phenomenology.

[12311-One without learning...agabond saw karma at work! Beautiful people with ugly minds. Poor people with generous hearts. Karma is not fair in human terms. It is precise in dharmic terms. Every condition is opportunity for recognition.

[-20339--20300] Three words. Karma. Appearance. Stop. You think karma determines appearance. You think appearance confirms karma. Both are mind's constructs. Stop the wheel. Rest in recognition.

[1-106] Between the six difficulties and the karmic results, between precious existence and lower realms, the consort dances. The precious body is her gift. The recognition is her embrace.

[-20405--20300] The presentation demonstrates precise moral psychology. Six difficulties establish opportunity. Karmic causality establishes consequence. Impermanence establishes urgency. Death establishes necessity.

[1-106] The recognition of precious existence arises spontaneously—not through calculation, not through fear. When conditions ripen, the waste becomes obvious. The practice becomes natural.

[-20405--20300] Philosophically, this establishes samsara's faults and liberation's benefits. Not nihilistic denial of existence but recognizing its unsatisfactory nature. The middle way between eternalism and nihilism.

[1-106] The Treasury's presentation of precious existence and impermanence is complete. May all who read these words recognize the rarity of their opportunity. May they practice without delay. This is the prayer of Longchenpa.

[One without learning... old vagabond's final teaching: Don't wait. Practice now. The six difficulties are overcome. The conditions are present. Recognition is available. Rest in it.

[-20405--20300] Final words. Precious. Impermanent. Practice. Stop. The teaching on precious existence is complete. The conditions are present. You are complete. Rest. The end.

[1-106] Emaho! The precious existence! The lower realms! The karmic causality! What richness! What urgency! This yogi dances with gratitude—not because existence is pleasant but because it is opportunity! Liberation is possible!

[-20405--20300] I have met practitioners motivated by fear of lower realms. Others by desire for enlightenment. Both work. But recognition is independent of motivation. It happens when conditions ripen—not through fear, not through desire, but through seeing.

[1-106] The scholarly enumeration of six difficulties and karmic results fascinates me—yet within this precision lives the wild freedom of direct recognition. The numbers are not the point. The recognition is the point.

[-20405--20300] From the sky of dharmata I dance down into precious existence. The difficulties are my dance steps. The leisure is my stage. The recognition is the dancer who was never separate from the dance.

[1-106] The precious existence thunders with fierce compassion! What difficulty? What opportunity? Cut through all with one stroke! The existence is empty! The practice is empty! SEE THROUGH IT ALL!

[-20405--20300] The precious existence is bliss! The opportunity is bliss! The practice is bliss! Not pleasure-bliss but recognition-bliss! Complete from the beginning!

[1-106] The heruka dances through the six difficulties! Each one a step closer! Each one a doorway! HA HA HA! The dance is the practice! The dancer is the recognition!

[-20405--20300] The essence beyond all difficulties: you were never separate from what you seek. The precious existence is not rare—it is obvious. The practice is not difficult—it is natural. Recognize this and all is complete.

[1-106] Between the detailed presentation of precious existence and the direct simplicity of recognition, the Great Perfection holds both. The difficulties serve the recognition. The recognition encompasses all difficultiI sat in retreat once...] This old vagabond's absolute final word: The six difficulties are not obstacles. They are invitations. The precious existence is not achievement. It is recognition. Stop seeking. Start recognizing. Complete.

[-20405--20300] Absolute final words. Difficulties. Recognition. Complete. Stop. The end of all teachings. The beginning of all practice. Rest. Complete. Perfect.
