[2989-2992]
First: When sound is heard, only sound-holding consciousness arises. As with form and so forth, the holding consciousness does not arise simultaneously. When consciousness enters an object, only that consciousness arises—others do not. Whatever the number of aspects, that many consciousnesses are asserted.

The Mind-Only school establishes their position through sequential analysis. When hearing occurs, the auditory consciousness alone manifests. Visual form-consciousness remains dormant. This sequential arising proves distinct consciousnesses for each object domain.

This old yogi. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The egg metaphor [2995-2998] is curious—like cracking an egg to find inside and outside are both still egg. Aspects and consciousness, outer and inner—both arise from the same mind-substance. Beginningless habits make them seem two, but self-awareness alone exists.

[2995-3008]
As an egg is split—what a profound image! The shell divides yet the substance remains one. When holding objects now, outer aspect-consciousness and inner-holding consciousness both arise. Through beginningless latent tendencies, they appear dual, yet in self-awareness alone nothing else is established.

The monkey in the fortress [3004-3006]—entering through five apertures, looking and looking. One consciousness knowing through five doors. At the moment of knowing, aspect and consciousness are not different in the nature (rang bzhin) of a single mind. Like dream appearance and dream-holder—both undifferentiated in single sleep-consciousness.

[2995-2998]
See what is. Rest in recognition. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The egg splits—inside, outside—both mind. Beginningless habits make two where there is one. Self-awareness alone. Nothing else established.

[3009-3014]
This binding—look closely. Is anything truly holding?.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The false aspects—outer meaning appearing mistakenly to consciousness. False latent tendency! Not true to consciousness! Experience measures truth—no measurement exists! Both object and consciousness are merely mistaken false appearance!

See through it! The stain is not the cloth! The cloud is not the sky!

[3015-3016]
SUDDEN. Thunder strikes the false! The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Three divisions: false with stain, false intermediate, pure wished-for. The Mind-Only school catalogues like merchants counting coins. But where is the counter? 

Stainless suchness—beyond their categories!

[3009-3016]
Second: The false aspects. The outer meaning aspect appearing mistakenly to consciousness is a false latent tendency—not true to consciousness. The meeting consciousness measures falsity. Experience measures truth—no measurement exists. Both object and consciousness are merely the nature (rang bzhin) of mistaken false appearance.

In this, there is division: the false with stain, the false intermediate, and that which is wished—the stainless, the pure. The Mind-Only school establishes a hierarchy of refinement leading to stainless suchness.

[3015-3016]
Like washing a dirty cloth—first the heavy mud, then the fine dust, then the pure white. The Mind-Only path is gradual purification. But who holds the cloth? Who does the washing? 

The stain and the stainless—both appear to mind. Beyond both, who knows?
 The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.
