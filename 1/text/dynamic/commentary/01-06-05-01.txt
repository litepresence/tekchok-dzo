First joy—entering wisdom, propelling and gathering winds. Dga' ba,
the bliss of initiation. Not something you create, but what arises when
create conditions without grasping. Like kindling arranged, fire comes—
not by forcing, but by proper preparation.

'Jug pa'i ye shes—entering wisdom, propelling and gathering winds. The
winds of prana that propel consciousness into experience, then gather it
back. In first joy, these winds are recognized as wisdom's play, not
obstacles to control.
