[6424-6455]
Seventh: samsara-destroyer king. In intervals of sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons, holding this secret heart-essence, acting for beings' benefit—until great strife aeon, Vajradhara's great Brahma arrangement. Sequence from Secret Conduct Seed Tantra: each aeon, each Buddha enumeration, each retinue liberation manner. First: primordial first Buddha to strife aeon—sixty-six actually taught within inexpressible, teaching all sixty-four hundred-thousand number.

[6456-6485]
Primordial first Buddha: First, superior Smṛti-protector. Mudrā of self-remembering wheel. Word distinguishing superior from base. Śikhin, previous beginning arisen. Seventy myriads: this mudrā supreme. To: wisdom-protector of exhausted mindfulness. Essence, self-word, secret understood. Strife aeon: nineteen lineage-holders. Definitive mudrā supreme held. Inexpressible: from Buddhas' blessings, in self-arisen great letter, great primordially pure abiding. From descent, all self-arisen. Blessing sequence self-shown from first descent.

[6486-6511]
Inexpressible: other aeons, interval aeons' Buddhas condensed. From Great Arrangement: primordial first Buddha, supreme thousand mandala gathered. Second teaching: Śikhin, world protector. Supreme thousand: this mudrā. Third: thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector. Thousand Buddhas' heart essence rolled. Fourth: thousand suns' king. Thousand Buddhas' dominion conquered. Fifth: Jvalamukha, world protector. Supreme thousand's heart concealed. Sixth: thousand light-rays' rim-protector. Thousand families: this concealed. Seventh: all-pervading samsara-destroyer, Brahma-protector. Thousand great bliss: crown held. Thus teaching: sixty-four hundred-thousand, that many Buddhas, great secret fully held.

[6512-6546]
Definitive teaching Buddhas: nineteen hundred-thousand, this mudrā essence rolled. Sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons: great Brahma aeon. First protector's sixty-four hundred-thousand emanations arrangement, emanating as nineteen hundred-thousand Buddhas to disciples' perception, acting for benefit. King supreme Samantabhadra's abode: great Brahma arrangement. Teaching showing deed in Kaustubha jewel's sky, thirteenth within Vairocana's palm lotus petals center. All that kaya's abodes, five families' other abodes: teaching showing deed transcends thought. Buddha's deed, qualities, activities: three kayas equal to sky. Tenth-ground bodhisattvas cannot measure; worldly mind how can measure?

[6547-6573]
From Uttaratantra: Buddha-element, Buddha-awakening, Buddha qualities, activities—even for pure beings, inconceivable. From Ratnaketu: sky pervaded, kaya pervades that much. Kaya pervaded, light pervades. Light pervaded, speech pervades. Second: obtained liberation enumeration. Jambudvipa: great secret definitive teaching liberates hundred-thousand non-human dakinis beyond number. This occasion: liberation in this life and bardo—men, women, fully ordained, boys, girls enumeration. From Great Arrangement: Listen, fortunate monk Pal. Not abiding here, until sixty years life: one thousand liberation results arising self-release. Monk form, half; remainder bodhisattvas. Until fifty: two hundred-thousand obtain birthless. Mostly females' form; males two thousand. Then thirty years: six hundred-thousand, mostly males, by one hundred-thousand females. Arising self-release. Former retinue, degenerate time, obtained Buddhahood.

[6574-6600]
An old practitioner once tried to calculate these numbers. Sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons. Nineteen hundred-thousand Buddhas. He spent years with his calculations. One day, watching prayer flags snap in the wind, he understood: the numbers were not for counting. They were for showing the vastness beyond counting.

Recognition is immediate. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[6621-6640]
Analysis proceeds. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[6641-6660]
This old yogi. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[6661-6680]
The enumeration itself—does it point to something countable? Look beyond the numbers.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[6681-6700]
Between the elaborate enumeration of aeons and Buddhas and the direct recognition of Dzogchen, we find the treasury's heart. Not rejecting the numbers. Not grasping them. The architecture of time and space points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6701-6710]
The samsara-destroyer king is not a being who will come in some future aeon. The king is awareness itself, destroying samsara moment by moment. Each recognition is the destruction of cyclic existence. Each liberation is the crowning of the king.

[6711-6720]
What knows these words? The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[6721-6725]
Thus. We proceed.
 Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
