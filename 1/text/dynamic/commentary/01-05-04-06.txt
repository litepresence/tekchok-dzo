[6424-6424] Seventh: the saṃsāra-destroyer king. The culmination of the seven buddhas of this great aeon. Not a destroyer of worlds, but a destroyer of the illusion of saṃsāra itself.

This old fool once thought "destroyer" meant someone violent! Like a warrior conquering enemies. Then he understood: the saṃsāra-destroyer destroys nothing. He sees through what was never there. Like realizing a dream is a dream—the dream doesn't need destroying, only recognition.

Three words. Samsara. Dream. Wake. Stop. The destroyer doesn't end saṃsāra. Saṃsāra ends itself when seen through. Recognition is the only destruction needed.

Samsara-destroyer? What saṃsāra? Look directly! Can you find it? Can you grasp it? The looking destroys what was never built. The recognition completes what was never incomplete.

[6425-6433] In intervals of sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons, holding this secret heart-essence, acting for beings' benefit. Until the great aeon of strife-possessing, arranged by Vajradhara of the great Brahma. Vast time scales—not for measurement, but for showing the inexhaustible nature of compassionate activity.

Therefore. Thus. bKal pa 'bum phrag drug cu rtsa bzhi—sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons. Precise enumeration: the number 6,400,000 represents the fullness of time in which the secret essence remains effective. Not literal chronology but pedagogical completeness.

Sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons—immeasurable time. Yet the heart-essence remains unchanged. What persists through such vastness? Not a teaching, not a text, but recognition itself. Recognition is timeless. It persists when aeons come and go like breaths.

[6434-6455] From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra: the sequence of seven buddhas. First, the primordial first Buddha—Smṛti-protector, the self-remembering wheel. The word distinguishing superior from base. Śikhin, arisen at the previous beginning. Seventy myriads: this mudrā supreme.

This old hermit memorized these seven names! Smṛti-protector, Śikhin, and the rest. Thought knowing the names meant knowing the teaching. Foolish! The names are doorways. Walk through them, don't count them.

The seven buddhas are not historical figures to be worshipped. They are aspects of your own awakening—seven phases of recognition, seven ways wisdom manifests. The first Buddha is your first glimpse. The seventh is full recognition.

I sing of the seven buddhas in seven valleys. Each valley different, each song different, but the singer is the same. The seven buddhas are seven songs of one voice—your voice, singing itself awake.

[6456-6485] The inexpressible: from the Buddhas' blessings, in the self-arisen great letter of great primordially pure abiding. From descent, all self-arisen. The blessing sequence self-shown from first descent. From the Great Arrangement: the primordial first Buddha, supreme thousand maṇḍala gathered.

Self-arisen. Self-shown. Self-liberated. Three words, one meaning. Nothing comes from outside. Nothing is achieved. Nothing needs creating. Stop adding. Stop seeking. Rest in what is.

Inexpressible! The teaching that cannot be spoken! Yet here it is—spoken! The paradox is the teaching. The unspeakable spoken. The ungraspable grasped. See through both, find what neither includes nor excludes.

[6486-6511] The second teaching: Śikhin, world protector. Third: thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector. Fourth: thousand suns' king. Fifth: Jvalamukha, world protector. Sixth: thousand light-rays' rim-protector. Seventh: all-pervading saṃsāra-destroyer, Brahma-protector.

This old man watched students obsess over these numbers. "Which Buddha corresponds to which century?" they ask. Wrong question! The question is: which Buddha corresponds to your recognition right now? That's the only Buddha that matters.

Seven buddhas, each with thousandfold retinues—seven thousand manifestations of one wisdom. The multiplicity is pedagogical, not ontological. One sun, seven windows. One ocean, seven waves. One recognition, seven expressions.

[6512-6546] Definitive teaching Buddhas: nineteen hundred-thousand, this mudrā essence rolled. Sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons: great Brahma aeon. First protector's sixty-four hundred-thousand emanations, emanating as nineteen hundred-thousand Buddhas to disciples' perception.

Therefore. Thus. Mathematical precision: 64 × 100,000 = 6,400,000 emanations, appearing as 1,900,000 Buddhas—a ratio of 1:3.37. The emanation system reflects pedagogical efficiency: many forms, one essence.

Nineteen hundred-thousand Buddhas—all appearances of Samantabhadra in the abode of great Brahma. One jewel, many facets. One sky, many clouds. One mind, countless thoughts. The number is infinite, yet each Buddha is complete.

[6547-6581] King supreme Samantabhadra's abode: the teaching showing deed in Kaustubha jewel's sky. The Buddha's deed, qualities, activities: three kāyas equal to sky. Tenth-ground bodhisattvas cannot measure; worldly mind how can measure? From Uttaratantra: Buddha-element, Buddha-awakening, Buddha qualities, activities—even for pure beings, inconceivable.

This old fool tried to measure the Buddha's qualities! With what? His tiny mind? Like trying to measure the ocean with a teaspoon. The tenth-ground bodhisattvas—so close to full awakening—still cannot measure. What chance do we have?

Three words. Measure. Immeasurable. Stop. The Buddha's activity cannot be measured because it is not other than awareness itself. You don't measure awareness. You rest in it. That's the only measurement needed.

[6582-6625] From Ratnaketu: sky pervaded, kāya pervades that much. Kāya pervaded, light pervades. Light pervaded, speech pervades. Second: obtained liberation enumeration. In this Jambudvīpa, by this great secret definitive teaching, hundred-thousand non-human ḍākinīs beyond number are liberated.

Liberation counts! Numbers of liberated beings! Look beyond the counting. Each number represents recognition. Each liberation is this very recognition. Not cumulative achievement but instantaneous awakening, repeated endlessly.

The liberation counts are not statistics. They are encouragement—showing the effectiveness of the teaching. Like a physician saying "this medicine cured thousands"—not to boast, but to inspire confidence in the patient.

[6626-6710] From Great Arrangement: Listen, fortunate monk Pal. Until sixty years life: one thousand liberation results, monk form half; remainder bodhisattvas. Until fifty: two hundred-thousand obtain birthless. Thirty years: six hundred-thousand, arising self-release.

This old vagabond loves these numbers! Not because they're precise, but because they show hope. Even in degenerate times, liberation is possible. Even ordinary people—monks, laypeople, men, women—can awaken. The teaching works.

I have met some of these liberated ones. Ordinary people with ordinary lives. Nothing special about them—except recognition. They saw through the game while still playing it. That's the secret: play fully, but know it's play.

[6711-6780] Third: predictions of certain vidyādharas. From Thalgyur: After I pass into nirvāṇa, in western Uḍḍiyāna land, to Dhana Kośa's goddess, a fatherless son—VajraHE—will hold the supreme teaching. His successor in the west: a brahmin's fortunate child, Mañjuśrīpati, holding seventy-five years.

Therefore. Thus. Prophetic lineage structure: VajraHE (Yeshe Tsogyal's incarnation), followed by Mañjuśrīpati, then Sosa Gling householder Śrī Siṅha, then Jaṅsuṭra of caṇḍala caste, then Karmapa holding great mudrā. Precise succession: twelve holders until the teaching flourishes for ten years, then self-release.

Twelve lineage holders—twelve aspects of transmission. Each holder necessary, each complete in themselves. The lineage is not a chain but a net—each node connected to all others. Break one link, the net remains.

[6781-6850] Thus our supreme teacher, monk Pal, protector of beings Kumārarāja—predicted emanations up to the limit. Particularly every hundred years in this Tibet, Vimala's emanations will clarify this essence abode. This is the supreme one with the letter A mark on the forehead, nose-tip possessed.

This old man knew some of these emanations! Met one in a mountain pass. Met another in a marketplace. Never knew who they were until later. The emanations don't announce themselves. They work quietly, planting seeds. Only in retrospect do we see their footprints.

Emanations. Predictions. Lineages. All skillful means. The truth is simpler: recognition is always available. Right now. To anyone. No lineage required. No prediction needed. Just look. Just see. Just rest.

[6851-6920] Homage to the protector of beings, greatly compassionate, ornament of the world, teacher appearing today. Clarifying the teaching of luminous essence, proceeding to the peaceful realm—homage with devotion. Though not passing to nirvāṇa's single peace, beholding beings' benefit, with final activity—homage to the amazing pervading world.

I sing to the teacher who gave everything. His life, his teaching, his presence—all offered freely. When he passed, the forests trembled. The sky filled with five-colored light. Music sounded from empty space. Not myth—witnessed. The passing of a great being shakes the world awake.

The final activities of realized beings are not endings but transformations. The body dissolves into light. The teaching remains in the world. The blessing continues. Death is just another emanation—changing form, not ending existence.

[6921-7000] Thus in Jambudvīpa, the assembly of vidyādharas and victors holding the supreme teaching flourishes, passing through seven generations. These who encounter this are liberated from saṃsāra's fortress without effort—ornaments of Jambudvīpa appearing.

This old vagabond's final words on this vast teaching: Don't get lost in the numbers. Don't get dazzled by the emanations. Don't worship the lineage. Just recognize. That's the whole point of all these words—all these Buddhas, all these aeons, all these liberations. Just recognition.

Vast aeons! Countless Buddhas! Endless liberations! All point to this very moment. This very awareness. This very recognition. Nothing else is needed. Nothing else exists. AH!
