Emaho! The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

[1-310]
Non-duality dissolving into non-duality is like a river dissolving into a river [1]. Freedom from extremes dissolving into freedom from extremes is like space dissolving into space [1]. Pure wisdom gate dissolving into essence original purity is like a lion taking a snow mountain [1].

 Impure samsara gate dissolving into pure wisdom gate is like drawing in a silken cord [1].

After centuries of distinction, the rediscovery: the distinguisher was never other. The fifth, extensive explanation of essential instructions that liberate into those, has two: hitting the key point with dharmata meaning essential instruction, and focusing with three times essential instruction

[-20405--20403]
. 

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Second: In that nature, without fabrication, naturally in meditation, cut through completely, without distraction, without grasping—this is meditation

[1-310]
, bardo's clear light like that carrier, those two bridge-joined; space-awareness carrier similar appearance shown: "Son of family, this present clear light is self-arisen wisdom itself—without modifying mind, rest in this nature; upward zangthal you become Buddha. Recognition is immediate.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating."

Also

[1-310]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Third: At that time, free of meditation object and subject, rigpa pure from ground shines and liberates, without abandoning good-bad thought collections, self-liberated—confidence and repetition

[1-310]
. The Great Perfection transcends gradual and sudden. Recognition is the nature itself immediate as awareness.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Emaho!

[1-310]
My devoted students, listen! In natural ground, though various appear, they do not exist as appearance. Gather into one all-knowing pure luminosity, self-clear self-arising wisdom, and meditate with repetition

[1-310]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The word points. The pointing liberates. Who translates?

That grasping also liberates—nothing else to do. This is the essential instruction of light-appearance liberating into dharmata

[1-310]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Looking outward, clear inward rigpa, instantaneously naked essence—this is the second vital great essential instruction

[1-310]
. 

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

See the ground. Walking dissolves.

Compassion's vital point: Though various external objects to be tamed arise as conditions, and many rigpas to tame appear radiating, do not cut the outward radiating traces, do not examine your own face, do not negate inwardly—whatever arises, leave it in its own place, directly settled, boundless naked clear rigpa, grasping that, seeing liberation place truly

[1-310]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

That very clear free rigpa, without gaps, directly settled, exhausted, pure "ka"—this and bardo awareness arising unceasing are grasped, then ka-pure compassion rigpa is known and liberated

[1-310]
: "Look without changing this appearance; present clear light dharmata mother's clear light, all appearances buddha-fields dawning, mixed will become; that time recognize self-appearance; that time ka-dag ground you become Buddha. Recognition is immediate.

Dancing completion! Never closed! Sky itself is the treasure!

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle vast oceanic completion. Never closed. Never opened. Simply what is."

There not recognizing

[1-310]
. This is the third essential great essential instruction [1].

Dancing in space, distinctions play and dissolve. Who dances? Just play! Ecstatic empty play!

These three are secret heart essence amrita, extremely pure, extremely secret [1]. Words few but meaning great, sutra-tantra few but essential great, depth essential but importance great. To heart-sons supreme, not others, seal of essential instruction

[1-310]
. 

After centuries of seeking paths: the ground was never left. Rediscovery of what was always present.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Emaho!

[1-310]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

See the ground. Walking dissolves.

"Furthermore, dharmata nature explained: Here not one certain, whatever labeled thus appears. From various name bases, words and phrases' elaboration appears. From uncertain various names, meaning also empty of mere labeling. Since emptiness not established anywhere, nature pure thus appears"

[1-310]
, clear light lhundrub dissolving time, kaya and wisdom's appearance dawns; then four wisdoms' meeting appearance dawns; then lhundrub's eight doors dawning—you recognize self-appearance; self-recognized immediately ka-dag ground you well-go, three times spoken; oneself also that appearance equally placed, again there clear pointing. The nature is complete.

Why wait even a moment! The distinction burns in recognition! The maker dissolves NOW!

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

That certainly liberates

[1-310]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

From sky-treasure of Oddiyana: the lotus never closed! Primordial completion blazing!

"Furthermore, dharmata compassion explained: Objects to be tamed various, taming forms also that many. From lineage and faculty displays, samsara-nirvana realization different. That itself placed as individual object is uncorrected meaning's intention"

[1-310]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Three words. See through. The divider.

The second, focusing with three times essential instruction, has two: three times' places and method essential instructions

[1-310]
. Sun-Moon Union: "If space-awareness unclear, dharmata bliss bardo, rigpa's appearance grasping, before shown lights mind-do; that obtains true appearance. If those unclear, own guru present, above instruction clearly point; no guru, vajra sibling, awareness's clear pointing do."

Thus instructions pointing

[1-310]
You who wish to be free, understand! The three essential points with citations: The nature is complete.

Resting in the view, the path is the resting itself. Ground without departure. Spacious presence.

From Talgyur: "Furthermore, dharmata essence: established as essence from nature. Since appearance mode is not one certain, entering paths are also different. With face, knowledge, and liberation seeing, entering, seeing, and habituation. From face recognition, own face. Confident heart is the place. Decided, confidence enters. Thus three's certain activity: essence complete, cause ceases"

[1-310]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Diamond ground indestructible path. Never departed. Piercing clarity of unity.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Place vital points three: entering knowing key point, liberation own face key point, completion face knowing vital point

[1-310]
. THUNDER! Sudden recognition! Immediate liberation! No stages! NOW!

No process needed. No gradual opening. Immediate access to what was always present.

Emaho!

[1-310]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The Treasury weaves distinctions to reveal what transcends all weaving. Seeing this the Great Perfection.

Thus. The analysis dissolves the analyzer. Categories collapse into recognition.

Aggregates' self-grasping ceasing, body liberates as clear light, dharmata abides in own face. Elements coarse and subtle particles liberated, appearance abides as clear light great bliss. Afflictions coarse and subtle liberated, rigpa abides as mother and child dissolved

[1-310]
. 

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Outer delusion purified, rigpa knows meeting dharmata mother, and various conditioned appearances as objects liberate from coarse and subtle things, mother and child nondual liberation [1].

How liberated? Earth element's characteristics self-purified, body's flesh bindings liberated. Water purified, blood; fire purified, warmth; wind purified, breath bindings liberated

[1-310]
, prolonged death or dharma-view disharmonious others, death-point with three jewel instructions benefit others shown: breath outer stopped, inner not stopped time, oneself momentary dharmata direct intention placed; then other person's breath separated, gap that mouth-nose three and own mouth-nose three joined. The nature is complete.

Emaho!

[1-310]
. No thought horse, flesh and blood self-continuum grasping liberated. Inner rigpa without affliction stains, five wisdoms self-display. Objects' stains without, phenomena and dharmata nondual

[1-310]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Between seeking and finding, the treasury was never hidden. Spacious completeness includes all.

Emaho!

[1-310]
. Thus. We distinguish gradual paths from immediate recognition. The Treasury points directly.

Logical necessity: if the path leads to ground, and ground is primordial, then path was always ground. Non-dual.

Contemporary mind makes distinctions. Contemporary recognition sees through. Direct. Immediate.

Third, completion face knowing key point: Rigpa reaching spontaneous accomplishment precious jewel's own place, abiding in nondual original purity and spontaneous accomplishment, knowing that

[1-310]
Listen, my fortunate ones! The first: When rigpa enters outward clear light appearance, know radiance as self-display [1]. When light enters inward into rigpa, know not moving from that ground of original purity [1].

Second: At the time of four wisdoms preparation, outer, inner, and secret three liberations abiding in own face, knowing own face essential instruction—grasping that

[1-310]
. Dancing recognition! Immediate! Not learning steps! Now! Ecstatic!

Path is ground. Never walked.

All samsara's phenomena purified at that time, so previous delusion not experienced is decided. Now impossible to delude, obtaining body of no-return, rigpa itself no-return place

[1-310]
: outward first dum-bu white om contemplated, thrown; second red ah with thrown; last whatever not contemplated, thrown. Returning three all hum contemplated, that awareness blue hum own rigpa drawn.

Speech also hum

[1-310]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

THUNDER! Ground blazes! Path never walked! Sudden recognition! NOW!

THUNDER! Treasury blazes! Was never closed! Sudden recognition! NOW!

Samsara's deluded appearance, nirvana's pure appearance, when both dissolve into that dharmadhatu, existence and non-existence, permanence and nihilism not established anywhere, so samsara-nirvana equal, gone to ground liberation—at that time of spontaneous accomplishment dissolving, know thus [1].

This is rigpa own face's great key point [1].

Second, method essential instruction has two: previous essential instruction and this time's sharp-dull difference

[1-310]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Emaho!

[1-310]
reciting, drawn to gap under foot, strongly drawn. That time own body-speech-mind three strengthened, drawn inside gap, his wind warm completely inside comes out—certain.

That time other person's eyes hri-gi comes

[1-310]
My heart-sons and daughters, understand! Thus abiding in own face, knowing thus, afflictions cannot arise in rigpa. Liberated from samsara's karmic ripening. Since afflictions cannot abide in rigpa's own face, secret rigpa dharmata—existence, non-existence, permanence, nihilism, thing and emptiness aspects do not fall anywhere. Outer objects and subjects, inner various thoughts holding as different, secret rigpa itself grasping also none—knowing own face

[1-310]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Third topic: Summarizing meaning through self-display faculties' liberation way has three: faculties' division generally shown, liberation-delusion sequence specifically explained, and faculties' individual liberation way extensively spoken

[1-310]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

From sky-treasure of Oddiyana: the lotus never closed! Primordial completion blazing!

Emaho!

[1-310]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Wisdom appearance manner one, delusion basis of aspects one, realization measure one, knowing analysis one, self-display liberation manner one—each arise separately, so faculties also explained as twenty-one

[1-310]
. While walking, recognition dawns. Immediate. Not after ten thousand steps. Now.

Between journey and destination, the ground includes both. Never departed from. Spacious presence.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

From Self-Arising: "Hey faithful retinue, listen! I have taught beings' ignorance. Since appearance arising modes are twenty-one, understand these well"

[1-310]
; then body also har rising able comes. Thus arisen, eye's thusness dharmata direct appearance shown; eyes arisen, thigle empty space lamp thumb-index showing, like placed, clear light self-existing this is; from body exiting time, dharmata bardo self-equipped dawning, self-appearance this is, not other—recognize self.

Three times struck

[1-310]
. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Faculties shown with three types: supreme, medium, supreme has seven—supreme's final, supreme's medium, supreme's supreme, supreme's peak, supreme's excellent, supreme's best, supreme's complete

[1-310]
. IMMEDIATE! Why gradual? Liberation NOW! Not next life! THIS MOMENT!

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

This is supreme's division. That also, seeing-return one, wisdom appearance birth manner one, realization measure one, understanding time one, knowing analysis one—arising and abiding stability in respective appearance obtained

[1-310]
, appearance seen or instruction heard, saying, voice emerging good; sign arisen also succeeded. Dharmata bardo non-conceptual samadhi obtained, becoming Buddha certain.

Sun-Moon Union

[1-310]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Medium also has seven—medium's final, medium's medium, medium's supreme, medium's peak, medium's excellent, medium's best, medium's complete. That also wisdom birth measure one arises

[1-310]
Listen well, you who practice the Dharma! Previous essential instruction: Having grown familiar with three vital points, recognizing face—like recognizing a familiar object, at that time without doubt, liberated Recognition is immediate.

Secret instruction: the distinction-maker is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight dissolves the moon.

[1-310]
. 

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

This time's essential instruction: Sharp rigpa rising from ground like a shooting star in space, instantly knowing own face and liberating

[1-310]
. Dull rigpa, not recognizing appearance's distinctions, through power of previous profound practice, like a lion cub separating from womb, coarse purified, instant five, twenty-one faculties' whichever way liberated This is the treasury's heart.

Already complete. Before seeking.

[1-310]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

These also from Union of Sun and Moon: "This time has three: entering time, liberation time, completion time"

[1-310]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Why wait even a moment! The distinction burns in recognition! The maker dissolves NOW!

This is medium's. Final also has seven—final's final, final's medium, final's supreme, final's peak, final's excellent, final's best, final's complete

[1-310]
. 

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Entering time is two: rigpa entering into light, and light entering into rigpa

[1-310]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Liberation is three: rigpa liberated from conditions and elements; rigpa without stains, liberated from afflictions; rigpa itself not falling anywhere, liberated from outer and inner phenomena

[1-310]
. I studied gradual paths for years. Then forgot: recognition was always immediate. The library blazed open.

Emaho!

[1-310]
. The meaning arrives complete. No gradual translation. Immediate.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Completion is rigpa itself all phenomena's appearance simultaneously liberated [1].

Method is two: previous essential instruction's essential point and this time's sharp-dull difference

[1-310]
: "If benefiting others, that compassion mind-grasping, three doors door-opened, breath blocked, inhaled, thrown; three syllables entering, body-speech-mind strengthened, breath with skilled do. Thus repeatedly done, that person's appearance like this: if body's strength obtained, instructions strike; awareness clear, intention equally placed; faculties' doors self-near, eye's thusness look; equally abiding mind arisen, non-conceptual samadhi obtained."

This instruction

[1-310]
You who seek liberation, listen! From Union of Sun and Moon: "Twenty-one faculties' individual stability obtained also exists. Those not understanding their own knowledge and without lama's teaching become bewildered at that appearance—surprise, fear, confusion, terror, losing perception, and so forth—taking samsara's near appropriation again. Thus twenty-one faculties' individual delusion also exists"

[1-310]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Thus three faculties: Supreme liberate in three instants. Medium may obtain stability in five days

[1-310]
. Twenty-one instants obtain stability. Finals are born in natural nirmanakaya realm, breathing out without bardo, becoming Buddha

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[1-310]
. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Logical necessity: if the path leads to ground, and ground is primordial, then path was always ground. Non-dual.

ROAR! Treasury complete! Never closed! Cut through seeking! NOW!

Here three: twenty-one faculties' delusion manner, liberation manner, and reversing delusion about difference manner

[1-310]
. 

Why wait even a moment! The distinction burns in recognition! The maker dissolves NOW!

First: Those who haven't seen this teaching's gate, though seen, influenced by cowardice, laziness, and distraction—final of finals not obtaining power over dharmata bardo's self-display, greatly bewildered, not finding certainty, greatly appearing, wondering what lineage they come from, not recognizing face so frightened, not practicing even an instant directly, wondering if this is delusion or faculties' delusion, perception mistaken, and so on—taking samsara's near appropriation again, wandering through bardo, twenty-one faculties' delusion exists

[1-310]
is vital provision-striking, great perfection's essential vital point. Thus faculties gathered, again death reversed by vital, now not dead effort vital!

Emaho!

[1-310]
My devoted ones, understand! First: Sharp, medium, dull faculties each have final, medium, supreme, peak, excellent, best, and complete—seven each, making twenty-one Recognition is immediate.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The journey translates into what was never foreign. Ground itself.

Look. Recognize. Rest.

Emaho!
