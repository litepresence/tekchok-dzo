Emaho! The nature is not remote—it is this very awareness.

Beyond concept, awareness simply is—this is the showing.

Understanding misses it; recognition sees what concepts cannot hold.

Non-duality dissolving into non-duality is like a river dissolving into a river [14278]. Freedom from extremes dissolving into freedom from extremes is like space dissolving into space [14278]. Pure wisdom gate dissolving into essence original purity is like a lion taking a snow mountain [14278].

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; method and recognition are one in recognition. Impure samsara gate dissolving into pure wisdom gate is like drawing in a silken cord [14278].

The sorter gets sorted—seeing this is the teaching. The fifth, extensive explanation of essential instructions that liberate into those, has two: hitting the crucial point with dharmata meaning essential instruction.
focusing with three times essential instruction

. Words point to what exceeds words.

What seems opposed to wisdom IS wisdom, unrecognized wisdom manifesting as confusion, naturally freeing itself.

Longchenpa shows what must be seen directly pointed to; the pointer and the pointed-to are one in recognition.

Second: In that nature, without fabrication, naturally in meditation, cut through completely, without distraction, without grasping—this is meditation

, bardo's clear light like that carrier, those two bridge-joined; space-awareness carrier similar appearance shown: "Son of family, this present clear light is self-arisen wisdom itself—without modifying mind, rest in this nature; upward zangthal you become Buddha. Recognition is immediate.

Grasping at meaning liberates itself when seen.

The deluded mind is wisdom not recognizing itself wisdom's concealment and revelation, naturally freeing itself."

Also

. What is revealed was never covered, only overlooked.

Not found through analysis; awareness meets itself here.

In the between-space (bar snang), mind meets mind.

Third: At that time, free of meditation object and subject, rigpa pure from ground shines and liberates, without abandoning good-bad thought collections, self-liberated—confidence and repetition

. Liberation through recognition is never gradual, never gradual.

Recognition dissolves the intricate—before analysis, already complete.

The path seems long only to the one who has not recognized.

Emaho!

My devoted students, listen! In natural ground, though various appear, they do not exist as appearance. Gather into one all-knowing pure luminosity, self-clear self-arising wisdom.
meditate with repetition

. The treasure was always in the open, only overlooked.

The mind that would grasp the teaching is what must be seen through.

Making distinctions undoes the maker—seeing this is the teaching.

That grasping also liberates—nothing else to do. This is the essential instruction of light-appearance liberating into dharmata

. The very barrier is the gateway—gegs lam du khyer.

Concepts point but cannot capture—mind's nature shines directly.

The knot knows how to untie—before analysis, already complete.

Looking outward, clear inward rigpa, instantaneously naked essence—this is the second crucial great essential instruction

. The words gesture toward direct knowing.

Seeing simplifies the complex—before analysis, already complete.

Standing still is the movement.

Compassion's crucial point: Though various external objects to be tamed arise as conditions.
many rigpas to tame appear radiating, do not cut the outward radiating traces, do not examine your own face, do not negate inwardly—whatever arises, leave it in its own place, directly settled, boundless naked clear rigpa, grasping that, seeing liberation place truly

. Transforming obstacles: what hinders becomes help when recognized.

Recognition dawns in the gaps—the intervals between.

Understanding undoes the understander—self-liberation of grasping.

That very clear free rigpa, without gaps, directly settled, exhausted, pure "ka"—this and bardo awareness arising unceasing are grasped, then ka-pure compassion rigpa is known and liberated

: "Look without changing this appearance; present clear light dharmata mother's clear light, all appearances buddha-fields dawning, mixed will become; that time recognize self-appearance; that time ka-dag ground you become Buddha. Recognition is immediate.

No lid to lift—lacking nothing.

Already accessible—finished before starting."

There not recognizing

. This is the third crucial great essential instruction [14305].

Longchenpa indicates what words cannot reach pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The classifier is classified—seeing this is the teaching.

These three are secret heart essence amrita, extremely pure, extremely secret [14306]. Words few but meaning great, sutra-tantra few but crucial great, depth essential but importance great. To heart-sons supreme, not others, seal of essential instruction

. Language points past language.

Destination is departure point.

Complexity untangles itself when seen—before analysis, already complete.

Emaho!

. What blocks becomes the way when seen clearly.

The difficulty is thinking there's something difficult to do.

Walking the unwalkable.

"Furthermore, dharmata nature explained: Here not one certain, whatever labeled thus appears. From various name bases, words and phrases' elaboration appears. From uncertain various names, meaning also empty of mere labeling. Since emptiness not established anywhere, nature pure thus appears"

, clear light lhundrub dissolving time, kaya and wisdom's appearance dawns; then four wisdoms' meeting appearance dawns; then lhundrub's eight doors dawning—you recognize self-appearance; self-recognized immediately ka-dag ground you well-go, three times spoken; oneself also that appearance equally placed, again there clear pointing. The nature is self-perfecting.

The separator melts—seeing this is the teaching.

The obstacle is the grasping; seeing it, it frees itself.

That certainly liberates

. The treasury was never concealed, only overlooked.

Delusion (ma rig pa) is wisdom's (ye shes) play wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

No opening required—entire from the origin.

"Furthermore, dharmata compassion explained: Objects to be tamed various, taming forms also that many. From lineage and faculty displays, samsara-nirvana realization different. That itself placed as individual object is uncorrected meaning's intention"

. The obstacle is the path in disguise—seen through, it guides.

The final barrier is the one building barriers—seen through, it falls.

The divider is divided—seeing this is the teaching.

The second, focusing with three times essential instruction, has two: three times' places and method essential instructions

. Sun-Moon Union: "If space-awareness unclear, dharmata bliss bardo, rigpa's appearance grasping, before shown lights mind-do; that obtains true appearance. If those unclear, own guru present, above instruction clearly point; no guru, vajra sibling, awareness's clear pointing do."

Thus instructions pointing

You who wish to be free, understand! The three crucial points with citations: Nothing needs to be added to the nature.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The way is where you stand.

From Talgyur: "Furthermore, dharmata essence: established as essence from nature. Since appearance mode is not one certain, entering paths are also different. With face, knowledge.
liberation seeing, entering, seeing.
habituation. From face recognition, own face. Confident heart is the place. Decided, confidence enters. Thus three's certain activity: essence complete, cause ceases"

. Never hidden, the treasury shows itself, only overlooked.

The ground holds all paths.

Self-liberation: the grasping at understanding frees itself.

Place crucial points three: entering knowing crucial point, liberation own face crucial point, completion face knowing crucial point

. Immediate (cig car ba)—not progressive, never gradual.

Immediate liberation (cig car ba)—not difficult, just unrecognized.

The treasure was never hidden—not made, so not unmade.

Emaho!

. Here is the nature—not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The one who divides is divided—seeing this is the teaching.

The judge is judged—seeing this is the teaching.

Aggregates' self-grasping ceasing, body liberates as clear light, dharmata abides in own face. Elements coarse and subtle particles liberated, appearance abides as clear light great bliss. Afflictions coarse and subtle liberated, rigpa abides as mother and child dissolved

. Each phrase indicates the beyond.

Confusion is wisdom wearing a mask—recognition removes it wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The maze reveals itself as path—before analysis, already complete.

Outer delusion purified, rigpa knows meeting dharmata mother.
various conditioned appearances as objects liberate from coarse and subtle things, mother and child nondual liberation [14360].

How liberated? Earth element's characteristics self-purified, body's flesh bindings liberated. Water purified, blood; fire purified, warmth; wind purified, breath bindings liberated

, prolonged death or dharma-view disharmonious others, death-point with three jewel instructions benefit others shown: breath outer stopped, inner not stopped time, oneself momentary dharmata direct intention placed; then other person's breath separated, gap that mouth-nose three and own mouth-nose three joined. The nature lacks nothing.

Obstacles exist only for the one who thinks they need to overcome them.

Between one thought and another—awareness meeting itself.

Emaho!

. No thought horse, flesh and blood self-continuum grasping liberated. Inner rigpa without affliction stains, five wisdoms self-display. Objects' stains without, phenomena and dharmata nondual

. Transforming difficulties into practice—obstacles serve the path.

The text points beyond itself pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

No key needed for an unlocked door—whole without beginning.

Emaho!

. The liberating recognition is instant (cig car ba), never gradual.

No journey needed—already there.

The filter is filtered—seeing this is the teaching.

Third, completion face knowing crucial point: Rigpa reaching spontaneous accomplishment precious jewel's own place, abiding in nondual original purity and spontaneous accomplishment, knowing that

Listen, my fortunate ones! The first: When rigpa enters outward clear light appearance, know radiance as self-display [14352]. When light enters inward into rigpa, know not moving from that ground of original purity [14353].

Second: At the time of four wisdoms preparation, outer, inner.
secret three liberations abiding in own face, knowing own face essential instruction—grasping that

. No delay: recognition liberates immediately, never gradual.

The mind that would understand is what must be recognized.

Walking on what you seek.

All samsara's phenomena purified at that time, so previous delusion not experienced is decided. Now impossible to delude, obtaining body of no-return, rigpa itself no-return place

: outward first dum-bu white om contemplated, thrown; second red ah with thrown; last whatever not contemplated, thrown. Returning three all hum contemplated, that awareness blue hum own rigpa drawn.

Speech also hum

. The described nature is immediate—it is this very awareness.

The trail is the terrain.

The box contains itself—full as emptiness.

Samsara's deluded appearance, nirvana's pure appearance, when both dissolve into that dharmadhatu, existence and non-existence, permanence and nihilism not established anywhere, so samsara-nirvana equal, gone to ground liberation—at that time of spontaneous accomplishment dissolving, know thus [14384].

This is rigpa own face's great crucial point [14385].

Second, method essential instruction has two: previous essential instruction and this time's sharp-dull difference

. What is revealed was never covered, only overlooked.

The nature of mind reveals itself directly, not through understanding.

The elaborate is simple when recognized—before analysis, already complete.

Emaho!

reciting, drawn to gap under foot, strongly drawn. That time own body-speech-mind three strengthened, drawn inside gap, his wind warm completely inside comes out—certain.

That time other person's eyes hri-gi comes

My heart-sons and daughters, understand! Thus abiding in own face, knowing thus, afflictions cannot arise in rigpa. Liberated from samsara's karmic ripening. Since afflictions cannot abide in rigpa's own face, secret rigpa dharmata—existence, non-existence, permanence, nihilism, thing and emptiness aspects do not fall anywhere. Outer objects and subjects, inner various thoughts holding as different, secret rigpa itself grasping also none—knowing own face

. The treasure was always in the open, only overlooked.

Between thoughts, awareness rests in its own nature.

The obstacle exists only for the one who believes in obstacles.

Third topic: Summarizing meaning through self-display faculties' liberation way has three: faculties' division generally shown, liberation-delusion sequence specifically explained.
faculties' individual liberation way extensively spoken

. The treasury was never concealed, only overlooked.

The chest was always empty and full—never incomplete.

Not something to understand—awareness recognizing itself.

Emaho!

. Never hidden, the treasury shows itself, only overlooked.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Longchenpa shows what must be seen directly pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Wisdom appearance manner one, delusion basis of aspects one, realization measure one, knowing analysis one, self-display liberation manner one—each arise separately, so faculties also explained as twenty-one

. Recognition frees immediately—not in stages, never gradual.

The road is the earth.

Ma rig pa is ye shes in disguise—recognition reveals wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

From Self-Arising: "Hey faithful retinue, listen! I have taught beings' ignorance. Since appearance arising modes are twenty-one, understand these well"

; then body also har rising able comes. Thus arisen, eye's thusness dharmata direct appearance shown; eyes arisen, thigle empty space lamp thumb-index showing, like placed, clear light self-existing this is; from body exiting time, dharmata bardo self-equipped dawning, self-appearance this is, not other—recognize self.

Three times struck

. The nature is not distant—it is this very awareness.

Concepts fall away; what remains is mind's nature displaying itself.

Difficulty arises only for the one who thinks something must be achieved.

Faculties shown with three types: supreme, medium, supreme has seven—supreme's final, supreme's medium, supreme's supreme, supreme's peak, supreme's excellent, supreme's best, supreme's complete

. The moment of recognition is the moment of freedom, never gradual.

Complexity is simplicity wearing a mask—before analysis, already complete.

This is not a concept to grasp but awareness showing its own face.

This is supreme's division. That also, seeing-return one, wisdom appearance birth manner one, realization measure one, understanding time one, knowing analysis one—arising and abiding stability in respective appearance obtained

, appearance seen or instruction heard, saying, voice emerging good; sign arisen also succeeded. Dharmata bardo non-conceptual samadhi obtained, becoming Buddha certain.

Sun-Moon Union

. What is revealed was never covered, only overlooked.

Difficulty is the mind's creation—liberation is immediate (cig car ba).

What appears as ignorance is awareness forgetting itself wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Medium also has seven—medium's final, medium's medium, medium's supreme, medium's peak, medium's excellent, medium's best, medium's complete. That also wisdom birth measure one arises

Listen well, you who practice the Dharma! Previous essential instruction: Having grown familiar with three crucial points, recognizing face—like recognizing a familiar object, at that time without doubt, liberated Recognition is immediate.

The analyzer is analyzed—seeing this is the teaching.

Recognition arises in the space between—this very gap.

. Words point to what exceeds words.

The pattern clears when viewed—before analysis, already complete.

The one seeking liberation is already liberated—just see clearly.

This time's essential instruction: Sharp rigpa rising from ground like a shooting star in space, instantly knowing own face and liberating

. Dull rigpa, not recognizing appearance's distinctions, through power of previous profound practice, like a lion cub separating from womb, coarse purified, instant five, twenty-one faculties' whichever way liberated This is the treasury's heart.

Recognition in the interval—between this thought and the next.

The vault has no door—complete from the first.

. The hindrance liberates itself when made the path—gegs lam du khyer.

What seems difficult is only difficult for the one who seeks.

Recognition, not comprehension—awareness seeing itself.

These also from Union of Sun and Moon: "This time has three: entering time, liberation time, completion time"

. Obstacle and path are one—recognition transforms.

Separation separates itself—seeing this is the teaching.

Longchenpa indicates what words cannot reach pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

This is medium's. Final also has seven—final's final, final's medium, final's supreme, final's peak, final's excellent, final's best, final's complete

. The words gesture toward direct knowing.

Confusion and clarity are not two—just recognition and its absence wisdom appearing as confusion wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Ma rig pa ye shes su shar—delusion dawns as wisdom wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Entering time is two: rigpa entering into light.
light entering into rigpa

. What seems to block the way IS the way, seen differently.

The one who seeks to understand dissolves in the seeing.

The gap between thoughts is where recognition dawns.

Liberation is three: rigpa liberated from conditions and elements; rigpa without stains, liberated from afflictions; rigpa itself not falling anywhere, liberated from outer and inner phenomena

. Recognition is immediate liberation, never gradual.

Beyond concept, awareness simply is—this is the showing.

What is hard is only hard for the seeker—recognition is effortless.

Emaho!

. Liberation is simultaneous with recognition, never gradual.

No simplification needed—just seeing—before analysis, already complete.

Understanding misses it; recognition sees what concepts cannot hold.

Completion is rigpa itself all phenomena's appearance simultaneously liberated [14405].

Method is two: previous essential instruction's crucial point and this time's sharp-dull difference

: "If benefiting others, that compassion mind-grasping, three doors door-opened, breath blocked, inhaled, thrown; three syllables entering, body-speech-mind strengthened, breath with skilled do. Thus repeatedly done, that person's appearance like this: if body's strength obtained, instructions strike; awareness clear, intention equally placed; faculties' doors self-near, eye's thusness look; equally abiding mind arisen, non-conceptual samadhi obtained."

This instruction

You who seek liberation, listen! From Union of Sun and Moon: "Twenty-one faculties' individual stability obtained also exists. Those not understanding their own knowledge and without lama's teaching become bewildered at that appearance—surprise, fear, confusion, terror, losing perception, and so forth—taking samsara's near appropriation again. Thus twenty-one faculties' individual delusion also exists"

. The treasure was always in the open, only overlooked.

Not found through analysis; awareness meets itself here.

The space between is not empty—it is recognition itself.

Thus three faculties: Supreme liberate in three instants. Medium may obtain stability in five days

. Twenty-one instants obtain stability. Finals are born in natural nirmanakaya realm, breathing out without bardo, becoming Buddha

What's tangled smooths itself—before analysis, already complete.

What appears difficult dissolves in recognition—immediately (cig car).

. The treasury was never concealed, only overlooked.

The path is the ground seen clearly.

The treasury was never closed—done without doing.

Here three: twenty-one faculties' delusion manner, liberation manner.
reversing delusion about difference manner

. Language points past language.

The path seems long only to the one who has not recognized.

The sorter gets sorted—seeing this is the teaching.

First: Those who haven't seen this teaching's gate, though seen, influenced by cowardice, laziness.
distraction—final of finals not obtaining power over dharmata bardo's self-display, greatly bewildered, not finding certainty, greatly appearing, wondering what lineage they come from, not recognizing face so frightened, not practicing even an instant directly, wondering if this is delusion or faculties' delusion, perception mistaken, and so on—taking samsara's near appropriation again, wandering through bardo, twenty-one faculties' delusion exists

is crucial provision-striking, great perfection's crucial vital point. Thus faculties gathered, again death reversed by crucial, now not dead effort crucial!

Emaho!

My devoted ones, understand! First: Sharp, medium, dull faculties each have final, medium, supreme, peak, excellent, best.
complete—seven each, making twenty-one Recognition is immediate.

Recognition dissolves the intricate—before analysis, already complete.

Standing still is the movement.

. Each phrase indicates the beyond.

Destination is departure point.

In the pause between mind-moments, awareness recognizes itself.

Emaho!

—heat upward dissolving, best ka-dag, middle bardo, last nirmanakaya breath-giving certain; ordinary beings born in higher realms, breath-giving. Also: dying time eyes making film, sign-heat gathering, animal birth.

Right hand waving

, heat gathering at crown—god. Words confused, heat gathering right armpit—asura.

Concepts point but cannot capture—mind's nature shines directly. Left foot earth-pounding, heat gathering foot sole—hell.

The mind that would understand is what must be recognized. Body yellow, lusterless, heat gathering throat—preta. Words clear, memory not lost, heat gathering eyes—human birth.

Sun-Moon Union

: "Outer appearance like this: if heat upward dissolving, great breath-giving becomes; eyes unclear making film, lower realm places born; right hand waving, that person god-place; mouth words confused, asura likewise born; left foot earth-pounding, hell-place; body color yellow lusterless, preta-realm; mouth sentient-being voice speaking, animal-place; tongue stammering mouth meeting, likewise animal birth-place; words clear memory not lost, human-place. Recognition is immediate.

The knot knows how to untie—before analysis, already complete.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition."

Outer signs these

, inner signs these joined: crown heat gathering, god-place; likewise foot sole heat gathering, hell-place; right armpit heat gathering, asura-realm; likewise throat heat gathering, preta-realm; likewise sign heat gathering, animal birth-place; eyes heat gathering, human birth. In the nature, completion is already.

In the interval (bar snang), awareness sees itself directly.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.
