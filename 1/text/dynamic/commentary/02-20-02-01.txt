First also general placement method and particular extraction method two: This is the treasury's heart.

From Self-Arising: "Dharmata self-appearance sky, rigpa wisdom unmoved, non-grasping manner placed becomes, wisdom pure self-appearance seen, ignorance deluded appearance dharmas reverse."

"Unsetting victory banner, unchanging lamp clear, thought-free wisdom, clear-dark five lights clear."

"Jewel nectar, doing and meditating not obtained. Lamp expanse appearance, unmoved clear non-grasping examine. Thus from meaning unmoved, jewel nectar lamp. Without abandoning-placing obtaining supreme, without grasping self-place liberated."

[8853-8869]
Second: from Tal 'Gyur: "Body key by dawning, wisdom abiding posture by, thigle gathering swirling accomplishes, light extending gathering. Related binding wind key, entering action extreme distinguishes. That changing action wind exhausted, delusion's arrangement fitted. Rigpa key releasing and, gathering sky placing. Expanse key gathering and, drawing element's wide spread fitting. Appearance key increase and exhaust, various self-place liberated."

Emaho! Keys for binding the elements!

The body carries the crucial point through resonance. When the wisdom settles in the posture of complete perfection, without change, the bindu accumulates and swirls. Light expands and gathers. The wind's crucial point binds through related binding—when the wind enters, its transformation exhausts delusion's harmony. The awareness crucial point releases to space, drawing upward. The expanse crucial point gathers and draws, spreading through the elements. The appearance crucial point increases and exhausts—various forms self-liberate.

Thus the system works: if the bindu does not increase, draw inward to the center of the eyes, binding the light-nerve. If the light-pra expands, direct to the area between the eyebrows. If thoughts disperse, bind the wind and draw. Awareness's crucial point releases the chain to space. Expanse's crucial point gathers to the center, and from the corner of the eyes, guide and view.

Here lies the method of thod rgal, the path of lamps and light. You gaze upon the bindus of light that arise from the vajra-strings of your own awareness—like a bird swiftly taking wing, they appear in an instant. Do you see? This very self-display is your own rigpa's play.

[8885-8890]
If you strike these displays with recognition, they dissolve like deer swift to flee. Rest undistracted upon their meaning, and they circle like bees to nectar. When you truly look at your own display, it stands like a mirage—flickering, yet without substance.

[8891-8898]
Do not be distracted by their outer form, and they become but tremors and flickers. Deeper still, undistracted from their meaning, they become like coals half-concealed—neither fully seen nor extinguished. Thus, if you gaze intensely, you perceive neither coming nor going, only light displaying itself.

[8899-8906]
When you stabilize upon this meaning, you see the lamp of empty bindus. Looking directly at these, you perceive bindus with bodies. Undistracted from their meaning, deluded displays resolve into sambhogakaya forms. All these bodily displays are but illusion, rainbow, and magical display.

[8907-8924]
Resting intensely upon them, day and night become one—like the eyes of a fox, seeing equally in darkness and light. Thus is your own mandala-display. Yet know this: these empty-form rainbow lights and bindus do not exist in the external space, though fools believe they do. They arise from within your body's pure light-channels, seen inwardly through the eye's pure light-channel. The heart's radiance spreads everywhere—now is the time when the base-display dawns. Knowing your own face, rest naturally in your own radiance, and through this you will see what lhun grub luminosity truly is.

Emaho!

During my wandering years... will explain further. When wind and mind become pure, through spontaneous presence's appearance, you see whatever is within the body. The potency-ground dissolves, entering inward. Reaching the measure, going to exhaustion, at the setting the ground-appearance dissolves into the ground, liberated in primordial purity. All those appearances appear as increase, yet increase has no self-nature. Inward self-reversal—there is no waning.

[8925-8959]
Listen here, dear yogin! Within self-reverse from obscuration without—here tantra and instruction say outer sky exists. Intentional condition: outer sky to eye place see portion exists. Nature outer exists, other-by also see possible, yet outer without know! Other-by self empty-form not-see, that body-by obscure. Self-by see light-root pure gap-from within arise, like sun arise appear see from hole-within!

Proof: eye close-from empty-form see—this-by within-in exist indeed! Therefore body etc. appear outer field-in without also exist like appear. Mirror-to look time face arise like: within light-root clear mirror-in, heart awareness face-like resonance appear that. Field-in without also within see, reference pure light-root quality portion-from arise. Outer inner two portion mix appear only—delusion many all true!

Manner thus understand: person wisdom-possess great-perfection expanse-from arise called, various self-free yogin I like! Manner this confident scripture join: Lion Power-Perfect great tantra-from—body appear that all, field appear not indeed! Example young girl-by mirror characteristic clear-to, self face appear see like!

Dharma-nature field sky-to, awareness appear body-to arise! Self location-condition see indeed, field-in exist not indeed! Reference pure manifest clear, self center-and mandala with, wisdom meaning-to field without, sentient-being time-at field like appear! See field-to realize great, understand field-in bliss great, appear see experience great! Self-awareness one-only companion supreme, appear field-in without by!

Emaho! Self-awareness without outer field!

[8960-8969]
Listen, practitioner! Vajra nadi-thread itself-from portion body indeed think-not pervade—thus! This understand-reason one exist, intelligence-possess all-by know must. Nature realize easy by body-appear say, contradiction without explain must. Outer sky-to space-awareness-and lamp-appear say, confuse-possess all-to realize easy for! Self within understand-reason former like indeed!

The practitioner must understand: all those body appearances are not appearances of external objects. They are like a maiden seeing her own face in a clear mirror. The mirror is the clear light channel of awareness. The face is the self-appearing wisdom. In the sky of dharmata's nature, awareness's appearance arises as body. Though wisdom is objectless, it appears as objects for sentient beings. Great realization in seen objects, great bliss in understood objects, great experience in seen appearance. Self-awareness alone is the supreme companion.

This is the manner of determining particular distinctions through the crucial point of awareness's unchangeability. The tantras and oral instructions speak of these appearing in outer space for those with deluded understanding—those who see expanse-awareness and lamps appearing in outer sky. This is explained for ease of understanding. The inner meaning is as before: these arise within the clear light channels of the body, not externally.

What is the practical instruction? When you practice, view the resonance of complete perfection without change. At the time of wisdom citadels, the settling posture is without change. The crucial points: if bindu does not increase, draw to the center of the eyes. If light spreads, direct to between the eyebrows. If thoughts disperse, bind the wind and draw. Release awareness to space. Gather expanse to the center, guide from the corner of the eyes. These are the keys.

The progression unfolds like this: first, awareness's self-appearance abides as wisdom's chain. Like birds born flying swiftly, in an instant it pervades all. If you strike that string, it becomes merely swift as a deer. Resting without distraction, it circles to the essence like a bee. Viewing self-appearance, it abides like a mirage. Without distraction, it becomes like flickering or flashing. Then like quivering and fire. When viewed intensely, non-coming, non-going, light-appearance is seen. When steadied upon its meaning, the empty bindu lamp is seen. When truly viewed, the bindu body is seen, endowed with form. Without distraction, deluded appearance is seen as enjoyment body. All those body appearances are like illusions, rainbows. When steadied intently, day and night become without distinction—like the eyes of a wolf, seeing without day or night. Thus is the self-appearance mandala.

This is called being born from the expanse of Great Perfection, a person of wisdom, a yogin of various self-liberation, like myself. The manner, when conjoined with confident scripture, reveals that these body appearances do not exist in external objects. They arise from within—like the reflection in a mirror, not the thing itself.

Now I will speak further on these crucial points. The five sections are these: first, the general placement method and particular extraction method. Second, the body's crucial point through resonance, the wisdom settling in posture. Third, the wind's crucial point binding and transformation. Fourth, awareness's crucial point releasing and drawing upward. Fifth, expanse's crucial point gathering and pervasion. Sixth, appearance's crucial point increase and exhaustion. All these are self-liberating when reA simple practitioner...ld wanderer practiced these for many years in mountain caves. I would sit in the seven-point posture of Vairocana, gaze at the space between my eyebrows, and wait. At first, nothing. Then swirling lights. Then colors and forms beyond description. The texts call these bindus, thigles, the lights of wisdom. They arise from the central channel, from the heart's awareness, from the very nature of mind. They are not external. They never were. When I understood this, the practice transformed.

The crucial point for the body: settle in the posture of complete perfection without change. The four elements must be balanced. The resonance must flow. The bindus must accumulate and swirl. When this happens, light expands and gathers within. The practitioner sees the rainbow body, the empty form, the wisdom light. This is not imagination. This is the actual display of awareness, arising from within.

The crucial point for the wind: bind through related binding. When the wind enters the central channel, its transformation exhausts delusion. The breath becomes the mantra. The wind becomes the wisdom. The practitioner learns to control the breath, to direct the wind, to stabilize the mind. This is not forced. This is allowing the natural breath to settle, to become still, to reveal the still awareness beneath.

The crucial point for awareness: release the chain to space. Let thoughts arise and dissolve without grasping. Do not follow them. Do not reject them. Let them be as clouds in the sky. The sky is vast, thoughts are passing appearances. Awareness is the sky itself, never disturbed by its contents. Release, and rest in that release.

The crucial point for expanse: gather to the center. The elements pervade everywhere. The awareness pervades everything. When you gather to the center, you gather to the heart. When you guide from the corner of the eyes, you direct the light inward. The expanse is not outside. The expanse is your own nature, waiting to be recognized.

The crucial point for appearance: increase and exhaust. The appearances arise more and more. The lights grow brighter. The forms become more detailed. Then they exhaust, dissolve, reveal the nature. This is not two things. This is one process: appearances arise to be recognized, and recognition is their exhaustion. The appearance and the awareness seeing it are one.

Thus, dear practitioner, these are the crucial points. Do not seek them elsewhere. They are within your own body, your own breath, your own mind. The treasury reveals what was always present. The instruction You dreamt you were searching. The search was dream, the dreamer was not. what was always here. Rest in that recognition, and the path completes itself.
