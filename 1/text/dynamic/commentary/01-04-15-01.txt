First: Arisen, various, causeless—arisen appearance, signless, appeared. That also, from the arisen-place, empty, appeared, liberated, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, nameless.

The Treasury weaves distinctions to reveal what transcends all weaving. Seeing this the Great Perfection.

The word points. The pointing liberates. Who translates?

That also, is-not, extremes, definitive, reasoning-by, great-perfection, extremes, beyond, view, established.

The Expanse Section establishes the view of causeless spontaneous arising. From the very place of arising, emptiness. From the place of appearance, liberation.

[5-13]
The variegated space—shar snang, appearing yet without cause. Causeless arising, yet appearing distinctly. From where things arise, they are empty. Where they appear, they are liberated. Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa without names.

The reasoning: not falling to extremes of is or is-not. Great Perfection's view beyond extremes is established through definitive reasoning. Beyond existence, beyond non-existence—yet not nihilistic negation.

[14-23]
This wanderer. 

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Causeless arising—things appear, but no maker, no creator. Like reflections in a mirror. The mirror doesn't create them. They don't come from somewhere else. They don't go somewhere else. 

From where things appear—they are already liberated. Like a bird's flight leaving no trace.

[24-28]
See what is. Rest in recognition. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Between the distinction and the distinguisher, vast space opens. No separation.

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle vast oceanic completion. Never closed. Never opened. Simply what is.

Arisen primordial-wisdom is. Knowing, other-on, not relying. Liberated mind is. Cause-conditions, applied.

Arisen-liberated, non-dual, abiding. Result, primordially, liberated. Through similar-appearances, self-pure, definitive, reasoning-by, Great Perfection, appearance-from, liberated.

[26-45]
Liberate! The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Resting in the view, the path is the resting itself. Ground without departure. Spacious presence.

Third: Free from extremes of is and is-not, beyond directional fixation. Self-nature without reliance, causeless, primordially pure.

Beyond fabrication and correction, through primordial liberation the great expanse beyond extremes is set forth. The great primordial wisdom of self-purified abiding, liberated from the beginning—called "exhaustion of self-basis."

Through reasoning engaging deluded mind, intended as self-liberation.

[32-45]
SUDDEN. The variegated space! 

Speaking of manifold existence: Free from negation, directionless, self-arising everywhere.

In spontaneous play, beyond affirmation and negation. Three divisions: assertion of existence (Mind School), assertion of non-existence (Self-Essential Point), assertion of both (Supreme Instruction).

All are khra-bo, the variegated—appearing in manifold colors yet without essence.

[33-45]
Second: Through self-nature of appearance-emptiness liberated from its own ground, dharmatā of mind radiantly displayed in manifold forms. Through liberation of non-appearance from its own ground, action freed from virtue and non-virtue.

Through transformation into emptiness, non-appearance established as self-purified.

Third: Through self-emptiness, primordially pure, not relying on action's cause and effect. Through fabrication, it arises; through arising as emptiness, it liberates saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in all directions.

Three essential points: inexpressibility beyond thought; beyond comparison beyond meditation; liberation from abiding and transformation.

[40-45]
The essence of self-purified abiding: nowhere divided, not established as affirmation or negation, transcends conceptual construction. Recognition is immediate.

The Treasury's path vast oceanic ground. What seemed journey was always waves on water never leaving water.

Without duality in characteristic, it does not depart from the single wheel of mind's existence. Through that very activity, unceasingly radiant—called "the liberation of appearance and mind without duality."

Through reasoning of thought-free self-nature: primordial liberation of all phenomena, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa liberated from their own ground.

[42-45]
The essence of white space: through self-liberation of appearance and conditions, without fabrication, pure cause, not to be established in any mode of abiding. This is the treasury's heart.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Divided: from the union of view and meditation, the two White Spaces.

Like snow on a mountain—pure white, unstained, reflecting all colors yet itself colorless.
 What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.
