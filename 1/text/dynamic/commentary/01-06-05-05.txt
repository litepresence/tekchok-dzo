[8677-8680]
Fifth joy—emptiness not empty. Fullness without edge. Mind and wisdom
neither opening nor closing. Like ice forming on lake—not solid, not liquid.
Neither holding nor releasing. First four joys were preparation; this is
recognition.

[8679-8682]
This mountain dweller... tried to open to wisdom, close off confusion. Like doorkeeper
at border. Then one morning, no gate. No keeper. Just valley holding
everything equally. Snow, rock, rainbow—all exactly as is.

[8681-8684]
Not transcending extremes—nothing to transcend. Middle way is ground beneath
all positions. Like bird flying through sky—no path remains.

[8683-8686]
Tantra says "from before"—before first joy, before mind and wisdom as two.
Timeless nature never other than it is. Like discovering water is wet.

[8685-8688]
See what is. Resolve completely. Rest there. They call them three words
but really it's one continuous gesture—like a bird landing, perching, then
flying again as if never stopped.

[8687-8690]
Rest here. Idea of practice as journey was the only obstacle. Like wave
realizing it is water—nothing changes, everything understood.
