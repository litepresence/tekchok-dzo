Between the nature of mind and its display, the Vajra Essence path reveals how
existence itself arises as spontaneous presence. The forms of sentient beings
emerge as inconceivable manifestations beyond ordinary conceptual mind. This is
not philosophy—it is direct description of how delusion arises from non-
recognition.

Vajrasattva represents pure awareness of rigpa, the self-arising wisdom of
Dharmata. The Land of Vast Expanses is the primordial fourfold nature, the
basis of all manifestation. The magnificent abode manifests as the gateway of
spontaneous presence. All these symbols point to aspects of your own nature.

[12520-12540]
Therefore. Thus. The symbolic narratives reveal delusion and liberation through
profound metaphors. The vast expanse represents the ground of being. The year
of the pig marks the time when non-recognition was fully established as
conceptual imputation. The emanated sun represents clear perception of coarse
object appearances arising as Nirmanakaya.

This old practitioner sees the symbolism clearly. The bird constellation
represents desire arising as attachment to objects of the five senses. The old
woman represents the emergence of non-recognition's awareness as deluded
apprehension of self. The uncertain lineage represents how ground appearances
manifest equally as liberation and delusion without distinction.

[12541-12560]
The timeless moment when sound emerged represents the beginningless Dharmata
of Samantabhadra. When self appears as other through non-recognition, the
ground of delusion manifests as apparent existence. The four rugged ones
represent the four conditions that give rise to all experience.

See what is. Rest. The five wild ones represent the five poisons that obscure
the natural state. The single back support represents the conceptualizing mind
that grasps at duality. The single thief represents anger that steals the peace
of natural awareness. The single gatherer represents how deluded appearances
manifest as singular reality through grasping.

[12561-12580]
This mind becomes the apprehender of deluded appearance, binding rigpa in
cyclic existence. From this arise the manifold afflictions as the hosts of maras
that obscure realization. Thus delusion arose from primordial purity without
ground or basis, hence called existence.

The second section reveals delusion and liberation through profound metaphors.
From spontaneous presence comes the teaching that all pure appearances should
be understood through these symbols. Resting in the symbolic meaning, we
understand.

[12581-12600]
In former times in the Land of Vast Expanses dwelt the Teacher Light Diffusion,
manifestation of self-arising wisdom. He had two sons who were imprisoned in a
cave—thus the story of delusion begins. The Teacher represents self-arising
wisdom, the Buddha nature within all beings.

The two sons represent the wisdom of primordial purity and spontaneous
presence united. Being imprisoned in the cave represents how spontaneous
appearance lacks wisdom and is bound by non-recognition. Then five soldiers
came and conquered from the stone fortress peak, representing the five poisons.

[12601-12620]
The two sons were sent into the valley and the old woman with the mushroom hat
blocked the gate of liberation. The old woman represents co-emergent
ignorance, blocking rigpa's natural expression. Then four men captured them
and separated the five men from their horses, representing the four wisdoms
purifying the five poisons.

The four wisdoms liberate afflictions, gather wisdom, distinguish between
afflictions and wisdom, and move to the expanse. The two sons escaping and
killing guards represents recognizing self-awareness and dissolving conceptual
bonds. The two sons fled to a place of sun and rain, gathered subjects, and
consulted with twenty-one queens of wisdom.

[12621-12640]
The queens consulting and fleeing to the temple represent the twenty-one
instructions manifesting inner meaning. The five men guarding with hats
represents the bindu of five lights remaining unmoving, unreachable by thought.
Then four mirrors looked at the demon and recognized their own nature as
Dharmakaya.

The four mirrors represent the four lamps' wisdom revealing self-abiding rigpa.
Then seeing a house with eight doors, they laughed and lost themselves in
spontaneous presence. The eight doors represent the eight consciousnesses
recognized as the nature.

[12641-12660]
Between bondage and liberation, the drama unfolds. These metaphorical forms
point to the meaning of primordial wisdom manifesting as Sambhogakaya. The
third section presents another teaching from the same source of spontaneous
presence.

In the Land of Great Circumference dwelt a single lamp not extinguished within
great mire of body and mind. The Land of Radiant Light was seen by the Teacher
Mirror Possessor, embodiment of awareness. Listen, Radiant Being, and I shall
prophesy for you without distraction, pointing to your true nature.

[12661-12680]
Upon the peak of Mount Malaya lies the Ocean with Rim, where Father Light
Protection and Mother Vajra Sow dwell. From their union came two children,
brother and sister, representing wisdom and means. Then the parents spoke thus
to the children, giving instructions for the path.

Son, go to the demon land and come to the mirror of self-recognition. Daughter,
go to the thirty-three gods' victorious palace and gather flowers of merit. The
son said he would not go because the demon Black Halika would imprison him in
non-recognition. The son replied that in the demon land dwells Aunt Mushroom
Hat, who is the co-emergent ignorance.

[12681-12700]
Ask her for fire of wisdom, he requested, understanding the need for recognition.
The son spoke thus to his parents, revealing his understanding. Noble parents,
that land is not mine, yet I shall go there for the benefit of beings. Send five
servants representing the five wisdoms and a sword anointed with sesame oil of
clear light.

Send five mirrors representing the five Buddha families, thus he requested. The
parents rejoiced and agreed, sending five servants and five mirrors as supports.
Then the son spoke again, asking for further guidance. Noble parents, if I am
captured in the demon land, what method shall I use?

[12701-12720]
The parents replied that in the Jewel Heap Land of the mind dwell four caste
people, the four lamps. Ask them and they will show the path. The son went to
the demon land and the co-emergent ignorance mushroom woman came to him.
She said: "You are clearly deluded. You have come to my land but you lack the
fires of wisdom."

The son replied: "I have not come here to be your subject. I have come to seek
the fire of wisdom." The mushroom woman said: "If you want fire, first give me
that sword of yours." The son understood and gave the sword, representing
cutting through grasping.

[12721-12740]
Between giving and receiving, wisdom transfers. The mushroom woman was pleased
and gave him the fire. Thus the fire of wisdom was obtained. The son then went
to the temple of Four Fierce Brothers where four wisdom lamps dwell.

This old practitioner chuckles at the profundity. The son represents the
practitioner entering samsara with wisdom supports. The mushroom woman
represents co-emergent ignorance encountered on the path. The fire of wisdom
is recognition itself. The sword is the cutting through of conceptual mind.

[12741-12760]
Therefore. Thus. The symbolic narratives are not mere stories. They are maps of
the inner journey from delusion to recognition. Each character represents an
aspect of mind. Each event represents a stage of practice. The Land of Vast
Expanses is your own nature. The Teacher is your own wisdom. The two sons are
your own purity and presence.

Mountain hermit spent twelve years decoding these symbols. He made charts,
correspondences, elaborate maps. Then one morning he burned them all. "The
symbols were fingers pointing. I was sucking the fingers." He sat in silence and
recognized what the symbols had been pointing to all along.

[12761-12780]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: do not get lost in interpretation! The
mushroom hat woman, the four men, the five soldiers—all are your own mind's
play. Stop analyzing the drama and recognize the dramatist. The one who
interprets is the one being interpreted.

[12781-12800]
Thus the Vajra Essence narratives conclude—not with understanding but with
recognition, not with decoding but with seeing, not with analysis but with
resting in what was never absent. The symbols dissolve. The nature remains.

[12801-12820]
Emaho! The wonder of symbolic narratives—delusion and liberation both
represented in story form. May all who hear these tales recognize their own
nature as the Teacher Light Diffusion. May all see the two sons as their own
wisdom. May all obtain the fire of wisdom from the mushroom woman of co-
emergent ignorance.

[12821-End]
This old vagabond leaves you with three words: story, meaning, recognition.
The story entertains. The meaning guides. Recognition liberates. Do not stop at
story. Do not cling to meaning. Pass through to recognition. The Vajra Essence
is complete.
