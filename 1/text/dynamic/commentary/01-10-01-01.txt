[12500-12519]
Between the nature (rang bzhin) of mind and its display, the Vajra Essence path reveals how existence itself arises as spontaneous presence. The forms of sentient beings emerge as inconceivable manifestations beyond ordinary conceptual mind. The path of delusion and intention arises according to how conceptual thought manifests. Vajrasattva represents pure awareness of Rigpa, the self-arising wisdom of Dharmata.

[12520-12540]
Therefore. Thus. The symbolic narratives reveal delusion and liberation through profound metaphors. The vast expanse represents the ground (gzhi) of being. The primordial fourfold nature abides as the basis of all manifestation. The magnificent abode manifests as the gateway of spontaneous presence. The ground appearance arises effortlessly as the natural display of clear light.

[12541-12560]
The timeless moment when sound emerged represents the beginningless Dharmata of Samantabhadra. When self appears as other through non-recognition, the ground (gzhi) of delusion manifests as apparent existence. The year of the pig marks the time when non-recognition was fully established as conceptual imputation. The emanated sun represents the clear perception of coarse object appearances arising as Nirmanakaya.

[12561-12580]
This old practitioner sees the symbolism clearly. The bird constellation represents desire that arose as attachment to objects of the five senses. The old woman represents the emergence of non-recognition's awareness as deluded apprehension of self. The uncertain lineage represents how ground appearances manifest equally as liberation and delusion without distinction. The four rugged ones represent the four conditions that give rise to all experience.

[12581-12600]
Three words. See what is. Rest. The five wild ones represent the five poisons that obscure the natural state. The single back support represents the conceptualizing mind that grasps at duality. The single thief represents anger that steals the peace of natural awareness. The single gatherer represents how deluded appearances manifest as singular reality through grasping. This mind becomes the apprehender of deluded appearance, binding Rigpa in cyclic existence.

[12601-12620]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! From this arise the manifold afflictions as the hosts of maras that obscure realization. Thus delusion arose from primordial purity without ground or basis, hence called existence. The second section reveals delusion and liberation through the profound metaphors of the Vajra Essence. From spontaneous presence comes the teaching that all pure appearances should be understood through these symbols.

[12621-12640]
Resting in the symbolic meaning, we understand. In former times in the Land of Vast Expanses dwelt the Teacher Light Diffusion, manifestation of self-arising wisdom. He had two sons who were imprisoned in a cave—thus the story of delusion begins. Then five soldiers came and conquered from the stone fortress peak, representing the five poisons. The two sons were sent into the valley and the old woman with the mushroom hat blocked the gate of liberation.

[12641-12660]
Between bondage and liberation, the drama unfolds. Then four men captured them and separated the five men from their horses, representing the four wisdoms. The two sons escaped by themselves and killed the prison guards, representing self-liberation. The two sons fled to a place of sun and rain, gathered subjects, and consulted with twenty-one queens of wisdom. They fled to the temple of Fierce Thought where five men wearing five hats guarded the gate.

[12661-12680]
Therefore. Thus. No one could enter without recognition, thus the story continues. Then four mirrors looked at the demon and recognized their own nature as Dharmakaya. Then seeing a house with eight doors, they laughed and lost themselves in spontaneous presence. These metaphorical forms point to the meaning of primordial wisdom manifesting as Sambhogakaya. The Teacher Light Diffusion represents self-arising wisdom, the Buddha nature within all beings.

[12681-12700]
This old practitioner chuckles at the symbolism. The two sons represent the wisdom of primordial purity and spontaneous presence united. Being imprisoned in the cave represents how spontaneous appearance lacks wisdom and is bound by non-recognition. The five men conquering from the stone fortress represent how the five poisons disturb Rigpa's self-abiding nature. The two sons blocked by the old woman represents Rigpa entering the valley of existence, blocked by non-recognition.

[12701-12720]
Being captured by four men and separating five from horses represents how the four wisdoms purify the five afflictions. The four wisdoms liberate afflictions, gather wisdom, distinguish between afflictions and wisdom, and move to the expanse. The two sons escaping and killing guards represents recognizing self-awareness and dissolving conceptual bonds. The two sons fleeing to sun and rain and gathering subjects represents Rigpa entering the eyes and beholding the expanse.

[12721-12740]
Three words. See what is. Rest. The queens consulting and fleeing to the temple represent the twenty-one instructions manifesting inner meaning. The five men guarding with hats represents the bindu of five lights remaining unmoving, unreachable by thought. The four mirrors looking at the demon represent the four lamps' wisdom revealing self-abiding Rigpa. Seeing the house with eight doors represents recognizing spontaneous presence and establishing the ground (gzhi).

[12741-12760]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! The third section presents another teaching from the same source of spontaneous presence. In the Land of Great Circumference dwelt a single lamp not extinguished within great mire of body and mind. The Land of Radiant Light was seen by the Teacher Mirror Possessor, embodiment of awareness. Listen, Radiant Being, and I shall prophesy for you without distraction, pointing to your true nature.

[12761-12780]
Between the symbolic and the real, wisdom's meaning unfolds. Upon the peak of Mount Malaya lies the Ocean with Rim, where Father Light Protection and Mother Vajra Sow dwell. From their union came two children, brother and sister, representing wisdom and means. Then the parents spoke thus to the children, giving instructions for the path. Son, go to the demon land and come to the mirror of self-recognition.

[12781-12800]
Therefore. Thus. Daughter, go to the thirty-three gods' victorious palace and gather flowers of merit. The son said he would not go because the demon Black Halika would imprison him in non-recognition. Again the parents questioned why he would not go, seeking to understand his hesitation. The son replied that in the demon land dwells Aunt Mushroom Hat, who is the co-emergent ignorance.

[12801-12820]
Resting in the spacious meaning of the symbols, we understand. Ask her for fire of wisdom, he requested, understanding the need for recognition. The son spoke thus to his parents, revealing his understanding. Noble parents, that land is not mine, yet I shall go there for the benefit of beings. Send five servants representing the five wisdoms and a sword anointed with sesame oil of clear light.

[12821-12840]
This old practitioner sees the profound teaching. Send five mirrors representing the five Buddha families, thus he requested. The parents rejoiced and agreed, sending five servants and five mirrors as supports. Then the son spoke again, asking for further guidance. Noble parents, if I am captured in the demon land, what method shall I use? The parents replied that in the Jewel Heap Land of the mind dwell four caste people, the four lamps.

[12841-12860]
Send them as troops, one to gather troops of virtue, one with iron chains of method. Two to block the gate of delusion, thus they gave the complete instructions. Thus prophesied by the parents, the son said he would do so with confidence. Saying E Ma Ho, he departed, and the demon Black Halika saw him approaching. A flesh-eating human has appeared, do not let him escape, said the attendants of affliction.

[12861-12880]
Three words. See what is. Rest. The five demons captured him, and Aunt Mushroom Hat put him in iron chains of grasping. She told the attendants that he killed her son, so do not release him from bondage. The attendants agreed, and thus he had no power to escape without wisdom. Then the boy spoke thus, using skillful means. Noble aunt, my parents said that Aunt Mushroom Hat dwells in the demon land of non-recognition.

[12881-12900]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! They told me to come to the mirror, so release me without capture for I am your relative. The old woman replied that she would not release him because he killed her son of delusion. Then the boy spoke again, threatening to use force. If you do not release me, I shall summon troops of wisdom to conquer. You yourself summon troops, she replied arrogantly, and thus he could not escape alone.

[12901-12920]
Between capture and liberation, skillful means unfold. Then the boy sent messages to three friends representing the three baskets of teachings. Friends, in the Jewel Heap Land of mind dwell four people of the caste, the four lamps. Go there, for the boy Rig Knowledge has been captured, bring many troops of wisdom. They agreed and went swiftly to assist their friend.

[12921-12940]
Therefore. Thus. Then within three days at sunrise, many troops came and blocked the gate of delusion. The prisoner's irons were broken, the old woman of non-recognition was expelled. The five were separated from their horses, and Aunt's son was captured. The attendants were beheaded with swords of wisdom and killed, liberating all. Then he fled to his own land and met his sister coming with many flowers of virtue.

[12941-12960]
Resting in the meaning, we see the symbolism. The parents recognized them and rejoiced greatly, naming the brother Vajra Chain Puller. The sister was named Rim Holder, representing the bindu of clear light. Then the siblings consulted and saw the Teacher Mirror Possessor, Buddha Samantabhadra. Listen, noble child, in the Uncontrived Appearance Land dwells a crystal stupa of Dharmakaya.

[12961-12980]
This old practitioner laughs with recognition. Upon its wheel are four silver mirrors of the four lamps, so go from Malaya's peak. Put it in the rim enclosure, climb the jewel stairs carrying a jewel vessel of wisdom. At the stupa's peak dwells a teacher Unchanging Light, the Dharmakaya Buddha. From his right foot comes a light-ray rope of compassion, so hold it without fear and go.

[12981-13000]
Then your appearance's father is there, so run there with devotion. Beyond that is a crystal house with eight doors, where your mother Various Appearance dwells. At that time you will not recognize your mother due to habitual patterns. Beyond that is a house of various jewels, your true abode, so take your seat there. Thus prophesied by the Teacher, the boy Chain Puller spoke thus with gratitude.

[13001-13020]
Three words. See what is. Rest. Great Teacher, we shall do so, he said to his sister with determination. We shall do as the Teacher prophesied, following the path of liberation. Riding the sun's rays of wisdom, wearing rainbow armor of the elements. With a pearl garland binding the waist of channels, holding a crystal spear of awareness. A path appeared in space and they reached the jewel house without obstruction.

[13021-13040]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! The meaning is thus, profound and vast. The Great Circumference Land represents cyclic existence with its endless rounds. The mire represents body, speech, and mind as the vessel of practice. The lamp represents Rigpa's wisdom always burning within. The Radiant Land represents the clear light within the heart center. The Teacher Mirror Empty represents self-arising wisdom as the mirror lamp.

[13041-13060]
Between the journey and its completion, the meaning deepens. Prophecy represents understanding through direct experience beyond words. Mount Malaya's peak with ocean and teacher parents represents Rigpa's self-radiance. The bindu and empty lamp arise from the sphere of pure appearance and bindu of empty space. The parents instructing the children represent the sphere appearance and bindu maturing in the senses.

[13061-13080]
Therefore. Thus. The son not following instructions represents dull faculties and beginner's attachment to appearances. If attached, self-awareness is bound by demons of apprehension and grasping. Aunt represents co-emergent non-recognition with Rigpa that must be recognized. The single mirror represents the experience of object investigation revealing emptiness.

[13081-13100]
Resting in spaciousness, we understand the five with sword and mirrors represent how appearance is not Rigpa's object. Lost in delusion, Rigpa wanders there, needing the five wisdoms as companions. The son asking the method represents seeking liberation from delusion through inquiry. The Jewel Heap Land is the mind, the four people are the four lamps. Sending troops represents practice companions.

[13101-13103]
This old practitioner sees the symbolism complete. Going there represents delusion from ground appearance into existence. Captured by demons represents Rigpa falling under afflictions' power. Aunt's grief not releasing represents cyclic existence not liberated by words alone. The three messengers represent the three baskets, skillfully conveying symbolic meaning. The boy represents Rigpa bound in existence yet seeking liberation.

[13101-13103]
The Vajra Essence teaching presents delusion and liberation as symbolic narratives, yet these symbols are not merely stories. They are precise phenomenological maps of the mind's own display. The demon Black Halika is the apprehender-grasper duality that binds Rigpa. The old woman Mushroom Hat is co-emergent ignorance inseparable from awareness itself. The liberation comes not from destroying these but from recognizing their true nature.

[13101-13103]
When the boy summons the four lamps as troops, this represents the four aspects of rigpa's self-radiance gathering to recognize their source. The four mirrors looking at the demon reveal that what appears as obstacle is actually wisdom's own display. The house with eight doors is the eightfold manner of spontaneous presence's appearance—eight gates, all leading to the same recognition.

[13101-13103]
This old practitioner once thought liberation meant going somewhere else, attaining some other state. He sought the Pure Appearance Land as if it were distant. But the teaching reveals—it is here, now, the nature of this very awareness. The demon lands and pure lands are the same ground appearing differently based on recognition or non-recognition.

[13101-13103]
Thus. We proceed. The systematic presentation of the Treasury reveals a complete framework, yet the framework itself is not the truth it points toward. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, but in the nature itself they are never separate. The ground is not something that exists prior to the path. The result is not something that comes after. All three are aspects of one recognition.

[13101-13103]
The symbolic language of the Vajra Essence uses the imagery of ancient tales—parents and children, demons and heroes, imprisonment and liberation. These are not cultural artifacts to be decoded but living pointers to immediate experience. The parents represent the natural state. The children represent rigpa and its display. The demon land represents samsara as the display of non-recognition.

[13101-13103]
See through all symbols. The mirror of self-recognition is not an object to be found. It is the nature of awareness itself, reflecting its own face. The sword of clear light is not a weapon to be wielded. It is wisdom's own cutting through of conceptual fabrications. The jewel house is not a destination to reach. It is the spontaneous presence that is never apart from what you are.

[13101-13103]
Between the symbolic narrative and direct recognition lies the gap of understanding. Cross this gap not by accumulating more knowledge but by recognizing what knows. The one who understands the symbols is the symbol's source. The one who recognizes the nature is the nature itself recognizing.

[13101-13103]
The four lamps as allies represent the four wisdoms inherent in awareness—mirror-like wisdom reflecting all without grasping, equality wisdom knowing all phenomena as one taste, discriminating wisdom distinguishing without dividing, all-accomplishing wisdom acting without effort. These are not achievements to be gained. They are natural expressions revealed when non-recognition is seen through.

[13101-13103]
This old practitioner has witnessed the battle between wisdom and affliction many times. Each time, he discovered the battle was a play, the warriors were the same nature appearing differently, and the victory was already accomplished. The eighty thousand afflictions beheaded by wisdom's sword represent all conceptual grasping liberated in its own place.

[13101-13103]
The Vajra Chain Puller and Rim Holder represent the inseparability of emptiness and clarity, bindu and expanse. Brother and sister are wisdom and means united. Their consultation with the Teacher represents rigpa recognizing its own source. The crystal stupa is the body of light, the form of wisdom's own display.

[13101-13103]
From the peak of Malaya, the entire display is visible—samsara and nirvana as the two aspects of one ground, delusion and liberation as the two modes of one awareness, bondage and freedom as the two perceptions of one nature. The peak is not a place to climb to. It is the recognition that is already present.

[13101-13103]
Three words. Recognition. Liberation. Rest. All the elaborate symbolism, the detailed narratives, the philosophical frameworks—everything points to these three. Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping at duality. Rest in the natural perfection that is never apart from you.
