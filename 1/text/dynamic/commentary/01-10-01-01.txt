[12500-12519]
See what is. Existence itself—srid pa—grasped as real. Sentient beings' forms
arise inconceivably, beyond ordinary mind's reach. The path of delusion and
intention emerges as conceptual thought follows its own projections.

This old fool spent decades seeking the meaning of these symbols. Finally he
understood: Vajrasattva is rigpa itself. The Land of Vast Expanses is your own
nature. Every symbol points to what was never hidden.

[12520-12540]
Therefore. Thus. The symbolic narratives reveal delusion and liberation through
profound metaphors. The year of the pig—when non-recognition fully established
itself as conceptual imputation. The emanated sun—coarse perception arising as
Nirmanakaya.

Padmasambhava's visionary wisdom: The bird constellation appears in the sky of
mind, representing desire grasping at objects of the five senses. The old woman
with the mushroom hat emerges—co-emergent ignorance itself, blocking the gate
of liberation.

[12541-12560]
The four rugged ones represent the four conditions. The five wild ones—the five
poisons that obscure natural awareness. The single thief—anger stealing peace.
The single gatherer—deluded appearances compressed into grasped reality.

Mipham's diamond precision: Each symbol corresponds to specific aspects of
bondage. Yet recognizing the correspondence liberates. The sign and the signified
are not two.

[12561-12580]
In former times in the Land of Vast Expanses dwelt the Teacher Light Diffusion.
His two sons—primordial purity and spontaneous presence—imprisoned in the cave
of non-recognition. Five soldiers conquered from the stone fortress peak.

The Integrator's spacious view: This is not history. It is your own mind's drama
playing out now. The Teacher is awareness. The sons are wisdom aspects. The
imprisonment is forgetting your own nature.

[12581-12600]
The two sons escaping and killing guards—recognizing self-awareness, dissolving
conceptual bonds. Fleeing to sun and rain, gathering subjects—rigpa entering
the eyes, beholding the expanse. The twenty-one queens consulting—twenty-one
instructions manifesting inner meaning.

The Singing Yogi's gentle penetration: While walking to the temple, while
cooking the evening meal, while laughing with friends—this same recognition is
available. Never separate from daily life.

[12601-12620]
The five men guarding with five hats—the bindu of five lights remaining
unmoving, unreachable by thought. The four mirrors looking at the demon—the four
lamps' wisdom revealing self-abiding rigpa. Seeing the house with eight doors—
recognizing spontaneous presence.

Essence Holder's spacious instruction: Rest in this recognition. Do not try to
make it happen. Do not try to stop it. The resting itself is the view.

[12621-12640]
Third section: Another teaching from spontaneous presence. In the Land of Great
Circumference, a single lamp not extinguished within great mire of body and
mind. The Teacher Mirror Possessor—embodiment of awareness—speaking to Radiant
Being.

Ecstatic Tertön's urgency: Why wait? The recognition is here now. Not in the
story. Not in the symbol. Here, in the awareness reading these words.

[12641-12660]
Upon Mount Malaya's peak, Father Light Protection and Mother Vajra Sow dwell.
From their union came two children—wisdom and means. The son refusing to go to
demon land, fearing imprisonment by Black Halika—fearing non-recognition.

Wandering Guru's radical simplicity: The fear itself is the demon. The hesitation
is the prison. Go anyway. Recognition cuts through all obstacles.

[12661-12680]
The son asking for five servants—five wisdoms. Five mirrors—five Buddha
families. Sword anointed with sesame oil of clear light. The means are provided.
One need only use them.

Visionary Devotee's longing: How I pray for these supports! How I long for the
guru's blessing that opens the eyes! This longing itself is the path.

[12681-12700]
The parents' instruction: In the Jewel Heap Land of the mind dwell four caste
people—the four lamps. Ask them, and they will show the path. The son going to
demon land, meeting the mushroom woman—co-emergent ignorance asking for the
sword of recognition.

Consort's intimate wisdom: She asks for your conceptual mind. Give it. She asks
for your grasping. Surrender it. In the giving, fire is obtained.

[12701-12720]
The son giving the sword—cutting through grasping. The mushroom woman pleased,
giving fire—the fire of wisdom obtained. Going to the temple of Four Fierce
Brothers—four wisdom lamps dwelling there.

Lion-Faced's fierce compassion: Cut through now! Do not negotiate with the
demon of ignorance. Give what must be given. Obtain what was always yours.

[12721-12740]
Between the elaborate symbolism and direct recognition, no separation exists.
The symbols are fingers. The recognition is the moon. Stop analyzing the fingers
and look at what they indicate.

Longchenpa's vast synthesis: All these narratives—one teaching in many forms.
The ground is your nature. The path is recognition. The fruition is continuous.

[12741-12760]
This very moment—are you not the Teacher Light Diffusion? Are these not your
two sons of purity and presence? Is this not the demon land of samsara? The
recognition is here. The symbols dissolve into what they always pointed to.

Sky-Dancer's playful wisdom: You want to decode the story? You want to understand
every symbol? Meanwhile, the awareness that hears these words is the Teacher.
Stop playing with metaphors. Recognize directly.

[12761-End]
Three words. Symbol. Recognition. Liberation. Hold these. The symbol points.
Recognition sees. Liberation rests. Forget these, and even perfect decoding will
not help. Remember these, and the Treasury opens itself.

This old vagabond bows. The narratives have been told. The symbols explained.
What remains? Your own recognition. Look. See. Rest.
