[12500-12519] Between the nature (rang bzhin) of mind and its display, the Vajra Essence path reveals how existence itself arises as spontaneous presence. The forms of sentient beings emerge as inconceivable manifestations beyond ordinary conceptual mind. The path of delusion and intention arises according to how conceptual thought manifests. Vajrasattva represents pure awareness of Rigpa, the self-arising wisdom of Dharmata.

[12520-12540] Therefore. Thus. The symbolic narratives reveal delusion and liberation through profound metaphors. The vast expanse represents the ground (gzhi) of being. The primordial fourfold nature abides as the basis of all manifestation. The magnificent abode manifests as the gateway of spontaneous presence. The ground appearance arises effortlessly as the natural display of clear light.

[12541-12560] The timeless moment when sound emerged represents the beginningless Dharmata of Samantabhadra. When self appears as other through non-recognition, the ground (gzhi) of delusion manifests as apparent existence. The year of the pig marks the time when non-recognition was fully established as conceptual imputation. The emanated sun represents the clear perception of coarse object appearances arising as Nirmanakaya.

[12561-12580] This old practitioner sees the symbolism clearly. The bird constellation represents desire that arose as attachment to objects of the five senses. The old woman represents the emergence of non-recognition's awareness as deluded apprehension of self. The uncertain lineage represents how ground appearances manifest equally as liberation and delusion without distinction. The four rugged ones represent the four conditions that give rise to all experience.

[12581-12600] Three words. See what is. Rest. The five wild ones represent the five poisons that obscure the natural state. The single back support represents the conceptualizing mind that grasps at duality. The single thief represents anger that steals the peace of natural awareness. The single gatherer represents how deluded appearances manifest as singular reality through grasping. This mind becomes the apprehender of deluded appearance, binding Rigpa in cyclic existence.

[12601-12620] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! From this arise the manifold afflictions as the hosts of maras that obscure realization. Thus delusion arose from primordial purity without ground or basis, hence called existence. The second section reveals delusion and liberation through the profound metaphors of the Vajra Essence. From spontaneous presence comes the teaching that all pure appearances should be understood through these symbols.

[12621-12640] Resting in the symbolic meaning, we understand. In former times in the Land of Vast Expanses dwelt the Teacher Light Diffusion, manifestation of self-arising wisdom. He had two sons who were imprisoned in a cave—thus the story of delusion begins. Then five soldiers came and conquered from the stone fortress peak, representing the five poisons. The two sons were sent into the valley and the old woman with the mushroom hat blocked the gate of liberation.

[12641-12660] Between bondage and liberation, the drama unfolds. Then four men captured them and separated the five men from their horses, representing the four wisdoms. The two sons escaped by themselves and killed the prison guards, representing self-liberation. The two sons fled to a place of sun and rain, gathered subjects, and consulted with twenty-one queens of wisdom. They fled to the temple of Fierce Thought where five men wearing five hats guarded the gate.

[12661-12680] Therefore. Thus. No one could enter without recognition, thus the story continues. Then four mirrors looked at the demon and recognized their own nature as Dharmakaya. Then seeing a house with eight doors, they laughed and lost themselves in spontaneous presence. These metaphorical forms point to the meaning of primordial wisdom manifesting as Sambhogakaya. The Teacher Light Diffusion represents self-arising wisdom, the Buddha nature within all beings.

[12681-12700] This old practitioner chuckles at the symbolism. The two sons represent the wisdom of primordial purity and spontaneous presence united. Being imprisoned in the cave represents how spontaneous appearance lacks wisdom and is bound by non-recognition. The five men conquering from the stone fortress represent how the five poisons disturb Rigpa's self-abiding nature. The two sons blocked by the old woman represents Rigpa entering the valley of existence, blocked by non-recognition.

[12701-12720] Being captured by four men and separating five from horses represents how the four wisdoms purify the five afflictions. The four wisdoms liberate afflictions, gather wisdom, distinguish between afflictions and wisdom, and move to the expanse. The two sons escaping and killing guards represents recognizing self-awareness and dissolving conceptual bonds. The two sons fleeing to sun and rain and gathering subjects represents Rigpa entering the eyes and beholding the expanse.

[12721-12740] Three words. See what is. Rest. The queens consulting and fleeing to the temple represent the twenty-one instructions manifesting inner meaning. The five men guarding with hats represents the bindu of five lights remaining unmoving, unreachable by thought. The four mirrors looking at the demon represent the four lamps' wisdom revealing self-abiding Rigpa. Seeing the house with eight doors represents recognizing spontaneous presence and establishing the ground (gzhi).

[12741-12760] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! The third section presents another teaching from the same source of spontaneous presence. In the Land of Great Circumference dwelt a single lamp not extinguished within great mire of body and mind. The Land of Radiant Light was seen by the Teacher Mirror Possessor, embodiment of awareness. Listen, Radiant Being, and I shall prophesy for you without distraction, pointing to your true nature.

[12761-12780] Between the symbolic and the real, wisdom's meaning unfolds. Upon the peak of Mount Malaya lies the Ocean with Rim, where Father Light Protection and Mother Vajra Sow dwell. From their union came two children, brother and sister, representing wisdom and means. Then the parents spoke thus to the children, giving instructions for the path. Son, go to the demon land and come to the mirror of self-recognition.

[12781-12800] Therefore. Thus. Daughter, go to the thirty-three gods' victorious palace and gather flowers of merit. The son said he would not go because the demon Black Halika would imprison him in non-recognition. Again the parents questioned why he would not go, seeking to understand his hesitation. The son replied that in the demon land dwells Aunt Mushroom Hat, who is the co-emergent ignorance.

[12801-12820] Resting in the spacious meaning of the symbols, we understand. Ask her for fire of wisdom, he requested, understanding the need for recognition. The son spoke thus to his parents, revealing his understanding. Noble parents, that land is not mine, yet I shall go there for the benefit of beings. Send five servants representing the five wisdoms and a sword anointed with sesame oil of clear light.

[12821-12840] This old practitioner sees the profound teaching. Send five mirrors representing the five Buddha families, thus he requested. The parents rejoiced and agreed, sending five servants and five mirrors as supports. Then the son spoke again, asking for further guidance. Noble parents, if I am captured in the demon land, what method shall I use? The parents replied that in the Jewel Heap Land of the mind dwell four caste people, the four lamps.

[12841-12860] Send them as troops, one to gather troops of virtue, one with iron chains of method. Two to block the gate of delusion, thus they gave the complete instructions. Thus prophesied by the parents, the son said he would do so with confidence. Saying E Ma Ho, he departed, and the demon Black Halika saw him approaching. A flesh-eating human has appeared, do not let him escape, said the attendants of affliction.

[12861-12880] Three words. See what is. Rest. The five demons captured him, and Aunt Mushroom Hat put him in iron chains of grasping. She told the attendants that he killed her son, so do not release him from bondage. The attendants agreed, and thus he had no power to escape without wisdom. Then the boy spoke thus, using skillful means. Noble aunt, my parents said that Aunt Mushroom Hat dwells in the demon land of non-recognition.

[12881-12900] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! They told me to come to the mirror, so release me without capture for I am your relative. The old woman replied that she would not release him because he killed her son of delusion. Then the boy spoke again, threatening to use force. If you do not release me, I shall summon troops of wisdom to conquer. You yourself summon troops, she replied arrogantly, and thus he could not escape alone.

[12901-12920] Between capture and liberation, skillful means unfold. Then the boy sent messages to three friends representing the three baskets of teachings. Friends, in the Jewel Heap Land of mind dwell four people of the caste, the four lamps. Go there, for the boy Rig Knowledge has been captured, bring many troops of wisdom. They agreed and went swiftly to assist their friend.

[12921-12940] Therefore. Thus. Then within three days at sunrise, many troops came and blocked the gate of delusion. The prisoner's irons were broken, the old woman of non-recognition was expelled. The five were separated from their horses, and Aunt's son was captured. The attendants were beheaded with swords of wisdom and killed, liberating all. Then he fled to his own land and met his sister coming with many flowers of virtue.

[12941-12960] Resting in the meaning, we see the symbolism. The parents recognized them and rejoiced greatly, naming the brother Vajra Chain Puller. The sister was named Rim Holder, representing the bindu of clear light. Then the siblings consulted and saw the Teacher Mirror Possessor, Buddha Samantabhadra. Listen, noble child, in the Uncontrived Appearance Land dwells a crystal stupa of Dharmakaya.

[12961-12980] This old practitioner laughs with recognition. Upon its wheel are four silver mirrors of the four lamps, so go from Malaya's peak. Put it in the rim enclosure, climb the jewel stairs carrying a jewel vessel of wisdom. At the stupa's peak dwells a teacher Unchanging Light, the Dharmakaya Buddha. From his right foot comes a light-ray rope of compassion, so hold it without fear and go.

[12981-13000] Then your appearance's father is there, so run there with devotion. Beyond that is a crystal house with eight doors, where your mother Various Appearance dwells. At that time you will not recognize your mother due to habitual patterns. Beyond that is a house of various jewels, your true abode, so take your seat there. Thus prophesied by the Teacher, the boy Chain Puller spoke thus with gratitude.

[13001-13020] Three words. See what is. Rest. Great Teacher, we shall do so, he said to his sister with determination. We shall do as the Teacher prophesied, following the path of liberation. Riding the sun's rays of wisdom, wearing rainbow armor of the elements. With a pearl garland binding the waist of channels, holding a crystal spear of awareness. A path appeared in space and they reached the jewel house without obstruction.

[13021-13040] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! The meaning is thus, profound and vast. The Great Circumference Land represents cyclic existence with its endless rounds. The mire represents body, speech, and mind as the vessel of practice. The lamp represents Rigpa's wisdom always burning within. The Radiant Land represents the clear light within the heart center. The Teacher Mirror Empty represents self-arising wisdom as the mirror lamp.

[13041-13060] Between the journey and its completion, the meaning deepens. Prophecy represents understanding through direct experience beyond words. Mount Malaya's peak with ocean and teacher parents represents Rigpa's self-radiance. The bindu and empty lamp arise from the sphere of pure appearance and bindu of empty space. The parents instructing the children represent the sphere appearance and bindu maturing in the senses.

[13061-13080] Therefore. Thus. The son not following instructions represents dull faculties and beginner's attachment to appearances. If attached, self-awareness is bound by demons of apprehension and grasping. Aunt represents co-emergent non-recognition with Rigpa that must be recognized. The single mirror represents the experience of object investigation revealing emptiness.

[13081-13100] Resting in spaciousness, we understand the five with sword and mirrors represent how appearance is not Rigpa's object. Lost in delusion, Rigpa wanders there, needing the five wisdoms as companions. The son asking the method represents seeking liberation from delusion through inquiry. The Jewel Heap Land is the mind, the four people are the four lamps. Sending troops represents practice companions.

[13101-13103] This old practitioner sees the symbolism complete. Going there represents delusion from ground appearance into existence. Captured by demons represents Rigpa falling under afflictions' power. Aunt's grief not releasing represents cyclic existence not liberated by words alone. The three messengers represent the three baskets, skillfully conveying symbolic meaning. The boy represents Rigpa bound in existence yet seeking liberation.

[12500-12500] Calling the four lamps as allies, wisdom and realization arise to conquer. The prison irons break, the old woman of non-recognition is expelled. The five poisons' afflictions with their wind-horses are separated from Rigpa. Rigpa recognizes its nature without departing from its place, capturing the essence. Eighty thousand afflictions are beheaded by the sword of wisdom.

[12500-12500] Three words. See what is. Rest. Clear light of Dharmata's self-appearance recognized as the ground (gzhi). The sister gathering flowers represents the lamp's perfect measure accomplished. The parents naming represents non-recognition severed, Rigpa self-clear. The Vajra Chain Puller self-arises as Nirmanakaya for beings. The empty bindu lamp appears to objects as Sambhogakaya.

[12500-12500] Therefore. Thus. The siblings consulting represents Rigpa entering the expanse, gathered as one. Seeing the Teacher represents the first bardo's clear light of Dharmakaya. The Uncontrived Appearance Land represents Dharmata bardo's natural display. The stupa represents the five lights' five bindus adorned as the Buddha body. The wheel with four mirrors represents the five light-paths and four wisdoms united.

[12500-12500] Between practice and realization, the path completes. These can be seen now if practiced with devotion and diligence. Coming from Malaya represents non-abiding, looking at the expanse's enclosure. The stairs, vessel, and peak's teacher with light represent realization recognizing nature. The eight-door house represents spontaneous presence's eight gateways of perception.

[12500-12500] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! The jewel house represents the precious spontaneous presence's interior. Going according to prophecy represents riding the light-ray sunbeam without transformation. The measure of realization binds, wisdom's spear in hand cutting delusion. A path arises in space, liberating in primordial purity's ground of Dharmakaya. The fourth section presents another teaching from spontaneous presence.

[12500-12500] Resting in the meaning, we see the Pure Appearance Land dwells a fortress with eight doors of liberation. The boy Self-Arising Rigpa Knowledge rules there as the natural state. An old woman Mushroom Hat dwells there, and the king Arrow Guard Fame Power. He has five princely sons who went to play, capturing the old woman of ignorance.

[12500-12500] This old practitioner sees the irony. Then the boy went to the daughter's playground, captured and put in chains. The meaning is thus, profound symbolism of the path. The Pure Appearance Land represents Rigpa's pure realm of Dharmakaya. The eight-door fortress represents spontaneous presence's eight gateways of liberation. Self-arising Rigpa dwells with co-emergent non-recognition as the old woman.

[12500-12500] The king represents the root of afflictions, self-grasping at true existence. The sons represent the five poison afflictions that disturb the mind. Play represents mastery over the five senses while experiencing attachment and aversion. Capturing the old woman represents non-recognition grasped by the five poisons. The five poisons become one with non-recognition, unified in deluded essence.

[12500-12500] Three words. See what is. Rest. This is how non-recognition appears in each sense when meeting the five poisons. Going to the daughter's playground represents how non-recognition's essence exists in Rigpa. Rigpa captured in its place represents conceptual grasping wherever attachment and aversion arise. The essence is Rigpa, the reverse is non-recognition, knowing which liberates completely.

[12500-12500] Therefore. Thus. The fifth section on reversing delusion presents another profound teaching. In the Jewel Heap Land, an old woman possessed a precious jewel of awareness. Five thieves stole it, causing her suffering in cyclic existence. Then the thieves were pursued and went to the Thorn Land of difficulties. The five thieves stealing caused the old woman to faint into ignorance.

[12500-12500] Between loss and recovery, wisdom unfolds. Pursuing the thieves from the Thorn Land, the old woman revived through wisdom. Then the old woman's son White Fire God spoke thus with inquiry. Has my jewel been lost, he asked, seeking his true nature. The five men replied, the jewel is not lost, but kill your old woman of ignorance.

[12500-12500] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! If you do not kill the old woman, we will not give the jewel of wisdom. So he killed her, ate the flesh, drank the blood, sucked the bones completely. Making everything non-existent, the thieves gave the jewel of liberation. The meaning is thus, a profound teaching on self-liberation. The Jewel Heap Land represents the mind as the source of all.

[12500-12500] Resting in the meaning, we understand. The old woman is non-recognition, the jewel is Rigpa, the thieves are the five poisons. Suffering represents Rigpa mixed with attachment and aversion, not experiencing its own nature. Pursuing represents severing, going to the Thorn Land of practice. The old woman fainting represents temporary ignorance overcome by wisdom.

[12500-12500] This old practitioner sees the symbolism. Wisdom investigates Rigpa and its co-emergent non-recognition with the five poisons. Now in cyclic existence, knowing this, non-recognition and five poisons merely abide in the ground (gzhi). Thus when the root of delusion is severed by wisdom, Rigpa recognizes itself. Non-recognition self-liberates, like reviving after being severed from grasping.

[12500-12500] Fire God represents wisdom born of self-recognition, burning delusion. Asking if the jewel is lost, killing the old woman represents Rigpa investigating itself. Seeing not a single hair harmed, not even a fraction damaged, pure from the start. If co-emergent non-recognition is not abandoned, it hinders like being stuck in existence.

[12500-12500] Three words. See what is. Rest. The five poisons self-arise and appear to themselves as wisdom. Looking inward at self-nature, co-emergent non-recognition liberates spontaneously. Concepts self-liberate, anger not abandoned purifies in its own place. Attachment purifies, drinking blood represents integrating passion.

[12500-12500] What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. Recognition is immediate.

[12500-12500] The Vajra Essence teaching presents delusion and liberation as symbolic narratives, yet these symbols are not merely stories. They are precise phenomenological maps of the mind's own display. The demon Black Halika is the apprehender-grasper duality that binds Rigpa. The old woman Mushroom Hat is co-emergent ignorance inseparable from awareness itself. The liberation comes not from destroying these but from recognizing their true nature.

[12500-12500] When the boy summons the four lamps as troops, this represents the four aspects of rigpa's self-radiance gathering to recognize their source. The four mirrors looking at the demon reveal that what appears as obstacle is actually wisdom's own display. The house with eight doors is the eightfold manner of spontaneous presence's appearance—eight gates, all leading to the same recognition.

[12500-12500] This old practitioner once thought liberation meant going somewhere else, attaining some other state. He sought the Pure Appearance Land as if it were distant. But the teaching reveals—it is here, now, the nature of this very awareness. The demon lands and pure lands are the same ground appearing differently based on recognition or non-recognition.

[12500-12500] Thus. We proceed. The systematic presentation of the Treasury reveals a complete framework, yet the framework itself is not the truth it points toward. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, but in the nature itself they are never separate. The ground is not something that exists prior to the path. The result is not something that comes after. All three are aspects of one recognition.

[12500-12500] The symbolic language of the Vajra Essence uses the imagery of ancient tales—parents and children, demons and heroes, imprisonment and liberation. These are not cultural artifacts to be decoded but living pointers to immediate experience. The parents represent the natural state. The children represent rigpa and its display. The demon land represents samsara as the display of non-recognition.

[12500-12500] See through all symbols. The mirror of self-recognition is not an object to be found. It is the nature of awareness itself, reflecting its own face. The sword of clear light is not a weapon to be wielded. It is wisdom's own cutting through of conceptual fabrications. The jewel house is not a destination to reach. It is the spontaneous presence that is never apart from what you are.

[12500-12500] Between the symbolic narrative and direct recognition lies the gap of understanding. Cross this gap not by accumulating more knowledge but by recognizing what knows. The one who understands the symbols is the symbol's source. The one who recognizes the nature is the nature itself recognizing.

[12500-12500] The four lamps as allies represent the four wisdoms inherent in awareness—mirror-like wisdom reflecting all without grasping, equality wisdom knowing all phenomena as one taste, discriminating wisdom distinguishing without dividing, all-accomplishing wisdom acting without effort. These are not achievements to be gained. They are natural expressions revealed when non-recognition is seen through.

[12500-12500] This old practitioner has witnessed the battle between wisdom and affliction many times. Each time, he discovered the battle was a play, the warriors were the same nature appearing differently, and the victory was already accomplished. The eighty thousand afflictions beheaded by wisdom's sword represent all conceptual grasping liberated in its own place.

[12500-12500] The Vajra Chain Puller and Rim Holder represent the inseparability of emptiness and clarity, bindu and expanse. Brother and sister are wisdom and means united. Their consultation with the Teacher represents rigpa recognizing its own source. The crystal stupa is the body of light, the form of wisdom's own display.

[12500-12500] From the peak of Malaya, the entire display is visible—samsara and nirvana as the two aspects of one ground, delusion and liberation as the two modes of one awareness, bondage and freedom as the two perceptions of one nature. The peak is not a place to climb to. It is the recognition that is already present.

[12500-12500] Three words. Recognition. Liberation. Rest. All the elaborate symbolism, the detailed narratives, the philosophical frameworks—everything points to these three. Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping at duality. Rest in the natural perfection that is never apart from you.

[12500-12500] The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle has presented these teachings with utmost care. Not to add to philosophical knowledge but to create conditions for recognition. The conditions are present. The recognition is available. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

[12500-12500] The path of the Great Perfection is unique among all Buddhist vehicles. While lower vehicles work gradually through causes and conditions, accumulating merit and wisdom over eons, Dzogchen points directly to what is already complete. This does not mean effort is useless—it means effort and ease, practice and non-practice, are both the play of what is already perfect.

[12500-12500] This old practitioner spent decades in traditional practice—prostrations, offerings, mantra recitation, visualization. Each practice bore fruit. Each effort brought insight. Yet the recognition that finally liberated was not the result of these practices. It was the recognition that the one practicing was already the nature being sought. The practices created conditions. The recognition revealed what the conditions were conditions for.

[12500-12500] Thus. We analyze. The symbolism of the Vajra Essence presents a complete phenomenology of mind. The ground gives rise to both wisdom and delusion. The path recognizes wisdom and liberates delusion. The result is continuous recognition without interruption. Yet these three phases are pedagogical, not ontological. In the nature itself, there is no before or after, no ground path or result—only awareness knowing itself in infinite variety.

[12500-12500] The five poisons as soldiers, the four wisdoms as allies, the imprisonment and liberation—all these symbols map onto immediate experience. When anger arises, is it not like a soldier conquering? When wisdom recognizes anger's nature, is it not like the four allies gathering? The symbols are not mythology. They are the structure of your own mind, described in images.

[12500-12500] See what is. The ground of being is not a place or time. It is what allows all places and times to appear. The spontaneous presence is not an event or occurrence. It is what allows all events to unfold. Primordial purity is not a state to achieve. It is the purity that is already present, never stained by what appears within it.

[12500-12500] Between samsara and nirvana, the difference is not in what appears but in how it is recognized. The same display that binds in delusion liberates in recognition. The same ground that gives rise to suffering gives rise to bliss. The difference is not in the ground but in the recognition of the ground.

[12500-12500] This old practitioner has nothing more to say. All words have been spoken. All symbols have been presented. All frameworks have been established. What remains? Only recognition. The recognition that is not something new but the recognition of what has always been. The recognition that completes the path. The recognition that is the result. Rest in that recognition.

[12500-12500] The Great Perfection teaching is complete. The Treasury is open. The jewel is in your hand. See it. Recognize it. Rest in it. This is the supreme vehicle. This is the path of Dzogchen. This is what you are.

[12500-12500] Three final words. Ground recognized. Display liberated. Nature complete.

[13100-13120]
Three words. See what is. Rest. The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle presents the Great Perfection teachings not as philosophy to study but as recognition to embody. All symbolic narratives—the demon lands, the old women, the jewels and fortresses—point to one thing only: awareness recognizing itself.

[13100-13120]
This old practitioner has traveled through all the demon lands described in these tales. He has met the five poisons as soldiers. He has been imprisoned in the cave of non-recognition. He has been blocked by the old woman of co-emergent ignorance. Through it all, he learned—the demons are not external. The lands are not distant. They are the display of his own nature, appearing to himself.

[13100-13120]
Thus. We proceed. The systematic framework of the Treasury integrates ground, path, and result into a coherent presentation. The ground—primordial purity and spontaneous presence. The path—recognition and stabilization. The result—continuous recognition without interruption. But these three are one. The ground is the path is the result. What changes is not the nature but the recognition of it.

[13100-13120]
Between bondage and liberation, the drama unfolds in awareness itself. The two sons represent wisdom and method. The cave represents forgetting one's nature. The escape represents recognition. All these symbols are skillful means—different doorways into the same recognition. Do not mistake the symbols for the symbolized.

[13100-13120]
See through it all. The elaborate narratives, the detailed symbolism, the philosophical frameworks—all point to what cannot be pointed to. The finger is not the moon. The teaching is not the recognition. Use the teaching, then let it go. Rest in the recognition that remains when all teachings are exhausted.

[13100-13120]
The consort's embrace reveals the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two entities meeting but one nature knowing itself. The path of liberation is not a journey from here to there. It is the recognition that the journey itself is the destination. The one who travels is the place traveled to.

[13100-13120]
Rest in the natural perfection that is never apart from you. The Great Perfection is not something to achieve. It is the perfection that is already present, already complete, always was. Recognition does not create it. Non-recognition does not harm it. Rest in that which remains when all seeking ceases.

[13100-13120]
Emaho! The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings who encounter these words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. May the symbolic narratives unlock the symbolic nature of all experience. May awareness recognize itself in every moment. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.

[13100-13120]
Three final words. Recognition complete. Liberation certain. Rest.
