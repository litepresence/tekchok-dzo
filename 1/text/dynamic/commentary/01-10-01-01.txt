[12500-12519] Between the nature (rang bzhin) of mind and its display, the Vajra Essence path reveals how existence itself arises as spontaneous presence. The forms of sentient beings emerge as inconceivable manifestations beyond ordinary conceptual mind. The path of delusion and intention arises according to how conceptual thought manifests. Vajrasattva represents pure awareness of Rigpa, the self-arising wisdom of Dharmata.

[12520-12540] Therefore. Thus. The symbolic narratives reveal delusion and liberation through profound metaphors. The vast expanse represents the ground (gzhi) of being. The primordial fourfold nature abides as the basis of all manifestation. The magnificent abode manifests as the gateway of spontaneous presence. The ground appearance arises effortlessly as the natural display of clear light.

[12541-12560] The timeless moment when sound emerged represents the beginningless Dharmata of Samantabhadra. When self appears as other through non-recognition, the ground (gzhi) of delusion manifests as apparent existence. The year of the pig marks the time when non-recognition was fully established as conceptual imputation. The emanated sun represents the clear perception of coarse object appearances arising as Nirmanakaya.

[12561-12580] This old practitioner sees the symbolism clearly. The bird constellation represents desire that arose as attachment to objects of the five senses. The old woman represents the emergence of non-recognition's awareness as deluded apprehension of self. The uncertain lineage represents how ground appearances manifest equally as liberation and delusion without distinction. The four rugged ones represent the four conditions that give rise to all experience.

[12581-12600] Three words. See what is. Rest. The five wild ones represent the five poisons that obscure the natural state. The single back support represents the conceptualizing mind that grasps at duality. The single thief represents anger that steals the peace of natural awareness. The single gatherer represents how deluded appearances manifest as singular reality through grasping. This mind becomes the apprehender of deluded appearance, binding Rigpa in cyclic existence.

[12601-12620] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! From this arise the manifold afflictions as the hosts of maras that obscure realization. Thus delusion arose from primordial purity without ground or basis, hence called existence. The second section reveals delusion and liberation through the profound metaphors of the Vajra Essence. From spontaneous presence comes the teaching that all pure appearances should be understood through these symbols.

[12621-12640] Resting in the symbolic meaning, we understand. In former times in the Land of Vast Expanses dwelt the Teacher Light Diffusion, manifestation of self-arising wisdom. He had two sons who were imprisoned in a cave—thus the story of delusion begins. Then five soldiers came and conquered from the stone fortress peak, representing the five poisons. The two sons were sent into the valley and the old woman with the mushroom hat blocked the gate of liberation.

[12641-12660] Between bondage and liberation, the drama unfolds. Then four men captured them and separated the five men from their horses, representing the four wisdoms. The two sons escaped by themselves and killed the prison guards, representing self-liberation. The two sons fled to a place of sun and rain, gathered subjects, and consulted with twenty-one queens of wisdom. They fled to the temple of Fierce Thought where five men wearing five hats guarded the gate.

[12661-12680] Therefore. Thus. No one could enter without recognition, thus the story continues. Then four mirrors looked at the demon and recognized their own nature as Dharmakaya. Then seeing a house with eight doors, they laughed and lost themselves in spontaneous presence. These metaphorical forms point to the meaning of primordial wisdom manifesting as Sambhogakaya. The Teacher Light Diffusion represents self-arising wisdom, the Buddha nature within all beings.

[12681-12700] This old practitioner chuckles at the symbolism. The two sons represent the wisdom of primordial purity and spontaneous presence united. Being imprisoned in the cave represents how spontaneous appearance lacks wisdom and is bound by non-recognition. The five men conquering from the stone fortress represent how the five poisons disturb Rigpa's self-abiding nature. The two sons blocked by the old woman represents Rigpa entering the valley of existence, blocked by non-recognition.

[12701-12720] Being captured by four men and separating five from horses represents how the four wisdoms purify the five afflictions. The four wisdoms liberate afflictions, gather wisdom, distinguish between afflictions and wisdom, and move to the expanse. The two sons escaping and killing guards represents recognizing self-awareness and dissolving conceptual bonds. The two sons fleeing to sun and rain and gathering subjects represents Rigpa entering the eyes and beholding the expanse.

[12721-12740] Three words. See what is. Rest. The queens consulting and fleeing to the temple represent the twenty-one instructions manifesting inner meaning. The five men guarding with hats represents the bindu of five lights remaining unmoving, unreachable by thought. The four mirrors looking at the demon represent the four lamps' wisdom revealing self-abiding Rigpa. Seeing the house with eight doors represents recognizing spontaneous presence and establishing the ground (gzhi).

[12741-12760] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! The third section presents another teaching from the same source of spontaneous presence. In the Land of Great Circumference dwelt a single lamp not extinguished within great mire of body and mind. The Land of Radiant Light was seen by the Teacher Mirror Possessor, embodiment of awareness. Listen, Radiant Being, and I shall prophesy for you without distraction, pointing to your true nature.

[12761-12780] Between the symbolic and the real, wisdom's meaning unfolds. Upon the peak of Mount Malaya lies the Ocean with Rim, where Father Light Protection and Mother Vajra Sow dwell. From their union came two children, brother and sister, representing wisdom and means. Then the parents spoke thus to the children, giving instructions for the path. Son, go to the demon land and come to the mirror of self-recognition.

[12781-12800] Therefore. Thus. Daughter, go to the thirty-three gods' victorious palace and gather flowers of merit. The son said he would not go because the demon Black Halika would imprison him in non-recognition. Again the parents questioned why he would not go, seeking to understand his hesitation. The son replied that in the demon land dwells Aunt Mushroom Hat, who is the co-emergent ignorance.

[12801-12820] Resting in the spacious meaning of the symbols, we understand. Ask her for fire of wisdom, he requested, understanding the need for recognition. The son spoke thus to his parents, revealing his understanding. Noble parents, that land is not mine, yet I shall go there for the benefit of beings. Send five servants representing the five wisdoms and a sword anointed with sesame oil of clear light.

[12821-12840] This old practitioner sees the profound teaching. Send five mirrors representing the five Buddha families, thus he requested. The parents rejoiced and agreed, sending five servants and five mirrors as supports. Then the son spoke again, asking for further guidance. Noble parents, if I am captured in the demon land, what method shall I use? The parents replied that in the Jewel Heap Land of the mind dwell four caste people, the four lamps.

[12841-12860] Send them as troops, one to gather troops of virtue, one with iron chains of method. Two to block the gate of delusion, thus they gave the complete instructions. Thus prophesied by the parents, the son said he would do so with confidence. Saying E Ma Ho, he departed, and the demon Black Halika saw him approaching. A flesh-eating human has appeared, do not let him escape, said the attendants of affliction.

[12861-12880] Three words. See what is. Rest. The five demons captured him, and Aunt Mushroom Hat put him in iron chains of grasping. She told the attendants that he killed her son, so do not release him from bondage. The attendants agreed, and thus he had no power to escape without wisdom. Then the boy spoke thus, using skillful means. Noble aunt, my parents said that Aunt Mushroom Hat dwells in the demon land of non-recognition.

[12881-12900] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! They told me to come to the mirror, so release me without capture for I am your relative. The old woman replied that she would not release him because he killed her son of delusion. Then the boy spoke again, threatening to use force. If you do not release me, I shall summon troops of wisdom to conquer. You yourself summon troops, she replied arrogantly, and thus he could not escape alone.

[12901-12920] Between capture and liberation, skillful means unfold. Then the boy sent messages to three friends representing the three baskets of teachings. Friends, in the Jewel Heap Land of mind dwell four people of the caste, the four lamps. Go there, for the boy Rig Knowledge has been captured, bring many troops of wisdom. They agreed and went swiftly to assist their friend.

[12921-12940] Therefore. Thus. Then within three days at sunrise, many troops came and blocked the gate of delusion. The prisoner's irons were broken, the old woman of non-recognition was expelled. The five were separated from their horses, and Aunt's son was captured. The attendants were beheaded with swords of wisdom and killed, liberating all. Then he fled to his own land and met his sister coming with many flowers of virtue.

[12941-12960] Resting in the meaning, we see the symbolism. The parents recognized them and rejoiced greatly, naming the brother Vajra Chain Puller. The sister was named Rim Holder, representing the bindu of clear light. Then the siblings consulted and saw the Teacher Mirror Possessor, Buddha Samantabhadra. Listen, noble child, in the Uncontrived Appearance Land dwells a crystal stupa of Dharmakaya.

[12961-12980] This old practitioner laughs with recognition. Upon its wheel are four silver mirrors of the four lamps, so go from Malaya's peak. Put it in the rim enclosure, climb the jewel stairs carrying a jewel vessel of wisdom. At the stupa's peak dwells a teacher Unchanging Light, the Dharmakaya Buddha. From his right foot comes a light-ray rope of compassion, so hold it without fear and go.

[12981-13000] Then your appearance's father is there, so run there with devotion. Beyond that is a crystal house with eight doors, where your mother Various Appearance dwells. At that time you will not recognize your mother due to habitual patterns. Beyond that is a house of various jewels, your true abode, so take your seat there. Thus prophesied by the Teacher, the boy Chain Puller spoke thus with gratitude.

[13001-13020] Three words. See what is. Rest. Great Teacher, we shall do so, he said to his sister with determination. We shall do as the Teacher prophesied, following the path of liberation. Riding the sun's rays of wisdom, wearing rainbow armor of the elements. With a pearl garland binding the waist of channels, holding a crystal spear of awareness. A path appeared in space and they reached the jewel house without obstruction.

[13021-13040] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! The meaning is thus, profound and vast. The Great Circumference Land represents cyclic existence with its endless rounds. The mire represents body, speech, and mind as the vessel of practice. The lamp represents Rigpa's wisdom always burning within. The Radiant Land represents the clear light within the heart center. The Teacher Mirror Empty represents self-arising wisdom as the mirror lamp.

[13041-13060] Between the journey and its completion, the meaning deepens. Prophecy represents understanding through direct experience beyond words. Mount Malaya's peak with ocean and teacher parents represents Rigpa's self-radiance. The bindu and empty lamp arise from the sphere of pure appearance and bindu of empty space. The parents instructing the children represent the sphere appearance and bindu maturing in the senses.

[13061-13080] Therefore. Thus. The son not following instructions represents dull faculties and beginner's attachment to appearances. If attached, self-awareness is bound by demons of apprehension and grasping. Aunt represents co-emergent non-recognition with Rigpa that must be recognized. The single mirror represents the experience of object investigation revealing emptiness.

[13081-13100] Resting in spaciousness, we understand the five with sword and mirrors represent how appearance is not Rigpa's object. Lost in delusion, Rigpa wanders there, needing the five wisdoms as companions. The son asking the method represents seeking liberation from delusion through inquiry. The Jewel Heap Land is the mind, the four people are the four lamps. Sending troops represents practice companions.

[13101-13103] This old practitioner sees the symbolism complete. Going there represents delusion from ground appearance into existence. Captured by demons represents Rigpa falling under afflictions' power. Aunt's grief not releasing represents cyclic existence not liberated by words alone. The three messengers represent the three baskets, skillfully conveying symbolic meaning. The boy represents Rigpa bound in existence yet seeking liberation.

[12500-12500] Calling the four lamps as allies, wisdom and realization arise to conquer. The prison irons break, the old woman of non-recognition is expelled. The five poisons' afflictions with their wind-horses are separated from Rigpa. Rigpa recognizes its nature without departing from its place, capturing the essence. Eighty thousand afflictions are beheaded by the sword of wisdom.

[12500-12500] Three words. See what is. Rest. Clear light of Dharmata's self-appearance recognized as the ground (gzhi). The sister gathering flowers represents the lamp's perfect measure accomplished. The parents naming represents non-recognition severed, Rigpa self-clear. The Vajra Chain Puller self-arises as Nirmanakaya for beings. The empty bindu lamp appears to objects as Sambhogakaya.

[12500-12500] Therefore. Thus. The siblings consulting represents Rigpa entering the expanse, gathered as one. Seeing the Teacher represents the first bardo's clear light of Dharmakaya. The Uncontrived Appearance Land represents Dharmata bardo's natural display. The stupa represents the five lights' five bindus adorned as the Buddha body. The wheel with four mirrors represents the five light-paths and four wisdoms united.

[12500-12500] Between practice and realization, the path completes. These can be seen now if practiced with devotion and diligence. Coming from Malaya represents non-abiding, looking at the expanse's enclosure. The stairs, vessel, and peak's teacher with light represent realization recognizing nature. The eight-door house represents spontaneous presence's eight gateways of perception.

[12500-12500] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! The jewel house represents the precious spontaneous presence's interior. Going according to prophecy represents riding the light-ray sunbeam without transformation. The measure of realization binds, wisdom's spear in hand cutting delusion. A path arises in space, liberating in primordial purity's ground of Dharmakaya. The fourth section presents another teaching from spontaneous presence.

[12500-12500] Resting in the meaning, we see the Pure Appearance Land dwells a fortress with eight doors of liberation. The boy Self-Arising Rigpa Knowledge rules there as the natural state. An old woman Mushroom Hat dwells there, and the king Arrow Guard Fame Power. He has five princely sons who went to play, capturing the old woman of ignorance.

[12500-12500] This old practitioner sees the irony. Then the boy went to the daughter's playground, captured and put in chains. The meaning is thus, profound symbolism of the path. The Pure Appearance Land represents Rigpa's pure realm of Dharmakaya. The eight-door fortress represents spontaneous presence's eight gateways of liberation. Self-arising Rigpa dwells with co-emergent non-recognition as the old woman.

[12500-12500] The king represents the root of afflictions, self-grasping at true existence. The sons represent the five poison afflictions that disturb the mind. Play represents mastery over the five senses while experiencing attachment and aversion. Capturing the old woman represents non-recognition grasped by the five poisons. The five poisons become one with non-recognition, unified in deluded essence.

[12500-12500] Three words. See what is. Rest. This is how non-recognition appears in each sense when meeting the five poisons. Going to the daughter's playground represents how non-recognition's essence exists in Rigpa. Rigpa captured in its place represents conceptual grasping wherever attachment and aversion arise. The essence is Rigpa, the reverse is non-recognition, knowing which liberates completely.

[12500-12500] Therefore. Thus. The fifth section on reversing delusion presents another profound teaching. In the Jewel Heap Land, an old woman possessed a precious jewel of awareness. Five thieves stole it, causing her suffering in cyclic existence. Then the thieves were pursued and went to the Thorn Land of difficulties. The five thieves stealing caused the old woman to faint into ignorance.

[12500-12500] Between loss and recovery, wisdom unfolds. Pursuing the thieves from the Thorn Land, the old woman revived through wisdom. Then the old woman's son White Fire God spoke thus with inquiry. Has my jewel been lost, he asked, seeking his true nature. The five men replied, the jewel is not lost, but kill your old woman of ignorance.

[12500-12500] See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! If you do not kill the old woman, we will not give the jewel of wisdom. So he killed her, ate the flesh, drank the blood, sucked the bones completely. Making everything non-existent, the thieves gave the jewel of liberation. The meaning is thus, a profound teaching on self-liberation. The Jewel Heap Land represents the mind as the source of all.

[12500-12500] Resting in the meaning, we understand. The old woman is non-recognition, the jewel is Rigpa, the thieves are the five poisons. Suffering represents Rigpa mixed with attachment and aversion, not experiencing its own nature. Pursuing represents severing, going to the Thorn Land of practice. The old woman fainting represents temporary ignorance overcome by wisdom.

[12500-12500] This old practitioner sees the symbolism. Wisdom investigates Rigpa and its co-emergent non-recognition with the five poisons. Now in cyclic existence, knowing this, non-recognition and five poisons merely abide in the ground (gzhi). Thus when the root of delusion is severed by wisdom, Rigpa recognizes itself. Non-recognition self-liberates, like reviving after being severed from grasping.

[12500-12500] Fire God represents wisdom born of self-recognition, burning delusion. Asking if the jewel is lost, killing the old woman represents Rigpa investigating itself. Seeing not a single hair harmed, not even a fraction damaged, pure from the start. If co-emergent non-recognition is not abandoned, it hinders like being stuck in existence.

[12500-12500] Three words. See what is. Rest. The five poisons self-arise and appear to themselves as wisdom. Looking inward at self-nature, co-emergent non-recognition liberates spontaneously. Concepts self-liberate, anger not abandoned purifies in its own place. Attachment purifies, drinking blood represents integrating passion.
What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. Recognition is immediate.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[01-10-01-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
