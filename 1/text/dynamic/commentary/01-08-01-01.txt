Seven bases. Seven views. Seven blind men touching different parts of the same elephant. This is not philosophy—this is what happens when the unlimited is forced into limited containers.

[7-15]
Therefore. Thus. The Great Perfection presents seven ways of describing the basis. Not because there are seven bases. Because minds need seven doors to enter what has no entrance.

[16-19]
First: primordially pure from the beginning. Like space unstained by the clouds that pass through it. The purity is not achieved. It is the nature (rang bzhin) of what is.

[20-31]
Second: spontaneously present. Like the sun that does not choose to shine, yet illuminates all. Qualities complete without cultivation. Radiance without effort.

[32-42]
Third: uncertain, indeterminate. Not fixed as this or that. Not captured by any concept. The awareness that refuses to be boxed. Seven blind men arguing about the elephant, each convinced they hold the truth.

[43-53]
Fourth: certain, established. Unchanging in its nature. While appearances transform, the basis remains. Like the ocean holding all waves without becoming the waves.

[54-64]
Fifth: transformable into anything. The mirror showing all reflections without becoming any. The basis as infinite potential, not fixed identity.

[65-75]
Sixth: accepting anything that arises. The ground that holds samsara and nirvana equally. Not choosing between confusion and liberation. Both are its play.

[66-76]
Seventh: various, manifold, multi-colored. The appearance without ceasing. The variegated display that is mistaken for multiplicity. Like one crystal showing many colors—seven men seeing seven different elephants.

[66-76]
This uneducated yogi... has held each of these views in turn. He thought primordial purity was the final truth. Then spontaneous presence. Then uncertainty. Each view was a prison he mistook for liberation. Finally he laughed—all seven are A map shows the path, but paper is not the journey. at the same moon, and the moon is not participating.

[66-76]
From the Thalgyur: The manner of abiding spontaneously established from the beginning also manifests through the manner of the seven bases. Multiplicity appears as spontaneous presence. What changes is uncertain. What does not change is certain.

 The measure of appearance is transformable. Because all arise, assertions are made. Because confusion is purified as primordially pure, all manners of appearance are called variegated.

[66-76]
The tantra speaks in seven voices to reach seven minds. But the basis itself never speaks. It is spoken about. This is key: the seven bases are descriptions, not the described. The menu is not the meal.

[50-76]
From Klongdrukpa: The basis spontaneously established from the very beginning, although not existing as a singular entity that can be grasped. When abiding as spontaneous presence, the gathering of multiplicity appears as the essential nature. When abiding as uncertain, the aspect of mind that transforms appears. When abiding as certainty, remembrance without movement.

 When abiding as transformable, mind through effort. When abiding as essence of what-is, whatever appears appears as its own nature. When abiding as variegated, various individual manners. When abiding as primordially pure, stains appear as primordially non-existent. All these arise from stages of mind's own delusion, while one's own face is primordially pure.

[50-76]
Seven appearances from one nature. Like one face reflected in seven mirrors, each mirror claiming it sees the true face. The reflection is accurate. The claiming is confusion. The face was never in the mirror.

[65-76]
Second: demonstrating that the seven bases that fall into conceptual extremes are faulty. Like blind men describing an elephant before them, each grasping only a part. When proponents hold tenets by fixating on one limited aspect of awareness as the complete realization, each establishing their acceptance deeply as the whole truth, they become the blind men arguing in the marketplace. Each is partially correct. Each is completely wrong.

[65-76]
Stop. Look. Know.

[75-76]
The refutation is not destruction. It is widening the prison walls until they become space. Spontaneous presence does not need defense. Primordial purity does not need proof. Certainty and uncertainty are both thoughts. The basis is prior to thought. Rest there.

[1-76]
Between the seven positions and the recognition that transcends all positions, Longchenpa weaves the path. Not rejecting the seven. Not clinging to any. The seven are training wheels. Eventually you ride without them. The ground remains, whether described seven ways or not at all.

[10547Before recognition dawned...er has nothing more to say. The seven bases have been described. The elephant has been touched. Now ride.

[1-76] The seven bases—primordially pure, spontaneously present, uncertain, certain, transformable, accepting, variegated—are seven aspects of one basis. Not seven separate truths. Seven ways awareness describes itself to itself. The basis is prior to all seven.

[1-76] One without learning... once clung to primordial purity! Thought it was the ultimate view. Then someone asked: "What about spontaneous presence?" Confused! Then realized: all seven are fingers. The moon is not fingered. The basis is not described.

[1-76] The seven bases are like seven colors of one light. Each color is complete. Each color is partial. Together they make white light. Separately they are rainbow. The basis is the light, not the colors.

[1-76] Seven bases! All descriptions! Look directly—can you find the basis? Can you grasp what is primordially pure? The basis is not pure! The basis is not impure! The basis is basis! AH!

[1-76] Three words. Seven. One. Stop. Seven descriptions. One basis. Stop counting. Rest in one.

[1-76] Therefore. Thus. Seven-fold classification of basis: 1) ka dag (primordial purity), 2) lhun grub (spontaneous presence), 3) ma nges (uncertain), 4) nges (certain), 5) 'gyur (transformable), 6) 'gyur med (unchanging), 7) sna tshogs (variegated). Seven phenomenological modes of one ground.

[1-76] The seven bases integrate into complete view. Each addresses specific confusion. Primordial purity dissolves grasping at achievement. Spontaneous presence dissolves grasping at effort. Uncertainty dissolves grasping at certainty. And so on. Integration means all seven are simultaneously present.

[1-76] The essence of all seven: they are awareness's own descriptions of itself. Awareness looking at awareness. The descriptions are accurate. The looking is complete. The essence is not in the description. The essence is the describing.

[1-76] Emaho! The seven bases! The seven views! What richness! This yogi dances through all seven—not clinging to any, not rejecting any. All seven are the dance!

[1-76] Thus the presentation of seven bases concludes. May all who encounter these words recognize that the basis is prior to all descriptions. May they rest in that recognition. Complete.

[1-76] This uneducated yogi...'s final word on seven bases: Don't be the blind man grasping the tail and calling it the whole elephant. Don't be the philosopher counting bases. Be the recognition that dissolves all seven. Complete.

[1-76] Final words. Seven. Bases. One. Stop. The teaching on seven bases is complete. The basis is one. You are complete. Rest. The end.
