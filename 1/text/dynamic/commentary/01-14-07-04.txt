The appearances arise from the nature as subtle rays of light—moving, wriggling, flickering, blazing like fire. They dawn within the circle of the bindu, the essential point. From that arise upright standing appearances and spokes radiating eastward and so forth.

The bindus of self-ripened result are three:
- The bindu of ripened lights
- The bindu of ripened pristine cognition  
- The bindu of ripened awareness

The bindu of ripened lights stands upright, extremely clear and unmixed like a rainbow. When accustomed to this, appearances are also seen as wisdom's display.

These three bindus represent the fruit of practice—not something created, but what is revealed when recognition dawns. The bindu of ripened lights manifests as the clear, vivid nature of all appearances when not mistaken for external objects. It abides upright, never falling into confusion, extremely clear like a rainbow—present but not solid, luminous but not substantial.

The bindu of ripened pristine cognition is the wisdom that recognizes the nature without reference point. It is not an experience to be attained but the recognition that has always been present.

The bindu of ripened awareness is the knowing quality of rigpa itself—the empty cognizance that is never separate from its own display.

[19435-19440]
Cut through now: Recognize immediately. The bindu of ripened lights is the nature itself—vividly empty, emptily vivid. This is wisdom's own light, not something to seek but recognition of what has always been present.

The nature is not elsewhere. It is this very awareness, never departed from, never to be attained. Diamond recognition indestructible immediacy. Pierces all gradualism. Now.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open—already complete, always was.
