Bardo liberation signs—the marks that appear on the body indicating past
purification. These are not superstitions. They are the natural manifestations of
channels opened, winds directed, bindu stabilized. The body becomes a text that
those with eyes can read.

Seven introductions: outer-clear arising expanse's wisdom display. Mirror-like
and the five wisdoms self-displaying. Connecting thread rays. Three bodies
connected. Clear light wisdom self-display. Powder mother-son measure. Person
wisdom inner-essence display.

[10233-10256]
From the Glorious Sky Without Body Blaze Tantra—as perfect Buddhas have body
signs and speech signs, so too vajra mind signs. These appear for those with
fortune of past purification. The signs are not randomly distributed. They
appear for those who prepared the ground.

Body signs: conch right swirl at forehead center, three-point frown vertical,
OM marks, lines, self-protruding marks. These indicate channels purified, winds
cleared, body prepared as vessel for liberation.

Speech signs: throat right and left, lotus petal eight, conch right coil, silk
tongue, hook, sword, AH letter marks. The throat channel is open, speech
empowerment received, the power of mantra stabilized.

Mind signs: heart center vajra, wheel, three-point complexion, jewel shape,
HUM letter. The heart center is awakened, the mind essence recognized, the
basis of liberation prepared.

This old fool has seen bodies with signs and without signs. Some with marks
were liberated. Some without marks were liberated. The signs are not guarantees.
They are indications, like weather signs before rain. Useful, but not absolute.

The signs arise because of suitability—the base, body-speech-mind exist
naturally, and through past purification, they manifest. Even those from lower
backgrounds, even butchers and tradespeople, can have these signs if they
purified in past lives.

[10322-10350]
Second, thigle and body introduction seven: thigle of five wisdoms' display,
metal bowl essence thigle, cloth wisdom light display, swirling water first
intermediate state display, peacock mirror meditation, staff metal bowl great
bliss Brahma's door display, thigle nine stacked introduction.

Each is a doorway. Each shows a different aspect of the intermediate state.
The thigle is the bindu, the concentrated drop of luminosity. The metal bowl
reflects the nature of appearance. The cloth shows how wisdom wraps around
itself. The swirling water shows the first bardo visions. The peacock mirror
shows how poison transforms into beauty.

[10351-10400]
Expanse introduction five: wisdom wind moved expanse display. Five families
cloth display. Expanse's ornament net and half-net hanging palace. Window four
directions center five rigpa five display mirror held showing expanse body.
Vessel water-filled flower five heap similarly held showing expanse heap.

These require preparation: ganachakra offerings, feast materials, proper clothes,
clean dwelling place. Not because the expanse cares about cleanliness, but
because the mind that perceives the expanse is affected by conditions.

[10401-10450]
From Introduction Ornament Tantra: "Fortunate followers, for seeing own essence,
retreat place half-open, hole sun-rays possessing, clear showing mirror held,
five lights outer arising seen."

This is direct instruction for practice. The retreat place—half-open, not fully
closed, not fully open. The sun rays entering through a hole. The mirror held
clear. The five lights seen. Each element is precise, each condition supports
the vision.

Between the elaborate descriptions of signs and introductions and the simple
recognition of awareness, we find no contradiction. The signs are recognition's
footprints. Recognition is the source of signs. Without recognition, signs are
just marks on the body. With recognition, signs confirm what is already known.

Mountain hermit had no signs. No conch swirl, no lotus petals, no OM marks.
But when he died, rainbow light surrounded his body for three days. Signs
appear at death for those who recognized in life. Signs appear in life for
those who prepared in past lives. Both are valid. Both are complete.

[10501-10550]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: do not chase these signs! Do not examine
your body looking for marks! The signs appear naturally when recognition is
stable. Chasing them is like chasing your own shadow—futile and exhausting.
Rest in recognition. If signs come, let them come. If not, who cares?

[10551-10600]
Thus the teaching on bardo liberation signs concludes—not with certainty but
with recognition, not with guarantees but with preparation. The signs indicate
preparation. Recognition is the preparation. The signs are ornaments.
Recognition is the essence.

[10601-10650]
This old vagabond has seen practitioners obsess over signs. "Do I have the
conch swirl? Do I have the lotus marks?" They miss the point entirely. The signs
are side effects. Recognition is the medicine. Do not collect side effects while
ignoring the cure.

[10651-End]
Emaho! May all who encounter these teachings recognize their nature, with or
without signs. May those with signs use them as confirmation. May those
without signs trust recognition above all marks. May all be liberated in the
bardo or in this life, through recognition of what was never separate.

Three words. Signs. Recognition. Liberation. Hold these three, and all
introductions are complete. Forget these three, and even perfect marks will not
help. The choice is yours—and the choice itself is primordial wisdom's play.
