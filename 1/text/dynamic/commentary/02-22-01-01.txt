Rigpa itself youth frowning, hero itself powerful possessing shown. Half-body aspect bodhisattva abiding shown, half-body consort's self-face meets. Clear equal body called. Fortunate both ornaments well-ornamented, clear possessing eye mark each look, father and mother essence shown, wisdom held, equality jaw-joining meditation called.

[10491-10512]
"Extremely gathered these, example sign meaning three, natural abiding result obtained. Deity yoga entering, marks possessing meaning. Elaboration-free single meditation, these all's holding abandoned, ripening ripening path made, direct continuous abiding, essence self self-seen, others' effort what use? This itself familiarize." Thus spoken.

[10513-10537]
From Jewel Radiant Display: "Alas, spiritual son, after I completely parinirvana, five hundred dregs time, deceiving childish-natured ones, buddhas' doctrine example confidence time arises. Then this secret tantra arises. True rigpa itself cannot be symbolized. Naturally five lights self-established possessing, form reflection five lights shown also buddhahood not achieved." Is this not forbidding example introduction?

[10538-10562]
That is rigpa not direct meaning seen, conceptual holding, some say 'rigpa's example is like this'—sky, various elements, light, deity body symbolizing. Common vehicle general, outer inner secret some parts inferior nature only made, negative base rigpa kadag, thing own-characteristic grasping abandoning for spoken. Here Secret Heart Essence meaning symbolizing occasion, however many examples shown, no error place, no attachment place, direct seeing rigpas that assistance only introduction, yet essence, expanding, dissolving modes like crystal kadag zangthal alone above crystal pure symbolizing, thus correct with reasoning.

[10563-10584]
This much tantra there also symbolizing spoken: "Vajrasattva's symbol example, white color moon's hue," etc., example sign meaning three symbolizing rigpa, unborn unceased zangthal vast expanse showing. Then faculties according introduction, this practice guide possessing, no error place, no falling place, whispered transmission and blessing meeting, certainty and superimposition cutting, word meaning connection, buddha's dharma lineage place showing introduction supreme spoken. From Treasury of Supreme Vehicle: "Vajra place difficult introduction depending, symbolizing, twenty-first chapter."

[10585-10608]
Thus extensively shown practice sequence, now showing practitioner's signs certainty sequence, three: former life trained signs how now body speech mind abiding general showing, now path entered signs three doors display possessing arising mode particular explaining, intermediate state and later liberation delusion certainty signs secret summary. Rest in this understanding.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Emaho!

[10609-10633]
First has three: former body how trained three body speech mind signs, speech how habituated signs, mind how trained signs. First: former life body trained three body speech mind, interrupted now showing signs four: signs sequence, elements' appropriateness, if habituated result, if not habituated certainty not obtained.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. First: from Glorious Namkha Mepe Relic Blazing Great Tantra: "How complete buddhas' body signs and speech signs, likewise vajra mind signs, as previously arisen, here sentient beings' bodies these appear. To whom these appear, former trained fortunate one."

[10634-10657]
From former not ripened now time certain result, who achieves, to that person body signs and likewise speech, mind etc. signs arise. Man or woman forehead center right-coiling conch or trident-like vertical wrinkles, om marks, lines or self-rising. Speech trained signs throat right, woman's left eight-petaled lotus or right-coiling conch, or banner-like, or hook, or sword, ah mark lines or rising. Mind trained signs heart vajra, wheel, trident glow or jewel form, hum mark possessing.

[10658-10684]
Second, signs arising appropriateness: all beings base three body speech mind self-possessing, former habituated now shown. From that: "Butcher low-caste unfortunate too, base three body speech mind possessing, former habituated therefore, interrupted entered former three body speech mind signs these all also arise.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from." Third, habituated result obtaining: these signs possessing, this life effort quick three body speech mind liberation. Body signs possessing body now trained two lives vajra body obtained. Speech speech vajra two lives achieved. Mind habituated three achieved.

[10685-10708]
Signs and habituation result certainty knower: from Relic Blazing—"Who buddha body trained, that forehead expanse too, conch right-coiling or trident wrinkle vertical, likewise om mark lines or self-rising, to whom these arise person, formerly buddha body trained. This trained yogin, buddha body inseparable, confidence possessing own time, two lives obtained. This uninterrupted, meditation effort extremely important."

Emaho!

[10709-10732]
"All buddhas' speech too, formerly trained that person, fortunate possessing, that throat right left, eight-petaled lotus or conch right-coiling, likewise banner spread, hook or sword, ah mark lines or self-rising, to whom existing person, all buddhas' speech too this formerly trained, two lives speech one certainty result obtained. This too uninterrupted important, interrupted speech trained certainly obtained."

[10733-10755]
"All buddhas' mind too, formerly habituated person, that body these signs, whose heart place trident vajra vertical, likewise wheel four-spoked, three stages glow, or jewel form, hum mark, to whom arising person, buddhas' too mind this habituated, fortunate. This meditation effort made, uninterrupted three lives, buddha mind's mandala, buddha to without doubt." Thus.

[10756-10765]
Fourth, these signs possessing yet dharma not practiced: beginningless habitual patterns deep, sudden non-virtue arising near, karma's momentum forceful, merely former signs possessing, that not protecting later, former virtue slight and now various mixed karma, body signs possessing form realm, speech especially Brahma body, mind signs possessing asura god human birth. This is the treasury's heart.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation integrates ground, path, and result into a coherent framework for recognition.

======================================================================
[02-22-01-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
