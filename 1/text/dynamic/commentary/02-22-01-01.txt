Bardo liberation signs—the marks that appear on the body indicating past purification. These are not superstitions. They are the natural manifestations of channels opened, winds directed, bindu stabilized. The body becomes a text that those with eyes can read.

Seven introductions: outer-clear arising expanse's wisdom display. Mirror-like and the five wisdoms self-displaying. Connecting thread rays. Three bodies connected. Clear light wisdom self-display. Powder mother-son measure. Person wisdom inner-essence display.

From the Glorious Sky Without Body Blaze Tantra—as perfect Buddhas have body signs and speech signs, so too vajra mind signs. These appear for those with fortune of past purification. The signs are not randomly distributed. They appear for those who prepared the ground.

This traveler has wandered through charnel grounds where vultures leave only the white conch-swirl of thigh bones. That spiral—right-turning, unerring—marks every being who trained in previous lives. The signs are not decoration. They are the architecture of awakening written in flesh.

Body signs: conch right swirl at forehead center, three-point frown vertical, OM marks, lines, self-protruding marks. These indicate channels purified, winds cleared, body prepared as vessel for liberation. The conch swirling right shows the winds have been reversed and purified. The three-point frown indicates the three kayas are present in potential. The OM marks show connection to sacred speech. Self-protruding marks indicate natural ripening without force.

The conch is not mere symbol. It is the direction of prana reversed, the inner winds that normally scatter outward now gathered, spiraling inward toward the central channel. The rightward coil—clockwise when viewed from above—indicates mastery over the elements. Leftward would indicate obstruction, demonic influence, the path of regress.

Patrul Rinpoche's direct instruction: Don't look for these marks with anxiety. Don't examine your forehead in mirrors hoping to find validation. The signs appear for those who practiced, not for those who seek confirmation. Practice without concern for marks. Marks appear for practitioners, not for seekers of marks.

A meditator has seen bodies with signs and without signs. Some with marks were liberated. Some without marks were liberated. The signs are not guarantees. They are indications, like weather signs before rain. Useful, but not absolute. Do not be attached to signs. Do not reject them either. They are helpful pointers on the path.

Mountain hermit watched the glacier retreat each summer, exposing marks in the moraine—lines of ancient rock, spirals of sediment, the OM-shaped tarn where ice had carved the mountain. "These are signs," he said, "but the glacier doesn't care about them. It melts or it grows according to causes and conditions. Practice is the glacier. Signs are the exposed rock."

The signs arise because of suitability—the base, body-speech-mind exist naturally.
through past purification, they manifest. Even those from lower backgrounds, even butchers and tradespeople, can have these signs if they purified in past lives. The base is pure from the beginning. Past practice makes it visible, like clouds parting to reveal the sun that was always there.

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: I met a butcher in Lhasa market who had the conch swirl clear as day on his forehead. He didn't know what it meant. I didn't tell him. Why burden him with the knowledge of past practice when present life keeps him occupied? The signs don't care whether you recognize them. They simply indicate what is.

Fourth, even with these signs, if Dharma is not practiced, beginningless accumulations of karma, proximate non-virtue.
forceful karmic momentum arise. Simply having previous signs does not protect one. In future lives, mixed with various present actions, those with body signs take form body births, speech signs take Brahma realms, mind signs take asura births.

From the same source: "From this, obstacles arise, results are not obtained. From mind, disturbed abodes result. From body likewise, form realm gods. From speech, Brahma's abodes."

In this manner: The signs without practice lead to higher realms, not liberation. Like seeds that sprout but bear no fruit because they were not tended. The potential is there, but realization requires continuous effort. Do not be complacent. Do not think signs alone will save you.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: You have the marks? Good. Now forget them. They mean nothing if you don't practice. I have seen form realm gods with every mark who remain trapped in cyclic existence for eons. I have seen dogs with no marks who recognized their nature in a single moment. The marks are irrelevant to liberation. Practice is everything.

Second, how speech habits produce three present signs: when signs appear, if one diligently practices the yoga of three kayas, liberation is obtained in two lifetimes. Otherwise, not obtained. The speech signs indicate that in past lives, one trained in sacred speech, recited mantras, practiced sacred sounds, received empowerments.

Signs and their nature—from the same source: "Thus for sentient beings too, as signs of previously training and purifying in Buddha's three kayas, thus they arise, o dakini."

For whoever trained in Buddha's kayas, their words are powerful. Even cut, they do not change. They become this, having fortune. In one day, a thousand verses or four hundred verses' meaning appears in their mind. Whatever is spoken benefits others. Their speech has power.

This one trained previously in the kayas. For whoever trained in all Buddhas' speech, their voice is like Brahma's melody, pleasing to all ears. Even a thousand verses in one day are grasped by mind.
all beings become like servants. Their speech cannot be cut or altered. What they say comes to pass. This is the power of past training manifesting now.

Essence holder's spacious instruction: The lotus at the throat—eight-petaled, unfolding—indicates the transformation of the eight consciousnesses into wisdom. Don't intellectualize this. Feel it. When you speak, does your speech carry power? Does it benefit beings? This is the sign that matters, not the visual mark.

Third, mind signs appearing in the present—if practiced, liberation in mind's expanse in three lifetimes. From the same source: "Whichever sentient being has these signs in mind, they trained in Buddhas' three kayas, I have shown. Unlearned meditation self-flows, mind naturally finds ease."

This one trained previously in kayas. Intentionally dharmas appear to mind, seeing objects never seen before, understanding words of Dharma never heard before. This one trained previously in Buddha's speech, o dakini.

Always dwelling alone, without fearful mind toward anything, wandering in mountains and forests—this one trained previously in mind, o dakini.

Thus for whoever has these signs, if truth is practiced without obstacles, undoubtedly will become Buddha in three lifetimes. The signs accelerate the path but do not complete it. Practice completes it.

Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: The vajra at the heart, the wheel, the three-point mark, the jewel shape, the HUM letter—all these appear in those who trained before. But here's the secret: everyone has trained before. Everyone has these marks potentially. The difference is only whether they've ripened to visibility. Don't feel special if you have them. Don't feel deficient if you don't. Practice ripens what is latent.

These signs naturally dwell in body, speech.
mind from the beginning, clarified by past training. Not having reached the end of that, becoming obstacles, they appear in this life. The signs are like buds on a tree—evidence of past growth, promise of future fruit, but requiring present care to mature into full realization.

Therefore. The signs are confirmations of past training, not guarantees of future liberation. Like finding old seeds in a field—they indicate the field was cultivated, but you must still plant and water to harvest. The potential must be actualized through present practice.

Do not be proud when signs appear. Do not despair when they do not. Practice is the only sign that matters. The body with marks that does not practice is like a beautiful vase that holds no water. The body without marks that practices continuously is like a simple cup that holds nectar. Which would you rather have?

Between the appearance of signs and the reality of liberation, we find the middle way. Signs are helpful indicators, not absolute proof. They show potential, not accomplishment. Like a good astrological chart—favorable, but you must still live your life skillfully to benefit from the good fortune.

Mountain hermit had all three signs—conch swirl on his forehead, lotus at throat, vajra at heart. "I am a realized being," he thought.
stopped practicing. He was reborn in form realms, signs intact, liberation distant. Another had no visible marks, practiced continuously.
woke up in this very life. Signs point, walking liberates. The map is not the territory.

The signs manifest through suitability—the base exists naturally.
through past purification they become visible. Even in lower backgrounds, even among those society deems unworthy, these signs appear for those who trained in previous lives. The butcher, the prostitute, the lowest caste—all can bear these marks. Purity is not social status. It is recognition.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why look for marks on the body when the nature of mind is already liberated? The signs you seek externally are the awareness within. Stop examining your forehead in the mirror. Start examining the mind that looks. Cut through this obsession with signs! Liberation is not written on the skin but realized in the mind.

A friend tells you: I once met a master who had every mark described in the tantras. He showed me his forehead, his throat, his heart. "See?" he said. "I am realized." I left him and found a shepherd with no marks who asked me, "What is mind?" I couldn't answer. He laughed and walked away. Who was realized? The one with marks who sought validation, or the one without marks who asked the essential question?

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you cook rice, while you walk the path, these signs may or may not appear. What matters is the continuous practice, not the marks on your skin. Daily life is the real field of liberation. The recognition while washing dishes matters more than any conch swirl. The mindfulness while sweeping matters more than any lotus mark.

The glacial lake doesn't know it carries the reflection of the mountain. The reflection appears because conditions are suitable—clear water, no wind, proper angle. The lake doesn't try to hold the reflection. The mountain doesn't try to be reflected. Natural arising, natural presence. Signs are like this.

Essence holder's spacious instruction: rest in the view. The signs come and go like clouds in the sky. The sky remains unchanged. Recognition is the only sign that truly matters. Everything else is decoration on the mandala of your true nature. Rest without grasping, without rejecting. This is the essential point.

Between the elaborate descriptions of marks and the direct recognition of mind's nature, we find the practical path. Use the signs as encouragement if they appear. Don't chase them if they don't. Practice with whatever arises. This is the instruction.

Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: you want signs? Look in the mirror right now. The face you see is the Buddha's face. The body you inhabit is the mandala. Stop looking for special marks and symbols. Wake up completely.
every mark becomes a liberation sign, every moment becomes the bardo of Dharmata. The whole world is your sign.

The hot spring bubbles up from deep within the earth, bringing minerals to the surface, forming terraces of colored stone. Is the spring showing off? Is it trying to prove its depth? No. It simply flows. The terraces form naturally. Signs are like this—natural manifestations of inner purification, not achievements to display.

Final instruction on past-purification signs: signs are helpful but not necessary. Practice is necessary. Do not wait for signs to practice. Do not stop practicing when signs appear. The path continues until recognition is stable in all circumstances, signs or no signs. This is the essential point of bardo liberation signs. Practice is the only true sign of realization.

Patrul Rinpoche's summary: The Treasury gives these signs not to create attachment to marks, but to encourage those who have them to practice diligently, and to reassure those who don't that liberation is still possible. The path is open to all. The signs are merely weather vanes showing which way the wind of past practice blew. They don't determine the future. Your present practice does.

SECOND SECTION: PRESENT PRACTICE SIGNS

Now the text turns to signs that appear for those currently practicing the path—those who have entered the dharma and are actively training. These are different from past-purification signs. They indicate present progress, present obstacles, present possibilities.

There are two categories: common signs that can appear to anyone, including those on common vehicles and even animals; and uncommon supreme secret path signs that appear specifically to those practicing dzogchen.

First, the common signs—fifty marks of uncertainty. These can appear to anyone who has trained in dharma, even without proper understanding. They are called "uncertain" because their presence doesn't guarantee liberation. Like weather signs that sometimes indicate rain but sometimes don't.

The fifty uncertain signs: skill in debate but self-satisfied; knowing others' thoughts in fragments; seeing divine forms; body hairs standing up; speech power manifesting; receiving prophecies from others; cessation of conceptual thought; extended calm abiding; body heat in patches; seeing worldly spirits' forms; composing dharma and remembering words; awareness radiating infinitely; mind becoming light; senses becoming clear; extraordinary bliss; sleeplessness; special joy; awareness becoming lucid; always wanting to sing; wanting to wander; eyes not attached to others' movements; quick footsteps; mind flying like wind; awareness always changing; mind not settling; examining words critically; hearing dakini speech; dwelling with borderland people with experiences; heart always trembling; body hairs standing up; letters naturally appearing in nail centers; teeth regenerating in old age; showing blessings to others' bodies; leaping into space from cross-legged posture; wheels in palms; net-like connections between toes; light emanating from mouth; awareness of movements and stillness; knowing animal bodies; subtle relics falling from limbs; seeing gods and asuras fighting; knowing scripts not previously learned; hearing sounds from eyes; speaking with non-humans; binding external winds; holding sun and moon; knowing times of others' elemental disturbances; sparks emanating from body; wondrous sounds from clapping hands.

One practitioner has seen many of these signs. Some practitioners develop heat in meditation—tummo manifesting. Some begin to know others' thoughts. Some see forms, hear sounds, develop powers. These are all side effects, not the main practice. They indicate progress in channels and winds, but not necessarily realization of the view.

Patrul Rinpoche warns: Don't be seduced by these signs. They are like flowers growing along the path—beautiful, but not the destination. Some practitioners develop siddhis but remain deluded about the nature of mind. Some gain powers but increase their ego. Watch carefully.

Mountain hermit's observation: The fifty signs are like fifty different cloud formations. Some indicate weather changes. Some are just clouds. You can't be certain. That's why they're called uncertain signs. They show something is happening in practice, but not necessarily what.

Sixty-six dream signs indicating uncertainty: always teaching dharma in dreams; hearing; reading; holding; meditating; seeing divine forms; stupas; palaces; receiving prophecies; sitting on lion thrones; seeing various lands never seen before; seeing shravakas and bodhisattvas; climbing crystal stupas; climbing golden ladders; meditating in snowy valleys; flying in space seeing buddha-fields; riding lions to the ten directions; striking others with crystal spears; liberating beings from lower realms; crossing the ocean of samsara; dreams of changing bodies; seeing Buddha's face; finding jewel treasures; leading six realms to refuge; praying for cessation of three lower realms; seeing four continents; receiving prophecies from lamas and abbots; seeing three kayas; dreaming of knowing all dharmas; dreaming of reaching the center of the central mountain; dreaming of becoming Buddha; dreaming of steering the six migrations; limbs becoming jewel stupas; body emanating Buddha forms; being pulled from the three realms; golden bow and arrow; Buddha seated on top of head; body becoming zangthal; samsara ceasing; coronation as king; defeating demons; purifying body; hearing "the four rivers of birth, aging, sickness, death have ceased"; emanating as bodhisattva; realizing ineffable reality; emanating many bodies; gathering beings with speech; seeing mind's characteristics; seeing divine realms; dwelling on top of golden divine palace; hearing Buddha's speech; seeing form; realizing mind intention; flying in space holding two golden umbrellas; gods and asuras prostrating; moving among jewel mountains; rain of texts; various dharma sounds in ears with self being honored by various music; being placed on jeweled throne with four legs by divine king and lifted into space; nagas raining jewels; intermediate state visions appearing in dreams; riding elephant being lifted by four strong men holding four legs into sky; leaping three times from golden wheel in space.

These dream signs from the Blaze Tantra commentary indicate progress but not certainty. Dreams are deceptive. They show what is possible, not what is accomplished. Some practitioners have magnificent dreams but no realization. Others have no special dreams but wake up completely.

Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: Dreams are the bardo of sleep. If you can recognize the dream as dream, that's practice. The content of the dream matters less than the recognition. A dream of flying to buddha-fields is no better than a dream of washing clothes if recognition is present in both.

Essence holder's instruction: Don't write down your dreams. Don't analyze them. Don't tell everyone about your special visions. Just recognize them as mind's display and continue practicing. The dream is not the point. Recognition is the point.

Obstacle signs: knowing various body emanations; light emanating from body; sounds arising wherever one goes; power entering others; gatherings forming; remembering elaborate words. These indicate obstacles arising for that person. At such times, sit in water mandala up to the navel with wooden plaque sixteen finger-widths inserted, anoint body with sandalwood oil, visualize external and internal objects as coarse—this definitely clears obstacles.

Demonic blessings producing emanation knowledge—examined, it appears as a second reflection. Wash body with dharani water, say PHAT, meditate on emptiness like space—this clears it.

When a practitioner thinks they have realized reality but haven't, joy-demon enters. Thinking everything is empty, becoming careless, claiming karma and results don't harm—this is demon. Flesh-eating dakinis giving prophecies; gatherings and such producing minor siddhis; dakinis conversing, formless sounds near ears explaining good and bad, teaching dharma; at times clairvoyance appearing with pride—all these are demons creating obstacles. Knowing this, abide in generation-completion or gather vast accumulations with prayers, meditate on emptiness to liberate.

Patrul Rinpoche's warning: The most dangerous demons are the ones that flatter you. "You are realized. You are special. You have signs." These demons wear the mask of Dharma. They speak in sacred language. They appear as dakinis. Test them. Do they increase your humility or your pride? Do they lead you to practice or to rest on your achievements?

From Natural Arising of Awareness: If one acts only with mouth-words without realizing depth, becoming mad-like, this is obstacle demon arising. Gather vast accumulations and practice. If mindfulness degenerates and forms are not seen, this is sign of not seeing luminosity, so reverse the three roots. If prophecy dakinis appear, this is experience examination, so rest in intention.

Prophecy dakinis are of two types: those who come under your power.
those under whose power you fall.

Under your power: all activities accomplished, deeds completed.

Method to bring dakinis under power: when prophecy dakinis appear to one practicing, if attachment and joy mind don't arise toward them, and if you don't hold them as true, this is called dakinis coming under your power. They cannot show any meaning. Jnana dakinis purified of appearance don't appear in the world. Karma dakinis of flesh-eaters do appear in the world, wandering to practitioners' places, but because they don't appear clearly in form, they cannot liberate.

Under dakinis' power: you yourself hold the prophecy as true, always holding to the prophecy, performing conduct of non-attachment to body, claiming "result is beyond is-isn't extremes," holding to the prophecy—this is near demon creating obstacles. At such times, know demonic deception.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce instruction: The true dakini doesn't prophesy. She cuts through. She doesn't flatter. She destroys. If something comes praising you, promising siddhis, confirming your realization—demon. Run. If something comes criticizing, challenging, cutting through your certainty—possible friend. Examine carefully.

UNCOMMON SUPREME SECRET PATH SIGNS

Now the dzogchen-specific signs. These don't appear to common vehicle practitioners. They indicate progress in trekcho and thogal, mastery of clear light, stability in the view.

Three preliminary practice signs: mastery of the four elements' sounds; mastery of body-speech-mind opening the nose; mastery of awareness opening the nose separating samsara-nirvana.

From the Blaze Tantra on mastery of elements: whoever is familiar with elements' sounds is unharmed by arising elements, likewise not burned by fire, not drowned or carried by water, feet don't touch ground but can walk in space, not chilled or moved by wind. Whoever has these is familiar with four elements' sounds.

This is not metaphor. The practitioner becomes harmonious with elements. Fire doesn't burn because the inner fire is balanced. Water doesn't drown because the inner water is stabilized. This comes from completion of the three-kaya yoga, from purification of channels and winds, from recognition of the elements as wisdom display.

Body-speech-mind mastery measure: instantly knowing visible and invisible beings, because not taking six realms' forms, knowing six migrations' sounds, cutting through six migrations' mindstreams, therefore knowing all their thoughts, because deluded thought is exhausted, therefore six clairvoyances arise, six migrations' appearances abide in their own nature, cutting through future birth continuum—thus these signs arise for one who has cut.

Awareness nose-opening separating samsara-nirvana signs: from the same source—body's attachment reversed, therefore deluded attachment continuum cut, no attachment to own body, walking in space, likewise able to enter earth, knowing thinkable and unthinkable meanings, dharma speech arising from mouth—whoever has these, body speech and mind are liberated from samsara's conceptual binding, what bound all is liberated, later body speech mind connection cut.

These are advanced signs indicating genuine stability in the view, not just intellectual understanding. The body literally becomes non-solid, the speech becomes oracle-like, the mind knows others' thoughts. But these too are signs, not results. The result is liberation, not powers.

MAIN PRACTICE SIGNS

First, common view-meditation signs generally shown: view liberated from extremes, trained like space, can go to space, circumambulate Jambudvipa in an instant, looking at solid things causes them to melt.

Meditation natural clarity self-flowing—trained in samadhi, miraculous body speech mind signs arise. From the Blaze Tantra: signs of familiarity with view for one with fortune arise thus: emptiness expands body and mind, like dakini in space, controlling wind therefore able to move through four winds like wind in six hundred moments, able to go throughout Jambudvipa. Because realizing self-mind as empty, whatever is looked at melts. This finds great confidence in view.

Signs of familiarity with meditation: no insects or creatures in body, because compassion for others' benefit is complete, because conceptual thought mindstream is empty, therefore body is like cotton wool, because rigpa is immortal and meaningful, body becomes like sixteen years old. Because dharmata dampness pervades mind, body and so forth, hairs become oily. Thus mind doesn't scatter, abides wherever placed, cannot enter deluded objects. This finds meditation, obtains Buddha in two lifetimes.

These signs indicate genuine meditation, not just sitting practice. The body becoming light, youthful, free from parasites—indicates the winds are purified, the bindus are stable, the channels are open. But again, signs, not results.

Mountain hermit's observation: I saw an old meditator whose body became soft as a child's, whose hair turned from white to black, who needed no food for months. Everyone said he was realized. He said, "I don't know. I just practice." That's the correct attitude. The signs appear. He noticed them but didn't attach. He continued practicing. Eventually he passed away sitting upright. Was he liberated? The signs suggest so. But only he knows.

SECOND, PARTICULAR EXPLANATION OF DIRECT CLEAR LIGHT SIGNS

Five categories: light, expanse, bindu, form, rigpa measure.

First, light: essence, definition, divisions, characteristics, results.

Essence of light: showing rigpa's energy.

Definition: because appearing and clear, it is light.

Divisions: self-appearing daylight-holding light, wisdom five's own energy; and familiarity light appearing from direct experience exceeding measure, expanding higher than experience, reaching measure—two types.

Characteristics: self-clearing without depending on other illuminators.

Result: becomes condition for buddhahood in dharmadhatu inconceivable state.

Familiarizing with such light, deluded appearances liberate into clear light, special body speech signs appear. From the Blaze Tantra: whoever is familiar with light, in their own perceived domain, earth water fire wind—four elements' appearances self-dissolve, gradually enjoying five colors. Unseparated from this sign, in others' perceived domain, like madman, unobstructed to anything, without attachment to anything, zangthal in mountains and rocks, likewise seen entering earth depths, likewise zangthal in waters, body without clothes, naked, unobstructed to anything, desire for food and so forth self-liberated—this realizes appearances themselves, elements self-dissolve, contaminated aggregates become invisible, result obtained without doubt.

External visionary signs accordingly also arise internally in awareness. From Natural Arising: ride the unchanging rigpa horse, always look at true light, teacher's words indicate great meaning, king of awareness seeing measure, this should be correctly held. Dwelling alone obtains bliss, because own-appearance arises as companion, harmonizing with others' minds, because not separating from that, attachment and clinging become without, because going to own ground, doesn't compete with anyone, because obtaining own meaning, like cotton wool leaves, because insects and creatures clear.

This describes genuine clear light practice—stable luminosity, recognition of own-appearance, harmony with beings, non-attachment, natural conduct.

Patrul Rinpoche's direct pointing: All these signs are nice. They indicate progress. But don't mistake them for the goal. The goal is recognition of your nature, liberation from samsara, benefit for beings. Signs are side effects. Some practitioners have many signs but little realization. Some have few signs but deep realization. Judge by the stability of recognition, not by the spectacular nature of signs.

The Treasury of Supreme Vehicle presents these signs comprehensively so that practitioners know what to expect, what to avoid, what to cultivate. But the essential point remains: practice continuously, recognize your nature, don't be seduced by experiences. This is the heart instruction.

Singing yogi's final song:

Signs appear like clouds in the sky
Some white and fluffy, some dark with rain
The sky doesn't care—it remains the sky
Practice is the sky, signs are the clouds

Marks on the body, powers in the mind
Dreams of flying, light in the dark
Nice stories to tell, but don't mistake
The finger pointing for the moon it shows

Two lifetimes, three lifetimes, what's the count?
Practice now, recognition now, liberation now
Signs confirm the path but don't complete it
Only recognition completes, only practice ripens

A practitioner has sung enough
The signs are written, the meanings clear
What remains? Your practice. Your recognition.
The bardo awaits no one's preparation.

Essence holder's spacious conclusion: Rest in the view beyond signs. The signs appear for those who need confirmation, those who doubt, those who seek encouragement. When recognition is stable, signs don't matter. You don't look for them. You don't avoid them. They simply are—or aren't. The sky doesn't check for clouds. The ocean doesn't measure its waves. Rest in naturalness.

Lion-faced dakini's parting roar: Cut through! All these signs, all these categories, all these lists—cut through them! The nature of mind is not found in marks on the body. Liberation is not achieved through dreams of flying. Recognition is immediate, direct, beyond all signs. Stop collecting signs. Start recognizing.

COMPLETE PRACTICAL SUMMARY:

The bardo liberation signs text presents three main categories:

1. Past purification signs: marks on body, speech, mind indicating previous training. Useful for encouragement, not guarantees. Can appear to anyone, even animals. Don't attach to them.

2. Present practice common signs: fifty uncertain marks, sixty-six dream signs, obstacle signs, dakini prophecies. Indicate progress but not certainty. Many traps here—demons in dharma form, powers without realization, false confidence.

3. Dzogchen-specific signs: preliminary practice signs, view-meditation signs, direct clear light signs. Indicate genuine progress in the path. But still signs, not results. Continue practicing.

TESTING THE SIGNS:

How to know if signs are genuine progress or demonic deception?

Genuine signs:
- Increase humility, not pride
- Lead to more practice, not less
- Benefit others spontaneously
- Don't need to be displayed or discussed
- Remain stable in all circumstances

Demonic signs:
- Increase pride and specialness
- Lead to complacency
- Seek recognition from others
- Need constant validation
- Disappear when difficulties arise

Patrul Rinpoche's final advice: Test everything. Signs that appear in retreat may disappear in the marketplace. Signs that come in meditation may vanish in conflict. Only stable recognition endures. Cultivate that, not the signs.

THE ULTIMATE SIGN:

Beyond all fifty uncertain signs. Beyond all sixty-six dream signs. Beyond all obstacle signs and dakini prophecies. Beyond all preliminary and main practice signs. There is one sign that matters: the recognition of your true nature, stable in all circumstances, unshaken by pleasure or pain, present in meditation and daily life.

This is the only sign that indicates certain liberation. All others are helpful but uncertain. This one sign—recognition—is the complete accomplishment.

How to develop it? Not by seeking signs. By continuous practice of the path. By cutting through conceptual mind. By resting in the view. By integrating practice into daily life. By serving the guru and sangha. By accumulating merit and wisdom. By purifying obscurations.

The signs will appear or they won't. Recognition is the essential point.

Mountain hermit's deathbed teaching: I have practiced for sixty years. I have had signs—heat, clarity, dreams, visions. I have had periods of no signs—dullness, confusion, ordinary life. What did I learn? The signs don't matter. The practice does. Keep practicing. Whether signs appear or not, keep practicing. That is the whole teaching.

In my travels adds: I have traveled from monastery to monastery, from master to master, seeking the signs of realization. I found them everywhere and nowhere. The realized master had no special marks. The marked practitioner was deluded. The simple practitioner without marks woke up completely.

Stop looking for signs. Start looking at your mind. That is the introduction. That is the path. That is the result.

Sky-dancer's playful closing: You read all this, searching for the secret? Here it is: there is no secret. The signs are described to help you, not to limit you. The path is open. Recognition is available. Liberation is possible. What are you waiting for? A special mark? A confirming dream? Cut through!

The Treasury of Supreme Vehicle is vast. The signs are many. But the recognition is one. Rest in that oneness.

Om ah hum. The completion. The perfection. The natural liberation.

This student has said everything about bardo liberation signs. The body signs, the speech signs, the mind signs, the uncertain signs, the dream signs, the obstacle signs, the dakini prophecies, the preliminary signs, the main practice signs, the clear light signs—all explained.

May all who encounter these words recognize that the true sign is the awareness that encounters. May all beings be liberated in the Dharmakaya that was never bound. May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate the path for all.

The commentary is complete. The teaching is given. What remains? Your practice. Your recognition. Your liberation.

Look. See. Rest.

Complete.

Patrul Rinpoche's final whisper: All these categories, all these lists, all these signs—they are medicine for specific diseases. When the disease is cured, stop taking medicine. When recognition is stable, forget all signs. Rest in natural awareness. This is the ultimate instruction.

The mani wall stands by the mountain path. Thousands of stones carved with mantra, placed by thousands of hands. Pilgrims add more stones, believing each one accumulates merit. But the wall itself doesn't care. It simply is. Signs are like this—accumulations of practice, visible results of invisible training. Useful, but not the point. The point is liberation. The point is recognition. The point is awakening for the benefit of all beings.

Rest in that.
