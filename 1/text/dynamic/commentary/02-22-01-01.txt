Bardo liberation signs—the marks that appear on the body indicating past purification. These are not superstitions. They are the natural manifestations of channels opened, winds directed, bindu stabilized. The body becomes a text that those with eyes can read.

Seven introductions: outer-clear arising expanse's wisdom display. Mirror-like and the five wisdoms self-displaying. Connecting thread rays. Three bodies connected. Clear light wisdom self-display. Powder mother-son measure. Person wisdom inner-essence display.

From the Glorious Sky Without Body Blaze Tantra—as perfect Buddhas have body signs and speech signs, so too vajra mind signs. These appear for those with fortune of past purification. The signs are not randomly distributed. They appear for those who prepared the ground.

[10233-10256]
Body signs: conch right swirl at forehead center, three-point frown vertical, OM marks, lines, self-protruding marks. These indicate channels purified, winds cleared, body prepared as vessel for liberation. The conch swirling right shows the winds have been reversed and purified. The three-point frown indicates the three kayas are present in potential. The OM marks show connection to sacred speech. Self-protruding marks indicate natural ripening without force.

Speech signs: throat right and left, lotus petal eight, conch right coil, silk tongue, hook, sword, AH letter marks. The throat channel is open, speech empowerment received, the power of mantra stabilized. The eight-petaled lotus shows the eight consciousnesses transformed into wisdom. The silk tongue indicates speech that pleases all who hear. The hook shows the power to gather beings. The sword cuts through delusion.

Mind signs: heart center vajra, wheel, three-point complexion, jewel shape, HUM letter. The heart center is awakened, the mind essence recognized, the basis of liberation prepared. The vajra at the heart shows indestructible nature recognized. The wheel indicates the Dharma will turn effortlessly. The three-point mark shows mastery of body, speech, and mind. The jewel shape indicates the wish-fulfilling nature of realized mind.

This old fool has seen bodies with signs and without signs. Some with marks were liberated. Some without marks were liberated. The signs are not guarantees. They are indications, like weather signs before rain. Useful, but not absolute. Do not be attached to signs. Do not reject them either. They are helpful pointers on the path.

The signs arise because of suitability—the base, body-speech-mind exist naturally, and through past purification, they manifest. Even those from lower backgrounds, even butchers and tradespeople, can have these signs if they purified in past lives. The base is pure from the beginning. Past practice makes it visible, like clouds parting to reveal the sun that was always there.

[10322-10338]
Fourth, even with these signs, if Dharma is not practiced, beginningless accumulations of karma, proximate non-virtue, and forceful karmic momentum arise. Simply having previous signs does not protect one. In future lives, mixed with various present actions, those with body signs take form body births, speech signs take Brahma realms, mind signs take asura births.

From the same source: "From this, obstacles arise, results are not obtained. From mind, disturbed abodes result. From body likewise, form realm gods. From speech, Brahma's abodes."

Therefore. The signs without practice lead to higher realms, not liberation. Like seeds that sprout but bear no fruit because they were not tended. The potential is there, but realization requires continuous effort. Do not be complacent. Do not think signs alone will save you.

[10339-10383]
Second, how speech habits produce three present signs: when signs appear, if one diligently practices the yoga of three kayas, liberation is obtained in two lifetimes. Otherwise, not obtained. The speech signs indicate that in past lives, one trained in sacred speech, recited mantras, practiced sacred sounds, received empowerments.

Signs and their nature—from the same source: "Thus for sentient beings too, as signs of previously training and purifying in Buddha's three kayas, thus they arise, o dakini."

For whoever trained in Buddha's kayas, their words are powerful. Even cut, they do not change. They become this, having fortune. In one day, a thousand verses or four hundred verses' meaning appears in their mind. Whatever is spoken benefits others. Their speech has power.

This one trained previously in the kayas. For whoever trained in all Buddhas' speech, their voice is like Brahma's melody, pleasing to all ears. Even a thousand verses in one day are grasped by mind, and all beings become like servants. Their speech cannot be cut or altered. What they say comes to pass. This is the power of past training manifesting now.

[10384-10407]
Third, mind signs appearing in the present—if practiced, liberation in mind's expanse in three lifetimes. From the same source: "Whichever sentient being has these signs in mind, they trained in Buddhas' three kayas, I have shown. Unlearned meditation self-flows, mind naturally finds ease."

This one trained previously in kayas. Intentionally dharmas appear to mind, seeing objects never seen before, understanding words of Dharma never heard before. This one trained previously in Buddha's speech, o dakini.

Always dwelling alone, without fearful mind toward anything, wandering in mountains and forests—this one trained previously in mind, o dakini.

Thus for whoever has these signs, if truth is practiced without obstacles, undoubtedly will become Buddha in three lifetimes. The signs accelerate the path but do not complete it. Practice completes it.

[10408-10450]
These signs naturally dwell in body, speech, and mind from the beginning, clarified by past training. Not having reached the end of that, becoming obstacles, they appear in this life. The signs are like buds on a tree—evidence of past growth, promise of future fruit, but requiring present care to mature into full realization.

Therefore. The signs are confirmations of past training, not guarantees of future liberation. Like finding old seeds in a field—they indicate the field was cultivated, but you must still plant and water to harvest. The potential must be actualized through present practice.

Do not be proud when signs appear. Do not despair when they do not. Practice is the only sign that matters. The body with marks that does not practice is like a beautiful vase that holds no water. The body without marks that practices continuously is like a simple cup that holds nectar. Which would you rather have?

[10451-10500]
Between the appearance of signs and the reality of liberation, we find the middle way. Signs are helpful indicators, not absolute proof. They show potential, not accomplishment. Like a good astrological chart—favorable, but you must still live your life skillfully to benefit from the good fortune.

Mountain hermit had all three signs—conch swirl on his forehead, lotus at throat, vajra at heart. "I am a realized being," he thought, and stopped practicing. He was reborn in form realms, signs intact, liberation distant. Another had no visible marks, practiced continuously, and woke up in this very life. Signs point, walking liberates. The map is not the territory.

[10501-10550]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why look for marks on the body when the nature of mind is already liberated? The signs you seek externally are the awareness within. Stop examining your forehead in the mirror. Start examining the mind that looks. Cut through this obsession with signs! Liberation is not written on the skin but realized in the mind.

[10551-10600]
Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you cook rice, while you walk the path, these signs may or may not appear. What matters is the continuous practice, not the marks on your skin. Daily life is the real field of liberation. The recognition while washing dishes matters more than any conch swirl. The mindfulness while sweeping matters more than any lotus mark.

[10601-10650]
Essence holder's spacious instruction: rest in the view. The signs come and go like clouds in the sky. The sky remains unchanged. Recognition is the only sign that truly matters. Everything else is decoration on the mandala of your true nature. Rest without grasping, without rejecting. This is the essential point.

[10651-End]
Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: you want signs? Look in the mirror right now. The face you see is the Buddha's face. The body you inhabit is the mandala. Stop looking for special marks and symbols. Wake up completely, and every mark becomes a liberation sign, every moment becomes the bardo of Dharmata. The whole world is your sign.

Final instruction: signs are helpful but not necessary. Practice is necessary. Do not wait for signs to practice. Do not stop practicing when signs appear. The path continues until recognition is stable in all circumstances, signs or no signs. This is the essential point of bardo liberation signs. Practice is the only true sign of realization.
