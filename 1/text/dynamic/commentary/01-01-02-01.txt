[175-180]
The first word arises from no throat. The path shown to oneself—like a mountain revealing itself to the mountain. Samantabhadra offers the vajra to Samantabhadra. Who receives? Who gives? The snow on the peak does not know it is white.

[181-189]
Three words that shatter the temple: First Buddha. Before all Buddhas. This is not genealogy—this is the ground (gzhi) before ground. Some scholars build ladders to climb this mountain, rung by rung, arguing who came before whom. The ladder reaches nowhere. The mountain stands without support.

[190-205]
Therefore. Thus. The analysis proceeds. Five perfections multiplied by twelve emanations. Sixty. The mathematics of the impossible. Each field—Self-Nature Completely Arranged, Wind-Movement Arranged—names for what cannot be located. Like naming every wave in an ocean that has no shore.

[206-217]
This old practitioner once tried to map these realms with colored threads on a wooden frame. The threads tangled. The frame broke. I burned it and watched the smoke rise in the shape of a vajra. The Flower Ornament Sutra says what we cannot say. The Meeting of Father and Son—they bow to each other across a gap that was never there.

[218-224]
Lightning-Light, Jewel-Garland—names like ripples on a pond that no one threw a stone into. The offering of a golden vajra: what is given when there is no giver? What is received when the receiver is the offering itself? Thirty-six tantras from light-rays. The number is precise. The light is not.

[225-240]
Five Buddhas blazing. Not in space—space itself is their radiance. Vairochana of the great ocean, Akṣobhya unmoving, Ratnasambhava jewel-born. Directions are metaphors for aspects of what has no direction. The mandala does not exist in the palace. The palace exists in the mandala.

[241-256]
In Light-House, Completely Pure—an abode that is not a place. Self-Knowing Awareness King—ruler of no subjects. Unmoving, non-arising, non-abiding—these are not negations but descriptions of a ground so vast that movement is irrelevant. Like trying to describe stillness to a whirlwind.

[257-272]

[273-288]
Speech that cannot be spoken. Not silence—speech beyond the mechanics of throat and tongue. Self-arisen syllables that were never pronounced. Fresh, innate, natural, unfabricated—these words describe your own face before you were born. Do you remember?

[289-304]
Mind's samadhis named like storms: Lion-Display, Hero-Going, Wish-Fulfilling Jewel. But these are not achievements. They are what remains when achievement is recognized as a dream within a dream. The activities are not done. They shine as qualities shine—as light does not choose to illuminate.

[305-320]
From the lotus stem's protuberances, thirty-two realms layered like water reflecting moon. Each realm complete. Each Buddha complete. Each sentient being—if they knew it—complete. The perfume-water flows downward. The realms are not stacked. They interpenetrate like light through light.

[321-336]
Body's activities: appearing without nature, perfected in self-nature, liberated in self-appearance. This is not transformation. It is recognition that there was nothing to transform. From the thumb's gesture, the great ocean. From a single pore, infinite fields.

[337-352]
Speech's mystery: syllables entering father's face, emerging from mother's space. Not symbolism—the actual mechanism of how meaning arises from what has no meaning. Control of inexpressible sound. Enjoyment of markless dharma. You are doing it now. You have never stopped.

[353-368]
Mind's fourfold perfection: mirror-like, sameness, discriminating, action-accomplished. These are not wisdoms to acquire. They are the nature (rang bzhin) of what is already knowing. Samsara and nirvana made non-dual—not by effort but by resting in what was never divided.

[369-384]
Twelve emanations in twelve abodes. Tuṣita, Sahā, Heat-Moisture-Gathering—each a configuration of five perfections. Not history. Not mythology. The structure of how awakening shows itself when awakening looks for itself. The youth Supreme Light Unimaginable is closer than your next breath.

[385-400]
Three teachings for three capacities: body-taming, speech-taming, mind-taming. Each lasting five hundred five thousand years—not time but intensity of capacity. In Uddiyana, in Malaya, in Vajrāsana—the places are coordinates for states of recognition. The vajra in the ocean, the syllable in the sky.

[401-415]
Twelve teachers, twelve retinues, twelve dharmas—but one intention. Sound Thal-'gyur Tantra to the three baskets. From immeasurable lifespan to hundred years. The compression is not loss. It is concentration. Like squeezing an infinite sky into a single drop that contains the sky.

[416-430]
The Rig-pa-rang-shar-great tantra speaks: My precious jewel lost. Lost in the darkness-appearance interval. Lost so completely that only losing remains. Then—Tuṣita upper-chamber. Pure lotus. The jewel was never lost. The seeking was the jewel's radiance.

[431-445]

[446-460]
Emanation-body, complete-enjoyment, dharma-body—summary in words that fail beautifully. The succession transmitted by sign and by ear. Individual biography and great history. The teacher's descent manner well explained. But explanation is not understanding. Understanding is not realization. Realization is—what?

[404-461]
Stop here. Look back at what you have read. Every word a finger pointing. Every finger made of the same moon it indicates. The first chapter complete. The arising established. Now—where is the one who reads? Where is the path shown? Samantabhadra awaits your answer in the silence before the next word.
