[1-9]
The critics raise their voices: if primordial purity alone is the ground, how can saṃsāra exist? If spontaneous presence alone, why doesn't everyone recognize their liberation? These objections arise from the mind that divides what is indivisible. Like asking if wetness is in the water or the wave—neither, both, the question itself reveals confusion.

[1-552]
This entire section establishes the unsurpassed basis of Great Perfection. Through objections and responses, through elaborate description and exhaustive negation, it The name 'mountain'—the word is not the peak. what cannot be pointed to, describes what cannot be described, establishes what was never unestablished. The ground is primordially pure yet spontaneously present, empty yet aware, transcendent yet immanent.

—

[10-13]
First objection: if essence is exclusively primordially pure, saṃsāra would not exist as other than purity. Therefore sentient beings' delusion would be impossible—yet delusion appears. This seems to contradict the view. Second objection: if nature is merely unceasing display without primordial purity, everyone would be liberated without recognition—yet recognition is needed. Third: purity and display as separate substances in one ground would contradict each other.

—

[14-18]
The response unfolds like a lotus in morning sun: because essence is primordially pure in its empty nature, sentient beings do not ultimately exist in saṃsāra as real entities. Yet from the power of unceasing display as merely the play of the path, appearances arise without contradicting purity. The non-dual ground holds both aspects simultaneously—empty in essence, luminous in nature.

—

[19-25]
The dream analogy illuminates: when going to sleep, awareness's own face contains no dreams. Yet in sleep, horses and oxen appear to the dreamer. Does this contradict awareness's nature? Not at all. The dream appears yet is empty; emptiness appears as dream. Neither denies the other; neither contradicts the other. Primordial purity and unceasing display relate similarly.

—

[26-30]
Sentient beings appear to deluded perception, yet because essence is not established through mere play, they are primordially liberated from the beginning. Like horses and oxen appearing through mantra power to the eye—they appear conventionally yet are empty ultimately. When pure perception dawns, they are seen as liberation itself. No effort needed; they revert spontaneously like a ball thrown into space.

—

[31-36]
Conventional aspect: appearance as unceasing display with all qualities. Ultimate aspect: emptiness as primordially pure. These are not separate substances but two perspectives on one reality. Like being a vow-possessor and fully ordained—different descriptions, same person, no contradiction. Primordial purity and spontaneous presence are similarly non-contradictory aspects of the single ground.

—

[37-44]
From Klongdrukpa: "Because the essence itself is primordially pure from the first, sentient beings' saṃsāra is not reasonable as real existence. Because stains of non-recognition are primordially exhausted in the nature." The Teacher speaks to the great bodhisattva: purity is the ground, yet display plays without ceasing. The bodhisattva asks the natural question: if nature is spontaneously accomplished, aren't sentient beings already liberated?

—

[45-51]
The response: "These sentient beings, because the essence is primordially pure without stain, liberations also appear as play without contradiction." The apparent paradox dissolves: beings appear deluded conventionally, yet are liberated ultimately. Like ice appearing solid yet being water—both descriptions are true, neither contradicts the other.

—

[52-61]
The bodhisattva presses further: if essence is exclusively primordially pure, spontaneous presence would be unnecessary. Conversely, if all is unceasing display without purity, primordial purity would not manifest. The Teacher responds from beyond extremes: there are no words to express the ultimate, being free from words and sound entirely. Because nothing's essence is established as real, words cannot harm this nature.

—

[62-72]
Sentient beings, from self-grasping mind's object alone—variety, recollection, thought do not cease in delusion. Yet words do not harm the essence; there is no distinction in nature. Ultimate and conventional are terms, distinctions, designations. The reality they point to transcends them both, includes them both, is never separate from them.

—

[73-93]
The unsurpassed basis explained according to Great Perfection tradition. Common brief presentation of essential nature. Primordial purity and spontaneous presence are not sequential but simultaneous, not contradictory but complementary. Like a mirror and its reflections—the mirror's nature is clear, the reflections appear naturally. Neither produces the other; neither obstructs the other.

—

[94-114]
The critics' objections arise from conceptual mind attempting to grasp what transcends concepts. Mind divides; reality is whole. Mind analyzes; reality is immediate. Mind doubts; reality is certainty. The responses do not satisfy conceptual doubt but dissolve it—like light dispelling darkness, not by argument but by presence.

—

[115-163]
This entire exchange serves one purpose: to demonstrate that primordial purity and spontaneous presence are non-dual. Not two things merged into one, but one reality viewed from two angles. Empty yet appearing, pure yet displaying, transcendent yet immanent—these are not contradictions but the nature of mind itself.

—

[164-212]
Voice of the critic: I object! I demand clarity! Tell me—is it purity or display? The response comes not as answer but as laughter. The question assumes a duality that doesn't exist. Rest in the non-dual ground where questions dissolve like mist in morning sun.

—

[213-219]
The dream analogy deserves deeper reflection. When you dream, are the dream horses real? Conventionally yes—they appear, they function, they affect the dreamer. Ultimately no—they have no substance, no location, no independent existence. Yet the dreamer's nature is not harmed by their appearance. Similarly, saṃsāra appears yet is empty; emptiness appears as saṃsāra.

—

[220-224]
The ball thrown into space returns spontaneously—not through effort, not through external force, but through the nature of throwing and gravity. Similarly, deluded appearances return to their source naturally when the conditions that threw them forth cease. No new liberation is created; no old bondage existed. This is the meaning of primordial liberation.

—

[225-230]
Conventional and ultimate are not two realities but two truths about one reality. Conventionally, things appear, function, have effects. Ultimately, they are empty of inherent existence. Neither truth negates the other; each requires the other for completeness. Primordial purity speaks the ultimate truth; spontaneous presence speaks the conventional truth. Together they form the complete view.

—

[231-238]
The tantra verses carry the weight of realization. "Because the essence itself is primordially pure"—not purified, not becoming pure, but primordially, originally, always pure. "Stains of non-recognition are primordially exhausted"—the delusion that seems so real is itself empty, always was empty, could never be other than empty.

—

[239-245]
The bodhisattva's question is our question: if everything is already complete, why don't we see it? The answer: we do see it, constantly, in every moment. What we call delusion is simply completeness seen through the lens of incompleteness. Remove the lens—no, see through the lens—and completeness is revealed as never absent.

—

[246-255]
The Teacher's response from beyond extremes is not evasion but accuracy. Words cannot capture what transcends words; concepts cannot contain what transcends concepts. Yet words are used, concepts are employed—skillfully, provisionally, pointing beyond themselves. This is the method of the Great Perfection: using the conceptual to reach the non-conceptual, then letting both go.

—

[256-266]
Self-grasping mind creates the appearance of distinction where none exists. Variety seems to contradict unity; recollection seems to contradict presence; thought seems to contradict peace. Yet these are all play, all display, all the luminous empty nature showing its infinite faces. No contradiction, no opposition, no conflict—only the seamless flow of what is.

—

[267-315]
This section on the non-dual ground establishes the foundation for all that follows. Primordial purity is not negation; spontaneous presence is not affirmation. They are the two aspects of the single truth: mind is empty yet aware, aware yet empty. Empty of inherent existence, aware as natural luminosity. This is the unsurpassed basis of Great Perfection.

—

[316-364]
The objections and responses are not intellectual exercises but pointing instructions. Don't analyze them; follow where they point. The finger and moon are one in recognition. The distinction between purity and display dissolves in direct experience. This is not philosophy to understand but reality to recognize.

—

[359-364]
Dharma not exists as teaching, dharma as appearing separately not exists. Method not exists as path, wisdom itself also as thing not exists. Aggregates not exists as components and elements also not exists as bases. This is the exhaustive negation that leaves nothing to hold, nowhere to stand, nothing to achieve—yet awareness remains, luminous and free.

—

[365-413]
Voice of completion: I have raised the objections, offered the responses, cited the tantra. Now rest. The non-dual ground is not a conclusion to reach but a presence to recognize. It is here, now, always—primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated. This is the Great Perfection.

—

[414-433]
The unsurpassed basis explained in three parts: common brief presentation, elaborate explanation from essence and nature aspects, and meaning gathering establishing complete view. This structure serves different capacities—some need brevity, some need elaboration, some need synthesis. All are served; all are complete.

—

[434-453]
The beginning basis of all: essence primordially pure like a conch shell, unstained and unmixed. The nature spontaneously accomplished, not established as any limited thing. Inside the white mandala, subtle self-light as depth-clarity shining—though conditions don't exist, therefore not appearing outwardly to deluded perception. This is the ground as it is, before realization, before delusion, before any distinction.

—

[436-441]
Non-awareness not exists and confusion not exists as real. Mind not exists as substantial, intellect also as thing exists not. Enemy not exists as opposition, friend not exists as support, relative also not exists as connection. Afflictions not exists as obscurations and self-grasping not exists as root delusion. Going not exists as movement and coming not exists as arrival.

—

[454-473]
Outside, limitless, unobstructed, unbound—the youth vase body abides as the actual state of reality. Because essence is primordially pure, it is empty of inherent existence. Consequently, although no thing exists as real, subtle awareness with primordial resonance and self-light is not restricted by any condition, naturally self-possessed. This is the paradox: empty yet aware, non-existent yet luminous.

—

[474-493]
The nature spontaneously accomplished: abiding as the arise-base of all appearances everywhere, yet in its own face, outwardly clear, light and body and color with limiting marks are not appearing as real. Inside the vast expanse of essence primordially pure, the primordial resonance of nature spontaneously accomplished—depth-clarity, subtle self-light, together with pristine cognition. These are one in essence, different in aspect, not separate in manner.

—

[493-498]
Mind not exists as separate entity; intellect not exists as thinking; wisdom not exists as separate knowing; saṃsāra not exists as real cycle; nirvāṇa not exists as true peace; awareness itself also not exists as thing; pristine cognition appearance anything not exists as real. From Mu-tig-phreng-ba: "Natural expression abiding essence to primordial purity, Buddha not exists as separate and sentient beings not exists as other."

—

[494-513]
Light-clear supreme unceasing display, jewel casket of all qualities, youth vase body field of natural perfection. Essence, nature, compassion—three as one possession, supreme abiding as recognition. Because essence is empty, not established as limited thing. Because nature is clear, primordial resonance in appearance with own-face not abandoned. Because compassion is awareness that knows, pristine cognition expanding everywhere, arise-base of all not ceasing.

—

[514-533]
From the non-dual nature, the Auspicious Beautiful Tantra"Before realized Buddha ever arose as other, before unrealized sentient beings appeared as deluded, awareness self-arisen wisdom, unmoved from basis of all, condition-not-existing appearance of three bodies together abide." This is the ground before ground, the basis before basis, the nature of mind as it is.

—

[530-535]
That called great awareness expanse of mind itself. From Letterless Tantra: "To me self-arisen pristine cognition nature, analyzing object of scrutiny not exists. Before passed not exists as past; after arising not exists as future; now appearing anything not exists as present. Action not exists as real cause; latency not exists as hidden seed; non-awareness not exists as true delusion."

—

[533-552]
The Teacher, awareness pristine cognition itself, speaks this actual state: "O appearance great vast expanse this very mind, from unmoving Dharmakāya great beyond all change, abide as Buddha great not confused by any delusion. Essence body not ceasing abides from beginningless time." Not moving from own place, not shaken by any wind of concept.

—

[550-552]
That ultimate saṃsāra not is as real; nirvāṇa not is as other than mind; basis not is as ground to find; appearance not is as thing seen; darkness not is as obstruction; path not is as way to walk; traverse not as journey to make; not traverse not is as remaining; fruition not is as result to obtain; abandoned not is as renunciation; obtained not is as acquisition.
