[10782-10790]
The critics raise their voices: if primordial purity alone is the ground, how can saṃsāra exist? If spontaneous presence alone, why doesn't everyone recognize their liberation? These objections arise from the mind that divides what is indivisible. Like asking if wetness is in the water or the wave—neither, both, the question itself reveals confusion.

—

[10782-10785]
First objection: if essence is exclusively primordially pure, saṃsāra would not exist as other than purity. Therefore sentient beings' delusion would be impossible—yet delusion appears. This seems to contradict the view. Second objection: if nature is merely unceasing display without primordial purity, everyone would be liberated without recognition—yet recognition is needed. Third: purity and display as separate substances in one ground would contradict each other.

—

[10786-10790]
The response unfolds like a lotus in morning sun: because essence is primordially pure in its empty nature, sentient beings do not ultimately exist in saṃsāra as real entities. Yet from the power of unceasing display as merely the play of the path, appearances arise without contradicting purity. The non-dual ground holds both aspects simultaneously—empty in essence, luminous in nature.

—

[10788-10794]
The dream analogy illuminates: when going to sleep, awareness's own face contains no dreams. Yet in sleep, horses and oxen appear to the dreamer. Does this contradict awareness's nature? Not at all. The dream appears yet is empty; emptiness appears as dream. Neither denies the other; neither contradicts the other. Primordial purity and unceasing display relate similarly.

—

[10790-10794]
Sentient beings appear to deluded perception, yet because essence is not established through mere play, they are primordially liberated from the beginning. Like horses and oxen appearing through mantra power to the eye—they appear conventionally yet are empty ultimately. When pure perception dawns, they are seen as liberation itself. No effort needed; they revert spontaneously like a ball thrown into space.

—

[10795-10800]
Conventional aspect: appearance as unceasing display with all qualities. Ultimate aspect: emptiness as primordially pure. These are not separate substances but two perspectives on one reality. Like being a vow-possessor and fully ordained—different descriptions, same person, no contradiction. Primordial purity and spontaneous presence are similarly non-contradictory aspects of the single ground.

—

[10801-10808]
From Klongdrukpa: "Because the essence itself is primordially pure from the first, sentient beings' saṃsāra is not reasonable as real existence. Because stains of non-recognition are primordially exhausted in the nature." The Teacher speaks to the great bodhisattva: purity is the ground, yet display plays without ceasing. The bodhisattva asks the natural question: if nature is spontaneously accomplished, aren't sentient beings already liberated?

—

[10808-10814]
The response: "These sentient beings, because the essence is primordially pure without stain, liberations also appear as play without contradiction." The apparent paradox dissolves: beings appear deluded conventionally, yet are liberated ultimately. Like ice appearing solid yet being water—both descriptions are true, neither contradicts the other.

—

[10815-10824]
The bodhisattva presses further: if essence is exclusively primordially pure, spontaneous presence would be unnecessary. Conversely, if all is unceasing display without purity, primordial purity would not manifest. The Teacher responds from beyond extremes: there are no words to express the ultimate, being free from words and sound entirely. Because nothing's essence is established as real, words cannot harm this nature.

—

[10820-10830]
Sentient beings, from self-grasping mind's object alone—variety, recollection, thought do not cease in delusion. Yet words do not harm the essence; there is no distinction in nature. Ultimate and conventional are terms, distinctions, designations. The reality they point to transcends them both, includes them both, is never separate from them.

—

[10830-10850]
The unsurpassed basis explained according to Great Perfection tradition. Common brief presentation of essential nature. Primordial purity and spontaneous presence are not sequential but simultaneous, not contradictory but complementary. Like a mirror and its reflections—the mirror's nature is clear, the reflections appear naturally. Neither produces the other; neither obstructs the other.

—

[10830-10850]
The critics' objections arise from conceptual mind attempting to grasp what transcends concepts. Mind divides; reality is whole. Mind analyzes; reality is immediate. Mind doubts; reality is certainty. The responses do not satisfy conceptual doubt but dissolve it—like light dispelling darkness, not by argument but by presence.

—

[10782-10830]
This entire exchange serves one purpose: to demonstrate that primordial purity and spontaneous presence are non-dual. Not two things merged into one, but one reality viewed from two angles. Empty yet appearing, pure yet displaying, transcendent yet immanent—these are not contradictions but the nature of mind itself.

—

[10782-10830]
Voice of the critic: I object! I demand clarity! Tell me—is it purity or display? The response comes not as answer but as laughter. The question assumes a duality that doesn't exist. Rest in the non-dual ground where questions dissolve like mist in morning sun.

—

[10788-10794]
The dream analogy deserves deeper reflection. When you dream, are the dream horses real? Conventionally yes—they appear, they function, they affect the dreamer. Ultimately no—they have no substance, no location, no independent existence. Yet the dreamer's nature is not harmed by their appearance. Similarly, saṃsāra appears yet is empty; emptiness appears as saṃsāra.

—

[10790-10794]
The ball thrown into space returns spontaneously—not through effort, not through external force, but through the nature of throwing and gravity. Similarly, deluded appearances return to their source naturally when the conditions that threw them forth cease. No new liberation is created; no old bondage existed. This is the meaning of primordial liberation.

—

[10795-10800]
Conventional and ultimate are not two realities but two truths about one reality. Conventionally, things appear, function, have effects. Ultimately, they are empty of inherent existence. Neither truth negates the other; each requires the other for completeness. Primordial purity speaks the ultimate truth; spontaneous presence speaks the conventional truth. Together they form the complete view.

—

[10801-10808]
The tantra verses carry the weight of realization. "Because the essence itself is primordially pure"—not purified, not becoming pure, but primordially, originally, always pure. "Stains of non-recognition are primordially exhausted"—the delusion that seems so real is itself empty, always was empty, could never be other than empty.

—

[10808-10814]
The bodhisattva's question is our question: if everything is already complete, why don't we see it? The answer: we do see it, constantly, in every moment. What we call delusion is simply completeness seen through the lens of incompleteness. Remove the lens—no, see through the lens—and completeness is revealed as never absent.

—

[10815-10824]
The Teacher's response from beyond extremes is not evasion but accuracy. Words cannot capture what transcends words; concepts cannot contain what transcends concepts. Yet words are used, concepts are employed—skillfully, provisionally, pointing beyond themselves. This is the method of the Great Perfection: using the conceptual to reach the non-conceptual, then letting both go.

—

[10820-10830]
Self-grasping mind creates the appearance of distinction where none exists. Variety seems to contradict unity; recollection seems to contradict presence; thought seems to contradict peace. Yet these are all play, all display, all the luminous empty nature showing its infinite faces. No contradiction, no opposition, no conflict—only the seamless flow of what is.

—

[10782-10830]
This section on the non-dual ground establishes the foundation for all that follows. Primordial purity is not negation; spontaneous presence is not affirmation. They are the two aspects of the single truth: mind is empty yet aware, aware yet empty. Empty of inherent existence, aware as natural luminosity. This is the unsurpassed basis of Great Perfection.

—

[10782-10830]
The objections and responses are not intellectual exercises but pointing instructions. Don't analyze them; follow where they point. The finger and moon are one in recognition. The distinction between purity and display dissolves in direct experience. This is not philosophy to understand but reality to recognize.

—

[10782-10830]
Voice of completion: I have raised the objections, offered the responses, cited the tantra. Now rest. The non-dual ground is not a conclusion to reach but a presence to recognize. It is here, now, always—primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated. This is the Great Perfection.

—

[10831-10850]
The unsurpassed basis explained in three parts: common brief presentation, elaborate explanation from essence and nature aspects, and meaning gathering establishing complete view. This structure serves different capacities—some need brevity, some need elaboration, some need synthesis. All are served; all are complete.

—

[10831-10850]
The beginning basis of all: essence primordially pure like a conch shell, unstained and unmixed. The nature spontaneously accomplished, not established as any limited thing. Inside the white mandala, subtle self-light as depth-clarity shining—though conditions don't exist, therefore not appearing outwardly to deluded perception. This is the ground as it is, before realization, before delusion, before any distinction.

—

[10851-10870]
Outside, limitless, unobstructed, unbound—the youth vase body abides as the actual state of reality. Because essence is primordially pure, it is empty of inherent existence. Consequently, although no thing exists as real, subtle awareness with primordial resonance and self-light is not restricted by any condition, naturally self-possessed. This is the paradox: empty yet aware, non-existent yet luminous.

—

[10871-10890]
The nature spontaneously accomplished: abiding as the arise-base of all appearances everywhere, yet in its own face, outwardly clear, light and body and color with limiting marks are not appearing as real. Inside the vast expanse of essence primordially pure, the primordial resonance of nature spontaneously accomplished—depth-clarity, subtle self-light, together with pristine cognition. These are one in essence, different in aspect, not separate in manner.

—

[10891-10910]
Light-clear supreme unceasing display, jewel casket of all qualities, youth vase body field of natural perfection. Essence, nature, compassion—three as one possession, supreme abiding as recognition. Because essence is empty, not established as limited thing. Because nature is clear, primordial resonance in appearance with own-face not abandoned. Because compassion is awareness that knows, pristine cognition expanding everywhere, arise-base of all not ceasing.

—

[10911-10930]
From the non-dual nature, the Auspicious Beautiful Tantra"Before realized Buddha ever arose as other, before unrealized sentient beings appeared as deluded, awareness self-arisen wisdom, unmoved from basis of all, condition-not-existing appearance of three bodies together abide." This is the ground before ground, the basis before basis, the nature of mind as it is.

—

[10931-10950]
The Teacher, awareness pristine cognition itself, speaks this actual state: "O appearance great vast expanse this very mind, from unmoving Dharmakāya great beyond all change, abide as Buddha great not confused by any delusion. Essence body not ceasing abides from beginningless time." Not moving from own place, not shaken by any wind of concept.

—

[10951-10970]
All appearances complete at one time beyond sequence. All pristine cognition complete at one moment without effort. All bodies mature abiding in perfection. All light appearance unobscured clear luminosity. In the actual-state appearance of the basis itself, unobscured appearance-manner of essence nature compassion three, without interruption completely perfected, great beyond compare.

—

[10971-10990]
That great actual-state of essence abides like the vast body of reality itself—consequently, eyes, ears, nose as sense faculties are not abiding as substantially real entities. It abides like emptiness itself; yet falling into reified emptiness is not its abiding. In the great appearance manifesting like the five wisdom lights, dividing into limited, graspable color is not its mode.

—

[10991-11010]
In appearance without interruption or ceasing, connection like cause-and-effect is not established. In wisdom without center or periphery to see or grasp, no direction toward which to point is found. In appearance like space, not stained by any part or limit, dividing into conceptual category is not its nature. Appearance manifests like the spontaneous ornament of awareness, never ceasing.

—

[11011-11030]
Natural expression appearance is: like vast space appearing, direction-falling without any limit; like clear water appearing, thing to grasp without any nature; like deep-blue lapis appearing, not divided by part or section; like white conch appearing, order and sequence not holding; like yellow gold appearing, qualities spontaneously complete; like red ruby appearing, clarity and brightness not ceasing; like green emerald appearing, qualities spontaneously perfect.

—

[11031-11050]
Five colors themselves abiding in unity, color not holding as separate, great beyond limit. Rolled-up potential, yet shape without fixed form. Not ceasing in manifestation, yet condition without dependence. Not pervading partially, yet great self-resonance everywhere. Self-clear luminosity, outer inner together with as one. Without effort or accomplishment, yet by spontaneous force accomplished.

—

[11051-11070]
Compassion appearance manifests as: like empty space appearing, clarity not ceasing anywhere; without elaboration of concept, great elaboration of qualities complete; nature not ceasing in essence, various not determined as fixed categories; clear luminosity without limit, darkness nowhere to be found; not ceasing in manifestation, not-existing as real great beyond extremes.

—

[11071-11090]
Force-empty from beginning, all-arising great manifestation; not mixed with impurities, completely appearing as pure great; pervading all without limit, gathered into one great unity; pure from the first, confusion not ceasing as its display great. Complete as one appearance great without duality, compassion not ceasing abides thus from beginningless time.

—

[11091-11110]
From the Thalgyur Tantra, mother of all Dzogchen teachings: "First essence nature spontaneously present, and compassion three aspects inseparably abiding. That also essence as body abiding, Dharma enjoyment emanation three aspects, not divided yet dividing without manner—by spontaneous force accomplished itself also."

—

[11111-11130]
Body color and qualities mind-object without. Natural expression appearing as light manner—white red yellow green and deep-blue, not mark with-mark appearance without, without category yet knowable by force accomplished. Compassion appearance various manifesting from basis, this like nature one determined without fixation, because various appearances manifest, basis called the ground of all.

—

[11131-11150]
From the side of essence primordially pure, nothing whatsoever is established as real. Although outwardly-clear aspect with light and body-color appears, it is not established as any limited category. From the expanse of nature spontaneously accomplished, primordial resonance of five lights—body, rays, bindu—appears as most subtle essence. Coiled within vast expanse of awareness, inner clear subtle pristine cognition naturally exists without obstruction.

—

[11151-11170]
If cut into side of primordial purity alone as one aspect, what would be aspect of body and pristine cognition arising? In basis held as only primordially pure, nothing whatsoever exists as other. If thinking arising from that expanse as unceasing display—does it exist or not exist as separate? If not exists, arising is not logically valid, just as from non-thing nothing can arise.

—

[11171-11190]
If exists as other, it contradicts with holding nothing whatsoever exists in basis. Therefore, nature of primordially pure is unceasing display inseparable. In that expanse, inner clear subtle pristine cognition, primordial resonance, clarity appearance, subtle naturally exists. Outwardly clear coarse appearance not accepted as real, liberated from extreme of permanence. Inner clear subtle awareness held as natural, liberated from extreme of nihilism.

—

[11191-11210]
Thus, free from all extremes, self-arisen pristine cognition essence empty, not established anywhere as limited thing. Nature clear appearance manner not ceasing in display. Compassion not ceasing in knowing, whatever like appears, basis doing all manifestation is. Basis as thing-essence actual state of reality itself.

—

[11211-11230]
Essence empty aspect from reversion of primordial purity elaborately explained: because what is primordially pure is not established as any limited thing or mark, by reversion regarding empty nature—awareness not exists as real entity; non-awareness not exists as other; Buddha not exists as separate from mind; sentient beings not exists as truly deluded.

—

[11231-11250]
Saṃsāra not exists as real place; nirvāṇa not exists as other place; light not exists as substantial thing; color not exists as real quality; body not exists as material form; pristine cognition not exists as separate knower; basis not exists as ground to find; path not exists as way to travel; fruition not exists as result to obtain.

—

[11251-11270]
Whoever confusion not exists as real delusion; liberation not exists as freedom to gain; bondage not exists as state to escape; liberation not exists as separate from bondage; action not exists as real cause; afflictions not exists as true obscuration; wind not exists as element to grasp; elements not exists as bases of form.

—

[11271-11290]
Is not exists as affirmation; is-not not exists as negation; what not exists as particular thing; what not exists as anything at all; anything established as real and anything observable as separate—not found. Negation dharma is shown only by contrast to establishment dharma; abandoning both extremes is the meaning.

—

[11291-11310]
From Auspicious Beautiful Tantra: "Called great primordial purity beyond all concept. Truly arisen Buddha never arose as other from mind. Not pure sentient beings never arose as truly deluded abiding. Called great primordial resonance unmoved awareness essence. To that ultimate inexpressible by any word, immeasurable by any standard, not observable as object of senses, not measurable by any concept."

—

[11311-11330]
Not calculable by any number, by whoever not determined as this or that, not showable as exhibit to others, knowing object not makeable by fabrication. By that pristine nature saṃsāra not seen as real; saṃsāra by that deluded mind not seen as basis. That ultimate dharma not practiced as method; by ordinary dharma that ultimate meaning not realized.

—

[11331-11350]
That ultimate saṃsāra not is as real; nirvāṇa not is as other than mind; basis not is as ground to find; appearance not is as thing seen; darkness not is as obstruction; path not is as way to walk; traverse not as journey to make; not traverse not is as remaining; fruition not is as result to obtain; abandoned not is as renunciation; obtained not is as acquisition.

—

[11351-11370]
That called great awareness expanse of mind itself. From Letterless Tantra: "To me self-arisen pristine cognition nature, analyzing object of scrutiny not exists. Before passed not exists as past; after arising not exists as future; now appearing anything not exists as present. Action not exists as real cause; latency not exists as hidden seed; non-awareness not exists as true delusion."

—

[11371-11390]
Mind not exists as separate entity; intellect not exists as thinking; wisdom not exists as separate knowing; saṃsāra not exists as real cycle; nirvāṇa not exists as true peace; awareness itself also not exists as thing; pristine cognition appearance anything not exists as real. From Mu-tig-phreng-ba: "Natural expression abiding essence to primordial purity, Buddha not exists as separate and sentient beings not exists as other."

—

[11391-11410]
Non-awareness not exists and confusion not exists as real. Mind not exists as substantial, intellect also as thing exists not. Enemy not exists as opposition, friend not exists as support, relative also not exists as connection. Afflictions not exists as obscurations and self-grasping not exists as root delusion. Going not exists as movement and coming not exists as arrival.

—

[11411-11430]
Dharma not exists as teaching, dharma as appearing separately not exists. Method not exists as path, wisdom itself also as thing not exists. Aggregates not exists as components and elements also not exists as bases. This is the exhaustive negation that leaves nothing to hold, nowhere to stand, nothing to achieve—yet awareness remains, luminous and free.

—

[10782-11430]
This entire section establishes the unsurpassed basis of Great Perfection. Through objections and responses, through elaborate description and exhaustive negation, it The name 'mountain'—the word is not the peak. what cannot be pointed to, describes what cannot be described, establishes what was never unestablished. The ground is primordially pure yet spontaneously present, empty yet aware, transcendent yet immanent.

—

[10782-11430]
The metaphors—conch shell, space, water, lapis, gold, ruby, emerald—are not decorations but doorways. Each reveals an aspect of the nature of mind. The white conch: purity without sequence. The blue lapis: depth without division. The yellow gold: qualities spontaneously complete. The red ruby: clarity without ceasing. The green emerald: perfection natural and unobstructed.

—

[10782-11430]
Voice of completion: I have presented the basis as primordially pure, as spontaneously present, as the non-dual ground of all. I have answered objections, cited tantras, offered metaphors, exhaustively negated. Now rest. The basis is not something to understand but something to recognize. It is here, now, always—your own mind, naturally perfect, spontaneously present, primordially liberated.

—

[10782-11430]
The practitioner studying this section may feel overwhelmed by the density of negation. Everything is denied: Buddha, sentient beings, saṃsāra, nirvāṇa, path, fruition, awareness itself. Yet this negation is not nihilism. It is the clearing of obstacles, the removal of false assumptions, the dissolution of reification. What remains when all is negated? The negator cannot be negated; the awareness that negates shines more clearly.

—

[10782-11430]
The youth vase body—the youthful, fresh, ever-new body of the nature of mind. Not aged by time, not worn by experience, not limited by conditions. This is the ground as it is, before aging, before decay, before any limitation. The vase containing all qualities, yet itself empty. The body of all Buddhas, yet not separate from any sentient being.

—

[10782-11430]
The five colors—white, red, yellow, green, blue—are not merely symbolic. They represent the five wisdoms, the five Buddha families, the five elements, the five aspects of pristine cognition. Yet they are not separate; they abide in unity. Like white light containing all colors, the nature of mind contains all qualities without division.

—

[10782-11430]
The three aspects—essence, nature, compassion—are one in essence yet different in aspect. Like water: its essence is wetness, its nature is fluidity, its compassion is the ability to quench thirst. Three descriptions, one reality. The practitioner who sees the unity does not deny the aspects; the one who sees the aspects does not miss the unity.

—

[10782-11430]
The objections raised and answered in this section are eternal objections. They arise in every generation, in every mind that encounters these teachings. "If all is pure, why delusion?" "If all is present, why seek?" The answers are not new; they are as old as awakening itself. Yet they must be given, again and again, until recognition dawns.

—

[10782-11430]
The dream analogy extends beyond the initial comparison. Just as a dreamer can realize they are dreaming while still in the dream, the practitioner can recognize the nature of mind while still in saṃsāra. This recognition does not end the dream immediately; it transforms the relationship to the dream. Similarly, recognition of the basis does not necessarily end appearances; it transforms how they are seen.

—

[10782-11430]
The tantra verses quoted are not mere citations; they are transmissions. When Longchenpa quotes the Auspicious Beautiful Tantra or the Thalgyur, he is not proving a point but transmitting a recognition. The words carry the blessing of the lineage, the power of realization, the potency of direct introduction.

—

[10782-11430]
The exhaustive negation—"not exists, not exists, not exists"—is not pessimism. It is the most optimistic teaching possible. If nothing exists as real, nothing can bind. If nothing is established, nothing can obstruct. The practitioner is liberated not by achieving something but by recognizing the non-existence of what seemed to bind.

—

[10782-11430]
The basis as described here is not a philosophical concept. It is the nature of your own mind, right now, as you read these words. Don't look elsewhere; don't think this is about something abstract or distant. The white mandala is the white of your awareness. The five colors are the colors of your experience. The youth vase body is your own nature, ever fresh, ever present.

—

[10782-11430]
Voice of recognition: I have studied the objections, contemplated the responses, memorized the tantra verses. Now I see: the basis is not something to be established by reasoning. It is something to be recognized directly. All the elaborate presentation serves one purpose—to exhaust the mind's tendency to seek elsewhere, to postpone, to imagine that awakening is somewhere other than here.

—

[10782-11430]
The section concludes having established what cannot be established, described what cannot be described, pointed to what cannot be pointed to. This is the method of Great Perfection: using the conceptual to exhaust the conceptual, using elaboration to reach non-elaboration, using the path to discover there is nowhere to go.

—

[10782-11430]
May all who study this section find the recognition it A map shows the path, but paper is not the journey.ward. May the elaborate serve those who need it. May the direct reveal itself to those ready. May all beings recognize the unsurpassed basis—their own mind, primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated. This completes the presentation of the non-dual ground.

—

[10782-11430]
The depth of this presentation is not measured by its length but by its impact. Some will read these words and find immediate recognition; others will study for years before the understanding ripens. Both are served; both are valid; both will recognize in their own time. The basis does not discriminate between quick and slow learners.

—

[10782-11430]
The metaphors of precious substances—gold, ruby, emerald, lapis—are not arbitrary. They convey qualities that words alone cannot capture. Gold: unchanging, precious, complete. Ruby: clear, bright, luminous. Emerald: fresh, alive, perfect. Lapis: deep, infinite, pure. Together they form a complete picture of the nature of mind.

—

[10782-11430]
The youth vase body deserves contemplation. Youthful: not aged by time, fresh in every moment. Vase: containing all, yet empty. Body: the form of the formless, the appearance of the unmanifest. This is not a physical body but the body of reality itself, the dharmakāya that is one's own nature.

—

[10782-11430]
The three bodies—Dharmakāya, Saṃbhogakāya, Nirmāṇakāya—are not achievements to attain but aspects to recognize. The Dharmakāya is the emptiness of mind. The Saṃbhogakāya is its luminous nature. The Nirmāṇakāya is its unceasing display. Three aspects, one reality, all present simultaneously in every moment of awareness.

—

[10782-11430]
The five wisdom lights are not external phenomena but the natural expression of awareness. When recognition dawns, ordinary perception transforms into wisdom perception. The elements reveal themselves as light. Forms reveal themselves as empty yet luminous. This is not a change in what is seen but in how it is seen.

—

[10782-11430]
Voice of completion: I have wandered through the objections and responses, contemplated the metaphors, absorbed the negations. What remains? Only this: the basis is my own mind, primordially pure, spontaneously present. Nothing to achieve, nowhere to go, no one to become. Resting in this recognition is the completion of the path.

—

[10782-11430]
This concludes the extensive section on the non-dual ground. May it serve beings until the end of time. May those who encounter it find recognition. May the lineage continue, the blessing flow, the teachings flourish. This is the unsurpassed basis of Great Perfection, presented in its fullness for the benefit of all.

—

[10782-11430]
The presentation of the unsurpassed basis is complete. It has covered the objections and their resolutions, the elaborate description of essence and nature, the exhaustive negation of all reified views. What remains is not more understanding but direct recognition. The finger has pointed; the moon awaits seeing.

—

[10782-11430]
The practitioner who has studied this section thoroughly may feel both satisfaction and dissatisfaction—satisfaction at the completeness of the presentation, dissatisfaction at its inability to capture what it You breathe, feeling air move—but the sensation is not the life-force.. This is appropriate. The teachings are complete yet incomplete, satisfying yet leaving hunger, answering yet leaving questions. This is their nature.

—

[10782-11430]
May all beings recognize their own mind as the unsurpassed basis. May they see the primordial purity that is their essence. May they recognize the spontaneous presence that is their nature. May they embody the compassion that is their capacity. This is the wish of the lineage, the aspiration of the teachings, the blessing of the masters.

—

[10782-11430]
Completion. The non-dual ground has been established. The basis of all has been revealed. The unsurpassed foundation has been laid. Now build upon it—or better yet, recognize that it needs no building, has always been complete, awaits only recognition. This is the Great Perfection.

—

[10782-11430]
The treasury's generosity extends through every word of this section. No aspect of the basis is left unexplored, no objection unaddressed, no doubt unclarified. Yet with all this elaboration, the essence remains simple: recognize your own mind. This is the teaching; this is the practice; this is the result.

—

[10782-11430]
The dream analogy, the precious metaphors, the exhaustive negations—all serve to loosen the grip of conceptual mind. When the grip loosens, recognition can dawn. This is not a process to complete but a presence to discover. The discovery is not new; what is discovered was never lost.

—

[10782-11430]
Voice of the lineage: We have preserved these teachings through centuries of change. We have transmitted them from heart to heart, from recognition to recognition. Now they come to you. Will you recognize? Will you rest in the unsurpassed basis? The lineage awaits your awakening with confidence, knowing that recognition is inevitable, liberation certain.

—

[10782-11430]
The final word on the non-dual ground: it is not something to be established through reasoning, though reasoning can point to it. It is not something to be achieved through practice, though practice can prepare for it. It is not something to be received from another, though transmission can spark it. It is your own nature, always present, always complete, always free.

—

[10782-11430]
The unsurpassed basis is not a concept to be understood but a reality to be recognized. The difference is crucial. Understanding builds structures in the mind; recognition dissolves them. Understanding accumulates knowledge; recognition reveals wisdom. Understanding is of the past; recognition is always present.

—

[10782-11430]
All the elaborate presentation in this section—all the objections, responses, metaphors, negations—serves one purpose: to bring the practitioner to the threshold of recognition. Once there, the teachings have done their work. The practitioner must step across, or not step, as recognition dictates. No one can step for another.

The basis as primordially pure is not a state to achieve but a fact to recognize. It has always been pure; confusion never stained it. The basis as spontaneously present is not a quality to develop but a nature to acknowledge. It has always been present; effort never created it. This is the simplicity that contains all complexity.

Completion of this section marks a transition. From here, the treasury moves to practical application—how to recognize, how to stabilize, how to embody. But without understanding the basis, the practices are empty. With understanding, every practice is complete. This section provides the foundation; what follows builds the structure.

[10782-11430]
May the unsurpassed basis be recognized by all. May the primordial purity be seen as one's own essence. May the spontaneous presence be known as one's own nature. May the non-dual ground be the abode of all beings. This is the completion of the presentation of the basis.

The non-dual ground stands as the foundation of all Great Perfection teachings. Without understanding it, the path is confused; with understanding, the path is clear. Yet understanding is not enough—recognition is required. May all who study find not just understanding but direct recognition of their own mind as the unsurpassed basis.

The elaborate presentation serves those who need elaboration; the simple recognition serves those ready for simplicity. Both are accommodated in this treasury. The objections serve those with doubts; the responses serve those seeking clarity. All are served; none are excluded.

[10782-11430]
This concludes the establishment of the non-dual ground. The basis is set; the foundation is laid. From here, the structure of practice and result will be built. But always remember: the structure is built on ground that needs no building, foundation that needs no foundation, basis that has always been complete.

[10782-11430]
Final word: recognize now. Don't wait for more teachings, more understanding, more preparation. The basis is here, now, always. Recognition is possible in this very moment. This is the Great Perfection's gift—immediacy, directness, completeness. Take it. Recognize. Be free.

—

[10782-11430]
The unsurpassed basis has been thoroughly presented. All objections answered, all doubts clarified, all aspects revealed. The practitioner who has engaged with this section sincerely has the foundation for the entire path. The recognition of the non-dual ground is the key that opens all doors, the light that illuminates all teachings, the completion of all practices.

[10782-11430]
May this presentation serve beings until the end of time. May it bring recognition to those ready. May it prepare those not yet ready. May all eventually recognize their own mind as the primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated basis of all. This is the completion of the section on the non-dual ground.

—

[10782-11430]
Recognize the basis. Rest in recognition. This is the entire teaching.

—

[10782-11430]
