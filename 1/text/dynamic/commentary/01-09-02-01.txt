[12478-12483] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The ground of delusion arises from the very basis of purity itself. Although the pure Buddha possesses no delusion, Vajrasattva becomes deluded from the basis of early time. From the vast field called Broad Expanse, from the beautiful place, from the moment when dissolution occurs—this is how confusion enters. The year of the pig, the emanated sun, the star bird, and the elder with the mushroom hat—all these symbolic elements point to the conditions of ignorance.

[12484-12499] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old practitioner chuckles at the symbolism. Four friends represent the four conditions. Five wild men are the five poisons. The single back-support is conceptualizing mind. The single thief is anger. The single accumulator is deluded appearance made singular through grasping. These immeasurable ones become deluded, yet they arise from the basis that possesses no delusion. Like waves arising from the ocean that was never disturbed.

[12478-12478] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. See what is. Rest. The five men on the stone fortress peak represent the five poisons moving awareness from its self-abode, causing delusion. The symbolic narratives reveal the ground (gzhi) of appearing. Existence arises. Sentient beings arise as inconceivable forms. Delusion's path and thought arise according to how one thinks. Vajrasattva is Rigpa awareness. The field is Broad Expanse. The first four. The abode is Beautiful. The basis appears through spontaneous presence's door.

[12478-12478] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The time when dissolution occurs represents self-ignorance appearing as other—the delusion-basis appearance. The year of the pig represents the time when ignorance is fully conceptualized. The emanated sun represents clear perception of coarse object appearances. The star bird represents desire arising as attachment to objects. The elder with the heap represents the emergence of non-recognition as deluded apprehension. Indeterminate lineage represents how ground appearances manifest equally as liberation and delusion.

[12478-12478] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Between the symbolic and the real, wisdom's meaning unfolds. The teacher Light-Spread represents self-arising wisdom. The two sons are pure awareness and spontaneous wisdom. Being imprisoned in the cave represents how spontaneous appearance lacks wisdom, bound by non-recognition. The five men conquering from the stone fortress represent how the five poisons disturb Rigpa's self-abiding nature. The two sons blocked by the elder crone represent Rigpa entering the valley of existence, blocked by ignorance.

[12478-12478] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! The symbolic narrative reveals the path. Four men capturing and separating five from horses—this represents how the four wisdoms purify the five afflictions. The four wisdoms: liberating, gathering, distinguishing, and moving to the expanse. The two sons escaping and killing guards represent recognizing self-awareness and dissolving conceptual bonds. The sons fleeing to sun and rain and gathering subjects represent Rigpa entering the eyes and beholding the expanse.

[12478-12478] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Resting in the spacious meaning of these symbols, we see the twenty-one queens consulting represent the twenty-one instructions manifesting inner meaning. The five men guarding with hats represent the bindu of five lights remaining unmoving, unreachable by thought. The four mirrors looking at the demon represent the four lamps' wisdom revealing self-abiding Rigpa. Seeing the house with eight doors represents recognizing spontaneous presence and establishing the ground (gzhi).

[12478-12478] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old practitioner sees the profound symbolism. The third section presents another teaching from spontaneous presence. In the realm of Great Circumference dwells a single lamp not extinguished within the great mire of body and mind. The realm of Radiant Light is seen by the Teacher Mirror-Possessor, embodiment of awareness. Listen, radiant being, and I shall prophesy for you without distraction, pointing to your true nature.

[12478-12478] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): Upon the peak of Mount Malaya lies the ocean with rim, where Father Light-Protection and Mother Vajra-Sow dwell. From their union came two children, brother and sister, representing wisdom and means. The parents spoke to the children, giving instructions for the path. Son, go to the demon land and come to the mirror of self-recognition. Daughter, go to the thirty-three gods' victorious palace and gather flowers of merit.

[12478-12478] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. See what is. Rest. The son said he would not go because the demon Black Halika would imprison him in non-recognition. The parents questioned why he would not go, seeking to understand his hesitation. The son replied that in the demon land dwells Aunt Mushroom Hat, who is the aunt, the co-emergent ignorance. Ask her for fire of wisdom, he requested, understanding the need for recognition.

[12478-12478] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The son spoke to his parents, revealing his understanding. Noble parents, that land is not mine, yet I shall go there for the benefit of beings. Send five servants representing the five wisdoms and a sword anointed with sesame oil of clear light. Send five mirrors representing the five Buddha families. The parents rejoiced and agreed, sending five servants and five mirrors as supports.

[12478-12478] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Between hesitation and action, the path unfolds. The son spoke again, asking for further guidance. Noble parents, if I am captured in the demon land, what method shall I use? The parents replied that in the Jewel Heap Land of the mind dwell four caste people, the four lamps. Send them as troops—one to gather troops of virtue, one with iron chains of method, two to block the gate of delusion. Thus they gave the complete instructions.

[12478-12478] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! Thus prophesied by the parents, the son said he would do so with confidence. Saying E Ma Ho, he departed, and the demon Black Halika saw him approaching. A flesh-eating human has appeared, do not let him escape, said the attendants of affliction. The five demons captured him, and Aunt Mushroom Hat put him in iron chains of grasping. She told the attendants that he killed her son, so do not release him from bondage.

[12478-12478] Voice 22 (Drolo): Sudden wrath for liberation! Then the boy spoke, using skillful means. Noble aunt, my parents said that Aunt Mushroom Hat dwells in the demon land of non-recognition. They told me to come to the mirror, so release me without capture for I am your relative. The old woman replied that she would not release him because he killed her son of delusion. Then the boy spoke again, threatening to use force.

[12478-12478] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old practitioner sees how the drama unfolds. If you do not release me, I shall summon troops of wisdom to conquer, said the boy. You yourself summon troops, she replied arrogantly, and thus he could not escape alone. Then the boy sent messages to three friends representing the three baskets of teachings. Friends, in the Jewel Heap Land of mind dwell four people of the caste, the four lamps. Go there, for the boy Rig Knowledge has been captured—bring many troops of wisdom.

[12478-12478] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Resting in the meaning of the symbolic narrative, we understand. They agreed and went swiftly to assist their friend. Then within three days at sunrise, many troops came and blocked the gate of delusion. The prisoner's irons were broken, the old woman of non-recognition was expelled. The five were separated from their horses, and Aunt's son was captured. The attendants were beheaded with swords of wisdom and killed, liberating all.

[12478-12478] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): Then he fled to his own land and met his sister coming with many flowers of virtue. The parents recognized them and rejoiced greatly, naming the brother Vajra Chain Puller. The sister was named Rim Holder, representing the bindu of clear light. Then the siblings consulted and saw the Teacher Mirror-Possessor, Buddha Samantabhadra. Listen, noble child, in the Uncontrived Appearance Land dwells a crystal stupa of Dharmakaya.

[12478-12478] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. See what is. Rest. Upon its wheel are four silver mirrors of the four lamps, so go from Malaya's peak. Put it in the rim enclosure, climb the jewel stairs carrying a jewel vessel of wisdom. At the stupa's peak dwells a teacher Unchanging Light, the Dharmakaya Buddha. From his right foot comes a light-ray rope of compassion, so hold it without fear and go. Then your appearance's father is there, so run there with devotion.

[12478-12478] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Beyond that is a crystal house with eight doors, where your mother Various Appearance dwells. At that time you will not recognize your mother due to habitual patterns. Beyond that is a house of various jewels, your true abode, so take your seat there. Thus prophesied by the Teacher, the boy Chain Puller spoke with gratitude. Great Teacher, we shall do so, he said to his sister with determination.

[12478-12478] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Between prophecy and fulfillment, the path is traversed. Riding the sun's rays of wisdom, wearing rainbow armor of the elements. With a pearl garland binding the waist of channels, holding a crystal spear of awareness. A path appeared in space and they reached the jewel house without obstruction. The meaning is thus, profound and vast. The Great Circumference Land represents cyclic existence with its endless rounds. The mire represents body, speech, and mind as the vessel of practice.

[12478-12478] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old practitioner sees the complete symbolism. The lamp represents Rigpa's wisdom always burning within. The Radiant Land represents the clear light within the heart center. The Teacher Mirror Empty represents self-arising wisdom as the mirror lamp. Prophecy represents understanding through direct experience beyond words. Mount Malaya's peak with ocean and teacher parents represents Rigpa's self-radiance. The bindu and empty lamp arise from the sphere of pure appearance and bindu of empty space.

[12478-12478] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! The parents instructing the children represent the sphere appearance and bindu maturing in the senses. The son not following instructions represents dull faculties and beginner's attachment to appearances. If attached, self-awareness is bound by demons of apprehension and grasping. Aunt represents co-emergent non-recognition with Rigpa that must be recognized. The single mirror represents the experience of object investigation revealing emptiness.

[12478-12478] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Resting in the spacious meaning, we understand the five with sword and mirrors represent how appearance is not Rigpa's object. Lost in delusion, Rigpa wanders there, needing the five wisdoms as companions. The son asking the method represents seeking liberation from delusion through inquiry. The Jewel Heap Land is the mind, the four people are the four lamps. Sending troops represents practice companions—gathering with wisdom, distinguishing mind and wisdom.

[12478-12478] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): Going there represents delusion from ground appearance into existence. Captured by demons represents Rigpa falling under afflictions' power. Aunt's grief not releasing represents cyclic existence not liberated by words alone. The three messengers represent the three baskets, skillfully conveying symbolic meaning. The boy represents Rigpa bound in existence yet seeking liberation. Calling the four lamps as allies, wisdom and realization arise to conquer.

[12478-12478] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. See what is. Rest. The prison irons break, the old woman of non-recognition is expelled. The five poisons' afflictions with their wind-horses are separated from Rigpa. Rigpa recognizes its nature without departing from its place, capturing the essence. Eighty thousand afflictions are beheaded by the sword of wisdom. Clear light of Dharmata's self-appearance recognized as the ground (gzhi).

[12478-12478] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The sister gathering flowers represents the lamp's perfect measure accomplished. The parents naming represents non-recognition severed, Rigpa self-clear. The Vajra Chain Puller self-arises as Nirmanakaya for beings. The empty bindu lamp appears to objects as Sambhogakaya. The siblings consulting represents Rigpa entering the expanse, gathered as one. Seeing the Teacher represents the first bardo's clear light of Dharmakaya.

[12478-12478] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Between symbol and direct perception, the path completes. The Uncontrived Appearance Land represents Dharmata bardo's natural display. The stupa represents the five lights' five bindus adorned as the Buddha body. The wheel with four mirrors represents the five light-paths and four wisdoms united. These can be seen now if practiced with devotion and diligence. Coming from Malaya represents non-abiding, looking at the expanse's enclosure.

[12478-12478] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old practitioner laughs with joy at the teaching's completion. The stairs, vessel, and peak's teacher with light represent realization recognizing nature. The eight-door house represents spontaneous presence's eight gateways of perception. The jewel house represents the precious spontaneous presence's interior. Going according to prophecy represents riding the light-ray sunbeam without transformation. The measure of realization binds, wisdom's spear in hand cutting delusion.

[12478-12478] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears! A path arises in space, liberating in primordial purity's ground of Dharmakaya. The fourth section presents another teaching from spontaneous presence. In the Pure Appearance Land dwells a fortress with eight doors of liberation. The boy Self-Arising Rigpa Knowledge rules there as the natural state. An old woman Mushroom Hat dwells there, and the king Arrow Guard Fame Power. He has five princely sons who went to play, capturing the old woman of ignorance.

[12478-12478] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): Resting in the meaning, we see the symbolism. The Pure Appearance Land represents Rigpa's pure realm of Dharmakaya. The eight-door fortress represents spontaneous presence's eight gateways of liberation. Self-arising Rigpa dwells with co-emergent non-recognition as the old woman. The king represents the root of afflictions, self-grasping at true existence. The sons represent the five poison afflictions that disturb the mind.

[12478-12478] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): Play represents mastery over the five senses while experiencing attachment and aversion. Capturing the old woman represents non-recognition grasped by the five poisons. The five poisons become one with non-recognition, unified in deluded essence. This is how non-recognition appears in each sense when meeting the five poisons. Going to the daughter's playground represents how non-recognition's essence exists in Rigpa. Rigpa captured in its place represents conceptual grasping wherever attachment and aversion arise.
What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. The nature is complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.
