[12478-12499]
When the basis appears from the ground, it becomes deluded by the Three Ignorances and Four Conditions. From Self-Arisen Rigpa comes the tantra teaching:

Though the Pure Buddha possesses no delusion, Vajrasattva's manner of delusion from the early basis arises through symbolic references: from the Field called Broad, from the Place called Beautiful, from the time when destruction occurs, from the Pig Year, from the Sun called Created, from the Star Bird, from the human named Old One Who Possesses a Heap, from indeterminate lineage.

Four friends exist, then five wild-men arise, then one back-support, one thief, one accumulator of all, then immeasurable collections of armies arise. Those immeasurable ones become deluded, yet they arise from the basis that possesses no delusion.

This symbolizes how confusion enters awareness—not from outside, but from the very appearance of the basis itself. The basis that possesses no delusion is Rigpa, the self-arising awareness. Delusion arises when Rigpa appears to itself as other, as objects, as external phenomena. This is the ground of all confusion: the pure awareness appearing to itself as the world of deluded appearances.

Four friends represent the four conditions for delusion. Five wild-men represent the five poisons. The single back-support is conceptualizing mind. The single thief is anger. The single accumulator is deluded appearance made singular through grasping.

These immeasurable ones become deluded, yet they arise from the basis that possesses no delusion. Like waves arising from the ocean that was never disturbed.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. The nature is complete—nothing needs to be added or removed.
