[1-22]
When basis appears from ground, deluded by Three Ignorances and Four
Conditions. Gzhi las gzhi snang du shar dus—when basis-appearance dawns
from basis. Ma rig pa gsum dang rkyen bzhis 'khrul te—deluded by three
ignorances and four conditions. This is how confusion enters: not from
outside, but from basis-appearance itself.

[3-22]
This wanderer once thought delusion came from somewhere else. Sought purity
by rejecting impurity. Then recognized: the pure Buddha possesses no delusion,
yet delusion arises from that very purity. Like waves from ocean—ocean never
disturbed, waves apparently separate.

[5-22]
Symbolic references unfold: Field called Broad, Place called Beautiful, time
when destruction occurs, Pig Year, Created Sun, Star Bird, human named Old One
Who Possesses Heap, indeterminate lineage. Not historical facts but symbolic
teachings—each representing condition for delusion's arising.

[7-22]
Four friends exist (rogs mi bzhi)—four conditions. Five wild-men arise (mi
rgod pa lnga)—five poisons. One back-support (rgyab rten pa)—conceptualizing
mind. One thief (rkun mo)—anger. One accumulator (bsogs pa)—grasping. Then
immeasurable armies arise.

[9-22]
Those immeasurable ones become deluded, yet arise from basis possessing no
delusion. 'Khrul gzhi med pa—no deluded basis. Delusion has no ground, no
foundation, no reality. Yet apparently arises. This is the mystery: pure
awareness appearing as deluded world.

[11-22]
Basis pure. Delusion apparent. Recognition liberates. Three words, but
the basis was never deluded—only recognition was apparently absent.

[13-22]
Like mirror reflecting dust—mirror never touched, reflection clear. Rigpa,
self-arising awareness, appears as other, as objects, as external. Ground
of confusion: pure awareness appearing as deluded appearances. Rest in the
basis that has never been deluded.
