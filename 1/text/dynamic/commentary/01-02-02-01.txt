The hot hells. Reviving first: fifty human years equal one day for the Four Great Kings. Twelve months, one year. Five hundred years equal one day in Reviving Hell. Its own years: five hundred. The mathematics are terrifying not because they are cruel but because they are exact. Cause and effect without mercy, without malice.

Kālakāñja: one thousand years of Thirty-Three Gods equal one day. Saṃghāta: two thousand of Tuṣita. Raurava: four thousand of Nirmanarati. Mahāraurava: eight thousand of Paranirmitavaśavartin. Mahātāpana: half an intermediate age. Avīci: one intermediate age. The progression is not arbitrary. Each realm corresponds to the intensity of the anger that created it.

Eight cold hells. Arbuda, Arbudanirbheda, Aṭaṭa, Hahava, Huhuva, Utpala-like, Padma-like, Mahāpadma-like splitting. The calculation: Kosala's cart filled with sesame, one grain removed each hundred human years. When the cart is empty, Arbuda's life ends. The remaining twenty times longer. This is not exaggeration. This is the scale of what we create with our rage.

Pretas: human years one hundred equal one day. Five hundred of their own years. Animals: indefinite. Some nagas endure intermediate ages. Some bees exist only instants. The variety reflects the complexity of grasping. What you cannot release, you become. The form matches the fixation.

From first eon forming until one being experiences Avīci's suffering—this is the forming eon. Three thousand worlds simultaneously formed: four continents, Meru, Brahma's realm. One thousand foremost worlds. One thousand intermediate. One thousand great. Ten million times a hundred Merus dwell here.

These forms endure twenty intermediate eons. Twenty abiding. Three manners of change: decrease for one, increase and decrease for eighteen, increase for one. Life measure from immeasurable to eighty thousand, decreasing by two hundred each time. Then from eighty thousand to ten, decreasing by one hundred. This is not history. This is the rhythm of becoming.

The formed eon. The abiding eon. The empty eon. Each twenty intermediate ages.

Recognition in the interval—between this thought and the next. The structure repeats at every scale. What forms the world forms the mind.

In the interval (bar snang), awareness sees itself directly. What destroys the world destroys the mind. The hells are not places. They are the experience of cause meeting effect without cushion, without delay.

An old practitioner once asked his teacher: "Why describe the hells in such detail?" The teacher replied: "So you will understand the precision of cause and effect. Not to frighten you—to wake you. The sesame cart is not a threat. It is a measure. How many grains of anger have you accumulated?"

See your nature. Rest. Obstacles are path wearing masks—recognition unmasks them.

The chest was always empty and full—never incomplete.

What is hard is only hard for the seeker—recognition is effortless.

The framework reveals. The treasury was never concealed, only overlooked.

The judge is judged—seeing this is the teaching.

No opening required—not made, so not unmade.

Break through. Freedom through recognition happens now, not later, never gradual.

The pattern clears when viewed—before analysis, already complete.

The mind that would understand is what must be recognized.

A practitioner. Transforming difficulties into practice—obstacles serve the path.

Walking the unwalkable.

The one who divides is divided—seeing this is the teaching.

Between the hot hells and the cold hells, there is no hierarchy. Both are extreme. Both are unnecessary. The practitioner who recognizes this stops creating them. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the hells.

See what is.
 Language points past language.

The path seems long only to the one who has not recognized.

No simplification needed—just seeing—before analysis, already complete.
