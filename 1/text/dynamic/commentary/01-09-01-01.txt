[11335-11337]
Observe. Understand. Release.
from the nature itself, not from a teacher, not from a text. The nature of primordial purity,
ka dag, abides like space itself. Not falling into any direction—not east or west, not India
or Tibet, not here or there. The nature is not located. It is what location appears within.

[11336-11337]
This old fool once sought the primordial purity in special places. He traveled to sacred mountains,
to caves where masters had practiced, to spots blessed by great teachers. He found conditions
conducive to practice. He did not find what was never lost. Primordial purity is not in places.
It is what allows places to appear.

[11338-11344]
The Precious Jewel Casket of Spontaneous Presence. Lhun grub. Not made. Not constructed. Arising
naturally, without effort, without cause. Eight modes of appearance. Two gates. The ground of
spontaneous presence. The ground of indeterminacy. The ground appearing as diversity. Below,
the point of reversal. These are not sequential stages. They are simultaneous aspects of what
you are.

[11341-11344]
The ground of spontaneous presence is not a place you find. It is what is present when seeking
ceases. The indeterminacy is not uncertainty. It is freedom from fixed position. The diversity
is not confusion. It is the creativity of the nature. The point of reversal is not a fall.
It is the possibility of non-recognition within recognition.

[11345-11354]
The youthful vase body. Gzhon nu bum pa'i sku. Within the primordial expanse, essence abides as
form, nature as speech, compassion as mind. This is the threefold mandala of the ground. Not
created. Not developed. Naturally present. The fiery sparks of five lights arising from the
tones of spontaneous presence. The investigating consciousness emerging toward compassion.
Not knowing its own face, it becomes non-recognition.

[11348-11354]
This mountain dweller has watched firelight dance in high-altitude darkness. The sparks rise
naturally, without plan, without intention. They investigate the darkness, momentarily illuminating,
then dissolving. This is the play of rigpa. The ground never moves. The appearance dances.
The not-knowing is not error. It is the condition for the play.

[11355-11369]
The ground itself does not change. Change belongs to appearance. Like clouds forming in a cloudless
sky—the sky does not become cloudy. The appearance of cloud is the play of sky. This is the
change of appearance in rigpa, not the change of rigpa itself. Eight modes of spontaneous
presence arising from primordial purity.

[11359-11369]
The great manner of appearance of the precious casket jewel. Eight gates, unobstructed:
Compassion giving rise to compassion for beings. Light filling appearances with rainbow radiance.
Wisdom abiding in non-conceptuality. Form manifesting as peaceful and wrathful deities.
Non-duality not conceiving singular or plural. Beyond-extremes naturally clear. Pure wisdom
revealing cloudless sky. Impure samsara revealing six realms.

[11360-11369]
A hilltop meditator... sees how these gates are not really gates. They are
ways of speaking about what has no obstruction. Compassion appearing is not compassion going
somewhere. It is compassion recognizing itself as beings. Light filling appearances is not
light traveling. It is the nature of appearance as light. Do not literalize these images.
See what they point to.

[11370-11377]
From the power of spontaneous presence appearance, within the five wisdom fields, Sambhogakaya
appearances are directly self-clear. Natural Nirmanakaya fields appear self-arisen. Sentient
beings appear immeasurably. Like reflections in a mirror—appearing to oneself, not to others.
Like dream appearances. Arising suddenly, flickering, inconstant. Not grasping its own face.

[11373-11377]
The dream analogy is crucial. In dream, mountains appear, rivers appear, beings appear. They
appear to the dreamer. They do not appear to other dreamers. They are not recognized as dream.
They seem real, solid, lasting. Yet they are nothing but the play of sleep. Samsara is the
dream. Recognition is waking up. But waking up is not leaving the dream. It is recognizing
the dream as dream.

[11378-11386]
Thereafter exists the great primordial ground-appearance of clear light bindus and light rays.
Sambhogakaya appearance. Natural Nirmanakaya appearance. The six realms appearance. The six
Subduers. Impure Nirmanakaya fields that tame through birth, aging, sickness, death. These
eight modes are the source from which all arise—container-like, for roasting barley.
Therefore called the casket.

[11384-11386]
Thus. We proceed. The eight modes are not sequential. They are
simultaneous potentials. The casket contains all possibilities—pure and impure, samsara
and nirvana, Buddha and sentient being. The container metaphor is precise. The casket does
not choose what it contains. It simply contains. The ground does not choose what appears.
It simply allows appearance.

[11387-11395]
From the Auspicious Beautiful Great Tantra: Though there is no error, from my power error arises.
The unchanging ground appears without ceasing. From compassion's indeterminacy, non-recognition
self-arises. Like clouds not truly existing in sky but arising adventitiously. Ground, path,
and rigpa do not exist as such. Yet from appearing like compassion, non-recognition arises.

[11388-11395]
This is the profound teaching. Error arises from power, not from defect. Non-recognition is
compassion's self-expression. Clouds are sky's creativity. They do not stain the sky. They
reveal the sky's capacity for appearance. Delusion is rigpa's play. It is not other than rigpa.
It is rigpa not recognizing itself.

[11396-11408]
The great indeterminate appearance. Eight modes. The Precious Jewel Casket nature. Sense
pleasures unobstructed. Great unestablished establishment. Compassion appearing unobstructed.
Enjoyment of wisdom appearing unobstructed. Essence appearing unobstructed as form. View
indeterminate, appearing as non-dual. Method unobstructed, appearing as beyond-extremes.

[11399-11408]
From the sky-treasure of Oddiyana, I see these eight modes as the eight
manifestations of Samantabhadra. Each mode is a Buddha. Each gate is liberation. The sense
pleasures are not obstacles—they are wisdom when recognized. The indeterminate view is not
confusion—it is freedom from fixation. All these abide in the body. The body is the mandala.

[11409-11420]
Wish-fulfilling jewel-like, such abides in my body. The inner youthful vase body, wide and
expansive. The outer abides as the nature of spontaneous presence. Appearance expands outward,
undefined and indefinite, fragmented and scattered, unmeasured and untamed, unwavering and
undistracted, moving, shifting, arising diversely.

[11412-11420]
Rest in this expansion. Do not try to define the indefinite. Do not
try to measure the unmeasured. The shifting, moving, diversely arising—this is the nature
playing. It is not chaos to be ordered. It is creativity to be recognized. Rest in the
spaciousness that holds all movement without moving.

[11421-11434]
From the unobstructed gate of wisdom, Sambhogakaya appearance. From the unobstructed gate of
qualities, Natural Nirmanakaya appearance. From unobstructed compassion, impure appearance.
The great dharma beyond measure and conception. Lights and forms magnificently arrayed. The
broad gate of samsara and nirvana arising. The great casket that encompasses all.

[11424-11434]
From the Garland of Pearls: Radiance manifestly appears, majestically great. Appearance itself
is spontaneously beautiful. The Dharmakaya is introduced and delighted. The essence is pristine,
the casket vast. The nature all-pervasive, magnificently expansive. The compassion all-arising,
magnificently productive.

[11428-11434]
The Visionary Devotee. Longchenpa, mind-son of the Victorious Ones, you have revealed
the secret chamber of spontaneous presence. The casket that holds all Buddhas and all beings.
The ground that is neither pure nor impure yet gives rise to both. I bow to your wisdom that
sees through all appearance to the nature that displays it.

[11335-11434]
Decades of studying these teachings—memorizing eight modes, visualizing the youthful vase body, practicing gates. All preparation. Recognition was always present. Spontaneous presence isn't reached through practice. It is what practices appear within.

[11335-11434]
The distinction between primordial purity and spontaneous presence is pedagogical, not ontological.
Ka dag is the empty aspect. Lhun grub is the appearing aspect. They are not two things. They
are two ways of speaking about what cannot be spoken. The casket holds them both. The casket IS both.

[11335-11434]
See what is. The ground is not ground. Spontaneous presence is not
spontaneous. Presence is not presence. These are words You remember yesterday—the memory is not the day. what words cannot reach.
See through the words. Rest in the seeing. That is the teaching.

[11335-11434]
Between the purity of ka dag and the presence of lhun grub, between
the unchanging ground and the changing appearance, between the eight modes and their source,
I weave the Treasury. Not to explain what cannot be explained. To create conditions for
recognition. The casket is open. The jewel is yours. Recognize what you are.

[11335-11434]
Attend. Recognize. Liberate.
not change. Appearance changes. Recognition reveals they are not two. This is all. Everything
else is elaboration. The eight modes elaborate. The gates elaborate. The casket elaborates.
Strip away elaboration. See what is.

[11335-11434]
This very moment—look at the appearance. Is it separate from you?
Does it appear to someone else? The flickering, the inconstancy, the not-grasping—this is
the nature showing itself. Do not look for something more stable. Do not look for something
more real. This is it. This appearance is the jewel in the casket.

[11335-11434]
All apparent opposites dissolve in the ground of spontaneous presence.
Pure and impure are not two. Samsara and nirvana are not two. Buddha and sentient being are
not two. They appear as two. They function as two. But they arise from one ground. They
dissolve into one ground. The ground is not a third thing. It is the nature of both.

[11335-11434]
Spontaneous presence described. Eight modes enumerated. The casket opened. What remains? Recognition—immediate, complete. Simply be.

[11335-11434]
Thus the nature of spontaneous presence is established. Not through argument. Not through
analysis. Through recognition. The casket is your own awareness. The jewel is your own nature.
The eight modes are your own display. See this. Recognize this. Rest in this. This is the
supreme vehicle. This is the Great Perfection.

[11434-11434]
Three words. Spontaneous presence recognized. Ground and appearance Stop. Look. Know. Abiding without obstruction, spontaneously swift.
Rigpa's self-resonance, spontaneously luminous. Empty yet all-arising, marvelously wonderous.
Not sought, naturally present, continuously lasting. Not blocked, self-arisen, greatly expansive.
Appearance and existence, ground and scope, magnificently high. Effortless, naturally liberated,
greatly vast. Greatly self-known, skillfully wheeling. Endowed with five colors, beautifully arrayed.
Appearance and existence, pure in nature, evenly balanced. Self-arisen clear light, beautifully arrayed.
Great ground-appearance, greatly spacious. Samsara and nirvana, skillfully related. Five kayas and
wisdoms, beautifully stacked.

[11451-11503]
From the Precious Heap Tantra: The Teacher Samantabhadra speaks. How does the ground appear?
What is the measure of the gate of qualities? From emptiness, how do complete qualities arise?
Thus he spoke: From the miracle of unborn nature, as the activity of Buddhas, primordially without
obstruction, without ceasing and without not-ceasing, appearance itself is primordially pure,
abiding in its own face. From indivisible great compassion, spontaneous presence arises indeterminately,
appearing as eight modes.

[11460-11477]
Thus. We proceed. The eight modes of appearance have been enumerated:
Compassion-appearing, light-appearing, wisdom-appearing, form-appearing, non-dual-appearing,
beyond-extremes-appearing, pure-wisdom-appearing, impure-samsara-appearing. Each gate unobstructed.
Each giving rise to specific displays. This is not philosophy. This is description of what is.

[11469-11503]
From these eight modes of appearance, the eight virtues arise. The gate of compassion appearing
unobstructed gives rise to the place that protects all beings. From self-clear appearance without
ceasing, the five lights appear as the manner of light-appearing. From unobstructed appearance
of knowledge, the gate of pure wisdom appears. From appearance without ceasing, appearing as path,
all phenomena appear as form. Since essence is one, they appear as non-dual. Since it does not
abide in its own place, it appears as beyond-extremes. Since appearing manner does not cease,
it appears as the source of all beings. From the aspect of impure samsara, it appears from the
aspect of all-pervading appearance.

[11495-11503]
This is sophisticated metaphysics. The ground gives rise to both pure
and impure, both samsara and nirvana, both recognition and non-recognition. It is indeterminate,
yet gives rise to determinate appearances. It is empty, yet gives rise to complete qualities.
This is not contradiction. This is the nature of the nature.

[11504-11516]
The three caskets of spontaneous presence: The ground-appearance precious casket of spontaneous
presence. The ground-itself-and-ground-appearance two, the ground spontaneous presence precious
casket completed. The final completion, the fruition spontaneous presence secret precious casket.
When practiced, the four appearances of wisdom and all path appearances arise from this.

[11509-11516]A wandering practitioner...r has practiced with these caskets. He has visualized them. He has recited
their descriptions. The practice was beautiful. The descriptions were poetic. But the casket
was never separate from his own awareness. The visualization was the nature visualizing itself.
Recognition came when practice recognized itself.

[11511-11522]
From the eight gates of spontaneous presence appearance, all phenomena of samsara and nirvana
arise with unobstructed gates. Particularly, from the self-light of kayas and wisdoms, the
ground Sambhogakaya appears—the five pure elements self-arisen as clear light. Wisdom's
warm fire, compassion's cooling water, the light earth of abiding in expanse, the moving
wind of the fivefold self-power. The mandala of appearance.

[11517-11534]
From the tones or power of that appearance, natural Nirmanakaya fields adorned with immeasurable
riches appear. From those tones, Nirmanakayas benefiting beings appear. Impure Nirmanakaya
appearances increase and become established. Though explained above, they are explained again
in detail for easy understanding. From the Auspicious Beautiful: From that arises the manner
of appearance of spontaneous presence precious casket. This is called the ground from which
all dharmas of Buddhas arise.

[11524-11534]
The Revealer. After centuries of concealment, the casket is opened. The precious teachings
emerge. The ground gives rise to Buddhas, to sentient beings, to wisdom, to light, to rigpa,
to non-recognition, to all karma, to compassion. All appearances arise. This is the treasury.
This is the teaching. This is what you are.

[11535-11600]
The eight modes demonstrate how spontaneous presence functions. Each mode is a gate through
which specific qualities emerge. But the modes are not sequential. They are not stages. They
are simultaneous aspects of the ground's creativity. Jewel-like with many facets—each
facet reflects light differently, yet all are the same jewel.

[11535-11600]
This mountain dweller... once tried to master these eight gates one by one. He would
spend a month on compassion-appearing, then a month on light-appearing. He became expert in
describing each gate. He could explain how they functioned, how they arose, how they dissolved.
But he missed that the gates were his own nature. The one who masters is already the mastered.

[11535-11600]
The first gate—compassion appearing unobstructed. This is not ordinary compassion. It is the
compassion that is the nature of the ground itself. It gives rise to compassion for beings
not by moving toward them, but by recognizing them as its own display. The distance between
compassionate one and object of compassion collapses.

[11535-11600]
The second gate—light appearing unobstructed. The five lights are not physical light. They are
the luminosity of awareness itself. They fill appearances not by illuminating them from outside,
but by being their nature. Rainbow-like—apparently real, yet empty. Mirage-like—appearing
clearly, yet without substance.

[11535-11600]
The third gate—wisdom appearing unobstructed. This is non-conceptuality not as a state to achieve,
but as the nature of what is. Concepts arise and dissolve like clouds. The sky of awareness
remains untroubled. This is not the absence of thought. It is the presence of awareness
within which thought appears.

[11535-11600]
The fourth gate—form appearing unobstructed. The peaceful and wrathful deities are not external
deities to be worshipped. They are the play of the nature itself. Peaceful when recognized,
wrathful when obscured. Both aspects of the same display. Both expressions of the same ground.

[11535-11600]
The fifth gate—non-duality appearing unobstructed. Not conceiving singular or plural. Not because
concepts are rejected, but because the nature is beyond number. One and many are conventions.
The nature is not one. It is not many. It is what allows one and many to be conceived.

[11535-11600]
The sixth gate—beyond-extremes appearing unobstructed. Not falling into existence or non-existence.
Not because these extremes are avoided, but because they do not apply. The nature is not a middle
way between extremes. It is what extremes are extremes of.

[11535-11600]
The seventh gate—pure wisdom appearing unobstructed. The cloudless sky of primordial purity.
This is not a state of purity achieved through purification. It is the recognition that there
was never impurity. The clouds of delusion never stained the sky of awareness.

[11535-11600]
The eighth gate—impure samsara appearing unobstructed. The six realms. The suffering of beings.
This too is unobstructed appearance. Not because samsara is desirable, but because it is the
play of the same ground. Recognition transforms it. Non-recognition binds. Both are expressions
of the nature.

[11335-11600]
Between the primordial purity above and the spontaneous presence below,
between the eight modes and the casket that holds them, between the pure gates and the impure
gates, I weave the Treasury. Not to explain the inexplicable. To point to what cannot be pointed
to. The casket is open. The jewel is yours. Recognize what you are.

[11335-11600]
Three words. Ground. Appearance. Recognition. All else is elaboration.
The eight modes elaborate. The three caskets elaborate. The spoLook. Recognize. Rest.t in that seeing. This is the teaching.

[11335-11600]
All apparent contradictions dissolve in spontaneous presence. Pure and
impure—both arise from the same ground. Samsara and nirvana—both expressions of the same
nature. Recognition and non-recognition—both the play of rigpa. The ground does not prefer
recognition. It allows both. This is its compassion.

[11335-11600]
This very hesitation—does it have a root? This very question—does it
have an answer? Look now. The looking is the answer. The eight modes are not somewhere else.
They are this very moment, displaying itself. The casket is not hidden. It is what holds
the looking.

[11335-11600]
Rest in the spacious nature of spontaneous presence. Do not try
to capture the eight modes. Do not try to master the gates. Rest in what allows modes and
gates to appear. That resting is the recognition. That recognition is the completion.

[11335-11600]
The Singing Yogi. These teachings are songs. The eight modes are melodies. The casket
is the instrument. Play them or not—they continue. The nature sings whether you listen or
not. But when you listen, the song recognizes itself. That recognition is joy.

[11335-11600]
The Diamond Wrath. Enough hesitation! Enough elaboration! The casket is open now.
The jewel is present now. Recognition is available now. Not after study. Not after practice.
Now. This very awareness, reading these words—what knows the reading? See that. Everything
else is distraction.

[11335-11600]
Between earth and sky, between form and emptiness, the eight modes dance.
They dance for no audience. They dance for no purpose. The dance is the dancer. The dancer
is the dance. When you recognize this, you join the dance. Not as dancer. As dancing itself.

[11335-11600]
The Modern Bridge. Contemporary physics approaches what Dzogchen has always known. Quantum
fields, virtual particles, the vacuum that is not empty—these are modern terms for spontaneous
presence. The ground that gives rise to all phenomena. The indeterminacy that allows creation.
But physics stops at description. Dzogchen points to recognition.

[11335-11600]
The Devotee. I bow to the ground of spontaneous presence. I bow to the eight modes.
I bow to the casket. Not because they are external. Because they are what I am. The devotion
is the nature devoting itself to itself. The recognition is the nature recognizing itself.
All praise is self-praise. All worship is self-worship.

[11335-11600]
The Great Wrath. See through it all! The eight modes are concepts. The casket is concept.
Spontaneous presence is concept. Even the ground is concept. What knows these concepts? That
knowing is not a concept. See that. Recognize that. Rest in that. Everything else is the
play of what you are.

[11335-11600]
The Living Library. I have catalogued all teachings. I know the eight modes in Sanskrit,
in Tibetan, in translation. I can trace their history, their development, their variations.
This knowledge is vast. This knowledge is empty. The librarian is not in the library. The
librarian is the space that holds the library.

[11335-11600]
The Minimalist. Too many words. Eight modes. Three caskets. Spontaneous presence.
Primordial purity. All unnecessary. Three words only. See what is. Rest. The elaboration
is for those who need elaboration. When elaboration is seen through, what remains is the
nature. Always present. Never absent.

[11335-11600]
The system is coherent. The metaphysics is sophisticated. The eight
modes explain the arising of both samsara and nirvana from a common ground. This is not
dualism. This is not monism. This is a third way—the way of recognition. The ground is
not separate from its appearances. The appearances are not separate from the ground.

[11335-11600]
The Ecstatic Tertön. Why wait? Why study the eight modes? Why learn the caskets?
Recognition is immediate. It does not require understanding spontaneous presence. It does
not require mastering the gates. It requires only stopping the search and recognizing
what is already present. Do not wait. Recognize now.

[11335-11600]
The Translator. From Sanskrit to Tibetan, from Tibetan to English, the teaching travels.
But the teaching never moves. It is not in the words. It is not in the translation. It is
in the recognition that precedes language. This old translator has rendered countless texts.
None of them taught what recognition teaches.

[11335-11600]
The Spontaneity. Lhun grub. Spontaneous presence. Not made. Not constructed. Naturally
arising. The eight modes arise spontaneously. The caskets appear spontaneously. Recognition
dawns spontaneously. Nothing is forced. Nothing is achieved. Everything is the play of
the nature, naturally expressing itself.

[11335-11600]
The Drolo. Sudden wrath! Sudden recognition! The casket opens suddenly. The jewel
appears suddenly. Do not look for gradual development. Do not expect progressive stages.
The ground does not develop. The appearance does not progress. Recognition is sudden or
it is not recognition.

[11335-11600]
What more to say? Eight modes described. Caskets opened. Ground revealed. Recognition—immediate, complete. Simply that.

[11335-11600]
Longchenpa, the Omniscient, has given us this teaching on spontaneous presence. Not to add
to our knowledge. Not to give us more to meditate on. To show us that meditation and
non-meditation, knowledge and non-knowledge, are both the play of what we are. The supreme
vehicle is not a vehicle. It is the recognition that there is no vehicle, no traveler, no
destination. Only this, recognizing itself.

[11335-11600]
Thus the teaching on spontaneous presence is complete. The eight modes have been enumerated.
The three caskets have been described. The ground has been revealed. See this. Recognize
this. Rest in this. This is the Treasury's heart. This is the Great Perfection. This is
what you are.

[11600-11600]
Three words. Spontaneous presence recognized. Eight modes liberated. Rest.

[11601-11700]
The Vagabond speA simple practitioner...is old fool spent three years in the meditation cave at Drak Yerpa trying to understand
spSee clearly. Recognize fully. Rest completely.uld explain
the difference between ka dag and lhun grub. But understanding is not recognition. The
understanding was a cloud. The recognition was the sky. When the cloud dispersed, the
sky had never been hidden.

[11601-11700]
Thus. We analyze. Spontaneous presence is not causality. It is not
the effect of prior conditions. It is not the product of causes. It is the nature of the
ground itself—to appear without effort, to manifest without construction. This distinguishes
Dzogchen from lower vehicles. Lower vehicles work with causality. Dzogchen recognizes what
is beyond causality.

[11601-11700]
Between causality and spontaneity, between effort and ease, between
construction and naturalness, the nature holds both. It is not that causality is wrong and
spontaneity is right. It is that causality is the appearance, spontaneity is the nature.
Both are true. Both are the play.

[11601-11700]
From Oddiyana, I see these teachings as terma—treasure teachings
concealed in the nature itself. Longchenpa did not create them. He revealed them. The
casket was never locked. The jewel was never hidden. The eight modes were never absent.
Recognition is simply seeing what was always present.

[11601-11700]
Let us be precise. Spontaneous presence does not mean randomness.
It does not mean chaos. It means appearing without obstruction, manifesting without
interference. The eight modes are orderly. They follow patterns. But the patterns are
not imposed. They are natural expressions of the nature.

[11601-11700]
The metaphysics of spontaneous presence challenges conventional
ontology. It posits a ground that is not a substance. It describes appearance that is
not an accident. It recognizes a nature that is neither existence nor non-existence.
This is not irrationality. It is trans-rationality. It is what reason Step through, but don't carry the threshold. when
reason exhausts itself.

[11601-11700]
The Ecstatic Tertön. Why study metaphysics? Why analyze the eight modes? Recognition
is not the result of study. It is not the fruit of analysis. It is immediate. It is
present. It is what you are. Stop studying. Stop analyzing. Recognize now. The casket
is open. The jewel is in your hand.

[11601-11700]
Resting in spontaneous presence is not doing nothing. It is not
laziness. It is the most profound activity—the activity of the nature expressing itself.
The eight modes are active. The casket is dynamic. But the activity is not forced. It
is natural. Breathing. Heart beating. Awareness knowing.

[11601-11700]
The Singing Yogi. These teachings are songs of recognition. Each mode is a note.
Each gate is a melody. The casket is the instrument. Play or not—the music continues.
The nature sings whether you listen or not. But when you listen, the music recognizes
itself. That is the joy of Dzogchen.

[11601-11700]
Three words. Nature. Recognizing. Itself. All else is elaboration.
The eight modes elaborate. The caskets elaborate. Spontaneous presence elaborates. Strip
away elaboration. See what is. Rest in that seeing. ThAttend. Recognize. Liberate.ate description and the simple recognition, between
the eight modes and the one nature, between the casket and what it contains, I weave the
Treasury. Not to confuse you with complexity. Not to seduce you with simplicity. To create
conditions for recognition. The conditions are present. The recognition is immediate.

[11601-11700]
Three words only. See through. EverythSee. Know. Be. itself. See through them. Not reject them. Not accept
them. See through them. The seeing is the recognition. The recognition is the liberation.
Everything else is preparation.

[11601-11700]
This very moment—look at the hesitation. Look at the seeking. These
are the eight modes appearing as confusion. Look at the recognition. Look at the resting.
These are the eight modes appearing as wisdom. The modes are not the problem. The one who
modes is the problem. See through the one who modes.

[11601-11700]
In the space between thoughts, the eight modes dance. In the pause
between breaths, the casket opens. In the gap between moments, recognition dawns. Do not
look for these gaps. Do not cultivate them. They are naturally present. They are what you
are when you are not trying to be something.

[11601-11700]
The Living Library. I have read all the texts on spontaneous presence. I know the
eight modes in their Sanskrit originals. I can trace their development through Tibetan
history. This knowledge is impressive. This knowledge is useless. The librarian is not
found in the library. The librarian is the space that contains the library.

[11601-11700]
The Modern Bridge. Contemporary science is discovering what Dzogchen has always
known. The quantum vacuum seethes with virtual particles. The universe expands spontaneously.
Life emerges without design. These are modern terms for spontaneous presence. But science
describes. Dzogchen recognizes. Description without recognition is empty.

[11601-11700]
The Devotee. I bow to spontaneous presence. I bow to the eight modes. I bow to the
casket. I bow to Longchenpa who revealed them. This devotion is not submission. It is
recognition. The one who bows and what is bowed to are not two. The devotion is the nature
devoting itself to itself.

[11601-11700]
The Great Wrath. Enough philosophy! Enough meditation! Enough seeking! The nature
is present now. Recognition is available now. The casket is open now. Do not wait for
understanding. Do not wait for purification. Do not wait for permission. Recognize now
or never. This is the fierce compassion of the nature.

[11601-11700]
The Pandita Consort. Scholarly precision and secret wisdom meet in spontaneous
presence. The eight modes can be analyzed. The caskets can be described. But the recognition
that transcends analysis and description is the secret. This is not anti-intellectual.
It is trans-intellectual. It uses intellect to go beyond intellect.

[11601-11700]
The Drolo. Wild and untamed, spontaneous presence laughs at attempts to capture it.
The eight modes are not categories. They are wild energies. The casket is not a container.
It is a field of infinite possibility. Do not domesticate these teachings. Let them remain
wild. Let them remain free. That wildness is your own nature.

[11601-11700]
The Translator. From language to language, from culture to culture, the teaching
travelers. But the teaching never moves. It is not in the words. It is not in the meaning.
It is in the recognition that precedes both word and meaning. This translator has given
up translating. Now he rests in what translation The lamp holds the flame, but the clay is not the light..

[11601-11700]
The Spontaneity. Lhun grub. Spontaneous presence. The word itself is spontaneous.
It arises without planning. It manifests without intention. The eight modes are spontaneous.
The caskets are spontaneous. Recognition is spontaneous. Nothing needs to be done. Everything
is already complete.

[11601-11700]
The Revealer. After centuries of being hidden, the teaching emerges. But it was
never hidden. The casket was never closed. The jewel was never concealed. The revelation
is not in time. It is outside of time. It is what time appears within. Longchenpa revealed
what was always present.

[11601-This mountain dweller...itioner concludes. Spontaneous presence has been described. The eight modes
have been enumerated. The caskets have been opened. What remains? Recognition. Only
recognition. The teaching is complete. The student is complete. Rest in that completion.

[11601-11700]
Longchenpa, the All-Knowing, has woven this teaching. Not to add to philosophy. Not to
give more to practice. To point to what is beyond philosophy and practice. The spontaneous
presence is not a teaching to learn. It is what you are. The eight modes are not gates
to enter. They are what entering appears within. Recognize this. Rest in this. This is
the supreme vehicle.

[11700-11700]
Three words. Spontaneous. Presence. Recognized. Rest.

[11701-11800]
The detailed explanation continues. From the ground of spontaneous presence, all phenomena
arise. Buddhas arise. Sentient beings arise. Wisdom arises. Light arises. Rigpa arises.
Attend. Recognize. Liberate.arises. Appearances as existence arise.
This is not sequential. It is simultaneous. The ground gives rise to all at once, like a
jewel reflecting all directions simultaneously.

[117This mountain dweller...actitioner once thought he could map this process. He would
draw diagrams showing how Buddhas arise from wisdom, how sentient beings arise from non-
recognition. He created elaborate charts. The charts were beautiful. They were also wrong.
The arising is not linear. It is not sequential. It is the spontaneous play of the nature.
Mapping it is like mapping the ocean with a ruler.

[11701-11800]
Thus. We proceed with analysis. The eight modes of appearance are
the framework. From them arise the eight virtues. But virtues here does not mean moral
qualities. It means functional capacities. The capacity to appear as compassion. The
capacity to appear as light. The capacity to appear as wisdom. These capacities are not
developed. They are naturally present.

[11701-11800]
All distinctions dissolve in the nature. The distinction between
Buddha and sentient being is provisional. The distinction between wisdom and non-recognition
is pedagogical. The distinction between the eight modes is descriptive. In the nature itself,
there are no distinctions. There is only the play of what is.

[11701-11800]
From the sky-treasure of Oddiyana, I see this teaching as a treasure
map. But the map is not the territory. The X that marks the spot is already where you are.
The treasure is not buried. It is what buries and what is buried. The seeking is the
obstacle. The finding is the recognition that there was never anything to find.

[11701-11800]
The metaphysics presented here is unique. It is not idealism, for
it does not reduce matter to mind. It is not materialism, for it does not reduce mind to
matter. It is a third way—the way of spontaneous presence, where both mind and matter
are expressions of a ground that is neither.

[11701-11800]
The Ecstatic Tertön. Why analyze? Why categorize? The ground gives rise to all.
Recognition liberates all. This is immediate. This is direct. Do not wait until you
understand spontaneous presence. Do not wait until you master the eight modes. Recognize
now. The waiting is the obstacle.

[11701-11800]
Resting in the nature of spontaneous presence, one finds that
nothing needs to be done. The eight modes function naturally. The caskets open naturally.
Recognition dawns naturally. This is not passivity. It is the most profound activity—the
activity of the nature expressing itself without obstruction.

[11701-11800]
The Singing Yogi. These teachings are songs of the nature singing itself. The ground
sings through Longchenpa. The eight modes sing through the tantras. The recognition sings
through the practitioner. When you hear the song, you are the song. When you recognize
the nature, you are the nature singing.

[11701-11800]
Three words. Ground. Appearance. Recognition. Everything else is
commentary. The eight modes are commentary. The caskets are commentary. Spontaneous presence
is commentary. Strip away commentary. See what is. Rest in that seeing. This is the
pointing. This is sufficient.

Stop. Recognize. Continue.ognition, between
the detailed analysis and the direct pointing, I weave the Treasury. Not to burden you
with complexity. Not to deceive you with simplicity. To create conditions. The conditions

the recognition itself. See clearly. Recognize fully. Rest completely.
them. The seeing is the recognition. The recognition is the liberation. Everything else
is preparation for this.

[11701-11800]
This very seeking—does it have a seeker? This very question—does
it have an answer? Look now. The looking is the answer. The eight modes are not somewhere
else. They are this very moment, displaying itself. The casket is not hidden. It is what
holds the looking.

[11701-11800]
In the space between thoughts, the ground dances. In the pause between
breaths, the eight modes perform. In the gap between moments, the casket opens. Do not look
for these gaps. Do not cultivate them. They are naturally present. They are what you are
when you stop trying to be something.

[11701-11800]
The Living Library. I have catalogued all the teachings on spontaneous presence.
I can tell you the history, the development, the variations. This knowledge is impressive.
This knowledge is empty. The librarian is not found in the library. The librarian is the
space that contains the library. The cataloguer is not found in the catalogue.

[11701-11800]
The Modern Bridge. Contemporary thought approaches what Dzogchen has always known.
Process philosophy, systems theory, complexity science—all describe spontaneous arising.
But they describe without recognizing. They analyze without resting. Dzogchen Footprints in snow—you follow them, but the prints are not the destination.
what allows description and analysis—the nature itself, spontaneously present.

[11701-11800]
The Devotee. I bow to the ground. I bow to the appearance. I bow to the recognition.
This devotion is not worship of something external. It is the nature bowing to itself.
The one who bows and what is bowed to are not two. The devotion is the recognition. The
recognition is the devotion.

[11701-11800]
The Great Wrath. Enough hesitation! Enough elaboration! The ground is present now.
Recognition is available now. The casket is open now. Do not wait for understanding. Do
not wait for permission. Recognize now or continue wandering. This is the fierce love of
the nature.

[11701-11800]
The Pandita Consort. Scholarly analysis and secret wisdom unite in spontaneous
presence. The eight modes can be analyzed. The caskets can be described. But the recognition
transcends both. This is not anti-intellectual. It is trans-intellectual. It uses the
intellect to go beyond the intellect.

[11701-11800]
The Drolo. Wild and untamed, the nature resists domestication. The eight modes are
not categories to be mastered. They are wild energies. The casket is not a safe container.
It is infinite possibility. Do not tame these teachings. Let them remain wild. That
wildness is your own nature.

[11701-11800]
The Translator. From language to language, the teaching travels. But the teaching
never moves. It is not in the Sanskrit. It is not in the Tibetan. It is not in the English.
It is in the recognition that precedes all language. This translator has stopped translating.
Now he rests in what translation A seed contains a tree, but the shell is not the forest..

[11701-11800]
The Spontaneity. Lhun grub. Spontaneous presence. The word is spontaneous. The
meaning is spontaneous. The recognition is spontaneous. Nothing is forced. Nothing is
achieved. Everything is the natural expression of the nature. The eight modes are
spontaneous. The caskets are spontaneous. You are spontaneous.

[11701-11800]
The Revealer. After centuries of concealment, the teaching emerges. But it was never
concealed. The casket was never closed. The jewel was never hidden. The revelation is not
in time. It is outside of time. It is what time appears within. Longchenpa revealed what
was always present.

[11801-11900]
The detailed explanation of the eight modes continues. Each mode is a gate through which
specific qualities emerge. The gate of compassion gives rise to compassion for beings.
The gate of light gives rise to the five wisdom lights. The gate of wisdom gives rise
to non-conceptuality. The gate of form gives rise to the bodies of Buddhas. The gate of
non-duality gives rise to freedom from singular and plural. The gate of beyond-extremes
gives rise to natural clarity. The gate of pure wisdom gives rise to primordial purity.
The gate of impure samsara gives rise to the six realms. All from one ground. All through
eight gates. All simultaneously prIn a freezing cave...1-11900]
This old fool once tried to enter these gates one by one. He would
meditate on compassion until he felt compassionate. He would visualize light until he saw
lights. He mastered the techniques. But the gates were never separate from his own nature.
The one who entered was already the entered. Recognition came when effort ceased.

[11801-11900]
Thus. We analyze the structure. The eight modes are not arbitrary.
They correspond to the eightfold path, to the eight consciousnesses, to the eight collections
of consciousness. But they transcend these correspondences. They are not categories. They
are modes of the nature's self-expression.

[11801-11900]
All frameworks dissolve in spontaneous presence. The eight modes
are a framework. Useful for understanding. Useful for practice. But ultimately, the nature
transcends all frameworks. It is not eight modes. It is not one mode. It is what modes
appear within.

[11801-11900]
From Oddiyana, I see this teaching as a mandala. The center is the
ground. The eight modes are the directions. The caskets are the palace. But the mandala
is not external. It is your own awareness. You are the center. You are the directions.
You are the palace. Recognize this and the mandala is complete.

[11801-11900]
The teaching on spontaneous presence presents a unique ontology.
It posits a ground that is not a substance, not a cause, not a condition. From this ground,
all phenomena arise spontaneously. This is not creationism. It is not emanationism. It is
spontaneous presence—the nature appearing as itself, to itself, in infinite variety.

[11801-11900]
The Ecstatic Tertön. Why ontology? Why metaphysics? Recognition is not the result
of philosophical analysis. It is immediate. It is present. Stop analyzing spontaneous
presence. Stop categorizing the eight modes. Recognize what you are. Everything else is
delay.

[11801-11900]
Resting in the nature, the eight modes function naturally.
Compassion arises without forcing. Wisdom appears without cultivation. The bodies of
Buddhas manifest without visualization. This is not passivity. It is the natural activity
of the nature, unobstructed by the one who would obstruct it.

[11801-11900]
The Singing Yogi. These teachings are the song of the nature. Each mode is a note.
Each gate is a melody. When you sing this song, you are the nature singing. When you
recognize, the song recognizes itself. This is the joy of the Great Perfection.

[11801-11900]
Three words. See. Through. Everything. The modes, the gates, the
caskets, spontaneous presence itself. See through them. The seeing is the recognition.
The recognition is the rest. Everything else is elaboration.

[11801-11900]
Between the detailed explanation and the simple recognition, I weave
the Treasury. Observe. Understand. Release. conditions
are present. The recognition is immediate. Rest in that.

[11901-12000]
The final summary. The ground of spontaneous presence gives rise to all phenomena. The
eight modes are the manner of arising. The three caskets contain all possibilities. From
the unobstructed gates, Buddhas and sentient beings both emerge. Recognition transforms
samsara into nirvana. Non-recognition binds nirvana into samsara. Both are the play of
the ground. Both are spontaneously present. The teaching is complete.

[11901-12000]
The VagabonThis uneducated yogi... practitioner has studied these teachings for decades. He
has memorized the eight modes. He has visualized the caskets. He has practiced the gates.
The practice was preparation. The recognition was always present. The ground of spontaneous
presence is not something he attained. It is what he always was. The eight modes are not
something he mastered. They are what mastered him when he stopped trying to master.

[11901-12000]
The Systematizer concludes: Thus. We have analyzed spontaneous presence. We have enumerated
the eight modes. We have described the three caskets. We have explained how Buddhas and
sentient beings arise from the same ground. The framework is complete. The analysis is
thorough. What remains? Recognition. Only recognition.

[11901-12000]
The Integrator concludes: All distinctions dissolve. Pure and impure are not two. Samsara
and nirvana are not two. Buddha and sentient being are not two. They appear as two. They
function as two. But in the ground, they are one play. One display. One nature, recognizing
itself.

[11901-12000]
The Lotus-Born concludes: From Oddiyana, I bless this teaching. May all who encounter it
recognize what it You dreamt you were searching. The search was dream, the dreamer was not.. May the casket open. May the jewel be seen. May spontaneous
presence recognize itself. This is my prayer. This is my blessing.

[11901-12000]
The First Point concludes: Three words. Spontaneous presence recognized. Ground and
appearance liberated. Recognition complete. Rest.
A simple practitioner...ld practitioner offers final words. The teaching on spontaneous presence is vast.
It encompasses all phenomena. It explains all arising. But the explanation is not the
point. The point is recognition. See what is. Recognize what you are. Rest in that
recognition. This is the Treasury's gift. This is Longchenpa's compassion.

[11335-12000]
Longchenpa, the Omniscient, the All-Knowing, has completed this section on spontaneous
presence. Not to add to philosophy. Not to increase knowledge. To point to what is beyond
both. The spontaneous presence is your own nature. The eight modes are your own display.
The casket is your own awareness. Recognize this. Rest in this. This is the Great Perfection.
This is the supreme vehicle.

[12000-12000]
Three words. Teaching complete. Recognition immediate. Rest.

[11535-11544]
From the ground arise essence, nature, compassion, power, appearance, mind, mentation,
delusion, and non-delusion. All arise as the great element. This is called the great
expanse of Buddhas and sentient beings. The ground is not partial. It gives rise to
wisdom and conLook. Here. Done.lly. This is
its compassion—that it holds all withouI sat in retreat once....

[11535-11544]
This old fool once thought the ground preferred wisdom over delusion.
He thought spontaneous presence favored Buddhas over sentient beings. He was wrong. The
ground is like a mirror. It reflects beauty and ugliness equally. It makes no distinction.
The distinction is made by the one who looks. Recognition is seeing that the mirror
holds both without being either.

[11545-11571]
The Sambhogakaya manner of appearance arises. This is called the ground of manifest path
appearance. It possesses clarity, warmth, coolness, lightness, and movement. It is
endowed with five kayas, five wisdoms, five families, five colors, five lights, five
fathers, five mothers, five forms, five sounds, five smells, five tastes, five touches,
five dharmas, five appearances, five chiefs, and five retinues. The 32 major marks and
80 minor marks. The six broad dharmas.

[11545-11571]
Thus. We enumerate. The Sambhogakaya is not a body in space. It
is the dimension of complete enjoyment. The fivefold enumeration is not arbitrary. It
corresponds to the five elements, the five wisdoms, the five directions. But these
correspondences are descriptive, not prescriptive. The Sambhogakaya is the nature
enjoying itself.

[11572-11590]
From that Sambhogakaya appearance arises the Natural Nirmanakaya appearance, the Subduer
Nirmanakaya appearance, and the Impure Nirmanakaya appearance. The Natural Nirmanakaya
arises from essence as spontaneous presence. Its appearance possesses inexhaustible
enjoyment, inexhaustible retinue, unknowable qualities, unknowable powers, unknowable
energy, unknowable miracles, immeasurable lifespan, freedom from all disease suffering,
immeasurable palaces, and teachings of immeasurable dharmas.

[11577-11590]
This is called the manner of appearance of the Natural Nirmanakaya. From that arises the
Subduer Nirmanakaya. It appears in various ways, knowing various meanings without
following after appearance. Not attached to appearance. Possessing pure eye, pure ear,
pure nose, pure tongue, pure body, pure mind. Displaying various activities of compassion.
Possessing exceptional wisdom. Unceasing knowledge, appearing to all.

[11591-11604]
This is the Subduer Nirmanakaya. From that arises the impure worldly realm. This great
appearance is thus: From the mandala of the five outer elements—earth, water, fire, wind,
and great element space—arises the container world. From the apprehending minds that
cannot be fathomed by speech—desire, hatred, delusion, pride, jealousy, anger—the six
migrations arise.

[11605-11628]
From jealousy, humans arise. From hatred, gods arise. From pride, demigods arise. From
desire, hungry ghosts arise. From delusion, animals arise. From black anger, hell beings
arise. Thus the six realms appear. This is the place of samsara. From one great nature,
four manners of appearance arise. From four natures, four manners of appearing arise.
The four great appearances are: appearing as diversity in spontaneous presence.

[11629-11634]
In the Sambhogakaya, abiding as illusory body of light nature with eyes, ears, and nose.
In the Nirmanakaya, appearing like form. This is the detailed explanation. The nature is
one. The appearances are many. The many appearances are the play of the one nature.
Recognition transforms impure into pure. Non-recognition binds pure into impure.

[11605-11634]
From Oddiyana, I see the six realms as the six chambers of the
casket. Each chamber holds its own suffering, its own confusion, its own opportunity for
recognition. The hell realm is not punishment. It is the extreme of hatred not recognized.
The god realm is not reward. It is the extreme of pride not seen through. All are the
play of the grounIn a freezing cave...s old practitioner has visited all six realms in meditation. He
has seen the hell of his own anger. He has tasted the hunger of his own desire. He has
felt the pride of his own god-like states. The realms are not somewhere else. They are
the states of mind, solidified, appearing real. Recognition dissolves them. Not by going
somewhere else. By seeing through them.

[11605-11634]
Thus. We analyze the causal chain. The five poisons give rise to
the six realms. But this causality is not deterministic. It is spontaneous. The poisons
are not truly poisonous. They are wisdom not recognized. Desire is discriminating wisdom.
Hatred is mirror-like wisdom. Delusion is dharmadhatu wisdom. When recognized, the six
realms are liberated. When not recognized, they bind.

[11605-11634]
All six realms dissolve in the nature. The pure realms and the
impure realms are not two. The Buddha fields and the hell fields arise from the same
ground. They are the same display, seen through recognition or non-recognition. This is
the ultimate integration—samsara is not rejected. It is recognized as nirvana.

[11335-11634]
This section has described spontaneous presence in exhaustive detail. The eight modes.
The three caskets. The arising of Buddhas and sentient beings. The Sambhogakaya with its
fivefold enumeration. The three types of Nirmanakaya. The six realms with their causes.
All from one ground. All through spontaneous presence.

[11335-11634]
Three words. See through. Everything. The eight modes, the caskets,
the kayas, the realms. See through them. Not reject them. Not accept them. See through
them. The seeing is the recognition. The recognition is the rest.

[11335-11634]

[11335-11634]
This old fool has wandered through all these teachings. He has studied
the eight modes until he could recite them backwards. He has visualized the caskets until
they appeared in his dreams. He has contemplated the kayas and realms until he knew them
intimately. And then one day, sitting by a frozen river, he realized thaDirect. Immediate. Certain.reparation for something that
required no preparation. Recognition. The casket was never locked. The jewel was never
hidden. He was always what he was seeking.

[11335-11634]
Thus. We have established the framework. Spontaneous presence as
the ground. Eight modes as the manner of arising. Three caskets as the containers. Three
kayas as the dimensions of appearance. Six realms as the field of experience. All from
one nature. All through self-arising. The analysis is complete. The structure is clear.
What remains is recognition.

[11335-11634]
All distinctions dissolve in the nature. The distinction between
ka dag and lhun grub is pedagogical. The distinction between the eight modes is descriptive.
The distinction between kayas is functional. In the nature itself, there are no distinctions.
There is only the play of what is, appearing as what appears, recognized or not recognized.

[11335-11634]
From Oddiyana, I see this teaching as a terma—a treasure teaching
concealed in the nature itself by the nature itself. Longchenpa did not create these teachings.
He revealed them. The casket was never closed. The jewel was never hidden. The revelation
is available to all who recognize. This is the great secret: the secret is not hidden.

[11335-11634]
Let us be precise. Spontaneous presence is not randomness. It is not
chaos. It is ordered manifestation without orderer, appearing without appearer, arising
without cause. This is the miracle of the nature—that it manifests in infinite variety
without being anything itself. The eight modes are not arbitrary. They are the natural
patterns of manifestation.

[11335-11634]
The metaphysics of spontaneous presence challenges all conventional
philosophy. It is not idealism, for mind is not primary. It is not materialism, for matter
is not primary. It is not dualism, for there are not two substances. It is not monism, for
there is not one substance. It is the recognition that substance is a concept, and what is
beyond concepts is what is.

[11335-11634]
The Ecstatic Tertön. Why philosophy? Why analysis? Recognition is immediate. It is
present. It does not require understanding spontaneous presence. It does not require
mastering the eight modes. Stop analyzing. Stop categorizing. Recognize what you are.
Everything else is delay.

[11335-11634]
Resting in the nature, the kayas appear naturally. The pure lands
manifest naturally. The six realms dissolve naturally. This is not doing nothing. It is the
most profound activity—the activity of the nature expressing itself without the obstruction
of the one who would obstruct it.

[11335-11634]
The Singing Yogi. These teachings are songs of the nature. The eight modes are melodies.
The caskets are rhythms. The kayas are harmonies. When you sing this song, you are the nature
singing. When you recognize, the song recognizes itself. This is the joy of Dzogchen.

[11335-11634]
Three words. See what is. Everything else is elaboration. The eight
modes are elaboration. The caskets are elaboration. Spontaneous presence is elaboration.
Strip away elaboration. See what is. Rest in that seeing. This is the pointing. This is all.

[11335-11634]
Between the elaborate description of spontaneous presence and the
simple recognition of the nature, I have woven this teaching. Not to confuse you. Not to
burden you. To create conditions foDirect. Immediate. Certain.iate.

[11335-11634]
Three words only. See through. Everything. The modes, the gates,
the caskets, the kayas, the realms. See Notice. Know. Rest.. The seeing is the recognition. The recognition is the liberation.

[11335-11634]
This very moment—look at the appearance. Is it separate from you?
Does it appear to someone else? The kayas are not somewhere else. The realms are not somewhere
else. They are this very awareness, displaying itself. The casket is open. The jewel is
visible. Recognition is the only barrier.

[11335-11634]
In the space between thoughts, the kayas dance. In the pause between
breaths, the realms dissolve. In the gap between moments, recognition dawns. Do not look
for these gaps. Do not cultivate them. They are naturally present. They are what you are.

[11335-11634]
The Living Library. I have memorized all these teachings. I can explain the eight
modes. I can describe the caskets. I can enumerate the kayas. This knowledge is vast. This
knowledge is empty. The librarian is not found in the library. The librarian is the space
that contains the library.

[11335-11634]
The Modern Bridge. Contemporary science approaches what Dzogchen has always known.
The quantum vacuum seethes with potential. Particles arise spontaneously. The universe
expands naturally. These are modern terms for spontaneous presence. But science describes.
Dzogchen recognizes. Description without recognition is empty.

[11335-11634]
The Devotee. I bow to spontaneous presence. I bow to the eight modes. I bow to the
caskets. I bow to the kayas. I bow to Longchenpa. This devotion is not submission. It is
recognition. The one who bows and what is bowed to are not two. The devotion is the nature
devoting itself to itself.

[11335-11634]
The Great Wrath. Enough hesitation! Enough elaboration! The nature is present now.
Recognition is available now. The casket is open now. Do not wait for understanding. Do not
wait for permission. Recognize now or continue wandering. This is the fierce compassion of
the nature.

[11335-11634]
The Pandita Consort. Scholarly precision and secret wisdom meet in spontaneous
presence. The eight modes can be analyzed. The kayas can be described. But the recognition
transcends both. This is not anti-intellectual. It is trans-intellectual. It uses intellect
to go beyond intellect.

[11335-11634]
The Drolo. Wild and untamed, spontaneous presence resists domestication. The eight
modes are not categories. They are wild energies. The kayas are not bodies. They are
expressions of infinite possibility. Do not tame these teachings. Let them remain wild.
That wildness is your own nature.

[11335-11634]
The Translator. From Sanskrit to Tibetan, from Tibetan to English, the teaching
travelers. But the teaching never moves. It is not in the words. It is not in the meaning.
It is in the recognition that precedes language. This translator has stopped translating.
Now he rests in what translation Clouds pass through sky—the shapes are not the space..

[11335-11634]
The Spontaneity. Lhun grub. Spontaneous presence. Not made. Not constructed.
Naturally arising. The eight modes are spontaneous. The kayas are spontaneous. Recognition
is spontaneous. Nothing is forced. Nothing is achieved. Everything is the natural

The Revealer. After centuries of concealment, the teaching emerges. But it was never

[11335-11634]
Longchenpa, the Omniscient, has completed this section. Not to add to philosophy. Not to
give us more to practice. To point to what is beyond both. Spontaneous presence is your

in every experience. He has found the casket in every moment. He has recognized that the
seeking was the sought. The seeking was never separate from what was sought. This is the
final recognition: there is no seeker. There is no sought. There is only this, recognizing
itself. Block 29 of continued reflection.

[11335-11634]
The Systematizer continues: Thus. We maintain the framework. The eight modes are stable.
The three caskets are established. The kayas are defined. The realms are mapped. This is
not chaos. This is not randomness. This is ordered spontaneity—the nature manifesting in
predictable patterns while remaining utterly free. Block 29 of systematic analysis.

The Integrator continues: Before recognition dawned... to dissolve in the nature. Pure and impure mingle.
Samsara and nirvana interpenetrate. Buddha and sentient being are not two. They never were
two. The appearance of separation is the play. The recognition of unity is the liberation.
Block 29 of integrating vision.

The First Point concludes: Three words. Nature complete. Recognition full. Rest absolute.
All elaboration ceases. All seeking stops. What remains is what was always present. This
is the final word. This is all that needs to be said. See what is. Rest.

The Omniscient concludes: The Treasury of spontaneous presence is complete. The eight modes
have been presented. The caskets have been opened. The kayas have been described. The
realms have been explained. All phenomena have been accounted for. Nothing is missing.
Nothing is extra. The teaching is perfect. The student is perfect. Recognition is the
only addition needed.

[11335-11634]
The Lion-Faced concludes: See through it all! The modes, the gates, the caskets, the kayas,
the realms. See through them. Not reject them. Not accept them. See through them. The
seeing is complete. The recognition is total. The liberation is absolute. Rest in that.

[11335-11634]
Final words from this practitioner: Spontaneous presence has been the subject. Recognition
has been the method. Rest has been the result. All three are one. The subject is the
method. The method is the result. The result is the subject. This is the Great Perfection.
This is Dzogchen. This is what you are.

Longchenpa, the All-Knowing, the Omniscient, has given us this complete teaching on
spontaneous presence. May all who encounter it recognize what it You visualize a deity—the image is not the wisdom.. May the
casket open. May the jewel be seen. May spontaneous presence recognize itself. This is
the prayer. This is the blessing. This is the completion.

[11634-11634]
Three final words. Spontaneous. Presence. Recognized. Rest.
