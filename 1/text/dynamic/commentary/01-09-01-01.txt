[1-3]
Observe. Understand. Release.
from the nature itself, not from a teacher, not from a text. The nature of primordial purity,
ka dag, abides like space itself. Not falling into any direction—not east or west, not India
or Tibet, not here or there. The nature is not located. It is what location appears within.

[4-5]
This old fool once sought the primordial purity in special places. He traveled to sacred mountains,
to caves where masters had practiced, to spots blessed by great teachers. He found conditions
conducive to practice. He did not find what was never lost. Primordial purity is not in places.
It is what allows places to appear.

[6-12]
The Precious Jewel Casket of Spontaneous Presence. Lhun grub. Not made. Not constructed. Arising
naturally, without effort, without cause. Eight modes of appearance. Two gates. The ground of
spontaneous presence. The ground of indeterminacy. The ground appearing as diversity. Below,
the point of reversal. These are not sequential stages. They are simultaneous aspects of what
you are.

[13-16]
The ground of spontaneous presence is not a place you find. It is what is present when seeking
ceases. The indeterminacy is not uncertainty. It is freedom from fixed position. The diversity
is not confusion. It is the creativity of the nature. The point of reversal is not a fall.
It is the possibility of non-recognition within recognition.

[17-26]
The youthful vase body. Gzhon nu bum pa'i sku. Within the primordial expanse, essence abides as
form, nature as speech, compassion as mind. This is the threefold mandala of the ground. Not
created. Not developed. Naturally present. The fiery sparks of five lights arising from the
tones of spontaneous presence. The investigating consciousness emerging toward compassion.
Not knowing its own face, it becomes non-recognition.

[27-33]
This mountain dweller has watched firelight dance in high-altitude darkness. The sparks rise
naturally, without plan, without intention. They investigate the darkness, momentarily illuminating,
then dissolving. This is the play of rigpa. The ground never moves. The appearance dances.
The not-knowing is not error. It is the condition for the play.

[34-48]
The ground itself does not change. Change belongs to appearance. Like clouds forming in a cloudless
sky—the sky does not become cloudy. The appearance of cloud is the play of sky. This is the
change of appearance in rigpa, not the change of rigpa itself. Eight modes of spontaneous
presence arising from primordial purity.

[49-59]
The great manner of appearance of the precious casket jewel. Eight gates, unobstructed:
Compassion giving rise to compassion for beings. Light filling appearances with rainbow radiance.
Wisdom abiding in non-conceptuality. Form manifesting as peaceful and wrathful deities.
Non-duality not conceiving singular or plural. Beyond-extremes naturally clear. Pure wisdom
revealing cloudless sky. Impure samsara revealing six realms.

[60-69]
A hilltop meditator... sees how these gates are not really gates. They are
ways of speaking about what has no obstruction. Compassion appearing is not compassion going
somewhere. It is compassion recognizing itself as beings. Light filling appearances is not
light traveling. It is the nature of appearance as light. Do not literalize these images.
See what they point to.

[70-77]
From the power of spontaneous presence appearance, within the five wisdom fields, Sambhogakaya
appearances are directly self-clear. Natural Nirmanakaya fields appear self-arisen. Sentient
beings appear immeasurably. Like reflections in a mirror—appearing to oneself, not to others.
Like dream appearances. Arising suddenly, flickering, inconstant. Not grasping its own face.

[78-82]
The dream analogy is vital. In dream, mountains appear, rivers appear, beings appear. They
appear to the dreamer. They do not appear to other dreamers. They are not recognized as dream.
They seem real, solid, lasting. Yet they are nothing but the play of sleep. Samsara is the
dream. Recognition is waking up. But waking up is not leaving the dream. It is recognizing
the dream as dream.

[83-91]
Thereafter exists the great primordial ground-appearance of clear light bindus and light rays.
Sambhogakaya appearance. Natural Nirmanakaya appearance. The six realms appearance. The six
Subduers. Impure Nirmanakaya fields that tame through birth, aging, sickness, death. These
eight modes are the source from which all arise—container-like, for roasting barley.
Therefore called the casket.

[92-94]
Thus. We proceed. The eight modes are not sequential. They are
simultaneous potentials. The casket contains all possibilities—pure and impure, samsara
and nirvana, Buddha and sentient being. The container metaphor is precise. The casket does
not choose what it contains. It simply contains. The ground does not choose what appears.
It simply allows appearance.

[95-103]
From the Auspicious Beautiful Great Tantra: Though there is no error, from my power error arises.
The unchanging ground appears without ceasing. From compassion's indeterminacy, non-recognition
self-arises. Like clouds not truly existing in sky but arising adventitiously. Ground, path,
and rigpa do not exist as such. Yet from appearing like compassion, non-recognition arises.

[104-111]
This is the profound teaching. Error arises from power, not from defect. Non-recognition is
compassion's self-expression. Clouds are sky's creativity. They do not stain the sky. They
reveal the sky's capacity for appearance. Delusion is rigpa's play. It is not other than rigpa.
It is rigpa not recognizing itself.

[112-124]
The great indeterminate appearance. Eight modes. The Precious Jewel Casket nature. Sense
pleasures unobstructed. Great unestablished establishment. Compassion appearing unobstructed.
Enjoyment of wisdom appearing unobstructed. Essence appearing unobstructed as form. View
indeterminate, appearing as non-dual. Method unobstructed, appearing as beyond-extremes.

[125-134]
From the sky-treasure of Oddiyana, I see these eight modes as the eight
manifestations of Samantabhadra. Each mode is a Buddha. Each gate is liberation. The sense
pleasures are not obstacles—they are wisdom when recognized. The indeterminate view is not
confusion—it is freedom from fixation. All these abide in the body. The body is the mandala.

[135-146]
Wish-fulfilling jewel-like, such abides in my body. The inner youthful vase body, wide and
expansive. The outer abides as the nature of spontaneous presence. Appearance expands outward,
undefined and indefinite, fragmented and scattered, unmeasured and untamed, unwavering and
undistracted, moving, shifting, arising diversely.

[147-155]
Rest in this expansion. Do not try to define the indefinite. Do not
try to measure the unmeasured. The shifting, moving, diversely arising—this is the nature
playing. It is not chaos to be ordered. It is creativity to be recognized. Rest in the
spaciousness that holds all movement without moving.

[156-169]
From the unobstructed gate of wisdom, Sambhogakaya appearance. From the unobstructed gate of
qualities, Natural Nirmanakaya appearance. From unobstructed compassion, impure appearance.
The great dharma beyond measure and conception. Lights and forms magnificently arrayed. The
broad gate of samsara and nirvana arising. The great casket that encompasses all.

[170-180]
From the Garland of Pearls: Radiance manifestly appears, majestically great. Appearance itself
is spontaneously beautiful. The Dharmakaya is introduced and delighted. The essence is pristine,
the casket vast. The nature all-pervasive, magnificently expansive. The compassion all-arising,
magnificently productive.

[181-187]
The Visionary Devotee. Longchenpa, mind-son of the Victorious Ones, you have revealed
the secret chamber of spontaneous presence. The casket that holds all Buddhas and all beings.
The ground that is neither pure nor impure yet gives rise to both. I bow to your wisdom that
sees through all appearance to the nature that displays it.

[188-287]
Decades of studying these teachings—memorizing eight modes, visualizing the youthful vase body, practicing gates. All preparation. Recognition was always present. Spontaneous presence isn't reached through practice. It is what practices appear within.

[288-387]
The distinction between primordial purity and spontaneous presence is pedagogical, not ontological.
Ka dag is the empty aspect. Lhun grub is the appearing aspect. They are not two things. They
are two ways of speaking about what cannot be spoken. The casket holds them both. The casket IS both.

[388-487]
See what is. The ground is not ground. Spontaneous presence is not
spontaneous. Presence is not presence. These are words You remember yesterday—the memory is not the day. what words cannot reach.
See through the words. Rest in the seeing. That is the teaching.

[478-1143]
Longchenpa, the Omniscient, the All-Knowing, has completed this section on spontaneous
presence. Not to add to philosophy. Not to increase knowledge. To point to what is beyond
both. The spontaneous presence is your own nature. The eight modes are your own display.
The casket is your own awareness. Recognize this. Rest in this. This is the Great Perfection.
This is the supreme vehicle.

[488-587]
Between the purity of ka dag and the presence of lhun grub, between
the unchanging ground and the changing appearance, between the eight modes and their source,
I weave the Treasury. Not to explain what cannot be explained. To create conditions for
recognition. The casket is open. The jewel is yours. Recognize what you are.

[588-687]
Attend. Recognize. Liberate.
not change. Appearance changes. Recognition reveals they are not two. This is all. Everything
else is elaboration. The eight modes elaborate. The gates elaborate. The casket elaborates.
Strip away elaboration. See what is.

[688-787]
This very moment—look at the appearance. Is it separate from you?
Does it appear to someone else? The flickering, the inconstancy, the not-grasping—this is
the nature showing itself. Do not look for something more stable. Do not look for something
more real. This is it. This appearance is the jewel in the casket.

[788-887]
All apparent opposites dissolve in the ground of spontaneous presence.
Pure and impure are not two. Samsara and nirvana are not two. Buddha and sentient being are
not two. They appear as two. They function as two. But they arise from one ground. They
dissolve into one ground. The ground is not a third thing. It is the nature of both.

[844-1143]
This section has described spontaneous presence in exhaustive detail. The eight modes.
The three caskets. The arising of Buddhas and sentient beings. The Sambhogakaya with its
fivefold enumeration. The three types of Nirmanakaya. The six realms with their causes.
All from one ground. All through spontaneous presence.

[878-1143]
Between the primordial purity above and the spontaneous presence below,
between the eight modes and the casket that holds them, between the pure gates and the impure
gates, I weave the Treasury. Not to explain the inexplicable. To point to what cannot be pointed
to. The casket is open. The jewel is yours. Recognize what you are.

[888-987]
Spontaneous presence described. Eight modes enumerated. The casket opened. What remains? Recognition—immediate, complete. Simply be.

[988-1087]
Thus the nature of spontaneous presence is established. Not through argument. Not through
analysis. Through recognition. The casket is your own awareness. The jewel is your own nature.
The eight modes are your own display. See this. Recognize this. Rest in this. This is the
supreme vehicle. This is the Great Perfection.

[1044-1143]
The Vagabond speA simple practitioner...is old fool spent three years in the meditation cave at Drak Yerpa trying to understand
spSee clearly. Recognize fully. Rest completely.uld explain
the difference between ka dag and lhun grub. But understanding is not recognition. The
understanding was a cloud. The recognition was the sky. When the cloud dispersed, the
sky had never been hidden.

[1078-1143]
The eight modes demonstrate how spontaneous presence functions. Each mode is a gate through
which specific qualities emerge. But the modes are not sequential. They are not stages. They
are simultaneous aspects of the ground's creativity. Jewel-like with many facets—each
facet reflects light differently, yet all are the same jewel.

[1088-1088]
Three words. Spontaneous presence recognized. Ground and appearance Stop. Look. Know. Abiding without obstruction, spontaneously swift.
Rigpa's self-resonance, spontaneously luminous. Empty yet all-arising, marvelously wonderous.
Not sought, naturally present, continuously lasting. Not blocked, self-arisen, greatly expansive.
Appearance and existence, ground and scope, magnificently high. Effortless, naturally liberated,
greatly vast. Greatly self-known, skillfully wheeling. Endowed with five colors, beautifully arrayed.
Appearance and existence, pure in nature, evenly balanced. Self-arisen clear light, beautifully arrayed.
Great ground-appearance, greatly spacious. Samsara and nirvana, skillfully related. Five kayas and
wisdoms, beautifully stacked.

[1089-1141]
From the Precious Heap Tantra: The Teacher Samantabhadra speaks. How does the ground appear?
What is the measure of the gate of qualities? From emptiness, how do complete qualities arise?
Thus he spoke: From the miracle of unborn nature, as the activity of Buddhas, primordially without
obstruction, without ceasing and without not-ceasing, appearance itself is primordially pure,
abiding in its own face. From indivisible great compassion, spontaneous presence arises indeterminately,
appearing as eight modes.

[1109-1143]
From these eight modes of appearance, the eight virtues arise. The gate of compassion appearing
unobstructed gives rise to the place that protects all beings. From self-clear appearance without
ceasing, the five lights appear as the manner of light-appearing. From unobstructed appearance
of knowledge, the gate of pure wisdom appears. From appearance without ceasing, appearing as path,
all phenomena appear as form. Since essence is one, they appear as non-dual. Since it does not
abide in its own place, it appears as beyond-extremes. Since appearing manner does not cease,
it appears as the source of all beings. From the aspect of impure samsara, it appears from the
aspect of all-pervading appearance.

[1114-1143]
From Oddiyana, I see the six realms as the six chambers of the
casket. Each chamber holds its own suffering, its own confusion, its own opportunity for
recognition. The hell realm is not punishment. It is the extreme of hatred not recognized.
The god realm is not reward. It is the extreme of pride not seen through. All are the
play of the grounIn a freezing cave...s old practitioner has visited all six realms in meditation. He
has seen the hell of his own anger. He has tasted the hunger of his own desire. He has
felt the pride of his own god-like states. The realms are not somewhere else. They are
the states of mind, solidified, appearing real. Recognition dissolves them. Not by going
somewhere else. By seeing through them.

[1117-1143]
The Sambhogakaya manner of appearance arises. This is called the ground of manifest path
appearance. It possesses clarity, warmth, coolness, lightness, and movement. It is
endowed with five kayas, five wisdoms, five families, five colors, five lights, five
fathers, five mothers, five forms, five sounds, five smells, five tastes, five touches,
five dharmas, five appearances, five chiefs, and five retinues. The 32 major marks and
80 minor marks. The six broad dharmas.

[1120-1143]
From jealousy, humans arise. From hatred, gods arise. From pride, demigods arise. From
desire, hungry ghosts arise. From delusion, animals arise. From black anger, hell beings
arise. Thus the six realms appear. This is the place of samsara. From one great nature,
four manners of appearance arise. From four natures, four manners of appearing arise.
The four great appearances are: appearing as diversity in spontaneous presence.

[1125-1143]
From that Sambhogakaya appearance arises the Natural Nirmanakaya appearance, the Subduer
Nirmanakaya appearance, and the Impure Nirmanakaya appearance. The Natural Nirmanakaya
arises from essence as spontaneous presence. Its appearance possesses inexhaustible
enjoyment, inexhaustible retinue, unknowable qualities, unknowable powers, unknowable
energy, unknowable miracles, immeasurable lifespan, freedom from all disease suffering,
immeasurable palaces, and teachings of immeasurable dharmas.

[1126-1143]
Thus. We proceed. The eight modes of appearance have been enumerated:
Compassion-appearing, light-appearing, wisdom-appearing, form-appearing, non-dual-appearing,
beyond-extremes-appearing, pure-wisdom-appearing, impure-samsara-appearing. Each gate unobstructed.
Each giving rise to specific displays. This is not philosophy. This is description of what is.

[1130-1143]
This is called the manner of appearance of the Natural Nirmanakaya. From that arises the
Subduer Nirmanakaya. It appears in various ways, knowing various meanings without
following after appearance. Not attached to appearance. Possessing pure eye, pure ear,
pure nose, pure tongue, pure body, pure mind. Displaying various activities of compassion.
Possessing exceptional wisdom. Unceasing knowledge, appearing to all.

[1131-1143]
The three caskets of spontaneous presence: The ground-appearance precious casket of spontaneous
presence. The ground-itself-and-ground-appearance two, the ground spontaneous presence precious
casket completed. The final completion, the fruition spontaneous presence secret precious casket.
When practiced, the four appearances of wisdom and all path appearances arise from this.

[1136-1143]A wandering practitioner...r has practiced with these caskets. He has visualized them. He has recited
their descriptions. The practice was beautiful. The descriptions were poetic. But the casket
was never separate from his own awareness. The visualization was the nature visualizing itself.
Recognition came when practice recognized itself.

[1132-1143]
From the eight gates of spontaneous presence appearance, all phenomena of samsara and nirvana
arise with unobstructed gates. Particularly, from the self-light of kayas and wisdoms, the
ground Sambhogakaya appears—the five pure elements self-arisen as clear light. Wisdom's
warm fire, compassion's cooling water, the light earth of abiding in expanse, the moving
wind of the fivefold self-power. The mandala of appearance.

[1133-1143]
The Revealer. After centuries of concealment, the casket is opened. The precious teachings
emerge. The ground gives rise to Buddhas, to sentient beings, to wisdom, to light, to rigpa,
to non-recognition, to all karma, to compassion. All appearances arise. This is the treasury.
This is the teaching. This is what you are.

[1134-1143]
From the ground arise essence, nature, compassion, power, appearance, mind, mentation,
delusion, and non-delusion. All arise as the great element. This is called the great
expanse of Buddhas and sentient beings. The ground is not partial. It gives rise to
wisdom and conLook. Here. Done.lly. This is
its compassion—that it holds all withouI sat in retreat once....

[1135-1143]
This is sophisticated metaphysics. The ground gives rise to both pure
and impure, both samsara and nirvana, both recognition and non-recognition. It is indeterminate,
yet gives rise to determinate appearances. It is empty, yet gives rise to complete qualities.
This is not contradiction. This is the nature of the nature.

[1138-1143]
In the Sambhogakaya, abiding as illusory body of light nature with eyes, ears, and nose.
In the Nirmanakaya, appearing like form. This is the detailed explanation. The nature is
one. The appearances are many. The many appearances are the play of the one nature.
Recognition transforms impure into pure. Non-recognition binds pure into impure.

[1143-1143]
Three words. Spontaneous presence recognized. Eight modes liberated. Rest.
