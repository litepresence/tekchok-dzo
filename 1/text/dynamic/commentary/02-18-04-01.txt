[1-133]
Look closely. Two soles pressed to earth—this is not feet touching ground. This is method and wisdom
meeting in flesh and bone. The grasping winds that drive you from distraction to distraction—do you feel
them slow? Not forced. Not suppressed. Simply resting in their own place.

[1-133]
Walking the high passes... once watched a master sit like this for three days without moving. His knees pressed
so tight you could not slide a blade of grass between them. Yet he breathed like a sleeping child.
What looked like austerity was complete relaxation. The body held firm so the mind could rest.
That is the secret of the sage's crouch—not punishment, but profound kindness to oneself.

[1-133]
Between the effort of holding and the release of resting, find the middle. The channels are like
mountain streams in spring—when unobstructed, they flow naturally. When compressed by wrong
posture, they flood or dry up. The sage's crouch opens the central channel the way a skilled
engineer opens an irrigation gate. Water flows where it is needed.

[-20403--20401]
Knees pressed to navel. The body knows what the mind forgets. Elements compress into central channel
without effort. Channels open. Wind moves like river finding its level. You are not doing this. You are
allowing what was always so.

[1-133]
Hands crossed. Dharmadhatu and rigpa embrace. The expanse and the awareness that knows it—not two,
never were. Neck straight—wind projects outward and returns to source. Self-luminosity without seeking.
Three words: See what is. Rest.

[1-133]
This hesitation you feel—is it the posture resisting, or is it your idea of yourself resisting?
The body knows how to sit. It has sat for millions of years. Your concepts about sitting are
what create the difficulty. Let the concepts rest. Let the body find its natural wisdom.
The crossed hands are not a gesture you make. They are recognition embodied in flesh.

[1-133]
Kye ma! Look at this miracle. The very form you have taken for granted as "your" body is actually
the display of awakened nature. Each joint, each channel, each breath—perfectly arranged for
recognition. The sage's crouch is not creating something new. It is revealing what was always
perfect. This very posture, held for even a moment with recognition, is complete practice.

[1-133]
From the treasury's heart: The sage's crouch contains complete liberation. Do not look elsewhere.
The Dharma eye does not behold after years of practice. It beholds now. Present tense. Available.
The emanation body is not future attainment. It is your awareness displaying itself when posture
supports recognition.

[1-133]
Thus. We proceed. "Emanation"—the body's arising purified, transformed into illusory display.
"Posture"—relying upon ground of tantra. "Stance"—not returning to three realms. Each word
Footprints in snow—you follow them, but the prints are not the destination. what can only be recognized, never explained. The distinction dissolves the distinction-maker.

[1-133]
Whoever knows this key point—knows, not believes, not hopes, not studies—liberates from that,
becoming Buddha. Not becoming something else. Becoming what was never otherwise. The purification
ripens. The aggregates seen as play of light, dance of empty form. This is not philosophy. This is
your direct experience when posture meets recognition.

[1-133]
Now the elephant reclining. See the difference? The sage was active, engaged, hunched. This one—
relaxed, receptive, open. Hunched sleeping presses aggregate dharmas. The elephant does not fight
its body. It completely occupies it. Every cell, every channel, every pulse of elemental heat—included.
Nothing rejected. Nothing forced.

[1-133]
Before recognition dawned... spent a winter in a yak-hair tent with a master who taught this posture. Every
evening, as the fire died to embers, he would lie like the elephant. Not sleeping—abiding.
The cold of the high plateau became warmth. The hardness of the ground became support.
What changed was not the conditions. What changed was the relationship to conditions.
That is the teaching of the Saṃbhogakāya posture—not escape, but complete inclusion.

[1-133]
The toes stretched outward—do you feel the subtle energy moving? This is not imagination.
This is the action wind being held, not by force, but by geometry. The body is a mandala,
each position revealing different aspects of the same nature. The elephant does not try to
hold the wind. The posture holds it naturally, the way a valley holds a river.

[1-133]
Toes stretched outward. Fingertips upon ground. The body becomes bridge between known and knowing.
Neck raised upward, connecting. Awareness and expanse inseparable—not maintained through effort,
but natural result of proper posture. The posture does the work. Your job: allow it.

[1-133]
From Thalgyur: "Saṃbhogakāya's posture, relying upon elephant's sleep, dharmatā is enjoyed,
the lotus eye beholds." The shift from "Dharma eye" to "lotus eye"—seeing becomes enjoying.
Not rejecting the senses. Not grasping them. Purified as play of the unborn.

[1-133]
The five desire-objects—form, sound, smell, taste, touch—purified means seeing them as they are.
Form is dharmatā's form. Sound is dharmatā's sound. The lotus eye remains open. Enjoyment continues.
Meditation and world: one display. "Saṃbhogakāya"—one always enjoying dharmatā directly.
"Posture"—abiding in samādhi. "Stance"—transcending three realms.

[1-133]
From Golden Garuda: The supreme key point of body. The yogin supreme. This posture engages
all three kāya fields simultaneously. Not traveling to them. Already there. Already here.
The elephant knows what the scholar debates. Complete relaxation is complete engagement.

[1-133]
The lion entering its den. Most subtle of all. Two soles upon ground equalize elemental heat—
not suppressing, not stimulating, equalizing. Body flexible allows wisdom wind's projection
to naturally suppress action wind. This is not done. It happens when conditions align.

[1-133]
This mountain dweller once watched a lioness enter her cave at dawn. She did not hesitate.
She did not check if the way was clear. She simply moved—complete confidence, total relaxation.
That is the lion posture. The body flexible, not rigid with effort. The mind fearless, not
planning or reviewing. Just entering. Just abiding. Just being.

[1-133]
The wisdom wind is not something you generate through force. It is already present, already
moving. The lion posture allows it to naturally suppress the action wind—the wind that drives
you to act from delusion. When wisdom wind moves, action happens without actor. The lion
hunts without hunter. The yogin practices without practitioner. This is the secret.

[1-133]
Fingers bent upon ground reverse the action wind. Chest hollow allows vision to dawn quickly.
Neck relaxed keeps expanse and awareness inseparable. Progression: Nirmāṇakāya focused channels
and wind. Saṃbhogakāya opened to enjoyment. Dharmakāya transcends both—simply abiding.

[1-133]
From Thalgyur: "Dharmakāya's posture, the lion, delusion's fears all abandoned, the vajra eye
beholds." Vajra eye—indestructible, unchanging, seeing through all appearances unmoved.
Not special perception. Perception itself, freed from perceiver. The lion embodies fearlessness.
What to fear when subject and object recognized as inseparable?

[1-133]
"Dharma"—liberating from body's aggregates. "Kāya"—those completely pure, illusory kāya always
abiding. "Posture"—not departing from samādhi's abiding. "Stance"—liberating from saṃsāra.
The den is not hiding place. It is natural abode of one with nothing to defend, nothing to attain.

[1-133]
Whoever knows the body's key point, compatible with that, makes the yogin pure in dharmakāya
bliss. Not knowing about. Knowing from within. The body teaches what books cannot. Posture is
not preparation. Posture IS recognition embodied.

[1-133]
Performing these three postures, not transgressing the three kāyas' intent. This is vital.
Not sequential stages. Simultaneous aspects. Sage's crouch contains elephant's relaxation
and lion's fearlessness. Elephant's repose contains sage's engagement and lion's transcendence.
Each posture implies all three.

[1-133]
The sage hunched—sign of liberation through asceticism. Not suffering for its own sake.
Discipline, engagement, active participation in awakening. The elephant—sign of spontaneous
effortless liberation. Not rejecting discipline but transcending need through integration.
The lion—sign of genuine fearless liberation. Beyond discipline and spontaneity. Simply abiding.

[1-133]
Why elemental body's gaze transforms into three kāyas' gaze? The three kāyas dwell in heart's
innate presence. Making gaze manifests three intents abiding within. Since three kāyas exist
as one's own constituents, one's own gaze becomes three kāyas' gaze. Cold body harmonizes
with Nirmāṇakāya: balanced warmth. Hot body: Dharmakāya. Balanced: Saṃbhogakāya.

[1-133]
Particularly, vision increases swiftly when posture aligns. If posture not bent, awareness's
self-resonance in channels does not arise. Without raising, awareness-vision does not dawn
in outer sky. Therefore gaze is precious. Ordinary abiding cannot manifest awareness.
When dawn comes, ordinary abiding decreases—therefore gaze is precious.

[1-133]
As snake's limbs, though in body, not manifest—bend them, they appear. So awareness dawns
from gaze's essential point. The body contains what the mind seeks elsewhere. Posture unlocks
what was never locked. Recognition reveals what was never hidden.

[1-133]
Are postures limited to three? If one, two, three, or hundreds-thousands arise—what then?
Sentient beings led by three afflictions into three realms. Liberated from that, therefore
three determined. Three afflictions ripening into body, speech, mind—therefore three determined.
Not because three is magic number. Because three covers all possibilities of bondage and liberation.

[1-133]
From saṃsāra's karma wheel: Desire impure ripening into form—bird form emerges. Action and doer,
speech chief. When ripening into body, delight in speech, object chief, desire great.
Taking that into pure path, Saṃbhogakāya posture shown. Such beings always performing this
posture become supreme experts in dharmatā's meaning. Completing their nature, not rejecting it.

[1-133]
Delusion impure ripening into form—pig emerges. That producing latency, mind chief form ripening.
When ripening into form, mind changes much, intellect changes, conceptuality great, not delighting
in speech, always delighting in sleep. Always abiding in Dharmakāya posture, determined to abide
in dharmatā for three times.

[1-133]
Aversion impure ripening into form—snake ripening, body action chief form emerging. Delighting
in body action, desire to move, body strength great, body coarse. Always abiding in Nirmāṇakāya
posture, determined to become Buddha. Therefore posture determined as three.

[1-133]
Sentient beings' destiny emerging into body, speech, mind. Liberating from those bindings—
therefore three alone determined. More than that not needed. Fewer incomplete. Three covers
the field of liberation completely. Nothing missing. Nothing extra.

[1-133]
At this time, speech's main point: cutting speech. From Thalgyur: "Speech—training, abiding,
swallowing—must be made firm." Training speech: learning to speak from recognition rather
than habit. Abiding speech: resting in silence without anxiety. Swallowing speech: knowing
when not to speak, and being at peace.

[1-133]
These three postures are the body's wisdom codified by masters who recognized that awakening
is not purely mental. Body must participate. Channels must open. Winds must settle. But do
not become attached to postures. They are Step through, but don't carry the threshold. at moon of recognition. The sage's
crouch, elephant's rest, lion's repose—these are your own nature displaying itself through form.
When recognition dawns, postures naturally arise. When recognition fades, postures remind you.

[-20405--20273]
Longchenpa's gift: complete path—not just philosophy, not just meditation, but full integration
of body, speech, mind in service of recognition. The Treasury of Supreme Vehicle is not book
to be read. It is body to be lived. Sit now. Choose posture. Not based on preference, but
on what is needed. Or recognize that all three are simultaneously present in awareness itself.

[1-133]
The choice is yours. Recognition is already present. Postures simply reveal what was never
hidden. Thus it is taught. Thus it is practiced. Thus it is realized. Between the architecture
of three postures and recognition that transcends all posture, the path weaves itself.
