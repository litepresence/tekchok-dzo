Third: thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector. The enumeration continues. Each level a world-system, each world-system a configuration of causes. The thousand Brahmas are not gods to worship. They are the thousandfold multiplication of pure cause meeting pure effect. The protector emerges when the protected is recognized as self. What needs protection? Only what was never threatened.

[6420-6420]
An old practitioner once tried to count the thousand Brahmas. He reached five hundred and lost track. In that losing, he found: the thousand were never separate. They were one nature displaying as multiplicity. The Yama-world-protector was not protecting worlds. The protector was the recognition that worlds need no protection.

Stop searching. Start seeing. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[6420-6420]
Hence. The structure. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[6420-6420]
Between the thousand Brahmas and the recognition that transcends all numbers, the treasury continues. Not rejecting the enumeration. Not grasping it. The multiplication points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6420-6420]
This wanderer. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[6420-6420]
This binding—look closely. Is anything truly holding?.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[6420-6420]
Consequently. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Recognition is immediate. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[6420-6420]
An old practitioner once asked: "Who protects the protector?" The answer came not in words but in a sudden recognition: the protector and protected are the same awareness. The question itself dissolved. The asking was the protection. The recognition was the completion.

[6420-6420]
Thus established. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[6420-6420]
Slash through hesitation. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

This hermit. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[6420-6420]
What knows these words?
 The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
