[6420-6420] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Third—the thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector. In the cosmology of infinite display, we enumerate to point beyond enumeration. Thousand Brahmas: not a census of celestial beings but the thousand-fold display of awareness's own creativity. Each Brahma a facet, each world-protector a guardian of recognition. The numbers spiral outward to demonstrate: no limit to the ground's spontaneous expression.

[6420-6420] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old fool once tried to count the Brahmas! Sat beneath a tree, fingers moving, trying to hold a thousand in his mind. By the time he reached three hundred, his mind was exhausted. Then he laughed—the thousand were not out there in space but the thousand thoughts that dance through awareness every moment. Yama protects not a world but the boundary between recognizing and forgetting.

[6420-6420] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Thousand. One. Same. See what is. The thousand Brahmas are one awareness wearing masks. Remove the mask—recognize the face. Resolve completely. The number does not matter. The recognition matters. Return to this again and again.

[6420-6420] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Thousand Brahmas! World-protectors! Cosmic administrators! All concepts! Cut through them—can you find the first Brahma? Can you grasp the thousandth? The thousand are one display. The one is thousand-fold expression. See through the counting and FIND THE GROUND THAT COUNTS!

[6420-6420] Voice 05 (Mipham): Philosophically, the thousand Brahmas represent the exhaustive enumeration of possible world-systems within the spontaneously accomplished display. Yama as world-protector symbolizes the boundary-maintaining function of conventional perception. In Dzogchen, these are not metaphysical assertions but phenomenological descriptions—pointing to how awareness structured as perception creates the experience of multiplicity within unity.

[6420-6420] Voice 08 (Integrator): The thousand Brahmas integrate into one dharmakaya. The Yama-protector integrates into your own discerning wisdom. Multiplicity and unity integrate into non-dual display. Do not reject the thousand to find the one. Do not cling to the one and deny the thousand. Rest in the integration where number itself dissolves into effortless presence.

[6420-6420] Voice 03 (Dakini): I dance through the thousand world-systems like light through a thousand windows. Each window shows a different view, but the light is one. Yama protects the threshold—will you step through? The thousand Brahmas are my costume changes. The world-protector is my guardian. The recognition is the dance itself—unceasing, spontaneous, free.

[6420-6420] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I have sung the thousand Brahmas across a thousand valleys! Each valley echoes differently, but the song is one. Brahma creates, Vishnu preserves, Shiva destroys—yet these are the play of awareness, not separate gods. Yama protects the song from those who would make it rigid. Sing, yogi, sing—through the thousand into the one!

[6420-6420] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The enumeration of thousand Brahmas serves a pedagogical function—demonstrating the vastness of spontaneous display while pointing to that which transcends number. The Yama-world-protector guards the boundary between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, yet in Dzogchen this boundary is recognized as the play of awareness itself. Not rejection but recognition. Not denial but direct seeing.

[6420-6420] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond's final word on the thousand: stop counting and recognize the counter. The thousand Brahmas are your own mind's display. Yama is your own discerning wisdom. Everything that appears is self-appearance. Everything that protects is self-protection. Rest in this recognition and the cosmology becomes transparent—window into your own nature.

[6420-6420] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Final words on this. Thousand. Complete. You. Complete. Stop. Rest in the recognition that includes all numbers yet transcends counting. The thousand Brahmas bow to your own awareness. Yama protects what needs no protection. Complete. Perfect. AH!
