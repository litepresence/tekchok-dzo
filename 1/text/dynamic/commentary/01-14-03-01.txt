See directly: The framework reveals. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[17656-17661]
This hermit realized: This hermit. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[17662-17676]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: From the same source: Mind is latencies all basis. Embodied beings' stain. Grasp object, hold mind—that's samsara's dharma-nature. Jnana is separate from recollection-basis. From Six Expanses: If mind and wisdom self-essence not distinguished, like sun obscured by cloud-masses, outer appearance meaning impossible. Mind is karma, afflictions, latencies—all basis, source, accumulation, arising. Non-awareness house, always abiding, opposing wisdom sun, obscuring.

[17673-17688]
Cut through now! See what is. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[17685-17697]
Look now: Analysis proceeds. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[17693-17713]
This old hermit tells a story: A man carried a heavy stone for miles, complaining of its weight. Another asked, "Why don't you drop it?" The first replied, "I didn't know I could." Mind is like this stone—we carry it lifetime after lifetime, not knowing we can simply let go. Wisdom is already free; mind is what binds.

[17714-17725]
Voice 20 proclaims: From Pearl Garland—conceptions all burned. Wisdom itself like fire consumes. Equal to space itself. Empty-luminous awareness-possess itself. Some here not-knowing: if mind nonexistent, becomes inanimate or darkness—they have small learning. Though mind nonexistent, wisdom exists, awareness not ceasing.

[17720-17737]
Without hesitation— Thus. We proceed. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Regarding snang stong: Appearance-emptiness is not a philosophical position but the nature (rang bzhin) of this very experience.

[17731-17744]
Between obscuration and clarity, the vast middle way opens. Mind pervaded by non-awareness—suitable as mind pervader. Awareness not pervaded by non-awareness. Non-awareness ceasing from awareness expanse, or continuum breaking. Therefore mind ceasing time, basis non-awareness with part ceases, though awareness unceasing—because cease-basis is awareness.

[17738-17758]
If awareness also nonexistent, what top to cease is suitable? Here non-awareness with mind part ceases—awareness expands as wisdom, enjoying two knowledges. From Pearl Garland: Mind movement all separates, not inanimate. Knowing and awareness—clear appear. Thus spoken. Mind and wisdom each-other. Common body from also. Mind and mind-itself nature pure—two distinguished.

[17752-17764]
Between these extremes: This yogi. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[17758-17776]
Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[17764-17783]
Vehicle this to wisdom to Buddha ground-path-fruit enumerate through—quickly liberated from samsara. Others, samsara root to enlightenment hope, even long time that obtain difficult—because ground-manner err. From Kunzang Heart Mirror: Mind from Buddha desire—from me err. Thus spoken. Err manner: reason and scripture both contradict. Thus mind from Buddha and path and ground three open if, open-ground mind itself grasp-grasp possess—your ground path fruit all grasp-grasp possess result.

[17778-17795]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Desire Buddha not accomplished; accomplished also reverse result—because not liberated from grasp-grasp. Also mind habit karma various gather like—ground path fruit also that result. Desire if, delusion as result flaw exists! Opponent says: Mind nonexistent if, Buddha not-reason. Buddha that by mind distinction done—as you also desire purpose.

[17780-17801]
Immediate seeing! In this manner. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[17786-17810]
This old hermit offers final teaching: You seek Buddha in mind, like seeking gold in a lump of coal. Mind is the problem, not the solution. Wisdom is not made from mind—wisdom is what remains when mind ceases. Stop polishing the brick; it will never become a mirror.
