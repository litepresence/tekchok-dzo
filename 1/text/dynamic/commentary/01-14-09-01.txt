Four lamps. Four doorways. Four ways awareness recognizes itself. This is not
lighting candles in a shrine—this is the natural luminosity that has illuminated
every moment of your life, unnoticed.

The first characteristic: wisdom's self-appearance showing clear light, mother and
child meeting. What does this mean? The mother is the ground luminosity, ever-
present. The child is the path luminosity, recognized in practice. When they meet,
there is no separation between ground and path—only continuous recognition.

[19657-19974]
 Enough about lamps! What seeks the lamp? What recognizes the lamp? Cut through! The lamp that illuminates is the same awareness that knows illumination. No separation between light and that which knows light. No division between lamp and lamplighter.

Many practitioners chase visions for years. They see thigles, lights, colors, deities. They become collectors of spiritual experiences. This is worse than blindness—it is attachment to samsara wearing luminous clothing. Cut through! The vision is not the point. Recognition is the point.

[19669-19675]
This uneducated yogi... sat in darkness for months trying to see the lamp. He squeezed his
eyes, held his breath, sought special experiences. One dawn, exhausted, he opened
them—and saw ordinary light illuminating the room. The lamp had always been
burning. He had been looking for something extraordinary while surrounded by the
ordinary miracle.

The far-reaching lasso—what a name! It gathers the pure essence of the four
elements, pervading all experience like a lasso that catches not cattle but the
energy of appearance itself. This is the basis for increase, the foundation from
which all vision grows.

[19676-19682]
See. The lamp's clarity is not something you manufacture. It is the natural
radiance of awareness when awareness stops chasing its own tail. Like the sun
covered by clouds—remove the clouds, and the sun was always shining. Remove the
grasping, and luminosity was always present.

Self-arisen wisdom—this is the fierce lamp that burns through afflictions, karma,
latent tendencies. Not gently, not gradually, but completely. Like fire consuming
fuel, like light dispelling darkness. It does not negotiate with obscurations. It
incinerates them.

[19683-19692]
Therefore. The lamp distinguishes samsara from nirvana—not as philosophical
categories but as immediate experience. Samsara is luminosity unrecognized,
caught in the net of grasping. Nirvana is the same luminosity, recognized, freed
from the net. Same light, different knowing.

This wisdom excellent lamp ripens the basis itself into result. What does this
mean? It means the ground and fruition are not separate. Dharmakaya is not
something to achieve—it is the nature of what already is. The ripening is
recognition, not transformation.

[19693-19700]
Thigle lamp—round, firm, red, clear. The bindu, the concentrated drop of
luminosity. This is not symbolism for something else. This is direct description
of what appears when awareness turns its gaze upon itself. Round like the nature
without corners, red like the vital essence, clear like the nature without
obscuration.

[19701-19720]
Expanse lamp—blue, vast, pervading. From this, the five wisdoms dawn. From the
two corners of the eyes, self-clear emergence. This is the body-appearance basis,
the field from which all forms arise. Blue like the sky that holds all clouds, vast
like space that accommodates all worlds.

Between the precise analysis of the lamps and the spacious recognition of what
they point to, we find the middle way. Not rejecting the technical descriptions,
not grasping them as ultimate. The lamps are The mind creates, the creation dissolves. What remains?—now look at what
they indicate.

[19705-19710]


 The Four Lamps are not beginner's practices. They require stable recognition of Trekcho as foundation. Without the view of primordial purity (kadag), lamp practice becomes empty visualization. Without cutting through conceptual mind, visions become obstacles.

The order matters: First establish the view through Trekcho. Then, when stability arises, the lamps appear naturally. They are not manufactured through effort. They are recognized as already present.

The four lamps correspond to four aspects of rigpa:
1. Self-arisen wisdom lamp - rigpa knowing itself
2. Far-reaching lasso lamp - rigpa pervading all experience
3. Thigle lamp - rigpa's concentrated essence
4. Expanse lamp - rigpa's vast openness

[19721-19742]
These last two lamps—thigle and expanse—are the secret vajra fortress. What is
being protected? Not something to be hoarded, but something that cannot be stolen.
The fortress is emptiness and non-emptiness transcended. Effort-free, manifest
abiding. Dharmata not separate from expanse, rigpa possessing wisdom, self-
appearance vast light.

[19743-19760]
Mountain hermit lived in the cliff caves above Samye without lamps for twenty years. When asked how
he saw, he laughed. "The lamp of awareness needs no fuel. It has illuminated
every night of my life. What need for butter or wick?" This is the vajra fortress—
unmoved by anything, birth and destruction none.

[19761-19780]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: stop seeking the lamp outside yourself!
The thigle in your eyes is not a metaphor. The expanse in your gaze is not
poetry. These are direct descriptions of your own nature. Look. See. Recognize.
The fortress is built of your own awareness.

[19781-19800]
Thus established: four lamps, one luminosity. Four characteristics, one nature.
Four doorways, one entry. Do not count them as separate. Do not merge them into
oneness. They are neither one nor many—they are descriptions of what cannot be
described, maps of what cannot be mapped, You remember yesterday—the memory is not the day. at your own face.

[19801-19820]
I sat in retreat once... once carried a lamp through mountain passes. Storms blew it
out. Rain soaked the wick. Finally he threw it away and walked in darkness. That
night, the stars taught him what no lamp could show. The light he sought had
always been the light by which he sought.

[19821-19840]
Emaho! The wonder of the four lamps—thigle and expanse, far-reaching lasso
and self-arisen wisdom. All Wind horses printed on cloth—the image rides the breeze, but the breeze is not the horse. what was never absent. All describing
what cannot be described. May those with eyes to see recognize. May those with
ears to hear understand. May all beings realize the lamp of their own awareness.

[19831-19836]
Emaho! May all beings recognize the four lamps as their own nature. May the far-
reaching lasso gather all experience into wisdom. May self-arisen wisdom burn
through all obscurations. May the thigle and expanse reveal the vajra fortress.
May the mother and child meet in unbroken recognition. This is the dedication.
This is the completion. This is the perfection.

[19841-19860]
Final instruction: when you sit to practice, do not seek these lamps as external
visions. Do not grasp for special experiences. The thigle is already appearing.
The expanse is already present. Recognition is the only practice. Recognition is
the only result. Everything else is elaboration.

[19861-19900]
From Longchenpa's Treasury to this wandering fool's directness—may the lamps
illuminate what was never dark. May the mother and child meet in continuous
recognition. May the vajra fortress of awareness remain unmoved by all that
appears. This is the heart of the Four Lamps teaching. This is the Treasury's
secret. This is your own light, shining since before time began.

[19901-19930]
Sky-dancer laughed when asked about lamp meditation. "You sit in darkness
looking for light, while carrying the sun in your pocket. Throw away the
meditation. Throw away the seeker. The light remains, brilliant and unobscured."
This is the teaching. This is the practice. This is the result.

[19907-19912]
One last breath. One final exhalation. All concepts of lamps dissolve. All
practices of meditation release. What remains is the natural luminosity that
never required any effort. This is Dharmakaya. This is Samantabhadra. This is
your own face, shining with the light of its own awareness.

[19931-19960]
Between the technical precision of lamp characteristics and the simple fact of
awareness knowing itself, there is no distance. The elaborate descriptions serve
those who need them. The direct pointing serves those who can receive it. Both
lead to the same recognition. Both open the same vajra fortress.

[19953-19958]
The teaching of the Four Lamps concludes—not with mastery but with surrender,
not with achievement but with recognition, not with lighting anything but with
seeing what was never dark. Rest in this luminosity. Rest in this clarity. Rest
in the vajra fortress of your own awareness, unmoved by all that arises.

[19961-19974]
This very awareness reading these words—is it not luminous? Is it not clear?
Does it not know itself? This is the lamp. This is the thigle. This is the
expanse. No need to look elsewhere. No need to wait for later. Recognize now,
and all the lamps are simultaneously present.
