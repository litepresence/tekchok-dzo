[1-336]
Three aspects of expansion—first, completion. From Self-Arising: in pure appearance of three kayas, one complete, two complete, all complete. Wisdom appearing unceasing and clear. Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating. In awareness free from concept, five lights unceasing. In great self-liberation without grasping, outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.

Listen: in awareness released from action, actor and acted complete in single moment. Not gradually—in one moment. In awareness separated from mind, all variety complete. In great clear purity, deluded appearances complete. In great self-liberated self-appearance, other-arisen dharmas complete. Such is manner of three kayas' completion.

[-20405--20385]
One who walked paths... spent years trying to complete something. Practices, retreats,
accumulations—endless becoming. Then laughed: complete from the beginning,
never incomplete, never needing completion. One complete: dharmakaya as
ground. Two complete: sambhogakaya as enjoyment. All complete: nirmanakaya
as display. Three yet one, one yet three.

Notice. Allow. Rest.
recognition. Like realizing you've been holding the treasure you sought.
Actor and acted: both complete in one moment of awareness. Not gradually:
time collapses in recognition.

[1-336]
Awakening—being without dualistic grasping. From same nature: without action, delusion awakens; without concept, afflictions awaken; without grasping, self-arising awakens; without clinging, conceptual thought awakens; without attachment, ignorance awakens.

See the pattern? Stop grasping and what was confused awakens to what it always was. This is manner of three kayas' awakening.

[-20384--20376]
Therefore. Thus. The mechanism of awakening: not addition but subtraction,
not gaining but releasing. Without action: action that is not straining,
not forcing, not seeking. Delusion awakens: not transformed but recognized
as never other than wisdom.

This mountain dweller watched confusion for decades. Tried to fix it,
transcend it, understand it. Then stopped—and there it was, awake all
along. The pattern: grasping creates the sleeper; releasing reveals the
awake.

[1-336]
Expansion—qualities primordially accomplished, spontaneously expansive. From Self-Arising: in awareness free from concept, five lights clear, wisdom expansive; in awareness free from actor/acted, three kayas expand without perceived object; in awareness appearing without object, five lights expand without grasping mind; in awareness great wisdom, self-appearance with meaning, fruit expands.

Not acquiring qualities—recognizing what already is.

[-20375--20363]
Qualities primordially accomplished—not achieved through
effort but revealed through recognition. Spontaneously expansive: not
forced but natural, not created but discovered. Like the sun's rays:
always emanating, just waiting for clouds to part.

Five lights: blue, white, yellow, red, green. Not visual phenomena only
but the display of wisdom itself. Clear, expansive, ungrasped—this is
the nature of awareness when recognized.

[1-336]
Expansive explanation of place—dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya. Dharmakaya has ten aspects: essence, definition, self-body, metaphor, sign, appearance, place, characteristic, object, intent.

Essence: empty-clarity, cessation without inherent existence. Unchanging, pervading three—this is dharmakaya essence. Definition: expanse primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmata, clear-light kaya.

[-20362--20340]
This old vagabond loves classifications—ten aspects, five this, three that.
Yet knows they are fingers, not moon. Dharmakaya: ten ways to describe
the indescribable, ten approaches to the unapproachable, ten doors to
the doorless.

Essence empty-clarity: not empty OR clear but empty-clear, inseparable.
Like sky: empty of obstruction, clear by nature. Cessation without inherent
existence: stopped yet not annihilated, ceased yet present.

[1-336]
Definition of dharmakaya—naturally spontaneous, clear-light kaya, great self-abiding. From Self-Arising: fearless, empty, and clear, all actions complete. Do not fear emptiness—it is clarity itself.

[-20339--20334]
Therefore. Thus. The definition unpacked: naturally spontaneous—not made,
not achieved, not produced. Clear-light kaya: the body of light, the form
of knowing, the shape of awareness. Great self-abiding: resting in itself,
needing no support, requiring no ground.

Fearless: the dharmakaya knows no threat because nothing is other than
it. Empty: without self-nature, without fixed essence. Clear: knowing,
aware, luminous. All actions complete: nothing to do, nothing undone.

[1-336]
Self-body—freed from all extremes of elaboration, without accomplishment anywhere. No outer, no inner, no within expanse. This is dharmakaya's self-body. Stop looking for it as something to find.

[-20333--20328]
This mountain dweller searched for dharmakaya in scriptures, retreats,
visions. Found it nowhere—because nowhere was already it. Self-body:
the body that is not body, the form that is formless, the existence that
is non-existence.

Extremes of elaboration: existence, non-existence, both, neither—all
surpassed. Without accomplishment: nothing to achieve, nothing to become,
nowhere to arrive. Stop looking: the search is the obscuration, the seeking
is the veil.

[1-336]
Metaphors for dharmakaya—six images from Self-Arising: like sun, through clear-light awareness, illuminating all; like ocean, through depth, vast and profound; like lotus, unstained by defects, pure by nature; like mountain, unchanging, immovable; like space, vast without boundary; like lion, possessing primordial confidence.

Sun, ocean, lotus, mountain, space, lion—these point to qualities of your own mind right now.

[-20327--20316]
Six metaphors, six aspects, six ways of knowing the
unknowable. Sun: illuminating without discrimination. Ocean: containing
all without filling. Lotus: pure despite surroundings. Mountain: stable
amid change. Space: accommodating all without resistance. Lion: confident
without pride.

This wanderer has seen all six—sunrise over peaks, ocean at dusk, lotus
in swamp, mountain in storm, sky above all, lion in dream. Each a
reflection of what I sought, each seeking unnecessary.

[1-336]
Sign—transcending going and coming. Without going, without coming, without abiding. This is dharmakaya's self-sign—not somewhere you travel to.

[-20315--20311]
Therefore. Thus. The sign of dharmakaya: no sign, no trace, no mark.
Transcending going and coming: not arriving from somewhere, not departing
to somewhere. Without abiding: not staying, not leaving—beyond the
categories of movement and rest.

Not somewhere you travel to: the journey to dharmakaya is the recognition
that you never left. Like searching for your glasses while wearing them.

[1-336]
Appearance—like empty-clarity of sky's expanse. Unceasing clear tone, empty by essence. Clear yet empty, appearing yet unreal—like the sky.

One without learning...s old fool gazes at sky daily. Empty: nothing there. Clear: everything
visible. Empty-clarity: the nature of appearance itself. Unceasing clear
tone: the hum of existence, the vibration of being, the sound of silence.

Sky metaphor: used often because it works. Empty yet appearing, clear yet
without substance. The dharmakaya appears like this—everywhere, nowhere,
always, never.

[1-336]
Place—great pure memory-thought. Without limit, without object, without grasping. This is dharmakaya's place—not a location on a map.

[-20305--20301]
Therefore. Thus. The place of dharmakaya: memory-thought that is pure,
great, without object. Not memory of past events but the knowing that
remembers itself. Not thought about things but the thinking that knows
itself.

Without limit: no boundary can contain it. Without object: nothing it
depends upon. Without grasping: nothing it holds. Not on any map because
it is the space in which maps appear.

[1-336]
Characteristic—essence, nature, compassion, three inseparable. Not one, not three—indivisible.

[-20300--20295]
This mountain dweller meditated on these three for years. Essence: empty.
Nature: clear. Compassion: pervasive. Three yet one, one yet three.
Indivisible: cannot pull them apart, cannot have one without others.

Like water: wetness, fluidity, transparency—three qualities, one substance.
Essence, nature, compassion—three aspects, one dharmakaya.

[1-336]
Object—self-clear awareness, empty without extremity, adorned within by five lights, spontaneously accomplished. In great inseparability of expanse and awareness. Clear, luminous, unmixed.

[-20294--20288]
Therefore. Thus. The object of dharmakaya: not something perceived but
the perceiving itself. Self-clear: knowing itself without intermediary.
Empty without extremity: not empty in contrast to full, just empty.
Adorned by five lights: decorated by the natural display of wisdom.

Inseparability of expanse and awareness: not two things joined but one
nature appearing as two. Like fire and heat—not separate, not identical.

[1-336]
Intent—view unsevered by direction or side, meditation not established as entity or sign, conduct transcending apprehending and grasping.

[-20287--20284]
A wandering practitioner... had views—many views, firm views, right views. All
severed by direction, limited by side, trapped by perspective. Dharmakaya
view: no direction, no side, no limitation. Unsevered: whole, complete,
without exclusion.

Meditation without entity: not a thing you do, not a state you enter.
Conduct transcending apprehension: action without actor, benefit without
benefactor, virtue without virtuous one.

[1-336]
Dharmakaya's conduct—free from cessation, fixation, attachment. Not something you do—it's what remains when you stop doing. Meditation—crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering. Not a technique, just recognition. View—unseen, yet seeing-complete. Not something to look at, but the looking itself. Fruition—unmade, unarisen. Already perfect. Activity—nothing to accomplish, yet accomplished-complete.

[-20283--20267]
Therefore. Thus. The threefold presentation—view, meditation, conduct,
plus fruition and activity. Each described by negation: free from, not
established, unseen, unmade, nothing to accomplish. Negation points to
what cannot be said positively.

This mountain dweller spent years "doing" meditation. Then realized:
the doing was the obstacle. Stop doing—recognition remains. Crystal-clear,
lucidly nonwavering: not achieved but acknowledged.

[1-336]
Sambhogakaya—five aspects. Essence from Self-Arising: birth exists yet death-free, possessing vajra. Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear. Five fathers, five fields, five clusters. Five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations. Five bases, five paths, five fruitions. Five abodes, five fields, five essences.

[-20266--20251]
Sambhogakaya—the enjoyment body, the body of bliss, the
form of wisdom's play. Five aspects: not limitation but completeness.
Birth exists yet death-free: appears to arise, never ceases. Possessing
vajra: indestructible, unchanging, adamantine.

Five lights, five kayas, five of everything—enumeration expressing
abundance. Not five separate but five aspects of one, five faces of the
same jewel.

[1-336]
Though expressed as birth from expanse, birth lacks self-characteristic—death-free. Death-lord demon conquered. From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges. Arisen wisdom transcends all arising.

[-20250--20243]
Therefore. Thus. The paradox of sambhogakaya: born yet death-free. Birth
from expanse: appearing from dharmakaya, like light from sun. Yet no
self-characteristic: not truly born, not inherently existing. Death-free:
the conqueror of Yama, the lord of death.

Precious jewel treasury: the qualities of awakening, the wealth of wisdom,
the riches of recognition. Emerges: not created but revealed, not made
but discovered.

[1-336]
Five lights: blue, white, yellow, red, green. Five kayas: essence-expanse, unchanging vajra, dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya. Five fathers: Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi. Five mothers: Akashagarbha, Buddha-Lochana, Mamaki, Pandaravasini, SamA cave hermit...8-858]
This old fool once memorized all these names—Buddhas, consorts, families,
directions. Thought knowing names meant knowing reality. Then forgot them
all. The forgetting was more valuable than the knowing.

Five lights: the spectrum of wisdom, the rainbow of awareness. Five
fathers: the male principle, the method aspect, the skillful means. Five
mothers: the female principle, the wisdom aspect, the emptiness knowing.
Union of both: complete awakening.

[1-336]
Five clusters surrounded by five buddhas, periphery ornamented by five lights' enclosure. Five primordials: paths primordially complete, kayas primordially established, rigpa primordially arisen, five lights primordially resonant, defilements primordially liberated.

[-20231--20221]
Therefore. Thus. The mandala structure: center, periphery, enclosure.
Five clusters: the aggregates purified, the afflictions transmuted, the
ordinary made sacred. Five buddhas surrounding: not separate entities
but the nature of the aggregates recognized.

Five primordials: primordial means from the beginning, not achieved,
not created. Paths complete: never needing to be traveled. Kayas
established: never needing to be formed. Rigpa arisen: never needing to
be generated. Lights resonant: always shining. Defilements liberated:
never truly binding.

[1-336]
Five knowledges from realization extent: know as five kayas, five wisdoms, five lights, self-appearance, great liberation free from duality. Five realizations: realize field as expanse, beings as kayas, appearance as light, arise-liberation free from category, wisdom as rigpa.

[-20220--20206]
This mountain dweller spent years seeking realizations—special states,
profound insights, dramatic openings. Then realized: realization is not
achievement but recognition. Five knowledges: not new capacities but
acknowledged ones. Five realizations: not attainments but acknowledgments.

Extent of realization: how far, how deep, how complete. Knowing kayas,
wisdoms, lights, appearance, liberation—all aspects of one recognition.

[1-336]
Five bases: light-clear basis is rigpa, phenomena basis is kunzhi, delusion basis is sems, path basis is lamp, thought basis is wisdom. Five common paths: accumulation, application, seeing, meditation, no-more-learning.

[-20205--20194]
Therefore. Thus. The five bases—ground of different functions. Light-clear:
rigpa, awareness, knowing. Phenomena: kunzhi, all-ground, storehouse.
Delusion: sems, ordinary mind, conceptual thought. Path: lamp, the pointing,
the guidance. Thought: wisdom, even thought can be basis when recognized.

Five common paths: the gradual vehicle's progression. Accumulation: gathering
conditions. Application: preparing the ground. Seeing: first recognition.
Meditation: stabilizing recognition. No-more-learning: completion.

[1-336]
Five uncommon paths: dharmata path of expanse, rigpa path of knowledge, light-clear path of two lamps, trekcho path of arise-liberation, thogal path of expanse-rigpa.

This mountain dweller...d vagabond walked the uncommon paths—the secret, the swift, the
profound. Dharmata path: resting in the nature of phenomena. Rigpa path:
knowing the knower. Light-clear path: the lamps of awareness and appearance.
Trekcho path: cutting through. Thogal path: direct crossing.

Uncommon: not superior but different, not better but swifter, not higher
but more direct. For those with capacity, with preparation, with fortune.

[1-336]
Five fruitions: wisdom fruition liberated in rig, light fruition delusion-appearance ceases, realization fruition delusion-thought clears, self-appearance fruition brought to exhaustion, final fruition dissolves into expanse.

[-20187--20182]
Therefore. Thus. Five fruitions—culminations, completions, fulfillments.
Not achieved gradually but recognized simultaneously. Yet described in
sequence for minds that need progression.

Wisdom fruition: rigpa knowing itself. Light fruition: appearance as
light, delusion seen through. Realization fruition: even thoughts clarified.
Self-appearance fruition: even the self-appearance exhausted. Final
fruition: all dissolves into expanse—return to source, completion of circle.

[1-336]
Five abodes: thigle's abode chitta, wisdom's abode crown, lamp's abode eye, expanse-appearance's abode space, liberation ground's abode purity. Five fields: rigpa's field expanse, lamp's field space, wisdom's field bardo, light's field self-appearance, sambhogakaya's field clusters.

[-20181--20170]
This mountain dweller knows these abodes in his own body. Thigle at heart:
the essence, the bindu, the drop. Wisdom at crown: the thousand-petaled,
the completion, the integration. Lamp at eye: the vision, the seeing,
the light. Expanse in space: the container, the field, the openness.
Liberation in purity: the ground, the basis, the freedom.

Five fields: where things happen, where they play, where they display.
Each with its domain, each with its function, each A signpost points north—the wood is not the destination. the same.

[1-336]
Five essences: rigpa's essence primordial purity, wisdom's essence spontaneous accomplishment, light's essence fivefold, discriminating awareness' essence realization, lamp's essence empty-luminous.

[-20169--20158]
Therefore. Thus. Five essences—the core, the heart, the irreducible.
Rigpa: primordially pure, never stained. Wisdom: spontaneously accomplished,
never achieved. Light: fivefold, the display. Discriminating awareness:
realization, the knowing. Lamp: empty-luminous, the nature of appearance.

Essence: what remains when everything else is stripped away. Not different
from appearance but the nature of appearance, not separate from form but
the truth of form.

[1-336]
Thus fivefold appearances—some are sambhogakaya's essence, some field, some method, some appearance, some discriminating awareness—sambhogakaya explained as unified.

[-20157--20153]
This old fool spent years distinguishing—this is essence, that is field,
this is method, that is appearance. Then saw: distinctions are mind's
play, the reality is unified. Sambhogakaya is one, appearing as many.

Unified: not many made one but many recognized as never other than one.
Like waves and ocean—distinct in name, one in nature.

[1-336]
Definitive terminology—qualities complete, abiding in clear-light purity, both purposes spontaneously complete, wisdom fully manifested, possessing marks and signs with light-ray body. Five "long" meanings: abiding in dharmatā emptiness, pervading all with unmixed clarity, five wisdoms without separation, possessing individual marks unequalled by all, method and wisdom abiding without separation.

Five "cho" meanings: five appearances without marks, self-clear without grasping, vividly equal-abiding in all, clearly even-abiding in objects while emanating, intention toward two kayas with complete play, abiding in grasping-free ground while emanating to ten directions.

Five "dzog" meanings: transcending outer, inner, secret action, appearing simultaneously to aimless objects, complete without falling to sides or going/coming, arisen from nature not made, transcending all action.

Five "pa" meanings: possessing empty wisdom in self, clear individual emptiness without cessation, unceasing wisdom playing as method, clear without thought or grasping, possessing marks and ornaments.

Five "ku" meanings: abiding as grasping-free self-clear essence, possessing individual colors and marks, possessing vajra meaning, possessing individual meaning-signs, clear without outer or inner.

[-20152--20113]
Therefore. Thus. The terminology of completeness: longchen, chödzo,
dzogpa, kaya—each with five aspects, each aspect precise, each precision
The bird calls, you turn to look. The call is not the bird. the same ineffable.

This wanderer studied these terms for years. Each a door, each door opening
to the same room. The Sanskrit and Tibetan, the etymology and definition—
all supports for understanding, all to be transcended in direct recognition.

[1-336]
Characteristics—five families' individual mandalas, unmixed, clear resonance. From Self-Arising: possessing individual colors unmixed, marks and signs beautiful with blazing light-rays, possessing father, mother, and kaya's attire—this is sambhogakaya's characteristic.

[-20112--20105]
Characteristics are what can be described, what appears,
what shows. Five families: distinct yet unified, separate yet interconnected.
Individual mandalas: each with its domain, each complete, each reflecting
all others.

Unmixed: pure, distinct, not confused. Clear resonance: the vibration,
the hum, the ringing of wisdom. Father-mother-kaya: the complete form,
the union, the appearance of enlightenment.

[1-336]
Manner of appearing—nature is single rigpa, yet from expanse-kaya light-kaya radiates to ten directions performing benefit, while rigpa-kaya does not move from expanse, without change, self-appearance clear-light field complete within—two, inner and outer appearance manner. From Self-Arising: one nature, two essences—this is sambhogakaya's appearance.

Manner of abiding—field without acceptance or rejection, indivisible space, five lights' complete expanse, great resonance where emanation radiates. From Self-Arising: no true arising or object, no mind of entering or liberation, no grasping or conduct in between, beyond words of attachment or clinging, transcended both rejected and rejector, beyond object, mind, and intellect, to object without aim self-appearance, grasping-free self-liberation, emanating to ten directions.

[-20104--20076]
Therefore. Thus. The appearance dynamic: one nature, two aspects, three
kayas. Single rigpa yet appearing as light, as benefit, as display. Not
moving yet radiating, not changing yet appearing, not going yet reaching
ten directions.

This mountain dweller sees this in daily life: one awareness, many
thoughts; one sky, many clouds; one ocean, many waves. One nature, two
essences: the unity and multiplicity, the sameness and difference, the
one and the many.

Manner of abiding: not static but dynamic, not fixed but flowing. Field
without acceptance: everything welcome, nothing rejected. Indivisible
space: no boundaries, no divisions, no separations. Five lights' expanse:
the display of wisdom as appearance, the play of emptiness as form.

[1-336]
Nirmanakaya's extensive explanation of place—five aspects: essence, definitive terminology, characteristics, divisions, and method of examinatiWalking the high passes...This old vagabond turns to nirmanakaya—the emanation body, the form of
compassion, the shape of benefit. Five aspects again: the structure of
teaching, the scaffolding of understanding, the frame that holds the
picture.

Essence: what it is. Terminology: what it's called. Characteristics:
what it shows. Divisions: its types. Method: how to know it. Complete
presentation for complete understanding.

This completes the expanded commentary on the three kayas—dharmakaya's
emptiness-clarity, sambhogakaya's enjoyment-display, nirmanakaya's emanation-
benefit. Three yet one, one yet three, the complete mandala of awakening,
the full expression of the treasury of the supreme vehicle.
