[685-705]
Three aspects of expansion—first, completion. From Self-Arising: in pure appearance of three kayas, one complete, two complete, all complete. Wisdom appearing unceasing and clear. Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating. In awareness free from concept, five lights unceasing. In great self-liberation without grasping, outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.

Listen: in awareness released from action, actor and acted complete in single moment. Not gradually—in one moment. In awareness separated from mind, all variety complete. In great clear purity, deluded appearances complete. In great self-liberated self-appearance, other-arisen dharmas complete. Such is manner of three kayas' completion.

[706-714]
Awakening—being without dualistic grasping. From same nature: without action, delusion awakens; without concept, afflictions awaken; without grasping, self-arising awakens; without clinging, conceptual thought awakens; without attachment, ignorance awakens.

See the pattern? Stop grasping and what was confused awakens to what it always was. This is manner of three kayas' awakening.

[715-727]
Expansion—qualities primordially accomplished, spontaneously expansive. From Self-Arising: in awareness free from concept, five lights clear, wisdom expansive; in awareness free from actor/acted, three kayas expand without perceived object; in awareness appearing without object, five lights expand without grasping mind; in awareness great wisdom, self-appearance with meaning, fruit expands.

Not acquiring qualities—recognizing what already is.

[728-750]
Expansive explanation of place—dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya. Dharmakaya has ten aspects: essence, definition, self-body, metaphor, sign, appearance, place, characteristic, object, intent.

Essence: empty-clarity, cessation without inherent existence. Unchanging, pervading three—this is dharmakaya essence. Definition: expanse primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmata, clear-light kaya.

[751-756]
Definition of dharmakaya—naturally spontaneous, clear-light kaya, great self-abiding. From Self-Arising: fearless, empty, and clear, all actions complete. Do not fear emptiness—it is clarity itself.

[757-762]
Self-body—freed from all extremes of elaboration, without accomplishment anywhere. No outer, no inner, no within expanse. This is dharmakaya's self-body. Stop looking for it as something to find.

[763-774]
Metaphors for dharmakaya—six images from Self-Arising: like sun, through clear-light awareness, illuminating all; like ocean, through depth, vast and profound; like lotus, unstained by defects, pure by nature; like mountain, unchanging, immovable; like space, vast without boundary; like lion, possessing primordial confidence.

Sun, ocean, lotus, mountain, space, lion—these point to qualities of your own mind right now.

[775-779]
Sign—transcending going and coming. Without going, without coming, without abiding. This is dharmakaya's self-sign—not somewhere you travel to.

[780-784]
Appearance—like empty-clarity of sky's expanse. Unceasing clear tone, empty by essence. Clear yet empty, appearing yet unreal—like the sky.

[785-789]
Place—great pure memory-thought. Without limit, without object, without grasping. This is dharmakaya's place—not a location on a map.

[790-795]
Characteristic—essence, nature, compassion, three inseparable. Not one, not three—indivisible.

[796-802]
Object—self-clear awareness, empty without extremity, adorned within by five lights, spontaneously accomplished. In great inseparability of expanse and awareness. Clear, luminous, unmixed.

[803-806]
Intent—view unsevered by direction or side, meditation not established as entity or sign, conduct transcending apprehending and grasping.

[807-823]
Dharmakaya's conduct—free from cessation, fixation, attachment. Not something you do—it's what remains when you stop doing. Meditation—crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering. Not a technique, just recognition. View—unseen, yet seeing-complete. Not something to look at, but the looking itself. Fruition—unmade, unarisen. Already perfect. Activity—nothing to accomplish, yet accomplished-complete.

[824-839]
Sambhogakaya—five aspects. Essence from Self-Arising: birth exists yet death-free, possessing vajra. Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear. Five fathers, five fields, five clusters. Five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations. Five bases, five paths, five fruitions. Five abodes, five fields, five essences.

[840-847]
Though expressed as birth from expanse, birth lacks self-characteristic—death-free. Death-lord demon conquered. From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges. Arisen wisdom transcends all arising.

[848-858]
Five lights: blue, white, yellow, red, green. Five kayas: essence-expanse, unchanging vajra, dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya. Five fathers: Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi. Five mothers: Akashagarbha, Buddha-Lochana, Mamaki, Pandaravasini, Samayatara.

[859-869]
Five clusters surrounded by five buddhas, periphery ornamented by five lights' enclosure. Five primordials: paths primordially complete, kayas primordially established, rigpa primordially arisen, five lights primordially resonant, defilements primordially liberated.

[870-884]
Five knowledges from realization extent: know as five kayas, five wisdoms, five lights, self-appearance, great liberation free from duality. Five realizations: realize field as expanse, beings as kayas, appearance as light, arise-liberation free from category, wisdom as rigpa.

[885-896]
Five bases: light-clear basis is rigpa, phenomena basis is kunzhi, delusion basis is sems, path basis is lamp, thought basis is wisdom. Five common paths: accumulation, application, seeing, meditation, no-more-learning.

[897-902]
Five uncommon paths: dharmata path of expanse, rigpa path of knowledge, light-clear path of two lamps, trekcho path of arise-liberation, thogal path of expanse-rigpa.

[903-908]
Five fruitions: wisdom fruition liberated in rig, light fruition delusion-appearance ceases, realization fruition delusion-thought clears, self-appearance fruition brought to exhaustion, final fruition dissolves into expanse.

[909-920]
Five abodes: thigle's abode chitta, wisdom's abode crown, lamp's abode eye, expanse-appearance's abode space, liberation ground's abode purity. Five fields: rigpa's field expanse, lamp's field space, wisdom's field bardo, light's field self-appearance, sambhogakaya's field clusters.

[921-932]
Five essences: rigpa's essence primordial purity, wisdom's essence spontaneous accomplishment, light's essence fivefold, discriminating awareness' essence realization, lamp's essence empty-luminous.

[933-937]
Thus fivefold appearances—some are sambhogakaya's essence, some field, some method, some appearance, some discriminating awareness—sambhogakaya explained as unified.

[938-977]
Definitive terminology—qualities complete, abiding in clear-light purity, both purposes spontaneously complete, wisdom fully manifested, possessing marks and signs with light-ray body.

[978-985]
Characteristics—five families' individual mandalas, unmixed, clear resonance. From Self-Arising: possessing individual colors unmixed, marks and signs beautiful with blazing light-rays, possessing father, mother, and kaya's attire—this is sambhogakaya's characteristic.

[986-1014]
Manner of appearing—nature is single rigpa, yet from expanse-kaya light-kaya radiates to ten directions performing benefit, while rigpa-kaya does not move from expanse, without change, self-appearance clear-light field complete within—two, inner and outer appearance manner. From Self-Arising: one nature, two essences—this is sambhogakaya's appearance.

Manner of abiding—field without acceptance or rejection, indivisible space, five lights' complete expanse, great resonance where emanation radiates. From Self-Arising: no true arising or object, no mind of entering or liberation, no grasping or conduct in between, beyond words of attachment or clinging, transcended both rejected and rejector, beyond object, mind, and intellect, to object without aim self-appearance, grasping-free self-liberation, emanating to ten directions.

[1015-1020]
Nirmanakaya's extensive explanation of place—five aspects: essence, definitive terminology, characteristics, divisions, and method of examination.
