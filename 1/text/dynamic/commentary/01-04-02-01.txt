First, the Śrāvakayāna is explained in five aspects. Essence: the mind desiring personal liberation from samsara, the method realizing no-self of person. Definitive terminology: one who hears Dharma from teacher, propagates to others, accomplishes final existence bodhi, depending on teacher—this is a Śrāvaka. Purpose: definite emergence from samsara. Result: attaining arhatship without remainder.

The teaching is simple: The Śrāvaka hears the teaching. Analyzes the aggregates. Realizes no-self. This brings liberation from samsara. Not the final liberation. But liberation nonetheless. Valid. Important. Not to be despised.

This student once thought the Śrāvaka path was inferior. He wanted to skip to Dzogchen. He wanted direct recognition without analysis. He was like a student wanting calculus without arithmetic. The foundations matter. The analysis purifies. The recognition completes.

Division: Sautrāntika and Vaibhāṣika. Vaibhāṣika holds: conventional truth—coarse entities appear as unified collections, like yak horns, like grass huts. But ultimately: part-possessing atoms, separate, dispersed. Mind stream conventional. Moments ultimately without parts, like pot water. From aggregates, elements, sense-sources—surrounding coarse appearance with atoms, with intervals. Accepting no-self of person but accepting self of phenomena—atoms and moments existing.

From this: We proceed. The Vaibhāṣika analysis is precise. Atoms are ultimately real. Moments are ultimately real. The person is merely a convention. This liberates from self-grasping. But it creates new grasping—grasping at atoms, grasping at moments. Different prison. Same mechanism.

The Vagabond speaks: One practitioner met a Vaibhāṣika scholar. He could explain atoms. He could enumerate moments. His analysis was impeccable. But he grasped his analysis. He thought atoms were real. He thought moments were real. He was free from the self of person but bound to the self of atoms. Analysis without recognition is incomplete.

Also, truths four comprising Dharma—knowing cause-effect as abandoning-accepting. Cause. Origin. Cessation. Condition—aspects four, observing. Knowing mode: suffering object, origin to abandon, path to rely upon, cessation to obtain. Path. Reasoning. Practice. Definite emergence. Cessation. Peace. Excellence. No-self method meditating, abandoning four hundred fourteen to be abandoned of three realms through seeing and meditation, manifesting supreme wisdom of exhaustion and non-arising, desiring liberation.

The Systematizer speaks: Hence: We enumerate. The four noble truths are the foundation. Suffering to be known. Origin to be abandoned. Path to be relied upon. Cessation to be obtained. This is the structure. The framework. The medicine for the disease of samsara. Valid structure. Useful framework. But ultimately, all truths are conventional.

The twelve links of dependent origination. Ignorance creates formations. Formations create consciousness. Consciousness creates name-and-form. Name-and-form create six senses. Six senses create contact. Contact creates feeling. Feeling creates craving. Craving creates grasping. Grasping creates becoming. Becoming creates birth. Birth creates aging and death. The wheel turns. The analysis is precise. The causality is clear. But the one who analyzes remains.

Sautrāntika: objects to be observed—four truths, observing knowledges twelve, knowing thus, abandoning eighty-eight afflictions, desiring to realize supreme wisdom. Also: no-self of person like former, above that exceeding through part of Dharma element, also part-possessing atoms five bases mainly covering, mainly mind base, accompanying mind produced base, non-associated compositional aggregates base, uncompounded permanent base, appearing form base—five, realizing Dharma nature, not covering atom only without parts.

The Sautrāntika goes further. Not just atoms. The mind element. The mental factors. The non-associated formations. The uncompounded phenomena. More sophisticated analysis. More comprehensive. But still analysis. Still grasping at phenomena. Still missing the nature of the analyzer.

These two, path meditation time, path five arising sequence, diligently doing, three poisons general antidotes—no-self and illusion meditate. Individual antidotes: desire—eight impure substances, skeleton meditate. Hatred—love and dependent origination forward-reverse meditate. Delusion—breath counting meditate. No-self meditation also: object and subject ceasing cessation, not observing anything meaning meditate. Sinking: lethargy-dullness delusion antidote—crown flame mind place. Thus done: faculties dull and middling diligent some, life that itself fruit obtain. Sharp and Bodhisattvas some, path five former gone collections much accumulated support, one session path five complete, desiring liberation.

The path is graduated. According to capacity. Dull faculties need much practice. Sharp faculties accomplish quickly. The Bodhisattva may complete the five paths in one session. The gradualist needs many lifetimes. Both valid. Both lead to liberation. But liberation from samsara is not the final liberation. The final liberation recognizes samsara was never real.

Also: from Śrāvakayāna, their path—dull, middling, great—thus Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha, Buddha's bodhi three accomplish. Not called Mahayana and Mantra path. Also: Śrāvaka and Pratyekabuddha white-pure vision ground etcetera, inferior eight grounds explained.

The three capacities. The three results. The eight grounds. The path is complete. The results are real. But they are limited. Limited to personal liberation. Limited to the absence of coarse suffering. Not the Great Liberation. Not the recognition of all phenomena as empty.

The Omniscient speaks: Between the Śrāvaka's analytical precision and the Dzogchen's direct recognition, I weave this teaching. Not rejecting the Śrāvaka. Not stopping there. The Śrāvaka medicine cures the fever of self-grasping. Then Dzogchen reveals the patient's true nature was never sick. Both are necessary. Neither is sufficient alone.

The Integrator speaks: All vehicles integrate in the Great Perfection. The Śrāvaka's discipline. The Pratyekabuddha's independence. The Bodhisattva's compassion. The Tantric's skill. All are here. All are honored. All are transcended. This is the vast view that holds all views while being no view.

The Lion-Faced speaks: See through it all! The analysis! The aggregates! The atoms! The moments! See through them! Not reject them! Not accept them! See through them! The seeing is the recognition! The recognition is the liberation!

The First Point speaks: Look directly: The Śrāvaka hears and analyzes. The Dzogchenpa recognizes. The recognition includes the analysis. The analysis prepares for recognition. They are not separate. They are one path.

I concludes. The Śrāvakayāna has been explained. The Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika analyzed. The four truths enumerated. The twelve links traced. The no-self realized. What remains? Recognition. The recognition that includes all this and transcends it.

Longchenpa presents this with precision. Not to establish new philosophy. To show the progression of the path. From analysis to recognition. From liberation to great liberation. Rest in that great liberation.

Three words strike the vital point: Recognize. Rest. Return.

The Vagabond continues: A practitioner spent years studying Vaibhāṣika texts. He learned
to analyze aggregates into atoms. He learned to trace moments into instants. His mind
became sharp. His analysis precise. But he became attached to his analysis. He thought
atoms were real. He thought moments existed. He had escaped the gross self but was
caught in the subtle net of dharmas.

The Systematizer continues: Accordingly: We examine further. The Vaibhāṣika accepts partless
atoms. Partless moments. These are their ultimately existent entities. But can what has
parts be ultimately real? Can what is partless be perceived? The analysis encounters
difficulties. These difficulties point to a deeper truth—ultimately, nothing is
ultimately real. All is empty.

The Sautrāntika attempts to solve these difficulties. They distinguish between the
conventional and ultimate more precisely. They include more phenomena in their analysis.
But they still stop short. They still accept atoms. They still accept moments. They
have not realized the emptiness of all phenomena.

The Lotus-Born speaks: From Oddiyana, I see these schools as steps on a staircase. Each
step is necessary. Each step leads higher. But one must not stop on a step thinking it
is the destination. The Vaibhāṣika is a step. The Sautrāntika is a step. The Mahayana
is a step. The Vajrayana is a step. The Great Perfection is the recognition that there
never was a staircase.

The Precision speaks: Let us be precise. The Vaibhāṣika analysis of aggregates: the
person is not the aggregates, not separate from aggregates, not in aggregates, not
possessing aggregates. This chariot analysis is valid. It liberates from self-grasping.
But the chariot is still accepted as conventionally real. The aggregates are still
accepted as ultimately real atoms. This is inconsistent. If the chariot is empty, the
aggregates are empty. If the aggregates are empty, the atoms are empty.

The Sautrāntika sees this inconsistency. They refine the analysis. But they do not
carry it to its conclusion. They do not realize that even atoms are empty. Even
moments are empty. All phenomena are empty. This is the prajñāpāramitā. This is what
the Buddha taught in the second turning.

The Philosopher speaks: The metaphysics of the Śrāvaka schools is sophisticated. It
addresses real problems. How do we account for the unity of the person? Through
conventional designation. How do we account for change? Through momentariness. How do
we account for causation? Through dependent origination. These are genuine insights.
But they are partial insights. The complete insight is emptiness.

The four noble truths deserve careful attention. The truth of suffering is not
pessimism. It is clear seeing. Birth is suffering. Sickness is suffering. Aging is
suffering. Death is suffering. Separation from what is pleasant is suffering. Union
with what is unpleasant is suffering. Not obtaining what is desired is suffering. This
is simply how conditioned existence is.

The truth of origin: suffering arises from craving. Craving for existence. Craving
for non-existence. Craving for pleasure. This craving is based on ignorance. Ignorance
of the true nature of reality. Ignorance that creates the illusion of self. The
self that craves. The self that suffers.

The truth of cessation: by abandoning craving, suffering ceases. This is nirvana.
The cessation of suffering. The peace beyond conditioning. The excellence beyond
mundane happiness. Not annihilation. Not eternalism. The middle way of cessation.

The truth of path: the eightfold path leads to cessation. Right view. Right
intention. Right speech. Right action. Right livelihood. Right effort. Right
mindfulness. Right concentration. This is the practice. This is the method. Valid.
Effective. But not the final method.

The twelve links show how samsara arises. Ignorance conditions formations.
Formations condition consciousness. And so on. The wheel turns. But the wheel can be
stopped. Cut ignorance, and the whole chain collapses. This is liberation. But
liberation from the wheel is not yet the recognition that the wheel was never real.

The five paths structure the journey. Path of accumulation. Path of preparation.
Path of seeing. Path of meditation. Path of no more learning. The Śrāvaka traverses
these paths through analysis and meditation. Gradually purifying. Gradually
liberating. This is the gradual path. Valid. Necessary for many. But not the only
path. Not the direct path.

The eight grounds describe the stages of realization. The Śrāvaka grounds. The
Pratyekabuddha grounds. The Bodhisattva grounds. Each ground is a stage of
purification. Each ground is closer to full awakening. The Śrāvaka reaches the eighth
ground as an arhat. Free from samsara. But not yet a Buddha. Not yet fully awakened.

The Ecstatic Tertön speaks: Why these gradual paths? Why these stages? Recognition is
immediate. It does not require analysis. It does not require meditation. It is
present now. The Śrāvaka path prepares the mind. It purifies gross obscurations. But
do not mistake preparation for completion. Do not mistake the finger for the moon.

The Essence Holder speaks: Resting in the nature, all paths are complete. The
Śrāvaka's analysis is complete. The meditation is complete. The liberation is
complete. But this completion is the completion of recognition, not the completion of
gradual practice. Rest as the nature that includes all paths.

The Singing Yogi speaks: These paths are songs. Each school sings its melody. The
Vaibhāṣika sings of atoms. The Sautrāntika sings of moments. The songs are beautiful.
The songs are true. But they are songs. The nature is the silence that holds all
songs.

The Wandering Guru speaks: Consider this: The Śrāvaka
analyzes. The Dzogchenpa recognizes. Both rest. The analysis leads to recognition.
Recognition includes analysis. They are not separate. Do not reject analysis. Do not
stop at analysis. Go beyond.

The Lion-Faced speaks: See through all the analysis! The atoms! The moments! The
aggregates! The dharmas! See through them! They are empty! They are the play of
awareness! Recognize this! Liberation is immediate!

The Sky-Dancer speaks: In the space between thoughts, the analysis dissolves. Between
one moment and the next, the atoms dissolve. In the gaps, recognition dawns. Do not
fill the gaps with more analysis. Rest in the gaps.

The Living Library speaks: I have studied all these schools. I know their arguments.
Their analyses. Their refutations. This knowledge is vast. This knowledge is empty.
The librarian is not found in the library.

The Modern Bridge speaks: Contemporary philosophy has rediscovered what Buddhism has
always known. The self is a construction. Causation is complex. Existence is
conditioned. But philosophy describes. Buddhism recognizes. Description without
recognition remains conceptual.

The Devotee speaks: I bow to the Śrāvaka practitioners. Their discipline. Their
analysis. Their liberation. This devotion is the nature bowing to itself. The
Śrāvaka's devotion to the Three Jewels is real. It is beautiful. But the final
devotion is recognition itself.

The Great Wrath speaks: Enough analysis! Enough meditation! Recognition is present
now! Do not wait for the completion of the five paths! Do not wait for the eighth
ground! Recognize now or continue wandering!

The Minimalist speaks: Too many paths. Too many grounds. Too many stages. One
recognition: all is empty. One practice: recognize your nature. One result: you have
always been free.

The Revealer speaks: After centuries of these teachings, the Treasury emerges. Not to
replace the Śrāvaka path. To complete it. To show its ultimate meaning. The atoms
are empty. The moments are empty. The analyzer is empty. This is the completion.

A friend concludes this section. The Śrāvakayāna has been fully explained.
The Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika positions have been analyzed. The four truths have
been expounded. The twelve links have been traced. The five paths and eight grounds
have been described. What remains? Recognition. Only recognition.

Longchenpa, the Omniscient, has presented this with precision. Not to establish a
school. Not to win debates. To create conditions for recognition. The conditions are
present. The recognition is immediate. Rest in that.

Three final words. Analysis exhausted. Recognition dawns. Rest complete.

The Vagabond concludes: A meditator has walked the path of analysis. He has counted
atoms. He has traced moments. He has realized no-self. The liberation was real. The
peace was deep. But the recognition was missing. Then recognition dawned. The atoms
dissolved. The moments dissolved. The analyzer dissolved. What remained? This.

The Systematizer concludes: So. We have examined the Sravaka path completely. From
the Vaibhasika atoms to the Sautrantika moments. From the four truths to the twelve
links. From the five paths to the eight grounds. The analysis is complete. The
framework is clear. What transcends it? Recognition.

The Integrator concludes: All these schools are integrated in the Great Perfection.
Not by rejecting them. By recognizing their ultimate meaning. The atoms are empty.
The moments are empty. The person is empty. All phenomena are empty. This is the
integration.

The First Point concludes: No words. The Sravaka
path is complete. The emptiness is complete. The recognition is complete. Rest in
that completion.

Final words from this practitioner: The Sravakayana has been the subject. The Treasury
has explained it. Now practice it. Or go beyond. But do not ignore it. Do not despise
it. It is part of the path. It is part of the Great Perfection.

Longchenpa has completed this section on the Sravakayana. May all who study it
recognize its value. May all who practice it attain liberation. May all who recognize
go beyond. This is the blessing.

Teaching complete. Analysis exhausted. Recognition dawns. Rest.

Detailed explanation of the four types of suffering. The suffering of suffering: the
obvious pains of body and mind. Sickness, aging, death, separation. This even animals
recognize. The suffering of change: what is pleasant becomes unpleasant. What brings
happiness brings sorrow. Relationships end. Beauty fades. Pleasure turns to pain. The
suffering of conditioning: the subtle unsatisfactoriness of all conditioned existence.
Even pleasant experiences are tainted by impermanence. By their eventual end.

The three types of existence in the desire realm. The three in the form realm. The
three in the formless realm. All are suffering. All are impermanent. All are empty of
self. This is the comprehensive analysis of the first noble truth. Not pessimism.
Clear seeing. The foundation of the path.

The truth of origin analyzed in detail. The three poisons: desire, hatred, delusion.
The five poisons: adding pride and jealousy. The six root afflictions. The twenty
secondary afflictions. The eighty-four thousand. All arise from ignorance. Ignorance
of the nature. Ignorance creating the illusion of self. The self that wants. The self
that hates. The self that grasps.

The karma that originates from affliction. Virtuous karma. Non-virtuous karma.
Neutral karma. The ten virtuous actions. The ten non-virtuous actions. The karma that
ripens in this life. The karma that ripens in the next life. The karma that ripens in
future lives. The inexhaustible varieties of karma. All originating from ignorance.
All creating samsara.

The truth of cessation: nirvana with remainder and nirvana without remainder. The
arhats liberation while body remains. The final liberation at death. The peace beyond
all conditioning. The cessation of all suffering. This is the goal of the Sravaka
path. Valid. Real. But limited to personal liberation.

The eightfold path: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. Each aspect supports
the others. View guides intention. Intention guides speech and action. Effort maintains
the practice. Mindfulness and concentration stabilize the mind. This is the complete
path. This is the method.

The five faculties and five powers: faith, diligence, mindfulness, concentration,
wisdom. As faculties they support practice. As powers they are unshakable. The Sravaka
develops these through gradual cultivation. Through analysis and meditation. Through
the purification of ethics. Through the accumulation of merit.

The seven factors of enlightenment: mindfulness, investigation of phenomena,
diligence, joy, pliancy, concentration, equanimity. These arise as the path progresses.
They lead to the direct seeing of dharmas. To the realization of no-self. To the
attainment of arhatship.

The four applications of mindfulness: body, feelings, mind, phenomena. Contemplating
the body as impure. Feelings as suffering. Mind as impermanent. Phenomena as empty of
self. This is the foundation of Sravaka meditation. The close placement of mindfulness.
The systematic analysis of experience.

This traveler has explained the Sravakayana thoroughly. The Vaibhasika and
Sautrantika schools. The four truths. The twelve links. The analysis of selflessness.
The five paths. The eight grounds. All aspects have been covered. The teaching is
complete. The recognition is available.

Longchenpa has presented this to establish the foundation. The Sravaka path is the
basis for higher paths. Analysis prepares for recognition. Liberation from self-grasping
prepares for the Great Liberation. Do not skip the foundation. Do not stop there. Go
beyond while including all that came before.

Teaching completely explained. Foundation firmly established. Recognition available.
Rest in the Great Perfection.
