Definitive terminology: "kaya" because body is complete. In the Buddha-ground, though there is neither body nor entity, names alone do not contradict. From the Ratnagotravibhaga (Dkon mchog sgron me):

"The dharmakaya is the body of the Victors. By seeing, purifying views, one will know."

Just as it is said. Here's the key point: Dharmakaya isn't a physical body, yet it's called "body." Sambhogakaya has no marks, yet it appears with marks. Nirmanakaya has no fixation, yet it appears in various forms. These aren't contradictions—they're the play of emptiness and appearance (stong gzugs)!

Divided: Dharmakaya free from elaborations; Sambhogakaya free from marks; Nirmanakaya free from fixation. Rest in this understanding.

Complexity untangles itself when seen—before analysis, already complete.

The knot knows how to untie—before analysis, already complete. From Tsal Dzog:

"Essence of kaya without change,
Definitive terminology of kaya possessing clear radiance,
Shown as divided into various aspects,
Possessing dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya.

The trail is the terrain.

Ma rig pa ye shes su shar—delusion dawns as wisdom wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Characteristic of dharmakaya free from thought,
Characteristic of sambhogakaya without clear cognition,
Characteristic of nirmanakaya showing various.

The final barrier is the one building barriers—seen through, it falls.

No journey needed—already there."

This is profound. Each kaya has its own characteristic: dharmakaya is beyond thought, sambhogakaya is beyond ordinary cognition, nirmanakaya shows variety. Yet they're not separate—they're three aspects of the same enlightened nature.

Regarding speech also: essence empty of sound, definitive terminology various Dharma heaps appearing in the expanse. Divided: the speech of great enlightened activity, appearing whatever tames whomever; Brahma's speech appearing as sixty branches; six realms' self-appearance and harmonious speech appearing according to each sound; beings' believing speech, sound satisfying the faculties; symbolic speech, making meaning understood through symbols shown; word-speech, afflictions purified through sound reaching trainees' ears.

These also are distinguished through the essential identity of nirmanakaya alone. For sambhogakaya, merely symbols. For dharmakaya, from unexpressible meaning-speech, appearance does not exist. The speech appearing as nirmanakaya is like the aspect of an echo.

Listen! Buddha speech isn't "someone talking." It's empty, yet it appears. It's like an echo—sound without a source. It appears in whatever form is needed to benefit beings. Sometimes as formal teaching, sometimes as ordinary conversation, sometimes as symbols, sometimes just as words. All are Buddha speech when recognized!

Emaho! The kayas, speech, and mind are complete!

Listen here! Buddha's speech—it's appearance without inherent existence. Like an echo, like a reflection. It appears to trainees through the gathering of their merit and the Buddha's blessing, but in reality, there are no syllables with self-characteristic.

From the Gyud Lama (Uttaratantra):

"The speech of the Victors
Is like an echo, without letters." Each phrase indicates the beyond.

Recognition arises in the space between—this very gap.

Seeing simplifies the complex—before analysis, already complete.

And just as an echo's sound
Arises from others' cognition,
Without conceptual fabrication or contrivance—
Just so is the Tathagata's speech.

Obstacles exist only for the one who thinks they need to overcome them.

What seems opposed to wisdom IS wisdom, unrecognized wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Arising from others' cognition,
Without conceptual fabrication,
Just so is the Tathagata's speech.
Not abiding outside or inside.

Understanding misses it; recognition sees what concepts cannot hold.

The ground holds all paths.

What does this mean? When the Buddha speaks, he's not really "saying" anything! The words appear to you based on your own mind, your own karma, your own capacity. The Buddha doesn't open his mouth and produce syllables. The syllables appear spontaneously in your mind based on causes and conditions. This is the magical display of enlightened speech!

Don't think the Buddha is somewhere "over there" giving a talk. The teaching appears directly in your own awareness. The sound is empty, yet it appears. It's a reflection, an echo—profoundly clear, yet without inherent existence.

From Tsal Dzog (Complete Potency): Language points past language. Nothing needs to be added to the nature.

Ma rig pa is ye shes in disguise—recognition reveals wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is hard is only hard for the seeker—recognition is effortless.

"Empty of the nature (rang bzhin) of speech appearing,
Various definitive terminology of speech arises,
Shown as divided into six aspects:
The speech of Buddha's enlightened activity,
Brahma's divine offering-speech,
The self-sounds of six realms' confusion,
Beings' believing taming-speech,
The secret mother's symbolic speech,
Various sounds shown as speech.

In the pause between mind-moments, awareness recognizes itself.

Opening what was never shut—never partial."

These are the six types of Buddha speech! The enlightened speech isn't just one thing—it manifests differently depending on the context. Sometimes it's the formal speech of enlightened activity, sometimes it appears as divine speech, sometimes as the confused sounds of beings, sometimes as teaching that tames the mind, sometimes as secret symbolic communication. All of these are manifestations of the same enlightened speech, appearing according to what's needed.

Don't get stuck thinking Buddha speech means "the Buddha talking." It can appear as anything—wind in the trees, the cry of a bird, a stranger's words. When you're ready to hear the Dharma, the Dharma appears. That's Buddha speech!

Third, regarding Mind—its essence is without confusion. Its definitive terminology: awareness clear in its own place. Divided: the mind of wisdom of abandonment perfectly complete, memory awakened; the mind of wisdom of realization perfectly complete, unchanging vajra mind; the mind of wisdom of enlightened activity perfectly complete, various knowing minds—three.

This is not a concept to grasp but awareness showing its own face.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

From That Very:

"Essence of mind without confusion,
Definitive terminology of mind appearing to thought,
Shown as divided into three:
Mind itself memory-awakened,
Vajra unchanging mind, and
Shown as various-knowing mind.

Complexity is simplicity wearing a mask—before analysis, already complete.

The deluded mind is wisdom not recognizing itself wisdom appearing as confusion wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating."

The Buddha's mind isn't something distant, something other. It's awareness clear in its own place—your own awareness! The three aspects are: the awakened memory (not forgetting the nature (rang bzhin) of reality), the unchanging vajra mind (not subject to birth and death), and the omniscient mind knowing all things.

But here's the key: these aren't three separate minds. They're three aspects of the same awareness. Your awareness, right now, has these qualities. You just don't recognize them yet!

Fourth, regarding Qualities—their essence is the perfectly complete Dharma of the Buddha-ground. Definitive terminology: like a jewel, because all perfect excellent qualities arise spontaneously. Divided:

The qualities of the basis—dharmakaya abiding in its own place, self-benefit complete;
The qualities of the path-appearance—sambhogakaya clear in the mandala, other-benefit appearing.

What seems difficult is only difficult for the one who seeks.

What appears difficult dissolves in recognition—immediately (cig car).

This is the completion of the three kayas and five aspects. The qualities aren't something the Buddha acquires—they're spontaneously present, like a jewel naturally radiating light. Self-benefit is complete through dharmakaya. Other-benefit appears through sambhogakaya. Both are natural expressions of enlightened nature.

Stop looking for qualities somewhere else! They're right here, in your own nature, spontaneously complete. You don't need to build them up—you need to recognize what's already present!

Emaho! What a wonder!

The qualities that carry to the end, the nirmanakaya guiding beings, connecting to the ultimate dharmakaya. Recognition is immediate.

The elaborate is simple when recognized—before analysis, already complete.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. From That Very:

"The essence of qualities produces all,
The definitive terminology of qualities accomplishes various,
Divided, shown as three:
Qualities abiding in the basis,
Qualities appearing in the path,
Qualities carrying to the end.

The way is where you stand.

What's tangled smooths itself—before analysis, already complete."

This is the structure of enlightened qualities—they're not just in the result, they're present throughout: in the ground (gzhi) (basis), on the path, and in the fruition. Don't think you have to wait until you're enlightened to experience Buddha-qualities. They're present right now, in your own nature, if you recognize them!

Fifth, regarding enlightened activity also: essence, definitive terminology, division into three. The essence of enlightened activity is benefiting beings, spontaneously accomplishing until samsara is not emptied. From the Abhisamayalankara:

"Likewise, as long as this existence remains,
Activity is asserted to be uninterrupted." The treasury was never concealed, only overlooked.

This is crucial! A Buddha's activity doesn't stop. As long as there are beings in samsara, enlightened activity continues spontaneously, effortlessly. It's not that Buddhas "try" to help—helping is their nature, like the sun naturally shines.

Definitive terminology: The enlightened activity of the three kayas, acting for trainees, purifying karma and afflictions, connecting to the level of Buddha. Knowing the realm of trainees and latent tendencies, accomplishing their benefit appropriately, without possessing effort or exertion—like the moon's reflection appearing in water.

From the Gyud Lama (Uttaratantra):

"The realm of trainees, the taming action,
Their abode and suchness—
The Lord always spontaneously engages."

No simplification needed—just seeing—before analysis, already complete.

Concepts point but cannot capture—mind's nature shines directly.

This is the nature (rang bzhin) of Buddha activity—completely natural, completely responsive. Like the moon reflecting in water, it appears without the moon "trying" to reflect. The reflection appears when conditions are present. So too with enlightened activity.

Divided into four: From the Rigpa Rangshar Chenpo Gyud: This is the treasury's heart.

Between thoughts, awareness rests in its own nature.

Longchenpa shows what must be seen directly pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

"Peaceful and expansive,
Likewise powerful and wrathful." Never hidden, the treasury shows itself, only overlooked.

The difficulty is thinking there's something difficult to do.

The maze reveals itself as path—before analysis, already complete.

Peaceful activity purifies beings' obscurations and serves as the method for pacifying all suffering, causing the ornament wheel of inexhaustible qualities to arise. Expansive activity increases beings' qualities and fulfills all desires and hopes. Powerful activity harmoniously gathers beings, and through the great river of empowerment ripens the unripened extensively. Wrathful activity cuts through the vicious, presses the three realms into the expanse, and having overwhelmed the three realms, liberates samsara into nirvana, establishing all in the fruition of supreme awakening.

These four activities—peaceful, expansive, powerful, wrathful—are the skillful means by which Buddhas work with beings. Not everyone needs the same medicine. Some need peace, some need expansion, some need empowerment, some need wrathful intervention. The Buddha knows what each being needs and responds appropriately.

This is the completion of the discussion of spontaneous accomplishment. The path is complete. The ground has been explained, the path detailed, the fruition described. Everything is present, complete, spontaneously accomplished.

What are you going to do with it?

The Buddha activity—body, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity—adorned by the ornament wheel's pure realm, completely perfect and greatly expanded. This is the fruition, the result of all practice. Not just personal enlightenment, but the complete manifestation of all enlightened qualities.

From the Senge Tsal Dzogchen Gyud, the tantra of Lion Power Great Perfection:

"Buddha activity accomplishes the essence,
Buddha activity does what needs to be done,
Divided, shown as four aspects."

Between one thought and another—awareness meeting itself.

Not found through analysis; awareness meets itself here.

And then: Emaho!

Peaceful and expansive,
Likewise powerful and wrathful—
Peaceful gathers into dharma-nature expanse,
Expansive shows various essences,
Powerful ripens the unripened,
Wrathful cuts through everything completely.

No opening required—done without doing.

Longchenpa indicates what words cannot reach pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

These are the four types of enlightened activity. Don't think "activity" means doing things in the ordinary sense. This is Buddha-activity—spontaneous, natural, effortless manifestation that benefits beings according to their needs. Sometimes peaceful, sometimes expansive, sometimes powerful, sometimes wrathful. All are compassion in different forms.

This is the conclusion of the 25th chapter on spontaneous accomplishment, the final chapter. Thus, the mansion of excellent explanation, the jewel mansion, reaches the end of the dharmadhatu sky, completely arranged without exception, vast collections of inexhaustible Dharma topics, fulfilling the hopes of embodied beings, raining down like the wish-fulfilling jewel.

The glorious auspicious sun of bliss increases the feast of joy. The Teacher's Dharma rain falls in the three worlds. Those with various trainees to guide, possessing limitless followers—among them, the peak of great perfection, supreme and secret—this amazing, wondrous, authentic offering, clearly opened.

Longchenpa is describing his own work! Not with pride, but with dedication. He's offering this Treasury as a jewel mansion, a stupa of Dharma, reaching to the ends of space, benefiting all beings.

The object of the Omniscient Lord of Mind's activity is whatever spreads through the realm of beings with fortune. The stainless, dust-free, fresh red sun beautifies the mansion of my intelligence. Even very difficult to realize realms should be seen by self and others.

Whatever appears as the nature (rang bzhin) of this—the place of deep ocean waves, the lake of unprecedented wisdom, even shaking the throne of conceptual fixation—the glorious great lake Unshakable, that unmoving, without waves or disturbance, deep and vast, difficult to realize, that has today appeared before my mind.

He's describing the nature (rang bzhin) of mind itself—the ocean of wisdom, unmoving, deep, vast. And he's saying: today, it has appeared. Not "I realized it" but "it appeared"—as if the wisdom dawned on its own, through the power of the practice and dedication.

The ocean of vidyadharas, the assembly of oath-bound protectors, open the eye of delight in this. Through the profound and vast vajra realm, this stainless jewel mansion, extremely clear in nature, makes the Luminosity Heart Essence teaching remain long in the world, revealing the good path for the fortunate, causing the lotus of liberation to bloom.

From the sleep of the powerful holy elephant, concerned that the profound key points would be scattered and lost in other established philosophical systems, without delay, in the 25th chapter of Buddha's collection, gathering the heart meaning in one direction, I respectfully made it a support for the mind.

This is Longchenpa's explanation of why he wrote this text—to preserve the profound teachings from being lost, to gather the essential meaning, to make it accessible while keeping it profound.

The text continues with extensive architectural metaphors comparing this Treasury to a great stupa, a mansion, a mountain of Dharma. The unsurpassed vehicle's Mount Meru, spontaneously high, the four-sided vase completely round, the conch of profound instruction, the wheel of Dharma limitless, the sun and moon of base, path, and fruition moved by wind, the flower and bell completely raised, the white parasol's peak, the jewel pinnacle vast.

This is the completion, the sealing of the entire work. After 415 pages, 25 chapters, thousands of verses—Longchenpa has built a mansion of Dharma, a stupa of wisdom, a treasury of jewels. And he offers it to you.

Listen to this call to action: "Therefore, faithful ones desiring liberation, strive to enter this jewel treasury! Having separated from the darkness of non-recognition, luminosity manifest, in this life go to the other shore of the three realms' ocean!"

This is it! The whole point. Don't just read—enter! Don't just study—realize! Go to the other shore in this very life. This is possible. This is what Longchenpa is offering you.

The rest of the page is dedication of merit—offering the virtue of composing this immense work to all beings, wishing them to pacify the defilements of mind, to realize self-knowing luminosity like the sun and moon, to obtain the ground (gzhi) of spontaneously accomplished vajra peak possessing all supreme qualities, and to accomplish benefit and happiness for beings without separation of body and wisdom.

This is how you complete a Dharma text—with dedication, with offering, with the vow to benefit all beings. Take this into your heart. Don't let it be just words. Let it transform you!

Listen to this dedication! "Possessing a garland of lightning of the great cloud of excellent explanation, the rain of nectar of words and meaning falls from the path of the mind's sky." Longchenpa is saying: this text is like a storm of blessings!

The excellent explanation (*legs bshad*) is the great cloud (*sprin chen*). The hearing (*thos pa*) is the lightning (*glog*) that illuminates. From the sky of mind (*yid mkha'*), the rain of nectar (*bdud rtsi'i char*) falls. This fulfills the hopes of all beings without exception, increases the merit and harvest, and with the prosperity of the Victorious Ones, fills all beings with satisfaction, dispelling the poverty of existence and peace.

This is how you close a Dharma text—not with "The End" but with "May all benefit!" Every word written, every page composed, becomes an offering to all beings. This is the bodhisattva vow in action.

The elements of all directions, as long as embodied beings remain—may this treasury of holy Dharma remain and accomplish limitless benefit and happiness! May the world and all beings, blissful and prosperous like the god realms, all abide on the path of liberation and simultaneously attain Buddhahood!

These aren't empty wishes. When a master like Longchenpa dedicates merit, it has power. He's not just hoping—he's establishing a connection, a field of merit that extends through time and space to benefit beings far into the future. Including you, right now, reading this.

May all sentient beings, completely victorious over existence, without effort attain nirvana! May samsara be emptied and the grove of peace expand! May they become Dharma Kings of spontaneously accomplished twofold benefit!

The twofold benefit (*don gnyis*) is benefit for self and benefit for others. This is the mark of a Buddha—not just personal liberation, but the capacity to liberate all beings. And Longchenpa dedicates his work toward this end for all.

Through this supreme virtue, the source of benefit and happiness, may the Buddha's teachings spread and expand! May the glory of the jewel of limitless qualities blaze! May the holy Dharma of luminosity-heart essence expand!

What appears as ignorance is awareness forgetting itself wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Recognition dawns in the gaps—the intervals between.

He's dedicating to the preservation and spread of the teachings. Not just his own text, but the entire Dharma. This is vast mind—beyond personal achievement, beyond sectarian concerns, toward the welfare of all beings through the preservation of the teachings.

Leading limitless beings to the ground (gzhi) of near-peace with limitless life, beautified by forests, lakes, islands, flower-medicine realms everywhere, possessing eyes, clairvoyance, and concentration that discover unprecedented Dharma treasures, may they be filled with the fame and praise, the sound of drums, worshipped by Brahma and others, kinnaras! The nature lacks nothing.

The one who seeks to understand dissolves in the seeing.

Immediate liberation (cig car ba)—not difficult, just unrecognized.

This is pure land imagery—the vision of a world transformed by Dharma. But it's not just imagination; it's the result of practice. When you cultivate virtue, when you dedicate merit, you create the causes for such a world to manifest. This is how reality is shaped—through intention, through dedication, through the power of virtue.

Transcending the path of the thousand-light-ray doer, infinitely vast, praised by the Victorious Ones as the ornament of the world, the supreme medicinal eye—through whatever auspiciousness beautifies all beings, falling like rain as praise-songs and flowers, may this supreme Dharma system fill the realms with an ocean of auspiciousness! Rest in this understanding.

Beyond concept, awareness simply is—this is the showing.

Concepts fall away; what remains is mind's nature displaying itself.

May my activity, establishing an ocean of bliss-joy completely, be like that, maturing the ocean of beings dwelling in hundreds of oceans, pleasing them all!

Longchenpa is dedicating his merit to span countless realms, countless eons, countless beings. This isn't modesty—this is the natural expression of realized mind. When you realize the nature (rang bzhin) of reality, your benefit for beings becomes as vast as space itself.

Those whose wisdom and concentration are as vast as the sky-expanse, whose thought and conduct are vast oceans, immeasurable, vast in benefiting others, whose luminosity sun-moon appearance is vast, whose activities are vast, whose unchanging dharma-nature appearance enters the vast dharmadhatu—may they all! Rest in this understanding.

Confusion is wisdom wearing a mask—recognition removes it wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Recognition dissolves the intricate—before analysis, already complete.

This is the . Vastness upon vastness. The realized mind isn't small, isn't limited, isn't constrained by ordinary conceptions. It's as vast as space, as deep as the ocean, as luminous as the sun and moon.

This is what you've been reading. This is what Longchenpa offers. Don't let it be just words—let it transform your mind into this same vastness!

Look at this image Longchenpa paints! Just as in the clear night sky, the moon (*ri bong 'dzin zer can*—the one holding the rabbit, i.e., the moon with its rabbit-shaped mark) radiates light, and the constellations fill the mandala at the center, causing the kunda flower groves to bloom—just so, this text radiates wisdom light!

The hundred rays of the heart essence (*snying po'i 'od brgya pa*) illuminate the sky of intelligence, the hundred-fold array of primordial wisdom's clear radiance. This is what you've been reading—not mere words, but light itself! The excellent path of the vajra heart essence becomes visible, causing the lotus of good fortune's intelligence to bloom.

Don't you see? The Dharma isn't a book you read—it's light that illuminates your mind. When you encounter these teachings, when you really let them in, the lotus of your own wisdom nature opens. That's the point of all of this!

From the grove of lotuses of the supreme vehicle's heart essence, these various self-liberated yogis are born. Having taught the meaning of luminosity-heart essence, the Stainless Light Ray Thousand (*dri med 'od zer stong ldan*)—this is Longchenpa himself speaking through his composition—has gone forth.

All the key points of the secret nature, without exception, he has shown directly and unmistakenly to those with fortune. Klong chen rab 'byams bzang po—Longchenpa's name, "Vast Expanse Good Infinite"—he is the one who taught this. Tshul khrims blo gros bzang po (Longchenpa's full ordination name), in this manner, in this very year—he proclaims it!

This is the master's seal. He's not hiding. He's saying: I, Longchenpa, composed this. I stand behind it. The teachings are authentic, direct, complete.

To those dwelling now and those coming in the future, to those fortunate ones who follow in later generations—with these key instructions of ultimate meaning (*mthar thug don gyi gnad*), with these intimate oral instructions (*gdams zin*), strive in practice! Apply yourself with diligence!

This isn't a casual suggestion. Longchenpa is looking through time, speaking directly to YOU, centuries later. He's saying: Don't just read this—practice it! The instructions are here, complete. What are you waiting for?

The secret treasury is extremely vast. The tantras, scriptures, and oral instructions are numerous. The vajra treasury is deep and difficult to realize. Therefore, this supreme vehicle treasury, gathering all their meanings, is precious.

Having pleased the glorious protector, the holy guru, these profound treasuries are gathered here without error. The ocean-vast expanse of scripture, reasoning, and oral instruction—this place profound and vast is supreme and exalted.

Longchenpa is telling you: I didn't make this up. This comes from the vast ocean of the Buddha's teachings, the guru's blessings, the profound treasury. This is authentic transmission, not intellectual fabrication.

From now on, do not show this to those without fortune. Do not discuss these uncommon philosophical positions in gatherings. Do not alter or change these words!

This is the seal of secrecy—not to hide the Dharma, but to protect it from misunderstanding. The teachings of Dzogchen are powerful. In the wrong hands, they become objects of debate, intellectual games, or worse. Keep them sacred. Preserve them purely.

This treasury is entrusted to the glorious consort of mantra (*sngags kyi bdag mo*), to the great lay practitioner of the planets Rahu (*gza' yi dge bsnyen chen po rA hu la*), to the protector Damchen Dorje Legpa. Protect it! Guard it as the command of the Buddha!

These are the protectors of the text. In Tibet, texts are entrusted to dharmapalas—protectors who ensure the teachings remain pure and available to suitable recipients. This is how seriously Longchenpa takes this work.

If in this there are errors, omissions, additions, or discrepancies in the source text—let the blood of their heart play as a festival of joy! Let their breath be cut off, their vitality stolen, their eyes and hearts cast on the ground (gzhi)!

Strong words! But this is traditional—protecting the text from corruption. Longchenpa is saying: May anyone who distorts these teachings face the consequences. This ensures the purity of the transmission across generations.

By the ocean assembly of the oath-bound guardians of the vidyadharas' command, bless those fortunate ones who practice this! Having completed all wishes and desires, may they awaken to Buddhahood in the primordial ground!

This is the . Not just for the author, but for you, the practitioner. May you be blessed. May your practice succeed. May you realize the ultimate nature, right where you are, in the primordial ground of being.

This is the end of the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle. What a journey! Don't let it end here—let it begin here.

Ah, here we are! Look at this—Longchenpa is signing his name to the work, but not with pride, with devotion. "Rab gsal blo gros"—the one with brilliant intelligence, stainless, following the noble path. He's describing himself through his qualities, not his ego. This is how a true master speaks: through the Dharma, not about himself.

And look who he's offering this to: "mang thos yon tan shin tu rgya che"—those who have heard much, whose qualities are vast, who desire awakening in one lifetime. This is you! If you've made it to this page, if you've held this text in your hands, if these words have entered your ears—Longchenpa wrote this for you. This supreme vehicle, this door to the unsurpassable—he placed it as a treasure (*mdzod*) right here, as ornament for the crown of faith.

Emaho! Like the jewels of the naga kings, this text is precious beyond measure. It doesn't belong in a dusty library—it belongs in your heart!

Listen to these praises! The speech of the Buddha, stainless qualities, the peak of unsurpassable vehicles—this is the secret treasury of the Victorious Ones (*rgyal ba'i gsang mdzod*), wondrous and amazing. This treasury of jewels is difficult to manifest in the world. But here it is, appearing before you!

Like the udumbara flower that blooms once in an age—wondrous and rare—this text appears for those with fortune (*skal bzangs*). And whoever hears this, whoever holds it, whoever lets it penetrate their mind—they are the great bodhisattvas of the final existence. This isn't exaggeration! This is the power of the Dharma. Just to encounter this teaching plants the seed of liberation.

White Dharma shining vast, adorned with the auspicious mandala of sun and moon—this is the offering. Space and time, the secret peak of the Victorious Ones, auspicious light rays equal to the limits of space—this is the vision.

Making distinctions undoes the maker—seeing this is the teaching. Buddha activity without limit, fulfilling all hopes and desires—this is the prayer. The piled-up auspiciousness of the glorious sun of auspiciousness—may there be auspiciousness in all times!

Don't skip over these verses as mere poetry. This is the completion, the sealing of the work. When you finish a great Dharma text, you dedicate the merit. You don't just close the book and walk away—you offer it to all beings. This is the bodhisattva path in action.

"The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Jewel Treasury"—this is its name. Through limitless, immeasurable Dharma topics, the meaning of the result is definitively established. This place of unexcelled secret essence, luminosity, vajra heart—this is what you've been reading. This vast collection of the Tathagata's speech, the ocean of philosophical positions of self and other transcended—this is the work of the Omniscient Lord of Speech (*kun mkhyen ngag gi dbang po*), Longchenpa himself.

Completed! (*rdzogs so*)

Take a moment. Breathe. You've reached the end of one of the most profound texts ever written in Tibetan Buddhism. Not just read it—completed it. This is a milestone in your spiritual life. Don't let it pass unnoticed.

Dge'o! Dge'o! Dge'o! Virtue! Virtue! Virtue! The obstacle is the path in disguise—seen through, it guides.

The chest was always empty and full—finished before starting.

Recognition in the interval—between this thought and the next.

Three times he proclaims it. Not just "good luck"—this is the celebration of merit. Each time you encounter the Dharma, virtue arises. Each time you practice, virtue increases. Each time you realize, virtue is perfected.

And finally, the Dharani of Dependent Origination in Sanskrit: Recognition is immediate.

The text points beyond itself pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The obstacle exists only for the one who believes in obstacles.

*Om ye dharma hetu prabhava hetun tesam tathagato hyavadat*
*tesam ca yo nirodha evam vadi mahasramanah* The very barrier is the gateway—gegs lam du khyer.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

No lid to lift—whole without beginning.

"Of all phenomena that arise from causes, the Tathagata has taught their cause, and their cessation too—thus speaks the Great Shramana."

This is the seal, the authentication. Everything that arose in this text arose from causes—the cause being Longchenpa's wisdom and compassion. And now it is complete. The work is done.

But for you? Now the real work begins. This isn't the end—it's the beginning. Take what you've learned and practice it. Turn knowledge into realization. Don't let this Treasury gather dust—let it transform your mind!

Sarva Mangalam. May all be auspicious.
