[1-359]
Definitive terminology: "kaya" because body is complete. In the Buddha-ground, though there is neither body nor entity, names alone do not contradict. From the Ratnagotravibhaga (Dkon mchog sgron me):

"The dharmakaya is the body of the Victors. By seeing, purifying views, one will know."

Just as it is said. Here's the key point: Dharmakaya isn't a physical body, yet it's called "body." Sambhogakaya has no marks, yet it appears with marks. Nirmanakaya has no fixation, yet it appears in various forms. These aren't contradictions—they're the play of emptiness and appearance (stong gzugs)!
