First, the essential nature: vast and expansive, the great identity of clarity, self-illuminating. It is called the "center." It is called the "expanse." The nature of Dharmata, the very substance of things, is vast and without limit.

Center and expanse—these are not two places. When you rest in the nature of mind, there is no inside and outside. The center is everywhere. The expanse is nowhere to be found because it is what is looking. This old man once searched for the center of his mind for years. Found nothing. The nothing was the center all along.

Divided, there is the outer expanse—space; the inner expanse—the lamp; the secret expanse—light and bindu; the unsurpassed expanse—the great display of self-liberated delusory appearance.

Garab Dorje's three: Direct recognition. Unwavering rest. Continual return. The outer expanse is space—vast, open, unlimited. The inner expanse is the lamp—the clear light that illuminates itself. The secret expanse is light and bindu—the essence of appearance and essence. The unsurpassed expanse is the display—everything appearing as self-liberated.

Moreover, in progressive order: Awareness, Wisdom, the Three Kayas—are the domain of Fruition. The characteristic: since it opens to the vast, has the capacity to appear, and pervades, it appears as the domain of clarity—like a mirror of clear depth.

This very awareness you have right now—look at it. Does it have a shape? A color? A location? The mirror reflects but is not the reflection. The clarity illuminates but is not the illuminated. The depth is bottomless because there is no bottom to find.

In brief, Dharmata is not a thing in itself; it is that which brings forth the power to clarify the domain through which Dharmata appears. The result: depending upon understanding without error the domain of Dharmata, seeing the essential nature of Dharmata itself, making the unchanging direct perception the Path—one awakens to Buddhahood.

You don't become a Buddha by adding something. You become a Buddha by removing the error. The error is thinking there is something to add. The domain of Dharmata is always appearing. The error is failing to recognize it. Seeing the essential nature—that is the path. No further journey required.

Through familiarity with such an expanse, external wondrous signs manifest as visionary experience. From the Blazing Reliquary: "One who becomes familiar with the expanse—their breath, inner and outer movement exhausted, goes like a bird through space, and like a fish through water; the one endowed with fortune proceeds thus. Together with lands and Mount Meru, and objects not seen before—from a single seat they behold them, and likewise the Buddha-fields—those not seen before—all these become visible at once. One possessing such signs and marks, from this point, in sixteen months, shall also behold the Dharmadhatu." Thus it is said.

Like a bird flying through space without hindrance, like a fish swimming through water without effort—the one who familiarizes with the expanse moves through appearances as through open sky. The body becomes light as cotton. The breath settles. From a single seat, all worlds appear. The thousand buddha-fields reveal themselves like reflections in a clear mirror.

The internal visionary signs are these: from the heart-mirror of Vajrasattva, these prior signs arise for that person. When sitting alone, experiencing bliss; the body light as a cotton leaf; no desire to be with others; feeling as if flying through space; the perception of joy when appearances cease; no attachment to body or life; mind not engaging with any appearance; awareness clear without sinking; cognition naturally relaxed; happiness when with others; afflictions unable to arise through any circumstance; even when afflictions arise, not grasping them as thoughts; no attachment arising to beautiful forms.

These signs are not achievements to boast about. They are natural expressions of familiarity. The body becomes light like a cotton leaf—not because you tried to become light, but because the weight of grasping was released. No desire to be with others—not because you became antisocial, but because the chatter of samsara lost its appeal. You fly through space in your seat. You see the joy when appearances cease. What need is there for the appearances when their cessation is joy?

Look directly: The signs arise naturally. Don't make them into achievements. Don't grasp them as special. They are the path recognizing itself. Continue without attachment. The fruit ripens in its own time.

[Final] The expanse is vast. The awareness is clear. The signs arise naturally. From sixteen months to seeing Dharmadhatu—the path is certain. The recognition is immediate. The fruit is complete.

Emaho! The great expanse! The self-illuminating clarity! The signs of one who familiarizes!

Self-liberation: the very act of grasping frees itself when recognized. Recognition in the interval—between this thought and the next. What was spoken here is the unspeakable nature. The words are offered; the recognition is yours. The treasury is complete.
