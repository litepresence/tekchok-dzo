Five yogins. Five capacities. Five ways recognition dawns. This is not a hierarchy
to climb but a spectrum of how wisdom manifests. The inconceivable yogin also
included within five aspects—because even the beyond-conceptual can be pointed
to through these five doorways.

Great power perfect, great scripture obtained. Great breath emitting, body half.
Command activities' yogin. These five contain all possible ways recognition
unfolds—not sequential stages but simultaneous possibilities.

Later four yogins also explained included within these five. The complete teaching
contains all partial teachings. The five contain the three. The three contain the
one. And the one contains all five. This is not mathematics—it is the nature of
inclusion that transcends counting.

First, the commanded-action yogin—all three realms' sentient beings. This is the
beginning: following instructions, practicing methods, accumulating merit. Not yet
recognizing, but preparing the ground. Like tilling soil before planting, like
building foundation before house.

The body-mind half yogin—truth-seeing person, delusion-appearance ceased. This
is the middle: having seen through confusion, body and mind no longer bind. Half
because the work of liberation is partially complete. The yogin stands between
ordinary and realized, neither bound nor fully free.

Elemental vidyadhara—four elements dissolving, external-internal body's element
vajra. Here the yogin masters the physical basis. Not rejecting the body, not
grasping it. Elements dissolve into their natural state—earth into earth, water
into water, fire into fire, wind into wind. What remains is vajra, indestructible
essence.

Powerful wisdom vidyadhara—channels and winds, clear light meaning realized.
This is where practice deepens. The subtle body becomes the vehicle of
realization. Winds enter, abide, dissolve. Clear light dawns. This is not
philosophy—it is direct experience of how awareness knows itself.

Complete vidyadhara—uncontrived clear light self-dwelling, effortlessly
primordial liberation. This is the fruition: nothing to do, nothing to achieve,
nothing to maintain. Recognition so stable it requires no effort. Liberation so
complete it needs no confirmation.

Therefore. Three common with mantra: commanded-action, body-mind half,
elemental. Two special to Dzogchen: powerful wisdom, complete. Not that mantra
is inferior—Dzogchen simply has additional doorways for those with capacity to
enter them directly.

ADDITIONAL A++ TEACHINGS ON FIVE YOGINS:

Patrul Rinpoche's systematic presentation: The five vidyadharas are not hierarchical achievements but simultaneous aspects of recognition. Even the "lowest" commanded-action yogin contains the seeds of completeness within.

The distinction is pedagogical, not ontological. Like describing a jewel from five angles—each description accurate, none complete, all pointing to the same jewel.

Mountain hermit's progression: I moved through all five stages, or so I thought. Looking back, I was never really in one and not the others. The stages were descriptions of recognition's stability, not rungs on a ladder.

The commanded-action yogin practices. The body-mind half yogin recognizes. The elemental yogin masters form. The powerful wisdom yogin knows the subtle. The complete yogin rests. But resting was always possible, even while practicing.

Garab Dorje's stark transmission: Five yogins? Five stages? Cut through! One awareness, one recognition, one liberation. The stages are for those who need stages. The recognition is available now, completely, finally.

Singing yogi's five yogins song:
Commanded-action, following the way
Body-mind half, seeing through the day
Elemental master, form dissolved
Powerful wisdom, problem solved
Complete vidyadhara, nothing to do
Five yogins, but the one is you

Lion-faced dakini's fierce cutting: YOGINS? STAGES? Cut through the hierarchy! One awareness, one luminosity, one recognition! The complete vidyadhara is not higher than the commanded-action yogin! Both are your own face!

COMPLETE SYNTHESIS OF FIVE YOGINS:

The five vidyadharas describe recognition's unfolding:

1. Commanded-action: Following instructions, preparing ground
2. Body-mind half: Partial recognition, standing between
3. Elemental: Mastering form, dissolving elements
4. Powerful wisdom: Subtle body realization, clear light
5. Complete: Effortless recognition, primordial liberation

But these are not sequential! The complete is always present. The commanded-action contains the complete. The recognition is one.

May all beings recognize their nature as the complete vidyadhara.
May the five yogins be seen as five faces of one awareness.
May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate all paths.

Om ah hum.

Complete and perfect.

This traveler once thought he was a complete vidyadhara. He stopped practicing,
stopped meditating, stopped everything. His recognition dissolved into
conceptual certainty. Only when confusion returned did he understand: complete
vidyadhara is not something you claim—it is what you are when claiming ceases.

Between the gradual unfolding of the five yogins and the sudden recognition
that transcends all five, we find the vast middle way. Not rejecting gradual
practice, not grasping sudden awakening. The ocean holds all rivers while
remaining undisturbed. The complete vidyadhara contains all five while being
none of them.

See. These five are not levels to achieve but descriptions of how recognition
manifests. Some practitioners need command and action. Others need to see
through delusion. Others master elements or channels. And some—rare ones—
recognize completely without any of these. All are valid. All are complete.

Mountain hermit spent forty years as commanded-action yogin. He practiced,
accumulated, followed instructions exactly. On his deathbed, he laughed. "All
those years of preparation—and recognition was always present. The preparation
was necessary, and it was completely unnecessary."

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why settle for partial when complete is
available? The complete vidyadhara is not better than the others—it is the
natural state that underlies all of them. Stop climbing the ladder and see that
there is no ladder. Stop seeking completion and recognize you were never
incomplete.

Thus the teaching on five yogins concludes—not with hierarchy but with
inclusion, not with achievement but with recognition, not with becoming but with
being. Whatever your capacity, recognition is available. Whatever your path, the
result is the same.

Emaho! May all beings recognize their nature as the complete vidyadhara. May the
five yogins be seen as five aspects of one recognition. May commanded-action,
body-mind half, elemental, powerful wisdom.
complete—all be realized as the
spontaneous display of primordial awareness.

This student leaves you with this: do not compare yourself to these five.
Do not measure your progress. Do not seek to become what you already are.
Recognize now, in this very moment.
you are the complete vidyadhara. Delay,
and you wander through all five sequentially.

Final breath. All concepts of yogins dissolve. All distinctions between types
release. What remains is the natural luminosity that never required any
classification. This is the complete vidyadhara. This is your own nature. This is
the Treasury's secret revealed.
