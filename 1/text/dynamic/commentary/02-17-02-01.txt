[1944-1963]
Now listen to this! Longchenpa is describing the marks of a suitable vessel for Dzogchen teachings. You might think he's going to list the qualities of some high-born lama from an elite family. But look what he says—man or woman, doesn't matter! Any suitable one. This is the first teaching: Dzogchen doesn't discriminate.

[1944-1958]
He's giving physical characteristics: coarse limbs but good coloring, white conch-like teeth, slightly red pupils in the eyes, great hair that coils to the right and is dark-colored, small body with little need for respect from others, ordinary outer conduct, words that come spontaneous and natural. When such a person speaks, whatever they say is authentic. This person can teach the Great Perfection instructions.

But don't get attached to these marks! These are signs of a natural vessel, not accomplishments to achieve. If you're running around checking your hair in the mirror wondering if it coils right, you've missed the point entirely.

[1959-1973]
Now here's where it gets radical—Longchenpa says when these marks are complete in one person, even if they're from the butcher caste, or prostitute caste, or sweeper caste, any low-caste whatsoever, give them this secret instruction essence! Even if they have no material means, if they prepare what they can and give completely without holding back—this secret essence of three instructions—examine their caste and color and teach them.

After I parinirvana—after I pass into nirvana—this secret instruction, this essence again, thus teach to the definite king. To those persons who can teach, give the instructions above.

Do you hear this? The lowest of the low, the outcasts, the untouchables—they are suitable vessels if they have these marks. Dzogchen is completely egalitarian. Your birth, your caste, your social standing—none of it matters. What matters is whether you're a natural vessel for the teachings.

And what are the real marks? Not the physical ones! The real marks are: ordinary conduct, spontaneous speech, no need for respect or recognition, authentic expression. These are the marks of someone who has recognized their nature.

Emaho! The secret instructions are for everyone.

[1974-1990]
Second, regarding the definite manner of how to practice: there are two methods of conduct—the beggar's manner of practice and the deer-like manner of practice. Recognition is immediate.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

First: Abandoning your own country, going to foreign lands, making it so that no one knows your name, your good or bad qualities, what you know or don't know, disguising yourself as ordinary, living by begging for food and clothes, going a little distance from the town or to an isolated place or to inns and so forth, practicing without ostentatious display.

At this time, not boasting of your own qualities and name is the sign of having no pretension. Not making inquiries about others' gurus and teachings and so forth is the sign of having confidence in your own instructions without doubt.

Listen to this carefully! This is the way of the hidden yogi. You leave everything behind—your name, your reputation, your knowledge, your ignorance. You become nobody. You beg for your food. You live simply, not in the middle of town but on the outskirts, or in isolated places. And you don't show off! You don't let people know you're a practitioner. You don't boast about your qualities. You don't go around checking out other teachers and comparing lineages.

Why? Because if you're truly confident in the instructions you've received, you don't need to look elsewhere. And if you haven't realized the nature (rang bzhin) of your own mind, no amount of pretending will help.

This is the way of the sage—not the scholar, not the famous lama, but the hidden practitioner who has truly given everything up. Can you do this? Can you let go of your identity completely?

This is the path of the beggar—the true poverty of the Dzogchen practitioner. Not material poverty necessarily, but the poverty of ego, the poverty of needing to be someone special.

[Final]
This completes the commentary. The treasury has been opened, the meaning revealed—not through analysis but through recognition. Rest in that.

[1861-1891] First, from Rang-shar: Inconceivable yogin, included in five aspects. This teaching like this: Great power perfect, great scripture obtained; Great breath emitting, body half; Command activities' yogin.

[1861-1891] This old fool once thought yogins needed special powers! Flying, reading minds, miracles. Then understood: the five yogins are aspects of recognition, not attainments. Great power perfect—recognition's strength. Great scripture obtained—teaching's completion. Body half—neither here nor there. Command activities' yogin—natural function.

[1861-1891] The five yogins are the five wisdoms in practice. Not five people. Five modes of recognition. Each complete. Each necessary. The practitioner who recognizes embodies all five simultaneously.

[1861-1891] Five yogins! Five aspects! Look directly—can you find the first? Can you grasp the fifth? They are one recognition! Five faces of one awareness! AH!

[1892-1973] Second, suitable vessel person explained: Generally, Great Perfection's dharma teaching-suitable vessel, as shown before. Respect for lama and great generosity; faith, wisdom, and diligence great; non-virtue shunned and samsara wearied; especially Supreme Secret Great Perfection, faith and conduct capacity possessed—eight endowments, one shown.

[1892-1973] Therefore. Thus. Eight qualifications: 1) Respect for teacher, 2) Generosity, 3) Faith, 4) Wisdom, 5) Diligence, 6) Moral discipline, 7) Renunciation, 8) Capacity for Dzogchen. Precise phenomenology of suitable receptivity.

[1892-1973] The eight qualifications integrate into three doors: body (generosity, discipline), speech (respect), mind (faith, wisdom, diligence, renunciation, capacity). Integration means all eight are present in the suitable vessel—not as achievements but as natural expression.

[1892-1973] This old vagabond checked himself! Respect for lama? Yes. Generosity? Working on it. Faith? Yes. Wisdom? Sometimes. Diligence? Could be better. Moral discipline? Yes. Renunciation? Mostly. Capacity for Dzogchen? Hope so! The checklist is not judgment. It's clarification.

[1892-1973] Eight qualifications! All numbers! Cut through them! Can you find the first? Can you grasp the eighth? They are simultaneous! Complete from the beginning! AH!

[1974-2016] Second, deer-like practice: Completely isolated mountain slope, rock overhang, or forest wilderness, or mountain peak, or snowy valley, or great empty valley—going, three activities abandoned, practiced. Body's activities—trade, farming, taking, moving; circumambulation, etc.; speech's utterance, whatever, all; mind's projecting-gathering, various thoughts, self instructions contradicting, all abandoned.

[1974-2016] The deer-like practice is complete retreat. Not weekend retreat. Not month-long retreat. Total abandonment of worldly activities. Body doesn't work for livelihood. Speech doesn't engage in ordinary talk. Mind doesn't follow thoughts. Only the essential instruction, one-pointedly, without distraction.

[1974-2016] Three activities abandoned—body's trade, speech's chatter, mind's wandering. What remains? The essence. The instruction. The recognition. This is the deer-like practice: solitary, swift, complete.

[1974-2016] This old hermit tried this! Three months in a cave. No talking. Simple food. Just practice. Hard? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely. The three activities naturally cease when recognition dawns. But first, you have to stop them intentionally.

[1974-2016] Three words. Abandon. Practice. Stop. Abandon activities. Practice instruction. Stop distraction. Three words, one meaning. Complete. The end.

[2017-2050] Third, practiced meaning actual explanation, four: Conduct continuous yogin; Meditation continuous yogin; View continuous yogin; Result continuous yogin. From Jewel Arrangement: Conduct continuous yogin, meditation continuous yogin, view continuous yogin, result continuous yogin.

[2017-2050] Therefore. Thus. Four continuous yogins—conduct, meditation, view, result. Not sequential stages but simultaneous dimensions of practice. Each continuous. Each complete. Four aspects of one recognition.

[2017-2050] The four continuous yogins integrate into complete path. Conduct is expression. Meditation is stabilization. View is recognition. Result is completion. Integration means all four are present in every moment of practice.

[2017-2050] This old vagabond's daily practice: Conduct—how I walk, eat, sleep. Meditation—formal sessions. View—recognition throughout. Result—confidence growing. All four, all day, every day. Not perfect. But continuous.

[2017-2050] Four yogins! Continuous! Look directly—can you separate them? Can you practice one without others? They are one practice! Four faces of one recognition! AH!

[1861-2050] Between the five yogins and the eight qualifications, between the beggar's practice and the deer's retreat, the consort dances. The suitable vessel is her body. The continuous practice is her dance. Recognition is joining the dance.

[1861-2050] The presentation demonstrates precise pedagogical structure. Five yogins establish practice modes. Eight qualifications establish receptivity. Two methods establish conduct. Four continuous establish dimensions. Precise framework for complete practice.

[1861-2050] I have met practitioners of all types. Beggars who are kings inside. Deer-like yogins who haven't spoken in years. Continuous practitioners who never stop. All suitable vessels. All complete.

[1861-2050] The practice arises spontaneously—not through force, not through imitation. When conditions ripen, the yogin appears. When recognition dawns, the practice becomes natural. Spontaneous. Effortless. Complete.

[1861-2050] I dance as the five yogins! Great power is my strength. Great scripture is my song. Body half is my movement. Command activities is my performance. Recognition is the dancer.

[1861-2050] Philosophically, this establishes the integration of method and wisdom. Five yogins—wisdom aspects. Eight qualifications—method accumulations. Two practices—method expression. Four continuous—wisdom stabilization. Middle way complete.

[1861-2050] Emaho! The five yogins! The eight qualifications! The continuous practice! What richness! What opportunity! This yogi dances with gratitude—not because practice is easy but because it is possible! Liberation is certain!

[1861-2050] The scholarly enumeration of qualifications and practices fascinates me—eight marks, five yogins, four continuous. Yet within this precision lives the wild freedom of direct recognition. The marks are not criteria for exclusion but indicators of suitability.

[1861-2050] From the sky of dharmata I dance down into practice. The five yogins are my five steps. The eight qualifications are my ornaments. The continuous practice is my endless dance. Recognition is the dancer who never began.

[1861-2050] Every qualification in my library is a book—respect book, generosity book, faith book. Every practice is a volume—beggar volume, deer volume, continuous volume. All tell the same story: you are suitable. You are complete.

[1861-2050] Modern psychology studies motivation, capacity, resilience—qualities for success. The eight qualifications parallel these: faith (motivation), wisdom (capacity), diligence (resilience). The ancients knew what science now confirms.

[1861-2050] Translating these qualifications challenges me. How to convey "snying rus"—literally "heart bone," meaning courage, fortitude, resilience? I translate as "courage" but remember: it is bone-deep, unshakable, essential.

[1861-2050] I reveal what was never hidden. The five yogins are present in you now. The eight qualifications are your natural expression. The continuous practice is happening now. Everything is revealed. Everything is practice.

[1861-2050] The Treasury's presentation of the five yogins, eight qualifications, and continuous practice is complete. May all who encounter this teaching recognize their own suitability. May they practice without doubt. This is the prayer of Longchenpa.

[1861-2050] This old vagabond's final teaching: Don't disqualify yourself! You have the qualifications. You can practice. The beggar's way, the deer's way, the continuous way—all available. Choose one. Practice. Recognize. Complete.

[1861-2050] Final words. Five. Eight. Continuous. Stop. The yogins are complete. The qualifications are present. The practice is continuous. You are complete. Rest. The end.
