Listen! From Great Arrangement Chapter Thirty-Two: "Whoever desires to divide the border—body's action self-reverse outward, now wherever engaged, afterward not thus. That itself reverse, body also not abiding, three realms body also not entering!"

This teaching concerns the bodily conduct that requires settling with necessity. The body—running and lying down, rising and moving the limbs, circumambulating and making prostrations, turning the limbs and bowing the head, whatever actions one remembers—dance and mudra transformations, whatever activities one engages in visualization: whoever performs these, through naturally cutting the body's attachment, completely splitting open the body's attachment, by this one becomes the transformative body.
