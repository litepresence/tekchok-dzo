[3870-3887]
First: At the time of all-pervasive emptiness, the path of everything rolling without relying—when distinguishing from the basis. Even the mere word of elaboration is not established. The elaboration of designation does not exist. In dharmatā beyond expression, there is no letter.

Through the reasoning of actionlessness, the analysis of cyclic existence is exhausted. The ultimate meaning of cessation.

Second: From the aspect of dharmatā abiding, transformation in mind does not occur. At the time of the three kāyas appearing on the path, whatever is not liberated does not exist. At the time of the result arising in the essential point, dharmatā is desired to be met without separation.

The essence of symbolic instruction: non-deluded, thought-free. Self-nature: cessation of thought-construction's grasping. Characteristic: non-dual, free from essence-grasping.

Two divisions: oral transmission abandoned in the extreme of dullness; oral transmission struck in the head, timeless.

This teaches that even "no elaboration" is elaboration. Even "beyond words" uses words. The path of actionlessness does not destroy cyclic existence—it sees through the very concept of a doer. When the three kāyas appear on the path, nothing remains to be liberated—because nothing was ever bound.

Immediate. Never gradual. See.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. THUNDER! Treasury blazes! Was never closed! Sudden recognition! NOW!

Secret ground: the path is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight never leaves the moon.

See the distinction. Who makes it? Empty.
