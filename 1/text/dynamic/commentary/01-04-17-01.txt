[3870-3876]
First: At the time of all-pervasive emptiness, the path of everything rolling, without relying—when distinguishing from the basis. Even the mere word of elaboration is not established. The elaboration of designation does not exist.

In dharmatā beyond expression, there is no letter—so it is said.

Through the reasoning of actionlessness, the analysis of cyclic existence is exhausted. The ultimate meaning of cessation.

[3871-3881]
All-pervasive emptiness—like space that pervades all, yet is not any thing. The path of everything rolling—phenomena appearing, functioning, yet without a ground to rely upon.

When distinguishing from the basis: even the word "elaboration" is not established. To say "no elaboration" is still elaboration. To say "beyond expression" uses expression.

Through actionlessness—not the actionlessness of not acting, but the actionlessness of no actor. Cyclic existence exhausted—not destroyed, but seen through.

Second: From the aspect of dharmatā abiding, transformation in mind does not occur. At the time of the three kāyas appearing on the path, whatever is not liberated does not exist. At the time of the result arising in the essential point, dharmatā is desired to be met without separation.

[3870-3881]
This yogi. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The Instruction Section cuts through all this. Even "no elaboration" is too much. Even "beyond words" uses words.

But the practitioner continues: through actionlessness, cyclic existence exhausted. Not by doing something, but by seeing there was never a doer.

The three kāyas appear on the path—yet nothing is not liberated. The result arises in the essential point—dharmatā met without separation. Not meeting something else, but recognizing what always was.

[3870-3876]
See what is. Rest in recognition. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Even the mere word of elaboration—not established. Designation does not exist. Dharmatā beyond expression: no letter.

Actionlessness. Cyclic existence exhausted. Cessation.

[3870-3881]
Recognition is immediate. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

All-pervasive emptiness! Path of everything rolling! Without relying! No elaboration! No designation! No letter!

Actionlessness! Cyclic existence exhausted! Liberation without separation!

[3882-3887]
SUDDEN. Symbolic instruction! The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The essence: non-deluded, thought-free. Self-nature: cessation of thought-construction's grasping. Characteristic: non-dual, free from essence-grasping.

Two divisions: oral transmission abandoned in the extreme of dullness; oral transmission struck in the head, timeless.

First: Through vital-point wind abiding in the channels, the mind's own diligence through instruction—from the very source of dharmatā, the activity of averting harm.

[3870-3870]
Through that spreading, the essential point of severing the debate between buddhas and sentient beings. This is the treasury's heart.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Through the wind vital-point descending into the body, the essential point of severing the connection between body and mind.

Through the root wind exhausted in the extreme, the essential point of arising's self-liberation.

[3870-3870]
The wind—rlung, the vital energy. The channels—rtsa, the pathways.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. This is the secret body, the inner yoga.

When wind abides in the channels, mind becomes workable. This is the instruction: not through thinking, but through direct experience.

Sever the debate between buddhas and sentient beings—there is no difference in nature. Sever the connection between body and mind—they were never truly connected. Arising's self-liberation—things appear, but liberate themselves.

[3870-3870]
Second: Through the vast expanse's aspect—never departing anywhere—the pervasion and estimation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Through essence-grasping being free in dharmadhātu's emptiness, the estimation of phenomena's transformation.

Through non-fabrication in the expanse, that-which-is-called self-arisen wisdom.

The essence of the self-arising tantra's instruction—all commands' source—is clear in the arising ground. The unique is cut by the axe of distinctive knowing.

[3870-3870]
This binding—look closely. Is anything truly holding?.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

All commands' source—clear in the arising ground!

Cut by the axe of distinctive knowing!

Through non-duality in self-nature: cessation of saṃsāra's reliance.
Through characteristic not established as words or letters: emptiness free from ground of dispute!

[3870-3870]
SUDDEN. Four commands! The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Commanded in the manner of view's thorough investigation.
Commanded in the manner of removing obscurations.
Commanded in the manner of bringing forth the hidden to manifestation.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.
Commanded in the manner of self-clarifying explanation.

Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground: action free from good and bad, the three realms' complete liberation!

[3870-3870]
The four commands—four ways the teacher brings the student to recognition. Not one way, but many, because students are various.

View's thorough investigation: for the analytical.
Removing obscurations: for the blocked.
Bringing forth the hidden: for those with capacity.
Self-clarifying explanation: for those ready.

All lead to the same place: self-arisen wisdom, beyond fabrication.
 What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.
