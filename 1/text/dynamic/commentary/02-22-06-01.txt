If you fear the displays, this is the demon of fear. These must be recognized as obstacles.

Samsara's confused paths IMMEDIATE! Why gradual? Liberation NOW! Not next life! THIS MOMENT! Rest in this understanding.

Secret instruction: the distinction-maker is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight dissolves the moon.

This teaching reveals the signs of the six realms at the time of death. The practitioner must understand these signs to know where they will be reborn. But more importantly, these signs are the displays of awareness itself. At the moment of death, when the winds withdraw and consciousness separates from the body, the mind's true nature becomes visible. The signs that appear are not random—they are the karmic imprints of a lifetime, manifesting as visions, sounds, and sensations.

The Tibetan masters spent lifetimes observing the dying. They noted the patterns: those who had accumulated heavy negative karma saw dark, threatening visions. Those who had cultivated virtue saw light, peaceful visions. These observations became the basis for understanding the bardo—the intermediate state between death and rebirth. The signs described in this text are not superstition—they are empirical observations, refined over centuries.

When displays arise but you do not recognize them as your own face, you wander in delusion. Like a deer chasing a mirage, you pursue empty forms. This is the pitfall of thod rgal practice. You must have the lama's introduction and your own recognition.

The signs of taking birth: these are the dreams of the mind, the habitual paths, the paths of karma's end, the uncertain illusion paths, the uncertain cause-result paths. The nature is complete.

From Oddiyana's sky: the path blazes as ground itself! Never departed!

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Know these well!

Hell-realm signs: at death, dark clouds gathering like smoke, rain, steam, great wind, hail, falling dust. These indicate the eight hot hells, eight cold hells, neighboring hells, sentient-being hell Avici, and vajra hell—seven destinations of intense suffering.

The Avatamsaka Sutra teaches: rejecting Dharma leads to Avici hell, lasting an entire kalpa, suffering immeasurable. Even when the great fire kalpa burns, you remain—such is the result of abandoning the holy Dharma!

For tantric practitioners, violating vajra guru samaya leads to Vajra Hell—lasting until the ocean is emptied by hair-strands, kalpas as numerous as ocean drops. Do not take samaya lightly!

Emaho!

The eight hot hells: the首要 hell where beings experience continuous burning. The second hell where the heat is even more intense. The third, fourth, fifth, sixth—each increasing in suffering. The seventh is the Avici hell, the uninterrupted hell, where beings suffer continuously without a moment's relief. The eight cold hells: from the just cold to the most severe freezing. The neighboring hells surround the hot hells—scorching sands, freezing winds. The vajra hell is for those who break the deepest samayas.

Some practitioners see lights and think they have attained enlightenment. They stop practicing, filled with pride. This is a great error. The displays are merely the path, not the result. Do not be satisfied with mere experiences!

The texts describe specific signs: those heading to hell realms see dark clouds, rain, mist, great winds, hail, dust whirlwinds. The sky appears as if darkness is spreading. These are not metaphors—they are actual visions experienced by the dying. The mind, no longer constrained by the body, manifests its deepest karmic imprints. The Tibetans understood this intimately: the dying person's face changes, their breathing changes, their body temperature shifts in specific patterns that indicate the realm of their next birth.

Hungry ghost signs: at death, unclear sky with fading light like western sunset, dead sun and moon, yellow clouds covering them, rain falling with subsequent cold, evening rain. These indicate external, internal, sudden, distinctive, inverted, karmic, and enjoyment-obscured preta realms.

The hungry ghosts appear with huge bellies and tiny throats, unable to eat. They wander endlessly seeking nourishment but finding nothing. Some have only the names of food; others see food but cannot reach it; others are tormented by guardians. The signs at death include: the sky becomes unclear, rays fade like the setting sun, sun and moon seem to die, yellow clouds obscure everything, cold rain falls. These indicate the various types of pretas: those with external obscuration, inner obscuration, sudden obscuration, distinctive obscuration, inverted obscuration, karmic obscuration, and obscuration of enjoyment.

Animal-realm signs: at death-transfer, dark and hazy sky without warmth, covered by dark clouds, valley blue with smoke appearance, hazy unpleasant sky. This leads to animals with many legs, no legs, four legs, winged, scaled—countless varieties.

Animals suffer from their own ignorance. They cannot understand dharma, cannot reflect on their situation. The signs: the sky appears gloomy, warm but without comfort, black clouds gather, fog obscures the view. The consciousness, confused and darkened, takes birth in the animal realm—in creatures with many legs, no legs, four legs, wings, claws. The variety is endless.

Asura-realm signs: fierce wind rising from all directions, terrifying dark red cloud-forms appearing, clouds swirling violently with thunder roaring and lightning flashing, sun and moon obscured. Five asura types: five-cornered, six-faced, long-armed, big-bellied, sky-going with matted hair.

The asuras are the fighting demons, always at war with the gods. They are driven by jealousy and aggression. The signs at death include: fierce winds, terrifying clouds like monsters, thunder, lightning, the sun and moon obscured. These indicate rebirth as one of the five types of asuras: those with five projections, six faces, long arms, great bellies, or long hair floating in the sky.

God-realm signs: at breath-separation, clear pure sky with bright sun and moon, no wind or dust, directions beautiful and joyful. This leads to six desire-god families, five pure abode gods, fifteen clear light birth-places, four limitless perception entrances.

The gods experience great pleasure but are still trapped in samsara. They have vast palaces, beautiful retinues, but when their lifespan ends, they fall from their heights. The signs: clear sky, bright sun and moon, no wind, beautiful directions, great joy. These indicate rebirth among the six desire realm gods: the four great kings, the thirty-three gods, the yama gods, the tusita gods, the nirmana rata gods, or the paranirmita vasavarti gods. The pure abodes are for those who have attained certain concentrations. The formless realms are for those who have attained the formless absorptions.

Human-realm signs: clear sky without dust, gentle white clouds stretching like silk, sun and moon with rainbow light surrounding—indicating precious human birth in the three higher realms.

Human birth is precious because it offers the opportunity for liberation. The signs: very clear and pure sky, soft white clouds like stretched silk, sun and moon surrounded by rainbow light. This indicates rebirth as a human—either an ordinary human or a precious human birth, one of the three higher realms.

In thod rgal practice, conduct is essential. Do not fall into the extreme of formal discipline, nor into the extreme of recklessness. Like a madman, be free from convention, yet like a wise one, be free from harm.

Between preparation and ripeness, recognition is immediate. Spacious knowing without stages.

Eat what comes to you, wear what is given, sleep wherever you are. Do not be attached to comfort or averse to hardship.

The wise practitioner rests in the nature (rang bzhin) of whatever arises, without accepting or rejecting. Good experiences, bad experiences—all are equally the display of rigpa. This is the supreme conduct.

Others become frightened when they see the empty forms or hear sounds. They run away from the practice, thinking they have gone mad. This too is delusion. These displays are your own mind—there is nothing to fear.

Some cling to the blissful experiences, wanting them to continue forever. When they fade, they become depressed. This is attachment to samsara, even within the path of liberation. All experiences are impermanent—even the bliss of meditation.

The specific exceptions: bad signs—wind, hail, etc.—may be sent by non-human wrathful ones or appear when evil beings die. Good signs—rainbow light and clear sky—may also be possible for excellent persons transferring to Buddha fields, achieving samadhi, life-transference, and so forth.

The signs are not absolute. One must consider the practitioner's mindset. If a good person dies with good signs, they may indeed go to a pure realm. But if the signs are contrary to the person's mental state, the signs may indicate something else. The text warns against simplistic interpretation.

the cliff caves above Samye hermit... has observed many deaths. I have seen the signs manifest. I have seen the peaceful ones pass with smiles on their faces, their bodies remaining warm for hours. I have seen the fearful ones struggle, their faces twisted, their bodies cold. I have seen the confused ones wander in the bardo, unable to find their way. The signs are real. The realms are real. The suffering is real.

But I have also seen: the nature of all these realms is awareness. The hell beings experience suffering, but their nature is Buddha-nature. The gods experience pleasure, but their nature is equally empty. The humans experience both, but their nature transcends both. The recognition of this nature is liberation—not the elimination of experiences, but the understanding that experiences are appearances in awareness.

Thus, the practitioner does not seek to avoid the signs or cling to them. They rest in the recognition of whatever arises. The signs come and go—like clouds in the sky. The sky remains. That sky is your own mind. Recognize it, and the signs become the path. They are no longer obstacles but doorways to understanding.

No process needed. No gradual opening. Immediate access to what was always present.

Now I will speak further on the nature of these signs. The signs at the time of death are not merely omens—they are the direct display of the mind. When the body weakens, the mind's grip loosens. The karmic imprints, long hidden, rise to the surface. The dying person experiences these as visions, sounds, sensations. The trained practitioner recognizes them as such. The untrained person is carried away by them.

The bardo teachings are vast. The six realms appear in the bardo: the hell realms with their fires and icy cold, the hungry ghost realms with their starvation and thirst, the animal realms with their darkness and confusion, the asura realms with their warfare, the god realms with their pleasures, the human realm with its variety. Each appears according to the karma of the individual. The texts describe the specific signs for each: the colors, the sounds, the sensations, the duration.

The practitioner who understands this does not wait for death to recognize the signs. Every moment, awareness displays itself. Every appearance is a sign. The clouds in the sky, the sounds in the air, the sensations in the body—all are manifestations of mind. When recognized, these displays are the path. When not recognized, these displays become samsara. The moment of recognition is the moment of liberation—not in some future death, but now, in this very moment.

The conduct for the practitioner: do not be attached to good experiences, do not be averse to bad experiences. Both are displays of awareness. Both arise from the ground of being. Rest in that ground. Let the displays come and go like waves on the ocean. You are the ocean, not the waves.

Some cling to blissful experiences, wanting them to continue. When they fade, they suffer. This is attachment. Some fear painful experiences, trying to avoid them. When they arise, they panic. This is aversion. Both bind you to samsara. The wise practitioner rests in the middle: neither grasping nor rejecting. This is the supreme conduct.

The signs at death are determined by the accumulation of a lifetime. If you have cultivated virtue, the signs will be peaceful. If you have accumulated negative karma, the signs will be terrifying. But even these signs are not final. The bardo offers opportunities for liberation. The teachings describe how even in the bardo, one can recognize the nature of mind and achieve enlightenment. This is the purpose of the bardo teachings: not to frighten, but to offer hope.

The exceptions: sometimes bad signs appear even for good practitioners, sent by wrathful beings to test their resolve. Sometimes good signs appear for bad practitioners, to mislead them. The wise practitioner does not judge by signs alone but considers the whole picture: the person's mental state, their practice, their intentions.

TIn a freezing cave...has observed many deaths. I have seen the signs manifest. I have seen peaceful practitioners pass with smiles, their bodies remaining warm for hours. I have seen fearful ones struggle, their faces twisted. I have seen the confused wander in the bardo, unable to find their way. The signs are real. The realms are real. The suffering is real.

But I have also seen: the nature of all these realms is awareness. Hell beings experience suffering, but their nature is Buddha-nature. Gods experience pleasure, but their nature is equally empty. Humans experience both, but their nature transcends both. The recognition of this nature is liberation—not the elimination of experiences, but the understanding that experiences are appearances in awareness.

Thus, the practitioner does not seek to avoid signs or cling to them. They rest in recognition of whatever arises. The signs come and go—like clouds in the sky. The sky remains. That sky is your own mind. Recognize it, and signs become the path—not obstacles but doorways to understanding.
