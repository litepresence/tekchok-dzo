[1-12]
The elaborated empowerment with elaboration as ground unfolds like a lotus with countless petals. External, internal, secret, fully complete—four aspects that encompass the entire path. The tooth-stick distribution, the maṇḍala offering, the protection cord and kuśa grass, the dream examination—these are not mere rituals but doorways to recognition. Each prepares the practitioner for what is to come, like a traveler packing for a journey that ends where it began.

—

[2-503]
This entire section unfolds like a cosmic architecture—the empowerments as foundations, the grounds as stories, the four results as the palace's completion, the ultimate fruition as its infinite ornamentation. Yet this palace is not built; it is recognized. The practitioner who engages with these teachings sincerely discovers that the palace was always their own mind, the architecture was always the nature of reality.

—

[13-17]
The external preparation: distributing tooth-sticks. A simple act, yet it establishes the pattern of giving and receiving that will permeate the entire path. The practitioner learns to accept what is offered, to use what is given, to transform the ordinary into the sacred. This is the first step on a journey of a thousand miles that leads nowhere.

—

[18-28]
The unelaborated external: washing, supplication, the three vajra callings. Water cleanses what was never stained. The supplication reaches toward what is already present. The callings summon what was never absent. This is the paradox of the path: we practice to discover there is nothing to practice.

—

[29-32]
The internal aspect: samaya oath-water. Four oaths that bind by freeing. Abandoning saṃsāra—yet saṃsāra was never real. Accepting nirvāṇa—yet nirvāṇa was always present. Not benefiting sentient beings—because in truth there are no beings to benefit, only recognition to share.

—

[33-39]
The secret aspect deepens: samaya, vows, entering the maṇḍala, offering the mind-flower. The commitment that cannot be broken because it was never made. The vow that cannot be violated because there is no one to violate it. The maṇḍala that is entered yet never left. The flower offered that was never possessed.

—

[40-53]
The fully complete reveals the deity's face—your own face, reflected in the mirror of recognition. Throwing the flower to discover where it lands is where you already are. The name empowerment: receiving a name that Reflection appears, changes, vanishes. What reflects? namelessness. The śrāvaka's path: ground and path revealed, covers bestowed, bowl and fan given—the supports for a journey of simplicity.

—

[54-62]
The bodhisattva's entry expands: generating bodhicitta, holding vows, the distinctive mind. Compassion not as emotion but as the natural radiance of emptiness. The Kriyā entry: nine aspects that multiply to twenty-seven with Upāya and Yoga. Each vehicle adding its own flavor to the same recognition.

—

[63-75]
The secret Mahā: twelve empowerments that overwhelm with their generosity. Prophecy, entry, revelation, flower-throwing, name, hearing, explaining, benefiting, power, vidyā, limb, distinctive. Each one a complete path, each one sufficient, yet all given together like a king bestowing his entire treasury.

—

[63-503]
This completes the presentation of empowerments and grounds. May all who encounter these teachings recognize that the empowerment is already conferred, the ground is already reached, the recognition is already present. May the elaborate serve until it is seen through; may the simple be embraced when the time is ripe. May all beings recognize their own nature, perfect from the beginning, spontaneously present, naturally liberated.

—

[76-86]
Anu's six: entering, signs shown, breath emitted, mudrā transformed, action made, engagement certain. The precision of Anu yoga, where every gesture carries meaning, every breath is empowerment, every moment is the maṇḍala. Then Atiyoga's four: entering Great Perfection, flower-throwing in meditation, deity revealed, empowerment of effortless result. The culmination where methods dissolve into recognition.

—

[87-109]
The elaborate's extremely unelaborated: sixty-four methods that simplify to direct recognition. The mudrā maṇḍala's six external aspects—examining, summoning, seeking, requesting, bliss-seeking, expanding. The six internal: equipoise, bodhicitta with syllables, mirror-taking, vajra, lotus, wheel on the tongue. The six secret: bliss, actual bodhicitta, threefold secrecy. All indicated through words: signs, meanings, their non-duality.

—

[110-123]
The mathematics of liberation: six, nine, thirteen, seventeen, twenty-one—the numbers multiply yet the recognition remains one. Like ripples expanding in a pond, each circle larger yet all made of the same water. The elaborate path serves those who need elaboration; the unelaborated serves those ready for simplicity.

—

[124-134]
Listen to the counting: śrāvaka six, pratyekabuddha eleven, bodhisattva fifteen, Kriyā twenty-four, Upāya thirty-three, Yoga forty-two, Mahā fifty-four, Anu sixty, Ati sixty-four. Each number represents not superiority but appropriateness—the right medicine for the right illness. Ati's sixty-four appears smallest in method yet largest in recognition.

—

[135-146]
The without-elaboration's elaboration: outer, inner, secret, complete—fifteen methods that strip away until nothing remains but recognition. The very-without-elaboration adds thirty-six more, then the completely-without's twenty-eight. These aren't additions but subtractions—each layer removing obscuration until the naked recognition stands revealed.

—

[147-155]
The secret mandala's three aspects: awareness into expanse, expanse-awareness through deity, Buddha's heir through name. Outer prophecy through sense-faculties and objects—non-dual knowledge experienced. Inner through mind-clarity—empowerment free from birth. Secret through non-division—expanse-awareness's great bliss. Twelve total, yet all are one.

—

[156-175]
The very-without-elaboration unfolds: suitable entry and attainment, certain conduct and view, race distinction and self-abiding, cause and condition—eight aspects. The completely-without mirrors this structure: mind and speech abiding, speech transformed and mind attained, bliss prophesied and secret released, dwelling in manifestation and own action—eight more. Twenty-eight total in this category alone.

—

[1]
Through all these empowerments—sixty-four in the elaborate system—the result is attained. Yet the result was never unattained. All these numbers are The name 'mountain'—the word is not the peak.; don't count them, follow where they point. Your own nature, already perfect, never stained, spontaneously present. This is the great secret that all empowerments bestow.

—

[176-190]
The great yoga's stages: four grounds that are not sequential but simultaneous. Very yoga ground, self-ground certain, elaboration yoga ground, action-free complete. From certainty in one's nature through the play of elaboration to freedom from doing. These are not achievements but recognitions—different ways of seeing what was always present.

—

[191-200]
The discriminating yoga ground: sign, meaning, their non-duality, unmixed—four aspects of precision. The realizing yoga ground: miraculous emanation, distinction-realization, manifest arising, heroic race-distinction—four aspects of power. Sixteen grounds total when combined, yet they are facets of a single jewel, views from different angles of the same recognition.

—

[201-210]
On the first ground, seven miraculous powers: emanating bodies, multiplying limbs and heads, countless manifestations. These are not supernatural achievements but the natural display of awareness's unlimited capacity. The body that seems solid reveals its empty nature; the one that seems limited reveals its boundless potential. Don't chase these powers—let them arise naturally as byproducts of recognition.

—

[211-217]
The second ground: opening one's belly, showing entrails and heart. Another power that demonstrates the illusory nature of form. What seems solid is empty; what seems separate is one. These miracles are not for display but for teaching—the teacher's body becomes the teaching, demonstrating directly that all form is the play of awareness.

—

[218-228]
The sixteen grounds are not rungs on a ladder but waves on the ocean—each distinct yet all water. The practitioner who thinks "I have reached the first ground" misses the point. The grounds reveal themselves when recognition stabilizes, not when achievement is claimed.

—

[229-238]
Voice of experience: On the first ground, I thought there would be sixteen. On the sixteenth, I realized there was only ever one. The middle grounds taught me that counting is optional. The ground is not a place but a way of seeing.

—

[239-248]
The elaborate system of empowerments and grounds serves those who need structure. The unelaborated serves those ready for directness. Both arrive at the same recognition because there is only one nature of mind. The path accommodates all, excludes none, fulfills each according to their capacity.

—

[244-503]
The elaborate enumeration of empowerments serves those who need structure. Each number—six, nine, twelve, sixteen, sixty-four—represents a doorway. Some practitioners enter through the gate of six; others need the complexity of sixty-four. All gates lead to the same palace; all empowerments confer the same recognition. The diversity is compassion, ensuring no one is excluded.

—

[249-258]
The numbers—sixty-four empowerments, sixteen grounds, four aspects each—are skillful means. They give the mind something to do while recognition dawns. Like a mother counting sheep to help her child sleep—the counting is not the point; the rest is.

—

[259-268]
The ultimate empowerment is not conferred by another but recognized within. The ultimate ground is not reached but revealed. All the elaborate preparations lead to this simple recognition: you are already what you seek. This is the great secret, the profound treasure, the liberation that was never bound.

—

[262-503]
The winds, the grounds, the results, the fruition—all descriptions of how recognition manifests, how stabilization deepens, how benefit flows. Don't mistake the description for the described, the map for the territory, the fingers for the moon. Use the teachings as they are meant to be used: as supports for recognition, not as objects of obsession.

—

[269-280]
The structure of empowerment unfolds like a palace with many chambers. The practitioner enters through the outer gate, progresses through inner sanctums, reaches secret chambers, and finally arrives at the completely complete—the center that is everywhere. Each chamber contains the whole palace; each empowerment contains the complete path.

—

[281-284]
The tooth-stick distribution: an outer ritual that establishes the pattern of generosity. In ancient India, the tooth-stick was a simple gift, a sign of hospitality, a beginning of relationship. In the maṇḍala, it becomes the first empowerment—the recognition that all giving is self-giving, all receiving is self-receiving. The practitioner learns to give what cannot be lost and receive what was never separate.

—

[285-295]
The washing ritual: water as purification, water as blessing, water as the element that flows yet remains pure. The supplication: reaching toward what is already present, like a child reaching for the moon in water. The three vajra callings: summoning the deity who is one's own nature, calling the guru who is one's own heart, invoking the protection that was never absent.

—

[296-306]
The samaya oath-water: drinking the commitment that binds by freeing. Four oaths that seem paradoxical—abandoning saṃsāra that was never real, accepting nirvāṇa that was always present, refusing to benefit beings who have no separate existence. These oaths are not moral constraints but descriptions of recognition. To recognize is to abandon, accept, and refuse in ways that transcend ordinary understanding.

—

[307-320]
Entering the maṇḍala: stepping into the diagram that is one's own mind. Throwing the flower: offering what one is to discover where one lands. The name empowerment: receiving a designation that points beyond designation. The śrāvaka's simple path: ground and path as distinct, covers for protection, bowl and fan for sustenance and cooling. These supports serve until they are recognized as the path itself.

—

[321-342]
The bodhisattva expands the view: not personal liberation but universal awakening. Generating bodhicitta—the mind that turns toward enlightenment for all. Holding vows that cannot be held because there is no holder. The distinctive mind that distinguishes without discriminating. Then Kriyā's nine, Upāya's nine, Yoga's nine—twenty-seven methods for three approaches, all leading to the same gate.

—

[343-353]
The secret Mahā's twelve: prophecy that predicts what is already known, entry into what was never left, revelation of what was never hidden, flower-throwing into the center of oneself, naming what cannot be named, hearing what makes no sound, explaining the inexplicable, benefiting through non-doing, power that is powerlessness, vidyā as self-recognition, limbs of the body as limbs of awakening, distinctive marks of the unmistaken.

—

[354-364]
Anu's six: entering with precision, signs shown definitively, breath as the vehicle of wisdom, mudrā transformed into meaning, action that is non-action, engagement that is always already complete. Then Atiyoga's four—the culmination where methods become recognition: entering Great Perfection by recognizing one never left, throwing flowers into the maṇḍala of one's own mind, revealing the deity as oneself, empowerment as the effortless completion of what was always complete.

—

[365-387]
The elaborate's extremely unelaborated: sixty-four methods that dance between complexity and simplicity. The mudrā maṇḍala's external six—examining the consort who is one's own awareness, summoning what was never absent, seeking what was never lost, requesting what is always given, seeking bliss that is one's own nature, expanding into the limitless. The internal six—equipoise as natural state, bodhicitta resonating with syllables, mirror reflecting what is, vajra as indestructible nature, lotus as pristine awareness, wheel on the tongue as the turning of the teaching.

—

[388-410]
The secret six: bliss as the nature of experience, bodhicitta as actual rather than imagined, blessing in body speech and mind that recognizes their non-duality, secret that cannot be told, worthy of secrecy because it is beyond worth, focused on secrecy as the recognition of what cannot be objectified. All indicated through words that fail to capture what they indicate—signs, meanings, their inseparability.

—

[411-424]
The mathematics of the path: six plus nine plus four plus two equals the elaborate's twenty-one. Thirteen in the unelaborated's with-elaboration. Seventeen in its without-elaboration. The numbers accumulate like waves, each one carrying the practitioner closer to shore, yet the shore was never distant. The elaborate serves those who need steps; the unelaborated serves those ready to leap.

—

[425-435]
The grand enumeration: śrāvaka's six for individual liberation, pratyekabuddha's eleven for solitary realization, bodhisattva's fifteen for universal compassion. Then the tantric vehicles multiply: Kriyā's twenty-four, Upāya's thirty-three, Yoga's forty-two, Mahā's fifty-four, Anu's sixty, Ati's sixty-four. Each number is appropriate, each serves its purpose, each leads to the same recognition.

—

[436-447]
The without-elaboration unfolds its own structure: with-elaboration's fifteen methods that paradoxically use elaboration to transcend elaboration. The very-without-elaboration's thirty-six that approach directly. The completely-without's twenty-eight that rest in what is. These numbers are not hierachical—each is complete, each serves different capacities, each fulfills the practitioner who engages sincerely.

—

[436-503]
The four activities—pacifying obstacles, increasing virtues, empowering capabilities, wrathfully subduing—flow naturally from recognition. The realized practitioner does not choose; circumstances determine the appropriate response. This is spontaneous activity, the play of compassion, the natural expression of wisdom.

—

[438-503]
The sixteen grounds with their hundred miracles are displays of recognition. The first ground's emanations show multiplicity in unity. The second ground's body-opening shows emptiness of form. The third through sixteenth show increasingly subtle powers—controlling elements, transforming appearances, manifesting realms. All are natural expressions, not supernatural achievements.

—

[448-456]
The secret mandala's teaching: introducing awareness into expanse—the vidyā into dharmadhātu. Pointing out expanse-awareness through deity recognition—dharmadhātu and vidyā as non-dual. Making Buddha's heir through name empowerment—the transmission that cannot be transmitted, the inheritance that was always possessed. Outer prophecy through sense-faculties and objects—experiencing their non-duality as knowledge and sphere.

—

[451-503]
The bodhisattva's entry expands compassion to include all beings. Generating bodhicitta—the mind that turns toward awakening for all. Holding vows that cannot be held because there is no holder. Then the tantric multiplication: Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga—twenty-seven methods for three approaches, all leading to the same gate of recognition.

—

[457-465]
Inner prophecy through mind-clarity—recognizing birthlessness as empowerment. Secret prophecy through non-division—encouragement that reveals expanse-awareness's great bliss was never separate from any experience. Twelve aspects, yet each contains the twelve, and the twelve are one, and one is empty, and emptiness is luminous.

—

[460-503]
The four results emerge: temporary qualities supporting the path, ultimate fruition completing it. Elaborated empowers accumulation, unelaborated empowers preparation, very unelaborated empowers seeing, extremely unelaborated empowers meditation. These are not stages but aspects, not achievements but recognitions of what is always present.

—

[466-485]
The very-without-elaboration's eight: suitable entry for those ready, suitable attainment for those ripened, certain conduct as natural flow, certain view as direct seeing, race distinction as recognition of lineage, self-abiding as resting in nature, cause and condition as the dependent arising of recognition. Each pair completes a circuit; each circuit illuminates the whole.

—

[466-503]
The fully complete empowerment reveals the deity's face—your face, reflected. Throwing the flower to discover where it lands—where you are. The name empowerment—receiving a designation that points beyond designation. The śrāvaka's path—ground and path as distinct, the supports for a journey of renunciation and simplicity.

—

[467-503]
The dream examination concludes the elaborate external empowerment. Dreams are the mind's display, unfiltered by waking constraints. Examining them reveals patterns, shows progress, indicates obstacles. Yet don't become obsessed with dreams—the waking state is also dream, and the recognition that frees applies to both equally.

—

[468-503]
The second through sixteenth grounds each reveal seven powers: opening the body, emitting fire and water, cutting and scattering, transforming elements, controlling space, fire, water, wind. These are demonstrations, teachings in form, showing that all phenomena are the play of awareness. The practitioner who seeks these powers misses the point; the one who recognizes lets them arise naturally.

—

[470-503]
The secret Mahā's twelve overwhelm with generosity. Prophecy predicting what is known, entry into what was never left, revelation of what was never hidden. The Anu's six—precision in every gesture, meaning in every breath. Then Atiyoga's four—the culmination where methods become recognition, elaborate becomes simple, path becomes ground.

—

[472-503]
Ultimate fruition: Vajradhara's ground, complete qualities of inexhaustible body, speech, mind. Four signs, four measures, twelve, sixteen, twenty, twenty-four, twenty-eight, thirty-two—the numbers accumulate like light rays emanating from a central sun. Five-colored wisdom light arising as five Buddha maṇḍalas, spontaneously accomplished.

—

[474-503]
On the first ground, seven miracles: emanation of bodies, multiplication of limbs, countless heads and forms. These are not supernatural achievements but the natural display of awareness's unlimited capacity. The form that seemed solid reveals its empty, luminous nature. Don't chase these displays; let them arise as signs of recognition, not goals to achieve.

—

[475-503]
The samaya oath-water binds through freeing. Four oaths that seem contradictory—abandoning what was never real, accepting what was always present, refusing to benefit beings who have no separate existence. These are not moral commands but descriptions of how recognition functions. To recognize is to be bound by freedom, freed by commitment.

—

[478-503]
The maṇḍala offering that follows is the universe itself placed at the guru's feet. Not as abasement but as recognition—the guru is one's own awakened nature, the offering is one's own world, the offering is the nature of offering. The practitioner learns to give without grasping, to offer without expecting, to participate in the endless circulation of blessing.

—

[479-503]
Temporary qualities emerge: body long-lived and free from illness, speech turning the dharma wheel, mind pure in samādhi, clairvoyance and miracle. These are byproducts, not goals. The practitioner who seeks them creates obstacles; the one who recognizes lets them arise as natural expressions.

—

[480-503]
The four vidyādhara grounds: yoga, mahāyoga, saṃdarbhayoga, realization yoga. Each divided into controlled and uncontrolled, then subdivided into four. Sixteen grounds total, each with its own qualities, its own powers, its own recognition. This is the fruition of the path, the result that was never separate from the ground.

—

[481-503]
The unelaborated empowerments strip away ceremony to reveal essence. Washing—not ritual purification but recognition of primordial purity. Supplication—not begging but aligning with what is already present. The three vajra callings—summoning the deity who is oneself, the guru who is one's heart, the protection that never left.

—

[484-503]
The completely-without mirrors this: mind abiding as unmoving awareness, speech abiding as unceasing expression, speech transformed into mantra, mind attained as recognition, bliss prophesied as the natural result, secret released as the impossible disclosure, dwelling in manifestation as the nirmanakāya, own action attained as spontaneous benefit. Eight more, making the category's total, completing the structure.

—

[1]
Through all empowerments—whether counted as sixty-four or as one—the result is attained. This is the supreme generosity of the teaching: to offer countless methods, knowing that methods are only Calling it 'awareness'—the label is not what is labeled.. The result is not achieved but recognized; not attained but revealed. Your own nature, perfect from the beginning, unstained through all confusion, spontaneously liberated. This is the empowerment that all empowerments confer.

—

[488-503]
The tooth-stick distribution seems trivial—a small stick for cleaning teeth. Yet in this gesture, the entire path is contained. The guru gives; the disciple receives. This establishes the relationship of transmission, the flow of blessing from heart to heart. What is given is not the stick but the recognition that all giving is self-giving, all receiving is self-receiving.

—

[489-503]
The great yoga's four grounds: the very yoga ground where practice begins, the self-ground certain where confidence arises, the elaboration yoga ground where methods multiply, the action-free complete where doing dissolves into being. These are not stages to climb but aspects to recognize—simultaneous, non-sequential, always present.

—

[493-503]
The four appearances' qualities: elaborated shows dharmatā directly, unelaborated improves experience, very unelaborated brings awareness to measure, extremely unelaborated exhausts dharmatā. Each connects to Buddha ground, each dissolves the contaminated, each reveals the uncontaminated nature.

—

[494-503]
The discriminating yoga ground's four: sign ground where appearances are recognized, meaning ground where their significance is seen, sign-meaning non-dual ground where appearance and emptiness unite, unmixed ground where all is distinct yet inseparable. The realizing yoga ground's four: miraculous emanation as natural display, distinction-realization as precise knowing, manifest arising as unobstructed expression, heroic race-distinction as confidence in lineage.

—

[497-503]
The second ground: opening the belly, showing entrails and heart-lungs. A teaching in flesh, a demonstration in blood. What seems most solid—organs, flesh, bone—revealed as display, as teachable, as empty. The teacher's body becomes the text; the student sees directly that all form is the play of awareness. Don't mistake this for morbidity—it is the ultimate generosity, using what seems most private to teach what is most universal.

—
