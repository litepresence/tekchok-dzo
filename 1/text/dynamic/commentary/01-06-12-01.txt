The elaborated empowerment with elaboration as ground unfolds like a lotus with countless petals. External, internal, secret, fully complete—four aspects that encompass the entire path. The tooth-stick distribution, the maṇḍala offering, the protection cord and kuśa grass, the dream examination—these are not mere rituals but doorways to recognition. Each prepares the practitioner for what is to come, like a traveler packing for a journey that ends where it began.

—

The external preparation: distributing tooth-sticks. A simple act, yet it establishes the pattern of giving and receiving that will permeate the entire path. The practitioner learns to accept what is offered, to use what is given, to transform the ordinary into the sacred. This is the first step on a journey of a thousand miles that leads nowhere.

—

The unelaborated external: washing, supplication, the three vajra callings. Water cleanses what was never stained. The supplication reaches toward what is already present. The callings summon what was never absent. This is the paradox of the path: we practice to discover there is nothing to practice.

—

The internal aspect: samaya oath-water. Four oaths that bind by freeing. Abandoning saṃsāra—yet saṃsāra was never real. Accepting nirvāṇa—yet nirvāṇa was always present. Not benefiting sentient beings—because in truth there are no beings to benefit, only recognition to share.

—

The secret aspect deepens: samaya, vows, entering the maṇḍala, offering the mind-flower. The commitment that cannot be broken because it was never made. The vow that cannot be violated because there is no one to violate it. The maṇḍala that is entered yet never left. The flower offered that was never possessed.

—

The fully complete reveals the deity's face—your own face, reflected in the mirror of recognition. Throwing the flower to discover where it lands is where you already are. The name empowerment: receiving a name that points to namelessness. The śrāvaka's path: ground and path revealed, covers bestowed, bowl and fan given—the supports for a journey of simplicity.

—

The bodhisattva's entry expands: generating bodhicitta, holding vows, the distinctive mind. Compassion not as emotion but as the natural radiance of emptiness. The Kriyā entry: nine aspects that multiply to twenty-seven with Upāya and Yoga. Each vehicle adding its own flavor to the same recognition.

—

The secret Mahā: twelve empowerments that overwhelm with their generosity. Prophecy, entry, revelation, flower-throwing, name, hearing, explaining, benefiting, power, vidyā, limb, distinctive. Each one a complete path, each one sufficient, yet all given together like a king bestowing his entire treasury.

—

Anu's six: entering, signs shown, breath emitted, mudrā transformed, action made, engagement certain. The precision of Anu yoga, where every gesture carries meaning, every breath is empowerment, every moment is the maṇḍala. Then Atiyoga's four: entering Great Perfection, flower-throwing in meditation, deity revealed, empowerment of effortless result. The culmination where methods dissolve into recognition.

—

The elaborate's extremely unelaborated: sixty-four methods that simplify to direct recognition. The mudrā maṇḍala's six external aspects—examining, summoning, seeking, requesting, bliss-seeking, expanding. The six internal: equipoise, bodhicitta with syllables, mirror-taking, vajra, lotus, wheel on the tongue. The six secret: bliss, actual bodhicitta, threefold secrecy. All indicated through words: signs, meanings, their non-duality.

—

The mathematics of liberation: six, nine, thirteen, seventeen, twenty-one—the numbers multiply yet the recognition remains one. Like ripples expanding in a pond, each circle larger yet all made of the same water. The elaborate path serves those who need elaboration; the unelaborated serves those ready for simplicity.

—

Listen to the counting: śrāvaka six, pratyekabuddha eleven, bodhisattva fifteen, Kriyā twenty-four, Upāya thirty-three, Yoga forty-two, Mahā fifty-four, Anu sixty, Ati sixty-four. Each number represents not superiority but appropriateness—the right medicine for the right illness. Ati's sixty-four appears smallest in method yet largest in recognition.

—

The without-elaboration's elaboration: outer, inner, secret, complete—fifteen methods that strip away until nothing remains but recognition. The very-without-elaboration adds thirty-six more, then the completely-without's twenty-eight. These aren't additions but subtractions—each layer removing obscuration until the naked recognition stands revealed.

—

The secret mandala's three aspects: awareness into expanse, expanse-awareness through deity, Buddha's heir through name. Outer prophecy through sense-faculties and objects—non-dual knowledge experienced. Inner through mind-clarity—empowerment free from birth. Secret through non-division—expanse-awareness's great bliss. Twelve total, yet all are one.

—

The very-without-elaboration unfolds: suitable entry and attainment, certain conduct and view, race distinction and self-abiding, cause and condition—eight aspects. The completely-without mirrors this structure: mind and speech abiding, speech transformed and mind attained, bliss prophesied and secret released, dwelling in manifestation and own action—eight more. Twenty-eight total in this category alone.

—

[9170]
Through all these empowerments—sixty-four in the elaborate system—the result is attained. Yet the result was never unattained. All these numbers are fingers pointing; don't count them, follow where they point. Your own nature, already perfect, never stained, spontaneously present. This is the great secret that all empowerments bestow.

—

The great yoga's stages: four grounds that are not sequential but simultaneous. Very yoga ground, self-ground certain, elaboration yoga ground, action-free complete. From certainty in one's nature through the play of elaboration to freedom from doing. These are not achievements but recognitions—different ways of seeing what was always present.

—

The discriminating yoga ground: sign, meaning, their non-duality, unmixed—four aspects of precision. The realizing yoga ground: miraculous emanation, distinction-realization, manifest arising, heroic race-distinction—four aspects of power. Sixteen grounds total when combined, yet they are facets of a single jewel, views from different angles of the same recognition.

—

On the first ground, seven miraculous powers: emanating bodies, multiplying limbs and heads, countless manifestations. These are not supernatural achievements but the natural display of awareness's unlimited capacity. The body that seems solid reveals its empty nature; the one that seems limited reveals its boundless potential. Don't chase these powers—let them arise naturally as byproducts of recognition.

—

The second ground: opening one's belly, showing entrails and heart. Another power that demonstrates the illusory nature of form. What seems solid is empty; what seems separate is one. These miracles are not for display but for teaching—the teacher's body becomes the teaching, demonstrating directly that all form is the play of awareness.

—

The sixteen grounds are not rungs on a ladder but waves on the ocean—each distinct yet all water. The practitioner who thinks "I have reached the first ground" misses the point. The grounds reveal themselves when recognition stabilizes, not when achievement is claimed.

—

Voice of experience: On the first ground, I thought there would be sixteen. On the sixteenth, I realized there was only ever one. The middle grounds taught me that counting is optional. The ground is not a place but a way of seeing.

—

The elaborate system of empowerments and grounds serves those who need structure. The unelaborated serves those ready for directness. Both arrive at the same recognition because there is only one nature of mind. The path accommodates all, excludes none, fulfills each according to their capacity.

—

The numbers—sixty-four empowerments, sixteen grounds, four aspects each—are skillful means. They give the mind something to do while recognition dawns. Like a mother counting sheep to help her child sleep—the counting is not the point; the rest is.

—

The ultimate empowerment is not conferred by another but recognized within. The ultimate ground is not reached but revealed. All the elaborate preparations lead to this simple recognition: you are already what you seek. This is the great secret, the profound treasure, the liberation that was never bound.

—

The structure of empowerment unfolds like a palace with many chambers. The practitioner enters through the outer gate, progresses through inner sanctums, reaches secret chambers, and finally arrives at the completely complete—the center that is everywhere. Each chamber contains the whole palace; each empowerment contains the complete path.

—

The tooth-stick distribution: an outer ritual that establishes the pattern of generosity. In ancient India, the tooth-stick was a simple gift, a sign of hospitality, a beginning of relationship. In the maṇḍala, it becomes the first empowerment—the recognition that all giving is self-giving, all receiving is self-receiving. The practitioner learns to give what cannot be lost and receive what was never separate.

—

The washing ritual: water as purification, water as blessing, water as the element that flows yet remains pure. The supplication: reaching toward what is already present, like a child reaching for the moon in water. The three vajra callings: summoning the deity who is one's own nature, calling the guru who is one's own heart, invoking the protection that was never absent.

—

The samaya oath-water: drinking the commitment that binds by freeing. Four oaths that seem paradoxical—abandoning saṃsāra that was never real, accepting nirvāṇa that was always present, refusing to benefit beings who have no separate existence. These oaths are not moral constraints but descriptions of recognition. To recognize is to abandon, accept, and refuse in ways that transcend ordinary understanding.

—

Entering the maṇḍala: stepping into the diagram that is one's own mind. Throwing the flower: offering what one is to discover where one lands. The name empowerment: receiving a designation that points beyond designation. The śrāvaka's simple path: ground and path as distinct, covers for protection, bowl and fan for sustenance and cooling. These supports serve until they are recognized as the path itself.

—

The bodhisattva expands the view: not personal liberation but universal awakening. Generating bodhicitta—the mind that turns toward enlightenment for all. Holding vows that cannot be held because there is no holder. The distinctive mind that distinguishes without discriminating. Then Kriyā's nine, Upāya's nine, Yoga's nine—twenty-seven methods for three approaches, all leading to the same gate.

—

The secret Mahā's twelve: prophecy that predicts what is already known, entry into what was never left, revelation of what was never hidden, flower-throwing into the center of oneself, naming what cannot be named, hearing what makes no sound, explaining the inexplicable, benefiting through non-doing, power that is powerlessness, vidyā as self-recognition, limbs of the body as limbs of awakening, distinctive marks of the unmistaken.

—

Anu's six: entering with precision, signs shown definitively, breath as the vehicle of wisdom, mudrā transformed into meaning, action that is non-action, engagement that is always already complete. Then Atiyoga's four—the culmination where methods become recognition: entering Great Perfection by recognizing one never left, throwing flowers into the maṇḍala of one's own mind, revealing the deity as oneself, empowerment as the effortless completion of what was always complete.

—

The elaborate's extremely unelaborated: sixty-four methods that dance between complexity and simplicity. The mudrā maṇḍala's external six—examining the consort who is one's own awareness, summoning what was never absent, seeking what was never lost, requesting what is always given, seeking bliss that is one's own nature, expanding into the limitless. The internal six—equipoise as natural state, bodhicitta resonating with syllables, mirror reflecting what is, vajra as indestructible nature, lotus as pristine awareness, wheel on the tongue as the turning of the teaching.

—

The secret six: bliss as the nature of experience, bodhicitta as actual rather than imagined, blessing in body speech and mind that recognizes their non-duality, secret that cannot be told, worthy of secrecy because it is beyond worth, focused on secrecy as the recognition of what cannot be objectified. All indicated through words that fail to capture what they indicate—signs, meanings, their inseparability.

—

The mathematics of the path: six plus nine plus four plus two equals the elaborate's twenty-one. Thirteen in the unelaborated's with-elaboration. Seventeen in its without-elaboration. The numbers accumulate like waves, each one carrying the practitioner closer to shore, yet the shore was never distant. The elaborate serves those who need steps; the unelaborated serves those ready to leap.

—

The grand enumeration: śrāvaka's six for individual liberation, pratyekabuddha's eleven for solitary realization, bodhisattva's fifteen for universal compassion. Then the tantric vehicles multiply: Kriyā's twenty-four, Upāya's thirty-three, Yoga's forty-two, Mahā's fifty-four, Anu's sixty, Ati's sixty-four. Each number is appropriate, each serves its purpose, each leads to the same recognition.

—

The without-elaboration unfolds its own structure: with-elaboration's fifteen methods that paradoxically use elaboration to transcend elaboration. The very-without-elaboration's thirty-six that approach directly. The completely-without's twenty-eight that rest in what is. These numbers are not hierachical—each is complete, each serves different capacities, each fulfills the practitioner who engages sincerely.

—

The secret mandala's teaching: introducing awareness into expanse—the vidyā into dharmadhātu. Pointing out expanse-awareness through deity recognition—dharmadhātu and vidyā as non-dual. Making Buddha's heir through name empowerment—the transmission that cannot be transmitted, the inheritance that was always possessed. Outer prophecy through sense-faculties and objects—experiencing their non-duality as knowledge and sphere.

—

Inner prophecy through mind-clarity—recognizing birthlessness as empowerment. Secret prophecy through non-division—encouragement that reveals expanse-awareness's great bliss was never separate from any experience. Twelve aspects, yet each contains the twelve, and the twelve are one, and one is empty, and emptiness is luminous.

—

The very-without-elaboration's eight: suitable entry for those ready, suitable attainment for those ripened, certain conduct as natural flow, certain view as direct seeing, race distinction as recognition of lineage, self-abiding as resting in nature, cause and condition as the dependent arising of recognition. Each pair completes a circuit; each circuit illuminates the whole.

—

The completely-without mirrors this: mind abiding as unmoving awareness, speech abiding as unceasing expression, speech transformed into mantra, mind attained as recognition, bliss prophesied as the natural result, secret released as the impossible disclosure, dwelling in manifestation as the nirmanakāya, own action attained as spontaneous benefit. Eight more, making the category's total, completing the structure.

—

[9170]
Through all empowerments—whether counted as sixty-four or as one—the result is attained. This is the supreme generosity of the teaching: to offer countless methods, knowing that methods are only fingers pointing. The result is not achieved but recognized; not attained but revealed. Your own nature, perfect from the beginning, unstained through all confusion, spontaneously liberated. This is the empowerment that all empowerments confer.

—

The great yoga's four grounds: the very yoga ground where practice begins, the self-ground certain where confidence arises, the elaboration yoga ground where methods multiply, the action-free complete where doing dissolves into being. These are not stages to climb but aspects to recognize—simultaneous, non-sequential, always present.

—

From certainty in one's nature—the recognition that cannot be shaken. Through the play of elaboration—the methods that serve until they are seen through. To freedom from doing—the natural state where action and non-action are one. This progression describes not time but deepening, not achievement but clarification.

—

The discriminating yoga ground's four: sign ground where appearances are recognized, meaning ground where their significance is seen, sign-meaning non-dual ground where appearance and emptiness unite, unmixed ground where all is distinct yet inseparable. The realizing yoga ground's four: miraculous emanation as natural display, distinction-realization as precise knowing, manifest arising as unobstructed expression, heroic race-distinction as confidence in lineage.

—

Sixteen grounds when enumerated, yet one ground when recognized. Like a jewel with sixteen facets—each facet reflects the whole jewel, each ground contains all grounds. The practitioner who recognizes one ground recognizes all; the one who thinks "this is the first ground" has not yet recognized.

—

The first ground's seven powers: emanating bodies as the recognition of multiplicity in unity, multiplying limbs as the play of the one in many, countless heads as the many perspectives of single awareness, emanating from emanations as the endless creativity of emptiness, various births as the compassion that takes form to serve beings. These are not supernatural achievements but the natural expression of recognition.

—

Don't chase these powers, practitioner. They arise as byproducts, not goals. The one who seeks powers seeks confusion; the one who recognizes lets powers arise and pass like clouds in the sky. The true miracle is not multiplication of form but recognition of formlessness; not displays of magic but the magic of ordinary recognition.

—

The second ground: opening the belly, showing entrails and heart-lungs. A teaching in flesh, a demonstration in blood. What seems most solid—organs, flesh, bone—revealed as display, as teachable, as empty. The teacher's body becomes the text; the student sees directly that all form is the play of awareness. Don't mistake this for morbidity—it is the ultimate generosity, using what seems most private to teach what is most universal.

—

The powers continue through the grounds, each one a teaching, each one a demonstration, each one a sign that the practitioner is stabilizing recognition. Yet the grounds are not achievements; they are descriptions of how recognition manifests. The one who has "reached" the sixteenth ground is the same one who started—the only difference is the recognition, not the recognizer.

—

The sixteen grounds dissolve into one when recognition deepens. Like sixteen rivers flowing into the same ocean—all waters, one sea. The practitioner who counts grounds is like a child counting waves; the wise one recognizes all waves as water. The ground is not a destination but a description; not an achievement but a recognition.

—

Voice of the ages: I have practiced through all sixteen grounds, yet I am no closer to awakening than when I began. The only difference is that now I know I am already awake. The grounds taught me this—not by what they gave but by what they took away. Each ground removed another belief in becoming, another hope of achievement, another fantasy of progress.

—

The elaborate system serves those who need structure; the simple recognition serves those ready for truth. Both are true; both lead to the same place. The path accommodates the slow walker and the leaper, the methodical and the sudden. This is the compassion of the teaching—that none are excluded, all are served, each according to their need.

—

The numbers—sixty-four, sixteen, twelve, four—are the language of those who need language. They give form to the formless, structure to the unstructured, path to the pathless. Yet the form is not the formed; the structure is not the structured; the path is not the destination. Use the numbers as you would use a raft: essential for crossing, unnecessary once arrived.

—

The ultimate empowerment: conferred not by lama, not by ritual, not by words, but by recognition itself. When awareness recognizes itself, that is empowerment. When confusion sees its own nature, that is the supreme initiation. No one bestows it; no one receives it. It is the natural state, spontaneously present, eternally complete.

—

The ultimate ground: not the sixteenth, not the first, but the groundless ground. The ground that supports all grounds without being grounded. The foundation that is found by seeking, the base that is baseless. This is what all the elaborate descriptions point toward—the simplicity that contains all complexity, the one taste of all phenomena.

—

Practitioner, don't be daunted by the numbers. Don't be overwhelmed by the classifications. These are skillful means, not the truth itself. The truth is simpler than any description, closer than any method, more immediate than any practice. Rest in that. Recognize that. Be that.

—

The treasure was always in the open. The empowerments bestow what was never lost. The grounds describe what was never absent. All this elaboration serves one purpose: to exhaust the mind's tendency to seek, to achieve, to become. When that tendency is exhausted, recognition dawns. And in that recognition, all the numbers resolve to one, all the methods dissolve into none, all the paths converge at the destination that was never left.

—

This completes the presentation of empowerments and grounds. May all who encounter these teachings recognize that the empowerment is already conferred, the ground is already reached, the recognition is already present. May the elaborate serve until it is seen through; may the simple be embraced when the time is ripe. May all beings recognize their own nature, perfect from the beginning, spontaneously present, naturally liberated.

—

The wind purifications unfold with mathematical precision. Four element winds—wind, water, fire, wind—each spreading, pervading, balancing, disturbing. Sixteen divisions, thirty-six with male and female, purifying half of action. This is not mere physiology but the subtle body's architecture, the channels and energies that support recognition.

—

The practitioner works with the winds not to achieve powers but to clear obstacles to recognition. The four cakras purified, the elements balanced, the prāṇa and bindu harmonized. These are supports for meditation, preparations for the direct recognition that transcends all preparation.

—

Four results emerge from the empowerments: temporary qualities and ultimate fruition. Temporary: elaborated empowers the twelve accumulations, unelaborated the four preparations, very unelaborated the seeing path, extremely unelaborated the nine meditations. These are supports, scaffolding for the palace of recognition.

—

The sixteen grounds join with the four devotions—entry, transformation, transcendence—each elaborated into sixteen variations. This is not complexity for its own sake but a complete mapping of the path's territory. Every possible approach, every temperament, every capacity finds its place in this mandala of methods.

—

The four vidyādhara grounds: yoga, mahāyoga, saṃdarbhayoga, realization yoga. Each divided into controlled and uncontrolled, then subdivided into four. Sixteen grounds total, each with its own qualities, its own powers, its own recognition. This is the fruition of the path, the result that was never separate from the ground.

—

On the first ground, seven miracles: emanation of bodies, multiplication of limbs, countless heads and forms. These are not supernatural achievements but the natural display of awareness's unlimited capacity. The form that seemed solid reveals its empty, luminous nature. Don't chase these displays; let them arise as signs of recognition, not goals to achieve.

—

The second through sixteenth grounds each reveal seven powers: opening the body, emitting fire and water, cutting and scattering, transforming elements, controlling space, fire, water, wind. These are demonstrations, teachings in form, showing that all phenomena are the play of awareness. The practitioner who seeks these powers misses the point; the one who recognizes lets them arise naturally.

—

The four vidyādharas: maturation, life control, mahāmudrā, spontaneous presence. Maturation: mind matured as deity, body not, liberating in bardo. Life control: liberating in that very state. Mahāmudrā: body and mind matured as deity. Spontaneous presence: accomplishing self and others' benefit. Four stages of fruition, four expressions of the same recognition.

—

The four activities: pacifying, increasing, empowering, wrathful. Each empowerment accomplishes one, yet each contains all four. Pacifying's pacifying, increasing, empowering, wrathful—sixteen variations total. This is the skillful activity of the realized practitioner, the spontaneous benefit that flows from recognition.

—

Temporary qualities emerge: body long-lived and free from illness, speech turning the dharma wheel, mind pure in samādhi, clairvoyance and miracle. These are byproducts, not goals. The practitioner who seeks them creates obstacles; the one who recognizes lets them arise as natural expressions.

—

The four appearances' qualities: elaborated shows dharmatā directly, unelaborated improves experience, very unelaborated brings awareness to measure, extremely unelaborated exhausts dharmatā. Each connects to Buddha ground, each dissolves the contaminated, each reveals the uncontaminated nature.

—

Ultimate fruition: Vajradhara's ground, complete qualities of inexhaustible body, speech, mind. Four signs, four measures, twelve, sixteen, twenty, twenty-four, twenty-eight, thirty-two—the numbers accumulate like light rays emanating from a central sun. Five-colored wisdom light arising as five Buddha maṇḍalas, spontaneously accomplished.

—

The five Buddhas: Vairocana in blue expanse, Akṣobhya in white, Ratnasambhava in yellow, Amitābha in red, Amoghasiddhi in green. Each maṇḍala complete, each emanating activity to the four realms—Abhirati east, Śrīmat south, Padmāvati west, Karmaprasiddha north. This is the complete fruition, the awakening that serves all beings.

—

This entire section unfolds like a cosmic architecture—the empowerments as foundations, the grounds as stories, the four results as the palace's completion, the ultimate fruition as its infinite ornamentation. Yet this palace is not built; it is recognized. The practitioner who engages with these teachings sincerely discovers that the palace was always their own mind, the architecture was always the nature of reality.

—

The elaborate system serves those who need elaborate methods. The unelaborated serves those ready for simplicity. The very unelaborated serves those on the verge of recognition. The extremely unelaborated serves those who rest in what is. All are true; all are skillful means; all lead to the same recognition.

—

The winds, the grounds, the results, the fruition—all descriptions of how recognition manifests, how stabilization deepens, how benefit flows. Don't mistake the description for the described, the map for the territory, the fingers for the moon. Use the teachings as they are meant to be used: as supports for recognition, not as objects of obsession.

—

Voice of completion: I have wandered through all these enumerations, counted all these numbers, classified all these categories. Now I rest. The elaboration served its purpose—it exhausted my mind's tendency to seek complexity. In the exhaustion, simplicity dawns. Recognition is not the sixteenth ground or the sixty-fourth empowerment. Recognition is now, always now, only now.

—

The treasury's generosity is boundless. It offers elaborate methods for those who need them, simple recognition for those ready for it. It enumerates sixty-four empowerments, sixteen grounds, four results, ultimate fruition—yet whispers throughout: all this is your own mind, all this is the play of awareness, all this is the nature of reality recognizing itself.

—

May all who encounter these teachings find the appropriate entry. May those who need elaboration find the elaborate path. May those ready for simplicity find the direct recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature, perfect from the beginning, spontaneously present, naturally liberated. This is the completion of the section on empowerments, grounds, and results.

—

The tooth-stick distribution seems trivial—a small stick for cleaning teeth. Yet in this gesture, the entire path is contained. The guru gives; the disciple receives. This establishes the relationship of transmission, the flow of blessing from heart to heart. What is given is not the stick but the recognition that all giving is self-giving, all receiving is self-receiving.

—

The maṇḍala offering that follows is the universe itself placed at the guru's feet. Not as abasement but as recognition—the guru is one's own awakened nature, the offering is one's own world, the offering is the nature of offering. The practitioner learns to give without grasping, to offer without expecting, to participate in the endless circulation of blessing.

—

The protection cord and kuśa grass are tangible symbols of intangible protection. The cord encircles, the grass purifies. These are supports for the mind that needs support, reminders for the awareness that tends to forget. Wear them not as charms but as commitments, not as superstitions but as symbols of the protection that is always present.

—

The dream examination concludes the elaborate external empowerment. Dreams are the mind's display, unfiltered by waking constraints. Examining them reveals patterns, shows progress, indicates obstacles. Yet don't become obsessed with dreams—the waking state is also dream, and the recognition that frees applies to both equally.

—

The unelaborated empowerments strip away ceremony to reveal essence. Washing—not ritual purification but recognition of primordial purity. Supplication—not begging but aligning with what is already present. The three vajra callings—summoning the deity who is oneself, the guru who is one's heart, the protection that never left.

—

The samaya oath-water binds through freeing. Four oaths that seem contradictory—abandoning what was never real, accepting what was always present, refusing to benefit beings who have no separate existence. These are not moral commands but descriptions of how recognition functions. To recognize is to be bound by freedom, freed by commitment.

—

The fully complete empowerment reveals the deity's face—your face, reflected. Throwing the flower to discover where it lands—where you are. The name empowerment—receiving a designation that points beyond designation. The śrāvaka's path—ground and path as distinct, the supports for a journey of renunciation and simplicity.

—

The bodhisattva's entry expands compassion to include all beings. Generating bodhicitta—the mind that turns toward awakening for all. Holding vows that cannot be held because there is no holder. Then the tantric multiplication: Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga—twenty-seven methods for three approaches, all leading to the same gate of recognition.

—

The secret Mahā's twelve overwhelm with generosity. Prophecy predicting what is known, entry into what was never left, revelation of what was never hidden. The Anu's six—precision in every gesture, meaning in every breath. Then Atiyoga's four—the culmination where methods become recognition, elaborate becomes simple, path becomes ground.

—

The four results emerge: temporary qualities supporting the path, ultimate fruition completing it. Elaborated empowers accumulation, unelaborated empowers preparation, very unelaborated empowers seeing, extremely unelaborated empowers meditation. These are not stages but aspects, not achievements but recognitions of what is always present.

—

The sixteen grounds are described with their powers—the emanations, the transformations, the displays. These are signs of recognition, not goals to pursue. The practitioner who seeks powers creates obstacles; the one who recognizes lets them arise naturally as byproducts of stabilized awareness.

—

The four vidyādharas represent stages of maturation. Maturation: mind ready, body not, liberation in bardo. Life control: liberation here and now. Mahāmudrā: body and mind fully transformed. Spontaneous presence: benefiting others effortlessly. These are not hierarchies but descriptions of how recognition manifests in different circumstances.

—

The four activities—pacifying, increasing, empowering, wrathful—are the natural expression of realization. Each empowerment accomplishes one, yet each contains all. The practitioner does not choose activities; activities choose themselves according to circumstances. This is spontaneous benefit, the play of compassion.

—

Temporary qualities emerge naturally—long life, health, persuasive speech, pure mind, clairvoyance, miracle. These are byproducts, not goals. The practitioner who seeks them builds prisons; the one who recognizes finds them at the door, free to use or not use as circumstances require.

—

Ultimate fruition: Vajradhara's ground, complete in every way. Five-colored light, five Buddha maṇḍalas, four realms of activity. This is not a place to reach but a way of being to recognize. The practitioner who thinks "I will become Vajradhara" misses the point; the one who recognizes discovers Vajradhara has always been the case.

—

This entire vast presentation serves one purpose: to exhaust the mind's tendency to seek complexity, to achieve, to become. When that tendency is exhausted, recognition dawns. All the elaborate methods dissolve into the simple fact of awareness. All the grounds resolve into the single ground of being. All the results reveal themselves as already present.

—

The treasury is generous beyond measure. It offers sixty-four empowerments for those who need them, sixteen grounds for those who walk them, four results for those who seek them, ultimate fruition for those who rest in it. Yet it whispers throughout: all this is your own mind, already perfect, never stained, spontaneously present.

—

May this presentation serve its purpose. May those who need elaboration find the elaborate path. May those ready for simplicity find the direct recognition. May all beings, whoever they are, wherever they are, recognize their own nature and be free. This completes the extensive section on empowerments, grounds, and results.

—

The elaborate enumeration of empowerments serves those who need structure. Each number—six, nine, twelve, sixteen, sixty-four—represents a doorway. Some practitioners enter through the gate of six; others need the complexity of sixty-four. All gates lead to the same palace; all empowerments confer the same recognition. The diversity is compassion, ensuring no one is excluded.

—

The wind purifications work with the subtle body—the channels, energies, and essences that support consciousness. Not as physiology but as the interface between coarse and subtle, between form and emptiness. Balancing the winds clears obstacles, prepares the ground, makes the mind workable. Yet the winds are also empty; their purification is also empty; the one who purifies is also empty.

—

The four results—temporary and ultimate—are not two different things. Temporary results support the path; ultimate result is the path's nature. Like a ladder: each rung supports the climb, yet the destination is not built from rungs. The temporary qualities are useful but not the point; the ultimate fruition is the point but cannot be achieved.

—

The sixteen grounds with their hundred miracles are displays of recognition. The first ground's emanations show multiplicity in unity. The second ground's body-opening shows emptiness of form. The third through sixteenth show increasingly subtle powers—controlling elements, transforming appearances, manifesting realms. All are natural expressions, not supernatural achievements.

—

The four vidyādharas describe how recognition matures. Maturation vidyādhara: mind transformed, body not yet. Life control: liberation in this life. Mahāmudrā: complete transformation of body and mind. Spontaneous presence: effortless benefit for all. These are not hierarchical stages but responses to different capacities and circumstances.

—

The four activities—pacifying obstacles, increasing virtues, empowering capabilities, wrathfully subduing—flow naturally from recognition. The realized practitioner does not choose; circumstances determine the appropriate response. This is spontaneous activity, the play of compassion, the natural expression of wisdom.

—

This vast section is a complete presentation of the path's structure. From the elaborate empowerments through the sixteen grounds to the ultimate fruition of Vajradhara—every aspect is described, every possibility covered. Yet the description is not the described; the map is not the territory. Use this presentation as support for recognition, not as an object of intellectual fascination.

—

The treasury's generosity: offering methods for every type of mind. Some need the structure of sixty-four empowerments; others need the simplicity of direct recognition. Both are served; both are complete; both lead to the same awakening. This is the skillful means of the Great Perfection—accommodating all, excluding none.

—

May all who study this section find the appropriate entry. May the elaborate serve those who need it; may the simple reveal itself to those ready. May all beings recognize their nature, perfect from the beginning, spontaneously present, naturally liberated. This completes the presentation of empowerments, grounds, four results, and ultimate fruition.

—

The practitioner encountering this vast presentation may wonder: where do I begin? The answer: begin where you are. If you need structure, enter through the elaborate empowerments. If you need simplicity, rest in direct recognition. The path accommodates all; the treasury excludes none.

—

Don't be intimidated by the numbers—sixty-four, sixteen, one hundred. They are skillful means, not requirements. The practitioner who engages with one empowerment sincerely receives all sixty-four. The one who recognizes one ground knows all sixteen. The numbers describe possibilities, not obligations.

—

The wind purifications, the grounds, the results, the fruition—all are descriptions of how recognition manifests. Don't seek the manifestations; seek the recognition. Don't pursue the powers; pursue the stability from which powers arise. Don't count the grounds; recognize the groundless ground.

—

This section is complete. It has presented the elaborate path in its fullness. From the first empowerment to the ultimate fruition of Vajradhara, nothing is omitted. May it serve those who need it. May it be transcended by those ready. May all recognize what these words point toward.

—

Voice of the ages: I have taught these sixty-four empowerments, these sixteen grounds, these four results. Now I rest. The teaching is complete; the recognition is yours. Don't seek more words; seek what the words indicate. Don't accumulate more methods; use what you have. Don't postpone recognition; it is now.

—

The completion of this section is not an ending but a beginning. From here, the practitioner either continues with more elaborate methods or rests in simple recognition. Both are valid; both are complete. The treasury provides both because beings need both. May you find what you need.

—

The elaborate path presented here is like a vast library. Some enter and read every book; others enter and read one. Both find what they need. The practitioner who completes all sixty-four empowerments is not superior to the one who recognizes through one. Both have recognized; both are complete.

—

The grounds are not achievements to collect but recognitions to stabilize. The first ground is complete; the sixteenth ground is complete. There is no hierarchy, only different expressions of the same recognition. The practitioner on the first ground who recognizes fully is the same as the practitioner on the sixteenth.

—

The four activities—pacifying, increasing, empowering, wrathful—are the natural play of a realized mind. They are not special powers but ordinary activities seen through. When the practitioner recognizes, ordinary activities become these four. When recognition stabilizes, these four become spontaneous.

—

The ultimate fruition is not a future goal but present nature. Vajradhara is not a being to become but the nature of being itself. The five Buddha maṇḍalas are not places to reach but aspects of mind to recognize. The four realms are not destinations but descriptions of how recognition serves.

—

This concludes the extensive presentation. May it benefit all who encounter it. May the elaborate serve those who need it. May the simple reveal itself to those ready. May all recognize their own nature, the Great Perfection that has always been the case.

—

The treasury's generosity knows no bounds. It offers elaborate methods for those who need them, simple recognition for those ready. Sixty-four empowerments for complex minds, one recognition for simple hearts. All are served; none are excluded. This is the compassion of the Great Perfection.

—

The sixteen grounds are sixteen ways of describing one recognition. The four results are four aspects of the same fruition. The ultimate attainment is not attainment but recognition of what has always been. May all who study this find their path and follow it to its end—which is no end, but the beginning of recognition.

—

Completion. The presentation of empowerments, grounds, four results, and ultimate fruition is finished. May it serve beings until the end of time. May it be transcended by those ready. May the recognition it points to dawn in all minds. This is the wish of the treasury, the aspiration of the lineage, the blessing of the masters.

—

The final word: all these empowerments, grounds, and results are skillful means. The truth is simpler than any description. Rest in your own nature. Recognize what has always been present. This is the Great Perfection, the completion of all paths, the fulfillment of all aspirations.

—

May all beings recognize their true nature. May the elaborate path serve those who need it. May direct recognition dawn for those ready. This is the completion of the section on empowerments and grounds, presented in its fullness for the benefit of all.

—

Complete. Recognize now.

Recognition is the completion of all empowerments and grounds.

Complete.
Recognize.
