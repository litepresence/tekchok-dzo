Divine appearance—the kayas manifesting. Full kayas, half-kayas, father-mother
forms, spheres, great mandalas. These are not fantasies or hallucinations. They are
the natural display of awareness when awareness recognizes itself. The signs of
Thogal fruition: body relics, self-arisen images, light and sound, manifest
buddhahood.

From Vajrasattva Mirror Tantra—these signs appear for the one achieving
manifest buddhahood. Not as reward. Not as special effects. They are the
spontaneous expression of recognition stabilized, of wisdom matured, of nature
unfolding.
