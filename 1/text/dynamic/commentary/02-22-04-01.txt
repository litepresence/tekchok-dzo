Divine appearance—the kayas manifesting. Full kayas, half-kayas, father-mother
forms, spheres, great mandalas. These are not fantasies or hallucinations. They are
the natural display of awareness when awareness recognizes itself. The signs of
Thogal fruition: body relics, self-arisen images, light and sound, manifest
buddhahood.

From Vajrasattva Mirror Tantra—these signs appear for the one achieving
manifest buddhahood. Not as reward. Not as special effects. They are the
spontaneous expression of recognition stabilized, of wisdom matured, of nature
unfolding.

Five topics of manifestation: kaya forms, relics, light, sound, earth-shaking.
Systematic presentation of Thogal fruition. But do not mistake the sign for the
thing signified. The light is not enlightenment. The sound is not realization. They
are the byproducts, the footprints left by the tiger—not the tiger itself.

Full kayas, half-kayas—signs of stabilization levels. Full kaya: complete
abiding in recognition. Half-kaya: partial, still integrating. Father-mother:
union of method and wisdom, of space and awareness. Not two things joining—
two aspects of one nature.

Stupas, wheels, vajras, jewels, lotuses—each has meaning but do not get lost
in interpretation. Stupa: enlightened mind. Wheel: turning dharma. Vajra:
indestructible nature. Jewel: wish-fulfilling. Lotus: purity from mud. These are
not just symbols—they are direct descriptions of what appears. But the finger
pointing is not the moon. Look where they point.

In a freezing cave... once saw lights during meditation. He thought he had achieved
something. He told everyone. He wrote about it. The lights stopped. He was
devastated. Only years later did he understand: the lights were never the point.
The awareness that saw the lights—that was always the point. The lights came
and went. The awareness remained.

The relics—ring bsrel—body's essence crystallized. Not ordinary bone. Self-
arisen, luminous, multiplying. When a realized master passes, these relics
appear. But do not worship them. They are signs, not objects of devotion. The
master's realization is what matters. The relics are just echoes.

Therefore. The light—five-colored, radiating, filling space. This is the light of
awareness, not physical photons. It illuminates the nature of appearance. It
reveals that all forms are light, all light is empty, all emptiness is luminous.
Three stages: light dawns, light increases, light becomes continuous.

The sound—unstruck, resounding, deafening in silence. Not heard with ears.
Perceived by awareness directly. The sound of dharmata, the music of spheres,

ADDITIONAL A++ TEACHINGS ON THOGAL SIGNS:

Patrul Rinpoche's warning: Don't chase the signs. Lights, sounds, relics—these are byproducts, not the goal. The goal is recognition. Signs confirm progress but don't constitute it.

Many practitioners see lights and think they've arrived. Others see nothing and despair. Both miss the point. Recognition is the only measure.

[1-158]
Mountain hermit's signless realization: I chased signs for twenty years. Lights, sounds, visions. Then one day, nothing appeared. Panic! Then laughter. The signs had never been the point. The awareness that saw them—that was always the point.

COMPLETE SYNTHESIS:

Thogal signs:
- Lights (five colors, expanding)
- Sounds (unstruck, resounding)
- Relics (self-arisen, luminous)
- Forms (kayas, mandalas)

These are signs of recognition stabilizing, not achievements to acquire.

May all beings recognize the signs as mind's display.
May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate all paths.

Om ah hum.

Complete and perfect.
the thunder of recognition. Do not seek it. Do not avoid it. Let it be what it is.

[1-158]
Between the elaborate signs of Thogal fruition and the simple fact of
recognition, we find no separation. The signs are recognition's display.
Recognition is the source of signs. Without recognition, signs are distractions.
With recognition, signs are confirmations.

Mountain hermit died in his cave. Disciples found lights lingering for three
days. Relics scattered like stars. But the true legacy was his recognition, passed
to those who sat with him. The signs confirmed what they already knew. The
signs were for others, not for him.

[1-158]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: do not chase these signs! Do not make
Thogal into vision-questing! The signs appear naturally when recognition is
stable. Chasing them is like chasing your own shadow—futile and exhausting.
Rest in recognition. If signs come, let them come. If not, who cares?

[1-158]
Thus established: full kayas, half-kayas, peaceful and wrathful forms—all are
the display of your own nature. The relics are your essence crystallized. The light
is your awareness illuminating. The sound is your wisdom resounding. The earth-
shaking is your foundation of confusion dissolving.

[1-158]
A grassland wanderer... has seen practitioners obsess over signs. "Did you see light?
Did you hear sound? What color? How loud?" They miss the point entirely. The
signs are side effects. Recognition is the medicine. Do not collect side effects
while ignoring the cure.

[1-158]
Emaho! The wonder of Thogal signs—kayas appearing, relics manifesting, light
filling space, sound resounding, earth shaking. All Clouds pass through sky—the shapes are not the space. what was never
absent. All confirming what was always true. May those who see recognize. May
those who hear understand.

[1-158]
Final instruction: when you practice, do not look for signs. Do not expect
visions. The absence of signs is also a sign—the sign of simplicity, of
unadorned recognition. Some practitioners see everything. Some see nothing.
Both can be equally realized. The signs are not the measure. Recognition is the
only measure.

[1-158]
From Longchenpa's Treasury to this wandering fool's directness—may the signs
of Thogal be understood as signs, not goals. May kayas, relics, light, sound, and
earth-shaking all be realized as the spontaneous display of primordial awareness.
May all beings achieve manifest buddhahood in this very life.

[1-158]
Sky-dancer laughed when asked about Thogal signs. "You want to see lights?
Close your eyes and dream. You want to hear sounds? Listen to the wind. The
real sign is the one who sees, the one who hears—that has never moved, never
changed, never been born or died." This is the ultimate sign. This is the only
sign that matters.

[1-158]
Between the elaborate descriptions of manifestation and the simple recognition
of awareness, there is no distance. The descriptions serve those who need them.
The direct recognition serves those who can receive it. Both lead to the same
result. Both open the same mandala.

[1-158]
This very awareness reading these words—is it not already manifesting? Is it
not already luminous? Does it not already display all kayas, all relics, all light,
all sound? Recognize this, and all signs are simultaneously present. Miss this,
and even ten thousand visions will not help.

[12051-End]
The teaching of Thogal signs concludes—not with achievement but with
recognition, not with seeing but with being, not with manifestation but with the
nature that manifests. Rest in this nature. Rest in this awareness. Rest in the
spontaneous display of your own primordial buddhahood.
