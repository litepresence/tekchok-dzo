First, regarding essence: divine appearance—full kayas, half-kayas. The signs of thod rgal fruition: body relics, self-arisen images, great light and sound display, manifest buddhahood. This is the Great Perfection's unique path—recognition in this life, liberation in this life.

From Vajrasattva Mirror Tantra: these signs—light, sound, relics, kayas, earth-shaking and so forth—manifest for the one achieving manifest buddhahood. This is not ordinary; it is your own nature displaying its power.

[11338-11425]
Five topics of manifestation signs: 1) sku (kaya forms), 2) ring bsrel (relics), 3) 'od (light), 4) sgra (sound), 5) sa g.yo (earth-shaking). Systematic presentation of thod rgal fruition indicators.

The kaya's essence is divine appearance—full kayas, half-kayas, father-mother forms, spheres, great mandalas, stupas, wheels, vajras, jewels, lotuses, and more. From generation and completion practice, these appear as signs of maturity. But in thod rgal, they appear spontaneously, without fabrication.

Full kayas, half-kayas—signs of different stabilization levels of thod rgal vision. Full kaya = complete stabilization. Half-kaya = partial stabilization. Father-mother = union of stabilizing factors.

[11426-11443]
Stupas, wheels, vajras, jewels, lotuses—each has meaning. Stupa: enlightened mind. Wheel: turning the dharma. Vajra: indestructible nature. Jewel: wish-fulfilling essence. Lotus: purity from mud. But don't get lost in symbols. The symbol points; don't suck the finger.

[11444-End]
The relics—ring bsrel—body's essence crystallized. Not ordinary bone or ash. Self-arisen, luminous, multiplying. The light—five-colored, radiating, filling space. The sound—unstruck, resounding, deafening in silence. The earth-shaking—not physical earthquake but foundation-shaking recognition. All signs of manifest buddhahood.

Don't wait for them. Don't expect them. When they come, let them come. When they go, let them go. The coming and going is the nature's play. You are not the player. You are the play itself.
