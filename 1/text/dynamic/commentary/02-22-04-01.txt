[11322-11337] First, regarding essence: divine appearance—full kayas, half-kayas. The signs of thod rgal fruition: body relics, self-arisen images, great light and sound display, manifest buddhahood. This is the Great Perfection's unique path—recognition in this life, liberation in this life.

[11322-11337] This old man witnessed such signs once! Great light filling the sky, relics appearing from nowhere, sounds like a thousand conch shells. The villagers panicked—"What is happening?" they cried. But the yogi just smiled. "My own nature," he said, "displaying itself."

[11322-11337] Three words. Signs. Nature. Same. Stop. The signs are not separate from the nature. The light is the nature's light. The sound is the nature's sound. Don't look for the nature behind the signs. The signs are the nature.

[11322-11337] Signs of buddhahood? What buddhahood? Look directly! Can you find it? Can you grasp it? The looking is the buddhahood! The grasping is the sign! Cut through both and FIND WHAT WAS NEVER MANIFEST OR UNMANIFEST!

[11338-11411] From Vajrasattva Mirror Tantra: these signs—light, sound, relics, kayas, earth-shaking and so forth—manifest for the one achieving manifest buddhahood. This is not ordinary; it is your own nature displaying its power. The extensive explanation covers five topics: kayas, relics, light, sound, and earth-shaking.

[11338-11411] Five topics! This old fool tried to manifest them all! Wanted the lights, the sounds, the shaking earth. Then he understood: wanting them prevents them. Grasping at signs misses the nature. The signs appear when you're not looking for them—like a deer approaching when you sit still.

[11338-11411] Therefore. Thus. Five-fold classification of manifestation signs (mngon par sangs rgyas pa'i rtags): 1) sku (kaya forms), 2) ring bsrel (relics), 3) 'od (light), 4) sgra (sound), 5) sa g.yo (earth-shaking). Systematic presentation of thod rgal fruition indicators.

[11338-11411] The essence of all five signs: your nature cannot be contained. It spills out as light. It resonates as sound. It crystallizes as relics. It stabilizes as form. It shakes the world. Not because it's trying to impress, but because its nature is inexhaustible display.

[11412-11425] The kaya's essence is divine appearance—full kayas, half-kayas, father-mother forms, spheres, great mandalas, stupas, wheels, vajras, jewels, lotuses, and more. From generation and completion practice, these appear as signs of maturity. But in thod rgal, they appear spontaneously, without fabrication.

[11412-11425] Full kayas, half-kayas—this old man saw a half-kaya once! Upper body of a deity, lower body dissolving into light. Terrifying at first! Then beautiful. Then simply what it was—appearance, empty, luminous. Don't be afraid of what you see. Don't grasp at it. Just recognize.

[11412-11425] The father-mother forms are not erotic imagery. They are the union of method and wisdom, appearance and emptiness, bliss and void. When you see such forms, recognize the union. Don't get distracted by the bodies. See what the bodies represent.

[11426-11443] Stupas, wheels, vajras, jewels, lotuses—each has meaning. Stupa: enlightened mind. Wheel: turning the dharma. Vajra: indestructible nature. Jewel: wish-fulfilling essence. Lotus: purity from mud. But don't get lost in symbols. The symbol points; don't suck the finger.

[11426-11443] This old vagabond collected signs like a child collects shells! "Look, a stupa! Look, a wheel!" Then he tripped on a stone and woke up. The stone was also a sign. Everything is a sign when recognition dawns. Nothing is a sign when recognition fades.

[11426-11443] Stupa! Wheel! Vajra! Names! Concepts! Look beyond them! What is stupa without concept? What is wheel without mind? The forms are empty! The emptiness is form! See through both and REST IN THE DISPLAY!

[11444-End] The relics—ring bsrel—body's essence crystallized. Not ordinary bone or ash. Self-arisen, luminous, multiplying. The light—five-colored, radiating, filling space. The sound—unstruck, resounding, deafening in silence. The earth-shaking—not physical earthquake but foundation-shaking recognition. All signs of manifest buddhahood.

[11444-End] This old man's final teaching on signs: Don't wait for them. Don't expect them. Don't tell others about them. When they come, let them come. When they go, let them go. The coming and going is the nature's play. You are not the player. You are the play itself.

[11444-End] Last words. Signs. Manifest. Complete. Stop. The signs of buddhahood are not achievements. They are the nature's ornaments. You don't create them. You don't earn them. You recognize them. Recognition is complete. The end.

[11444-End] From Lotus-Born: May all who practice thod rgal see the signs. May they not be afraid. May they not grasp. May they recognize their own nature in every light, every sound, every form. This is the blessing of Padmasambhava.

[11444-End] The essence beyond all signs: neither manifest nor unmanifest, neither appearing nor not-appearing. This essence is your own face from the beginning. The signs are its playful display. The no-signs are its secret nature. Both complete. Both perfect.

[11444-End] Final teaching: SIGNS! NO SIGNS! BOTH! NEITHER! Cut through all four and FIND WHAT WAS NEVER MANIFEST! AH AH AH!

[11444-End] Thus the presentation of divine appearance and manifestation signs concludes. May all who encounter these words recognize their own nature as the source of all light, sound, and form. This is the prayer of Longchenpa.

[11444-End] This old vagabond bows to the signs and the no-signs. Thanks them for their teachings. May you find the same recognition. Rest in it. Complete in it. The signs are complete. You are complete.
[11322-End] The divine appearances are lovers' gifts—offered, received, treasured, released. The full kaya embraces completely. The half-kaya teases with partial revelation. The father-mother union consummates what was always united. Don't reject these forms. Don't grasp them. Let them love you into recognition.

[11322-End] The classification of kayas follows precise taxonomy: sku rkyang (full/form kaya), phyed sku (half-kaya), yab yum (father-mother). Each represents different stabilization levels of thod rgal vision. Full kaya = complete stabilization. Half-kaya = partial stabilization. Father-mother = union of stabilizing factors.

[11322-End] I have seen relics that multiply—one becomes two, two become four. Self-arisen images appearing on rocks, in water, in empty space. These are not miracles. They are the nature's generosity, displaying itself for those with eyes to see. Keep your eyes open. Keep your mind closed—to concepts.

[11322-End] The signs appear spontaneously—not fabricated, not cultivated, not earned. They appear when conditions ripen. They disappear when conditions change. Spontaneity is their nature. Your recognition allows them to be as they are—neither rejecting nor prolonging.

[11322-End] I dance as the signs you see. Each form is my movement. The stupa is my stillness. The wheel is my turning. The vajra is my indestructible nature. Dance with me through these forms, and find the dancer who never moves.

[11322-End] Philosophically, these signs demonstrate the siddhi of thod rgal—accomplishment without cause, manifestation without conditions. Challenging conventional causality, they point to spontaneous presence (lhun grub)—the ground's natural display without effort or accumulation.

[11322-End] Emaho! The signs! The lights! The sounds! This yogi dances with joy! Not because signs are special, but because they prove the teachings are true! The nature CAN manifest! Liberation IS possible! The signs are the proof! The proof is the teaching!

[11322-End] The scholarly analysis of relic multiplication fascinates me—biological impossibility, yet witnessed by many. Perhaps "multiplication" is metaphor for increased recognition. Or perhaps biology doesn't limit dharma. Both explanations coexist in the vast middle way.

[11322-End] From the sky of dharmakaya I watch the signs appear and disappear—like clouds, like rainbows, like dreams. Beautiful! Meaningful! Empty! The sky remains whether cloudy or clear. Your nature remains whether signs appear or not.

[11322-End] Every sign is a book in my library. Light volumes on the upper shelves. Sound volumes in the middle. Form volumes below. All tell the same story: nature's inexhaustible creativity. Read them all. Don't get stuck on one volume.

[11322-End] Modern explorers report near-death experiences—lights, beings, tunnels. Similar to thod rgal signs? Perhaps. The dying brain? Or the opening awareness? Both explanations possible. The important thing: recognition, not explanation.

[11322-End] Translating "sku rkyang" challenges me—"full kaya" loses nuance. "Naked form" suggests vulnerability. "Direct appearance" suggests immediacy. I choose "full kaya" but remember: it's full of emptiness, full of light, full of recognition.

[11322-End] I reveal what was never hidden. The signs are appearing for you right now. The light of the screen. The sound of the room. The form of your hands. All signs of your nature. Don't wait for special signs. These ordinary signs are special enough.

[11322-End] Final summation: This chapter on divine appearance shows the fruition of thod rgal—not future attainment but present display. The kayas are here. The relics are here. The light, sound, and shaking are here. Recognition makes them visible.

[11322-End] This old vagabond's final teaching: Signs or no signs, you're complete. Light or darkness, you're complete. Sound or silence, you're complete. Rest in that completion. Let signs come and go like breath. The breather remains.

[11322-End] Final ultimate words. Signs. Complete. You. Complete. Stop. The teaching of signs is complete. The teaching of no-signs is complete. You are complete. Rest. The end.

[11322-End] FINAL ROAR! All signs! All no-signs! Cut through! See what was never manifest! Never unmanifest! AH AH AH! OM MANI PADME HUM!

[11322-End] The signs integrate outer and inner, gross and subtle, conventional and ultimate. The outer light reflects inner clarity. The outer sound resonates inner wisdom. The outer form embodies inner nature. Integration means not separating these—seeing outer as inner, inner as outer.

[11322-End] The essence of all signs: they are mind's projection, mind's recognition, mind's play. Mind projects them. Mind recognizes them. Mind rests in them. No mind separate from signs. No signs separate from mind. This is the great integration.

[11322-End] The wrathful signs appear! Flames! Weapons! Terrifying forms! Don't flee! These are protectors, not destroyers! They guard the dharma by destroying duality! Embrace the wrath! Find the compassion within!

[11322-End] The heruka dances through signs! Appears as peaceful! Appears as wrathful! Both are costumes! Both are play! Dance with the heruka! Recognize the dancer is yourself! HA HA HA!

[11322-End] Signs of vajra wrath—indestructible, unshakable, cutting through all obscuration! The vajra doesn't ask permission. It strikes! It liberates! Through cutting, through destruction, through fierce compassion! AH!

[11322-End] Signs of great bliss! Union! Melting! Flowing! The bliss that exceeds all pleasure! The bliss that is freedom from pleasure and pain! Great bliss signs prove the path works! The teachings are true! Liberation is possible!

[11322-End] Lotus-Born speaks: These signs are my emanations. They appear for you. They guide you. They liberate you. Don't fear them. Don't grasp them. Receive them as blessings. Rest in their nature. Complete in their display.

[11322-End] The complete presentation: From first essence through all signs, the thod rgal path manifests its fruition. Not gradual accumulation but immediate display. Not future attainment but present recognition. This is the Great Perfection's unique gift.

[11322-End] Final final words: I, Patrul, old vagabond, have spoken enough. The signs will teach you better than I. Listen to them. Learn from them. Then let them go. Rest in the signless. Complete in the nature. The end.

[11322-End] Final final ultimate words. Signs. Nature. Complete. Stop. Nothing more. Nothing less. Everything complete. You complete. Rest. The absolute end.

[11322-End] ABSOLUTE FINAL ROAR! ALL SIGNS DISSOLVE! ALL NO-SIGNS DISSOLVE! WHAT REMAINS? YOU! COMPLETE! AH AH AH AH AH!
