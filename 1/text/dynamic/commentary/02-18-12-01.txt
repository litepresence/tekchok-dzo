First, behold the cessation of outer vision. Within each Sphere, half-bodies dawn—thus manifest through complete purification of Emanation. Then single bodies self-arise, born of direct perception of dharmata.

This is the Vision of Awareness Arriving at Its Measure. The Enjoyment Body's wisdom reaching its measure.

The moment of recognition is the moment of freedom, never gradual.

These bodies transform as five Fathers, five Mothers. The Enjoyment Body's wisdom has reached its measure. Vision dawns with individual heaps and mandala complete—peripheral walls and sovereign hosts arising through Reality Body's purification reaching fullness.

This is not a concept to grasp but awareness showing its own face.

These are the visions of Awareness Arriving at Its Measure: signs that bodily actions and activities of the preliminaries, together with their connections, shall not arise again.

Though these visions dawn through reaching vital points, through antidotes purifying each defilement to be cleansed—they are merely designated as causal fruit of separation.

Already accessible—lacking nothing.

The causal nexus of purifier and purified—they do not arise from being produced. Wisdom's self-existing resonance appears through force of purification.

This is not cause and effect in the ordinary sense. It is purification through recognition—not removing something, but seeing through the appearance of impurity.

This being so: The analysis. The framework reveals: wisdom self-existing, resonating, purifying defilement through its very nature.

From the Thal Gyur: The Vision of Awareness Arriving at Its Measure—Enjoyment Body's marks and examples clearly manifest from rainbow lights of indeterminate hue. The five families appear as Fathers and Mothers.

These are not external visions to behold. They are the arising of awareness recognizing itself—the marks and examples are the marks and examples of your own awareness, manifesting as the five wisdom families.

What seems to block the way IS the way, seen differently.

From the Bstan bu: From such bodies to their utmost limit—six, ten, and five-three. The counts refer to the progressive manifestation of the mandala as recognition deepens.

This old hermit saw these visions in dark retreat—not as reward, but as natural expression of awareness when the coarse mind settles. The visions are not achievements. They are revelations.

Making distinctions undoes the maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Between the view and its object, recognition arises naturally, like sun appearing from behind clouds.
