[15635-15640]
From Pearl Garland, the essence of fruition: liberation itself is primordial. Not
something achieved, not something attained—recognition returning to what was never
left. This is the final secret, the ultimate pointing: ka-dag is not a state to reach but the
nature of whatever appears. Exhaustion of confusion-ground does not mean destruction
of something real—it means seeing through what never existed.

[15641-15654]
Three aspects of liberation into expanse: how it happens, what abides, how suchness
holds itself. These are not stages to traverse but perspectives on what is already
complete. The sharp practitioner recognizes in this life. The medium recognizes in
bardo. The dull recognizes in the next rebirth. But recognize they all do—same
recognition, same result, same Dharmakaya beyond expression.

[15655-15677]
This old fool watched three practitioners die. The first, sharp faculties, sat upright,
smiled, and dissolved like mist in morning sun—liberated on the spot. The second,
medium faculties, wandered the bardo for days we measured, then suddenly laughed
and was gone. The third, dull faculties, took rebirth in a pure field, practiced there, and
reached the same end. Same destination, different routes—all equally valid.

[15678-15700]
See. The moment of liberation is not a moment at all. It is the recognition that time
never contained what we sought. Dharmakaya beyond expression—beyond expression
because there is no one to express, nothing to express, no expression occurring. Yet this
"beyond" is utterly intimate, closer than breath.

[15701-15730]
Thus. The analysis of three faculties serves humility, not hierarchy. Do not compare
your speed to others'. The slow walker who recognizes fully surpasses the swift runner
who grasps partially. What matters is not when liberation occurs but its quality—total,
complete, beyond regret.

[15731-15760]
Between the vast expanse of Longchenpa's Treasury and this old vagabond's
directness, we find the meeting point: liberation is not escape from phenomena but
recognition of their nature. Samsara does not transform into nirvana—they are seen as
never separate. The ground exhausted was never a ground. The result attained was
never apart.

[15761-15800]
Spontaneous dissolution—lhun grub revealing itself. Like light returning to its source,
like water poured into water, like space merging with space. No struggle, no effort, no
achievement. The path appears as the fruit, the fruit was always the path. What
practitioner could claim this as their doing?

[15801-15830]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why delay? Why wait for death to recognize
what is present now? The bardo of this moment contains the same opportunities as the
bardo of dying. Same appearances, same chances for liberation, same risk of missing.
Recognition now is liberation now. There is no other time.

[15831-15860]
This very breath—does it come or go? In the coming, expansion. In the going,
dissolution. The practitioner who knows this breath as Dharmakaya breath does not
fear the final exhalation. They have practiced dying with every inhalation, practiced
being reborn with every exhalation. Death holds no surprise.

[15861-15900]
Mountain hermit sat for thirty years in one cave. When asked what he realized, he said:
"I learned that thirty years pass like a single breath, and a single breath contains thirty
years." This is the meaning of spontaneous results—time and timelessness are not
opposed. Liberation occurs in both simultaneously.

[15901-15940]
Therefore. The exhaustion of the path ('khrul gzhi zad pa) means exhaustion of the
need for path, not exhaustion of what path revealed. It is like reaching the mountain
top—the climbing is over, but the view remains. Path exhausted, fruit revealed. Path
and fruit are one in nature, distinct only in the perspective of one still climbing.

[15941-15980]
Sky-dancer laughed when asked about results. "You ask what you will become, but you
have never been anything else." The recognition of Buddhahood is not becoming
something new—it is recognizing what was never absent. Samantabhadra is not a
distant goal but the nature of your own awareness.

[15981-16020]
Three faculties, one result. Why? Because faculties are relative, result is absolute.
Sharp or dull, quick or slow—all are concepts in the mind that seeks. When seeking
ceases, what difference between faculties? The Dharmakaya does not discriminate
between those who arrive swiftly and those who arrive slowly. All are equally
welcome.

[16021-16060]
This old vagabond once met a yogi who claimed enlightenment after three years of
practice. "What did you gain?" I asked. He could not answer. "What did you lose?" He
remained silent. "Then what changed?" Finally he laughed. "Only the idea that
something needed to change." This is the fruit—recognition of what never changed.

[16061-16100]
Dakini's whisper: the pure field is not somewhere else. It is this very perception,
recognized. The emanation body field is not distant—it is how appearances display
themselves to awareness that knows their nature. Liberation in this life with remainder
or without—both are complete. Both are partial. Both descriptions miss what cannot be
described.

[16101-16140]
Between ordinary appearance and pure appearance, no essential difference. The
difference lies in recognition. Ordinary mind perceives impure fields because it does
not recognize. Pure mind perceives pure fields because recognition has dawned. Fields
themselves are neither pure nor impure—they simply are, waiting for the mind that
knows them.

[16141-16180]
The four lamps illuminate the path. The four lamps dissolve into expanse. What
illuminated becomes what is illuminated. What was path becomes fruit. This is not
progression but revelation—what was always true becoming obvious. Like cleaning a
mirror, we do not create the reflection; we reveal what was always reflecting.

[16181-16220]
First Point: see your own nature. Resolve completely. Continue without distraction.
These three apply equally to path and fruit. On the path, they guide practice. In the
fruit, they describe what is spontaneously present. No practitioner, no practice, no
path—yet recognition continues, resolve remains, natural flow uninterrupted.

[16221-16260]
Wrathful compassion cuts through: you think liberation is something that will happen
to you. This very thought is the obstacle. Liberation is not an event in time—it is the
nature of time itself. Stop waiting. Stop preparing. Recognize now, and the fruit is
present. Delay, and you wander in bardo of your own creating.

[16261-16300]
The text says "exhaling breath in emanation field"—this is not failure. It is liberation
in the next moment. The practitioner who recognizes in bardo, who takes rebirth in
pure field, who practices there and awakens—they too reach the same Dharmakaya.
No hierarchy, no judgment, no comparison. All paths lead to the same mountain top.

[16301-16340]
Singing yogi walked through city, completely liberated while shopping for vegetables.
Someone asked: "How do you maintain such realization in distraction?" He replied:
"What distraction? This market is my pure field. These vegetables are my teachers.
This bargaining is my practice." Liberation is not separate from life—it is life
recognized.

[16341-16380]
Thus the teaching on spontaneous results: not a reward for effort but recognition of
what never required effort. Not achievement but exhaustion of the need to achieve. Not
becoming Buddha but recognizing Samantabhadra as your own face. The Treasury
opens to reveal—not treasure outside, but your own nature as the treasure.

[16381-16420]
Final pointing: when you close this text, do not seek elsewhere. The fruit described
here is not in the next chapter or the next volume. It is in this very awareness reading
these words. Recognize this, and the entire Treasury becomes commentary on what you
already possess. Fail to recognize, and ten thousand explanations will not help.

[16421-16460]
Emaho! The wonder of spontaneous presence—lhun grub manifesting as everything,
ka-dag revealed in every moment. What need for further practice? What need for
additional study? Rest in this recognition, and the path is complete. The Supreme
Vehicle has carried you to the place you never left. The Jewel Treasure reveals itself
as your own heart, shining since before time began.

[16461-16500]
This old vagabond leaves you with what he received in a dream: liberation is not the
culmination of practice but its foundation. Build on sand, and even a palace falls. Build
on recognition, and a hut is complete. The fruit is not the end—it is the beginning seen
from the perspective of completion. Start here. End here. This is the whole teaching.

[16501-16540]
From Longchenpa's vast expanse to this wandering fool's directness, from the
Treasury's depths to the surface of these words—may recognition dawn. May the
exhaustion of confusion-ground reveal the ground that was never confused. May
spontaneous results manifest as what was never achieved. May all beings recognize
their nature as Samantabhadra, primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally
liberated.

[16541-16580]
One last secret, whispered by moonlight: the difference between path and fruit is the
difference between looking and seeing. Looking involves time, effort, direction. Seeing
is immediate, effortless, everywhere. You have been looking long enough. Now see.
See your own nature. See Dharmakaya. See what these words point to, and let the
words dissolve like morning mist.

[16581-16600]
Om ah hum. Blessings of the lineage. Blessings of the teachers. Blessings of the
practice. May all who encounter these words recognize their own nature. May
spontaneous presence manifest completely. May primordial purity be realized in this
very life. This is the prayer of this old fool, offered with empty hands and full heart.
