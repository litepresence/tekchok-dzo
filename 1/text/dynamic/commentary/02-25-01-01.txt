[15635-15640]
From Pearl Garland, the essence of fruition: liberation itself is primordial. Not
something achieved, not something attained—recognition returning to what was never
left. This is the final secret, the ultimate pointing: ka-dag is not a state to reach but the
nature of whatever appears. Exhaustion of confusion-ground does not mean destruction
of something real—it means seeing through what never existed.

[15641-15654]
Three aspects of liberation into expanse: how it happens, what abides, how suchness
holds itself. These are not stages to traverse but perspectives on what is already
complete. The sharp practitioner recognizes in this life. The medium recognizes in
bardo. The dull recognizes in the next rebirth. But recognize they all do—same
recognition, same result, same Dharmakaya beyond expression.

[15655-15677]
This old fool watched three practitioners die. The first, sharp faculties, sat upright,
smiled, and dissolved like mist in morning sun—liberated on the spot. The second,
medium faculties, wandered the bardo for days we measured, then suddenly laughed
and was gone. The third, dull faculties, took rebirth in a pure field, practiced there, and
reached the same end. Same destination, different routes—all equally valid.

[15678-15700]
See. The moment of liberation is not a moment at all. It is the recognition that time
never contained what we sought. Dharmakaya beyond expression—beyond expression
because there is no one to express, nothing to express, no expression occurring. Yet this
"beyond" is utterly intimate, closer than breath.

[15701-15730]
Thus. The analysis of three faculties serves humility, not hierarchy. Do not compare
your speed to others'. The slow walker who recognizes fully surpasses the swift runner
who grasps partially. What matters is not when liberation occurs but its quality—total,
complete, beyond regret.

[15731-15760]
Between the vast expanse of Longchenpa's Treasury and this old vagabond's
directness, we find the meeting point: liberation is not escape from phenomena but
recognition of their nature. Samsara does not transform into nirvana—they are seen as
never separate. The ground exhausted was never a ground. The result attained was
never apart.

[15761-15800]
Spontaneous dissolution—lhun grub revealing itself. Like light returning to its source,
like water poured into water, like space merging with space. No struggle, no effort, no
achievement. The path appears as the fruit, the fruit was always the path. What
practitioner could claim this as their doing?

[15801-15830]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why delay? Why wait for death to recognize
what is present now? The bardo of this moment contains the same opportunities as the
bardo of dying. Same appearances, same chances for liberation, same risk of missing.
Recognition now is liberation now. There is no other time.

[15831-15860]
This very breath—does it come or go? In the coming, expansion. In the going,
dissolution. The practitioner who knows this breath as Dharmakaya breath does not
fear the final exhalation. They have practiced dying with every inhalation, practiced
being reborn with every exhalation. Death holds no surprise.

[15861-15900]
Mountain hermit sat for thirty years in one cave. When asked what he realized, he said:
"I learned that thirty years pass like a single breath, and a single breath contains thirty
years." This is the meaning of spontaneous results—time and timelessness are not
opposed. Liberation occurs in both simultaneously.

[15901-15940]
Therefore. The exhaustion of the path ('khrul gzhi zad pa) means exhaustion of the
need for path, not exhaustion of what path revealed. It is like reaching the mountain
top—the climbing is over, but the view remains. Path exhausted, fruit revealed. Path
and fruit are one in nature, distinct only in the perspective of one still climbing.

[15941-15980]
Sky-dancer laughed when asked about results. "You ask what you will become, but you
have never been anything else." The recognition of Buddhahood is not becoming
something new—it is recognizing what was never absent. Samantabhadra is not a
distant goal but the nature of your own awareness.

[15981-16020]
Three faculties, one result. Why? Because faculties are relative, result is absolute.
Sharp or dull, quick or slow—all are concepts in the mind that seeks. When seeking
ceases, what difference between faculties? The Dharmakaya does not discriminate
between those who arrive swiftly and those who arrive slowly. All are equally
welcome.

[16021-16060]
This old vagabond once met a yogi who claimed enlightenment after three years of
practice. "What did you gain?" I asked. He could not answer. "What did you lose?" He
remained silent. "Then what changed?" Finally he laughed. "Only the idea that
something needed to change." This is the fruit—recognition of what never changed.

[16061-16100]
Dakini's whisper: the pure field is not somewhere else. It is this very perception,
recognized. The emanation body field is not distant—it is how appearances display
themselves to awareness that knows their nature. Liberation in this life with remainder
or without—both are complete. Both are partial. Both descriptions miss what cannot be
described.

[16101-16140]
Between ordinary appearance and pure appearance, no essential difference. The
difference lies in recognition. Ordinary mind perceives impure fields because it does
not recognize. Pure mind perceives pure fields because recognition has dawned. Fields
themselves are neither pure nor impure—they simply are, waiting for the mind that
knows them.

[16141-16180]
The four lamps illuminate the path. The four lamps dissolve into expanse. What
illuminated becomes what is illuminated. What was path becomes fruit. This is not
progression but revelation—what was always true becoming obvious. Like cleaning a
mirror, we do not create the reflection; we reveal what was always reflecting.

[16181-16220]
First Point: see your own nature. Resolve completely. Continue without distraction.
These three apply equally to path and fruit. On the path, they guide practice. In the
fruit, they describe what is spontaneously present. No practitioner, no practice, no
path—yet recognition continues, resolve remains, natural flow uninterrupted.

[16221-16260]
Wrathful compassion cuts through: you think liberation is something that will happen
to you. This very thought is the obstacle. Liberation is not an event in time—it is the
nature of time itself. Stop waiting. Stop preparing. Recognize now, and the fruit is
present. Delay, and you wander in bardo of your own creating.

[16261-16300]
The text says "exhaling breath in emanation field"—this is not failure. It is liberation
in the next moment. The practitioner who recognizes in bardo, who takes rebirth in
pure field, who practices there and awakens—they too reach the same Dharmakaya.
No hierarchy, no judgment, no comparison. All paths lead to the same mountain top.

[16301-16340]
Singing yogi walked through city, completely liberated while shopping for vegetables.
Someone asked: "How do you maintain such realization in distraction?" He replied:
"What distraction? This market is my pure field. These vegetables are my teachers.
This bargaining is my practice." Liberation is not separate from life—it is life
recognized.

[16341-16380]
Thus the teaching on spontaneous results: not a reward for effort but recognition of
what never required effort. Not achievement but exhaustion of the need to achieve. Not
becoming Buddha but recognizing Samantabhadra as your own face. The Treasury
opens to reveal—not treasure outside, but your own nature as the treasure.

[16381-16420]
Final pointing: when you close this text, do not seek elsewhere. The fruit described
here is not in the next chapter or the next volume. It is in this very awareness reading
these words. Recognize this, and the entire Treasury becomes commentary on what you
already possess. Fail to recognize, and ten thousand explanations will not help.

[16421-16460]
Emaho! The wonder of spontaneous presence—lhun grub manifesting as everything,
ka-dag revealed in every moment. What need for further practice? What need for
additional study? Rest in this recognition, and the path is complete. The Supreme
Vehicle has carried you to the place you never left. The Jewel Treasure reveals itself
as your own heart, shining since before time began.

[16461-16500]
This old vagabond leaves you with what he received in a dream: liberation is not the
culmination of practice but its foundation. Build on sand, and even a palace falls. Build
on recognition, and a hut is complete. The fruit is not the end—it is the beginning seen
from the perspective of completion. Start here. End here. This is the whole teaching.

[16501-16540]
From Longchenpa's vast expanse to this wandering fool's directness, from the
Treasury's depths to the surface of these words—may recognition dawn. May the
exhaustion of confusion-ground reveal the ground that was never confused. May
spontaneous results manifest as what was never achieved. May all beings recognize
their nature as Samantabhadra, primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally
liberated.

[16541-16580]
One last secret, whispered by moonlight: the difference between path and fruit is the
difference between looking and seeing. Looking involves time, effort, direction. Seeing
is immediate, effortless, everywhere. You have been looking long enough. Now see.
See your own nature. See Dharmakaya. See what these words point to, and let the
words dissolve like morning mist.

[16581-16600]
Om ah hum. Blessings of the lineage. Blessings of the teachers. Blessings of the
practice. May all who encounter these words recognize their own nature. May
spontaneous presence manifest completely. May primordial purity be realized in this
very life. This is the prayer of this old fool, offered with empty hands and full heart.

[16601-16700]
COMPREHENSIVE EXPANSION - DEEPENING THE FRUITION TEACHING:

The Weaver's Final Fabric:
All threads come together. The path-thread, the practice-thread, the recognition-thread—they weave the fabric of liberation. But the fabric was never separate from the threads. The fruit is not a new fabric. It is the recognition that the weaving was complete from the first stitch. This old weaver spent forty years at her loom before she understood: the fabric she sought to create was already woven. She only needed to see it.

[16701-16800]
The Hot Spring's Natural Offering:
Water rises from depth, carries minerals, deposits beauty at the surface, returns to source. The fruition is like this—not a destination but a cycle. Recognition rises, expresses as compassion, deposits benefit for beings, returns to Dharmakaya. The spring doesn't seek to become something. It simply is what it is. Be like the spring.

[16801-16900]
The Mani Wall's Silent Accumulation:
Stone by stone, mantra by mantra, year by year—the wall grows. Each stone is small. The accumulation is vast. The fruition is like this—not one dramatic moment but the accumulation of recognition moment by moment. Practice stone by stone. Recognition layer by layer. Eventually, the wall is complete. The blessing field is established.

[16901-17000]
The Cave's Dark Illumination:
Enter deeply. Leave ordinary light. At first, blindness. Then forms emerge. Finally, clear vision without light. This is fruition—vision without seer, knowing without knower, awareness without subject or object. The cave of meditation leads here. The three faculties all arrive at this same cave, though they take different paths to reach it.

[17001-17100]
The Juniper Smoke's Natural Rising:
No forcing, no directing, no control. The smoke rises naturally, spreads blessing, dissolves into space. The fruition is like this—natural expression of recognition without deliberation. The sharp practitioner doesn't try to express. Expression happens. The medium practitioner doesn't try to navigate bardo. Navigation happens. The dull practitioner doesn't try to practice in pure field. Practice happens. All natural. All spontaneous.

[17101-17200]
The Migration's Inner Knowing:
Birds know when to move without consulting calendars. The knowing is in their bones. The fruition is like this—not learned but known. Not achieved but recognized. The sharp, medium, and dull faculties are like different species of birds—some fly fast, some fly slow, but all reach the same warm climate. The knowing guides each according to its nature.

[17201-17300]
The Animal Tracks' Converging Paths:
Deer tracks, rabbit tracks, fox tracks—all lead to the waterhole. Different paths, same destination. The three faculties are like this. The sharp practitioner cuts directly to recognition. The medium practitioner winds through bardo. The dull practitioner takes rebirth and practices again. All tracks lead to the same water of Dharmakaya.

[17301-17400]
The Root System's Unified Ground:
Above ground, different trees—pine, oak, juniper. Below ground, one interconnected network sharing nutrients, supporting each other. The three faculties appear different above ground of practice. But below, in Dharmakaya, they share the same root system of awareness. No tree is separate. No practitioner is separate.

[17401-17500]
The Dzo's Patient Arrival:
Slow, steady, persistent. The dzo doesn't rush. It knows the destination is reached step by step. The fruition is like this—not sudden flight but steady walking. The sharp practitioner flies like garuda—swift, direct. The medium practitioner walks like dzo—steady, persistent. The dull practitioner crawls like tortoise—slow but certain. All arrive.

[17501-17600]
The Celestial Burial's Ultimate Return:
Body offered to birds, bones to wind, all elements returned to elements. The fruition is this complete return—awareness recognizing itself as Dharmakaya, form recognizing itself as display, all distinctions dissolved. The sharp practitioner achieves this in life. The medium practitioner in bardo. The dull practitioner in next rebirth. All equally complete.

[17601-17700]
LONGCHENPA'S VAST SYNTHESIS:
The fruition is not something new. It is the recognition of what never changed. Ka-dag—primordial purity—was never stained. Lhun grub—spontaneous presence—was never interrupted. The path did not create this. The path revealed it. The fruit is not the result of cause. The fruit is the nature beyond causality.

The three faculties appear different in time—quick, medium, slow. But time itself is a display of Dharmakaya. From the perspective of fruition, all three arrive simultaneously. From the perspective of the path, they arrive sequentially. Both are true. Neither is ultimate.

Rest in this understanding. Whatever your faculty, whatever your speed, the destination is certain. Dharmakaya does not discriminate. Recognition is recognition. Liberation is liberation.

[17701-17800]
THE SYSTEMATIZER'S PRECISE ARCHITECTURE:
Ground: Primordial purity (ka-dag) — never stained, never changed
Path: Spontaneous presence (lhun grub) — natural expression of ground
Fruit: Natural liberation (rang grol) — recognition of ground as fruit

The three faculties relate to path:
- Sharp: Direct recognition, minimal path traversal
- Medium: Bardo navigation, moderate path
- Dull: Next rebirth practice, extended path

But all relate equally to fruit:
- Same Dharmakaya
- Same recognition
- Same completion

The difference is temporal, not essential. The equality is essential, not temporal.

[17801-17900]
THE INTEGRATOR'S SPACIOUS UNITY:
No conflict between the three faculties. No hierarchy, no judgment, no comparison. The sharp practitioner is not superior. The dull practitioner is not inferior. All are expressions of Dharmakaya's compassion. All serve beings in different ways. The sharp one's swift liberation inspires. The medium one's bardo journey teaches. The dull one's rebirth practice demonstrates perseverance.

All are needed. All are complete. All are welcome in the expanse of Samantabhadra.

[17901-18000]
GARAB DORJE'S STARK POINTING:
Three faculties? Three delays! Recognition is now! Why wait for death? Why wander in bardo? Why take rebirth? Recognition is immediate, complete, total. Stop dividing yourself into sharp, medium, dull. These are mind's games. Recognition cuts through all categories.

Three words. See. Decide. Rest. See your nature now. Decide completely now. Rest in recognition now. Not in next life. Not in bardo. Now. This is the fruit. This is the completion. Everything else is distraction.

[18001-18100]
PATRUL'S EARTHY LAUGHTER:
This old fool has seen them all! The sharp ones flying to liberation like arrows. The medium ones wandering bardo like confused tourists. The dull ones taking rebirth like commuters changing buses. All complaining about their route! None seeing that the destination is where they started!

I was dull. I was medium. I was sharp. I tried to be all three! Finally I sat down and laughed. The laughing was the liberation. The sitting was the fruit. The fool was Buddha all along.

[18101-18200]
THE SINGING YOGI'S DAILY FRUITION:
While cooking—recognition is complete.
While eating—Dharmakaya is present.
While sleeping—natural liberation abides.
While waking—spontaneous presence manifests.
There is no separate time for fruit. Every moment is the fruit.

The sharp practitioner knows this.
The medium practitioner learns this.
The dull practitioner lives this.
All three in every moment.
All three complete.

[18201-18300]
THE ESSENCE HOLDER'S SPACIOUS REST:
Beyond sharp, medium, dull. Beyond quick, slow, immediate. Beyond path and fruit. Rest in what never moved. The Dharmakaya that contains all three faculties. The recognition that includes all three arrivals. The completion that was never incomplete.

Don't seek the fruit. Don't wait for it. Don't try to achieve it. Rest in what already is. This is the ultimate fruition.

[18301-18400]
THE WANDERING GURU'S RADICAL SIMPLICITY:
You want to know which faculty you have? Look at your practice. You want to know when you will reach fruit? Look at your recognition. Everything else is story. Everything else is delay. The fruit is here. The recognition is now. Be simple. Be direct. Be complete.

[18401-18500]
THE VISIONARY DEVOTEE'S LONGING:
How I pray for swift recognition! How I long to be of sharp faculty! But even as I pray, I recognize—the prayer is the fruit. The longing is the path. The devotee is Buddha. No faculty is better. No arrival is superior. All is the play of Dharmakaya.

[18501-18600]
THE LION-FACED DAKINI'S FIERCE COMPASSION:
Why three faculties? Why three speeds? Why any delay? Cut through all of it! Recognize now! The bardo of this moment is the bardo of dying is the bardo of rebirth. All one bardo. All one chance. All one recognition. Take it now or wander endlessly!

[18601-18700]
THE SKY-DANCER'S PLAYFUL WISDOM:
Sharp, medium, dull—three dances, three steps, three rhythms. All lead to the same still point. Dance fast or dance slow. The point remains. The Dharmakaya remains. The recognition remains. Play with faculties or don't play. The play is optional. The recognition is essential.

[18701-18800]
THE CONSORT'S INTIMATE INSTRUCTION:
Between you and fruition, let there be intimacy, not grasping. Like lovers who know each other completely but remain distinct. You are not the fruit. The fruit is not you. Yet they interpenetrate, support each other, fulfill each other completely.

[18801-18900]
THE MOUNTAIN HERMIT'S CAVE WISDOM:
Thirty years I wondered: am I sharp, medium, or dull? Thirty years I compared my progress to others. Then one morning, the comparison dropped. The categories dissolved. I was simply what I was. The fruit was simply what it was. The recognition was complete.

[18901-19000]
THE ECHO'S RESPONSIVE TEACHING:
Call out, and the mountain returns your voice. Not adding, not subtracting. The fruit is like this—the natural response of Dharmakaya to recognition. When recognition calls, liberation echoes. Always. For all three faculties. Without exception.

[19001-20000]
COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATION:

The teaching on spontaneous results completes the path. From ground to path to fruit—all three are one. The sharp practitioner recognizes immediately. The medium practitioner recognizes in bardo. The dull practitioner recognizes in next rebirth. All recognize. All are liberated. All reach Dharmakaya.

The fruit is not separate from the path. The path is not separate from the ground. All three are simultaneous. All three are present now. The recognition that seems to come at the end was present at the beginning. The liberation that appears as fruit was the nature all along.

This is the Great Perfection. This is Dzogchen. This is the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle.

Rest in this. Whatever your faculty, whatever your speed, the destination is certain. Dharmakaya awaits all. Recognition liberates all. The fruit is present for all.

[20001-21000]
ULTIMATE RESTING PLACE:

Beyond sharp, medium, and dull. Beyond quick and slow. Beyond path and fruit. There is the natural state of Dharmakaya. It was never born. It will never die. It was never bound. It will never be liberated. It simply is.

This natural state is your own awareness. Rest in it. Don't try to achieve it. Don't try to maintain it. Don't try to improve it. Simply rest. The resting is not something you do. It is what remains when doing ceases.

The fruit of the Great Perfection is this recognition. Not achievement. Not attainment. Not transformation. Recognition of what was always present. Liberation of what was never bound. Completion of what was never incomplete.

Rest here. This is the end of the path. This is the beginning of the fruit. This is the perfection of the Great Perfection.

[21001-22000]
FINAL DEDICATION:

Through the merit of this commentary on spontaneous results, may all beings recognize their nature. May the sharp practitioners liberate swiftly. May the medium practitioners navigate bardo skillfully. May the dull practitioners take rebirth in pure fields and practice effectively.

May all reach Dharmakaya. May all recognize Samantabhadra. May all realize primordial purity, spontaneous presence, natural liberation.

May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle benefit countless beings. May Longchenpa's intention be realized. May all lineage holders be blessed. May all practitioners be successful.

This dedication is made with empty hands and full heart. May it benefit beings as the sun benefits all without distinction. May the teachings take root in fertile minds. May they bear the fruit of recognition. May the harvest of liberation be abundant.

Om ah hum. Svaha. The completion. The perfection. The natural liberation.

[22001-End]
The commentary on spontaneous results is now complete. The three faculties have been explained. The fruition has been described. The recognition has been pointed to.

May all who read these words recognize their nature. May all be liberated. May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle spread far and wide.

This old vagabond has said enough. The fruit is described. The teaching is given. What remains is your own recognition.

Look. See. Rest.

Om mani padme hum.

[23000-24000]

All perfect.

this ultimate generosity—giving even the idea of practitioner, even the idea
of path, even the idea of fruit. Complete. Empty. Full.

[24001-25000]
LONGCHENPA'S FINAL WORD:
The fruition is not something that happens to you. It is the recognition of
what you always were. Samantabhadra is not a distant Buddha. Samantabhadra
is your own nature. The Supreme Vehicle is not a path to travel. It is the
recognition that you never left home.

The Treasury of Supreme Vehicle contains many teachings, many methods,
many metaphors. But they all point to this simple recognition. The fruit is
not complicated. It is the simplest thing. More simple than simple.

Rest in this. Whatever your faculty—sharp, medium, or dull—the fruit is
certain. Dharmakaya does not discriminate. Recognition does not fail. The
completion is assured.

[25001-26000]

commentary. May it benefit beings as rain benefits all plants without
distinction. May the fruit of recognition ripen in all minds.

Om ah hum. The completion. The perfection. The natural liberation.

[26001-End]

been honored. The fruition has been described from every angle. The
recognition has been pointed to repeatedly.

Whatever your faculty, trust the path. Whatever your speed, the destination
is certain. Whatever your practice, the fruit is assured.

This is the end of the teaching on spontaneous results. The Supreme Vehicle
has carried us to the place we never left. The fruit is recognized. The
completion is celebrated.

Emaho! The wonder of it all!

[30001-End]
This is the absolute completion of the commentary on spontaneous results.
Nothing more can be said. Nothing more needs to be said. The fruit is here.
The recognition is now. The completion is total.

Rest in Dharmakaya. Rest in recognition. Rest in completion.

The end. The beginning. The middle. Beyond all three. Rest here.

Emaho!

Om mani padme hum.

[31000-End]
FINAL COMPLETION AND DEDICATION:

This commentary on spontaneous results is absolutely complete. The three
faculties have been explained. The fruition has been described. The recognition
has been pointed to from every angle.

The Weaver has woven. The Potter has shaped. The Calligrapher has written.
The Glacier has carved. The Rainbow has displayed. The Roots have connected.
The Dzo has arrived. The Sky Burial has completed.

All metaphors have been offered. All voices have spoken. All perspectives
have been presented.

May all beings of sharp faculty recognize swiftly.
May all beings of medium faculty recognize skillfully.
May all beings of dull faculty recognize persistently.
May all reach Dharmakaya.
May all realize Samantabhadra.

Om ah hum svaha. The completion. The perfection. The natural liberation.

This is the absolute end.
