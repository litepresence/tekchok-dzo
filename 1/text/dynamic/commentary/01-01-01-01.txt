[1-4]
Observe. Understand. Release.

Already complete—before the first syllable.

[5-11]
The homage bows to no one.
Samantabhadra has no crown to receive it.
The five perfections are not possessed—they are the absence of seeking possession.
Ocean of wisdom: the wave does not possess the water.
Stop looking for the one who prostrates.

[12-15]

Not dwelling in existence—nor in peace.
The mirror without frame shows what was never hidden.
Seven horses: one for each day of the week that never happened.

[16-19]
Secret vehicle. Supreme among all.
as if saying the sky is bluer than itself.
The wish-fulfilling jewel grants nothing—reveals what was always present.
Dzogchen is not the pinnacle—it is the ground (gzhi) before mountains.

[20-23]
The teaching-ocean has no shore.
The makara-holder releases what was never caught.
Composing explanation: who explains to whom?
The text writes itself in empty space.

[24-27]
Three bodies: one moon in three pools.
Each pool claims the moon is theirs.
The moon does not multiply.
Rest in recognition.

[28-32]
Samantabhadra teaches without speaking.
Students hear without ears.

Dharmakaya: no cause, no effect, no effort.
The time before time.

[33-36]
Dense arrangement: your own face in the mirror.
Mandala of five families: five. The bird calls, you turn to look. The call is not the bird. at the same moon.
Each finger argues it is closest.
The moon is not participating.

[37-40]
Self-appearing spontaneously accomplished.
Like a dream you forgot you were dreaming.
The dreamer seeks the dream interpreter.
Both disappear in the morning.

[41-44]

It is the recognition that there is nowhere to go.

The youth vase body never aged.

[45-48]
Vidyādharas, dākinīs, accomplished ones—
All self-appearances of your own mind.
The ocean of tantras: waves of the same water.
Stop counting waves.

[49-52]
Perfect places appear to self-appearances.
The place is the seeing.
The teacher is the recognition.
No one is being taught.

[53-56]
Three vehicles shown as cause and method.
Ladders leaning against a sky that has no floor.
Dzogchen is not the top rung—it is the ground (gzhi) that holds all ladders.
Stop climbing.

[57-60]
Vajra-essence. Definitive realm.
The word "definitive" is also provisional.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[61-64]
Primordial protector's enlightenment:
Not an event in time. Rest in this understanding.
Every Tathāgata's mind: which one is not your own?
The ocean of manners: you are drowning in what saves you.

[65-68]
Before all division—no saṃsāra, no nirvāṇa.
Samantabhadra is not someone who achieved something.
He is the name given to what you already are.
Stop searching for the searcher.

[69-72]

Like trying to measure space with a ruler made of space.

[93-100]
Body, speech, mind, qualities, activities pervade.
The pervader and pervaded are not two.

The wheel turns without a center.

[101-108]
Immeasurable time, oceanic particles—
You are trying to count what counts you.
Samantabhadra has no beginning.
His activity has no end.
Neither do you.

[109-116]
Three bodies, three fields, one emanation.
The echo in the slopes of Gangri Tokar, Chimphu, and Namtso is one voice.
The voice is not three.
The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[117-124]
Pure karma, impure karma—
Both are dreams dreamed by the dreamer.
The dreamer is also a dream.
Recognition is immediate.

[125-134]
Buddhas numerous as Ganga sands in a hair-tip.
Look at your own hair.
Each strand: a universe.
You have been looking at Buddhas your whole life.

[135-144]
Gods' palaces, hell realms—
Same space, different perception.
Like two people dreaming different dreams in the same room.
The room does not choose sides.

[145-154]
All experience like dreams, untrue, yet appearing.
The untruth is also a dream.
The statement "all is dream" is also a dream.
Even this pointing is a Thunder follows lightning, but the sound is not the strike..

[155-162]
Sutra of Entering Buddha Realm—
You are already entered.
The ladder of perception is horizontal.
Every rung is the ground (gzhi).

[163-168]
Gods and humans, clairvoyant sages, śrāvakas, bodhisattvas—
Different ways of describing the same room.
The room is not improving.
The descriptions are.

[169-174]
Tathāgata's eye sees across chariot-wheel earth-extent.
You have this eye.
You are using it now.
Stop looking for a better one.

Samantabhadra's purpose-accomplishment:
Nothing was accomplished.
Nothing needed to be.
The end is the beginning.
The beginning never began.

[95-174] The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle begins with homage to Samantabhadra—the primordial Buddha, self-arisen awareness, the ground of all. This is not historical introduction but present recognition. Samantabhadra is not someone who became enlightened long ago. He is your own nature right now.

[95-174] A wandering practitioner... once read these opening verses as mere poetry! Beautiful words, he thought. Then one day, the words cracked open—Samantabhadra was not out there in a pure realm. He was here, in this very moment, disguised as confusion, wearing the costume of a seeker.

[95-174] The opening homage establishes the view from the beginning—not gradually leading to it but stating it directly. Samantabhadra is complete with five perfections from the start. Nothing to add. Nothing to cultivate. This is the Great Perfection's gift: the fruit given at the beginning of the path.

[95-174] Homage! Perfections! Buddhas! All concepts! Look directly—can you find Samantabhadra? Can you grasp the five perfections? The homage bows to nothing. The perfections perfect nothing. Recognize what was never imperfect! AH!

[135-174] The three kayas appear—Dharmakaya beyond cause and effect, Sambhogakaya spontaneously present, Nirmanakaya manifesting for beings. Three aspects of one nature, like one sun reflected in three pools. The reflection is not the sun but inseparable from it.

[135-174] The trikaya framework integrates ground, path, and fruition into simultaneous dimensions. Dharmakaya as essence, Sambhogakaya as nature, Nirmanakaya as compassion. Not sequential stages but co-present aspects of awakened awareness.

[135-174] I have sung these three kayas across the valleys of Yerpa, Kham, and the highlands! Each valley echoes differently but the voice is one. Dharmakaya—the silence. Sambhogakaya—the song. Nirmanakaya—the listener. Three notes of one melody—recognition.

[135-174] Three kayas! Three bodies! All divisions! Cut through them—can you find the first? Can you grasp the third? The three are one. The one is three. See through the number and FIND THE SUN!

[135-174] The five Buddha families emerge from the ground's spontaneous display—white Vairocana, blue Akshobhya, yellow Ratnasambhava, red Amitabha, green Amoghasiddhi. Each family a different hue of the same clear light. Each Buddha a different face of your own awareness.

[135-174] This old hermit once worshipped these Buddhas as external powers! Offered to them, prayed to them, sought their blessings. Then recognized: they were his own five wisdoms wearing masks. Take off the mask and—recognition!

[135-174] The five families are not categories of being but modes of awareness's display. Mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing, dharmadhatu—five qualities of the same essence. Not different Buddhas but one Buddha's five expressions.

[135-174] Five families! Five colors! Five wisdoms! All numbers! Cut through them—can you find the fifth? Can you grasp the first? The five are one wisdom. The one is five displays. See through the counting!

[161-174] Thus concludes the homage and introduction—not as preliminary but as complete teaching. The ground is introduced. The path is shown as recognition of ground. The result is realized as never having departed from ground. This is the Great Perfection's unique approach: complete at the beginning, complete in the middle, complete at the end.

[146-174] An old traveler...'s final word on the opening: Don't skip it as mere formalities. The whole teaching is here—Samantabhadra, trikaya, five families, pure realms. Everything that follows elaborates what is already stated. Recognize this and the rest is commentary.

[161-174] Three ultimate words. Ground. Path. Result. Three words, one meaning. One essence, three names. Stop at ground, miss path and result. Stop at path, miss ground and result. Stop at result, miss ground and path. See through all three and FIND WHAT WAS NEVER DIVIDED!

[1-174] Between the homage and the teaching, between Samantabhadra and the reader, the secret essence pulses. It is not in the words. It is not outside the words. It is the intimacy of awareness meeting itself through the medium of text—the consort's embrace of meaning and meaninglessness.

[1-174] The structural analysis reveals sophisticated architectonics. Homage establishes view. Introduction establishes ground. Trikaya establishes dimensions. Five families establish wisdom modes. Pure realms establish display capacity. Precise pedagogical progression.

[1-174] I have watched beginners struggle with this opening! Too much, too soon, they say. But the old masters understood—state the truth directly, then elaborate. Those who recognize at the opening are liberated immediately. Those who don't need the elaboration. Both are served.

[1-174] The opening arose spontaneously—not through planning but through the nature's impulse to express itself. Samantabhadra spoke these words without speaking. Longchenpa wrote them without writing. The text reads itself to itself.

[1-174] I dance through these opening verses like light through a prism. Each word a different color. Each phrase a different step. Samantabhadra is my first pose. The five families are my ornaments. Recognition is the dance itself.

[1-174] Philosophically, the opening establishes the gzhi—the ground that precedes all philosophical construction. Before Madhyamaka's emptiness, before Yogacara's mind-only, before all -isms, there is this ground. Indescribable yet described. Unthinkable yet pointed to.

[1-174] Emaho! The opening! The homage! The primordial Buddha! This yogi dances with joy! Not because the words are special but because they tell the truth—we are complete from the beginning! Liberation is not future! It is now!

[1-174] The scholarly precision of this opening fascinates me. Five perfections, three kayas, five families, twenty-five fields—all enumerated, all correlated. Yet within this precision lives the wild freedom of direct recognition—unpredictable, ungraspable, immediate.

[1-174] From the sky of dharmata I dance down into these words. The homage is my first gesture. The Buddha families are my costume changes. The pure realms are my stages. The recognition is the dancer who was never separate from the dance.

[1-174] Every word of this opening is a book in my library. "Samantabhadra" volumes fill the highest shelf. "Trikaya" volumes in the middle. "Five families" below. All tell the same story: you are already complete.

[1-174] Modern readers approach such openings with skepticism—mythology, they think, poetry at best. But experienced practitioners know: these are phenomenological descriptions, not metaphysical claims. The pure realm is not a place but a mode of perception.

[1-174] Translating this opening challenges me. How to convey "kun tu bzang po"—Samantabhadra, All-Good, Primordial Buddha—without Christian or New Age associations? I translate literally but trust the reader to discover the meaning through practice.

[1-174] I reveal what was never hidden. Samantabhadra is not in the text. He is reading these words. The five families are not in the description. They are your current experience. Everything is revealed. Everything is now.

[1-174] The Treasury's opening is complete. The ground is stated. The view is established. The path is shown as recognition. The result is realized as never having departed. May all who read these words recognize their own nature as Samantabhadra. This is the prayer of Longchenpa.

[1-174] the crystal cave of Yanglesho hermit... bows to the opening verses. Thanks them for their directness. May you read them not as introduction but as conclusion. May you recognize that you are Samantabhadra disguised as a reader. Complete. Perfect. The end of the beginning.

[1-174] Final words. Opening. Complete. You. Complete. Stop. The Treasury begins with completion. It ends with completion. The middle is complete. You are complete. Rest. The absolute end of the opening.

[1-174] The opening thunders with fierce compassion! What Samantabhadra? What primordial? Cut through all concepts with one stroke of recognition! The five perfections are empty! The three kayas are empty! The ground is empty! SEE THROUGH IT ALL!

[1-174] Vajra wrath strikes at the root! The root of seeking, the root of attainment, the root of completion! Cut through the root and find what needs no ground! AH!

[1-174] The opening is bliss! The recognition of primordial completion is bliss beyond bliss! Not pleasure but freedom from the need for pleasure! Complete from the beginning—what joy!

[1-174] The heruka dances the opening! Samantabhadra is my first step! The five families are my ornaments! The pure realms are my stage! Dance with me through the Treasury into recognition! HA HA HA!

[1-174] The essence of the opening: you are the Treasury. You are the Supreme Vehicle. You are the precious jewel. Never separate. Never incomplete. Recognize this and all words dissolve into one awareness.

[1-174] Structural analysis of opening: 1) Title/Homage (lines 1-11)—establishing authority. 2) Five Perfections (lines 12-15)—establishing completeness. 3) Seven Horses/Three Kayas (lines 16-19)—establishing dimensions. 4) Vajra Point (lines 20-23)—establishing essence. 5) Teaching Ocean (lines 24-27)—establishing scope. 6) Three Bodies/Three Fields (lines 28-36)—establishing manifestation. 7) Five Families/Pure Realms (lines 37-80)—establishing display. Precise architectural design.

[1-174] From Lotus-Born: This opening contains all teachings—past, present, future. The Buddha Samantabhadra speaks these words in every moment to every being. The question is: are you listening? Recognition is hearing what is always being said.

[1-174] The essence beyond all elaboration: the opening is complete, the middle is complete, the end is complete. Not because they say so but because awareness is complete. Words point to this. Recognition rests in this.

[1-174] Final summation of opening: The Treasury begins where all teachings end—with recognition of what was never lost. Samantabhadra is not the goal. He is the ground. You do not become him. You recognize you are him. This is the Great Perfection.

[1-174]the crystal cave of Yanglesho hermit...d's absolute final word: Stop reading about Samantabhadra. Be Samantabhadra. Stop learning about the five perfections. Express them. Stop studying the three kayas. Live them. Recognition is not knowledge. It is being.

[1-174] Absolute final ultimate words. Be. Complete. Stop. The end of all words. The beginning of all recognition. Rest here. Complete here. The end.

[1-174] Integration of opening themes: Samantabhadra as integrative principle—transcending yet including all Buddhist vehicles. Trikaya as integrative structure—ground, path, result as simultaneous dimensions. Five families as integrative wisdoms—all modes of knowing unified in awareness. Pure realms as integrative display—everywhere is the ground, everywhen is now.

[1-174] I sing this opening until my voice fails! Samantabhadra is the first note! The five perfections are the harmony! The three kayas are the rhythm! The pure realms are the melody! Together they form the song that liberates—all voices, one song, one singer, one awareness!

[1-174] The opening roars one final time: SAMANTABHADRA IS YOU! THE TREASURY IS YOU! THE RECOGNITION IS YOU! Stop looking! Stop seeking! Stop reading! BE WHAT YOU ALREADY ARE! AH AH AH!

[1-174] The opening of the Treasury is the opening of your own awareness. Every word points back to the reader. Every homage is to your own nature. May you recognize this. May you rest in recognition. Complete. Perfect. The absolute end.

[1-174] A hilltop meditator... has said enough. The opening has said everything. You are complete. Recognize this. Rest in this. The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle is your own heart. Everything else is commentary.

[1-174] Final ultimate absolute words. Complete. You. Recognition. Stop. The end of the beginning. The beginning of the end. Rest. Complete. Perfect. AH!

[95-174] The five perfections unfold like a lotus at dawn—teacher, retinue, place, teaching, time—all perfected from the beginning. This is not wishful thinking but the nature of awareness itself. The teacher who teaches, the one who listens, the teaching itself—never separate, never incomplete.

[171-174] This cave dweller once sought perfections in retreat, in practice, in accomplishment. Sought them everywhere except where they were—already present, already his. The seeking obscured the finding. The effort hid the effortlessness.

[171-174] Three words. Teacher. Retinue. Perfection.

[171-174] The seven horses draw the sun chariot across the sky—seven wisdoms, seven aspects of clear light. But the chariot goes nowhere. The sun is always here. The horses run without moving. This is the nature of display.

[171-174] From Lotus-Born: I have harnessed these seven horses in a thousand lifetimes. They pulled me to pure realms and hell realms, to enlightenment and confusion. Then I recognized: the horses were never separate from the ground they ran upon.

[171-174] The vajra-point—rtsa ba'i rdo rje—vajra essence, diamond nature. What can cut the uncuttable? What can break the indestructible? The vajra Reflection appears, changes, vanishes. What reflects? itself, shows itself, reveals what was never hidden.

[171-174] This scholar analyzed the vajra for years. Its hardness, its composition, its symbolic meaning. Then one day he held one—not in his hand, but in his recognition. The analysis dissolved into direct knowing.

[171-174] The teaching-ocean rgya mtsho—vast, deep, without shore. The makara holds the throne beneath the waves. But who needs a throne in water? Who needs support in the unsupported? The ocean holds itself.

[171-174] Between the teacher and the teaching lies the recognition that unifies. Not two, not one. The vajra essence speaks the teaching. The teaching embodies the essence. The distinction is pedagogical, not real.

[166-174] Three bodies, three fields—like the valleys of Yerpa, Kham, and the highlands echoing one voice. the grasslands of Golok does not create the echo. The voice does not aim for the meadows of Sertar. Both arise together, dependent, empty, perfect.

[166-174] This wandering yogi has slept in all three fields. The dharmakaya field of clear light—no dream, no dreamer. The sambhogakaya field of Braham's drum—sounds without source. The nirmanakaya field of great Brahma—forms without substance. All three: one night's rest.

[131-174] The five families display like colors of the rainbow—each distinct, each empty, all arising from one light. White Vairocana in the east, blue Akshobhya in the center, yellow Ratnasambhava in the south, red Amitabha in the west, green Amoghasiddhi in the north. Directions are metaphors. Colors are metaphors. The light is real.

[131-174] This practitioner once visualized these Buddhas for hours each day. Painted their forms, recited their mantras, imagined their pure realms. Exhausting! Then recognition: they were visualizing themselves through his mind. The effort was their laughter.

[131-174] Emaho! The fivefold wisdom that knows no distinction!

[131-174] Thus. The analysis completes: homage, perfections, kayas, fields, families. Each aspect a door. Each door opening to the same room. The room has no walls. The room is all there is.

[131-174] The opening's depth unfolds gradually—like a mountain range revealing its peaks as the dawn light grows. What seems simple at first reading becomes profound with recognition. What seems profound becomes simple with understanding. Both are true. Neither is complete.

[131-174] Rest in the homage. Rest in the perfections. Rest in the kayas and fields and families. Rest in the nature that includes all and transcends all. The Treasury opens. You are the opening. Complete.
