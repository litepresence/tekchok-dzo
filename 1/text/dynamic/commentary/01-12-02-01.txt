Twenty-five wisdom channels, five gathering channels. Two mind channels. The third wheel will be explained. Five bindu channels, eight prajna channels, two ignorance channels, fifteen gathering channels, five light-ray channels, element channels likewise.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Two are empty channels.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. The first wheel will be explained: five awareness channels, five body channels—each having two. Ten gathering channels, three phlegm channels, two wind channels, two bile channels. The rest are gathering. Four light and wisdom channels are called actual things.

[66-87]
The second wheel is thus: twenty-five wisdom channels are five dharmadhatu wisdoms. Mirror-like is likewise equal. Five are equality wisdom. Likewise five discriminating, five all-accomplishing. Five gathering channels are the five abiding elements.

 From two mind channels: wind and consciousness abiding. The third wheel explained: five bindu channels—two conventional bindus, two awareness bindus, one wisdom bindu.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Eight prajna channels: two discern, two gather, two liberate, the rest maintain. Two ignorance channels self-place press. Fifteen gathering channels: four phlegm-mind, five delusion-bile, four anger-wind, two desire-gathering. Five light-ray channels: base light-ray, path light-ray one, the rest eye light-ray.

[88-111]
From the citta jewel palace, three wheels possessing channel leaves ninety-six. Rest in this understanding.

The path IS the ground! Never walked! Immediate recognition! Why seek elsewhere?

Do not make this into philosophy, dear practitioner! These channels, these wheels, these bindus—they are your very body. Press, recite, release—this is the path of subtle body. Balance the elements, and liberation is at hand.

[112-123]
Look here! These channels—some have water-yellow essence, some blood essence, some wind and earth elements, some five elements' essence. Each one has essences dwelling in sequence! Wind and bindu dwelling—each channel has one of each. These spreading as wind, merely dwelling in form. Do you see? It's all the play of essences, practitioner! Water, blood, wind, earth—your body is a mandala of elements!

[124-136]
Their function and enumeration—from the dharma wheel's petals: five go upward, vitality radiance and wisdom sending. Five go left, prajna flow and sense faculties holding. Five dwell in joints and center, secret continuity's basis. Five dwell in directions and center, arising-sending and setting-gathering. Thus channel forms—two existent secret channels. [text continues]

Do you see the pattern? Up, left, center, joints, directions—channels weave through your body like threads in a fabric! And who weaves? No weaver! Just wisdom-display! Emaho!

[237-244]
Ha! You think you know this body, practitioner? Cut here—liver diseases flee. That short rut inside—the kha kha small heat channel—cut it for phlegm. Dza at the bile corner of the elbow—that's the right upper channel—cut for lung disease. Left side too, dza dwells—the left upper channel—yellow phlegm flees. Don't you see? These points aren't anatomy—they're where your energy knots itself into delusion!

[245-252]
Listen here, dear practitioner! These channels are not for cutting with knives! Cutting this benefits all liver diseases. In the short rut of that, dwells the kha kha small heat channel—cut it for phlegm disease.

 At the bile corner of the elbow dwells dza, called the right upper channel—cut it for lung disease. At the left also dwells dza, the left upper channel—cut thus for yellow phlegm.

[253-269]
Center back of the knee—ta dwells straight—back channel neck completion—cut for upper body disease. Between thumb and forefinger, one tsen span—Ta dwells—heart channel white woman—cut for kidney, bile, heart. Straight center back, tha dwells—great back channel—back taste disease flees. Little toe's outer corner, da dwells—liver channel hron bu—hand disease. Big toe's back straight, dha dwells—bile channel ghan dhe—head disease. All these doors in your very flesh!

[270-286]
At the center back of the knee, ta dwells straight—called the back channel neck completion—cut it for upper body disease. Between the thumb and forefinger of the hand, at the span of one tsen, dwells Ta—called the heart channel white woman—cut it for kidney, bile, and heart diseases.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Straight at the center back, tha dwells—called the great back channel—cut it for back taste disease.

 At the outer corner of the little toe, da dwells—called the liver channel hron bu—cut it for hand disease. Straight at the back of the big toe, dha dwells—called the bile channel ghan dhe—cut it for head disease.

[273-287]
Middle finger's back, na dwells—stomach branch—poison flees. Ring finger's back, ta dwells—spleen branch—spleen disease. Ring finger back straight, tsa dwells—kidney crooked channel—kidney disease. Little toe's back, da—the male crooked channel—male disease. Palm center, dha dwells—black liver channel—male liver disease. This is your body, fool! Not meat and bone—the mandala itself! See through the knot and recognize! Emaho!

[273-287]
At the back of the middle finger, na dwells—called the stomach branch—cut it for poison disease. At the back of the ring finger, ta dwells—called the spleen branch—cut it for spleen disease. Straight at the back of the ring finger, tsa dwells—called the kidney crooked channel—cut thus for kidney disease.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. At the back of the little toe, da letter exists—called the male crooked channel—cut it for male disease.

 At the center of the palm, dha letter dwells—called the black liver channel—cut it for male liver disease. These are not medical instructions, dear one! They point to where your energy knots! Recognize the knot and it unravels itself! Emaho!

[281-287]
By this, benefit comes to that illness. Yogis accomplish by pressing. These are the key syllables summarized. The rest have no benefit or harm. Pressing, shaking, and drawing—the yogi should know these.

Listen! The throat chakra—the wheel of enjoyment. Here speech becomes mantra, voice becomes vajra song. Press the channels, shake the elements, draw the winds—this is the yogi's play.

[287-287]
Third, the throat enjoyment wheel—from four: first, generally showing the numbers. This is the treasury's heart.

While walking, cooking, singing the distinction dissolves into the song. Who was making distinctions? Just sunlight on frost.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[1-287] The Treasury's extensive presentation of channels, wheels, and bindus is complete. These form the subtle body—the vessel for recognition. The heart wheel, the throat wheel, the channels and their essences—all descriptions of your own energetic anatomy. May practitioners recognize their body as the mandala.

[1-287] In a freezing cave... has pressed these points! Felt the channels open, the winds move, the essences flow. Not theory—direct experience. The body is the path. The channels are the road. Recognition is the destination. Press, recite, release—this is the practice.

[1-287] The three wheels are the three kayas in your body. Heart wheel—dharmakaya. Throat wheel—sambhogakaya. Crown wheel—nirmanakaya. The channels are the path between them. The winds are the messengers. The bindus are the nourishment. Recognition is the king who rules all.

[1-287] Channels! Wheels! Bindus! All anatomy! Cut through it! Can you find the channel that flows? Can you grasp the wheel that turns? They are awareness's display! AH!

[1-287] Three words. Channel. Wheel. Bindu. Stop. Three aspects of one body. Three descriptions of one awareness. Stop dividing. Rest in one.

[1-287] Therefore. Thus. Channel system: three wheels (heart, throat, crown), five channels per wheel, twenty-five wisdom channels total. Each with specific location, function, and essence. Precise subtle anatomy for completion stage practice.

[1-287] The integration of channels, winds, and bindus: channels are the pathways, winds are the travelers, bindus are the sustenance. Integration means all three function together as one system of recognition.

[1-287] The essence of channels: they are awareness's pathways. The essence of wheels: they are awareness's centers. The essence of bindus: they are awareness's drops. All essence, all awareness, all recognition.

[1-287] Emaho! The channels! The wheels! The bindus! What complexity! What beauty! This yogi dances through the channels, spins the wheels, melts the bindus! Liberation in the body!

[1-287] Thus concludes the presentation of subtle body channels. May all who practice these teachings recognize their body as the mandala of enlightenment. May they master the channels and winds through recognition. Complete.

[14528-148One who walked paths...bond's final teaching: Don't get lost in the anatomy. The channels are not the goal. The wheels are not the destination. Recognition is. Feel the channels. Know the wheels. Then recognize what feels and knows. Complete.

[1-287] Final words. Channels. Wheels. Recognize. Stop. The teaching on subtle body is complete. The body is complete. You are complete. Rest. The end.
