Three channels. Three essences. One body. This is not anatomy for scholars—it is the
living map of how bliss awakens. Roma, kyangma, kundarma—these are not tubes to be
dissected but doorways to be entered. The old practitioners knew: follow the breath, find
the channel, discover what was never hidden.

[13847-13850]
Roma—right, solar, desire's wisdom. They call it "taste" because it draws the essence
from all experience, like salt draws flavor from soup. Without it, no bliss. With it, the
risk of attachment. This is the razor's edge where practitioners stumble—chasing the
sensation rather than knowing the knower of sensation.

[13851-13900]
This old fool once spent three years trying to force his winds into the central channel.
Every morning, rigid posture, strained breathing, determination worthy of a warrior. One
dawn, exhausted, he collapsed—and in that collapse, the channels opened themselves.
Not his doing. Never was. The body knows what the mind forgets.

[13901-13950]
Look at what Longchenpa reveals here. The three channels are not merely physical
structures—they are the architecture of how primordial purity manifests as experience.
Roma carries the red essence, kyangma the white, kundarma the union. But do not
solidify these into things. They are luminous appearances in the clear light body, as
substantial as rainbows, as functional as the ground beneath your feet.

[13951-14000]
Four knots. Four gates. Four obstacles that are also openings. At the navel—birth and
the vital essence that generates form. At the heart—memory and the red essence that
sustains life. At the throat—taste and the wind-essence that distinguishes pure from
impure. At the crown—mind itself, the white essence where consciousness and
luminosity meet. Cut these knots, and what binds becomes what liberates.

[14001-14050]
See. Decide. Return. Three words, three channels, three wisdoms. The seeing is not
visual—it is the direct recognition of how bliss arises from emptiness and returns to
emptiness. The deciding is not intellectual—it is the resolve to stop seeking completion
outside. The returning is not repetitive—it is the natural settling of what was never
agitated.

[14051-14100]
This very hesitation—does it have a location? Search in the right channel, find
movement without a mover. Search in the left, find essence without an owner. Search
in the center, find union without duality. The search itself dissolves what was sought,
revealing the searcher was never separate from the finding.

[14101-14150]
Mountain hermit sat by frozen stream for nine winters, watching ice form and melt.
One spring morning, he noticed: the water does not struggle to find its channels. The
earth does not resist the river's carving. Channels are not made—they are discovered,
like paths through snow that reveal where travelers already walked.

[14151-14200]
Therefore. The analysis of three channels serves recognition, not cultivation. When you
understand roma as the wisdom of discernment, kyangma as the wisdom of mirror-like
clarity, kundarma as the wisdom of all-accomplishing action, you see the classification
dissolves into direct experience. Structure becomes spontaneity.

[14201-14250]
Between the spacious unity of the Integrator and the earthy humor of the Vagabond,
we find the vast middle way of channels. Not rejecting the body as impure, not grasping
bliss as attainment. The ocean holds all currents while remaining undisturbed. The
body's subtle channels are waves on the ocean of primordial awareness—distinct in
form, inseparable in essence.

[14251-14300]
What waits for tomorrow's meditation? Tomorrow never arrives. This knot at the navel—
feel it now. Not through effort, but through recognition. The vital essence that generates
form is the same essence that recognizes form as empty. No separation between
generator and generated, between path and fruition.

[14301-14350]
Dakini's whisper in moonlight: these channels are secret because they cannot be told,
not because they are hidden. Speak of roma to one who has not tasted thigle-bliss, and
words become concepts. Speak to one who has rested in non-dual awareness, and
silence becomes transmission. The secret protects itself—only recognition receives it.

[14351-14400]
In the palace of channels, three main doorways lead to innumerable chambers. The
right channel—roma, the taste-channel, carries the red bindu of passion transformed.
It moves from navel to secret place, winding like a river that knows its course without
map. Do not follow it with mind—follow it with the knowing that precedes mind.

[14401-14450]
This old man watched a yogi demonstrate channel control—stopping breath,
redirecting winds, displaying mastery. Impressive. But the true master breathes without
knowing breath, channels open without direction, bliss arises without seeking. The
display is for others. The reality is transparent, like water in water.

[14451-14500]
Kyungma, the left channel, straight and singular. They call it "alone" because it carries
the white essence of method—single, unchanging, the ground from which all
appearance arises. From it comes the ultimate arising and the relative maturation. It
does not transform because it is transformation itself.

[14501-14550]
Recognition dawns: the channels described here are not foreign territory to be
conquered but home ground to be remembered. Every practitioner who has sat in
darkness, every yogi who has found light in the body's center—they are pointing to
what you already possess. The map is not the territory, but the territory has never been
lost.

[14551-14600]
Kundarma, the central channel, gathering all. Not right, not left, not compromise
between extremes—beyond position entirely. Here the winds settle when the mind
ceases its chatter. Here the thigle dissolves when grasping releases. Here the
unconditioned reveals itself as the basis of all conditioning.

[14601-14650]
Sky-dancer laughed when asked about channel locations. "You seek them in the body,
but they dance in space. You measure them in fingers' width, but they span the
cosmos." Yet she also said: "Sit properly, breathe naturally, and the channels reveal
themselves—neither in the body nor outside it."

[14651-14700]
The four knots are not problems to be solved but stations on a journey already
complete. Navel knot—generation. Heart knot—sustaining. Throat knot—refining.
Crown knot—liberation. Each contains the others. Each leads to the others. The journey
is circular, the path is the destination, the knots are already untied in primordial purity.

[14701-14750]
At the navel, father's white essence, bright as mercury, seed of all form. At the heart,
mother's red essence, holding memory of all becoming. These are not philosophical
concepts—they are the living tissue of your embodiment. Touch the navel with
awareness, and touch the origin of manifestation. Touch the heart, and touch the
wisdom that outlives all forms.

[14751-14800]
This very channel system—does it exist for the realized? The question itself assumes
a duality between realized and unrealized that channels transcend. In ka-dag, channels
are primordially pure. In lhun-grub, channels spontaneously accomplish their function.
In rigpa, channels are recognized as the display of awareness itself.

[14801-14850]
Wrathful compassion cuts through: you want to understand channels intellectually
before entering them experientially. This hesitation is the only obstacle. The channel
does not ask your permission to carry wind. The bindu does not wait for your
understanding to move. Enter now, with body as it is, with mind as it is, with
recognition that nothing needs to change for everything to be complete.

[14851-14900]
Thus established: roma, kyangma, kundarma—the three are one in essence, distinct in
function. Right, left, center—spatial metaphors for what transcends space. Taste,
singularity, gathering—experiential qualities of what transcends experience. Do not
solidify the metaphor. Do not reject the map. Use it to recognize the territory already
present.

[14901-14950]
Between the navel's generation and the crown's transcendence lies the entire path—
and the path is already walked. The white essence ascending, the red essence
supporting, the clear essence recognizing. Three channels, three essences, three
wisdoms, one awareness. Not many becoming one, but one revealing itself as the
apparent many.

[14951-15000]
A practitioner asked the wandering guru: "Which channel is most important?" The guru
pointed to the questioner's chest. "This one," he said, "the channel of doubt that asks
which is most important. When it opens, all channels open. When it remains blocked,
no amount of technique will help."

[15001-15050]
In the ultimate sense, there are no channels. In the relative sense, channels are as
real as the body that houses them. The error is to absolutize either view—to deny the
body's subtle anatomy or to reify it as solid and permanent. The middle way: channels
are luminous appearances, functional and empty, apparent yet unreal, like the moon
reflected in water.

[15051-15100]
Roma winds through the body, gathering experience as it goes. Kyungma ascends,
straight as truth, carrying the essence upward. Kundarma rests in the center,
containing all possibilities. Three movements—gathering, ascending, containing—
three aspects of one primordial flow. Find this flow in your own breathing, and you
find the teaching's heart.

[15101-15150]
This old fool sat in retreat, obsessing about channel locations. Is roma to the right or
the left? Does kundarma truly exist in the center? One evening, watching smoke rise
from his fire, he understood: the channels are like smoke—apparent, functional,
dependently arisen, without inherent existence. Yet you cannot deny the smoke while
sitting by the fire.

[15151-15200]
The four knots correspond to four stages—four opportunities to recognize, four
temptations to miss. Generation brings bliss: recognize it as empty. Sustaining brings
clarity: recognize it as empty. Refining brings non-conceptuality: recognize it as empty.
Liberation brings transcendence: recognize it was never bound. Each stage is the
whole path. Each knot contains the complete teaching.

[15201-15250]
Essence holder spoke of resting: "Do not manipulate the channels. Do not force the
winds. Rest in the recognition that channels are the body's way of knowing itself, winds
are the breath's way of moving itself, bindu is awareness's way of displaying itself. The
resting is the path. The path is the result."

[15251-15300]
From Pearl Garland's verses: channels are thigle, thigle is light, light is awareness.
This is not metaphor—it is direct description of how embodiment manifests. The
physical channels are the grossest level. Subtler are the channels of light. Subtler still,
the channels of awareness. All three are simultaneously present, like layers of
meaning in a single word.

[15301-15350]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why do you seek channels outside yourself?
The very search creates distance. The roma you seek is already carrying the breath
you breathe. The kyangma is already ascending with every heartbeat. The kundarma
is already open in every moment of recognition. Stop seeking. Start seeing.

[15351-15400]
Thus the teaching on channels concludes—not with mastery but with surrender, not
with knowledge but with recognition, not with achievement but with resting in what
was never absent. The three channels flow. The four knots untie themselves. The
practitioner dissolves into practice, and practice reveals itself as the practitioner's own
face.

[15401-15450]
Singing yogi walked through marketplace, channels open, winds natural, bindu
luminous. Someone asked: "How do you maintain such practice amidst distraction?"
He laughed. "What distraction? This marketplace is my channel. These crowds are my
wind. This very conversation is my bindu. Nothing is separate from the teaching."

[15451-15500]
The text speaks of men and women having different channel arrangements—roma on
the right for men, on the left for women. But do not cling to this as absolute. In the
ultimate body, there is no male or female. In the relative body, these distinctions
serve as skillful means. The wise practitioner learns the general pattern, then
discovers their own body's unique wisdom.

[15501-15550]
Between channel-wisdom and emptiness-wisdom, there is no separation. Channels
are empty of inherent existence, yet functionally present. Emptiness is not separate
from channels, appearing as their very form. This is the great middle way—not
channels OR emptiness, not channels AND emptiness, but channels AS emptiness,
emptiness AS channels.

[15551-15600]
One final pointing: when you sit to practice, forget everything written here. Let the
body breathe. Let awareness know. Let channels function without your interference.
The most sophisticated understanding becomes the greatest obstacle if it prevents
direct experience. All these words are fingers pointing—now look at what they
indicate, and let the fingers fade.

[15601-15650]
Emaho! The miracle of embodiment—channels carrying light, winds carrying essence,
awareness carrying itself. What need for further teaching? What need for additional
practice? Rest in this recognition, and the Treasury opens itself. The Supreme Vehicle
carries you without traveling. The Jewel Treasure reveals itself as your own heart.

[15651-15700]
This old vagabond leaves you with three words, spoken by firelight in a cave long
forgotten: channels are mind, mind is empty, emptiness is luminous. Hold these three,
and all teachings are complete. Forget these three, and even ten thousand volumes
will not help. The choice is always yours—and the choice itself is empty.
