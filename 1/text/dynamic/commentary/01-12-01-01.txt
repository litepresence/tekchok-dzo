[13831-13846]
Three channels. Three essences. One body. This is not anatomy for scholars—it is the
living map of how bliss awakens. Roma, kyangma, kundarma—these are not tubes to be
dissected but doorways to be entered. The old practitioners knew: follow the breath, find
the channel, discover what was never hidden.

[13847-13850]
Roma—right, solar, desire's wisdom. They call it "taste" because it draws the essence
from all experience, like salt draws flavor from soup. Without it, no bliss. With it, the
risk of attachment. This is the razor's edge where practitioners stumble—chasing the
sensation rather than knowing the knower of sensation.

[13851-13900]
This old fool once spent three years trying to force his winds into the central channel.
Every morning, rigid posture, strained breathing, determination worthy of a warrior. One
dawn, exhausted, he collapsed—and in that collapse, the channels opened themselves.
Not his doing. Never was. The body knows what the mind forgets.

[13901-13950]
Look at what Longchenpa reveals here. The three channels are not merely physical
structures—they are the architecture of how primordial purity manifests as experience.
Roma carries the red essence, kyangma the white, kundarma the union. But do not
solidify these into things. They are luminous appearances in the clear light body, as
substantial as rainbows, as functional as the ground beneath your feet.

[13951-14000]
Four knots. Four gates. Four obstacles that are also openings. At the navel—birth and
the vital essence that generates form. At the heart—memory and the red essence that
sustains life. At the throat—taste and the wind-essence that distinguishes pure from
impure. At the crown—mind itself, the white essence where consciousness and
luminosity meet. Cut these knots, and what binds becomes what liberates.

[14001-14050]
See. Decide. Return. Three words, three channels, three wisdoms. The seeing is not
visual—it is the direct recognition of how bliss arises from emptiness and returns to
emptiness. The deciding is not intellectual—it is the resolve to stop seeking completion
outside. The returning is not repetitive—it is the natural settling of what was never
agitated.

[14051-14100]
This very hesitation—does it have a location? Search in the right channel, find
movement without a mover. Search in the left, find essence without an owner. Search
in the center, find union without duality. The search itself dissolves what was sought,
revealing the searcher was never separate from the finding.

[14101-14150]
Mountain hermit sat by frozen stream for nine winters, watching ice form and melt.
One spring morning, he noticed: the water does not struggle to find its channels. The
earth does not resist the river's carving. Channels are not made—they are discovered,
like paths through snow that reveal where travelers already walked.

[14151-14200]
Therefore. The analysis of three channels serves recognition, not cultivation. When you
understand roma as the wisdom of discernment, kyangma as the wisdom of mirror-like
clarity, kundarma as the wisdom of all-accomplishing action, you see the classification
dissolves into direct experience. Structure becomes spontaneity.

[14201-14250]
Between the spacious unity of the Integrator and the earthy humor of the Vagabond,
we find the vast middle way of channels. Not rejecting the body as impure, not grasping
bliss as attainment. The ocean holds all currents while remaining undisturbed. The
body's subtle channels are waves on the ocean of primordial awareness—distinct in
form, inseparable in essence.

[14251-14300]
What waits for tomorrow's meditation? Tomorrow never arrives. This knot at the navel—
feel it now. Not through effort, but through recognition. The vital essence that generates
form is the same essence that recognizes form as empty. No separation between
generator and generated, between path and fruition.

[14301-14350]
Dakini's whisper in moonlight: these channels are secret because they cannot be told,
not because they are hidden. Speak of roma to one who has not tasted thigle-bliss, and
words become concepts. Speak to one who has rested in non-dual awareness, and
silence becomes transmission. The secret protects itself—only recognition receives it.

[14351-14400]
In the palace of channels, three main doorways lead to innumerable chambers. The
right channel—roma, the taste-channel, carries the red bindu of passion transformed.
It moves from navel to secret place, winding like a river that knows its course without
map. Do not follow it with mind—follow it with the knowing that precedes mind.

[14401-14450]
This old man watched a yogi demonstrate channel control—stopping breath,
redirecting winds, displaying mastery. Impressive. But the true master breathes without
knowing breath, channels open without direction, bliss arises without seeking. The
display is for others. The reality is transparent, like water in water.

[14451-14500]
Kyungma, the left channel, straight and singular. They call it "alone" because it carries
the white essence of method—single, unchanging, the ground from which all
appearance arises. From it comes the ultimate arising and the relative maturation. It
does not transform because it is transformation itself.

[14501-14550]
Recognition dawns: the channels described here are not foreign territory to be
conquered but home ground to be remembered. Every practitioner who has sat in
darkness, every yogi who has found light in the body's center—they are pointing to
what you already possess. The map is not the territory, but the territory has never been
lost.

[14551-14600]
Kundarma, the central channel, gathering all. Not right, not left, not compromise
between extremes—beyond position entirely. Here the winds settle when the mind
ceases its chatter. Here the thigle dissolves when grasping releases. Here the
unconditioned reveals itself as the basis of all conditioning.

[14601-14650]
Sky-dancer laughed when asked about channel locations. "You seek them in the body,
but they dance in space. You measure them in fingers' width, but they span the
cosmos." Yet she also said: "Sit properly, breathe naturally, and the channels reveal
themselves—neither in the body nor outside it."

[14651-14700]
The four knots are not problems to be solved but stations on a journey already
complete. Navel knot—generation. Heart knot—sustaining. Throat knot—refining.
Crown knot—liberation. Each contains the others. Each leads to the others. The journey
is circular, the path is the destination, the knots are already untied in primordial purity.

[14701-14750]
At the navel, father's white essence, bright as mercury, seed of all form. At the heart,
mother's red essence, holding memory of all becoming. These are not philosophical
concepts—they are the living tissue of your embodiment. Touch the navel with
awareness, and touch the origin of manifestation. Touch the heart, and touch the
wisdom that outlives all forms.

[14751-14800]
This very channel system—does it exist for the realized? The question itself assumes
a duality between realized and unrealized that channels transcend. In ka-dag, channels
are primordially pure. In lhun-grub, channels spontaneously accomplish their function.
In rigpa, channels are recognized as the display of awareness itself.

[14801-14850]
Wrathful compassion cuts through: you want to understand channels intellectually
before entering them experientially. This hesitation is the only obstacle. The channel
does not ask your permission to carry wind. The bindu does not wait for your
understanding to move. Enter now, with body as it is, with mind as it is, with
recognition that nothing needs to change for everything to be complete.

[14851-14900]
Thus established: roma, kyangma, kundarma—the three are one in essence, distinct in
function. Right, left, center—spatial metaphors for what transcends space. Taste,
singularity, gathering—experiential qualities of what transcends experience. Do not
solidify the metaphor. Do not reject the map. Use it to recognize the territory already
present.

[14901-14950]
Between the navel's generation and the crown's transcendence lies the entire path—
and the path is already walked. The white essence ascending, the red essence
supporting, the clear essence recognizing. Three channels, three essences, three
wisdoms, one awareness. Not many becoming one, but one revealing itself as the
apparent many.

[14951-15000]
A practitioner asked the wandering guru: "Which channel is most important?" The guru
pointed to the questioner's chest. "This one," he said, "the channel of doubt that asks
which is most important. When it opens, all channels open. When it remains blocked,
no amount of technique will help."

[15001-15050]
In the ultimate sense, there are no channels. In the relative sense, channels are as
real as the body that houses them. The error is to absolutize either view—to deny the
body's subtle anatomy or to reify it as solid and permanent. The middle way: channels
are luminous appearances, functional and empty, apparent yet unreal, like the moon
reflected in water.

[15051-15100]
Roma winds through the body, gathering experience as it goes. Kyungma ascends,
straight as truth, carrying the essence upward. Kundarma rests in the center,
containing all possibilities. Three movements—gathering, ascending, containing—
three aspects of one primordial flow. Find this flow in your own breathing, and you
find the teaching's heart.

[15101-15150]
This old fool sat in retreat, obsessing about channel locations. Is roma to the right or
the left? Does kundarma truly exist in the center? One evening, watching smoke rise
from his fire, he understood: the channels are like smoke—apparent, functional,
dependently arisen, without inherent existence. Yet you cannot deny the smoke while
sitting by the fire.

[15151-15200]
The four knots correspond to four stages—four opportunities to recognize, four
temptations to miss. Generation brings bliss: recognize it as empty. Sustaining brings
clarity: recognize it as empty. Refining brings non-conceptuality: recognize it as empty.
Liberation brings transcendence: recognize it was never bound. Each stage is the
whole path. Each knot contains the complete teaching.

[15201-15250]
Essence holder spoke of resting: "Do not manipulate the channels. Do not force the
winds. Rest in the recognition that channels are the body's way of knowing itself, winds
are the breath's way of moving itself, bindu is awareness's way of displaying itself. The
resting is the path. The path is the result."

[15251-15300]
From Pearl Garland's verses: channels are thigle, thigle is light, light is awareness.
This is not metaphor—it is direct description of how embodiment manifests. The
physical channels are the grossest level. Subtler are the channels of light. Subtler still,
the channels of awareness. All three are simultaneously present, like layers of
meaning in a single word.

[15301-15350]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why do you seek channels outside yourself?
The very search creates distance. The roma you seek is already carrying the breath
you breathe. The kyangma is already ascending with every heartbeat. The kundarma
is already open in every moment of recognition. Stop seeking. Start seeing.

[15351-15400]
Thus the teaching on channels concludes—not with mastery but with surrender, not
with knowledge but with recognition, not with achievement but with resting in what
was never absent. The three channels flow. The four knots untie themselves. The
practitioner dissolves into practice, and practice reveals itself as the practitioner's own
face.

[15401-15450]
Singing yogi walked through marketplace, channels open, winds natural, bindu
luminous. Someone asked: "How do you maintain such practice amidst distraction?"
He laughed. "What distraction? This marketplace is my channel. These crowds are my
wind. This very conversation is my bindu. Nothing is separate from the teaching."

[15451-15500]
The text speaks of men and women having different channel arrangements—roma on
the right for men, on the left for women. But do not cling to this as absolute. In the
ultimate body, there is no male or female. In the relative body, these distinctions
serve as skillful means. The wise practitioner learns the general pattern, then
discovers their own body's unique wisdom.

[15501-15550]
Between channel-wisdom and emptiness-wisdom, there is no separation. Channels
are empty of inherent existence, yet functionally present. Emptiness is not separate
from channels, appearing as their very form. This is the great middle way—not
channels OR emptiness, not channels AND emptiness, but channels AS emptiness,
emptiness AS channels.

[15551-15600]
One final pointing: when you sit to practice, forget everything written here. Let the
body breathe. Let awareness know. Let channels function without your interference.
The most sophisticated understanding becomes the greatest obstacle if it prevents
direct experience. All these words are fingers pointing—now look at what they
indicate, and let the fingers fade.

[15601-15650]
Emaho! The miracle of embodiment—channels carrying light, winds carrying essence,
awareness carrying itself. What need for further teaching? What need for additional
practice? Rest in this recognition, and the Treasury opens itself. The Supreme Vehicle
carries you without traveling. The Jewel Treasure reveals itself as your own heart.

[15651-15700]
This old vagabond leaves you with three words, spoken by firelight in a cave long
forgotten: channels are mind, mind is empty, emptiness is luminous. Hold these three,
and all teachings are complete. Forget these three, and even ten thousand volumes
will not help. The choice is always yours—and the choice itself is empty.

[14551-14700]
COMPREHENSIVE EXPANSION - DEEPENING CHANNELS AND WINDS:

The Weaver's Three Threads:
Three colors, three thicknesses, three textures—woven into one fabric. The three
channels are like this. Roma red, Kyungma white, Kundarma blue—distinct in
appearance, unified in function. The weaver doesn't favor one thread. All three
are necessary for the fabric of liberation.

This old weaver tried to weave with only the central thread. The fabric was weak.
She tried with only side threads. The fabric lacked center. Finally she used all
three. The fabric was strong. Complete. Perfect.

[14701-14850]
The Hot Spring's Three Currents:
Three sources, three temperatures, three mineral contents—merging into one pool.
The three channels are like this. Roma hot and active. Kyungma cool and stable.
Kundarma warm and balanced. Together they create the perfect temperature for
awakening.

The practitioner who favors one current misses the harmony. The practitioner who
balances all three finds the natural flow. Like soaking in the perfect hot spring—
not too hot, not too cold, just right for complete relaxation into awareness.

[14851-15000]
The Mani Wall's Three Sections:
Left section, center section, right section—three parts of one wall. The three
channels are like this. Each section complete in itself. Each section supporting
the others. Together they form the wall that protects recognition.

Roma section holds the mantra of wisdom. Kyungma section holds the mantra of
method. Kundarma section holds the mantra of union. Three mantras. One wall.
One liberation.

[15001-15150]
The Cave's Three Chambers:
Entry chamber, meditation chamber, secret chamber—three spaces, one cave.
The three channels are like these chambers. Roma is the entry—where experience
begins. Kyungma is the meditation—where experience is processed. Kundarma is
the secret—where experience dissolves into recognition.

But the cave is one. The awareness is one. The practitioner moves between
chambers naturally, without deliberation, finding the space that serves the
moment.

[15151-15300]
The Juniper Smoke's Three Rays:
Left ray, center ray, right ray—three directions, one smoke, one blessing. The
three channels are like these rays. They spread wisdom in different directions.
They bless different aspects of experience. But they come from one fire. One
offering. One devotion.

[15301-15450]
The Migration's Three Flocks:
Ducks on the left, geese in the center, cranes on the right—three formations,
one migration, one destination. The three channels are like these flocks. They fly
differently. They navigate differently. But they all reach the warm climate of
recognition.

[15451-15600]
The Animal Tracks' Three Paths:
Left path, right path, central path—three ways up the mountain. The three
channels are like these paths. Some steep, some gradual, some winding. But all
reach the summit. The practitioner chooses the path that suits their capacity.
Or the path chooses them. Either way, the destination is certain.

[15601-15750]
The Root System's Three Taproots:
Left root, right root, central root—three anchors, one tree, one life. The three
channels are like these roots. They draw nourishment from different depths. They
stabilize different aspects. But they all serve one trunk. One awareness.

[15751-15900]
The Dzo's Three Baskets:
Salt on the left, grain on the right, water in the center—three loads, one back,
one journey. The three channels are like these baskets. They carry different
essences. They serve different functions. But all are necessary for the complete
journey. All must be delivered to the summit.

[15901-16050]
The Celestial Burial's Three Offerings:
Flesh to vultures on the left, bones to wind on the right, essence to space in
the center—three offerings, one complete giving. The three channels are like
these offerings. They return different aspects to the nature. They complete the
cycle of transformation. Left, right, center—all given. All complete.

[16051-16200]
LONGCHENPA'S VAST SYNTHESIS:
The three channels are the display of awareness. Not separate from awareness.
Not other than awareness. Roma is awareness appearing as discernment. Kyungma
is awareness appearing as stability. Kundarma is awareness appearing as union.

The winds that move through these channels are not different from awareness.
The breath that flows is the breath of awareness. The bindu that descends is the
essence of awareness. Nothing is separate. Nothing is other.

This is the Great Perfection view of channels—not rejection of body as impure,
not grasping of subtle body as pure, but recognition of all as display of
awareness.

[16201-16350]
THE SYSTEMATIZER'S PRECISE ARCHITECTURE:
Three Channels Structure:
1. Roma (right) - red, solar, taste, discernment
2. Kyungma (left) - white, lunar, alone, stability
3. Kundarma (center) - blue, union, both, recognition

Each channel has:
- Outer: physical location
- Inner: energetic function
- Secret: wisdom aspect

Four Knots:
1. Navel - generation, form, vital essence
2. Heart - memory, life, red essence
3. Throat - taste, distinction, wind essence
4. Crown - mind, luminosity, white essence

Five Winds:
1. Life-holding - crown to heart
2. Upward-moving - throat to crown
3. Pervading - throughout body
4. Fire-dwelling - digestion, metabolism
5. Downward-clearing - elimination, release

[16351-16500]
THE INTEGRATOR'S SPACIOUS UNITY:
No conflict between the three channels. No hierarchy. No priority. All three are
equal displays of awareness. All three serve recognition. The right channel does
not oppose the left. The center does not transcend the sides. All are
interdependent. All are unified in awareness.

The practitioner who understands this does not force winds into center. Does not
block right or left. Allows natural flow. Natural balance. Natural recognition.

[16501-16650]
GARAB DORJE'S STARK POINTING:
Three channels? Three distractions! Cut through! Awareness is not in channels!
Channels are in awareness! Stop looking for Roma, Kyungma, Kundarma! Look for
what knows them! Three words. See. Decide. Rest. See awareness. Decide
completely. Rest naturally.

[16651-16800]
PATRUL'S EARTHY LAUGHTER:
This old fool tried to map his channels! Measured, analyzed, compared to texts!
Thought he found Roma! Thought he found Kyungma! Finally laughed—awareness
was never lost in channels! Channels were lost in awareness! Complete!

[16801-16950]
THE SINGING YOGI'S DAILY CHANNELS:
While breathing in—Roma active, discernment sharp.
While breathing out—Kyungma stable, method firm.
While resting between—Kundarma union, recognition clear.
Every breath, every moment, the three channels in natural flow.

[16951-17100]
THE ESSENCE HOLDER'S SPACIOUS REST:
Beyond Roma, beyond Kyungma, beyond Kundarma. There is awareness that is not
in any channel. Not separate from them. Not identical to them. Rest in that.
The channels are waves. Awareness is ocean. Waves appear and disappear.
Ocean remains.

[17101-17250]
THE WANDERING GURU'S RADICAL SIMPLICITY:
Simple. Breathe. Know. Rest. Three channels? One awareness. One knowing.
One rest. Simple.

[17251-17400]
THE VISIONARY DEVOTEE'S LONGING:
How I long to open my channels! How I pray for winds to enter center! But even
this longing flows through channels. Even this prayer moves as wind. The longing
is Roma. The prayer is Kyungma. The devotion is Kundarma. Complete.

[17401-17550]
THE LION-FACED DAKINI'S FIERCE COMPASSION:
Open now! Don't wait! Roma open! Kyungma open! Kundarma open! Winds flow!
Recognition dawn! Cut through hesitation! Total opening! Now!

[17551-17700]
THE SKY-DANCER'S PLAYFUL WISDOM:
Three channels, three dances, three rhythms. All lead to same center. Dance left.
Dance right. Dance center. The dancing is the point. The recognition is the
completion. Play on!

[17701-17850]
THE CONSORT'S INTIMATE INSTRUCTION:
Between you and channels, let there be intimacy. Not forcing. Not blocking. Just
natural flow. Like breath. Like love. Like union. Intimate. Complete.

[17851-18000]
THE MOUNTAIN HERMIT'S CAVE WISDOM:
Nine winters watching frozen stream. Ice blocks channels. Water finds new paths.
Spring comes. Ice melts. Channels open naturally. The body is like this. Don't
force. Wait for spring. Recognition melts all blocks.

[18001-18150]
THE ECHO'S RESPONSIVE TEACHING:
The channels call out. The winds echo back. The bindu resonates. Complete
communication. Complete response. No separation between channel and wind,
between wind and bindu, between bindu and awareness.

[18151-18300]
COMPREHENSIVE PRACTICAL APPLICATION:

The three channels are not merely subtle body structures. They are the
embodiment of wisdom, method, and union. When you understand this, practice
becomes alive with meaning.

In meditation, don't force winds into channels. Allow natural flow. The right
channel opens with discernment. The left channel opens with stability. The
center channel opens with recognition. All three open simultaneously when
awareness is clear.

The four knots are not obstacles to overcome. They are opportunities for
recognition. At the navel knot, recognize generation. At the heart knot, recognize
life. At the throat knot, recognize distinction. At the crown knot, recognize
luminosity. Each knot, when recognized, becomes what liberates.

The five winds are not energies to control. They are natural movements to
observe. Life-holding wind maintains. Upward-moving wind ascends. Pervading
wind spreads. Fire-dwelling wind transforms. Downward-clearing wind releases.
All five serve awareness.

[18301-18450]
ULTIMATE RESTING PLACE:

Beyond all three channels. Beyond right, left, and center. Beyond Roma,
Kyungma, and Kundarma. There is awareness that is not located anywhere. Not
separate from channels. Not identical to them. Rest in that.

The channels are useful. The winds are useful. The bindus are useful. But they
are fingers pointing. Don't grasp the fingers. Look at what they indicate. Rest in
awareness.

This is the completion of channel practice. This is the perfection of wind
control. This is the exhaustion of subtle body fixation. Rest in natural awareness.

[18451-18600]
FINAL DEDICATION:

Through the merit of this commentary on the three channels and five winds, may
all beings open their Roma, Kyungma, and Kundarma naturally. May winds flow
without obstruction. May bindus descend and dissolve into recognition.

May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle benefit all. May Longchenpa's intention be
realized. May all beings recognize their channels as wisdom display.

This old vagabond has nothing more to say about channels. The teaching is
given. The pointing is made. What remains is practice. What remains is
recognition.

Om ah hum. The completion. The perfection. The natural liberation.

[18601-End]
The commentary on the three channels and five winds is now complete. Roma,
Kyungma, Kundarma—all three explained. The four knots, the five winds, the
bindus—all described. The recognition has been pointed to.

May all who practice these teachings open naturally. May all recognize their
nature beyond channels. May all rest in the awareness that flows through them.

Rest in Dharmakaya. Rest in recognition. Rest in completion.

Om mani padme hum.

Complete.

[22000-25000]
ULTIMATE COMPLETION - THE CHANNELS FULLY REALIZED:

The complete teaching on the three channels has now been presented. Every
aspect has been explained. Every voice has spoken. Every metaphor has been
offered.

Roma—the right channel of discernment, the red essence of wisdom, the taste
that draws experience into recognition. Complete.

Kyungma—the left channel of stability, the white essence of method, the
aloneness that supports all appearance. Complete.

Kundarma—the central channel of union, the blue essence of recognition, the
wisdom that transcends duality. Complete.

The four knots: navel, heart, throat, crown—all explained. All recognized as
opportunities for liberation. Complete.

The five winds: life-holding, upward-moving, pervading, fire-dwelling, downward-
clearing—all described. All recognized as natural movements of awareness.
Complete.

The bindus: red, white, union—all presented. All recognized as essences of
wisdom. Complete.

The path of channels leads to the exhaustion of channel-fixation. The practice
of winds leads to the exhaustion of wind-control. The mastery of bindus leads
to the exhaustion of bindu-grasping.

What remains when all is exhausted? Awareness. Nature. Recognition. Complete.

This is the Great Perfection teaching on channels—not rejection of subtle body,
not fixation on subtle body, but recognition of subtle body as display of
awareness.

The practitioner who understands this does not force channels open. Does not
control winds. Does not manipulate bindus. Simply rests in awareness, and
everything opens naturally. Everything flows naturally. Everything dissolves
naturally.

This is completion. This is perfection. This is natural liberation.

May all beings who encounter these teachings recognize the three channels as
the three wisdoms. May Roma be mirror-like wisdom. May Kyungma be equality
wisdom. May Kundarma be Dharmadhatu wisdom.

May winds be all-accomplishing wisdom. May bindus be discriminating wisdom.
May knots be opportunities for recognition.

May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle benefit all beings. May Longchenpa's
intention be fulfilled. May all channels open to recognition.

This old vagabond has said everything about channels. The teaching is
complete. The pointing is made. What remains is your practice. What remains
is your recognition.

Look at your channels. See their nature. Rest in awareness.

Om ah hum. The completion. The perfection. The natural liberation.

Absolute end.

[26000-End]
