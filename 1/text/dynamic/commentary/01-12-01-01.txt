You think these channels are tubes inside the body? Fool. Look at the sky—does it have vessels? Yet clouds move. These are labels for what has no shape.

[13954-13970]
Thalgyur speaks to those who must count channels before they trust what never moves. The body has no life-pillar. That which thinks "this is the central channel"—find that one first.

A-OM-HUM abide—where? In the space where the letter A has no form. That space is your face right now. Recognize it or chase channels for another eon.

[14003-14006]
Listen, dear practitioner! Look at your own body—this very flesh and bone. When pure, it ripens into Buddha's body, speech, and mind. When impure, it ripens into your ordinary body, speech, and mind. Do you see the difference? It is only the presence or absence of confusion! Mistaken view opens the door for the three poisons to arise. Drop the mistake, and where is the impurity?

Now, this ro ma channel—taste channel, they call it. When you press it, supreme flavor arises like the best food! But leave it alone, and it is like dead flesh—useless. What does this teach you? Use it or lose it! Engage with the dharma, taste the practice. Let it sit idle, and you are a corpse walking.

[14010-14015]
This channel runs on the right side for men, left for women. But wait! Some tantras reverse this. Why? To break your rigid certainty! You think you know where things are? The dharma smashes your maps. Certainty is the disease—doubt cut through is the cure. The rkyang ma—solitary channel—when pressed, gives birth to experience free from conceptual thought. Left alone, it stays isolated, unrelated to others, standing alone like a hermit in the mountains. For men it is on the left, for women on the right. Do not cling to positions!

[14016-14020]
The kun 'dar ma—central channel, all-shaking—dwells between male and female sides. Press it, and wisdom clarity experience arises! It is the maintainer of your body, speech, and mind. These three channels are the basis of all channels, therefore called "ma"—the mothers. Everything arises from them.

[14021-14027]
Now listen closely! When ro ma comes to the right side of a man, it produces bodhicitta—the mind of enlightenment. But in a woman's left, it gathers and swells the bodhicitta, never satisfied with desire. When rkyang ma comes to a man's left, it holds the power of blood emission—the nosebleed marks the time of wisdom! Do you see? Your very fluids are the dharma.

On a woman's right side, this divides into the five sense channels, source of diseases men never know—this is the difference of constitution. Dark complexion, short thick body, good teeth, round face—these mark the deer-channel, the main one. Like the antler of a stag, thick at the root with much desire, thin at the tip—actual bodhicitta cannot emerge! Here, if you make the thigle's key point into the path, the instruction on channel movement is supreme. Fair complexion, thin body, straight hair—know these signs.

Emaho! Your body is the mandala!

[14035-14046]

Listen, dear practitioner! Insertion place, making close. Conventionally, at the twenty-first vertebra of mind-ripened-born men. At women's thirteenth, at the lotus stigma's tip. Its branches gather at the breast peak. Those sixteen branches at the navel gathering. At men's rib interval. These perform body's formation, abiding, destruction—taking close.

[14114-14119]
Rkyang ma produces speech. Without curve and straight—voice pleasant, code clear. If minor branches thin—voice shrill and short, or code unclear like stammer comes. Naturally, without branches and curve.

[14120-14128]
From those ten channels gone, voice comes rough. If that channel has upper-lower thick-thin gaps—voice comes with many tips and interrupted. If that channel has pressure—voice comes suppressed and trembling. If channel completely exists—voice comes very clear, chewing others. Yogis change by channel oral instruction.

Do you see? Your voice comes from channels! Straight channels, pleasant voice. Crooked channels, stammering. But who speaks? Find that one!

Emaho! The speaker has no voice!

Rkyangma—body's heat increasing-decreasing. This channel thin, body naturally much heat; wide, small, always cold; crooked and changing as before. Kundarma—body's thirst characteristic, showing non-thirst dharmatā. This thin, never thirsty; wide, great thirst desire.

Listen here! The Kun-darma channel joins mind's movement with pure dharmatā, aligning memory-thought with reality. This matches self-arisen wisdom—earlier and later conceptions self-cease, self-liberate, self-arise. Objects and conditions liberate into dharmatā, memory-conception self-depleted, dharmatā's intent appears!

The *Mu-tig-phreng* tantra teaches: "Body is three-kaya mandala body; words spoken are mantra speech; thoughts are meditation itself." When you squeeze the channel's ripening essence, the channel reaches its own characteristic. Finding the location, you recognize dharmatā arisen from channels. At the channel's leaping time, knowing death-transference and birth-place. Pressing the channel's nature, mind non-separated from samadhi's wheel. Holding the wrapped channel's heat measure, always becomes food yoga. Following the channel's movement calculation, becomes clothing yoga. Relying on the channel's pulsing vital-point, latent tendencies cease—these channel vital-points are extremely profound!

Now the four wheels! All beings' bodies depend on wheels; even non-wheel dharmas are established from many. Like external existence: wind depends on water, water on earth, etc.—wind-mind clear-essence gathered, water gathers as one, internal body forms. First wheel from water's action—blood, water-yellow, saliva, eye-water arise as essence. Body's increase-decrease is blood's function. When elements heat, blood dries—body becomes disease. Increasing blood cures disease. When cold, blood freezes—disease. Do you see? Your body is the play of these wheels, practitioner!

Emaho! Three kayas right in your flesh!

[14240-14246]
Listen here, dear practitioner! Squeezed flesh, flesh variety from heart branched and supported—these when cut, pinched, struck, pierced make life's end. Burning and roasting through dependent origination liberates from disease!

Thus from earth, wood and so on arise—fire's cause in So-nga Wang-ra. Third wheel fire's action chief. This produces body's heat, faculties, color. When heat is great, becomes hot element, making body's disease and death conditions. When heat is small, becomes cold disease condition. Elements equal through dharmat's dependent origination liberates!

[14253-14264]
Also fire heat moved by wind moves, blazing like great fire. Fourth wheel wind's action work, breath outside-inside moving, rising-descending eliminating work. Karma wheel makes samsara's root. Latency and hatred's work disturbs body elements' individual functions, making disease and death conditions—liberation through dependent origination of elements placed in vital-point.

Do you see? Disease comes from elements disturbed! Liberation comes from recognizing dependent origination!

Emaho! Elements equal—liberation through dharmata!

From gathering: form large but strength weak, limbs thin. From gathering-release: form small but strength endowed. From mindfulness projection: mind clear, senses clear, discrimination without coarseness.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. From gathering: discrimination large and forgetful.

Listen! It is not what you have but how you hold it. Gather too much, and even a strong body becomes weak. Release with awareness, and even a small form becomes powerful.

[14274-14283]
From gathering: senses clear, mind clear, forgetful. From flying projection: discrimination large yet meditation quickly arises. From pure taste projection: speech pleasant, words clear, sounds skillful.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. From gathering: speech unpleasant. From impure increase: pleasant speech, great eloquence, yet speech powerless. From pure tip projection: mind pure, aspirations accomplished.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. From impure increase: mind's good accomplished yet virtue not increased. From gathering: mind's desires not accomplished, mindfulness and meditation reversed. From pure: mind's desires not accomplished yet virtue increased. This is the certainty of gathering-releasing.

Also, the reason for the certainty of four wheels: One and two do not ripen empowerments, path, and final results; three also does not ripen; reverse certainty also makes four. Recognition is immediate.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. The sequence of what joins and what joins—harmonious certainty also makes four.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. Outer four elements, inner four wisdoms, secret four lamps, unsurpassed four kayas—certain, therefore four wheels. True body, speech, mind, mind—four. Purifying four empowerments, pure four results—certain, therefore four wheels as basis.

[14294-14302]
Second, explaining the individual enumerations of four wheels: navel emanation wheel, heart dharma wheel, throat enjoyment wheel, crown great bliss wheel. First has four: general enumeration, individual limb explanation, particular key points shown.

Repair methods certainly explained! First: root channel petals six, water root four branched, petals numberless! Particularly inner channels certain: elements, mind, ignorance, mind, elements all-gathered's divisions, small wheel's petal each thirty-eight becomes, divided two thousand four hundred thirty-two exist!

[14315-14332]
Also root and branch's power done: channel basis wheel: emanation wheel petals sixty-four! Elements etc. stages divided: earth channels five aspects, body's basis holding! Water channels five aspects, body's essence gathering! Fire's essence gathering! Wind's channels five aspects, wind's essence gathering! Mind's channels five aspects, breath's essence gathering! Ignorance channels five aspects, individual body's elements showing! Space mind's channels two, breath and awareness's essence gathering! Elements all-gathered channels six, sphere and ignorance gathering!

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[14456-14467]
Listen here, dear one! These channels have secret names in the medical tradition. The long bindu tail dwells at the right waist—cut it to benefit kidney disease. The short bindu tail at the left—cut it for spinal curvature. The bol gong at the right holds sha's tail—cut for wind disorder.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was. The klong du gyu at the left—cut for ear disease. The left tail at the ankle's outer edge—cut for kidney ailments. These are not anatomy lessons! These are signs pointing to where energy gets stuck in your own body.

[14468-14485]
The kham letter dwells at the left—called the kidney grasping channel in medicine—cut it for lumbar distortion and hip pain. But listen well, practitioner! When disease arises, the yogi does not do this to oneself! When these letters arise internally, recite them verbally with breath five times each, expelling them to the nostril—this is liberation! The ti and ti at right and left forehead, la at right and left thigh hollow, sa and sa at right and left kidney hollow, sha and sha at the armpit—these points burned heal disorders.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. But the yogi does not burn oneself! Draw breath from outside to inside with awareness—this is the path!

Emaho! The body itself is the mandala of liberation!

Ta and La at the vajra, upper and lower—press these two, and the bindu's movement stops. The syllable Sha at the vajra tip—pressing these two abandons desire. Listen! When yogic illness strikes the body, repeatedly press and release all these.

[14510-14519]
Gathering diseases are extracted from the root by this. Tsa and Tsa are below the navel, right and left.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Ta and Ta are at the armpits, right and left. To and To are at the hips, right and left.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. Ja and Ja are below the navel, right and left. Ta and Ta are at the kidneys, right and left. Do not press these inward—recite and release upward, and the elements become balanced.

[14520-14526]
Below the waist, however it may be, reciting these syllables with effort, element diseases certainly dissolve in their own place. Right and left are the key points of the syllables themselves. Hot and cold—white and red colors. These are the colors of the syllables. Other than these, root syllables have no benefit or harm.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

======================================================================
[01-12-01-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


[Section] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

[Section] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

[Section] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

[Section] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

[Section] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

[Section] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

[Section] Voice 08 (Integrator): The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

[Section] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

[Section] Voice 12 (Ecstatic): Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

[Section] Voice 04 (Consort): The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
