Three channels. Three essences. One body. This is not anatomy for scholars—it is the
living map of how bliss awakens. Roma, kyangma, kundarma—these are not tubes to be
dissected but doorways to be entered. The old practitioners knew: follow the breath, find
the channel, discover what was never hidden.

[1-697]
Wrathful compassion cuts through: you want to understand channels intellectually
before entering them experientially. This hesitation is the only obstacle. The channel
does not ask your permission to carry wind. The bindu does not wait for your
understanding to move. Enter now, with body as it is, with mind as it is, with
recognition that nothing needs to change for everything to be complete.

[17-20]
Roma—right, solar, desire's wisdom. They call it "taste" because it draws the essence
from all experience, like salt draws flavor from soup. Without it, no bliss. With it, the
risk of attachment. This is the razor's edge where practitioners stumble—chasing the
sensation rather than knowing the knower of sensation.

[21-70]
During my wandering years... once spent three years trying to force his winds into the central channel.
Every morning, rigid posture, strained breathing, determination worthy of a warrior. One
dawn, exhausted, he collapsed—and in that collapse, the channels opened themselves.
Not his doing. Never was. The body knows what the mind forgets.

[71-120]
Look at what Longchenpa reveals here. The three channels are not merely physical
structures—they are the architecture of how primordial purity manifests as experience.
Roma carries the red essence, kyangma the white, kundarma the union. But do not
solidify these into things. They are luminous appearances in the clear light body, as
substantial as rainbows, as functional as the ground beneath your feet.

[77-82]
This very channel system—does it exist for the realized? The question itself assumes
a duality between realized and unrealized that channels transcend. In ka-dag, channels
are primordially pure. In lhun-grub, channels spontaneously accomplish their function.
In rigpa, channels are recognized as the display of awareness itself.

[121-170]
Four knots. Four gates. Four obstacles that are also openings. At the navel—birth and
the vital essence that generates form. At the heart—memory and the red essence that
sustains life. At the throat—taste and the wind-essence that distinguishes pure from
impure. At the crown—mind itself, the white essence where consciousness and
luminosity meet. Cut these knots, and what binds becomes what liberates.

[171-220]
See. Decide. Return. Three words, three channels, three wisdoms. The seeing is not
visual—it is the direct recognition of how bliss arises from emptiness and returns to
emptiness. The deciding is not intellectual—it is the resolve to stop seeking completion
outside. The returning is not repetitive—it is the natural settling of what was never
agitated.

[221-270]
This very hesitation—does it have a location? Search in the right channel, find
movement without a mover. Search in the left, find essence without an owner. Search
in the center, find union without duality. The search itself dissolves what was sought,
revealing the searcher was never separate from the finding.

[271-320]
Mountain hermit sat by frozen stream for nine winters, watching ice form and melt.
One spring morning, he noticed: the water does not struggle to find its channels. The
earth does not resist the river's carving. Channels are not made—they are discovered,
like paths through snow that reveal where travelers already walked.

[300-305]
At the navel, father's white essence, bright as mercury, seed of all form. At the heart,
mother's red essence, holding memory of all becoming. These are not philosophical
concepts—they are the living tissue of your embodiment. Touch the navel with
awareness, and touch the origin of manifestation. Touch the heart, and touch the
wisdom that outlives all forms.

[321-370]
Therefore. The analysis of three channels serves recognition, not cultivation. When you
understand roma as the wisdom of discernment, kyangma as the wisdom of mirror-like
clarity, kundarma as the wisdom of all-accomplishing action, you see the classification
dissolves into direct experience. Structure becomes spontaneity.

[371-420]
Between the spacious unity of the Integrator and the earthy humor of the Vagabond,
we find the vast middle way of channels. Not rejecting the body as impure, not grasping
bliss as attainment. The ocean holds all currents while remaining undisturbed. The
body's subtle channels are waves on the ocean of primordial awareness—distinct in
form, inseparable in essence.

[421-470]
What waits for tomorrow's meditation? Tomorrow never arrives. This knot at the navel—
feel it now. Not through effort, but through recognition. The vital essence that generates
form is the same essence that recognizes form as empty. No separation between
generator and generated, between path and fruition.

[471-520]
Dakini's whisper in moonlight: these channels are secret because they cannot be told,
not because they are hidden. Speak of roma to one who has not tasted thigle-bliss, and
words become concepts. Speak to one who has rested in non-dual awareness, and
silence becomes transmission. The secret protects itself—only recognition receives it.

[473-478]
The four knots are not problems to be solved but stations on a journey already
complete. Navel knot—generation. Heart knot—sustaining. Throat knot—refining.
Crown knot—liberation. Each contains the others. Each leads to the others. The journey
is circular, the path is the destination, the knots are already untied in primordial purity.

[521-570]
In the palace of channels, three main doorways lead to innumerable chambers. The
right channel—roma, the taste-channel, carries the red bindu of passion transformed.
It moves from navel to secret place, winding like a river that knows its course without
map. Do not follow it with mind—follow it with the knowing that precedes mind.

[571-620]
A simple practitioner... watched a yogi demonstrate channel control—stopping breath,
redirecting winds, displaying mastery. Impressive. But the true master breathes without
knowing breath, channels open without direction, bliss arises without seeking. The
display is for others. The reality is transparent, like water in water.

[596-601]
Sky-dancer laughed when asked about channel locations. "You seek them in the body,
but they dance in space. You measure them in fingers' width, but they span the
cosmos." Yet she also said: "Sit properly, breathe naturally, and the channels reveal
themselves—neither in the body nor outside it."

[621-670]
Kyungma, the left channel, straight and singular. They call it "alone" because it carries
the white essence of method—single, unchanging, the ground from which all
appearance arises. From it comes the ultimate arising and the relative maturation. It
does not transform because it is transformation itself.

[669-674]
Kundarma, the central channel, gathering all. Not right, not left, not compromise
between extremes—beyond position entirely. Here the winds settle when the mind
ceases its chatter. Here the thigle dissolves when grasping releases. Here the
unconditioned reveals itself as the basis of all conditioning.

[671-697]
Recognition dawns: the channels described here are not foreign territory to be
conquered but home ground to be remembered. Every practitioner who has sat in
darkness, every yogi who has found light in the body's center—they are White against blue, changing constantly. The change The mind creates, the creation dissolves. What remains? stillness.
what you already possess. The map is not the territory, but the territory has never been
lost.
