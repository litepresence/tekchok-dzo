[3313-3321]
First: The outer three rely on the five whites, etc.—conducting bath, purity, fasting, and dwelling, tormenting the body. The inner conducts the five meats and five nectars, etc.—relying on rigma and so forth, accepting and rejecting, purity and impurity—surpassing the lower vehicles.

The lower cannot meditate on deity face union. The inner surpasses through ability. The outer does not realize the indivisible true view. The inner surpasses through realization.

[3313-3321]
This old man once. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The outer says: "Don't touch meat, don't touch women, keep pure." The inner says: "All is deity. Meat is nectar. Union is wisdom."

Which is higher? The one that cuts through all reference points.

[3322-3334]
Second: From the five aspects—essence: the indivisible true, pure, equal primordial wisdom, liberation attained in one life through its play. This is the treasury's heart.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Etymology: Accomplishing great purpose through slight effort—the inner means vehicle.
Purpose: Obtaining the two accomplishments in one life.
Result: Reaching the level of Vajradhara in this life.

Divided: Mahāyoga tantra, Anuyoga scripture, Atiyoga instruction—three.

From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
"The inner is divided into three.
Mahā, Anu, Ati."

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[3335-3340]
See what is. Rest in recognition. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Mahāyoga tantra vehicle: meditating through the three doors of concentration, the main means of the generation stage, on the indivisible true, great clear empty light primordial wisdom.

Divided: main basis, path, and result; main accomplishment; three traditions desiring various paths to become.

[3341-3361]
Slash through hesitation. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The basis, cause of clarity: mind itself is ultimate, free from elaboration, distinguished as the Great One through being without effort. The essence: basis, mind, and gold with its color—just as these two are non-dual.

The path of liberation: entering into the body of great yoga, self-liberated realization.

The result: ripened mind's result appears variously and liberates variously. Called self-arisen primordial wisdom.

[3362-3410]
SUDDEN. The tradition of accomplishment! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Divided: Through body accomplishment, carrying the maṇḍala wheel of Mañjuśrī to the path. Through speech accomplishment, making one a Buddha of the lotus family. Through mind accomplishment, making one a Buddha of the Heruka vajra family. Through quality accomplishment, making one a Buddha of the jewel family. Through activity accomplishment, accomplishing one as Buddha of the karma family.

Accomplishing each deity through the three concentrations without duality. Becoming the Buddha of each family.

[3380-3410]
The tantra: with generation stage as main, with completion stage as main, with union as main. And those wishing incomplete, partial pieces—many.

From the two upadeśas: Svātma upadeśa with mind as main; Maṇḍala upadeśa with entry into maṇḍala.

The outer container world as celestial palace. The supported sentient beings as deities and goddesses. Seeing all beings as forms of deities and goddesses.

Purpose: not taking the life of commitment deities, not doing non-virtues. Not intentionally creating mental objects.

[3400-3410]
In ultimate truth, no deity exists, no entities or signs. Only conventionally purifying aggregates and elements, dwelling in the maṇḍala of deities and goddesses.

The five aggregates, five elements, five objects, five faculties, five afflictions—all purified. The meaning purified upon the pure expanse of basis nature.

The purified result: body and primordial wisdom, not even establishing—realizing.

[3411-3450]
From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
"Alas, the secret lord is definitely held.
The established view of Mahā is thus.
The door of entry is the three concentrations.
The view of realization: Whatever appears, realize as deity.
The root samaya: Body, speech, mind.
The result: Means and wisdom, not separate."

The three concentrations: suchness, free from thought, crystal clarity; all-illuminating; cause concentration.

[3441-3450]
Break through. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The three samayas:
Through body door: abandoning killing, stealing, sexual misconduct.
Through speech door: abandoning lies, slander, harsh speech, idle talk.
Through mind door: abandoning covetousness, harmful intent, wrong view.

Realizing means and wisdom as non-separate. Thus the established view of Mahāyoga.

[3451-3476]
SUDDEN. Anuyoga scripture! What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Expanse and primordial wisdom non-dual, free from elaboration, not abiding in any extreme. Accomplishing through the main door of completion stage wisdom.

From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
"Hearken, Vajra-holder!
The great Anuyoga vehicle of extensive scripture:
Twofold aspect: expanse and primordial wisdom.
Desiring vajra of non-dual non-separation.
Entry through gate: instantaneous with gradual—thus."

[3477-3492]
What is instantaneous entry?
"Deities ungenerated, essence recalled, through perfection.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from."

What is gradual entry?
"Expanse and primordial wisdom gradually entered, and then
By vajra-holder on ground, result obtained.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from."

The protecting samaya: honoring the secret mantra teacher, making offerings, recognizing guru and Buddha as non-different.

[3493-3512]
Anuyoga holds: becoming Buddha in a single birth, definitely becoming Buddha in the intermediate state, finally becoming Buddha through birth. The nature is complete.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Regarding liberation-ground's basis: expanse and primordial wisdom—fabricated phenomena, effort and accomplishment, without transference, emptiness without conception, wherein self-arising primordial wisdom has arisen.

Called the expanse and primordial wisdom of effortless self-liberation.

[3513-3522]
See what is. Rest in recognition. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Those who gradually enter into the expanse and primordial wisdom:
Through abiding, through emptiness, understanding bliss as the entering.
Called the union without superior or inferior, without acceptance or rejection.

Through instantaneous entering: understanding the self-arising dharma-nature as free from view and without separation, dharmas exhausted—called the instantaneous liberation without cause.

[3523-3533]
SUDDEN. Nine views of Anuyoga! The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Because expanse and primordial wisdom are non-different: view of non-dual equality.
Without coming or going: view of not becoming other than abiding.
Without extent or falling to sides: view of abiding from the primordial beginning.
Not understood from mere words: view without reference point, without basis or separation.

The sphere of meaning is the basis. Primordial wisdom is the path. The expanse is the cause, primordial wisdom the result.

[3534-3553]
Ninth: The Instruction of the Great Perfection. The nature is complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

In self-arising primordial wisdom, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not established. Wished for as beyond primordial liberation, acceptance, and rejection.

Not established anywhere. All-liberating primordial wisdom does not cease.

Like water-waves, sky-vapor, ocean-depths, lamp-light—spontaneous, self-arising, self-liberated, self-dissolved.

[3551-3568]
Cut! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Four samayas:
- Not existing
- Spontaneous
- Self-perfect
- Single

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
"In Great Perfection Ati:
One perfect, two perfect, all perfect.
One arising, two arising, all arising.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
One born, two born, all born.
One non-existent, two non-existent, all non-existent."

[3596-3612]
Great Perfection Atiyoga spontaneously complete vehicle—three sections:
- Mind Section
- Expanse Section 
- Instruction Section Rest in this understanding.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

From Ati's Great Array:
"Those-with-mind: mind's category.
Those-with-sky: space's category.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.
Those-without-striving: instruction."

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

These do not transgress from the three desires. Through the meaning, answering that the basis, path, result, and liberation are Great Perfection.

[3613-3630]
The Mind Section: Great Perfection that speaks of the basis become like a spear. Recognition is immediate.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Divided: Great Perfection that speaks of various minds existing, and Great Perfection that speaks of mind's aspect existing.

Mind-only is meaning that exists, and non-existence is stopped. Meaning is thus not established as mind-only. Meaning-only is also not established upon mind.

[3631-3691]
Great Perfection that speaks of mind's aspect existing: the essence is the direction of appearance. Rest in this understanding.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. The direction of mind is appearance. Whatever appears is mind.

Because mind itself has arisen in self-arising primordial wisdom, the play of mind's aspect is without cessation—called self-arising.

Six divisions: mind's direction desiring the arising-place of result-mind; beyond deviation and obscuration; confused compounded reasoning; self-arising primordial wisdom without falling to extremes; direction-holding and self-established objects; distinguishing established tenets free from intellect.

[3692-381]
The text lists vast quantities—hundreds of thousands of ślokas, thousands of chapters, hundreds of essential points. But do not be overwhelmed. All these words point to one thing: your own mind, recognizing itself.

The Mind Section, Expanse Section, Instruction Section—all three gathered. This is Dzogchen, the summit of all vehicles.
 The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.
