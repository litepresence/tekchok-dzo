[3341-3361]
The basis made clear—mind itself, ultimate truth, free from great elaboration. Distinguished as great through being without effort. Like gold and its color, these two are non-dual. The basis to be accomplished: through accomplishment, mind's marks are realized closely. Basis abiding and self-liberation's samadhi distinguishes this.

The path made clear: entering into the body of great yoga through the yoga path of manifestation. The gradual entry liberation path: depending on the stages of birth of the yoga path, entering the great yoga body, desiring self-liberated realization.

The result made clear: ripened mind's result appears variously and liberates variously—called self-arisen primordial wisdom.

[3341-3361]
This old fool wandered through nine valleys seeking what was never lost. Sixty years chasing teachings—then laughed until tears fell. The basis, path, and result were never three. Gold does not seek its color; water does not search for wetness.

Between effort and ease, we find the Mahāyoga path. Three concentrations—suchness, all-luminous, crystal-clear—are not destinations but descriptions of awareness resting in its own nature. Like a river describing its flow to itself.

[3362-3370]
The tradition desiring accomplishment: body carries Mañjuśrī's maṇḍala; speech makes lotus family Buddha; mind makes Heruka vajra family Buddha; qualities make jewel family Buddha; activities make karma family Buddha. Five families, five wisdoms, one nature displaying.

[3362-3370]
Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation: five Buddha families as five wisdom aspects, five aggregates purified, five elements transmuted. Body as Mañjuśrī's palace—this is not visualization but recognition. The maṇḍala already abides; the deity is your own face before masks.

The path of generation stage creates conditions for recognition. Like preparing a field before planting—necessary, yet the harvest depends on what was always in the seed.

[3371-3410]
The outer container world as celestial palace. Sentient beings as deities. All aggregates, elements, objects, faculties, afflictions purified—dwelling in the maṇḍala. Outer conducts purity and impurity. Inner realizes the indivisible true view. Which is higher? The one cutting through all reference points.

[3371-3410]
From Lotus-Born: These secret instructions are the heart-essence of all Buddhas. The outer world as celestial palace—not a poetic fancy but the nature of appearance when grasping subsides. Sentient beings as deities—recognition, not transformation.

This wanderer once spent a month in a cave, practicing deity yoga until the rocks themselves seemed alive with light. Then realized: the rocks were never other than light. The practice revealed what was always true.

Three words. Recognize. Rest. Continue. The generation stage is a finger pointing at your own hand.

[3411-3450]
From Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra: "The door of entry is the three concentrations. The view: whatever appears, realize as deity. The root samaya: body, speech, mind. The result: means and wisdom, not separate."

The three concentrations—suchness, free from thought, crystal clarity—are not states to achieve. They are descriptions of how awareness rests when not distracted. Like trying to describe the taste of water to someone who has only drunk wine.

[3411-3450]
Between the construct and the natural, we find the three concentrations. Suchness: awareness knowing itself without content. All-luminous: appearances arising as ornaments. Crystal-clear: the lucidity that knows both. These are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of one recognition.

The root samaya of body, speech, and mind—honoring these as the three vajras already complete. Not keeping vows but recognizing they were never broken.

[3451-3492]
Anuyoga: expanse and primordial wisdom non-dual. Instantaneous with gradual entry. Instantaneous: deities ungenerated, essence recalled through perfection. Gradual: expanse and wisdom entered progressively.

Protecting samaya: honoring the secret mantra teacher, recognizing guru and Buddha as non-different. This is not worship of an external power—it is recognizing your own nature in the teacher's pointing.

[3451-3492]
This old vagabond met a teacher who never spoke a word of Dharma. Just pointed at the sky, then at my heart, then laughed. That pointing was the entire Anuyoga path. Instantaneous recognition of what perfection means.

The gradual aspect: expanse entered progressively—like learning to swim by first feeling water, then floating, then moving. But the water was always wet; the floating was always possible.

The nine views from non-dual equality to without reference point—each one a loosening of grasping, a relaxation into what was never distant. The sphere of meaning as basis, primordial wisdom as path—words pointing to what transcends word and meaning.

[3493-3522]
Anuyoga holds: becoming Buddha in one birth, in the intermediate state, or through rebirth. Nine views from non-dual equality to without reference point. The sphere of meaning is basis; primordial wisdom is path.

Self-arising primordial wisdom—like water-waves, sky-vapor, ocean-depths, lamp-light. Spontaneous, self-arising, self-liberated.

[3493-3522]
Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation: three timings for awakening—this life, bardo, next birth. Not pessimism but realism about recognition's stability. Like a flame in wind: some protected, some flicker, some go out. The protection is recognition itself.

The nine views: rungs on a ladder that leads nowhere, for you are already at the top. Yet each rung matters for those who believe themselves at the bottom.

Self-arising wisdom: water cannot help but ripple when disturbed, sky cannot help but hold clouds. The arising is the nature, not the problem.

[3523-3553]
Ninth: Great Perfection instruction. In self-arising primordial wisdom, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not established. Four samayas: not existing, spontaneous, self-perfect, single.

From Self-Arisen Awareness: "One perfect, two perfect, all perfect. One arising, two arising, all arising."

[3523-3553]
Ha! The Great Perfection! Not the peak of the mountain but the ground before mountains were imagined. The nine vehicles are like describing an ocean with cups of different sizes; Atiyoga is the ocean itself.

This old fool spent decades learning the lower vehicles. Each one precious, each one pointing. Then one day, laughing at my own efforts, recognized: the pointing hand and the pointed-to were never separate.

Four samayas: not existing—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are conceptual imputations; spontaneous—no effort needed; self-perfect—already complete; single—non-dual from the start. Not vows to keep but descriptions of what is.

[3554-3595]
Great Perfection Atiyoga: three sections—Mind, Expanse, Instruction. Mind Section: various minds existing, mind's aspect existing. Yet meaning not established as mind-only.

Like a lion among beasts. Self-knowing establishing, surpassing lower vehicles. Self-arisen, self-dissolved. Without meditation object or meditator.

[3554-3595]
The integration reveals: Mind Section begins with the assertion that mind exists in various forms, yet this is not idealism. The aspect of mind is not the essence. Like describing a dream to someone awake—the description is accurate yet misses the nature of waking.

This lion among beasts: Dzogchen does not compete with lower vehicles; it simply rests in what they approach from different angles. Like a mountain seen from valleys—each valley sees a different shape, yet the mountain is one.

Self-arisen, self-dissolved: thoughts arise like breath, release like breath. No meditator needed because no meditation was ever separate from awareness itself.

[3596-3612]
Mind's aspect: direction of appearance. Whatever appears is mind. Six divisions: result-mind's arising-place; beyond deviation; reasoning free from extremes; self-arising without falling; self-established objects; tenets free from intellect.

[3596-3612]
The direction of appearance: mind faces outward, toward objects, toward experience. Yet turn it around—what faces? The six divisions of Mind Section trace this turning from various angles.

Result-mind's arising-place: where does awakening happen? Not elsewhere. Beyond deviation: the straight path that is no path. Reasoning free from extremes: not this, not that, yet not nothing.

[3613-3692]
The six divisions of Mind Section: From dharmatā without change to free from intellect's investigation. All pointing to one recognition: mind itself is ultimate, free from elaboration.

The text lists vast quantities—hundreds of thousands of ślokas. All point to your own mind, recognizing itself. This is Dzogchen, the summit of all vehicles.

[3613-3692]
This mountain dweller once tried to count the teachings. Gave up at ten thousand. Then realized: every word, every letter, every sound of the teaching points to one thing—your own mind knowing itself.

The six divisions: elaborate presentations for minds that need structure. Yet each one dissolves into simple recognition: mind is ultimate, elaboration is mind's play, freedom is not achieved but recognized.

The summit of all vehicles—not a higher place but the recognition that there was never any hierarchy. Like realizing that all rivers flow to the same ocean, and the ocean was always where you stood.

The text's vast quantities—hundreds of thousands of ślokas—are not excessive but generous. Like a grandmother offering food: more than needed, given from abundance, expressing love through quantity when words fail.

Therefore. Thus. The Mind Section establishes: various minds appear, mind's nature is clear, yet mind is not the final word. Like using a thorn to remove a thorn, then discarding both. The teaching points beyond itself.

This completes the overview of the nine vehicles, with special emphasis on the three inner tantras—Mahāyoga's generation and completion, Anuyoga's instantaneous and gradual, Atiyoga's self-perfection. Each vehicle appropriate to capacity, all leading to the same recognition: your own mind, naturally free, primordially pure, spontaneously present.
