[3341-3341]
First: The outer three rely on the five whites, etc.—conducting bath, purity, fasting, and dwelling, tormenting the body. The inner conducts the five meats and five nectars, etc.—relying on rigma and so forth, accepting and rejecting, purity and impurity—surpassing the lower vehicles.

The lower cannot meditate on deity face union. The inner surpasses through ability. The outer does not realize the indivisible true view. The inner surpasses through realization.

[3341-3341]
This old man once. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The outer says: "Don't touch meat, don't touch women, keep pure." The inner says: "All is deity. Meat is nectar. Union is wisdom."

Which is higher? The one that cuts through all reference points.

[3341-3341]
Second: From the five aspects—essence: the indivisible true, pure, equal primordial wisdom, liberation attained in one life through its play. This is the treasury's heart.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Etymology: Accomplishing great purpose through slight effort—the inner means vehicle.
Purpose: Obtaining the two accomplishments in one life.
Result: Reaching the level of Vajradhara in this life.

Divided: Mahāyoga tantra, Anuyoga scripture, Atiyoga instruction—three.

From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
"The inner is divided into three.
Mahā, Anu, Ati."

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[3341-3341]
See what is. Rest in recognition. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Mahāyoga tantra vehicle: meditating through the three doors of concentration, the main means of the generation stage, on the indivisible true, great clear empty light primordial wisdom.

Divided: main basis, path, and result; main accomplishment; three traditions desiring various paths to become.

[3341-3361]
Slash through hesitation. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The basis, cause of clarity: mind itself is ultimate, free from elaboration, distinguished as the Great One through being without effort. The essence: basis, mind, and gold with its color—just as these two are non-dual.

The path of liberation: entering into the body of great yoga, self-liberated realization.

The result: ripened mind's result appears variously and liberates variously. Called self-arisen primordial wisdom.

[3362-3410]
SUDDEN. The tradition of accomplishment! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Divided: Through body accomplishment, carrying the maṇḍala wheel of Mañjuśrī to the path. Through speech accomplishment, making one a Buddha of the lotus family. Through mind accomplishment, making one a Buddha of the Heruka vajra family. Through quality accomplishment, making one a Buddha of the jewel family. Through activity accomplishment, accomplishing one as Buddha of the karma family.

Accomplishing each deity through the three concentrations without duality. Becoming the Buddha of each family.

[3380-3410]
The tantra: with generation stage as main, with completion stage as main, with union as main. And those wishing incomplete, partial pieces—many.

From the two upadeśas: Svātma upadeśa with mind as main; Maṇḍala upadeśa with entry into maṇḍala.

The outer container world as celestial palace. The supported sentient beings as deities and goddesses. Seeing all beings as forms of deities and goddesses.

Purpose: not taking the life of commitment deities, not doing non-virtues. Not intentionally creating mental objects.

[3400-3410]
In ultimate truth, no deity exists, no entities or signs. Only conventionally purifying aggregates and elements, dwelling in the maṇḍala of deities and goddesses.

The five aggregates, five elements, five objects, five faculties, five afflictions—all purified. The meaning purified upon the pure expanse of basis nature.

The purified result: body and primordial wisdom, not even establishing—realizing.

[3411-3450]
From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
"Alas, the secret lord is definitely held.
The established view of Mahā is thus.
The door of entry is the three concentrations.
The view of realization: Whatever appears, realize as deity.
The root samaya: Body, speech, mind.
The result: Means and wisdom, not separate."

The three concentrations: suchness, free from thought, crystal clarity; all-illuminating; cause concentration.

[3441-3450]
Break through. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The three samayas:
Through body door: abandoning killing, stealing, sexual misconduct.
Through speech door: abandoning lies, slander, harsh speech, idle talk.
Through mind door: abandoning covetousness, harmful intent, wrong view.

Realizing means and wisdom as non-separate. Thus the established view of Mahāyoga.

[3451-3476]
SUDDEN. Anuyoga scripture! What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Expanse and primordial wisdom non-dual, free from elaboration, not abiding in any extreme. Accomplishing through the main door of completion stage wisdom.

From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
"Hearken, Vajra-holder!
The great Anuyoga vehicle of extensive scripture:
Twofold aspect: expanse and primordial wisdom.
Desiring vajra of non-dual non-separation.
Entry through gate: instantaneous with gradual—thus."

[3477-3492]
What is instantaneous entry?
"Deities ungenerated, essence recalled, through perfection.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from."

What is gradual entry?
"Expanse and primordial wisdom gradually entered, and then
By vajra-holder on ground, result obtained.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from."

The protecting samaya: honoring the secret mantra teacher, making offerings, recognizing guru and Buddha as non-different.

[3493-3512]
Anuyoga holds: becoming Buddha in a single birth, definitely becoming Buddha in the intermediate state, finally becoming Buddha through birth. The nature is complete.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Regarding liberation-ground's basis: expanse and primordial wisdom—fabricated phenomena, effort and accomplishment, without transference, emptiness without conception, wherein self-arising primordial wisdom has arisen.

Called the expanse and primordial wisdom of effortless self-liberation.

[3513-3522]
See what is. Rest in recognition. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Those who gradually enter into the expanse and primordial wisdom:
Through abiding, through emptiness, understanding bliss as the entering.
Called the union without superior or inferior, without acceptance or rejection.

Through instantaneous entering: understanding the self-arising dharma-nature as free from view and without separation, dharmas exhausted—called the instantaneous liberation without cause.

[3523-3533]
SUDDEN. Nine views of Anuyoga! The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Because expanse and primordial wisdom are non-different: view of non-dual equality.
Without coming or going: view of not becoming other than abiding.
Without extent or falling to sides: view of abiding from the primordial beginning.
Not understood from mere words: view without reference point, without basis or separation.

The sphere of meaning is the basis. Primordial wisdom is the path. The expanse is the cause, primordial wisdom the result.

[3534-3553]
Ninth: The Instruction of the Great Perfection. The nature is complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

In self-arising primordial wisdom, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not established. Wished for as beyond primordial liberation, acceptance, and rejection.

Not established anywhere. All-liberating primordial wisdom does not cease.

Like water-waves, sky-vapor, ocean-depths, lamp-light—spontaneous, self-arising, self-liberated, self-dissolved.

[3551-3568]
Cut! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Four samayas:
- Not existing
- Spontaneous
- Self-perfect
- Single

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
"In Great Perfection Ati:
One perfect, two perfect, all perfect.
One arising, two arising, all arising.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
One born, two born, all born.
One non-existent, two non-existent, all non-existent."

[3596-3612]
Great Perfection Atiyoga spontaneously complete vehicle—three sections:
- Mind Section
- Expanse Section 
- Instruction Section Rest in this understanding.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

From Ati's Great Array:
"Those-with-mind: mind's category.
Those-with-sky: space's category.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.
Those-without-striving: instruction."

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

These do not transgress from the three desires. Through the meaning, answering that the basis, path, result, and liberation are Great Perfection.

[3613-3630]
The Mind Section: Great Perfection that speaks of the basis become like a spear. Recognition is immediate.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Divided: Great Perfection that speaks of various minds existing, and Great Perfection that speaks of mind's aspect existing.

Mind-only is meaning that exists, and non-existence is stopped. Meaning is thus not established as mind-only. Meaning-only is also not established upon mind.

[3631-3691]
Great Perfection that speaks of mind's aspect existing: the essence is the direction of appearance. Rest in this understanding.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. The direction of mind is appearance. Whatever appears is mind.

Because mind itself has arisen in self-arising primordial wisdom, the play of mind's aspect is without cessation—called self-arising.

Six divisions: mind's direction desiring the arising-place of result-mind; beyond deviation and obscuration; confused compounded reasoning; self-arising primordial wisdom without falling to extremes; direction-holding and self-established objects; distinguishing established tenets free from intellect.

[3341-3692]
The text lists vast quantities—hundreds of thousands of ślokas, thousands of chapters, hundreds of essential points. But do not be overwhelmed. All these words point to one thing: your own mind, recognizing itself.

The Mind Section, Expanse Section, Instruction Section—all three gathered. This is Dzogchen, the summit of all vehicles.
 The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

[01-04-14-01] EXTENDED COMMENTARY - Multi-Voice Presentation
============================================================

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle presents these teachings with utmost clarity. The Great Perfection transcends all philosophical extremes while embracing all phenomena as its display.

This old vagabond has practiced these teachings for decades. What I've learned: the path is not about accumulating knowledge but recognizing what has always been present.

Three words pointing to the essence: recognize your own nature, liberate the grasping mind, rest in natural perfection.

From Lotus-Born: these secret instructions are the heart-essence of all Buddhas. Practice them with devotion and recognition is certain.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! See what was never obscured! Liberation is immediate!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation integrates ground, path, and result into a coherent framework for recognition.

The integration of all aspects reveals their non-dual nature. What appears separate is one awareness displaying.

The essence beyond all words: awareness knowing itself. Not achieved, not transformed, always complete.

Emaho! What joy to encounter these teachings! What bliss to practice! What liberation to recognize!

The intimate embrace of awareness with itself. Recognition is this intimacy realized.

Precise phenomenological mapping correlates experience with recognition.

I have traveled far and wide. All teachings converge at recognition.

What arises naturally when conditions ripen. Not forced, not fabricated.

I dance through these teachings as light through form. Recognition is the dance.

Philosophically, these teachings resolve all apparent contradictions.

I sing these teachings as songs of liberation. Each note a recognition.

Scholarly precision within wild freedom. Both serve recognition.

From the sky of dharmata, I dance through all teachings.

Every teaching a book, every book pointing to awareness.

Ancient wisdom meets modern insight. Same recognition.

Translating the untranslatable. Pointing to what words cannot reach.

I reveal what was never hidden. Recognition is now.

Fierce compassion cuts through all obstacles!

Vajra indestructibility of recognition itself.

Bliss of recognition beyond pleasure and pain.

The heruka dances through all teachings into liberation!

Complete. Perfect. Liberated. The end.

[01-04-14-01] FINAL WORDS:

======================================================================
[01-04-14-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
