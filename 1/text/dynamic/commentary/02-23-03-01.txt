[12522-12530]
External conditions are merely helpers—the true practice is internal. This is the treasury's heart.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[12522-12535]
Grasping without support, sky-like nature, self-liberated vastness. Without support, ye-re! Spontaneous, zangthal! Without truth, bun-ne! Beyond root, khre-se! In great dharmata's equal nature, smile with joy, gle-ge! Resting thus, inner grasping mind's stake is extracted—this has purpose! When object-mind are recognized baseless rootless

[12531-12555]
Whether you practice for three years or seven, whether the signs arise quickly or slowly, do not be attached to progress. The path itself is the result. Every moment of recognition is complete in itself.

[12536-12560]
: secret self-awareness free from grasping-fixation elaboration goes. Rigpa self-clear ka-dag great, guru's instruction introduces, four lamps cause space-awareness non-separation, clear light nature meditating.

Outer space's appearing self-radiance's five lights clear

[12556-12580]
When obstacles arise, recognize them as displays. When good experiences arise, recognize them as displays.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. When nothing arises, recognize that as the display of emptiness.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. In all cases, the recognition is what matters.

[12561-12580]
—like mirror's reflections, appearing externally but essence internally dwelling. Appearance-emptiness like moon in water—know thus! Do not attachment-grasp to appearances.

Looking at outer appearance's clear light

[12581-12605]
The great masters of the past achieved liberation through this practice. You have the same nature as them, the same potential. What they achieved, you can achieve. Have confidence in this!

[12581-12600]
: inner rigpa's clear light is clear back. Rigpa free from meditation-concept's antidote, vast view of natural clarity; resting in natural presence's clear meditation; clear light conduct without accepting-rejecting; ka-dag self-clear result found.

Without abandoning confused appearance, it is abandoned; without blocking confused thought, it ceases; without training duality, it is purified; faults without abandoning are pure from ka; qualities without seeking are spontaneously accomplished.

Emaho!

[12601-12620]
: view beyond view's object, meditation beyond meditation's mind, conduct beyond conduct's calculation, result beyond result's phenomena. Samsara expelling's fortune, dharmata manifest appearance's pure land wide, joy's source good country, nine desires' self-arising palace found.

Original protector King Unchanging Light

[12606-12630]
Yet do not think 'I will become a great siddha!' This too is delusion. Simply practice with sincerity, and let the result take care of itself. The fruit of the practice is not for you—it is for the benefit of all beings.

[12621-12640]
and five lights' spontaneous presence queen gathered, supreme boy light inconceivable meeting his own parents—this is called the time of joy-bliss inseparable's eternal fortune. Rest in this understanding.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

These extensively taught before

[12631-12655]
When you achieve stability in this practice, you can help others. Your mere presence becomes a blessing. Your words become dharma. Your actions become benefit for beings. This is the true result.

Emaho!

[12641-12660]
; now specifically: Sun and Moon Union states, "Listen Sugata! These are all included, obtaining one abiding thigle." What is that? Placing various, self-arrived; intentions show timing; exhaustion shows intention; stable confidence non-reversing signs.

Thus matters are included

[12656-12680]
You who have read this far, you have great merit. These teachings are the secret essence of the great perfection, precious beyond measure. Cherish them!

[12661-12680]
: space's lamp who sees directly practices dharmadhatu; thigle's lamp who sees obtains support of all with effort; wisdom's lamp who sees realizes general and specific characteristics; water's lamp who sees obtains power over faculties. Recognition is immediate.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Who matures vajra chain

[12681-12705]
In degenerate times, when beings are caught in distraction and delusion, this practice of thod rgal is like a lightning path. Swift, direct, and powerful—it can carry you to awakening in one lifetime.

[12681-12700]
: rigpa arrives at the capital. The result: these three kayas are self-awareness's ground. Nature-abiding bardo who matures these, all elements self-exhaust, changing without doubt.

Emaho!

[12701-12720]
—clearing unclear like a beautiful woman mirror-looking—eight aspects: certain death causes with examples, death signs investigation, reversal methods, death-point appearances, crucial pointing-out instructions, birth-place signs, purification rituals, uncommon other places. The nature is complete.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

First

[12706-12730]
Do not delay your practice. Life is short and uncertain. The time to practice is now, while you have the favorable conditions of a human body and the precious teachings.

[12721-12750]
: difficult to obtain Jambudvipa as Dharma-practicing place, obtained; difficult to obtain leisure and endowments, obtained; difficult to meet guru good spiritual friend, met; difficult to enter sublime Dharma precious door, entered; difficult to know unsurpassed instructions unfabricated, known; difficult to abandon samsara suffering's ocean, abandoned to go to liberation enlightenment's island—if not practiced now with effort and courage, outer such favorable conditions will not occur again. Rest in this understanding.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Nagarjuna's statement

[12731-12755]
Every moment of recognition is a moment of liberation. Rest in this understanding.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. Every moment of delusion is a moment of samsara.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. Choose recognition! Rest in your true nature!

[12751-12770]
: "Dwelling in favorable place, relying on holy beings, oneself well-prayed, previous virtues arise—you possess the four great wheels." Shantideva: "This leisure is extremely difficult to obtain; for one who has accomplished purpose, if not diligent now, when will favorable conditions arise again?"

From the Treasury

[12756-12778]
The displays of light are beautiful, the pure lands are magnificent, but do not be seduced by them. They are merely the path, not the destination.

[12771-12778]
: having obtained such leisure, if not diligent now, the dead go to lower realms; for kalpas numbering billions, even happy realms' sound is not heard—what need to speak of obtaining happiness? The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[02-23-03-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


[Section] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

[Section] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

[Section] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

[Section] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

[Section] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

[Section] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

[Section] Voice 08 (Integrator): The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

[Section] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

[Section] Voice 12 (Ecstatic): Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

[Section] Voice 04 (Consort): The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
