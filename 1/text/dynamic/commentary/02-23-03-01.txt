[12522-12530]
External conditions are merely helpers—the true practice is internal. This is the treasury's heart.

From the same source: reflections in the sky's space change and disperse, the moon's form without—this is death. Limbs losing strength—four months. Above that, head drooping—three months. Upper and lower loosening—two months. Contracted into ball—one month. Know that time!

The connecting thread between sky and earth—if cut, cannot survive nineteen days. From Mount Meru's side, if white lioness doesn't descend, undoubtedly sixteen days. If at mountain-plain boundary, wish-fulfilling tree trunk breaks—these too wise ones examine. If ocean water's surface disperses, this too wise ones analyze in stages.

Patrul Rinpoche's direct instruction: Don't panic when you see these signs in your meditation or dreams. They indicate that death is approaching, yes, but they also indicate that preparation is possible. The time frames given are guidelines, not certainties. Practice reversal methods. Gather accumulations. Purify obstacles. Death can be averted, or it can become the great opportunity for liberation.

[12531-12555]
Grasping without support, sky-like nature, self-liberated vastness. Without support, ye-re! Spontaneous, zangthal! Without truth, bun-ne! Beyond root, khre-se! In great dharmata's equal nature, smile with joy, gle-ge! Resting thus, inner grasping mind's stake is extracted—this has purpose! When object-mind are recognized baseless rootless

Mountain hermit's teaching: I watched my teacher examine the death signs in a disciple. The young man had the limb weakness, the head drooping, the shortened time frames. "You will die in one month," my teacher said. The disciple practiced reversal methods day and night. He lived three more years. The signs were accurate; the result was changed. This is the power of practice.

In earth's cities, if monk's vapor is cut, dies in nine days. On Mount Meru's peak, if unchanging sun sets, dies in three days. Abandoning elaborate rituals, examine self-recognition heart essence meaning. From Mount Meru's interior, if dakini's sound is cut—thirteen or five days. If from wish-fulfilling tree, Lord of Death's demon arises—undoubtedly seven days. This doesn't help; familiarity with emptiness is crucial.

[12556-12580]
Whether you practice for three years or seven, whether the signs arise quickly or slowly, do not be attached to progress. The path itself is the result. Every moment of recognition is complete in itself.

Second, common signs: from the same source, if limb and nail's color is lost, undoubtedly nine months. If person's eye's surface disperses, likewise five months. If Lord of Death Yama arises, dies in twenty-one days. Nothing helps this. If foot's heel protrudes outward, likewise one month. If seeing others' bodies, when person is struck by disease, tooth roots having pus, dies in nine days. Likewise various—five days, likewise dies. Limbs repeatedly moving and contracting—seven days. Eyes having cataract looking—three days, tröpa. Eye's joints very confused—half month. Cheek's channel cut—likewise nineteen days.

[12581-12605]
When obstacles arise, recognize them as displays. When good experiences arise, recognize them as displays.

When nothing arises, recognize that as the display of emptiness.

Person doing life constituents, breath stacked and agitated—six months. Nose's muscle cut—dies in seven days. Eye's carna cut—dies in five days. Left cheek's flesh lost—dies in one day. Upper and lower teeth clenched—undoubtedly three days. Black bindu arises on tongue—dies in two days. Ear attached to head—dies that evening. Chest's lower part collapsed—undoubtedly half month. Sleep's root without—half month.

Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: All these signs, all these time frames—they're like a weather forecast. Useful for planning, but not absolute. I've seen people with every death sign live for years through pure devotion. I've seen people with no signs die suddenly. Don't be obsessed with the signs. Be obsessed with practice.

[12606-12630]
Yet do not think 'I will become a great siddha!' This too is delusion. Simply practice with sincerity, and let the result take care of itself. The fruit of the practice is not for you—it is for the benefit of all beings.

Third, showing reversal methods: gathering accumulations in special fields, performing elements' dependent origination wheels, deceiving demons with ransom—three ways to reverse even exhausted life.

From the same source: when such signs arise in body, explained rituals for deceiving death. Beginning person's reversal action—self lama sangha, gathering accumulations in special fields, pleasing with gifts and feasts, beginning these rituals.

[12631-12655]
When you achieve stability in this practice, you can help others. Your mere presence becomes a blessing. Your words become dharma. Your actions become benefit for beings. This is the true result.

For equalizing elements' sounds, on palm leaf, elements' five wheels with four spokes center rim, earth water fire space wind's wheels making five, colors distinguished by elements, on hub spokes and five, respective five letters, surrounded by ali group at rim. Thus drawing wheels, offering, praising, purifying confession, each requesting what is desired. Meditating elements' deity at center, infusing letter's numbers, then in covered skullcup, inserting all wheels, binding cross with five colored threads. Wood, water, fire, earth, different type breaths, mixing all with dough and relics, making form one arm-span. Five letters on five senses, writing on paper, putting in rolled cloth.

[12656-12680]
You who have read this far, you have great merit. These teachings are the secret essence of the great perfection, precious beyond measure. Cherish them!

This restores exhausted elements. If seized by demon, changing color to person's years, mixing self dirty clothes, likewise element substances, with dough making forms. Decorating those forms with cotton, silk, feathers. Suitable tormas also thus. Finally, surrounding dough form with yoga years, consecrating, saying these words: "Take, take, powerful ones! Attachment, desire, fixation, memory, grasping, thought, contact—release, pacify, liberate!" Saying these words three times, then sending in river's channel. For reversing from death, undoubtedly, Naragun."

[12681-12705]
In degenerate times, when beings are caught in distraction and delusion, this practice of thod rgal is like a lightning path. Swift, direct, and powerful—it can carry you to awakening in one lifetime.

Fourth, showing death-point appearances: each element dissolving time, channels winds disturbed appearances—when earth dissolves into earth, body heavy, unable to rise. When water into water, mouth and nose water flows out, then drying. When fire into fire, body's edge four directions heat dissipates, complexion and glow withdraw. When wind into wind, breath not stacked, body's strength lost.

From Sun Moon Union: earth dissolves into earth, likewise water, fire, and wind, each self-dissolving into self, thus comes to person's body. Earth dissolving into self, body heavy, not taking food, rising and going strength all lost.

[12706-12730]
Do not delay your practice. Life is short and uncertain. The time to practice is now, while you have the favorable conditions of a human body and the precious teachings.

Water dissolving into water, mouth nose's water flows. Likewise fire dissolving into fire, mouth nose very dry, body's edge heats dissipate. Likewise wind dissolving into wind, breath gasping, limbs trembling, eyes also rolling upward.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: This dissolution—don't fear it! It's natural. You've dissolved into sleep every night. You've dissolved into orgasm. You've dissolved into deep meditation. This is just a deeper dissolution. Recognize it. Rest in it. Liberate through it.

[12731-12750]
Fifth, pointing-out instructions at death has three: excellent—resting awareness in its own place in great expanse; middling—training transference; last—depending on other conditions.

First: yogis dying alone, if dissolving non-dual in clear light appearance, at that time not depending on others, by self-appearance's clarity, without distraction from that state, in any body posture of three or cross-legged or lion's lying, placing awareness in expanse-awareness, if dying, instantly liberates into upper zangthal, no dharmata bardo.

From the same source: at that time, fortunate person's appearance itself self-clear, awareness without abiding, resting in own place. With lion posture, placing rigpa itself in eyes, making mind space path, if expanse and rigpa not changing, that person without bardo, undoubtedly becomes Buddha, dying breath also slow.

[12751-12770]
Those familiar with expanse-rigpa, dying in snow mountains or caves or among people without distraction conditions, is crucial. From Peaceful Deities: "Standing nearby, whoever, no one makes sorrow, by this Buddha's memory, etc., no one becomes distracted." As said.

Second is training transference as previously shown. When consciousness-wind enters, time to raise life-wind from heart, is time. Thus from heart, self lama's form whatever color, with seven or twenty-one HIK sounds, shooting through Brahma aperture, instantly liberates into kadag ground.

From Sun Moon Union: when four winds gradually cease, great wind moves, etc., consciousness riding wind, training wind, this previously familiarized is crucial. Gathering and shooting rigpa is crucial, this is shooting with HIK. This reaches lama's face.

[12771-12790]
When rigpa's wisdom wind-consciousness enters, instructions clearly point here. From the same source: at that time, lama's instructions, familiarize in own continuum, these meanings also clearly point.

Transference at breath cessation, entering object and place is transference. Entering form and wisdom is expanse-rigpa instruction, two. In expanse-rigpa also, familiarized without depending on other conditions, and depending, two explained, therefore this is place where instruction's three forms arise.

Third, depending on other conditions: at that time, by lama or vajra sibling or someone with unbroken samaya, clearly pointing, also similar to present clear light messenger, dharmata bardo clear light reverse, therefore connecting these two, showing expanse-rigpa messenger-like appearance, saying: "Son of family, this present clear light is self-arisen wisdom itself, rest mind uncontrived in this state, and you become Buddha in upper zangthal."

[12791-12810]
This old fool's final instruction: I've seen many die. Some with preparation, most without. The ones who recognized the clear light at death—they died with a smile. The ones who panicked, who clung, who feared—they died with struggle. Practice now. Prepare now. The bardo is not a place for beginners.

Mountain hermit's deathbed: My teacher died while I held him. He said nothing for three days. Then: "It's all appearance. Don't be afraid." He smiled and stopped breathing. For three days, his body remained warm at the heart. We knew he was in clear light. On the fourth day, the warmth moved upward. On the fifth, gone. Liberated? We believe so. But what matters is his instruction: "Don't be afraid."

[12811-12830]
Singing yogi's gentle song:

The elements dissolve like snow in spring
Earth sinks, water flows, fire cools, wind stills
Don't cling to the body that's dissolving
Don't fear the mind that's clarifying

This is the moment you've practiced for
The clear light dawning like sunrise
Rest in it naturally, don't try to hold
Don't try to push away—just be

Lama's face appears in the heart
Shoot upward with HIK if you can
Or rest in the recognition of what is
Either way, liberation is certain

This old vagabond sings his last
Practice now, don't wait for death
Death comes to all, prepared or not
Recognition is the only preparation

[12831-12850]
Essence holder's spacious conclusion: Whether you die with elaborate rituals or alone in a cave, whether surrounded by masters or by strangers, the recognition is what matters. The clear light appears for all. Those who recognize it are liberated. Those who don't enter bardo. Practice recognition now, in every moment, so that it will be automatic at death.

The three jewels, the three roots, the clear light nature—all are present at death. Don't look for them outside. Don't wish for better conditions. Use what is. Recognize what is. Liberate through what is.

[12851-End]
COMPLETE PRACTICAL APPLICATION:

The death signs and bardo instructions in this text are not theoretical. They are practical guidance for actual death—your own or others'.

When you see death signs:
1. Don't panic. They indicate time remaining, not certain doom.
2. Practice reversal methods—accumulations, elements wheels, ransom rituals.
3. If reversal fails, prepare for death—practice recognition, rest in view.
4. At death, apply pointing-out instructions—recognize clear light, transference if needed, lama's face.

When helping others die:
1. Don't cry or show sorrow. It distracts them.
2. Remind them of their practice, their lama, the clear light.
3. Give pointing-out instructions clearly and repeatedly.
4. After death, maintain supportive conditions—don't disturb the body, pray.

Patrul Rinpoche's final advice: Death is certain. Time of death is uncertain. What helps at death is dharma. Practice dharma now. Don't wait. Don't delay. This is the essential point of all death signs and bardo instructions.

The Treasury of Supreme Vehicle presents these teachings so that death becomes an opportunity rather than a tragedy. May all beings recognize the clear light at death. May all be liberated in the Dharmakaya that was never bound.

This old fool has said everything about death signs and bardo pointing-out. The signs are many. The methods are many. But the recognition is one. Rest in that oneness.

Look. See. Rest.

Complete.

The mani wall by the charnel ground stands witness to thousands of deaths. Each stone placed by someone grieving, hoping, praying. The wall grows but doesn't judge. The vultures circle but don't celebrate. Death is natural. Liberation is possible. Practice is the bridge.

Walk that bridge now, while you can. Don't wait for the death signs to appear. Don't wait for the bardo to begin. Recognize your nature now, in this moment, and every moment becomes the clear light, every breath becomes transference, every thought becomes recognition.

This is the supreme instruction. This is the heart of the treasury. This is what all the signs point to.

Om ah hum. May all beings be liberated.
