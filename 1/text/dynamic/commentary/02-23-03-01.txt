External conditions are merely helpers—the true practice is internal. This is the treasury's heart.

From the same source: reflections in the sky's space change and disperse, the moon's form without—this is death. Limbs losing strength—four months. Above that, head drooping—three months. Upper and lower loosening—two months. Contracted into ball—one month. Know that time!

The connecting thread between sky and earth—if cut, cannot survive nineteen days. From Mount Meru's side, if white lioness doesn't descend, undoubtedly sixteen days. If at mountain-plain boundary, wish-fulfilling tree trunk breaks—these too wise ones examine. If ocean water's surface disperses, this too wise ones analyze in stages.

 Don't panic when you see these signs in your meditation or dreams. They indicate that death is approaching, yes, but they also indicate that preparation is possible. The time frames given are guidelines, not certainties. Practice reversal methods. Gather accumulations. Purify obstacles. Death can be averted, or it can become the great opportunity for liberation.
