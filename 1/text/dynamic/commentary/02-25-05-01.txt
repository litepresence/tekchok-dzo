Beyond holding to entity limits, without birth, death, transference, or change. Ultimate directly manifesting, suchness beyond thought. This is pointing to the unfindable nature. Look for yourself—can you find the "thing" that's aware? Can you point to awareness? You can't! Yet it's undeniable. This unfindability is not a problem to solve—it's liberation itself!

Second: Dharmakaya pervading all samsara and nirvana, possessing the two purities—pure of adventitious stains. From Hevajra: "Sentient beings are Buddha, only obscured by adventitious stains. Once removed, they are Buddha." And from Uttaratantra: "Perfect Buddha-body because it radiates, because suchness is undifferentiable, because of possessing potential—therefore all beings always possess Buddha-nature."

Emaho! What news! You're not becoming Buddha—you ARE Buddha, just temporarily obscured like the sun behind clouds. The clouds aren't the sun's nature, and your confusion isn't your nature. Remove the obscuration, and what's left? Buddha! Not a new acquisition, but recognition of what's always been!

Third: Shown as aspects of awareness, emptiness, qualities, etc., according to respective vehicles. In this great complete perfection, if divided by display: Dharmakaya's Dharmakaya fields beyond thought. Suchness abiding beyond thought and expression. Great unmoving samadhi. Circle manifold, nature non-dual. Teaching unspeakable suchness. Suchness unchanging at any time.

Dharmakaya's Sambhogakaya fields, free from dust, stainless. Abode memory and mental thought self-dissolved. Samadhi, mind and mental factors' experience ceased, pristine awareness self-abiding.

Do you see? Every possible description still doesn't capture it. Yet these "fields" and "qualities" are not far away—they're the display of your own rigpa, right now, manifesting as the world you perceive!

Continuing with the third body—this is crucial, so listen closely! "Empty circle self-appearance as agent"—this means the mandala-circle is empty yet appears, and this appearance is self-arising, performing its own function without anyone doing it. The teaching is completely pure of observed objects. Not established by time, therefore great equal great expansive!

Do you see? This is not a creation by some deity. The mandala appears spontaneously from the nature (rang bzhin) of reality itself. Like a rainbow appearing in the sky—no one paints it, yet it's vividly there. This is how Sambhogakaya manifests: self-arising, self-sustaining, without any external cause or creator!

Now the Nirmanakaya of Dharmakaya—the Emanation Body emerging from the Body of Reality! Field and realm, emptiness without break or limit. Abiding as the great self-radiance of the clear depth of the ground (gzhi)-appearance of all abodes. Samadhi without cessation, self-clear. Circle without hierarchy, pure appearance-manifestation. Teaching unaltered nature. Time appearing as the essence itself.

This is describing how the Buddha appears in the world—not by leaving some heaven and traveling here, but as the spontaneous display of the ground (gzhi) itself. Like the sun's rays naturally illuminating everything without the sun deciding to shine. The Nirmanakaya is not a downgrade from Dharmakaya—it's Dharmakaya's own self-expression!

These are all designated from the aspect of Dharmakaya as primordially pure self-abiding. From Ratnakuta (the Heap of Jewels):
"By Dharmakaya self-pure of grasping, in the measureless pure of elaboration, to the appearance-circle not different from itself, by signless speech, words without elaboration, released self-dissolved non-abiding, emerge from mind. Without speaking, without spoken, in the state of great equality demonstrated."

This verse is profound! It describes how teaching occurs without a teacher, how words appear without being spoken, how manifestation happens without leaving the nature (rang bzhin). Don't think of three bodies as three different things—it's one awareness showing three faces like a jewel reflecting differently in different lights!

These too are merely designated aspects—in reality, nowhere established, abiding as great completely perfect free from extremes. Again from that same source:
"This abode is called 'this'—the object with characteristics famous as names. Since appearance-form nowhere manifests, from the emptiness of non-existence, dharmodaya, in the great secret self-expanse, primordially abiding, without apprehending, as the mode of abiding, great play primordially emerged. In this, no one abides. By nothing made as abode. In this, no perfections. Free from abiding and coming. Thus the place of great primordial emptiness. From non-existence, the expanse-grove. In this, neither outside nor inside. Looking above and below—nothing. In directions and intermediate points—nothing. In this, not the slightest thing to grasp."

Emaho! What liberation! Longchenpa is demolishing every place you might try to stand. No abode, no inside or outside, no directions, nothing to grasp. This isn't nihilism—it's the freedom of recognizing that the nature (rang bzhin) transcends all location and limitation. You're not "in" the nature (rang bzhin)—the nature (rang bzhin) is what you are!

Fourth: Extensive explanation of enumerations. From the five—body, speech, mind, qualities, activity—Dharmakaya's body: empty, clear, signless. Speech: beyond expression, sound, words. Mind: free from memory, thought, elaboration.

Don't compartmentalize! These are not separate departments in a cosmic bureaucracy. Body is emptiness-clarity, speech is spontaneous expression, mind is unobstructed awareness—all three are your own nature, right now, if you would just stop looking elsewhere!

Listen here! Longchenpa is completing the discussion of Dharmakaya—the Body of Reality. Look at what he's saying: the qualities never reverse, never change, never transform! And the activity? It arises spontaneously, without cessation, abiding as the ground (gzhi) itself. This isn't some philosophical abstraction—this is describing your own nature!

The quote from Thal 'gyur (the consequence tradition) lays it out perfectly: Dharmakaya is body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity—all five! But don't mistake this for some cosmic administrator sitting on a throne. Body is emptiness, clarity, and signless nature. Speech is free from sound, words, and names—beyond all expression. Mind transcends thought and movement, beyond proliferation and analysis. Qualities are without coming or going, pervading expanse and pristine awareness, nature unalterable. Activity is unarisen, unborn, arising through dynamic energy without cessation, beyond created and uncreated.

Emaho! What a wonder! This is not describing something far away—this is pointing directly to what you are, right now, if you would only recognize it!

Now we turn to the second topic: Sambhogakaya, the Enjoyment Body, explained extensively. Longchenpa gives us the structure: essence, definition, divisions, and enumerations—four aspects.

The essence-characteristic is great self-clarity, completely perfect. The way it abides is unmoving in nature—manifesting marks and examples, clear in families, unmoving. This is not some static thing—it's vibrant, luminous, yet utterly stable.

The definition of Sambhogakaya: appearing as Sambhogakaya, engaging in that very appearance, knowledge without obstruction engaging—this is it. The body is great self-clarity, vast display. Don't make it complicated! This is the radiance of your own awareness, wearing the ornaments of luminosity.

Now the four divisions of Sambhogakaya:
1. The Body of Great Element Essence
2. The Body of All-Pervading Abiding
3.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. The Body of the Path of Appearance
4. The Body of Appearance for Trainees

The first: from the ground (gzhi)-appearance of Dharmakaya, self-arising, perfected as the body endowed with fivefold luminosity—this is the nature (rang bzhin) of ground-appearance as great elements: clarity-warmth, coolness, expansiveness, pervasiveness. Don't think this is physics! These are wisdom qualities, not material elements. The warmth of compassion, the coolness of clarity, the expansiveness of space-like mind, the pervasiveness of benefitting all.

The second body: for all Buddhas and sentient beings alike, pervaded by light and light-dwellings, the portion manifesting. From Self-Arising: "Abiding as the heart of light for all, thought-free pure dharmadhatu, matchless sole unique one, center and circle and palace, awareness and emptiness and clarity."

This is describing the mandala of your own being! The palace is not somewhere in space—it's the space of your own awareness. The center is rigpa, the circle is its display, the palace is the dimension in which recognition occurs. Don't look for this in a thangka painting—look for it in the immediacy of your own experience!

Emaho! Like light filling a room the moment the lamp is lit, this body pervades all without effort or intention. What a wonder!

In the expanse of light and color: mandala, retinue, individual clusters, kaya, wisdom, father, mother, body color, hand emblems, and so forth, clear. Rest in this understanding.

Obstacles exist only for the one who thinks they need to overcome them.

The one seeking liberation is already liberated—just see clearly. From the Secret Seed Tantra:

"On essence's appearance,
Essence kaya arises.
Like self and reflection,
Three kayas luminosity emptiness.
Not permanent, not entity,
Not severed, luminosity kaya,
Not different, without outer/inner."

This describes the nature (rang bzhin) of sambhogakaya—appearing as forms, colors, mandalas, deities, yet empty, not permanent, not different from the nature (rang bzhin) of mind itself. Like a reflection in a mirror—clearly appearing, yet without inherent existence.

Fourth: sambhogakaya taming trainees, appearing individually as families and mandalas. Emanations divided, for trainees' power: sambhogakaya dharmakaya Vairochana Great Ocean. His manner of abiding: viewed from outside, inner clear; viewed from inside, outer clear; completely transparent, without front/back; from wherever viewed, appears showing face like that, face directions all pervading.

His pure realm: completely arranged ornament, holding sway over twenty-five world systems from lotus on palm.

Place: completely pure, thick arrangement.
Retinue: not different from himself.
Teaching: self-arisen wisdom self-appearance.

Ma rig pa ye shes su shar—delusion dawns as wisdom wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The text points beyond itself pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.
Time: realization manifestly arisen.

This is the description of Vairochana's pure realm—not a physical place, but a dimension of pure appearance, completely clear, without inside or outside, pervading all directions.

This self-appearance, though emanation from the perspective of looking at the primordial, is posited as sambhogakaya from the perspective of trainees looking at luminosity, perfect marks and signs. Rest in this understanding.

The one who seeks to understand dissolves in the seeing.

Delusion is wisdom's self-display—unrecognized wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Sambhogakaya's sambhogakaya: appearing as five family Buddhas' chiefs.

That itself's characteristic: essence different, nature one; measureless family mandalas of individual pure realms; place great Akanistha, five families of individual retinues; teaching engaging in five wisdoms of knowing; time: appearance taming expanding.

Sambhogakaya's nirmanakaya: five families' Buddhas and individual chief retinues.

That characteristic: appearance without nature, clear without conceptuality.

That pure realm: pure appearance enjoying devas and devis, inconceivable.

Place: Tushita, basis of wisdom arrangement.
Retinue: measureless Buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Time: time of awareness self-appearance.

The deluded mind is wisdom not recognizing itself wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Concepts point but cannot capture—mind's nature shines directly.

That also: not yaksha abiding Tushita.

This clarifies the distinction—sambhogakaya appears in Akanistha, not the ordinary Tushita heaven. This is the pure dimension of wisdom, not the worldly god realm.

Emaho! Pure realms of wisdom light!

Five families' pure realm appearances: pure by nature, self-clear appearance of five lights, engaging in great enjoyment as aspects of five wisdoms, free from all afflictions' pain. Rest in this understanding.

The treasury was never closed—full as emptiness.

Ma rig pa is ye shes in disguise—recognition reveals wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

These also, from the Ratnakuta:

"By self-clear pure sambhogakaya,
In five lights pure palace,
By speech of non-elaboration great bliss,
To five kaya families' retinues,
Non-entity pure dharmas,
From gathered five wisdoms mind, emerged,
Spread on tongue as pure light rays,
Also self-arisen six syllables,
Unspoken, shown as great self-arisen.

Longchenpa indicates what words cannot reach pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition arises in the space between—this very gap."

This is describing sambhogakaya—the enjoyment body of the Buddha. Not physical like nirmanakaya, not formless like dharmakaya, but appearing as light, as wisdom, in pure realms. The five lights are the five wisdoms. The teaching happens without words—through light, through wisdom, through spontaneous presence.

Sambhogakaya: because essence shows Dharma as symbols, without words, thus "unspoken." Trainees hearing the six syllables' self-sound is appearing as speech, like dream words. From the Longchenpa's Six Spaces:

"From his own mouth unspoken,
Like dream characteristic,
To retinue's bodhisattvas,
Appears in wisdom analytic mind."

The gap between thoughts is where recognition dawns.

The treasure was never hidden—whole without beginning.

This is profound! Sambhogakaya teaching isn't verbal—it's direct transmission through symbols, through light, through wisdom. The "six syllables" are the essence of all mantras, appearing spontaneously.

Fourth, extensive explanation of enumerations—from five: kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity. Recognition is immediate.

No lid to lift—finished before starting.

The one who divides is divided—seeing this is the teaching.

Sambhogakaya's kaya: like empty-luminous rainbow.

Speech: like dream, trainees' self-appearance.

Mind: wisdom possessing characteristics, without interruption.

Qualities: complete in marks, signs, light rays' heaps; speech appearing as self-arisen syllables' appearance; mind become treasure of clairvoyance and oceanic samadhi.

Enlightened activity: turning measureless Dharma wheels without interruption.

From the Thalgyur:

"Sambhogakaya also: kaya, speech, mind,
Qualities and enlightened activity, five aspects. Never hidden, the treasury shows itself, only overlooked.

Kaya: appearance without nature,
Clear and clear-maker, awareness pervading. Each phrase indicates the beyond.

The path seems long only to the one who has not recognized.

No key needed for an unlocked door—never incomplete.

Speech: self-arisen self-appearance,
Emanation-gathering aspects' wheel. The treasure was always in the open, only overlooked.

Recognition, not comprehension—awareness seeing itself.

Not something to understand—awareness recognizing itself.

Mind: without stream, seeing,
Knowing potency and intention. Language points past language.

Longchenpa shows what must be seen directly pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The classifier is classified—seeing this is the teaching.

Qualities: perfect marks and signs,
Intention-clear clairvoyance perfect." What seems to block the way IS the way, seen differently.

Delusion (ma rig pa) is wisdom's (ye shes) play wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

This completes the picture of sambhogakaya—not a physical body, but a body of light, teaching through symbols, benefiting advanced bodhisattvas continuously.

Emaho! Enjoyment body of wisdom light!

Essence, definitive terminology, division, enumeration—four. Essence: various, not fixed. Manner of abiding of that essence: free from attachment and fixation, samadhi mind non-conceptual nature, abiding evenly.

Definitive terminology: Emanating whatever tames whomever, thus "emanation." That itself, harmonious appearing form perfectly complete, thus "kaya."

Divided: common and uncommon systems—two. Common vehicle's famous three: from the Sutralankara:

"Craft and birth and supreme awakening—
Supreme awakening's emanation,
This Buddha emanation kaya,
Great method of liberation."

Making distinctions undoes the maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What seems difficult is only difficult for the one who seeks.

This describes nirmanakaya—the form body that appears to ordinary beings. Not fixed, not permanent, but appearing according to what's needed.

Craft: paintings and so forth. The very barrier is the gateway—gegs lam du khyer.

What appears as ignorance is awareness forgetting itself wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Beyond concept, awareness simply is—this is the showing.

Birth: Buddha emanating as various forms for beings—horses, great fish, and so forth.

Supreme awakening's emanation: twelve deeds. From the Gyud Lama:

"From dharmakaya not moving,
By emanation's nature various,
Birth manifest birth,
Transferring from Tushita abode,
Entering womb and birth,
Skilled in craft abodes,
Enjoying play with queen's retinue,
Leaving home difficult practice,
Going to awakening heart,
Defeating mara hosts, perfecting,
Awakening Dharma wheel,
Together with all gods,
Always showing parinirvana,
In impure realms,
Showing abiding as long as existence.

What appears difficult dissolves in recognition—immediately (cig car).

The pattern clears when viewed—before analysis, already complete."

These are the twelve deeds of the Buddha—emanations that appear according to the needs of beings, not bound by any fixed form or time.

In this uncommon vehicle: impure emanation kaya, taming beings' emanation kaya, nature emanation kaya—three. First: hunters, butchers, and so forth, emanations. This is profound!
