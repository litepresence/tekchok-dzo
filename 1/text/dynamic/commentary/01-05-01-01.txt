Three words. Tantra points. Pointing liberates.
The tantra of meaning—mind clear light, free from thought-stains. Not a book. Not words. The nature that was never born and will never die. Already complete before the first syllable was written.

[4172-4183]
Therefore. Thus. We classify to clear confusion, not to build new confusion. Two tantras emerge: meaning and word. Like the warp and weft depending on many threads to weave cloth into existence. Different words, one meaning extracted. The meaning tantra—mind itself, naturally clear light, abiding in all beings. The word tantra—names, words, letters, chapters, the method of indicating what cannot be indicated directly.

[4184-4203]
The rising measure of creation stage: ten aspects complete. First: basis empowerment and samaya—the foundation. Second: deity and mantra—the form and sound. Third: mandala and offering—the sacred space and gesture. Fourth: samadhi and conduct—the meditation and activity. Fifth: view and activity—the perspective and expression. Ten complete, yet where is the completer?

[4184-4203]
This old practitioner once tried to memorize all ten aspects. He could recite them in his sleep: empowerment, samaya, deity, mantra, mandala, offering, samadhi, conduct, view, activity. His tongue grew tired. His mind grew confused like a dog chasing its own tail. Then one winter morning grinding grain in a village water mill, he watched the wheel turn. Creation stage turning into completion stage—were they two? The grain became flour. The flour became bread. The eating became nourishment. Where was the separation? The wheel turned itself.

[4190-4203]
The rising measure of completion stage: eight aspects. View and fruition—seeing and becoming. Conduct and meditation—acting and abiding. Mind and wisdom—knowing and recognizing. Experience and instruction—tasting and pointing. Eight complete, yet the eighth dissolves the first seven into the ground (gzhi) from which they arose.

[4195-4203]
The non-dual union: both creation and completion must complete—eighteen aspects total. But eighteen is just a number. The completely perfect Great Perfection lies beyond all enumeration. From creation and completion, the completion sequence emerges naturally. Great completion shows the sequence of channels, winds, and bindu, and the sequence of clear light wisdom—two aspects pointing to what has no aspect.

[4204-4209]
Valid: tantra dwelling in self, indicating. Like weaving cloth from many threads, depending on warp and weft. Valid because the meaning dwells within you, not in books. Depending on the key of words, bringing meaning to certainty without error, making it realized.

[4210-4231]
From the treasury of method: awareness pervading all beings, the mind of enlightenment. Definite term: indicating meaning, realizing basis, liberating method. Divided: emptiness and clarity. Emptiness—awareness's nature, empty of things and marked dharmas, primordially dwelling in great liberation from elaboration. Not gone to any extreme of emptiness. Clarity—self-illuminating five wisdoms' appearance, warm and cool and light, vast nature's five elements, spontaneously accomplished, compassion's tone unceasing.

[4210-4231]
Three words. Emptiness. Clarity. Union. The two are not two. Like ice and water—the ice appears solid, the water flows, yet both are H₂O. The appearance does not contradict the emptiness. The emptiness does not deny the appearance. This is the Great Perfection's key point.

[4172-4231]
Between the systematic classification of tantras and the direct recognition of your nature, Longchenpa weaves the treasury. Not rejecting method tantra. Not grasping nature tantra. The warp and weft create the cloth, but the cloth is not the wearing. The words point, but the moon is not the finger. The eighteen aspects complete, yet completion has never been incomplete. Creation and completion are one wheel turning. Rest in that recognition.

[4231]
This practitioner has ground enough grain. The mill wheel turns whether the grain understands turning or not. Creation and completion are one movement, one recognition, one rest. The tantra is already tantra. You are already complete. Rest here.

[4200-4231]
The Great Perfection tantras are instruction tantras—not showing elaborate sequences, but pointing directly to effortless primordial liberation. Divided: showing without effort through primordial liberation, and showing with effort through sequence. Both complete, yet the complete has never needed completion.

[4231]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. The enumeration of tantras—two, ten, eight, eighteen—is itself a display of spontaneous presence. Liberate the counting. Liberate the counted. Liberate the counter. Recognition is immediate.

[Final] Three words complete.
What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
