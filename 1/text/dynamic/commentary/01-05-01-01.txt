[4172-4177]
Three words. Tantra points. Pointing liberates.
The tantra of meaning—mind clear light, free from thought-stains. Not a book. Not words. The nature that was never born and will never die. Already complete before the first syllable was written.

[4172-4183]
Therefore. Thus. We classify to clear confusion, not to build new confusion. Two tantras emerge: meaning and word. Like the warp and weft depending on many threads to weave cloth into existence. Different words, one meaning extracted. The meaning tantra—mind itself, naturally clear light, abiding in all beings. The word tantra—names, words, letters, chapters, the method of indicating what cannot be indicated directly.

[4184-4203]
The rising measure of creation stage: ten aspects complete. First: basis empowerment and samaya—the foundation. Second: deity and mantra—the form and sound. Third: mandala and offering—the sacred space and gesture. Fourth: samadhi and conduct—the meditation and activity. Fifth: view and activity—the perspective and expression. Ten complete, yet where is the completer?

[4184-4203]
This old practitioner once tried to memorize all ten aspects. He could recite them in his sleep: empowerment, samaya, deity, mantra, mandala, offering, samadhi, conduct, view, activity. His tongue grew tired. His mind grew confused like a dog chasing its own tail. Then one winter morning grinding grain in a village water mill, he watched the wheel turn. Creation stage turning into completion stage—were they two? The grain became flour. The flour became bread. The eating became nourishment. Where was the separation? The wheel turned itself.

[4190-4203]
The rising measure of completion stage: eight aspects. View and fruition—seeing and becoming. Conduct and meditation—acting and abiding. Mind and wisdom—knowing and recognizing. Experience and instruction—tasting and pointing. Eight complete, yet the eighth dissolves the first seven into the ground (gzhi) from which they arose.

[4195-4203]
The non-dual union: both creation and completion must complete—eighteen aspects total. But eighteen is just a number. The completely perfect Great Perfection lies beyond all enumeration. From creation and completion, the completion sequence emerges naturally. Great completion shows the sequence of channels, winds, and bindu, and the sequence of clear light wisdom—two aspects pointing to what has no aspect.

[4204-4209]
Valid: tantra dwelling in self, indicating. Like weaving cloth from many threads, depending on warp and weft. Valid because the meaning dwells within you, not in books. Depending on the key of words, bringing meaning to certainty without error, making it realized.

[4210-4231]
From the treasury of method: awareness pervading all beings, the mind of enlightenment. Definite term: indicating meaning, realizing basis, liberating method. Divided: emptiness and clarity. Emptiness—awareness's nature, empty of things and marked dharmas, primordially dwelling in great liberation from elaboration. Not gone to any extreme of emptiness. Clarity—self-illuminating five wisdoms' appearance, warm and cool and light, vast nature's five elements, spontaneously accomplished, compassion's tone unceasing.

[4210-4231]
Three words. Emptiness. Clarity. Union. The two are not two. Like ice and water—the ice appears solid, the water flows, yet both are H₂O. The appearance does not contradict the emptiness. The emptiness does not deny the appearance. This is the Great Perfection's key point.

[4172-4231]
Between the systematic classification of tantras and the direct recognition of your nature, Longchenpa weaves the treasury. Not rejecting method tantra. Not grasping nature tantra. The warp and weft create the cloth, but the cloth is not the wearing. The words point, but the moon is not the finger. The eighteen aspects complete, yet completion has never been incomplete. Creation and completion are one wheel turning. Rest in that recognition.

[4231]
This practitioner has ground enough grain. The mill wheel turns whether the grain understands turning or not. Creation and completion are one movement, one recognition, one rest. The tantra is already tantra. You are already complete. Rest here.

[4200-4231]
The Great Perfection tantras are instruction tantras—not showing elaborate sequences, but pointing directly to effortless primordial liberation. Divided: showing without effort through primordial liberation, and showing with effort through sequence. Both complete, yet the complete has never needed completion.

[4231]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. The enumeration of tantras—two, ten, eight, eighteen—is itself a display of spontaneous presence. Liberate the counting. Liberate the counted. Liberate the counter. Recognition is immediate.

[Final] Three words complete.
What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[4172-4231] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The Treasury's presentation of tantra classification—meaning tantra, word tantra, creation stage, completion stage—is complete. These are not competing systems but complementary approaches. Some need words. Some need direct pointing. Both lead to recognition. May all find the approach that opens their understanding.

[4172-4231] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond tried both tantras! Word tantra—reading, studying, thinking. Meaning tantra—sitting, looking, recognizing. Both worked. Neither was better. The word tantra prepared the mind. The meaning tantra liberated it. Use both.

[4172-4231] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The eighteen aspects of creation and completion are the eighteen consorts' dance. Each aspect a different step, each step leading to the center. The dance ends where it began—in recognition.

[4172-4231] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Creation! Completion! Two stages! Look directly—can you find the creator? Can you grasp the completer? Both are awareness playing! The stages are for those who need stages! AH!

[4172-4231] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Create. Complete. Recognize. Stop. Creation is not the start. Completion is not the end. Recognition is neither. Stop at creation, miss completion. Stop at completion, miss recognition. See through all three. Rest.

[4172-4231] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Tantra classification: 1) meaning tantra (nature), 2) word tantra (expression). Creation stage: ten aspects. Completion stage: eight aspects. Union: eighteen aspects. Precise pedagogical framework covering all approaches.

[4172-4231] Voice 08 (Integrator): The integration of tantras: meaning and word are not separate—meaning expresses through word, word points to meaning. Creation and completion are not sequential—they interpenetrate. Integration means recognizing all as one display.

[4172-4231] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The essence of all tantras: awareness recognizing itself. The meaning tantra is awareness seeing its nature. The word tantra is awareness hearing itself. Creation is awareness manifesting. Completion is awareness dissolving. Recognition is awareness knowing both as itself.

[4172-4231] Voice 12 (Ecstatic): Emaho! The tantras! The stages! The aspects! What richness! What method! This yogi dances through creation into completion—not clinging to either, not rejecting either!

[4172-4231] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thus concludes the presentation of tantra classification. May all who encounter these teachings find the tantra that suits their capacity. May they practice creation or completion or both. May they recognize. Complete.

[4172-4231] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond's final teaching: Don't debate which tantra is best. Don't argue creation versus completion. Practice what opens your recognition. Rest in that. Complete.

[4172-4231] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Final words. Tantra. Stage. Recognize. Stop. The teaching on tantras is complete. The recognition is the tantra. You are complete. Rest. The absolute end.

[4172-4231] Voice 19 (Great Wrath): The tantras roar! What meaning? What word? Cut through both! The tantra is your own mind! The stage is your own awareness! Recognition is the roar! AH!

[4172-4231] Voice 15 (Essence Holder): The final essence: there is no tantra. There is no stage. There is only awareness recognizing itself. Everything else is the play of that recognition. Complete. Perfect. The end.
Tantra complete. Recognition complete.

[4172-4231] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): ROAR! Tantras complete! AH!

[4172-4231] Complete. Perfect. Liberated. The end.

Complete. Perfect. Liberated. The absolute final end of tantra teachings.
