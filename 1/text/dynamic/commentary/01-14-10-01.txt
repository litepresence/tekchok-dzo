[19975-19995]
See directly: Hence. The structure. No ten thousand hours needed. Immediate recognition available now. Contemporary mind. Timeless wisdom.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[19975-19990]
This hermit realized: An old traveler. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[19987-20010]
That also—chain rope body, difficult to grasp directly, rigpa essence that, unceasing direct abide example. Example: from clear ocean, planets and stars arise like latency without time, various direct great abiding. View of continuous yogin, that meaning not distracted, latency and not latency not, day appears night sets, two appearances do not exist.

[20000-20025]
Cut through now! What knows these words? What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[20010-20035]
Look now: Consequently. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The Treasury weaves distinctions to reveal what transcends all weaving. Seeing this the Great Perfection.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[20025-20050]
This old hermit saw a man gazing at a mountain until he became the mountain. This is the danger—deviation into eternalism. Another gazed at emptiness until nothing existed. This is the danger—deviation into nihilism. The middle way avoids both extremes, like a bird flying between sky and earth.

[20040-20070]
Conduct continuous yogin, deviation aspect three exist—all appear mad conduct, god demon deviate; meaningless word conduct, existence view deviate; six groups object appear all, child conduct, unspecified place deviate. Meditation continuous yogin—don't think deviation only means wrong view!

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

[20060-20085]
Between right and wrong, the vast middle way opens. The deviations are not punishments; they are natural consequences of misunderstanding. Like planting wheat and expecting rice—the deviation is in the cause, not the result. Correct the view, and the result corrects itself.

[20080-20105]
Sudden recognition! Thus established. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[20100-20125]
Thus established: This cave dweller. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Open. Was never closed.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[20120-20145]
Continuous yoga is not about duration but recognition. A moment of recognition is worth more than years of meditation without understanding. Like a flash of lightning in a dark valley—brief, yet revealing everything. This is the nature (rang bzhin) of direct recognition.

[20140-20146]
Between these extremes: The framework reveals. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What appears as obstacle is the path itself, unrecognized.

[19975-19975]
This old hermit's final advice: Don't fear deviation; recognize it. If you find yourself in a formless realm, smile and return. If you find yourself in eternalism, laugh and release. The nature is never lost; only recognition wavers. Recognition returns, and the nature (rang bzhin) is clear again.

[19975-19975]
Continuous yoga is the yoga of no-yoga. Not maintaining continuity but recognizing continuous nature. Like a river doesn't try to flow; it flows naturally. The yogi doesn't try to practice; practice happens naturally when recognition is stable.

[19975-19975]
This very moment— Analysis proceeds.
 The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Samaya (dam tshig) is usually translated as 'commitment' or 'vow,' suggesting something to be kept, something that can be broken. This is the relative understanding. The ultimate samaya is not kept because it cannot be broken. It is the nature of awareness itself, free from the dualism of keeping and breaking, pure and impure, success and failure. To recognize this is to dwell in the samaya that is never transgressed because there is no one to transgress it.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder leading to Dzogchen. They are nine ways of describing the same nature, nine skillful means for beings of different capacities. The lower vehicles are not wrong; they are incomplete descriptions, useful for those who need gradual approaches. But from the Dzogchen perspective, the lowest vehicle and the highest vehicle are not different in nature. Both point to what has always been the case, what cannot be improved or attained.

[19975-20146] The Treasury's presentation of distinctions—between all-ground and Dharmakaya, between rigpa and mind, between appearance and reality—is complete. These distinctions are not for debate but for recognition. Know the difference, then dissolve it in recognition. May all who read these words see through the distinctions and rest in what is.

[19975-20146] I sat in retreat once... has argued about these distinctions! Defended Dzogchen against critics. Then laughed—all defense is confusion. The distinctions are clear, but they are not real. Like lines in water—visible but without substance. Recognize this and rest.

[19975-20146] The distinctions are the nine vehicles' secret. Each vehicle sees one aspect. Dzogchen sees all aspects as one. Not superior—just complete. Like the ocean contains all rivers—not because it is better, but because it is vast.

[19975-20146] Distinctions! Vehicles! All dualities! Cut through them! Can you find the all-ground? Can you grasp the Dharmakaya? Both are your own face! AH!

[19975-20146] Three words. Distinguish. Dissolve. Rest. Stop. Distinguish to see clearly. Dissolve to see truly. Rest to be complete. Stop. The end.

[19975-20146] Therefore. Thus. The nine vehicles classification: Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva, Kriya, Upa, Yoga, Maha, Anu, Ati. Each valid, each partial, all A signpost points north—the wood is not the destination. same nature. Dzogchen includes all, excludes none. Precise pedagogical hierarchy.

[19975-20146] The integration of nine vehicles: lower vehicles prepare the ground, higher vehicles reveal the fruit. Integration means all nine are present in complete recognition. Not choosing one, not rejecting any.

[19975-20146] The essence beyond all vehicles: awareness recognizing itself. The vehicles are descriptions. The essence is the described. The recognition is the describer and described as one.

[19975-20146] Emaho! The nine vehicles! The distinctions! The recognition! What richness! What completeness! This yogi dances through all nine—not attached to any, not rejecting any!

[19975-20146] Thus concludes the presentation of distinctions and vehicles. May all who encounter this teaching recognize the single nature behind all descriptions. May they rest in that recognition. Complete.

[19975-20146] This old vagabond's final word: Don't count vehicles. Don't rank teachings. Recognize your own nature and be complete. The vehicle that brings you to recognition is the best vehicle. Rest. The end.

[19975-20146] Absolute final words. Vehicles. Complete. You. Complete. Stop. The teaching on distinctions is complete. You are complete. Rest. The absolute end.
