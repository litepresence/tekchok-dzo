No ten thousand hours needed. Immediate recognition available now. Contemporary mind. Timeless wisdom.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[22-37]
This hermit realized: An old traveler. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[38-61]
That also—chain rope body, difficult to grasp directly, rigpa essence that, unceasing direct abide example. Example: from clear ocean, planets and stars arise like latency without time, various direct great abiding. View of continuous yogin, that meaning not distracted, latency and not latency not, day appears night sets, two appearances do not exist.

[62-87]
Cut through now! What knows these words? What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[88-113]
Look now: Consequently. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The Treasury weaves distinctions to reveal what transcends all weaving. Seeing this the Great Perfection.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[114-139]
This old hermit saw a man gazing at a mountain until he became Amne Machin. This is the danger—deviation into eternalism. Another gazed at emptiness until nothing existed. This is the danger—deviation into nihilism. The middle way avoids both extremes, like a bird flying between sky and earth.

[140-170]
Conduct continuous yogin, deviation aspect three exist—all appear mad conduct, god demon deviate; meaningless word conduct, existence view deviate; six groups object appear all, child conduct, unspecified place deviate. Meditation continuous yogin—don't think deviation only means wrong view!

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

[147-172]
Between right and wrong, the vast middle way opens. The deviations are not punishments; they are natural consequences of misunderstanding. Like planting wheat and expecting rice—the deviation is in the cause, not the result. Correct the view, and the result corrects itself.

[166-172]
Between these extremes: The framework reveals. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.

What appears as obstacle is the path itself, unrecognized.

[172-172]
This old hermit's final advice: Don't fear deviation; recognize it. If you find yourself in a formless realm, smile and return. If you find yourself in eternalism, laugh and release. The nature is never lost; only recognition wavers. Recognition returns, and the nature (rang bzhin) is clear again.
