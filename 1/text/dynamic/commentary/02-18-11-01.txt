First: Vajra family fully purify cause—mirror-like wisdom self-light color white form dawn, same vajra unmovable resonance white pierce dawn. Below: tathagata family fully purify cause, dhatu wisdom color blue form dawn, display resonance blue black dawn.

. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

See how below these visions, forms dawn with colors and shapes abiding for moments

[5192-5193]
? When these cease, the five wisdom shapes dawn [5193] - mirror-like shapes like spots in the eye [5194], increasing in excellent color [5195], with many lines dawning to the eye [5196]. This is the preliminary measure arriving [5197].

Then the net of equality dawns halfway [5198], purifying the wind completely [5199], completing the preliminary pure vision [5200]. Then heaps of flowers dawn [5201] through effortful gazing [5202], purifying the preliminary with thousand-petaled lotuses [5203]. Then weapon-like forms dawn [5204] with unfabricated nature [5205], completing the preliminary with wheels and various forms [5206]. Finally, the palace of dharmadhatu wisdom dawns [5207].

Thus practitioner, do not be distracted! These visions are your own nature displaying itself. Emaho!

[5210-5212]
. Beyond that, experience increases vision even further [5213].

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Listen! During this preliminary time [5214], conceptuality's difference raises and ceases as signs [5215]. Then the vision of awareness's self-essence dawns [5216]! Light points dawn like hanging cords gathering as one [5217], then two points connect - method and discriminating-awareness fully purify [5218], then five points connect as the five wisdoms enter [5219]. Direct connection of points - not different, merely small existence [5220] - experience increases beyond this [5221].

The Thalgyur declares: "The five-colored light, victory-banner and boat-part vision, seeing the field boat-only measure"

[5223-5225]
. The Self-Arising Tantra proclaims: "Seeing one's own face thus, upper joint four fingers apart, separate person of good capacity - how could they enter samsara?"

[5227-5231]
. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Dear practitioner, whatever boat-part forms dawn accomplish emanation qualities

[5232-5233]

[5236-5238]
- thus it is said. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Third, the awareness measure-arrive vision shows general manner [5240]. From explaining nature particularly [5241], first: points each dawn in half the body, purifying nirmanakaya [5241], then the body itself dawns each, directly seeing dharmata [5241], then body becomes five-by-five fathers and mothers as sambhogakaya wisdom measure-arrives [5241], then individual heaps with mandala vision [5241].

Thus, dear one, these are your own face - do not seek elsewhere! Emaho!

The vision of awareness measure-arriving shows the general manner and explains the nature particularly. This is the third of the great divisions in the preliminary practice, practitioner. The texts divide this into two: first explaining how liberation arises from the very binding of samsara, second particular explanation of the vision manners.

See how these visions unfold! When the five families manifest, each brings its wisdom quality. The vajra family purifies through mirror-like wisdom—the self-radiant light of awareness, white as moonlight, forming the vajra's unmovable resonance. The tathagata family purifies through dhatu wisdom—the space of phenomena, blue as the sky at dusk, displaying the blue-black dawn of ultimate reality. The jewel family brings equality wisdom—yellow as refines gold, the source of all qualities shining forth. The lotus family offers discriminating awareness—red as coral, the infinite resonance of compassion's bloom. The karma family manifests action-accomplishing wisdom—green as the indranila gem, the active quality of enlightenment in motion.

These five families surround you like a blue vajra fence, the text says. See how there is no difference in their wisdom-nature! They are not separate things but the one awareness appearing in five modes. The vision increases from this: five colors, five lights, each chief wisdom shining clear. The practitioner must understand—these five lights are your own face, the face you have always had but never recognized. Do not look elsewhere for wisdom! It is here, now, presenting itself.

The awareness measure-arrives in stages. First, light points arise in the body—half the body fills with points of light, these purify nirmanakaya. Then the body itself dawns in each point, this is seeing dharmata directly. Then the body becomes five-by-five fathers and mothers, the sambhogakaya wisdom measure-arriving. Then individual heaps with mandala vision arises—the complete manifestation of enlightened form.

The old wanderer says: the binding and liberation are not two. What appears as samsara binding is already the path. The five poisons—desire, aversion, delusion, pride, jealousy—manifest as the five wisdoms when recognized. There is no other cause than this: the latency within awareness itself, transcending samsara halfway.

Then the net of equality arises halfway. The wind purifies completely—this is the preliminary pure vision completing. Then heaps of flowers arise through effortful gazing—the thousand-petaled lotus purifying the preliminary. Then weapon-like forms arise with unfabricated nature—wheels and various forms completing the preliminary. Finally, the palace of dharmata wisdom dawns.

Thus, dear practitioner, do not be distracted! These visions are your own nature displaying itself. When outer visions cease, sixteen moments arise—this is the awareness measure-arriving in its fullness.

Listen well! During this preliminary time, conceptuality's differences raise and cease as signs. Then the vision of awareness's self-essence dawns! Light points arise like hanging cords gathering as one. Then two points connect—method and discriminating-awareness fully purified. Then five points connect as the five wisdoms enter. The direct connection of points is not different—merely small existence—then experience increases beyond this.

The Thalgyur declares: "The five-colored light, victory-banner and boat-part vision, seeing the field boat-only measure." The Self-Arising Tantra proclaims: "Seeing one's own face thus, upper joint four fingers apart, separate person of good capacity—how could they enter samsara?"

Whatever boat-part forms dawn, these accomplish emanation qualities. Whatever fields dawn, these are the same heaps. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual. The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

This old wanderer has traversed these paths. What I tell you is simple: what you seek is what is looking. The visions arise from your own awareness—they are not external phenomena but the self-display of rigpa. When you see the lotus thousand-petaled, know this is your own pristine mind flowering. When you see weapons and wheels, know these are the active qualities of enlightenment manifesting. When you see the palace of dharmata, know this is home—you have never been elsewhere.

The sequence of arise and cease follows diligence. For great diligence, five days each cycle. For middle, seven by seven. For lower capacity, twenty-one by twenty-one. Previous visions cease, new forms dawn below—color and shape arising and abiding for moments, then dissolving into the next. This is not failure—this is the path. Each vision purifies another layer of obscuration. Each arise and cease brings you closer to the ground.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. Relax into what already is. The five wisdom shapes dawn when outer visions cease—mirror-like shapes like spots in the eye, increasing in excellent color, with many lines dawning to the eye. This is the preliminary measure arriving. Then the net of equality dawns halfway, purifying the wind completely, completing the preliminary pure vision.

Thus it is said: what appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Beyond that, experience increases vision even further.
