[4916-5034] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man spent years trying to have direct perception! Read books, did practices, sought experiences. Then one day, looking at a cloud—suddenly there was just the seeing. No perceiver. No perceived. Just perception. That's when I knew.

[4916-5034] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The four direct perceptions are the four consorts' embraces—senses as Vajra, mind as Lotus, self-knowing as Karma, yogic as Buddha. Each more subtle, each more direct. The last is the meeting of mother and child clear light.

[Final] Four direct perceptions lead to the ultimate—dharmata direct perception. The sphere meets rigpa. Mother meets child. This is the great direct perception of the Great Perfection.

Emaho! The direct perception of dharmata!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
