[4916-5034] First, sense direct perception—form and the five objects appearing to their nature. This is the most basic, most immediate seeing. Form appears to eye, sound to ear, scent to nose, flavor to tongue, texture to body. No intermediary. No interpretation. Just the naked encounter of sense and object.

[-20405--20396] the cliff caves above Samye hermit... thought direct perception meant special powers! Like clairvoyance or reading minds. Then understood: direct perception is ordinary seeing without the filter of "I am seeing." The eye meets form. That's all. No perceiver needed.

[4916-5034] Three words. Sense. Object. Meeting. Stop. The meeting is the perception. Don't add a perceiver. Don't add a knower. The eye and form are sufficient. Recognition happens at the meeting point.

[-20405--20396] Sense direct perception! What sense? What object? Look directly! Can you find the boundary between eye and form? Between ear and sound? The meeting dissolves the meeting. Perception is non-dual from the start!

[4916-5034] The senses are the five wisdoms in disguise. When direct perception operates without grasping, seeing is mirror-like wisdom, hearing is discriminating wisdom, smelling and tasting are equality wisdom, touching is all-accomplishing wisdom. The dharmadhatu wisdom encompasses them all.

[4916-5034] Mind direct perception—the object engaged closely, cause certain, appearing within thought's object. This is mental perception—when mind meets its object directly, not through inference or imagination. The difference from sense perception: mind can perceive abstract objects, past and future, possibilities.

[-20395--20376] Therefore. Thus. The classification distinguishes sense-perception (sensory immediacy) from mind-perception (mental immediacy). Both are direct—neither relies on inference. But mind-perception has broader scope, accessing non-sensory objects.

[4916-5034] Mind direct perception reveals the nature of mental objects as clearly as eye reveals form. Thoughts appear directly to mind. Not through another sense. Mind knows mind. This reflexivity is the key to self-knowing direct perception.

[-20395--20376] This old vagabond watched his mind for years. Saw thoughts arise like bubbles in water. Clear, distinct, immediate. That's mind direct perception—not thinking about thoughts, but seeing thoughts as they are. Simple. Direct. Unmediated.

[4916-5034] Self-knowing direct perception—within pleasure, pain, and so forth, experience called appearance. This is reflexive awareness—knowing that you know, feeling that you feel. Not a second act of knowing, but the intrinsic luminosity of experience itself.

[-20375--20356] Three words. Experience. Knowing. One. Stop. Self-knowing is not a mirror reflecting experience. It is experience's own luminosity. Like fire burning—its heat is not separate from the burning. Like light illuminating—it doesn't observe illumination; it is illumination.

[4916-5034] Self-knowing! What knows? What is known? Cut through the duality! Experience knows itself. Pain is its own knowing. Pleasure is its own knowing. No knower needed. No known needed. Just naked knowing-being!

[-20375--20356] I sing of self-knowing—the song that sings itself. No singer. No audience. Just the melody of awareness knowing itself. Pleasure is a note. Pain is a note. Equanimity is the space between. All self-known. All self-sung.

[4916-5034] Yogin's direct perception itself—meaning near meeting, actual point entering, particular correct awareness and that appearance object non-dual state, grasping-free experience certainty. This is the pinnacle—the non-dual direct perception of realized practitioners.

[-20355--20336] The yogin's direct perception is the natural state—rigpa knowing itself as all appearances. Not a perception of something. Not a perception by someone. Just perception itself, luminous and empty, naturally pure.

[4916-5034] This uneducated yogi... tasted this once! In deep meditation, the boundary dissolved—no perceiver, no perceived, just perceiving. Then the "I" came back and claimed the experience. Foolish! The moment of claiming was the moment of losing it.

[-20355--20336] Yogin's direct perception! What yogin? What perception? Cut through all categories! The realized and the unrealized are the same awareness. The perception and the perceiver are the same empty display. AH!

[4916-5034] Ultimate sphere-meeting direct perception—awareness essence dharmata existing in heart, determine. That self-resonance, heart-to-eye connect cause, like sun and light-ray, certain cause-effect. This is the transcendent direct perception—awareness meeting its own nature in the sphere.

[-20335--20316] The metaphor of sun and rays integrates three aspects: source (heart/awareness), medium (connection), and manifestation (eye/perception). The sun doesn't create rays—rays are the sun's natural expression. Similarly, awareness doesn't create perception—perception is awareness's natural radiance.

[4916-5034] The heart is not the physical organ. The eye is not the physical sense. These are symbols for dimensions of awareness—the heart as ground, the eye as manifestation. The connection between them is the path, the continuity, the unobstructed flow.

[-20335--20316] Three words. Heart. Eye. Connection. Stop. The heart is dharmakaya. The eye is nirmanakaya. The connection is sambhogakaya. Three kayas, one awareness. Perception is their play.

[4916-5034] Dharmata direct perception—main point not existing, add intellect word. This is the direct perception of reality itself—not filtered through concept, not mediated by thought. The luminous-clear vision, term-famous, not form-possess.

[-20315--20296] Therefore. Thus. Epistemological distinction: form-possess (gzugs can) vs. not-form-possess (gzugs can min). Form-possess = physical, coarse, destructible. Not-form-possess = luminous, subtle, indestructible. Dharmata direct perception perceives the not-form-possess—awareness itself.

[5006-502Walking the high passes...ool looked for dharmata with his eyes! Sought it in visions, lights, experiences. Then understood: dharmata is the looking itself. The awareness that seeks is what is sought. The eye cannot see itself. Yet it is never separate from seeing.

[4916-5034] Dharmata direct perception! What dharmata? What perception? Cut through both! Dharmata is not an object to perceive. Perception is not an act to perform. See through the seeing. Find what was never lost!

[4916-5034] Three enumeration: outer body, speech, mind three establish base with main-point three. Inner: dharmata field main-point, dawn cause gate main-point, wind abiding three main-points clear path. Secret: habituation measure sequence, ripen sign sequence, ultimate end exhaust sequence.

[-20295--20287] The three main-points are the body, speech, and mind of the practice. Body in position. Speech in silence. Mind in recognition. These three establish the base from which dharmata direct perception dawns.

[4916-5034] I have practiced these three for years. Body like mountain. Speech like echo. Mind like sky. From this base, the vision dawns naturally. Not forced. Not fabricated. Like the sun rising—inevitable, spontaneous, perfect.

[-20295--20287] A grassland wanderer...'s practical advice: Don't obsess about the three main-points. They are supports, not goals. The goal is recognition. The main-points create conditions. Recognition is the flowering.

[4916-5034] Between the four direct perceptions, between sense and mind, between self-knowing and yogic perception, the secret essence pulses. It is the intimacy of awareness with itself—closer than perception, nearer than knowledge. This is the consort's whisper in the ear of the yogin.

[-20405--20287] The four direct perceptions form an epistemological hierarchy: sense (bodily), mental (cognitive), reflexive (self-aware), non-dual (realized). Each transcends the limitations of the previous while including its valid cognition. Precise correlation with perceptual refinement.

[4916-5034] I have met practitioners who claim direct perception of dharmata. Some genuine—eyes clear, presence vast. Others deluded—grasping at experiences, building ego. The difference? Genuine recognition brings humility. Deluded perception builds arrogance.

[-20405--20287] Dharmata direct perception arises spontaneously when conditions are ripe. Not through effort. Not through will. Like fruit falling when ripe. Like water finding its level. Natural. Effortless. Complete.

[4916-5034] I dance through the four perceptions like wind through four seasons. Each season different, each dance different, but the dancer is the same. The four perceptions are four costumes of one awareness. Recognition is seeing through the costumes.

[-20405--20287] Philosophically, the direct perception theory resolves the Indian debate between Nyaya realism and Yogacara idealism. Dzogchen accepts the validity of sense perception (Nyaya) while transcending it through awareness perception (Yogacara), culminating in non-dual perception that dissolves the debate.

[4916-5034] Emaho! The four direct perceptions! The four gates to liberation! Sense gate! Mind gate! Self-knowing gate! Yogic gate! Each gate opens to the same garden—awareness itself! What joy to know these gates! What bliss to pass through them!

[-20405--20287] The scholarly precision of this presentation fascinates me. Four distinct perceptual modes, each with its object, its validity, its limitations. Yet within this precision lives the wild freedom of direct encounter—unmediated, unfiltered, immediate.

[4916-5034] From the sky of dharmata I dance down into perception. The four perceptions are my four dances—earth dance, water dance, fire dance, wind dance. Each dance different, each dance complete. The sky remains unchanged.

[-20405--20287] Every direct perception is a book in my library. Sense perception—book of forms. Mental perception—book of thoughts. Self-knowing—book of experience. Yogic perception—book of realization. The library burns. The books turn to ash. Perception continues.

[4916-5034] Cognitive science studies perception—bottom-up processing, top-down expectations, predictive coding. They map the mechanics but miss the luminosity. Direct perception in Dzogchen is not about mechanics but about recognition—seeing through the construction to the naked awareness.

[-20405--20287] Translating "mngon sum" challenges me. "Direct perception" is accurate but dry. "Clear seeing" is evocative but imprecise. "Immediate cognition" is philosophical but abstract. The solution: use all three. Let the reader taste the richness through multiplicity.

[4916-5034] I reveal what was never hidden. The four direct perceptions are not attainments. They are descriptions of how awareness naturally operates. You are having sense perception now. Mental perception now. Self-knowing now. The yogic perception is just recognition of this.

[-20405--20287] The Treasury presents these four direct perceptions as stages of refinement—not in the sense of progress from worse to better, but in the sense of scope expanding. Sense perception is limited to present forms. Mental perception extends to past, future, abstract. Self-knowing includes the perceiver. Yogic perception dissolves the duality entirelThis uneducated yogi...4] This old fool's final teaching on perception: Don't seek special perception. Don't wait for yogic direct perception. Practice with the perception you have now. Sense perception can be direct if ungrasping. Mental perception can be direct if unconceptual. Start where you are.

[4916-5034] Three final words. Perceive. Directly. Stop. The teaching on direct perception is complete. The four types are described. The ultimate is pointed to. Nothing more to say. Nothing more to understand. Just perceive directly.

[-20405--20287] The direct perception speaks with fierce clarity! What sense? What mind? What self? Cut through all with one glance of recognition! All perceptions, all types, all distinctions—CUT THROUGH! See what perceives when perception stops!

[4916-5034] The four perceptions form a vajra fortress—solid, impenetrable, protective. Yet look closely! Is there a fortress? Or just awareness pretending to be structured? Each perception complete in itself. Each recognition self-sufficient. The fortress is the illusion.

[-20405--20287] The direct perception of dharmata is bliss! Not pleasure-bliss, but clarity-bliss. The bliss of seeing without seer. The bliss of knowing without knower. The bliss that doesn't depend on object or subject. This great bliss is available in every perception.

[4916-5034] The heruka dances through perception! Sense, mind, self-knowing, yogic—four steps of one dance! Form, thought, experience, realization—four faces of one deity! Dance with me through perception into recognition!

[-20405--20287] The essence is not in sense perception. The essence is not in mental perception. The essence is not in self-knowing or yogic perception. The essence is the essence—primordially pure, spontaneously present, never stained by confusion, never improved by wisdom. Recognize this and all perceptions dissolve into one taste.

[4916-5034] Between the detailed phenomenology of the four perceptions and the direct simplicity of dharmata direct perception, the Great Perfection holds both. The stages serve the recognition. The recognition encompasses all stages.

[One without learning...his old man's bones ache. Sixty years of seeking direct perception. Found it in the most ordinary moments—watching clouds, drinking tea, hearing rain. The extraordinary is just the ordinary seen directly. That's the secret.

[-20405--20287] Final final words. Stop seeking direct perception. Stop classifying perceptions. Stop thinking about perception. Perceive. Directly. Now. Complete. The end.
