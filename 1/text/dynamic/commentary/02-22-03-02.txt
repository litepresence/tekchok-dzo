[-20405--20397]
. We must understand the nature (rang bzhin) of these manifestations—jeweler-like, examining precious gems.

Dancing in space, distinctions play and dissolve. Who dances? Just play! Ecstatic empty play!

Why wait even a moment! The distinction burns in recognition! The maker dissolves NOW!

The root text [1] says the essence is "the abiding nature as the support of all phenomena beyond sorrow." You must realize: these kayas are not statues in a temple, remote and separate from you! They are your own nature displaying itself. Like fire that is both heat and light inseparable, the kayas are the natural expression of dharmata.

Line 10908 gives the etymology: "stainless self-perfect great zangthal." Zangthal means unobstructed, penetrating everywhere! Think of sunlight streaming through a window—it fills the room completely, leaving no corner dark. So does the stainless nature penetrate all phenomena.

The text distinguishes the three kayas

[1-282]
: Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya. But listen carefully! In the Great Perfection, these are not merely results to be attained later—they are the path's own appearances. Dream-like, when the dreamer realizes he is dreaming, the dream itself becomes the path to awakening.

Line 10914 explains: "According to this Great Perfection system, the three kayas are considered as path appearances." This is profound! The very appearances you see right now—if recognized—are the kayas. Your ordinary perception is actually the three kayas in disguise, like a poor man who does not know he wears a jewel in his hair.

Line 10916 clarifies: "Dharmakaya is self-appearance." Whatever dharmas exist, as long as mind exists to perceive them, this is the path. As long as kayas exist, as long as body exists—these are path appearances, not the final ultimate. Do not mistake the Prayer flags carry the mantra on wind—the flag is not the prayer. for the moon itself!

When the essence of practice matures and reaches its measure

[1-282]
, we arrive at "the appearance of exhaustion"—approaching dissolution into kadag. Like ice melting back into water, all appearances naturally return to their source.

Line 10926 speaks of Lhungrub's appearances: "From the appearance of spontaneous presence, kayas, pure lands, and teachers appear." This is not creation from nothing! It is like reflections in a mirror—the mirror does not create the reflections, yet they clearly appear.

The signs of having accomplished the kayas are then described

[1-282]
: "Whoever has reached the measure of the kayas—to that fortunate being, these signs appear." When Chokyi Kaya is practiced, others cannot see the body; the yogin plays freely within himself. This is not mere invisibility—it is that the yogin's body has become indivisible from space itself!

Emaho!

[1-282]
manifest as powers: flying through space, passing through mountains, diving under earth, floating on water without sinking. But listen—if you lack confidence in the inseparability of space and awareness, these become mere sorcery!

The nirmanakaya signs

[1-282]
are even more amazing—spontaneous teachings flowing from your mouth, understanding texts you never studied, speaking words of Dharma that accord with beings' capacities. This is truly the lion's roar of speech!

See the bodily signs

[1-282]
: strength surpassing youth, grey hair turning black, wrinkles smoothing like a field after rain. This is the treasury's heart.

THUNDER! Treasury blazes! Was never closed! Sudden recognition! NOW!

 And compassion

[1-282]
—dwelling sixty-eight thousand years for others' benefit, then manifesting in countless world-systems, all while absorbed in ka-dag. The nature is complete.

Dancing in space, distinctions play and dissolve. Who dances? Just play! Ecstatic empty play!

Already complete. Before seeking.

You may wonder

[1-282]
about the five hundred years of self-benefit—there is no contradiction! For self-benefit one may dwell five hundred years; for others' benefit, countless aeons. Both are possible without conflict. Time is not an obstacle for the realized—tree-like, growing for centuries yet giving shade immediately.

Like water dissolving into water, like butter into butter, like space into space

[1-282]
—previously absent, now arising from the depths for beings' welfare, willing to give body and limbs. Rest in this understanding.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

When these arise, you have touched the nirmanakaya. This is not mere imagination—it is your own nature manifesting! These signs arise naturally from recognition of your true face, lamp-like—flame rising without effort.

The text warns

[1-282]
—so your own nature dissolves into itself without any grasping at essence. This is not annihilation; it is spontaneous liberation! The waves return to the ocean; the rays return to the sun.

The inner awareness signs

[1-282]
That person obstacle arisen signs much, time water mandala sitting, chin tree stick sixteen finger-width pressing, body sandalwood oil anointed, outer inner things coarse meditated certainly clears. Mara's blessing emanated that too examined reflection second appearing, consecrated water body washed phat recited, emptiness sky-like meditation clears. Other yogin whoever dharmata not realized realized thinking, joy excitement demon entered, all empty realized wide entered karma and ripening not harm holding.

[1-282]
are: bliss, non-attachment to worldly concerns, all appearances shining as light, seeing kayas in light without cessation, body at ease without grasping, mind one-pointed, awareness naturally relaxed, unfabricated meditation arising in your being. This is the treasury's heart.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle vast oceanic completion. Never closed. Never opened. Simply what is.

This is your inheritance, fortunate child! Not something to be achieved from outside, but your own nature recognizing itself. The realization dawns that you were never separate from the three kayas—prince-like, discovering you've been wearing the crown all along.

Emaho!

[1-282]
: one who possesses these signs but lacks confidence in dharmadhatu and rigpa—the elements will self-exhaust but this is not true liberation. Do not be like a merchant who displays his goods but has no wealth!

Emaho!

[1-282]
. Awareness appears as your own appearing—vajra chain-like, indestructible, continuous. Through the guru's pith instructions, previously unrecognized awareness becomes recognized.

Threefold rigpa

[1-282]
Flesh-eating dakinis prophecy, gatherings meeting etc. small siddhi achieved, dakinis speaking ear near formless voice good bad dharma teaching etc. coming, time clear knowledge subtle arising pride possessing exists. These all mara's obstacles knowing, generation completion abiding or ganachakra great accumulated wish-prayer made, emptiness meditation liberates. From Rangshar: "Mouth words engaging depth not realized lunatic-like arose, obstacle demon arisen, ganachakra great given practice. Or memory declined arose, display not seen signs, three roots reversing."

[1-282]
: base-establishing rigpa is the natural state beyond good and bad; path-appearing rigpa goes by various names—mind-nature, unborn, co-emergent wisdom, beyond intellect, dharmakaya; lhaktong rigpa sees the vajra chain's kaya directly, free from conceptual investigation. This is the treasury's heart.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The character

[1-282]
is this: naturally clear, naked, spontaneously perfected—just this! The result is liberation into ka-dag's spontaneity through practicing just this. Not practicing something else, not going somewhere else—resting in what is already present!

See the signs

[1-282]
: wherever you direct attention, awareness enters there; body follows like a shadow; you can transform others' faith; conceptual fixation ceases. One who recognizes this directly dwells in the self-liberated ground. Recognition deepens naturally—garuda-like, circling higher with each wing-beat.

The text quotes

[1-282]
"Dakinis prophecy arising, experience view, placed in meditation." Thus. Prophecy two: dakinis self-controlled, self dakinis' controlled two. Self-controlled dakinis all actions achieved, actions completed. Self-controlled dakinis method: spiritual son, practice time prophecy arising, to that attachment joy mind not arisen, to that truly held, self-controlled dakinis called. That anything showing not able. Wisdom pure dakinis world not arising.

[1-282]
: "Body light and spontaneously clear, touching earth without obstruction, speech's power perfected, words exhausted of elaboration, mind able to transfer consciousness." These are not fairy tales! They are the natural display when rigpa matures.

Emaho!

[1-282]
Flesh-eating action dakinis world come, some practitioner place wandering, that form not clearly appearing thus liberation not able. True path other shore going for, dakinis all to me life essence once gave. Self dakinis' controlled oneself too prophecy that truly held, prophecy that always held, body non-attached conduct doing, result is is not extremes transcended saying, prophecy that following holding is near obstacle demon arisen, that time mara's deception knowing.

Emaho!

[1-282]
arise these signs and measures: body light and spontaneously clear, touching earth without obstruction, speech's power perfected, words exhausted of elaboration, mind able to transfer consciousness. The nature is complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The five senses

[1-282]
dissolve into their natureless state—this is the measure! Now the text distinguishes signs more precisely The nature is complete.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[1-282]
: outer body signs, inner awareness signs, and how they combine. When you are truly confident in ka-dag's realization, no more births in samsara! Signs: body without parasites, hair and nails not growing.

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct Smoke rising from a distant valley—you see the sign but the smoke is not the fire. your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itselI sat in retreat once...bond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words A mirror shows your face—the glass is not the person. the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a Sitting still, mind wanders. The wandering A trail worn into Gangri Tokar—walk it, but don't worship the path. what doesn't move.; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
