[18274-18279]
The nature of primordial wisdom: your own rigpa, abiding as knowledge from the very beginning. Not something to acquire, not something to cultivate. Like a lamp that has always been lit, though shadows may have obscured its light.

[18280-18285]
Definite term: wisdom that realizes the meaning abiding from the beginning. From Self-Arisen: "Primordially spontaneously accomplished, from that recognition becomes manifest." The term "wisdom" is thus established—not as something new, but as the recognition of what has always been.

[18286-18293]
Divisions: basis-abiding wisdom, characteristic-grasping wisdom, object-pervading wisdom—three. From Pearl Garland: wisdom itself thus: basis-abide pure wisdom, characteristic-grasp, object-pervade. First, basis-abide wisdom three: essence primordially pure wisdom, nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom, compassion all-pervade wisdom.

[18294-18305]
First, essence primordially pure wisdom: beyond the extremes of existence and non-existence, like space. From Thalgyur: "In essence primordially pure wisdom, non-recognition has no name in existence. One and two are without number. Established by investigation, existence and non-existence are not established." This wisdom is not found through analysis but recognized when analysis subsides.

[18306-18313]
The five wisdoms—dharmadhatu, mirrorlike, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing—are not five separate entities but five aspects of one recognition. Like a crystal that shows different colors depending on the angle of light, yet remains one crystal.

[18314-18325]
Nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom: primordially qualities complete, as power and arise-basis accomplished, wish-fulfilling jewel like appearing, though essence thing and mark empty. From that: "Nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom called, not-born not-ceased what not think, object pure definite nonexistent, power and quality cease nonexistent, play only appear from, various complete basis-not." Not-existing therefore appear, appear therefore empty. Appearance-emptiness entering possessing-aspect. This is the great spontaneous presence—not created, not fabricated, naturally perfect. Like the sun radiating light without effort.

[18326-18340]
Compassion all-pervading wisdom: not existing in your own face yet spreading as the basis for appearance. From the same source: "From compassion all-pervading wisdom, inexhaustible various appearing door." Without this, samsara and nirvana would be severed. This is the dynamic aspect of wisdom, the warmth that melts the ice of fixation.

[18341-18349]
Second, characteristic-grasping wisdom: with five root aspects and twenty-five divisions. The five root: dharmadhatu wisdom, mirrorlike wisdom, equality wisdom, discriminating wisdom, all-accomplishing wisdom. From Self-Arisen: "Dharmadhatu wisdom free from thought, mirrorlike wisdom unceasing clear, equality wisdom unmixed complete, discriminating wisdom previously explained realized, all-accomplishing wisdom dharmas complete."

[18350-18360]
These are explained in detail: From Thalgyur: "From that characteristic-grasping, Sambhogakaya wisdom is explained. From mirrorlike wisdom like form-reflection, shape color appearance aspect complete. White stain pure light, self-possessed appearance samsara-nirvana connect, dharmas form appearance, self-aware primordial wisdom." The mirror reflects without grasping, shows without judging, clear yet empty, empty yet clear.

[18361-18371]
Equality: equal cause two aspects, equal condition three times, equal without category free. Equal called dharma-nature: pain elaboration completely free, itself called correction effort without, nature abiding essence empty, mind itself thought all exhausted. When the pairs—pure and impure, good and bad, high and low—dissolve into the single taste of dharmata, this is equality wisdom.

[18372-18385]
Discriminating: individual analysis power type—whatever to whatever appearance that dharma, order individual clear. Analyzed self-appearance pure, awareness object becomes. This is not the ordinary discrimination of good and bad but the wisdom that sees each phenomenon in its unique manifestation while recognizing its empty nature. Like a master craftsman who knows each tool's specific function while understanding they are all made of the same metal.

[18386-18410]
All-accomplishing: effortless, spontaneous activity that benefits beings without conceptualizing benefit. From the same: "Accomplishing called: effort and exertion self-ceased, dharmas all self-established self-liberated." This is the activity of the realized—appearing to work while never leaving the state of rest.

[18411-18428]
Third, object-pervading wisdom: the all-ground and dharmakaya distinguished. The all-ground gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.
