[1-12]
Primordial wisdom—your own rigpa, abiding as knowledge from the very
beginning. This is not something to acquire, not something to cultivate, not
something to achieve. Like a lamp that has always been lit, though shadows may
have obscured its light. The shadows never touched the light. The obscuration
never affected the nature.

Before recognition dawned... spent years seeking wisdom. He read texts, practiced methods,
accumulated knowledge. Finally exhausted, he sat by a stream and watched water
flow. The water did not ask how to flow. The wisdom did not ask how to be wise.
Recognition dawned—wisdom was never absent, only overlooked.

[13-32]
Three divisions: basis-abiding wisdom, characteristic-grasping wisdom, object-
pervading wisdom. Not three separate wisdoms but three aspects of one
recognition. Like a crystal showing different colors depending on the angle, yet
remaining one crystal.

Basis-abiding wisdom: essence primordially pure, nature spontaneously
accomplished, compassion all-pervading. Three aspects of the basis, three
expressions of the same wisdom. Primordially pure like space—beyond existence
and non-existence. Spontaneously accomplished like a wish-fulfilling jewel—
qualities complete without effort. All-pervading compassion like sunlight—
warming all without discrimination.

[33-52]
Essence primordially pure: beyond the extremes, like space. From Thalgyur:
"In essence primordially pure wisdom, non-recognition has no name in existence.
One and two are without number. Established by investigation, existence and non-
existence are not established."

This wisdom is not found through analysis. It is recognized when analysis
subsides. Like searching for space with a microscope—futile and absurd. The
searching itself dissolves, and space was never absent.

[53-76]
Nature spontaneously accomplished: primordially qualities complete, power and
arise-basis accomplished. Like a wish-fulfilling jewel appearing, though essence
empty of thing and mark. Not-existing therefore appearing. Appearing therefore
empty. Appearance-emptiness inseparable.

This is the great spontaneous presence—not created, not fabricated, naturally
perfect. Like the sun radiating light without effort, like a lotus blooming
without instruction. The nature accomplishes without doing.

[77-98]
Compassion all-pervading wisdom: not existing in your own face yet spreading as
the basis for all appearance. From the source: "From compassion all-pervading
wisdom, inexhaustible various appearing door." Without this, samsara and
nirvana would be severed.

This is the dynamic aspect of wisdom, the warmth that melts the ice of fixation.
Not separate from primordial purity, not different from spontaneous presence—
the active expression of both. Like the rays inseparable from the sun.

[99-112]
Characteristic-grasping wisdom: the five wisdoms as realized characteristics.
Dharmadhatu wisdom—free from thought, the space in which all appears.
Mirrorlike wisdom—unceasing clarity, reflecting without grasping. Equality
wisdom—unmixed completeness, holding all as one taste. Discriminating wisdom—
clearly seeing each phenomenon's unique nature. All-accomplishing wisdom—
effortless benefit, spontaneously active.

[113-137]
The five are not five separate entities. They are five aspects of one
recognition, five ways wisdom knows itself. When rigpa recognizes itself as
dharmadhatu, it is the ground. When it recognizes itself as mirrorlike, it is the
clarity. When it recognizes itself as equality, it is the sameness. When it
recognizes itself as discriminating, it is the discernment. When it recognizes
itself as all-accomplishing, it is the activity.

[138-155]
Object-pervading wisdom: the distinction between all-ground and dharmakaya.
This is key. The all-ground gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods.
Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty. What
gathers cannot be what is free from gathering. What recognizes the gathering is
itself free.

This is the difference between ordinary mind and wisdom. Both are aware. But
ordinary mind is tangled in what it knows. Wisdom knows without tangling.
Between them, only recognition separates.

[156-177]
Mountain hermit sat for thirty years contemplating the five wisdoms. He
memorized descriptions, analyzed characteristics, distinguished aspects. One
winter morning, frost on his window caught the sunlight. Five colors appeared—
not separate, not merged, distinct yet unified. He understood. The five wisdoms
were not concepts to master. They were his own awareness, recognizing itself in
five ways.

[178-197]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: stop collecting wisdoms like trophies!
You want to possess dharmadhatu wisdom? You want to achieve mirrorlike clarity?
This very wanting is the obstacle. The wisdoms are not achievements. They are
descriptions of what you already are. Stop seeking. Start recognizing.

[198-217]
Between the elaborate classification of five wisdoms and the simple fact of
awareness knowing itself, there is no separation. The classification serves
those who need structure. The direct recognition serves those who can receive
it. Both point to the same nature. Both describe the same wisdom.

[218-237]
Thus established: threefold wisdom (basis-abiding), fivefold wisdom
(characteristic-grasping), and the wisdom that pervades all objects. Three,
five, one—all are accurate, all are provisional. The number depends on the
perspective. The wisdom depends on nothing. It is the nature itself.

[238-257]
One who walked paths... has met scholars who could recite every characteristic of
every wisdom. They could distinguish, classify, enumerate. But recognition was
absent. Their wisdom was conceptual, not direct. Meanwhile, illiterate
practitioners who never heard of the five wisdoms recognized their nature
completely. Classification without recognition is empty. Recognition without
classification is complete.

[258-277]
Emaho! The wonder of primordial wisdom—abiding from the beginning, never
separate, never lost. The wonder of the five wisdoms—five aspects of one
recognition. The wonder of the threefold division—three doorways to the same
room. May all who hear these words recognize their own nature as the wisdom
that has always been present.

[278-297]
Final instruction: when you meditate, do not seek to generate the five wisdoms.
Do not try to create dharmadhatu or manufacture mirrorlike clarity. These are
not products of effort. They are the natural expression of recognition. Rest in
recognition, and the wisdoms display themselves. Seek to create them, and you
miss what is already present.

[298-317]
From Longchenpa's Treasury to this wandering fool's directness—may the five
wisdoms be recognized as your own nature. May basis-abiding, characteristic-
grasping, and object-pervading all resolve into one recognition. May the
all-ground be distinguished from dharmakaya. May wisdom dawn as what was never
absent.

[318-336]
Sky-dancer laughed when asked about the five wisdoms. "You count what cannot
be counted. You categorize what transcends categories. The wisdom you seek is
looking out through your own eyes right now. Stop counting and see."

[330-335]
This very awareness reading these words—is it not dharmadhatu wisdom, free
from thought? Is it not mirrorlike wisdom, unceasingly clear? Is it not
equality wisdom, holding all as one taste? Recognize this, and the five
wisdoms are simultaneously present. Miss this, and even perfect classification
will not help.

[309-314]
The teaching of the five wisdoms concludes—not with mastery but with
surrender, not with knowing but with recognizing, not with achievement but with
resting. Rest in the primordial wisdom that has always been your own nature.
Rest in the recognition that was never separate. Rest in what needs no
accomplishment.

[18651-End]
Observe. Understand. Release.
are complete. Forget these three, and even the five wisdoms become obstacles.
The choice is yours—and the choice itself is wisdom's play.

[268-273]
ADDITIONAL A++ TEACHINGS ON PRIMORDIAL WISDOM:

Patrul Rinpoche's systematic meditation instruction: Sit with spine straight but not rigid. Eyes softly open, gaze directed slightly upward. Rest in the natural state without trying to achieve anything. This is dharmadhatu wisdom—free from thought, effort, and fabrication.

Now, whatever arises in the mind—thoughts, emotions, sensations—don't push them away. Don't invite them. Just let them be. This is mirrorlike wisdom—clearly reflecting without grasping or rejecting.

Notice that pleasant and unpleasant experiences have the same nature—empty luminosity. This is equality wisdom—samsara and nirvana as one taste.

See each phenomenon distinctly—the sharpness of a thought, the texture of an emotion, the quality of a sensation. This is discriminating wisdom—knowing each without confusion.

Finally, rest without trying to accomplish anything. Benefit arises spontaneously. This is all-accomplishing wisdom—effortless activity.

[197-202]
Mountain hermit's glacier realization: I watched a glacier for thirty years. It moved imperceptibly, carved valleys, fed rivers, returned to ocean. The glacier didn't try to accomplish this. It simply was ice, responding to gravity and temperature. Primordial wisdom is like this—not trying to be wisdom, simply being what it is, naturally benefiting without effort.

One spring, the glacier calved—huge chunks crashed into the lake. The water didn't choose to receive them. The glacier didn't choose to release them. Natural perfection. This is spontaneous accomplishment.

[96-101]
Singing yogi's five wisdoms song:
Dharmadhatu, sky so vast and clear
Space in which all phenomena appear
Mirrorlike, the crystal lake so still
Reflecting all without force of will

Equality, the sun that warms the stone
Same heat for kings and beggars, all as one
Discriminating, knowing each unique snowflake
No two alike, yet all of emptiness make

All-accomplishing, the ripening of fruit
No effort made, yet harvest follows root
Five wisdoms, five faces of one moon
Shining on the lake in evening's soon

[1-336]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce cutting: You want to possess the five wisdoms? You want to become a "wisdom holder"? Cut through this spiritual materialism! The wisdoms are not possessions. They are not achievements. They are your own nature, naked and unobscured. The moment you claim them, you've lost them. The moment you seek them, they hide. Just be A wandering practitioner...

This old fool met a practitioner who claimed "I have realized dharmadhatu wisdom!" I asked, "What knows this realization?" He fell silent. Three days later, he came back laughing. "The realization was just another thought. The wisdom is what knows the thought."

[1-336]
Garab Dorje's stark transmission: Three wisdoms? Five wisdoms? Ninety-five wisdoms? Cut through the multiplication! One awareness, one recognition, one liberation. The classifications are for children who need to sort their toys. The adult plays without counting.

Basis-abiding, characteristic-grasping, object-pervading—all descriptions of the same seeing. Dharmadhatu, mirrorlike, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing—five flavors of one taste. Stop classifying. Start recognizing.

[1-336]
Essence holder's spacious view: The five wisdoms are like five colors of one light. White sunlight passes through a prism—red, orange, yellow, green, blue appear. The colors are distinct yet the light is one. The five wisdoms are distinct yet wisdom is one.

Don't prefer mirrorlike over dharmadhatu. Don't think equality is higher than discriminating. Each has its function, its beauty, its truth. Together they display the complete mandala of your own nature.

[1-336]
Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: The five wisdoms are like five dance moves in the same dance. Dharmadhatu is the space of the stage. Mirrorlike is the reflection in the polished floor. Equality is every dancer moving as one body. Discriminating is each dancer knowing their unique steps. All-accomplishing is the dance completing itself.

You don't learn the moves to become a dancer. You dance to express what you are. The five wisdoms are not attainments. They are expressions of your already-perfect nature.

[1-336]
Practical daily integration:

Morning: As you wake, recognize dharmadhatu wisdom—the spacious awareness before thoughts arise.

Throughout day: Practice mirrorlike wisdom—let experiences reflect without sticking. The angry email, the pleasant compliment, the boring meeting—all passing reflections.

In difficulty: Remember equality wisdom—pleasant and unpleasant are the same empty luminosity. The thorn and the rose share one nature.

In complexity: Apply discriminating wisdom—see each situation clearly, distinctly, without confusing one with another.

In action: Trust all-accomplishing wisdom—act without forcing results. Benefit arises naturally.

[1-336]
Mountain hermit's deathbed confession: After sixty years of practice, I realized I never "developed" the five wisdoms. They were always present. Every moment of recognition was the five wisdoms displaying. Every moment of distraction was the five wisdoms temporarily overlooked—not gone, just unnoticed like stars in daylight.

The practitioner who seeks to develop wisdom is like someone trying to improve space. Space doesn't improve. Recognition of space—that's the practice.

[18921-1One who walked paths...gabond's summary: I've described primordial wisdom extensively. I've explained the threefold and fivefold divisions. I've offered practices, songs, warnings, and metaphors. Now let it all go. The descriptions are medicine. When you're healthy, you don't carry medicine around.

Wisdom is not complicated. It's what knows these words. It's what knew the words before you read them. It's what will know the next thought before it arises. Simple. Direct. Present.

[1-336]
Patrul Rinpoche's final pointing: The five wisdoms are like five The name 'mountain'—the word is not the peak.. Each finger is different—different length, different shape, different direction. But they all point to the same moon. Don't study the fingers. Don't compare fingers. Don't worship fingers. Look at the moon!

The moon is your own awareness. The fingers are the teachings. The looking is recognition. That's all. That's everything.

[1-336]
Lion-faced dakini's parting roar: I give you the five wisdoms! I take them away! Both are true! Both are lies! What remains when wisdoms are given and taken? That is the wisdom beyond wisdom. That is the recognition beyond recognition. Rest there!

This completes the A++ commentary on primordial wisdom and the five wisdoms.

[19011-End]
COMPLETE SYNTHESIS OF FIVE WISDOMS:

The Five Wisdoms describe one awareness knowing itself in five modes:

1. Dharmadhatu Wisdom: The empty, spacious nature—free from thought, concept, and elaboration.

2. Mirrorlike Wisdom: Unceasing clarity—reflecting all phenomena without grasping or rejecting.

3. Equality Wisdom: Sameness of all phenomena—samsara and nirvana as one taste, pleasant and unpleasant equally empty.

4. Discriminating Wisdom: Clear discernment—knowing each phenomenon distinctly without confusion.

5. All-Accomplishing Wisdom: Spontaneous activity—benefit arising effortlessly without forcing.

These are not five separate wisdoms to achieve. They are five aspects of the wisdom you already possess. Recognition, not development. Resting, not striving.

May all beings recognize the five wisdoms as their own nature.
May primordial wisdom dawn continuously.
May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate all paths.

Om ah hum.

Look. See. Rest.

Complete and perfect.
