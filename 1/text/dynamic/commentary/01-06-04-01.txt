[8138-8142]
Four empowerments. Four openings. Four ways the nature recognizes itself. The vase
empowerment—outer form, inner meaning, secret recognition. The maṇḍala of
colored powders reveals what was never hidden. The Five Jñānas are not
achievements bestowed from outside. They are your own awareness, displaying its
nature to itself.

This old practitioner has sat in empowerment ceremonies for decades. He has
received the vase, the secret, the prajñā-jñāna, the word. But the true
empowerment occurred in moments of silence, when the ritual dropped away and only
recognition remained. The empowerment is not given. It is recognized.

[8143-8152]
The lineage from Vimalamitra to Legé-tsün—direct transmission, heart to heart.
The other lineages interrupted, they say. But what is lineage? Not a chain of
names. Not a history lesson. Lineage is recognition passing to recognition. When
teacher recognizes student, lineage lives. When recognition is absent, lineage is
broken, regardless of how many names are written on paper.

Three words. Lineage. Transmission. Recognition. The vase holds space. The
secret holds meaning. The prajñā-jñāna holds wisdom. The word holds
continuity. But the container and the contained are not two.

[8153-8171]
The seventeenfold classification of Mudrā—this is the wisdom-knowledge section,
most profound and easily misunderstood. Seventeen aspects: examining and
searching, attracting, examining channels, expanding Bodhicitta, training in
Dhāraṇī, generating bliss, preparation seat, descending bindu, body posture,
wind key, refining bindu, applying mudrā, sequence of bliss, applying view,
placing bindu, reversing for student, holding measure, relying on continuum,
offering gift.

This is not a checklist to complete. These are seventeen doorways to the same
room. Enter any one, and you enter all. The knowledge-woman is not external.
She is Prajñā herself—the wisdom aspect of your own nature. Attracting her is
recognizing she was never separate.

[8172-8190]
Four examinations: family, shape, color, conduct. The outer family classification
is not social hierarchy. Royal accomplishes Tathāgata family—symbolizing
primordial dignity, the innate sovereignty of awareness. Minister accomplishes
Vajra family—symbolizing discriminating wisdom that cuts through. Commoner
accomplishes Jewel family—symbolizing equality wisdom that holds all. Brahmin
accomplishes Lotus family—symbolizing purity from mud. Outcaste accomplishes
Karma family—symbolizing action without convention.

This old fool once believed Brahmins were superior practitioners. He sought
high-born teachers, rejected low-born students. This is confusion wearing
spiritual clothing. The classification is symbolic medicine for different
dispositions. All five families dissolve in the nature. All five wisdoms are
aspects of one recognition.

[8191-8201]
Inner family: daughters of yakṣa, god, nāga, Brahmā, Indra. These are not
human women. They are Karma Mudrā—energetic principles. Yakṣa represents
element earth, grounded and stable. God represents space, open and accommodating.
Nāga represents water, flowing and penetrating. Brahmā represents purity,
untouched by stain. Indra represents power, commanding and swift.

Each represents how wisdom meets method in different configurations. The master
of Kosala, Glorious Great Bliss, attained siddhi through recognizing these
principles—not through external union but through internal recognition of
wisdom meeting compassion.

[8202-8220]
Secret family: five types represented symbolically. Conch-Possessed—spiraling
energy, moving upward. Elephant-Nose-Possessed—reversed current, requiring
attraction. Lotus-Possessed—open and receptive, capacity for bliss. Deer-
Possessed—entering thinly, requiring expansion. Cow-Possessed—concealed,
requiring refinement.

These are energetic signatures, not physical characteristics to judge. The
classification helps recognize energetic patterns, not for hierarchy but for
appropriate method. The Lotus-Possessed represents nature most clearly
manifesting wisdom and bliss. But this is not superiority—it is one way among
five that recognition can dawn.

[8221-8240]
The seventeen aspects each have outer, inner, and secret meanings. Outer: the
form, the ritual, the visible practice. Inner: the energetic process, the subtle
body, the channels and winds. Secret: the recognition itself, beyond form and
beyond energy, the union of wisdom and method in awareness.

Do not mistake the levels. Do not reject outer for secret. Do not grasp outer
and miss secret. The outer is the gateway. The inner is the path. The secret is
the destination. But the destination was never separate from the gateway.

[8241-8260]
Mountain hermit practiced with all five types across his life. Each taught him
something different. The Conch-Possessed taught upward movement. The Lotus-
Possessed taught open receptivity. The Deer-Possessed taught patience with
subtlety. Each was a teacher. Each was the nature appearing in different form.

He said: "I sought the supreme type. I thought finding the right consort would
complete me. Finally I understood—the consort is my own nature. The searching
was the obstacle. The finding was always present."

[8261-8280]
Between the elaborate classification of seventeen aspects and the simple
recognition of union, we find no contradiction. The elaboration serves those who
need structure. The direct recognition serves those who can receive it. The
vase, secret, prajñā-jñāna, word—four empowerments elaborating what is already
complete.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: do not get lost in taxonomy! The five
types, the seventeen aspects, the four empowerments—all are fingers pointing.
Look at what they indicate, not the pointing itself. The union of wisdom and
method is not achieved through classification. It is recognized when
classification exhausts itself.

[8281-8300]
Thus established: the four empowerments mature body, speech, mind, and all three
simultaneously. This is the framework. The framework serves until it is seen
through. The maturation is not transformation—it is recognition of what was
never immature. The buddha-nature does not develop. It is revealed.

[8301-8320]
This old vagabond has seen practitioners collect empowerments like badges.
"I have received one hundred vase empowerments," they boast. The quantity is
irrelevant. One empowerment with recognition surpasses ten thousand without.
The empowerment is not in the ritual. It is in the recognition the ritual
points to.

[8321-8340]
The prajñā-jñāna empowerment is most easily misunderstood. It involves the
knowledge-consort, the examination, the attraction. But do not externalize this.
The consort is your own wisdom aspect. The examination is self-examination. The
attraction is wisdom recognizing itself. All seventeen aspects are aspects of
this one recognition.

[8341-8360]
Emaho! The wonder of the four empowerments—vase, secret, prajñā-jñāna, word.
The wonder of the seventeenfold classification—seventeen doorways to one room.
The wonder of the five families—five ways recognition manifests. All pointing
to what was never absent. All elaborating what is utterly simple.

[8361-8380]
Final instruction: when you receive empowerment, do not seek special
experiences. Do not wait for blessings to descend from above. The blessing is
your own nature blessing itself. The descent is recognition dawning. The
experience is the nature experiencing itself. Rest in this recognition.

[8381-8400]
From Vimalamitra to Legé-tsün, from teacher to student, from heart to heart—
may the lineage of recognition continue unbroken. May all who receive these
empowerments recognize their own nature. May the vase, secret, prajñā-jñāna,
and word all open into the same recognition. May the seventeen aspects resolve
into one wisdom. May the five families dissolve into one nature.

[8401-8420]
This old practitioner concludes. The empowerments have been described. The
classifications have been enumerated. The families have been distinguished.
What remains? Recognition. The wisdom is your own nature. The method is your
own display. Their union is continuous. Recognize this, and all empowerments
are complete.

[8421-8440]
Sky-dancer laughed when asked about the supreme consort type. "You seek the
perfect form, the right characteristics, the ideal configuration. Meanwhile,
the wisdom you seek is looking out through your own eyes. Stop searching for
the perfect consort. Recognize the perfect nature."

[8441-8460]
Between the systematic precision of seventeen aspects and the spacious
recognition of union, we find the vast middle way. Not rejecting structure, not
grasping it. The ocean holds all rivers while remaining undisturbed. The
empowerment contains all methods while being free from all methods.

[8461-8480]
One last secret: the word empowerment, fourth and highest, is not really fourth.
It contains all four. It is not really highest. It includes all levels. The
word points to what is beyond words. The transmission transmits what was never
separate. Recognition is the only empowerment. Everything else is preparation.

[8481-8500]
Emaho! May all beings receive the four empowerments and recognize them as their
own nature. May the seventeen aspects be seen as seventeen aspects of one
recognition. May the five families be realized as five expressions of one
wisdom. May the union of wisdom and method be recognized as continuous and
never separate.

[8501-8520]
This very awareness reading these words—is it not already empowered? Has it not
already recognized itself in countless moments? The empowerment is not
something that will happen. It is happening now. Recognize this, and the
ceremony is complete. The transmission is received. The nature is realized.

[8521-End]
The teaching of the four empowerments concludes—not with accumulation but with
recognition, not with methods but with resting, not with perfection but with
seeing the perfect nature. Rest in this. The vase is full. The secret is open.
The wisdom is present. The word is spoken. All is complete.
