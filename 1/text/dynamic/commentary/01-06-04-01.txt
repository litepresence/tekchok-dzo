The four empowerments. Vase, Secret, Prajñā-Jñāna, and Word. Each opens a different dimension of recognition. The maṇḍala of colored powders reveals the Five Jñānas—the wisdoms that are the nature of rigpa itself. This is not external. It is the display of your own awareness, recognizing itself.

Three words. Enter. Recognize. Rest. The maṇḍala is not a place you go. It is the nature displaying itself. The Five Jñānas are not achievements. They are what you are when recognition dawns. The empowerment is not given. It is recognized.

This old practitioner has received empowerments. He has given empowerments. The true empowerment is not in the ritual. It is in the recognition that the ritual points to. The vase holds water. The secret holds meaning. The prajñā-jñāna holds wisdom. The word holds transmission. But the holding is already happening.

[8143-8152]
The lineage from Vimalamitra to Legé-tsün. Direct transmission. The other lineages from Guru Jo-ber interrupted. This is not mere history. It is the continuity of recognition. When teacher recognizes student, lineage continues. When recognition is absent, lineage is broken. The hand-blessing is symbolic. The real blessing is the nature blessing itself.

Thus. We proceed. The four empowerments have specific functions. Vase empowerment matures the body. Secret empowerment matures speech. Prajñā-jñāna empowerment matures mind. Word empowerment matures all three simultaneously. This is the framework. The framework points to what is beyond framework.

[8153-8171]
The seventeenfold classification of Mudrā. The inner meaning of Prajñā-Jñāna empowerment. This is the wisdom-knowledge section, most profound and easily misunderstood. Examining the knowledge-woman is examining the nature of wisdom. Attracting her is recognizing what was never separate. The classifications are precise. The meanings are symbolic.

The seventeen aspects: examining and searching, how to attract, examining channel characteristics, expanding Bodhicitta, training in Dhāraṇī, methods for generating bliss, special preparation seat, descending conventional Bindu, body posture, wind key, refining Bindu, applying Mudrā of Great Bliss, sequence of bliss, applying View, placing Bindu, reversing for student, holding measure of experience, relying on continuum, offering gift. Each has outer, inner, and secret meanings.

From Oddiyana, I see these seventeen as seventeen doors. Each door opens to the same room. The knowledge-woman is not external. She is Prajñā herself—the wisdom aspect of your own nature. Attracting her is recognizing she was never absent. The channels are not physical. They are energetic pathways of wisdom.

[8172-8190]
Four examinations through conduct. Family, shape, color, and the door of examination. The outer family classification: royal accomplishes Tathāgata family, minister accomplishes Vajra family, commoner accomplishes Jewel family, Brahmin accomplishes Lotus family, outcaste accomplishes Karma family. This is not social hierarchy. It is symbolic of how different natures connect with different wisdom aspects.

This old fool once thought some families were superior. He thought Brahmins had better chances at realization. This is confusion. The classification is symbolic. Royal symbolizes primordial dignity. Outcaste symbolizes action without convention. All can recognize. The families are medicine for different dispositions.

All five families dissolve in the nature. Tathāgata is mirror-like wisdom. Vajra is discriminating wisdom. Jewel is equality wisdom. Lotus is all-accomplishing wisdom. Karma is dharmadhatu wisdom. The consort of each family represents the activation of that wisdom in recognition.

[8191-8201]
Inner family: daughters of yakṣa, god, nāga, Brahmā, daughters of Indra. These are Karma Mudrā. Not human women. Symbolic of energetic principles. Yakṣa represents earth element. God represents space. Nāga represents water. Brahmā represents purity. Indra represents power. Each represents different aspects of manifestation.

[8202-8209]
The master of Kosala, Glorious Great Bliss, attained siddhi. Through recognizing the nature. The daughters of Brahmā and Indra represent wisdom principles meeting method. The attainment was not external. It was the nature recognizing itself through symbolic union of wisdom and compassion.

[8203-8237]
Secret family: five types represented symbolically. Conch-Possessed, Elephant-Nose-Possessed, Lotus-Possessed, Deer-Possessed, Cow-Possessed. These physical characteristics are energetic signatures. They indicate different configurations of vital energy. The Lotus-Possessed represents the nature most clearly manifesting wisdom and bliss.

Let us be precise. These descriptions are energetic taxonomy. They classify different types of vital energy. Black hair, beautiful teeth indicate balanced vitality. Different configurations indicate different energetic patterns. The classification helps recognize type, not for judgment but for appropriate method.

The Lotus-Possessed is supreme for generating bliss and clarifying dharmatā. The channel like a lotus—capacity for opening. This is energetic anatomy. The opening is recognition. The Deer-Possessed enters thinly—requires expansion. The Elephant-Nose, upwardly reversed—requires attraction. The Cow-Possessed, concealed—requires refinement. The Conch-Possessed, spiraling—requires extraction. These are energetic processes.

[8235-8237]
These five uphold the Five Wisdom Families. For making bliss the path, the Lotus-Possessed is supreme. The bliss is not ordinary pleasure. It is the bliss of recognition. The channel is not physical anatomy. It is the energetic pathway through which wisdom flows. The five types represent five ways wisdom can manifest.

[8138-8237]
Between the outer ritual form and the inner energetic meaning, between the symbolic empowerment and the recognition it enables, I weave this teaching. The seventeenfold classification is precise. The family distinctions are meaningful. But all point to one recognition—the union of wisdom and method in your own nature.

Three words. Wisdom. Method. Union. Everything else is elaboration. The four empowerments elaborate. The seventeenfold classification elaborates. The family distinctions elaborate. Strip away elaboration. Recognize the union of wisdom and method. That is the empowerment.

This old practitioner concludes this section. The empowerments have been described. The seventeen aspects have been enumerated. The families have been classified. What remains? Recognition. The wisdom is your own nature. The method is your own display. Their union is continuous. Recognize this.

Longchenpa presents these teachings with precision. For those mature enough to understand symbolically. For those ready to recognize that the ultimate empowerment is self-recognition. The maṇḍala is your own awareness. The Five Jñānas are your own wisdoms. The union is already accomplished. Rest in that recognition.

Three words. Empowerment complete. Wisdom-method united. Rest.
