For this reason: We proceed. Transforming difficulties into practice—obstacles serve the path.

Beyond concept, awareness simply is—this is the showing.

Not found through analysis; awareness meets itself here.

A practitioner. Obstacle and path are one—recognition transforms.

Longchenpa indicates what words cannot reach pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The divider is divided—seeing this is the teaching.

Recognize immediately. Here is the nature—not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The deluded mind is wisdom not recognizing itself wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Third position, fourth position, fifth position—all crumble like sand castles before the tide! If multiplicity is the basis, then the basis becomes external and internal simultaneously—how can one thing be both? The basis becomes grasper and grasped—caught in the dualistic trap it supposedly transcends. The basis becomes the six collections—fragmented, partial, incomplete. This is not the basis but its degradation!

Recognition is immediate. Not far: the nature is present—it is this very awareness.

Grasping at meaning liberates itself when seen.

What is called delusion here is wisdom appearing as confusion wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Accordingly. The analysis. Language points past language.

The treasury was never closed—complete from the first.

The ground holds all paths.

Between scattered and gathered, the vast middle way opens. The seven positions are like seven blind men describing an elephant—each touches a part and claims the whole. The faults are endless because the attempts to capture the uncapturable multiply without limit. Are not these knowable dharmas? Yes—and their very knowability is their limitation. What was spoken is just like that.

This old hermit sits by the river watching leaves float by. Each leaf is different—some green, some brown, some whole, some torn. Yet all are water, all are leaves, all are floating. The basis is like this—not one leaf, not many leaves, but the floating itself. The seventh position attempts to say the basis is beyond existence and non-existence, but even this becomes a position to be refuted.

From Klongdrukpa: If primordial wisdom is not established as anything, being pure from the beginning, is the natural state without anything to place anywhere—if there were nothing, this contradicts being the expanse from which samsara and nirvana arise. If primordial wisdom does not exist, the liberation of Buddhas and sentient beings does not exist. The non-realized mind of delusion is not even possible without the subtle five lights that provide the ground (gzhi) for confusion itself.

Because the essence itself is primordially pure, sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted. Thus it is similar to the previous six bases—all positions dissolve when exposed to the light of direct recognition.

Third: establishing the non-dual basis of primordial purity and spontaneous presence as one's own system. This has two parts: the actual meaning and abandoning disputes regarding that. This is the definitive presentation, the crown jewel of all views, the secret treasury of the Great Perfection.

Voice 20 proclaims: The seven positions are like seven mirrors reflecting the same face. Each shows a different distortion, yet each points to the same truth. Don't worship the mirrors. Look at what they reflect.

In this manner. Obstacles are path wearing masks—recognition unmasks them.

The obstacle is the grasping; seeing it, it frees itself.

The text points beyond itself pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

This old hermit offers final word: The seven positions are seven rivers flowing to one ocean. Each river thinks it alone carries the water. But the ocean doesn't care which river brings the drop. Rest in the ocean.
