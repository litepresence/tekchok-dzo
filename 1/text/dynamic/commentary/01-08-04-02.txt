[1-9]
Thus. We proceed. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

[10-15]
A practitioner. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Thus. The analysis dissolves the analyzer. Categories collapse into recognition.

[16-21]
Recognize immediately. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

[22-29]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Third position, fourth position, fifth position—all crumble like sand castles before the tide! If multiplicity is the basis, then the basis becomes external and internal simultaneously—how can one thing be both? The basis becomes grasper and grasped—caught in the dualistic trap it supposedly transcends. The basis becomes the six collections—fragmented, partial, incomplete. This is not the basis but its degradation!

[22-33]
Accordingly. The analysis. 

After centuries of concealment: the treasure was never hidden. Rediscovery reveals what was always present.

Ground itself. Path complete.

[24-33]
Between scattered and gathered, the vast middle way opens. The seven positions are like seven blind men describing an elephant—each touches a part and claims the whole. The faults are endless because the attempts to capture the uncapturable multiply without limit. Are not these knowable dharmas? Yes—and their very knowability is their limitation. What was spoken is just like that.

[25-33]
This old hermit sits by the river watching leaves float by. Each leaf is different—some green, some brown, some whole, some torn. Yet all are water, all are leaves, all are floating. The basis is like this—not one leaf, not many leaves, but the floating itself. The seventh position attempts to say the basis is beyond existence and non-existence, but even this becomes a position to be refuted.

[29-33]
Because the essence itself is primordially pure, sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted. Thus it is similar to the previous six bases—all positions dissolve when exposed to the light of direct recognition.

[30-33]
Recognition is immediate. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[32-33]
Third: establishing the non-dual basis of primordial purity and spontaneous presence as one's own system. This has two parts: the actual meaning and abandoning disputes regarding that. This is the definitive presentation, the crown jewel of all views, the secret treasury of the Great Perfection.

[33-33]
In this manner. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.
