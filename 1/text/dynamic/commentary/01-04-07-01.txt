First: Appearing as object, the aspect of one's own consciousness arises outwardly only.

[5-6]
Example: When the image of a golden jewel hung upon a tree branch on the pond's bank appears in the water, the aspect of the jewel appears outwardly—just so, it is asserted.

[1]
The jewel on the branch. The reflection in the water. Are there two jewels? This old yogi sat by mountain lakes watching reflections. The moon in the water looked so real. Fish swam toward it. Birds dove for it. Yet no moon was drowned, no moon captured.

[1]
Consciousness projects outwardly, they say. Like the jewel's reflection appearing in water. But look closely—where is the reflection? In the water? On the surface? In the eye that sees? The example dissolves upon examination.

[1]
Stop. Recognize. Continue.

[3-6]
On this, divisions: First, asserting the number of aspects is the same as the number of consciousnesses. Second, asserting aspects and consciousness are split like an egg. Third, asserting aspects and consciousness as various and non-dual.

[5-6]
Same number of aspects and consciousnesses: every perception has its corresponding awareness. Like every reflection having its source. But this multiplication seems unnecessary. The water reflects all jewels with one surface.

[1]
Split like an egg: aspects external, consciousness internal. Shell and yolk, container and contained. This division comforts the analytical mind. But the egg is whole. The division is conceptual.

[1]
Various and non-dual: appearances multiply yet awareness remains one. Like one mirror reflecting many faces. The faces are various; the mirror is one. The reflections are non-dual with the mirror.

This scholar has examined all three positions. Each has merit; each has limitation. The Cittamatra analysis opens doors, but Dzogchen passes through all doors into the open sky.

[1-6]
Between the aspect and the consciousness lies the recognition that dissolves both. Not one, not many. Not same, not different. The nature of mind displays without displayer, knows without knower.

[1-6]
I have taught these analyses to train the mind. But the truth is simpler than any analysis. The jewel and its reflection—both are mind's display. The water and the branch—both are mind's display. What displays? Ask this and analysis ends.

[1-6]
Thus. The framework reveals: three positions on aspects and consciousness. The Cittamatra view, refined through analysis, points beyond itself.

[1-6]
Emaho! The reflection clearer than the jewel!

[1-6]
Rest in the aspect. Rest in the consciousness. Rest in the nature that transcends both.
