First: Appearing to meaning, the aspect of one's own consciousness arises only outwardly.

Example: When the image of a golden jewel hung upon a tree branch on the pond's bank appears in the water, the aspect of the jewel appears outwardly—just so.

Three divisions:
1. Number of aspects asserted same as number of consciousnesses
2. Aspects and consciousnesses split like an egg
3. Aspects and consciousnesses as various and non-dual

This addresses the Cittamatra analysis of how appearances relate to consciousness. The key question: Are appearances external objects, internal representations, or non-dual?

The answer from Dzogchen: Appearances are the self-radiance (rang snang) of awareness itself—not external, not internal, but the luminous display of rigpa.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.
