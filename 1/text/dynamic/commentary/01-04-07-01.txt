First: regarding objects that appear. When analyzed with reasoning. Not established as one. Not established as many. Beyond one and many. This is the way things abide. This is not philosophical position. This is how things actually are.

[2983-2986]
This fool. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[2983-2986]
Then he tried to find "many." Distinct phenomena. Inherently existent things. He never found them. Every "many" dissolved upon analysis. Into dependence. Into relation. Into emptiness. The search for many revealed nothing.

[2986-2990]
Beyond one and many. This is not both. Not neither. It is the transcendence of the framework itself. Like trying to count space. Is space one? Is it many? The question dissolves. The counting dissolves. Recognition dawns.

[2987-2990]
The Treasury uses reasoning—not to establish position. To dissolve positions. Not one. Not many. Not both. Not neither. This is the fourfold negation. Not as nihilism. As liberation from conceptual proliferation.

[2983-2990]
This practitioner warns: do not make "beyond one and many" into a position. "I am beyond one and many." That very statement is one. The beyond-ness is another. Both must be liberated. Even the liberation must be liberated.

[2983-2990]
Consequently. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[2983-2990]
Between the analytical negation of one and many and the direct recognition of Dzogchen, we find the complete view. Analysis shows what is not. Recognition shows what is. Together, they point beyond both showing and not-showing.

[2984]
The example of the jewel and its reflection in water—the image appears outwardly, yet where is it? In the jewel? In the water? In the eye that sees? Each answer dissolves into the next. This is how things appear without inherent existence.

[2986-2988]
Three assertions about aspects and consciousness: equal in number, split like an egg, various yet non-dual. These are philosophical positions. Useful for clearing confusion. But do not stop there. Where is the one who asserts?

[2988]
Recognition is immediate. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[2983-2990]
A yogi once meditated on the Madhyamaka reasoning for seven years. He could refute any position. He could demonstrate emptiness to any opponent. One day a child asked him: "What is left when all positions are gone?" The yogi could not answer. The silence that followed was his first genuine recognition.

[2983-2990]
Thus established. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[2983-2990]
A simple monk.
 The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
