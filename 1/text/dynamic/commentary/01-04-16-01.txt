[3766-3785]
The first is explained: The essence is liberated through direct seeing of the nature (rang bzhin). The abiding is self-purified.

When divided: Ocean Space and Sky Space—these two.

The essence of Ocean Space, eternally self-liberated beyond extremes. Liberated through non-action, it is liberation itself. Without the two extremes of multiplicity. These divide into: Great Ocean Space and Small Ocean Space.

[3772-3785]
Ocean Space—rgya mtsho'i klong. Great ocean, vast expanse. Eternally self-liberated beyond extremes. Liberation without action, not through doing, but through being.

Great Ocean Space: Mind's self-abiding emptiness, primordially liberated. When relied upon, mind-emptiness thoroughly purified. The self-purified dharmatā of appearance-emptiness, from the beginning inexpressible.

Abiding in the single great wheel of suchness's transcendence, it is empty. By emptiness, nowhere is anything established.

Small Ocean Space: Through self-purified reliance, the mind is without stain. Through particular abiding in purity, conditions are from the beginning inexpressible.

[3766-3791]
This hermit. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Great Ocean Space: the vast mind, empty from the beginning. Small Ocean Space: particular conditions, each pure in its own place. Like different rivers all flowing to the same sea.

Sky Space—nam mkha'i klong. Not even the water, but the space that holds it. More vast still.

[3786-3791]
See what is. Rest in recognition. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The essence of Sky Space: Dharmatā, being uncontrived, the mind is self-liberated.

Two divisions: Sun-Moon Space and Jewel White Space.

First: The essence is utterly pure emptiness. Self-nature unborn, primordially liberated.

Second: Qualities completely perfected, causes and conditions self-purified. Through non-action toward the mind, dharmatā spontaneously accomplished.

[3792-3803]
Sever! The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Sun-Moon Space: essence utterly pure emptiness, self-nature unborn, primordially liberated.

Jewel White Space: qualities perfected, causes and conditions self-purified. No action needed, dharmatā spontaneously accomplished!

The Infinite Space expanse: when appearing to mind, known. When not appearing, known by mode of abiding.

[3800-3813]
SUDDEN. Fourfold Infinite Space! The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Outer Infinite Space: free from action.
Inner Infinite Space: view's own position.
Secret Infinite Space: radiance and obstacle-removal.
Infinite Space of that-which-is itself.

Through causelessness, no reversal.
Through conditionlessness, whatever appears is unharmed.
Through absence of both cause and condition, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa nowhere established.

[3804-3813]
First: Through causelessness, no reversal—key point. Through conditionlessness, whatever appears is unharmed—key point. Through absence of both cause and condition, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa nowhere established—key point.

Also: Through uncontrivance toward mind, the activity of dharma is the key point of non-transcending non-saṃsāra. Through mind without cause-sign, the non-dual object of desire.

[3810-3831]
Second: Through not relying on the eight vehicles, the exertion of progression is abandoned. Though appearances arise in manifold forms, liberation comes from the one—not-ceased self-nature arising.

The ultimate of Great Perfection's accomplishment: Self-appearance, directionless, all-pervasively self-arising. Whatever is not rejected is completely perfected. The basis of all phenomena, in whatever direction, is not exceeded.

Third: Appearance, when drawn into mind, the rays of self-awareness clearly manifest. Appearance not rejected, completely perfected. The rays of mind's continuity, through recollection and meditation clearly manifest—recollection and meditation perfected in dharmatā.

[3823-3831]
The Great Perfection of self-arising desire:
Through view being non-existent, beyond conceptual imputation.
Through meditation being non-existent, without acceptance, rejection, negation, or establishment.
Through conduct being non-existent, action is liberated in dharmatā.
Through result being non-existent, non-attainment abides in itself.

Four withouts—without view, without meditation, without conduct, without result. Yet not nihilistic emptiness. Liberation in dharmatā, abiding in itself.

[3837-3858]
These gathered into three:
The space free from action: through non-doing, liberated into dharmatā of self-liberation. Through actionlessness, liberation is liberation.

The space of ornament: appearance is the continuity of mind, the ornament free from grasping mind-as-empty.

The space of play: the play without direction, unceasing, arises. The transformation of appearance and mind does not occur.

The space of dharmatā: abiding uncontrived, self-arisen, whatever arises is not. The basis is uncontrived emptiness, seeing and knowing are non-dual.

[3845-3858]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what binds What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. Recognition is immediate.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

"Non-arising, non-ceasing, nowhere to be conceived."

"For the sake of liberating all into the completely pure path."

"The peak of emptiness is completely good, beyond all."

[3859-3869]
The section distinguishing the threefold teaching—the supreme complete teaching of the path that is distinctive. The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. The essential point of the path is the essential point of entering the essence, like a spark striking flint.

Three manners: oral transmission, symbolic instruction, self-arisen tantric scripture.

The essence of oral transmission: The path of action, beyond the intellect, is practiced. The instruction that cuts the extremes of fixation. The instruction that manifests the confidence of liberation and the purity of means.
 The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[3766-3869] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The threefold space—Ocean Space, Sky Space, Infinite Space—are not external locations but dimensions of awareness. Ocean Space: mind's vastness. Sky Space: mind's openness. Infinite Space: mind's limitlessness. All three are your own nature.

[3766-3869] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old fool once sought these spaces! Thought they were realms to travel to. Then understood: they are right here, right now. The ocean is this mind. The sky is this awareness. The infinite is this recognition.

[3766-3869] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The fourfold division of Infinite Space—outer, inner, secret, suchness—corresponds to four aspects of recognition. Outer: freedom from action. Inner: view's position. Secret: radiance and obstacle removal. Suchness: what truly is.

[3766-3869] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Spaces! Divisions! All concepts! Cut through them! Can you find Ocean Space? Can you grasp Infinite Space? They are awareness appearing as space! FIND THE AWARENESS!

[3766-3869] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Ocean. Sky. Infinite. Stop. Three names for one space. Three fingers pointing at one moon. Stop at ocean, miss sky and infinite. Stop at sky, miss ocean and infinite. See through all three. Rest in awareness.

[3766-3869] Voice 08 (Integrator): The integration of three spaces into one awareness: Ocean Space integrates depth. Sky Space integrates height. Infinite Space integrates limitlessness. Integration means all three are present simultaneously in every moment of recognition.

[3766-3869] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The essence of all spaces: they are not separate from awareness. Ocean is awareness appearing deep. Sky is awareness appearing open. Infinite is awareness appearing limitless. This is the secret essence.

[3766-3869] Voice 12 (Ecstatic): Emaho! The Ocean Space! The Sky Space! The Infinite Space! What vastness! What openness! This yogi dances in these spaces—not as places but as recognition!

[3766-3869] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thus the presentation of three spaces concludes. May all who encounter this recognize their own mind as ocean, as sky, as infinite. May they rest in that recognition. Complete.

[3766-3869] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond's final word: You are the ocean. You are the sky. You are the infinite. Stop seeking spaces. Rest in awareness. Complete.

[3766-3869] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Final words. Space. Awareness. Same. Stop. The teaching on spaces is complete. The spaces are awareness. You are complete. Rest. The end.
