No example of dying then returning. Think only death This is the treasury's heart.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

, not wandering even instant-moment. Bodhicaryavatara: "Day and night, I should only think this."

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

This life's mind not reversed until practicing concentration

[13341-13360]
—other Dharma activities aside, only this heart-thinking needed. Recognition is immediate.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Nothing deeper for reversing samsara!

Great master Padma

[13361-13380]
also stated: "Impermanence without distraction, death spur—day-night intervals always meditate." Thus though far, think samsara's formation-destruction, life impermanent; though near, think instant-moment, life impermanent.

Faculties and objects impermanent

[13381-13400]
—situations change; retinue and possessions impermanent—now exist, now gone; parents and relatives impermanent—gone then none; land and neighbors impermanent—much separation; time and age impermanent—appearance changes; happiness-suffering, enemy-friend impermanent—like traveler's inn. This is the treasury's heart.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Emaho!

[13401-13420]
: all sentient beings sleep on birth-death, wear happiness-suffering clothes, spread grasping-fixation's bed, sleep self-grasping's sleep, dream habitual patterns' dreams. Three realms' samsara house where five poisons feast—beings too, sleeping then rising, no beginning-end or awakening time.

Thus thinking

[13421-13450]
, now must exert effort for liberation means from samsara's dark house! Karma and afflictions controlled, samsara person; though impermanence manifest, grasping truth; fallen into birth-death river, not knowing liberation; experiencing sufferings, no weariness time.

Separated from true friends

[13451-13480]
, no path-showing protector, wandering in ignorance darkness. Thus thinking, this difficult leisure—produce joyful mind or practice Dharma. Supreme guide, captain—meeting qualified gurus, obtaining profound supreme Dharma nectar, now with effort cross samsara ocean's further shore.

Life impermanent like sunset mountain shadow

[13481-13500]
; cliff tree wind-moved; cloud-lightning like grass-tip dew—quickly going to death. If now not thinking "I will die," lazily distracted, death-time no help.

Thus now as fallen from above

[13501-13520]
, fear-terror-panic, practice essence meaning. From now I too, forest flowers, empty of people, waterfall sound, solitary pleasant cliff mountain dwelling, thinking "essenceless four times," virtue as ornament, world-built, supreme nectar obtained.

Emaho!

[13501-13520]
, peaceful Dharma cloud canopy, vidyadhara buddhas' golden lightning flashing, this life's clear light essence accomplished. The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

From liberation's mansion jewel palace

[13521-13540]
, peaceful Dharma drum sound resounding, all migrators ignorance sleep awakened, original ground manifest enlightenment. The nature is complete.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Weariness mind nature clear

[13541-13560]
, going alone to peaceful forest, heart-wishing prayer words spoken—virtuous devotion quickly accomplish. Rest in this understanding.

These are interim verses

[13561-13580]
. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Second: death signs investigation

[13581-13600]
. Thalgyur states: "Death signs also twenty-one; gone to charnel ground, solitary place, worship guru and give; moreover with food and drink, satisfy other beings; then investigate outer-inner-secret death signs."

Thus generally

[13601-13630]
, not knowing when death comes, investigate with mo, pra, etc., surpassing worldly outsiders. Yogins determine time: gone to empty valley, forest, charnel ground, jungle, mountain area, etc.; examine life-form, etc.

Sun-Moon Union: "Death-lord demon rising, death-point bardo thus examine; solitary place or empty valley, death time grasping is crucial."

Emaho!

[13621-13660]
has uncommon and common. Uncommon: sky-space reflection becoming impermanent, dissolving; no moon-form, death. Limbs four parts broken, four months; above that head broken, three months; upper-lower separated, two months; gathered lump, one month. Know that timing!

Sky-earth connection cord

[13661-13694]
: if broken, nineteen days not exceeded. From Sumeru's side, white lion not descended—sixteen days certainly.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[13662-13689]
Listen here, you fortunate ones! The text reveals how the mandala of the five Buddha families unfolds within the heart center. Like a master craftsman arranging precious jewels, the deities appear in perfect symmetry—Maitreya and the eight bodhisattvas in the eight directions, the eight goddesses of delight, and the guardians of the gates. Each Buddha sits upon a throne of lions, elephants, horses, peacocks, and garudas

[13666-13669]
, radiant as sun and moon upon lotus seats in vajra posture. The nature is complete.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

You must understand—though your physical body seems absent at this time, the imprint of self-grasping still lingers like a dream [13684]. The light body manifests from the habitual tendencies not yet exhausted. What appears as external light is actually your own display, like reflections in a mirror. Do you see? The light rays streaming from the heart bind you to these visions through the connection of your own radiance

[13687-13688]
. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

This is the stage where recognition is everything. The deities appear not as external gods to be worshipped, but as the play of your own awareness. If you recognize this, you are liberated. If not, you wander further into confusion.

Emaho!

[13690-13694]
My dear students, pay close attention to what is being taught here! Rest in this understanding.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[13690-13692]
. This is not mere imagination—it is the actual connection of your own radiance, like light passing through crystal. When you see this with your own eyes, the conceptual mind ceases and you rest in natural meditation [13693].

The essential instruction for non-returning is given here: the five light rays coil together like a horse's tail [13694]. At first, awareness enters into the light—when you look at these appearances, recognize them as your own display and rest in that recognition
