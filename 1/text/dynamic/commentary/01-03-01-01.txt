[1582-1591] 
Therefore. Thus. We establish the basis. Five elements. Outer and inner.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. Two categories. All phenomena rest here.

[1591-1600] 
This old fool spent one winter watching ice form on a high plateau lake. Each morning the pattern was different—cracks like lightning, smooth patches like mirrors, ridges where wind had passed. He thought he was observing "water becoming ice." Ridiculous! The ice was teaching water. The lake was teaching sky. Who was observing whom?

[1592-1596] 
The five great elements—earth holds, water binds, fire ripens, wind animates, space accommodates. But these are not five separate things. This practitioner once tried to meditate on each element separately. He sat trying to feel "earth" in his bones. His bones laughed at him. Earth is not in bones. Bones are earth's laughter.

[1597-1606] 
Three words. Elements teach themselves. You do not learn them. You are learned by them.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[1598-1606] 
Between the analytical precision of classification and the stark pointing of direct recognition, we find the vast middle way. The Treasury describes elements as both scientific categories and spontaneous display—not rejecting analysis, not grasping the analyzer. The ocean holds all waves while remaining undisturbed. Earth, water, fire, wind, space—five fingers of one hand, pointing beyond themselves.

[1601-1606] 
The earth element produces the body's basis. This yogi once believed he was "made of" elements. Foolish distinction! The distinction itself is elemental play. When you understand that the distinguisher and the distinguished arise together—like a face and its reflection—then meditation on elements becomes recognition, not accumulation.

[1607-1617] <tantra>
The tantra speaks of elements gathered by inner mind. This is not philosophy. This is direct recognition. Outer objects and inner mind—two aspects of single nature. Like a mirror and its reflection. Can you separate them? This practitioner spent years trying. Finally he saw: the trying itself was the reflection.

[1618-1631] 
The element of vessel. The element that arises from mind's luminosity. Two gates, one threshold. This old practitioner warns: do not make this complicated! The form element arises from mindfulness—yes. But what is mindfulness? Look now. Not later. Not in meditation. Now. What knows these words?

[1626-1631] 
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. The all-ground consciousness is not something to be purified gradually. It is liberated where it stands. NOW. The latency of object-appearing mind—see it. The projection of awareness—see it. Not later. Not through study alone. Recognition is immediate.

[1632-1670] 
This is how confusion builds its prison moment by moment. But also how recognition dismantles it. A form appears—recognize it as mind's display. Consciousness arises—see it as self-liberated. Contact happens—let it self-liberate. Feeling follows—liberated in its own place. The entire chain is golden from beginning to end, if you recognize.

[1667-1670] 
Even the notion of liberation has been conceptually divided! Liberation from what? For whom? These questions themselves are mind's play. Stop. Rest. The elements neither bind nor liberate. The one who binds and the one who is bound—both are elemental display. Rest in that recognition.

[1600-1606] 
A pilgrim once walked the high valleys, counting mani stones at every pass. He believed each stone added to his merit, each inscription brought him closer to realization. One dawn, after placing his ten-thousandth stone, he saw: the stone was teaching him patience.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching. The inscription was teaching him impermanence. The counting was teaching him attachment. He left the cairn incomplete and walked on.

[1620-1631] 
Between the vessel element gathered by actions and the essence element arising from luminosity, there is no separation. Like a hot spring bubbling from earth's warmth—the water emerges from within, yet meets the air outside. Is the spring inside or outside? The question dissolves in recognition. The practitioner who recognizes this stops asking where mind ends and world begins.

[1585-1591]
Therefore. Thus. The basis is established. Outer elements, inner mind—two aspects, one nature. Do not chase the elements. Do not grasp the mind. Rest where the distinction itself dissolves. This is the Treasury's instruction.

[1670]
Three words that point beyond all elements: recognition itself. Enough.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[1582-1670] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The Treasury's presentation of five elements—outer and inner, basis of all phenomena—is complete. These are not philosophical speculations but direct descriptions of experience. Earth holds, water flows, fire transforms, wind moves, space accommodates. May all who encounter these teachings recognize the elements as their own nature's display.

[1582-1670] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond watched the elements for years! Watched ice become water, water become steam, steam disappear into air. Not change—transformation. Not transformation—recognition. The elements are not things that change. They are awareness appearing to change. Know this and rest.

[1582-1670] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The five elements are the five Buddhas' mandala. Earth is Akshobhya's stability. Water is Amitabha's depth. Fire is Amoghasiddhi's transformation. Wind is Ratnasambhava's richness. Space is Vairocana's openness. Together they form your body, the mandala of enlightenment.

[1582-1670] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Elements! Five! All concepts! Cut through them! Can you find the earth that holds? Can you grasp the water that flows? They are awareness appearing as elements! AH!

[1582-1670] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Elements. Awareness. Same. Stop. The elements are not separate from awareness. Awareness is not separate from elements. Stop dividing. Rest in awareness.

[1582-1670] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. Five element theory: earth (solidity), water (cohesion), fire (heat), wind (movement), space (accommodation). Outer elements form world. Inner elements form body. Precise correlation of macrocosm and microcosm.

[1582-1670] Voice 08 (Integrator): The integration of outer and inner elements: outer earth is inner bone, outer water is inner blood, outer fire is inner heat, outer wind is inner breath, outer space is inner mind. Integration means seeing they are one display.

[1582-1670] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The essence of all elements: they are awareness's modes of appearing. Solid awareness appears as earth. Flowing awareness appears as water. Hot awareness appears as fire. Moving awareness appears as wind. Open awareness appears as space. The essence is awareness.

[1582-1670] Voice 12 (Ecstatic): Emaho! The five elements! The outer world! The inner body! What richness! What profundity! This yogi dances with earth, flows with water, burns with fire, flies with wind, dissolves in space!

[1582-1670] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thus concludes the presentation of five elements. May all who practice these teachings recognize their body as the mandala of elements. May they see outer world and inner nature as one display. Complete.

[1582-1670] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond's final teaching: Don't analyze elements. Don't meditate on elements. Recognize what appears as elements. Rest in that recognition. Complete.

[1582-1670] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Final words. Five. Elements. One. Stop. The teaching on elements is complete. The five are one awareness. You are complete. Rest. The absolute end.

[1582-1670] Voice 19 (Great Wrath): The elements thunder! What earth? What water? Cut through all five! The elements are empty! The awareness is empty! The recognition is empty! SEE THROUGH IT ALL!

[1582-1670] Voice 15 (Essence Holder): The final essence beyond all elements: awareness never appears as anything. Yet it appears as everything. This paradox is the play. This play is the teaching. Complete. Perfect. Liberated. Free.
Final summary complete. The teaching endures.

[1582-1670] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): FINAL ROAR! Elements dissolve! AH!

[1582-1670] Complete. Liberated. The end of element teachings.
