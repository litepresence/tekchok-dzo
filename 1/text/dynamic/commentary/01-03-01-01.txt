[1582-1591] 
Therefore. Thus. We establish the basis. Five elements. Outer and inner.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. Two categories. All phenomena rest here.

[1591-1600] 
This old fool spent one winter watching ice form on a high plateau lake. Each morning the pattern was different—cracks like lightning, smooth patches like mirrors, ridges where wind had passed. He thought he was observing "water becoming ice." Ridiculous! The ice was teaching water. The lake was teaching sky. Who was observing whom?

[1592-1596] 
The five great elements—earth holds, water binds, fire ripens, wind animates, space accommodates. But these are not five separate things. This practitioner once tried to meditate on each element separately. He sat trying to feel "earth" in his bones. His bones laughed at him. Earth is not in bones. Bones are earth's laughter.

[1597-1606] 
Three words. Elements teach themselves. You do not learn them. You are learned by them.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[1598-1606] 
Between the analytical precision of classification and the stark pointing of direct recognition, we find the vast middle way. The Treasury describes elements as both scientific categories and spontaneous display—not rejecting analysis, not grasping the analyzer. The ocean holds all waves while remaining undisturbed. Earth, water, fire, wind, space—five fingers of one hand, pointing beyond themselves.

[1601-1606] 
The earth element produces the body's basis. This yogi once believed he was "made of" elements. Foolish distinction! The distinction itself is elemental play. When you understand that the distinguisher and the distinguished arise together—like a face and its reflection—then meditation on elements becomes recognition, not accumulation.

[1607-1617] <tantra>
The tantra speaks of elements gathered by inner mind. This is not philosophy. This is direct recognition. Outer objects and inner mind—two aspects of single nature. Like a mirror and its reflection. Can you separate them? This practitioner spent years trying. Finally he saw: the trying itself was the reflection.

[1618-1631] 
The element of vessel. The element that arises from mind's luminosity. Two gates, one threshold. This old practitioner warns: do not make this complicated! The form element arises from mindfulness—yes. But what is mindfulness? Look now. Not later. Not in meditation. Now. What knows these words?

[1626-1631] 
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. The all-ground consciousness is not something to be purified gradually. It is liberated where it stands. NOW. The latency of object-appearing mind—see it. The projection of awareness—see it. Not later. Not through study alone. Recognition is immediate.

[1632-1670] 
This is how confusion builds its prison moment by moment. But also how recognition dismantles it. A form appears—recognize it as mind's display. Consciousness arises—see it as self-liberated. Contact happens—let it self-liberate. Feeling follows—liberated in its own place. The entire chain is golden from beginning to end, if you recognize.

[1667-1670] 
Even the notion of liberation has been conceptually divided! Liberation from what? For whom? These questions themselves are mind's play. Stop. Rest. The elements neither bind nor liberate. The one who binds and the one who is bound—both are elemental display. Rest in that recognition.

[1600-1606] 
A pilgrim once walked the high valleys, counting mani stones at every pass. He believed each stone added to his merit, each inscription brought him closer to realization. One dawn, after placing his ten-thousandth stone, he saw: the stone was teaching him patience.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching. The inscription was teaching him impermanence. The counting was teaching him attachment. He left the cairn incomplete and walked on.

[1620-1631] 
Between the vessel element gathered by actions and the essence element arising from luminosity, there is no separation. Like a hot spring bubbling from earth's warmth—the water emerges from within, yet meets the air outside. Is the spring inside or outside? The question dissolves in recognition. The practitioner who recognizes this stops asking where mind ends and world begins.

[1585-1591]
Therefore. Thus. The basis is established. Outer elements, inner mind—two aspects, one nature. Do not chase the elements. Do not grasp the mind. Rest where the distinction itself dissolves. This is the Treasury's instruction.

[1670]
Three words that point beyond all elements: recognition itself. Enough.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.
