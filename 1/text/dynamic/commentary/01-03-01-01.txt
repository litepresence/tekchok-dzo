[1582-1591]
Therefore. Thus. We establish the basis. Five elements. Outer and inner. Two categories. All phenomena rest here.

[1592-1606]
The five great elements—earth holds, water binds, fire ripens, wind animates, space accommodates. But these are not five separate things. Earth holds, water flows, fire transforms, wind moves, space opens. The elements are not things; they are awareness's modes of appearing.

[1597-1606]
Three words. Elements teach themselves. You do not learn them. You are learned by them.

Between the analytical precision of classification and the stark pointing of direct recognition, we find the vast middle way. The Treasury describes elements as both scientific categories and spontaneous display—not rejecting analysis, not grasping the analyzer.

[1601-1606]
The earth element produces the body's basis. This yogi once believed he was "made of" elements. Foolish distinction! The distinction itself is elemental play. When you understand that the distinguisher and the distinguished arise together—like a face and its reflection—then meditation on elements becomes recognition, not accumulation.

[1607-1617]
The tantra speaks of elements gathered by inner mind. This is not philosophy. This is direct recognition. Outer objects and inner mind—two aspects of single nature. Like a mirror and its reflection. Can you separate them?

[1618-1631]
The element of vessel. The element that arises from mind's luminosity. Two gates, one threshold. The form element arises from mindfulness—yes. But what is mindfulness? Look now. Not later. Not in meditation. Now. What knows these words?

[1626-1631]
See the nature of what appears. The all-ground consciousness is not something to be purified gradually. It is liberated where it stands. NOW. The latency of object-appearing mind—see it. The projection of awareness—see it. Not later. Not through study alone. Recognition is immediate.

[1632-1670]
This is how confusion builds its prison moment by moment. But also how recognition dismantles it. A form appears—recognize it as mind's display. Consciousness arises—see it as self-liberated. Contact happens—let it self-liberate. Feeling follows—liberated in its own place. The entire chain is golden from beginning to end, if you recognize.
