[1-24]
The stains that cling to your body, speech, mind, and consciousness—these are not your true nature! Like dust settling on a mirror, they obscure but do not change what is already perfect and pure.

The four empowerments are the waters that wash these stains away. Body, speech, mind, consciousness—each carries four stains, sixteen in total. But look deeper! These sixteen multiply through elaboration-with and elaboration-without, sign and meaning, until thirty-two obscurations stand purified. Like a lotus rising through muddy water, you emerge unstained!

Listen well, practitioner! The teaching divides the stains systematically. First, the body carries stains from the four elements—earth, water, fire, wind. Each element divides further: earth has earth, water has water, fire has fire, wind has wind. These sixteen purify through the empowerments. Then the divisions multiply: hot and cold each divide, creating sixty-four. Sign and meaning each divide again—sixty-four more. Thus the body alone produces hundreds of apparent stains, all arising from element-play.

But what are these stains really? The text reveals: thinking virtue and non-virtue, prophecy and non-prophecy, grasping and rejecting—these thoughts are the very stains themselves! Who is the thinker? Search and you will find only empty space. Like searching for the color of the sky—you look everywhere and find nothing to grasp!

Doubt is the demon that binds you. Analysis is the net that ensnares you. Release the mind that holds objects variously! Let thoughts arise and dissolve like clouds in the vast sky of awareness. The thirty-two stains purify not through effort but through recognition—seeing their true nature as emptiness!

Emaho! The stains were never real!

The eightfold path of purification reveals itself: elaboration-with sign and meaning, elaboration-without sign and meaning, very elaboration-without, and extremely elaboration-without. Each doorway leads to the same primordial purity. Like rivers flowing to the ocean—all paths converge in realization!

These four divisions each have four purposes. For speech: expression, expressed, expression, expression—four seals that liberate. For mind: change, changer, changed, change—four seals that destroy. For consciousness: memory, thought, doubt, attachment—four seals that purify. The five doors hold objects, thought basis-consciousness arises. If not connected: meaning before-after, mind examining meaning—these are what the mind calls thinking.

Thus the self-face differs in each: outer, inner, secret, perfect—four-four, sixteen exist. The emanation difference shows extensively: body action relies on certain difference, Empowerment nature shows; number difference relies, action affliction purifies shows.

[25-38]
Four empowerments divide method and prajna two-by-two, eight purifications! Body's elements particular: earth and so on, each with four—earth's earth and so on—sixteen. Hot and cold two divisions make sixty-four, sign-meaning division's sixty-four empowerments purify! Also four elements each well divided: sixty-four. Pervading element general body and self-characteristic held actual body two divisions—earth has different bodies hundred twenty-eight. Similarly divided, water, fire, wind each hundred twenty-eight, three sets, combined five hundred twelve bodies ripen!

Thus outer body ripens, inner afflictions too: desire—looking, laughing, holding, embracing—four, each element's body four-by-four, sixteen. Delusion—dulled unknowing, obscured, intoxicated, greatly non-recognition mixed—four divided into four, sixteen. Hatred—hating, great hating, greatly hating. Pride—subtle, coarse, change, expand. Jealousy—light, heavy, agitated, subtle. Each sixteen, total eighty. These difference separate: element body different five hundred twelve each; affliction four-four number: twenty-twenty dwell. All sum: ten thousand one hundred forty-eight arise. Body affliction two count sum: ten thousand six hundred sixty purify stain.

Do you see? Five hundred twelve bodies without, sixteen afflictions within—all from element-play! Your confusion is element-dance! The elements play within you—earth solidity, water fluidity, fire warmth, wind movement. From these, all appearances arise. From these, all stains appear. But these stains are not separate from the elements themselves. The stains and their purification are one play. Like waves and water—not two.

[39-46]
Thus. We proceed. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

[47-57]

This fool. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[58-68]
Recognition is immediate. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The Treasury's path vast oceanic ground. What seemed journey was always waves on water never leaving water.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[69-79]
Accordingly. The analysis. Logical analysis: if liberation were gradual, it would be compounded. But recognition is uncompounded. Immediate.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[80-90]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who count their stains like beads on a mala! Those who catalog obscurations like librarians! They miss the point. One stain recognized is all stains purified. Don't multiply what needs to be dissolved.

Between purity and impurity, the vast middle way opens. The stains appear impure; their nature is pure. Like a dirty window—the dirt appears real, yet light shines through. The window was never separate from light.

This old hermit once met a student who wept over his many obscurations. "I am too stained to practice," he said. The hermit held up a dirty mirror. "Does the dirt prevent reflection?" The student looked and saw his own face. The dirt was beside the point.

[91-100]
In this manner. It is not that gradual practice is wrong. It is that recognition itself is never gradual. Immediate clarity.

[101-101]
A simple monk. THUNDER! Sudden recognition! Immediate liberation! No stages! NOW!

Thus. The path reveals itself as the ground. What seemed journey was always arrival.

[102-102]
What knows these words?
Diamond recognition indestructible immediacy. Pierces all gradualism. Now.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Contemporary mind makes distinctions. Contemporary recognition sees through. Direct. Immediate.

Now let me unfold what has been folded. The first section shows elaborate distinctions: elaborate-elaborate: Samaya drink water—outer. Elaborate-unelaborate: Mandala enters, deity shows name, Empowerment bestows—inner. Elaborate-very unelaborate: Sravaka vow gives, nine complete breath-out encouragement—secret. Elaborate-utterly unelaborate: vase certain, body seal perfect.

This also: vase certain palace relies, deity clear, Empowerment perfect—outer elaborate. Student body-deity produces, four elements purify, substance sun-moon gives—inner unelaborate. Consort gives, practice certain—secret very unelaborate. Sign meaning certain, word gives perfect—utterly unelaborate. Thus perfect four exist; other three must know.

The sixteen elaborate difference purposes: Body—four elements four destroy. Four elements—earth, earth etc. four separate—sixteen purify: purpose exists.

Second—unelaborate: four Empowerments self-face difference. Unelaborate-elaborate: body, speech, mind, consciousness four syllable place, four purify—outer. That unelaborate: three doors basis, effort beyond shows—inner. That very unelaborate: five objects path raises, five doors hair-release liberates—secret. That utterly unelaborate: realization special produces, perfect.

The four purposes: Speech object, expression, expressed, expression—four seal liberates. Third—very unelaborate self-face difference: That unelaborate: Mandala offer, request—inner. That very unelaborate: sky Mandala enters—secret. That utterly unelaborate: knowing self introduces, perfect. Four purposes: mind change, changer, changed, change—four seal destroys. Fourth—utterly unelaborate self-face difference: That unelaborate: gaze does—inner. That very unelaborate: four directions gaze stance relies—secret. That utterly unelaborate: go and perfect. Four purposes: mind think, memory, thought, attachment—four seal destroys.

Thus the empowerments purify: body, speech, mind, consciousness four stain purify, rely establish. That body: water collection Dharma collection, binding seal stain become. Fire: those ripen clear thing establish, stain become. Wind: those each action done, attachment self-tendency stain become.

For consciousness: memory object enter—stain. Think virtue non-virtue, prophecy not-prophecy four all provoke—stain. Doubt, examine—stain. Hold object various thought—stain.

The stains purify through the four Empowerments: elaborate-elaborate etc. four-four separate—sixteen. Those body, speech, mind, consciousness four each stain four-four—sixteen collection purify.

The first elaborate shows: elaborate-elaborate: sign elaborate, meaning elaborate—two. That unelaborate: sign meaning—two. Very unelaborate—two. Utterly unelaborate: sign meaning—two: eight. Thus unelaborate: sign unelaborate etc.—eight. Very unelaborate—eight. Utterly unelaborate—eight: thirty-two become. Body, speech, mind, consciousness four collection also. Thus separate thirty-two purify. Creation stage purify: purify know purpose exists. Thus purify stain thirty-two. Purify Empowerment thirty-two sum. Sixty-four purify-purify difference certain.

Now the third section unfolds: showing the means of purifying body and afflictions through divisions of number. From the four types of Empowerment, the path reveals itself systematically.

Walking the high passes... traversed these classifications in his youth. I memorized the lists, cataloged the stains, counted my obscurations. Years passed in compilation. Then one day, in a mountain cave, I saw: the stains are the purification. The Clouds pass through sky—the shapes are not the space. is not the moon. The list of stains is not the stains themselves. The map is not the territory. The moment I recognized this, the lists lost their binding power. The stains were never real to begin with—they were appearances in awareness, no more solid than reflections in a mirror.

The text reveals with precision: the stains arise from body, speech, mind, consciousness. These four each carry four stains—sixteen total. But these sixteen multiply through the elaborations: with sign, without sign, with meaning, without meaning, very elaborate, extremely elaborate—until thirty-two appear. Then sign and meaning divide again, creating sixty-four. Each sixty-four multiplies again through hot and cold, element and pervading, until the numbers become astronomical. Some might despair at so many stains. But the practitioner who understands sees: all these numbers describe the same one thing—ordinary mind appearances.

What is the practical application? The empowerments are not ceremonies performed externally. They are the recognition of what you already are. When you see the stains clearly, that seeing purifies. When you recognize confusion, that recognition liberates. The empowerments are the water that washes away the dust—but the water and the dust are both appearances in the same mirror.

The elaborate system exists for those who need structure. For the sharpest practitioners, one recognition suffices. For those with more obscuration, the elaborate path provides countless doorways, each leading to the same room. Every catalog of stains is a catalog of what to recognize. Every list of purifications is a point that liberation is possible. The Tibetan masters designed these systems with compassion—knowing that different minds need different approaches.

I have seen practitioners trapped in the elaboration. They memorize the lists perfectly but forget the pointing. They can recite sixty-four empowerments but cannot recognize mind's nature. This is the disease of the letter killing the spirit. Conversely, I have seen those who reject all elaboration as mere concepts—they fall into laziness, thinking enlightenment will happen spontaneously without practice. This is the disease of presumption. The Middle Way walks between: using the elaboration while not being bound by it.

The empowerments divide as method and wisdom. Method is the skillful means—visualizations, mantras, mudras, rituals. Wisdom is the direct recognition of reality. Together they form the two wings of the bird of enlightenment. Without method, wisdom has no vehicle. Without wisdom, method has no destination. In the Great Perfection, these two are not separate—they arise together, shine together, dissolve together in the single sphere of rigpa.

The number divisions show how vast the system is. The body ripens into five hundred twelve forms. The afflictions multiply similarly. In total, over ten thousand one hundred forty-eight stains appear. Yet all arise from the same source: the five elements playing within awareness. The elements are earth solidity, water fluidity, fire warmth, wind movement, space openness. These five are not outside you—they are your own body, speech, mind, consciousness, awareness. The stains and their purification are all element-play.

Thus, dear practitioner, whatever stains appear—whether thirty-two or ten thousand one hundred forty-eight—know this: they are all element-play. The elements dance within you. The stains are the dance. The purification is recognizing the dance as dance. The dancer was never separate from the dance. Rest in that recognition—the stains purify themselves, without effort, without doer.
