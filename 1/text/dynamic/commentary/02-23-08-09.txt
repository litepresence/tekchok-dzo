Second: corpse purification. Rest in this understanding. The corpse mandala—two cubits, saffron and good scent sprinkled, eight-petaled lotus with beautiful colors drawn, center jewel or white earth transformed, vase with mouth-ornament, neck-ring, dharani cord, pure water filled, four directions with coral or madder written.

The corpse purification—preparing the mandala. Two cubits of space. Saffron and scent. Eight-petaled lotus, beautiful colors. Center—jewel or white earth. Vase with ornaments—mouth, neck, dharani cord. Pure water. Four directions—coral or madkar. The preparation is the practice.

Seven words—and then silence. The corpse becomes the mandala. The purification is complete. The form is empty.

Vase five lights' mansion contemplated. Listen! Also own above, pristine awareness body variously radiating one seen. That certainty obtaining. That too shooting star-like. Emanation twenty-seven days capable of benefit.

The vase becomes the mansion of five lights. Pristine awareness radiates in many forms. One sees with certainty. The shooting star—the emanation benefits for twenty-seven days.

Middle's supreme: Nine days needed. Again gathered five days. Pristine awareness four days. Then again certainty obtaining. Whatever appearing all mirror-like realizing, seeing, stability obtained. Emanation also thirty days capable of benefit.

Three categories: supreme, excellent, middle. Supreme—nine days, five gathered, four pristine awareness, then certainty. Whatever appears—mirror-like, seeing, stability. Thirty days emanation.

Middle's excellent: Ten days needed. Again gathered five. Pristine awareness four days. Spontaneously accomplished appearance one day, then those bodies all non-dual realizing, Buddha. Emanation also thirty-one days capable of benefit.

Ten days to completion. Gathered five, pristine four, spontaneous one. All bodies non-dual—Buddha. Thirty-one days emanation.

Middle's excellent: Eleven days needed. Again gathered five. Pristine awareness five. Spontaneously accomplished one abiding. Then again certainty obtaining, all appearances light-house seeing, certainty obtained. Emanation also thirty-four days capable of benefit.

Consider this: Eleven days—five gathered, five pristine, one spontaneous. Light-house appears—certainty obtained. Thirty-four days emanation.

Middle's middle: Twelve days needed. Again gathered five. Separate body wrathful field ground one. Pristine awareness five days. Spontaneously accomplished one day abiding. Then certainty obtaining, stability obtained. Emanation also thirty-seven days capable of benefit.

Twelve days—five gathered, one wrathful, five pristine, one spontaneous. Stability obtained. Thirty-seven days emanation.

Middle's end: Thirteen days needed. Again gathered upper-lower six. Pristine awareness five. Spontaneously accomplished two abiding. Then whatever appearing butter-lamp mandala-like seeing, certainty obtained. Emanation also thirty-nine days capable of benefit.

Thirteen days—six gathered, five pristine, two spontaneous. Butter-lamp mandala appears—certainty. Thirty-nine days emanation.

The days are metaphorical—they represent stages of recognition, not calendar time. Some recognize quickly, some slowly. The "gathered" days are periods of confusion. The key is that liberation is possible at any stage—don't give up.

Don't cling to the numbers. Days represent stages of recognition. Some recognize quickly—nine days. Some take longer—thirteen days. The gathered days are confusion. Key: liberation possible at any stage. Don't give up.

Inside teacher Samantabhadra blue equipoise and with, yabyum's directions five families' buddhas. Above guru lineage contemplated, instantly invited, stabilized. OM AH HUM SV AHA and a hundred-thousand reciting. In the nature, nothing is missing.

Three words strike the vital point: Recognize. Rest. Return. The teacher Samantabhadra in blue equipoise with consort. Five families' buddhas in directions. Guru lineage invited. Mantra recited. Nature complete.

Intervals OM ABHYAGATAKYE: "So-and-so's negativity and obscurations all SHANTIM KURU YE SV AHA," saying. From dharani cord held, oneself Vajrasattva contemplated, light-rays embracing dharani cord going, guru and deity each kaya's part nectar descending, vase filling contemplated. The nature lacks nothing.

The dharani purifies: "Negativity and obscurations—all become peace." Holding the cord, visualizing Vajrasattva, light rays, guru and deity nectar descending, vase fills. The purification is complete.

The analyzer is analyzed—seeing this is the teaching. Confusion and clarity are not two—just recognition and its absence wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. The text points beyond itself pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The corpse purification—preparing the mandala, the vase, the dharani. The days represent stages. The emanation benefits beings. The recognition is complete. The teaching opens what was never closed.

[Final] The corpse purification practice: preparing the mandala, the vase, the dharani cord. Five lights' mansion arises. The practitioner visualizes Samantabhadra, the yabyum, five families' buddhas. Guru lineage invited, stabilized. OM AH HUM SV AHA—hundred thousand recitations. The dharani purifies: "Negativity and obscurations—all become peace." Vajrasattva visualized, light rays, nectar descending, vase fills. The stages of recognition: gathered days of confusion, pristine awareness days, spontaneous accomplishment. From nine to thirteen days—supreme to excellent to middle. Each stage produces emanation benefits: twenty-seven to thirty-nine days. The days are metaphorical—stages of recognition, not calendar time. Liberation possible at any stage. The corpse becomes mandala. Confusion becomes clarity. The purification is complete.

Emaho! The corpse mandala! The vase of five lights! The emanation benefits!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
