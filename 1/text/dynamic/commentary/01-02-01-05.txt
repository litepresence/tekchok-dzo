[999-1005]
The fourth tier of existence: the elevated-born guardians of the four directions. Virūpākṣa with eyes that see all—not physical eyes but the eye of wisdom that perceives the nature of reality. Virūḍhaka born of hearing, Dhṛtarāṣṭra guarding the land. These are not mere deities but archetypes of perception and protection, dwelling with their retinues in palaces surrounded by pleasure-groves. Sandalwood water on golden ground, divine blossoms to the knee—this is not geography but the architecture of heightened awareness.

—

[999-1423]
Renunciation arises not from fear but from wisdom. Not "I must escape or I will suffer" but "none of this is worth grasping, all of it is empty, the only true satisfaction lies beyond the entire spectrum." This is the wisdom that turns the mind toward liberation, toward awakening, toward the Great Perfection.

—

[999-1002]
Four pleasure-groves with their specific delights—chariots, armors, enjoyments, joys. Each direction offering different pleasure, each grove promising satisfaction. Yet the promise is false; the satisfaction temporary; the pleasure conditioned. Don't seek these groves; seek what transcends them.

—

[999-1393]
This extensive cosmological presentation has now received thorough commentary. The god realms, form realms, formless realms, and lower realms have all been explained. The purpose is clear: to generate wisdom that turns the mind toward liberation, recognizing that all realms are impermanent, conditioned, and unsatisfactory.

—

[1002-1007]
Complete. Recognize now. Liberated.

[1003-1015]
Symmetry inside and outside—the text describes what recognition reveals. When boundary dissolves between inner and outer, the symmetry becomes obvious, the equality apparent, the division seen as artificial. This is not cosmology; this is psychology of awakening.

—

[1005-1010]
The purpose of this description is not to satisfy curiosity but to generate renunciation. Seeing the entire spectrum of samsara—from the highest bliss to the deepest pain, from the longest life to the shortest, from the greatest power to the greatest helplessness—one recognizes that none of it is the goal. All of it is impermanent, all of it is conditioned, all of it is unsatisfactory.

—

[1006-1012]
The Sun's palace: fifty-one yojanas, base of fire-crystal. The Moon: self-arisen from water-crystal, fenced in gold and silver, four jewel towers. These celestial bodies are not physical planets but states of luminosity. Fire-crystal: the clarity of direct perception. Water-crystal: the reflective nature of mind. The measurements are precise because the states they describe are precise.

—

[1013-1019]
The Moon extends fifty yojanas; great stars eighteen and a quarter; medium between seventeen and two; small stars one yojana. Each circling the four continents by nature each day. This is the mechanics of attention—the great stars are stable attention, medium stars are wavering, small stars are flickering. All formed from gold, copper, water-crystal, or iron; all floating in forty-thousand yojanas of sky, radiating as light-rays. The sky is not space but the expanse of awareness.

—

[1016-1022]
Complete Gather Burst tree—central channel metaphor, root and branches, throne and rain. The tree that grants complete gathering, the throne of sovereignty, the falling flower rain of blessing. Yet even this tree is impermanent, this throne temporary, this rain passing.

—

[1020-1033]
Above, the spontaneously-arisen king of mountains: the Thirty-Three abodes. City, grove, ground, tree, five excellent assembly-places. Surrounding the city, Indra's palace; within, the Completely Victorious Palace at center. One hundred fifty yojanas each side, rising five and a half yojanas upward, eight stories, seven stacked houses, seven times seven rooms. This is the mandala of the mind—precise, structured, complete.

—

[1023-1037]
Dharma-Good assembly-place—round, perfect, surrounded. Three hundred wide, nine hundred around, the mathematics of perfection. Yet perfection in samsara is still samsara; completeness in conditioned realm is still conditioned. Don't settle for this perfection; seek what transcends perfection.

—

[1034-1047]
The numbers are not arbitrary. One hundred fifty: the perfection of the ten perfections multiplied by the fifteen aspects of the path. Eight stories: the eightfold path. Seven times seven rooms: the forty-nine days of the bardo, the completion of cycles. The palace is not a building but the structure of awakened consciousness.

—

[1038-1057]
The world becomes empty—this is withdrawal, recession, involution. Mountains remain but beings gone, essence attaching in stages. The four stages of manifestation: vapor, ripening, awakening, embodiment. This is cosmogony in reverse; this is how worlds end; this is imperience writ large.

—

[1048-1062]
Four pleasure-groves in the four directions. East: Chariot-Various-Possessing—with jewel trees, birds, beauty from many lakes, divine garments, music, nectar, nets of various jewels. South: Rough-Transformation—hard armors arising in battle. West: Enjoyment-Mixing—immeasurable enjoyment. North: Everywhere-Joy—free from sorrow, brilliant with joy. Two hundred fifty yojanas wide each.

—

[1058-1079]
Samādhi emanation body—neither existent nor non-existent, the subtle state between form and formlessness. Sūraṅgama samādhi: peaceful, blissful, luminous. Yet still samādhi, still state, still conditioned. Don't mistake this for liberation; it's rest stop, not destination.

—

[1063-1077]
The four groves are not gardens but qualities of experience. East: the arising of multiplicity. South: the transformation of obstacles. West: the mixing of enjoyment with emptiness. North: the joy that is everywhere, not localized, not dependent on conditions. Two hundred fifty: the completion of the ten perfections squared, minus the ego that would claim them.

—

[1078-1090]
Inside, ground spreads with golden sand, jewel flower-beds, lakes and ponds. Outside, similar ground, many flowers, equal measure to four parks. The symmetry is not decorative; it is the symmetry of a mind that has found its balance. Within and without are equal because the division was never real. What appears inside appears outside because there is no inside or outside—only appearance.

—

[1080-1101]
Fall from upper realms—the gods' tragedy. Lapse of samādhi, "what also not" nihilism, nothing-at-all despair. Even the formless realms end; even infinite consciousness ceases; even the base of nothingness passes. No refuge in any state; no safety in any realm.

—

[1080-1085]
Great Perfection transcends cosmology. Not higher realm but nature of all realms; not better state but essence of all states. Primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated—this is your nature, right now, as you read. Recognize it; don't seek it elsewhere.

—

[1082-1087]
Voice of the cosmologist: I have mapped the realms from the highest god realm to the deepest hell. I have measured their extents, counted their inhabitants, calculated their lifespans. Yet this map is not the territory. These realms are not places but states—states of mind, states of consciousness, states of being. They appear and disappear according to karma, according to conditions, according to recognition or its absence.

—

[1091-1097]
The tree at northeast: Complete Gather Burst. Root five yojanas down, branches spreading like an umbrella, circumference fifty yojanas curling. Jewel net, divine cloth hanging. Near it, white rock like armonig, fifty yojanas wide, Indra's throne, falling flower rain. The tree is the central channel—rooted deep, spreading wide, connecting earth and sky. The throne is the seat of sovereignty—not ruling others but ruling one's own mind.

—

[1098-1104]
Five yojanas down: the five wisdoms as root. Fifty yojanas curling: the ten perfections multiplied by the five elements, demonstrating completeness. The umbrella of branches: protection for all who gather beneath. The jewel net: the interconnectedness of all phenomena. The divine cloth: the drapery of appearances that adorn reality.

—

[1102-1125]
Jewel-box samādhi—precious but limited, valuable but contained. Adventitious confusion: the subtle ignorance that contaminates even refined awareness. Not primordial, not inherent, removable—yet clinging to it persists. E ma ho: wonder at the heart of confusion, Buddha-nature even here.

—

[1105-1119]
Assembly-place Dharma-Good: round, surrounded by jewel trees, three hundred yojanas wide, nine hundred circumference. Indra's throne, gods' seats arranged. Measureless houses in sky above, desire and form dwellers, spread like planets and stars. Double size for larger ones. The roundness is the shape of perfection—no beginning, no end, no corners where delusion can hide.

—

[1119-1124]
Perfection—transcend all.

—

[1120-1134]
Three hundred wide, nine hundred circumference: the ratio of pi, the fundamental number of circular perfection. Indra's throne at center: sovereignty of the mind. Gods' seats arranged: the various aspects of consciousness properly ordered. Measureless houses: the infinite aspects of awareness. Spread like planets and stars: the manifestation of mind as the universe.

—

[1126-1149]
Mind-Activity sky—consciousness becoming active, proliferating, expanding. Wheels meeting, beings multiplying, consciousness without end. Yet this expansion is still samsara; this multiplication is still delusion; this activity is still bondage. Life short, body small, light unclear: the decline begins.

—

[1135-1154]
Attached thus, yet one intermediate eon this vessel world becomes empty, free from beings. Mountains, hills, trees, grass, flowers remain. Valleys as forests, thickets, rain from sky expands jewel trees. Then essence attaches in four stages. Nectar rain releases vapor, ripens jewel trees of lotus nature. Wind goddesses, water dancing goddesses, naga sons—their mind-enters awaken latent seeds.

—

[1150-1171]
Great Cloud sky—density, obscuration, colored heaps. Four formless realms: infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothing-at-all, neither perception nor non-perception. Vast lifespans measured in thousands of eons—yet all end, all cease, all prove unsatisfactory. Peak of existence still within existence.

—

[1155-1174]
The world becomes empty: not destroyed but purified. The vessel remains; only the contents change. Mountains and hills: the structure of reality unchanged. Trees, grass, flowers: the ornament of appearance remains. The four stages of essence attachment: the progressive densification of consciousness into form. Nectar rain: the descent of blessing. Vapor: the subtle essence before manifestation.

—

[1159-1164]
This cosmological description is not mythology but psychology. The god realms are states of pleasure and attachment. The hell realms are states of pain and aversion. The human realm is the middle way where practice is possible. The geography describes the mind; the measurements indicate the duration of states; the inhabitants are aspects of consciousness.

—

[1172-1197]
Jewel ornament sky—five lights appearing, consciousness mass expanding. Peak of form, below formless, like rainbow or picture. Beautiful but empty, luminous but insubstantial, pleasing but impermanent. Body six thousand, life six thousand—numbers impressive but temporary.

—

[1175-1194]
Wind goddesses, water dancing goddesses, naga sons: the elemental forces that shape manifestation. Their mind-enters awaken latent seeds: consciousness activating the potential for form. Formless ripened consciousness becomes samādhi emanation body: the transition from pure awareness to embodied presence. Self-appearance completely pure: neither body nor not-body—the indeterminacy of the subtle state.

—

[1177-1182]
The purpose of all this description: renunciation, wisdom, turning mind toward liberation. Not fear of hell or desire for heaven but recognition that all is impermanent, all is conditioned, all is unsatisfactory. The only true satisfaction: beyond entire spectrum, beyond all realms, beyond samsara itself.

—

[1195-1216]
Samādhi emanation body: sometimes appearing, sometimes not. Thus called neither existent nor non-existent. These realms dwell on Padma-Stacked peak's sky. Immeasurable expansion from these, abiding in Sūraṅgama samādhi, peaceful samādhi's own light and bliss. Below, Mind-Play Wheel sky: one great golden vajra arose upward, immeasurable light-rays radiating, extremely beautiful, heroic.

—

[1198-1221]
Descending through jewel realms—deep blue, supreme beauty, hair fine, crystal house. Each lower than last, each less luminous, each more dense. No sorrow to joy-bliss: the spectrum of feeling, the range of experience, the variety of samsara. All temporary, all conditioned, all unsatisfactory.

—

[1214-1219]
The six realms: gods, demigods, humans, animals, pretas, hell beings. The three higher realms dominated by pleasure and attachment; the three lower by pain and aversion. Yet all are samsara, all are conditioned, all are impermanent. The gods' pleasure ends; the hell beings' pain ends; all move through the realms according to karma, none remain forever.

—

[1216-1221]
Purpose—turn mind.

—

[1217-1238]
Neither existent nor non-existent: the nature of the emanation body. It appears but has no inherent existence; it does not appear but is not non-existent. Padma-Stacked peak: the lotus throne of reality. Sūraṅgama samādhi: the samādhi that is the ground of all appearance. Own light and bliss: not dependent on external conditions but self-arisen.

—

[1222-1257]
Five pure abodes—without affliction trace, yet still with latency. Non-returners dwell here, advanced practitioners, those who won't return to lower realms. Yet they haven't achieved liberation; they're resting, pausing, preparing. Great fruit, but fruit that will be exhausted.

—

[1239-1260]
Mind-Play Wheel sky: the level where mind begins to manifest as play. Golden vajra arose upward: the indestructible nature emerging from the formless. Immeasurable light-rays: the unlimited potential of awareness. Heroic: not afraid to manifest, not bound by form, courageous in expression.

—

[1254-1259]
Animals, pretas, hells—the lower realms of ignorance, craving, pain. Driven by instinct, tormented by hunger, burned by fire. Yet even here, Buddha-nature present; even here, liberation possible; even here, hope remains. No realm is permanent; no condition is fixed.

—

[1258-1283]
The halving continues—sixty-four, thirty-two, sixteen. Merit declining exponentially, life shortening proportionally. Virtue increase in clouded realms: some debate this, some affirm it. The essential point: all descending, all temporary, all within round of becoming.

—

[1261-1282]
From delusion, upper beings go in samādhi emanation bodies. Seeing vajra, beautifully seeing—this is Sūraṅgama samādhi. Mind moved by emanation vajra, from those realms' nature-born realms, some drop-like surpassing cast. Upper samādhi lapses, "What also not" said. Only perception from above, dwelling without other. Immeasurable beings expand: called "nothing at all," called "slightly nothing."

—

[1269-1274]
Below humans, the animal realm: beings of instinct, driven by hunger and fear, living in ignorance and confusion. Below animals, the preta realm: hungry ghosts with immense bellies and tiny throats, tormented by unfulfillable desire. Below pretas, the hell realms: eight hot hells, eight cold hells, the neighboring hells, each with specific torments corresponding to specific misdeeds. This is the full spectrum of samsara.

—

[1283-1304]
From delusion: even the upper realms arise from a subtle confusion—the grasping at bliss and clarity. Drop-like surpassing cast: the fall from higher states, drop by drop, gradual but inexorable. "What also not": the recognition of emptiness that, if incomplete, leads to nihilism. Nothing at all, slightly nothing: the formless realms of near-annihilation, approaching cessation but not reaching it.

—

[1284-1311]
Great Brahma—even creator god born from desire, from subtle wanting, from fault of grasping. Some cut from source, fragmented, separated. Brahma reciting creation words, manifesting worlds through mantra—yet his worlds are temporary, his creation impermanent, his power limited.

—

[1293-1298]
Complete. May all recognize. May all be liberated.

—

[1305-1326]
Good samādhi appearance must arise from good samādhi: the law of cause and effect operates even in these refined realms. Going increasingly below, emanation body smaller, light less: the progressive densification of consciousness. Denial sound: "nothing at all"—the nihilistic tendency of these realms. Called ayatana: the sense-bases of the formless, dwelling in perception without form.

—

[1309-1314]
Four great kings, human realm, Jambudvīpa—guardians protecting samsara, humans able to practice, our precious world. Eight rivers, seven mountains, four continents—the geography of opportunity, the realm of liberation, the field of awakening.

—

[1312-1361]
Wish-fulfilling tree—grants desires but only conditioned ones, only samsaric wants, only temporary satisfactions. Emanation power—creates but limited, temporary, bound by karma. Two and half leagues, thousand six hundred years—impressive but measurable, vast but finite.

—

[1324-1329]
Jambudvīpa: the rose-apple continent, our world. Eight great rivers, seven great mountains, four great continents—the geography of human existence. Imperfect, challenging, mixed with pleasure and pain—yet this is the precious human realm where awakening is possible. The gods envy humans because humans can practice, can recognize, can liberate.

—

[1327-1350]
These dwell in jewel-box samādhi. Like noble tenet arrangement from common vehicle. Connected with mind-entering existence beings. Now too, adventitious confusion arises from moving unproven space awareness. From Secret Essence: E ma ho from Sugata heart, self-thought karma emanation. From Condense: when conditions gather, karma confusion wheel arises.

—

[1343-1348]
Below, heaven lord's four great kings: east, south, west, north, and four intermediate directions. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, Vaiśravaṇa—these four guardian kings with their retinues protect the four directions. Below them, the human realm: Jambudvīpa, our world, with its eight great rivers, seven great mountains, four great continents. This is where practice is possible, where liberation is achievable, where the Buddha appeared.

—

[1348-1353]
Four kings, human realm, Jambudvīpa—precious opportunity for practice.

—

[1349-1366]
The four great kings: guardians, protectors, watchers. Yet they guard the conditioned realm, protect the samsaric order, watch over the cycle of becoming. Their protection is not liberation; their guardianship is not freedom. They too are within the round, subject to birth and death, pleasure and pain, gain and loss.

—

[1351-1374]
Jewel-box samādhi: precious but contained, valuable but limited. Like noble tenet arrangement: systematic but conceptual, organized but fabricated. Adventitious confusion: the subtle grasping that arises even from space-like awareness. Not inherent but adventitious—arising from conditions, not from nature.

—

[1354-1359]
Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, Paranirmitavaśavartin—contentment, enjoyment, control. Maitreya waits, gods delight, victors control others' emanations. Yet waiting is not realizing, delight is not liberation, control is not freedom. Precise lifespans in threes—the magic of numbers, the prison of karma.

—

[1354-1375]
Animals, pretas, hells—lower realms, yet liberation possible.

—

[1362-1384]
Supreme joy, emanation joy, joy possess—pleasure piled on pleasure, bliss heaped on bliss. Yet pleasure ends, bliss fades, joy proves impermanent. 'Thab-bral fallen, Thirty-Three pinnacle—gods at height of desire realm, yet still within desire, still within realm, still within samsara.

—

[1374-1423]
First, below greatly expanded wish-fulfilling tree jewel: some Brahma expand, immeasurable beings—other emanation power do. Power over emanation appearance. Body two and half leagues, life thousand six hundred human years, own year sixteen thousand. Below, tree see beautiful: emanation joy, emanating hundred or thousand sons from body light. Body one and quarter leagues, life eight hundred human years, own year eight thousand.

—

[1375-1398]
E ma ho from Sugata heart: wonder arising from the Buddha-nature itself. Self-thought karma emanation: the world appearing from one's own karmic tendencies. When conditions gather: dependent origination operating even at these subtle levels. Karma confusion wheel: the cycle of confusion driven by subtle karmic traces.

—

[1376-1395]
Purpose: renunciation, wisdom, turning toward liberation.

—

[1379-1384]
Limit-Without, Full-Intellect, Yāma—beautiful names, impressive realms, vast lifespans. Yet limit has end, intellect lacks wisdom, time kills all. Continuous delight, immeasurable happiness—temporarily continuous, relatively immeasurable, ultimately ending.

—

[1380-1385]
Paranirmitavaśavartin: the highest of the desire realm gods, who control the emanations of others. Completely victorious: victorious over others but not over themselves, victorious in the world but not in the mind. The life span measured in precise units: three years, three months, three days—the magic of numbers, the precision of karma, the exactness of conditioned existence.

—

[1388-1423]
Five place classes without affliction trace: five pure class gods, noble places. Above ordinary three places, below jewel supreme beauty spread: some not-great gods fell, called great fruit—great virtue fruit. Body five hundred, life five hundred. Below, jewel kali beautiful: great fruit gods cut in dot manner, merit born from accumulated merit. Body two hundred fifty, life that much.

—

[1393-1398]
Below, separate Tuṣita: from Tuṣita two, immeasurable gods continuously delight and happiness. Body half league, life twelve and half human years, own year one hundred twenty-five. Below, separate Nirmāṇarati: from Nirmāṇarati fallen, immeasurable gods continuously delight and happiness. Body quarter league, life six and quarter human years, own year sixty-two and half. Below, separate Paranirmitavaśavartin: from Paranirmitavaśavartin fallen, completely victorious emanation gods. Body small half league, life three years three months three days three watches three hours three instants, own year thirty-one years two months.

—

[1394-1400]
Four guardians, pleasure-groves, sandalwood water—beautiful but binding. See clearly.

—

[1396-1423]
Below, jewel kekeru: light clear from above. Body eight, life eight. Below, jewel glory pile: measure without light. Body four, life four. Below, jewel brave light: light small from above. Body two, life two. Below, jewel keruja: great Brahma beings. Brahma from desire fault. Body two and half, life that much. Below, jewel samika: some cut from great Brahma, Brahma before recites.

—

[1396-1415]
Great Perfection transcends all—your nature, recognize it now.

—

[1398-1423]
Below, jewel ornament sky: five lights clearly appear, becoming one expanding consciousness mass. Immeasurable expand everywhere clearly—light mouth eye ear. Wind power moves, flies, hovers. Below-not, peak of form. Distinguish from limitless ayatana: this like picture or rainbow, outside light body. Body six thousand yojanas, life six thousand interval eons.

—

[1399-1422]
Like new birth, not new born: the emanation appears as new but is not truly born. Obscuration together-born with awareness: the subtle ignorance that arises simultaneously with awareness, like a shadow with light. Not confusion later—first pure, made clear by adventitious condition: the nature is primordially pure; confusion is adventitious, added later, removable.

—

[1399-1410]
Tuṣita: the realm of contentment, where Maitreya waits to become the next Buddha. Contentment is not liberation; waiting is not realization. Yet the presence of Maitreya indicates the possibility of awakening even from these heights. Nirmāṇarati: enjoyment of emanations, pleasure in creations, joy in manifestations—still pleasure, still conditioned.

—

[1399-1423]
Limit-Without, Yāma, time—continuous delight ends, time kills all.

—

[1400-1423]
Below thirty-thousand yojanas, Mind-Activity sky: self-arising sound of immeasurable wheels meeting. Upper beings from calm-abiding, fallen below, consciousness to consciousness, beings expand greatly—consciousness without end, form object, wheel enters. Conceive self to consciousness, exceed end knowing, thing not exist. Arisen from these, form expands without end: consciousness without end ayatana.

—

[1401-1423]
Below, tree eye beautiful: joy possess from emanation joy, supreme joy bliss dharma. Body one league, life four hundred human years, own year four thousand. Below, tree mind change: 'Thab-bral from above fallen, asuras and conflict free. Body four-three leagues, life two hundred human years, own year two thousand. Below, tree completely-surrounded decorated ground: limit-without fallen beings expand thirty-three—elephant great steadfast, gold heads thirty-two, turquoise head one, powers thirty-three. Body four portion two leagues, life hundred human years, own year thousand.

—

[1401-1407]
Sun and Moon, fire and water crystals—clarity and reflection. Your own awareness.

—

[1402-1423]
Below two thousand yojanas, Great Cloud sky: samādhi self-appearance arisen, pervaded by colored cloud heaps. Beings expand immeasurably: sky without end ayatana. Four formless: peak of existence eighty thousand great eons, nothing-at-all sixty thousand, consciousness forty thousand, sky without end twenty thousand. Body appearance not contradictory to formless: meditation gods dwell only as consciousness.

—

[1404-1423]
World emptying, essence attaching—cosmogony, birth, manifestation.

—

[1408-1421]
Thirty-Three Heavens, Indra's palace, eight stories—impressive but temporary.

—

[1409-1423]
Four pleasure-groves, four directions—qualities of experience, not places.

—

[1410-1423]
Thirty-Three—temporary glory.

—

[1411-1423]
Symmetry inside-outside—boundary dissolution, recognition of unity.

—

[1417-1423]
Complete Gather tree, Indra's throne—central channel, sovereignty of mind.

—

[1418-1423]
Thus, below to six desire god continents: Limit-Without in space. Beautiful body radiant with light. Always beautiful, completely beautiful appearance gods. Body two leagues, life fifty human years, own year five hundred. Full-Intellect: gods immeasurably increasing enjoyments and resources. From these fallen, from those fallen—five hundred fallen, these four. Below, separate Yāma: from Yāma three, immeasurable gods continuously delight and happiness, joy bliss increase without exception. Body one league, life twenty-five human years, own year two hundred fifty.

—
