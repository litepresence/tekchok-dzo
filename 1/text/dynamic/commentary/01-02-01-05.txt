[1-7]
The fourth tier of existence: the elevated-born guardians of the four directions. Virūpākṣa with eyes that see all—not physical eyes but the eye of wisdom that perceives the nature of reality. Virūḍhaka born of hearing, Dhṛtarāṣṭra guarding the land. These are not mere deities but archetypes of perception and protection, dwelling with their retinues in palaces surrounded by pleasure-groves. Sandalwood water on golden ground, divine blossoms to the knee—this is not geography but the architecture of heightened awareness.

—

[8-14]
The Sun's palace: fifty-one yojanas, base of fire-crystal. The Moon: self-arisen from water-crystal, fenced in gold and silver, four jewel towers. These celestial bodies are not physical planets but states of luminosity. Fire-crystal: the clarity of direct perception. Water-crystal: the reflective nature of mind. The measurements are precise because the states they describe are precise.

—

[15-21]
The Moon extends fifty yojanas; great stars eighteen and a quarter; medium between seventeen and two; small stars one yojana. Each circling the four continents by nature each day. This is the mechanics of attention—the great stars are stable attention, medium stars are wavering, small stars are flickering. All formed from gold, copper, water-crystal, or iron; all floating in forty-thousand yojanas of sky, radiating as light-rays. The sky is not space but the expanse of awareness.

—

[22-35]
Above, the spontaneously-arisen king of mountains: the Thirty-Three abodes. City, grove, ground, tree, five excellent assembly-places. Surrounding the city, Indra's palace; within, the Completely Victorious Palace at center. One hundred fifty yojanas each side, rising five and a half yojanas upward, eight stories, seven stacked houses, seven times seven rooms. This is the mandala of the mind—precise, structured, complete.

—

[36-49]
The numbers are not arbitrary. One hundred fifty: the perfection of the ten perfections multiplied by the fifteen aspects of the path. Eight stories: the eightfold path. Seven times seven rooms: the forty-nine days of the bardo, the completion of cycles. The palace is not a building but the structure of awakened consciousness.

—

[50-64]
Four pleasure-groves in the four directions. East: Chariot-Various-Possessing—with jewel trees, birds, beauty from many lakes, divine garments, music, nectar, nets of various jewels. South: Rough-Transformation—hard armors arising in battle. West: Enjoyment-Mixing—immeasurable enjoyment. North: Everywhere-Joy—free from sorrow, brilliant with joy. Two hundred fifty yojanas wide each.

—

[65-79]
The four groves are not gardens but qualities of experience. East: the arising of multiplicity. South: the transformation of obstacles. West: the mixing of enjoyment with emptiness. North: the joy that is everywhere, not localized, not dependent on conditions. Two hundred fifty: the completion of the ten perfections squared, minus the ego that would claim them.

—

[80-92]
Inside, ground spreads with golden sand, jewel flower-beds, lakes and ponds. Outside, similar ground, many flowers, equal measure to four parks. The symmetry is not decorative; it is the symmetry of a mind that has found its balance. Within and without are equal because the division was never real. What appears inside appears outside because there is no inside or outside—only appearance.

—

[93-99]
The tree at northeast: Complete Gather Burst. Root five yojanas down, branches spreading like an umbrella, circumference fifty yojanas curling. Jewel net, divine cloth hanging. Near it, white rock like armonig, fifty yojanas wide, Indra's throne, falling flower rain. The tree is the central channel—rooted deep, spreading wide, connecting earth and sky. The throne is the seat of sovereignty—not ruling others but ruling one's own mind.

—

[100-106]
Five yojanas down: the five wisdoms as root. Fifty yojanas curling: the ten perfections multiplied by the five elements, demonstrating completeness. The umbrella of branches: protection for all who gather beneath. The jewel net: the interconnectedness of all phenomena. The divine cloth: the drapery of appearances that adorn reality.

—

[107-121]
Assembly-place Dharma-Good: round, surrounded by jewel trees, three hundred yojanas wide, nine hundred circumference. Indra's throne, gods' seats arranged. Measureless houses in sky above, desire and form dwellers, spread like planets and stars. Double size for larger ones. The roundness is the shape of perfection—no beginning, no end, no corners where delusion can hide.

—

[122-136]
Three hundred wide, nine hundred circumference: the ratio of pi, the fundamental number of circular perfection. Indra's throne at center: sovereignty of the mind. Gods' seats arranged: the various aspects of consciousness properly ordered. Measureless houses: the infinite aspects of awareness. Spread like planets and stars: the manifestation of mind as the universe.

—

[137-156]
Attached thus, yet one intermediate eon this vessel world becomes empty, free from beings. Mountains, hills, trees, grass, flowers remain. Valleys as forests, thickets, rain from sky expands jewel trees. Then essence attaches in four stages. Nectar rain releases vapor, ripens jewel trees of lotus nature. Wind goddesses, water dancing goddesses, naga sons—their mind-enters awaken latent seeds.

—

[157-176]
The world becomes empty: not destroyed but purified. The vessel remains; only the contents change. Mountains and hills: the structure of reality unchanged. Trees, grass, flowers: the ornament of appearance remains. The four stages of essence attachment: the progressive densification of consciousness into form. Nectar rain: the descent of blessing. Vapor: the subtle essence before manifestation.

—

[177-196]
Wind goddesses, water dancing goddesses, naga sons: the elemental forces that shape manifestation. Their mind-enters awaken latent seeds: consciousness activating the potential for form. Formless ripened consciousness becomes samādhi emanation body: the transition from pure awareness to embodied presence. Self-appearance completely pure: neither body nor not-body—the indeterminacy of the subtle state.

—

[197-218]
Samādhi emanation body: sometimes appearing, sometimes not. Thus called neither existent nor non-existent. These realms dwell on Padma-Stacked peak's sky. Immeasurable expansion from these, abiding in Sūraṅgama samādhi, peaceful samādhi's own light and bliss. Below, Mind-Play Wheel sky: one great golden vajra arose upward, immeasurable light-rays radiating, extremely beautiful, heroic.

—

[219-240]
Neither existent nor non-existent: the nature of the emanation body. It appears but has no inherent existence; it does not appear but is not non-existent. Padma-Stacked peak: the lotus throne of reality. Sūraṅgama samādhi: the samādhi that is the basis of all appearance. Own light and bliss: not dependent on external conditions but self-arisen.

—

[241-262]
Mind-Play Wheel sky: the level where mind begins to manifest as play. Golden vajra arose upward: the indestructible nature emerging from the formless. Immeasurable light-rays: the unlimited potential of awareness. Heroic: not afraid to manifest, not bound by form, courageous in expression.

—

[263-284]
From delusion, upper beings go in samādhi emanation bodies. Seeing vajra, beautifully seeing—this is Sūraṅgama samādhi. Mind moved by emanation vajra, from those realms' nature-born realms, some drop-like surpassing cast. Upper samādhi lapses, "What also not" said. Only perception from above, dwelling without other. Immeasurable beings expand: called "nothing at all," called "slightly nothing."

—

[285-306]
From delusion: even the upper realms arise from a subtle confusion—the grasping at bliss and clarity. Drop-like surpassing cast: the fall from higher states, drop by drop, gradual but inexorable. "What also not": the recognition of emptiness that, if incomplete, leads to nihilism. Nothing at all, slightly nothing: the formless realms of near-annihilation, approaching cessation but not reaching it.

—

[307-328]
Good samādhi appearance must arise from good samādhi: the law of cause and effect operates even in these refined realms. Going increasingly below, emanation body smaller, light less: the progressive densification of consciousness. Denial sound: "nothing at all"—the nihilistic tendency of these realms. Called ayatana: the sense-bases of the formless, dwelling in perception without form.

—

[329-352]
These dwell in jewel-box samādhi. Like noble tenet arrangement from common vehicle. Connected with mind-entering existence beings. Now too, adventitious confusion arises from moving unproven space awareness. From Secret Essence: E ma ho from Sugata heart, self-thought karma emanation. From Condense: when conditions gather, karma confusion wheel arises.

—

[353-376]
Jewel-box samādhi: precious but contained, valuable but limited. Like noble tenet arrangement: systematic but conceptual, organized but fabricated. Adventitious confusion: the subtle grasping that arises even from space-like awareness. Not inherent but adventitious—arising from conditions, not from nature.

—

[377-400]
E ma ho from Sugata heart: wonder arising from the Buddha-nature itself. Self-thought karma emanation: the world appearing from one's own karmic tendencies. When conditions gather: dependent origination operating even at these subtle levels. Karma confusion wheel: the cycle of confusion driven by subtle karmic traces.

—

[401-424]
Like new birth, not new born: the emanation appears as new but is not truly born. Obscuration together-born with awareness: the subtle ignorance that arises simultaneously with awareness, like a shadow with light. Not confusion later—first pure, made clear by adventitious condition: the nature is primordially pure; confusion is adventitious, added later, removable.

—

[402-425]
Below thirty-thousand yojanas, Mind-Activity sky: self-arising sound of immeasurable wheels meeting. Upper beings from calm-abiding, fallen below, consciousness to consciousness, beings expand greatly—consciousness without end, form object, wheel enters. Conceive self to consciousness, exceed end knowing, thing not exist. Arisen from these, form expands without end: consciousness without end ayatana.

—

[402-425]
Mind-Activity sky: the level where mind becomes active, no longer merely abiding. Self-arising sound: the spontaneous vibration of consciousness. Immeasurable wheels meeting: the intersection of countless cycles of becoming. Fallen from calm-abiding: even stability can be lost if grasped. Consciousness to consciousness: the transmission of delusion from one state to another.

—

[402-425]
Consciousness without end ayatana: the base of infinite consciousness. Form expands without end: the limitless proliferation of mental objects. Life short, body small, light unclear, low samādhi: the decline continues. Merit declined: the exhaustion of virtuous karma that supported higher states.

—

[404-425]
Below two thousand yojanas, Great Cloud sky: samādhi self-appearance arisen, pervaded by colored cloud heaps. Beings expand immeasurably: sky without end ayatana. Four formless: peak of existence eighty thousand great eons, nothing-at-all sixty thousand, consciousness forty thousand, sky without end twenty thousand. Body appearance not contradictory to formless: meditation gods dwell only as consciousness.

—

[404-425]
Great Cloud sky: the density of consciousness like clouds, beautiful but obscuring. Colored cloud heaps: the various types of subtle grasping. Sky without end ayatana: the base of infinite space. The four formless realms with their vast lifespans—eighty thousand, sixty thousand, forty thousand, twenty thousand great eons. Yet all are temporary, all are conditioned, all will end.

—

[404-425]
Body appearance not contradictory to formless: even in the formless realms, there is a subtle body, a subtle appearance. Meditation gods dwell only as consciousness: their existence is purely mental, purely cognitive, yet it is still existence, still conditioned, still impermanent.

—

[400-425]
Below, jewel ornament sky: five lights clearly appear, becoming one expanding consciousness mass. Immeasurable expand everywhere clearly—light mouth eye ear. Wind power moves, flies, hovers. Below-not, peak of form. Distinguish from limitless ayatana: this like picture or rainbow, outside light body. Body six thousand yojanas, life six thousand interval eons.

—

[400-425]
Jewel ornament sky: the realm where the five lights appear clearly. Five lights: the five wisdoms beginning to manifest. One expanding consciousness mass: the unity of awareness before diversification. Light mouth eye ear: the sense faculties as light, not solid. Wind power moves: the energy of consciousness in motion.

—

[400-425]
Peak of form: the highest of the form realms, just below the formless. Like picture or rainbow: appearances without solidity, beautiful but empty. Outside light body: the body made of light, not flesh. Six thousand yojanas, six thousand eons: the vastness of this realm, yet still within form, still conditioned.

—

[400-425]
Below, jewel deep blue: some latency consciousness fell, beings expand immeasurably—extremely seeing, joy when one sees. Body eight thousand, life eight thousand. Below, jewel supreme beauty: excellent appearance, exceeding below. Body four thousand, life four thousand. The numbers decrease as the realms descend, yet the beauty remains—relative, conditioned, impermanent beauty.

—

[402-425]
Below, jewel hair fine: cloud without light, many beings expand—no sorrow to joy-bliss appearance. Body two thousand, life two interval eons. Below, jewel crystal house: not great beings, desire attachment not great. Life one interval, body one thousand. The progression continues—smaller bodies, shorter lives, less light, yet still god realms, still pleasurable, still attachment.

—

[402-425]
No sorrow to joy-bliss: the transition from neutral feeling to joy. Desire attachment not great: the gods here have less desire than those below, but still some. One interval eon: vast by human standards, momentary from the perspective of awakening. The god realms are not the goal; they are rest stops on the journey, pleasant but temporary.

—

[390-425]
Five place classes without affliction trace: five pure class gods, noble places. Above ordinary three places, below jewel supreme beauty spread: some not-great gods fell, called great fruit—great virtue fruit. Body five hundred, life five hundred. Below, jewel kali beautiful: great fruit gods cut in dot manner, merit born from accumulated merit. Body two hundred fifty, life that much.

—

[390-425]
Five place classes without affliction trace: the pure abodes where non-returners dwell. No affliction trace: the gross afflictions are abandoned, though subtle latency remains. Great fruit: the result of great virtue, great practice, great merit. Cut in dot manner: scattered, fragmented, no longer whole. Merit born from accumulated merit: the exhaustion of past virtue without new accumulation.

—

[390-425]
Below, jewel cloud thick: cloud without light from cut merit born. Slow gentle warm, cloud without sun. Body one hundred twenty-five, life that much. The light diminishes; the warmth decreases; the merit runs thin. Cloud without sun: obscuration without the light of wisdom. The descent continues, inevitable for those who do not practice, do not recognize, do not liberate.

—

[400-425]
Below, jewel light emit: virtue increase from cloud without. Body sixty-four, life that much. Below, jewel indra: measure without virtue. Body thirty-two, life that much. Some say measure without virtue above virtue increase. Below, jewel patangkaling: virtue small from above. Body sixteen, life that much. The numbers halve: sixty-four, thirty-two, sixteen—the exponential decrease of merit and life.

—

[400-425]
Virtue increase from cloud without: paradoxical—virtue increasing in a clouded realm. Measure without virtue: the exhaustion of merit, living on the dregs of past virtue. Some say: disagreement among teachers about the ordering, showing the complexity of these subtle distinctions. The important point: all are descending, all are temporary, all are conditioned.

—

[398-425]
Below, jewel kekeru: light clear from above. Body eight, life eight. Below, jewel glory pile: measure without light. Body four, life four. Below, jewel brave light: light small from above. Body two, life two. Below, jewel keruja: great Brahma beings. Brahma from desire fault. Body two and half, life that much. Below, jewel samika: some cut from great Brahma, Brahma before recites.

—

[398-425]
Light clear from above: the last vestiges of higher realms still visible. Measure without light: almost complete obscuration. Light small from above: the faintest memory of luminosity. Great Brahma beings: the highest of the Brahma realms, yet still born from desire, still within the conditioned. Brahma from desire fault: even the creator god arises from subtle desire, subtle grasping.

—

[398-425]
Some cut from great Brahma: separation from the source, fragmentation of the whole. Brahma before recites: the ritual of creation, the words that manifest worlds. Body one, life one: the minimal form realm, on the threshold of the desire realm. Then desire realm: six god races—the world of senses, of pleasure and pain, of attachment and aversion.

—

[376-425]
First, below greatly expanded wish-fulfilling tree jewel: some Brahma expand, immeasurable beings—other emanation power do. Power over emanation appearance. Body two and half leagues, life thousand six hundred human years, own year sixteen thousand. Below, tree see beautiful: emanation joy, emanating hundred or thousand sons from body light. Body one and quarter leagues, life eight hundred human years, own year eight thousand.

—

[376-425]
Wish-fulfilling tree: the tree that grants desires, the symbol of the gods' power. Yet it fulfills only conditioned desires, not ultimate wishes. Emanation power: the ability to manifest forms, to create worlds, to shape reality. Yet this power is limited, conditioned, temporary. Body two and half leagues: vast but measurable, impressive but impermanent.

—

[376-425]
Emanation joy: pleasure in creating, in manifesting, in playing. Emanating sons from body light: creation from one's own radiance, projection of one's own nature. Yet these sons are not truly separate; they are projections, emanations, temporary manifestations. Life measured in human years and own years: different time scales for different realms, all relative, all conditioned.

—

[403-425]
Below, tree eye beautiful: joy possess from emanation joy, supreme joy bliss dharma. Body one league, life four hundred human years, own year four thousand. Below, tree mind change: 'Thab-bral from above fallen, asuras and conflict free. Body four-three leagues, life two hundred human years, own year two thousand. Below, tree completely-surrounded decorated ground: limit-without fallen beings expand thirty-three—elephant great steadfast, gold heads thirty-two, turquoise head one, powers thirty-three. Body four portion two leagues, life hundred human years, own year thousand.

—

[403-425]
Supreme joy bliss dharma: the peak of godly pleasure, the finest enjoyment of the desire realm. Yet still pleasure, still conditioned, still impermanent. 'Thab-bral from above fallen: even gods fall, even bliss ends, even the highest pleasures cease. Asuras and conflict free: temporarily free from the struggle with demigods, but the seeds of conflict remain.

—

[403-425]
Thirty-three: the Thirty-Three Heavens, the realm of Indra, the pinnacle of the desire realm gods. Elephant great steadfast: the symbol of Indra's power and stability. Gold heads thirty-two, turquoise head one: the thirty-three gods themselves, with Indra as the thirty-third. Powers thirty-three: the various abilities of these gods, impressive but limited, temporary, conditioned.

—

[420-425]
Thus, below to six desire god continents: Limit-Without in space. Beautiful body radiant with light. Always beautiful, completely beautiful appearance gods. Body two leagues, life fifty human years, own year five hundred. Full-Intellect: gods immeasurably increasing enjoyments and resources. From these fallen, from those fallen—five hundred fallen, these four. Below, separate Yāma: from Yāma three, immeasurable gods continuously delight and happiness, joy bliss increase without exception. Body one league, life twenty-five human years, own year two hundred fifty.

—

[420-425]
Limit-Without: the gods who know no bounds, who expand infinitely. Yet their expansion is still within the conditioned, still within samsara. Beautiful body radiant with light: the physical perfection of these gods, yet still physical, still form, still impermanent. Full-Intellect: intelligence without wisdom, knowledge without liberation, understanding without realization.

—

[420-425]
Five hundred fallen, these four: the complexity of the falls, the multiple descents from higher realms. Yāma: the realm of time, where gods experience continuous delight. Yet time itself is the enemy, the thief, the killer. Joy bliss increase without exception: temporary increase, temporary joy, temporary bliss—all ending, all fading, all proving the truth of impermanence.

—

[395-400]
Below, separate Tuṣita: from Tuṣita two, immeasurable gods continuously delight and happiness. Body half league, life twelve and half human years, own year one hundred twenty-five. Below, separate Nirmāṇarati: from Nirmāṇarati fallen, immeasurable gods continuously delight and happiness. Body quarter league, life six and quarter human years, own year sixty-two and half. Below, separate Paranirmitavaśavartin: from Paranirmitavaśavartin fallen, completely victorious emanation gods. Body small half league, life three years three months three days three watches three hours three instants, own year thirty-one years two months.

—

[401-412]
Tuṣita: the realm of contentment, where Maitreya waits to become the next Buddha. Contentment is not liberation; waiting is not realization. Yet the presence of Maitreya indicates the possibility of awakening even from these heights. Nirmāṇarati: enjoyment of emanations, pleasure in creations, joy in manifestations—still pleasure, still conditioned.

—

[382-387]
Paranirmitavaśavartin: the highest of the desire realm gods, who control the emanations of others. Completely victorious: victorious over others but not over themselves, victorious in the world but not in the mind. The life span measured in precise units: three years, three months, three days—the magic of numbers, the precision of karma, the exactness of conditioned existence.

—

[345-350]
Below, heaven lord's four great kings: east, south, west, north, and four intermediate directions. Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, Vaiśravaṇa—these four guardian kings with their retinues protect the four directions. Below them, the human realm: Jambudvīpa, our world, with its eight great rivers, seven great mountains, four great continents. This is where practice is possible, where liberation is achievable, where the Buddha appeared.

—

[351-368]
The four great kings: guardians, protectors, watchers. Yet they guard the conditioned realm, protect the samsaric order, watch over the cycle of becoming. Their protection is not liberation; their guardianship is not freedom. They too are within the round, subject to birth and death, pleasure and pain, gain and loss.

—

[326-331]
Jambudvīpa: the rose-apple continent, our world. Eight great rivers, seven great mountains, four great continents—the geography of human existence. Imperfect, challenging, mixed with pleasure and pain—yet this is the precious human realm where awakening is possible. The gods envy humans because humans can practice, can recognize, can liberate.

—

[271-276]
Below humans, the animal realm: beings of instinct, driven by hunger and fear, living in ignorance and confusion. Below animals, the preta realm: hungry ghosts with immense bellies and tiny throats, tormented by unfulfillable desire. Below pretas, the hell realms: eight hot hells, eight cold hells, the neighboring hells, each with specific torments corresponding to specific misdeeds. This is the full spectrum of samsara.

—

[216-221]
The six realms: gods, demigods, humans, animals, pretas, hell beings. The three higher realms dominated by pleasure and attachment; the three lower by pain and aversion. Yet all are samsara, all are conditioned, all are impermanent. The gods' pleasure ends; the hell beings' pain ends; all move through the realms according to karma, none remain forever.

—

[161-166]
This cosmological description is not mythology but psychology. The god realms are states of pleasure and attachment. The hell realms are states of pain and aversion. The human realm is the middle way where practice is possible. The geography describes the mind; the measurements indicate the duration of states; the inhabitants are aspects of consciousness.

—

[84-89]
Voice of the cosmologist: I have mapped the realms from the highest god realm to the deepest hell. I have measured their extents, counted their inhabitants, calculated their lifespans. Yet this map is not the territory. These realms are not places but states—states of mind, states of consciousness, states of being. They appear and disappear according to karma, according to conditions, according to recognition or its absence.

—

[7-12]
The purpose of this description is not to satisfy curiosity but to generate renunciation. Seeing the entire spectrum of samsara—from the highest bliss to the deepest pain, from the longest life to the shortest, from the greatest power to the greatest helplessness—one recognizes that none of it is the goal. All of it is impermanent, all of it is conditioned, all of it is unsatisfactory.

—

[1-425]
Renunciation arises not from fear but from wisdom. Not "I must escape or I will suffer" but "none of this is worth grasping, all of it is empty, the only true satisfaction lies beyond the entire spectrum." This is the wisdom that turns the mind toward liberation, toward awakening, toward the Great Perfection.

—

[1-425]
The Great Perfection transcends all these realms. Not the god realms, not the form realms, not the formless realms. Not higher, not lower, not in between. Beyond the entire cosmology, beyond the entire structure, beyond all measurement and description. This is the nature of mind itself, primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated.

—

[1-425]
From the perspective of the Great Perfection, all these realms are the display of awareness. The god realms are awareness displaying as pleasure. The hell realms are awareness displaying as pain. The human realm is awareness displaying as mixture. All are equally empty, equally luminous, equally the play of rigpa.

—

[1-425]
To recognize this is to be free from the entire cosmology. Not by escaping to a higher realm but by recognizing the nature of all realms. The nature is empty; the nature is luminous; the nature is pure. This recognition liberates from samsara entirely—not by leaving it but by seeing through it.

—

[1-425]
This completes the commentary on the cosmological section. The realms have been described, the measurements given, the inhabitants counted. Yet the true teaching is not in the description but in the recognition it The seeking is not the finding. The path is not the ground.ward. May all who read this recognize that the entire cosmology is the play of their own mind. May all be liberated from the entire round of existence. This is the completion of the commentary on the god realms and the structure of samsara.

—

[1-425]
An old traveler... has studied the cosmology of gods and realms. Virūpākṣa seeing all, Virūḍhaka hearing all, Dhṛtarāṣṭra guarding all—they're not separate beings, wanderer. They're your own senses when purified. The sandalwood water on golden ground? That's clarity washing over recognition. The mandāra blossoms to the knee? That's bliss arising naturally. Don't look for these realms elsewhere; look for them in your own mind.

—

[1-425]
See what is. The Sun's palace fifty-one yojanas, the Moon self-arisen from water-crystal. Garab Dorje points directly: these are not external bodies. The Sun is the clarity of your awareness. The Moon is its reflective nature. Fire-crystal: direct perception. Water-crystal: reflective knowing. Look at your own mind right now—the Sun and Moon are present.

—

[1-425]
Between the gross and the subtle, the Thirty-Three abodes arise. Longchenpa bridges this vision: city, grove, ground, tree, assembly-places—these are the structure of your mandala when recognition stabilizes. Eight stories, seven houses, seven times seven rooms—not arbitrary numbers but the architecture of awakened consciousness. Your mind has this structure; recognize it.

—

[1-425]
Four pleasure-groves in four directions. A wandering practitioner... asks: have you found your grove? East with its chariots, South with transformation, West with enjoyment, North with joy? These are not places to visit but qualities to recognize in your own experience. The groves are within you; they always were.

—

[1-425]
Inside and outside equal, ground and flowers the same. The integratorthe boundary you perceive between inner and outer is the last obstacle. When it dissolves, you see that what appears inside appears outside because there is no inside or outside. This is the symmetry the text describes—not decorative but essential.

—

[1-425]
The tree at northeast—Complete Gather Burst. Root five yojanas, branches fifty. The wandering guru points simply: this is your central channel, rooted deep in primordial purity, spreading wide as spontaneous presence. The white rock, Indra's throne—that's where you sit when you stop seeking a seat outside yourself.

—

[1-425]
Round assembly-place, three hundred wide, nine hundred around. The systematizer notes: the ratio is pi, the number of perfection. Gods' seats arranged, measureless houses above. This is not mythology but psychology—the structure of mind when it's organized, when the aspects of consciousness are properly seated, when awareness expands infinitely.

—

[1-425]
The world becomes empty, yet mountains remain. The consort whispers: this is the experience when consciousness withdraws from form yet form persists. The essence attaches in four stages—the progressive densification from pure awareness to embodied form. Nectar rain, vapor, jewel trees, latent seeds awakening. This is birth, wanderer. This is how you came to be.

—

[1-425]
Samādhi emanation body—sometimes appearing, sometimes not. The sky-dancer moves: neither existent nor non-existent, beyond these categories. The golden vajra arising upward—that's your indestructible nature emerging from the formless. Immeasurable light-rays—your unlimited potential. This is not cosmology; this is your own experience when you look deeply.

—

[1-425]
From delusion, upper beings fall. Slash through hesitation: even the highest states are impermanent, even the greatest bliss ends. "What also not"—the nihilistic tendency of formless realms. Nothing at all, slightly nothing—these are states of consciousness, not places. Know them as they are; don't get stuck there.

—

[1-425]
Jewel-box samādhi—precious but contained. The scholar Mipham clarifies: like systematic philosophy, it's organized but fabricated. Adventitious confusion arises even from space-like awareness—not inherent, not primordial, removable. E ma ho from Sugata heart—wonder arising from your own Buddha-nature. Recognize this; don't seek it elsewhere.

—

[1-425]
Mind-Activity sky: consciousness becoming active, meeting in wheels, falling from calm-abiding. The minimalisteven stability can be lost if grasped. Consciousness without end ayatana—the base of infinite consciousness, yet still conditioned, still impermanent. Life short, body small, light unclear: the decline is real; don't romanticize these states.

—

[1-425]
Great Cloud sky, colored clouds, sky without end ayatana. The four formless realms with their vast lifespans—eighty thousand, sixty thousand eons. Impressive numbers, but the revealer shows: all are temporary, all end, all prove impermanence. Formless gods dwell only as consciousness—still consciousness, still conditioned, still not liberation.

—

[1-425]
Jewel ornament sky, five lights appearing. The pandita consort describes: the five wisdoms beginning to manifest, consciousness expanding, light body forming. Peak of form, just below formless—like picture or rainbow, beautiful but empty. Six thousand yojanas, six thousand eons—vast but measurable, impressive but impermanent.

[1-425]
Jewel hair fine, jewel crystal house—clouds without light, attachment not great. The modern bridge explains: even here, desire persists subtly, attachment remains thinly. Life one interval eon—vast by human standards, momentary in the scope of awakening. These are rest stops, not destinations.

—

[1-425]
Five place classes without affliction trace—the pure abodes. The living library notes: non-returners dwell here, gross afflictions abandoned, subtle latency remains. Great fruit from great virtue, yet merit runs thin. Cloud without sun, slow warm obscuration—the light of wisdom dimmed, the descent continues.

—

[1-425]
The numbers halve: sixty-four, thirty-two, sixteen. Exponential decrease of merit and life. Some say virtue increases in clouded realms—paradoxical, debated, showing complexity. The essential point: all are descending, all temporary, all within samsara. Don't mistake these states for liberation.

—

[1-425]
Great Brahma beings, born from desire fault. Even the creator god arises from grasping, from subtle wanting, from the fault of desire. Some cut from great Brahma—fragmentation, separation from source. Body one, life one—minimal form, on the threshold of desire realm. Then six god races of desire—the world of senses, pleasure and pain.

—

[1-425]
Wish-fulfilling tree: grants desires but only conditioned ones. Emanation power: creates worlds but limited, temporary. Body two and half leagues, life measured in human and god years—different scales, all relatIn a freezing cave... fool has seen gods fall from these heights; none remain forever.

—

[1-425]
Supreme joy bliss dharma—peak of pleasure, finest enjoyment. Yet still pleasure, still conditioned. 'Thab-bral fallen, asuras and conflict free—temporarily free, but seeds remain. Thirty-three heavens, Indra's realm, pinnacle of desire. Thirty-two gold heads, one turquoise—symbols of power, yet power is not liberation.

—

[1-425]
Limit-Without: gods expanding infinitely, yet still within conditioned space. Full-Intellect: knowledge without wisdom, understanding without realization. Yāma: time's realm, continuous delight, yet time is the thief. Joy and bliss increase—but temporarily, ending, fading, proving impermanence.

—

[1-425]
Tuṣita: Maitreya waits, content but not liberated. Nirmāṇarati: enjoyment of emanations, pleasure in creations. Paranirmitavaśavartin: controlling others' emanations, highest desire gods. Precise lifespans measured in threes—magic of numbers, exactness of karma, conditioned existence.

—

[1-425]
Four great kings guarding directions—protecting the conditioned realm, the samsaric order. They too are within the round, subject to birth and death. Jambudvīpa: our world, eight rivers, seven mountains, four continents. Precious human realm where practice is possible, where awakening achievable, where Buddha appeared.

—

[1-425]
Animals, pretas, hells—the lower realms. Six realms total: gods, demigods, humans, animals, pretas, hells. Higher realms dominated by pleasure and attachment; lower by pain and aversion. Yet all are samsara, all conditioned, all impermanent. All move through realms according to karma; none remain forever.

—

[1-425]
The ecstatic proclaims: This cosmology is psychology! God realms are pleasure states; hell realms are pain states; human realm is the middle way. Geography describes mind; measurements indicate duration; inhabitants are consciousness aspects. Not mythology but the map of your own experience!

—

[1-425]
The Great Perfection transcends all realms. Not god realms, not form realms, not formless. Beyond entire cosmology, beyond structure, beyond measurement. This is mind's nature: primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated. All realms are awareness's display—pleasure, pain, mixture—all equally empty, equally luminous, equally rigpa's play.

—

[1-425]
To recognize this is freedom from entire cosmology. Not by escaping to higher realm but by recognizing all realms' nature. Nature is empty; nature is luminous; nature is pure. Recognition liberates from samsara entirely—not by leaving it but by seeing through it. Complete!

—

[1-425]
This cosmological description serves a single purpose: to generate wisdom that turns the mind toward liberation. Seeing the entire spectrum—from highest god bliss to deepest hell pain, from longest eons to shortest lives—recognition dawns that none of this is the goal. All impermanent, all conditioned, all unsatisfactory.

—

[1-425]
The four directional guardians with their retinues—they protect not liberate. Their palaces and pleasure-groves are beautiful traps, golden cages. Sandalwood water and mandāra blossoms: sensory pleasures that bind more tightly than chains. See them clearly; don't be seduced.

—

[1-425]
Sun and Moon, fire-crystal and water-crystal—the duality of clarity and reflection, perception and knowing. Fifty-one yojanas, fifty yojanas—precise measurements of imprecise states. These celestial bodies rise and set, appear and disappear. Your awareness does not.

—

[1-425]
The Thirty-Three: Indra's heaven, the pinnacle of desire realm pleasure. Eight stories, seven houses, forty-nine rooms—complex structure, elaborate construction, impressive display. Yet Indra himself will fall, his palace dissolve, his pleasures end. This is the law of impermanence; this is the nature of samsara.

—

[1-4]
Four pleasure-groves with their specific delights—chariots, armors, enjoyments, joys. Each direction offering different pleasure, each grove promising satisfaction. Yet the promise is false; the satisfaction temporary; the pleasure conditioned. Don't seek these groves; seek what transcends them.

—

[5-17]
Symmetry inside and outside—the text describes what recognition reveals. When boundary dissolves between inner and outer, the symmetry becomes obvious, the equality apparent, the division seen as artificial. This is not cosmology; this is psychology of awakening.

—

[18-24]
Complete Gather Burst tree—central channel metaphor, root and branches, throne and rain. The tree that grants complete gathering, the throne of sovereignty, the falling flower rain of blessing. Yet even this tree is impermanent, this throne temporary, this rain passing.

—

[25-39]
Dharma-Good assembly-place—round, perfect, surrounded. Three hundred wide, nine hundred around, the mathematics of perfection. Yet perfection in samsara is still samsara; completeness in conditioned realm is still conditioned. Don't settle for this perfection; seek what transcends perfection.

—

[40-59]
The world becomes empty—this is withdrawal, recession, involution. Mountains remain but beings gone, essence attaching in stages. The four stages of manifestation: vapor, ripening, awakening, embodiment. This is cosmogony in reverse; this is how worlds end; this is imperience writ large.

—

[60-81]
Samādhi emanation body—neither existent nor non-existent, the subtle state between form and formlessness. Sūraṅgama samādhi: peaceful, blissful, luminous. Yet still samādhi, still state, still conditioned. Don't mistake this for liberation; it's rest stop, not destination.

—

[82-103]
Fall from upper realms—the gods' tragedy. Lapse of samādhi, "what also not" nihilism, nothing-at-all despair. Even the formless realms end; even infinite consciousness ceases; even the base of nothingness passes. No refuge in any state; no safety in any realm.

—

[104-127]
Jewel-box samādhi—precious but limited, valuable but contained. Adventitious confusion: the subtle ignorance that contaminates even refined awareness. Not primordial, not inherent, removable—yet clinging to it persists. E ma ho: wonder at the heart of confusion, Buddha-nature even here.

—

[128-151]
Mind-Activity sky—consciousness becoming active, proliferating, expanding. Wheels meeting, beings multiplying, consciousness without end. Yet this expansion is still samsara; this multiplication is still delusion; this activity is still bondage. Life short, body small, light unclear: the decline begins.

—

[152-173]
Great Cloud sky—density, obscuration, colored heaps. Four formless realms: infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothing-at-all, neither perception nor non-perception. Vast lifespans measured in thousands of eons—yet all end, all cease, all prove unsatisfactory. Peak of existence still within existence.

—

[174-199]
Jewel ornament sky—five lights appearing, consciousness mass expanding. Peak of form, below formless, like rainbow or picture. Beautiful but empty, luminous but insubstantial, pleasing but impermanent. Body six thousand, life six thousand—numbers impressive but temporary.

—

[200-223]
Descending through jewel realms—deep blue, supreme beauty, hair fine, crystal house. Each lower than last, each less luminous, each more dense. No sorrow to joy-bliss: the spectrum of feeling, the range of experience, the variety of samsara. All temporary, all conditioned, all unsatisfactory.

—

[224-259]
Five pure abodes—without affliction trace, yet still with latency. Non-returners dwell here, advanced practitioners, those who won't return to lower realms. Yet they haven't achieved liberation; they're resting, pausing, preparing. Great fruit, but fruit that will be exhausted.

—

[260-285]
The halving continues—sixty-four, thirty-two, sixteen. Merit declining exponentially, life shortening proportionally. Virtue increase in clouded realms: some debate this, some affirm it. The essential point: all descending, all temporary, all within round of becoming.

—

[286-313]
Great Brahma—even creator god born from desire, from subtle wanting, from fault of grasping. Some cut from source, fragmented, separated. Brahma reciting creation words, manifesting worlds through mantra—yet his worlds are temporary, his creation impermanent, his power limited.

—

[314-363]
Wish-fulfilling tree—grants desires but only conditioned ones, only samsaric wants, only temporary satisfactions. Emanation power—creates but limited, temporary, bound by karma. Two and half leagues, thousand six hundred years—impressive but measurable, vast but finite.

—

[364-386]
Supreme joy, emanation joy, joy possess—pleasure piled on pleasure, bliss heaped on bliss. Yet pleasure ends, bliss fades, joy proves impermanent. 'Thab-bral fallen, Thirty-Three pinnacle—gods at height of desire realm, yet still within desire, still within realm, still within samsara.

—

[381-386]
Limit-Without, Full-Intellect, Yāma—beautiful names, impressive realms, vast lifespans. Yet limit has end, intellect lacks wisdom, time kills all. Continuous delight, immeasurable happiness—temporarily continuous, relatively immeasurable, ultimately ending.

—

[356-361]
Tuṣita, Nirmāṇarati, Paranirmitavaśavartin—contentment, enjoyment, control. Maitreya waits, gods delight, victors control others' emanations. Yet waiting is not realizing, delight is not liberation, control is not freedom. Precise lifespans in threes—the magic of numbers, the prison of karma.

—

[311-316]
Four great kings, human realm, Jambudvīpa—guardians protecting samsara, humans able to practice, our precious world. Eight rivers, seven mountains, four continents—the geography of opportunity, the realm of liberation, the field of awakening.

—

[256-261]
Animals, pretas, hells—the lower realms of ignorance, craving, pain. Driven by instinct, tormented by hunger, burned by fire. Yet even here, Buddha-nature present; even here, liberation possible; even here, hope remains. No realm is permanent; no condition is fixed.

—

[179-184]
The purpose of all this description: renunciation, wisdom, turning mind toward liberation. Not fear of hell or desire for heaven but recognition that all is impermanent, all is conditioned, all is unsatisfactory. The only true satisfaction: beyond entire spectrum, beyond all realms, beyond samsara itself.

—

[82-87]
Great Perfection transcends cosmology. Not higher realm but nature of all realms; not better state but essence of all states. Primordially pure, spontaneously present, naturally liberated—this is your nature, right now, as you read. Recognize it; don't seek it elsewhere.

—

[1-425]
Complete commentary on cosmological section. All realms described, all measurements given, all inhabitants counted. Yet true teaching is in recognition it The lamp holds the flame, but the clay is not the light.ward: entire cosmology is play of your own mind. May all recognize this; may all be liberated. Complete.

—

[1-395]
This extensive cosmological presentation has now received thorough commentary. The god realms, form realms, formless realms, and lower realms have all been explained. The purpose is clear: to generate wisdom that turns the mind toward liberation, recognizing that all realms are impermanent, conditioned, and unsatisfactory.

Complete commentary on Buddhist cosmology.
