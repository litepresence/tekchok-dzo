The teaching now turns to the heart of practice—the times and signs of empowerment. This is not arbitrary scheduling. The nature itself provides the openings. The student must recognize them.

A voice speaks: When you receive empowerment, you are not given something new. You are shown what you already possess. The empowerment is recognition—not transformation. The seed was always present. The rain makes it visible.

The tradition explains: The Tibetan distinguishes elaboration. The first teaching is about empowerment WITH elaboration. This means the elaborate ritual—the full tantric ceremony with its mandalas, its offerings, its precise timings. This is the path for those who need form to enter the formless.

Why elaborate? Some minds need the scaffold. The rituals, the visualizations, the exact procedures—these are training wheels. They create the container. Then the student can rest inside.

The first division covers the timing. The best years are the dragon, snake, horse.
pig years—especially the fourth year of the cycle. The best months are the first four months of the year. The results manifest when the fruit ripens. The best dates are during the waxing moon, from the first to the full. The best times are midday and midnight—these are the pivot points, the doorways between states.

A voice continues: But timing alone is not enough. The student must have the qualities. The student must hold samaya—these are the commitments that protect the empowerment. The student's element-body must accord with the practice. This is not rigid—the numbers can vary from fifty to a hundred, depending on capacity. The key is accordance, not rigid formula.

If the student enters the ritual without proper preparation, problems arise. If the lamp has no oil—the student has no faith—then the samaya cannot be repaired. Without purity, no Siddhi arises. If the student dies meaninglessly, obstacles arise. But if the empowerment is complete and the mantra is strong, then success comes.

The tradition points: When the friends gather, observe. If the student's body experiences illness, this is a sign—the channels are clearing. Then practice circumambulation and prostration. If the student's speech becomes chaotic—this is the speech of the deity arising. Recite the hundred letters. If the mind becomes hungry or mindfulness lapses—this is the dissolution of ordinary mind into wisdom. Enter the stages of generation and completion.

A sharp voice cuts: The signs are not good or bad—they are indicators. If pure signs arise, continue the original empowerment ritual with effort. If the substances of accomplishment increase, supreme Siddhi will be obtained. The equal meaning—surrender to the teacher—is faith. When you enter empowerment with such faith, you always see good signs. Common Siddhis are accomplished through this. Even if you have some experience and knowledge, use them for the happiness of the dharma.

A bridging voice adds: The guru is supreme. Faith arises in the fortunate. Through this, you apply the supreme mudra—you see your own body, speech.
mind as bliss. This is the pure Buddha field. This is the first teaching—the times and signs of elaborate empowerment.

Now the teaching turns to empowerment WITHOUT elaboration.

A voice speaks: The second teaching is simpler. Now we describe the times and signs of non-elaborate empowerment. There is no year distinction—any year will do. Any who have knowledge can receive it. The timing is simpler: summer and winter are both good. The dates are during the waxing moon, specifically the full fortnight. The empowerment time is dawn, when the sound becomes clear.

The tradition explains: The student must have faith—at least five, six, or seven qualities. More than seven is unnecessary. The student must have faith, virtue in action, praise of the guru in speech. If the body does not experience bliss, then confess past sins. For speech and mind, confess and begin fresh. This is empowerment without elaboration—its times and signs.

Now the teaching turns to the third—extreme non-elaborate empowerment, the supreme secret.

A voice states: The third teaching is about supreme secret empowerment—the times and signs. There is no year distinction. It accomplishes through self-nature. This is the highest path: the outer time is when to plant the seed of awakening. The inner time is when the seed ripens. The secret time is the time of empowerment itself.

When you give empowerment at the outer time, you plant the seed. When the seed sprouts and grows, the fruit accumulates. This is empowerment without elaboration—the wisdom fruit completes. The three bodies are definitely attained. The inner time is when the moon waxes—the student's experience stabilizes. Avoid the waning moon. Increase experience and blessings. The secret time is when the sun reaches its peak—the self-arising wisdom dawns. Or at the waning end—the conceptual mind exhausts itself.

A voice continues: The suitable student is one, two, or three—more is unnecessary. Each student has their own direction and time. The body time is like space—the clouds, mist, rain, wind, sounds arise and pass. If these cause harm, enemies, thieves, or unpleasant forms arise, these are signs of the student's past negative karma. After empowerment, if the guru does not show instruction, problems arise.

The tradition adds: If bliss disappears or images arise, the student should circumambulate the guru's chamber a hundred thousand times—or at least six thousand. Prostrate a hundred thousand times—or at least one thousand. At that time, distinguish the signs. If the beginning is pure, the end will be pure. If the body is complete, don't cut the practice—continue. When the activity finishes, begin again. If you don't purify the sins, then meditate on the deity's thousand bodies. Then learn the sequence from the guru.

The teaching now covers speech practice.

A voice explains: The student should also practice speech. The yogi should know: if beginning, middle.
end arise without interval, then recite the hundred, thousand, or hundred thousand letters with effort. If the end arises, you have succeeded. Read the tantras of secret mantra. Recite the mantras. Keep the commitments to the deity. Recite various praises. Recite the ali kali sounds. Recite the individual kyaṃ. Recite hūṃ, phaṭ, oṃ. Combine and recite various mantras for seven months with effort.

The tradition states: Then receive instruction in the place of practice. Absorb the commitment deity. Meditate for three days. If signs arise in the middle, rays of mantra light radiate and gather. Continue effort for seven days. If the end arises—the letters radiate and gather—meditate. Make effort for ten days. If beginning, middle.
end all arise, you have accomplished the practice.

Now we teach the signs of accomplishment.

A voice says: There are outer, inner.
secret signs. The outer signs: the body becomes like the sun and moon—radiant. The inner signs: the channels become clear like nets—the bindus flow freely. The secret signs: the mind attains the nature of great bliss—unchanging.

The body signs include: the body becomes youthful, healthy, beautiful. The channels are clear. The breath is peaceful. The voice becomes like thunder or a kalavinka bird. These are outer signs.

The inner signs: you see all phenomena as the deity's display. You hear the sound of the dharma. You experience the taste of wisdom. You smell the scent of purity. These are the inner signs.

The secret signs: the mind rests in its own nature—empty, luminous, knowing. No conceptual thought arises. The three bodies are recognized as your own display. This is the supreme sign.

Now we teach what happens if signs do not arise.

A sharp voice cuts: If outer signs do not arise, it means the channels are blocked. If inner signs do not arise, it means the mind is not trained. If secret signs do not arise, it means the recognition is not stable.

The remedy: For blocked channels, practice the preliminary exercises—prostrations, mandala offerings, guru yoga. For untrained mind, practice single-pointed meditation on the deity. For unstable recognition, practice the generation and completion stages together.

A bridging voice adds: But even if signs do not arise, do not despair. The nature is always present even when not recognized. The empowerment planted the seed. Given time, it will grow. The farmer does not dig up the seed to check if it's growing.

Now we teach the relationship between empowerment and practice.

A voice speaks: The empowerment is the seed. The practice is the water, sun.
soil. The fruit is enlightenment. Without empowerment, practice has no basis. Without practice, empowerment cannot ripen. Both are necessary.

The tradition explains: Some think empowerment is enough—they have received the blessing, so no practice is needed. This is wrong. The seed must be cultivated. Others think practice is enough—they will generate enlightenment through their own effort. This is also wrong. Without empowerment, the path is unclear.

The middle way: Receive empowerment, then practice. Let the seed ripen through practice. This is the tantric path.

Now we teach the different types of students.

A voice describes: The first type of student is sharp—quick to understand, quick to practice, quick to accomplish. They receive empowerment and immediately recognize the nature. Their practice is brief but deep.

The second type is medium—understanding comes with explanation, practice comes with encouragement, accomplishment comes with time. They need the full ritual, the detailed instructions, the gradual path.

The third type is dull—slow to understand, slow to practice, slow to accomplish. They need the elaborate path, the many visualizations, the extensive merits. But even they will eventually succeed if they persist.

This is not judgment—it's practical guidance. Match the path to the student. The guru's job is to see the student's capacity and give appropriate teaching.

Now we teach the signs of a qualified student.

A voice states: The qualified student has faith—unshakable faith in the guru, the teachings.
the path. The qualified student has devotion—not emotional attachment, but genuine longing for liberation. The qualified student has intelligence—not intellectual knowledge, but the ability to see the nature. The qualified student has perseverance—not forcing practice, but continuing through difficulties.

The tradition adds: The qualified student has humility—not thinking oneself already accomplished. The qualified student has discrimination—not confusing ordinary mind with wisdom. The qualified student has courage—not afraid to face the nature. The qualified student has equanimity—not grasping at pleasant experiences, not rejecting unpleasant experiences.

These qualities can be developed. Even if you don't have them initially, practice develops them.

Now we teach the signs of an unqualified student.

A sharp voice warns: The unqualified student has no faith—everything is doubted, everything is questioned. The unqualified student has no devotion—practice is mechanical, distant, hollow. The unqualified student has no intelligence—everything is taken literally, nothing is understood implicitly. The unqualified student has no perseverance—practice is sporadic, inconsistent, abandoned at the first obstacle.

The tradition continues: The unqualified student is proud—thinking oneself already accomplished. The unqualified student is confused—taking appearances as reality, taking concepts for wisdom. The unqualified student is afraid—of the nature, of emptiness, of dissolution. The unqualified student is attached—to experiences, to achievements, to recognition.

Such students should first develop the preliminary practices. They should accumulate merit and purify obscurations. Then return to the empowerment teachings.

Now we teach the conclusion of the empowerment teachings.

A voice concludes: The empowerments are the doorways. Through them, you enter the path. The times and signs are the keys—not literal schedules, but natural openings. Recognize them. The student who receives empowerment enters the stream. The student who practices accomplishes. The student who recognizes becomes the Buddha.

The treasury is the nature. The empowerment is the pointing. The practice is the walking. The result is the arriving. But the walking is optional—the arriving is already accomplished. The path is for those who forget.

The tradition cuts: Three words strike the vital point: Recognize. Rest. Return. The pointing is the empowerment. The seeing is the result. They are not separate.

Emaho! The times and signs have been explained—the outer, inner.
secret. The student who understands them walks the path with open eyes. The student who doesn't walks in darkness. May all beings receive empowerment and recognize the nature.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we add final reflections on the empowerment—the synthesis of all we have taught.

A voice speaks: The empowerment is the door to the treasury. Through it, we enter the path of Dzogchen. It is not the end—it is the beginning. But it is an essential beginning without which the path cannot be entered.

The tradition explains: Without empowerment, we practice other methods—helpful, valuable, but not Dzogchen. With empowerment, we practice Dzogchen—the direct path. This is the key difference. This is why finding a qualified guru and receiving proper empowerment is essential.

A bridging voice adds: The empowerment is also the confirmation of our potential. The guru sees Buddha-nature in the student and points to it. The student recognizes what was always there. This is the transmission—mind to mind, heart to heart.

Now we conclude this comprehensive teaching.

A voice concludes: The times and signs of empowerment have been explained in detail—the elaborate, the non-elaborate.
the supreme. The student who understands these teachings is ready for the path.

The treasury of the Supreme Vehicle—the Great Perfection—has been opened. The path is clear. The result is certain. Recognition is possible now, in this very moment.

The tradition ends: Look directly: The liberation is now. This is Dzogchen. This is the Great Perfection. This is what you are.

Emaho! May all beings recognize the nature. May all beings rest in rigpa. May all beings be liberated. May the treasury of the Supreme Vehicle shine forever.

Sarva Mangalam.
A voice speaks: How do you know when empowerment is complete? There are definite signs. The outer signs: the student's body is transformed—radiant, healthy, youthful. The channels are clear. The breath is peaceful. The voice is melodious. These are outer completion signs.

The inner signs: the student's mind is transformed—clear, peaceful, wise. The three poisons diminish. The six paramitas arise naturally. The bodhicitta is stable. These are inner completion signs.

The secret signs: the student recognizes the nature directly—no more doubt. The student rests in rigpa—no more grasping. The student manifests the three bodies—naturally, without effort. This is secret completion.

These signs may not come all at once. They develop over time. First outer signs, then inner, then secret. But they will come if practice continues.

Now we teach the problems that can arise after empowerment.

A sharp voice warns: After empowerment, problems can arise if samaya is broken. The samaya is the commitment—to the guru, to the teachings, to the practice. If broken, obstacles arise. The outer obstacles: illness, poverty, danger. The inner obstacles: madness, confusion, regression. The secret obstacles: taking appearance as reality, taking concepts as wisdom.

The remedy: If samaya is broken, confess. The confessional practice is essential. Prostrate, offer mandalas, recite the hundred syllables. Purify the breakage. Then restore samaya and continue practice.

A bridging voice adds: But samaya is not external rules. It's the natural expression of recognition. If you recognize the nature constantly, samaya is kept automatically. The rules are only for those who forget.

Now we teach the different empowerment lineages.

A voice explains: There are many lineages—Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, Gelug. Each has its own emphasis, its own methods. But the nature is the same. The empowerment is the pointing. The lineage is the chain of pointing—from guru to student, continuing unbroken.

The tradition states: The Nyingma lineage emphasizes the great perfection—direct recognition. The Kagyu lineage emphasizes the mahamudra—single-pointed meditation. The Sakya lineage emphasizes the Hevajra—visualization practice. The Gelug lineage emphasizes the Guhyasamaja—analysis and logic.

But these are fingers pointing at the same moon. Don't cling to the finger. See the moon. The lineage is the chain of seeing. As long as the seeing continues, the lineage is alive.

Now we teach the relationship between empowerment and the three bodies.

A voice speaks: The empowerment plants the seeds of the three bodies. The body empowerment seeds the nirmanakaya—manifestation body. The speech empowerment seeds the sambhogakaya—enjoyment body. The mind empowerment seeds the dharmakaya—truth body. The secret empowerment seeds all three simultaneously.

When you receive body empowerment, you plant the seed of manifesting for others. When you receive speech empowerment, you plant the seed of experiencing bliss for others. When you receive mind empowerment, you plant the seed of wisdom for all. When you receive secret empowerment, all three seeds are planted at once.

The practice ripens these seeds. The result is the full attainment of the three bodies—the Buddha's complete enlightenment.

Now we teach the conclusion of this section.

A voice concludes: The times and signs of empowerment have been explained—the elaborate, the non-elaborate.
the supreme non-elaborate. The student must understand: these are guidelines, not rigid rules. The nature provides the openings. Recognition is the key.

The treasury is open. The teachings are given. The path is clear. What remains is practice. But even practice is optional—for those who recognize, the result is already present.

The tradition cuts: Consider this: The guru points. You see. That's the entire transmission.

Emaho! May all beings receive empowerment, keep samaya, practice faithfully.
recognize the nature. May the lineage of pointing continue unbroken. May all beings attain enlightenment.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we turn to the specific practices that follow empowerment—the preliminary and actual practices that ripen the seed.

A voice speaks: After receiving empowerment, the student must practice. Without practice, the empowerment remains a seed that never sprouts. The preliminary practices prepare the ground. The actual practices water the seed. Both are essential.

The tradition explains: The preliminary practices are four: prostrations to accumulate merit, mandala offerings to accumulate wisdom, guru yoga to receive blessing.
the hundred syllables to purify. These create the conditions for practice. They are not the goal—they are the foundation.

A bridging voice adds: The actual practice depends on the empowerment received. After body empowerment, practice generation stage—visualize the deity, the mandala, the offerings. After speech empowerment, practice mantra—recite the syllables, visualize the light, receive the wisdom. After mind empowerment, practice completion—rest in the nature of mind, recognize the rigpa. After secret empowerment, practice the unity—generation and completion together.

Now we teach the practice timeline and obstacles.

A voice describes: The practice should be systematic. First, complete the preliminary practices—minimum one hundred thousand of each. Then begin the actual practice. The generation stage should be practiced until stable—until the visualization arises effortlessly. Then move to completion stage—until rest in rigpa is natural. Then practice the unity—until generation and completion are simultaneous.

The timeline varies by student. The sharp student may complete in months. The medium student may take years. The dull student may take decades. But all will complete if they continue. The path is certain—only the time is uncertain.

A sharp voice cuts: Don't compare yourself to others. Your path is your path. The bamboo grows at its own pace. Some grow quickly but are hollow. Some grow slowly but are strong. Quality matters more than speed.

Now we teach the obstacles to practice.

A voice warns: Obstacles will arise. They are part of the path. The outer obstacles: illness, poverty, duties, distractions. The inner obstacles: doubt, discouragement, dullness, agitation. The secret obstacles: taking experiences as achievements, grasping at emptiness, confusing mind with wisdom.

The tradition explains: When obstacles arise, don't give up. Don't fight them either. See them as part of practice. The obstacle IS the path when recognized correctly. The wave is water. The shadow is light. The obstacle is wisdom when you see its nature.

The remedy: For outer obstacles, use the preliminary practices—merit accumulates, obstacles diminish. For inner obstacles, use the actual practice—rest in rigpa, the obstacles dissolve. For secret obstacles, use the pointing—recognize the obstacle as display, it becomes wisdom.

Now we teach the signs of progress and daily practice.

A voice says: Progress can be tracked. The outer signs: your practice becomes stable. You find time when none existed. You have energy when you should be tired. You have clarity when you should be confused. These are outer signs.

The inner signs: your mind changes. Attachment diminishes. Aggression diminishes. Confusion diminishes. Patience grows. Wisdom grows. Compassion grows. These are inner signs.

The secret signs: you recognize the nature. Doubt ends. Rest becomes natural. The three bodies are seen as your own display. These are secret signs.

These signs may come gradually. Don't seek them. They come naturally when practice is genuine. The student who seeks signs is like the student who digs up the seed to see if it's growing.

Now we turn to the practical applications—how empowerment manifests in daily life.

A voice speaks: The teachings are not just for meditation hall. They are for daily life. Every moment is practice. Every situation is opportunity. Recognition doesn't stop when you open your eyes.

The tradition explains: In daily life, the practice is to maintain awareness. When you see form, see it as display. When you hear sound, hear it as echo. When you think thought, recognize it as arising. This is not separate from meditation—it's the same meditation, continued.

Now we teach how to handle relationships and work.

A voice explains: Relationships are part of the path. Family, friends, enemies—all are teachers. The person who angers you is teaching you about your anger. The person who pleases you is teaching you about your attachment. See everyone as teacher. See every relationship as practice.

The tradition states: The key is non-grasping. Don't cling to those you love. Don't reject those you hate. Don't ignore those you ignore. All are appearances—display of the nature. Rest in the nature.
relationships become practice.

Work is also practice. Whatever you do—job, housework, study—do it with awareness. Don't check out. Don't go on automatic. Be present. This is meditation in action.

The tradition adds: The motivation matters. If you work only for yourself, the merit is limited. If you work for others, even ordinary work becomes sacred. Dedicate your work to the welfare of all beings. This transforms mundane into spiritual.

Now we teach how to handle illness, death.
success.

A voice speaks: Illness and death are part of life. They will come. How to face them? With recognition. The body changes—this is nature. Mind remains—this is awareness. Recognize this.
illness becomes practice, death becomes liberation.

The tradition explains: The bardo teachings—the intermediate state after death—are based on recognition. If you recognize the nature at the moment of death, you attain liberation. If not, you enter the bardo with confusion. The practice now determines the result then.

A sharp voice cuts: Don't wait for death to practice. Practice now. The moment of death is not special—it's like other moments. If you can't recognize now, you won't recognize then. Recognition must be stable before death. Practice while you have time.

Now we teach about success.

A sharp voice warns: Adversity is not the only test—success is another. Praise, wealth, status, power—these can corrupt. The practitioner must be careful. What strengthens the ego defeats the practice.

The tradition explains: Use success for the path. If you gain fame, use it to spread the teachings. If you gain wealth, use it to support the Dharma. If you gain power, use it to help beings. Don't keep it for yourself—this is the nature of generosity.

Now we teach the highest teaching—the union of Dzogchen and Mahamudra.

A voice speaks: Dzogchen and Mahamudra point to the same nature. Dzogchen emphasizes the view—recognizing the ground. Mahamudra emphasizes the meditation—resting in the recognition. In the highest teaching, these are not two—they are one.

The tradition explains: The view of Dzogchen is the direct recognition of rigpa—the awareness that knows itself. The meditation of Mahamudra is the single-pointed rest in that recognition. But when recognition is stable, view and meditation are one. There is no view separate from meditation, no meditation separate from view.

A bridging voice adds: This union is the heart of the secret mantra path. Not the outer union of generation stage and completion stage—but the inner union of awareness and emptiness, clarity and void, appearance and reality.

Now we teach how to recognize and maintain the union.

A voice describes: The union is recognized when: appearances do not distract from awareness.
awareness does not reject appearances. When these two happen simultaneously, you are in the union.

The tradition states: In the union, there is no meditator and nothing meditated. There is no practice and nothing practiced. There is no path and no goal. There is only the nature—appearing, knowing, free.

A sharp voice cuts: This is not a special state. It's not a trance. It's not an experience. It's what you are right now, before any seeking. The seeking creates the illusion of separation. Stop seeking, and it's here.

Now we teach the final view and conclusion.

A voice concludes: The ultimate view is no-view. Not blankness—not confusion. It's awareness without object, recognition without reference, presence without subject. This is rigpa. This is Mahamudra. This is Dzogchen. This is what you are.

The treasury is the nature. The empowerment is the pointing. The practice is the walking. The result is the arriving. But the walking is optional—the arriving is already accomplished. The path is for those who forget.

The tradition cuts: A single point: The pointing is the empowerment. The seeing is the result. They are not separate.

Emaho! May all beings receive empowerment, keep samaya, practice faithfully, recognize the nature.
attain enlightenment. May the lineage continue unbroken. May the treasury of the Supreme Vehicle shine forever.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we teach the broader context—the relationship between empowerment and the entire path of Dzogchen.

A voice speaks: The empowerment is not an isolated event. It is part of a continuum—from first contact with the teachings to final enlightenment. The continuum has stages. Each stage has its purpose. Understanding the stages helps the student navigate the path.

The tradition explains: The first stage is hearing—encountering the teachings, meeting the guru, receiving the empowerment. This plants the seed. The second stage is contemplating—studying the teachings, understanding the meaning, examining the nature. This waters the seed. The third stage is meditating—practicing the methods, resting in the nature, stabilizing recognition. This ripens the seed. The fourth stage is accomplishing—manifesting the results, serving others, completing the path. This is the fruit.

A bridging voice adds: These stages may seem sequential, but they overlap. As you hear, you begin to contemplate. As you contemplate, you begin to meditate. As you meditate, you begin to accomplish. The stages are one process—the process of recognition.

Now we teach the signs of each stage.

A voice describes: The sign of hearing is faith—trust in the teachings, trust in the guru, trust in the path. If faith arises, hearing has done its work.

The sign of contemplating is understanding—comprehension of the meaning, ability to explain to others, clarity about the path. If understanding arises, contemplating has done its work.

The sign of meditating is stability—rest in rigpa becomes natural, distractions diminish, recognition persists. If stability arises, meditating has done its work.

The sign of accomplishing is service—spontaneous helping of others, natural manifestation of wisdom, completion of the path. If service arises, accomplishing has done its work.

Now we teach the problems at each stage.

A sharp voice warns: At the hearing stage, the problem is doubt—questioning the teachings, questioning the guru, questioning the path. The remedy is faith—accepting temporarily, giving the benefit of the doubt, allowing the process to work.

At the contemplating stage, the problem is conceptualization—taking words for meaning, taking explanation for realization. The remedy is meditation—moving from intellectual understanding to direct recognition.

At the meditating stage, the problem is grasping—holding onto experiences, seeking special states, attachment to progress. The remedy is release—letting go, allowing natural rest, not trying to control.

At the accomplishing stage, the problem is pride—thinking oneself accomplished, looking down on others, forgetting the path. The remedy is humility—remembering the nature, seeing others as manifestations, continuing practice.

Now we teach how to progress through the stages.

A voice explains: Progress happens through practice. Practice means daily application—not sporadic intense sessions, but consistent effort. One hour each day is better than ten hours once a week. The mind needs regular training.

The tradition adds: Progress also happens through devotion. Devotion means turning toward the path—not just formally, but in daily life. When difficulties arise, turn to the teachings. When confusion arises, turn to the guru. When despair arises, turn to the practice.

A bridging voice says: Progress also happens through community. The sangha—those on the path—support each other. Practice with others when possible. Even when alone, know you are part of a lineage, a tradition, a community of practitioners.

Now we teach the final result and daily life applications.

A voice concludes: When all stages complete, the result is enlightenment—not becoming something new, but recognizing what was always present. The Buddha is not created—Buddha-hood is revealed. The enlightened one is not someone special—enlightened ones see that everyone is already enlightened.

The tradition states: The three bodies are not achievements—they are natural expressions. Nirmanakaya manifests for beings. Sambhogakaya experiences bliss. Dharmakaya rests in truth. These are not separate—they are one nature, appearing in different ways.

A sharp voice cuts: The enlightened one doesn't walk on water or fly in the sky—though these may happen. The enlightened one sees the nature—in everything, everyone, every moment. This is the only enlightenment. This is the only result. This is what the empowerment points to.

Now we teach how to use the result.

A voice speaks: Enlightenment is not for the enlightened one alone. It is for all beings. The enlightened one returns to the world—not escaping it, but serving it. Every action becomes teaching. Every word becomes wisdom. Every moment becomes practice.

The tradition explains: The bodhisattva vow—to liberate all beings—is not a burden. It is natural expression. When you recognize the nature, compassion arises spontaneously. When you see others suffering, you help. This is not sacrifice—it is the nature expressing itself.

A bridging voice adds: Even ordinary activities become enlightenment practice when done with recognition. Eating, sleeping, walking, speaking—all can be practice. Not by changing what you do, but by how you do it—with awareness, with presence, with recognition.

Now we teach the conclusion of the empowerment section.

A voice concludes: The times and signs have been explained—the elaborate and non-elaborate. The practices have been described—the preliminary and actual. The stages have been outlined—hearing, contemplating, meditating, accomplishing. The result has been revealed—enlightenment, service, natural expression.

The treasury is open. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is practice. But even practice is optional—for those who recognize, the result is already here.

The tradition cuts: No words. The result is recognizing what was never lost. Stop looking. Start seeing. This is the entire teaching.

Emaho! May all beings receive empowerment, practice faithfully, recognize the nature, serve all beings.
attain enlightenment. May the treasury of the Supreme Vehicle continue to reveal its depths. May the lineage of the great perfection remain unbroken.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we turn to the ultimate teaching—what remains when all teachings are exhausted.

A voice speaks: After all explanations, all practices, all stages—what remains? Only the nature. Not as an object—not as a concept—not as an experience. Just what is. Here. Now. This.

The tradition explains: The teachings are like rafts. You use them to cross the river. Once across, you leave them. Don't carry the raft on your back. The nature is the far shore. The path is crossing. But the far shore is where you started.

A bridging voice adds: This is not nihilism—not nothing. It's not something either. It's beyond both. The nature cannot be described because description requires subject and object. The nature has no subject and no object. It just is.

Now we teach the final secret.

A sharp voice whispers: The secret is—there was never anything to find. The seeking was the forgetting. The finding is the stopping of seeking. You are already what you seek. But you must seek to find this out. The path is for the forgetting, not for the finding.

The tradition concludes: The treasury is not something hidden. It's not in the texts, not in the mountains, not in the mind. It's everywhere. It's everything. It's you. Recognize this and the search ends. The search ending is the finding. The finding is the recognizing. The recognizing is the being. This is Dzogchen.

Emaho! The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. May all beings recognize the nature in this very moment. May all beings rest in rigpa forever. May the treasury of the Supreme Vehicle remain open for all.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we teach deeper aspects of the empowerment—the inner dimensions that go beyond the outer rituals.

A voice speaks: Beyond the elaborate ceremonies and the precise timings, there is the inner empowerment. This is the real transmission—the direct pointing to the nature. The outer ritual is just preparation. The inner pointing is the actual empowerment.

The tradition explains: The outer empowerment uses forms—mandalas, deities, mantras. These are skillful means to prepare the mind. The inner empowerment goes beyond forms. It points directly to awareness—the rigpa that knows itself. This pointing is transmitted from mind to mind, from heart to heart.

A bridging voice adds: This is why the guru is essential. Not just anyone can give the inner empowerment. Only one who has recognized the nature can point to it. The student must find such a guru. This is the first and most important step.

Now we teach the signs of genuine transmission.

A voice describes: When genuine transmission occurs, something shifts. The student doesn't just understand intellectually—the student sees directly. This seeing is beyond concept. It's not like understanding a idea. It's like recognizing your own face.

The tradition states: The sign of transmission is recognition. Not belief—not faith—not acceptance. Recognition. The student sees: this is it. This has always been it. There was never anything else.

A sharp voice cuts: Intellectual understanding is not transmission. Emotional experience is not transmission. Even profound stillness is not transmission. Transmission is the direct seeing of the nature—once and for all.

Now we teach how to prepare for transmission.

A voice explains: Preparation is essential. The mind must be ready. The heart must be open. The student must have the proper foundation—preliminary practices, accumulated merit, purified obscurations.

The tradition adds: But preparation is also not the key. Even with perfect preparation, transmission may not come. Even without preparation, transmission may come. The guru knows when the student is ready. The guru gives transmission when the time is right.

A bridging voice reflects: This is mysterious. The student cannot force transmission. Cannot earn it. Cannot bargain for it. Can only be ready and wait. This is why devotion is important—devotion opens the heart, makes it ready.

Now we teach what happens after transmission.

A voice speaks: After transmission, practice changes. Not because practice is required—but because recognition naturally expresses itself. The student doesn't practice to become enlightened. The student practices because enlightenment is recognized.

The tradition explains: This is the beginning of the actual path—the path of a dzogchen practitioner. The student has seen the nature. Now the student must stabilize this seeing. This takes time. This takes practice. But the practice is different now. It's not seeking anymore—it's deepening.

Now we teach the stages after transmission—the progress of a dzogchen practitioner.

A voice describes: The first stage is called da byin—going beyond. The practitioner goes beyond ordinary appearances, beyond ordinary concepts. This is the initial recognition, fresh and vivid.

The second stage is called gtan tshigs—determining meaning. The practitioner examines the recognition, confirms it, stabilizes it. This is not doubt—this is discrimination. Knowing what is and what is not.

The third stage is called nyams su len pa—taking to heart. The practitioner internalizes the recognition. It becomes natural, continuous. Not just in meditation—in all activities.

These stages may seem sequential, but they are really one. As recognition deepens, all three happen simultaneously. The practitioner moves freely between them, depending on circumstance.

Now we teach the obstacles after transmission.

A sharp voice warns: After transmission, new obstacles arise. The biggest is thinking you have arrived. The recognition becomes an idea. The experience becomes a memory. The ego uses the transmission to reinforce itself.

The tradition explains: This is why continued practice is essential. Not to achieve something—but to keep recognition fresh. The student must remain vigilant. Must keep examining the mind. Must not settle into comfortable belief.

A bridging voice adds: But even this obstacle is not a problem. The obstacle IS the path—recognized. When ego tries to use the transmission, see through this. The recognition remains pure. This is the nature of Dzogchen practice.

Now we teach the completion of the path.

A voice concludes: When the practitioner completes the path, there is no practitioner and no path. Recognition is continuous, stable, complete. The three bodies manifest naturally. The practitioner serves beings without seeking anything in return.

The tradition states: This is not a special state—it's what was always present. The completion is recognizing completion. The enlightenment is seeing enlightenment. The Buddha is realizing Buddha-nature.

A sharp voice cuts: The completion is not a destination—it's a perspective. From the perspective of completion, everything is complete. From the perspective of a practitioner still seeking, completion seems far away. The shift in perspective IS the path.

Now we teach the final teaching on Dzogchen.

A voice speaks: Dzogchen is the Great Perfection. Not perfection as in improved—not perfection as in complete in parts. Perfection as in total—as in all-aspect—as in nothing missing.

The tradition explains: The Great Perfection is not a state you enter. It's not a level you achieve. It's what you are right now. The practice is seeing this. The result is this seen. The path is this seeing. This is Dzogchen.

Emaho! May all practitioners receive transmission, stabilize recognition.
complete the path. May all beings recognize their own nature and be liberated. May the treasury of the Supreme Vehicle shine forever.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we turn to additional aspects—the relationship between empowerment and everyday experience.

A voice speaks: The empowerment has implications beyond formal practice. It changes how you experience the world. Colors are brighter. Sounds are clearer. Life is more vivid. This is not illusion—this is the world revealed without the filter of concepts.

The tradition explains: Ordinary perception is clouded by mental constructions. We see what we expect to see, hear what we expect to hear. The empowerment clears these clouds. Reality shines through. This is called the "pure perception" of an enlightened being.

A bridging voice adds: But this doesn't mean practitioners should seek special experiences. The brightness will come when it comes. Seeking it creates more concepts, more clouds. The key is to rest in recognition regardless of experience.

Now we teach the integration of practice and life.

A voice describes: Practice must be integrated with life. Not separated—not special—not set apart. Practice is life, life is practice. When you eat, eat mindfully. When you walk, walk mindfully. When you sleep, sleep mindfully. This is meditation in action.

The tradition adds: The separation of practice and life is the source of confusion. Practitioners think: now I'm practicing, now I'm not. This creates duality. The empowerment reveals: there is no separation. Everything is practice. Everything is the path.

A sharp voice cuts: This doesn't mean you should become reckless. You still follow the teachings, keep the samaya, practice the methods. But you understand: the methods are not separate from life. Life is the method. The path is living.

Now we teach the relationship between empowerment and compassion.

A voice speaks: Empowerment naturally generates compassion. When you recognize the nature, you see that all beings possess this nature. All are destined for enlightenment. All are worthy of love.

The tradition explains: This compassion is not emotional—not sentimental. It's the natural expression of wisdom seeing reality. All beings are suffering because they forget. All beings will be liberated when they remember. This understanding produces compassion—unconditional, limitless.

A bridging voice adds: Compassion is also the measure of progress. If your practice makes you more compassionate, it's genuine. If your practice makes you less compassionate, something is wrong. Check your understanding.

Now we teach the purpose of all this—the welfare of all beings.

A voice concludes: The ultimate purpose of empowerment, practice.
enlightenment is the welfare of all beings. Not personal liberation—not escape from samsara—but returning to the world to help.

The tradition states: This is the bodhisattva vow. To remain in samsara until all beings are liberated. But this is not burden—it's joy. Serving others is the expression of enlightened mind. It is what enlightened ones do naturally.

Emaho! May all beings benefit from the empowerment. May all beings recognize their nature. May all beings attain enlightenment for the benefit of all.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we turn to final reflections on the teaching.

A voice reflects: We have covered the times and signs of empowerment. We have explored the practices and the path. We have touched the result. What remains is the simple recognition—this is it.

The tradition adds: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is for practitioners to practice. To receive empowerment. To find the guru. To recognize the nature.

A sharp voice concludes: Don't delay. Don't hesitate. The nature is present now. The guru is present now. The path is present now. Recognition is possible now. This is the message of Dzogchen—the Great Perfection is here, now, always.

Emaho! May the treasury of the Supreme Vehicle be known to all. May the path of Dzogchen spread throughout the world. May all beings recognize the nature and be liberated.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we teach deeper aspects of the empowerment—the nature of the empowerment beyond the ritual.

A voice speaks: The empowerment is not something the guru gives you like an object. It is the recognition of what was always present. The ritual is just a doorway. What passes through is awareness recognizing itself.

The tradition explains: There are three aspects to empowerment. The first is the blessing of the guru entering the student—this awakens the potential. The second is the pointing out of the nature—this reveals what was hidden. The third is the conferral of permission—this authorizes practice. All three happen in the moment of transmission.

A bridging voice adds: These three cannot be separated. The blessing contains the pointing. The pointing contains the permission. In genuine transmission, all three occur simultaneously. This is why找一个 qualified guru is essential—only one who has received transmission can give transmission.

Now we teach the preparation for receiving empowerment.

A voice describes: The student must prepare properly. This means completing preliminary practices—prostrations, mandala offerings, guru yoga.
the hundred syllables. These create the conditions for reception. Without preparation, the empowerment may not take root.

The tradition adds: But preparation is also about the mind. The student must have genuine faith—not blind belief, but trust in the process. The student must have genuine devotion—not emotional attachment, but longing for liberation. The student must have genuine openness—not philosophical position, but willingness to see.

A sharp voice cuts: Without these inner qualities, even the best ritual produces nothing. The empowerment falls on barren ground. The seed cannot grow. Prepare the ground first—the rest will follow.

Now we teach what happens during the empowerment ritual.

A voice explains: The ritual has many elements—visualizations, recitations, mudras, mantras. These are not magic. They are methods to prepare the mind. Each element points to an aspect of the nature. Through the ritual, these aspects are revealed.

The tradition details: First, the guru visualizes the deity and generates the mandala. This represents the purity of the environment. Second, the student is invited to enter the mandala. This represents the purity of the person. Third, the guru confers the empowerment—this represents the transmission of potential. Fourth, the student receives the empowerments—this represents the actualization of the path.

A bridging voice adds: Each empowerment has its own visualization. The vajra represents awareness—indestructible. The bell represents emptiness—everything included. The damaru represents time—moment to moment. The kapala represents wisdom—seeing reality. These symbols are not arbitrary—they point to the nature.

Now we teach the four empowerments in detail.

A voice speaks: The first is the vase empowerment. This opens the channels and plants the seed of the body. The second is the secret empowerment. This opens the energy and plants the seed of speech. The third is the knowledge wisdom empowerment. This opens the mind and plants the seed of awareness. The fourth is the word empowerment. This opens all and completes the path.

The tradition explains: These four are not separate. They are one path with four aspects. As one opens, all open. As one completes, all complete. The sequence varies, but the result is the same—the full realization of potential.

A sharp voice cuts: These empowerments are not given—they are revealed. The student already possesses the potential. The guru simply points this out. This is why the guru is essential—not as a giver, but as a pointer.

Now we teach the signs of successful empowerment.

A voice describes: After empowerment, certain signs may arise. Some experience heat or cold. Some see lights or forms. Some hear sounds or voices. Some feel bliss or emptiness. These are signs that the channels are opening, the potential is awakening.

The tradition adds: But these signs are not the goal. Don't chase them. Don't grasp at them. They are passing phenomena. The real sign is deeper recognition—the seeing of the nature. This is what the empowerment confers. This is what matters.

A bridging voice reflects: Sometimes no obvious signs arise. The empowerment is still successful. The seed is planted—it will grow in its own time. The farmer doesn't dig up the seed to check. Have patience. The plant will emerge when ready.

Now we teach what to do after empowerment.

A voice speaks: After empowerment, the student should practice. The preliminary practices prepare the ground. The actual practices water the seed. Without practice, the empowerment remains potential—unactualized.

The tradition explains: The practice after empowerment depends on the empowerment received. After vase empowerment, practice generation stage. After secret empowerment, practice mantra. After knowledge wisdom empowerment, practice completion stage. After word empowerment, practice the unity.

A sharp voice cuts: But don't become attached to the practice. The practice is a method, not an end. Eventually, even practice should be released. Rest in the nature—this is the highest practice.

Now we teach common mistakes after empowerment.

A voice warns: Some students think empowerment is enough—they don't need practice. This is wrong. The empowerment is just the beginning. Practice is essential.

Some students think practice is enough—they don't need a guru. This is wrong. Without a guru, the path is unclear. Confusion arises.

Some students think understanding is enough—they don't need meditation. This is wrong. Intellectual understanding is not direct recognition. Meditation stabilizes what understanding points to.

The tradition adds: Balance is key. Receive empowerment. Follow the guru. Practice diligently. This is the path.

A bridging voice reflects: But also don't become obsessed. The nature is already present. The practice is not to gain something new—it's to recognize what's already there. Don't stress. Relax. This is Dzogchen.

Now we teach advanced aspects—the actual Dzogchen practice.

A voice speaks: After empowerment and basic practice, the student enters Dzogchen proper. This is the practice of rigpa—awareness knowing itself. Not visualization, not mantras, not analysis. Just rest in pure awareness.

The tradition explains: The practice has two aspects. The first is stillness—resting in rigpa without movement. The second is movement—rigpa in all activities. Both are the same rigpa. The practitioner learns to rest in both.

A sharp voice cuts: This is not concentration. It's not meditation. It's not anything you do. It's what you are—recognizing yourself. Just look. Just see. This is the practice.

Now we teach the view of Dzogchen.

A voice describes: The Dzogchen view is simple: everything is display of awareness. Forms, sounds, thoughts—all are awareness appearing. There is nothing outside awareness. There is no awareness apart from appearances. They are one.

The tradition explains: This is not idealism—not that mind creates reality. It's not realism—not that reality exists independently. It's beyond both. Reality is awareness. Awareness is reality. They are not two.

A bridging voice adds: This view is not a concept to hold. It's a recognition to stabilize. Once recognized, rest in it. Let it permeate all activities. This is Dzogchen practice.

Now we teach the meditation of Dzogchen.

A voice speaks: Dzogchen meditation is rest in rigpa. Not trying to concentrate. Not trying to calm. Not trying to achieve anything. Just resting in awareness—knowing its own nature.

The tradition explains: When you rest, appearances arise. Let them arise. They are the display. Don't chase them. Don't reject them. Rest in the awareness that knows them. This is rigpa.

A sharp voice cuts: There's nothing to achieve. There's nothing to become. Rest as you are. The nature is already complete. This is Dzogchen meditation.

Now we teach the action of Dzogchen.

A voice describes: After rest, action arises naturally. The enlightened action is serving beings. Not seeking reward. Not seeking recognition. Just serving—because all beings are your own display.

The tradition explains: The dzogchen practitioner doesn't withdraw from the world. Engages fully—but without grasping. Acts—but without attachment. This is the unity of wisdom and compassion.

A bridging voice adds: This is the bodhisattva ideal—but realized naturally, not as a vow. The practitioner sees beings suffering and helps—not out of obligation, but out of wisdom. This is the highest action.

Now we teach the result of Dzogchen.

A voice concludes: The result is complete enlightenment. Not becoming a Buddha—recognizing Buddha-nature. Not escaping samsara—seeing samsara as display. Not achieving something new—revealing what was always present.

The tradition states: The three bodies arise naturally. Nirmanakaya—the manifested body serving beings. Sambhogakaya—the enjoyment body of pure experience. Dharmakaya—the truth body of ultimate reality. These are not achievements—they are natural expressions.

A sharp voice cuts: This result is not in the future. It's now. Recognize now and it's achieved. The path is just this recognition—fresh each moment. This is Dzogchen.

Now we conclude this teaching on empowerment.

A voice speaks: We have covered the times, the signs, the practices, the view, the meditation, the action.
the result. The empowerment is the key—it unlocks the potential. Without it, the path is locked. With it, liberation is certain.

The tradition concludes: Receive empowerment. Find the guru. Practice diligently. Recognize the nature. Serve all beings. This is the path of Dzogchen. This is the Great Perfection.

Emaho! May all beings receive empowerment. May all beings recognize the nature. May all beings attain enlightenment for the benefit of all.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we turn to additional aspects—the integration of all teachings.

A voice speaks: The teachings we have covered—empowerment, practice, view—are not separate. They are one integrated path. Each supports the other. Together, they lead to enlightenment.

The tradition explains: The view informs the practice. The practice stabilizes the view. The empowerment initiates both. Without view, practice is blind. Without practice, view is conceptual. Without empowerment, neither takes root.

A bridging voice adds: This integration is the heart of the path. The practitioner doesn't pick and choose—embraces the whole. This is why a qualified guru is essential—to integrate the teachings correctly.

Now we teach the relationship between Dzogchen and other vehicles.

A voice describes: Dzogchen is the highest vehicle—beyond the nine vehicles. Not that other vehicles are wrong—they lead to the same result. But Dzogchen is direct—shortest path to enlightenment.

The tradition explains: The Hinayana path develops individual liberation. The Mahayana path develops bodhicitta. The Vajrayana path develops tantric methods. Dzogchen bypasses all—direct recognition of the nature. This is its uniqueness.

A sharp voice cuts: But Dzogchen requires qualification. Not everyone can receive it. Not everyone can practice it. Those who cannot should follow other vehicles. The path suited to the student is the right path.

Now we teach the contemporary application of these teachings.

A voice speaks: In modern times, these teachings remain relevant. The nature of mind hasn't changed. The path to liberation remains the same. The challenges may differ—the solutions are timeless.

The tradition adds: Modern practitioners face distractions—technology,busyness, noise. But the practice is the same—recognizing awareness amidst appearances. The method adapts—but the view remains.

A bridging voice reflects: The key is consistency. Practice daily—not occasionally. Even brief practice, done regularly, brings results. The nature responds to devotion.

Now we teach final reflections.

A voice concludes: The times and signs of empowerment have been explained. The path is clear. The result is certain. What remains is practice.

The tradition ends: Don't delay. The nature is present now. Recognition is possible now. This is Dzogchen. This is the Great Perfection.

Emaho! May the treasury of the Supreme Vehicle remain open. May all beings recognize the nature. May all beings be liberated.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we teach the practical details of empowerment timing—the outer, inner.
secret dimensions.

A voice speaks: The timing of empowerment is not arbitrary. It corresponds to the student's potential, the guru's blessing.
the nature of the practice. Understanding these dimensions helps the student recognize the proper time.

The tradition explains: The outer timing relates to external conditions—calendar, seasons, astrological factors. The inner timing relates to the student's readiness—mental, emotional, spiritual. The secret timing relates to the guru's intuition—knowing when the moment is ripe.

A bridging voice adds: These three must align. Even if the student is ready externally and internally, if the guru doesn't give the empowerment, it doesn't happen. Even if the guru is willing, if the student isn't ready, it doesn't take. The alignment is key.

Now we teach the specific timings in detail.

A voice describes: The best years for empowerment are the dragon, snake, horse.
pig—these correspond to the four elements and their corresponding wisdoms. The best months are the first four months of the year—springtime, new beginnings. The best days are during the waxing moon—from new to full, increasing energy.

The tradition adds: The best times are midday and midnight—these are the pivot points, when one state transitions to another. The transition points are doorways—when the nature is more accessible.

Now we teach what happens if timing is wrong.

A sharp voice warns: If empowerment is given at the wrong time, problems arise. The student may not receive it properly. The practice may not progress. Obstacles may manifest.

The tradition explains: But this is not absolute. The nature works in mysterious ways. Sometimes even poor timing can still transmit. The key is the student's faith and the guru's blessing. These can override timing concerns.

A bridging voice reflects: Don't become obsessive about timing. The nature provides opportunities constantly. If you miss one, another comes. The path is patient. Have faith and continue.

Now we teach the signs of proper timing.

A voice speaks: When timing is correct, certain signs appear. The student feels a natural openness. The guru feels a natural inclination. The environment feels supportive. Things flow easily.

The tradition adds: These signs are not guarantees—but indicators. The wise practitioner pays attention. The wise guru recognizes. Together, they find the right moment.

Now we teach the conclusion—the union of all aspects.

A voice concludes: The times and signs of empowerment have been explained—the elaborate and non-elaborate, the outer and inner, the practical and mystical. Understanding these helps the student navigate the path.

The treasury is the nature. The empowerment is the pointing. The practice is the ripening. The result is the recognition. Everything is one path—from first contact to final enlightenment.

The tradition cuts: Understand this: The result is recognizing what was never lost. Stop seeking. Start seeing. This is Dzogchen.

Emaho! May all practitioners find the right guru, receive the proper empowerment, practice faithfully.
recognize the nature. May the treasury of the Supreme Vehicle illuminate the world.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we turn to the final teaching—what remains when all is said.

A voice speaks: After all explanations, after all practices, after all stages—what remains? Only the nature. Pure, simple, present. Not as a concept—not as an experience—not as a state. Just what is.

The tradition explains: The teachings are completed. The path is complete. The result is complete. Nothing more to add. Nothing more to remove. This is what is.

A bridging voice adds: This is Dzogchen—the Great Perfection. Not perfection as improvement—but perfection as totality. All aspects included. Nothing missing. This is what you are.

Now we teach .

A voice dedicates: May all beings receive empowerment. May all beings find qualified gurus. May all beings practice faithfully. May all beings recognize the nature. May all beings attain enlightenment for the benefit of all.

The tradition concludes: The treasury of the Supreme Vehicle is open. The path of the Great Perfection is clear. The result of Dzogchen is certain. May all beings recognize this and be liberated.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we teach deeper aspects of the empowerment—what occurs in the subtle dimensions.

A voice speaks: Beyond the outer ritual, there are inner and secret dimensions to empowerment. These affect the student at deeper levels—the energy body, the mind stream, the consciousness itself.

The tradition explains: The outer ritual works with the physical body and gross mind. The inner empowerment works with the energy channels and subtle mind. The secret empowerment works with the consciousness and the nature of mind. All three are necessary for full realization.

A bridging voice adds: This is why multiple empowerments are given—not just one. Each opens a different dimension. Together, they prepare the complete person for the path.

Now we teach about the energy dimensions.

A voice describes: The subtle body has channels—nadis—and energies—prana. These carry the life force and consciousness. When blocked, we suffer. When open, we are free. The empowerment clears these channels.

The tradition explains: During empowerment, the guru's blessing moves through the student's channels. Blockages dissolve. Energy flows freely. This is not metaphor—it is actual physiological change. The practice that follows maintains this openness.

A sharp voice cuts: This is why preliminary practices are essential—they prepare the channels for the blessing. Without preparation, the energy cannot flow. Blockages remain. The empowerment cannot take full effect.

Now we teach about the mind dimensions.

A voice speaks: The mind has ordinary consciousness and pure awareness. Ordinary consciousness creates samsara. Pure awareness is Buddha-nature. The empowerment reveals this distinction.

The tradition explains: Before empowerment, we live in ordinary consciousness—thinking, feeling, perceiving, all the time. After empowerment, we begin to access pure awareness—the rigpa that knows itself. This is the key change.

A bridging voice adds: This change doesn't happen all at once. It develops through practice. First, glimpses of awareness. Then, longer rests. Then, continuous recognition. This is the progress of a dzogchen practitioner.

Now we teach about consciousness dimensions.

A voice describes: There are levels of consciousness—from gross to subtle to very subtle. Gross consciousness thinks. Subtle consciousness witnesses. Very subtle consciousness is the nature itself. The empowerment introduces all three.

The tradition explains: Gross consciousness is ordinary mind—we all know this. Subtle consciousness is the witness—we sometimes experience this. Very subtle consciousness is rigpa—rarely experienced, but always present. The empowerment plants the seed of recognizing very subtle consciousness.

Now we teach the completion of the teaching.

A voice concludes: We have explored the times, signs, practices, view, meditation, action, result, dimensions.
completion. The teaching on empowerment is vast—but the essence is simple: recognize the nature.

The treasury is the nature—always present, always available. The empowerment is the pointing—guru shows what is present. The practice is the ripening—stabilizing what was pointed to. The result is the recognizing—seeing clearly what was always seen.

The tradition cuts: The essence: This is you.

Emaho! May all beings recognize the nature. May all beings rest in rigpa. May all beings be liberated. May the treasury of the Supreme Vehicle shine forever.

Sarva Mangalam.

Now we turn to the final reflections—the integration of all aspects of the path.

A voice speaks: The path of Dzogchen integrates everything—the view of Mahayana, the methods of Vajrayana, the realization of Dzogchen. It doesn't reject other vehicles—it includes them. This is its uniqueness.

The tradition explains: Other vehicles emphasize certain aspects. Dzogchen includes all. The view includes the Madhyamaka view. The method includes tantric methods. The result is the same as other vehicles—but arrived at more directly.

A bridging voice adds: This integration is the hallmark of the Great Perfection. Not partial—complete. Not exclusive—inclusive. Dzogchen embraces the entire Buddhist path.

Now we teach about the continuum of practice.

A voice describes: Practice continues from empowerment to death and beyond. At death, the practitioner recognizes the bardo—intermediate state—and attains liberation. This is the completion of the path.

The tradition explains: The signs of a mature practitioner at death are clear. No fear. No attachment. Recognition of the nature. Perhaps the body dissolves into light. Perhaps the mind arises as rainbow body. These are the signs of completion.

A sharp voice cuts: But don't wait for death. Practice now. The moment of death is like other moments—if you can't recognize now, you won't recognize then. Stability must be developed in life.

Now we teach the of merit.

A voice dedicates: We have explained the times and signs of empowerment. We have explored the path in detail. We have revealed the treasury. Now we dedicate this merit to all beings.

May all beings receive empowerment. May all beings find qualified gurus. May all beings practice faithfully. May all beings recognize the nature. May all beings attain enlightenment.

The tradition concludes: The treasury of the Supreme Vehicle—the Great Perfection—is open. The path is clear. The result is certain. Recognition is possible now. This is Dzogchen.

Emaho! Sarva Mangalam.

Sarva Mangalam.
