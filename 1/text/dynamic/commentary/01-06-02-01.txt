The seed planted in fertile ground does not choose to grow. It grows because growth is its nature.
The teaching opens like a door that was never closed. What enters? Only what was already inside. The words are fingers pointing at a moon that has never been absent.

[7099-7099]
This wanderer.
The vessel receives water not by effort but by being empty and open.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[7099-7099]
Look. It is here.
Ripening is not transformation. It is recognition of what was always ripe.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[7099-7099]
Between the extremes, the vast middle way opens like a horizon that recedes as you approach.
The sun ripens all fruits without choosing. Its light asks nothing.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[7099-7099]
Like lightning illuminating the valley for an instant—such is the nature (rang bzhin) of direct recognition.
The empowerments are rain falling on different soils. The rain is the same.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. The flowering differs.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[7099-7099]
Thus. We proceed.
The seed planted in fertile ground does not choose to grow. It grows because growth is its nature.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

This hermit.

Recognize immediately.
Ripening is not transformation. It is recognition of what was always ripe.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

The empowerments are rain falling on different soils. The rain is the same.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was. The flowering differs.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[7099-7099]
Accordingly. The analysis.
The seed planted in fertile ground does not choose to grow. It grows because growth is its nature.
What appears to arise is merely what was never absent, taking form. The form is not separate from the forming. The knowing is not separate from what is known.

[7099-7099]
The sequence completes itself, not by reaching an end, but by recognizing there was never a beginning. Return to what you never left. Rest in what has never moved. The commentary ends where the teaching begins—in the space between thoughts where thoughts have never been.
