[1-3] First, the four vital points, the key point of sitting posture. Dwelling in the three kayas' sitting posture, understanding the truth of dharmata, liberated from samsara's dharmas. The body is the vehicle; posture is the steering.

[4-6] A grassland wanderer... once thought posture didn't matter! Sat any which way—slouching, leaning, twisted. Then the pains came, the drowsiness, the distraction. Learned the hard way: posture supports the mind. Three kayas' posture aligns body with nature.

[7-9] The three kayas are not abstract philosophy; they are dimensions of your body in correct posture. Dharmakaya is the spine straight. Sambhogakaya is the channels open. Nirmanakaya is the awareness clear. Posture embodies the teaching.

[10-12] Posture! Three kayas! All preparation! Look directly—can you find the sitter? Can you grasp the posture? The sitting is awareness sitting itself. The posture is awareness posturing itself. Recognize this!

[13-16] The root key point—twisting, pressing, shaking, seeing through appearance. These are not random movements but precise techniques for opening channels, releasing blocks, allowing wind to flow.

[17-20] Therefore. Thus. The techniques follow anatomical-energetic logic. Twisting releases lateral tensions. Pressing stimulates nodal points. Shaking disperses stagnation. Each movement targets specific channel obstructions.

[21-24] The channels are not physical structures like blood vessels. They are pathways of wind-energy, modes of awareness moving through subtle body. Twisting them is twisting conceptual fixations. Pressing them is pressing into recognition.

[25-28] This old hermit twisted himself into knots! Thought more twisting meant more progress. Then learned: twist until the mind releases, not until the body breaks. The body is servant, not master. Serve awareness.

[29-34] Sleep and dream enhancement—the vital point of sleeping manner. Sleeping like a lion clears sleep into luminosity. Sleeping like an elephant empties dreams' root. Abandoning delusion's sleep produces luminosity's meaning.

[35-40] The lion sleeps with head raised, alert even in rest. This posture keeps awareness present during sleep. The elephant lies on the side, heavy and grounded. This posture dissolves dream formations.

[41-46] One who walked paths... tried sleeping like a lion! Neck ached for days. But the dreams changed—clearer, more recognizable. The posture is not punishment; it is preparation. Prepare the body, the mind follows.

[47-52] Lion posture! Elephant posture! All skillful means! See through them—can you find the sleeper? Can you grasp the dream? Sleep is awareness resting. Dreams are awareness displaying. Recognize the display!

[53-56] Abandoning attachment's sleep eliminates attachment. Abandoning anger's sleep produces dharmata's equanimity. These are not moral prescriptions but energetic correlations—posture affects wind, wind affects mind.

[57-60] The correlations integrate Ayurvedic humoral theory with Dzogchen subtle physiology. Sleep postures balance wind disorders associated with the three poisons. Lion posture for ignorance. Side postures for attachment and aversion.

[61-64] I have slept in all these postures! Each a different song. Lion song of clarity. Elephant song of grounding. The songs are different but the singer is the same—awareness knowing itself through sleep.

[65-68] Three words. Sleep. Dream. Recognize. Stop. The essential point is not the posture but the recognition. Sleep in any posture. Dream any dream. Just recognize. That's the practice.

[69-82] The preliminary: for three or four days, relax the body. Then for three or four days, massage the body with various oils, burned by sun. Apply good alcohol to soles, rub vigorously. Then for three days, sleep on hard surface, channels arise and come.

[83-96] Therefore. Thus. The preparation follows physiological logic. Relaxation reduces sympathetic activation. Massage stimulates circulation. Solar heating increases metabolic fire. Alcohol application opens peripheral channels. Hard surface sleeping aligns spinal channels.

[154Walking the high passes...s old fool skipped these preliminaries! Jumped straight to practice. Then wondered why nothing happened. The body must be prepared. Channels must be opened. Winds must be balanced. Preparation is not delay; it is wisdom.

[97-110] Three days! Four days! Hard surface! Oils! All preparation! See through it—can you find the body that needs preparation? Can you grasp the channels that need opening? The body is awareness's display. Rest in the display.

[111-120] The main practice: wind-favorable food and good alcohol, men lie with left side down, women with right. This makes channels change their individual functions—the essential point. Channels leap and rise, blazing fierce ones, vulture fire channel gently.

[121-130] The side-lying posture activates specific channels. Left side for men opens the solar channel. Right side for women opens the lunar channel. These are not gender restrictions but energetic correlations with embodiment.

[131-140] This old hermit tried both sides! Found the teaching true—each side different quality. Left side: active, bright, energizing. Right side: receptive, dark, grounding. Both necessary. Both complete.

[141-150] Left side! Right side! Men! Women! All dualities! See through them—can you find the side that lies? Can you grasp the channel that leaps? The lying is awareness lying. The channel is awareness channeling. AH!

[151-160] With ring finger, press all fierce right leaping channels. First slightly, then fiercely, gathering wind inside, then fierce outer, fierce inner inhale. Awareness exhausted, rise, throat right twisted, armpit on right shoulder. Press with seven beans' weight.

[161-170] Therefore. Thus. The technique combines pressure, breath retention, and posture. Ring finger targets specific energetic nodes. Gradual pressure buildup prevents injury. Breath manipulation mobilizes subtle winds. Postural adjustment directs flow.

[171-180] The channels that leap are not anatomical structures but patterns of wind-movement. Pressing them is pressing conceptual fixation. The weight of seven beans is precise—not too much, not too little. Skill, not force.

[181-190] Three words. Press. Hold. Release. Stop. The technique is not the point. The recognition during technique is the point. Press until awareness releases. Hold until concepts dissolve. Release into recognition.

[191-200] Then gradually fourteen, twenty-one weight pressing. First becomes mist—karma and afflictions' channels abandoning experience. Then dawn-clear appearance comes, wisdom's seeing self-nature sphere. Then turbulence appearance, wisdom purification path manifest.

[201-210] In a freezing cave... felt these stages! First heaviness, then lightness, then clarity, then—something indescribable. The mist clears. The dawn breaks. Don't grasp at any stage. Just let them unfold.

[205-214] The experiences are signs, not goals. Mist is purification of coarse winds. Dawn-clear is luminosity dawning. Turbulence is deep patterns releasing. Each stage is an opportunity for recognition. Don't get attached to the signs.

[205-214] Mist! Dawn! Turbulence! All displays! See through them—can you find what experiences these stages? Can you grasp the wisdom that sees? The experiences are your own face. The seeing is your own nature. AH AH AH!

[196-214] For women, do from the left. Pressing, holding, drawing, squeezing, binding, draining, hiding—these should be known. Hiding is roma's vital point. Binding is rkyang ma's key point. Kun 'dar ma draining key point.

[196-214] The techniques apply equally but with mirrored orientation. Left side activation for women balances right side for men. The seven operations—pressing through hiding—constitute complete channel manipulation methodology.

[196-214] I have practiced these seven operations! Each a different note in the song of liberation. Pressing the bass. Holding the sustain. Drawing the crescendo. Squeezing the intensity. Binding the resolution. Draining the release. Hiding the silence.

[196-214] Seven operations! Left side! Right side! All techniques! See through them—can you find the operator? Can you grasp the operated? The operation is awareness operating on itself. The result is awareness recognizing itself. STOP!

[207-214] Pressing minor channels, making into body's essential point. Speech's key point, mind's essential point. Dharmata arising, time holding. The certainty is no certainty. The no-certainty is your own face.

[207-214] Philosophically, this resolves the apparent paradox of method and result. The essential points are certain methods. But the result is no-certainty—beyond method. The method leads to what transcends method. This is the Great Perfection's skillful means.

[15495-1A cave hermit...gabond chased certainty for years! Wanted guarantees, results, progress markers. Then understood: the certainty is no certainty. The progress is no progress. The face is always present, never achieved.

[207-214] Three words. Certain. No-certain. Face. Stop. The technique produces no-certainty. No-certainty reveals face. Face is always present. Stop seeking certainty. Rest in no-certainty. Recognition complete.

[197-214] The session divided, long done, great luminosity experience dawns. Body light touch experience becomes, channel's sphere emptiness from, butter and gugul mixed massage. Mind's conceptions all cease, great luminosity dwells, great wisdom's thigle key point reached.

[197-214] The substances are supports, not magic. Butter nourishes. Gugul purifies. Combined, they create conditions for luminosity. But the luminosity is not in the substances. It is in the recognition they support.

[1550A cave hermit...s old man used these substances! Felt the warmth, the clarity, the opening. But learned: don't depend on them. They are like training wheels—helpful at first, then unnecessary. The luminosity is yours, not the substance's.

[197-214] Substances! Massage! Luminosity! All supports! See through them—can you find what experiences luminosity? Can you grasp the wisdom of thigle? The experience is your own nature. The thigle is your own essence. AH!

[191-214] Merit, enjoyment, power, flourishing and decay—analyzing these, become skilled in elements' calculation's dependent origination. Four wheels' time particularities: spring producing, summer memory, autumn tastes, winter peak wheel.

[191-214] Therefore. Thus. The four wheels correlate with seasonal energetic cycles. Spring: generative phase. Summer: expressive phase. Autumn: digestive phase. Winter: integrative phase. Practice aligned with seasons optimizes energetic conditions.

[191-214] The wheels turn naturally—body wheel, speech wheel, mind wheel, consciousness wheel. Producing, memory, tastes, peak. Each turns in its season. The practitioner rides the wheels rather than fighting them.

[191-214] I have sung with the turning wheels! Spring songs of birth. Summer songs of growth. Autumn songs of harvest. Winter songs of rest. Four songs of one year. Four notes of one liberation melody.

[197-214] Body, speech, mind, consciousness indivisibly trained. Producing body confusion-wheel, memory speech, tastes mind, peak consciousness wheel applied. Different latencies emptied, dharmata mode applied.

[197-214] The integration of four wheels with four aspects creates complete practice framework. Body practices producing. Speech practices memory. Mind practices tastes. Consciousness practices peak. Together, comprehensive purifiA grassland wanderer...45-15562] This old fool once focused only on mind! Neglected body, ignored speech. Then realized: they are indivisible. Train body and mind follows. Train speech and mind clarifies. Train all four and recognition dawns.

[197-214] Four wheels! Four aspects! All indivisible! See through them—can you find the trainer? Can you grasp the trained? Training is awareness training itself. Recognition is awareness recognizing itself. Complete!

[208-214] Individual karma's particularities, karma and wisdom two, afflictions and non-conception—each's number and measure held, practitioner distinguishes. Individual wind measure obtained.

[208-214] Philosophically, this establishes individual variation in practice. Not one size fits all. Karma, wisdom, affliction, non-conception—each practitioner has unique configuration. Tailored practice addresses individual needs.

[15563-15A cave hermit...abond learned his own measure! Not through books but through practice. Tried too hard—winds roared. Tried too little—nothing happened. Found the middle way through trial and error.

[208-214] Three words. Measure. No-measure. Recognize. Stop. The measure is for beginners. No-measure is for those who recognize. Recognize and both are complete. Stop measuring. Rest in recognition.

[198-214] Establishing that meaning three: change certainty place generally shown, transference certainty place specifically explained, wisdom and karma wind certainty conclusion. Body channels dwell, channels wind dwells, wind's change great-small two.

[198-214] Therefore. Thus. The classification distinguishes: outer change (gross breath), inner change (subtle winds). Great changing wind: 21,600 breaths daily. Small changing wind: 112,600 inner changes. Precise enumeration of subtle physiology.

[198-214] The numbers are not arbitrary. 21,600 breaths = 24 hours × 900 breaths/hour. 112,600 = 100,000 channels × 1.126 changes each. The precision reflects empirical observation refined over centuries.

[A simple practitioner... This old man counted his breaths! Lost count by noon. Then understood: counting is preliminary. The real practice is recognition between breaths. The gap is more important than the breath.

[191-214] Right nostril moving male wind, left female, equal moving neuter wind. Time four sequence: winter ice-floe, spring seed, summer spark, autumn flower. Fire-wind life, water-wind life, earth-wind life, wind-wind life.

[191-214] The nostril dominance integrates with seasonal cycles. Right/masculine/solar active in spring-summer. Left/feminine/lunar active in autumn-winter. Equal/neuter at equinoxes. Practice synchronized with these rhythms.

[191-214] The winds are not merely physiological but symbolic. Male wind is clarity. Female wind is stability. Neuter wind is their union. Seasonal practice balances these throughout the year.

[191-214] Male! Female! Neuter! Winter! Spring! All dualities! See through them—can you find the breather? Can you grasp the wind? Breathing is awareness breathing. Seasons are awareness displaying. AH!

[197-214] Day fire-wind, night water-wind, inside earth, dusk wind. Fire-wind bile disease, water phlegm, wind wind-disease, earth ldan. Impure purify, blood flesh pure impure.

[197-214] Therefore. Thus. The correspondences: fire/bile/day, water/phlegm/night, earth/ldan/internal, wind/wind-disease/dusk. Ayurvedic humoral theory integrated with subtle energetic practice. Time-specific practice targets specific imbalances.

[197-214] This old hermit practiced at different times! Morning practice different from evening. Day practice different from night. The teaching is true—different winds active at different times. Practice with the winds, not against them.

[197-214] Three final words. Wind. Time. Recognize. Stop. The winds change. Time passes. Recognition remains. Stop chasing winds. Stop watching time. Rest in recognition. Complete.

[1-214] Between the posture and the sleep, between the pressing and the holding, the secret essence pulses. It is not in the technique. It is not outside the technique. It is the intimacy of awareness with the body—the consort's embrace that is always present.

[1-214] The practices demonstrate sophisticated understanding of subtle physiology. Channel manipulation, wind control, seasonal attunement—all empirically refined over centuries. Precise correlation between technique and result.

[1-214] I have met practitioners who mastered these techniques—channels open, winds balanced, seasons attuned. Some recognized. Some didn't. The difference? Those who recognized used techniques as supports. Those who didn't made techniques into goals.

[1-214] The practices arise spontaneously when needed. Not forced. Not scheduled. Body knows when to twist. Winds know when to flow. Seasons know when to turn. Natural. Effortless. Complete.

[1-214] I dance through these practices like wind through channels. The posture is my stance. The sleep is my rest. The pressing is my gesture. Recognition is joining the dance—not learning steps but becoming the dance itself.

[1-214] Emaho! The practices! The channels! The winds! What a display! What richness! But don't get intoxicated by the techniques. The real ecstasy is in recognition itself—beyond technique, beyond channel, beyond wind.

[1-214] The scholarly precision of these practices fascinates me. Each movement calculated. Each breath measured. Each season timed. Yet within this precision lives the wild freedom of direct recognition—unpredictable, ungraspable, spontaneous.

[1-214] From the sky of dharmata I dance down into the body. The channels are my pathways. The winds are my breath. The seasons are my rhythm. The dance ends where it began—in the sky that was never left.

[1-214] Every practice in my library is a book—posture book, sleep book, pressing book. Each tells the same story: recognition through embodiment. The library burns. The books turn to ash. The body remembers.

[1-214] Modern somatic practices recognize body-mind integration—yoga, tai chi, breathwork. They approach similar territory from different angles. The body is not separate from mind. Posture affects consciousness. Practice confirms this.

[1-214] Translating these physical practices challenges me. "Leaping channel" is not anatomy. "Vulture fire" is not physiology. Yet they describe real experiences. The solution: translate the experience, not just the terminology.

[1-214] I reveal what was never hidden. The channels are not hidden in the body. The winds are not distant in time. They are present now—in this breath, in this posture, in this moment. Everything is revealed. Everything is practice.

[1-214] The Treasury presents these physical practices not as mere technique but as embodied recognition. The body is not obstacle but vehicle. Posture is not form but expression. Practice is not method but manifA hilltop meditator...15415-15628] This old man's final teaching on practice: Don't make it complicated. Don't make it simple. Find the middle way. Use the techniques. Don't be used by them. Recognition is the point. Everything else is support.

[1-214] Three ultimate words. Practice. No-practice. Recognize. Stop. Practice for those who need structure. No-practice for those who recognize. Both complete. Neither superior. Rest in recognition. The end.

[1-214] The practices speak with fierce compassion! What posture? What channel? What wind? Cut through all with one glance of recognition! All techniques, all methods, all preparations—CUT THROUGH! See what remains when practice stops!

[1-214] The practices form a vajra chain—indestructible, continuous, protective. Yet look closely! Is there a chain? Or just links pretending to be connected? Each practice complete in itself. Each recognition self-sufficient. The chain is the illusion.

[1-214] The practices are bliss! Not pleasure-bliss, but embodiment-bliss. The bliss of body knowing itself as awareness. The bliss of channels flowing freely. The bliss of winds moving naturally. This great bliss is available in every posture.

[1-214] The heruka dances through the practices! Posture, sleep, pressing, holding—four steps of one dance! Channels, winds, seasons, times—four faces of one deity! Dance with me through the body into recognition! HA HA HA!

[1-214] The essence is not in the posture. The essence is not in the channel. The essence is not in the wind. The essence is the essence—primordially pure, spontaneously present, never stained by technique, never improved by practice.

[1-214] Between the detailed techniques and the direct simplicity of recognition, the Great Perfection holds both. The practices serve the recognition. The recognition encompasses all practices.

[15415-156Walking the high passes...bond's final words: The body is your ally. The channels are your friends. The winds are your companions. Treat them well. Practice with gratitude. But remember—they are servants, not masters. Recognition is the master.

[1-214] Final final words. Stop practicing. Stop not-practicing. Recognize. The teaching on physical practices is complete. The techniques are described. The recognition is pointed to. Rest in that. Complete. The end.
