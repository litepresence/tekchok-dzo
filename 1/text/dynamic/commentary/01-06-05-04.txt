Fourth joy—experience, mind and wisdom one. Myong ba, not mere sensation
but the experiencer and experienced dissolved into one taste. Dbyer mi
byed pa—without distinction, without separation. Like salt in water,
taste and wetness inseparable.

One without learning... once thought the four joys were sequential achievements.
First joy, then second, climbing upward. When fourth joy dawned, realized
no sequence—all four present simultaneously, like four sides of mountain
seen from different angles. Same peak, different views.

Salt dissolving—neither salt nor water remains separate. The knowing is
the taste. Mind and wisdom, experience and experiencer—they dissolve like
salt in water. Not becoming one, but recognized as never two.

Experience dissolves. Oneness recognized. Resting complete. Three words,
but the First Point again—recognize what's already one, rest there, return
when you forget it's one.

Mountain hermit watched snow melt into lake. Snow not lost, water not gained—
same nature, different appearance. Fourth joy: mind and wisdom not merging
but recognized as never separate. Taste the snow. Taste the water. Same taste.

Between seeking and resting lies the expanse. Fourth joy not achievement—
nature of awareness when grasping dissolves. Why analyze four joys? Present
now! Mind and wisdom never separate!

Singing yogi drinks from stream—mineral taste, immediate knowing. This
is fourth joy. Experience and awareness as one. Rest here.

Final: not end of path. Recognition there was never path, never traveler.
Just this—awareness experiencing itself. Complete. Emaho!
