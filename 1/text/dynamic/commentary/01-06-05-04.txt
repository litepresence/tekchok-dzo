Fourth joy—experience, mind and wisdom one. The culmination of bliss, where experience and experiencer dissolve into one taste. Not two, not one—beyond both.

I once chased the four joys like a hunter after game. First joy, second joy, third joy—always seeking the next. When the fourth joy dawned, he realized: there was never a sequence. All four were present simultaneously, like the four sides of a mountain seen from different angles.

Salt dissolving in water—taste knows. The salt is not separate from the water. The taste is not separate from the salt. Mind and wisdom, experience and experiencer—they dissolve like salt in water. The knowing is the taste. The taste is the knowing.

Mountain hermit by a high plateau lake understood: the water tastes of the minerals it holds. The mind experiences the wisdom it is. No separation. No duality. Just one taste.

Three words that liberate: Recognize primordial awareness. Rest without distraction. Return whenever lost. Experience the joy. Recognize the oneness. Rest in that recognition. Don't seek further. Don't elaborate. The fourth joy is complete.

Between the seeking of bliss and the resting in recognition, we find the vast expanse. The joy is not an achievement—it is the nature of awareness when not obscured by grasping.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why analyze the four joys? The fourth is present now! Mind and wisdom are never separate! Stop chasing and recognize!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you drink water from the stream, while you taste its mineral richness, remember—this is the fourth joy. Experience and awareness as one.

Final instruction: the fourth joy is not the end of a path. It is the recognition that there was never a path, never a traveler, never a destination. Just this—awareness experiencing itself. Rest here.

Emaho! The wonder of mind and wisdom as one taste, experience and experiencer dissolved, the fourth joy spontaneously present.
