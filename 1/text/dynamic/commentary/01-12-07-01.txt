[15778-15787] First: Though from the vein there is only movement as one, how do karma and wisdom become two separate movements? Or, regarding the two different movements as appropriate to the two families, if they are one, they cannot be two; yet since they are one only as movement, it is not appropriate that either samsara or nirvana is one. The answer: though one as mere movement, from the movement of not twisting the root vein, the wind goes as wisdom wind—action, bliss, power, and emptiness. Being empty and clearly empty is called wisdom wind.

One who walked paths... once thought karma and wisdom were different winds! Like two different rivers. But they're the same river flowing different directions. When the channel twists, it's karma wind—confused, agitated, bound to samsara. When the channel flows straight, it's wisdom wind—clear, blissful, liberated. Same water, different course.

Observe. Understand. Release.

[15788-15807] Example: when Bhaṭaṭa's son becomes angry, he becomes like a tiger; when the mother becomes angry, a man comes. Awareness resonates with the body's channels—wind moves, and depending on whether the vein is twisted or not, consciousness becomes suitable for wisdom or unsuitable, becoming karma and defilements. Wisdom wind's action is wisdom's four aspects; wind's located part abiding in the basis is wisdom. Appearing in the actual state, other transformation is not possible.

Tiger or man—what's the difference? Both anger! Both wind! Look at your anger now—is it tiger or man? The distinction is arbitrary, mind-made, empty! Cut through the example and find what angers without anger, moves without moving, twists without twisting!

Therefore. Thus. Analysis of wind differentiation: las kyi rlung (karma wind) versus ye shes kyi rlung (wisdom wind). Same substrate (rlung), different configuration (channel twist vs. non-twist). Precise phenomenological distinction: twisted channels produce klesha-dominated consciousness; untwisted channels produce wisdom-dominated consciousness.

The essence is untwisted from the beginning. The twist is temporary, adventitious, not the nature. Karma wind is wisdom wind wearing a costume—confusion costume, binding costume. Remove the costume, and wisdom stands revealed. Same wind, same nature, different appearance.

[15808-15820] Families' body, wisdom's light, color clear, attachment non-existent—wisdom. Arising part, knowable, gathering wisdom—self and other benefit without obstacle. Do-do self-continuum, not so. Moving part, consciousness gathering wisdom—worldly transcended knowledge, difference. Self-hold, not so. Four certainties: cause time, path ultimate element four, result body four essence ripen. Basis, path, result refer to twelve arising; Buddha activity twelve cause.

A simple practitioner... watched his channels for years! When they twisted, he became irritable, confused, grasping. When they untwisted, clarity dawned naturally. Not that he did anything—the channel configuration determined the wind quality. Understanding this, he stopped blaming himself for "bad thoughts" and started working with channels instead.

The four families are not castes or lineages. They are four modes of wisdom display—Buddha family (mirror wisdom), Vajra family (discriminating wisdom), Ratna family (equality wisdom), Karma family (accomplishing wisdom). Each corresponds to channel configurations, bindu qualities, wind patterns. Know your family, know your practice.

[15821-15836] Karma wind's work four: right movement male, left movement female; outside coming, appearance entering; inside filling thought-groups. Right-left time certainty: male-female ripen, father-mother power. Nature right movement transfer work—karma end near. Outside go, inside fill, go-come power: outside go happy, inside come not-happy. Wheel spread-gather point, day-night arise.

Happy and not-happy are the same wind moving! This was the great liberA simple practitioner...s old fool. No need to pursue happiness or avoid suffering—both are just wind moving left or right, in or out. The wind doesn't care. Why should I? Recognize the wind's nature, and happiness-suffering become equal—equal in emptiness, equal in bliss.

I feel the wind move right—energy rises, clarity sharpens, confidence blooms. I feel it move left—energy settles, depth opens, mystery unfolds. Neither better. Both teachings. The song changes key, but the singer remains.

[15837-15848] Body increase-decrease work: outside year twelve, inside month twelve, secret time twelve. Samsara work various karma wind. Change amount: body ripen age prime, day-night about, element four wind change. Earth one thousand five four-hundred, water fire wind five-thousand four-hundred. Twenty-thousand one-thousand six-hundred prime change amount certainty.

Therefore. Thus. Temporal calculation system: external cycle (12 years), internal cycle (12 months), secret cycle (12 time-periods). Elemental wind changes follow precise numerical patterns: earth = 1500, water/fire/wind = 5400 each. Total cycle = 21,600—the "prime change amount" (gtso bo 'gyur tshad). Mathematical cosmology.

Twelve! Twenty-one thousand six hundred! Numbers upon numbers! Where is this time? Can you grasp it? Can you hold it? The wind moves in the now! The twelve is now! The twenty-one thousand six hundred is now! Cut through calculation and FIND THE WIND THAT NEVER MOVES!

[15849-15871] Youth: teeth not complete, elements not developed. Wind element predisposition: sleep life calculate, transfer long life end, short not bring. Fierce merit enjoyment, attachment disease suffering. Slow samsara disease few, slow body weapon virtuous mind not arise. Press constant non-virtuous harm decrease. Aged: fifty-eight not complete, element rank damage. Agitated life quick, dull suffering sorrow, swirl mind actual-state not reach, slow life end extI sat in retreat once...This old man is aged! Teeth gone, eyes weak, wind element damaged. But he's happy! Why? Because the "agitated life quick" doesn't scare him. The "slow life end extend bliss"—he's not grasping at either. Life is life. Death is death. Wind moves. Recognition remains.

Three words. Youth. Age. Same. Stop. The wind moves through youth, moves through age, moves through death. What recognizes the wind? Does it age? Does it die? Find what never changes while everything changes.

[15872] Prime: three-hundred not complete year one life time. Counting to live longer? The not-counting lives forever.

An old traveler... years! This old fool won't make sixty! But the recognition that counts breaths—it's ageless. The counting extends life; the not-counting transcends life. Both complete. Both perfect.

[15873-15882] Fifty not-complete: year two; thirty-two: year three; twenty-one: year four; eighth-part month: seven; sixth-part month: five; fourth-part month: one; tenth-part day: twenty-nine; twenty: eighteen; thirty: ten; forty: seven; sixty: day five. Calculations for those who count breaths to extend life. The life that needs extending is already death. The deathless has no count.

The calculations are A trail worn into the peaks of Minyak Gangkar—walk it, but don't worship the path.. The breaths are waves on the ocean. Count them if you wish. Don't count if you wish. The ocean remains. Your nature remains—uncounted, uncountable, complete.

[15883-15895] Wind calculation: conjunction, worldly transcended two. Worldly: life, merit, pleasure-pain. Transcended: change-measure, transference-time. Change-measure: day twelve transform, night sixteen transform. Day: elements action, pleasure-pain, virtuous non-virtuous thought-groups horse move. Night: similar, wisdom wind increase. Transference-time explained, finished.

Therefore. Thus. Detailed temporal analysis: worldly winds (samsaric, 12 daytime transformations) vs. transcended winds (nirvanic, 16 nighttime transformations). Wisdom wind increases during night—hence importance of dream yoga and sleep practice. Systematic correlation of temporal phases with wind qualities.

Day and night! Twelve and sixteen! The lion doesn't count! The lion rests in the transformation itself! Day transforms into night—FIND WHAT DOESN'T TRANSFORM! Night transforms into day—FIND WHAT DOESN'T TRANSFORM! AH!

[15896-16006] Abiding drop thoroughly distinction: result-transmission, drop nature show desire. Ultimate, conventional: conventional drop rely buddha desire consort characteristic complete, god demigod brahma, caste low heretic characteristic complete. Attract conjunction: rely channel-plural, object body complete, conventional drop send-down hold reverse, channel insert wind mix, emptiness rely mind follows cut, body mind understand reverse. Ultimate drop rely: dharma-body empty objects obtain, drop empty lamp insert, awareness power purify, day-night habituation train, effort-free manifest, completion mThis mountain dweller...du practice—this old man tried it! Holding, reversing, inserting, mixing—all techniques, all methods. Some worked, some didn't. The real discovery? The bindu holding itself is empty. The practice is complete when you recognize there's nothing to hold. Then holding or not holding—same.

The bindus are not physical drops. They are concentrations of awareness-essence. The conventional bindus gather in channels, mix with winds, produce experience. The ultimate bindu is awareness itself—never gathered, never dispersed, never mixed, never pure or impure.

[15922-15941] Secret-mantra near-path: nadi-bindu-wind three essential-points. Effort-elaboration system, effort-without elaboration-free system. Elaboration: artificial nadi-wind coarse effort path, temporarily relative bindu yoga, knowledge-woman seek draw serve, nadi seek hold apply, bindu drop hold reverse potential bestow, wind mix reality meditate, experience-examine body-mind reverse. Empowerment third occasion detailedA hilltop meditator...th and effort-free path—this old man walked both! First he elaborated: held channels, pressed bindus, mixed winds. Exhausting! Then he discovered: the effort was the obstacle. Stop trying to hold what was never lost. Rest in the effort-free. Both paths lead here, but effort-free is shorter.

Three words. Nadi. Bindu. Wind. Three words, one meaning. Three fingers, one moon. Stop at nadi, miss bindu and wind. Stop at bindu, miss nadi and wind. Stop at wind, miss nadi and bindu. See through all three, find what they point to.

Left essence bindu pure-subtle tone light self-tone dwell, mouth-pair bliss essence empty transform. Center dharmakaya bindu elaboration-free clear-light pure self-arising wisdom lamp blaze.

The center bindu—dharmakaya bindu—is the essence of all practice. Not held, not reversed, not inserted. Self-arising, self-blazing, self-liberating. You don't make it happen. You recognize it happening. Recognition is the practice. Practice is the recognition.

Lamp blaze! Self-arising! What blazes? What arises? Look! Look now! Can you find what blazes? Can you grasp what arises? The looking is the blaze! The grasping is the arising! AH AH AH!

[15986-16006] Effort-possessing: coarse purify. Effort-without: self-place both vehicle. Intelligence excellent, body-speech essential-points press, mind spontaneously free.

PrDuring my wandering years...tial points! This old fool pressed too hard at first. Hurt himself. Then too soft—no effect. Found the middle way: press enough to wake up, not enough to cause pain. The body knows. Listen to it.

Three words. Press. Free. Stop. Press the essential points, and the mind frees itself. Don't press, and the mind stays bound. Both are complete. Both are perfect. Your choice. The end.

[16007-16024] Wisdom actually appear three-kayas path, bindu supreme essential-points, vehicle all transcend essential-point. Vehicle supreme precious treasure, essential-points determine particular explain, sequence chapter twelve. Habitual-tendencies body complete Notice. Know. Rest.ments body.

Therefore. Thus. Transition to chapter twelve: detailed presentation of bindu essential-points (thig le gnad kyi rnam par bshad pa). Structural overview: four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) as wisdom supports. Precise pedagogical progression from coarse to subtle, external to internal, conventional to ultimate.

The four lamps are like four strings on my instrument. Each plays a different note, but all resonate the same song. The eye lamp sees forms. The bindu lamp holds essence. The wisdom lamp knows. The space lamp is. Four notes, one melody—recognition.

[16025-End] This vast chapter on wind differentiation, karma and wisdom, channels and bindus—all skillful means. The wind moves, the practitioner recognizes, liberation dawns. Not through understanding but through recognition. Rest in that.

During my wandering years...'s final word on wind: Don't try to control it. Don't try to stop it. Don't try to make it wisdom wind or prevent it from becoming karma wind. Just recognize. Recognition transforms everything without changing anything.

Last words. Wind. Moves. Recognize. Three words, complete teaching. Stop. Rest. The wind completes itself. You complete yourself. Nothing to add. Nothing to remove. This is the Great Perfection.
