To one truth-seeing person, all grounds completely exist! That introduction-shown person—first, at truth-seeing time, joy arisen to that is first ground, Great Joy!

A grassland wanderer... once thought he had to traverse the ten grounds sequentially. First ground, then second, then third—like climbing a mountain step by step. Then he saw: the ten grounds are not a staircase. They are ten perspectives on one recognition. All present simultaneously. All complete in one truth-seeing.

To that, knowing own-vision is awareness—second ground Stainless obtained! Then habituation to that—third ground Light-Doing conquered! Then habituated, seeing light's vision—fourth ground Light-Radiating conquered! Then habituated to wisdom's vision, all afflictions self-nature purified, seeing wisdom—fifth ground Difficult-to-Overcome conquered! Then from light, dust body manifest—sixth ground Manifest conquered! Then habituation completed, afflictions far-gone—seventh ground Far-Going conquered!

Mountain hermit by his cave understood: the grounds are like waves in a lake—apparently sequential, actually just water moving. The first wave doesn't cause the second. They arise together from the same source. So too with the ten grounds—one recognition, ten descriptions.

This wandering yogi asked a master: "How long to complete all ten grounds?" The master laughed. "How long does it take to recognize your face in a mirror? The recognition is immediate. The habituation takes lifetimes. But the grounds are complete from the first recognition."

Between the sequential view of grounds and the simultaneous completion, we find the middle way. The grounds appear sequential to those who need stages. They appear simultaneous to those who recognize. Both views are skillful means.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why count the grounds? Ten grounds, sixteen grounds—meanwhile, recognition is present! All grounds complete in one moment! Stop progressing and recognize!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you walk your daily path, while you meet each moment, the grounds are present. The first ground's joy in a smile. The stainless ground in a pure intention. All ten in every awareness.

Final instruction: the ten grounds are not destinations to reach. They are descriptions of recognition seen from different angles. Truth-seeing is all grounds. Recognition is complete accomplishment. Rest in that completion.

Emaho! The ten grounds of Dzogchen—all complete in one seeing, all present in one recognition, spontaneously perfect from the beginning.
