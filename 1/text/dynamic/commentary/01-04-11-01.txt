Nothing is established as objects. Through unestablished awareness and wisdom, beyond speech and thought—merely in ultimate truth, existing as the manner of illusion. The qualities of meditation and the ground (gzhi)s of the path. Through the result at the end, obtaining the wisdom of Buddha like illusion, from the nature (rang bzhin) of dharma-body, working benefit like illusion.

From the intermediate Prajñāpāramitā: "All phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion. Nirvāṇa is also like a dream, like an illusion. If something more excellent than nirvāṇa exists, that also is like a dream, like an illusion."

All phenomena are merely various objects and consciousness. Nirvāṇa attains form-body and works benefit. Therefore, the excellent dharma is one's own self-aware suchness and the supreme dharma-body.

An old traveler. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The Mind-Only school would say the dream-mind was real. The Autonomous Middle-Way school says even the mind is like the dream—appearing, functioning, yet without essence.

All phenomena like dream, like illusion. Even the wisdom that knows this—like dream, like illusion. Even nirvāṇa! What remains?

[3049-3061]
The dream metaphor—not merely metaphor. Dream and waking equally unestablished. The dream horse, the waking horse—both have no essence.

Nirvāṇa itself—like a dream, like an illusion. If something excels nirvāṇa, even that. No refuge in existence, no refuge in peace. The middle way is not a path between extremes—it is the exhaustion of extremes themselves.

Cut! The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

Logical necessity: if the path leads to ground, and ground is primordial, then path was always ground. Non-dual.

In ultimate truth, not even illusion abides! No objects! No aspects! Even self-aware experience does not exist! Like a barren woman's son—no meeting consciousness!

Conventional truth not true—ultimate truth non-abiding! When awakening from dream, horse and ox appearance stops!

Liberate!

See what is. Rest in recognition. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Thus. The analysis dissolves the analyzer. Categories collapse into recognition.

Thus. The structure reveals what transcends structure. Complete from the beginning. No opening necessary.

All phenomena like dream. Like illusion. Nirvāṇa too. If something more excellent—that too.

Where is the dreamer when the dream is known? Where the knower?
