Nothing is established as objects. Through unestablished awareness and wisdom, beyond speech and thought—merely in ultimate truth, existing as the manner of illusion. The qualities of meditation and the ground (gzhi)s of the path. Through the result at the end, obtaining the wisdom of Buddha like illusion, from the nature (rang bzhin) of dharma-body, working benefit like illusion.

From the intermediate Prajñāpāramitā: "All phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion. Nirvāṇa is also like a dream, like an illusion. If something more excellent than nirvāṇa exists, that also is like a dream, like an illusion."

All phenomena are merely various objects and consciousness. Nirvāṇa attains form-body and works benefit. Therefore, the excellent dharma is one's own self-aware suchness and the supreme dharma-body.

The dream metaphor—not merely metaphor. Dream and waking equally unestablished. The dream horse, the waking horse—both have no essence.

What is called delusion here is wisdom appearing as confusion wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Yet the dream horse carries the dreamer. The waking horse carries the walker.

Nirvāṇa itself—like a dream, like an illusion. If something excels nirvāṇa, even that. No refuge in existence, no refuge in peace. The middle way is not a path between extremes—it is the exhaustion of extremes themselves.

An old traveler. The hindrance liberates itself when made the path—gegs lam du khyer.

Grasping at meaning liberates itself when seen.

Recognition dawns in the gaps—the intervals between.

The Mind-Only school would say the dream-mind was real. The Autonomous Middle-Way school says even the mind is like the dream—appearing, functioning, yet without essence.

All phenomena like dream, like illusion. Even the wisdom that knows this—like dream, like illusion. Even nirvāṇa! What remains?

See what is. Dwell in that seeing. Not elsewhere: the nature is here—it is this very awareness.

The separator melts—seeing this is the teaching.

Opening what was never shut—entire from the origin.

All phenomena like dream. Like illusion. Nirvāṇa too. If something more excellent—that too.

Where is the dreamer when the dream is known? Where the knower?

Cut! Never hidden, the treasury shows itself, only overlooked.

Destination is departure point.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

In ultimate truth, not even illusion abides! No objects! No aspects! Even self-aware experience does not exist! Like a barren woman's son—no meeting consciousness!

Conventional truth not true—ultimate truth non-abiding! When awakening from dream, horse and ox appearance stops!

Liberate!

SUDDEN. The Consequentialist arises. The treasure was always in the open, only overlooked.

Understanding misses it; recognition sees what concepts cannot hold.

Recognition in the interval—between this thought and the next.

The Autonomous Middle Way asserts illusion-like nature. The Consequentialist goes beyond—not even illusion remains. Like a thunderclap clearing the sky.

Beyond all assertions. Beyond all positions. This is the summit.

Like a dream within a dream—the Autonomous school wakes from Mind-Only, sees the dream. The Consequentialist wakes from the waking—sees even waking is dream.

Barren woman's son—no son exists to seek. No seeker either.
 Immediate: the nature is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.
