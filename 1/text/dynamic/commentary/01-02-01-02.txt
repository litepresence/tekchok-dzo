[892-897]
Therefore. Thus. The structure unfolds with precision. Crescent to the east, trapezoid south, circle west, square north. Each dimension enumerated like jewels on a string. This is not geography—this is the architecture of perception itself. The Yoke-holder mountain stands as tall as the iron rim is wide. Space folds according to laws we did not make and cannot break.

[898-903]
This old practitioner once walked the length of Jambudvīpa, or so I thought. My feet grew blisters while the continent remained untouched. Two thousand yojanas on the long sides—the numbers mock our small journeys. Videha and Deha support like hands cupping water. What water? The water that reflects the moon that was never in the sky.

[904-909]
Godānīya circular—seven thousand five hundred yojanas of completion. The western mind seeks wholeness, finds itself in circles. Uttarakuru square to the north, two thousand on each side. Stability. Earth-element. The four shapes map not lands but modes of knowing. Crescent like the mind reaching outward. Square like the mind at rest.

[910-915]

[916-925]
Between these continents, beings without number. Below Ti Se, twenty thousand yojanas down—the hot hells and cold. Yama-soothed, Bubble-possessing. Names like wounds. The occasional hells scattered like seeds in wind, taking root where conditions meet. This is not punishment. This is the landscape of cause meeting effect without mercy or cruelty.

[926-940]
Pretas below the capital, five hundred leagues passed. Their root place hidden, branches reaching into our world. Like hunger that starts in the gut and climbs into the mind. Seven mother-goddesses paralyze action, send disease and famine. Not malevolent—merely showing us what we have sown. The asuras in Meru's hollow, rich with splendor, competing with gods. Envy is their nectar.

[941-950]
Eight lakes, eight naga kings. Joyful, Near-joyful, Horse-basis, Releasing-holding. They control the rain—great and small—on Jambudvīpa. When drought comes, do not blame the nagas. Look to your own mind's parched places. Splendor, Land-guarding, Great-black, E la leaves. Jeweled palaces beneath the surface we cannot see.

[951-970]
Four yaksha kings at Meru's corners control the seasons. Summer rain, autumn grain, flowers ripening, winter cold turning spring warm. The wind goddesses move through this, most elevated of common beings. Existence-action beings. Formed with the world, destroyed with the world, living one eon. Their stability mocks our frantic hours.

[971-996]
The asura city Golden-Possessing, built of jewels, gardens of perfect joy. Indra's palace, assembly-place of good wealth. Trees, horses, elephants, clothes, nectar—countless enjoyments. Yet they fight the gods. Paradise is not peace. The four tiers above, each with its gods. First tier: those holding screens. The veil thinly drawn between what we see and what is.

[892-892]
An old yogi once meditated on Mount Meru's shape for three years. He could not understand why the measurements mattered. Then one morning, watching his breath, he saw: the mountain is the body. The tiers are the chakras. The gods are the elements. The cosmology describes not outer space but inner space.

[892-892]
See what is. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[892-892]
Therefore. Thus. The continents neither exist nor do not exist. They appear as they appear. The one who sees them, the seeing itself, and what is seen—all are spontaneously accomplished. Rest in that recognition. Go beyond the geography.

[892-892]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. Do not search for Meru on any map. Do not seek the four continents in any atlas. They are here. They are now. Recognition is the only geography that matters. The rest is display.

[892-892]
This old practitioner has nothing more to say about continents. The earth speaks. The sky speaks. Everything is teaching. Everything is recognition. Go. Recognize. Rest.
