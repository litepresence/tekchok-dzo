Therefore, thus, the structure unfolds. Crescent to the east, trapezoid south, circle west, square north. Each dimension enumerated. This is not geography—this is the architecture of perception itself. The Yoke-holder mountain stands as tall as the iron rim is wide. Space folds according to laws we did not make and cannot break.

Four continents: crescent, trapezoid, circle, square. East, south, west, north. The shapes are not shapes—they are modes of knowing. Crescent like the mind reaching outward. Trapezoid like the mind expanding. Circle like the mind returning. Square like the mind at rest. Four shapes, four directions, four modes of awareness.

One word: Now. Don't look for these continents on any map. They are the four directions of your own mind. The shape is the shape of awareness.

Jambudvipa—the continent of Jambu. Two thousand yojanas on the long sides. Videha and Deha support like hands cupping water. The southern continent Videha—body, form, the world of form. The northern continent Deha—formless, the world beyond form.

This old man walked Jambudvipa with blistered feet. Two thousand yojanas—the continent never changed. The feet blistered, the continent remained. The lesson: the world doesn't change when you walk it. The walker changes, or doesn't.

Godaniya—circular, western continent. Seven thousand five hundred yojanas of completion. The western mind seeks wholeness, finds itself in circles. Uttarakuru—square, northern continent. Two thousand yojanas each side. Stability, earth-element. Four shapes map not lands but modes of knowing.

Four continents, four shapes, four wisdoms. Crescent—discriminating wisdom. Trapezoid—all-accomplishing wisdom. Circle—equality wisdom. Square—mirror-like wisdom. The continents are not places—they are the four wisdoms appearing as worlds.

Between these continents, beings without number. Below Mount Meru, twenty thousand yojanas down—the hot hells and cold hells. Yama's realm. Names like wounds: Reviving, Hot, Utterly Hot—eight hot hells. Cold: Black, Exceeding Black, Black Rims—eight cold hells. The hells are not punishment—they are cause and effect meeting without mercy or cruelty.

Look at the hells. Hot and cold. Are they somewhere else? The hot hell is the burning of anger. The cold hell is the freezing of hatred. The hells are not below—they are within. The twenty thousand yojanas is the depth of affliction.

Pretas—hungry ghosts. Below the human realm, five hundred leagues down. Their roots hidden, branches reaching into our world. Hunger that starts in the gut, climbs into the mind. Seven mother-goddesses paralyze action, send disease and famine. Not malevolent—showing what we have sown.

The hungry ghosts—expanded bellies, thin throats. Their hunger is endless. The food they see becomes pus, fire, blood. This is the hunger of craving. Not enough, never enough. The pretas are not below—they are the grasping mind.

Asuras—fighting spirits. In Meru's hollow, rich with splendor, competing with gods. Envy is their nectar. The asura realm is the realm of rivalry, competition, jealousy. The gods fight each other. Paradise is not peace.

The asuras fight the gods. The gods enjoy pleasures, the asuras fight for them. The fighting never ends. This is samsara—not peace but conflict. Even in paradise, there is war.

Eight lakes, eight naga kings. Joyful, Near-joyful, Horse-basis, Releasing-holding. They control the rain—great and small—on Jambudvipa. When drought comes, don't blame the nagas. Look to your own mind's parched places.

The naga kings beneath the lakes. They control the rains. When the rains fail, we blame the nagas. But the rain depends on conditions—the nagas are not the cause. They are the display of cause meeting effect.

Four yaksha kings at Meru's corners control the seasons. Summer rain, autumn grain, flowers ripening, winter cold, spring warmth. The wind goddesses move through all—this is the most elevated of common beings. Existence-action beings, formed with the world, destroyed with the world, living one eon.

The seasons turn. Summer, autumn, winter, spring. The yaksha kings control them. But who controls the kings? The karma of beings controls the seasons. The seasons are not external—they are the display of collective karma.

The asura city Golden-Possessing, built of jewels, gardens of perfect joy. Indra's palace, assembly-place of good wealth. Trees, horses, elephants, clothes, nectar—countless enjoyments. Yet they fight the gods. Paradise is not peace. The four tiers above, each with its gods. First tier: those holding screens—the veil between seen and seeing.

The asuras live in paradise but fight the gods. Paradise is not peace. The gods enjoy pleasures, the asuras fight for them. This is samsara—even paradise has conflict. The four tiers of heavens: desire realm, form realm, formless realm. All temporary, all fleeting.

Mount Meru—the world axis. Four facets, golden color. Rising from the ocean, surrounded by sun and moon. The mountain of the world. The axis around which existence turns. The center of the cosmos, the center of awareness.

Three words that liberate: Recognize primordial awareness. Rest without distraction. Return whenever lost. Don't look for Meru on any map. It's the axis of your own awareness. The center around which all appearances turn. The mountain of the world is the mountain of mind.

The cosmology of the world is the cosmology of mind. The continents are the directions of awareness. The hells are the fires of affliction. The pretas are the hunger of craving. The asuras are the conflict of rivalry. The gods are the pleasures of samadhi. All are mind. All are display.

This old man meditated on Mount Meru's shape for years. Then one morning, watching breath: the mountain is the body, the tiers are the chakras, the gods are the elements. Not geography—physiology. Not outer—inner.

[Final] The four continents—crescent, trapezoid, circle, square. East, south, west, north. Jambudvipa, Godaniya, Videha, Uttarakuru. Four shapes, four wisdoms, four modes of awareness. The hells below—hot and cold—eight each. The pretas—hungry ghosts. The asuras—fighting spirits. The gods—pleasure realms. All are mind. All are display. The cosmology describes not outer space but inner space. The geography is the geography of awareness. The continents are not places—they are the four wisdoms. The hells are not below—they are within. The cosmology is the map of mind. Recognize this and the map dissolves into the territory. The structure of the world is the structure of awareness. Crescent to the east—the mind reaching outward. Trapezoid to the south—the mind expanding. Circle to the west—the mind returning to wholeness. Square to the north—the mind stable, at rest. The Yoke-holder mountain rises at the center. The sun and moon orbit around it. This is not geography—it is the architecture of perception itself. The mountain is the axis around which appearances turn. The axis is awareness. The turning is the display. The four continents are four ways awareness appears: as form, as feeling, as perception, as consciousness. The hells are the fire of anger, the ice of hatred. The pretas are the hunger of craving. The asuras are the war of jealousy. The gods are the pleasure of attachment. All six realms are the six ways awareness appears to itself. Recognize this and samsara becomes nirvana. The map dissolves into the territory. The territory is awareness itself.

Emaho! The four continents! The hells and heavens! The mind's display!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
