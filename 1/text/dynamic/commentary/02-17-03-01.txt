[1-13] First, the yogin who progressively conducts—four aspects: vision controlling conduct, appearance fixation method, appearance existence as basis, afflictions transformed. First: three aspects—general conduct essence, secret supreme conduct, seizing time.

[-20405--20393] Three words. Conduct. Control. Stop. You think conduct controls vision. The fixation method is not a technique—it is recognition that fixation and liberator are one.

[1-13] Practitioners try to control visions! "I will only see deities!" The control is the obstacle. Conduct is natural expression of recognition.

[-20405--20393] Conduct of controlling vision is the consort's dance—wild, uncontrolled. The appearance fixation method is bindu at the heart—pressing, releasing, recognizing.

[1-13] Three conducts: non-attachment holding, denial-assertion without, attachment without fixation. Three gates to the same recognition.

[-20395--20393] One recognition, three expressions. Non-attachment is essence, denial-assertion is nature, without fixation is compassion.

[1-13] CONTROL! FIXATION! No method to destroy! Conduct is already complete!

[Final] Conduct is not something to do—it is expression of what you already are. Control through non-control. Fixation through non-fixation.

Emaho! The conduct of natural spontaneity!

See what is. Rest in recognition.
