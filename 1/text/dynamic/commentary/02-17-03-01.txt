[2051-2063] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, conduct continuously doing yogi: four aspects. Vision controlling conduct, that instruction appearance fixation method, from that appearance existence basis arising intention, afflictions basis transforming result. First: three aspects—conduct general nature brief showing, secret supreme conduct definitely explained, sequence definite conduct time holding.

[2051-2063] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Conduct. Control. Stop. You think conduct controls vision. Vision controls you. The fixation method is not a technique. It is the recognition that fixation and liberator are one. Stop trying to control. Start recognizing.

[2051-2063] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man has seen practitioners try to control their visions! "I will only see deities! No demons!" Hah! The control is the demon. The wanting is the obstacle. Conduct is not control. Conduct is the natural expression of recognition.

[2051-2063] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The conduct of controlling vision is the consort's dance—wild, uncontrolled, perfect. You try to lead; she leads. You try to follow; she follows. The appearance fixation method is the bindu at the heart—pressing, releasing, recognizing.

[2051-2063] Voice 17 (Singing Yogi): I once tried to control my songs. Make them perfect, make them spiritual. They died. When I let them come wild and raw, they lived. Vision control is like that—let them arise, let them liberate. The control is in the letting go.

[2061-2063] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First also: non-attachment possessing conduct, denial-assertion without conduct, attachment without fixation conduct—three. Non-attachment: not grasping at appearances as real. Denial-assertion without: not saying "this is" or "this isn't." Attachment without fixation: engaging without clinging. Three gates to the same recognition.

[2061-2063] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Three. Conducts. Stop. You think three different practices. One recognition, three expressions. Non-attachment is the essence. Without denial-assertion is the nature. Without fixation is the compassion. Three words for rigpa's play.

[2061-2063] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): CONTROL! FIXATION! speaks with fierce compassion I will destroy these methods! But look—no method to destroy! The conduct is already complete! The vision already controlled! The fixation already liberated! SEE THIS!

[Final] Conduct is not something to do. It is the expression of what you already are. Control through non-control. Fixation through non-fixation. The method is the recognition that there is no method.

Emaho! The conduct of natural spontaneity!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
