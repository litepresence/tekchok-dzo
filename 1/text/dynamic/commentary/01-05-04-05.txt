Sixth field—thousand light-rays' rim-protector. Mu khyud mgon—guardian
of boundaries, protector at the edge. Not keeping things out, but the
nature of light itself where center and edge are one.

[1-1]
This practitioner once sought the center of awareness. Sat at edges, found
center everywhere. The rim-protector guards by dissolving rim. Light-rays
from a thousand lamps—each ray has edge, yet all illuminate the same space.

[1-1]
Thousand light-rays—not quantity but completeness. Every possible angle
of illumination, every way awareness can know itself. The rim is not a
limitation but a display of infinite reach.

[1-1]
Rays illuminate. Rim dissolves. Rest remains. Three words, but the rim
was never real—just light appearing to have edge.

[1-1]
See your face. Where is the rim of your awareness? Find the edge, and you
find it includes everything. This is the sixth field's protection—complete
inclusion, nothing excluded.
