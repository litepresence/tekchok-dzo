[6423]
Sixth: thousand light-rays' rim-protector. Light radiating in all directions, each ray a complete teaching, each teaching reaching all who have eyes to see. The rim is not a boundary. It is the place where center recognizes itself as everywhere. The protector guards the light by being the light. Nothing can extinguish what has no source. Nothing can hide what illuminates itself.

[6424-6430]
An old practitioner once sat at the rim of light, where all rays converge. He expected to find the center there. Instead, he found every ray pointing back to where he sat.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching. The center was everywhere. The rim was everywhere. The protector was not guarding the light. The protector was the light recognizing itself.

[6431-6440]
See your own face. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[6441-6450]
Consequently. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[6451-6460]
Between the light-rays and the recognition that transcends all direction, the treasury continues. Not rejecting the illumination. Not grasping it. The light points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6461-6470]
This fool. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[6471-6480]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what binds The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness. Recognition is immediate.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[6481-6490]
Thus established. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[6491-6500]
Stop searching. Start seeing. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[6501-6510]
An old practitioner once asked: "Where is the source of light?" The answer came like dawn: nowhere. There was never any source. The rays were never emitted. The illumination was never created. All was awareness, playing at being light and dark.

[6511-6520]
The framework reveals. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[6521-6530]
Recognition is immediate. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[6531-6540]
A simple monk. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[Final] Three words complete.
The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness. The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
