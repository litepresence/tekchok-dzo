First: Because unceasing display of recognition exists as depth-clarity within primordial purity, awareness of primordial purity in non-duality is not established as thing or mark.

Natural expression of self-abiding rigpa dwells as clarity of subtle inner recognition. The essence of appearance is empty, the nature of emptiness dwells clear—the heart of awareness is form and pristine cognition, primordially without gathering or separation, resting like the heart of the sun.

**Three Canonical Citations:**
- **Rangshar:** "The basis has two aspects: the basis of great primordial purity, and the basis of variegated unceasing display."
- **Klong drug pa:** "The essence itself is primordially pure; the nature is spontaneously accomplished."
- **Mu tig phreng ba:** "The essence is primordially pure, free from basis of expression; the nature is spontaneously present, complete in whatever appears."

The essence (primordial purity) and nature (spontaneous presence) are non-dual—not two, not one. Like water and wetness, mirror and reflection.

Between preparation and ripeness, recognition is immediate. Spacious knowing without stages.

The text translates what was never foreign. Completion before language.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

I have memorized all distinctions. Then I forgot: who was memorizing? The library dissolves into spaciousness.
