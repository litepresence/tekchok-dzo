First: Because unceasing display of recognition exists as depth-clarity within primordial purity, awareness of primordial purity in non-duality is not established as thing or mark.

Natural expression of self-abiding rigpa dwells as clarity of subtle inner recognition. The essence of appearance is empty, the nature of emptiness dwells clear—the heart of awareness is form and pristine cognition, primordially without gathering or separation, resting like the heart of the sun.

**Three Canonical Citations:**
- **Rangshar:** "The basis has two aspects: the basis of great primordial purity.
the basis of variegated unceasing display."
- **Klong drug pa:** "The essence itself is primordially pure; the nature is spontaneously accomplished."
- **Mu tig phreng ba:** "The essence is primordially pure, free from basis of expression; the nature is spontaneously present, complete in whatever appears."

The essence (primordial purity) and nature (spontaneous presence) are non-dual—not two, not one. Like water and wetness, mirror and reflection.

Second: Abandoning disputes regarding this recognition—conceptual enumeration vs direct recognition of one's own face.

The liberating recognition is instant (cig car ba), never gradual.

The mind that would understand is what must be recognized.

No key needed for an unlocked door—done without doing.

Transforming difficulties into practice—obstacles serve the path.

The judge is judged—seeing this is the teaching.
