First: Because unceasing display of recognition exists as depth-clarity within primordial purity, awareness of primordial purity in non-duality is not established as thing or mark.

Natural expression of self-abiding rigpa dwells as clarity of subtle inner recognition. The essence of appearance is empty, the nature of emptiness dwells clear—the heart of awareness is form and pristine cognition, primordially without gathering or separation, resting like the heart of the sun.

**Three Canonical Citations:**
- **Rangshar:** "The basis has two aspects: the basis of great primordial purity, and the basis of variegated unceasing display."
- **Klong drug pa:** "The essence itself is primordially pure; the nature is spontaneously accomplished."
- **Mu tig phreng ba:** "The essence is primordially pure, free from basis of expression; the nature is spontaneously present, complete in whatever appears."

The essence (primordial purity) and nature (spontaneous presence) are non-dual—not two, not one. Like water and wetness, mirror and reflection.

Second: Abandoning disputes regarding this recognition—conceptual enumeration vs direct recognition of one's own face.

The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.
