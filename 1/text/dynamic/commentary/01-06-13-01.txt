Five perfections. Field and emanation, two—making eight.

 These are the results of the eight empowerments.

Listen, dear practitioner! Perfection is not something you achieve—it is what you recognize. Five perfections, eight results—all are already present in your own mind.

The emanation body's teacher, sixth Vajradhara. Abode is Tushita—"Ogmin," different in name only. Teaching is nature Great Perfection. Retinue is worldly and transcendental. Time is when the form-body tames. Field is vast Brahma. From that, emerging clearly: the four continents with Meru, a hundred variations. Dharma taught: actual and reflected images. As what tames whom through emanation—emanation body's self and other's benefit, two perfections, activity, and eight.

[9531-9537]
The nature body's teacher: inexpressible, utterly pure. Abode: inexpressible, sign and basis free. Teaching: dust-free, stainless. Retinue: wisdom ocean. Field: great bliss, pure. Dharma: no discrimination. Activity: mind itself transcends mistake—eight.

[9538-9546]
The nature of all these, four authentic bodies: The dharmakaya's teacher: nature unaltered. Abode: emptiness, all-pervasive. Teaching: pure taming conduct. Retinue: nature pure. Time: indefinite, various. Dharma: contaminated self-depleted. Through dharma-aggregates gathering—dharmakaya. Activity: acts without self-agent—eight.

[9547-9555]
The form-body's teacher: form-appearance without nature, face completely open. Abode: no outer or inner, everywhere inside. Teaching: distinguishes dharma and non-dharma. Retinue: visible and invisible. Time: four concepts, mere words. Field: looking from outside, clear inside. Dharma: concepts basis pure. Through purifying form-atoms and particles—form body. Depleting the karma of those with karma-form—eight.

[1] Incidentally, the peace body's teacher: self-knowing awareness king, unconditioned, abode citta jewel palace.

Emaho! The kayas are not somewhere else—they are your own body, speech, and mind when recognized!

[9556-9562]

[9563-9567]
Dharma? Samsara and nirvana—where do you think they are? Activity? Through relying on this, body and mind's suffering pacifies itself—thus called peace body. Liberating from three realms? Eight aspects, but they're all the same liberation wearing different masks!

Tamed prajna's seeing purification's six wisdoms arisen—all words' sign-meaning understood! Trained prajna's seeing purification's six clairvoyances—mind itself enters dharmata specially born!

Then wisdom's seeing purification's six clairvoyances appear—at this time, wisdom's eye dust-free and stainless found!

Conceptual pure hundred eighty transformation-basis meaning knowing! Wisdom pure and experiencing pure hundred eighty nature knowing! Contact pure hundred eighty text knowing! Three sets very elaboration-without empowerment arise!

Dharmas pure clairvoyances hundred eighty completely elaboration-without empowerment arise! Thus ground joined, ground's virtues two thousand three hundred sixty, wisdom's activity six hundred sixty, dharmas' enumerations three thousand one hundred twenty, Vajradhara's ground clairvoyance's display division great! These empowerment's arrangement, secret mantra vajra vehicle's dharma door first basis important indeed!

Now the practitioner must understand: these elaborate numbers are not to be feared. They describe the completeness of enlightenment. The thirty-two marks, the eighty great marks, the thousand Buddha-fields—all are the display of awareness. When recognized, these numbers are not obstacles but manifestations of wisdom.

The empowerments are not ceremonies performed outside. They are the recognition of what is already present. The empowerment arrangement is the secret mantra vajra vehicle's dharma door, the first basis. The unsurpassed secret mantra door is all samaya, important. Establishing three: samaya's nature is general, body speech mind's samaya is particular, unsurpassed samaya is supreme. First samaya's essence, definitive term, division, basis, benefit, fault.

During my wandering years... says: the elaborate system exists for those who need it. For the highest practitioners, one recognition suffices. The numbers describe what happens when recognition dawns. When the five wisdoms arise, they manifest as the five Buddha families. When the kayas appear, they are your own body, speech, mind recognized. The wrathful and peaceful aspects are not two—they are the same wisdom, appearing differently according to the needs of the moment.

The clairvoyances are not supernatural powers to be attained. They are the natural abilities of awareness when obscuration is removed. When the eye of wisdom becomes stainless, you see all Buddha bodies. When the ear of wisdom becomes pure, you hear all sounds as dharma. When the mind of wisdom becomes clear, you know all others' minds. These are not achievements—they are revelations. The practitioner does not gain something new but reveals what was always present.

Thus, dear one, the elaborate enumeration of three thousand one hundred twenty is your own face. The kayas are not outside—they are your own body when recognized. The wrathful deities are not frightening—they are your own awareness, wild and free. The peaceful deities are not to be grasped—they are your own wisdom, naturally at rest. Rest in that recognition, and all these elaborate manifestations arise from that rest and dissolve back into that rest.

Now I will explain in more detail the nature of the empowerments and their results. The teaching divides into five sections: first, the five perfections with field and emanation making eight. Second, the four authentic bodies. Third, the peace body and wrathful body. Fourth, the thirty-two marks from thirty-two empowerments. Fifth, the hundred eighty clairvoyances.

Each empowerment opens a door. Each door reveals an aspect of wisdom. The thirty-two empowerments transform into thirty-two marks of a Buddha. These are not external marks painted on a body—they are the qualities of awareness manifesting. When you recognize mind's nature, these qualities appear naturally. They are not achieved through effort but revealed through recognition.

The six clairvoyances that arise from prajna's purification: the divine eye sees all forms throughout all Buddha-fields. The divine ear hears all sounds throughout all worlds. The knowledge of others' minds knows all thoughts of all beings. The memory of past lives recalls all previous existences. The divine sight sees all things as they truly are. The exhaustion of contaminants sees the path to liberation clearly.

These six are not supernatural abilities attained through practice. They are the natural clarity of awareness when not obscured by conceptuality. The practitioner does not develop them—they are uncovered. Like the sun appearing when clouds disperse. The clouds are the three poisons, the concepts, the grasping at self. When these clear, the six clairvoyances shine naturally.

The transformation of the thirty-two empowerments produces thirty virtues. These are not moral virtues in the ordinary sense—they are the qualities of a Buddha's mind. The tamedprajas produce the virtue of all-understanding. The trained prajas produce the virtue of direct realization. The applied prajas produce the virtue of all-knowing speech. The conceptual prajas produce the virtue of understanding all dharmas. The meditation-born prajas produce the virtue of like-space awareness.

The wisdom clairvoyances: mirror-like wisdom sees all phenomena without distortion. Equality wisdom sees samsara and nirvana as non-dual. Discriminating wisdom knows the specific faculties of all beings. All-accomplishing wisdom accomplishes all purposes without effort. Dharmadhatu wisdom knows all Buddha virtues. Non-abiding wisdom knows freedom from all fixation.

These thirty-six wisdom clairvoyances arise from the thirty-two empowerments. They are not separate achievements but aspects of the one wisdom. Like the one sun appearing through different windows. The wisdom is one, its aspects are many.

The thirty clairvoyances from the liberation of outflows: when body outflows exhaust, the practitioner sees all bodies as empty. When speech outflows exhaust, the practitioner hears all sounds as mantra. When mind outflows exhaust, the practitioner knows all thoughts as wisdom. When consciousness outflows exhaust, the practitioner sees all appearances as display. When prajna outflows exhaust, the practitioner knows all dharmas as empty. When dharmata outflows exhaust, the practitioner rests in non-dual awareness.

The thirty clairvoyances from the karma manifest: these perfect the Buddha's knowing. The actual body's six see all Buddha bodies. The body-appearance's six enjoy infinite light. The actual speech's six enjoy sixty speech-tones. The speech-appearance's six enjoy various sounds. The actual mind's six enjoy all samadhis. The mind-appearance's six enjoy knowing others' minds.

The dharmata's six clairvoyances reveal the non-division of awareness and appearance. One hundred eighty clairvoyances in total—all are your own face!

The elaboration-having empowerment multiplies into hundred eighty. The elaboration-without empowerment transforms conceptual, wisdom, and contact aspects into hundred eighty. The very elaboration-without produces three sets of hundred eighty. The utterly elaboration-without produces dharma-pure hundred eighty.

Thus the ground joins with three thousand one hundred twenty virtues. This is the display of Vajradhara's ground clairvoyance. The empowerment arrangement is the secret mantra vajra vehicle's first basis.

The samaya: the samaya's nature is general—the commitment to view and meditation. Body, speech, mind's samaya is particular—the pledges of each level. The unsurpassed samaya is supreme—the commitment to A simple practitioner...ld wanderer has traveled these paths. I have seen the peaceful deities in vision, the wrathful blazing in my mind. I have counted the marks, cataloged the clairvoyances, mapped the empowerments. Then I saw: all of these were my own mind playing with itself. The map is not the territory. The A signpost points north—the wood is not the destination. is not the moon. Rest in that recognition, and the elaborate system becomes a support, not a chain.
