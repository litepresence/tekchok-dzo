[1-498]
Inner-clear existing carries to exhaustion ground, primordial person's universal base self-arisen essence body inseparable. Recognition is immediate.

See. Decide. Continue.

[1-498]
Yet like sun obscured by clouds, liberation recognizing own face, freed from all obscurations, realization manifest, original base and final liberation ground extremely different—this essential point wise ones should know.

Wisdom expanse swirling like crystal light, dharmakaya clear dawning like crystal itself. That self-recognized dharmakaya abiding in own bed, now wishing to hold unconfused ground, naturally clear directly zangthal great expanse clarity hrik freshness non-distracted sustaining is essential.

From Protector of Beings Glorious Sublime Lama's mouth: "Self-recognized dharmakaya own bed itself, wishing to hold unconfused ground whoever exists, all without error unconfused non-distracting doing is key, knowing like ocean meditation wise ones should know."

A hilltop meditator... wandered for years seeking the "introduction." He met masters who gestured, who spoke, who demonstrated with crystals and mirrors. Finally, sitting by a high plateau lake at dawn, he saw his own face in the still water. "Oh," he said, "this is the introduction." The lake had been showing him all along.

[1-498]
Thus well spoken. At this introduction time, relaxed, self also newly certain uncommon produced, showing others. Again World Sun Dharma Lord Lama's mouth: "Introductions gradually introduced, well cared for. Alala, Olala, what is this without parts? Not introduced, not unintroduced, don't do, non-dharma action don't claim. Don't cling to delusion, don't hold lama's name doing non-dharma bad actions, name meaning must accord."

Thus advised, future times entering this dharma should place thus in heart.

Mountain hermit watched clouds form and dissolve in the valley below his cave. Each morning, new shapes. Each evening, gone. The introduction is like this—not something you keep, but something you meet fresh each time. Don't try to hold yesterday's introduction. Meet today's.

[1-498]
Second point particular differentiation explaining sentient beings and wisdom's symbols extensively in two: root rigpa's deluded returning mode mind's introduction, and rigpa self-display possessing self-display wisdom introduction.

First: from Introduction Ornament—"Emaho! Appearance as mind introduction, mind's arriving mode. Mind itself empty introduction, emptiness bliss expansion reached. Empty as rigpa introduction, rigpa itself expanse wisdom non-dual."

Here three: outer object key point establishing inner mind, inner mind key point establishing secret expanse, secret expanse key point establishing unsurpassed rigpa.

[1-498]
First has showing appearance object baseless delusion, and showing appearance holder own mind empty two.

First: outer various displays red-blue container-contained five elements' expanse clear, these to own mind deluded face appearing, except external objects' things and inner mind's things both unrealized, baseless empty miracle non-existent clear appearance nature, like cataract sufferer's hair-falls and dream magical display.

Emaho! The dream is not unreal—it is real as dream. The appearance is not nothing—it is the display of awareness. Don't make the mistake of denying appearance. Don't make the mistake of grasping it as external. This is the middle way of introduction.

[1-498]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why do all this analysis? The object is mind's display! The mind is rigpa's display! Rigpa is expanse's display! Stop dissecting and recognize!

Between the elaborate introductions and the direct pointing, we find the vast middle way. Use the twenty-one introductions if you need them. Skip them if you don't. What matters is recognition, not the method of introduction.

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you prepare the crystal, while you arrange the mirrors, maintain the recognition that this too is introduction. The preparation is introduction. The recognition is introduction. The daily life is introduction.

[1-498]
From that: "All buddhas' measure holder, example wisdoms examine. Sign wisdom measure holder, empty bindu lamp examine. Meaning wisdom measure holder, direct clear display examine."

Briefly summarized: outer display object baseless, holding that appearance mind empty introduction, samsara delusion certain non-existent one knowing, that insufficient, root rigpa's meaning direct introduction, expanse rigpa non-separation introduction, carry to kadag's dharmakaya—this advice for supreme excellent ones.

[1-498]
Second, self-display wisdom introduction has two: object faculties' differentiation and introduction sequence.

First: excellent middling lesser three faculties seven each makes twenty-one. These also wisdom, training, liberation different.

First excellent means wisdom and realization aspect. Differentiated seven: excellent's lesser, excellent's middling, excellent's excellent, excellent's supreme, excellent's best, excellent's peak, excellent's completion.

These established from easy realization self-display. Middling also seven: middling's lesser, middling's middling, middling's excellent, middling's supreme, middling's best, middling's peak, middling's completion.

[1-498]
Lesser also seven: lesser's lesser, lesser's middling, lesser's excellent, lesser's best, lesser's peak, lesser's peak held.

Second: thus twenty-one faculties arising, twenty-one introductions arise. These too each introduction has two: common differentiation and special showing method.

First: light and wisdom rigpa three, seven-group introduction: from Vajrasattva heart mirror tantra—"Rigpa strayed from base, entering path should know, example meaning introduction etc., twenty-one introductions should know."

This wandering yogi encountered a teacher who showed him twenty-one different introductions. "Which one is right?" he asked. The teacher laughed. "All are right. None are necessary. The introduction that works for you is the right one. But remember—they all point to the same recognition."

[1-498]
Snow or salt or ocean arisen crystal stainless, window light held, five colors light spontaneously arise. What are these? Blue, white, yellow, red, green.

Crystal one following person, own right eye right hand held, placed above eye, display seen. Left hand left eye close. This is example introduction. Meaning thus abides in own heart center. This is meaning introduction.

[1-498]
Sign own finger pressing eye, light bindu moon-eye-like arises. This sign introduction.

Dharmakaya introduction: face to sun mandala. Sambhogakaya introduction: thus-gone body painted cloth placed before self, crystal eye above placed, eye gazing at sky, sambhogakaya body with face ear seen. Similarly sambhogakaya pure land intermediate state arising know.

Nirmanakaya introduction: dharma-possessing marks appearing own rigpa's miracle know. Day own light-ray's heap know. This is mind's habitual patterns hollow not abandoned knowing. This is nirmanakaya introduction.

Channel root method appearance natural mode arising introduction. Thus seven aspects called light introduction.

[1-498]
What is wisdom introduction?

Dharmadhatu wisdom introduction examining metal bowl's essence: bowl well water-filled, clear showing mirror placed above eye, looking, bindu and atomic form arise. From that light and weapon-point-like radiate. This dharmadhatu wisdom introduction.

Mirror-like wisdom introduction: silver mirror two between mandala powder-drawn, edge near each side mirror one each placed. From that two displays arise.

Equality wisdom introduction: water moon determination. Discriminating wisdom introduction: butter lamp determination. Accomplishing wisdom introduction: crystal stainless determination. Non-abiding wisdom introduction: sky rainbow determination. Completely perfect wisdom introduction: cloudless sky determination. These seven wisdom introduction.

Essence holder's spacious instruction: rest in these introductions without grasping. The crystal shows you your nature. Don't become attached to the crystal. The mirror reflects your face. Don't mistake the mirror for your face.

[1-498]
Now showing rigpa's introduction: rigpa youth vase body introduction: white-clothed unstained person placed before self, jewel above eye placed, eye sky-raised looking, thus-gone peaceful body seen. This rigpa youth vase body introduction.

Rigpa youth hero powerful body introduction: black house black unstained black-clothed placed before, as above looking, thus-gone wrathful body seen.

Rigpa base-abiding introduction: clear ocean determination. Rigpa all-clear introduction: sun moon determination. Rigpa non-dual introduction: vase body determination.

Emaho!

[1-498]
Rigpa with stain introduction: sun moon cloud-covered like determination. Rigpa not abiding anywhere introduction: eye mid-space gazing know. Thus seven rigpa introduction.

Thus twenty-one completed, that person parinirvana time, rigpa from eye channel arising enters intermediate state's display.

Second point special showing method has two: introduction's summary brief showing, and nature extensive differentiation.

First: light and wisdom introduction seven establishes lesser faculties' certainty symbol. Body and thigle introduction seven establishes middling ones' light essence certainty. Rigpa and expanse introduction seven establishes excellent ones' certainty.

[1-498]
From Introduction Ornament: "Twenty-one gradually introduction, light and wisdom itself, introduction seven aspects, lesser seven liberated. Body and thigle itself too, introduction seven aspects, middling seven's meaning. Rigpa and expanse seven, excellent ones' meaning."

Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: twenty-one introductions? Seven lesser? Seven middling? Seven excellent? Meanwhile, recognition is available right now! Stop counting and see!

Final instruction: the introduction is not a destination to reach but a recognition that dawns. Whether you need twenty-one introductions or just one pointing, the result is the same—recognition of what was never absent. May all beings recognize their nature through whichever introduction suits their faculties.

[1-498]
COMPREHENSIVE EXPANSION - DEEPENING THE INTRODUCTION TEACHINGS:

The Weaver's Thread of Recognition:
Twenty-one threads, twenty-one colors, twenty-one textures—all woven into one
fabric of introduction. Each thread complete in itself. Each thread necessary
for someone. The excellent need seven threads of light. The middling need
seven threads of body. The lesser need seven threads of rigpa. All threads
lead to the same fabric. All introductions lead to the same recognition.

This old weaver once tried to use all twenty-one threads at once. The fabric
was tangled. Confused. Finally she chose one thread and wove it completely.
The fabric was perfect. One introduction thoroughly understood surpasses
twenty-one introductions superficially known.

[1-498]
The Hot Spring's Natural Introduction:
Water emerges, finds its level, rests naturally. No forcing. No directing. The
introduction is like this. Recognition emerges naturally when conditions are
ripe. The crystal introduction for those who need form. The mirror introduction
for those who need reflection. The sky introduction for those who need space.
All natural. All appropriate.

The practitioner who forces introduction is like one who tries to push water
uphill. Exhausting. Futile. The practitioner who waits for natural conditions
is like one who sits by the spring. When the water rises, it rises. When
recognition dawns, it dawns.

[1-498]
The Mani Wall's Built Recognition:
Stone by stone, the wall rises. Mantra by mantra, the blessing accumulates.
The introduction is like this. Not sudden. Not dramatic. Gradual. Each
introduction builds on the last. The lesser introductions prepare the ground.
The middling introductions plant the seed. The excellent introductions bring
the harvest.

But the wall is not the destination. The destination is what the wall points
to—Mount Kailash of recognition beyond. Don't stop at the wall. Climb the
mountain.

[1-498]
the crystal cave's Dark Introduction:
Enter the retreat cave at Chimphu of introduction. Leave the sunlight of ordinary perception.
At first, darkness. Then shapes emerge. Finally, clear vision without light.
The twenty-one introductions are like this—progressively revealing what was
always present but unseen.

The first seven introductions bring you to the retreat cave at Chimphu mouth. The second seven
bring you into the darkness. The final seven bring clear vision. But the
clear vision was always possible. The darkness was always light.

[1-498]
The Juniper Smoke's Rising Introduction:
Offer juniper to the fire of devotion. Watch the smoke of introduction rise
naturally, spreading blessing throughout space. No forcing. No directing. The
offerings are the twenty-one introductions. The fire is the guru's blessing.
The smoke is the recognition that spreads everywhere.

[1-498]
The Migration's Seasonal Introduction:
Birds migrate when conditions are right. Not too early. Not too late. The
introduction is like this. The lesser introductions in autumn—preparation,
gathering, storing. The middling introductions in winter—retreat, darkness,
potential. The excellent introductions in spring—emergence, growth, flowering.
All according to season. All according to faculty.

[1-498]
The Animal Tracks' Fading Introduction:
Tracks in snow—visible, clear, guiding. Then sun comes. Snow melts. Tracks
fade. Was the path less real because tracks faded? The introductions are like
these tracks. They guide while needed. They fade when their work is done. The
path remains. Recognition remains.

[1-498]
The Root System's Deep Introduction:
Roots reach down through soil layers—surface, subsoil, bedrock. The
introductions are like these layers. The outer introductions touch the surface.
The inner introductions reach deeper. The secret introductions touch bedrock—the
ground of recognition itself.

But the root doesn't know it's going through layers. It just grows toward water.
The practitioner doesn't need to know which introduction is which. Just practice.
Recognition comes naturally.

[1-498]
The Dzo's Patient Introduction:
Step by step, the dzo climbs. No rushing. No shortcuts. The twenty-one
introductions are like these steps. Each step necessary. Each step bringing
you closer. But the destination was never far. The journey makes you ready
to recognize what was always present.

[1-498]
The Celestial Burial's Ultimate Introduction:
Final offering. Complete giving. Total release. The ultimate introduction is
like this—not an addition but a complete giving up. All twenty-one
introductions exhausted. All methods exhausted. All grasping exhausted. What
remains? Recognition. Natural. Complete.

[1-498]
LONGCHENPA'S VAST SYNTHESIS:
The twenty-one introductions are skillful means, not ultimate truth. They serve
the purpose of leading beings to recognition according to their capacities. The
lesser faculties need more elaboration. The middling faculties need moderate
elaboration. The excellent faculties need minimal elaboration. But all reach
the same recognition.

The introduction is not something given from outside. It is the recognition of
what was always present. The guru doesn't give you recognition. The guru points
to what you already possess. The twenty-one ways of pointing are for different
types of mind.

[1-498]

[1-498]
THE INTEGRATOR'S SPACIOUS UNITY:
No conflict between the twenty-one introductions. No hierarchy. No superiority.
The first introduction is not inferior to the twenty-first. The last is not
superior to the first. All are equal doorways to the same recognition.

The practitioner who understands this doesn't chase after more elaborate
introductions. Doesn't despise simpler introductions. Uses what is appropriate.
Rests in recognition.

[1-498]
GARAB DORJE'S STARK POINTING:
Twenty-one introductions? Twenty-one delays! One recognition? One directness!
Why elaborate what is simple? Why multiply what is one? Cut through all twenty-
one! See your nature now! The introduction that matters is the one that works—
the one that leads to recognition. Everything else is elaboration.

[1-498]
PATRUL'S EARTHY LThis uneducated yogi... old fool collected introductions like a child collects stones! Twenty-one!
And I wanted twenty-two! Finally I sat by the lake and saw my face. One
introduction. Complete. All twenty-one in that one moment. The collection was
ridiculous. The seeing was complete.

[1-498]
THE SINGING YOGI'S DAILY INTRODUCTION:
While washing rice—introduction through water.
While sweeping floor—introduction through movement.
While greeting neighbor—introduction through connection.
Every moment is introduction. Every perception is pointing. Every day is
twenty-one introductions.

[1-498]
THE ESSENCE HOLDER'S SPACIOUS REST:
Beyond all twenty-one introductions. Beyond lesser, middling, excellent. Beyond
faculties and capacities. Rest in what is introduced. Rest in recognition.
The introductions are fingers. The recognition is the moon. Rest in the moon.

[1-498]
THE WANDERING GURU'S RADICAL SIMPLICITY:
Simple. Direct. See your nature. Rest. Twenty-one ways to say one thing.
Recognition is here. Now. What are you waiting for?

[1-498]
THE VISIONARY DEVOTEE'S LONGING:
How I pray for the perfect introduction! The one that will finally open my
eyes! But even this longing is introduction. The prayer is introduction. The
devotion is introduction. Complete.

[1-498]
THE LION-FACED DAKINI'S FIERCE COMPASSION:
Stop counting introductions! Stop comparing faculties! Cut through now!
Recognition doesn't wait for twenty-one steps! It is immediate! Total! Now!

[1-498]
THE SKY-DANCER'S PLAYFUL WISDOM:
Twenty-one dances, twenty-one gestures, twenty-one steps. All leading to the
same still point. Dance them all or dance none. The point remains. The
recognition remains. Play!

[1-498]
THE CONSORT'S INTIMATE INSTRUCTION:
Between you and introduction, let there be intimacy. Not grasping. Not rejecting.
Just meeting. The crystal shows you. The mirror reflects you. The sky contains
you. Intimate introduction. Complete meeting.

[1-498]
Gangri Tokar HERMIT'S CAVE WISDOM:
Twenty-one winters I sought the introduction. Twenty-one springs I thought I
found it. Finally, I stopped seeking. the crystal cave taught me. The silence taught
me. Nothing to introduce. Nothing to find. Complete.

[1-498]
THE ECHO'S RESPONSIVE TEACHING:
The introduction calls out. The recognition echoes back. Complete communication.
Complete response. No separation between caller and called. Between introducer
and introduced.

[1-498]
COMPREHENSIVE PRACTICAL APPLICATION:

The twenty-one introductions are not merely theoretical categories. They are
living practices for different types of practitioners.

The crystal introduction (light): For those who are visually oriented, who
understand through form and color, who need concrete symbols. Hold the crystal.
See the five lights. Recognize they are your own display.

The mirror introduction (body): For those who understand through reflection,
through relationship, through seeing themselves in others. Look in the mirror.
See your face. Recognize it is not separate from the face of all beings.

The sky introduction (rigpa): For those who are ready for direct pointing,
who can handle spaciousness without support, who don't need symbols. Look at
the sky. Recognize awareness is equally spacious.

Use the introduction that suits you. Practice it completely. Then let it go.
Move to the next if needed. Or rest in recognition if ready.

[1-498]
ULTIMATE RESTING PLACE:

Beyond all twenty-one introductions. Beyond lesser, middling, excellent. Beyond
all categories of faculties and capacities. There is recognition that needs no
introduction. Awareness that is never apart from itself. Rest in that.

The introductions are medicine. When the disease is cured, stop taking medicine.
When recognition is stable, no more introductions needed. Rest in natural
awareness.

This is the completion of the teaching on the twenty-one introductions.

[14151-End]
The commentary on the twenty-one introductions is now complete. Light
introductions, body introductions, rigpa introductions—all explained. The
lesser, middling, and excellent faculties—all honored. The recognition has been
pointed to from every angle.

May all beings find the introduction that suits their faculty. May all practice
diligently. May all recognize their nature beyond all introductions.

The Treasury of Supreme Vehicle is vast. The introductions are many. But the
recognition is one. Rest in that oneness.

Om ah hum. The completion. The perfection. The natural liberation.

In a freezing cave... has said everything about introductions. The teaching is
complete. The pointing is made. What remains is your recognition.

Look. See. Rest.

Complete.

Patrul Rinpoche's parting whisper: These twenty-one introductions are like twenty-one gates into the same courtyard. Some enter through the elaborate gate with carved dragons. Some through the simple wooden door. Some vault the wall directly. All arrive in the same garden. Don't mistake the gate for the garden. Enter, and forget which gate you used.
