Inner-clear existing carries to exhaustion ground, primordial person's universal base self-arisen essence body inseparable. Recognition is immediate.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. Emaho!

[9714-9733]
Yet like sun obscured by clouds, liberation recognizing own face, freed from all obscurations, realization manifest, original base and final liberation ground extremely different—this crucial point wise ones should know. Wisdom expanse swirling like crystal light, dharmakaya clear dawning like crystal itself. That self-recognized dharmakaya abiding in own bed, now wishing to hold unconfused ground, naturally clear directly zangthal great expanse clarity hrik freshness non-distracted sustaining is crucial. From Protector of Beings Glorious Sublime Lama's mouth: "Self-recognized dharmakaya own bed itself, wishing to hold unconfused ground whoever exists, all without error unconfused non-distracting doing is crucial, knowing like ocean meditation wise ones should know."

[9734-9756]
Thus well spoken. At this introduction time, relaxed, self also newly certain uncommon produced, showing others. Again World Sun Dharma Lord Lama's mouth: "Introductions gradually introduced, well cared for. Alala, Olala, what is this without parts? Not introduced, not unintroduced, don't do, non-dharma action don't claim. Don't cling to delusion, don't hold lama's name doing non-dharma bad actions, name meaning must accord."

[9757-9780]
Thus advised, future times entering this dharma should place thus in heart. Second point particular differentiation explaining sentient beings and wisdom's symbols extensively in two: root rigpa's deluded returning mode mind's introduction, and rigpa self-display possessing self-display wisdom introduction. First: from Introduction Ornament—"Emaho! Appearance as mind introduction, mind's arriving mode. Mind itself empty introduction, emptiness bliss expansion reached. Empty as rigpa introduction, rigpa itself expanse wisdom non-dual."

[9781-9806]
Here three: outer object key point establishing inner mind, inner mind key point establishing secret expanse, secret expanse key point establishing unsurpassed rigpa. First has showing appearance object baseless delusion, and showing appearance holder own mind empty two. First: outer various displays red-blue container-contained five elements' expanse clear, these to own mind deluded face appearing, except external objects' things and inner mind's things both unrealized, baseless empty miracle non-existent clear appearance nature, like cataract sufferer's hair-falls and dream magical display.

Emaho!

[9952-9972]
From that: "All buddhas' measure holder, example wisdoms examine. Sign wisdom measure holder, empty bindu lamp examine. Meaning wisdom measure holder, direct clear display examine." Briefly summarized: outer display object baseless, holding that appearance mind empty introduction, samsara delusion certain non-existent one knowing, that insufficient, root rigpa's meaning direct introduction, expanse rigpa non-separation introduction, carry to kadag's dharmakaya—this advice for supreme excellent ones.

[9973-9991]
Second, self-display wisdom introduction has two: object faculties' differentiation and introduction sequence. First: excellent middling lesser three faculties seven each makes twenty-one. These also wisdom, training, liberation different. First excellent means wisdom and realization aspect. Differentiated seven: excellent's lesser, excellent's middling, excellent's excellent, excellent's supreme, excellent's best, excellent's peak, excellent's completion.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. These established from easy realization self-display. Middling also seven: middling's lesser, middling's middling, middling's excellent, middling's supreme, middling's best, middling's peak, middling's completion.

[9973-10010]
! The self-light of wisdom appears as five lights moving from space - through this you are introduced to your own light!

From this arises outer-clear appearance as space-wisdom-display! Like a mirror and the five other examples - recognize your own appearances! The connecting thread-ray between, the three bodies connected as one, wisdom self-appearing from clear-appearance, the mother-child measure of awareness from colored dust, and the heart-interval appearance of wisdom from the human female - these seven introductions!

Second, look at the bindu and body introductions! In the bindu appears the five wisdoms' display, pure bindu-appearances arising as five. Through copper vessel essence, the bindu itself is introduced. Through cloth surface, wisdom's light appears!

Through swirling water, the intermediate state first-appearance is introduced! Through peacock mirror, the intention! Through stirred copper vessel, the nine-stacked bindu of great bliss Brahma's gate!

Dear practitioner, there are two bodies: Awareness Youth Vase Body and Youth Wrathful Frown-Possessing Body. These also are half-bodies, single self, collection mandala - being and being female, father-mother pair connected - thus seven!

Third, the awareness and space introductions! Awareness introduction has two: three bodies as inseparable, and father-mother mouth-joining emanation-proliferation. This is awareness ripened as body!

Emaho!

[9992-10016]
Thus lesser also seven: lesser's lesser, lesser's middling, lesser's excellent, lesser's best, lesser's peak, lesser's peak held. Second: thus twenty-one faculties arising, twenty-one introductions arise. These too each introduction has two: common differentiation and special showing method. First: light and wisdom rigpa three, seven-group introduction: from Vajrasattva heart mirror tantra—"Rigpa strayed from base, entering path should know, example meaning introduction etc., twenty-one introductions should know."

[10011-10110]
! Through wisdom wind-moved space-appearance, you are introduced! Through the five families' surface appearance, space wisdom is introduced!

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Like a net hanging half-way, the measureless palace is introduced! Through raising mirrors in the four window directions center and five, the five families' appearance light demonstrates the expanse body!

Like raising a flower cluster of five in a water-filled vessel, the expanse cluster is introduced - these seven! At introduction time, make offerings, arrange excellent materials, prepare clothing and dwelling!

The Introduction Ornament Tantra says: Look at your own nature, suitable vessel disciple! In a dwelling place half-open, with sun ray holes, raise a clear mirror! See the five lights arise outside!

Place intelligence at the eye's top, see self-light clear outside! Look at each other from left corners, see the connecting thread-ray appearance! Or place light at eye's top, look at one another - see the three bodies connected as one method!

Look at butter-lamp essence with itself - meet primordial wisdom clear light's nature! Place two mirrors at colored pigment edge - with intelligent eye method supreme, look! Meet the mother-child measures of rigpa, know the dharmata mother measures!

Emaho!

[10017-10041]
Snow or salt or ocean arisen crystal stainless, window light held, five colors light spontaneously arise. What are these? Blue, white, yellow, red, green. Crystal one following person, own right eye right hand held, placed above eye, display seen. Left hand left eye close. This is example introduction. Meaning thus abides in own heart center. This is meaning introduction.

Emaho!

[10042-10072]
Sign own finger pressing eye, light bindu moon-eye-like arises. This sign introduction. Dharmakaya introduction: face to sun mandala. Sambhogakaya introduction: thus-gone body painted cloth placed before self, crystal eye above placed, eye gazing at sky, sambhogakaya body with face ear seen. Similarly sambhogakaya pure land intermediate state arising know.

[10073-10102]
Nirmanakaya introduction: dharma-possessing marks appearing own rigpa's miracle know. Day own light-ray's heap know. This is mind's habitual patterns hollow not abandoned knowing. This is nirmanakaya introduction. Channel root method appearance natural mode arising introduction. Thus seven aspects called light introduction. What is wisdom introduction? Dharmadhatu wisdom introduction examining metal bowl's essence: bowl well water-filled, clear showing mirror placed above eye, looking, bindu and atomic form arise. From that light and weapon-point-like radiate. This dharmadhatu wisdom introduction.

[10103-10132]
Mirror-like wisdom introduction: silver mirror two between mandala powder-drawn, edge near each side mirror one each placed. From that two displays arise. Equality wisdom introduction: water moon determination. Discriminating wisdom introduction: butter lamp determination.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. Accomplishing wisdom introduction: crystal stainless determination. Non-abiding wisdom introduction: sky rainbow determination. Completely perfect wisdom introduction: cloudless sky determination. These seven wisdom introduction.

[10133-10162]
Now showing rigpa's introduction: rigpa youth vase body introduction: white-clothed unstained person placed before self, jewel above eye placed, eye sky-raised looking, thus-gone peaceful body seen. Rest in this understanding.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. This rigpa youth vase body introduction. Rigpa youth hero powerful body introduction: black house black unstained black-clothed placed before, as above looking, thus-gone wrathful body seen.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. Rigpa base-abiding introduction: clear ocean determination. Rigpa all-clear introduction: sun moon determination. Rigpa non-dual introduction: vase body determination.

Emaho!

[10163-10186]
Rigpa with stain introduction: sun moon cloud-covered like determination. Rigpa not abiding anywhere introduction: eye mid-space gazing know. Thus seven rigpa introduction. Thus twenty-one completed, that person parinirvana time, rigpa from eye channel arising enters intermediate state's display. Second point special showing method has two: introduction's summary brief showing, and nature extensive differentiation. First: light and wisdom introduction seven establishes lesser faculties' certainty symbol. Body and thigle introduction seven establishes middling ones' light essence certainty. Rigpa and expanse introduction seven establishes excellent ones' certainty.

[10173-10210]
Not at all! Some use sky as example, some use different elements, some use light, some use divine bodies!

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The common vehicles generalize, some portions consider only impure-pure nature. But here, in this Secret Heart Essence meaning, no matter how many examples are shown, there is no place to deviate, no place to grasp!

For those who see awareness directly, examples are merely helpers. Then through essence, expansion, and dissolution manner - like a primordially pure crystal, great openness, pure like a crystal above - this is suitable and complete!

Vajrasattva's indicative example: white color, moon's color - through example, sign, and meaning three, awareness is demonstrated! Birthless, ceaseless, open expanse is shown!

This introduction suitable to sense-powers is experience-taking with hand guidance! Without deviation place, without stagnation place! Ear lineage and hand gesture together, confidence and superimposition cut, word and meaning connected!

This is called supreme introduction, the Buddha's Dharma lineage place! From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, relying on difficult introduction of vajra place!

Now the yogin's signs determining sequence: past life purification signs, how body-speech-mind abide; present path-entering signs, how the three doors appear!

Emaho!

[10187-10206]
From Introduction Ornament: "Twenty-one gradually introduction, light and wisdom itself, introduction seven aspects, lesser seven liberated. Body and thigle itself too, introduction seven aspects, middling seven's meaning. Rigpa and expanse seven, excellent ones' meaning."

[10207-10210]
Second, three aspects: light and wisdom introduction seven: wisdom's self-light expanse moved display five lights clear self-light introduction. The nature is complete.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[02-21-01-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
