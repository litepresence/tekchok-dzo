[9713-9713]
Inner-clear existing carries to exhaustion ground, primordial person's universal base self-arisen essence body inseparable. Recognition is immediate.

Three words. See. Decide. Rest. This is the entire introduction. Everything else is elaboration for those who need to exhaust themselves through investigation before they can recognize what is already present.

[9714-9733]
Yet like sun obscured by clouds, liberation recognizing own face, freed from all obscurations, realization manifest, original base and final liberation ground extremely different—this crucial point wise ones should know.

Wisdom expanse swirling like crystal light, dharmakaya clear dawning like crystal itself. That self-recognized dharmakaya abiding in own bed, now wishing to hold unconfused ground, naturally clear directly zangthal great expanse clarity hrik freshness non-distracted sustaining is crucial.

From Protector of Beings Glorious Sublime Lama's mouth: "Self-recognized dharmakaya own bed itself, wishing to hold unconfused ground whoever exists, all without error unconfused non-distracting doing is crucial, knowing like ocean meditation wise ones should know."

This old fool wandered for years seeking the "introduction." He met masters who gestured, who spoke, who demonstrated with crystals and mirrors. Finally, sitting by a high plateau lake at dawn, he saw his own face in the still water. "Oh," he said, "this is the introduction." The lake had been showing him all along.

[9734-9756]
Thus well spoken. At this introduction time, relaxed, self also newly certain uncommon produced, showing others. Again World Sun Dharma Lord Lama's mouth: "Introductions gradually introduced, well cared for. Alala, Olala, what is this without parts? Not introduced, not unintroduced, don't do, non-dharma action don't claim. Don't cling to delusion, don't hold lama's name doing non-dharma bad actions, name meaning must accord."

Thus advised, future times entering this dharma should place thus in heart.

Mountain hermit watched clouds form and dissolve in the valley below his cave. Each morning, new shapes. Each evening, gone. The introduction is like this—not something you keep, but something you meet fresh each time. Don't try to hold yesterday's introduction. Meet today's.

[9757-9780]
Second point particular differentiation explaining sentient beings and wisdom's symbols extensively in two: root rigpa's deluded returning mode mind's introduction, and rigpa self-display possessing self-display wisdom introduction.

First: from Introduction Ornament—"Emaho! Appearance as mind introduction, mind's arriving mode. Mind itself empty introduction, emptiness bliss expansion reached. Empty as rigpa introduction, rigpa itself expanse wisdom non-dual."

Here three: outer object key point establishing inner mind, inner mind key point establishing secret expanse, secret expanse key point establishing unsurpassed rigpa.

[9781-9806]
First has showing appearance object baseless delusion, and showing appearance holder own mind empty two.

First: outer various displays red-blue container-contained five elements' expanse clear, these to own mind deluded face appearing, except external objects' things and inner mind's things both unrealized, baseless empty miracle non-existent clear appearance nature, like cataract sufferer's hair-falls and dream magical display.

Emaho! The dream is not unreal—it is real as dream. The appearance is not nothing—it is the display of awareness. Don't make the mistake of denying appearance. Don't make the mistake of grasping it as external. This is the middle way of introduction.

[9807-9951]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why do all this analysis? The object is mind's display! The mind is rigpa's display! Rigpa is expanse's display! Stop dissecting and recognize!

Between the elaborate introductions and the direct pointing, we find the vast middle way. Use the twenty-one introductions if you need them. Skip them if you don't. What matters is recognition, not the method of introduction.

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you prepare the crystal, while you arrange the mirrors, maintain the recognition that this too is introduction. The preparation is introduction. The recognition is introduction. The daily life is introduction.

[9952-9972]
From that: "All buddhas' measure holder, example wisdoms examine. Sign wisdom measure holder, empty bindu lamp examine. Meaning wisdom measure holder, direct clear display examine."

Briefly summarized: outer display object baseless, holding that appearance mind empty introduction, samsara delusion certain non-existent one knowing, that insufficient, root rigpa's meaning direct introduction, expanse rigpa non-separation introduction, carry to kadag's dharmakaya—this advice for supreme excellent ones.

[9973-9991]
Second, self-display wisdom introduction has two: object faculties' differentiation and introduction sequence.

First: excellent middling lesser three faculties seven each makes twenty-one. These also wisdom, training, liberation different.

First excellent means wisdom and realization aspect. Differentiated seven: excellent's lesser, excellent's middling, excellent's excellent, excellent's supreme, excellent's best, excellent's peak, excellent's completion.

These established from easy realization self-display. Middling also seven: middling's lesser, middling's middling, middling's excellent, middling's supreme, middling's best, middling's peak, middling's completion.

[9992-10016]
Lesser also seven: lesser's lesser, lesser's middling, lesser's excellent, lesser's best, lesser's peak, lesser's peak held.

Second: thus twenty-one faculties arising, twenty-one introductions arise. These too each introduction has two: common differentiation and special showing method.

First: light and wisdom rigpa three, seven-group introduction: from Vajrasattva heart mirror tantra—"Rigpa strayed from base, entering path should know, example meaning introduction etc., twenty-one introductions should know."

This wandering yogi encountered a teacher who showed him twenty-one different introductions. "Which one is right?" he asked. The teacher laughed. "All are right. None are necessary. The introduction that works for you is the right one. But remember—they all point to the same recognition."

[10017-10041]
Snow or salt or ocean arisen crystal stainless, window light held, five colors light spontaneously arise. What are these? Blue, white, yellow, red, green.

Crystal one following person, own right eye right hand held, placed above eye, display seen. Left hand left eye close. This is example introduction. Meaning thus abides in own heart center. This is meaning introduction.

[10042-10072]
Sign own finger pressing eye, light bindu moon-eye-like arises. This sign introduction.

Dharmakaya introduction: face to sun mandala. Sambhogakaya introduction: thus-gone body painted cloth placed before self, crystal eye above placed, eye gazing at sky, sambhogakaya body with face ear seen. Similarly sambhogakaya pure land intermediate state arising know.

Nirmanakaya introduction: dharma-possessing marks appearing own rigpa's miracle know. Day own light-ray's heap know. This is mind's habitual patterns hollow not abandoned knowing. This is nirmanakaya introduction.

Channel root method appearance natural mode arising introduction. Thus seven aspects called light introduction.

[10073-10132]
What is wisdom introduction?

Dharmadhatu wisdom introduction examining metal bowl's essence: bowl well water-filled, clear showing mirror placed above eye, looking, bindu and atomic form arise. From that light and weapon-point-like radiate. This dharmadhatu wisdom introduction.

Mirror-like wisdom introduction: silver mirror two between mandala powder-drawn, edge near each side mirror one each placed. From that two displays arise.

Equality wisdom introduction: water moon determination. Discriminating wisdom introduction: butter lamp determination. Accomplishing wisdom introduction: crystal stainless determination. Non-abiding wisdom introduction: sky rainbow determination. Completely perfect wisdom introduction: cloudless sky determination. These seven wisdom introduction.

Essence holder's spacious instruction: rest in these introductions without grasping. The crystal shows you your nature. Don't become attached to the crystal. The mirror reflects your face. Don't mistake the mirror for your face.

[10133-10162]
Now showing rigpa's introduction: rigpa youth vase body introduction: white-clothed unstained person placed before self, jewel above eye placed, eye sky-raised looking, thus-gone peaceful body seen. This rigpa youth vase body introduction.

Rigpa youth hero powerful body introduction: black house black unstained black-clothed placed before, as above looking, thus-gone wrathful body seen.

Rigpa base-abiding introduction: clear ocean determination. Rigpa all-clear introduction: sun moon determination. Rigpa non-dual introduction: vase body determination.

Emaho!

[10163-10186]
Rigpa with stain introduction: sun moon cloud-covered like determination. Rigpa not abiding anywhere introduction: eye mid-space gazing know. Thus seven rigpa introduction.

Thus twenty-one completed, that person parinirvana time, rigpa from eye channel arising enters intermediate state's display.

Second point special showing method has two: introduction's summary brief showing, and nature extensive differentiation.

First: light and wisdom introduction seven establishes lesser faculties' certainty symbol. Body and thigle introduction seven establishes middling ones' light essence certainty. Rigpa and expanse introduction seven establishes excellent ones' certainty.

[10187-10210]
From Introduction Ornament: "Twenty-one gradually introduction, light and wisdom itself, introduction seven aspects, lesser seven liberated. Body and thigle itself too, introduction seven aspects, middling seven's meaning. Rigpa and expanse seven, excellent ones' meaning."

Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: twenty-one introductions? Seven lesser? Seven middling? Seven excellent? Meanwhile, recognition is available right now! Stop counting and see!

Final instruction: the introduction is not a destination to reach but a recognition that dawns. Whether you need twenty-one introductions or just one pointing, the result is the same—recognition of what was never absent. May all beings recognize their nature through whichever introduction suits their faculties.
