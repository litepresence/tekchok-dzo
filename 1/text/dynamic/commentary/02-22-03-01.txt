Always alone abiding, any fear mind absent, mountain forest wandering person, this formerly mind too habituated. Thus possessing person, uninterrupted true conduct, three lives certainly without doubt, buddhahood."

[10826-10845]
The text explains three types: the thigle of the body's channels, the thigle of the path, and the thigle of the final fruition. Think of it like this: the thigle in your channels is like the seed of a medicinal tree already planted in the soil.

Dancing in space, distinctions play and dissolve. Who dances? Just play! Ecstatic empty play! The path thigle is like the sap rising through the trunk. The fruition thigle is the fully ripened healing fruit! Line 10832 speaks of the essence of thigle as "separate yet not separate, dwelling as one without duality.

See the distinction. Who makes it? Empty." You must understand this directly, not merely as intellectual understanding. When you gaze at the sky and sky-gaze gazes back—this is the nature (rang bzhin) of thigle, beyond one and many. The path thigle

[10832-10858]
Thus. These signs naturally body speech mind primordially abiding former life habituated clarity sent, not completed there, interrupted became this life shown, here too effort not made uncertain, various karma power other existence entered. These signs conceptual holding meaning habituated going birds, deer, dogs, horses etc. arising too former life white three body speech mind trained arising, black karma lower realms' going birth, later forward now actions depending, now true supreme dharma conduct important.

[10850-10853]
is moved by the wisdom wind through the channels—like water flowing naturally downhill without being pushed. You don't need to force it! The four lamps shine upon their objects naturally, like the sun illuminating the valley without choosing which flowers to touch.

Line 10843 tells us of the five wisdom thigles dwelling unmoving in the central channel—this is your true nature, always present, like butter already in milk. You don't need to add anything or go anywhere!

Meditate on this, fortunate disciple. These signs and thigles are not fantasies but the natural display of your own rigpa when it matures. Like a lion who has no fear of the snare because he knows his strength, when these signs arise, know that liberation is certain.

Emaho!

[10855-10860]
. The Great Perfection transcends gradual and sudden. Recognition is the nature itself immediate as awareness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The root text [10855] speaks of the "unfabricated, all-pervading dharmata thigle." You must understand: this is not something you create through effort, like a potter shaping clay. It is already present, like the sky that needs no painting to be blue! When you rest without fabrication, this thigle naturally dawns.

Line 10856 describes Samantabhadra's thigle that appears without good or bad, large or small. Think of a clear mirror—it reflects a beautiful face or an ugly one without preference or judgment. Your awareness is exactly like this! It does not discriminate between pure and impure appearances; all are equally the play of dharmata.

The dharmadhatu thigle of line 10857 is clarity without inside or outside. Have you ever looked at the ocean on a calm day? The water and sky meet without a clear boundary. So it is with the dharmadhatu—where is the division between your mind and the universe? There is none!

Line 10858 speaks of the thigle of pure dharmadhatu, free from extremes and partiality. Like a bird flying through the sky leaving no trace, the pure dharmadhatu leaves no mark of going or staying, coming or going. It is beyond all conceptual pigeonholes!

The great wisdom thigle of line 10860—"unfabricated from the beginning, appearing directly unobscured by any affliction"—this is your true face! Afflictions are like clouds in the sky; they never truly touch or taint the sky's nature. Similarly, anger, desire, and ignorance never truly obscure your innate wisdom.

Then the text turns to the signs of maturation. Line 10877 speaks of external signs: "From the burning relics, the thigle becomes a sphere." When a realized master passes, sometimes the body transforms into light, leaving only relics—round, like bindus. This is not magic, you understand? It is the natural result of having recognized and stabilized the nature (rang bzhin) of mind.

Line 10882 says: "All these are signs of your own experience." Do not look outside for confirmation! When you recognize rigpa, you know it yourself, like tasting honey—you don't need someone else to tell you it is sweet.

The text warns

[10859-10884]
Again from that: "Thus family and non-family, former habituated momentum, these signs body arising. Birds deer dogs etc., animal form grasping, these signs arising, formerly trained interrupted." Thus. Second point now path entered signs particular explaining two: common general signs knowing, uncommon supreme secret path signs manifesting.

[10884-10891]
: "The mind does not engage with others even for an instant." This does not mean becoming cold or indifferent! It means your mind is so content in its own nature that it does not grasp at external distractions. Like a mountain hermit who has found inner peace, you are complete within yourself.

The final lines

[10885-10899]
First has three: three body speech mind signs arising changing, key point not arrived certainty lacking signs, rigpa direct not held mara obstacle signs. First: not practiced persons and birds deer etc. too arising, changing meaningless cause signs called.

[10892-10899]
promise: even in two years, if you know the measure of rigpa, you will dwell inseparable from the self-appearance of dharmadhatu and awareness. This is not mere philosophy! It is the living experience of ground, path, and fruition as one.

Emaho!
