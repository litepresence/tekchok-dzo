First, speech training: speak less, cut ordinary talk, train briefly. Then train long. Even when there's no cause for speech, speak alone. Abiding in mantra, in virtuous speech. Don't mix with others' words. The body becomes the sign. Swallowing—not chanting mantras. Firm—not even body signs. The silence becomes complete.

From Seed Tantra: "Speech like a mute, not making sign with anyone, thus, whoever does this—mind's projecting and gathering self-cuts." Thus it was said. Cutting speech's speaking, inexpressible meaning arises in mind. Not mixed with other sentient beings' speech—body purified purpose exists. By body purified, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and Dakins bless, liberating body into illusory body.

[4617-4630]
Then, object blocked, speech purified—sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes. Speech utterance blocked, mind purified—that sign: first seeing non-human form, then clairvoyance arises. Thus, speech's main point: instruction on cutting body-mind connection. Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse. From Thalgyur: "Mind placed in dhatu, accomplished."

[4631-4640]
Thus, chief body and speech bound, mind secondarily caught—dhatu-awareness dawning, elements' binding cut. From the Seed Tantra: "Thus binding body, speech, and three—in dharmadhatu's vision, this becomes habituation." Thus it was said, and: "Body and speech and mind's main-point—know and rely, liberate from samsara."

[4639-4650]
Second meaning: three main-points relying, direct self-point delivery, three are: Bind three main-points in vajra seal; direct rigpa own face showing; from that appearance arising manner showing. First: three crucial points general seal showing, particular own crucial point peak placing.

[4651-4660]
Direct peak placing: three: bind three in vajra seal—body-speech-mind three, three kayas, three wisdoms, three syllables, three points. Direct rigpa face showing—rigpa itself not mediated. From that appearance manner showing—all appearance as rigpa's display. Three crucial points general seal—body-speech-mind in vajra seal. Particular own crucial point—the unique point of this practice.

[4661-4680]
From the bind three—sphere of three kayas, syllable three, vajra three. The seal is the three kayas as seal. The syllable three—OM AH HUM. The vajra three—body, speech, mind as vajra. This is the binding. From direct rigpa face—rigpa own face, not another's. The face that sees is the face seen.

From appearance manner showing—all appearances as rigpa's display. The appearances arise from rigpa. They are rigpa. They return to rigpa. Nothing outside rigpa appears.
