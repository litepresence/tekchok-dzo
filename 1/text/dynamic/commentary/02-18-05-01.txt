First, training speech: speak less, cut ordinary talk, train briefly at first. Then train for longer periods. Even when there is no cause for speech, speak alone. Abiding in mantra, in virtuous speech. Do not mix with others' words even in syllables. At this time, the body becomes the sign, conveying meaning.

Swallowing—not chanting mantras. Firm—not even body signs. The silence becomes complete, like a cave where dripping water is the only sound.

From Seed Tantra: "Speech like a mute, not making sign with anyone, thus, whoever does this—mind's projecting and gathering self-cuts." Thus it was said.

A practitioner at a mountain hermitage took a vow of silence for three years. At first, the urge to speak was like a wild horse pulling at its tether. Gradually, like prayer flags fading in strong wind, the words lost their power. By the end, he understood: silence is not the absence of speech but the presence of something vaster.

Cutting speech's speaking, inexpressible meaning arises in mind. Not mixed with other sentient beings' speech—body purified purpose exists. By body purified, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and Dakinis bless, liberating body into illusory body.

Then, object blocked, speech purified—sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes. Speech utterance blocked, mind purified—that sign: first seeing non-human form, then clairvoyance arises.

Thus, speech's main point: instruction on cutting body-mind connection. Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse. From Thalgyur: "Mind placed in dhatu, accomplished."

This wandering yogi once spoke constantly—mantras, prayers, instructions, chatter. His teacher placed a stone in his mouth. "Hold this," he said, "and see what remains when words stop." What remained was not nothing—it was everything, unspoken.

Thus, chief body and speech bound, mind secondarily caught—dhatu-awareness dawning, elements' binding cut. From the Seed Tantra: "Thus binding body, speech, and three—in dharmadhatu's vision, this becomes habituation." Thus it was said, and: "Body and speech and mind's main-point—know and rely, liberate from samsara."

Like the three channels of a high mountain valley—wind, water, and pilgrimage path—all following the same course, yet distinct. Bind them together, and the valley opens to the sky.

Second meaning: three main-points relying, direct self-point delivery, three are: Bind three main-points in vajra seal; direct rigpa own face showing; from that appearance arising manner showing.

First: three crucial points general seal showing, particular own crucial point peak placing.

Direct peak placing: three: bind three in vajra seal—body-speech-mind three, three kayas, three wisdoms, three syllables, three points. Direct rigpa face showing—rigpa itself not mediated. From that appearance manner showing—all appearance as rigpa's display.

Three crucial points general seal—body-speech-mind in vajra seal. Particular own crucial point—the unique point of this practice, like a specific hot spring among many—this one heals this particular ailment.

From the bind three—sphere of three kayas, syllable three, vajra three. The seal is the three kayas as seal. The syllable three—OM AH HUM. The vajra three—body, speech, mind as vajra. This is the binding.

From direct rigpa face—rigpa own face, not another's. The face that sees is the face seen. The looker and the looked-at are one, like a high plateau lake reflecting the mountain—the mountain sees itself in the water.

From appearance manner showing—all appearances as rigpa's display. The appearances arise from rigpa. They are rigpa. They return to rigpa. Nothing outside rigpa appears. Like clouds that form from sky, exist as sky, dissolve into sky—never separate from sky, never other than sky.

Mountain hermit binding the three—body in vajra posture, speech in silence, mind in sky-gazing. After months, the bindings became natural, like a bird that forgets it is flying. The practice disappeared into recognition.

Therefore. The three crucial points are not techniques to master but natural expressions of recognition. Body seals itself when recognized. Speech silences itself when understood. Mind rests naturally when seen.

Do not force the body into posture—find the posture that expresses recognition. Do not choke speech into silence—find the silence that speaks without words. Do not blank the mind into emptiness—find the emptiness that is full of awareness.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why make this so complicated? Three points, three seals, three syllables—meanwhile, recognition is present! Cut through the elaborations. See your nature now!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you prepare your sitting place, while you arrange your posture, maintain the recognition that binds everything naturally. Daily life becomes the practice. The recognition while tying your belt matters as much as the recognition in meditation.

Final instruction: the three crucial points are training wheels. Use them until they are seen through. Then even stumbling is vajra posture, even chatter is mantra, even confusion is rigpa's display. The seal is not something you apply—it is what remains when fabrication ceases.

Emaho! The wonder of binding body, speech, and mind in the vajra seal of recognition. May all beings see through the three to the one that is never bound. May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle be realized in this very life.
