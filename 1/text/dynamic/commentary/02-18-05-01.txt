[4601-4695] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, speech training: speech very little, ordinary talk cut, short sessions train. Then long train. Occasion speech cause not, alone speak. Abiding: mantra and recitation, etc., virtue speech not deny. Other words syllables one not mix. This time body signs meaning understand. Recitation: mantra, etc., recitation all not do. Stable: what not say nature from not departing do, body signs also not do. From Seed Tantra: "Speech how dumb like, who sign merely not do, thus who done person, mind's movement still self-set."

[4601-4695] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Silent. Speech. Stop. You think training speech means saying special words. Training speech means not speaking. The dumb person doesn't practice silence. Silence practices them. Signs without words—this is the language of recognition.

[4601-4695] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man once took a vow of silence for a year! First month: constant urge to speak. Second month: watching thoughts become words. Third month: silence became loud. By year's end—couldn't remember why I spoke in the first place.

[4601-4695] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The three crucial points—door, object, wind-rigpa—are the three consorts' seals. The door is method, the object is wisdom, the wind-rigpa is their union. Press these points and dharmata becomes direct.

[4639-4695] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, meaning three crucial points depending, direct self-peak placing: three aspects. Three crucial points vajra seal binding, direct rigpa own face showing, from that appearance arising manner showing. First: three crucial points general seal showing, particular own crucial point peak placing.

[4639-4695] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Crucial. Points. Stop. You think crucial points are external techniques. They are the recognition of what is already pressing itself upon you. Door, object, wind-rigpa—three aspects of one recognition.

[Final] Press the crucial points of body, speech, and mind. Wisdom arises naturally. The pressing is not force. It is recognition.

Emaho! The three crucial points!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
