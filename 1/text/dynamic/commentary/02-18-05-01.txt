[4601-4610] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, speech training: Train in short sessions to speak less, cutting ordinary speech. Then train long. Occasionally, though no cause for speech, speak alone. Abiding: mantra and utterance, etc., virtuous utterance—not denying. Not mixing even one syllable with others. At this time, the body's sign makes meaning understood. Swallowing: not doing all mantra etc. utterance. Firm: not transgressing from the state of not uttering anything—not even body sign.

[4601-4610] Voice 13 (Patrul): Speech training—speak less. Cut ordinary talk. First short sessions, then long. Sometimes speak even when there's no reason—just to practice. Abiding in mantra, in virtuous speech. Don't mix with others' words. The body becomes the sign. Swallowing—not chanting mantras. Firm—not even body signs. The silence becomes complete.

[4601-4610] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Silence. Speech. Train. You think speech training means learning special words. It means learning not to speak. Short sessions first, then long. Sometimes speak alone even without cause. The body becomes the sign. The silence becomes the speech.

[4611-4620] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): From the Seed Tantra: "Speech like a mute, not making sign with anyone, thus, whoever does this—mind's projecting and gathering self-cut." Thus it was said. Cutting speech's speaking, inexpressible meaning arises in mind. Not mixed with other sentient beings' speech—body purified purpose exists. By body purified, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and sky-goer Dakins bless, liberating body into illusory body.

[4611-4620] Voice 04 (Padmasambhava): like a mute—no ordinary Speech speech. Not making signs with anyone—inner silence. Mind's projecting and gathering cuts itself. The inexpressible meaning arises. The body is purified. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and Dakins bless. The body becomes illusory. This is the power of speech training.

[4611-4620] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Look at your speech. Is it yours? The words arise and you think you are speaking them. But where do they come from? The mute has an advantage—they see the silence behind words. Cut the speech, and the meaning that cannot be spoken arises in mind.

[4621-4630] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Then, object blocked, speech purified—sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes. Speech utterance blocked, mind purified—that sign: first seeing non-human form, then clairvoyance arises. Thus, speech's main point: instruction on cutting body-mind connection. Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse. From Thalgyur: "Mind placed in dhatu, accomplished." Thus it was said.

[4621-4630] Voice 13 (Patrul): When speech is blocked, purification happens. First, signs appear to non-humans—dakinis, yidams, protectors. Then clairvoyance arises. The main point of speech is cutting the body-mind connection. The main point of mind is not thinking—gaze at the sky expanse, let thoughts cease.

[4621-4630] Voice 06 (Consort): The three seals—body, speech, mind. When speech is sealed, the body becomes pure. When mind is sealed, thoughts cease. The dakinis meet you in the space between words. The clairvoyance arises naturally. This is the secret speech.

[4631-4640] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Thus, chief body and speech bound, mind secondarily caught—dhatu-awareness dawning, elements' binding cut. From the Seed Tantra: "Thus binding body, speech, and three—in dharmadhatu's vision, this becomes habituation." Thus it was said, and: "Body and speech and mind's main-point—know and rely, liberate from samsara." Thus it was said.

[4631-4640] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Bind. Cut. Liberate. Body and speech bound, mind caught—dhatu-awareness dawns. The elements' binding is cut. Bind body, speech, mind in the vajra seal. This becomes habituation. The main point: know and rely, liberate from samsara.

[4639-4650] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second meaning: three main-points relying, direct self-point delivery, three are: Bind three main-points in vajra seal; direct rigpa own face showing; from that appearance arising manner showing. First: three crucial points general seal showing, particular own crucial point peak placing.

[4639-4650] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Three crucial points: door, object, wind-rigpa. Bind them in vajra seal. Show rigpa's own face directly. Show the manner of arising appearances. The door is the method. The object is the wisdom. The wind-rigpa is their union. Press these points and dharmata becomes direct.

[4651-4660] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Direct peak placing: three: bind three in vajra seal—body-speech-mind three, three kayas, three wisdoms, three syllables, three points. Direct rigpa face showing—rigpa itself not mediated. From that appearance manner showing—all appearance as rigpa's display. Three crucial points general seal—body-speech-mind in vajra seal. Particular own crucial point—the unique point of this practice.

[4651-4660] Voice 13 (Patrul): Three ways to directly place the point. First, bind body, speech, mind in vajra seal. The three become one. Second, show rigpa's face directly—not through mediation, but immediate recognition. Third, show that all appearance is rigpa's display. This is the direct pointing.

[4661-4670] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): From the bind three—sphere of three kayas, syllable three, vajra three. The seal is the three kayas as seal. The syllable three—OM AH HUM. The vajra three—body, speech, mind as vajra. This is the binding. From direct rigpa face—rigpa own face, not another's. The face that sees is the face seen.

[4661-4670] Voice 04 (Padmasambhava): The bind of three—three kayas, three syllables, three vajras. OM AH HUM—body, speech, mind. The seal of three kayas. The vajra of three. This is the secret binding. Then the direct showing—rigpa's own face. Not the face in the mirror, but the face that sees the mirror.

[4671-4680] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): From appearance manner showing—all appearances as rigpa's display. The appearances arise from rigpa. They are rigpa. They return to rigpa. Nothing outside rigpa appears. This is the view of appearance. The three crucial points: general seal, particular seal, direct pointing.

[4671-4680] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Appearance. Display. Rigpa. All appearances are rigpa's display. Nothing appears outside rigpa. The display is the displayer. The appearance is the appearer. See this and the three points are complete.

[4681-4695] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The second: having bound the three, the binding itself becomes the path. The third: appearance showing directly—rigpa's self-display. The fourth: having directly shown, continuous training—habituation. The fifth: all obstructions purified—dharmata directly realized.

[4681-4695] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): Five aspects of the practice. First, bind the three. Second, the binding becomes the path. Third, appearance shows directly—rigpa's self-display. Fourth, continuous training—habituation. Fifth, obstructions purified—dharmata realized. These five are one practice.

[Final] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Speech training—speak less, cut ordinary talk. The body becomes sign. The silence speaks. Buddhas bless. The body becomes illusory. Bind body, speech, mind in vajra seal. Show rigpa directly. All appearances are rigpa's display. The three crucial points complete the path. The dharmata is realized.

Emaho! The speech training! The vajra seal! The rigpa's face!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. See what is. Rest in recognition.
