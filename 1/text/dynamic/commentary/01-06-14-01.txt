First essence—mantra samaya binds continuum. Sngags kyi sdom pas rgyud
bsdam pa—secret mantra's commitment binds the stream. Not prison bars,
but the natural binding that occurs when recognition dawns. Like a river
bound by its banks—without banks, no river, only flood.

[9703-9703]
During my wandering years... once feared samaya. Thought one mistake meant falling into
hell. Sweated in vigilance, watched every thought. Then recognized: samaya
is not something to keep but something that keeps you when recognition is
present. Natural law, not imposed rule.

[9703-9703]
Gnyen po'i dpung—the antidote army. All the forces that oppose recognition,
gathered and bound without needing to emit arrows. When nature is recognized,
opposing forces become allies. The army dissolves because there was never
an enemy.

[9703-9703]
Binding natural. Protection inherent. Liberation complete. Three aspects
of samaya—not three separate things, but one recognition described three
ways.

[9703-9703]
See nature. Sound and emptiness indivisible—the essence of mantra. Bind
recognition to awareness, and samaya keeps itself. No effort needed, no
vigilance required. Rest in the binding that is liberation itself.
