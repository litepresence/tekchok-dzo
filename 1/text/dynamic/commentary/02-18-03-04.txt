Fourth, regarding these: through the four supports or companions, if the pith is not familiarized, familiarization does not reach the measure. Therefore the final support instruction and four topics are taught.

From the Glorious Mountain-Stack Tantra: If one desires to familiarize the direct pith, the pith is distinguished as four sections.

From this: The analysis. The framework reveals: the path is completed through four topics.

Concepts fall away; what remains is mind's nature displaying itself.

The certainty of completing the path through four topics:
- Externally: exhausting the appearances of the four emanations with their supports
- Internally: exhausting the increase and decrease of the four times
- Secretly: exhausting the changes of the four day-moons
- Supreme: emptying the ground of the four body-speech-mind-consciousness—thus four certainties

Moreover:
- Externally: demonstrating the certainty of the four empowerments
- Internally: expanding the channels of the four wheels
- Secretly: actually clarifying the four wisdoms
- Supreme: showing the increase of the four lamps—thus four topics are taught.

The chest was always empty and full—entire from the origin.

If more than this, chattering is purposeless. If fewer, without root, the fruit of the desired meaning does not ripen—depending on purpose, thus four arise.

Four is not magic. It is enough to point, not so much that the pointing becomes distraction.

First, exhausting the pith of body and speech. From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra: Having gone before, in order to look at the direct meaning—body, speech.
mind are thoroughly bound.

Here: three:
-  It is simplification. Not making the mind small, but recognizing its vast openness.

First: From that itself—body like a lion, like a sage, like an elephant. If one does not move from these, even with three thousand Buddhas, the fortune is equal.

The body postures are not external forms to perfect. They are expressions of recognition—lion's fearlessness, sage's stillness, elephant's groundedness.

The analysis. The framework reveals: the body is the temple of awareness, the speech is the wind of awareness, the mind is the space of awareness.

From the Pearl Garland: The body's pith is threefold: the lion's manner and elephant's manner, abide like a sage.

Here, the three kayas too—though the supports are different, through three different postures of a single body.

Liberation through recognition is never gradual, never gradual.

One body, three kayas. One awareness, three expressions. The posture is not the goal. The goal is recognizing what the posture points to.

One practitioner sat in posture for hours, thinking the posture would give him something. What he got was a sore back and no wisdom. Then he laughed—the wisdom was present all along, regardless of posture.

What seems to block the way IS the way, seen differently.

Between the view and its object, recognition arises naturally, like sun appearing from behind clouds.
