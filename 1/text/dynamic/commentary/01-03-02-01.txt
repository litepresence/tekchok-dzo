Five aggregates. Form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness. Five fingers of one hand. Five waves of one ocean. This is not a list to memorize—this is the structure of samsara itself. Yet it is also the structure of liberation. The same five, recognized differently.

the crystal cave of Yanglesho hermit... spent years analyzing aggregates in meditation. Separating them. Categorizing them. Then one morning by a high plateau lake, watching ripples form and dissolve, he understood—the water doesn't become something else when ripples appear. The aggregates are ripples on awareness. The awareness remains unchanged.

Thus. We enumerate. Form aggregate—physical, coarse, the body and world. Feeling aggregate—pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, the three gates of experience. Perception aggregate—the grasper, the labeler, the "I recognize this." Formations aggregate—volition, karma, the builder of futures. Consciousness aggregate—the knower, the basis, the all-ground. Five aspects. One experience.

Mountain hermit watched five fingers grasp a stone once. Each finger different—thumb strong, index pointing, middle longest, ring weakest, pinky small. Together they hold what none could hold alone. So too with aggregates. Each has its function. Each has its domain. Together they create the experience called "self." But look closely—where is the hand separate from the fingers?

[31-40]
Feeling aggregate: pleasant, unpleasant, neutral. Three poisons in disguise. The chase after pleasant, the avoidance of unpleasant, the ignorance of neutral—these are the chains of samsara. But recognize feeling as feeling, and the chains break immediately.

Feel what arises. Recognize its nature. Liberate through seeing. Three aspects of one process—like ice melting in mountain sun. Solid one moment, water the next, never the same yet never different.

This wanderer once spent a winter in Naropa's hermitage, watching feelings arise and pass. At first he tried to control them—cultivate pleasant, avoid unpleasant. Exhausting! Then he tried to observe without reaction. Better, but still effort. Finally he simply felt them without commentary. Recognition dawned: the feeling and the feeler are not two.

[51-60]
Perception aggregate: the grasper and the grasped. This is where confusion accelerates. Form appears, consciousness contacts, perception grasps. Suddenly: "I like this. I don't like that." The entire mandala of samsara spins from this moment of grasping.

But the same moment, recognized as display, becomes liberation. Form appears—recognize it as display. Consciousness contacts—see it as contact. Perception grasps—watch the grasping liberate itself. No need to stop the wheel. Just see it spinning.

[51-61]
The eighteen dhatus: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind—the six organs. Form, sound, scent, taste, touch, phenomena—the six objects. Eye-consciousness through mind-consciousness—the six consciousnesses. Eighteen factors, all interdependent, all empty, all the play of rigpa.

Abhidharma analyzes them precisely. Useful analysis. But don't stop there. Where is the perceiver of these eighteen? The perceiver is not a nineteenth factor. The perceiver is the recognition that all eighteen are display. Single-pointed knowing. Clear knowing. Discerning knowing. These are not philosophical concepts—they are already present.

Patrul Rinpoche's earthy teaching: This uneducated yogi... watched his mind label everything. "Good weather. Bad weather. Good meditation. Bad meditation." The labels multiplied like rabbits in spring! Then one day he stopped labeling and just experienced. The world didn't change. His experience transformed completely.
