First is: bind body speech main-point, wind mind relax from latency; inner samadhi pervades luminous-clear empty state.
spacious knowing, grasp-hold not-existing, pleasure happiness vast, arise spread-desire, though not-existing attachment grasp, even hair-tip, arise from arriving at nature meditation main-point.

Here's the first point—bind the crucial points of body and speech. Let the wind and mind relax from their latency. The inner samadhi spreads through the clear-light empty state. The knowing becomes spacious, without grasping. The pleasure and happiness arise naturally, like the sun rising without effort. This is not fabricated bliss. This is the natural meditation.

Fabricated meditation: pleasure happiness arise, great experience change, coarse throb or song dance desire arise, cause attachment grasp to go. This: though dawn pleasure happiness, also self-power obtain pleasure happiness, grasp not-existing, knowing difference existing, fabricated meditate. Know difference of meditation arriving at nature wind.

Consider this: Fabricated meditation tries to create bliss. Natural meditation lets bliss arise. The difference is subtle but crucial. Fabricated bliss—you get it and grasp it. Natural bliss—arises and dissolves without grasping. Don't confuse the two.

End change experience: wind experience vision part is—like firefly, like cloud, like smoke, like haze, like moon dawn, like star dawn, like sky brightening, blue vision existing, like sun dawn, outer inner unimpeded vision—eight. Become clear dim and dawn cease cause: not firm, cannot stand, change go—called end change experience, cause is wind moving experience.

Eight signs of changing experience. First like a firefly—flickering, uncertain. Then like clouds—moving, forming, dissolving. Then smoke—rising, dispersing. Then haze—obscuring, clearing. Then the moon rising—gentle, soft. Then stars—many, scattered. Then the sky brightening—blue appearing. Then the sun—everything illuminated. These are the stages of wind experience. They change. They don't stay. Know them as wind moving.

These do existing, need purify wind mind. Vision experience is: great awareness self-resonance luminous-clear. Occasion: outer vision increases, from arriving at measure; self-resonance dissolves into base, reverse inner, only outer clear need; cause need dissolve into spontaneous-completion pure dhatu. Inner clear: in self-light expanse, awareness body wisdom palace, originally abide spontaneous-completion great, not-existing change. Therefore here: vision experience is chief.

These changing experiences arise because the wind-mind is still moving. Purify the wind-mind. The vision experience is different—it is the great awareness self-radiant, luminous-clear. The outer visions increase, then self-radiance dissolves back into the base. The inner becomes clear. The change stops. This is vision experience—the chief experience in dzogchen.

Knowing experience: is intellect, change, cannot stand measure, all-conceptual conventional appearance possessor, remember doer difference, near-side concept gather cause. Do measure this: similar to bird doing hide cover, place measure in cloud. Time not existing to realize meaning, see self-point not arrive. Wherein, this: vision experience, see wisdom five color vision, transcend half end of samsara action, grasp field vision. See dhatu vision: that above, not existing grasp concept part half, grasp empty extreme wrong cause, transcend two-thirds samsara part.

Knowing experience is different. It is conceptual, changing, unstable—like hiding a bird in a cloud. You can't find it. You can't measure it. It's the conceptual mind trying to understand what is beyond concept. Vision experience is direct—wisdom's five colors, the dhatu vision, free from grasping. Don't confuse knowing with seeing.

Self-purify all-concept base ground, grasp part half, grasp vision self-characteristic wrong cause, called person and dharmas grasp-hold self not-existing concept. Briefly: all vision experiences—wisdom five color vision.

Garab Dorje's three: Direct recognition. Unwavering rest. Continual return. All vision experiences gather into two: wisdom five-color vision and dhatu vision. These increase in beauty and clarity. The liberation from binding frees the five poisons—desire, aversion, delusion, pride, jealousy. The visions arise like a net, like forms, like many eyes, like spots, like a canopy. They transcend the world, the aggregates, the three realms. The pure blessing of dharmata view remains.

[Final] Three experiences: fabricated, changing.
vision. Fabricated is grasping. Changing is wind. Vision is the chief. Natural meditation arrives at the nature of wind. The five colors arise. The dhatu becomes clear. The path is complete.

Emaho! The eight changing experiences! The five-color wisdom vision! The dhatu vision beyond all concept!

The analyzer is analyzed—seeing this is the teaching. Confusion and clarity are not two—just recognition and its absence wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. See what is. Let it be as it is.
