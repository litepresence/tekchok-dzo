[5085-5088] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First is: bind body speech main-point, wind mind relax from latency; inner samadhi pervades luminous-clear empty state, and spacious knowing, grasp-hold not-existing, pleasure happiness vast, arise spread-desire, though not-existing attachment grasp, even hair-tip, arise from arriving at nature meditation main-point.

[5085-5088] Voice 13 (Patrul): Here's the first point—bind the crucial points of body and speech. Let the wind and mind relax from their latency. The inner samadhi spreads through the clear-light empty state. The knowing becomes spacious, without grasping. The pleasure and happiness arise naturally, like the sun rising without effort. This is not fabricated bliss. This is the natural meditation.

[5088-5090] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Fabricated meditation: pleasure happiness arise, great experience change, coarse throb or song dance desire arise, cause attachment grasp to go. This: though dawn pleasure happiness, also self-power obtain pleasure happiness, grasp not-existing, knowing difference existing, fabricated meditate. Know difference of meditation arriving at nature wind.

[5088-5090] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Fabricated. Natural. Know. Fabricated meditation tries to create bliss. Natural meditation lets bliss arise. The difference is subtle but crucial. Fabricated bliss—you get it and grasp it. Natural bliss—arises and dissolves without grasping. Don't confuse the two.

[5091-5100] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): End change experience: wind experience vision part is—like firefly, like cloud, like smoke, like haze, like moon dawn, like star dawn, like sky brightening, blue vision existing, like sun dawn, outer inner unimpeded vision—eight. Become clear dim and dawn cease cause: not firm, cannot stand, change go—called end change experience, cause is wind moving experience.

[5091-5100] Voice 13 (Patrul): Eight signs of changing experience. First like a firefly—flickering, uncertain. Then like clouds—moving, forming, dissolving. Then smoke—rising, dispersing. Then haze—obscuring, clearing. Then the moon rising—gentle, soft. Then stars—many, scattered. Then the sky brightening—blue appearing. Then the sun—everything illuminated. These are the stages of wind experience. They change. They don't stay. Know them as wind moving.

[5101-5106] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): These do existing, need purify wind mind. Vision experience is: great awareness self-resonance luminous-clear. Occasion: outer vision increases, from arriving at measure; self-resonance dissolves into base, reverse inner, only outer clear need; cause need dissolve into spontaneous-completion pure dhatu. Inner clear: in self-light expanse, awareness body wisdom palace, originally abide spontaneous-completion great, not-existing change. Therefore here: vision experience is chief.

[5101-5106] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): These changing experiences arise because the wind-mind is still moving. Purify the wind-mind. The vision experience is different—it is the great awareness self-radiant, luminous-clear. The outer visions increase, then self-radiance dissolves back into the base. The inner becomes clear. The change stops. This is vision experience—the chief experience in dzogchen.

[5107-5113] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Knowing experience: is intellect, change, cannot stand measure, all-conceptual conventional appearance possessor, remember doer difference, near-side concept gather cause. Do measure this: similar to bird doing hide cover, place measure in cloud. Time not existing to realize meaning, see self-point not arrive. Wherein, this: vision experience, see wisdom five color vision, transcend half end of samsara action, grasp field vision. See dhatu vision: that above, not existing grasp concept part half, grasp empty extreme wrong cause, transcend two-thirds samsara part.

[5107-5113] Voice 13 (Patrul): Knowing experience is different. It is conceptual, changing, unstable—like hiding a bird in a cloud. You can't find it. You can't measure it. It's the conceptual mind trying to understand what is beyond concept. Vision experience is direct—wisdom's five colors, the dhatu vision, free from grasping. Don't confuse knowing with seeing.

[5114-5124] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Self-purify all-concept base ground, grasp part half, grasp vision self-characteristic wrong cause, called person and dharmas grasp-hold self not-existing concept. Briefly: all vision experiences—wisdom five color vision, and dhatu vision, two gather. Above increase is: go those visions more beautiful, more good, more many. General show this purify manner, and particular explain vision manner—two from: First is: apply samsara liberate manner from binding; that vision: up-stand, and wing dawn, and boat-part, and part, and cloth vision—five complete, from obtaining power of wisdom five color. Liberate from binding: five manifest move—desire, aversion, delusion, pride, jealousy. Cause not existing other than latency only, itself transcend samsara half. Then: net form, and net half, and eye many line, and like eye spot form, and see like canopy tent house—transcend from self made by form and so forth aggregate five collection. Transcend world self three two, pure blessing of dharmata view.

[5114-5124] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Liberate. Transcend. Rest. All vision experiences gather into two: wisdom five-color vision and dhatu vision. These increase in beauty and clarity. The liberation from binding frees the five poisons—desire, aversion, delusion, pride, jealousy. The visions arise like a net, like forms, like many eyes, like spots, like a canopy. They transcend the world, the aggregates, the three realms. The pure blessing of dharmata view remains.

[Final] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Three experiences: fabricated, changing, and vision. Fabricated is grasping. Changing is wind. Vision is the chief. Natural meditation arrives at the nature of wind. The five colors arise. The dhatu becomes clear. The path is complete.

Emaho! The eight changing experiences! The five-color wisdom vision! The dhatu vision beyond all concept!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching. What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. See what is. Rest in recognition.
