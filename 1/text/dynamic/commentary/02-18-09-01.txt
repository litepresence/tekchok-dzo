[5085-5141] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, body-speech crucial point pressed, wind-mind relaxed, inside samadhi clear light empty nature expands, knowing relaxed grasping-free bliss-joy vast hollow-born, attachment grasping hair-tip none, nature's meditation crucial point arrived from. Fabricated meditation bliss-joy arise, experience change much, coarse movement or desire to sing-dance arise, attachment grasped.

[5085-5141] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Crucial. Point. Stop. You think pressing the crucial point is force. It is the recognition of what was never unpressed. The bliss-joy that arises naturally is not the same as fabricated bliss. Know the difference.

[5085-5141] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man knows fabricated bliss! Feels good, feels spiritual, wants to sing and dance. But it's still attachment. Natural bliss—vast, hollow, relaxed. No grasping, no attachment. Like the sky holding clouds without keeping them.

[5092-5111] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Finally changing experience: wind experience appearance aspect, firefly-like, cloud-like, smoke-like, mirage-like, moon-rising-like, star-rising-like, dawn-breaking-like, blue appearance. Arising-ceasing and clear-dim happening, unstable cannot hold, changing-going, finally changing experience called, wind moving experience because. These fabricated, wind-mind pure need.

[5092-5111] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Changing. Experience. Stop. You think something is wrong when experiences change. Change is their nature. Fireflies, clouds, smoke—they appear and disappear. Don't try to hold them. Let them go.

[5112-5141] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Appearance experience: rigpa's self-radiance clear light great. Occasionally outer appearance increasing, measure arrived, self-radiance basis dissolves, inside reverses, outer clarity must dissolve, spontaneous primordially pure sphere dissolves need. Inside clear self-light expanse, rigpa body-wisdom palace originally abides spontaneous great, change transformation none.

[Final] Three experiences: knowing, finally changing, appearance. Press the crucial point. Natural meditation arises. Don't confuse fabricated bliss with natural bliss. Let experiences arise and dissolve.

Emaho! The three experiences of meditation!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
