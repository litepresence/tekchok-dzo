First: Thus various appearing aspects without an apparent measurer—mere clear appearance. Moreover, in ultimate truth, self-aware wisdom also lacks inherent essence.

[1]
Appearances arise—colors, shapes, sounds. But the measurer doesn't appear. Just clarity, empty of seer and seen. Like a mirror reflecting without a reflector. Like space containing without a container.

This mountain hermit once sought the measurer. Looked behind thoughts, beneath awareness, within the looking itself. Found nothing. The nothing was full. The absence was presence.

Attend. Recognize. Liberate.

Even wisdom is empty by nature. The knowing knows nothing. The awareness is aware of no thing. This is the subtle point where many stumble—taking wisdom as a thing, taking awareness as an entity.

On this, divisions: those who assert illusion as ultimate, and those who completely non-abide.

[1]
Illusion as ultimate: everything is like a dream, like magic. The appearance is the magic. The magic is empty. The emptiness is the magic. This view liberates from grasping but can become a new grasping.

[1]
Completely non-abiding: not even abiding in illusion, not even asserting magic. Beyond assertion and denial. Beyond ultimate and conventional. This is the Dzogchen view—unfindable, ungraspable, beyond all positions.
