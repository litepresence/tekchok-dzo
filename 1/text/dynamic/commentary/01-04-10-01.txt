First: Thus various appearing aspects without an apparent measurer—mere clear appearance. Moreover, in ultimate truth, self-aware wisdom also lacks inherent essence.

[3037]
Appearances arise—colors, shapes, sounds. But the measurer doesn't appear. Just clarity, empty of seer and seen. Like a mirror reflecting without a reflector. Like space containing without a container.

[3037]
This mountain hermit once sought the measurer. Looked behind thoughts, beneath awareness, within the looking itself. Found nothing. The nothing was full. The absence was presence.

[3037]
Attend. Recognize. Liberate.

[3037]
Even wisdom is empty by nature. The knowing knows nothing. The awareness is aware of no thing. This is the subtle point where many stumble—taking wisdom as a thing, taking awareness as an entity.

[3038-3039]
On this, divisions: those who assert illusion as ultimate, and those who completely non-abide.

[3038]
Illusion as ultimate: everything is like a dream, like magic. The appearance is the magic. The magic is empty. The emptiness is the magic. This view liberates from grasping but can become a new grasping.

[3039]
Completely non-abiding: not even abiding in illusion, not even asserting magic. Beyond assertion and denial. Beyond ultimate and conventional. This is the Dzogchen view—unfindable, ungraspable, beyond all positions.

[3037-3039]
Two paths, both mistaken—if clung to. The first mistakes the finger for the moon. The second mistakes the rejection of fingers for the moon itself. Both are provisional. Both point.

[3037-3039]
Between illusion and non-abiding lies the nature that is neither. Not asserting, not denying. Not accepting, not rejecting. The middle way that is not a middle way.

[3037-3039]
This old fool once thought he understood emptiness. Spoke of it eloquently. Then he recognized: the understanding was the obstacle. The eloquence was the veil. Emptiness cannot be understood. It can only be lived.

[3037-3039]
I have taught these subtle distinctions to those who cling to views. But the truth is viewless. The nature is beyond all assertions, including the assertion of beyondness.

[3037-3039]
Thus. The analysis concludes: clarity without measurer, wisdom without essence, two mistaken paths. The Treasury opens what analysis cannot close.

[3037-3039]
Emaho! The wisdom that knows nothing!

[3037-3039]
Rest in the clarity. Rest in the emptiness. Rest in the nature that transcends both.
