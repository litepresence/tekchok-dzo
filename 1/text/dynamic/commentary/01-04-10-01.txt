[3037-3039] First: various appearances appear, aspects and measurers non-apparent, merely clarity. In ultimate truth, self-aware wisdom is non-existent by essence. Two: those who assert illusion as ultimate, and those completely non-abiding.

[3037-3039] Appearances arise—forms, sounds. But the measurer doesn't appear. Just clarity, empty of seer and seen. Even wisdom is empty. Two errors: illusion as ultimate, or non-abiding as view.

[3037-3039] Three words. Clarity. Empty. Two.

[Final] Appearances arise. Clarity empty. Wisdom empty. Two paths, both mistaken.

Emaho!
