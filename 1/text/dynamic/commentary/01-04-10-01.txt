First: Thus various appearing aspects without an apparent measurer—mere clear appearance. Moreover, in ultimate truth, self-aware wisdom also lacks inherent essence.

[1]
Appearances arise—colors, shapes, sounds. But the measurer doesn't appear. Just clarity, empty of seer and seen. Like a mirror reflecting without a reflector. Like space containing without a container.

[1]
This mountain hermit once sought the measurer. Looked behind thoughts, beneath awareness, within the looking itself. Found nothing. The nothing was full. The absence was presence.

[1]
Attend. Recognize. Liberate.

[1]
Even wisdom is empty by nature. The knowing knows nothing. The awareness is aware of no thing. This is the subtle point where many stumble—taking wisdom as a thing, taking awareness as an entity.

On this, divisions: those who assert illusion as ultimate, and those who completely non-abide.

[1]
Illusion as ultimate: everything is like a dream, like magic. The appearance is the magic. The magic is empty. The emptiness is the magic. This view liberates from grasping but can become a new grasping.

[1]
Completely non-abiding: not even abiding in illusion, not even asserting magic. Beyond assertion and denial. Beyond ultimate and conventional. This is the Dzogchen view—unfindable, ungraspable, beyond all positions.

Two paths, both mistaken—if clung to. The first mistakes the finger for the moon. The second mistakes the rejection of fingers for the moon itself. Both are provisional. Both point.

[1-3]
Between illusion and non-abiding lies the nature that is neither. Not asserting, not denying. Not accepting, not rejecting. The middle way that is not a middle way.

This old fool once thought he understood emptiness. Spoke of it eloquently. Then he recognized: the understanding was the obstacle. The eloquence was the veil. Emptiness cannot be understood. It can only be lived.

[1-3]
I have taught these subtle distinctions to those who cling to views. But the truth is viewless. The nature is beyond all assertions, including the assertion of beyondness.

[1-3]
Thus. The analysis concludes: clarity without measurer, wisdom without essence, two mistaken paths. The Treasury opens what analysis cannot close.

[1-3]
Emaho! The wisdom that knows nothing!

[1-3]
Rest in the clarity. Rest in the emptiness. Rest in the nature that transcends both.
