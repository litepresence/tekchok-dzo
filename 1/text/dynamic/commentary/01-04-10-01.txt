Thus, various appearances appear— aspects and measurers non-apparent, merely clarity. In ultimate truth, not only the self-aware wisdom of one's own nature is non-existent by its very essence.

In this, there is division: those who assert illusion as ultimate, and those who are completely non-abiding—these two.

The Middle Way school, even within the Autonomous branch, divides further. Some assert illusion-like nature as ultimate truth. Others go further—complete non-abiding.

Beyond Mind-Only's self-awareness—the Middle Way opens like infinite sky. Various appearances, yet aspects and measurers unapparent. Merely clarity, yet not even that is established ultimately.

Illusion as ultimate? A step beyond. Completely non-abiding? Further still. Like waves recognizing they are water, yet the water itself has no essence to grasp.

This mountain hermit. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

The Autonomous Middle-Way school says: like illusion, phenomena appear but have no essence. A middle ground between existence and non-existence.

But some say even "illusion" is too much to assert. Like saying "this mirage is water"—even "mirage" is a concept. Cut even that!

See what is. Rest in recognition. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Various appearances. Non-apparent aspects. Merely clarity. Not established ultimately.

Illusion as ultimate? Non-abiding? Both positions. Both views. See through both.

Break through. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Appearances without essence! Clarity without establishment! Illusion as ultimate—CUT! Completely non-abiding—CUT!

Where is the cutter? Where the cut?

 What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.
