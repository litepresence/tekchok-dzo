The third point extensively explains the fivefold doctrine's wheel of wisdom in three parts: essence briefly shown, nature extensively explained.
aspects gathering meaning. This is the treasury's heart.

Concepts point but cannot capture—mind's nature shines directly.

Not something to understand—awareness recognizing itself.

First: from Sengé Tsal Dzogchen, what are the five doctrines? With Mountain Summit Gathering's doctrine, view for meditation. With Wisdom Pouring's doctrine, ground to be taken. With Thigle Seeing Aperture's doctrine, examine display's arising. With Sun Moon Equal Measure's doctrine, carry meaning to its end. With Ocean Depths Opening's doctrine, carry rigpa to the expanse.

The first's nature is Mah Dzogchen's changeless clear light rigpa, dharma-expanse and wisdom non-dual. When faculties realize this, three individual faculties—excellent, middling, lesser—have view, meditation, conduct, result each fourfold, making twelve aspects. From Tsal Dzog: "When Mountain Summit Gathering's doctrine dawns, Dzogchen view complete, excellent middling lesser faculties' views arise threefold. Excellent faculty's view: wisdom display spontaneously arising—own wisdom realizes non-conceptual rigpa with body. Meditation: unmoving in clarity like ocean's planets and stars. Conduct: ceaseless spontaneous like sky's meteor. Result: seeing unborn self-arisen display."

Middling faculty's view realizes rigpa merely unborn. Meditation: like cloth floating on ocean, free from conceptual aspects. Conduct: unfabricated lunatic conduct, unimpeded in any display. Result: possessing self-abiding meditation through suppressing signs. Lesser faculty's view realizes displays as magical illusions or emanations. Meditation: like a lion cub separated from womb, recognizing own display, wisdom dawns in bardo, seeing enclosed wisdom. Conduct: possessing samsara-nirvana dualistic conduct. Result: leaving body, going to natural emanation body's pure land. Thus twelve aspects from three faculties' fourfold divisions.

Emaho!

The second Wisdom Pouring doctrine's nature is realizing rigpa's potency power perfected from the start. The three faculties' different realizations: From that same text—"When Wisdom Pouring's doctrine arises, again excellent middling lesser persons' views arise threefold. Excellent one's view realizes empowerment itself as unborn result, self-established. Meditation: through wisdom's application expanding bindus, great bliss space-equal meditation unmoved. Conduct: bodhicitta white-red without pure impure. Result: seeing buddha families' suchness."

Sun Moon Equal Measure doctrine's nature: realizing appearance-emptiness exhaustion-equal non-duality. Differentiated by faculty: From Tsal Dzog—"When Sun Moon Equal Measure's doctrine overflows, excellent middling lesser have three seeing aspects. Excellent view realizes wisdom zangthal. Meditation: inseparable from unceasing wisdom river. Conduct: great wisdom conduct playing ceaselessly. Result: attainment of method-wisdom joining, two liberations—four aspects without separation."

Middling faculty's view realizes display becoming rigpa's power. Meditation: unmoving clarity like sun and moon connected. Conduct: correctly abiding in dharmata yoga conduct. Result: attaining unborn suchness. Lesser faculty's view realizes empowerment's qualities expanding. Meditation: relying on deity body with marks. Conduct: acting in dharmata's play. Result: attaining buddhahood through qualities.

Middling three aspects: view realizes method-wisdom non-dual. Meditation: abiding in method-wisdom's nature like sun-moon in space. Conduct: enjoying great bliss secret bindu white-red. Result: attaining buddha families' five joining practice womb buddhahood. Lesser three aspects: view realizes father-mother joining bodhicitta lake-symbol view. Meditation: deity's nature essence remembered, abiding in clear samadhi. Conduct: enjoying five medicines, five nectars. Result: attaining pure display result, intermediate state taking yidam deity's illusory body.

The third Thigle Seeing Aperture doctrine's nature: bardo's self-arisen wisdom rigpa realizing own display's seeing as self-rigpa, thus awakening. Differentiated by person's faculty: From that—"When Thigle Seeing Aperture's doctrine dawns, excellent middling lesser have three different seeing aspects. Excellent view: like meteors racing in sky, wisdom potency arising as qualities, realizing liberation in three instants. Meditation: like sun rising in space, clarity all-pervasive. Conduct: enjoying wisdom body's pure forms. Result: in three instants, buddha in kadag ground."

The fifth Ocean Depths Opening doctrine's nature: abiding in equal-pure dharmata natural potency spontaneous meditation. Differentiated by faculties: From Tsal Dzog—"When Ocean Depths Opening's doctrine, excellent middling lesser have three seeing aspects. Excellent view: whatever appears is own display—realizing great wisdom's activity. Meditation: less attachment to displays, like being intoxicated with alcohol. Conduct: acting in samsara and nirvana. Result: attaining wisdom arising one-pointedly without abiding in displays."

Listen well, dear practitioner! Sense-power middle view sign three: view clear open wisdom-of body realize! Intention fierce-in duration short waterfall like-with endowed! Conduct all-of conduct-object not-is, awareness-vision like conduct-object-with endowed! Fruit empty wisdom heart-essence-to end reach certainty obtain!

Sense-power last view sign three: view delusion-of appear gap-by abandon desire! Intention god-and human mind hold-in abide! Conduct fabricated two grasp conduct-with endowed! Fruit god-and human status obtain—thus!

Third aspect meaning summarize: intention five that-by secret heart-essence yogin all bind having, yogin experience arise! Mountain general-meaning-by great-perfect view, high-low-and slack tight without equal view transcend! Wisdom general-fill-by that manner-in self-abide Dharma-nature ground grasp!

Third-by pure space reach, peacock chick egg-from emerge like! Four-by all-equal vast great expand, sun-moon two without equal like! Five-by self-appear wisdom clear, mountain neck-from sun arise like intention, bindu supreme secret supreme meaning gather establish!

Emaho! Five intentions of the secret essence!

Middling view: realizing dharmata's great bliss unexcelled clear display increasing. Meditation: each instant seeing superior objects, superior realization arising each instant, seeing dharma body displays each instant, abiding in heart's suchness pure meditation. Conduct: own heart's light-ray non-dual enjoyment. Result: seeing rigpa's display as unborn dharma body. Lesser view: realizing pure wisdom display, thinking 'from there I arose' or 'I arose from there.' Meditation: abiding in that display without seer. Conduct: possessing doubt and uncertainty conduct. Result: attaining natural emanation body's pure land.

Emaho!

Middling three aspects: view realizes clarity zangthal wisdom body. Meditation: having forceful short duration like waterfall. Conduct: possessing non-common conduct like deer-conduct. Result: attaining final certainty, reaching wisdom essence. Lesser three aspects: view wishes to abandon deluded display gradually. Meditation: abiding in god and human mind-holding. Conduct: possessing artificial dualistic grasping conduct. Result: attaining god and human status. These five doctrines bind all Secret Heart Essence yogins—Mountain Summit for view, Wisdom Pouring for ground, Thigle for examining liberation, Sun Moon for carrying to exhaustion, Ocean for carrying to kadag ground.

Emaho!

From Sengé Tsal Dzogchen: "Mountain Summit Gathering doctrine is like lion's playful posture. Wisdom Pouring doctrine is like royal empowerment at the crown. Thigle Seeing Aperture doctrine is like peacock chick hatching from egg. Sun Moon Equal Measure doctrine is like sun and moon non-dually entering. Ocean Depths Opening doctrine is like sun rising from Meru's neck."

Listen, fortunate one! Lion Power-Perfect from: mountain general-meaning intention—lion play like! Wisdom general-fill intention—king race head-from empowerment like! Bindu range-penetrate intention—peacock chick egg-from emerge like! Sun-moon gap-equal intention—sun-and moon two-from without equal enter like! Ocean expanse-penetrate intention—mountain neck-from sun arise like—thus! Like-that aspiration five each-each-to sense-power three-as separate, fifteen each-each-to view intention conduct fruit four-four-as separate! Dharma enumeration sixty become, eon increase-decrease-and sentient-being affliction-and view enumeration sixty purify having! Wisdom nature experience take pure complete demonstrate, Vajra-Holder speak! ### CITATION: Supreme Vehicle Treasury from! Spontaneous leap-over wisdom experience take essential-point establish chapter twenty! Like-that guidance method-by experience take method all demonstrate having!

Thus each of these five supplications differentiated by three faculties makes fifteen, each with view-meditation-conduct-result fourfold makes sixty dharmas—purifying kalpa's evolution-devolution, sentient beings' afflictions.
views' sixty variations, showing pure nature through practicing wisdom. The Sugata Vajradhara spoke thus.

[02-20-08-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

A meditator has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking.
what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present.
future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path.
result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct.
result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace.
all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
