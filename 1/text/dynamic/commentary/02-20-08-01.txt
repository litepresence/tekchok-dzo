The third point extensively explains the fivefold doctrine's wheel of wisdom in three parts: essence briefly shown, nature extensively explained, and aspects gathering meaning. This is the treasury's heart.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[9228-9241]
First: from Sengé Tsal Dzogchen, what are the five doctrines? With Mountain Summit Gathering's doctrine, view for meditation. With Wisdom Pouring's doctrine, ground to be taken. With Thigle Seeing Aperture's doctrine, examine display's arising. With Sun Moon Equal Measure's doctrine, carry meaning to its end. With Ocean Depths Opening's doctrine, carry rigpa to the expanse.

[9242-9267]
The first's nature is Mah Dzogchen's changeless clear light rigpa, dharma-expanse and wisdom non-dual. When faculties realize this, three individual faculties—excellent, middling, lesser—have view, meditation, conduct, result each fourfold, making twelve aspects. From Tsal Dzog: "When Mountain Summit Gathering's doctrine dawns, Dzogchen view complete, excellent middling lesser faculties' views arise threefold. Excellent faculty's view: wisdom display spontaneously arising—own wisdom realizes non-conceptual rigpa with body. Meditation: unmoving in clarity like ocean's planets and stars. Conduct: ceaseless spontaneous like sky's meteor. Result: seeing unborn self-arisen display."

[9268-9304]
Middling faculty's view realizes rigpa merely unborn. Meditation: like cloth floating on ocean, free from conceptual aspects. Conduct: unfabricated lunatic conduct, unimpeded in any display. Result: possessing self-abiding meditation through suppressing signs. Lesser faculty's view realizes displays as magical illusions or emanations. Meditation: like a lion cub separated from womb, recognizing own display, wisdom dawns in bardo, seeing enclosed wisdom. Conduct: possessing samsara-nirvana dualistic conduct. Result: leaving body, going to natural emanation body's pure land. Thus twelve aspects from three faculties' fourfold divisions.

Emaho!

[9305-9327]
The second Wisdom Pouring doctrine's nature is realizing rigpa's potency power perfected from the start. The three faculties' different realizations: From that same text—"When Wisdom Pouring's doctrine arises, again excellent middling lesser persons' views arise threefold. Excellent one's view realizes empowerment itself as unborn result, self-established. Meditation: through wisdom's application expanding bindus, great bliss space-equal meditation unmoved. Conduct: bodhicitta white-red without pure impure. Result: seeing buddha families' suchness."

[9315-9332]
Sun Moon Equal Measure doctrine's nature: realizing appearance-emptiness exhaustion-equal non-duality. Differentiated by faculty: From Tsal Dzog—"When Sun Moon Equal Measure's doctrine overflows, excellent middling lesser have three seeing aspects. Excellent view realizes wisdom zangthal. Meditation: inseparable from unceasing wisdom river. Conduct: great wisdom conduct playing ceaselessly. Result: attainment of method-wisdom joining, two liberations—four aspects without separation."

[9328-9341]
Middling faculty's view realizes display becoming rigpa's power. Meditation: unmoving clarity like sun and moon connected. Conduct: correctly abiding in dharmata yoga conduct. Result: attaining unborn suchness. Lesser faculty's view realizes empowerment's qualities expanding. Meditation: relying on deity body with marks. Conduct: acting in dharmata's play. Result: attaining buddhahood through qualities.

[9333-9341]
Middling three aspects: view realizes method-wisdom non-dual. Meditation: abiding in method-wisdom's nature like sun-moon in space. Conduct: enjoying great bliss secret bindu white-red. Result: attaining buddha families' five joining practice womb buddhahood. Lesser three aspects: view realizes father-mother joining bodhicitta lake-symbol view. Meditation: deity's nature essence remembered, abiding in clear samadhi. Conduct: enjoying five medicines, five nectars. Result: attaining pure display result, intermediate state taking yidam deity's illusory body.

[9342-9371]
The third Thigle Seeing Aperture doctrine's nature: bardo's self-arisen wisdom rigpa realizing own display's seeing as self-rigpa, thus awakening. Differentiated by person's faculty: From that—"When Thigle Seeing Aperture's doctrine dawns, excellent middling lesser have three different seeing aspects. Excellent view: like meteors racing in sky, wisdom potency arising as qualities, realizing liberation in three instants. Meditation: like sun rising in space, clarity all-pervasive. Conduct: enjoying wisdom body's pure forms. Result: in three instants, buddha in kadag ground."

[9342-9371]
The fifth Ocean Depths Opening doctrine's nature: abiding in equal-pure dharmata natural potency spontaneous meditation. Differentiated by faculties: From Tsal Dzog—"When Ocean Depths Opening's doctrine, excellent middling lesser have three seeing aspects. Excellent view: whatever appears is own display—realizing great wisdom's activity. Meditation: less attachment to displays, like being intoxicated with alcohol. Conduct: acting in samsara and nirvana. Result: attaining wisdom arising one-pointedly without abiding in displays."

[9353-9384]
Listen well, dear practitioner! Sense-power middle view sign three: view clear open wisdom-of body realize! Intention fierce-in duration short waterfall like-with endowed! Conduct all-of conduct-object not-is, awareness-vision like conduct-object-with endowed! Fruit empty wisdom heart-essence-to end reach certainty obtain!

Sense-power last view sign three: view delusion-of appear gap-by abandon desire! Intention god-and human mind hold-in abide! Conduct fabricated two grasp conduct-with endowed! Fruit god-and human status obtain—thus!

Third aspect meaning summarize: intention five that-by secret heart-essence yogin all bind having, yogin experience arise! Mountain general-meaning-by great-perfect view, high-low-and slack tight without equal view transcend! Wisdom general-fill-by that manner-in self-abide Dharma-nature ground grasp! Bindu range-penetrate-by space-appear-from awareness liberate manner examine! Sun-moon gap-equal-by intention Dharma-cease expanse deliver! Ocean expanse-penetrate-by space-awareness primordially-pure ground-at stable ground hold!

Also first view-by high wash having, delusion-appear fear conquer, lion play like! Second-by self-power Dharma-nature obtain, king-awareness empowerment like! Third-by pure space reach, peacock chick egg-from emerge like! Four-by all-equal vast great expand, sun-moon two without equal like! Five-by self-appear wisdom clear, mountain neck-from sun arise like intention, bindu supreme secret supreme meaning gather establish!

Emaho! Five intentions of the secret essence!

[9372-9402]
Middling view: realizing dharmata's great bliss unexcelled clear display increasing. Meditation: each instant seeing superior objects, superior realization arising each instant, seeing dharma body displays each instant, abiding in heart's suchness pure meditation. Conduct: own heart's light-ray non-dual enjoyment. Result: seeing rigpa's display as unborn dharma body. Lesser view: realizing pure wisdom display, thinking 'from there I arose' or 'I arose from there.' Meditation: abiding in that display without seer. Conduct: possessing doubt and uncertainty conduct. Result: attaining natural emanation body's pure land.

Emaho!

[9372-9384]
Middling three aspects: view realizes clarity zangthal wisdom body. Meditation: having forceful short duration like waterfall. Conduct: possessing non-common conduct like deer-conduct. Result: attaining final certainty, reaching wisdom essence. Lesser three aspects: view wishes to abandon deluded display gradually. Meditation: abiding in god and human mind-holding. Conduct: possessing artificial dualistic grasping conduct. Result: attaining god and human status. These five doctrines bind all Secret Heart Essence yogins—Mountain Summit for view, Wisdom Pouring for ground, Thigle for examining liberation, Sun Moon for carrying to exhaustion, Ocean for carrying to kadag ground.

Emaho!

[9385-9395]
From Sengé Tsal Dzogchen: "Mountain Summit Gathering doctrine is like lion's playful posture. Wisdom Pouring doctrine is like royal empowerment at the crown. Thigle Seeing Aperture doctrine is like peacock chick hatching from egg. Sun Moon Equal Measure doctrine is like sun and moon non-dually entering. Ocean Depths Opening doctrine is like sun rising from Meru's neck."

[9385-9403]
Listen, fortunate one! Lion Power-Perfect from: mountain general-meaning intention—lion play like! Wisdom general-fill intention—king race head-from empowerment like! Bindu range-penetrate intention—peacock chick egg-from emerge like! Sun-moon gap-equal intention—sun-and moon two-from without equal enter like! Ocean expanse-penetrate intention—mountain neck-from sun arise like—thus! Like-that aspiration five each-each-to sense-power three-as separate, fifteen each-each-to view intention conduct fruit four-four-as separate! Dharma enumeration sixty become, eon increase-decrease-and sentient-being affliction-and view enumeration sixty purify having! Wisdom nature experience take pure complete demonstrate, Vajra-Holder speak! ### CITATION: Supreme Vehicle Treasury from! Spontaneous leap-over wisdom experience take essential-point establish chapter twenty! Like-that guidance method-by experience take method all demonstrate having!

[9396-9403]
Thus each of these five supplications differentiated by three faculties makes fifteen, each with view-meditation-conduct-result fourfold makes sixty dharmas—purifying kalpa's evolution-devolution, sentient beings' afflictions, and views' sixty variations, showing pure nature through practicing wisdom. The Sugata Vajradhara spoke thus.
