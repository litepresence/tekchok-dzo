Fourth: thousand suns' Victorious One. Light upon light, each sun a complete awakening, each awakening illuminating countless fields. The Victorious One is not one who conquers.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. The Victorious One is one who has seen there was never a battle. The thousand suns rise in the sky of a single mind. They do not compete. They complete each other.

[6421-6421]
An old practitioner once tried to gaze at these thousand suns. He was blinded by the first. In that blindness, he understood: the suns are not for looking at. They are for recognizing as one's own nature. The Victorious One does not illuminate outside. The Victorious One recognizes illumination as self.

See your nature. Rest. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[6421-6421]
The framework reveals. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[6421-6421]
Between the thousand suns and the recognition that transcends all light, the treasury continues. Not rejecting the illumination. Not grasping it. The light points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6421-6421]
This yogi. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[6421-6421]
Break through. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[6421-6421]
Analysis proceeds. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[6421-6421]
See what is. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[6421-6421]
An old practitioner once asked: "Who is defeated in this victory?" The answer came like lightning: no one. There was never any battle. The thousand suns were never at war. The illumination was never opposed. All was awareness, playing at victory and defeat.

[6421-6421]
Thus. We proceed. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[6421-6421]
Cut! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[Final] Three words complete.
Each word points beyond itself to direct experience. Rest in this understanding.
