[6421-6421]
Fourth field—thousand suns Victorious. Not a place, but a way of seeing.
Like a mountain lake at dawn—surface holds everything without adding or
taking. The Victorious One's display, not separate from the seer.

[6421-6421]
This old wanderer watched shadows on cave walls. Light struck differently
each morning—sharp as blade, soft as breath. Learning about the wall that
receives it. Thousand suns, one surface.

[6421-6421]
Victory without struggle. Awareness itself—already complete. Like mirror
reflecting lamps without becoming warm. The Victorious One is not a being
among beings.

[6421-6421]
See directly. Recognition dawns without subject or object—this is the
thousand suns. Don't seek the field. Be the seeing.

[6421-6421]
Recognition. Victory. Rest. Three words my teacher gave me before he left.
That's all. Nothing else required.
