Tenth: attainment of the dharma-cloud-like ground. Obtaining without abandoning this very shell of truth-vision. Those who abandon the shell obtain thus. Delusion-vision ceases, dawns as heap-vision—this is the eleventh: attainment of the universal light ground.

A practitioner once thought he needed to traverse all sixteen grounds to reach Buddhahood. He spent years analyzing each ground, comparing his experience to the descriptions. Finally, he understood: the grounds are not destinations but descriptions of recognition. Like prayer flags describing the wind—the flags are not the wind, and analyzing them won't make you feel the breeze.

Then, not attaching even to that vision, unstained by all outer-inner dharmas—twelfth: attainment of the non-attaching lotus-possessing ground. Then, from the self-heart, wisdom-ray lines dawning, from sky-space, five light-heaps abiding in wheel-manner—thirteenth: attainment of the great collection wheel of letters ground.

Mountain hermit near a high plateau lake watched the moon rise over the water. "Each ground," he thought, "is like a ripple on the lake—appearing, abiding, dissolving. The sixteenth ground is not the last ripple but the recognition that all ripples are water."

Then, abiding in wisdom-vision is the fourteenth: attainment of the great samadhi ground. Then, certainty obtained at spontaneously-accomplished ground is the fifteenth: attainment of the vajra-holder ground. Then, wisdom naturally dawning at primordially-pure ground, without anything above that—sixteenth: attainment of the wisdom-guru ground. Those are applied through similar aspects of vision-manner; they are not the actual ten bodhisattva grounds.

Between the elaborate enumeration of grounds and the direct recognition of awareness-luminosity, we find the vast middle way. The grounds describe recognition; they do not create it. Like a map describing a mountain—the map is useful but not the mountain.

Those grounds also: divisions from the vision-aspect of one ground—awareness-luminosity without purifying or traversing. In meaning, it is one awareness-ground. For obtaining Buddha Vajradhara, specific causal grounds are not needed, for they are applied to different entry-doors of path-essentials.

This wandering yogi met a scholar who had memorized all sixteen grounds. "Which ground are you on?" the scholar asked. The yogi laughed. "I am on the ground that was never divided. The ground that needs no traversing. The ground that is recognition itself."

The manner of obtaining each ground through cause-result sequence, like common ones, and mantra outer-inner generation-completion effort-accomplishment grounds obtained without needing purification. From the Kun byed: "Awareness spontaneously complete, not transformed, not purified." Thus it is.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why count the grounds? Why analyze the stages? Awareness is spontaneously complete! Not transformed, not purified! Recognize this, and all sixteen grounds are simultaneously present!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you walk, while you rest, maintain the recognition that no ground needs traversing. Daily life is the only ground. This moment is the complete accomplishment.

Final instruction: the sixteen grounds are descriptions of recognition, not rungs on a ladder. You do not climb from first to sixteenth. You recognize that the ground you stand on is the sixteenth ground. The first and sixteenth are not different. Rest in that recognition.

Emaho! The wonder of spontaneously complete awareness, not transformed, not purified. May all beings recognize their nature as Vajradhara, primordially pure, naturally abiding on the ground that was never divided.
