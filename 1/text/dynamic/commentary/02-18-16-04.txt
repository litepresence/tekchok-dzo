Tenth: attainment of the dharma-cloud-like ground. Obtaining without abandoning this very shell of truth-vision. Those who abandon the shell obtain thus. Delusion-vision ceases, dawns as heap-vision—this is the eleventh: attainment of the universal light ground.

[5934-5939]
Then, not attaching even to that vision, unstained by all outer-inner dharmas—twelfth: attainment of the non-attaching lotus-possessing ground. Then, from the self-heart, wisdom-ray lines dawning, from sky-space, five light-heaps abiding in wheel-manner—thirteenth: attainment of the great collection wheel of letters ground.

[5940-5946]
Then, abiding in wisdom-vision is the fourteenth: attainment of the great samadhi ground. Then, certainty obtained at spontaneously-accomplished ground is the fifteenth: attainment of the vajra-holder ground. Then, wisdom naturally dawning at primordially-pure ground, without anything above that—sixteenth: attainment of the wisdom-guru ground. Those are applied through similar aspects of vision-manner; they are not the actual ten bodhisattva grounds.

[5947-5953]
Those grounds also: divisions from the vision-aspect of one ground—awareness-luminosity without purifying or traversing. In meaning, it is one awareness-ground. For obtaining Buddha Vajradhara, specific causal grounds are not needed, for they are applied to different entry-doors of path-essentials.

[5954-5962]
The manner of obtaining each ground through cause-result sequence, like common ones, and mantra outer-inner generation-completion effort-accomplishment grounds obtained without needing purification. From the Kun byed: "Awareness spontaneously complete, not transformed, not purified." Thus it is.
