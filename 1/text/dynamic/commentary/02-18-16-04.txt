[5928-5933] Tenth: attainment of the dharma-cloud-like ground. Obtaining without abandoning this very shell of truth-vision. Those who abandon the shell obtain thus. Delusion-vision ceases, dawns as heap-vision—this is the eleventh: attainment of the universal light ground.

[5928-5933] Here's a secret—don't abandon the shell! Those who think they must discard something to get somewhere are chasing shadows. The shell of truth-vision is not an obstacle. It is the path itself wearing a coat.

[5934-5939] Then, not attaching even to that vision, unstained by all outer-inner dharmas—twelfth: attainment of the non-attaching lotus-possessing ground. Then, from the self-heart, wisdom-ray lines dawning, from sky-space, five light-heaps abiding in wheel-manner—thirteenth: attainment of the great collection wheel of letters ground.

[5934-5939] Three words. Non-attaching. Lotus. Rest. The lotus grows from mud but is not mud. Your wisdom rises from samsara but is not samsara. See this and the wheel turns itself.

[5940-5946] Then, abiding in wisdom-vision is the fourteenth: attainment of the great samadhi ground. Then, certainty obtained at spontaneously-accomplished ground is the fifteenth: attainment of the vajra-holder ground. Then, wisdom naturally dawning at primordially-pure ground, without anything above that—sixteenth: attainment of the wisdom-guru ground. Those are applied through similar aspects of vision-manner; they are not the actual ten bodhisattva grounds.

[5940-5946] Look at these sixteen grounds. Where does one end and another begin? The looking itself is the ground. The one who looks is the one looked for. There is no boundary between attainment and recognition.

[5947-5953] Those grounds also: divisions from the vision-aspect of one ground—awareness-luminosity without purifying or traversing. In meaning, it is one awareness-ground. For obtaining Buddha Vajradhara, specific causal grounds are not needed, for they are applied to different entry-doors of path-essentials.

[5947-5953] You don't need to become a bodhisattva of ten grounds first! That's the old way, the gradual way. Dzogchen says: the grounds are just doorways. The room is one. The doorway you enter doesn't change the room you're in.

[5954-5962] The manner of obtaining each ground through cause-result sequence, like common ones, and mantra outer-inner generation-completion effort-accomplishment grounds obtained without needing purification. From the Kun byed: "Awareness spontaneously complete, not transformed, not purified." Thus it is. The path's distinction: for those of supreme faculties, the supreme means of liberating without meditation—bringing certainty to the secret instruction of Trekchö—has three parts: cutting the path through bringing self-essence to the point, binding the summary through cutting connection-words at the point, clearing obstacles through cutting confidence-liberation at the point.

[5954-5962] Three words. Cut. Bind. Clear. The path doesn't go anywhere. You cut through to what's already here. You bind the summary by cutting words. You clear obstacles by cutting confidence. There's nothing to traverse. There's nothing to purify.

[Final] Bringing certainty to the essence, sky-like, beyond accepting, rejecting, action, and effort, in the nature of great perfection. The sixteen grounds are one ground. The one ground is awareness. Awareness is your own face before you were born.

Emaho! Sixteen grounds? One ground! Stop counting and start recognizing!

The sixteen grounds appear like different scenes in one dream. You are the dreamer. The scenes change but you remain. The grounds progress but awareness is always awareness. No attainment adds to what was never lost. The cloud-like ground, the universal light, the lotus without attachment—these are not destinations. They are the journey recognizing itself.

What was spoken here is the unspeakable nature. The words are offered; the recognition is yours. The treasury is complete.
