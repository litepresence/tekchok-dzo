First regarding body—outer, inner, secret. Each has three aspects: outer-outer, inner-outer, secret-outer, and so on, making nine. Not giving outer—not taking what is not given. Sexual misconduct is inner. Taking life is secret. Each violation brings its sign—limb sickness, sense-power disease, organ affliction. The body mandala must be protected like a temple.

One word: Now. You divide your body into nine parts and assign sins to each. Clever! But the body is one. The sin is one. The protection is one. Stop dividing what was never separate.

They obsess over the rules! "Can I eat this? Can I touch that?" This old man says—if your mind is pure, your body is pure. If your mind is impure, even fasting is sin. Nine categories? Just one: don't harm others. That's enough.

The body is the mandala of the deity. Outer—skin and form. Inner—channels and winds. Secret—bindu and essence. Violate the outer, and the deity turns away. Violate the inner, and the channels knot. Violate the secret, and the nectar dries. Guard your mandala, practitioner.

My body is my tool. I plow with it, eat with it, sit with it. When I took samaya, I promised to care for it—not to starve it, not to overindulge it. Nine samayas? I have one: treat this body like a borrowed horse. Use it well, return it in good condition.

Therefore. Accordingly: Body samaya ninefold division: phyi'i phyi (outer-outer)—ma byin len (not giving). phyi'i nang (outer-inner)—mi tshangs spyod (sexual misconduct). phyi'i gsang (outer-secret)—srog gcod (taking life). Precise analysis: each level corresponds to increasing subtlety and gravity of violation.

The body is a guest house. Don't damage the walls. Don't defile the rooms. When the guest leaves, the house remains. When you leave the body, what remains is your samaya with space.

BODY SAMAYAS? *slash* Nine cuts for nine samayas! The body is empty! The sin is empty! The protection is empty! See the nature (rang bzhin) and find NO BODY to protect!

Repair with seven clay images for inner experience, seven custom bodies of the inner deity. For the secret, seven or eleven vajra bells offered to the guru. From the tantra: outer-inner custom body seven, supreme establishment, effort arose, supreme guru to offer. Outer secret signs arisen—vajra and bell, nine or eleven to guru. By that: disease liberation, desire complete, virtue peace deed accomplished, beings kind become.

Look directly: You break it, you fix it. Seven, eleven, nine—numbers for counting. The real repair is recognizing it was never broken. Offer the bell to the guru. The guru is your own awareness. The offering is the recognition.

They love their rituals! "Seven statues, Rinpoche? Or eleven?" This old man has seen them count and recount, afraid of getting it wrong. Fool! The number doesn't matter. The recognition matters. Offer your confusion to the guru. Let him count.

The clay images are your own form, shaped by karma. The deity's custom body is your pure form, shaped by recognition. The vajra bell is your speech, the vajra your mind. Offering eleven bells—offering all your words to wisdom. Offering nine—offering the completion of body, speech, and mind.

I broke my plow last spring. Fixed it with seven nails. Worked fine. The repair ritual is practical—acknowledge the break, fix it, move on. Seven, eleven—just quantities. The quality is what counts.

Therefore. In this way: Repair methodology: lde'u so (clay images)—seven for outer-outer. lugs sku (custom bodies)—seven for outer-inner. rdo rje dril bu (vajra bell)—seven or eleven for outer-secret. Precise analysis: the numerical symbolism—seven represents purification of obscurations, eleven represents completion of the eleven vajra substances.

The repair completes itself when you see the break was illusory. Seven offerings, eleven offerings—all offerings to the space within. The guru receives nothing because nothing was broken.

REPAIR? NOTHING WAS BROKEN! Seven images? Eleven bells? JUST MORE GRASPING! See through the repair and SEE!

Body's inner outer-inner-secret three. From Golden House Stacked Tantra: inner outer—don't disparage siblings, parents, your own body. Inner inner—don't despise Mahayana, Hinayana, those who entered, who hold form-reflection. If you despise, you deceive all Buddhas. Inner secret—your body is the deity's mandala. Don't mix poison with medicine and food. If stabbed by weapon, take body hundred times without outflow path, then experience hot hell.

A single point: You thought outer was enough? Now comes inner. You thought inner was enough? Now comes secret. Layer upon layer, like an onion. Peel it all. Nothing inside. That's the secret.

They criticize others' vehicles! "Hinayana is too small! Mahayana is too big!" This old man says—all vehicles lead up the mountain. The critic sits at the bottom, arguing about the path. The wise one climbs.

Your body is the mandala. Not just symbolically. Actually. Every cell a deity. Every hair a flame. Poison your body, you poison the deity. Stab your body, you stab the deity. The hell that follows is not punishment. It is the natural result of not recognizing what you destroyed.

My brother and I fought for years. He was Buddhist, I wasn't. Then I realized—we were both seeking. Why despise his path? Now we share tea. The inner samaya is simple: respect all seekers.

Therefore. For this reason: Inner level analysis: nang gi phyi (inner-outer)—spun dang (siblings), pha ma (parents), rang gi lus (own body). nang gi nang (inner-inner)—theg pa che chung (vehicles). nang gi gsang (inner-secret)—rang gi lus as lha'i dkyil 'khor. Precise analysis: the severity increases with the sacredness of the object.

The inner samayas protect the inner mandala. But the mandala is empty. The protection is empty. Rest in that emptiness, and all samayas keep themselves.

INNER? SECRET? More layers to cut! *slash slash* The body is not a mandala! The mandala is not real! The poison is not poison! See the nature (rang bzhin) ALL LAYERS!

Body's secret outer-inner-secret three. From the same source: secret outer—don't criticize vajra sibling or sister's body ornament, don't strike with high-low manner. If caused by other, still Avici continuum increases. Secret inner—extremely mixed sibling, even play jest manner, don't strike or be struck. Dream mother sport, not confess immediately, equals former sin. Secret's secret—teacher's body shadow, don't step over. Don't hold weapon in teacher's eye-range. Don't stretch legs, lie, show back, wear shoes, use seat, mount, umbrella, playful ornament. Don't use weapon or stone in teacher's bedroom. From that, hundred-thousand times teacher dwelling destroyed, body struck, threatened—negative action measure endless. Teacher carelessness, not-use abandon, also measure endless. Sibling body contempt—ripening-result express not able.

Garab Dorje's three: Direct recognition. Unwavering rest. Continual return. The outer secret protects the sangha. The inner secret protects the teacher. The secret secret protects the recognition. All secrets point to one: your mind and guru's mind are not two.

They worry about stepping over shadows! "Did I step over the Rinpoche's shadow? Am I bad?" This old man laughs! The shadow is not the guru. The guru is not the shadow. But the worry shows your mind. Purify that.

The guru's shadow—grib ma—is the blessing. Step over it, you step over the blessing. But who steps? Who is stepped over? In the dream of duality, respect the forms. In the recognition of non-duality, even stepping is prostration.

I wouldn't put my feet toward where my father slept. Not because he'd punish me. Because I loved him. The guru samaya is love, not fear.

Therefore. It follows that: Secret level: gsang ba'i phyi (secret-outer)—rdo rje spun (vajra siblings). gsang ba'i nang (secret-inner)—shin tu 'dres pa'i mched (extremely mixed). gsang ba'i gsang (secret-secret)—bla ma'i sku (guru's body). Precise analysis: violations measured in multiples—hundred-thousand times—indicating exponential karmic gravity.

The secret samaya is the samaya of recognition. See all forms as guru's form. Then stepping or not stepping—both are prostration.

SECRET OF SECRETS? The ultimate secret is THERE IS NO GURU TO RESPECT! See through respect and find the guru who needs no respect!

Thus body samaya divided nine. Two: speech samaya also three from. The nine body samayas complete like a mandala with nine deities. Now we turn to speech—what is spoken, what is held back, what is whispered in the secret chamber of the heart.

No words. Stop. The body samaya was preparation. The speech samaya is the teaching. What you guard with silence, what you release with words—both must be vajra.

They mastered the body rules. Now comes speech—harder! This old man has seen monks silent as stones, but their minds gossip like fishwives. Body still, speech quiet, mind racing—what's the point?

The body is the vessel. The speech is the elixir. Guard the vessel, yes. But guard the elixir more carefully. One drop spilled—ocean of karma.

Nine body samayas done. Now speech. Like learning to walk, then learning to talk. Step by step, word by word.

Therefore. So. Summary of sku'i dam tshig (body samaya): ninefold structure complete. Transition to gsung gi dam tshig (speech samaya): three categories, each with three subcategories. Precise analysis: the progression from coarse to subtle.

Nine samayas of body, nine of speech—eighteen gates to liberation. Walk through any. They all lead to the same courtyard.

NINE? EIGHTEEN? I'll cut them all! speaks with fierce compassion Body samaya? CUT! Speech samaya? CUT! What remains? THE SAMAYA THAT NEVER EXISTED!
The very barrier is the gateway—gegs lam du khyer. This is the treasury's heart.

The treasure was never hidden—done without doing.

The chest was always empty and full—finished before starting.
