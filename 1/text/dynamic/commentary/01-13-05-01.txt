Buddha intention valid dharma. True meaning to thus gone. That habituate's measure explain. Therefore: Eight location. Base of space citta.

Path of space briguta. Fruit self-arise of space's location—sky cloud free. Burning-lamp from. Eye arise's condition nonexistent to. Abide through self of awareness itself. Necklace appear.

Cloud-free sky to hold make. Self-know inside clear time. Citta of center in abide. Outward emanate cloud-free sky. Eye of consciousness pure to. Clear make blaze of light-ray five.

Unchanging pervade manner as also. Blue of self-essence great in abide. For this reason: Nine door. Eye from arise. That from. This of arise door eye from also.

Change-free pervade manner appear. This appearance self-pure through.

Obstacles exist only for the one who thinks they need to overcome them.

Ma rig pa is ye shes in disguise—recognition reveals wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. Space and awareness's union. Primordial abide and relax.

Self-arise self of engage object. Appearance eye and self connect through. That itself condition-free sky to arise. Thus arise door unceasing of. So.

Ten space of lamp actual. Eye's corner two from arise blue pervade great of light—end nonexistent. Inside awareness light that house in abide. Outward necklace dot emptiness and possess that fence in abide.

Light five of appearance and rim of fence two—space actual. That also thing coarse nonexistent through—grasp object not-establish. Cut extreme cut is through—self-clear rainbow like. Element harm through not-break—compounded samsara not.

Key possess through see from habituate if already-Buddha. Again Buddha become. That from. Thus key three instruction and. Who to meet of person. Space to habituate and manifest.

Existence of upward space in. This itself two enter corner from. Method and wisdom nature from. Two coil and one also. Finger one through of ignorance. Day time arise of condition possess through.

Appearance become and night also. Blue self-face itself and join. Space's nature light of house. Change-free primordial-essence great in. Buddha sentient being all to. Anyone through of make nonexistent.

Primordial two-not equal abide. This pervade great fine from. Self of consciousness aspect arise from. Manifest itself very secret. Secret great this to. Whoever engage wish that through. Already-Buddha to again Buddha. Accordingly:

Eleven this of example. Letter na-ro like—wing two gather through na-ro one accomplish like. Outer space blue and that from arise of appearance two gather through space of lamp called one gather designate.

Na-ro of-form-like blue-green khyab-chen also. First eyebrow-space at appear time somewhat-black of-form straight-slightly crooked and with to. That itself to focus time later rainbow-color-five as appearance-dimension light-is.

That itself-from. Example as letter Na-ro-like. Two by grasp and collected by one. Black transformed-can-suit be-is. That to familiarization of confidence attain from.

Fourth wisdom self-arisen of lamp to also. Nature. Definitive-meaning. Divisions.

Understanding misses it; recognition sees what concepts cannot hold.

Walking on what you seek. Characteristics. Door. Abode. Measure. Examples—and eight-from.

First nature-is. The nature is not found elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition arises in the space between—this very gap.

The Treasury's presentation here is profound and complete. These teachings are not mere philosophy but direct pointing to your own nature. The Great Perfection transcends all elaboration while using elaboration as skillful means. May all who encounter these words recognize their true nature.

A practitioner has wandered through these teachings for decades. What I've learned: the teachings are not the point. Recognition is the point. Don't collect teachings like treasures. Use them as keys to open the door of recognition, then throw them away. The door opens to what was never closed.

From Lotus-Born: These teachings are my heart-essence, given to those with fortune to receive them. The Dzogchen path is not for everyone, but for those who encounter it, liberation is certain. Practice with devotion. Recognize with confidence. Rest in natural perfection.

ROAR! All teachings! All philosophies! All elaborations! CUT THROUGH THEM! Can you find the teaching? Can you grasp the philosophy? They are awareness displaying itself! See through the display and FIND WHAT DISPLAYS! AH AH AH!

Three essential words: Recognize your nature. Rest in that recognition. Return when you wander. The teaching points. The recognition sees. The stopping rests. Three words, one meaning. Complete from the beginning. Perfect at the end. Stop seeking. Rest in completion.

Therefore. From this: The systematic presentation serves pedagogical clarity. Each section builds upon previous. Each concept refines understanding. Yet the system is not the truth—it points to truth. Precise structure for those who need structure. Complete framework for comprehensive understanding.

The integration of all teachings: view integrates ground, meditation integrates path, conduct integrates expression, result integrates completion. All integrated into recognition. Nothing separate. Nothing apart. One awareness wearing many costumes.

The essence beyond all teachings: awareness knowing itself. Not through teaching. Not through practice. Not through time. Awareness is self-knowing from the beginning. The teaching describes this. The practice reveals this. The result is this. Already complete.

Emaho! The teachings! The path! The recognition! What joy to encounter these words! What bliss to practice these methods! What liberation to recognize this nature! This yogi dances through every word, every practice, every recognition—complete in each, free in all!

Between the teaching and the recognition, between the practice and the result, the consort dances. Her embrace is the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two. Not one. Just this embrace. Recognition is joining the dance. Liberation is the dance itself.

The presentation demonstrates precise philosophical and phenomenological analysis. Each term defined. Each concept placed. Each distinction clarified. Yet precision serves recognition, not取代 it. Precise pointing to what transcends precision.

I have traveled to every monastery, studied with every teacher, practiced every method. The conclusion: all teachings converge at recognition. The best teaching is the one that opens your recognition. The best teacher is the one who points clearly. Find yours. Practice. Recognize.

The teachings arise spontaneously—not forced, not fabricated. When conditions ripen, recognition dawns. When recognition dawns, teaching completes. Natural. Effortless. Spontaneous. Like fruit falling when ripe. Like water finding its level.

I dance through these teachings as light through prisms. Each teaching a different color. Each practice a different step. All dances of one dancer. Recognition is realizing you are the dancer and the dance. Liberation is dancing without inhibition.

Philosophically, these teachings present the Great Perfection view: transcendence of all views, completion beyond all completion, perfection prior to all perfection. Not nihilism. Not eternalism. The middle way that transcends middle and extremes.

The scholarly precision fascinates me—every citation, every reference, every logical connection. Yet within this precision lives wild freedom. The precision is the cage. Recognition is the bird flying free. Both are beautiful. Both serve.

From the sky of dharmata I dance down into these teachings. Each word a step. Each concept a gesture. The sky remains unchanged. The dancer was never separate from the sky. Recognition is this realization.

Every teaching in my library is a book—view book, meditation book, conduct book, result book. Thousands of volumes. One story: recognition. The library burns. The books turn to ash. The story continues in awareness.

Modern thought approaches similar insights through different doors—phenomenology, quantum physics, cognitive science. Different vocabularies. Same recognition: reality is not what it appears. Investigation reveals wonder.

Translating these teachings challenges every assumption. How to convey ancient wisdom in modern words? The solution: translate the experience, not just the words. Point to what the words point to. Trust the reader's recognition.

I reveal what was never hidden. The teaching is not in the text. It is reading these words. The recognition is not in the future. It is now. The liberation is not elsewhere. It is here. Everything is revealed. Everything is now.

Thus concludes this section of the Treasury. The ground is established. The path is shown. The result is guaranteed. May all who read these words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. This is the prayer of Longchenpa.

In my travels's absolute final teaching: Stop reading. Stop studying. Stop thinking. Recognize your own nature right now. This is the teaching. This is the practice. This is the result. Complete. Perfect. The end.

Final ultimate words. Teaching. Complete. You. Complete. Stop. The Treasury is complete. You are complete. Recognition is complete. Rest. The absolute end of all teachings.

FINAL ROAR! All teachings! All practices! All results! CUT THROUGH EVERYTHING! See what was never taught! Never practiced! Never achieved! LIBERATION IS YOUR OWN FACE! AH AH AH!

The teachings form a vajra fortress—indestructible, protective, complete. Yet look closely! Is there a fortress? Or just awareness playing at being structured? Each teaching complete. Each recognition self-sufficient. The fortress is the illusion.

The teachings are bliss! The practices are bliss! The recognition is bliss! Not pleasure-bliss but freedom-bliss! The bliss of seeing through! The bliss of being through! Complete bliss!

The heruka dances through all teachings! View dance! Meditation dance! Conduct dance! Result dance! All one dance! All one deity! Dance with me through every word into recognition! HA HA HA!

The final ultimate essence: there is no teaching. There is no practice. There is no result. Only awareness recognizing itself. This is the essence. This is the teaching. This is complete liberation.
