[1-34] First, regarding liberation from the binding of saṃsāra. The appearances—upright standing, spreading wings, boat-shaped, piece-formed, layered like armor—five complete. Mastering the colors of the five wisdoms, one obtains power over the five poisons: desire, aggression, delusion, pride, jealousy. These five actively moving, bound and liberated from saṃsāra's binding. Only habitual tendencies remain—this is transcending half of saṃsāra.

[-20405--20393] Three words. Poison. Wisdom. Stop. You think you must purify desire to become wisdom. Fool! The desire is already wisdom. The poison is already nectar. Five colors, five wisdoms—different names for the same display. Upright standing, spreading wings—just shapes. The shape is not the binding. The belief in shape binds.

[1-34] I sat in retreat once... has seen practitioners worship their visions! "I saw a lotus, Rinpoche! I saw a stupa!" Hah! Visions are like dreams—if you grasp them, you bind yourself. If you see through them, you liberate. The five poisons become five wisdoms not by transformation but by recognition. Like ice melting into water—it was never not water.

[-20405--20393] The five visions are the five consorts dancing. Upright-standing Vajra-queen. Spreading-wings Karma-queen. Boat-shaped Padma-queen. Piece-formed Ratna-queen. Layered-armor Buddha-queen. When you master their colors, you master their nature. When you master their nature, you are the master, not the mastered.

[1-34] I once saw five rainbows over the peaks of Minyak Gangkar. Each one different, each one light. I wanted to hold them, keep them, name them. They faded. The poisons are like that—if you try to own them, they own you. Let them arise, let them display, let them liberate themselves.

[1-34] Then net-pattern and half-net, various eyes, striped like tiger-skin, circular tent-house-like appearances seen. Beyond the grasping of the five aggregates as self. Beyond the worldly self of the threefold world. Dharmatā vision pure blessing. The net is the net of concepts. The tent is the tent of perception. When you see through them, you see what was never covered.

[-20392--20379] Three words. Net. Tent. Stop. You think liberation is escaping the net. The net has no holes. You think liberation is leaving the tent. The tent has no walls. Seeing through means seeing the net as space, the tent as sky. Not escape—recognition.

[1-34] They describe their visions like merchants describing goods! "First I saw this, then that, then This uneducated yogi...This old man yawns. The net-pattern, the tiger-stripes—just mind's wallpaper. Don't redecorate the prison. Walk out. But walking out is also seeing there was never a prison.

[1-34] Then pure form wisdom-appearance. Like wisdom palace chimney-form. Like sun-moon pair-connected form. Like stacked-lotus form. Like stacked-stūpa form. Like thousand-petaled-lotus form seen. Transcending the binding of the five elements. These arise and cease together—one-arising, one-ceasing called experience. From previous difference becoming, called "going above." Thus awareness-arising from previously practicing empowerment sequence.

[-20384--20374] Three words. Palace. Form. Stop. You build a palace in the sky. You worship the palace. You want to enter the palace. The palace is your own face. The chimney is your own breath. The sun-moon is your own two eyes. When will you stop seeking outside what you are?

[1-34] WISDOM PALACE! speaks with fierce compassion I will tear it down! But look—nothing to tear! The palace is empty! The form is empty! The sun-moon connection is empty! SEE THIS EMPTINESS! The one who sees is also empty! LIBERATION!

[1-34] Second, particular explanation of vision manner: The five wisdom colors' vision and shape's vision. Two aspects. Not one, not many. Display and emptiness inseparable. This is the subtle practice of Thögal—not fixation on form but recognition through form.

[Final] The visions arise, display, and liberate. Not grasped, not rejected. The five poisons are the five wisdoms. The net is the sky. The palace is your heart. Rest in this recognition.

Emaho! The path of liberation through visionary appearance!

I have memorized all distinctions. Then I forgot: who was memorizing? The library dissolves into spaciousness.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
