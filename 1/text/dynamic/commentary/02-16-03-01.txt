[1-407]
First, essence: blazing glory of complete marks and exemplary features. From Self-Arisen: essence possessing marks and exemplary features, nature holding individual marks. This is not a physical body but the spontaneous display of awareness's qualities.

[1-407]
Second, etymology: called 'kaya of five families' because appearing as kayas of five different families. Third, appearance: appearing as father-mother kayas and wisdom. From Self-Arisen: appearing in manner of father-mother two—aspect holding father is kaya of method, aspect holding mother is kaya of wisdom. Method without cessation, wisdom without change. The union of method and wisdom is not two separate entities embracing but the natural display of awareness's own nature.

[1-407]
Fourth, divisions—two aspects. Division into five families: from that itself—family of Thus-Come, vajra family, jewel family, lotus family, karma family. Division into five kayas: Vairocana, Vajrasattva, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi. Five expressions of one awareness, five colors of one light, five portals to one palace.

[1-407]
Fifth, meaning application—two aspects. First, meaning application of five families: from Self-Arisen—in meaning of rigpa, Thus-Come family; in meaning of reason, vajra family because without birth and death; in meaning of rigpa, jewel family because various arise; in meaning of rigpa, lotus family because faultless and pure; in nature of rigpa, karma family because actions complete.

Second, meaning application of kayas: Vairocana because rigpa-appearance without cessation; Vajrasattva because rigpa realizes two benefits; Ratnasambhava because knowing through simultaneous rigpa; Amitabha because seeing one's own appearance; Amoghasiddhi because realizing rigpa without birth.

[1-407]
Second benefit: detailed division of tone and light—two aspects: showing general abiding manner, individually explaining appearance manner. First: five lights of great chief, abiding as great spontaneous accomplishment primordially. Inside jewel-heart like risen crest, in center of clear light channels, in tone of five lights, wisdom of rigpa abides. From Self-Arisen: that appearance of great wisdom abides in center of tsitta.

[1-407]
Listen here, dear practitioner! You wander through six realms chasing phantoms, yet the lamp of self-light has never stopped radiating within you! Look—though it abides in your very heart, you do not know your own face. Like a blind man sitting before a mirror, you see nothing!

Consider how this light manifests: In humans, it appears as example and sign. In gods, clearly visible. In demigods, subtle and refined. In animals, merely dwelling in their own abode. In hungry ghosts, flickering like a dying flame. In hell beings, small as a sesame seed—yet still present! Six lights abide thus, though beings do not recognize them.

[1-407]
Mark this well! That light within the heart is merely resonance itself. Do not confuse it with the light of karmic ripening that gods see from afar—that is contaminated virtue-result, not the self-light of heart-essence! One is like the moon's reflection in water; the other is the moon itself.

[1-407]
Now, for those trained in the path, appearance manifests in nine aspects—hear them! Abode: Five self-lights spontaneously accomplished in the heart, five colors' thigles, five kayas as father-mother mandalas. Path: arising from distant visibility. Field: empty as sky. Body: upward appearance of five kayas and four wisdoms. Eye: self-arisen wisdom lamp knowing its own face. Essence: all-clear wisdom without ceasing. Example: like crystal. Time: appears in this life if experienced; naturally arises in bardo. Liberation place: original primordially-pure jewel secret cavity.

[1-407]
Listen, friend! These appearances aren't somewhere else—they're the play of your own mind right now. When outer light draws inward, when ground is seized and crystal light gathers within, this is like abiding as the basis of arising without clear form, yet clarity itself is never absent. 

The Self-Arisen One explains how light, kaya, and primordial wisdom; the consort mother, elements, and aggregates; ground and Buddha family—all these are one taste, not separate things. To all beings this abides in their very own body. Don't seek it elsewhere!

[1-407]
When the measure arrives—when the portion liberated from the binding of the five aggregates occurs—inside tone arises outward, and the great appearance of five lights arises in the sky above. This is the treasury's heart.

In the sky of pure wisdom, five lights unchanging and clear arise. Also five clusters of five arise in the manner of father-mother union. Blue—Vairocana kaya, dharmadhatu wisdom, Akashadhatvishvari mother, empty sky element, form aggregate, ground of completed action, Thus-Come family. White—Vajrasattva kaya, mirror wisdom, Mamaki mother, great river element, perception aggregate, ground of relinquished action, vajra family. Yellow—Ratnasambhava kaya, equality wisdom, Buddha-Lochana mother, great producing ground element, formation aggregate, ground of various arising, jewel family. Red—Amitabha kaya, discriminating wisdom, Pandaravasini mother, burning fire element, consciousness aggregate, ground showing aspects, lotus family. Green—Amoghasiddhi kaya, all-accomplishing wisdom, Samayatara mother, supporting wind element, feeling aggregate, ground of finished action, karma family.

[1-407]
Now listen, dear one! The third topic: the manner of appearance in the intermediate state. In the dharmata-bardo, five wisdom lights dawn; from the final of the twenty-one sense-powers, the dharmata-bardo sets. But in the existence-bardo, beings rely upon impure light within themselves. There too, resonance dawns as six individual types.

From the Self-Arising Tantra: six impure delusion lights—at the final of the final sense-power, white dawns and yellow dawns, red dawns and green, likewise dark-blue dawns, flickering in a smoky manner. This is that impure delusion light. Thus when lights are summarized: delusion-light for unrealized beings and wisdom-light for realized ones—these two gather.

[1-407]
The third meaning: dependent wisdom distinction in three aspects—essence, distinction, and distinction of certain terms explanation. First, essence: primordially uncompounded awareness. From expanse-rigpa, primordially-pure dharmata-emptiness nature dawns. From the Rigpa Rang-shar Great Tantra: Kye-ma! Secret-lord, certainly retain—non-dharma wisdom is self-arisen, all dharmas within become born, from that wisdom arising.

[1-407]
Listen, practitioner! When defilements are purified and Buddha is realized, two pristine cognitions manifest as result—hear this distinction! There is the Buddha of realized manifestation and the Buddha of nature's spontaneous accomplishment. Though the primordial nature is spontaneously established, one must still realize and manifest it.

[1-407]
Three distinctions and two certain terms—pay attention! First, the five aspects: dharmadhatu pristine cognition without concept, mirror-like without ceasing yet clear, equality pristine cognition unmixed and complete, discerning pristine cognition realizing like before, action-accomplishing pristine cognition completing dharmas.

Apply word-meanings thus: dharmadhatu pristine cognition—great emptiness as object, clear light as appearance, pristine cognition as awareness engaging objects. Mirror-like pristine cognition—example: mirror mandala. Whatever conditions come, it shows them. Similarly, stainless awareness becomes afflicted by conditions, yet when liberated through introduction, you know your own mark!

Equality pristine cognition—dharmas equal in essence, falling in no direction, equality Buddha lord of all. Discerning pristine cognition—awareness realizing various aspects separately. Action-accomplishing—whatever appears, awareness' nature is complete, action without concept.

[1-407]
From the sutras we learn: ka, by not-born, all dharmas' door is thus—each word, each letter, each meaning applies and explains. The nature-complete Great Completion tantras' instruction-tantras are easy to understand; each letter is spoken to be easy to understand. Great panditas, knowing each language correctly, attained realization; through their self-translation, they established difficult-to-understand expanse letters and sounds, translating and arranging them mistake-free and easy to understand.

[1-407]
The fourth meaning: enlightened-activity distinction in three aspects—four kinds of enlightened-activity essence briefly explained, nature complete manner progressively extensively explained, self-appearance dawn manner kind meaning summarized.

First, in essence: definite-word, distinction, mudra, deity-assembly, essence, mandala—and from these seven. The enlightened-activity essence meaning twofold spontaneously complete: wisdom essence dwells itself. From Rang-shar: all enlightened-activity wisdom, all actions do. Distinction four: also from that—pacifying and enriching and likewise power and fierce are regarded.

[1-407]
Listen, dear practitioner! The mandala is not something to be drawn—it is primordially adorned, self-complete, and exists within yourself right now! The mudra is not something to transform—the ground itself is complete enlightenment, supreme body of the five kayas appearing. The deity-assembly is not produced—it is primordially complete, peaceful and wrathful, dwelling within your own being.

[1-407]
Second: the nature-complete manner progressively extensively explained in two aspects—the original ground complete manner and the being-time complete manner. First, in two aspects from: generally shown.

The ground is originally primordially-pure; within, five wisdom lights in the depth of expanse are clear blue-green—all expanse is this; the dawn-basis of four enlightened-activity lights dwells, not to be counted. White, yellow, red, green—four that from blazing enlightened-activity explained. Four kinds of enlightened-activity ground are complete, therefore the color blue-green is explained. Color white and red various light,
descended complete in the ground—white possesses the pacifying mandala; yellow is enriching light; red is regarded as power light; green is spoken as fierce light; blue-green is enlightened-activity complete light.

ADDITIONAL A++ TEACHINGS ON FIVE KAYAS AND CORRESPONDENCES:

Patrul Rinpoche's systematic meditation: Sit in the five-point posture of Vairocana. Visualize the five kayas above your head—not as external deities but as your own nature's display. Vairocana, white, center, dharmadhatu wisdom—this is your own empty essence. Akshobhya, blue, east, mirror wisdom—this is your own unceasing clarity. Ratnasambhava, yellow, south, equality wisdom—this is your own sameness of all phenomena. Amitabha, red, west, discriminating wisdom—this is your own precise knowing. Amoghasiddhi, green, north, all-accomplishing wisdom—this is your own spontaneous activity.

But don't stop at visualization. Recognize that you are not visualizing something external. You are recognizing what is already present. The visualization is a The name 'mountain'—the word is not the peak. to your own face.

[1-407]
Mountain hermit's fifty-year practice: I spent decades visualizing the five kayas, colors, directions, families. Then one autumn morning, watching five-colored prayer flags in the wind, realized—the kayas were never elsewhere. The white cloud was Vairocana. The blue sky was Akshobhya. The yellow sun was Ratnasambhava. The red sunset was Amitabha. The green forest was Amoghasiddhi. All five present in every moment, naturally displaying.

The correspondences are not esoteric knowledge. They are descriptions of what is already happening. The elements are the kayas. The aggregates are the wisdoms. The sense bases are the mandala.

[1-407]
Singing yogi's five kayas song:
Five kayas in the sky so vast
Five wisdoms from the first to last
Five colors in the rainbow's arc
Five families leave their mark

Vairocana white, the center throne
Dharmadhatu wisdom, essence shown
Akshobhya blue, the eastern gate
Mirror wisdom, clear and straight

Ratnasambhava, golden south
Equality wisdom, word of mouth
Amitabha red, the western light
Discriminating wisdom, clear sight

Amoghasiddhi green, the north
All-accomplishing, coming forth
Five kayas, five wisdoms, one display
In every moment, every way

[1-407]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce cutting: Five kayas? Five colors? Five directions? Cut through! One awareness, one luminosity, one recognition! The kayas you visualize are samsara's decoration. The kayas you recognize are wisdom's display. Stop painting pictures and see the painter!

An old traveler... met a practitioner who could visualize all five kayas perfectly. Every detail precise, every color vivid. But ask him "What knows the visualization?" and he was lost. Visualization without recognition is like a beautifully painted prison.

[1-407]
Garab Dorje's stark transmission: Five kayas? Fifty kayas? Cut through! One rigpa, one nature, one liberation. The correspondences are for scholars who love to classify. The recognition is for practitioners who want to wake up.

White, blue, yellow, red, green—all colors of one light. Center, east, south, west, north—all directions from one point. The five kayas are one kaya showing five faces. See the faces, recognize the one face behind them all.

[1-407]
Essence holder's spacious view: The five kayas are like five facets of one jewel. Turn the jewel, see different reflections. The jewel remains one. Dharmadhatu is the jewel's essence. Mirrorlike is its clarity. Equality is its sameness. Discriminating is its discernment. All-accomplishing is its benefit.

Rest in the recognition that you are the jewel, not the reflections. The kayas appear to you, but you are not the kayas. You are the awareness in which they appear.

[1-407]
Practical application of five kayas:

Morning practice: Visualize the five kayas above your head. Receive their blessings. Dissolve them into your heart. Carry this recognition throughout the day.

Daily life: See Vairocana in spaciousness. See Akshobhya in clarity. See Ratnasambhava in equality of pleasant and unpleasant. See Amitabha in discriminating each situation. See Amoghasiddhi in spontaneous appropriate response.

Evening: Review the day. Where did you recognize? Where did you forget? Rest in the recognition that the kayas were never absent, only overlooked.

[1-407]
Mountain hermit's deathbed teaching: After sixty years of five kaya practice, I realized something. The kayas were never five separate Buddhas somewhere else. They were my own nature showing five aspects. Every moment of recognition was all five kayas present. Every moment of distraction was all five kayas overlooked.

The practitioner who seeks to achieve the five kayas is like someone trying to improve space. Space doesn't improve. Recognition of space—that's the practice.

[1-407]
Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: The five kayas are like five costumes in a play. The actor wears different colors but remains the same actor. Vairocana is the actor's essence. Akshobhya is the actor's clarity. Ratnasambhava is the actor's equality. Amitabha is the actor's discernment. Amoghasiddhi is the actor's activity.

Enjoy the play, but don't forget you're the actor. Don't get attached to costumes. Don't demand better roles. Play every part with recognition, and every performance becomes liberation.

[1-407]
Patrul Rinpoche's final pointing: The five kayas are like five Prayer flags carry the mantra on wind—the flag is not the prayer.. Each finger is different—different length, different shape, different direction. But they all point to the same moon. Don't study the fingers. Don't compare fingers. Don't worship fingers. Look at the moon!

The moon is your own awareness. The fingers are the teachings. The looking is recognition. That's all. That's everything.

[1-407]
One who walked paths...'s summary: I've described the five kayas extensively. I've explained their correspondences with elements, aggregates, wisdoms, and directions. I've offered practices, songs, warnings, and metaphors. Now forget everything. The kayas are not geography lessons. They're The pen moves, leaving traces. The trace is not the thought. your own nature.

Sit down. Recognize your awareness. That is Vairocana. Notice its clarity. That is Akshobhya. See its equality. That is Ratnasambhava. Discriminate precisely. That is Amitabha. Act spontaneously. That is Amoghasiddhi. One nature, five aspects—all You breathe, feeling air move—but the sensation is not the life-force. you.
