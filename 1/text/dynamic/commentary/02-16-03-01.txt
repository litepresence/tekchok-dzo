[1182-1187]
First, essence: blazing glory of complete marks and exemplary features. From Self-Arisen: essence possessing marks and exemplary features, nature holding individual marks.

[1188-1204]
Second, etymology: called 'kaya of five families' because appearing as kayas of five different families. Third, appearance: appearing as father-mother kayas and wisdom. From Self-Arisen: appearing in manner of father-mother two—aspect holding father is kaya of method, aspect holding mother is kaya of wisdom. Method without cessation, wisdom without change.

Emaho! Five kayas complete!

[1205-1221]
Fourth, divisions—two aspects. Division into five families: from that itself—family of Thus-Come, vajra family, jewel family, lotus family, karma family. Division into five kayas: Vairocana, Vajrasattva, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi.

[1222-1237]
Fifth, meaning application—two aspects. First, meaning application of five families: from Self-Arisen—in meaning of rigpa, Thus-Come family; in meaning of reason, vajra family because without birth and death; in meaning of rigpa, jewel family because various arise; in meaning of rigpa, lotus family because faultless and pure; in nature of rigpa, karma family because actions complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Second, meaning application of kayas: Vairocana because rigpa-appearance without cessation; Vajrasattva because rigpa realizes two benefits; Ratnasambhava because knowing through simultaneous rigpa; Amitabha because seeing one's own appearance; Amoghasiddhi because realizing rigpa without birth.

[1238-1249]
Second benefit: detailed division of tone and light—two aspects: showing general abiding manner, individually explaining appearance manner. First: five lights of great chief, abiding as great spontaneous accomplishment primordially. Inside jewel-heart like risen crest, in center of clear light channels, in tone of five lights, wisdom of rigpa abides. From Self-Arisen: that appearance of great wisdom abides in center of tsitta.

Emaho! Five families and kayas!

[1250-1265]
Listen here, dear practitioner! You wander through six realms chasing phantoms, yet the lamp of self-light has never stopped radiating within you! Look—though it abides in your very heart, you do not know your own face. Like a blind man sitting before a mirror, you see nothing!

Consider how this light manifests: In humans, it appears as example and sign. In gods, clearly visible. In demigods, subtle and refined. In animals, merely dwelling in their own abode. In hungry ghosts, flickering like a dying flame. In hell beings, small as a sesame seed—yet still present! Six lights abide thus, though beings do not recognize them.

[1266-1269]
Mark this well! That light within the heart is merely resonance itself. Do not confuse it with the light of karmic ripening that gods see from afar—that is contaminated virtue-result, not the self-light of heart-essence! One is like the moon's reflection in water; the other is the moon itself.

[1270-1302]
Now, for those trained in the path, appearance manifests in nine aspects—hear them! Abode: Five self-lights spontaneously accomplished in the heart, five colors' thigles, five kayas as father-mother mandalas. Path: arising from distant visibility. Field: empty as sky. Body: upward appearance of five kayas and four wisdoms. Eye: self-arisen wisdom lamp knowing its own face. Essence: all-clear wisdom without ceasing. Example: like crystal. Time: appears in this life if experienced; naturally arises in bardo. Liberation place: original primordially-pure jewel secret cavity.

Understand this, fortunate one! What you seek outside has never been apart from you—not for a single instant! The nine aspects are complete in your own heart-mandala right now. Stop searching!

Emaho! The self-light of original purity!

[1303-1326]
Listen, friend! These appearances aren't somewhere else—they're the play of your own mind right now. When outer light draws inward, when ground is seized and crystal light gathers within, this is like abiding as the basis of arising without clear form, yet clarity itself is never absent. 

Look here! The Self-Arisen One explains how light, kaya, and primordial wisdom; the consort mother, elements, and aggregates; ground and Buddha family—all these are one taste, not separate things. To all beings this abides in their very own body. Don't seek it elsewhere!

That appearance of great wisdom abides in the center of your tsitta—your own heart center! The path arises from inside like an ocean; the field is the empty sky; the body is kayas and wisdom; the eye is the lamp of wisdom; the essence is the all-clear mirror. See how everything is perfect complete right where you are?

The example is the stainless lapis crystal kaya. The time is the dharmata intermediate state. When you arrive at the extent of the jewel cavity—this is it! If these appearances are seen as they are, this is called 'the manner of appearance of pure one-cutting in this intermediate state.' Recognize it now, don't wait for later!

[1327-1375]
When the measure arrives—when the portion liberated from the binding of the five aggregates occurs—inside tone arises outward, and the great appearance of five lights arises in the sky above. This is the treasury's heart.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. From that itself comes the appearance of pure one-cutting.

Listen carefully! In the sky of pure wisdom, five lights unchanging and clear arise. Also five clusters of five arise in the manner of father-mother union. Here are the colors and their meaning:

Blue—Vairocana kaya, dharmadhatu wisdom, Akashadhatvishvari mother, empty sky element, form aggregate, ground of completed action, Thus-Come family.

White—Vajrasattva kaya, mirror wisdom, Mamaki mother, great river element, perception aggregate, ground of relinquished action, vajra family.

Yellow—Ratnasambhava kaya, equality wisdom, Buddha-Lochana mother, great producing ground element, formation aggregate, ground of various arising, jewel family.

Red—Amitabha kaya, discriminating wisdom, Pandaravasini mother, burning fire element, consciousness aggregate, ground showing aspects, lotus family.

Green—Amoghasiddhi kaya, all-accomplishing wisdom, Samayatara mother, supporting wind element, feeling aggregate, ground of finished action, karma family.

Emaho! Five lights, five colors, five kayas, five wisdoms, five mothers, five elements, five aggregates—all complete in your own mind! Don't think this is far away. It's right here, right now, the natural display of your own rigpa! Recognize, recognize, recognize!

[1376-1404]
Now listen, dear one! The third topic: the manner of appearance in the intermediate state. In the dharmata-bardo, five wisdom lights dawn; from the final of the twenty-one sense-powers, the dharmata-bardo sets. But in the existence-bardo, beings rely upon impure light within themselves. There too, resonance dawns as six individual types.

From the Self-Arising Tantra: six impure delusion lights—at the final of the final sense-power, white dawns and yellow dawns, red dawns and green, likewise dark-blue dawns, flickering in a smoky manner. This is that impure delusion light. Thus when lights are summarized: delusion-light for unrealized beings and wisdom-light for realized ones—these two gather.

From that itself: light distinction is beyond thought! Pure wisdom light and impure delusion light are to be regarded. The expanse possesses light, thus body-wisdom-appearance is clear. Even in this delusion-time now, the appearance of five elements as five colors has not gone beyond—all beings dwell in that very nature! The Buddhas' exhaustion-meditations, rays, measureless bodies emanate, and also arise from that.

[1405-1419]
The third meaning: dependent wisdom distinction in three aspects—essence, distinction, and distinction of certain terms explanation. First, essence: primordially uncompounded awareness. From expanse-rigpa, primordially-pure dharmata-emptiness nature dawns. From the Rigpa Rang-shar Great Tantra: Kye-ma! Secret-lord, certainly retain—non-dharma wisdom is self-arisen, all dharmas within become born, from that wisdom arising.

Second, distinction: the five wisdoms, when with defilement time, included by being-mindstream, are called naturally-spontaneously-accomplished wisdom.

Emaho! Wisdom lights in bardo are none other than your own mind's display! Recognize the pure, don't follow the impure. The difference is only recognition or non-recognition!

[1420-1428]
Listen, practitioner! When defilements are purified and Buddha is realized, two pristine cognitions manifest as result—hear this distinction! There is the Buddha of realized manifestation and the Buddha of nature's spontaneous accomplishment. Though the primordial nature is spontaneously established, one must still realize and manifest it.

The term "pristine cognition" has no definitive fixed meaning—like pointing at the sky, the finger is not the sky itself!

[1429-1501]
Three distinctions and two certain terms—pay attention! First, the five aspects: dharmadhatu pristine cognition without concept, mirror-like without ceasing yet clear, equality pristine cognition unmixed and complete, discerning pristine cognition realizing like before, action-accomplishing pristine cognition completing dharmas.

Apply word-meanings thus: dharmadhatu pristine cognition—great emptiness as object, clear light as appearance, pristine cognition as awareness engaging objects. These three gathered are called "expanse"—with two aspects: pure pristine cognition expanse and impure beings' expanse.

Mirror-like pristine cognition—example: mirror mandala. Whatever conditions come, it shows them. Similarly, stainless awareness becomes afflicted by conditions, yet when liberated through introduction, you know your own mark!

Equality pristine cognition—dharmas equal in essence, falling in no direction, equality Buddha lord of all. Discerning pristine cognition—awareness realizing various aspects separately. Action-accomplishing—whatever appears, awareness' nature is complete, action without concept.

Thus, know the great pristine cognition! Realize authentically, liberate with certainty!

Emaho! The five pristine cognitions complete in awareness!

[1503-1515]
Listen here, friend! From the sutras we learn: ka, by not-born, all dharmas' door is thus—each word, each letter, each meaning applies and explains. But in some new tantras, the explanation of letter sounds also has faults in how it arises. If you think there's no difference between mantra and free translation, you're mistaken!

From the sutra treatises: briefly-explained, extensively-explained, and meaning-summarized—threefold application—and in those too, faults are observed. The nature-complete Great Completion tantras' instruction-tantras are easy to understand; each letter is spoken to be easy to understand. Great panditas, knowing each language correctly, attained realization; through their self-translation, they established difficult-to-understand expanse letters and sounds, translating and arranging them mistake-free and easy to understand. A translator endowed with kindness surpasses others. Thus the five wisdoms, from individually separate, become twenty-five, and with distinction parts as explained before—finished.

[1516-1544]
The fourth meaning: enlightened-activity distinction in three aspects—four kinds of enlightened-activity essence briefly explained, nature complete manner progressively extensively explained, self-appearance dawn manner kind meaning summarized. The nature is complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

First, in essence: definite-word, distinction, mudra, deity-assembly, essence, mandala—and from these seven. The enlightened-activity essence meaning twofold spontaneously complete: wisdom essence dwells itself. From Rang-shar: all enlightened-activity wisdom, all actions do. From that: enlightened-activity buddha itself is called, action wisdom experience takes, enlightened-activity self itself speaks, from I arisen and I complete, complete ground likewise.

Distinction four: also from that—pacifying and enriching and likewise power and fierce are regarded.

Emaho! Four enlightened activities spontaneously complete! Don't think you need to add anything. All accomplishing is already accomplished in the nature (rang bzhin) of mind itself!

[1545-1562]
Listen, dear practitioner! The mandala is not something to be drawn—it is primordially adorned, self-complete, and exists within yourself right now! The mudra is not something to transform—the ground (gzhi) itself is complete enlightenment, supreme body of the five kayas appearing. The deity-assembly is not produced—it is primordially complete, peaceful and wrathful, dwelling within your own being.

The mantra essence: channel-center letter wheel and that essence—four lamps as objects dawn. This too from the Self-Arising Tantra: all enlightened-activity mandala is not to be sought—it exists within the self; all enlightened-activity mudra is not to be transformed—it is complete within the four; all enlightened-activity deity-assembly is complete within one's own body; all enlightened-activity essence is called the great lamp of wisdom.

See how everything is already perfect? Don't go looking outside!

[1563-1587]
Second: the nature (rang bzhin)-complete manner progressively extensively explained in two aspects—the original ground complete manner and the being-time complete manner. First, in two aspects from: generally shown.

The ground is originally primordially-pure; within, five wisdom lights in the depth of expanse are clear blue-green—all expanse is this; the dawn-basis of four enlightened-activity lights dwells, not to be counted. White, yellow, red, green—four that from blazing enlightened-activity explained. From that: that also four enlightened-activity meaning, blue-green itself is complete.

Four kinds of enlightened-activity ground are complete, therefore the color blue-green is explained. Four kinds of enlightened-activity meaning: ground is well complete, that also shows this thus. Color white and red various light, descended complete in the ground (gzhi)—white possesses the pacifying mandala; yellow is enriching light; red is regarded as power light; green is spoken as fierce light; blue-green is enlightened-activity complete light.

Emaho! Four lights, four activities—all spontaneously complete within your own mind! Don't think you need to create them!

======================================================================
[02-16-03-01] COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-VOICE COMMENTARY EXPANSION
======================================================================


[Section] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the Great Perfection, presents these teachings with the utmost clarity and precision. These are not mere philosophical speculations or intellectual exercises, but direct pointing to your own true nature. The ground of being, primordially pure and spontaneously present, has never been separate from your own awareness. All the elaborate presentations—channels, winds, bindus, elements, lineages, cycles—are skillful means to guide practitioners of different capacities to the same recognition. May all who encounter these sacred words recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection itself.

[Section] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old vagabond has wandered the length and breadth of the land, seeking teachings, practicing methods, studying texts. Sixty years of seeking, and what have I found? That the recognition I sought was never lost. The nature I tried to realize was never unrealized. All the practices, all the studies, all the efforts were like polishing a mirror that was never tarnished. The Great Perfection teaching is not something to achieve through effort or time. It is the recognition that what you are seeking is what is seeking. Rest in that recognition and be complete.

[Section] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): From Lotus-Born, I offer this blessing: The secret instructions contained in these teachings are the heart-essence of all Buddhas, past, present, and future. They are not for everyone, but for those fortunate ones with the karma to encounter them, liberation is certain. Do not treat these teachings as mere philosophy or intellectual entertainment. Practice them with devotion. Meditate on them with sincerity. Recognize your own nature with confidence. The blessings of all lineage holders are present in these words. May you recognize and be liberated.

[Section] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words pointing to the ultimate truth: Recognize your own nature. Liberate the grasping mind. Rest in natural perfection. These three are not sequential steps but simultaneous aspects of one recognition. To recognize is to liberate. To liberate is to rest. There is no before or after, no higher or lower, no better or worse. The recognition available to the beginner is the same recognition available to the master. Stop seeking something special. Rest in what is already complete.

[Section] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): ROAR! Cut through all elaborations! Cut through all philosophies! Cut through all practices! What remains when everything is cut through? Awareness itself, naked and unobscured. This is the Great Perfection—not a perfection to achieve, but the perfection that is already present. The lion's roar is not aggressive; it is the sound of reality itself, clearing away all misconceptions. AH! AH! AH!

[Section] Voice 02 (Systematizer): Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation of the Great Perfection serves a precise pedagogical function. The classification into sections, the enumeration of topics, the distinction of categories—all serve to clarify what might otherwise remain obscure. Ground, path, and result are distinguished for the sake of understanding, though they are never separate in reality. View, meditation, conduct, and result are presented sequentially, though they are simultaneous in recognition. The system is a finger pointing; do not mistake it for the moon.

[Section] Voice 08 (Integrator): The integration of all aspects reveals their ultimate non-dual nature. What appears as ground is also path and result. What appears as view is also meditation and conduct. What appears as separate is actually the play of one awareness. Integration does not mean creating a synthesis of different things; it means recognizing that what appeared different was never separate. Like waves and ocean—distinct in appearance, one in essence. This is the Great Perfection's integration.

[Section] Voice 16 (Essence Holder): The essence of all teachings can be stated simply: awareness knowing itself. This essence is not something to find, achieve, or develop. It has been present from the beginningless beginning. All practices point to it. All teachings describe it. All results are its recognition. The essence is not in the words, not in the practices, not in the realization. The essence is the awareness that reads these words, the awareness that practices, the awareness that realizes. This is the secret essence.

[Section] Voice 12 (Ecstatic): Emaho! What wonder! What joy! To encounter these teachings in this very life! To have the opportunity to recognize one's own nature! This yogi dances with ecstasy—not from intoxication, but from the recognition of what has always been. Every word is a celebration. Every practice is a festival. Every recognition is a liberation. Dance with me through these teachings! Sing with me the song of recognition! Celebrate the Great Perfection that is already complete!

[Section] Voice 04 (Consort): The consort's embrace is the metaphor for the intimacy of awareness with itself. Not two separate entities embracing, but awareness embracing awareness. This is the secret of the Great Perfection. The path is not a journey from here to there, but the recognition of the intimacy that has always been present. Recognition is this embrace realized. Liberation is this intimacy made conscious. Rest in the consort's embrace, and all teachings are complete.

[Section] FINAL SUMMARY: The teaching is complete. The path is clear. The result is certain. All that remains is recognition. May all beings recognize their own nature as the Great Perfection. Complete. Perfect. Liberated.
