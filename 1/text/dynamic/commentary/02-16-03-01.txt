[1182-1187]
First, essence: blazing glory of complete marks and exemplary features. From Self-Arisen: essence possessing marks and exemplary features, nature holding individual marks. This is not a physical body but the spontaneous display of awareness's qualities.

[1188-1204]
Second, etymology: called 'kaya of five families' because appearing as kayas of five different families. Third, appearance: appearing as father-mother kayas and wisdom. From Self-Arisen: appearing in manner of father-mother two—aspect holding father is kaya of method, aspect holding mother is kaya of wisdom. Method without cessation, wisdom without change. The union of method and wisdom is not two separate entities embracing but the natural display of awareness's own nature.

[1205-1221]
Fourth, divisions—two aspects. Division into five families: from that itself—family of Thus-Come, vajra family, jewel family, lotus family, karma family. Division into five kayas: Vairocana, Vajrasattva, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi. Five expressions of one awareness, five colors of one light, five portals to one palace.

[1222-1237]
Fifth, meaning application—two aspects. First, meaning application of five families: from Self-Arisen—in meaning of rigpa, Thus-Come family; in meaning of reason, vajra family because without birth and death; in meaning of rigpa, jewel family because various arise; in meaning of rigpa, lotus family because faultless and pure; in nature of rigpa, karma family because actions complete.

Second, meaning application of kayas: Vairocana because rigpa-appearance without cessation; Vajrasattva because rigpa realizes two benefits; Ratnasambhava because knowing through simultaneous rigpa; Amitabha because seeing one's own appearance; Amoghasiddhi because realizing rigpa without birth.

[1238-1249]
Second benefit: detailed division of tone and light—two aspects: showing general abiding manner, individually explaining appearance manner. First: five lights of great chief, abiding as great spontaneous accomplishment primordially. Inside jewel-heart like risen crest, in center of clear light channels, in tone of five lights, wisdom of rigpa abides. From Self-Arisen: that appearance of great wisdom abides in center of tsitta.

[1250-1265]
Listen here, dear practitioner! You wander through six realms chasing phantoms, yet the lamp of self-light has never stopped radiating within you! Look—though it abides in your very heart, you do not know your own face. Like a blind man sitting before a mirror, you see nothing!

Consider how this light manifests: In humans, it appears as example and sign. In gods, clearly visible. In demigods, subtle and refined. In animals, merely dwelling in their own abode. In hungry ghosts, flickering like a dying flame. In hell beings, small as a sesame seed—yet still present! Six lights abide thus, though beings do not recognize them.

[1266-1269]
Mark this well! That light within the heart is merely resonance itself. Do not confuse it with the light of karmic ripening that gods see from afar—that is contaminated virtue-result, not the self-light of heart-essence! One is like the moon's reflection in water; the other is the moon itself.

[1270-1302]
Now, for those trained in the path, appearance manifests in nine aspects—hear them! Abode: Five self-lights spontaneously accomplished in the heart, five colors' thigles, five kayas as father-mother mandalas. Path: arising from distant visibility. Field: empty as sky. Body: upward appearance of five kayas and four wisdoms. Eye: self-arisen wisdom lamp knowing its own face. Essence: all-clear wisdom without ceasing. Example: like crystal. Time: appears in this life if experienced; naturally arises in bardo. Liberation place: original primordially-pure jewel secret cavity.

[1303-1326]
Listen, friend! These appearances aren't somewhere else—they're the play of your own mind right now. When outer light draws inward, when ground is seized and crystal light gathers within, this is like abiding as the basis of arising without clear form, yet clarity itself is never absent. 

The Self-Arisen One explains how light, kaya, and primordial wisdom; the consort mother, elements, and aggregates; ground and Buddha family—all these are one taste, not separate things. To all beings this abides in their very own body. Don't seek it elsewhere!

[1327-1375]
When the measure arrives—when the portion liberated from the binding of the five aggregates occurs—inside tone arises outward, and the great appearance of five lights arises in the sky above. This is the treasury's heart.

In the sky of pure wisdom, five lights unchanging and clear arise. Also five clusters of five arise in the manner of father-mother union. Blue—Vairocana kaya, dharmadhatu wisdom, Akashadhatvishvari mother, empty sky element, form aggregate, ground of completed action, Thus-Come family. White—Vajrasattva kaya, mirror wisdom, Mamaki mother, great river element, perception aggregate, ground of relinquished action, vajra family. Yellow—Ratnasambhava kaya, equality wisdom, Buddha-Lochana mother, great producing ground element, formation aggregate, ground of various arising, jewel family. Red—Amitabha kaya, discriminating wisdom, Pandaravasini mother, burning fire element, consciousness aggregate, ground showing aspects, lotus family. Green—Amoghasiddhi kaya, all-accomplishing wisdom, Samayatara mother, supporting wind element, feeling aggregate, ground of finished action, karma family.

[1376-1404]
Now listen, dear one! The third topic: the manner of appearance in the intermediate state. In the dharmata-bardo, five wisdom lights dawn; from the final of the twenty-one sense-powers, the dharmata-bardo sets. But in the existence-bardo, beings rely upon impure light within themselves. There too, resonance dawns as six individual types.

From the Self-Arising Tantra: six impure delusion lights—at the final of the final sense-power, white dawns and yellow dawns, red dawns and green, likewise dark-blue dawns, flickering in a smoky manner. This is that impure delusion light. Thus when lights are summarized: delusion-light for unrealized beings and wisdom-light for realized ones—these two gather.

[1405-1419]
The third meaning: dependent wisdom distinction in three aspects—essence, distinction, and distinction of certain terms explanation. First, essence: primordially uncompounded awareness. From expanse-rigpa, primordially-pure dharmata-emptiness nature dawns. From the Rigpa Rang-shar Great Tantra: Kye-ma! Secret-lord, certainly retain—non-dharma wisdom is self-arisen, all dharmas within become born, from that wisdom arising.

[1420-1428]
Listen, practitioner! When defilements are purified and Buddha is realized, two pristine cognitions manifest as result—hear this distinction! There is the Buddha of realized manifestation and the Buddha of nature's spontaneous accomplishment. Though the primordial nature is spontaneously established, one must still realize and manifest it.

[1429-1501]
Three distinctions and two certain terms—pay attention! First, the five aspects: dharmadhatu pristine cognition without concept, mirror-like without ceasing yet clear, equality pristine cognition unmixed and complete, discerning pristine cognition realizing like before, action-accomplishing pristine cognition completing dharmas.

Apply word-meanings thus: dharmadhatu pristine cognition—great emptiness as object, clear light as appearance, pristine cognition as awareness engaging objects. Mirror-like pristine cognition—example: mirror mandala. Whatever conditions come, it shows them. Similarly, stainless awareness becomes afflicted by conditions, yet when liberated through introduction, you know your own mark!

Equality pristine cognition—dharmas equal in essence, falling in no direction, equality Buddha lord of all. Discerning pristine cognition—awareness realizing various aspects separately. Action-accomplishing—whatever appears, awareness' nature is complete, action without concept.

[1503-1515]
From the sutras we learn: ka, by not-born, all dharmas' door is thus—each word, each letter, each meaning applies and explains. The nature-complete Great Completion tantras' instruction-tantras are easy to understand; each letter is spoken to be easy to understand. Great panditas, knowing each language correctly, attained realization; through their self-translation, they established difficult-to-understand expanse letters and sounds, translating and arranging them mistake-free and easy to understand.

[1516-1544]
The fourth meaning: enlightened-activity distinction in three aspects—four kinds of enlightened-activity essence briefly explained, nature complete manner progressively extensively explained, self-appearance dawn manner kind meaning summarized.

First, in essence: definite-word, distinction, mudra, deity-assembly, essence, mandala—and from these seven. The enlightened-activity essence meaning twofold spontaneously complete: wisdom essence dwells itself. From Rang-shar: all enlightened-activity wisdom, all actions do. Distinction four: also from that—pacifying and enriching and likewise power and fierce are regarded.

[1545-1562]
Listen, dear practitioner! The mandala is not something to be drawn—it is primordially adorned, self-complete, and exists within yourself right now! The mudra is not something to transform—the ground itself is complete enlightenment, supreme body of the five kayas appearing. The deity-assembly is not produced—it is primordially complete, peaceful and wrathful, dwelling within your own being.

[1563-1587]
Second: the nature-complete manner progressively extensively explained in two aspects—the original ground complete manner and the being-time complete manner. First, in two aspects from: generally shown.

The ground is originally primordially-pure; within, five wisdom lights in the depth of expanse are clear blue-green—all expanse is this; the dawn-basis of four enlightened-activity lights dwells, not to be counted. White, yellow, red, green—four that from blazing enlightened-activity explained. Four kinds of enlightened-activity ground are complete, therefore the color blue-green is explained. Color white and red various light, descended complete in the ground—white possesses the pacifying mandala; yellow is enriching light; red is regarded as power light; green is spoken as fierce light; blue-green is enlightened-activity complete light.
