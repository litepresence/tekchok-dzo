See directly: Thus. We proceed. Between preparation and ripeness, recognition is immediate. Spacious knowing without stages.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

This hermit realized: A humble practitioner. Dancing recognition! Immediate! Not learning steps! Now! Ecstatic!

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

Path dimension manifests as five light circles, rigpa abiding within the body. From this: path dimension as rigpa, dimension's light rim, rigpa body of five kayas—all explained. Fruit dimension primordially pure self-appearance, like a cloudless sky, rigpa that dimension inner dissolve arise-basis only abide.

Look now: Accordingly. The analysis. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[20190-20209]
Cut through now! See your nature. Rest. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Dancing ground! Path is dance itself! Never departed! Sky dancing!

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

This old hermit practiced thogal for years. The measures seemed impossible—when to examine, when to rest, when to gather. Then he realized: the measures are not rules but descriptions. Like describing how water flows—don't try to follow the description; let the water flow naturally.

[20200-20211]
Attachment without grasping—not bound by time or scholarly method. Secret mantra's familiarization reveals its nature. When wisdom moves, elements dissolve. Wisdom free from attachment meets appearances. Appearance and confusion liberated together. Familiarization sees truth. Light and appearance joined—AH!—like this, naturally explained.

[20211-20211]
Between familiarization and realization, the vast middle way opens. The measures are not milestones to reach but signposts along a road with no destination. Like a bird flying through the sky—no trace left behind, yet the flying is complete in itself.
