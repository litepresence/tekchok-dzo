See directly: Given this: We proceed. Not gradual: recognition is sudden (cig car), never gradual.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Beyond concept, awareness simply is—this is the showing.

This is not a concept to grasp but awareness showing its own face.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

This hermit realized: A humble practitioner. Liberation through recognition is never gradual, never gradual.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

No simplification needed—just seeing—before analysis, already complete.

What is shown cannot be grasped pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

Path dimension manifests as five light circles, rigpa abiding within the body. From this: path dimension as rigpa, dimension's light rim, rigpa body of five kayas—all explained. Fruit dimension primordially pure self-appearance, like a cloudless sky, rigpa that dimension inner dissolve arise-basis only abide.

Cut through now! See your nature. Rest. What blocks becomes the way when seen clearly.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The one seeking liberation is already liberated—just see clearly.

Walking the unwalkable.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

Look now: Accordingly. The analysis. The nature is not in another place—it is this very awareness.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

Not found through analysis; awareness meets itself here.

The grasping mind liberates itself—seeing the grasper is the release.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

This old hermit practiced thogal for years. The measures seemed impossible—when to examine, when to rest, when to gather. Then he realized: the measures are not rules but descriptions. Like describing how water flows—don't try to follow the description; let the water flow naturally.

Attachment without grasping—not bound by time or scholarly method. Secret mantra's familiarization reveals its nature. When wisdom moves, elements dissolve. Wisdom free from attachment meets appearances. Appearance and confusion liberated together. Familiarization sees truth. Light and appearance joined—AH!—like this, naturally explained.

Between familiarization and realization, the vast middle way opens. The measures are not milestones to reach but signposts along a road with no destination. Like a bird flying through the sky—no trace left behind, yet the flying is complete in itself.

Sudden recognition! In this manner. The obstacle is the path in disguise—seen through, it guides.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Between thoughts, awareness rests in its own nature.

Longchenpa indicates what words cannot reach pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

Thus established: This old man once. Recognition frees immediately—not in stages, never gradual.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The vault has no door—never incomplete.

The deluded mind is wisdom not recognizing itself wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The four measures—exhaustion, familiarization, stability, increase—are not separate stages but four aspects of one process. Like the four seasons—not sequential in the sense of one ending before the next begins, but continuous transformation. Recognize this, and practice becomes effortless.

Between these extremes: Hence. The structure. Each phrase indicates the beyond.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

The pointing points to what exceeds pointing pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition in the interval—between this thought and the next.

This old hermit offers final teaching on dimension rigpa: Don't be rigid with measures. Don't be loose either. Like tuning a string—not too tight, not too slack. The measures guide, but recognition leads. When recognition is stable, measures become ornaments.

What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.
