See directly: Thus. We proceed. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[20147-20160]
This hermit realized: A humble practitioner. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

[20159-20175]
Voice 20 proclaims: Path dimension five light circle, ripa na di inside body appear. From that: path appear dimension rigpa, dimension light rim, rigpa body five appear explained. Fruit dimension primordially pure self-appearance, sky cloudless like, rigpa that dimension inner dissolve arise-basis only abide.

[20166-20185]
Cut through now! See your nature. Rest. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

[20175-20200]
Look now: Accordingly. The analysis. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

[20190-20215]
This old hermit practiced thogal for years. The measures seemed impossible—when to examine, when to rest, when to gather. Then he realized: the measures are not rules but descriptions. Like describing how water flows—don't try to follow the description; let the water flow naturally.

[20200-20225]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Attachment grasp not time, scholar grasp method know. Secret mantra familiarization characteristic. Then wisdom move time, element five dissolve, wisdom attachment-free, appearance object arrive time, appearance confusion-free see, familiarization truth see, light appearance joined like explained.

[20215-20240]
Between familiarization and realization, the vast middle way opens. The measures are not milestones to reach but signposts along a road with no destination. Like a bird flying through the sky—no trace left behind, yet the flying is complete in itself.

[20230-20255]
Sudden recognition! In this manner. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.

[20250-20275]
Thus established: This old man once. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[20270-20290]
Voice 20 proclaims: The four measures—exhaustion, familiarization, stability, increase—are not separate stages but four aspects of one process. Like the four seasons—not sequential in the sense of one ending before the next begins, but continuous transformation. Recognize this, and practice becomes effortless.

[20285-20310]
Between these extremes: Hence. The structure. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[20300-20315]
This old hermit offers final teaching on dimension rigpa: Don't be rigid with measures. Don't be loose either. Like tuning a string—not too tight, not too slack. The measures guide, but recognition leads. When recognition is stable, measures become ornaments.

[20310-20325]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who boast of their measures! "I have reached stability," they say. "I have achieved exhaustion." Fools! The measures measure nothing. Recognition has no measure. Rest in what cannot be measured.


What is called self-liberation (rang grol) is not liberation achieved through effort, practice, or time. It is the recognition that what appears as bondage is, in its own nature, already free. The chain has never bound the prisoner; the prisoner has bound himself by believing in chains. Recognition is seeing that the chains are made of space, the prison is made of mind, and the prisoner has never been other than the free awareness that pretended to be imprisoned.
