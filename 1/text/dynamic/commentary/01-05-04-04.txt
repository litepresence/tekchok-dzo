Fifth field—web-protector Buddha. Dra ba mgon—not a deity standing guard,
but the interdependent nature that protects itself. Like a spider's web—
dew catches light, wind moves through, yet the pattern holds.

[6422-6422]
This old wanderer watched spiders in cave corners for months. Each web
destroyed by wind, rebuilt by morning. The spider never protects the web—
the web protects itself through endless becoming. This is the fifth field's
nature.

[6422-6422]
Not protector and protected as two. The web is the protection, the protection
is the web. Like space protecting space—no boundary between what guards and
what is guarded.

[6422-6422]
Web manifests. Protection inherent. Nature complete. Three words from the
First Point—recognition, rest, return. But here, return is the web itself.

[6422-6422]
See through. The protector is your own awareness, the protected is your
own display. Never separate, never two. Rest in the web that has no weaver.
