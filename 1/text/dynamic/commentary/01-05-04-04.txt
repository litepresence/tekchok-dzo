Fifth: web-protector Buddha. The web is not a trap. The web is the interconnected nature of all appearance. Each node a world, each strand a connection. The protector guards the web by knowing it is empty. Nothing can tear what was never woven. Nothing can escape what never held anything. The web-protector sits at the center that has no center.

[6422-6422]
An old practitioner once studied this web for seven years. He traced each strand, mapped each node, documented each connection. On the seventh anniversary of his study, a spider dropped onto his page. It spun a web in moments, then sat at its center. The practitioner saw: the web was never separate from the spider. The spider was never separate from the web.

[6422-6422]
Look. It is here. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[6422-6422]
Accordingly. The analysis. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[6422-6422]
Between the web and the recognition that transcends all connection, the treasury continues. Not rejecting the interconnectedness. Not grasping it. The web points beyond itself. Rest in that recognition.

[6422-6422]
An old vagabond. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

[6422-6422]
Liberate! What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[6422-6422]
In this manner. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[6422-6422]
Recognize immediately. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[6422-6422]
An old practitioner once asked: "Who is the spider?" The answer came in a flash: no one. There was never any spider. The web was never woven. The center was never anywhere. All was awareness, playing at being caught and freed.

[6422-6422]
Hence. The structure. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[6422-6422]
Sever! Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[6422-6422]
This mountain dweller. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[Final] Three words complete.
Each word points beyond itself to direct experience. The nature is complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
