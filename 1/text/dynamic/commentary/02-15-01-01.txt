[1-2]
Look here! Volume Two begins, and don't think this is just more of the same words. Longchenpa is shifting gears entirely. Volume One established the ground (gzhi)—*kun gzhi* and *chos sku*—but now he's bringing you face-to-face with how everything actually manifests. This is where the rubber meets the road.

[1-5]
. When you no longer wish to mingle with ordinary folk, when you feel you could soar through space, when the dissolution of appearances brings joy rather than fear—these are not ordinary experiences, you understand?

The root text says

[5-8]
He's laid out the distinctions of alaya-ground and dharmakaya for you. Now he's turning to *rten 'byung*—dependent arising. But notice: he's not starting with some abstract philosophy about causes and conditions. He's starting with what's right in front of your nose—the elements themselves. There's the common way of understanding this, and then there's the deep individual nature of each element. Don't skip past this thinking you already know about earth, water, fire, wind, and space. You don't know them. Not yet.

[10-14]
Two types of arising, he says. Outer and inner. Right there, stop! Don't immediately think "oh, outer means mountains, inner means my body." That's the trap. Longchenpa is pointing at how the very same five elements appear both as the world out there and as the channels, winds, and essences in your own vajra body. They arise from *rang shar*—self-arisen. You didn't create them. They didn't come from somewhere else. They're the spontaneous display of your own nature. Feel that?

[15-20]
Listen closely now. The outer elements—earth, water, and so on—exist as the basis for the inner elements. They're connected, intertwined, inseparable. You can't have inner without outer, and here's the crucial point: neither samsara nor nirvana exist without depending on these two. 

Emaho! What does this mean? It means your confusion and your enlightenment both depend on these very same five elements. Beings wander in the confused expanse of the five elements, yes, but they possess the *self-nature* of the great arising. That self-nature isn't dirty or broken—it's the same nature that Buddhas realize as pure. The only difference? Buddhas dwell in the five pure elements without the solidity of fixation, without the stains. The elements themselves don't change—you do!

[21-31]
Pay attention to this distinction between great and small arising. The five great elements are luminosity-wisdom with five colors—the enlightened dimension of the elements. The five small elements are what you usually think of: solid earth, flowing water, and so on. But the pure elements? They're clear, warm, bright, cool, spacious, moving. These aren't poetic descriptions—they're the actual felt qualities when you recognize the elements as they truly are.

From the confused five elements, the five luminosities arrive in the expanse. This is key! The confused elements don't go anywhere. The luminosity arrives *within* them, meets them, transforms the meeting itself. Like the purity of spontaneously arisen appearance—it's not that you get rid of the appearance and replace it with purity. The appearance itself becomes recognized as pure.

[32-37]
Now he's breaking down the small arising further: arising-form and actual arising. Arising-form is what appears outside—yes, the ordinary earth, water, fire, wind, space you see out your window. Actual arising refers to the five qualities within your body—the thin, and so forth, that become the basis for the inner arising. Your very body is composed of the same five elements, arranged differently. Pure realms have their own five dharma-elements, each distinct. This isn't just cosmology—it's a map of your own experience.

[38-43]
Therefore—mark this word, "therefore"—all samsara and nirvana don't move from the expanse of the five elements. They never left. Before the five elements, there was no samsara, no nirvana. The elements are primordial. From the Self-Arisen tantra, he quotes: "Kye ho, Secret Lord, listen! The characteristics of the five arising—I show, you must understand."

Do you hear the urgency? This isn't academic. The tantra itself is saying: understand this! Not intellectually—directly. The five elements are not obstacles to enlightenment. They *are* enlightenment's display when recognized.

[44-55]
The great arising, the Bhagavan, exists as the nature (rang bzhin) of all beings. All beings of the three realms move in the expanse of the five arising. Before the five arising existed, no Buddhas, no beings—not even names.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. The five arising themselves are the mother-expanse. Not established from the five arising—not even one being exists.

Read this carefully! "Not established from the five arising"—does this contradict what he just said? No! It completes it. Beings don't exist *from* or *apart from* the five elements. They are the five elements, and the five elements are empty of inherent existence. The two types of five arising of beings dwelling therein—this twofold nature is what you must recognize.

This page is the doorway. Walk through it.

[57-69]
Now we're getting into the meat of it. Longchenpa is going to explain outer-arising in detail, and look at the structure—tenfold! He's laying out: essence, definitive terminology, purpose, characteristics, sequence of functions, dharma-nature, applied meaning, manner of liberation, division, and completeness. This isn't just a list; it's a complete mandala of understanding. Don't rush through these ten like they're boxes to check off. Each one is a doorway into direct recognition.

[70-79]
First, the essence: Outer-arising appearing as form—what you see as earth, water, fire, wind, space—is the play of inner-arising's actuality. Do you hear this? That mountain you see outside? It's the play, the display, the sport of what's happening inside you. Gathered within the inner domain, these are the five elements. The outer five become the container, the world that holds sentient beings. The inner five become the support for conceptual mind and rigpa itself. 

This is crucial: your mind doesn't just happen to exist in a body made of elements. The very elements *are* the support for mind and *rig pa*—awareness. They're not separate from awareness; they're its foundation.

[80-87]
From the Thalgyur tantra: The assertion is that from the particularities of general-common karma—yes, we share this world because of collective karma—and by individual karma-supports, relying upon the outer elements, karma itself, sustenance, faculties, entourage, and birth are complete. The nature is complete.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. 

Look at your life: your body, your senses, your relationships, your very birth—all of this depends on these five elements. This isn't theory; this is describing your actual situation right now.

[88-99]
Second, definitive terminology. From the Self-Arisen again. Listen to these seven definitions of why they're called "great arising" (*'byung ba chen po*):

Not arisen through fabrication, spontaneously complete—they're not made by anyone, they just are. By that which produces, they are arising—they give rise to everything. By pervading all migrators—beings in all six realms—they're great. By simultaneous birth—everything arises at once, not sequentially—they're great. By existing in themselves—they don't depend on anything else. By being without change—their nature doesn't change even as their forms manifest. By appearing harmoniously—they work together perfectly.

This is the definitive terminology. Don't just memorize these seven; let them point you to the nature (rang bzhin) of the elements as they actually are.

[100-127]
Third, the purpose—this is where it gets practical. From the Thalgyur: This is the treasury's heart.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Water gathers the clear essence and separates impurities—this is its function. In your body, water regulates heat and cold. Earth holds the foundation, establishes and coheres, ripens to produce roots (the channels), and its purpose is the relative thigle. Fire increases arising, ripens and clarifies, blazes and spreads to produce the eyes and senses—its purpose is warmth. Wind scatters and lifts, moves and quivers, holds the body together by moving—its purpose is the abode of mind.

The four elements (he's leaving out space for a moment) are the great mandala of self. They become the cause for accomplishing body, abide in the middle holding everything together, and in the end perform all functions of destruction. Through one cause—these elements appear as the master who performs all the various activities.

What is Longchenpa telling you? Your body isn't just flesh and bone—it's a mandala of elements, each with specific functions that support your very consciousness. When you meditate, when you practice, you're working with these elements. Understanding their purpose isn't academic—it's the basis of the completion stage practices!

[128-129]
Fourth, characteristics—from among five. Earth's characteristic: solidity. This continues onto the next page, but already you can see: he's going to give you the specific characteristic of each element. Earth is solid. But don't think this means earth is just "hard stuff." Solidity here means stability, foundation, the quality of holding. This is the nature (rang bzhin) of earth as element—not just dirt, but the principle of stability itself.

Recognize these elements in your own experience. When you feel stable, grounded—that's earth. When you feel fluid, adaptable—that's water. When you feel clear, perceptive—that's fire. When you feel movement, change—that's wind. When you feel spacious, open—that's space. These aren't metaphors. This is how the elements actually appear in your mind and body.

[130-133]
Continuing with the characteristics. Water's characteristic: moisture—not just wetness, but the quality of cohesion, binding things together, fluidity. Fire: warmth—not just heat, but the principle of transformation, maturation, clarity. Wind: movement—not just motion, but the principle of change, activity, dynamism. Space: openness and spaciousness—not just emptiness, but the principle of accommodation, the capacity to contain everything without obstruction.

These aren't abstract qualities. They're describing how the elements actually function in your experience and in the world. Feel them directly!

[134-145]
Fifth, the sequence of functions. Now we get the embryology—the actual development of the body in the womb. From the Thalgyur:

Earth makes the basis of the body first. By producing, it ripens as flesh. Water gathers the entire body; by producing, it ripens as blood. Fire ripens the entire body; by producing, it ripens as warmth. Wind lifts the entire body; by producing, it makes breath ripen.

This is the order: earth establishes the foundation (flesh), water brings cohesion (blood), fire brings maturation (warmth), wind brings movement and vitality (breath). This isn't just physical development—it's the pattern of how manifestation occurs. Foundation first, then cohesion, then maturation, then dynamism. See this pattern everywhere!

[146-155]
Sixth, dharma-nature. Though the elements are generally empty—yes, they're empty of inherent existence—here Longchenpa focuses on how they hold their own characteristic, their particular dharma-nature. From the Self-Arisen:

The cause of arising is earth—everything manifests from the ground (gzhi), the basis. The wisdom of arising is fire—wisdom is the clarity, the knowing quality. The emanation of arising is wind—emanation is movement, activity, manifestation. The master of arising is water—water is the cohesive principle that holds everything together. The dharma-nature of arising is space—space is the fundamental nature, the openness in which everything arises.

Each element has a special role in the process of arising. This isn't just poetic—it's describing the mechanics of manifestation from the basis!

[156-166]
Seventh, application of meaning—this is where Dzogchen really shows its profundity. Recognition is immediate.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. From That Very (a tantra):

Within dharmakaya, primordially pure, by essence without change, arising earth also is. This is the key insight: the element earth isn't separate from dharmakaya. Its very unchanging essence IS the earth element. 

By awareness-wisdom engaging meaning, arising fire also is. The engagement of awareness-wisdom with objects—that's fire.

By awareness-wisdom gone without movement into dimension, arising wind also is. When awareness rests without moving into the expanse, that's wind.

By awareness-wisdom gathering the three cavities as one, arising water also is. When the three centers (channels) are gathered, unified, that's water.

By wisdom dissolving into nondual empty-luminous, arising space is. The dissolution into the inseparability of emptiness and clarity—that's space.

Longchenpa is showing you: the five elements are not separate from the five wisdoms. They're the display of the five wisdoms in form. This is the completion stage view!

[167-172]
Now the second part of applied meaning—connecting the outer five elements with inner awareness. This is the treasury's heart.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. From the Norbu Drathakod (Display of Jewels tantra):

The five outer arising are the common dharma of self-continuum. All outer-appearing elements, by connecting with self-awareness itself, are the common dharma. 

This means: everything you see outside—mountains, rivers, sky—is actually appearing to your own awareness. It's not separate from your awareness. The divisions are thus: the characteristic of earth making solidity also. [continues]

Here's the pointing-out instruction hidden in this scholastic presentation: don't look at the world as separate from your mind. The solidity of earth appears in your awareness. The fluidity of water appears in your awareness. They're not "out there" separate from you—they're the display of your own rigpa!

[173-181]
Continuing the application of meaning—connecting each element's characteristic with awareness-wisdom: This is the treasury's heart.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

Earth's characteristic of making solidity connects with awareness-wisdom free from birth and destruction. Why? Because earth is stable, unchanging, not born and destroyed like conditioned phenomena. This is the unborn nature of dharmakaya appearing as earth's solidity.

Wind's characteristic of lifting connects with awareness-wisdom without obstruction. Wind moves freely, nothing blocks it—that's the unobstructed nature of wisdom.

Fire's characteristic of burning connects with awareness-wisdom gone under the authority of afflictions. Fire consumes, burns up afflictions. This is the wisdom that has power over the kleshas.

Water's characteristic of moistening connects with awareness-wisdom entering all objects. Water flows everywhere, pervades everything—that's how wisdom enters all phenomena without obstruction.

Space's characteristic of vastness connects with awareness without break in continuity. Space is never interrupted, never cut—that's the continuous nature of rigpa.

Each element is pointing to a quality of awareness. This is the profound interconnection!

[182-194]
Eighth, the manner of liberation—from the Mutik Trengwa (Pearl Garland): This is the treasury's heart.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Space itself, by pervading emptiness, liberates space itself as entity. Space liberates into its own nature—pervading emptiness.

Wind, by appearing without graspable object, liberates into the function of gathering entities. Wind appears but you can't grasp it—it naturally liberates into gathering.

Fire, by consuming what ripens, liberates by moving and separating clarity from impurity. Fire burns, consumes, separates pure from impure.

Earth, when making the producer to lift, liberates into limitless empty non-entity. Earth's production function liberates into emptiness.

Water, by moistening what gathers, liberates into the function of ripening what burns. Water's moistening liberates into ripening.

This is describing how each element, when recognized in its true nature, liberates. Not by getting rid of it, but by recognizing its nature!

[195-225]
Ninth, divisions—the 25-fold elements. This is complex but profound.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. Each element contains all five elements within it:

Space contains space-wind, space-fire, space-water, space-earth, and space-space.
Wind contains wind-wind, wind-space, wind-water, wind-fire, wind-earth.
Water contains water-water, water-space, water-wind, water-fire, water-earth.
Fire contains fire-earth, fire-space, fire-wind, water-fire, fire-earth.
Earth contains earth-earth, earth-space, earth-wind, earth-water, earth-fire.

Five elements, each with five sub-elements: twenty-five total. This isn't just taxonomy—it's describing how each element has the nature (rang bzhin) of all elements within it. Space has wind-like movement, fire-like consuming, water-like gathering, earth-like support. And so on for each.

This is the mandala principle: each part contains the whole. Each element is a complete mandala of all five. This interpenetration is the nature (rang bzhin) of reality!

By training in these distinctions, specific qualities are accomplished. Each combination has its own special function and quality. This is the basis of element transformation practices in the completion stage.

[226-239]
From the Sound Thalgyur: by training in the sound-meaning of elements, common attainments are obtained. This is referring to how the elements manifest as sounds, and by understanding their meaning, you gain powers and abilities. 

The particularities: training in form exhausts the body (you see through its solidity), knowing languages through sound, taking essence through smell, transforming entities into nectar through taste. These are completion stage practices!

From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra: by becoming familiar with the sounds and meanings of earth, water, fire, and wind, you understand the self-sounds of the six races (types of beings), and clairvoyance arises. Each being, each realm, has its own elemental signature. Understanding this gives you insight into all realms.

These outer elements are the support and abode of all sentient beings. This completes the tenfold presentation of outer elements.

[240-258]
Tenth: how samsara and nirvana are complete in the yogi's body and mind. This is the profound Dzogchen teaching of completeness (*tshang tshul*).

First, the general presentation: in the gathered body and mind of migrators, all primordially self-arises complete:
- Father and mother = method and wisdom
- Karma wind projecting = Dharmakaya awakening
- Five element seeds = five families' sound-potential 
- Two essences of equipoise = union of method-wisdom of path's two accumulations
- Abiding in womb = abiding in base-dimension
- Body forming in seven sets of seven days = completing seven paths of seven pure elements
- Ten months in womb = completing ten grounds
- Becoming Buddha in three kayas = completing the path
- Birth = emanation-body
- Abiding engaging fields = enjoyment-body
- Death = arising of Dharma-nature empty

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

This is the profound teaching: your entire life—conception, gestation, birth, aging, death—mirrors the path to enlightenment. Every stage corresponds to a stage of the path!

[259-283]
From the Mutik Trengwa, the Bhagavan speaks: What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through. Rest in this understanding.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Not liberated by effort—don't try to create liberation!
Abiding liberated from primordial—you're already free!
From union of method and wisdom—father and mother are the cause.
The moving projecting wind—self-aware awakening, great bliss.
The seed from five causes—arises appearing from emptiness field.
Equipoise of bliss of the two—wisdom arisen from method.
Entering womb—self-awareness arising from base.
Seven sets of seven—measure of realization.
Ten months—traversing the ground (gzhi)s.
Birth—arising as kaya.
Producing body—base-appearing field.
Abiding in body—the base.
Aging—awakening confusion from delusion.
Sickness—confidence of realization.
Death—liberation into Dharma-nature empty.

All appearing sentient beings—primordially liberated without effort!

This is it! The whole path is already complete in your life. Birth, life, death—they're not obstacles; they ARE the path when recognized.

[265-283]
(continuation from PAGE 5)
The verse continues explaining the completeness teaching: the moving projecting wind is self-aware awakening, great bliss. The seed from the five causes arises appearing from the field of emptiness. The equipoise of bliss is wisdom arisen from method. Entering the womb is self-awareness arising from the base.

Seven sets of seven days is the measure of realization. Ten months traverses the ground (gzhi)s. Birth is arising as kaya. Producing the body is base-appearing field. Abiding in body is abiding in the base. Aging is awakening confusion from delusion. Sickness is confidence of realization. Death is liberation into Dharma-nature empty.

This is the revolutionary Dzogchen view: your life IS the path. Every ordinary experience, when recognized, is an enlightened experience. You're not trying to get somewhere else—you're recognizing where you already are!

[284-297]
Connecting with reversing delusion:
- Birth = awareness moving from dimension
- Body = the base
- Outer appearances = base-appearing spontaneous completion
- Sickness = realization meeting face-to-face
- Aging = awakening confusion from truth-clinging
- Death = final arrival at primordial purity ground This is the treasury's heart.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

These arise primordially, so instruction introduces you to them, empowerment matures you, and meditation liberates. 

If complete in partial similarity, you can't liberate through instruction alone—you need to be shown clearly that this partial similarity exists. This is Buddha's Dharma. The base-path is primordially complete. What Buddha teaches as symbols points to this essence.

[284-297]
(continuation)
The particular manner of reversing delusion: birth is awareness moving from dimension; body is the base; outer appearances are base-appearing spontaneous completion. Sickness is realization meeting face-to-face. Aging is awakening from truth-clinging confusion. Death, knowing self-face, shows arrival at primordial purity.

These arise primordially, so: instruction introduces, empowerment matures, meditation liberates. If you're already complete in partial similarity, you need the instruction to point it out clearly. This is what Buddha's Dharma does—it shows you what you already have. The base-path exists primordially in its complete measure.

[298-313]
Second: completeness in body and mind specifically—threefold: body, mind, and awareness. Rest in this understanding.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

First, body: in this aggregate of four gathered elements, the outer container-world and inner essence-migrants are all complete. From the Mutik Trengwa: earth, water, fire, wind, space, sun, moon, forms of beings, planets, stars, clouds, trees, mountains, rocks, roots, trunks, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, smells, tastes, sounds, touches—all are present in the body!

Your body is a complete universe. Everything outside is also inside. This isn't metaphor—it's the actual structure of manifestation.

[298-313]
Now the second topic: completeness in body and mind specifically. Rest in this understanding.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was. This has three parts: body, mind, and awareness.

First, the body: this aggregate of four gathered elements contains everything. The outer container-world—the universe—and the inner essence-migrants—all beings—are complete right here in your body.

From the Mutik Trengwa (Pearl Garland): Earth, water, fire, wind, space, sun, moon, forms of males and females, planets, stars, clouds, trees, mountains, rocks, roots, trunks, branches, leaves, flowers, fruits, smells, tastes, sounds, touches.

Longchenpa is listing everything in the universe and saying: it's all in your body. This isn't exaggeration. In the completion stage, you realize that your channels, winds, and essences correspond to cosmic structures. Your body is a mandala. The microcosm mirrors the macrocosm perfectly.

When you understand this, practices like tummo (inner fire), the various yogas of channels and winds—they're not just physical exercises. You're working with the cosmic elements concentrated in your vajra body.

[314-370]
Longchenpa continues the detailed correspondences—everything in the universe is in your body. Music and canopies, banners and upper-canopies—all these appearing dharmas are complete in the yogi's body.

Here are the specific correspondences:
- Earth's portion: flesh (the solid substance)
- Water's portion: blood (gathering, flowing)
- Fire's portion: warmth (ripening, maturing)
- Wind's portion: breath (karmic vehicle)
- Space's portion: mind (awareness itself)
- Sun-moon: the two eyes (clarity, perception)
- Male: birth (active principle)
- Female: death (receptive dissolution)
- Planets: the gate-house of desire and two nostrils (openings)
- Stars: teeth (sparkling, distinct)
- Clouds: hair (covering, floating)
- Trees: channels (branching pathways)
- Mountains: the whole similar body (solid, upright)
- Rocks: bones (hard structure)
- Tree roots: heart (foundation)
- Trunk: legs (support)
- Branches: limbs (extensions)
- Flowers: five faculties (senses blooming)
- Fruit: happiness-suffering of body (result)
- Sound: voice (expression)
- Form: body (appearance)
- Smell: pores (openings)
- Taste: skin (surface contact)
- Touch: sickness (sensation)
- Music: internal organs (harmony)
- Canopy: urine (fluid covering)
- Parasol: legs (protection)
- Banner: name (identity)
- Upper-canopy: breath (covering atmosphere)

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

This isn't symbolic—it's actual structure. Your body literally IS the universe in concentrated form. The Mutik Trengwa verse confirms all this.

[371-389]
Second: completeness in mind. All dharmas of samsara-nirvana, base and path, are completely present in mind. From the same source:

All white dharmas of transcendence are completely present in body and mind. Because samsara dharmas are empty of transcendence, they're also present. The list includes everything: mandala, deity, offering, mantra, mudra, concentration, empowerment, samaya, instruction, experience, development stage, hearing, contemplating, meditating, view, conduct, giving, ethics, patience, effort, concentration, wisdom, powers, aspiration, perfections, ten virtues, method and wisdom—all are present in body and mind.

This is the completion stage view: you don't need to go somewhere else to find these. They're already complete in your own body and mind.

[390-425]
Third: completeness in awareness itself. This is the highest level—rigpa contains everything.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

From the tantra: in whatever face of self-appearing awareness, all however-appearing dharmas are complete. This is the crucial point: it's not just that things are in your body or mind—they're in awareness itself, which is more fundamental than both.

The correspondences continue but at the awareness level:
- Sun and moon: method and wisdom
- Male: base, Female: path (the union)
- Planet: measure of realization
- Star: dharma
- Cloud: compassion pervading all
- Tree: path of expanding dharma-nature
- Mountain: view without change
- Rock: dharmakaya free from birth and destruction
- Root: one cause of all dharmas
- Branch: branch of awakening
- Trunk: one taste in emptiness
- Leaf: pervading dharmadhatu
- Flower: lamp of wisdom
- Fruit: three kayas self-complete
- Sound: sound of dharma-nature
- Smell: fame of buddha's speech
- Taste: taste of bliss of experience
- Touch: great concentration
- Music: complete mandala of five
- Canopy: potential of clear color
- Parasol: wisdom that protects
- Upper-canopy: great essential point of instruction
- Banner: buddha of manifest realization

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Then the key verse: "All dharmas in the face of mind itself abide in the manner of primordial spontaneous completion. Therefore, dharmas of mind and entity are all merely imputed."

This is the ultimate Dzogchen view: everything is spontaneously complete in rigpa. Body, mind, world—all are imputed, mere labels, while awareness is the fundamental reality.

[426-444]
Now transitioning to the second major topic: extensive explanation of inner arising. This has two parts: the common division and individual natures.

First: inner arising means the five elements of essence (subtle) rely upon the five coarse elements of the body. Wind, fire, earth, water, and space—each of the five abides as five, making twenty-five limbs (components).

The definite suitability: they're definite as five based on five different functions. From the Self-Arisen: the five great arising are complete in one's own body. Five winds make wisdom potential; five fires make wisdom potency; five earths make wisdom essence; five waters make wisdom object; five spaces make wisdom abode.

So each element has its subtle dimension that supports wisdom. This is describing the subtle body—the channels, winds, and essences that are the basis for completion stage practice.

[445-472]
Now we enter the detailed presentation of inner arising, starting with wind (*rlung*). This has two parts: root division and branch division.

Root division—five principal winds from the Self-Arisen:
1. Life-holding wind (*srog 'dzin*)—abides in the life channel (heart area)
2. Color-and-radiance-producing wind (*bkra gzi mdangs skyed*)—abides in the chest
3. Fire-equal wind (*me mnyam*)—abides in the navel
4. All-pervading wind (*kun khyab*)—pervades the whole body
5. Karma wind without compassion (*snying rje med pa bsKal pa las*)—abides between heart and heart-membrane

Their functions in sequence:
- Life-holding: maintains life
- Color-producing: produces radiance/complexion
- Fire-equal: digests food
- All-pervading: enables going and sitting (movement)
- Karma: performs life-transference (death process)

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

These winds aren't just physiological—they're the subtle energy that carries consciousness and supports the meditative experiences.

[473-473]
Second, branch division: each of the five winds subdivides into five, making 25 winds total. Rest in this understanding.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
