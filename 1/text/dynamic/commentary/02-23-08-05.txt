[14642-14661]
Third: This also dissolves, seeing primordially pure appearances, recognizing one's own face, obtaining the ground. Between these, those with sharp faculties are liberated in an instant. Those with lesser faculties dwell long, meditation days extending many days—like swift, slow, and very slow arrows going forward.

Sharp faculties' peak: In one instant, buddhahood. This too—bindu appearance ceases in one instant, spontaneously accomplished appearance ceases in one instant, primordially pure truth seen in one instant. This too—emanation from primordially pure ground not separate. All faculties' suchness obtained on the path.

This old fool once thought liberation took time! "I must purify my obscurations," he said. "I must accumulate merit." Meanwhile, liberation was immediate. Those with sharp faculties recognize instantly. Those with dull faculties wander in bardo. The difference is not time—it's recognition.

[14662-14680]
Like the example of a shooting star running in the sky. That shooting star, like radiating light, emanation opens, doing benefit for beings. Benefit capable in three days.

Sharp faculties' peak: One day dwelling in bardo. This too—four joining pristine awareness appearance, seeing one's own appearance. This too—from one's own eyes, pristine awareness fire two arisen. Weapon rain falling, all ceased. Appearance ceasing, non-existent dawning. That—one's own consciousness awakening. One's own object seen. Spontaneously accomplished ground certainty obtained. Again, shooting star-like, should know.

Mountain hermit understood: the shooting star doesn't practice to shine. It simply burns as it falls. Liberation is like this—natural, immediate, effortless. The fire of wisdom already burns. Recognition ignites it fully.

[14681-14702]
Sharp faculties' supreme: Two days Buddha. This too—bindu appearance dwelling one day. This too—from one's own heart, pristine awareness sun one dawns. From that, light rays radiate ten directions. From those light rays' tips, each each Tathagata body dawns. By that, appearance's objects all seen as body's nature. Then again, spontaneously accomplished appearance certainty obtained. Emanation capable of benefit in seven days. This too—shooting star-like.

Between the instant of recognition and the seven days of emanation, there is no contradiction. The recognition is immediate. The manifestation takes time. Like lightning strikes in a moment, but the thunder rolls across the valley—same event, different timing.

[14703-14709]
Supreme of the supreme: Four days dwelling in bardo. This too—seeing five bindus gathered clearly in front of oneself. From that, one's own latencies awaken. Dwelling one day in the eastern bindu. Likewise, dwelling one day in each of the four directional bindus. Then, obtaining certainty in spontaneously accomplished, becoming Buddha. Emanation capable of benefit in fourteen days.

This old practitioner once feared the bardo. "What if I don't recognize?" he worried. But the bindus are not obstacles—they are guides. The five lights are not distractions—they are the path. Fear creates the wandering. Recognition creates the liberation.

[14710-14736]
Sharp faculties' middle: Seeing after some days. Seeing on the fifth day. This too—thus: four days dwelling in bindu. One day dwelling in pristine awareness appearance. This too—from one's own heart, light rays like a horse's neigh arise. They come standing in the sky's expanse. Holding one's own eyes without distraction, looking, seeing one great bindu clearly gathered in the sky's center. From that, supreme confidence arisen. A knowing "this is mine" arises. Confidence like a child entering the mother's lap—this is called the instruction. Then, one's own rigpa dissolving into that—like a great arrow not returning back—this is called the instruction. Emanation capable of benefit in twenty-one days.

The bindu in the sky is not external. It is the heart's own light projected outward. The recognition is not finding something new. It is recognizing what was always the case. This is the profound crucial point.

[14737-14743]
This also—in three instants, according to individual faculties, dwelling different days, liberating in primordially pure appearance. Irreversible certainty obtained. Not having dissolved, at that time emanation spreads. According to how many days emanation spreads, dwelling that many days. Then emanation also, like sun's rays gathering at sunset, gathering into rigpa, dissolving into primordially pure ground. Investigating with sharp wisdom, there is one great essential point to be understood here.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why count the days? Why measure the faculties? Recognition liberates in an instant! The bardo is this moment! Liberate now!

[14744-14748]
Second: Seven middling faculties' liberation mode—five instants. From Blazing Lamp: "In the dharmata bardo, from the burning body, liberated in one instant."

Five instants: First instant, one's own individual appearances dawn. Second instant, awareness. Third instant, from that, bliss. Fourth instant, from that, joy. Fifth instant, knowing. These five complete, recognition.

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you live, while you die, the instants are the same. Recognition is recognition. Practice now, so that the five instants are familiar.

[14749-End]
Final instruction: the bardo is not a place of fear. It is the opportunity for liberation. Sharp faculties, middling faculties, dull faculties—all can liberate. The difference is preparation. Prepare now, recognizing the nature of mind. Then the bardo becomes the ground of awakening, not the door to wandering.

Emaho! The wonder of liberation in the bardo—instant, complete, naturally present. May all beings recognize and be free.
