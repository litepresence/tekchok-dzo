[15769-15777] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First: Body channels located. That wind located. Wind wisdom and karma wind two move. Wisdom wind nirvana ripen, karma wind samsara ripen. Dispute abandon, dispute establish and answer give two-from.

[15769-15777] Voice 13 (Patrul): In body, channels. In channels, winds. Two winds: wisdom and karma. Wisdom wind ripens to nirvana. Karma wind ripens to samsara. The fork in the road. Which wind do you feed?

[Final] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Channels. Winds. Two fruits: nirvana and samsara.
