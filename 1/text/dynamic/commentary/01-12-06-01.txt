[15769-15774]
In the body, channels abide. In the channels, winds abide. The winds move as two: wisdom wind and karma wind.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself. Wisdom wind ripens nirvana. Karma wind ripens samsara. This is the fork in the road where all beings stand.

[15769-15774]
This old practitioner once believed he could control the winds through force of will. He held his breath. He visualized channels. He strained until his body ached. The winds laughed at him. Control is karma wind. Recognition is wisdom wind.

[15769-15774]
See what is. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[15775-15777]
Objections arise. Answers follow. This is the play of mind investigating mind. But the winds do not need justification. They blow where they blow. Recognition turns karma wind into wisdom wind. Non-recognition turns wisdom wind into karma wind.

[15769-15777]
Thus. We proceed. Each word points beyond itself to direct experience.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

[15777]
See the nature (rang bzhin) of what appears. The winds have never moved. The mover is the movement. Recognize this. Rest.

[15769-15769]
Voice 20 proclaims: The winds are not entities traveling through channels like vehicles on roads. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness appearing as energy. When recognized, even the heaviest karma wind becomes light as wisdom wind.

[15769-15769]
This old hermit once felt his winds raging like a storm. Thoughts churned, emotions swirled, restlessness consumed him. Then he remembered: the storm is not separate from the sky. The winds are not separate from awareness. Resting in that, the storm became a dance.

[15769-15769]
Accordingly. The analysis. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[15769-15769]
Look. It is here. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

[15769-15769]
Voice 22 speaks with sudden wrath: Those who claim their winds are pure while others' are impure! Those who boast of clear channels and balanced winds! They mistake the sign for the destination. The channel is not the flow. The flow is not the ocean.

[15769-15769]
Between effort and surrender, the vast middle way opens. You cannot force the winds to become wisdom. You cannot suppress the karma winds. But you can recognize their nature, and in that recognition, they self-liberate. Like ice melting in warm water—no force needed.

[15769-15769]
This old man once. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[15769-15769]
In this manner. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

[15769-15769]
Voice 20 proclaims: In the end, there are no winds. There is no channel. There is no body. There is only awareness playing at being these things. This is the final teaching—not nihilism, but freedom. Play without bondage. Dance without attachment.

[15769-15769]
This old hermit offers final teaching: Don't be afraid of your winds. Don't worship them. Don't suppress them. Don't indulge them. Just recognize them as mind's display, and they become the path itself. Every breath becomes instruction. Every movement becomes teaching.

[15769-15769]
Recognize immediately.
