First: Body channels located. That wind located. Wind wisdom and karma wind two move. Wisdom wind nirvana ripen, karma wind samsara ripen. Dispute abandon, dispute establish and answer give two-from.

In body, channels. In channels, winds. Two winds: wisdom and karma. Wisdom wind ripens to nirvana. Karma wind ripens to samsara. The fork in the road. Which wind do you feed?

A friend once fed the karma wind exclusively. Every breath, every thought, every action—ripening samsara. He wandered in confusion for lifetimes. Then recognition dawned: the wisdom wind was also present, also breathing, also moving. He had been feeding the wrong wind out of habit, not necessity.

Three essential words: Recognize your nature. Rest in that recognition. Return when you wander. The channels are the pathways. The winds are the travelers. Two travelers on the same road—one leading to confusion, one to liberation. But they are not enemies. They are the same wind seen differently.

Mountain hermit felt the wind in his cave—sometimes gentle, sometimes fierce. He understood: the same wind can carry prayer flags or scatter them. The same wind can cool or destroy. It depends on recognition, not the wind itself.

Between the wisdom wind and the karma wind, we find the middle way. Not rejecting karma wind—it's the energy that fuels practice. Transforming it through recognition. The karma wind becomes wisdom wind when seen through. The transformation is not effort—it's recognition.

This wandering yogi met a master who asked: "Which wind moves in you now?" The yogi checked. Sometimes wisdom, sometimes karma. The master laughed. "They are the same wind. The distinction is recognition. Recognize.
both become wisdom."

Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why choose between winds? Recognition transforms all movement into wisdom wind! Stop discriminating and recognize!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you breathe in, while you breathe out, notice—which wind is this? Don't worry. Just notice. Recognition begins with noticing.

Final instruction: the two winds are not separate substances. They are one wind with two destinations based on recognition. Feed recognition.
both winds ripen to nirvana. This is the profound crucial point.

Emaho! The wonder of two winds, one channel, recognition transforming samsara into nirvana.
