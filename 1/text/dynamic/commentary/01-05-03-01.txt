First: two root tantras. Relying on eight root scriptures of perfect self-arisen: outer elaborations empower and ripen those who enjoy elaboration. Relying on six chapters of letterless tantra: upadesha points that ripen and liberate. Second: explanatory mother and child tantras. Eighty-six chapters of Rigpa Self-Arisen: view, meditation, conduct, result. Nine chapters of Rigpa Self-Liberated: elimination of mother's ground object.

[4659-4678]
Third: two limb tantras. Jewel Heap five chapters: qualities complete in themselves. Blazing Body-Relic three chapters: signs of body, speech, mind past and present. Fourth: two scripture-logic clear tantras. Sudden Sound six chapters: root of all scriptural collections. Auspicious Beauty seven chapters: identifying delusion's time. Fifth: four upadesha tantras. Vajra-Sattva Heart-Mirror eight chapters: introduction, meeting, empowerment, samaya. Samantabhadra Mind-Mirror seven chapters: deviation and obscuration elimination.

[4679-4698]
Sixth: three intention self-position tantras. Six Spaces six chapters: purifying six consciousnesses' birth-places, emptying three realms. Blazing Lamp four chapters: four actual lamps. Sun-Moon-Joined four chapters: carrying four intermediate states on path. Seventh: two entering self-liberation tantras. Lion-Power Dzogchen thirteen chapters: bringing out view's form. Jewel Arrangement fourteen chapters: entering yogi's path. Eighth: expert ritual tantras. Black Wrathful 108 chapters: protecting supreme teachings.

[4699-4718]
From Pearl Garland: All tantras—supreme wonder! Two great root tantras explain all phenomena as one essence. Two explanatory mother-child tantras: leaves spreading. Two limb tantras: planets and stars from oceans. Two scripture-logic clear tantras: flowers opening. Four upadesha tantras: ripening results. Three intention-self-abiding tantras: seeing the peak. Two entering-self-liberation tantras: mindful basis and heart. Expert ritual tantras: messenger dog.

[4719-4738]
Reason for eight sections: Without two root tantras, like trunk with rotten roots—branches cannot arise. Without explanatory mother-child, like no leaves—no flowers. Without limb tantras, like climbing cliff without limbs—falling. Without entering self-liberation, like corpse without heart—cannot benefit others. Without scripture-logic clear, like no flowers—results do not ripen.

[4739-4758]
Without four upadesha tantras, like no results—agriculture meaningless. Without three intention self-abiding, like person without eyes—cannot enter city. Without expert ritual tantra, like watchdog gone—wealth lost to thieves. Thus lacking eight, teaching's condition incomplete. If exist, complete. Eight appropriate and certain. More than that: not needed.

[4759-4778]
Accordingly. The analysis. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

Recognition happens in the gap between thoughts—the space you are reading these words from.

[4779-4798]
Recognize immediately. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

[4799-4818]
An old practitioner once collected all eight sections, binding them in brocade. He carried them on pilgrimage across the plateau. At every pass, he opened them. At every river, he read them. One night in a cave, the wind scattered the pages.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary. As he chased them by moonlight, he understood: the eight sections were not in the pages but in the moonlight, in the wind, in the chasing.

[4819-4838]
Between the root tantra and the ritual tantra, there is no hierarchy. Like eight directions from a center—each complete, each necessary. The practitioner who recognizes this stops preferring one section over another. All eight are your own awareness displayed as teaching.

[4839-4847]
This old man once. The treasury reveals what was never hidden, only overlooked.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[4639-4639]
Recognition is immediate. The recognition that liberates is always immediate, never gradual.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[4639-4639]
In this manner. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[4639-4639]
See your own face.
 The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.
