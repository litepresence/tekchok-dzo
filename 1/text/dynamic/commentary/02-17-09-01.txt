[3124-3197] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): First, mirror image appearing appearance, outer-inner dharmas no difference, true grasping what doing? All illusion image appearance certain, aspiration not distracted, whatever appears illusion image meditate. Especially own form mirror appearing, clothes putting, ornaments giving, those removed outside throwing, praising, unpleasant, etc., doing, that form there appearing but meaning not established like, appearing this self-other, enemy-friend, food-clothes, enjoyment, pleasant-unpleasant, denial-assertion, birth-death, happiness-suffering, illness, whatever arises whatever remembered whatever appears samsara-nirvana dharmas all mirror inside image like, appearing time itself essence none, knowing.

[3124-3197] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Mirror. Image. Stop. You see the mirror and think something appears. The mirror is empty. The image is empty. The seeing is empty. Three emptinesses, one recognition. Your form in the mirror—put clothes, remove clothes, praise, criticize—the mirror doesn't change. You are the mirror.

[3124-3197] Voice 13 (Patrul): This old man once spent a week looking at his reflection in a mountain lake. Each day different—clear, rippled, foggy, bright. The reflection changed; the lake didn't. Then one day—no difference between reflection and lake. That was the turning.

[3124-3197] Voice 06 (Padmasambhava): The mirror is the consort's face—reflecting all, grasping none. The illusion-body is her dance—appearing, transforming, dissolving. When you see all samsara-nirvana as mirror-images, you are the mirror, not the reflected.

[3124-3197] Voice 20 (Lion-Faced): ILLUSION! MIRROR! speaks with fierce compassion I will smash these concepts! The image is not illusion! The mirror is not truth! BOTH EMPTY! The one who sees the image is also empty! LIBERATION!

[3148-3168] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): From Drumsound Sutra: "Mirror mandala completely pure, face image appearing like, how essence not established, Drumsound dharmas know!" And from Samadhi King Sutra: "How night water moons, clear muddy without lake appearing, water moon empty fake essence without, dharmas all thus know! How people many center, magician by forms emanating, horse elephant vehicle various making, to them not true various appearing like, dharmas all thus know!"

[3148-3168] Voice 01 (Garab Dorje): Three words. Moon. Water. Stop. You see the moon in water and think it's real. Then you think it's fake. Both are thoughts. The water-moon is the nature of all appearance—clear, ungraspable, beautiful, empty. Stop analyzing. Start recognizing.

[3169-3197] Voice 10 (Longchenpa): Second, nighttime illusion-body dream training: as before, all appearances dream knowing, appearance existence all illusion dream power-trained, birth-death denial-assertion delusion appearance all illusion dream mastered. In dream also thus arising, attachment sesame-none. From that: "How young girl's dream, man arising dying seeing, arising joy dying not joy like, dharmas all thus know!" Thus day-night illusion-body trained, delusion appearance true-grasping none, body also completely hollow, shadow form like appearing but essence none, body shadowless, bardo illusion-body held, doubt none.

[Final] The illusion-body—mirror's image, water's moon, magician's creation. All appear, none established. Train in daytime, master at night, recognize in bardo. The body becomes hollow, shadow-like, essenceless. This is the illusory body of the Great Perfection.

Emaho! The yogi of the illusion-body!

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

See what is. Rest in recognition.
