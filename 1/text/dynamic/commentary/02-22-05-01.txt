Thus possessing person, three bodies sixteen months obtaining." This is the treasury's heart.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

[11480-11482]
The result Each word points beyond itself to direct experience. Rest in this understanding.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

[11480-11486]
When wrathful kaya arises Each word points beyond itself to direct experience. Recognition is immediate.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

[11480-11505]
Unmatured relics exist potentially; through practice they mature into five types: shariram (bone essence), chariram (flesh), churiram (blood), beriram (body), nyariram (karma). These are not ordinary remains—they are wisdom essence manifesting! From the Blazing Relics Tantra

[11481-11505]
Thus. Four, body signs: essence, definition, differentiation, characteristic, result five. Essence: empty appearance uncompounded, five lights' essence body. Definition: empty appearance nature body, nature light compassion body, three bodies possessing. Differentiation: dharmakaya light body, sambhogakaya enjoyment body, nirmanakaya emanation body three; fully complete, partial, various; peaceful, wrathful, semi-peaceful semi-wrathful.

[11483-11498]
is liberation according to sequence: when both peaceful and wrathful arise, consciousness dissolves into space and dharmakaya's self-radiance dawns—liberation without bardo, included in this life's liberation! This is the treasury's heart.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

Emaho!

[11487-11505]
, from the eyes Vajrasattva's nose-thread appears, sound-light-ray three self-appear, and liberation comes in five moments! The nature is complete.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The text quotes extensively

[11506-11530]
Characteristic: wisdom's display body, not other than light, not different from bindu, spontaneously arisen, unceasing, unobstructed. Result: benefitting beings without effort, three times transcended, pure land displaying. Briefly body's nature light, body not other than light. From Relic Blazing: "Body habituated whoever, light body clear light body, wisdom's display body, effortless spontaneous body, not meditation meditation body, not maintaining maintained body. Thus possessing person, three bodies sixteen months obtaining."

[11506-11526]
: "If both arise, without bardo one becomes Buddha." This is the measure of confidence in great ka-dag! Whether through five days or five moments, recognition is the key—not the duration but the depth of seeing.

Peaceful kaya's arising

[11506-11536]
: "The supreme being who passes beyond sorrow—relics of all buddhas arise. From distinctions of buddha families, relics arise five by five." This is your potential made manifest!

The specific distinctions

[11527-11540]
connects through clear light to ka-dag, so spontaneous presence's emanation does not arise from bardo. Rest in this understanding.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What is called delusion here is wisdom's play of hide-and-seek, spontaneously self-liberating. But wrathful kaya

[11527-11556]
are beautifully described: shariram white and radiant, chariram dark blue, churiram yellow, beriram red, nyariram green—all round and smooth like sesame seeds, containing fivefold light at their core. Rest in this understanding.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

From the Blazing Relics

[11531-11555]
Thus. Five, rigpa signs: essence, definition, differentiation, characteristic, result five. Essence: self-clear non-dual awareness, three bodies' essence rigpa. Definition: own nature thus rigpa, essence awareness, nature clarity, compassion knowing. Differentiation: dharmakaya essence rigpa, sambhogakaya nature rigpa, nirmanakaya compassion rigpa three; abiding, moving, arising.

Emaho!

[11537-11571]
explain colors: blue-black Vajra family, white Buddha family, yellow Ratna, red Padma, green Karma. These indicate the pure realm of liberation—Vajrasattva's realm for blue, Vairochana's for white, and so forth.

Shariram

[11541-11571]
—through sound-light-ray self-appearing—allows emanation after twenty-one samadhi days. This is the treasury's heart.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

This distinction

[11556-11580]
Characteristic: self-knowing other unknown, self-clear other not clear, three times transcended, four extremes liberated. Result: buddhahood spontaneously arisen, benefitting beings effortlessly, pure land displaying. Briefly rigpa's nature clear light, rigpa not other than light. From Relic Blazing: "Rigpa habituated whoever, self-clear rigpa, wisdom's display rigpa, effortless spontaneous rigpa, not meditation meditation rigpa, not maintaining maintained rigpa. Thus possessing person, three bodies sixteen months obtaining."

[11557-11570]
: peaceful relics liberate into self-appearing certainty of their respective families; wrathful relics achieve dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya, effective enlightenment kaya, and unchanging vajra kaya. Five relics, five kayas—inseparable!

The text quotes

[11571-11586]
: "Shariram achieves unborn, churiram achieves effective, chariram achieves sambhogakaya, nyariram achieves nirmanakaya, pancharam achieves vajra nature." This is not mere poetry—it is the direct correlation between practice and result!

Ringsel

[11572-11597]
is profound: peaceful dissolves completely into ka-dag; wrathful maintains the basis for emanation. Like a lamp extinguished versus a lamp covered, the result differs though both are light.

The place

[11572-11586]
is the size of a mustard seed, white and radiant—like a tiny sun containing infinite light. This is bone's essence purified, appearing when the channels' wind has matured the dharmakaya nature.

Emaho!

[11581-11605]
Thus. These five light expanse thigle body rigpa signs arising, deluded display clear light liberated, five poisons self-liberated, five wisdoms spontaneously arisen, meditation path measure obtained. From Rangshar: "Rigpa unchanging horse riding, true light always depending, thigle bindu clearly seen, body light sphere appearing, expanse vastness abiding, thus five signs possessing, thod rgal path completed, three bodies spontaneously obtained."

[11587-11613]
differs from relics—they are similar but ringsel can be destroyed by elements, while relics cannot. Ringsel are like the husk; relics are like the seed.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Both indicate liberation, but relics are indestructible, like a diamond that survives the fire that burns the mountain.

The locations

[11598-11613]
is the crucial point of difficult Döndam Wangchuk's great secret seal—understand this well! Not even skilled teachers should speak of it casually; recognize it as my blessing.

Emaho!

[11606-11630]
Thus. Therefore fortunate practitioner, you should practice thus, signs arising not attached, not arising not discouraged, naturally resting in own place. From Treasury: "Who thus practices, buddhahood this life obtaining, not next life, not bardo, dharmata's nature realized, spontaneous three bodies complete." Thus.

[11614-11644]
where they arise: shariram from the crown, chariram from between the ribs, churiram from above the liver, beriram from the kidneys, nyariram from above the lungs. Each location corresponds to an element's purification.

Emaho!

[11619-11621]
—arising from pure elements meeting practiced awareness's self-radiance. It manifests as three types: upward-reaching, radiating spokes, and surrounding aureole.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.

What appears here is not a concept to understand but the nature of mind revealing itself.

Or

[11625-11635]
: like a ladder reaching to the sky, or like a dome of light appearing in space's center. The result: if aureole appears, liberation in first bardo; if reaching upward, dissolution into ka-dag without bardo; if radiating spokes, enlightenment in final bardo's time.

The Vajrasattva Mirror teaches

[11631-11655]
Thus twenty-first chapter completed, showing thod rgal wisdom practice key points, introduction depending symbolizing, and signs certainty sequence explained. These paths all supreme secret Heart Essence's special doctrine, fortunate ones with former life training should practice.

Emaho!

[11636-11641]
: "Light appearing like a house—five days to stability, manifest buddhahood. Light like a ladder—seven days to manifest buddhahood." The duration indicates the depth of recognition.

The Blazing Relics states

[11642-11655]
: "Light has three aspects—surrounding aureole with circumference from whose trail it arises: this achieves certainty in first bardo. If reaching upward, without bardo, instantly Buddha. If radiating from spokes, in final bardo finds manifest enlightenment."

When lhundrub appears

[11656-11680]
Thus the path of thod rgal has been fully explained—the lamp gazing, the four visions arising, the light displays, and the signs of realization. You who practice, do not be lazy! The bindus of light are your own rigpa's display, not external objects. Like a face in a mirror, they appear yet have no true existence.

[11656-11667]
, emanations spread to benefit beings everywhere. This is the great play—recognizing your own nature, then naturally benefiting others without effort, like a lamp that illuminates simply by being lit.

Emaho!

[11669-11682]
—what the ear faculty hears. Distinctions: unpleasant, pleasant, and middling, but here the peaceful dharma-sound (long, slow, continuous) and wrathful thunder-sound (short, fierce)—called ur and thug.

Causes

[11678-11682]
: general cause is elemental; here arising from stability attainment. This is the treasury's heart.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from.

The path described is not walked but realized as the ground itself, never departed from. Result: sambhogakaya and emanating nirmanakaya. The peaceful sound

[11681-11705]
When you see the smoke-like, mirage-like, and rainbow displays, know these are the signs of wisdom dawning. Do not grasp at them, do not reject them—rest evenly in their nature. As the bindus expand into forms and mandalas, recognize them as your own face. This is the crucial point.

[11683-11693]
brings stability in seven samadhi days from peaceful kaya; wrathful sound brings liberation to wrathful kaya. Rest in this understanding.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The five families

[11694-11715]
determine direction: from the east Vajra family, south Ratna, west Padma, north Karma, above Tathagata. Listen for the sound's direction when the yogin passes—it reveals the family of buddhahood!

The text quotes

[11706-11730]
The five lamps shine from within—the lamp of the heart, the lamp of the pure channels, the lamp of the eyes, and the others. The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Through these, the light of wisdom naturally radiates outward.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching. Day and night, in all activities, maintain this recognition.

[11716-11719]
: "From ur arises in seven days, from thug in fourteen days manifest buddhahood." Duration indicates intensity of recognition—fierce recognition, swift result!

Sound is not mere vibration

[11720-11735]
—it is the dharmata's voice, your own nature declaring itself. Like an echo that reveals the presence of a canyon, sound reveals the depth of realization. Those who hear with recognition are liberated upon hearing; those who hear without recognition merely accumulate causes.

Emaho!

[11721-11725]
—the container world's foundation, support of sentient beings. Cause: the passing being's power moving wind. Distinctions: great shaking, greater shaking, completely great shaking, and universal great shaking—four types.

The result

[11726-11735]
: ordinary beings achieve bodhisattva grounds and so forth. This is the treasury's heart.

The distinction made in this passage dissolves the distinction-maker—seeing this is the teaching.

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

[11731-11735]
The four visions arise progressively—from direct perception of dharmata, to the increase of experience, to the perfection of rigpa, and finally to the exhaustion of phenomena. The nature is complete.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The treasury opens by revealing there was never anything to open—already complete, always was.
