[8674-8675]
Second joy—feeling, the contact-point. Like stone entering water—not the
stone, not water, but contact creating ripples. Tshor ba, where knowing
and known meet.

[8676-8677]
This wanderer sat by hot spring, steam rising through frozen air. Heat
touched face—what was feeling? Not heat, not face, but something between
belonging to neither. Second joy is contact itself as bliss.

[8678-8679]
Spyod—engagement, how one moves with experience. Like dancer becoming dance.
Experience indistinguishable from experiencer.

[8680-8681]
Contact. Empty. Rest. Three words—or maybe just one: Feel. The contact
is feeling. The emptiness is feeling. The resting is feeling. All one
taste, three descriptions.

[8682-8683]
See. Feeling of sitting, breathing—this is second joy. Not peak experience.
Ordinary contact recognized as wisdom's display. Emaho!
