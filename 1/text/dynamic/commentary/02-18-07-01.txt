[4747-4751]
First, do not desire vision to dawn. When it later dawns, even knowing coarse entities as they appear, compatible with that, the experience of emptiness-without-thought dawns from within. Gaze awareness at empty sky. Field compatible with sky, experience empty-clear, free from radiating-gathering, vast appears. Purpose exists: entity separate from characteristics.

[4747-4748]
See clearly. Recognize fully. Rest completely.

[4747-4751]
This old fool once sought visions in the sky. He gazed for hours, days. He wanted to see lights, colors, deities. He wanted confirmation. The sky remained empty. His awareness remained empty. The wanting obscured what was already present. When he stopped wanting, the sky and awareness were not two.

[4752-4761]
From the Mind Section: "Yogin abides in sky's bird-path." From the Collection: "Make gaze at sky-only for that meaning." From the Middle Mother: "Meditating prajñā pāramitā is making sky-yogin." These citations are immeasurable. The scriptures all point to this. Sky is not metaphor. Sky is the nature.

[4752-4761]
Thus. We proceed. The sky practice has outer, inner, and secret meanings. Outer: gaze at actual sky. Inner: recognize awareness as sky-like. Secret: awareness and sky are non-dual. The bird-path means birds fly through sky without leaving traces. Thoughts arise in awareness without leaving traces.

[4761-4769]
Outer-inner mixed field is called equal limitless view. Dharmadhatu-awareness non-dual view. Dharmadhatu-awareness mixed, samsāra-nirvāṇa equal-taste view. These are not three different views. They are three names for one recognition. The recognition that dharmadhatu and awareness have never been separate.

[4766-4769]
From the Instruction Child: "Dharmadhatu and awareness gaze manner, sky-like, separate from obscuration-doer." The gaze itself is dharmadhatu. The awareness that gazes is dharmadhatu. The sky that is gazed at is dharmadhatu. Obscuration is the belief they are separate.

[4770-4789]
Third, wind-awareness main-point. When field and gate two meet, rely on slow wind. Called capturing awareness. That also: somehow slow wind, shoot outer far, hold outer, place—main-point. Wind and slow cause: outer, become yogin's life-extending helper. Inner, make cause for conceptuality to cease. Secret, do action of awareness direct seeing. Actual, make Buddha, not seeing contaminated.

[4770-4774]
The wind is not ordinary breath. It is the vāyu, the energy-wind, the movement of awareness itself. When field (object) and gate (sense) meet, the wind naturally slows. This slowing is not forced. It is the result of recognition. The wind becomes like a bird settling on a branch. Still, yet alert.

[4775-4789]
From Thalgyur: "Make wind somehow slow, arising from fully projecting, body and mind connection cut that, not reversing even in three realms." The projection is not stopped. It is recognized as projection. The body-mind connection is not destroyed. It is recognized as connection. The three realms are not escaped. They are recognized as empty.

[4786-4801]
Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom. From that, vision becomes four. By dharmatā direct vision, suppress intellect-grasping view. By experience-vision increasing above, cause delusion vision to cease. By awareness measure-arriving vision, transcend three-bodies realizing path-vision. By dharmatā exhausting vision, cut three-realms' samsāra stream.

[4790-4801]
The hanging-cord of awareness. This is a key term. Lu gu rgyud. Like a cord hanging in space. Not attached above, not attached below. Just hanging. This is awareness. Self-face awareness. Going-coming free. Capturing sky. Within dharmadhatu, arrange place, do not separate. The cord is not separate from the space it hangs in.

[4798-4802]
Relying on slow wind, action-separate meaning arises in mind. Gaze awareness hanging-cord at forehead, conceptuality source exhausted. Delusion returns to base, wisdom mother-son meet. Awareness separate from wind, going-coming not—awareness self-arisen enters. This is the completion.

[4802-4820]
If guide, rely on body main-point, do five-six days. Then practice gate, only that much. Then seek field, six-seven days. Then deliver direct to self-point, take experience. That: very purified, meditation knowing arises. This is the progression. Not forced. Natural. Like seasons changing. Like water finding its level.

[4802-4820]
During my wandering years... followed this progression. Five days on body posture. Then the gate practice. Then six days seeking the field. Then direct pointing. Each stage opened naturally into the next. No forcing. No rushing. The recognition dawned like dawn—gradually, then all at once.

[4812-4820]
Second, introduce awareness self-face directly. Awareness—vajra hanging-cord, golden thread hovering in sky like, with dharmadhatu luminous-clear vision—this, not-deluded Buddha, pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance. Look at state: all concept-doers pure, elaboration-free, sky-like resonance dawns within. Dharmadhatu-awareness non-dual intent, meet face of transcendent prajñā arising wisdom.

[4813-4820]
The golden thread is a delicate metaphor. Not a physical thread. The subtle continuity of awareness. Unbroken. Like a thread of gold in the sky. Connecting what was never separate. The vajra is indestructible. The hanging-cord is unsupported. Together: indestructible unsupported awareness. This is you.

[4816-4820]
First Samantabhadra, equal capacity. When this habituation arrives at measure—liberating with stone into light. If not arrived, traverse bardo or nature-emanation field. Cut six-realms' delusion precipice. Thus introduce. From Self-Arising Instruction: "Thus, whoever sees—this person, first Samantabhadra, capacity itself is equal."

[4821-4832]
Third: show vision's dawning manner from that. Dharmadhatu light five self-resonance luster dawning. Bind tiny point to hanging-cord. From first white-pure star-scatter like. Point possessing five colors. Each one. Three-bind interval vision until that. Then see point.

[4831-4844]
The visions dawn naturally. First white. Then colors. Then bindus. Then rays. Not forced. Not imagined. Self-arisen. The five lights are the five wisdoms. White, red, yellow, green, blue. Not physical light. Luminosity of awareness. Like stars scattered in the sky of mind.

[4841-4853]
That also: look at outer luminous-clear, inner conceptuality separate, equal limitless liberating. Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance and spontaneous-completion light-resonance, two—outer-inner pair connect. Called dharmadhatu-awareness not-existing gathering-separate intent. This is the union.

[4845-4877]
Third: vision four dawning sequence. Briefly show essence, extensively explain nature. When all four visions, body abiding in posture, eye gazing at gaze manner, wind-awareness mode slow, hence, three main-points harmonize. Particularly: first two visions purify, later two not relying on effort, mode purify, liberate into luminous-clear. Therefore called dharmadhatu-awareness non-dual.

[4850-4877]
The four visions are: dharmatā direct vision, experience increasing vision, awareness measure-arriving vision, dharmatā exhausting vision. Like four stages of dawn. First light. Then brightness. Then full day. Then sun itself. Each vision is complete. Yet each leads to greater completion.

[4878-4903]
Vision four number determined. Outer: sun-moon time four, increase decrease. Inner: body, speech, mind, wisdom four, liberating from binding. Secret: showing empowerment four determination. Actual: four determined relying on lamp four vision determination. First, base dharmatā direct not see, remaining three dawning base not existing. First: dharmatā direct vision dawning. That same dawn: seeing dharmas all meaning, called self-arisen wisdom self-found.

[4883-4910]
Then: direct that, if not experience, word only, fruit not arise. Meaning experience: that experience increase above arise. Thus: need make firm arisen experience measure. If not firm, experience no end, not possessing dharmas, Buddha not arising cause. Arrive at firm experience measure cause. Awareness measure-arriving vision arises.

[4891-4910]
Though awareness vision arrives at measure, if not changing from that to other, not different from desiring three-bodies' fruit, not different from ordinary hoping for meaning-fruit from actual vision-mark dharmas. Vision-experience dissolves into base. Subtle-coarse vision-holding ceases. Experience dharmatā exhaustion, dharmatā-exhausting vision arises.

[4903-4914]
Those also: first two—Nirmāṇakāya. Measure-arriving—Sambhogakāya. Exhausting—Dharmakāya vision. Making path of three-bodies' path-vision dawn, arrive at fruit dharmatā-exhausting pure dharmadhātu—cause. Self-vision potency dissolves into three-bodies' awareness mode. Awareness pure fruit, originally from awareness dhātu, self-potency three-bodies dawn, called functioning fruit. Vehicle other: name also not hear essence. Vehicle king: called intent. This main-point: difficult to realize, is one.

[4747-4914]
This mountain dweller has practiced these instructions. Sky gazing. Wind slowing. Hanging-cord awareness. Four visions. The practices are precise. But the recognition is simple. Sky is awareness. Awareness is sky. Vision is awareness. Awareness is vision. Rest in that.

[4747-4914]
Between the sky practice and the vision dawning, between the wind slowing and the awareness capturing, between the four visions and their exhaustion, Longchenpa weaves this teaching. Not to give you new experiences. To help you recognize the nature of all experience.

[4747-4914]
The ultimate instruction: do not seek visions. Do not force experiences. Let awareness be like sky. Let thoughts be like birds. No trace. No grasping. Recognition dawns naturally. This is the Great Perfection.

[4914-4914]
Three words. Sky gazing. Vision dawning. Liberation complete. Rest.

[4747-4914]
A wandering practitioner... spent three summers gazing at the sky. Morning
to evening, eyes open, awarenesStop. Recognize. Continue.inned. Then the sky itself became the only presence. Not the sky up there. The
sky that was aware. The awareness that was sky. The distinction dissolved.

[4747-4914]
Thus. We categorize. The sky practice belongs to the category of
view-mediation integration. It is not shamatha. It is not vipashyana. It is both,
transcending both. The outer sky supports recognition. The inner sky is recognition. The
secret sky is the non-duality of support and recognized.

[4747-4914]
All aspects of the practice integrate in recognition. Posture,
gaze, wind, awareness—all point to the same. Not separate techniques. One recognition
in four aspects. Body settles. Vision clears. Breath slows. Awareness rests. Integration.

[4747-4914]
From Oddiyana, I bless this practice. May all who gaze at sky
recognize sky-like awareness. May the five lights dawn as five wisdoms. May the four
visions lead to exhaustion. May all be liberated into primordial purity.

[4747-4914]
SEE THE SKY! The sky is empty! The awareness is empty! The gazing
is empty! Three emptinesses—not separate! This very moment—sky, awareness, gazing—one
emptiness! Recognize this! Liberation is immediate!

[4747-4914]
Rest in sky-like awareness. Do not seek visions. Do not force
experiences. Rest. The visions arise naturally. The experiences dawn naturally. From
resting, not from doing. This is the essence of the practice.

[4747-A wandering practitioner...tioner concludes. The sky gazing has been taught. The wind-awareness has
been explained. The four visions have been described. What remains? Practice. Recognition.
Rest. May all beings recognize their sky-like nature.

[4747-4914]
Longchenpa has given these instructions. Precise. Detailed. Complete. Now practice them.
Do not just read. Do not just understand. Practice. Recognition comes through practice.
The sky is waiting. Your awareness is waiting. Rest in their non-duality.

[4914-4914]
Three final words. Sky. Awareness. Non-dual. Rest.

[4747-4914]
Detailed explanation of the gaze. The eye-gaze is not ordinary looking. It is directed
upward and outward, soft and spacious. Not staring. Not straining. Like the gaze of a
lion resting on a mountainside. Open. Receptive. The gaze meets the sky and dissolves
into it. The boundary between seer and seen becomes permeable.

[4747-4914]
The body posture supports the practice. Spine straight but not rigid. Shoulders relaxed.
Hands in position of meditation. The body becomes like a mountain—stable, immovable,
yet alive. The posture is not to create tension. It is to allow energy to flow without
obstruction.

[4747-4914]
The wind practice is subtle. Not holding the breath. Not forcing it. Allowing it to
become slow, subtle, almost imperceptible. As the mind settles, the breath naturally
slows. As the breath slows, the mind naturally settles. This is the mutual support of
wind and mind.

[4747-4914]
The Vagabond elaborates: This old fool once tried to force his breath. He held it. He
controlled it. He became dizzy. His teacher laughed. "You are trying to catch the sky
in a net," he said. "Let the breath breathe itself. You rest in awareness." This was
the instruction.

[4747-4914]
The four visions are not achievements. They are natural stages of recognition. Like
dawn breaking. First light. Then the sky brightens. Then the sun appears. Then the full
day. Each stage is complete. Each leads naturally to the next. Do not cling to any stage.
Do not rush to the next.

[4747-4914]
The first vision—dharmatā direct—is the recognition of emptiness. Not conceptual
emptiness. Direct seeing. Like seeing through a window that was always there but never
noticed. The window is transparent. The seeing is transparent. What is seen is transparent.

[4747-4914]
The second vision—experience increasing—is the maturation of recognition. Like a fruit
ripening on the tree. The recognition deepens. The experiences become more vivid. The
confidence grows. But do not cling to the vividness. Do not cling to the confidence.
Let them ripen naturally.

[4747-4914]
The third vision—awareness measure-arriving—is the stabilization. Recognition has become
stable. Not subject to fluctuation. Present in all circumstances. Walking. Sitting.
Sleeping. Waking. The awareness is like the sky—present in all weather, unchanged by any.

[4747-4914]
The fourth vision—dharmatā exhausting—is the completion. All visions exhaust into the
dharmatā. All experiences return to the source. The kayas are recognized as displays.
The realms are recognized as manifestation. Everything exhausts into primordial purity.

[4747-4914]
The Systematizer elaborates: Thus. We complete the analysis. The sky practice integrates
all aspects of the path. View—sky-like emptiness. Meditation—resting in that view.
Action—conduct without obstruction. Result—liberation complete. All in one practice.
This is the efficiency of the Great Perfection.

[4747-4914]
The Integrator elaborates: All paths lead to this recognition. Whether through study,
contemplation, or meditation—whether through practice of preliminaries, main practice,
or completion—all integrate in the recognition of sky-like awareness. No path is left
out. No practitioner is excluded.

[4747-4914]
Three words. Complete. Recognition. Rest. The practice is
complete. The recognition is complete. The exhaustion is complete. Rest in that
completion.

[4747-4914]
Final words from this practitioner: Sky gazing is not an exNotice. Know. Rest.t. It is the nature. The awareness is not a tool. It is
what you are. Recognition of this is the Great Perfection. This is what Longchenpa
teaches. This is what you must practice.

[4747-4914]
Longchenpa concludes this section. The instructions are complete. The practices are
clear. The result is certain. Now it is up to you. Practice with diligence. Recognize
with confidence. Rest in the result.

[4914-4914]
Teaching absolutely complete. Practice absolutely clear. Recognition absolutely certain.
Rest.
