Listen, dear friend! Empty sky, awareness empty place—field sky accord, experience empty-clear, free from elaboration, wonderful appears! Entity characteristics-free purpose exists!

[4752-4760]
From Mind School: "Yogi abides in sky's bird-path!" From Condensed: "Analyze meaning that in empty sky!" From Middle Mother: "Meditating prajna paramita is sky yoga!" These citations immeasurable!

[4761-4763]
Also outer-inner mixed equal, limitless view called. Dharmadhatu-awareness non-dual view called.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition.

Longchenpa points to what cannot be pointed to; the finger and moon are one in recognition. Dharmadhatu-awareness mixed, samsara-nirvana equal-taste view called!

Do you see? Sky-like! No bird-path tracks! No meditation object! Just sky-like awareness!

Emaho! Sky-like view of Great Perfection!

[4790-4793]
Listen here, dear practitioner! From that itself: "Self-face awareness hanging-cord, going-coming free, sky held!" From Instructions: "Within dharmadhatu hanging-cord, placed not separate!"

[4794-4801]
Also wind slow rely, deed-free meaning tantra arises! Awareness hanging-cord A placed, conceptuality source exhausted, delusion base return, wisdom mother-son meet! Awareness wind free, going-coming not—awareness self-matured!

[4802-4804]
Guiding: rely on body main-point, do five-six days! Then gate use, only that much! Then field seek, six-seven days!

What is termed difficult is only difficult for the one who thinks attainment is necessary.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Do you see? The hanging-cord is your own awareness! Not separate from dharmadhatu! Place the A, exhaust conceptuality, mother-son meet! This is direct!

Emaho! Hanging-cord of awareness—direct path!
