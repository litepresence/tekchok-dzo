## CHAPTER 6: Ripening and Liberation Empowerments

**Tibetan:** རིམ་ཁང་དྲུག་པ། (Sixth Lecture Hall)  
**Location:** Volume 1, Sections 01-06-01-01 through 01-06-14-01  
**Tibetan Lines:** 6801-9708  
**Total Liturgical Lines:** ~2,907

This chapter presents the most extensive treatment in the entire text of tantric empowerments (dbang)—the initiatory transmissions that ripen the student's continuum and establish the necessary foundation for all subsequent Vajrayāna practice. Following the systematic presentation of vehicles in Chapter 5, Longchenpa now turns to the specific ritual technologies through which the Guru transmits realization to the disciple.

The chapter operates on two interconnected levels: the **outer** level of proper conduct, qualifications, and preparation; and the **inner** level of the actual empowerments that awaken the disciple's dormant Buddha-nature. This dual structure reflects the Vajrayāna principle that proper container (qualified student) and proper content (authentic empowerment) must coincide for realization to arise.

### **Section 1: 01-06-01-01.txt (317 lines)**  
**Topic:** Guru and Student Qualifications

This foundational section establishes the prerequisites for entering the Vajrayāna path. Longchenpa details:

**Types of Gurus:**
- **Root Guru** (rtsa ba'i bla ma): Possessing four defining marks—empowerment as basis, tantra explanation, oral instruction transmission, and continuing practice
- **Branch Guru** (yan lag gi bla ma): Possessing two or three qualifications depending on transmission depth
- **Training Masters to Avoid:** Ten characteristics of false teachers including pride, ignorance, samaya-breaking, and inability to answer questions

**Qualified Student:**
- Ten essential dharmas including devotion, faith, diligence, wisdom, and samaya-keeping
- Twelve characteristics from the Self-Arisen Tantra emphasizing faith, humility, and Vajra-commitment
- Students to abandon: those without respect, who break samaya, or who lack proper lineage

**The Guru-Student Relationship:**
- Three aspects of common Dharma: mutual contemplation, reliance and supplication, definite purpose
- The "lion's milk in clay vessel" analogy—why secret teachings must be kept from unqualified recipients
- Proper procedure for requesting empowerment: years of preparation, maṇḍala offerings, and guru yoga

### **Section 2: 01-06-02-01.txt (92 lines)**  
**Topic:** Timing and Astrological Considerations

This section presents the temporal dimensions of empowerment conferral, distinguishing three levels of elaboration:

**Empowerment with Elaboration:**
- **Four favorable years:** Rat, dragon, horse, pig
- **Four favorable months:** The first months of each season
- **Favorable days:** Waxing moon from first to full moon
- **Favorable times:** Midday or midnight
- **Student requirements:** Harmonious elements, proper numbers (50-100), samaya-possession

**Empowerment without Elaboration:**
- No year distinction required
- Summer and winter favorable
- Dawn time when sounds clear
- Limited to 5-6 faithful students (maximum 7)

**Extremely Unelaborated Empowerment:**
- Self-suitable timing based on individual capacity
- Outer timing: seed-planting season for supporting awakening
- Inner timing: waxing moon for stabilizing experience
- Connected to the "fourth" empowerment of direct introduction

**Scripture Citations:** Self-Arisen, various astrological tantras

### **Section 5: 01-06-05-01 through 05-05 (Joy Subsections)**

These five brief subsections present the **Five Joys** (dga' ba lnga) that arise through the progression of empowerment:

**5.1 First Joy** (dga' ba): Entering the wisdom of Jñāna through wind propelling and gathering
**5.2 Second Feeling** (tshor ba): Engaging with the object of experiential contact
**5.3 Third Bliss** (bde ba): The stirring of mind and Jñāna together
**5.4 Fourth Experience** (myong ba): Non-dual recognition of mind and Jñāna
**5.5 Fifth Emptiness** (stong pa): Beyond opening/closing, transcending extremes and distinctions

These five correspond to the progressive dissolution of conceptual mind into non-dual wisdom.

## READING GUIDANCE

**For Practitioners:**
This chapter is **essential reading** for anyone receiving or preparing for Vajrayāna empowerments. Pay special attention to:
- The qualities of qualified Gurus and how to examine them (Section 1)
- The proper timing and preparation for receiving empowerment (Section 2)
- The significance of each of the four empowerments (Sections 3-4)
- The guru-student relationship dynamics (Sections 1, 7)

**Warning:** Section 4 contains explicit instructions on sexual yoga that should only be practiced under direct guidance from a qualified teacher. The text itself warns about "pouring lion's milk into clay vessels"—giving advanced teachings to unqualified students.

**For Scholars:**
Note Longchenpa's sophisticated integration of:
- **Tantric hermeneutics:** The fourfold division (outer/inner/secret/perfect) applied to each empowerment
- **Medical knowledge:** Detailed anatomical descriptions of channels and vital points
- **Astrological timing:** Integration of elemental cycles with practice
- **Ethical frameworks:** The samaya system as protection for practitioner and lineage
- **Historical awareness:** References to lineage holders like Vimalamitra and debates about practice authenticity

**Critical Points:**
1. Without proper empowerment, Vajrayāna practice bears no fruit (Section 1)
2. The guru-student relationship is the foundation of the entire path (Section 1)
3. The four empowerments progressively ripen body, speech, mind, and all three together (Sections 3-4, 12)
4. The Five Joys map the stages of dissolution from ordinary consciousness to wisdom (Section 5)
5. Samaya commitments protect both the practitioner and the lineage's integrity (Section 14)

**Scripture Integration:**
This chapter draws heavily from:
- **Self-Arisen** (Rangshar): Guru qualifications and student characteristics
- **Thalgyur:** Ground, path, and fruition framework
- **Hevajra Tantra:** Prajñā-Jñāna empowerment details
- **Secret Essence (Guhyagarbha):** Defects of not receiving empowerment
- **Great Empowerment Arrangement:** Consort classifications

## CONNECTION TO CHAPTER 7

Chapter 6 establishes **empowerment** (dbang) as the basis; Chapter 7 will present **samaya** (dam tshig) as the path. These two chapters form a pair: empowerment opens the door, samaya maintains the connection. Together they constitute the essential foundation without which the advanced practices of channels, winds, and direct recognition (presented in Chapters 8-25) cannot bear fruit.

The practitioner who has received empowerment but neglects samaya is like a vase that has been consecrated but then broken—potential realized but immediately lost. Chapter 6 is thus not merely introductory; it is the **indispensable precondition** for everything that follows.
