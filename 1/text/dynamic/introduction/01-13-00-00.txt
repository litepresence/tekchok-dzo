## CHAPTER 13: The Four Lamps—Gateway to the Four Visions

**Tibetan:** རིམ་ཁང་བཅུ་གསུམ་པ། (Thirteenth Lecture Hall)  
**Location:** Volume 1, Sections 01-13-01-01 through 01-13-06-01  
**Tibetan Lines:** 16025-17127  
**Total Liturgical Lines:** ~1,456

This chapter presents the **crown jewel** of the Treasury's practical instructions—the complete system of the **Four Lamps** (*sgron ma bzhi*) that serve as the gateway to the **Four Visions** (*snang ba bzhi*) of thögal (*thod rgal*) practice. While Chapter 12 established the anatomical foundations (channels, winds, and bindus), Chapter 13 provides the **operational manual** for how these subtle body elements become the basis for direct perception of reality.

The chapter operates at the highest level of Dzogchen practice, assuming the practitioner has:
- Recognized the nature of mind (rigpa)
- Stabilized that recognition through trekchö (*khregs chod*)
- Is ready to engage the dynamic practices of thögal

## SECTION BREAKDOWN

### **Section 1: 01-13-01-01.txt (281 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Lamp of the Empty Bindu and Far-Reaching Lasso

This opening section establishes the foundational lamp through which all others become accessible:

**The Far-Reaching Water Lamp (rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma):**
- Located at the heart center
- Associated with the water element and dharmakāya
- Projects rays that perceive distant objects beyond ordinary vision
- Clears the darkness of karma and habitual tendencies
- The basis for all clairvoyant perception

**The Key Distinction:**
- **Outer sky**: The physical sky (not the actual lamp)
- **Inner sky**: The blue light-tone that arises from the bindu
- **Actual space**: The dark-blue luminosity of mind's essence

**The Bindu's Triple Nature:**
1. **Posture bindu**: Located at the lower gate, held by secret HUM
2. **Empty bindu**: The reverse bindu mixed with wind and potential
3. **Wisdom bindu**: The ultimate bindu of unchanging awareness essence

**The Three Appearances:**
From the bindu arise:
- **Sound**: The tone like a golden cord
- **Light**: Five-colored radiance
- **Rays**: The vajra-chain projection

### **Section 2: 01-13-02-01.txt (225 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Lamp of Far-Reaching Lasso and Definition

This section explains the second lamp and establishes definitions:

**The Far-Reaching Lasso Lamp (rgyang zhags ching gi sgron ma):**
- The "casting-far" mechanism that binds and liberates
- Like a rope: Single strands bind nothing; collected, they bind
- The power to see both pure appearances and deluded appearances
- The view that encompasses both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa

**The Defining Characteristics:**
- Light-luminous clarity's form-reflection
- Deluded-appearance held at a distance
- Self-appearance bound when not realized
- Liberation when recognized as magical illusion

**The Key Realization:**
> "Like a magical illusion—by anyone, not bound, binding does not exist."

### **Section 3: 01-13-03-01.txt (310 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Empty Bindu Lamp and Essence

This extensive section presents the third lamp—the heart of the practice:

**The Empty Bindu Lamp (thig le stong pa'i sgron ma):**
- The round bindu surrounded by five lights' rim
- The essence: singular, subtle, free from elaboration
- The nature: self-abiding equality
- Empty of extremes, self-luminous, great
- Not imparted, ground complete by self-power

**The Threefold Division:**
1. **Ground**: Abiding as completely pure expanse—pristine awareness and light body
2. **Path**: Appearing as completely pure expanse—bindu essence gathered
3. **Fruition**: Appearing as object—bound and grasped through the web of five lights

**The Four Natures:**
- Self-face primordially pure expanse
- Spontaneous presence's primordial resonance
- Intention of ka-pure and spontaneous-accomplish
- Unceasing appearance, memory ceased

**Five Characteristics:**
1. Empty clear open outer light space
2. Self-awareness space primordially abiding in ka-pure
3. Unobscured, nonexistent stain
4. Primordial characteristics
5. Nonexistent object, nonexistent appearance-ceasing

**Six Habituation Manners:**
- Cutting distinction of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa
- Manifest face-introduced, abiding ten awareness
- Day-night nonexistent experience

**The Self-Arisen Wisdom Lamp (ye shes rang byung gi sgron ma):**
- The blue spreading five-possess
- Light five rim-round inner petal
- Awareness snake-noose ray-shooting fence
- Unfabricated essence

**The Pearl Garland Verses:**
<tantra> "Like the rainbow of the sky
Pure, afflictions and stains exhausted
The sphere is vast, the expanse uncut
Through completely pure reality"

**The Four Natures of This Lamp:**
1. **Ground**: Dharmakāya of pure nature
2. **Path**: Through bindu essence gathering
3. **Fruition**: Through chain-circle bound grasping
4. **Nature**: Beyond ka-pure and spontaneous-accomplish

**The Chain-Circle (dril bu):**

**Topic:** The Three Divisions and Definitive Meaning

This final section presents the culmination of the Four Lamps teaching:

**The Threefold Lamp System:**

2. **Wisdom self-arisen lamp**: The discriminating wisdom itself
3. **Discriminating-nonexistent mode**: Abiding without discrimination

**The Definitive Meaning:**
- Outer-appearance self-appearance completely obvious
- All dharmas universal empty and selfless
- Self primordial-wisdom measures known

**The Pearl Garland Verses:**
<tantra> "Like fire-lamp example
Knowledge simultaneously realizes all dharmas
Excellent, becomes summit of all
Self is free, other-depend Dharma
Arise as open unblocked"

**The Five Aspects:**
1. Basis-abide: Self-arisen wisdom
2. Within-abide: Awareness knowledge-aspect
3. Appearance raw-hold: Wisdom
4. Dimension-awareness: Two-nonexistent pair-join
5. Nature: Pure dharmakāya

**Habituation Methods:**
- Self-face primordially pure expanse
- Rigpa inserted naked-straight
- Great self-ease meditation

## THE FOUR LAMPS AND THE FOUR VISIONS

**The Relationship:**
The Four Lamps serve as the **support** (rten) for the Four Visions (*snang ba bzhi*):

| Lamp | Vision | Experience |
|------|--------|------------|
| Water Lamp | Direct perception of dharmata | Initial clear appearance |
| Lasso Lamp | Increase of experiences | Expansion of light displays |
| Empty Bindu | Perfection of awareness | Bindu dissolution into light |
| Self-arisen Wisdom | Exhaustion of phenomena | Complete liberation |

**Progression:**
1. **Lamps stabilized** → Initial visions arise
2. **Lamps intensified** → Visions expand and increase
3. **Lamps dissolved** → Bindus melt into light
4. **Lamps transcended** → Fruition complete

## READING GUIDANCE

### **For Practitioners**

This chapter is **advanced Dzogchen instruction**:

**Prerequisites:**
- Stable recognition of rigpa (trekchö)
- Complete ngöndro (preliminary practices)
- Empowerment from a qualified teacher
- Understanding of subtle body anatomy (Chapter 12)

**How to Study:**
1. First understand the **theory**—the three bindus, the three appearances
2. Then receive **oral instruction** from a qualified teacher
3. Practice the **postures and gazes** systematically
4. Recognize the **signs** as they arise
5. Do not **grasp** at experiences

**Warning Signs:**
- Physical disturbances: Wind disorders, channel blockages
- Mental disturbances: Agitation, confusion, attachment to experiences
- Spiritual disturbances: Ego-inflation, claiming attainments

**When to Practice:**
- After completing preliminary practices
- When trekchö is stable
- Under guidance of a teacher who knows these practices
- In retreat, not during daily activities

### **For Scholars**

Note the sophisticated structure:
- **Integration**: Synthesis of tantric physiology and Dzogchen view
- **Progression**: From gross (posture) to subtle (bindu) to ultimate (wisdom)
- **Symbolism**: Rich metaphorical language encoding precise instructions
- **Protection**: Teachings protected by symbolic language from unqualified practitioners

**Critical Points:**
1. **Not physical**: The lamps are not anatomical structures but modes of experience
2. **Not metaphors**: They refer to actual psychophysical processes
3. **Not separate**: All four lamps function interdependently
4. **Not ultimate**: Even the lamps must be transcended in complete realization

### **Comparative Context**

**Similarities with Other Traditions:**
- **Kundalinī yoga**: Channels, winds, drops
- **Taoist inner alchemy**: Three dantians, subtle body
- **Indian haṭha yoga**: Nāḍīs, prāṇa, bindu

**Dzogchen Distinctiveness:**
- **No transformation**: Not changing impure to pure, but recognizing primordial purity
- **Self-liberation**: Experiences liberate themselves without manipulation
- **Direct perception**: Seeing reality directly, not conceptually
- **Beyond effort**: Once recognition occurs, effort becomes obstacle

---

## CONNECTION TO CHAPTER 14

Chapter 13 established the **Four Lamps** as the basis; Chapter 14 will present the **Four Visions** that arise through them. The progression:

- **Chapter 13**: The physical and energetic basis (lamps)
- **Chapter 14**: The experiential results (visions)

This mirrors the general principle:
- **Basis**: Channels, winds, bindus (spontaneous presence)
- **Path**: Recognition and stabilization (lamps illuminated)
- **Fruition**: The four visions progressively unfolding

**Key Insight**: The lamps are not the goal—they are the **catalyst** that reveals what was always already present. The visions don't create enlightenment; they reveal its ever-present nature.
