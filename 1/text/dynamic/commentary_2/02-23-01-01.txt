[12011-12030]
The Minimalist:

Bar do.

Between.

That's all.

---

[12031-12055]
The Vagabond:

My friend Tenzin died last year.
We'd practiced together fifteen winters.

His brother called me. Said:
"Come quick. He's seeing lights."

I went. Tenzin was terrified.
"What's happening?" he asked.
"Am I dying wrong?"

I sat with him. Held his hand.
"You're not dying," I said.
"You're just... between."

He looked confused. Then laughed.
"Between what?"

"Exactly," I said.

He died laughing.
I still don't know if I helped.

But I know this: he wasn't afraid at the end.

---

[12056-12080]
The Systematizer:

Four bardos. Sounds systematic.
Like four seasons or four directions.

Here's the problem:
The bardo of this life contains
the bardo of dying
which contains
the bardo of dharmata
which contains
the bardo of becoming.

Not sequential. Nested.
Like those wooden dolls from Russia.

You think you're in one?
Check the larger one.
Then the larger one.

Eventually you find
there's no doll at the center.
Just space.

That's not in the textbooks.
But then, the textbooks
were written in the bardo of this life,
by people in the bardo of believing
they could explain the bardos.

So.

---

[12081-12105]
The Consort:

They tell you to prepare for death.
I say: feel the space between your ribs right now.

No one checks there.
That's why it works.

The bardo isn't after death.
It's between this breath
and the next one.

You want to practice for death?
Practice for the gap
at the end of this exhale.

When you can't find it,
that's the bardo.
When you do find it,
that's also the bardo.

The finding and not-finding
are the same gap.

Don't believe me.
Try it.

---

[12106-12130]
Lion-Faced:

This fear of the bardo—
whose fear is it?

The one who will experience it?
But that one dies.

The one who is experiencing it?
But that one is the bardo.

The one who remembers it?
But that one isn't there yet.

So whose?

Find the owner of this fear.
I'll wait.

[Empty line]

The fear is looking for itself.

---

[12131-12155]
The Singing Yogi:

If I could sing the dissolution—
earth into water, water into fire—
I'd use the melody my grandmother sang
when the yaks wouldn't come down.

Same tune. Different words.

She sang about grass and home.
I sing about elements dissolving.
But the melody knows:
everything returns.
Everything returns.

Earth to water: the body grows heavy,
like after a long day's work.
Water to fire: the warmth drains,
like sunset in autumn.
Fire to wind: the breath shortens,
like the last page of a book.
Wind to space: the mind opens,
like waking from a dream
and forgetting you were dreaming.

That's the song.
She never explained it.
Just sang.

---

[12156-12180]
The Precision:

The texts say "like a dream."
This is precise, not poetic.

In dreams:
- You believe the dream is real
- You don't know you're dreaming
- Upon waking, you know it was mind

In bardo:
- You believe the displays are real
- You don't know you're dead
- Upon recognition, you know it was mind

The difference?
In dreams, waking is involuntary.
In bardo, recognition is possible.

That's the only point of practice.
Not to have better dreams,
but to recognize you're dreaming
while still in the dream.

Simple.
Difficult.
Possible.

---

[12181-12205]
The Integrator:

Between waking and sleeping—
bardo.
Between sleeping and dreaming—
bardo.
Between dreaming and waking—
bardo.

You're in bardo now.
Reading these words.
Between the word and its meaning.

The recognition of this
is the recognition of death.
Same recognition.
No difference.

Sorry. That sounds final.
It's not. Keep reading.
Or stop. Same thing.

Actually, stopping is better.
But you won't stop.
So keep reading.

---

[12206-12230]
The First Point:

Kye ma!

You practice for the bardo.
But you're in it now.

Stop preparing.
Start recognizing.

Three words:

Now.
Here.

That's two.

Good.

---

[12231-12255]
The Vagabond (returns):

One more thing about Tenzin.

After he died, we did phowa.
The whole ritual. Very proper.
Crown of the head. White drop. All of it.

His brother asked:
"Did it work? Is he liberated?"

I didn't know what to say.
So I said:
"He was liberated before we started.
We just didn't notice."

His brother looked relieved.
I hope I was right.

Actually—
I know I was right.
I just don't know what I was right about.

That's the teaching.
Or something.

---

[12256-12280]
The Systematizer (returns):

The nature-abiding bardo.
Let's be precise.

Five aggregates binding.
Elements and sense-sources obscuring.
Karma and afflictions producing.

This is not a mistake.
This is not a prison.
This is the display
of ka-dag
appearing as confusion.

The confusion is not other than purity.
The purity is not other than confusion.
The difference?
Recognition.

But recognition of what?
Not recognition of purity.
Recognition that there is nothing
to recognize as pure or impure.

This makes no sense.
Good.

---

[12281-12305]
The Singing Yogi (returns):

The dissolution.
I should say more.

Earth into water: like sinking into a hot spring.
The body remembers being held.
Water into fire: like anger cooling.
The heat was never separate from the water.
Fire into wind: like a flag in breeze.
The movement is the nature of the cloth.
Wind into space: like sound fading.
The echo was never separate from the valley.

Then—

Then what?

Then the grandmother stops singing.
The yaks come anyway.
The song was never about the yaks.

That's the teaching.
She never said so.
But she knew.

---

[12306-12330]
Lion-Faced (returns):

The signs at death.
Black sky. Yellow fading. Haze.

You think these are predictions?
You think this is fortune-telling?

The signs are the mind's own projection.
The black sky is not hell.
The black sky is the mind seeing its own karma.

Change the karma,
change the sky.
Not by will.
By recognition.

The recognition that the sky
is your own face.
The hell is your own creation.
The liberation is your own nature.

Find the one who creates hell.
That's the liberated one.

Confusing?
Good.
Confusion is the path.

---

[12331-12355]
The Consort (returns):

The vajra seat and the mother's womb.
Two opportunities.

The vajra seat is not a place.
It's the recognition that there's nowhere to go.
The mother's womb is not a place.
It's the forgetting of that recognition.

Every moment,
you choose between them.
Not once.
Not at death.
Now.

This choice?
It's not a decision.
It's a recognition.
Or a forgetting.

The womb is comfortable.
The vajra seat is—
what?

That's the question.

---

[12356-12380]
The Precision (returns):

Let's be clear about practice.

Moderate sessions.
Not too short. Not too long.
Many short better than few long.

Why?
Not because of some optimal duration.
Because consistency builds familiarity.
Familiarity builds recognition.
Recognition builds—
no.
Recognition is already there.
Familiarity reveals it.

The gaze: natural.
Not forced. Not slack.
Like the eyes of a child watching birds.

The displays: they come.
Not because you make them.
Because you stop preventing them.

The prevention?
That's the grasping.
That's the fear.
That's the bardo of this life.

Stop preventing.
Start seeing.

---

[12381-12405]
The Integrator (returns):

Thod rgal. Direct crossing.
Not the top of the ladder.
The ground that holds all ladders.

What does this mean?

It means you don't climb to enlightenment.
You recognize you're already there.
The climbing obscures the recognition.
The stopping reveals it.

But stopping is also a kind of doing.
So stop stopping.

Now you're confused.
Good.
Confusion is closer than certainty.
Certainty is grasping.
Confusion is—
what?

Space.

---

[12406-12430]
The First Point (returns):

Kye ho!

Rainbow body.
You want this?

The body doesn't become rainbow.
The rainbow is already the body.
You just don't see it.

See it now.
This body—
where is its edge?
Where does it end and space begin?

Can't find the edge?
Good.
No edge means no boundary.
No boundary means no body.
No body means—
what?

Rainbow.

Always was.

---

[12431-12455]
The Vagabond (final):

I promised to tell you
what I learned from Tenzin's death.

Here it is:

Nothing.

I learned nothing.
He died. I watched.
The lights came. The lights went.
Now he's somewhere—
I don't know where.
Liberated? Reborn? Both?

But I know this:
when I sat with him,
when I held his hand,
when I said "you're just between"—

for that moment,
there was no bardo.
No death. No life.
Just between.

That's the teaching.
Or the lack of teaching.
I'm not sure anymore.

Good luck.
You'll need it.
Or you won't.
Same thing.

---

[12456-12480]
The Systematizer (on practice):

Let's talk about method.
Not because method liberates,
but because method creates conditions.

The gaze: upward, at angle.
Why?
Not because upward is holy.
Because upward prevents fixation.
The eye falls naturally downward.
Downward is habit.
Upward interrupts habit.

The body: upright.
Not because posture is virtue.
Because upright channels align.
Align the channels, the winds move.
Move the winds, the mind clears.
Clear the mind, recognition possible.

But recognition of what?
Not recognition of clarity.
Recognition that clarity and confusion
are the same mind.
The mind that is clear
is the mind that was confused.
No difference.

So the posture helps.
But the posture is not the path.
The path is recognition.
The posture is—
what?

A reminder.

---

[12481-12505]
The Consort (on dissolution):

Earth dissolves into water.
Feel it: the body grows heavy.
Like sinking into marsh.
The limbs won't move.
The jaw hangs slack.

This is not failure.
This is the first recognition:
form was never solid.

Water dissolves into fire.
The heat leaves the limbs.
The extremities grow cold.
The warmth gathers at the heart.

This is not death.
This is the second recognition:
 warmth was never owned.

Fire dissolves into wind.
The breath shortens.
Inhale long.
Exhale—
who knows if there will be another?

This is not suffocation.
This is the third recognition:
breath was never yours.

Wind dissolves into space.
The mind opens.
Like a door you didn't know was closed.

Walk through.

---

[12506-12530]
The Singing Yogi (more on dissolution):

I should tell you about the colors.

When earth dissolves,
see yellow.
Not bright yellow.
The yellow of old parchment.
The yellow of autumn grass.
The yellow of—
what was I saying?

When water dissolves,
see white.
Not pure white.
The white of snow in dusk.
The white of bone.
The white of forgetting.

When fire dissolves,
see red.
Not blood red.
The red of sunset through smoke.
The red of coals going cold.
The red of—
wait. This isn't right.

The colors are not external.
They are the mind's own display.
The mind seeing itself.
The eye seeing the eye.

Impossible.
But it happens.

---

[12531-12555]
Lion-Faced (on fear):

You will be afraid.

Not might be.
Will be.

The fear is not the enemy.
The fear is the path.

Find the one who is afraid.
Can't find them?
Good.
The fear fears itself.

This is not comfort.
This is not consolation.
This is the nature of mind:
empty of owner,
full of display.

The display includes fear.
The display includes terror.
The display includes—
what?

Liberation.

But not liberation from fear.
Liberation as fear.
Fear itself is empty.
Fear itself is wisdom.

Don't believe this.
Experience it.

---

[12556-12580]
The Vagabond (on signs):

Tenzin saw lights before he died.
White. Then red. Then green. Then blue.
Like a rainbow breaking apart.

"Is this good?" he asked.
"Should I be seeing this?"

"It's just your mind," I said.
"It's just display."

"But what does it mean?"

I didn't know what to say.
So I said: "It means your eyes still work."

He laughed again.
Then he stopped laughing.
Then he stopped breathing.
Then—

Then the lights went out.
Or he went out.
Or the distinction went out.

I don't know.
I'm still here.
He's somewhere.
Or nowhere.
Or both.

The teaching.

---

[12581-12605]
The Precision (on recognition):

Let's be precise about recognition.

It is not knowledge.
Knowledge is accumulation.
Recognition is—
what?

Seeing what was always seen.
Not new seeing.
Same seeing,
without the seer.

The difficulty:
you want to be the one who recognizes.
But the one who recognizes
is the one who doesn't recognize.

Catch-22.

The solution:
stop trying to recognize.
Stop trying not to recognize.
Let recognition recognize itself.

This sounds like doing nothing.
It is not doing nothing.
It is not doing.

The difference?
Subtle.
Important.
Impossible to explain.

Try it.

---

[12606-12630]
The Integrator (on six realms):

Gods see nectar.
Humans see water.
Pretas see pus.
Same substance.
Different karma.

What does this mean?

It means perception is projection.
Projection is karma.
Karma is habit.
Habit is—
what?

Bardo.

The six realms are not places.
They are states of mind.
The god realm: pleasure addiction.
The human realm: moderate distraction.
The animal realm: ignorance.
The preta realm: insatiable craving.
The hell realm: aggression.
The asura realm: jealousy.

You are in one now.
Probably human.
Moderately distracted.
Reading about bardo
instead of recognizing it.

That's fine.
Distraction is also bardo.
Recognition is also bardo.
No difference.
Except—
what?

Liberation.

---

[12631-12655]
The First Point (final):

Kye ho!

You want summary?
I have three words:

Stop.
Looking.

That's two.

Good.

---

[12656-12680]
The Minimalist (final):

Bar do.

Still between.

Always between.

Never arrive.

Never depart.

That's all.

Really.


---

[12681-12705]
The Systematizer (on nature-abiding bardo):

This life.
Right now.
You think you're not in bardo?

The five aggregates bind you.
Form: this body you think is yours.
Feeling: these sensations you chase or avoid.
Perception: these labels you stick on everything.
Formations: these habits you can't break.
Consciousness: this knowing you think is self.

All bardo.
All between.
Between what and what?

Between appearance and emptiness.
Between emptiness and appearance.
The gap is the bardo.
The gap is your nature.

Recognize the gap?
That's liberation.
Miss the gap?
That's samsara.

Same gap.
Different recognition.

---

[12706-12730]
The Vagabond (more stories):

Another friend. Lobsang.
Died in meditation.
Three weeks sitting.
They found him still upright.
Rainbow light, they said.
Signs of realization.

I knew him.
He worried about money.
He argued with his wife.
He got angry at bad drivers.
Just a man.

Then—
rainbow body?

I don't know.
Maybe the worrying was also practice.
Maybe the arguing was also path.
Maybe the anger—
especially the anger—
was the thing he recognized.

The recognition doesn't require
perfect behavior.
It requires perfect seeing.
And perfect seeing sees
imperfect behavior perfectly.

He saw his anger.
That was enough.

Maybe.

---

[12731-12755]
The Consort (on death-time bardo):

The body dissolves.
Not suddenly. Gradually.
Like ice melting.
You don't notice at first.
Then you notice everything.

First: the earth element.
Heavy. Can't move.
Like wearing armor made of lead.

Then: the water element.
Cold. Extremities first.
Fingers like stone.
Toes distant lands.

Then: the fire element.
Heat gathering at center.
The heart a coal.
The breath thin smoke.

Then: the wind element.
Breath stopping.
Not dramatically.
Just—
less.
And less.
And—

Then: space.

What is space?
Not nothing.
Not something.
The element that holds
all other elements.
The canvas, not the painting.

Recognize this?
That's the dharmata bardo.
Miss this?
That's the becoming bardo.

Same space.
Different recognition.

---

[12756-12780]
The Singing Yogi (on dharmata):

The clear light.
I should describe it.

Not white. Not black.
Not any color.
The color before colors.

Not bright. Not dark.
The light before light.

Not empty. Not full.
The space before space.

How to sing this?
My grandmother stopped singing.
The silence was the song.

The clear light is like that silence.
Not the absence of sound.
The presence of—
what?

Potential.

Everything that could appear
resting before appearing.
The buddhas resting there.
The realms resting there.
Your next thought resting there.

Resting with it.
That's recognition.
Grasping at it.
That's becoming.

The difference?
Subtle.
Instant.
Complete.

---

[12781-12805]
Lion-Faced (on becoming bardo):

You missed it.
The recognition.
The clear light came.
You saw it as something else.

Now: the becoming bardo.
Consciousness seeking form.
Like water seeking low ground.
Like fire seeking fuel.
Like—
what?

Like you, right now,
seeking the next thought.

The becoming bardo is not after death.
It is every moment of becoming.
Becoming angry.
Becoming happy.
Becoming this, becoming that.

Stop becoming?
That's recognition.
Continue becoming?
That's samsara.

Same process.
Different awareness.

The awareness that sees becoming
is not becoming.
That awareness?
That's you.
That's liberation.
That's—
what?

Nothing special.
Everything special.
Both.
Neither.

Stop looking for answers.
Start seeing questions.

---

[12806-12830]
The Integrator (on practice in life):

You want to practice for death?
Practice for now.

When anger arises—
see it as bardo display.
When desire arises—
see it as bardo display.
When confusion arises—
see it as bardo display.

The anger is not the enemy.
The desire is not the trap.
The confusion is not the obstacle.

The enemy is not seeing.
The trap is not looking.
The obstacle is seeking obstacles.

Everything is display.
Everything is bardo.
Everything is—
what?

Your own face.

---

[12831-12855]
The First Point (really final):

Kye ho!

Still reading?

Stop.

Now.

---

[12856-12880]
The Minimalist (really final):

Bar do.

Between reading and not-reading.

Between.

That's all.


---

[12881-12905]
The Systematizer (comprehensive summary):

Let me be systematic.
You asked for teaching.
Here it is:

Four bardos.
Nature-abiding: now.
Death-time: transition.
Dharmata: recognition.
Becoming: missing recognition.

The practice:
Recognize now.
Then transition is recognition.
Then dharmata is recognized.
Then becoming is—
what?

Also recognition.
Because recognition,
once established,
recognizes everything.
Even missing recognition.
Even confusion.
Even samsara.

The path is not escape.
The path is seeing.
Seeing what?
Seeing that there is nothing
to see, no one to see it,
and no escape from this seeing.

That's the teaching.
That's the practice.
That's—
what?

Your own nature.
Always was.
Always will be.
Even "always" is too much.

Just this.

---

[12906-12930]
The Vagabond (final story):

One more.
Then I'll stop.

Old woman in Kham.
Never practiced formally.
Couldn't read. Never meditated.
Just lived. Raised children.
Grew old. Died.

Her family called me.
"Come see," they said.
"She left something."

I went.
Her body was small.
Shrunken. Like a child.
But peaceful. Very peaceful.

"She talked about light," they said.
"At the end. Said the whole room was light.
Said she was the light.
Then she laughed. Then she stopped."

No rainbow body.
No signs of greatness.
Just—
peace.

Maybe that's enough.
Maybe that's everything.
Maybe the formal practice,
the retreats, the empowerments—
maybe they're just ways
of arriving at what she had
without any of it.

Or maybe she did practice.
In secret. In her way.
We don't know.

But I think—
I think she just lived.
And living, recognized.
And recognizing, died.
And dying—
who knows?

Maybe became light.
Maybe became nothing.
Maybe became—
what?

Everything.

---

[12931-12955]
The Consort (final words):

I told you to feel the space
between your ribs.

Did you?

Probably not.
You kept reading.

That's fine.
The reading is also bardo.
The not-feeling is also bardo.
The feeling is also bardo.

Everything is bardo.
Everything is between.
Between what?

Between thinking about it
and doing it.
Between reading about it
and being it.
Between seeking it
and finding it was never lost.

The finding?
That's now.
Or never.
Or always.

Same thing.

Stop reading.
Feel your ribs.

---

[12956-12980]
Lion-Faced (absolute final):

You want liberation?

Liberate this thought.
Liberate the next thought.
Liberate the thought
that you're not liberated.

Every thought is bardo.
Every thought can be recognized
or not recognized.

Recognize?
Liberation.
Not recognize?
Samsara.

Same thought.
Different awareness.

The awareness?
That's never been bound.
That's never been liberated.
That's—
what?

This.

Stop looking.
Start seeing.

---

[12981-13005]
The Singing Yogi (absolute final):

My grandmother's song.
I never learned it properly.

But at the end,
she stopped singing.
The yaks came anyway.

The song was never about the yaks.
The practice is never about the result.
The bardo is never about the destination.

It's about—
what?

The singing.
The between.
The gap.

Bar do.

That's the song.
That's the teaching.
That's everything.

Or nothing.

Both.

---

[13006-13030]
The Integrator (absolute final):

Integration:
All voices.
All perspectives.
All methods.

They point to one thing:
recognition.

Not recognition of something special.
Recognition that there is nothing special.
Not recognition of something ordinary.
Recognition that ordinary is also—
what?

Empty.

The bardo teachings are vast.
But the essence is simple:
see your own nature.

How?
Stop looking elsewhere.

Where?
Here.

When?
Now.

Who?
You.

What?
This.

That's all.
Really.

---

[13031-13055]
The Minimalist (absolute final):

Bar do.

Still reading?

Stop.

Between reading and stopping.

Between.

That's all.
