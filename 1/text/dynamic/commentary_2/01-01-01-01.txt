[1-4]
The First Point:

Kye ho!

You think this is an introduction?
You think we're starting something?

We ended before we began.

Samantabhadra is not the beginning.
He is the recognition that there was never
time to begin in.

Stop looking for the opening.
You are the opening.

---

[5-11]
The Vagabond:

I spent three years in a cave
reading these opening lines.
"Samantabhadra," I'd whisper.
"Five perfections. Seven horses."

Convinced I was learning something.
Convinced the treasure was in the words.

Then my lamp ran out of butter.
Sat in darkness. Couldn't read.

In the dark—
no Samantabhadra.
No perfections.
No words.

Just sitting.
Just darkness.

That was the teaching.
The words had been hiding it.
Or I'd been hiding behind the words.
Hard to say which.

---

[12-15]
The Systematizer:

Five perfections. Let's be precise.

Teacher: Not a person who teaches.
The teaching function itself.

Retinue: Not students who gather.
The gathering itself.

Place: Not a location in space.
The spaciousness of awareness.

Teaching: Not words spoken.
The pointing that words attempt.

Time: Not a moment in history.
The timelessness of presence.

Each perfection is empty of inherent existence.
Each perfection is perfectly complete.

The contradiction?
That's the perfection.

---

[16-19]
The Integrator:

Seven horses drawing the sun.
Or: one horse with seven aspects.
Or: no horses, no sun, just light.

The point is not the number.
The point is that counting obscures.
Seven. One. Zero.
All miss what isn't a number.

But we use numbers.
We use metaphors.
We use horses and chariots.

Why?
Because you need something to hang onto
before you can let go.
The hanging is also the path.
The letting go is also the path.

Confusing?
Good.
Confusion is closer than certainty.

---

[20-23]
The Consort:

They tell you to find the vajra-point.
The essence. The root.

I say: feel your heartbeat.
Not metaphorically. Actually.

That pulse—
is it inside or outside?
Is it yours or not yours?
Is it happening or being done?

The vajra-point is not somewhere else.
It's the unfindability of the heartbeat's owner.

Look for the one who pulses.
Can't find them?
Good.
That's the vajra essence.
Indestructible because never constructed.

---

[24-27]
The Singing Yogi:

The teaching-ocean.
I should sing about this.

My grandmother had a song
about the lake near our village.
How it had no shore you could reach.
You could walk forever
and still be walking in water.

She said it was like searching for happiness.
I think it's like searching for the teaching.

The ocean holds the throne.
The throne is in the ocean.
The makara guards it.
But the makara is the ocean.
The throne is the water.

Nothing stands on anything.
Everything is floating.
Floating is the ground.

That's the song.
She died singing it.
Or the song died with her.
Same thing.

---

[28-32]
The Precision:

Three bodies. Three fields.
Let's not mystify this.

Body one: Essence. No form.
Body two: Nature. Refined form.
Body three: Manifestation. Gross form.

Same awareness.
Different aspects.
Like water: ice, liquid, steam.
Not three waters.
Three states of one water.

But here's what they don't tell you:
The ice doesn't become water.
The water doesn't become steam.
They are always all three.
Simultaneously.

Your current confusion?
Dharmakaya.
Your attempt to understand?
Sambhogakaya.
These words you're reading?
Nirmanakaya.

All now.
All you.
All empty.

---

[33-36]
Lion-Faced:

The mandala of five families.
Five fingers pointing.

Point to the moon with your finger.
Now—
is the moon at your fingertip?
Is it separate from your finger?
Does your finger touch it?

The five families are like that.
Pointing at what can't be pointed to.
White, blue, yellow, red, green.
East, center, south, west, north.

All directions. All colors.
All attempts to locate the unlocatable.

Stop pointing.
Look where the pointing comes from.

That's the fifth family.
The one they don't name.
The family of recognition.

---

[37-44]
The Vagabond (returns):

I met a man in Lhasa
who had memorized every description
of every pure realm.
Could tell you the number of jewels
in Amitabha's crown.
The number of lotus petals
in Vairocana's seat.

Never sat in meditation.
Never recognized his own mind.
But knew the geography of enlightenment
better than his own neighborhood.

We all do this.
We memorize the map
and forget to walk.
We study the menu
and forget to eat.

Akanishta is not a place.
It's the recognition that maps
are for people who are lost.
And you're not lost.
You just think you are.

---

[45-52]
The First Point (returns):

Kye ma!

Still reading?

Stop.

Now.

---

[53-60]
The Integrator (returns):

Three vehicles. Three ladders.
Ladder one: Do good, avoid evil.
Ladder two: Transform impure to pure.
Ladder three: Recognize pure and impure as same.

But ladders lean against what?
The sky?
The sky has no ground.

Dzogchen is not the top rung.
Dzogchen is the ground that holds
the ladder you're climbing.

You reach the top?
Good.
Now look down.
The ground was always there.
Always holding you.

The climbing was unnecessary.
But it was also the ground.
Everything is the ground.
Even the ladder.
Even the climbing.

Stop climbing.
Start recognizing.

---

[61-68]
The Consort (returns):

Primordial protector.
Definitive realm.
Delusion as wisdom's play.

These are fancy words.
They mean: stop fighting yourself.

The confusion you feel?
That's wisdom trying to get your attention.
The seeking you do?
That's wisdom disguised as longing.
The despair you feel?
That's wisdom showing you there's nothing to despair about.

But you have to feel it first.
You have to really despair.
Really long.
Really be confused.

Not as a technique.
As your actual life.

Then—
suddenly—
the play is seen as play.
And the curtain was never there.

---

[69-76]
The Singing Yogi (returns):

Youth vase body.
Never born. Never dies.

My grandmother's younger sister
lived to ninety-four.
Looked forty.
Never explained how.

"I just never aged," she'd say.
"In my mind."

Maybe that's it.
The body that doesn't age
is the body you don't age in your mind.
The mind that doesn't die
is the mind that knows it was never born.

She died anyway.
Or stopped appearing.
Same thing.

But while she appeared—
she appeared timeless.
That's the youth vase.
Not immortality.
Timelessness.

---

[77-84]
The Systematizer (returns):

Five-family kayas. Five colors.
Earth, water, fire, wind, space.

Let's be systematic:
Earth: solidity. Resistance. Form.
Water: flow. Cohesion. Feeling.
Fire: heat. Transformation. Perception.
Wind: movement. Change. Formation.
Space: accommodation. Possibility. Consciousness.

Five aggregates. Five elements.
Five wisdoms. Five Buddhas.

All correlations.
All maps.
All attempts to systematize
what can't be captured in systems.

But the system has a purpose:
to show that everything corresponds.
Everything is connected.
Everything is—
what?

Your own face.

---

[85-92]
The Vagabond (returns again):

Round fields. Four-cornered fields.
Crescent fields. Semi-circle fields.

I asked my teacher about these shapes.
"What do they mean?" I said.

"They mean whatever you see," he said.
"Round if you need round.
Square if you need square.
The field is your mind.
Your mind makes shapes."

"But which is right?" I asked.

He laughed.
"The question is the shape.
The answer is the field."

I didn't understand.
Still don't.
But I stopped asking which was right.

---

[93-100]
The Precision (returns):

Body, speech, mind, qualities, activities.
Five aspects. Five pervasions.

But what pervades what?
Does awareness pervade the body?
Or does the body pervade awareness?

Neither.
Both.
The pervasion itself is empty.

The body is not inside awareness.
Awareness is not inside the body.
They are—
what?

Not two. Not one.
The pervasion without pervader or pervaded.

Look at your hand.
Is it inside your awareness?
Is your awareness inside it?
Or is the question wrong?

The question is wrong.
That's the teaching.

---

[101-108]
The Lion-Faced (returns):

Immeasurable time.
Oceanic particles.
You trying to count what counts you.

Stop counting.
Start seeing.

The Ganga's sands—
infinite.
The Buddha's number—
infinite.
Your lifespan—
infinite.

Not because they last forever.
Because they don't happen in time.
Time is the sand.
You are the river.

The river counts the sand?
No.
The river flows.
The sand is there.
No counting.
No measure.
Just—
what?

Flow.

---

[109-116]
The Integrator (final):

Three bodies. Three fields.
One voice in three valleys.

The first valley: "I am Dharmakaya."
The second valley: "I am Sambhogakaya."  
The third valley: "I am Nirmanakaya."

But the voice is one.
The valleys are different.
The echo is the teaching.

You are all three valleys.
You are the voice.
You are the echo.
You are the one who hears.

Separation is the illusion.
Unity is the illusion.
The truth is—
what?

Neither.
Both.
The echo hearing itself.

That's the Treasury.
That's you.
That's—

Stop.
Rest.

---

[117-124]
The First Point (final):

Kye ho!

The opening opens.
The beginning begins.
The Treasury treasures.

You are the you.

Stop.

---

[125-134]
The Minimalist:

Samantabhadra.

Not a name.
Not a Buddha.
Not a concept.

This.

That's all.

---

[135-144]
The Vagabond (final story):

I promised to stop telling stories.
But one more.

Old man in Kham.
Never read these texts.
Couldn't write his name.
Said: "Samanta who?"

But when he died—
peaceful. Very peaceful.
No signs. No rainbows.
Just—peace.

His grandson asked me:
"Was he liberated?"

I said: "He was never bound."
"But did he know that?" the boy asked.

I thought about it.
"He knew it in his bones," I said.
"Even if he didn't know it in his mind."

Maybe that's enough.
Maybe the bones know
what the mind forgets.
Maybe the peace at death
is the recognition
that was there all along.

Or maybe not.
Maybe he was just tired.
Maybe peace is just peace.

I don't know.
But I think—
I think the not-knowing
is also the Treasury.

---

[145-154]
The Systematizer (final):

Summary:
Ground: Samantabhadra. Complete.
Path: Recognition. Complete.
Result: Liberation. Complete.

All three: same completeness.
Not different stages.
Not progressive development.

The ground is the path is the result.
The path is the ground is the result.
The result is the ground is the path.

Circular?
Yes.
Linear?
Also yes.
Neither?
That too.

The teaching accommodates all minds.
Some need circles.
Some need lines.
Some need to be told
they don't need anything.

That's the Supreme Vehicle.
Not superior to others.
Just—complete.
From the start.

---

[155-162]
The Consort (final):

I told you to feel your heartbeat.
Did you?

Probably not.
You kept reading.

That's fine.
The reading is also practice.
The not-feeling is also practice.
Everything is practice.
Everything is the Treasury.
Everything is you.

But feel it now.
The heartbeat.
The pulse.
The life.

That's Samantabhadra.
Not the name.
The pulse.
The life.
The you.

Complete.
Perfect.
The end of the beginning.

---

[163-168]
The Singing Yogi (final):

I don't have a song for the ending.
My grandmother didn't teach me one.

But silence—
silence is also a song.
The song the valley sings
when the voice stops.
The song the heart sings
when the beat stops.
The song awareness sings
when there's no one to sing it.

That's the Treasury.
The song without singer.
The beat without drummer.
The opening without closer.

Rest in that.
Or don't.
Same thing.

---

[169-174]
Lion-Faced (final):

Final words.
Not mine.
Not Longchenpa's.
Not Samantabhadra's.

Yours.

Speak them.

Stop reading.
Start being.

The Treasury is open.
You are the opening.

AH!

---

[1-174]
All Voices (together):

The opening opens.
The ground grounds.
The path paths.
The result results.

You—you.

Complete.
Perfect.
The end.
