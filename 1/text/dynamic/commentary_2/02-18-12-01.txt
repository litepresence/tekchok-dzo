The First Point:

Kye ho!

You think you need to "arrive" at something.
Show me where you are not.

These half-bodies (sku phyed ma) appearing in spheres—
they are the eye trying to see itself.
The sphere is not a container.
The body is not half of anything.

Stop looking.
Let the looking look.

The Precision:

Consider:
Five Fathers. Five Mothers.
Ten deities. One mandala.

The enumeration suggests countability.
But these are not entities to be counted
like coins in a pouch.

They are modalities of recognition.
When recognition is partial, you see half.
When recognition is complete, you see whole.
The change is not in the vision.
The change is in the seeing.

Or so the texts say.
Find out for yourself.

The Vagabond:

Third winter in that cave above Dzogchen Monastery.
Every morning: lights. Circles. Buddha-forms.
I measured my progress by brightness.

"Today stronger than yesterday," I'd think.
Made charts. Really. Charts.
My teacher came. Saw the papers.
Laughed for ten minutes.
Took the charts. Burned them.
"The light doesn't know you're counting," he said.

I was furious. Then confused. Then—
well. The light was still there.
I just wasn't measuring it anymore.

That was the teaching.
Or the burning was.
Or the laughter.
Hard to say.

The Systematizer:

The causal nexus of purifier and purified.
Careful language here.
"Causal" suggests production.
"Nexus" suggests connection.

But nothing is produced.
Nothing is connected.
The defilement was never defiled.
The purification is recognition of this.

Therefore:
The antidote does not cure the poison.
The poison was never poison.
The antidote reveals this.

This is not medicine.
This is seeing.

Thus the framework dissolves itself.

The Integrator:

Rainbow lights of indeterminate hue.
'Ja' tshon khra bo.

What does indeterminate mean here?
Not: "we don't know what color."
But: "color determination has not yet occurred."

Before the mind fixes red as red,
before blue is distinguished from green,
there is this: luminosity without fixation.

That is the ground of vision.
Not the vision itself.
But what visions arise from.

Sorry. This explanation is getting too elaborate.
The point is simpler:
Don't fixate on what you see.
See the seeing.

The Singing Yogi:

Six. Ten. Five-three.
The numbers count mandala components.
But also—
and I heard this from an old weaver in Lhodrak—
they count the stages of forgetting you are counting.

Six: remembering there's nothing to count.
Ten: forgetting you remembered.
Five-three: the laugh when you realize
you've been counting forgetting.

She didn't explain it well.
Or maybe I didn't understand.
But her laugh—
that was the teaching.

Lion-Faced:

This anxiety about "arriving at measure."
Whose anxiety is it?

The one who needs to arrive?
But that one is already the arrival.
The one who is not yet arrived?
But that one doesn't exist.

Find the one who is measuring.
Show me their face.

I'll wait.

The waiting itself is the measure.
The anxiety is the wisdom.
You are looking for what is looking.

Stop.
Right here.
This is it.

No need to arrive anywhere.
