## CHAPTER 22: Signs of Liberation and Delusion in the Bardo and Beyond

**Tibetan:** རིམ་ཁང་ཉི་ཤུ་རྩ་གཉིས་པ། (Twenty-Second Lecture Hall)  
**Location:** Volume 2, Sections 02-22-01-01 through 02-22-07-01  
**Tibetan Lines:** 10211-12002  
**Total Liturgical Lines:** ~1,792

This chapter stands as one of the most practically consequential in the entire Treasury—presenting the **secret signs** (*rtags gsang ba*) that determine whether a practitioner will achieve liberation or fall into delusion during the critical transition through death, the bardo, and rebirth. While previous chapters established the theoretical ground of Dzogchen view and the methods of path practice, Chapter 22 reveals how to **read the signs** of one's spiritual attainment as they manifest in body, speech, and mind—both in this life and at the moment of death.

The chapter serves as the **culmination of practical instruction** for Volume 2, bridging the subtle body teachings of earlier chapters with the direct recognition practices that follow. It answers the crucial question: *How does one know if one's practice has been successful?*

## SECTION BREAKDOWN

### **Section 1: 02-22-01-01.txt (~604 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Secret Signs of Previous Purification—Body, Speech, and Mind

This foundational section establishes the **threefold typology of signs** that reveal past-life training:

<list> 1. **Signs of bodily purification**—marks appearing on forehead (body), throat (speech), and heart (mind)
<list> 2. **Signs of speech familiarization**—prophetic abilities, stable spoken words, unlearned meditation arising
<list> 3. **Signs of mental training**—spontaneous recognition, non-conceptual clarity, confidence in realization

**The Four Aspects of Signs:**
<list> - **Sequence** (*rtags kyi rim pa*)—the orderly progression of how signs manifest
<list> - **Suitability** (*'byung ba'i 'thad pa*)—the appropriateness of signs arising in particular individuals
<list> - **Fruit if familiarized** (*goms na 'bras bu*)—the two-life, three-life trajectories based on current effort
<list> - **Uncertainty if not familiarized** (*ma goms na nges pa mi rnyed pa*)—how signs without practice lead to unstable outcomes

**Critical Teaching:** These signs exist primordially in all beings—even butchers and prostitutes possess them—but they only ripen into liberation through **familiarization** (*goms pa*) in this life. Without practice, even powerful signs may result in birth as gods or demigods rather than buddhahood.

### **Section 2: 02-22-02-01.txt (~65 lines)**  
**Topic:** Signs of Familiarity with Expanse

This section presents the **five aspects of expanse** (*dbyings*) training:
<list> 1. **Essence**—vast, pervading, self-clear
<list> 2. **Definition**—center, expanse, nature of reality without end
<list> 3. **Division**—outer (sky), inner (lamp), secret (light and bindu), unsurpassed (great appearance)
<list> 4. **Characteristic**—vast opening, able to appear, like clear mirror expanse
<list> 5. **Result**—seeing reality's own essence, making direct non-change into path

**Inner Experience-Signs:**
- Joyful experience sitting alone
- Body light like cotton leaf
- Heart not desiring human association
- Thinking of flying in sky
- Perception of joy when appearance ceases
- No attachment to body and life
- Mind not entering whatever appearance

### **Section 3: 02-22-03-01.txt through 02-22-03-03.txt (~400 lines)**  
**Topic:** Signs of Familiarity with Bindu, Kāya, and Awareness

**Bindu (Thig le)—Five Aspects:**
<list> 1. **Essence**—not different, dwelling as one, without duality
<list> 2. **Definition**—bindu not-change, vast, greatly pervading all
<list> 3. **Division**—body-dwelling channel bindu, nature path bindu, complete result bindu
<list> 4. **Characteristic**—free of pain, round without elaboration, showing awareness appearance
<list> 5. **Result**—words cut, other mind not entering, speech-continuum exhausted

**Kāya (Sku)—Three Bodies as Path Appearance:**
- Dharmakāya—own-appearance, as long as dharmas exist, mind exists, therefore path
- Saṃbhogakāya—various appearing dharmas existing in rank, not final
- Nirmāṇakāya—emanating to benefit beings, spontaneously accomplishing activities

**Awareness (Rig pa)—Three Types:**
<list> 1. **Ground-dwell awareness**—beyond virtue-defect fault
<list> 2. **Path-appearance awareness**—famous in respective philosophical systems
<list> 3. **Insight awareness**—direct appearance of vajra chain kāya, free from thought word cage

### **Section 4: 02-22-04-01.txt (~175 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Peaceful and Wrathful Kāyas at Death

This section presents the **critical distinction** between two modes of liberation at death:

**Peaceful Kāya:**
- Arises when consciousness dissolves into sky
- At time of primordially-pure sky own-tone arising
- Liberates without reality bardo
- Five days of samādhi
- Cannot emit emanation kāya (too stable)

**Wrathful Kāya:**
- Arises from eye as Vajrasattva nose-rope
- Sound-light-ray three arise as own-appearance
- Liberates in five instant parts
- Twenty-one days to stability
- **Can** emit emanation kāya after stability

**The Great Secret:** Those liberated in primordial purity without transparent penetration (peaceful kāya) have no emanations because the impure field does not appear. Those liberating through wrathful kāya remain momentarily in spontaneously accomplished ground-appearance, then can emanate to benefit beings for sixty-eight thousand years.

### **Section 5: 02-22-05-01.txt and 02-22-05-02.txt (~277 lines)**  
**Topic:** Relics, Lights, and Sounds—The Physical Signs of Attainment

**Five Relics (Ring bsrel):**
<list> 1. **White relic** (*sha rī raṃ*)—bone essence, head, Vairocana
<list> 2. **Blue-black relic** (*ba rī raṃ*)—heat essence, rib joint, Vajrasattva
<list> 3. **Yellow relic** (*chu rī raṃ*)—blood essence, liver top, Ratnasambhava
<list> 4. **Red relic** (*bse rī raṃ*)—element essence, kidney, Amitābha
<list> 5. **Green relic** (*nya rī raṃ*)—awareness essence, lung top, Amoghasiddhi

**Measure:** Mustard seed to poppy seed size, oily, round, gathered, possessing five colors' depth clarity.

**Five Lights:**
- Essence: awareness tone
- Definition: appearing clear
- Division: daytime-holding, wisdom five own-tone, measure of familiarity
- Characteristic: self-illuminating without other illuminators
- Result: condition for buddhahood

**Two Sounds:**
- *Huṃ*—slow continuity long peaceful drum-sound, complete buddha in seven days
- *Thug*—fierce short wrathful thunder-sound, complete buddha in fourteen days

### **Section 6: 02-22-06-01.txt (~195 lines)**  
**Topic:** Signs of the Six Realms—Recognizing Rebirth Destinations

This section presents the **external signs** at death that reveal where consciousness will take rebirth:

**Hell Realms:**
- Black clouds cover sky like darkness
- Rain, mist, great wind, hail, dust storms
- Eight hot hells, eight cold hells, occasional hells, neighboring hells, sentient being hell Avīci, vajra hell

**Hungry Ghost Realms:**
- Sky unclear, rays fading, sunset-like appearance
- Sun and moon "dead," yellow clouds obscuring
- Cold rain, evening rain

**Animal Realms:**
- Sky dark, warmth without oiliness, black clouds
- Fog banks, blue-gray valleys
- Unpleasant, unclear sky

**Demigod Realms:**
- Strong wind rising from all directions
- Black clouds like terrifying creatures
- Thunder, lightning, roaring
- Sun and moon's light cloud-obscured

**God Realms:**
- Clear, bright sky, sun and moon clear
- No wind or hail, directions beautiful
- Desire realm gods, pure realm five, clear light fifteen, formless four

**Human Realms:**
- Clear sky without hail
- Soft white clouds like stretched silk
- Sun and moon with rainbow light
- Merely human body, pure, jewel birth

**Critical Warning:** These signs can also indicate other events—siddhas transferring to pure fields, meditators achieving samādhi, people dying. One must examine the **person's conduct in life** to determine the meaning of signs.

### **Section 7: 02-22-07-01.txt (~13 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Nature of the Bardo

The chapter concludes with the **essential definition** of the bardo:

> "The bardo is the occasion when outer objects appear to inner mind."

From primordially pure inner expanse, all appearances are the bardo state—ground-appearance kāya and wisdom appearing as the two form kāyas' activities is the **pure dharma-nature bardo**; delusion-appearance six classes' dharmas all impure is the **delusion bardo**.

The difference between pure and impure dharmas? They exist between **primordially pure expanse and returning to primordially pure expanse**—one must cross through the bardo to return.

## PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

**For Practitioners:**
- Examine your body for marks (forehead, throat, heart)
- Notice spontaneous changes in voice and speech
- Observe if meditation arises without effort
- Pay attention to dream signs, especially teaching, flying, seeing buddhas
- Watch for changes in relationship to food, sleep, and social interaction

**At Death:**
- The signs appearing to the dying person reveal their destination
- Family and attendants should observe the sky, sounds, and bodily changes
- Proper recognition of signs can trigger remembrance and liberation
- Signs appearing two to three days before death indicate the realm of rebirth

**The Ultimate Point:** Signs exist to **guide practice**, not to become objects of attachment. The greatest sign is **recognition of awareness itself**—all other signs are its spontaneous display.

This chapter provides the **diagnostic tools** for assessing one's practice and the **roadmap** for navigating the critical transition at death. It transforms the fear of death into an opportunity for recognition, showing that liberation is not a matter of hope but of **recognizable, verifiable signs**.
