This extensive chapter—the longest in Volume 1—presents a comprehensive doxography (grub mtha') of philosophical systems, both non-Buddhist and Buddhist, that represent various ways the basis can be misunderstood. Longchenpa systematically analyzes mistaken vehicles, Buddhist tenet systems, causal and fruitional vehicles, outer and inner tantras, and culminates in the Great Perfection.

**Section 1 (01-04-01-01):** The chapter opens with "mistaken vehicles"—non-Buddhist systems that hold erroneous views about self and reality. Longchenpa examines Sāṃkhya eternalism with its belief in permanent selves, Lokāyata nihilism that denies karma and rebirth, and the 360 wrong views of Tīrthikas enumerated in the scriptures. The section also introduces the 100 enumerated teachers and their various philosophies.

**Section 2 (01-04-02-01):** The presentation transitions to Buddhist philosophical systems, beginning with the four Buddhist tenet schools (Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, and Madhyamaka) and their respective views on selflessness and emptiness. The section introduces the three vehicles (Hearer, Solitary Realizer, and Bodhisattva) and the three approaches to emptiness: Prajñāpāramitā, Tathāgatagarbha, and Madhyamaka. The presentation includes the ten grounds, five paths, and three sets of vows (Prātimokṣa, Bodhisattva, and Mantra), concluding with the Vehicle of Ati (Dzogchen) as supreme.

**Sections 3-11 (01-04-03-01 through 01-04-11-01):** These sections provide detailed analysis of the two truths—conventional (divided into false and true) and ultimate (divided into nominal and actual)—along with presentations of epistemological categories, valid cognition, and the nature of appearances.

**Section 12 (01-04-12-01):** A major section presenting the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) philosophy in detail. Longchenpa distinguishes between Consequentialist (Prāsaṅgika) and Autonomous (Svātantrika) schools, presents the six collections of Nāgārjuna's reasoning, and compares the causal vehicle of the perfections with the mantra vehicle of secret teachings. The section covers outer tantras (Kriyā, Upāya/Caryā, and Yoga) with their respective practices of five manifest enlightenments.

**Section 13 (01-04-13-01):** A brief transitional section introducing the inner tantras and the generation and completion stage practices of Mahāyoga.

**Section 14 (01-04-14-01):** The longest and most detailed section, presenting the complete structure of Mahāyoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga (Great Perfection). Longchenpa explains the basis, path, and result of Mahāyoga tantra, including the three concentrations (suchness, all-illuminating, and cause), the five Buddha families, and the purification of aggregates and elements. The section presents Anuyoga as the vehicle of expanse and primordial wisdom, emphasizing instantaneous versus gradual entry. The presentation culminates in the Great Perfection (Dzogchen) as the vehicle beyond all vehicles, detailing the three sections (Mind, Expanse, and Instruction), the 21,000 volumes, and various categories of instructions including the Six Mind Directions and the Four Spaces.

**Sections 15-19 (01-04-15-01 through 01-04-19-01):** These sections continue the Great Perfection presentation with detailed analysis of the Space Section (klong sde), its four categories (Black Space, Variegated Space, White Space, and Vast Space), and various instruction categories including wind vital-points, self-arisen tantra instructions with four commands, and the organization of Great Perfection scriptures into cycles.

Readers should approach this chapter as both a philosophical education and a meditative preparation. Understanding these systems is not merely academic; each represents a potential way the mind can grasp at views and miss the direct recognition of nature. The thorough presentation of lower views makes the brilliance of Dzogchen's simple pointing-out instructions all the more apparent. This chapter rewards careful study, as the distinctions drawn here will be presupposed in the more advanced teachings of subsequent chapters.
