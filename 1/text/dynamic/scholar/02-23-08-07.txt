[14751-14751] <structure>

**Organizational Context:** This passage constitutes one section within the broader bardo (bar do) teaching sequence, specifically addressing the third of four progressive moments of awareness during the intermediate state between death and rebirth. The numbering [14751-14751] indicates this passage's position within the textual division's verse enumeration, following earlier sections on initial bardo appearances and preceding subsequent sections on the fourth moment.

**Structural Function:** This brief verse functions as a pivotal transition point within the bardo teachings, marking the shift from initial recognition of awareness to the establishment of that recognition. The terse formulation reflects the rdzogs chen (Great Perfection) literary convention of pointing directly to experience through minimal linguistic elaboration, trusting the practitioner's recognition to fill conceptual gaps.

**Tibetan Text Analysis:**
- གསུམ་པ་ (gsum pa): "Third" - ordinal numeral derived from གསུམ (gsum) with the -pa nominalizing suffix; indicates the third sequential moment in a fourfold progression
- ལ་ (la): dative-locative particle marking the domain or occasion being described
- དེའི་ (de'i): demonstrative pronoun with genitive particle, referring back to the previously established state/context
- ངང་ (ngang): "state, condition, mood" - from འངག (ngag) related to mental state or existential condition; here denotes the bardo state
- ལ་ (la): second dative particle creating a directional sense
- དར་ཅིག (dar cig): "instant, moment" - compound from དར (dar) meaning to spread/extend and ཅིག (cig) the numeral "one"; together meaning "a single instant"
- ཤེས་པ (shes pa): "knowing, knowing awareness" - verbal noun from ཤེས (shes) meaning to know; core term for consciousness/awareness in Buddhist epistemology
- ཟིན (zin): past-tense participle indicating completed action; "having known" or "knowing"

**Grammatical Analysis:** The construction follows a nominal frame with verbal complement: [Ordinal + ལ་] + [Possessive + ངང་ལ་] + [Temporal + ཤེས་པ་ཟིན]. The double ལ་ creates a sense of "in the direction of" or "regarding" the state, while the perfective ཟིན indicates completion of knowing within that instant.

[14751-14751] <context>

**Doctrinal Framework:** This passage addresses the third of four progressive moments in bardo awareness, part of the Nyingma (Rnying ma) tradition's elaborate bardo (bar do) cosmology. The bardo teachings, particularly developed in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition through texts like the Bardo Thodol (Bar do thos grol), describe the intermediate states between death and rebirth.

**Related Concepts:**
- **Four Moments of Bardo Awareness**: The tradition describes four progressive moments wherein the deceased gains varying degrees of recognition of the bardo state
- **Chönyi Bardo** (chos nyid bar do): The dharmatā bardo, the reality nature of phenomena
- **Siddha Position** (grub pa): The achieved state of recognition
- **Self-appearance** (rang snang): The way phenomena manifest from their own nature

**Connection to Atiyoga:** The emphasis on direct recognition (rig pa) without mediation aligns with Ati Yoga (Highest Yoga) view that liberation occurs through recognition of the ground (gzhi) rather than through gradual cultivation. The "knowing awareness" (shes pa) here is not ordinary consciousness but the intrinsically knowing quality of awareness itself.

[14751-14751] <concept>

**Philosophical Significance:** The phrase "knowing awareness in an instant" (shes pa dzin) addresses a critical point in Buddhist meditation theory—the nature of non-conceptual direct knowing. Unlike ordinary cognition which involves conceptual elaboration (rtog pa), this instant of knowing represents immediate, non-dual apprehension of the nature of awareness.

**Temporal Dynamics:** The use of "instant" (dar cig) rather than extended duration is significant. In Great Perfection teachings, liberation or recognition occurs in a non-temporal instant—not a moment in ordinary time but the timeless moment of awareness itself. This connects to broader Mahāyāna discussions of non-conceptual cognition (nirvikalpaka-jñāna).

** soteriological Implications:** The progression through four moments suggests that complete realization unfolds in stages, even within the bardo state. The third moment represents the stabilization of recognition—the practitioner no longer merely glimpses the nature but "has known" (zin), indicating completion of the recognition event. This completion prepares for the fourth moment's full realization as self-appearance.

**Practical Application:** For practitioners, this passage indicates that during the bardo—when ordinary mental fabrications have ceased—the natural knowing quality of awareness becomes more accessible. The teaching emphasizes that this knowing is not something to be created or cultivated but something to be recognized as already present.
