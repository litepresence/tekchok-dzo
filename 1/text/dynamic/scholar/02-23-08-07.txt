Third: Knowing Awareness in That State
Marker for the third stage in the fourfold bardo recognition sequence.

[14751] <philology>
*gsum pa la de'i ngang la dar cig shes pa zin* — "Third: knowing awareness in an instant within that state." *dar cig* (instant/moment) with perfective *zin* indicating completed recognition.

[14751] <context>
Third of four progressive moments in bardo awareness. The "instant" (*dar cig*) indicates non-temporal recognition—not a moment in ordinary time but the timeless moment of awareness itself.

[14751] <concept>
The stabilization of recognition: the practitioner "has known" (*zin*), indicating completion of the recognition event. This non-conceptual direct knowing prepares for the fourth moment's full realization as self-appearance.
