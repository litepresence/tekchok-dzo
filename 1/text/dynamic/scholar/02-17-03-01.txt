# Progressive Conduct: The Fourfold Yogic Practice
**Analysis:** This passage initiates Chapter 17, Section 3 on the yogin who progressively conducts (*rgyun du byed pa*) the four aspects of conduct. The structure presents: (1) The fourfold division (*bzhis te*) of progressive conduct; (2) Appearance power-transform conduct (*snang ba dbang bsgyur gyi spyod pa*) with its instruction on direct-placement (*cer bzhag*) method; (3) The twofold result—rising ground of appearance-existence (*snang srid gzhis bzheng*) and transformed afflictions (*nyon mongs gnas bsgyur*); (4) Threefold preliminary structure—brief general essence, extensive secret definite conduct, definite sequence conduct; (5) Three types of conduct—non-attach-holding, negate-affirm-not, attach-not-clinging. This establishes the *spyod pa* (conduct) framework within the view-meditation-conduct (*lta sgom spyod*) triad.

[2051-2063] <philology>
**Analysis:** The phrase *rgyun du byed pa* employs *rgyun* (continuum/continuity) with the terminative *du* to indicate continuous, progressive practice—not sporadic but sustained engagement. The genitive *gyi* in *dbang bsgyur gyi spyod pa* creates the attributive relationship—conduct OF power-transformation. The term *dbang bsgyur* (power-transform) combines *dbang* (power/authority/control) with *bsgyur* (transform/change), indicating mastery over transformation. The compound *cer bzhag* (direct-placement) combines *cer* (direct/straight) with *bzhag* (placement/establishment)—the method of immediate, non-manipulative placement of awareness. The negative constructions—*ma chags* (not attached), *dgag sgrub med* (negation-affirmation not exist), *zhen med* (not clinging)—employ privatives to indicate freedom from fixation. The continuative *las* following *gsum* indicates continuation from these three types.

[2051-2063] <context>
**Analysis:** This section belongs to the *spyod pa* (conduct) dimension of Chapter 17 on conduct bringing fruition (*'bras bu 'byin pa'i spyod pa*). The "appearance power-transform conduct" (*snang ba dbang bsgyur gyi spyod pa*) refers to the advanced practice of transforming (*sgyur ba*) all appearances into wisdom through recognition (*ngos 'dzin*), distinct from rejecting appearances. The "direct-placement" (*cer bzhag*) method derives from *Thalgyur* (*Thal ba rang grol*) instructions on *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) practice—placing awareness directly in appearances without mediation. The three types of conduct correspond to progressive freedom from fixation: (1) not holding attachment to appearance; (2) neither negating nor affirming—beyond conceptual fabrication; (3) engagement without clinging—the *snyom par spyod pa* (equal conduct) of advanced practitioners. The "rising ground" (*gzhis bzheng*) indicates the ground naturally manifesting through conduct.

[2051-2063] <concept>
**Analysis:** This passage presents the *spyod pa* (conduct) as the active expression of view and meditation. The four aspects are: (1) appearance power-transform—recognizing all appearance as wisdom-display; (2) direct-placement—immediate placement of awareness without conceptual mediation; (3) ground-rising—natural emergence of the basis through conduct; (4) affliction-transformation—converting emotional defilements into wisdom. The three types of conduct represent progressive stages of non-fixation: (1) *ma chags 'dzin pa*—not holding attachment, allowing experience without grasping; (2) *dgag sgrub med pa*—beyond negation and affirmation, transcending conceptual fabrication (*rtog pa*); (3) *chags la zhen med*—engaged appearance without clinging, the *snyom par spyod* (equal conduct) that transforms phenomena without rejecting them. This is the *kun tu spyod pa* (all-pervading conduct) of the yogin who has realized the nature.
