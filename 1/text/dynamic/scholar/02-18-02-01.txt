. Bodily conduct: cutting attachment through transformative activity.

[4156-4157] <philology>
The opening citation from Sangs rgyas kyi bu gcig pa (Single Son of Buddha) employs the technical terminology of bodily conduct (lus kyi spyod pa) as transformative practice. The instrumental particles (-kyis, -gis) function here as means indicators—showing how physical activities serve as the method for cutting attachment. The causative construction bsgrub pa (accomplishing/transforming) in "transformative body" (bsgrub pa'i sku) indicates the result of successful practice. Compound terminology like lus kyi zhen pa (bodily attachment) and rang bzhin gyis chod (naturally cutting) demonstrate standard Tibetan tantric conventions with Dzogchen semantic extensions toward spontaneous liberation.

[4158-4172] <context>
This section establishes bodily conduct as foundational practice within the Dzogchen framework, citing authoritative tantric sources—Sangs rgyas kyi bu gcig pa, Thal 'gyur (Consequence Tantra), and rGya cher bkod pa le'u sum cu gnyis pa (Great Array Chapter Thirty-Two). These citations reflect the Nyingma emphasis on bka' ma (oral tradition) sources and demonstrate Longchenpa's synthetic methodology. The zhes so citation formula indicates transmission lineage rather than creative composition, while the de las gsungs pa (from that it is spoken) formula establishes textual authority through tantric source validation.

[4158-4172] <structure>
The passage at lines 4158-4172 demonstrates the systematic presentation characteristic of Longchenpa's expository style. The structural markers rim pa (graduated stages) organize the material from general bodily activities (running, lying, rising) through specific transformative practices (dance, mudra) to the ultimate purpose (splitting open attachment). The dbye ba (divisions) structure presents two types of purpose examined through common and supreme division. The section follows standard Nyingma doxographical conventions, moving from scriptural citation through analysis to practical application.

[4158-4172] <concept>
The content presents technical instructions for bodily conduct (lus kyi spyod pa) as the first of three doors (body, speech, mind) to be trained. The operational logic—cause (bodily karma), method (mindful conduct), result (transformative body)—reflects the standard Buddhist lam rim structure adapted to Dzogchen sensibilities. The key doctrinal point is that body is primary—at first when the body forms, speech and mind both depend upon it—therefore bodily conduct must be performed first. This demonstrates the integration of Anuyoga completion stage (rdzogs rim) methodologies within the Great Perfection framework, where physical practice serves as the foundation for subtler trainings.

[4173-4183]
. The purpose of bodily conduct: purifying karma and exhausting attachment.

[4173-4183] <context>
The section elaborates the twofold purpose of bodily conduct through scriptural citation from rGya cher bkod pa (Great Array), establishing the soteriological efficacy of physical practice. The citations reflect the Nyingma understanding that conduct is not mere ritual but functional technology for liberation. The emphasis on "splitting open attachment" (zhen pa 'byed pa) demonstrates the Dzogchen approach of directly targeting the root of samsara—attachment—through appropriate methods.

[4173-4183] <structure>
The structure moves from scriptural authority to temporal specification (seven days, eleven days, half a month) to progressive results (external attachment reverses, internal body endowed with discipline, secret illusory body liberated). This graduated presentation follows the Nyingma pedagogical model of matching practice duration with capacity and result.

[4173-4183] <philology>
The term zhen pa 'byed pa (splitting open attachment) employs violent metaphor—attachment is not merely reduced but split open, ruptured. The compound zhi gnas (peaceful discipline/śamatha) refers to the meditative stabilization that arises when physical attachment ceases. The phrase sgyu lus (illusory body/māyākāya) indicates the subtle body of clear light that manifests when coarse attachment is purified.

[4173-4183] <concept>
The phenomenology of bodily conduct presented here suggests a progressive purification: external bodily attachment self-reverses first, then internal body becomes endowed with peaceful discipline, finally the secret illusory body is liberated into clear light. This reflects the Dzogchen understanding that liberation operates at multiple levels—gross physical, subtle energetic, and ultimate clear light. The specific timeframes (seven days, eleven days, half a month) indicate that recognition can occur relatively quickly when correct method is applied with intensity.

. Gathering the teachings: classification of mind, space, and pith instruction sections.

[4184-4234] <context>
This section presents a comprehensive taxonomy of Dzogchen teachings, gathering (bsdus pa) the vast literature into organized categories. The classifications reflect the historical development of Dzogchen: mind sections (sems sde) associated with early translations, space sections (klong sde) with intermediate developments, and pith instruction sections (man ngag sde) with later systematization. The numerical specifications (three thousand tantras, eleven thousand chapters, etc.) reflect traditional Buddhist enumeration conventions.

[4184-4234] <structure>
The passage at lines 4184-4234 demonstrates Longchenpa's encyclopedic knowledge and systematic presentation. The structure employs repetitive "gathered into" (bsdus pa) formulas to organize teachings hierarchically: first into mind/space/pith instruction, then into subcategories (three spaces, etc.), then into numerical enumerations. This structural approach makes the vast Dzogchen literature comprehensible and navigable.

[4184-4234] <philology>
The term bsdus pa (gathering/summary) carries the sense of condensation without loss—vast teachings gathered into essential points. The compound sde tshan (sections/divisions) refers to the major textual categories of Dzogchen. The phrase sgra 'grel (proclamations/explanations) indicates oral teachings transmitted alongside written scriptures. The term thig le (bindu/essence sphere) refers to the most condensed pith instructions.

[4184-4234] <concept>
The hermeneutical framework presented here organizes Dzogchen teachings into three spaces for each section: for mind sections—meditation without meditation, nature without searching, no difference in characteristics; for space sections—play without cessation, mind without liberation, essence without good or bad; for pith instruction sections—essential points gathered, essential points seen, essential points known. These triads reflect the Dzogchen movement from effort to effortlessness, from seeking to recognition, from discrimination to equality.

[4235-4299]
. The nature of tantra: essence, term, divisions, and reading measure.

[4235-4299] <context>
This final section establishes the framework for understanding tantra as both meaning (don) and word (tshig). Citing the Theg mchog mdzod (Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle), the text presents the six aspects of tantra analysis: essence (ngo bo), definitive term (nges tshig), divisions (dbye ba), reading measure (klag tshad), example (dpe), and proof (sgrub pa). This reflects the standard Nyingma scholastic approach to textual classification.

[4235-4299] <structure>
The structure presents the six aspects in sequence, with particular attention to the first three. The passage at lines 4235-4299 demonstrates Longchenpa's method of establishing definitional clarity before proceeding to detailed analysis. The distinction between nature-meaning tantra (don gyi rgyud) and indicating-word tantra (tshig gi rgyud) establishes the hermeneutical foundation for all subsequent study.

[4235-4299] <philology>
The term rgyud (tantra/continuum) carries multiple connotations: showing family (rigs) because it causes birth in whatever family; decisive and unbroken continuity. The compound don gyi rgyud (meaning tantra) refers to the ultimate nature—mind-itself luminosity free from conceptualization stains. The term tshig gi rgyud (word tantra) refers to the textual expression—name-word-letter nature divided into chapters.

[4235-4299] <concept>
The ontological distinction between meaning and word tantra reflects the Nyingma understanding that scriptures are both ultimate reality (don) and conventional expression (tshig). The meaning tantra is mind-itself luminosity abiding permanently in all—therefore Buddha family. The word tantra indicates that very thing through name-word-letter. This non-dual hermeneutics prevents both reification of texts (as merely words) and dismissal of texts (as merely conventional). The reading measure further classifies generation stage (bskyed rim) as chiefly method, perfection stage (rdzogs rim) as chiefly wisdom, and Great Perfection as transcendence of both.
