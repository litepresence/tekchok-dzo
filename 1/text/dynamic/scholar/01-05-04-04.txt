# Enumeration of the Five Buddha-Families: The Web-Protector
**Analysis:** This brief passage marks the enumeration of the fifth (*lnga pa*) in a pentadic classification of Buddha-families. The term *dr ba mgon gyi* refers to the *Saṃvara* or web/net-protector configuration, indicating the completion of the five-family maṇḍala structure. The particle *dang* (and) signals continuation to the sixth enumeration, establishing the enumerative progression (rim pa) typical of tantric classification systems.

[6422] <philology>
**Analysis:** The phrase *dr ba mgon gyi sangs rgyas* employs the compound *dr ba mgon* (web/net protector) in the genitive case (*gyi*), followed by *sangs rgyas* (Buddha). The genitive establishes the Buddha OF the web-protection configuration. This follows the standard pattern: ordinal number (*lnga pa*) + locative particle (*la*) + genitive attribute + substantive. The honorific *sangs rgyas* maintains the reverential register appropriate to tantric enumeration.

**Analysis:** This brief line belongs to the enumeration of the five Tathāgata families (*de bzhin gshegs pa'i rigs lnga*), a fundamental maṇḍala structure in Mahāyoga and Atiyoga contexts. The five typically are: Vairocana, Akṣobhya, Ratnasaṃbhava, Amitābha, and Amoghasiddhi. The "web-protector" (*dr ba mgon*) configuration suggests a specific maṇḍala arrangement wherein the Buddhas are positioned as directional guardians in a net-like protection structure. This enumeration serves as a structural marker within the broader discussion of difficult points (*dka' gnas*) in secret mantra practice.

**Analysis:** The five-Buddha framework represents the *rigs lnga* (five families) structure central to Vajrayāna soteriology. Each Buddha corresponds to: a direction (center, east, south, west, north); a wisdom (mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing, dharmadhātu); a defilement transformed (delusion, hatred, pride, desire, envy); and an element (space, water, earth, fire, wind). The completion of this enumeration establishes the full maṇḍala for subsequent practice instructions.
