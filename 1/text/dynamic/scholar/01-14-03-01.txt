The fourfold analysis of sems
**Analysis:** Longchenpa analyzes sems (mind) according to the four categories:
1. **Essence (ngo bo):** Recognition arising as subject-object, pervaded by non-awareness
2. **Definition (nges tshig):** That which cognizes subject and object as such
3. **Divisions (dbye ba):** Pure and impure
4. **Individual meaning:** To be determined subsequently
The analysis includes reference to samadhi-one-pointedness (ting nge 'dzin rtse gcig), showing awareness of yogacara categories.

Citation from Sgra gcan 'dzin gyi yul la bstod pa
**Analysis:** The citation from the Praise to the Object of Rahula's Grasping establishes sems nyid dag pa (pure mind-itself) as:
- smra bsam brjod med (ineffable, inexpressible)
- shes rab pha rol phyin (perfection of wisdom)
- ma skyes mi 'gag (unborn, unceasing)
- nam mkha'i ngo bo (space-nature)
- so so rang gi ye shes (individual self-arising wisdom)

[17902] <structure> Transition to sems dag pa
**Analysis:** This line initiates the discussion of sems dag pa (pure mind), distinguishing it from sems nyid dag pa (pure mind-itself). The former refers to path-level purifications; the latter to primordial purity.

The Four Lamps Integration:
The distinct dharmas culminate in the integration of the four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*):
1. *rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma* (Far-reaching water lamp)
2. *thig le stong pa'i sgron ma* (Empty bindu lamp)
3. *dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Completely pure sphere lamp)
4. *shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma* (Self-arising wisdom lamp)

Each lamp has:
- Its own essence, definition, classification
- Specific measures and signs
- Integration with the three kayas
- Progressive familiarization stages

---

**Summary:** Page 413 initiates the third topic on distinct dharmas, establishing the ground-path-fruition structure and key terminology. The integration of the four lamps system provides the comprehensive framework for Dzogchen practice and realization.

[17902-17911] <concept>
Pure mind categories
**Analysis:**
- **sems dag pa:** Path-level purifications (lam dus kyi sems rtog pas ma bslad pa, thar pa'i rgyur rung)
- **sems nyid dag pa:** Primordial purity beyond path
The former includes samadhi-born and compassion-born states that serve as causes of liberation but remain samsaric because they cannot directly perceive self-arisen ultimate.

[17903-17911] <concept>
Two types of pure mind
**Analysis:** Longchenpa distinguishes:
1. **lam dus kyi sems (path-time mind):** Undeluded by conceptions, suitable as liberation cause, arises as samadhi
2. **rtogs bcas snying rje (compassion with realization):** Includes bodhicitta as liberation cause
Both are classified as samsaric (therefore "pure" in a relative sense) because they cannot directly apprehend the ultimate self-arisen ultimate truth.

The rol pa (display) and rgyan (ornament) distinction
**Analysis:** Longchenpa employs technical terminology:
- rol pa (display/play): The power (nus pa) or capacity (rtsal) arising from the basis
- rgyan (ornament): The mature manifestation (smin sor shar ba) like seeds producing shoots
The analogies (sa bon/myu gu, byad/me long) illustrate the non-dual yet distinct relationship between basis and manifestation.

[17919-17928] <concept>
Rol pa and rgyan distinction
**Analysis:**
- rol pa (display/capacity): nus pa or rtsal—the dynamic power arising from basis

- rig pa'i gdangs (awareness resonance)
The analogy compares rlung to a blind horse and rig gdangs to a lame person with eyes—neither alone functions, but together they traverse samsara.

The gnas: heart-center
**Analysis:** Abode located in snying (heart) to glo ba (lung) connecting region:
- rtsa sog ma'i sbu gu (blade-of-grass channel)
- rlung gi rta (wind-horse)
- rig pa'i gdangs (awareness-resonance)
Analogy: rlung = blind horse; rig gdangs = lame person with eyes. Neither functions alone; together they traverse samsara.

Analysis of de gnyis (those two)
**Analysis:** The phrase de gnyis refers to rlung and rig gdangs. The construction gnyis 'dres na (when the two mix) establishes the condition for conceptual thought ('gyu dgu 'gyu'i rtog pa). The negation mi 'gyu (does not arise) demonstrates the primordial separation (rang chas su gnas pa).

[18193] <context> Citation from Rig pa rang shar
**Analysis:** The citation provides the classic analogy: sems and rig pa are like water (chu) and bubbles (lbu ba). Sems does not have power over rig pa (sems kyi dbang du ma gyur). This establishes the fundamental asymmetry in their relationship.

De gnyis construction
**Analysis:** De gnyis (those two) refers to rlung and rig gdangs. Gnyis 'dres na (when two mix) establishes condition for conceptual thought ('gyu dgu 'gyu'i rtog pa). Mi 'gyu (does not arise) demonstrates primordial separation (rang chas su gnas pa).

Rig pa rang shar citation
**Analysis:** Classic analogy: sems and rig pa like water (chu) and bubbles (lbu ba). Sems lacks power over rig pa (sems kyi dbang du ma gyur), establishing fundamental asymmetry.

[18194-18195] <philology>
Completion of citation
**Analysis:** The citation from Rig pa rang shar concludes with the assertion that sems lacks power over rig pa, reinforcing the fundamental distinction.

Remaining six aspects of sems
**Analysis:** Longchenpa completes the eightfold analysis:
- **lam:** srog rtsa nas 'gyu (moves from life-channel)
- **sgo:** kha sna gnyis (mouth and nose)
- **ngo bo:** 'khor ba'i rang bzhin gzung 'dzin (samsaric nature of grasping-grasped)
- **rtsal:** yul la 'dzin zhing nga bdag tu zhen pa (grasping objects and clinging to I-me)
- **byed las:** 'khor ba'i bde sdug sna tshogs byed (creates samsaric pleasures and pains)
- **'bras bu:** 'khor ba dang ngan song (samsara and lower realms)

Multiple scriptural citations
**Analysis:** This section integrates citations from:
1. **Rig pa rang shar:** On the impure nature in the continua of beings, the threefold stacking in the heart-lung region
2. **Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long:** On how the three—ma rig pa, sems, yid—gather to form the basis of samsara
3. **He badzra:** On adventitious stains (glo bur dri ma)
4. **Rnam 'grel:** On mind's nature as luminous
5. **'Jam dpal la bstod pa:** On conceptions as great non-awareness

The meeting point of rlung and rig
**Analysis:** The passage anatomically locates the meeting point (gnyis 'dzom pa) between:
- glo ba nas rlung gi rta (wind-horse from lungs)
- snying nas rig gdangs rtsa (awareness-channel from heart)
This mixing produces bag chags kyi sdud byed sems (latency-gathering mind) and yul la rtog pa yid (object-conceiving mind).
