**Essence

:**
- All words' source clear
- Particularly cut by cutting-nature

**Characteristics

:**
- Nature without difference, samsara reference cut
- Characteristics not established in word-syllable
- Emptiness free from debate basis

**Four Divisions

:**
1. View placed in casket
2. Obstacle clearing severance
3. Hidden revealed
4. Explanation self-clear

**First: View Casket

:**
- Essence: without proliferation, pervading ground
- No good-bad in action

<concept>
Two Views: Appearance-Imputation and Mind-Realization
**Consideration:** Lines 3915-3921 present the two view subdivisions:

**Appearance-Imputation View

:**
- Essence: no dharmas, no Buddha name
- Nature: potency arises, samsara-nirvana view arises
- Characteristics: not definitively one, view-meditation measureless

**Mind-Realization View

:**
- Essence: unproduced, completely pure
- Afflictions self-place liberated
- Nature: unceasing, universally arising
- No acceptance-rejection
- Characteristics: causeless, primordially liberated
- Samsara-nirvana path exhausted

Obstacle Clearing and Six Stages
**Technical Examination:** Lines 3922-3949 present the severance obstacle clearing:

**Essence

:**
- Dharmatā crucial clearing
- Samsara-nirvana middle split
- Nature non-compressed ground penetrated
- No mind-son composition
- Characteristics: causeless ground pure
- Delusion self-immediately cleared

**Two Divisions

:**
- View-meditation heat obstacle clearing
- Entity abiding obstacle clearing

**Six Stages Detailed

:**

*View Three Stages:*
1. Moving: Samsara dharmatā recognized like thief [3936]
2. Obtained: Body-speech heat arises like fire-wood

3. Stable: Samsara side split like army victory

*Meditation Three Stages:*
4. Moving: Wind-mind rich-entered like rich treasury

5. Obtained: Mind path-entered like pig in ravine

6. Stable: Awareness power obtained like royal empowerment [3945]

*Conduct Three Stages:*
7. Moving: Consciousness reference lost, heart-wind agitation [3946]
8. Obtained: Delusion-appearance suppressed like garuda wing

9. Stable: Three bodies heat obtained like Brahmin woman

**Conclusion

:**
- Conduct clears appearance, appearance-condition no go-place in dharmatā
- Meditation moving obstacle cleared, recollection-thought samadhi no go
- View dharmatā obstacle cleared, not depending on dharmas, become Buddha
- Entity abiding: dharmatā unfabricated, whatever appears not non-mind

Self-Clear Explanation and Error Reversal
**Philological Analysis:** Lines 3972-3988 present the fourth instruction type and transition to error reversal:

**Self-Clear Explanation

:**
- Essence: word attachment continuum severed
- Established tenet not abiding, superior establishment
- Nature unobserved, completely pure
- Primordially pure dharmatā directionless arises
- Characteristics: not mind, changing-maker self-pure
- Entity-ground unfabricated

**Two Divisions [3981]:**
- Error pursued tradition
- Error ground-reversed manner

**Error Reversal First Type

:**
- Essence: delusion ignorance root, three realms samsara ground established [3979]
- Self-pursued, ignorance root cut
- Called: Self-awareness first [3981]
- Nature variously arisen, cause-condition pursued [3982]
- Object target severed
- Samsara delusion reference exhausted
- Causeless empty primordially pure [3983]
- Characteristics: delusion self-pure, knowing delusion path exhausted [3984]

**Three Divisions

Two Approaches to Error Reversal

**Detailed Analysis:** Lines 3977-3988 introduce two methods of reversing error/delusion (*'khrul pa*), followed by three detailed approaches.

**Initial Presentation:**

| Method | Tibetan | Mechanism | Lines |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| First | *'khrul pa gzhi la zlog pa'i tshul du gsungs pa* | Reversing delusion to ground | 3977 |
| Second | *thig le rang gnad la phab te gsungs pa* | Placing thigle at its own crucial point | 3978 |

**Note:** Line 3979 begins detailed exposition of the first method — cutting the root of delusion.

<philology>
Three Error Reversal Systems

**Terminological Precision:** Lines 3979-3992 present the detailed terminology of three approaches to reversing fundamental ignorance.

**First Approach: Root Cut (*rtsad gcod*)

:**

**Essence

:**
- Delusion root = non-awareness (*ma rig pa*)
- Basis of three realm samsara (*khams gsum 'khor ba'i gzhi*)
- When driven to self = ignorance cut at root (*ma rig pa rtsad bcad*)
- Called: self-awareness (*rang rig pa*)

**Key Term:** *rtsad bcad* — "cut at root" — definitive severing, not gradual elimination.

**Nature Analysis

:**
- Nature arises variously (*rang bzhin sna tshogs su byung bas*)
- Therefore causal-conditional searching (*rgyu rkyen gyi ba ded pa*)
- Object's vital point cut (*dmigs pa'i gdar sha chod*)
- Samsara's delusion basis exhausted (*'khor ba 'khrul pa'i ltos zad*)
- Result: causeless-empty primordial purity (*rgyu med stong par ye dag pa*)

**Second Approach: Self-Liberated Placing

:**
- Delusion root cut, samsara-nirvana view reverse
- Delusion self-liberated placing, non-deluded dharmatā recognize
- Delusion basis confidence, delusion-wheel continuum severed

:**

| Aspect | Tibetan | Function |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Essence | *dang po 'khrul ma myong bas ma rig pa'i rgyud dag* | First not experienced delusion, ignorance continuum pure |
| Present | *da lta 'khrul pa la mi gnas pa* | Now not abiding in delusion |
| Future | *phyis 'khrul mi srid pa* | Future delusion impossible |
| Nature | *rang bzhin la dbyer med pas 'khor 'das gzhi gcig* | Without difference, samsara-nirvana ground one |

**Third Approach: Basis Confidence
