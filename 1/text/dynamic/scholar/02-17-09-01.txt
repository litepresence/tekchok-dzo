. Mirror training: recognizing phenomena as reflection-like illusions.

[3124-3129] <structure>
This section presents the mirror meditation (me long sgom pa) as the foundation for recognizing the illusory nature (sgyu ma'i rang bzhin) of all phenomena. The structure follows a graduated pedagogical approach: (1) establishing that outer-inner phenomena have no difference, (2) questioning the utility of holding appearances as true, (3) presenting the mirror-reflection metaphor, (4) engaging in specific training practices with one's reflected form, (5) applying recognition to all dualistic categories. The progression moves from simple mirror contemplation through active manipulation of the reflection to universal application.

[3124-3129] <context>
The mirror practice represents a classical Buddhist meditation found in both sutra and tantra traditions. The citation from the Ljonpa-asked Sutra (Tshong dpon g.yo ba zhus pa'i mdo, i.e., Vimalakirti-nirdesa) establishes scriptural authority: "Upon completely pure mirror-mandala / Like face-reflection appearing / How nature not established / Ljonpa, know phenomena." The Arya Samadhiraja Sutra (Ting nge 'dzin rgyal po mdo) provides additional citations using water-moon and illusionist metaphors. This reflects the Nyingma integration of sutra and tantra perspectives on emptiness.

The term me long (mirror) carries its technical sense as a meditation support for recognizing emptiness. The compound gzugs brnyan (reflection/image) refers specifically to mirror-reflections as the primary metaphor for illusory appearance. The phrase ngo bo ma grub (nature not established) employs the technical Madhyamaka vocabulary of essencelessness (niḥsvabhāva). The term sgyu ma (illusion/māyā) indicates the magical, non-substantial nature of phenomena. The particle 'i in bdag gzhan (self-other) marks the dualistic categories that must be transcended.

[3124-3129] <concept>
The epistemology of mirror meditation is profound: the reflection appears vividly yet has no essence, serving as the perfect analogy for all phenomena. The concept of phyi nang gi chos (outer-inner phenomena) encompasses the entire range of experience—external objects and internal mind. The question "Holding as true—what use?" (bden par 'dzin na ci la phan) challenges naive realism at its root. The eightfold categorization (self-other, enemy-friend, food-clothing, enjoyment, pleasant-unpleasant, denial-affirmation, birth-death, happiness-suffering, sickness-pain) demonstrates the comprehensive scope of the practice.

[3130-3144] <structure>
The core training section presents active engagement with the mirror reflection: putting on clothes (gos gon), putting ornaments (rgyan bkod), removing and throwing outside (phyir 'phyang), praising (bstod), and disparaging (smad). The structure demonstrates that regardless of how the reflection is manipulated, it remains essenceless (ngo bo ma grub). This active experimentation proves the illusory nature through direct experience rather than mere intellectual understanding.

[3130-3144] <context>
The active manipulation of the mirror-reflection represents the experimental verification of emptiness. Unlike passive contemplation, this practice requires the yogin to test whether the reflection has any true existence by subjecting it to various conditions. The scriptural grounding in Mahayana sutras establishes this as authentic Buddhist practice, not merely Dzogchen innovation. The practice prepares the practitioner for recognizing the illusory nature of the bardo body (bar do'i sgyu lus).

[3130-3144] <philology>
The term gos (clothes) and rgyan (ornaments) indicate the conventional attributes of identity that are projected onto the reflection. The verb 'phyang (throw/discard) indicates the radical renunciation of attachment even to positive attributes. The terms bstod (praise) and smad (disparage) represent the extreme evaluations that reveal the reflection's unchanging essencelessness. The phrase yid la byed pa (mental engagement/recollection) indicates the continuous mindfulness required.

[3130-3144] <concept>
The phenomenology of mirror training reveals that all dualistic experiences are like reflections: they appear (snang) but lack essence (ngo bo med). The concept of 'khrul snang (deluded-appearance) indicates that ordinary perception mistakes appearances for truly existent entities. The term bden med (truthless/without truth) indicates the absence of ultimate reality in phenomena. This practice establishes the foundation for the illusory body yoga (sgyu lus) that follows.

. Nighttime training: dream yoga and illusory-body mastery.

[3145-3168] <structure>
This subsection transitions to nighttime practice: dream yoga (rmi lam sgom pa) and illusory-body training. The structure presents: (1) knowing all appearances as dream-like, (2) training mastery over all appearance-existence, (3) recognizing that attachment becomes sesame-grain-sized (tiny), (4) citations from Abhisamayalankara (mNgon rtogs rgyan) establishing twelve aspects of application, (5) concluding that true-attachment to deluded-appearance ceases through this training.

[3145-3168] <context>
Dream yoga represents the bridge between waking and sleeping practice, essential for maintaining continuity of recognition. The citation from Abhisamayalankara establishes the Mahayana pedigree of dream yoga. The reference to holy precious lama Gyalwa Zhangton (rGyal ba Zhang ston) and scholar Nyibum (dGe bshes gNyi bum) provides lineage authority. The Thal 'gyur citation validates the practice: "Train illusory-body dream / By that mastery, body itself also / Become like shadow-form."

[3145-3168] <philology>
The term rmi lam (dream) carries its technical sense as a domain for practicing recognition. The compound sgyu lus (illusory body/māyākāya) refers to the subtle body that manifests in dreams and bardo. The phrase til gyi 'bras bu (sesame grain) metaphorically indicates minimal attachment—attachment becomes as small as a sesame seed. The term sgyu ma lta bu (illusion-like) characterizes the nature of all dream phenomena. The phrase nges pa'i skye ba (final existence) indicates that mastering this practice leads to liberation without further rebirth.

[3145-3168] <concept>
The integration of daytime and nighttime practice (nyin mtshan gnyis ka) reflects the Dzogchen ideal of continuous recognition. The concept of sgyu lus (illusory body) is crucial: it is not the coarse physical body but the subtle body of clear light that appears transparent and shadow-like (grib ma lta bu). The twelve aspects (yan lag bcu gnyis) of application reaching peak indicate comprehensive mastery. The ultimate result: seeing the body as transparent, holding the bardo illusory-body, becoming a final-existence person—liberation in this lifetime.
