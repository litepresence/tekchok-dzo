# Wind-Mind Self-Dissolution: Location and Dual Wind Theory
**Analysis:** This passage presents the foundational (*dang po*) framework for Chapter 12 on wind-mind self-dissolution (*rlung sems rang grol*). The structure follows the *gnas 'gyu 'bras gsum* (location, movement, result) pattern: (1) Location (*gnas*)—body channels (*lus rtsa*), winds located therein (*de la rlung gnas*); (2) Movement (*'gyu*)—wisdom and karma winds moving as two; (3) Result (*'bras*)—wisdom wind ripens nirvāṇa, karma wind ripens saṃsāra. The section concludes with a threefold hermeneutical structure: abandoning objection (*rtsod pa spang ba*), establishing objection (*rtsod pa dgod pa*), and giving answer (*lan gdab pa*)—the classic debate (*rtsod pa*) framework. This establishes the dialectical structure for analyzing the relationship between winds, mind, and liberation.

**Analysis:** The locative construction *lus la rtsa gnas* (channels located in body) and *de la rlung gnas* (winds located in that) employs the locative particle *la* to indicate spatial containment. The phrase *rlung la ye shes dang las rlung gnyis su rgyu ba* uses the locative *la* with the verb *rgyu ba* (to move/go) to specify what moves within the winds—wisdom and karma as two. The instrumental *kyis* in *ye shes kyi rlung gis* and *las rlung gis* marks the agent of ripening (*smin par byed*). The verb *smin pa* (to ripen/mature) appears in its causative form (*smin par byed*), indicating the winds cause ripening into saṃsāra or nirvāṇa. The terminative *la* in *rtsod pa spang ba la* (regarding abandoning objection) marks the topic for subsequent analysis.

[15769-15777] <context>
**Analysis:** This passage establishes the *rtsa rlung thig le* (channels, winds, essences) framework central to completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practices. The distinction between *ye shes kyi rlung* (wisdom wind) and *las kyi rlung* (karma wind) derives from the *guhyasamāja* and *kālacakra* tantric traditions, adapted in *rDzogs chen* to explain how the same wind-energy can produce either saṃsāric or nirvāṇic results depending on recognition. The "abandoning, establishing, and answering" (*spang ba, dgod pa, lan gdab pa*) structure follows the standard Indian and Tibetan debate format (*vadāvakāśa*), wherein objections are first cleared away, then presented, then answered. This dialectical method belongs to the *rigs pa'i gnas* (science of reasoning) tradition, applying logical analysis to tantric physiology.

[15769-15777] <concept>
**Analysis:** The dual wind theory presents a fundamental *rDzogs chen* soteriological principle: the same subtle energy (*rlung*) that produces saṃsāra when unrecognized produces nirvāṇa when recognized. The *ye shes kyi rlung* (wisdom wind) is the natural, unrestricted flow of vital energy through the central channel (*rtsa dbu ma*), associated with primordial awareness (*ye shes*) and the result (*'bras bu*). The *las kyi rlung* (karma wind) is the conditioned, restricted flow through the left and right channels (*rtsa ro ma, rkyang ma*), associated with conceptual mind (*yid*) and the cause (*rgyu*). The location (*gnas*) of these winds in the body channels establishes the *lus gnas* (body abode) principle—the body as the field of liberation. The ripening (*smin pa*) process indicates that winds are not merely physical but carry karmic and wisdom-potential—sowing the seeds of future states.
