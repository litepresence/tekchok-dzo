Fruition Liberation into the Expansive State (*'bras bu db yings su grol tshul*)

**Analysis:** Lines 15635-15661 present the second major section of the fruition chapter, structured in three parts:
1. **Actual liberation into expanse** (*db yings su grol tshul dngos*)
2. **Nature of abiding in the expanse** (*db yings su gnas pa'i rang bzhin*)
3. **How dharmatā's intention-depths curl** (*chos nyid kyi dgongs klong ji ltar 'khyil ba*)

This tripartite structure mirrors the classic Buddhist framework of:
- Path (*lam*)
- Ground (*gzhi*)
- Fruition (*'bras bu*)

**Architectural Placement:** This section constitutes the pivot from "ground" (*gzhi*) to "fruition" (*'bras bu*). The key transition is marked by *dris med dang bral bas phye bar rig par bya'o* ("understand through distinction of freedom from defilement").

**Connection to Preceding:** Following the discussion of primordial purity (*ka dag*) in the ground section, this demonstrates how that ground manifests as fruition—distinguished by the absence of adventitious defilements (*glo bur gyi dri ma*).

[15635-15661] <philology>
## Technical Terminology: Fruition Markers

**Particle Analysis:**
- *kyang* (emphatic): Lines 15646-15647 use *kyang* three times to establish equality: *grig pas ngo mnyam tha dad med pa* - "through oneness, equal face, without difference"
- *las* (ablative): *dngos 'bras bu la khyad par med la* - "no difference in actual fruition"
- *du* (terminative): *thig le nyag gcig tu sangs rgyas te* - "awakened into single bindu"

**Critical Terms:**
- *dngos 'bras* - actual fruition (contrasts with *rgyu 'bras* causal fruition)
- *dri med* - stainless/freedom from defilement (more precise than *dag pa* "pure")
- *thig le nyag gcig* - single unique bindu (not "point" but dimensionless dimension)
- *shel 'od nang du bsdus pa* - gathered into crystal-light interior

**Wylie Precision:** *snying po* (line 15660) carries specific connotations:
- Sanskrit: *hṛdaya* (heart-essence)
- Not merely "essence" but "that which is most intimate"

[15635-15661] <context>
## Scriptural Sources: *Mu tig phreng ba* and *Klong drug pa*

**Primary Citation:** Line 15635 cites *Mu tig phreng ba* (*Māyājāla*? or Nyingma tantra):

> "The liberation place itself is the beginning"

This establishes the non-temporal nature of fruition—there is no "when" liberation occurs, as it is primordial.

**Secondary Citations:** Lines 15659-15660 cite *Klong drug pa* (Six Expanses):

> "When all elaborations (*spros pa*) are pacified near the all-good Samantabhadra..."

**Textual History:** The *Klong drug pa* is a major Nyingma tantra within the *Rnying ma rgyud 'bum*, specifically in the *Atiyoga* class. Its presence here establishes Longchenpa's reliance on authentic Indian (or Indian-attributed) sources rather than purely Tibetan compositions.

**Doxographical Implications:** The juxtaposition of:
- *Mu tig phreng ba* (Jewel Garland) - Mahāyāna sūtra associations
- *Klong drug pa* (Six Expanses) - Dzogchen tantra

demonstrates Longchenpa's synthetic methodology, grounding Dzogchen in broader Mahāyāna authority.

[15635-15661] <concept>
## The Single Bindu Theory

**Analysis:** The text presents *thig le nyag gcig tu sangs rgyas* (awakened into single unique bindu) as the fruition state. This bindu has four characteristics:

1. **Non-dual nature** (*gnyis med*): Not two (saṃsāra/nirvāṇa)
2. **Non-difference** (*tha dad med*): No distinction between Buddhas
3. **Self-nature** (*rang bzhin*): Not constructed but intrinsic
4. **Single** (*nyag gcig*): Neither one nor many

**Philosophical Unpacking:** The simile of space (*nam mkha'*) appears three times:
- *nam mkha' lta bu* - like space
- *nam mkha' nam mkha' la thim pa lta bu* - like space dissolving into space
- *nam mkha' gcig tu gyur* - become singular space

This invokes *Madhyamaka* emptiness but recontextualizes it:
- Mādhyamika: Space is mere absence of obstruction
- Dzogchen: Space is luminous self-occurrence (*rang shar*) of awareness

**Temporal Dimensions:** The text addresses three temporal modes of liberation:
- *tshe 'dir* - in this life (with signs, *rdos bcas*)
- *bar dor* - in bardo (self-appearance recognized)
- *sprul pa'i zhing du* - in emanation fields (breath emanated)

[15661-15748] <structure>
## Fivefold Nature of Expansive Abiding

**Analysis:** Lines 15661-15748 present five aspects of how awareness abides in the expanse:

1. **Elements dissolving into mother** (*'byung ba ma la zha ba*) - the five elements return to source
2. **Wisdom dissolving into expanse** (*ye shes dbyings su thim pa*) - five wisdoms merge
3. **Prajñā supported in sky** (*shes rab mkha' la 'deg pa*) - five winds stabilize
4. **Light dissolving into expanse** (*'od gsal dbyings su 'khyil ba*) - luminosity curls into expanse
5. **Awareness recognizing self-ground** (*rig pas rang sa zin pa*) - self-recognition completes

**Structural Logic:** This represents progressive subtlety:
- Physical (elements)
- Energetic (wisdoms)
- Cognitive (prajñā)
- Luminous (light)
- Recognition (awareness)

**Connection to Preceding:** These five parallel the five phases of phowa (*'pho ba*) but in reverse—instead of projecting consciousness outward, here all phenomena dissolve inward.

[15661-15748] <philology>
## Five Elements Dissolution

**Technical Terminology:**

The text uses specific terminology for element dissolution:
- *mar grol* - liberated downward (not "dissolved" but "liberated")
- *dbyings su thim* - dissolve into expanse (not "destroyed")
- *bag la zha ba* - dormant in latency (not "gone")

**Element-Wisdom Correspondences:**

| Element | Dissolution Image | Wisdom | Symbol |
|---------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| Wind | *rdo rje rgya gram* - crossed vajra | *dm tshig gi lha mo* - samaya goddesses | *mkha' la 'khyil* - curl in space |
| Earth | *rin chen rnam lnga'i mchod rten* - five jewel stūpa | *sa dbyings su thim* - dissolve into earth-expanse | Solidity without rigidity |
| Water | *chos shel gyi 'khor lo* - dharma-crystal wheel | *chu dbyings* - water expanse | Wetness without moisture |
| Fire | *padma'i dr ba 'od 'bar* - blazing lotus net | *me dbyings* - fire expanse | Heat without burning |
| Space | *chos nyid klong yungs* - dharmatā expanse | *nam mkha' dbyings* - space expanse | Purity from primordial |

**Particle Analysis:**
The instrumental *kyis* appears extensively:
- *dag stobs kyis* - by power of purification
- *ye shes kyi 'byung chen* - wisdom's great elements
- *smon lam gyis bskyed* - produced by aspiration

[15661-15748] <context>
## Comparative Element Systems

**Kālacakra Framework:** The five elements appear in *Kālacakra* as:
- Space, wind, fire, water, earth (in order of density)
- Dissolution at death follows reverse order

**Dzogchen Distinctions:**
- **Order:** Space, earth, water, fire, wind (unique to this presentation)
- **Mechanism:** Not dissolution of density but recognition of wisdom-display
- **Result:** Not emptiness but *ye shes* manifestation

**Guhyagarbha Influence:** The imagery of *rin po che* (jewels) and *padma* (lotus) derives from *Guhyagarbhatantra* maṇḍala architecture:
- Eastern vajra family (Akṣobhya)
- Southern jewel family (Ratnasambhava)
- Western lotus family (Amitābha)
- Northern karma family (Amoghasiddhi)
- Central buddha family (Vairocana)

**Longchenpa's Synthesis:** The *sbyangs pa* (purification) terminology integrates Sarma (new translation) medical-energetic frameworks into Nyingma dzogchen presentation.

[15661-15748] <concept>
## Wisdom Five and the Five Mothers

**Analysis:** Lines 15776-15781 present the five wisdom winds (*ye shes kyi rlung lnga*) as five goddesses:

1. **Stob ldan ma** (Power-Possessing) - Wind purified
2. **Shugs 'chang ma** (Force-Holding) - ascending wind
3. **'Degs byed ma** (Lifting) - pervading earth-nature
4. **Brtan ma** (Stable) - life-wind
5. **Snang byed ma** (Illuminating) - space-nature

**Philosophical Structure:**
The five winds represent the energetic substrate of the five wisdoms:
- Wind (movement) → Dharmadhātu wisdom (space)
- Ascending (upward) → Mirror-like wisdom (clarity)
- Pervading (expansion) → Equality wisdom (equanimity)
- Stable (continuity) → Discriminating wisdom (distinction)
- Illuminating (awareness) → All-accomplishing wisdom (activity)

**Gender Dimensions:** The feminine (*ma*) terminology reflects Vajrayāna's association of:
- Wisdom (*prajñā*) with feminine
- Method (*upāya*) with masculine
- The five mothers (*yum lnga*) as consorts of the five buddhas

**Critique of Essentialism:** While using gendered imagery, the text's *ye nas yod pa* (primordially existent) framework undermines biological essentialism—wisdom winds are neither male nor female but cognitive capacities.

[15748-15812] <structure>
## Light Dissolving into Expansive Curl

**Analysis:** Lines 15748-15812 present four characteristics of luminosity (*'od gsal*) dissolving into the expanse:

1. **Not dull in dissolution** (*thim pa la rmugs pa med*) - awareness remains lucid
2. **No conceptualization in clarity** (*gsal ba la rtog pa med*) - luminosity without thought
3. **No self in existence** (*yin pa la bdag med*) - natural selflessness
4. **Non-distinct yet non-separable** (*so so ma 'dres la 'byed med*) - unity without confusion

**Structural Significance:** These four resolve the classic Buddhist dilemma:
- If dissolving → annihilation (*chad lta*)
- If clarity → eternalism (*rtag lta*)
- Solution: Luminosity without conceptualization

**Connection to Preceding:** The four qualities enable the fifth—*rig pas rang sa zin pa* (awareness recognizing self-ground)—completing the fivefold abiding.

[15748-15893] <philology>
## Fourfold Luminosity Analysis

**Terminological Precision:**

The four qualities use specific grammatical structures:

1. *Thim pa la rmugs pa med pa*:
   - Locative *la*: "in dissolution"
   - Negation *med*: "absence of"
   - Quality: Luminosity remains aware even when phenomena dissolve

2. *Gsal ba la rtog pa med pa*:
   - Instrumental function: Clarity as basis
   - Negation: No conceptual overlay
   - Quality: Direct perception without concept

3. *Yin pa la bdag med pa*:
   - Existential *yin*: "being/existing"
   - Reflexive *bdag*: "self"
   - Quality: Inherent selflessness of existence

4. *So so ma 'dres la 'byed med pa*:
   - Distributive *so so*: "each/every"
   - Negation *ma 'dres*: "non-mixed"
   - Quality: Distinctness without separation

**Comparative Terminology:**
These four parallel the four *smṛtyupasthāna* (foundations of mindfulness) but at fruition level:
- Body → dissolution
- Feeling → clarity
- Mind → existence
- Phenomena → distinctness

[15748-15893] <context>
## Nyingma Fruition Distinctions

**Comparison with Sarma Schools:**

| Feature | Geluk | Sakya | Kagyu | Nyingma (This Text) |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Fruition body | *Sa go 'phang* (ten grounds/bhūmis) | *Lam 'bras* (path-result unity) | *Phyag rgya chen po* (mahāmudrā) | *Ka dag lhun grub gnyis med* (primordial-spontaneous non-dual) |
| Luminosity | *'Od gsal stong pa* (empty luminosity) | *Gsal stong* (luminous emptiness) | *Rig pa 'od gsal* (awareness luminosity) | *Rig pa nang gsal* (inner-clear awareness) |
| Recognition | *Dngos gzhi* (main practice) | *Khrid* (guidance) | *Ngo sprod* (introduction) | *Rang sa zin* (self-ground recognition) |

**Klong chen rab 'byams' Innovation:** The *gnyis su med pa* (non-dual) formulation here differs from:
- *Advaita Vedānta*: Brahman-māyā identity
- *Kashmir Śaivism*: Śiva-Śakti non-duality
- Dzogchen: *Ka dag* (primordial purity) and *lhun grub* (spontaneous presence) are non-dual yet distinct (*ngo bo gcig la rnam pa tha dad*)

[15748-15930] <concept>
## Expansive Intention-Depths (*dgongs klong*)

**Analysis:** Lines 15893-15930 present how dharmatā's intention-depths curl (*'khyil ba*). The section opens with three sub-sections:

1. **Essence brief indication** (*ngo bo mdor bstan*)
2. **Aspects extensive explanation** (*rnam pa rgyas par bshad*)
3. **Meaning conclusion** (*don gyi mjug bsdu ba*)

**The "Great Source" (*lung chen po*):**
Line 15899 identifies the innermost essence as:
> "The heart of luminous awareness-wisdom, the great source of all Buddha dharmas"

This *lung chen po* has twelve qualities:
- Boundless (*mtha' yas*)
- Vast (*yang pa*)
- Powerful (*stobs che ba*)
- Final destination of view (*lta ba'i mthar thug gi skyel sa*)
- Unchanging (*'pho 'gyur med pa'i gzer*)
- Beyond conceptual mind (*tshur rol mthong ba'i blos brtag pa'i yul las 'das pa'i 'phyongs*)
- Omniscient mirror (*thams cad mkhyen pas me long*)
- Peak of all paths (*lam thams cad kyis bgrod pa'i rtse mo*)
- Liberation object (*grol ba'i yul*)
- Great treasury (*mdzod khang chen po*)

[15893-16000] <philology>
## Terminology of the Great

**The "Great" (*chen po*) Enumerations:**

The text employs 44 compound terms with *chen po* (great):

1. *Lung chen po* - great scriptural source
2. *Chos kyi snang ba chen po* - great dharma-display
3. *Dgongs pa chos nyid kyi stobs chen po* - great dharmatā intention-power
4. *Lta ba rang byung gi sgrol sa chen po* - great self-arisen view liberation-place
...
44. *Mi 'gyur yongs su gdal ba chen po* - great unchanging complete expansion

**Grammatical Patterns:**
Each follows the pattern: [Qualifying phrase] + *chen po*
- *Yang dag pa'i lung chen po* - "correct great source"
- *Mi rtog pa'i bsam gtan chen po* - "non-conceptual great samādhi"

**Semantic Development:**
The repetition creates a *mantra*-like effect, overwhelming conceptual mind with superlatives that point beyond language.

**Wylie Precision:**
- *'phyongs* - expanse/span (not merely *klong* "expanse" but measured extent)
- *sgrol sa* - liberation-place (not "place" as location but as condition)
- *yongs su gdal ba* - completely expanded (static perfection, not process)

[15893-16043] <context>
## Comparison: Buddha-Field Cosmologies

**Pure Land Systems:**

| Tradition | Central Field | Characteristics |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Pure Land (Ch/J) | Sukhāvatī | Amitābha, 48 vows, easy access |
| *Avataṃsaka* | Vairocana's palace | Multiverse, infinite interpenetration |
| *Guhyagarbha* | Akanistha (Ogmin) | Five-family maṇḍala |
| This Text | *Rin po che 'od 'bar* (Blazing Jewel) | Spontaneously present (*lhun gyis grub pa*) |

**Dzogchen Distinction:**
Unlike other systems where pure fields require:
- Birth through merit
- Visualization practice
- Guru's blessing

Here the pure field is *rang byung* (self-arisen) and *lhun grub* (spontaneously present)—not "created" but "discovered" through recognition.

**Lineage Citations:** Lines 15952-15961 extensively cite *Kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long* (Mirror of Samantabhadra's Mind), a major *Atiyoga* tantra. The imagery of:
- *ma bris par bkra* - spontaneously arrayed without painting
- *ma brtsegs par dpangs mtho* - lofty without construction
- *ma byas par rgya che* - vast without making

emphasizes the non-constructed nature of the fruition field.

[15893-16192] <concept>
## The Non-Dual Expanse and Wisdom

**Analysis:** Lines 15943-15966 present the relationship between expanse (*dbyings*) and wisdom (*ye shes*):

> "Expanse and wisdom appear as two; within dharmakāyi nature, depths-clarity body appears as ground of arising"

This establishes the key Dzogchen ontology:
- **Ontological status:** *gnyis su snang ba* (appear as two) - not "are" two
- **Functional status:** *'char gzhi* (ground of arising) - basis of manifestation
- **Ultimate status:** *dbyer med* (non-dual) - not ultimately distinct

**Philosophical Resolution:**
The apparent paradox of "two yet non-dual" is resolved through the *ngo bo/rang bzhin/thugs rje* (essence/nature/compassion) schema:
- Essence (*ngo bo*): Empty (*stong pa*), dharmakāya
- Nature (*rang bzhin*): Luminous (*gsal ba*), sambhogakāya
- Compassion (*thugs rje*): Unobstructed (*zang thal*), nirmāṇakāya

These are "threefold yet one" (*gsum du snang cing gcig*).

**Critical Passage:** Lines 16073-16076 present the "correct system" (*yang dag pa'i lugs*) that avoids two extremes:

1. **Nihilism extreme:** If primordial purity were nothing at all (*ci yang med pa*), Buddha-wisdom would be impossible
2. **Eternalism extreme:** If wisdom were a "thing" (*dngos po*), it would be conditioned and subject to change

**Solution:** The "wisdom three" (*ye shes gsum*) are present as subtle (*phra ba*) display-base, not as substantial entities.

[16043-16192] <structure>
## Critique of Wrong Views

**Analysis:** Lines 16043-16192 systematically refute two positions:

**Position 1: Absolute Emptiness** (*chos sku la ye shes med pa*)
- Claim: Fruition is mere emptiness, no wisdom
- Refutation: Then self-benefit and other-benefit impossible (line 16051)
- Reason: No different from empty space

**Position 2: Substantial Wisdom** (*dngos po'i ye shes*)
- Claim: Wisdom is a real "thing"
- Refutation: Then conditioned (*'dus byas*), subject to decay (line 16054)
- Reason: Like material form, would have characteristics

**Correct Middle Way:**
- Wisdom exists as *rang bzhin lhun gyis grub pa'i cha* - spontaneously present aspect
- Not "existent" (*yod pa*) as entity
- Not "non-existent" (*med pa*) as nihility
- Present as *shel gyi nang 'od* - light within crystal

[16043-16218] <philology>
## Debate Terminology

**Classical Debate Structures:**

The refutation uses standard *bsdus grwa* (collected topics) format:

1. **Position stated** (*phyogs snga ma*):
   - *sngar rab pa kha cig* - some earlier [scholars]

2. **Refutation** (*dgag pa*):
   - *gal te...na* - if...then
   - *thal* - absurd consequence

3. **Reason** (*rgyu mtshan*):
   - *ci yang med pa'i nam mkha'* - empty space
   - *khyad par med pa'i phyir* - no difference

4. **Scriptural support** (*lung gi dgag pa*):
   - Cites *Klong drug pa* and *Sgron ma snang byed*

**Technical Terms:**
- *tha dad* - difference/distinction
- *phyogs dang po* - first position (proponent)
- *gzhan* - other/party
- *lugs* - system/tenet
- *dngos 'dzin* - reification/grasping at entities

**Wylie Precision:** *dgag pa* (refutation) vs *dgrub pa* (proof):
- Refutation removes wrong views
- Proof establishes correct view
- Both necessary for complete understanding

[16192-16328] <structure>
## Conclusion: The Fruition Mdzod

**Analysis:** Lines 16192-16328 present the final synthesis:

> "Thus, the non-dual expanse and wisdom, dharmakāya's final culmination, is called the 'great primordial non-dual liberation-place' (*ka dag chen po*)"

**Final Qualities:** The fruition has four aspects:
1. **Final fruition** (*mthar thug gi 'bras bu*)
2. **Great inner expanse** (*nang dbyings chen po*)
3. **Unsurpassed liberation-place** (*grol sa bla na med pa*)
4. **Non-dual vajra secret** (*gnyis su med pa'i rdo rje gsang ba*)

**Closure Structure:** The section concludes with:
- Citation from *Kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long* (line 16199)
- Citation from *Snying po'i mdo sde sher phyin rdo rje gcod pa* (Diamond Sūtra, lines 16209-16217)
- Final homage (*gus phyag 'tshal*) to the teacher

This creates a *maṇḍala* structure:
- Center: Dharmakāya non-duality
- Periphery: Scriptural authority
- Exterior: Devotional closure
[15662-15712] <structure>
Liberation into Primordial Purity: The Fruition Process
**Architectural Analysis:** This passage presents the complete fruition process—the dissolution of all phenomena into the expanse of primordial purity. The structure follows five progressive dissolutions:

1. Path appearances dissolve
2. Form bodies dissolve into Dharmakaya
3. Luminosity curls into expanse
4. Space merges with space
5. Awareness recognizes self-ground

This mirrors the dissolution process at death but here represents the complete exhaustion of samsaric manifestation.

**Temporal Framework:** The text presents three modes of liberation:
- This life: With physical signs
- Bardo: Through recognition of self-appearance
- Pure fields: Through breath transference

[15662-15712] <philology>
**Terminological Analysis:**

*Thig le nyag gcig* - Single unique bindu: Not a geometrical point but dimensionless dimension where all distinctions collapse. *Nyag gcig* (unique singular) emphasizes non-duality beyond one/many.

*Shel 'od nang du bsdus pa* - Gathered into crystal-light interior: The dissolution into clear luminosity within. *Shel* (crystal) indicates transparent clarity; *'od* (light) the luminous nature.

*Nam mkha' 'dres pa* - Space merging: The quintessential metaphor for non-dual dissolution where subject/object/space become indistinguishable.

*Rang sa zin pa* - Self-ground recognized: Fruition as awareness recognizing its own ground, not achieving something new.

[15662-15712] <context>
**Scriptural Sources:**

*Rang shar* citation (15683-15692): Presents the exhaustion of the realized being into the expanse of equality. Key phrase: *mi 'gyur mnyam nyid ngang du thim* (dissolved into the unchanging state of equality).

*Klong drug pa* citation (15693-15709): Extensive presentation of the exhaustion process. All phenomena—memory, consciousness, aggregates, elements, faculties—exhaust into their nature at the time of liberation.

*Sku gdung 'bar ba* citation (15667-15677): From the Blazing Relic tantra, presenting the dissolution analogies:
- Sun rays gathering into sun
- Water dissolving into water
- Butter dissolving into butter
- Space dissolving into space

[15662-15712] <concept>
**The Fivefold Dissolution Process**

**1. Path Appearances Exhausted:**
All phenomena of the path—kayas, wisdoms, appearances—dissolve. The path was a means; when fruition dawns, the means are exhausted like a raft left behind after crossing a river.

**2. Form Bodies into Dharmakaya:**
The form kayas (Nirmanakaya, Sambhogakaya) dissolve into the Dharmakaya expanse. This is not destruction but recognition of their ultimate nature.

**3. Luminosity Curls into Expanse:**
The five lights (*'od lnga*) curl back (*'khyil ba*) into the expanse, like a coiled snake. This represents the reabsorption of manifestation into essence.

**4. Space Merges with Space:**
The quintessential non-event: space dissolving into space indicates:
- No coming or going
- No transformation from one state to another
- Recognition of primordial nature

**5. Awareness Recognizes Self-Ground:**
The culmination: awareness recognizes its own ground (*rang sa*). This is not an achievement but a recognition of what was always the case.

**Soteriological Implications:**

*Zad pa* (Exhaustion): Not nihilistic cessation but:
- Exhaustion of confusion (*'khrul pa zad pa*)
- Exhaustion of effort (*'bad rtsol zad pa*)
- Exhaustion of hope/fear (*re dogs zad pa*)

*Thim pa* (Dissolution): Not destruction but:
- Dissolution into nature (*rang bzhin la thim*)
- Self-liberation (*rang grol*)
- Primordial perfection (*ye rdzogs*)

**Three Modes of Liberation:**

1. **This Life** (*tshe 'dir*): Complete enlightenment with physical body
   - Signs: Lights, sounds, relics (*rdos*)
   - Rainbow body (*'ja' lus*) or great transference (*'pho ba chen po*)

2. **Bardo** (*bar do*): Recognition during intermediate state
   - Self-appearance recognized (*rang snang zin*)
   - Liberation without return

3. **Pure Fields** (*sprul pa'i zhing*): Birth in pure realm
   - Through phowa consciousness transference
   - Continued practice to full enlightenment

**Metaphor Network:**

**Vase of Space** (15655-15658):
- Body: Like space in a vase
- Recognition: Opening of the vase aperture
- Result: Space of vase merges with great space
- Meaning: Individual awareness recognizes universal nature

**Sun and Rays** (15664, 15667-15677):
- Rays naturally gather into sun at sunset
- Similarly, appearances gather into awareness
- Indicates natural process, not forced

**Water, Butter, Space Analogies:**
All indicate:
- Same nature dissolving into itself
- No transformation required
- Primordial identity recognized

**Dzogchen Distinction:**
Unlike gradualist paths where fruition is achieved through purification, here fruition is:
- Recognition of primordial purity (*ye nas ka dag*)
- Self-liberation of adventitious defilements (*glo bur rang grol*)
- Spontaneous perfection (*lhun grub*)

[15713-15780] <structure>
The Resultant State: Samantabhadra Buddha
**Architectural Analysis:** Lines 15713-15780 present the complete resultant state—awareness abiding as primordial purity with all kayas and wisdoms naturally manifesting without proliferation or cessation.

**Key Formulation:** The text establishes that in the resultant state:
- All kayas and wisdoms transcend existence/nonexistence
- Appearances continue without obstruction
- The nature is like crystal displaying light and color without inherent establishment

[15713-15780] <philology>
**Technical Terms:**

*Shel gong* - Crystal/clear stone: The metaphor for the resultant state—transparent yet displaying all colors.

*Rang 'dug* - Self-abiding: The natural state requiring no maintenance.

*Zlos pa* - Repetition/cycling: Used negatively—no cyclic repetition in the expanse.

*'Od mi 'gyur ba'i sangs rgyas* - Unchanging light Buddha: Samantabhadra as immutable luminosity.

[15713-15780] <context>
**Nyingma Sources:**

The passage cites *Klong drug pa* extensively, establishing the exhaustion process as the definitive Nyingma view. The presentation of all phenomena transforming into pure appearance at liberation reflects the *Man ngag sde* perspective.

**Doxographical Position:**
This distinguishes Nyingma Dzogchen from:
- Geluk: Emptiness as mere negation
- Sakya: Appearance-emptiness indivisible
- Kagyu: Mahamudra as path
- Nyingma: Primordial perfection as ground-path-result

[15713-15780] <concept>
**The Crystal Metaphor Explained:**

**Crystal Nature:**
- Transparent (*gsal ba*): Empty of inherent nature
- Light-displaying (*'od snang*): Luminous appearance
- Color-capable (*kha dog*): All phenomena manifest
- Unestablished (*ma grub*): No inherent existence

This illustrates the Dzogchen view:
- Nature is empty (*stong pa*)
- Display is luminous (*gsal ba*)
- Function is unlimited (*thogs pa med pa*)
- Recognition is spontaneous (*rang grol*)

**The Five Lights as Ground:**
The five lights (*'od lnga*) that manifest:
- Continue to appear (*'char gzhi ma 'gags pa*)
- Without proliferation (*ma 'phel*)
- Without cessation (*ma zad*)
- Naturally present (*rang 'dug*)

This is the *lhun grub* (spontaneous presence) dimension—appearances self-arise and self-liberate continuously.

**Samantabhadra Fruition:**
The text identifies the resultant state as:
- *Kun tu bzang po* (Samantabhadra): All-good, universally auspicious
- *Ye shes lhun grub kyi mgon po* (Lord of spontaneously present wisdom)
- *Rdo rje 'chang* (Vajradhara): Holder of the vajra

These are not different persons but aspects of the awakened state:
- Samantabhadra: Primordial purity
- Vajradhara: Spontaneous presence
- Lord: Compassionate manifestation

**Temporal Freedom:**
The fruition transcends three times:
- Past: Exhausted (*zad pa*)
- Future: No further progress (*'gro med*)
- Present: Complete perfection (*rdzogs pa*)

**Path Exhaustion:**
*Lam gyi chos rnams 'bras bu thob pas zad*—path dharmas exhausted by obtaining fruition:
- View: Transcended
- Meditation: Self-liberated
- Conduct: Spontaneous
- Result: Already present

**Final State:**
The practitioner becomes:
- Equal to Samantabhadra (*kun tu bzang po dang mnyam pa*)
- Unchanging light Buddha
- Spontaneously accomplished master
- Holder of the vajra

This is the *zang thal* (direct) fruition—immediate recognition without stages.
