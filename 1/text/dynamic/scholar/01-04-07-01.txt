# Cittamātra: Two Branches and Three Subschools
**Close reading:** This passage presents the classification of Cittamātra (སྤྱོད་པ་སྣ་ཚོགས་པ་, *sems tsam*) into two main schools, then subdivides the first into three subschools. The structure follows: (1) Introduction to the two branches—True Aspect (རྣམ་པ་དེ་དག་པའི་, *rnam pa bden pa*) vs. False Aspect (རྣམ་པ་བཟང་པོའི་, *rnam pa brdzun pa*); (2) The jewel-reflection simile (རྫིང་འགྲམ་ནོར་བུའི་གཟུགས་བརྙན) illustrating the relationship between consciousness and its aspects; (3) The threefold subdivision (དབྱེ་ན་, *dbye na*) of True Aspectarians. The enumeration marker *dang po* (first) establishes the topical presentation, followed by *de lta bu* (such as) introducing the example, and *dbye na* (if divided) introducing subdivisions.

# Cittamātra Subdivisions
**Detailed Analysis:** Longchenpa identifies two main branches of Cittamātra:

1. **Sems tsam rnam bden pa** — Mind-Only Aspect-True (asserting consciousness aspects are truly existent)
2. **Sems tsam brdzun pa** — Mind-Only Aspect-False (asserting consciousness aspects are false)

The first school holds that appearances (*snang ba*) are true aspects (*rnam par bden pa*) of consciousness. The second holds they are false/illusory (*rdzun pa*). This distinction reflects the historical split between the True Aspectarians (*satyākāravādin*) and False Aspectarians (*alīkākāravādin*) in Indian Yogācāra.

# The Jewel-Reflection Simile
**Examination:** The simile of the jewel's reflection (*nor bu ke ke ru'i gzugs brnyan*) in water illustrates the Cittamātra position:
- The jewel hanging on a branch (*shing gi yal ga la btags pa*): external object
- Its reflection appears in the water (*chu nang du shar ba*): appearing aspect
- The reflection has the *aspect* (*rnam pa*) of the jewel but is not the jewel itself: consciousness-only

**Philosophical Significance:** This demonstrates that external appearances (*phyi rol*) are merely reflections/aspects of internal consciousness, lacking independent existence. The *rnam pa* (aspect/characteristic) is central to Yogācāra epistemology—consciousness never perceives objects directly but only its own representations. This parallels the *vijñapti-mātra* (consciousness-only) doctrine that all phenomena are "mere representations" (བྱེད་པ་ཙམ་, *byed pa tsam*) of consciousness.

# Three Subschools of True Aspectarian Cittamātra

**Technical Terminology:**
- *rnam pa'i grangs de nyid la* (aspects equal number)
- *sgong bkas pa ltar* (egg-split metaphor)
- *sna tshogs gnyis med* (various yet nondual)

**Close Reading:** The text presents three subschools:

1. **Equal number thesis:** Number of aspects equals number of consciousnesses

2. **Egg-split thesis:** Aspects and consciousness relate like an egg split in half

3. **Nondual variety thesis:** Aspects and consciousness are various yet nondual

**Key Point:** These subschools represent different attempts to explain the relationship between consciousness and its representations in Yogācāra philosophy.
