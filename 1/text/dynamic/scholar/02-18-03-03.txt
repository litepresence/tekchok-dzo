Third: The Four Pure Visions
**Consideration:** This section presents the third division (*gsum pa*) concerning the four pure visions (*snang ba bzhi*) that arise naturally (*rang bzhin*) through progressive stages (*rim pa*) after receiving direct introduction (*ngo sprod*) and engaging in experiential practice (*nyams su blangs pa*). The structure establishes: (1) the prerequisite conditions (introduction and practice); (2) the subject (four pure visions); (3) the manner of arising (natural order). The verb *'char ba* (to arise/dawn) indicates spontaneous manifestation rather than constructed achievement.

**Hermeneutical Frame:** The construction *de ltar phab cing* employs *de ltar* (thus/in that way) referring back to the previously described introduction, with *phab* (transmitted/introduced) in continuative form (*cing*). The phrase *nyams su blangs pa* uses *nyams* (experience/taste) in locative (*su*) with *blangs* (taken/engaged)—the technical term for engaging teachings experientially. The compound *snang ba bzhi* (four visions) is qualified by *ji ltar 'char ba'i rim pa* (the progressive stages of how they arise). The particle *las* indicates "from" or "through" this engagement. The term *rim pa* (gradual sequence) specifies ordered development rather than simultaneous appearance.

**Close Reading:** This section belongs to Chapter 18 on the mandala (*dkyil 'khor*), specifically treating the four pure visions (*dag snang bzhi*) that characterize advanced Dzogchen practice. The four visions are: (1) *chos nyid mngon sum gyi snang ba*—direct vision of dharmatā; (2) *nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba*—vision of increasing experience; (3) *chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba*—vision of dharmatā's exhaustion; (4) *'dzin pa zad pa'i snang ba*—vision of fixation's exhaustion. These represent the progressive stages of *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) practice, culminating in the complete exhaustion of phenomena (*chos zad*) and fixation ('dzin zad). The mention of direct introduction (*ngo sprod*) references the initial pointing-out instructions essential to Dzogchen path structure.

**Examination:** The four pure visions (*dag snang bzhi*) represent the progressive revelation of awareness's (*rig pa*) natural luminosity (*rang gsal*) as obscurations dissolve. Unlike gradualist paths requiring constructed attainment, these visions arise spontaneously (*lhun grub*) when the practitioner rests in recognition (*ngos 'dzin*) without fabrication. The first vision reveals dharmatā directly; the second sees experiences multiply while remaining empty; the third observes all phenomena dissolving into their true nature; the fourth witnesses the exhaustion of even the concepts of "empty" and "not empty." This progression demonstrates the Dzogchen principle of *gnas 'gyur* (transformation of abiding) rather than *spangs blangs* (abandonment and adoption)—not purifying defilements but recognizing they were never established.
