## Three Kayas: Essence and Aspect

**Core Teaching:** "Though essence is one, the Three Kayas abide in the expanse through different aspects" (ngo bo gcig la ldog pa tha dad kyi tshul du sku gsum dbyings la bzhugs te).

This reflects the Madhyamaka ekartha (single nature) principle applied to the doctrine of multiple form-bodies—Dzogchen integrates Madhyamaka ontology with tantric phenomenology.

**Key Terms:**
- ye shes snang ba: wisdom-appearance
- ldog pa: aspect/differentiation
- dmigs pa'i yul: perceived object/cognitive content
- thogs pa med: without obstruction

**Verse Analysis:** Three characteristics: (1) without obstruction to anything, (2) perceived objects being one, (3) essence appearing individually.

<concept>
**Philosophical Architecture:** The Trikaya doctrine through Dzogchen phenomenology:
- **Dharmakāya** (chos sku): empty essence—beyond conceptual proliferation (rtog med)
- **Sambhogakāya** (longs sku): luminous nature—unceasing display (ma 'gags)
- **Nirmāṇakāya** (sprul sku): compassionate display—whatever appearing (cir yang snang ba)

These are modalities of single awareness (rig pa gcig), not separate ontological entities.

<context>
**Doxographical Context:** This represents the "result vehicle" ('bras bu'i theg pa) view—enlightenment is recognition of what is already present, not acquisition of something new. The three kayas arise from the ground of primordial awareness (ye shes).

**Closing:** "In this, complete; Awakened" (di la rdzogs pa / sangs pa)—recognizing the three kayas as modalities of single awareness constitutes the completion of the path.
