The first subsection presents two aspects: (1) brief presentation of the definition of kayas (sku'i nges brjod mdor bstan pa), and (2) extensive explanation of the place (gnas rgyas par bshad pa). The core teaching establishes that "though essence is one, the three kayas abide in the expanse through different aspects" (ngo bo gcig la ldog pa tha dad kyi tshul du sku gsum dbyings la bzhugs te). This reflects the Madhyamaka ekartha (single nature) principle applied to the doctrine of multiple form-bodies, demonstrating how Dzogchen integrates Madhyamaka ontology with tantric phenomenology. The structure moves from brief definition through scriptural citation to extensive analysis, following the standard Nyingma pedagogical sequence.

Longchenpa quotes the Rang shar (Self-Arisen) tantra on the three kayas as "wisdom-appearance" (ye shes snang ba), presenting three characteristics: without obstruction to anything (gang la thogs pa med pa), perceived objects being one (dmigs pa'i yul ni gcig pa yi), and essence appearing individually (ngo bo so sor snang ba'o). This citation reflects the Nyingma emphasis on bka' ma (oral tradition) sources and demonstrates Longchenpa's synthetic methodology. The presentation of kayas as modalities of appearance (snang tshul) rather than distinct ontological entities reflects the Dzogchen view that the three kayas are different aspects of single awareness rather than separate entities.

[670-676] <philology>
The term ye shes snang ba (wisdom-appearance) employs the technical Dzogchen vocabulary for appearances that arise from wisdom rather than delusion. The compound ldog pa (aspect/differentiation) indicates that the kayas are distinguished by how they appear rather than by essence. The phrase dmigs pa'i yul (perceived object) carries the epistemological sense of cognitive content. The verse structure demonstrates classical Tibetan tantric poetics with seven-syllable lines and parallel structure (gcig pa yi / so sor snang ba'o).

The philosophical architecture here presents the Trikaya doctrine through the lens of Dzogchen phenomenology. The concept of ekartha (single nature) indicates that while Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya appear different, they share a single essence—primordial awareness (ye shes). The distinction between essence (ngo bo) and aspect (ldog pa) reflects the Madhyamaka two-truth framework adapted to tantric soteriology. The concept of "without obstruction" (thogs pa med pa) indicates that the kayas pervade all phenomena without impediment, reflecting the Dzogchen understanding of all-pervasive wisdom.

[677-682] <structure>
A second citation maps the trikaya onto single awareness (rig pa gcig), presenting a systematic correspondence: thought-free awareness as Dharmakaya essence, unceasing clear awareness as Sambhogakaya, and whatever-appearing awareness as Nirmanakaya. The structure demonstrates the integration of the three kayas with the three aspects of awareness, following the Nyingma systematic presentation.

[677-682] <context>
The citation continues from the same source (Rang shar), establishing the doctrinal continuity of the teaching. The mapping of kayas onto awareness reflects the Dzogchen teaching that the three kayas are not external attainments but modalities of one's own mind. This represents the "result vehicle" ('bras bu'i theg pa) view that enlightenment is recognition of what is already present rather than acquisition of something new.

The term rtog med (thought-free) describes the Dharmakaya as beyond conceptual proliferation. The compound ma 'gags (unceasing) indicates the Sambhogakaya's continuous display of luminosity. The phrase cir yang snang ba (appearing as whatever) describes the Nirmanakaya's manifold manifestations. These technical terms require precise understanding to avoid conflating the kayas with ordinary mental states.

[677-682] <concept>
The philosophical synthesis here is profound: the three kayas are not separate realms or bodies but different modes of awareness's self-manifestation. The concept of rig pa (awareness/pristine cognition) serves as the ground from which all three kayas arise. The Dharmakaya represents awareness's empty essence, Sambhogakaya its luminous nature, and Nirmanakaya its compassionate display—reflecting the threefold schema of essence (ngo bo), nature (rang bzhin), and compassion (thugs rje) fundamental to Dzogchen.

The final lines ('di la rdzogs pa / sangs pa) function as transitional markers indicating completion of this section. The fragmentary nature suggests either a section break or the beginning of a new hermeneutical move. The phrase "In this, complete; Awakened" (ces so) marks definitive closure of the teaching on the three kayas in the expanse.

[683-684] <context>
The closing formula reflects the standard Nyingma presentation structure, where teachings are marked as complete before transitioning to subsequent topics. The term rdzogs pa (complete/perfected) indicates that the presentation of the three kayas is comprehensive, while sangs pa (awakened) points to the soteriological result of understanding this teaching.

[683-684] <philology>
The particle 'di la (in this) functions as a demonstrative pointing to the entire preceding teaching. The verb rdzogs (complete) in its perfect form indicates finalized presentation. The term sangs (awakened) carries the etymological sense of purification—suggesting that understanding the three kayas purifies obscurations.

[683-684] <concept>
The philosophical implication of the closing is significant: recognizing the three kayas as modalities of single awareness constitutes the completion of the path and the awakening to Buddhahood. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching that enlightenment is not a future attainment but immediate recognition of the kayas as already present. The brevity of the closing—just two lines—suggests the teaching's profundity: what needs to be said has been said; what remains is recognition, not further elaboration.
