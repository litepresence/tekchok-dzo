Ground's Characteristics and Nature

**Ground's Six Characteristics:**
1. **Not created** (*ma byas*): not produced by causes
2. **Not destroyed** (*ma bcom*): not destroyed by conditions
3. **Unchanging** (*mi 'gyur*): beyond change
4. **Spontaneously present** (*lhun grub*): naturally perfect
5. **Beyond concepts** (*rtog pa las 'das*): inexpressible
6. **All-pervading** (*khyab pa*): pervading all

From *Rang shar*:
"Ground six characteristics
Not created, not destroyed
Unchanging, spontaneous
Beyond concepts, all-pervading
Sixfold complete"

**Ground's Threefold Purity:**
1. **Primordially pure** (*ka dag*): pure from beginning
2. **Naturally pure** (*rang bzhin gyis dag*): pure by nature
3. **Completely pure** (*yongs su dag*): pure of adventitious stains

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Ground three purities
Primordial, natural, complete
Threefold purity
Ground thus"

# The Ninefold Body Samaya Schema
**Analysis:** The three-vajra system subdivides each vajra into outer (*phyi*), inner (*nang*), and secret (*gsang ba*), then each of those into three subcategories (*phyi'i phyi* etc.), yielding 27 total, though the text focuses on the first three.

  - *ma byin blangs pa* = stealing (Skt. *adattādāna*)
  - The causal *pas* marks theft as the cause of deterioration

- **Line 9907-9908:** *de yi rtags su yan lag nad / mi bzad sna tshogs lus la 'byung*—"As signs of that, limb diseases, various unbearable [diseases], arise in the body"

Ground and Path Relationship

**Ground as Basis:**
Ground not path—path arises from ground.
Ground not result—result manifests ground.

From *De nyid*:
"Ground not path
Path from ground arises
Ground not result
Result manifests ground
Basis thus"

**Path's Relation:**
Path does not create ground—path reveals ground.
Path does not change ground—path recognizes ground.

From *Rang shar*:
"Path not creates ground
Path reveals ground
Path not changes ground
Path recognizes ground
Path thus"

**Result's Relation:**
Result not separate from ground—ground's self-expression.
Result not added to ground—ground's natural perfection.

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Result not separate
From ground self-expression
Result not added
Ground natural perfection
Result thus"

[9941-9946] <concept>
Inner-Inner Prohibition: Vehicle Disparagement
**Analysis:**

  - Striking with hands, weapons, or stones

- **Lines 9985-9986:** Disparaging siblings' bodies: *rnams smin brjod mi nus*—"ripened result is inexpressible"

[9988] <structure> Summary Enumeration
**Analysis:** *de ltar na sku'i dam tshig la phyi nang gsang ba gsum du phye bas dgu yod do*—"Thus, body samaya divided into outer, inner, secret—nine exist"

Confirms the ninefold structure: 3 categories × 3 subdivisions each = 9 body samayas

[9989] <structure> Transition to Speech Samaya
**Analysis:** *gnyis pa gsung gi dam tshig la'ang gsum las*—"Second: speech samaya also from three"

Transitions to the second of the three vajras: speech (*gsung*), which will similarly divide into nine.

Ground Beyond Effort

**No Need for Effort:**
Ground naturally perfect—no need to create.
Ground primordially pure—no need to purify.
Ground spontaneously present—no need to accomplish.

From *De nyid*:
"Ground no effort need
Naturally perfect
Primordially pure
Spontaneously present
Effortless thus"

**Why Practice Then?**
Practice not to create ground—practice to recognize ground.
Practice not to change ground—practice to manifest ground.

From *Rang shar*:
"Practice not creates
Practice recognizes
Practice not changes
Practice manifests
Practice purpose thus"

**Delusion and Recognition:**
Delusion: not knowing ground.
Recognition: knowing ground.
Both equally ground—no separation.

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Delusion not knowing
Recognition knowing
Both equally ground
No separation thus"
