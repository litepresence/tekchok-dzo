## Pure Appearance in Cittamatra

**Core Teaching:** Now as various aspects appear, both meeting consciousnesses appear merely as the stain of intellect. In ultimate truth, non-dual primordial wisdom exists with its qualities. Nothing is established as consciousness.

**Key Points:**
- At the time of remainder, when slight stain of latent tendencies appears mistaken
- Taste, sickness, etc. exist conventionally
- When stain of mixed affliction and wisdom is purified, pure wisdom manifests
- The pure is not merely false aspects and consciousness

**Philosophical Context:**
- This addresses the Cittamatra (sems tsam) distinction between consciousness and wisdom
- "Self-aware wisdom" (rang rig ye shes) is the ultimate—beyond false aspects
- Objects appear as reflections—like both measurer and measured are non-existent

## Middle-Way School and Autonomous

**Transition:** The passage now addresses the Madhyamaka "middle-way" (bar pa'i lam) and "autonomous" (rang rgyud) positions.

**Two Consequences:** These two philosophical systems represent different approaches to ultimate truth.

<philology>
**Key Terms:**
- rnam shes: consciousness
- ye shes: wisdom/pristine cognition
- rang rig: self-aware/self-recognition
- dri ma: stain/defilement
- gnyis med: non-dual
- chos sku: dharmakaya

**Philosophical Context:**
This passage addresses the relationship between Cittamatra (Mind-Only) and Madhyamaka views:
- Cittamatra holds that appearances are "consciousness only" (vijñapti-matra)
- Madhyamaka holds that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence
- Dzogchen differs: appearances are the self-radiance (rang gsal) of wisdom itself, not merely consciousness

<concept>
**Cittamatra Division:**
- Stained assertion (dri bcas rdzun pa): appearance with obscurations
- Pure assertion (dri med dag pa): pure appearance—when affliction and wisdom are mixed, then purified, the pure wisdom of remainder manifests

The passage ultimately points to "self-aware wisdom" (rang rig ye shes)—not consciousness apprehending objects, but the self-luminous awareness that knows itself.

<context>
**Doxographical Relevance:** This section bridges Cittamatra and Madhyamaka:
- Cittamatra: appearances as "consciousness-only" (vijñapti-matra)
- Madhyamaka: emptiness of inherent existence
- Dzogchen: appearances as wisdom's self-radiance (rang gsal)

The "remainder" (lhag ma) refers to the subtle manifestation that remains after coarse afflictions are purified—the pure wisdom dimension that is always present but obscured by confusion.

The passage also addresses the simile of objects appearing as reflections (gzugs brnyan lta bu)—like reflections in a mirror, both the "measurer" and "measured" appear, yet in ultimate truth neither has true existence.

This connects to the "middle-way school" (bar pa'i lam) and "autonomous" (rang rgyud) consequences mentioned at line 3035—the Madhyamaka analysis of how appearances relate to emptiness.

The transition to line 3035 marks the move from Cittamatra analysis to Madhyamaka proper.

This prepares for the presentation of Dzogchen view which transcends both.
