[10910-10912] <structure>
Three Kaya Division
**Analysis:** Standard triad: chos sku (dharmakaya), longs sku (sambhogakaya), sprul sku (nirmanakaya). This division appears across all Mahayana schools but receives distinct interpretation in Dzogchen.

[10913-10918] <context>
Dzogchen Distinction: Path Appearance vs. Result
**Analysis:** Critical doxographical distinction: common vehicles consider three kayas as fruition ('bras bur 'dod), while Great Perfection considers them as path appearances (lam gyi snang bar 'dod). This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on recognition during the path of what is ultimately the case.

[10915-10918] <concept>
Dharmakaya as Self-Appearance
**Analysis:** Chos sku rang snang yin — dharmakaya is one's own appearance. The reasoning: as long as dharmas exist, mind exists, therefore it is path; as long as kayas exist, body exists, therefore it is path appearance. Not ultimate (mthar thug ma yin). This subordinates kayas to the path process rather than treating them as ontological endpoints.

[10919-10921] <concept>
Exhaustion Appearance
**Analysis:** "dngos gzhi tshad phebs rdzogs nas / zad pa'i snang ba ste / ka dag la thim du nye ba" — when the main practice reaches complete measure, exhaustion appearance (zad pa'i snang ba) approaches dissolution into primordial purity. This technical term indicates the stage where phenomena no longer appear as solid/obstructing.

[10922-10924] <concept>
Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya as Path Appearance
**Analysis:** These kayas are also path appearances because while various appearing dharmas exist in stages, they are not the final extreme of markless equality (mtha' bral ris med mnyam pa'i mthar thug ma yin).

[10925-10928] <concept>
Spontaneously Accomplished Appearance
**Analysis:** At the time of measure-reach, from spontaneously accomplished appearance arise kayas, fields (zhing), and teachers. This indicates the natural unfolding of display (rol pa) without fabrication.

[10930] <philology> Lam snang 'od gsal stong pa'i rang bzhin
**Analysis:** Path appearance characterized as clear-light empty nature. 'Od gsal (clear light) indicates luminous clarity, stong pa (empty) indicates lack of inherent existence, rang bzhin (nature) indicates this is not an attribute but the fundamental character.

[10931-10933] <concept>
Result as Secret Jewel Interior
**Analysis:** Result described as ka dag rin po che gsang ba'i sbubs (primordially-pure jewel secret interior) where movement produces only the arising-basis of inner-clear three kayas. This spatial metaphor (sbubs = inside) suggests kayas are always present but obscured.

[10934-11025] <context>
Extended Relic Tantra Citation
**Analysis:** Lengthy citation from Sku gdung 'bar ba enumerating signs of three kaya familiarity: dharmakaya signs include body invisible to others while yogin plays freely; sambhogakaya signs include playing in five kayas and five wisdoms; nirmanakaya signs include speaking untaught dharma and displaying miraculous powers. The verses employ distinct dzogchen technical terminology.

[10968-10978] <context>
Relic Tantra Citation: Miraculous Powers
**Analysis:** Citation continues from Sku gdung 'bar ba describing siddhis resulting from kaya practice: flying in sky, penetrating mountains, entering earth, not drowning in water. Line 10976 marks the critical transition point: "dbyings rig gdeng du ma tshud na" (if expanse-awareness is not entered as confidence) — indicating these powers alone do not constitute realization.

[10977-10981] <concept>
Element Dissolution at Death
**Analysis:** If confidence is not achieved, elements self-dissolve ('byung ba nyid ni rang dengs su) and at death, transferring to the bardo of reality (chos nyid kyi bar do), liberation occurs in five instants (skad cig lnga la grol bar 'gyur). This describes the "automatic liberation" characteristic of Dzogchen at death.

[10982-11025] <context>
Extended Verses on Nirmanakaya Signs
**Analysis:** Comprehensive enumeration of signs indicating nirmanakaya familiarity: (1) previously heard dharma meanings arising instantly in continuum, (2) spontaneously speaking unheard dharmas, (3) clear recitation of other tantras, (4) answering questions according to beings' dispositions, (5) lion-like speech, (6) enhanced physical powers, (7) reversal of aging, (8) rejuvenation, (9) arising of unprecedented compassion, (10) ability to give body/limbs, (11) touching nirmanakaya.

[10990-10991] <philology>
Cig car du 'char ba
**Analysis:** "Simultaneously arising" — a key Dzogchen technical term distinguishing instantaneous recognition from gradual cultivation. The dharma meanings arise not sequentially but all-at-once (cig car).

[11003] <philology> Smra ba'i seng ge
**Analysis:** "Speech lion" (smra ba'i seng ge) — epithet indicating fearlessness and power in teaching. Derives from standard Mahayana epithets for the Buddha's speech.

[11014-11016] <concept>
Arising of Spontaneous Compassion
**Analysis:** "sngon na med pa'i snying rje yang / 'di la gting nas skye ba dang / de rjes sems can don la 'jug" — unprecedented compassion arising from depth, followed by engaging in beings' benefit. This indicates compassion not as cultivated quality but as spontaneous expression of realization.

[11020-11023] <concept>
Bodily Self-Sacrifice
**Analysis:** Ability to give body and limbs (lus dang yan lag gtong bar nus) and even to guru — represents the complete transcendence of self-grasping that characterizes advanced realization in Mahayana and Vajrayana frameworks.

[11026-11030] <structure>
Conclusion of Previous Section / Transition
**Analysis:** Line 11026 marks the conclusion of a tantric citation with *zhes so*. Lines 11027-11030 transition from scriptural quotation to autocommentary, explaining the signs (*rtags*) of Nirmanakaya (*sprul sku*) manifestation.

[11027-11028] <philology>
Technical Terminology: *Rdzus te skye ba*
**Analysis:** The phrase *rdzus te skye ba* (miraculous birth) denotes birth without womb-entry, one of the four modes of birth (*skye ba bzhi*). The instrumental *-s* in *rdzus te* marks manner of arising. The number *lo drug khri brgyad stong* (68,000 years) represents the Nirmanakaya's activity lifespan.

[11029] <philology> Particle Analysis: *Ka dag gis*
**Analysis:** *Ka dag gis* employs the instrumental particle *-s* to indicate agency/manner: "through primordial purity." The phrase *sa la 'da'o* indicates transcendence of the earth element.

[11030-11033] <concept>
Resolution of Apparent Contradiction
**Analysis:** Longchenpa addresses a potential contradiction: if the Nirmanakaya nature (*rang bzhin sprul pa*) remains for five hundred years (*lo brgya phrag lnga*), how can the activity span 68,000 years? The resolution distinguishes:
1. *Rang don bsgrub pa* (accomplishing one's own welfare): 500 years
2. *Gzhan don bsgrub pa* (accomplishing others' welfare): limitless
These are not contradictory but complementary modalities.

[11034-11056] <context>
Root Text Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** This verse citation from the *Sku gdung 'bar ba* (Blazing Relic Stupa) tantra presents the complete Nirmanakaya activity cycle:
- Lines 11035-11040: Birth in pure realm (*sprul sku'i zhing khams*)
- Lines 11041-11046: Multiplication of emanations (*sprul pa bye ba drug khri*)
- Lines 11047-11051: Reabsorption into essence (*ngo bo ka dag*)
- Lines 11052-11055: Similes of reabsorption (water into water, butter into butter, space into space)

[11047-11051] <concept>
The Reabsorption Process
**Analysis:** The reabsorption (*thim pa*) of emanations follows the pattern:
1. *Rang gi sprul par bcas pa ni* - one's own emanations together with
2. *Rang gi ngo bor rang thim nas* - self-reabsorb into one's own essence
3. *Dbyer med 'byed pa med par 'gyur* - become without division, without separation
This demonstrates the non-dual nature of manifestation and dissolution.

[11052-11055] <philology>
Simile Structure: *Ji ltar...de bzhin...*
**Analysis:** The *ji ltar...de bzhin* (just as...so...) comparative structure establishes analogical reasoning:
- *Chu la chu thim* - water dissolving into water
- *Mar la mar thim* - butter into butter
- *Nam mkha' nam mkha' thim pa* - space into space
The similes progressively move from tangible (water, butter) to intangible (space), mapping the dissolution hierarchy.

[11057-11074] <structure>
New Section: Inner Experience Signs (*Nang shes pa'i nyams*)
**Analysis:** Line 11057 initiates a new subsection analyzing internal meditative experiences. The citation from *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) tantra enumerates experiential signs of realization.

[11059-11074] <concept>
Fifteen Experiential Signs
**Analysis:** The text enumerates fifteen signs (*nyams*) of genuine realization:
1. *Bde ba dang ldan pa* - possessing bliss
2. *'Jig rten la zhen pa med pa* - without attachment to worldly existence
3. *Snang ba thams cad 'od du shar ba* - all appearances dawning as light
4. *'Od la sku'i tshom bu ma 'gags par mthong ba* - seeing unimpeded spheres of buddha-bodies in the light
5. *'Dzin pa med par lus bde ba* - physical bliss without grasping
6. *Shes pa rtse gcig tu gyur pa* - awareness becoming one-pointed
7. *Shes pa ngang gis dal ba* - awareness naturally spacious
8. *Shes pa ma yengs pa* - awareness undistracted
9. *Shes pa gzhan la mi 'jug pa* - awareness not entering into other [objects]
10. *Shes pa ci yang ma yin par rtogs pa* - realizing awareness is nothing whatsoever
11. *Shes pa mi 'gyur ba* - awareness unchanging
12. *Shes pa ma 'gags par gsal ba* - awareness clear without obstruction
13. *Shes pa mi rtog par 'chad pa* - awareness expressed as non-conceptual
14. *Shes pa 'dzin pa med par rang grol ba* - awareness self-liberated without grasping
15. *Phyi nang gi chos la 'dzin pa chung ba* - minimal grasping at external/internal phenomena

[11066-11067] <philology>
Particle Chain Analysis
**Analysis:** The repetition of *dang* (and) creates an enumerative chain. The genitive *gi* in *shes pa'i* establishes the relationship between awareness and its various modalities.

[11074] <philology> Citation Marker: *Zhes so*
**Analysis:** The formula *yin no zhes so* marks the conclusion of the *Rang shar* citation, confirming these fifteen signs as scriptural authority rather than Longchenpa's own composition.

[11075-11079] <structure>
New Major Division: Presentation of Rigpa
**Analysis:** Line 11075 initiates the fifth major division (*lnga pa*) on *rig pa* (awareness), structured as fivefold:
1. *Ngo bo* - essence/entity
2. *Nges tshig* - etymological definition
3. *Dbye ba* - divisions/classifications
4. *Mtshan nyid* - characteristics
5. *'Bras bu* - result

This follows the standard Tibetan scholastic presentation format (*sgrub mtha'*).

[11080-11084] <philology>
Terminology: *Rdo rje lu gu rgyud*
**Analysis:** The term *rdo rje lu gu rgyud* (vajra chain/cord) denotes the indestructible continuum of awareness. The citation from *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs* (Lion Perfection) establishes awareness as the basis (*gnas*) of wisdom (*ye shes*). The locative particle *du* marks sphere/location.

[11080-11083] <context>
Citation from *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs*
**Analysis:** This root text citation establishes *rig pa* as the ground (*gnas*) of primordial wisdom (*ye shes*), distinguishing Dzogchen view from Sutric and lower Tantric presentations where awareness may be identified with ordinary mind (*sems*).

[11085-11086] <philology>
Etymology: *Rig pa*
**Analysis:** The etymology (*nges tshig*) derives *rig pa* from the causative of *rig* (to know), with the instrumental *-s* in *rig pas* indicating agency. The phrase *sngar ma rig pa* (previously not knowing) contrasted with *rig pas* (having recognized) establishes the transformative moment through *bla ma'i gdams ngag* (guru's oral instruction).

[11087-11099] <structure>
Threefold Division of Rigpa
**Analysis:** The divisions (*dbye ba*) categorize rigpa into three types:
1. *Gzhi gnas kyi rig pa* (lines 11088) - abiding ground awareness
2. *Lam snang gi rig pa* (lines 11089-11096) - path-appearing awareness
3. *Lhag mthong gi rig pa* (lines 11097-11099) - superior seeing/vipasyana awareness

[11088] <concept> Ground Awareness (*Gzhi gnas kyi rig pa*)
**Analysis:** Ground awareness is defined as the actual mode of existence (*gnas lugs*) of phenomena beyond good (*dge*), bad (*sdig*), and defect (*skyon*). This transcends ethical dualism, indicating the view of primordial purity (*ka dag*) at the level of the basis.

[11089-11096] <concept>
Path-Appearing Awareness (*Lam snang gi rig pa*)
**Analysis:** Path awareness encompasses various terms from different philosophical systems (*grub mtha' so so*):
- *Sems nyid* - mind itself (common Mahayana)
- *Skye med* - unborn (Madhyamaka)
- *Lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes* - co-emergent wisdom (Anuttarayoga)
- *Blo 'das* - beyond intellect (Dzogchen)
- *Don gyi kun gzhi* - ultimate alaya (Yogacara refined)
- *Byang chub kyi sems* - bodhicitta

Despite varying nomenclature, all refer to *so so rang gi ye shes rang gsal stong pa rjen par sa le ba* - one's own self-aware, self-luminous, empty, naked, clear wisdom.

[11097-11099] <concept>
Superior Seeing Awareness (*Lhag mthong gi rig pa*)
**Analysis:** This represents vipasyana-level awareness characterized by:
- Direct vision (*mngon sum*) of the vajra-chain form (*sku*)
- Liberation from conceptual word-webs (*tshig gi ra ba*)
- Freedom from obscuration/clarity of virtue/vice
- Accomplishment of light-body (*'od lus*) and transparent body (*zang thal*) through unwavering contemplation

[11100-11101] <philology>
Characteristic Definition: *Mtshan nyid*
**Analysis:** The characteristic is defined as *rang gsal rjen par zang ma 'di ka* - this very self-luminous, naked, transparent [awareness]. The demonstrative *'di ka* (this one here) emphasizes immediacy.

[11102-11107] <concept>
Result: Distinctive Fruition
**Analysis:** The result (*'bras bu*) is liberation in primordial purity (*ka dag*) and transparency (*zang ma*). Longchenpa distinguishes:
- Common result: three kayas (*sku gsum*) as fruition
- Distinctive result (*khyad par che*): here, the path transforms into the Great Primordially Pure Liberation (*ka dag mtha' grol chen po*), a "men shell-like" (*men shel*) fruition without fixation on body or wisdom.

[11108-11124] <context>
Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** Lines 11109-11124 cite the *Sku gdung 'bar ba* tantra, presenting signs (*rtags*) of ripened rigpa:
- Ability to direct self-knowing (*rang shes*) toward any object
- Body following awareness (*lus kyang de yi rjes su*)
- Capacity to transform others' faith (*gzhan gyi dad pa sgyur nus*)
- Self-cessation of conceptual attachment (*bsam rgyun zhen pa rang 'gags*)
- Direct recognition (*mngon sum nyid du sus rig pa*)

[11109-11111] <philology>
Relative Clause Structure
**Analysis:** The construction *rig pa la ni sus goms pa* (those who have familiarized with rigpa) employs the locative *la* to mark the object of familiarization (*goms pa*), with *sus* (by whom) as agent.

[11125-11135] <context>
Citation from *Thal 'gyur* (Consequence) Tantra
**Analysis:** This section cites the *Thal 'gyur* tantra, presenting the marks (*rtags*) and measures (*tshad*) of meditative practice. The verse enumerates six external signs:
1. *Lus ni yang zhing zang thal snang* - body appearing light and transparent
2. *Sa la reg med thogs med* - without touching earth, without obstruction
3. *Ngag gi nus rdzogs gtam zungs zad* - speech power complete, eloquence exhausted (beyond words)
4. *Sems ni 'pho bar nus pa* - mind able to transfer [consciousness]
5. *Mig dang rnam pa sna dang lce* - eye, form, nose, tongue
6. *Lus kyi dbang po kun zad* - all body senses ceased
7. *Rang bzhin med par gyur pa tshad* - measure of becoming without nature

[11125-11127] <structure>
Transition to Signs and Measures
**Analysis:** Following the presentation of rigpa's essence, divisions, and characteristics, Longchenpa now addresses the signs (*rtags*) and measures (*tshad*) of meditative accomplishment.

[11128-11135] <philology>
Parallel Structure Analysis
**Analysis:** The verse employs *dang* conjunction to link the six signs. The genitive particles (*gi, kyi*) mark possession and agency throughout.

[11136-11139] <structure>
Threefold Analysis of Signs
**Analysis:** Line 11136 introduces the third major section (*gsum pa*) analyzing signs through three divisions:
1. *Skye med thob pa'i rtags spyir bstan* - general presentation of unborn attainment signs
2. *Yon tan gyi rtags bye brag tu bshad* - specific explanation of qualities' signs
3. *Rtags gsum 'dres pa'i khyad par so sor brjod pa* - distinct articulation of three-sign combination

[11140-11143] <concept>
Signs of Unborn Attainment
**Analysis:** The yogin established in confidence (*gdeng du tshud pa*) in the realization of primordial purity (*ka dag gi rtogs pa*) exhibits two signs of not taking rebirth in samsara:
1. *Lus la srog chags med pa* - no living creatures on the body
2. *Skra dang sen mo mi skye ba* - hair and nails not growing

[11143-11161] <context>
Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** The citation describes the three-month (*zla ba gsum*) process at death:
- Visible to others in the expanse of five lights (*'od lnga'i dkyil*)
- Arising as the five-family form (*rigs lnga'i sku*) in space
- Rising and dissolving (*'phags te yal ba*) into the sky

[11143] <philology> Temporal Particle: *De nas*
**Analysis:** *De nas* (from that/then) establishes temporal sequence following the two preliminary signs.

[11148-11161] <concept>
The Dissolution Process
**Analysis:** The verse presents the complete liberation process:
- Line 11148: Possessing these marks indicates sharing the same fortune (*skal pa mnyam pa*) as the teacher
- Lines 11150-11151: Cessation of birth continuum (*skye ba'i rgyun chad*), absence of insects on body
- Lines 11152-11153: Hair and nails not growing, continuum ended
- Lines 11156-11160: After three months, elements dissolve (*'byung ba rang sar dengs*), contaminated aggregates (*zag bcas phung po*) become invisible, one's body with families rises into light's expanse

[11162] <philology> Superlative Designation: *Skal chen*
**Analysis:** *Skal chen* (great fortune) designates the yogin of dissolution time (*zad pa'i dus*) with exceptional capacity.

[11163-11167] <structure>
Second Division: Praise of Qualities
**Analysis:** Line 11163 initiates the second division praising qualities (*yon tan*), distinguishing:
- *Snang ba lus ngag gi yon tan* - qualities of apparent body and speech
- *Med pa rig pa stong pa'i yon tan* - qualities of empty awareness's unapparent [aspect]

[11166-11167] <concept>
Enjoyment of Pure Realms
**Analysis:** The measureless qualities involve enjoying peaceful and wrathful mandalas (*zhi khro gnyis kyi dkyil 'khor*) in the self-appearing buddha-field (*rang snang sangs rgyas kyi zhing*), along with dharmakaya qualities.

[11163] <philology> Demonstrative Particle: *De'i*
**Analysis:** *De'i* (of that) refers back to the yogin established in the signs, linking the qualities section to the previous discussion.

[11168-11181] <context>
Citation from Tantric Source
**Analysis:** Lines 11169-11180 present a verse citation describing the qualities of the realized person (*rtogs pa'i skyes bu*). The citation emphasizes:
- Inconceivable qualities beyond existence and non-existence (*yod med yon tan bsam mi khyab*)
- Self-illuminating wisdom dwelling as unity (*gcig par gnas pa'i ye shes*)
- Self-displaying great display without arrangement (*ma bkod ye gdangs*)
- Natural presence of method and wisdom (*thabs dang shes rab rang bzhin las*)
- Two buddha-families appearing (*sangs rgyas rigs kyang gnyis su snang*)
- All appearing as retinue (*'di kun de yi 'khor du snang*)
- Appearance from base-appearance without nature (*gzhi snang rang bzhin med pa las*)
- Inexpressible dharma beyond thought and speech (*smra bsam brjod med chos*)
- Three times equally self-abiding from the beginning (*dus gsum mnyam pa nyid...ye nas...rang gnas*)

[11168] <philology> Citation Marker: *De nyid las*
**Analysis:** *De nyid las* (from that very [source]) indicates continuation from the same tantric source as the previous citation.
