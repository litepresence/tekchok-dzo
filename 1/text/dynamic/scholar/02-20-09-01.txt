## Practice Chamber Preparation

**Four Aspects:**
1. Directional determination (phyogs phyed pa): Orientation of practice space
2. Solar apertures (nyi ma'i zer): Sunbeams entering through openings
3. Pure crystal preparation (shel dkar dri ma med): Clear medium for light
4. Mirror blessing (me long byin rlabs): Consecration of reflecting surface

**Citation:** From the Tantra of Clear Introduction (mNgon par bshad pa'i rgyud).
