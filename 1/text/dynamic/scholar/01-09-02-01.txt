Spontaneous Presence (lhun grub)

**Spontaneous Presence Definition:**
Spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*): naturally perfect, not accomplished by effort.

From *Rang shar*:
"Spontaneous presence thus
Naturally perfect
Not accomplished effort
Spontaneous thus"

**Three Spontaneous Presences:**
1. **Essence spontaneously present** (*ngo bo lhun grub*): self-arisen wisdom
2. **Nature spontaneously present** (*rang bzhin lhun grub*): five lights
3. **Compassion spontaneously present** (*thugs rje lhun grub*): five Buddha families

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Three spontaneous presences
Essence, nature, compassion
Threefold presence
Complete thus"

**Relation to Primordial Purity:**
Primordial purity: essence aspect.
Spontaneous presence: nature aspect.
Two aspects one ground—inseparable.

"Primordial purity essence
Spontaneous presence nature

Transition to Symbolic Presentation: The Narrative of Vajrasattva's Delusion
Longchenpa establishes symbolic coordinates of Vajrasattva's delusion narrative: (1) gzhi las gzhi snang du shar (basis-appearances arise from basis), (2) gzhi snang du shar dus ma rig pa gsum (three non-recognitions at appearance-arising), (3) rkyen bzhis (four conditions).

The symbolic narrative encodes: location = basis, place = manifestation, time = non-recognition, companions = conditions. The key insight: 'khrul gzhi med pa (without delusion-basis) - delusion has no actual basis.

Five Spontaneous Presences

1. Spontaneously present essence: not created
2. Spontaneously present nature: self-clear
3. Spontaneously present compassion: self-manifesting
4. Spontaneously present qualities: complete
5. Spontaneously present activities: effortless

Spontaneous presence is not created by causes, not dependent on conditions, naturally arisen and complete. Self-perfected means complete in itself, not achieved through effort or practice.
