**Spontaneous Fruition: Three Kayas Defined:** Lines 16436-16533 present the twenty-third section (rim khang nyi shu rtsa gsum pa) on spontaneous accomplishment of fruition ('bras bu lhun grub). **Threefold structure:** (1) Dharmakaya (*chos sku*) essence—free from elaboration extremes, beyond perceived objects, unchanging; (2) Dharmakaya as all-pervading ground-purity—sentient beings are buddhas with adventitious defilements; (3) Dharmakaya from various vehicles' perspectives as wisdom, emptiness, qualities. **Five characteristics each:** Each kaya has five defining features: field (*zhing khams*), place (*gnas*), samadhi, retinue (*'khor*), teaching (*bstan pa*), and timelessness (*dus*).

**Essence terminology:** *Spros pa'i mtha' dang bral ba*—free from elaboration extremes (eight extremes). *Dngos po ngos gzung las 'das pa*—beyond perceived objects/entity fixation. *Skye 'jig 'pho 'gyur med pa*—without birth, destruction, transference, change. *Mthar thug mngon du gyur pa*—ultimate direct manifestation. *Chos nyid bsam gyis mi khyab pa*—dharma nature inconceivable. **Buddha-nature citations:** *He badzra* (Hevajra Tantra) 16442-16446: "Sentient beings are buddhas, obscured by adventitious defilements; when removed, buddhahood." *Rgyud bla ma* (Uttaratantra) 16447-16452: "Perfected Buddha-body emanates, suchness without distinction, possessing gotra—all sentient beings always have buddha-nature." **Thalgyur citation** 16517-16532: Five aspects—body, speech, mind, qualities, activities—each with three characteristics.

**Dzogchen Fruition Theory:** This section represents the culmination (*mthar thug*) of the Treasury—the spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) of enlightenment not achieved but recognized. **Sutra sources:** *Uttaratantra* (Ratnagotravibhāga) buddha-nature theory; *Prajñāpāramitā* emptiness; *Abhisamayālaṃkāra* quality enumerations. **Tantra sources:** *Hevajra* buddha-nature verses; *Rin po che spungs pa* (Ratnaketu) citation 16478-16509 on Dharmakaya's unlocatable nature; *Thal 'gyur* spontaneous presence teachings. **Nyingma distinctiveness:** Unlike Sarma gradual path to three kayas, Dzogchen presents three kayas as primordially complete (*ka nas rdzogs pa*) to be recognized.

[16436-16533] <concept>
**Dharmakaya Ontology:** Not "a" body but body-ness itself—emptiness (*stong pa*), clarity (*gsal ba*), without marks (*mtshan ma med pa*). **Spontaneous presence:** *Lhun grub* = not made, not achieved, naturally present. **Adventitious defilement model:** Defilements (*dri ma*) are temporary (*glo bur*)—like clouds obscuring sun; sun (buddha-nature) always present. **Five aspects as unity:** Body-speech-mind-qualities-activities are ultimately indivisible—distinguishable for pedagogical purposes but one in essence. **Pure land cosmology:** Each kaya has corresponding field: Dharmakaya = dharma nature itself; Sambhogakaya = quality-fields (*yon tan zhing*); Nirmanakaya = display-fields (*sprul pa'i zhing*).

[16533-16650] <structure>
**Sambhogakaya Elaboration:** Lines 16533+ present detailed Sambhogakaya (*longs spyod rdzogs sku*) exposition through essence (*ngo bo*), definitive terminology (*nges tshig*), divisions (*dbye ba*), characteristics (*mtshan nyid*), and five certainties (*nges pa lnga*). **Structure:** Follows classical *sa bcad* (topical outline) pattern—each aspect systematically delineated. **Five certainties:** Certain place (*gnas nges*), teacher (*ston pa nges*), retinue (*'khor nges*), teaching (*chos nges*), time (*dus nges*). **Five-buddha mandala:** Akshobhya (center), Amitabha (west), Ratnasambhava (south), Amoghasiddhi (north), Vairocana (aggregate of all).

[16533-16650] <philology>
**Sambhogakaya terminology:** *Longs spyod rdzogs pa*—complete enjoyment, consumption of inexhaustible qualities. *Nges pa lnga*—five certainties distinguishing Sambhogakaya from Nirmanakaya's uncertainty. *Zhing khams*—buddha-field (*buddhakṣetra*). **Buddha names:** *Mi bskyod pa* (Akshobhya—Unshakable); *Snang ba mtha' yas* (Amitabha—Infinite Light); *Rin chen 'byung ldan* (Ratnasambhava—Jewel Source); *Don yod grub pa* (Amoghasiddhi—Meaningful Accomplishment); *Rnam par snang mdzad* (Vairocana—Universal Illumination). **Key terms:** *Rigs* (family/gotra); *Yon tan* (qualities); *Gnas* (abode/field); 'Khor (retinue/assembly).

[16533-16650] <context>
**Abhisamayālaṃkāra Framework:** Five certainties derive from Maitreya's *Abhisamayālaṃkāra*—defining Sambhogakaya as pure land body for advanced bodhisattvas (10th ground). **Tantric pure lands:** Each family has specific pure land: Akshobhya (Abhirati), Amitabha (Sukhavati), etc. **Nyingma integration:** Sambhogakaya as spontaneous display of Dharmakaya's qualities—not separate from Dharmakaya but its luminous aspect. **Historical development:** Pure land cosmology developed in India (*Sukhāvatīvyūha* sūtras), elaborated in Tibet with maṇḍala architecture. **Doxographical position:** Sarma emphasizes Sambhogakaya as attainment (10th bhumi); Nyingma emphasizes as always-present ground-display.

[16533-16650] <concept>
**Sambhogakaya Phenomenology:** What does Sambhogakaya "experience"? (1) **Bliss** (*bde ba*)—not ordinary pleasure but *chos sku'i bde ba* (Dharmakaya bliss); (2) **Clarity** (*gsal ba*)—perfect manifestation; (3) **Non-thought** (*mi rtog pa*)—beyond concepts; (4) **Inexhaustible qualities** (*yon tan mi zad pa*)—continuous display; (5) **Continuous teaching** (*chos 'chad mi 'gag pa*)—spontaneous Dharma. **Five certainties significance:** Unlike Nirmanakaya which adapts to disciples, Sambhogakaya is "always-on"—always displaying, always teaching, always present for those with capacity to perceive. **Dzogchen view:** Sambhogakaya = *longs sku* = *rgod pa* (display aspect) of *ka dag* (primordial purity).

[16650-16718] <structure>
**Nirmanakaya and Five Activities:** Lines 16650-16718 present Nirmanakaya (*sprul sku*) and four enlightened activities (*phrin las bzhi*). **Nirmanakaya characteristics:** Appearing without determination (*nges pa dang bral ba*)—adapts to disciples' needs; manifesting in six migrations (*'gro drug*) as appropriate forms. **Four activities:** Pacifying (*zhi ba*), Increasing (*rgyas pa*), Magnetizing (*dbang*), Wrathful (*drag po*). **Activity mechanics:** Knowing disciples' dispositions (*gdul bya'i khams shes*) and latencies (*bag la nyal*), accomplishing benefit without effort—like moon in water reflection. **Spontaneity:** Activities continue until samsara emptied (*'khor ba ma stongs kyi bar*).

[16650-16718] <philology>
**Nirmanakaya terminology:** *Sprul pa*—emanation/projection (Skt. *nirmāṇa*). *Nges pa dang bral ba*—free from determination/fixation. *'Gro drug*—six migrations (god, demigod, human, animal, hungry ghost, hell). *Phrin las bzhi*—four activities (Skt. *caturkarman*): *Śānti* (pacifying), *Pauṣṭika* (increasing), *Vaśīkaraṇa* (magnetizing), *Raudra* (wrathful). **Activity terms:** *Zhi ba*—pacifying obstacles, illness; *Rgyas pa*—increasing lifespan, merit; *Dbang*—magnetizing, bringing under influence; *Drag po*—wrathful, subduing. **Simile:** *Zla gzugs chu nang du ston pa lta bu*—like showing moon in water—appears without inherent existence, depends on conditions.

[16650-16718] <context>
**Karma Theory Integration:** Four activities integrate with karma theory—transforming ordinary action into enlightened activity. **Scriptural sources:** *Rig pa rang shar* citation on four activities; *Mngon rtogs rgyan* (Abhisamayālaṃkāra) activity continuity; *Rgyud bla ma* effortless engagement. **Tantric ritual:** Four activities basis for tantric sādhana—visualizations, mantras, mudras for each. **Nyingma distinctiveness:** Activities are *lhun grub*—not "done by" Buddha but spontaneous expression of awareness. **Comparison with Sarma:** Sarma emphasizes deliberate activity through practice; Nyingma emphasizes recognition that activity is already spontaneous.

[16650-16718] <concept>
**Activity Ontology:** How do enlightened activities work? **Moon-in-water simile:** (1) Moon = Buddha's compassion (ever-present); (2) Water = disciples' receptivity (must be clear/calm); (3) Reflection = activity (appears when conditions meet); (4) No reflection inherent in moon or water—dependent arising. **Effortlessness:** No deliberate "doing"—like sun shining, river flowing, mirror reflecting. **Four activity functions:** Pacifying = removing obstacles; Increasing = developing qualities; Magnetizing = gathering beings; Wrathful = destroying ego/fixation. **Dzogchen integration:** Activities = *thugs rje* (compassion) aspect of mind—unceasing, adaptive, spontaneous. Recognition = participation in enlightened activity without trying.
