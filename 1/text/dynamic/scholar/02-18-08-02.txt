Multiple Tantric Sources
**Philological analysis:** The section integrates sources from various classes:
- *Atiyoga* (*Yi ge med pa*, *Thal 'gyur*): Highest yoga
- *Yoga tantra* (*Sgyu 'phrul drva ba*): Illusion Net
- *Sutra* (*Rin po che brtsegs pa*): Ratnakuta collection

This reflects Longchenpa's encyclopedic approach, integrating sources across the *nine vehicles* (*theg pa dgu*). The voice alternates between citation and commentary, with *zhes so* marking quotations and *zhes bya* marking definitional statements.

Vision Characteristics and Practice Methods
**Investigation:** The section presents the characteristics (*mtshan nyid*) of dharmata direct perception vision:

1. From *Thal 'gyur* (5013-5017):
   - Exits certainly from sense-power gate
   - Clear in cloudless sky

2. From other sources (5018-5033):
   - Channels and delusion-mandala: Five wisdoms seen as bubbles
   - *Rang shar*: Five wisdoms, light body, clear in hanging-cord
   - *Seng ge rtsal rdzogs*: Self-vision rigpa entity abides as wisdom hanging-cord
   - *Nor bu 'phra bkod*: Perfect buddha rigpa lu gu rgyud body fully clear

The practice method at 5034-5037 presents a graduated approach:
1. First: Short sessions, many repetitions
2. Second: Extend sessions, prolong duration
3. Third: Day-night without distinction, placed in dhatu-fence, unmoving

This mirrors the standard *bsgom rim* (meditation stages) but adapted to Dzogchen's direct approach.

Result and Liberation Dynamics
**Consideration:** The section presents the result (*'bras bu*) of dharmata direct perception practice. The structure:
1. Citation from *Sgron ma 'bar ba* (5038-5042): Dhatu makes awareness's field; vajra is hanging-cord
2. Detailed result description (5043-5062): Multi-level dissolution process
3. Concluding citation from *Thal 'gyur* (5050-5062): Direct seeing-knowing-realizing-liberating

The phrase *rang bzhin gyis gnas* (5048) indicates natural abiding, the *prakrti-stha* concept of innate liberation.

<philology>
Dissolution Terminology and Liberation Mechanics
**Investigation:** The result description uses a cascade of dissolutions:
- Outer dhatu-vision, eye unmoving → inner awareness abides in base (*gzhis*)
- Resonance self-dissolves from self → circle separates (*'khor nas*)
- Lung wind horse separates (*bral ba*)
- Wisdom sky dissolves into dhatu sky
- Equal limitless liberation

The term *thim* (dissolve) appears multiple times (5045, 5047, 5057), marking the progressive deepening of realization. The negative determinations at 5055-5058 establish the *apophatic* nature of liberation: not untying (*bkrol ba ma yin*), nature aimless (*rang bzhin dmigs med*), partless (*cha shas med*).

Scriptural Authority and Terminological Integration
**Close Reading:** The citation from *Sgron ma 'bar ba* (Blazing Lamp) at 5038-5042 establishes the technical terms:
- Dhatu (*dbyings*): Makes awareness's self-field (*rang yul*)
- Vajra (*rdo rje*): Is hanging-cord (*lu gu rgyud*)
- Placement (*gzhag pa*): Inside this (*'di nang du*)

The *Thal 'gyur* citation at 5050-5062 presents the progressive epistemic structure:
- Seeing (*mthong ba*) → Knowing (*shes pa*) → Realizing (*rtogs pa*) → Liberation (*grol ba*)

This reflects the *pratyaksa-parijna* (direct perception-complete knowledge) to *vimukti* (liberation) progression in Buddhist soteriology.

Increasing Experience Vision
**Technical Examination:** The section transitions to the second vision (*snang ba gnyis pa*): experience increasing above (*nyams gong 'phel*). The structure:
1. Brief indication (5065-5068): Purifying dhatu-awareness above-above
2. Extensive explanation (5069-5079): Two types of experience

The experience analysis distinguishes:
- **Knowing experience** (*shes nyams*): Worldly, from concentration (*ting nge 'dzin*), pleasure-bliss-mind-attachment, singing-dancing
- **Vision experience** (*snang nyams*): To be discussed subsequently

The term *gong nas gong* (above from above) at 5065 indicates progressive intensification. The *Thal 'gyur* citation at 5069-5075 presents the characteristics:
- Wisdom color emerges outward
- Up-standing (*gyen 'greng*) and wing-dawning (*rtsibs shar*)
- Various thig-le in body itself
- Clear in coarse vision field

This establishes the second vision as intensification of the first, not qualitatively different in essence but quantitatively greater in manifestation.
