. Signs of liberation and confusion in the intermediate state and future life, concluding through secret sealing.

<architectural-analysis>
The section opens with a threefold division of signs indicating previous training in body, speech, and mind (sku gsung thugs). This represents a systematic taxonomy of karmic resonance patterns—physical and energetic markers that indicate latent spiritual accomplishments from previous lives carried forward through the bar do (intermediate state). The structure follows the classic Nyingma presentation of signs (rtags) as diagnostic instruments for assessing practitioner capacity and predicting liberation trajectories.

<linguistic-analysis>
Key terminological distinctions in this section center on the semantic field of "signs" (rtags) and "training" (sbyangs). The term sbyangs pa (trained/habituated) carries the sense of cultivated refinement through repeated engagement, distinct from goms pa (familiarized/accomplished). The citation from Dpal nam mkha' med pa sku gdung 'bar ba chen po'i rgyud (Glorious Infinite Space Blazing Relics Tantra) establishes scriptural authority through the technical citation marker ces so, indicating verbatim quotation. The enumeration of signs proceeds through specific anatomical locations—dpral ba'i dkyil (forehead center), mgrin pa (throat), snying ga (heart)—mapped onto the three vajra gates (rdo rje sgo gsum). The descriptive vocabulary includes g.yas su 'khyil pa (clockwise swirling), rtse gsum (trident), and rang 'bur (self-protruding), indicating spontaneously arising marks rather than artificial imprints.

<historical-context>
This section operates within the broader Indo-Tibetan discourse on laksana (marks) and anuvyanjana (secondary characteristics), yet transforms these concepts through the Dzogchen lens of spontaneous presence (lhun grub). The enumeration of body signs—conch shell spirals, trident creases, syllable marks—parallels the classical Buddhist system of the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks of a Mahapurusa, yet here applies to all sentient beings as indicators of previous practice rather than exclusive Buddha-qualities. The doctrinal framework draws from the sku gdung 'bar ba (Blazing Relics) tantra cycle, a text associated with Atiyoga revelations that emphasize direct recognition of enlightened qualities in ordinary embodiment. The inclusivity of the system—extending even to "butchers, prostitutes, unfortunate ones" (shan pa smad 'tshong skal med)—demonstrates the Dzogchen emphasis on universal buddha-nature transcending conventional moral categories.

<concept>
The philosophical architecture here rests on the principle of karmic latency—virtuous imprints (dge ba'i bag chags) from previous practice that manifest as somatic and energetic signatures in the present life. The threefold schema of body, speech, and mind signs maps onto the Trikaya doctrine: body signs indicate Dharmakaya realization, speech signs indicate Sambhogakaya communication capacity, and mind signs indicate Nirmanakaya compassionate activity. The temporal calculus—liberation in two lives through body training, two lives through speech, three through mind—reflects a graduated soteriology where different faculties ripen at different rates. Most significantly, the text establishes that these signs exist naturally (rang bzhin gyis) in all beings from the ground (gzhi nas), yet require previous habituation (sngon du goms pa) to become manifest—articulating the Dzogchen synthesis of primordial presence and developmental path.

<structural-mapping>
The sequence of signs section presents a graduated exposition from forehead marks indicating body training through throat marks indicating speech training to heart marks indicating mind training. This somatic cartography demonstrates the energetic architecture of the subtle body.

<architectural-analysis>
The section on suitability of arising and results of habituation creates the causal mechanics linking recognition of signs to accelerated liberation timelines. The structural closure links back to the opening framing of three kayas training.

. Explanation of the rationale for signs arising and the results of cultivation.

<structural-mapping>
This subsection establishes the metaphysical foundation for sign-recognition: all beings inherently possess the three kayas of body, speech, and mind from the ground, with signs appearing through previous habituation. The structure presents a cause-condition-result sequence grounded in tantric authority.

<grammatical-examination>
The pivotal phrase gzhi nas sku gsung thugs yod pas (from the ground, the three kayas exist) employs the technical Dzogchen term gzhi (ground/basis) to indicate primordial buddha-nature rather than constructed attainment. The citation structure demonstrates intertextual weaving between root tantra and explanatory commentary. The phrase bar chod zhugs pa (entered interruption) indicates karmic obstacles that disrupted the continuity of practice between lives, causing the latency to remain dormant until conditions ripen in the present existence.

<doxographical-placement>
The doctrinal assertion that even negative karma bearers possess these latent signs indicates the radical egalitarianism of Dzogchen teachings, distinguishing them from gradualist approaches that restrict advanced practices to those with purified karma. The timeframe of "two lives" (tshe gnyis) or "three lives" (tshe gsum) for maturation indicates the Buddhist theory of karma where certain actions ripen in specific temporal frameworks. This integrates with the broader Nyingma presentation of "swift paths" (myur lam) that accelerate the typical three countless aeon bodhisattva trajectory.

<concept>
The epistemology of sign-recognition presented here challenges naive empiricism—these marks are not merely physical phenomena but indices of complex karmic and spiritual histories accessible only to those with appropriate meditative capacity. The concept of goms pa (habituation) carries technical weight: it indicates the transformation of consciousness through repeated cultivation until qualities become spontaneous (rang 'byung). The integration of Trikaya theory with somatic signs indicates the Dzogchen non-duality of ground and fruition—the marks indicate that the fruition is already present as the ground, awaiting recognition.

<architectural-analysis>
The section quotes extensively from the Blazing Relics Tantra to establish scriptural precedent for the correlation between specific physical marks and previous training in Buddha body, speech, and mind.

<structural-mapping>
The structural conclusion emphasizes the preciousness of uninterrupted practice, establishing the conditional nature of the predicted results and the necessity of sustained effort.

. Analysis of how signs manifest without guaranteed liberation if Dharma practice is not undertaken.

<architectural-analysis>
This section introduces a critical 

<linguistic-analysis>
The term bag chags snyags ring (long heavy habitual patterns) combines technical vocabulary from Abhidharma (bag chags = karmic imprints) with evocative language of weight and duration. The phrase 'phral gyi mi dge ba (present non-virtue) establishes the temporal tension between past virtue (signified by marks) and present action. The destination mapping—body sign possessors to form realm gods, speech sign possessers to Brahma class, mind sign possessers to titans—draws from cosmological systems in Abhidharmakosa and related texts.

<historical-context>
The warning against complacency reflects a pervasive theme in Vajrayana literature: siddhis and signs can become obstacles if they generate spiritual pride or substitute for genuine realization. The specification that sign-possessers may still fall into the form realm (gzugs khams), Brahma abodes (tshangs pa'i gnas), or titan realms (lha min) demonstrates nuanced understanding of karma where mixed virtuous and non-virtuous actions yield mixed results. This aligns with the Buddhist theory of upaklesa (derivative defilements) where spiritual attainments themselves can become subtle obscurations.

<concept>
The philosophical sophistication here addresses the "grace vs. effort" dialectic: signs represent the working of grace (past cultivation) but require present effort to complete the liberation trajectory. The concept of bar chad (interruption/obstacle) carries ontological weight—it represents not mere delay but a fundamental shift in the trajectory of consciousness-momentum. The text establishes that signs are necessary but not sufficient conditions for liberation; sufficient conditions require the conjunction of past virtue (rtags), present effort ('bad pa), and future continuity (bar chad med pa).

<structural-mapping>
The middle section presents the specific destinies associated with possessing signs in body, speech, or mind without completing the path—mapping positive karmic resonance onto higher realms without ultimate liberation.

<architectural-analysis>
The concluding synthesis reinforces the necessity of present Dharma practice, closing the loop opened in the initial 

. Signs of how speech habituated, with three aspects of manifestation.

<structural-mapping>
The section transitions to speech-related signs, maintaining the tripartite structure but now focusing on communicative and mnemonic capacities. The framework examines oracular power, doctrinal comprehension, and charismatic influence.

<grammatical-examination>
The terminology of speech signs emphasizes force (btsan pa) and stability ('gyur ba med pa)—qualities indicating that speech has been consecrated through mantra practice in previous lives. The phrase tshe gnyis na gsung gcig tu nges pa'i 'bras bu (in two lives obtaining one speech definite result) employs the technical term nges 'bras (definite result) to indicate irreversible attainment. The temporal specification nyi ma yi ni dus gcig la (in one time of the sun) indicates a single day, demonstrating extraordinary mnemonic and cognitive capacity.

<doxographical-placement>
The speech signs relate to the classical Buddhist concept of pratibhana (ready wit/spontaneous eloquence) and the four analytical knowledges (catuhpratisamvid), particularly the dharma-pratisamvid (knowledge of doctrines). The description of voice "like Brahma's melody" (tshangs pa'i dbyangs bzhin du) references the Buddhist cosmology where Brahma realms represent refined vocalization and harmonious communication. The capacity to understand "thousand verses" (tshigs su bcad pa stong) in a single day indicates mastery of the traditional Indian educational metric of memorization and comprehension.

<concept>
The phenomenology of speech here moves beyond mere communication to what might be termed "performative resonance"—speech that accomplishes results through its utterance rather than describing pre-existing states. This relates to the Vajrayana understanding of mantra (gsang sngags) as creative sound rather than referential language. The concept of oracular power—the capacity to speak truth that compels assent and shapes reality—shows the integration of Indian theories of sabda (sound) with Buddhist theories of vac (sacred speech). The emphasis on "without changing" ('gyur ba med pa) indicates speech aligned with dharmata, immutable truth beyond conventional discourse.

<architectural-analysis>
The core exposition details the three types of speech signs: oracular power, doctrinal comprehension, and communicative influence, each linked to previous training in Buddha body, speech, or mind.

<structural-mapping>
The conclusion synthesizes these capacities into a unified soteriological trajectory—two-life Buddhahood through comprehensive speech training.

. Signs of how mind trained, showing liberation in three lives through cultivation.

<structure>
The mind signs section presents three marks of previous mental training: spontaneous meditation arising, natural spaciousness of mind, and unimpeded perception. The structure mirrors the previous sections but with emphasis on non-conceptual cognition.

<philology>
The phrase ma bslabs sgom pa rang 'bab (unlearned meditation self-descending) presents a key Dzogchen technical term—meditation without deliberate construction or acquired technique. The term sems ni ngang gis dal ba rnyed (mind naturally obtains spaciousness) employs ngang gis (naturally/spontaneously) to indicate effortless presence. The compound snying 'dar (heart trembling/fear) in negative contexts contrasts with the fearless quality (jigs pa'i sems med) of genuine mind training.

<context>
The mind signs reflect the Mahayana and Dzogchen emphasis on non-conceptual wisdom (rnal ma'i ye shes) beyond ordinary cognition. The capacity to perceive unseen objects (sngar ma mthong ba'i yul mthong) and hear unheard Dharma (sngar ma thos pa'i chos thos) indicates activation of the divine eye (lha'i mig) and divine ear (lha'i rna ba), two of the six abhijnas (mngon shes). The hermit-like quality of "wandering mountains and forests" (ri dang nags tshal 'grim pa) reflects the archetype of the yogin-practitioner who seeks solitude to stabilize recognition.

<concept>
The epistemology here centers on "pristine awareness" (rig pa) as distinct from ordinary mind (sems). The spontaneous arising of meditative states without formal training reveals that the practitioner has already stabilized recognition in previous lives; the present life requires only minimal conditions for full reactivation. The concept of spaciousness (dal ba) carries both phenomenological and ontological dimensions—referring to the open, unconfined nature of awareness itself. The three-life liberation timeline reflects the Dzogchen teaching that mind realization ripens more slowly than body or speech because it requires complete transcendence of conceptual fixation.

<structure>
The middle section details the specific mind signs: spontaneous meditation, unimpeded perception, fearlessness, and solitary comportment.

<structure>
The conclusion emphasizes the conditional necessity of practice—recognition of signs must be accompanied by present effort to achieve predicted results.

. Synthesis of naturally existing signs clarified through previous life habituation.

<structure>
This section synthesizes the preceding analyses, establishing that signs exist naturally in all beings but become manifest through previous cultivation. The structure presents a resolution to the potential paradox between innate presence and developmental manifestation.

<philology>
The phrase rtags 'di dag rang bzhin gyis (these signs naturally) employs rang bzhin (nature/essence) to indicate innate qualities rather than constructed attributes. The temporal marker tshé 'da bar (when life ends) indicates the critical transition where present practice determines future trajectory. The term srid pa (existence/becoming) carries technical Abhidharma meaning as the twelfth link of dependent origination—the phase of rebirth.

<context>
The inclusivity of the sign-system—extending to birds, deer, dogs, horses—reflects the Buddhist doctrine of rebirth across six realms and the Dzogchen assertion that all sentient beings possess buddha-nature regardless of current form. The acknowledgment that signs appear even in animals who will take lower rebirth demonstrates non-attachment to signs as ultimate indicators—signs show past virtue but cannot override present karma without continued practice.

<concept>
The philosophical resolution presented here addresses the apparent contradiction between innate buddhahood and gradual cultivation: signs indicate that the ground (gzhi) always contains the qualities of the fruition ('bras bu), but the fruition requires specific conditions to become fully active. This reflects the Dzogchen understanding of the "path of manifestation" (snang lam) where primordial qualities become progressively evident without being created. The emphasis on "supreme truth Dharma" (bden pa dam pa'i chos) indicates that only engagement with ultimate reality—not conventional virtue—can secure liberation.

<structure>
The core exposition details how signs appearing in animals indicate previous training interrupted by negative karma, demonstrating the complex interplay of virtuous imprints and karmic obstacles.

<structure>
The conclusion emphasizes the primacy of present action over past signs, establishing the ultimately provisional nature of all markers without ongoing practice.

. General signs indicating present entry onto the path.

<structure>
The section transitions to general signs of path-entry, distinguishing between signs of confusion, uncertainty, and demon interruption. This tripartite diagnostic framework helps practitioners distinguish genuine progress from delusion.

<philology>
The term 'khrul pa rang gis rang gzings pa (confusion self-miring itself) employs the vivid image of sinking in quicksand to indicate self-generating delusion. The phrase nges pa med pa (without certainty) indicates the transitional state where pointing-out instructions have not yet fully taken effect. The technical term bdud kyi bar chod (demon interruption) refers specifically to mara obstacles on the path.

<context>
The fifty uncertain signs (nges pa med pa'i rtags lnga bcu) reflect detailed phenomenological observations drawn from meditation manuals (sgom yig) and oral instruction lineages (man ngag). The inclusion of dream signs (rmi lam) reflects the importance of dream yoga in Nyingma practice—dreams serve as diagnostic instruments for assessing mental purification. The specific mention of "borderland people" (yul mtha' khob kyi skye bo) may reference interactions with non-Buddhist practitioners or those from peripheral regions, indicating cosmopolitan awareness in the text's composition.

<concept>
The epistemology of signs here becomes more complex: signs can indicate genuine progress, temporary experiences (nyams), or obstacles. This requires sophisticated hermeneutical capacity to distinguish "genuine signs" (rtags yang dag) from "demonic imitation" (bdud kyi bslu ba). The concept of "uncertainty" (nges pa med pa) reflects the transitional phenomenology of the path—experiences arise but have not yet stabilized into irreversible recognition. The integration of dream phenomenology with waking experience reflects the Buddhist and Dzogchen understanding of consciousness continuity across states.

<structure>
The core exposition presents a fifty-item list of uncertain signs ranging from intellectual pride to unusual physiological phenomena, establishing the breadth of possible meditative experiences.

<structure>
The conclusion catalogs sixty-six dream signs, completing the diagnostic framework for assessing path entry.

. Signs of demonic interruption and methods for dispelling them.

<structure>
This critical section addresses obstacles that mimic genuine signs—demonic interruptions that can mislead practitioners into false confidence. The structure presents diagnostic criteria followed by remedial practices.

<philology>
The term bdud kyi byin rlabs (demonic blessing) presents an oxymoron—blessings that appear positive but originate from obstructing forces. The phrase chu'i dkyil 'khor (water mandala) indicates a specific ritual configuration for purification. The technical term mjing pa shing gi byang bu (chin tree stick) refers to a sixteen-finger-width wooden implement used in repelling rituals. The mantra syllable phat (phat) functions as a sonic weapon to destroy deluded perception.

<context>
The detailed ritual instructions for dispelling demonic obstacles reflect the practical orientation of Nyingma literature—diagnosis must be accompanied by remedy. The distinction between "flesh-eating dakinis" (sha za'i mkha' 'gro ma) and "wisdom-pure dakinis" (ye shes rnam par dag pa'i mkha' 'gro ma) reflects complex tantric doxography where dakinis can function as either obstacles or guides depending on the practitioner's capacity. The method of examination (brtags na) to reveal "second reflection" (gzugs brnyan gnyis pa) reflects optical and phenomenological analysis—genuine appearances have single clarity while deluded perceptions duplicate or distort.

<concept>
The philosophical sophistication here addresses the "shadow side" of spiritual development—the ego's capacity to co-opt genuine experiences into spiritual materialism. The concept of dga' brod kyi bdud (joyful demon) indicates that obstacles can manifest as positive experiences (pride in realization, attachment to meditative bliss) rather than obvious suffering. The remedy of meditating on emptiness like space (stong pa nyid nam mkha' ltar bsgom pa) reflects the ultimate antidote to all obstacles—direct recognition of emptiness transcends the duality of obstacle and liberation.

<structure>
The middle section details the specific signs of demonic interruption: transformation powers, light emissions, sound manifestations, and assembly gathering, followed by the water mandala ritual for dispelling them.

<structure>
The conclusion emphasizes critical discernment—recognizing that dakini transmission can be either genuine guidance or demonic deception depending on the practitioner's level of attachment.

. Methods for dakinis coming under one's power versus self coming under dakinis' power.

<structure>
This section presents a sophisticated analysis of power dynamics in spiritual transmission, distinguishing between mastering dakinis (indicating accomplished capacity) versus being mastered by them (indicating demonic capture).

<philology>
The term bdag gi dbang du (under one's power) indicates yogic mastery where external forces serve the practitioner's aims. The contrast with bdag mkha' 'gro ma'i dbang du gyur pa (self coming under dakinis' power) indicates loss of agency through attachment. The phrase las thams cad 'grub cing bya ba rdzogs pa (all karma accomplished and actions completed) represents the ideal of tantric accomplishment—unimpeded capacity to benefit beings.

<context>
The analysis of dakini transmission reflects the sophisticated power dynamics in tantric relationships—between teacher and student, between practitioner and wisdom deities. The warning that "wisdom-pure dakinis do not arise in the world" (ye shes rnam par dag pa'i mkha' 'gro ma 'jig rten du mi 'byung) but only "flesh-eating karma dakinis" (sha za las kyi mkha' 'gro ma) appear reflects a realistic assessment that most visionary experiences come from one's own projected karma rather than pure wisdom. This aligns with the Madhyamaka critique of reified perception and the Dzogchen emphasis on recognizing the nature of mind rather than fixating on visionary content.

<concept>
The philosophy here centers on non-attachment as the criterion of authenticity—genuine spiritual power arises from freedom from fixation, while demonic capture manifests as attachment even to supposedly sacred phenomena. The concept of "coming under power" (dbang du gyur pa) applies both positively (mastering obstacles) and negatively (being mastered by delusion), demonstrating the neutral nature of power itself—what matters is the direction of agency and the presence or absence of attachment. The ultimate teaching: signs and visions are provisional tools; fixation on them becomes the very obstacle they were meant to overcome.

<structure>
The core exposition explains the method for dakinis coming under one's power: non-attachment and non-reification of transmission givers.

<structure>
The conclusion warns against the near-arising demon of interruption through following transmission givers with attachment, completing the dialectical analysis.

. Uncommon supreme secret signs to manifest: general explanation of previous training in body, speech, and mind.

<structure>
The section transitions to "uncommon" (thun mong ma yin pa) signs—distinctive markers of advanced practice not shared with ordinary practitioners. The tripartite structure examines signs of the three kayas' opening and the four elements' sound meanings.

<philology>
The term sku gsum gi sna khrid pa (opening of the three kayas) employs sna khrid (nose-opening/awakening) metaphorically to indicate full activation of enlightened dimensions. The phrase 'byung bzhi sgra don (four elements' sound meaning) refers to the subtle vibrations of earth, water, fire, and air as communicative phenomena revealing the speech of all beings. The technical enumeration of six clairvoyances (mngon shes drug) includes classical Buddhist abilities—divine eye, divine ear, knowing others' minds, remembering past lives, knowledge of death and rebirth, and knowledge of the exhaustion of defilements.

<context>
The signs of mastery over the four elements—immunity to fire, inability to drown, unimpeded movement through space—reflect both classical Indian siddha attainments and the Dzogchen emphasis on transcending ordinary physical limitations through recognition of mind nature. The capacity to know the minds of visible and invisible beings (sems can snang ba dang mi snang ba) indicates activation of the third abhijna. These capacities serve as "measures of the path" (lam gyi tshad)—diagnostic instruments indicating progress without becoming objects of fixation.

<concept>
The philosophy here integrates classical Buddhist siddhi theory with Dzogchen's emphasis on recognition—these powers arise naturally as byproducts of realization rather than goals of practice. The concept of rigs drug (six classes of beings) as "own-nature dwelling place" (rang gi rang bzhin lo gnas) reflects the Dzogchen view that all beings exist naturally within the expanse of awareness, not as external entities to be known. The "cutting of birth continuum" (skye rgyun chod pa) indicates irreversible liberation from samsaric rebirth—the ultimate sign of successful practice.

<structure>
The middle section presents the measure of body, speech, and mind training through the enumeration of six clairvoyances and the recognition that six-class appearances are the natural dwelling place of awareness.

<structure>
The conclusion presents signs of separating samsara and transcendence—bodily detachment, cutting confused attachment, and the capacity to move through space and earth unimpeded.

. Particular explanation of direct clear light signs: view and meditation.

<structure>
This section addresses the "particular" (bye brag tu) signs of thod rgal (direct transcendence) practice—specific to the Dzogchen path of spontaneous luminosity. The structure distinguishes between view signs (liberation from extremes) and meditation signs (natural clarity).

<philology>
The phrase lta ba mtha' grol (view liberated from extremes) employs the technical Madhyamaka terminology of transcending the extremes of existence and non-existence, eternalism and nihilism. The term bsgom pa ngang dangs rang babs (meditation natural clarity self-descending) uses the distinctive Dzogchen vocabulary of thod rgal—spontaneous luminosity arising without deliberate cultivation. The phrase stong pas lus dang sems rgyas pa (emptiness body and mind expanded) indicates the Dzogchen phenomenology where recognition of emptiness manifests as expansive presence rather than void absence.

<context>
The signs of view mastery—moving in space, circling Jambudvipa instantly, melting solids through gaze—reflect the integration of emptiness realization with energetic capacity characteristic of advanced Dzogchen practice. The reference to mkha' 'gro (dakinis) in space indicates the visionary dimension of thod rgal where wisdom deities appear spontaneously in the expanse. These signs emerge from the Blazing Relics Tantra, establishing continuity between the sutra and tantra presentations of advanced signs.

<concept>
The epistemology here reflects the unique Dzogchen integration of emptiness (stong pa nyid) and luminosity ('od gsal)—not as sequential stages but as simultaneous dimensions of awareness. The "expansion" (rgyas pa) of body and mind in emptiness indicates that emptiness realization enhances rather than negates presence and capacity. The emphasis on "self-descending" (rang babs) meditation indicates that genuine meditative stability arises spontaneously from recognition rather than through forceful concentration. These signs represent the fruition of the path—where ground, path, and result are recognized as inseparable.

<structure>
The middle section details the specific view and meditation signs: spatial freedom, instantaneous movement, perceptual mastery, and visionary experience.

<structure>
The conclusion synthesizes these signs into markers of view habituation, establishing that these extraordinary capacities indicate successful stabilization of recognition.

. Signs of how mind manifests through training, showing liberation in three lives.

<structure>
The final comprehensive section returns to the three-life liberation framework, presenting mind signs through the categories of spontaneous meditation, unimpeded perception, and fearless comportment.

<philology>
The phrase ma bslabs sgom pa rang 'bab (unlearned meditation self-descending) echoes earlier usage, reinforcing the key Dzogchen principle of effortless practice. The term sems ni ngang gis dal ba (mind naturally spacious) employs ngang gis (naturally) to indicate the spontaneous quality of genuine recognition. The compound snying 'dar (heart trembling) appears in contrast to jigs pa'i sems med (fearless mind)—genuine realization produces fearlessness while partial experiences may produce anxiety.

<context>
The enumeration of mind signs—unlearned meditation, spontaneous Dharma appearance, perception of unseen objects, solitary wandering—reflects the archetypal dzogchenpa (great perfection practitioner) who has transcended formal structures while maintaining spontaneous discipline. The timeframe of three lives (tshe gsum) for mind liberation, contrasted with two lives for body and speech, reflects the Dzogchen understanding that subtle mind-realization requires more time to fully stabilize than grosser body and speech realizations.

<concept>
The philosophical synthesis here emphasizes the inseparability of sign and signified—these capacities are not external acquisitions but the natural expression of mind's inherent qualities when obscurations are removed. The concept of "without interruption" (bar ma chod pa) applies both to practice continuity and to the unobstructed flow of wisdom—the same term describing both method and result. The final emphasis on "no doubt" (the tshom med) establishes that genuine signs produce certainty rather than confusion—an epistemological criterion distinguishing authentic realization from deluded experience.

<structure>
The core exposition details the three categories of mind signs: spontaneous meditative stability, unimpeded perception and cognition, and solitary fearless comportment.

<structure>
The conclusion synthesizes the entire presentation, establishing the three-life liberation trajectory for those who recognize mind signs and practice without interruption.

. Final synthesis emphasizing the importance of present practice.

<structure>
The concluding lines return to the fundamental teaching: signs exist naturally in all beings from the beginning, but liberation depends on present effort and practice.

<philology>
The phrase rtags 'di dag rang bzhin gyis (these signs naturally) employing rang bzhin (nature/essence) to indicate innate qualities rather than constructed attributes. The term bden pa dam pa (supreme truth) distinguishes conventional practice from engagement with ultimate reality. The concluding particle ces so marks definitive closure.

<context>
The final synthesis encapsulates the entire chapter's teaching: signs are universal but recognition is rare; past cultivation creates potential but present effort determines fruition; all beings possess the basis for liberation but only practitioners actualize it. This reflects the Buddha's teaching in the Tathagatagarbha sutras—that all beings have buddha-nature but require cultivation to manifest it.

<concept>
The ultimate philosophical point: the ground (gzhi) and fruition ('bras bu) are not different substances but different modes of recognition. Signs indicate the presence of the ground; practice brings about the recognition of that presence as fruition. The distinction between "possessing signs" and "obtaining liberation" reflects the Buddhist distinction between potential and actualization, between buddha-nature as cause and buddhahood as result. The chapter concludes with practical urgency—supreme truth Dharma is "extremely important" (gal che'o) because it alone can transform the potential indicated by signs into the actuality of liberation.
