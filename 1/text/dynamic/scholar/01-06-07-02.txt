Empowerment Completion and Invisibility Terms
**Analysis:**

**Key Vocabulary:**

- *"Rtogs dka' ba'i gnas"* (realization-difficult points): 
  - *Rtogs* (realization) + *dka'* (difficult) + *gnas* (points)
  - Obscure teachings requiring direct transmission

- *"Shin tu gsang ba"* (extremely secret):
  - Highest classification of teachings
  - Beyond ordinary intellectual comprehension

- *"Mi mthong ba"* (not seeing): 
  - Invisibility
  - Advanced ritual capability

- *"Rten 'brel"* (dependent connection):
  - Ritual causality
  - The interdependence of practice and result

- *"Ril bu"* (pill):
  - Substance preparation
  - Ritual medicine

**Grammatical Analysis:**
- The particle "ni" marks completion
- "de dag gis dbang gsum pa'i rtogs dka' ba'i gnas bshad pa" = "by these, the difficult-to-realize points of third empowerment are explained"
- The emphatic "ste" marks elaboration

This completes the analysis of the empowerment system and its completion stage practices.
