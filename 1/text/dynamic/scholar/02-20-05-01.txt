. Lamp-pressing technique: thumb-and-finger method and dharmatā directly manifest.

<architectural-analysis>
This section presents the specific technique of lamp-pressing (sgron la gtub pa): sitting cross-legged, placing thumb-and-finger upon the red-clear, round light-appearance, pressing to produce visionary experience. The structure presents both the method and the definition of what arises from it.

<grammatical-examination>
The term sgron la gtub pa (lamp-pressing) refers to the physical technique of applying pressure near the eyes to stimulate the clear light-nerve. The compound dmar gsal (red-clear) describes the quality of light that appears—a vivid, luminous red. The phrase chos nyid mngon sum gyi snang ba (dharmatā directly manifest appearance) employs the technical vocabulary of direct perception (mngon sum) of ultimate reality (chos nyid).

<historical-context>
The specific technique described—thumb-and-finger pressing on red-clear round appearance—reflects the somatic technology of Thögal practice. The instruction to make sessions short with many repetitions reflects the traditional approach of brief, intense practice rather than extended periods that lead to distraction or dullness. The citation from the same source (Thal 'gyur) establishes that what arises from correct pressing is none other than dharmatā itself.

<concept>
The epistemology here suggests that physical manipulation can induce direct perception of ultimate reality—not because the technique creates reality, but because it removes obscurations that prevent recognition. The concept of "directly manifest appearance" (mngon sum snang ba) indicates that dharmatā is not merely a philosophical abstraction but a directly perceptible dimension of experience when conditions are right.

<structure>
The conclusion presents the definition: seeing appearance by pressing again is called dharmatā directly manifest appearance, supported by tantric citation.

. Entering clearly: the progressive stages of visionary appearance.

<structure>
This section presents the progressive stages (rim pa) of visionary appearance that arise from the lamp-pressing practice. The structure enumerates twenty-one stages ranging from initial subtle appearances (smoke, illusion, clouds) through elemental phenomena (fire sparks, sun, moon, stars, rainbow) to the five colors (white, yellow, red, green, blue) and finally bindus, stupas, and god-bodies.

<philology>
The term gsal ba (clear/bright) modifies each color to indicate luminous quality rather than ordinary pigment. The compound 'ja' tshon (rainbow colors) refers to the spectrum of light appearing in space. The phrase snang srid 'gro rigs sna tshogs (various sentient-being forms appearing) indicates the manifestation of diverse life forms as part of the visionary display. The term rlung lnga (five winds) refers to the elemental energies that support appearance.

<context>
The progressive stages reflect the systematic unfolding of thod rgal vision, from subtle initial signs to full manifestation of Buddha-fields. The sequence—smoke, illusion, clouds, fire sparks, sun, moon, stars, rainbow, five colors, net pattern, rays, bindus, stupas, god-bodies—represents the traditional taxonomy of signs indicating progress. The "five-wind arise-appearance" (rlung lnga 'char snang) indicates that these visions result from the purification and activation of the elemental energies in the body.

<context>
The enumeration of colors follows the standard sequence of the five wisdoms: white (mirror-like), yellow (equality), red (discriminating), green (action-accomplishing), blue (dharmadhātu). The appearance of bindus (spheres of light), stupas (reliquary monuments), and god-bodies indicates progressive refinement from abstract light phenomena to structured visionary forms.

<concept>
The phenomenology of progressive stages suggests that visionary experience follows a developmental trajectory: initial subtle signs indicate the awakening of dormant capacities, elemental phenomena indicate the harmonization of energies, colors indicate the activation of wisdom-qualities, and finally structured forms indicate the complete manifestation of the mandala. The concept of "entering clearly" (gsal du 'jug) indicates that the practitioner must engage with these appearances actively, not merely observe them passively.

<structure>
The conclusion presents the third aspect: the manner of appearance-arising from that, with citation on wisdom-expanding experience pervading all outer and inner clearly, expanding from above to above.
