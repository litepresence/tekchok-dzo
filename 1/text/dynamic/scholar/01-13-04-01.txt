# The Third Lamp: dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma
**Analysis:** Longchenpa inaugurates the third of the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*): The Lamp of the Completely Pure Sphere. The structural schema follows the established eleven-topic format:
1. ngo bo (essence)
2. nges tshig (definition)
3. dbye ba (classification)
4. rang bzhin (nature)
5. mtshan nyid (characteristic)
6. goms tshul (familiarization manner)
7. tshad (measure)
8. gnas (abode)
9. sgo (door)
10. dngos (actual)
11. mthun dpe (simile)

This architectural consistency reflects the *mdzod* genre's encyclopedic imperative toward systematic classification.

[16770-16773] <philology>
Technical terminology:
- *mthing ga* (blue): The base color (*khya ba chen po*) from which the five colors spread (*lnga ldan du mched*)
- *mu khyud* (rim): The circular perimeter of light
- *pad 'dab* (petals): Lotus-petal structures within the bindu
- *za 'og ber khyim* (house under a barrel): Technical simile for the enclosed, stable nature of this lamp's appearance
- *lu gu rgyud* (snake noose): The channel structure (*ra ba*) from which awareness shoots rays (*gzer 'debs*)

[16774-16783] <context>
Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The text quotes: "The lamps of completely-pure nature and sphere gather the essence of awareness / appear at the snake-noose fence / for one familiarized with this, that meaning itself / blue unchanging self-luminous / abides at the rim's fence / self-luminous appears as outer object / essence itself is unfabricated."

This establishes the third lamp as integrative—gathering (*sdud*) the scattered elements into the *lu gu rgyud* structure while maintaining the *ka dag* (primordial purity) character.

[16784-16797] <concept>
The visionary phenomenology:
The lamp manifests through progressive stages:
1. Initial gaze (*dang po*) to treasury-brow space (*mdzod spu'i thad*): sky-blue pervading light appears
2. Five colors emerge from within (*nang nas kha dog lnga 'char*)
3. Appear at eye corners (*mig zur gnyis*) like rainbow error (*'ja' ma nor*)

The citation from *mu tig phreng ba* (lines 16787-16796) provides scriptural authority: "Like sky-rainbow / pure afflictions stain exhausted / sphere vast expanse uncut / reality object completely-pure / from both objects arises / pervade great blue unchanging / appearance pure condition meet / becomes five colors."

**Summary:** Page 401 transitions from the second lamp (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*) to the third lamp (*dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma*), completing the twelve similes and initiating the eleven-topic structural analysis of the sphere lamp. The progression moves from bindu particle phenomenology to the expansive sphere (*dbyings*) as integrating ground.

[16798-16805] <philology>
Etymological analysis of *dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma*:
- *dbyings* (sphere/expanse): From *rig pa'i rang yul* (awareness's own object) and *snang ba'i 'char gzhi* (appearance's arising basis)
- *rnam par dag pa* (completely pure): Absence of stains (*dri ma med pa*) in appearing objects (*yul du snang ba*)
- *sgron ma* (lamp): From *lu gu rgyud go rar bzung nas snang rig gsal bar byed pa* (grasping at the snake-noose fence, making appearance-awareness clear)

The definition emphasizes the lamp's dual function: establishing the sphere as both the basis of awareness and the ground of appearance.

[16801-16817] <context>
Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"The sphere makes awareness's own object / Vajra itself is the snake-noose / This itself enters within / Self-essence free of conceptualization / Also at the inner sphere's fence / Not grasped, not abiding, by this manner / Without separation continuously appears / To appearing objects / Purity exhausts stain numbers / Lamp's vajra snake-noose / Sky itself is focused / Without nature causes appearance / Mind holds that meaning / Therefore is definition of nature / From primordial time abides without gathering-separation."

This verse establishes the ungraspable (*ma bzung*) yet continuously appearing (*rgyun du snang*) character of the sphere lamp.

[16818-16835] <concept>
Threefold classification (*dbye ba*) of the sphere lamp:
1. *gzhi la gnas pa'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Ground-abiding sphere lamp): Wisdom and light body spontaneously arising within the cit
2. *lam la snang ba'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma* (Path-appearance sphere lamp): Five-rim fence gathering the bindu's clarity at the lotus-petal bindu
3. 'bras bu yul la snang ba'i dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma (Fruition-object sphere lamp): Snake-noose holding with five-color net, half-net, under-barrel, etc.

This triad maps the same lamp across ground-path-fruition (*gzhi lam 'bras bu*) structure characteristic of Dzogchen presentation.

[16836-16849] <concept>
The nature (*rang bzhin*) as nonduality:
The nature is identified as the nonduality of primordial purity (*ka dag*) and spontaneous accomplishment (*lhun grub*). The citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (lines 16838-16849) describes:
- Nature appearance not ceasing
- Mind-entity and memory all exhausted
- Appearance self-pure in sphere
- Awareness without conceptualization
- Unmoving equal cognition
- All exhausted in the sphere
- Primordial conceptualization exhausted
- Nature completely-pure abides in sphere
- Expressing-appearance word-mind nondual
- Without outer-inner in sphere
- Abides in great ease

[16850-16862] <concept>
Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*) analysis:
The characteristic is defined as the equal purity (*zang ma*) of:
- Outer light sphere empty-luminous (*phyi 'od kyi dbyings stong gsal zang ma*)
- Self-awareness sphere primordially pure (*rang rig pa'i dbyings ka dag zang mar*)

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (lines 16854-16862) establishes this through the metaphor of unfabricated primordial purity (*ye nas ka dag chen por*).

[16863-16865] <structure>
# Familiarization Method Section
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the sixth topic (*goms tshul*): the method of familiarization. The procedure involves:
1. Separating samsara-nirvana boundary (*'khor 'das ru shan phye*)
2. Placing body-speech in natural state (*lus ngag rnal du phab*)
3. Introducing awareness in the sphere's fence directly (*dbyings kyi ra bar rig pa bcu*)
4. Continuous practice day-night (*nyin mtshan med par*)

Progressive stages of appearance:
- First: merely mirror-like light (*od me long tsam*)
- Then: portions (*dum bu*)
- Then: land-area extent (*yul gru tsam*)
- Then: sky-filling (*nam mkha' gang ba*)
- Finally: whatever appears arises as sphere's appearance, seeing kayas until exhaustion of appearances

Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (16872-16883) and *rang shar* (16884-16897) authenticate this progressive visionary unfolding.

---

**Summary:** Page 402 provides the definition, threefold classification, nature, characteristic, and familiarization method of the third lamp. The structural analysis reveals how Longchenpa maps the visionary experience through progressive stages from mirror-light to sky-filling appearances.
