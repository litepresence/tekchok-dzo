# The First Joy: Engaging Wisdom-Wind Activities
**Architectural Context:** This passage initiates the enumeration (*bsdus pa*) of the Four Joys (*dga' ba bzhi*), a classification of meditative experiences or stages within completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practice. The ordinal marker དང་པོ་ (dang po, "first") establishes this as the initial member of the sequential progression. The structure presents: (1) Joy classification (དགའ་བ་ dga' ba) + ordinal (དང་པོ་); (2) Activity description (སྤྱོད་ spyod) + object of engagement (འཕེན་པ་དང་སྡུད་པ་). The continuative particle སྟེ། (ste) signals the beginning of exposition and marks this as a transitional entry point into detailed explanation. This terse formulation functions as a structural marker or list entry within the larger discussion of the Four Convictions (*gtan la phab pa bzhi*), specifically addressing conviction regarding meditation results (*sgra mo rtags kyi gtan la phab pa*).

**Enumeration Logic:** The Four Joys form a progressive schema wherein each joy builds upon the previous, representing deepening levels of meditative absorption. The first joy establishes the foundational engagement with wind-energy that enables subsequent joys to arise.

<philology>
**Particle Analysis:** 
- དང་པོ་ (dang po): ordinal "first" functioning as enumerative marker
- སྟེ། (ste): continuative/emphatic particle marking the beginning of exposition
- འཇུག་པའི་ (jug pa'i): compound of འཇུག་པ (entering/penetration) + གི་ (gi, genitive) = "of entering" or "entry-wisdom"
- རླུང་གི་ (rlung gi): genitive "of wind" marking wind as the agent/possessor
- དང་ (dang): conjunctive "and" connecting འཕེན་པ་ and སྡུད་པ་
- ལ་ (la): dative particle marking the object of engagement

**Terminology Semantic Field:**
- འཇུག་པ་ ('jug pa): "entering, penetration, entry"—technical term for entry into the nature of mind, contrasted with mere observation from outside
- ཡེ་ཤེས་ (ye shes): "wisdom, pristine awareness"—direct non-conceptual cognition of emptiness, the gnostic aspect of enlightenment
- རླུང་ (rlung): "wind, breath, vital energy"—the subtle energy moving in the channels, basis for mind's manifestation
- འཕེན་པ་ ('phen pa): "propelling, projecting, sending forth"—the expansive function of wind-energy
- སྡུད་པ་ (sdud pa): "gathering, collecting, drawing in"—the contractive function of wind-energy

**Verb Analysis:** The verbs འཕེན་པ་ (propel) and སྡུད་པ་ (gather) represent complementary wind functions: expansion and contraction, dispersion and concentration. The verb སྤྱོད་ (spyod, "to engage in/conduct") appears without object marker, suggesting absolute or contemplative engagement—engagement itself as the practice rather than engagement with a specific object.

<context>
**Doxographical Placement:** The Four Joys (*dga' ba bzhi*) represent progressive stages of bliss in completion stage practice, correlated with the four empowerments and four levels of joy. This classification belongs to the *anuttarayogatantra* completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) system, specifically within the *ye shes kyi rnal 'byor* (wisdom yoga) division concerned with direct realization through wind-energy manipulation.

**Empowerment Correlation:** This first joy corresponds to:
- The first empowerment (vase empowerment / བུམ་པའི་སྡེ་ཁུལ་)
- The initial dissolution of coarse fixation
- The *dga' ba* (joy)—ordinary pleasure arising from wind manipulation

**Higher Joy Progression:**
- དང་པོ་དགའ་བ་ (first joy): ordinary joy from initial wind engagement
- བྱེ་མའི་དགའ་བ་ (second: supreme joy): intensified pleasure from deeper absorption
- ཁྱད་པའི་དགའ་བ་ (third: special joy): non-dual pleasure beyondordinariness
- ལྷུན་གྱིས་གྲུབ་པའི་དགའ་བ་ (fourth: spontaneously accomplished joy): natural, uncontrived pleasure

**Technical Practice:** The "propelling and gathering" (*'phen sdud*) refers to the wind exercises (*rlung gi rnal 'byor*) wherein the yogi projects the winds to the extremities (*'phen*) and draws them back to the central channel (*sdud*), thereby activating the wisdom of entering (*'jug pa'i ye shes*).

<concept>
**Philosophical Framework:** The Four Joys represent the *smin byed* (ripening) dimension of wind-energy practices. As the winds are propelled and gathered through the channels (*rtsa*), they stimulate the essence drops (*thig le*) producing progressive bliss-states. This system derives from the *Guhyasamāja* and related tantras where the four joys correspond to the four syllables of the *vajra* (�རྡོ་རྗེ་) or *a* (ཨཱཿ) seed syllable.

**Wisdom of Entering:** The "wisdom of entering" (*'jug pa'i ye shes*) is the first level of entry into the non-conceptual—cognitive clarity without fixation on appearances. This corresponds to the *rtog pa dang bcas pa'i dga' ba* (joy with conceptuality), where bliss is present but conceptual mind still operates. The practitioner experiences pleasure but maintains subtle engagement with the conceptual substrate.

**Energetic Basis:** The practice engages the *kun 'dar* (all-pervading wind) and the *gnyan khrod* (sustaining wind) in their projective and retractive functions:
- ཀུན་འདབ་ (kun 'dar): the all-pervading wind that circulates throughout the body
- གཉིད་འདོགས་ (gnyan khrod / gnas 'dzin): the sustaining or retaining wind that holds in place

This establishes the energetic basis for subsequent higher joys, where the winds are progressively stilled and the joys deepen into non-dual and spontaneously accomplished states.
