The First Appearance: Peaceful
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes the first of the four appearances (*snang ba bzhi*) within the Anuyoga/Dzogchen framework. The first appearance is peaceful (*zhi ba*), characterized by:

- **Basis:** Innate wisdom (*ye shes*) residing in the heart area (*snying ga*)
- **Expression:** Self-arising radiance (*rang shar*) manifesting as white light
- **Characteristics:** Soft, gentle, luminous - representing the pristine nature of awareness

**Section Placement:** This is the foundational appearance from which the other three develop. The progression from peaceful to more dynamic appearances mirrors the standard Dzogchen presentation of rigpa's self-manifestation.

**Key Terms:**
- *zhi ba* — peaceful/calm (not suppression but natural stillness)
- *ye shes* — primordial wisdom (distinct from ordinary consciousness)
- *rang shar* — self-arisen (not created but appearing naturally)

## Particle and Terminology Analysis

**Analysis:** Key grammatical elements:
- *na* (locative) — marks the location (*snying ga na* = in the heart)
- *lta bu* (like) — creates simile structure
- *dang* (and) — connects parallel terms
- *'i* (genitive) — marks possession (*ye she'i* = of wisdom)

**Terminological Precision:**
- *kun nas* — completely/totally (indicates full development)
- *rdzogs pa* — complete/accomplished
- *sku* — body/kaya (here refers to sambhogakaya)
- *ye* — primordial/eternal

The honorific *zhabs* indicates respect for the teachings.

The Second Appearance: Expansive
**Analysis:** The second appearance is expansive (*rgyas pa*), characterized by:

- **Development:** The initial white light expands into five-colored radiance
- **Characteristics:** Warm, luminous, all-pervading
- **Function:** This expansion represents the manifesting quality of awareness

The text presents this through the image of a great light expanding from the heart center, filling the entire universe with luminous presence. This corresponds to the *'od gsal* (clear light) manifestation.

**Key Distinction:** The first appearance is subtle (*phra ba*), the second is gross (*rag ma*) in comparison—but both are still wisdom expressions, not ordinary phenomena.

[1649-1662] <philology>
## The Five Colors Analysis

**Analysis:** The term *'od lnga* (five lights/colors) is critical:
- Blue (snya tshogs) - space element
- Yellow (ser po) - earth element  
- White (dkar po) - water element
- Red (dmar po) - fire element
- Green (ljang gu) - wind element

These are not ordinary colored light but wisdom manifestations (*ye she'i snang ba*). The Tibetan distinguishes between:
- *'od* — general light/radiance
- *'od gsal* — clear light specifically

The genitive construction *'od kyi* marks the relationship between light and its qualities.

[1663-1664] <structure>
The Third Appearance: Powerful Activity
**Analysis:** The third appearance represents powerful enlightened activity (*phrin las dbang*):

- **Location:** Right side of the body
- **Expression:** The sun and moon mandala appearing in the right channel
- **Function:** This represents the active expression of wisdom

This corresponds to the *nyi zla kha sbyor* (sun-moon union) practices in Anuyoga, where the subtle winds and energies are directed toward spiritual transformation.

[1663-1664] <philology>
## Mandala Terminology

**Analysis:** Longchenpa examines the technical terminology underlying the third appearance's power activity (*phrin las dbang*). The terms—mandala (*dkyil 'khor*), palace (*dngul khang*), lamp (*sgron ma*), and awareness (*rig pa*)—create a sophisticated symbolic framework for understanding how enlightened activity operates within the subtle body. The compound *rig pa dbyings kyi sgron ma* (awareness as lamp of the expanse) encapsulates the non-dual relationship between cognizing subject and spacious field of manifestation.

- *dkyil 'khor* — mandala (circle + surrounding)
- *dngul khang* — palace/temple (subtle body location)
- *sgron ma* — lamp (metaphor for realization)
- *rig pa* — awareness/recognition

The compound *rig pa dbyings kyi sgron ma* creates a rich metaphor: awareness as lamp illuminating the expanse.

Four Appearances Summary
**Analysis:** The text summarizes how the four appearances (*snang ba bzhi*) gather under power (*dbang du sdud*):
- Dharmata bardo pure appearances four gather under power
- Distant visibility manifest and light-clear two gather under power
- Expanse improvement and wisdom four connection gather under power
- Thigle measure-arrive and union cluster appearance gather under power
- Wisdom exhaustion and spontaneously-accomplish appearance gather under power

**Connection:** This section bridges the individual appearances to their integration—the gathering (*sdud*) indicates how they function together rather than separately.

Four Appearances Gathering Under Power
**Analysis:** The text explains how four appearances (*snang ba bzhi*) gather under the power activity (*dbang gi 'phrin las*):
- Dharmata bardo's four pure appearances gather under power
- Distant visibility manifest (*rgyang zhags kyi mngon sum*) and light-clear (*'od gsal*) gather under power
- Expanse improvement (*dbyings kyis gong 'phel*) and four wisdom connections gather under power
- Thigle measure-arrive (*thig le tshad phebs*) and union cluster appearance gather under power
- Wisdom exhaustion and spontaneously-accomplished appearance gather under power

**Doctrinal Context:** This "gathering under power" represents the integration of all appearances into unified practice, rather than experiencing them as separate events.

Power Mandala Citation
**Analysis:** From *rang shar*:
- "Enlightened-activity power mandala, self body-center mandala in" (*'phrin las dbang gi dkyil 'khor ni / rang gi dung khang dkyil 'khor na*)
- "Lamp aspects four clear" (*sgron ma rnam pa bzhi ru gsal*)
- "Rigpa expanse lamp by, kaya wisdom power gather" (*rig pa dbyings kyi sgron ma yis / sku dang ye shes dbang du sdud*)
- "Thigle empty lamp by, outer element power gather" (*thigle stong pa'i sgron ma yis / phyi yi 'byung ba dbang du sdud*)

**Citation Analysis:** The *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) tantra is a key Anuyoga text. Longchenpa's quotation demonstrates the textual basis for these practices.

[1671-1679] <context>
Rang Shar Citation on Power Mandala
**Analysis:** From *rang shar*:
- "Power mandala of all enlightened activities, in the mandala of one's own body-center" (*'phrin las dbang gi dkyil 'khor ni / rang gi dung khang dkyil 'khor na*)
- "Four aspects of lamps clearly appear" (*sgron ma rnam pa bzhi ru gsal*)
- "By the lamp of rigpa of the expanse, kayas and wisdoms gather under power" (*rig pa dbyings kyi sgron ma yis / sku dang ye shes dbang du sdud*)
- "By the lamp of empty thigle, outer elements gather under power" (*thigle stong pa'i sgron ma yis / phyi yi 'byung ba dbang du sdud*)

**Structural Analysis:** The citation follows the standard Anuyoga pattern: establishing the basis (mandala), the method (lamps), and the result (gathering under power).

Four Activities in Bardo
**Analysis:** The four activities correspond to four bardos:
1. **Pacifying** (*zhi ba*): First bardo light-clear cluster appearance dawns
2. **Enriching** (*rgyas pa*): Second bardo wisdom four connection appearance dawns
3. **Power** (*dbang*): Third bardo spontaneously-accomplish jewel eight gates seen
4. **Fierce** (*drag po*): Self-appearance liberate, primordially-pure ground certainty finished, fourth bardo wisdom expanse dissolve

From *rang shar*: "Four kinds enlightened-activity meaning, path complete manner thus: Pacifying path thus, first bardo cluster in, kaya appearance seeing that" (*'phrin las rnam pa bzhi yi don / lam rdzogs lugs 'di lta ste / zhi ba'i lam ni 'di lta ste / bar do dang po tshom bu la / sku yi snang ba mthong ba de*).

[1711-1725] <structure>
Four Activities Corresponding to Four Bardos
**Analysis:** Each of the four enlightened activities corresponds to a specific bardo stage:
1. **Pacifying** (*zhi ba*): First bardo, light-clear cluster appearance dawns
2. **Enriching** (*rgyas pa*): Second bardo, four wisdoms connection appearance dawns
3. **Power** (*dbang*): Third bardo, spontaneously-accomplished jewel eight gates seen
4. **Fierce** (*drag po*): Self-appearance liberates, primordially pure ground certainty established, fourth bardo wisdom dissolves into expanse

From *rang shar*: "Meaning of four kinds of enlightened activities, path completion manner thus: Pacifying path thus, in first bardo cluster, seeing kaya appearance that" (*'phrin las rnam pa bzhi yi don / lam rdzogs lugs 'di lta ste / zhi ba'i lam ni 'di lta ste / bar do dang po tshom bu la / sku yi snang ba mthong ba de*).

**Doxographical Context:** The four activities (*phrin las rnam pa bzhi*) derive from the general Buddhist framework but are here integrated into the bardo teachings. This shows Longchenpa's synthesis of different traditional elements.
