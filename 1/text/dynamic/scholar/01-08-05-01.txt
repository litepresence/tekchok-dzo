## Inseparable Primordial Purity and Spontaneous Presence

**Core Teaching:** Because unceasing display of recognition exists as depth-clarity within the essence of primordial purity, the characteristic of awareness of primordial purity in the portion of non-duality is not established as thing or mark.

**Natural Expression:** The natural expression of self-abiding rigpa dwells as clarity of subtle inner recognition. The essence of appearance is empty, the nature of emptiness dwells clear—the heart of awareness is form and pristine cognition, primordially without gathering or separation, resting like the heart of the sun.

**Key Point:** Primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun grub) are held to be non-dual (dbyer med).

**Canonical Citations:**
- **Rangshar:** "The basis is spoken of as having two aspects: The basis of great primordial purity, and the basis of variegated unceasing display."
- **Klong drug pa:** "The essence itself is primordially pure; The nature is spontaneously accomplished."
- **Mu tig phreng ba:** "The essence is primordially pure, free from the basis of expression; The nature is spontaneously present, complete in whatever appears."

**Transition:** The second part addresses abandoning disputes regarding this recognition—conceptual enumeration vs direct recognition of one's own face.

**Philosophical Framework:** This passage establishes Longchenpa's definitive view: the ground is not one aspect or the other, but the inseparable union of:
- **Essence (ngo bo):** Primordial purity (ka dag)—empty, free from conceptual elaboration
- **Nature (rang bzhin):** Spontaneous presence (lhun grub)—luminous, complete in appearance

This resolves the seven refutations presented earlier: neither pure unity nor pure multiplicity, but their non-dual inseparability.

**Key Terms:**
- ka dag: primordial purity (empty essence)
- lhun grub: spontaneous presence (luminosity)
- dbyer med: non-dual/inseparable
- rig pa: awareness/pristine cognition
- gting gsal: depth-clarity
- ngo bo: essence
- rang bzhin: nature

This is the "result vehicle" ('bras bu'i theg pa) presentation: enlightenment is recognition of what has always been present, not acquisition of something new.
