View Stabilization and Physical Postures

**View Integration:**
Not time for actual consort method, root-generation—ordinary desire without mental fabrication. View-oscillation time: self-body dependent bliss generated without mental control.

Through actual body refinement, holding bodhicitta, refined/unrefined time—extraordinary bliss arises, experience not mixed with mental fabrication. Only knowing mind as mere emptiness. When ordinary conceptions absent in mind—obtained view time.

Refined bodhicitta arriving at holding measure—channels spread, body-mind non-dual great seal beyond mind experienced. View stabilization time: however done, power over bodhicitta, no change/transformation.

**Postures for Channel Mouth Sealing:**
1. Lion's leap (*seng ge'i mchongs stabs*)
2. Leg/arm joints contracted—cuts cyclic existence root
3. Chest space thrown—wind-mind union key point
4. Eyes forcefully drawn—wisdom gate opening key point
5. Intestines curved—body bliss definite liberation key point
6. Long Hūṃ recitation—wind-mind dharmatā union key point
7. Occasional E sound—dharmatā purity result key point

**Bindu Three Locations:**
- Root held: Dharmakāya bliss experienced
- Waist held: Saṃbhogakāya bliss experienced
- Tip held: Nirmāṇakāya bliss experienced

Ordinal Enumeration and Definitive Markers

The five stages employ systematic enumeration:
- "Dang po" (first) through "lnga pa" (fifth)
- Particle "ste" (this is): Definitive identification
- "Ces bya" (called): Nominal designation
- "Zhes so" (thus it is said): Scriptural attestation

The construction "dus" (time/moment) marks the temporal progression: "sems dang ye shes 'khrug pa'i dus" (the time of mind-wisdom disturbance).

[8725-8728] <concept>
Progressive and Simultaneous Unification

Two modes of thigle practice:
1. Rim gyis (gradual): Root to tip sequential refinement
   - Rtsa ba (root): Chos sku (dharmakaya) bliss
   - Rked pa (waist): Longs sku (sambhogakaya) bliss
   - Rtsa mo (tip): Sprul sku (nirmanakaya) bliss

2. Cig car (simultaneous): All three at once
   - Requires advanced capacity
   - Direct recognition of sku gsum (three kayas)

Both lead to phyag rgya chen po (great mudra) realization.

Three-fold Release System

The complete release operates through three dimensions:
1. Phyir 'byongs (external release): Body signs
   - Indestructible thigle manifestation
   - No ordinary appearance (dngos po mthong ba med pa)

2. Nang du sems 'byongs (internal release): Mind signs
   - Conceptuality ceases (rnam rtog nub pa)
   - Karma and latencies exhausted (las dang bag chags stongs pa)

3. Lus kyis sems 'chings (body-mind binding): Integrated signs
   - Three-fold simultaneous occurrence
   - Sku gsum bdag tu med pa'i lta ba (view of three kayas without self)

**Summary:**

Page 205 presents the three-syllable generation of vajra body-speech-mind, the four mudras system, and the three-fold thigle release with its indicators. Philologically, the text employs systematic causative constructions, perfective aspect markers, and resultative particles. Contextual sources include Guhyasamaja Tantra, Hevajra, Cakrasamvara, and Thalgyur root text. Conceptually, the section demonstrates how syllable generation creates three-vajra architecture, how mudra practice progresses from action to non-dual realization, and how thigle refinement generates external, internal, and secret signs of accomplishment corresponding to the three kayas.

[8725-8748] <context>
Kalachakra and Hevajra Bliss Systems

The five bliss stages correspond to:
1. Dga' ba: Ananda (ordinary pleasure)
2. Tshor ba: Paramananda (supreme sensation)
3. Bde ba: Viramananda (cessation bliss)
4. Myong ba: Sahajananda (co-emergent experience)
5. Stong pa: Chittananda/Chittanubhava (mind void/experience)

These align with Kalachakra's progressive dissolution and Hevajra's four joys expanded to five.
