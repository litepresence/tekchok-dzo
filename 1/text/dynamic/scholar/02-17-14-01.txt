. Royal empowerments: three metaphors for recognition and non-return.

[3852-3864] <structure>
Longchenpa establishes three royal metaphors illustrating aspects of guru yoga and recognition: (1) royal caste head empowerment (rgyal rigs dbu la dbang bskur) — rigpa taking its own place without change, (2) king sending army to frontier land (rgyal pos dmag drungs su btang nas 'ongs pa) — five gates of consciousness dawn, ground empty, (3) king's minister captured (rgyal po'i blon po bzang po gcig) — continuum of moving mind consciousness ceases, rigpa obtains self-power. The structure employs royal imagery to illustrate the transformation of consciousness through guru yoga.

[3852-3864] <context>
The royal metaphors reflect the political and social context of Tibetan Buddhism, where kingship provided models for spiritual authority. The "head empowerment" (dbu la dbang bskur) refers to the consecration of royalty—rigpa similarly takes its throne without change. The sandalwood fruit (tsan dan gyi 'bras bu) simile indicates natural maturation without effort. This reflects the Nyingma understanding that realization is not achieved but recognized as already present.

[3852-3864] <philology>
The term rgyal rigs (royal caste) carries its classical Indian sense of kṣatriya lineage. The compound dbu la dbang bskur (head empowerment) indicates royal consecration. The phrase rang sa zin (taking own place) indicates self-recognition. The term drungs su (frontier/border) indicates the periphery contrasted with center. The compound 'gro shes (moving-knowing) refers to the kinetic mind. The verb zin (obtain/attain) indicates achieving stability. The particle bas indicates causation or explanation.

[3852-3864] <concept>
The royal metaphors illustrate the Dzogchen teaching on recognition: just as a king takes the throne that is rightfully his, rigpa takes its own place—this is not achievement but recognition of what has always been. The metaphor of the army going to the frontier and returning illustrates the outward and return journey of consciousness. The captured minister represents the ordinary mind that must be liberated. The concept of rtsol sgrub med (without effort-achievement) is crucial—fruit arrives naturally (rang bzhin du 'bras bu 'byor), not through fabrication.

. Six Vastnesses citation: self-arising, self-dwelling, self-liberating rigpa.

[3865-3894] <structure>
This extensive citation from Klong chen pa drug pa (Six Vastnesses) presents the all-placement instruction (thams cad gzhag pa'i man ngag) of rigpa. The structure emphasizes: (1) rigpa nature primordially self-arises (rang byung), (2) self-dwells (rang gnas), (3) self-liberates (rang grol), (4) whatever dawns is the dawn-place, (5) fabricate-change not (bcos med), (6) spacious place (dal ba'i sa). The verse presents a comprehensive vision of spontaneous presence.

[3865-3894] <context>
The Six Vastnesses (Klong chen pa drug pa) is a key Nyingma tantra providing scriptural authority for the Dzogchen view of spontaneous self-perfection. The citation emphasizes that existence is obtained in mind-itself (sems nyid la srid thob), body three (sku gsum) self-complete, vehicles self-arisen—the entire path is self-manifesting from the ground. This reflects the Nyingma "result vehicle" ('bras bu'i theg pa) perspective that enlightenment is not constructed but revealed.

[3865-3894] <philology>
The term klong chen (six vastnesses) indicates the tantra source. The phrase thams cad gzhag pa (all-placement) indicates the comprehensive method. The compound rang byung (self-arisen) indicates spontaneity without cause. The term rang gnas (self-dwelling) indicates natural abiding. The compound rang grol (self-liberated) indicates freedom without deliberate effort. The phrase bcos med (without fabrication) indicates naturalness. The term dal ba'i sa (spacious place) indicates open, unobstructed dimension.

[3865-3894] <concept>
The philosophical depth here is profound: rigpa is not created, cultivated, or achieved—it self-arises, self-dwells, self-liberates. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching of lhun grub (spontaneous presence) as the nature of reality. The concept of shar sa (dawn-place) indicates that whatever arises is already the place of awakening—no transformation is needed. The three gates (sgo gsum) primordially pure indicates that body, speech, and mind are pure from the beginning, not made pure through practice.

. Liberation's fruit: self-liberation of afflictions and thoughts.

[3895-3921] <structure>
This final section presents the fruit ('bras bu) of liberation: (1) whatever afflictions and thoughts arise self-liberate (rang grol), unable to remain, (2) like water-mirror or snake-knot naturally dissolves (rang grol), (3) saṃsāra-nirvāṇa grasping free ('khor 'das 'dzin bral), (4) one who has passed beyond dharma is called yogin (sgom chen), (5) six realms appearing as mind-itself (sems nyid), (6) five aggregates (phung lnga) and elements ('byung ba) self-purify. The structure demonstrates comprehensive liberation.

[3895-3921] <context>
The description of liberation reflects the Dzogchen teaching of rang grol (self-liberation)—afflictions liberate themselves without needing to be rejected. The similes of water-mirror (chu'i me long) and snake-knot (sbrul gyi mdud pa) illustrate natural dissolution. The phrase chos las yangs pa (passed beyond dharma) indicates transcendence even of Buddhist teachings—this is the ultimate yogin. The purification of the six realms and five aggregates indicates comprehensive transformation of all experience.

[3895-3921] <philology>
The term rang grol (self-liberation) carries its technical Dzogchen sense of spontaneous freedom. The compound chu'i me long (water-mirror) indicates reflections that naturally vanish. The term sbrul gyi mdud pa (snake-knot) refers to the legendary knot that unties itself. The phrase 'khor 'das 'dzin bral (free from grasping at saṃsāra-nirvāṇa) indicates transcendence of even spiritual dualism. The term sgom chen (yogin/meditator) here indicates one who has realized, not merely one who practices. The compound phung lnga (five aggregates) refers to the components of personality.

[3895-3921] <concept>
The soteriology of guru yoga culminates in rang grol (self-liberation): afflictions are not destroyed but recognized as self-liberated. The concept of sems nyid (mind-itself) indicates that all phenomena—all six realms, all aggregates—are manifestations of mind's own nature. The self-purification (rang dag) of elements indicates that matter itself is recognized as pure awareness. The ultimate yogin is "one who has passed beyond dharma"—even the teachings are transcended in direct recognition. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching that the path's goal is to transcend the path itself.
