# Manifold Appearance and Ground Multiplicity
**Architectural Context:** This passage presents a critical analysis within the chapter on views (ལྟ་བ་ lta ba), specifically examining the philosophical position that appearance is inherently manifold/varied (སྣང་བ་སྣ་ཚོགས་པ་ snang ba sna tshogs pa). The structure follows a conditional premise (ལྟར་ན། ltar na—"if like") + assertion (སྣང་བ་ snang ba—"appearance") + consequence (གཞི་ gzhi—"ground") + problem (སྐྱོན་ skyon—"fault").

**Logical Form:** The passage constructs a reductio argument:
- Premise: If appearance is manifold (སྣང་བ་སྣ་ཚོགས་པ་)
- Consequence: Then the ground is also manifold (གཞི་གཅིག་པོ་དེ་ཡང་སྣ་ཚོགས་)
- Problem: This manifests externally (ཕྱིར་ཤར་བའི་), which is a fault (སྐྱོན་ཡོད་)

**Refutation Structure:** This forms part of a systematic refutation examining various positions on appearance. The phrase "first" (དང་པོ་ dang po) suggests this is one position among several being examined.

<philology>
**Particle Analysis:**
- ལྟར་ན། (ltar na): conditional "if, like, as"—establishes the hypothetical premise
- ལྟར་ (ltar): comparative "like, as"—establishing analogy
- ཡང་ (yang): additive "also, again"—extends the consequence to the ground
- སུ་ (su): relative particle "in which, as"—introducing the manner
- ཕྱིར་ (phyir): "outside, external"—directional indicating external manifestation
- བའི་ (ba'i): genitive/relative participle "of arising/manifesting"
- ལ་ (la): coordinating "and"—connecting to the fault statement

**Terminology Semantic Field:**
- སྣང་བ་ (snang ba): "appearance, manifesting"—the appearing aspect of phenomena, technically distinct from the object that appears
- སྣ་ཚོགས་ (sna tshogs): "manifold, various, diverse"—multiplicity in appearance
- གཞི་ (gzhi): "ground, basis"—the fundamental substrate, in this context the ultimate ground or basis of appearance
- གཅིག་པོ་ (gcig po): "one, onefold"—singularity, unity, non-multiplicity
- སྐྱོན་ (skyon): "fault, defect, problem"—in Buddhist logic, a logical consequence that invalidates a position

**Syntactic Analysis:** The phrase སྣང་བ་སྣ་ཚོགས་པ་ལྟར་ (snang ba sna tshogs pa ltar) functions as a conditional premise—"if appearance is manifold." This is followed by གཞི་ (gzhi), extending the consequence to the ground. The compound ཕྱིར་ཤར་བའི་ (phyir shar ba'i) indicates external arising—appearing outside or apart from the ground—which is presented as problematic.

<context>
**Doxographical Placement:** This passage engages with the philosophical debate on the nature of appearance (སྣང་བ་ snang ba) within Buddhist epistemology and metaphysics. The question of whether appearance is internal (mental), external (objective), or neither is central to Buddhist theories of perception.

**Classical Buddhist Positions:**
1. **External Realism** (ཕྱི་ཡུལ་ pahi yul): Appearances exist objectively outside mind; objects are perceived as they are
2. **Idealism** (ནང་ཡུལ་ nang yul): Appearances are purely internal to cognition; mind-only (སྒ໲་ཤེས་ cittamātra)
3. **Middle Way** (དབུ་མ་ um ma): Appearances are neither truly external nor purely internal but dependently arisen

**Refutation Logic:** The argument demonstrates that if appearance is truly manifold (varied, multiple), then the ground from which it arises must also be manifold. This violates the non-dual (བྱེད་མེད་ byed med) nature of the ground in Buddhist philosophy, particularly in རྫོགས་ཆེན་ (rDzogs chen) where the ground is characterized as non-dual awareness.

**Purpose:** This prepares for Longchenpa's own presentation of appearance as the spontaneous manifestation (ལྷུན་གྱིས་སྣང་བ་ lhun gyis snang ba) of the ground without separation from it—appearance is not external to the ground but is the ground's self-manifestation.

<concept>
**Philosophical Problem:** The position that "appearance is manifold" (སྣང་བ་སྣ་ཚོགས་པ་) leads to several philosophical difficulties:

1. **Ground Multiplicity:** If appearances are genuinely various and diverse, and appearances arise from the ground, then the ground itself must be various and multiple—violating the ground's unity and non-multiplicity (གཅིག་པོ་ gcig po).

2. **External Appearance:** The phrase "manifests externally" (ཕྱིར་ཤར་བའི་ phyir shar ba'i) suggests appearance is separated from the ground, appearing outside it. This creates subject-object duality (སྒ໲་ཡུལ་ gzhi yul gyi gnas), contradicting the non-dual ground.

3. **Philosophical Consequence:** The fault (སྐྱོན་ skyon) identified is that this position makes appearance truly other than the ground, creating a dualism incompatible with the non-dual awareness (ཡེ་ཤེས་ ye shes) that is the ground.

**Correct View:** Longchenpa will establish that appearance, while appearing as manifold, is not truly separate from the ground. The ground manifests (སྣང་བ་ snang ba) without going outside itself (ཕྱིར་མི་འགྲོ་ phyir mi 'gro). Manifold appearance (སྣ་ཚོགས་ sna tshogs) is the ground's self-manifestation (གཞིའི་རང་སྣང་ gzhi'i rang snang), not an external object confronting the ground.
