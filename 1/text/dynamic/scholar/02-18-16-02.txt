[5923-5924] <philology>
*brgyad pa mi g.yo ba'i sa thob pa'o* — "Eighth: attainment of the Immovable Ground." *mi g.yo* (immovable) with genitive *ba'i*; *thob pa'o* (attainment) with emphatic. *de nas yon tan rdzogs pa ni* — "Thereafter: the perfection of excellent qualities."

[5923-5924] <context>
Transition from eighth ground (*mi g.yo ba'i sa*, Acalā) to ninth perfection (*yon tan rdzogs pa*) in Chapter 18's ten-ground presentation. Eighth ground marks irreversibility (*phyir mi ldog pa*)—cessation of afflictive obscurations, continuous equipoise, manifestation power.

[5923-5924] <concept>
Eighth Ground: watershed attainment where bodhisattvas realize emptiness-compassion non-duality (*stong nyid snying rje zung 'jug*), surpassing śrāvaka realization. Immovability has two aspects: wisdom (*ye shes mi g.yo*) and compassion (*thugs rje mi g.yo*). Ninth perfection manifests ten powers, four fearlessnesses, eighteen distinctive qualities.
