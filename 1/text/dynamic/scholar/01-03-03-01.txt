The Faculties (*dbang po*)
**Analysis:** Longchenpa introduces the faculties (*dbang po*) as the fifth category in his systematic presentation of samsaric phenomena. Drawing from Abhidharma traditions, he presents a dual typology: form faculties arising from the elemental composition of embodiment, and wisdom faculties emerging from the transformative power of spiritual practice. This classification bridges physiological and soteriological dimensions of Buddhist phenomenology.

**Etymology:** *yul 'dzin pa las dbang byed pas na dbang po* — "they are called faculties because they have power over grasping objects."

**Two-fold Classification:**

1. **Form Faculties (*gzugs can dang po'i cha las byung ba*)** — arising from the portion of form-possessing:
   - Five sense faculties (*mig gi dbang po*, etc.)
   - Mind faculty (*yid kyi dbang po*)

2. **Wisdom Faculties (*shes rab kyi cha las byung ba*)** — arising from the portion of wisdom:
   - Faith (*dad pa*)
   - Effort (*brtson 'grus*)
   - Mindfulness (*dran pa*)
   - Concentration (*ting nge 'dzin*)
   - Wisdom (*shes rab*)
   - Mental peace (*yid bde*)

This division maps onto the standard five (*pancha-indriya*) plus one (*yid bde*) from the Abhidharma-samuccaya tradition.

[1740-1756] <philology>
The Elemental and Wisdom Faculties
**Analysis:** This section provides detailed philological analysis of the twelve faculties (six form-based, six wisdom-based), each correlated with specific elemental compositions. The presentation reflects the standard Abhidharma classification system while incorporating Ayurvedic physiological concepts. Longchenpa demonstrates how the sense faculties (*indriya*) function both as physiological organs and as bases for spiritual development, establishing the framework for understanding how coarse form supports subtle realization.

**The Six Form Faculties and Their Elements:**

1. **Eye Faculty** (*mig gi dbang po*) — holding the coarse earth portion (*sa'i cha*)
2. **Ear Faculty** (*rna ba'i dbang po*) — holding the moving wind portion (*rlung gi cha*)
3. **Nose Faculty** (*sna'i dbang po*) — holding the gathering water portion (*chu'i cha*)
4. **Tongue Faculty** (*lce'i dbang po*) — holding the ripening fire portion (*me'i cha*)
5. **Mind Faculty** (*yid kyi dbang po*) — holding the pervading space portion (*nam mkha'i cha*)
6. **Body Faculty** (*lus kyi dbang po*) — holding the gathering of various portions

This elemental correspondence reflects the standard Ayurvedic-Buddhist physiognomy, where each sense faculty is composed predominantly of one element.

**The Six Wisdom Faculties:**

1. **Faith** (*dad pa'i dbang po*) — *yongs su gdung bar byed pa* — completely afflicting the mind (in the sense of transforming/transforming)
2. **Effort** (*brtson 'grus kyi dbang po*) — *sems rno bar byed pa* — sharpening the mind
3. **Mindfulness** (*dran pa'i dbang po*) — *tshig don gyi cha ma 'chad par 'dzin pa* — holding word and meaning without interruption
4. **Concentration** (*ting nge 'dzin gyi dbang po*) — *chos nyid stong pa nyid mngon du byed cing 'jug par byed pa* — manifesting emptiness of dharmata and producing engagement
5. **Wisdom** (*shes rab kyi dbang po*) — *lta ba'i don la 'jug pa* — engaging the meaning of view
6. **Mental Peace** (*yid bde ba'i dbang po*) — *rtog pa med pa'i don sgrub pa* — producing non-conceptual meaning

[1757-1781] <structure>
Objects and Non-Objects
**Analysis:** Longchenpa now addresses the epistemological structure of experience through the dyad of object (*yul*) and object-possessor (*yul can*). This presentation establishes the fundamental framework for understanding how consciousness engages with its contents, distinguishing between conventional objects of perception and the ultimate object of emptiness. The twofold division into objects of entities (*dngos po'i yul*) and objects of emptiness (*stong pa'i yul*) reflects the two-truths framework while introducing the Dzogchen category of "beyond extremes" (*mtha' las 'das pa*) that transcends both.

Longchenpa presents the fifth category: *yul dang yul can gyi rnam pa* (aspects of objects and possessors of objects).

**The Twofold Division of Objects:**

1. **Object of Entities** (*dngos po'i yul*):
   - Form, sound, smell, taste, dharma
   - Appearance of touch
   - Appearance of four great elements
   - Various appearances of entering conditions

2. **Object of Emptiness** (*stong pa'i yul*):
   - All emptiness, free from cognition of extreme grasping

**The Twofold Division of Non-Objects:**

1. **Transcending Extremes** (*mtha' las 'das pa*):
   - Not grasping any entity as self
   
2. **Beyond View** (*lta ba las 'das pa*):
   - The inexpressible (*brjod du med pa*)

**Key Insight:** The text distinguishes between:
- Objects that appear (*snang ba*)
- Objects that are empty (*stong pa*)
- What transcends both objectification and its negation

This tripartite structure prefigures the prasangika distinction between conventional and ultimate truths, with the addition of the "beyond extremes" (*mtha' las 'das pa*) category that characterizes Dzogchen's unique ontological position.

[1782-1810] <context>
The Uttaratantra Citation
**Analysis:** The citation from the *Rgyud bla ma* (Uttaratantra) provides authoritative scriptural grounding for the relationship between the elements, aggregates, and faculties. Longchenpa uses this Maitreya-Asanga text to establish the hierarchical dependent origination (*rten 'brel*) that underlies the entire samsaric structure. The elemental cosmology presented—earth supported by water and wind, wind by space, with space itself unsupported—serves as a metaphor for the ultimately ungrounded nature of all conditioned phenomena while pointing toward the pure mind (*sems kyi dag pa*) as the final basis.

Longchenpa cites the *Rgyud bla ma* (Uttaratantra/Ratnagotravibhaga), the seminal treatise on buddha-nature attributed to Maitreya via Asanga. This citation provides the metaphysical grounding for the entire presentation.

**The Elemental Dependent Origination:**

```
Earth is in water and wind
Wind abides excellently in space
Space is not in wind, water,
Nor in the earth element
```

**Hermeneutical Structure:**

1. **The Elements as Support:** Earth relies on water and wind
2. **The Ultimate Support:** Wind relies on space (*nam mkha'*)
3. **The Unreliance of Space:** Space does not depend on the lower elements

**Application to Buddhist Phenomenology:**

```
Aggregates, elements, and faculties
Rely upon actions and kleśas
Actions and kleśas are not correct
Yet mental activities constantly abide
```

This presents a hierarchical dependent origination (*rten 'brel*):
- Form relies on action (*las*)
- Action relies on affliction (*nyon mongs*)
- Affliction relies on incorrect mental activity (*tsul bzhin min yid byed*)
- Incorrect mental activity relies on pure mind (*sems kyi dag pa*)

**The Ultimate Point:** *sems kyi rang bzhin chos rnams ni / thams cad yang gnas ma yin* — "the phenomena of mind's self-nature do not abide anywhere."

[1811-1822] <concept>
The Three Types of Action
**Analysis:** Building upon the foundational analysis of aggregates, elements, and faculties, Longchenpa introduces the karmic dimension through the threefold classification of action (*las gsum*). This typology—meritorious, non-meritorious, and immovable—derives from standard Abhidharma formulations but is presented here as the dynamic force that perpetuates samsaric existence. The immovable action (*mi g.yo ba'i las*) is particularly significant as it produces results in the higher form realms, representing the highest achievement within samsara while remaining within cyclic existence. This sets up the Dzogchen critique that transcends even meritorious action.

From the previous analysis emerge three types of action (*las gsum*):

1. **Meritorious Action** (*bsod nams kyi las*):
   - Produces pleasurable results of samsara
   - Includes ten virtues (*dge ba bcu*) and merit-compatible actions
   - Result: Higher realms, human/divine happiness

2. **Non-Meritorious Action** (*bsod nams ma yin pa*):
   - Ten non-virtues (*mi dge ba bcu*)
   - Five uninterrupted offenses (*mtshams med pa lnga*)
   - Result: Lower realms, suffering

3. **Immovable Action** (*mi g.yo ba'i las*):
   - Produces results in higher realms (*khams gong ma'i sa*)
   - *gzhar du mi g.yo bar 'bras bu 'byin pa'i phyir* — produces immovable results elsewhere
   - Associated with form and formless realm meditation

**Dzogchen Critique:** All three are still *'khor ba'i las* — actions of samsara. True liberation transcends even meritorious action.

[1823] <structure> The Six Afflictions
**Analysis:** Longchenpa introduces the six root afflictions (*nyon mongs pa drug*) as the proximate causes that activate the karmic process. These six—desire, anger, pride, ignorance, doubt, and view—function as the motivational forces that drive the actions just enumerated. The presentation follows the standard Abhidharma enumeration while emphasizing their role in perpetuating the cycle of samsara. Understanding these afflictions is crucial for the path to liberation, as they represent the psychological mechanisms that maintain bondage to cyclic existence.

The text introduces the six root afflictions (*nyon mongs pa drug*), which serve as the foundation for all contaminated actions. These are:

1. Desire/attachment (*'dod chags*)
2. Anger/aversion (*zhe sdang*)
3. Pride/arrogance (*nga rgyal*)
4. Ignorance (*ma rig pa* / *gti mug*)
5. Doubt (*the tshom*)
6. View (*lta ba*)

These six function as the proximate cause for the arising of action, which in turn produces the aggregates, elements, and faculties that constitute the ground of delusion.

[1824-1836] <context>
The Sun-Moon-Union Analysis of Afflictions
**Analysis:** The *Nyi zla kha sbyor* (Sun-Moon-Union Tantra) provides the authoritative tantric framework for understanding the six root afflictions. Each affliction is analyzed as arising from confusion (*'khrul pa*) within a specific dimension of experience—ignorance from conceptual grasping of the ground, delusion from the wisdom portion, hatred from the generation stage, pride from view, attachment from appearance, and jealousy from unmanifest effects. This tantric analysis reveals how each affliction represents a particular mode of fundamental confusion about the nature of reality, thereby establishing the foundation for their antidotes.

The *Nyi zla kha sbyor* (Sun-Moon-Union Tantra) provides the scriptural authority for the six root afflictions. Each represents confusion (*'khrul pa*) arising from a specific dimension of experience:

**The Sixfold Structure:**

1. **Ignorance** (*ma rig pa*) — confusion from grasping the basis-of-confusion conceptually (*gzhis 'khrul rtog gi cha 'dzin pa*)
2. **Delusion** (*gti mug*) — confusion from the wisdom portion (*shes rab kyi cha las 'khrul pa*)
3. **Hatred** (*zhe sdang*) — confusion from the stage of generation (*skyed pa'i rim pa'i cha las 'khrul pa*)
4. **Pride** (*nga rgyal*) — confusion from the view portion (*lta ba'i cha las 'khrul pa*)
5. **Attachment** (*'dod chags*) — confusion from the appearance portion (*snang ba'i cha las 'khrul pa*)
6. **Jealousy** (*phrag dog*) — confusion from unmanifest effects (*ma rtogs pa'i las 'khrul pa*)

**Extended Analysis:** The afflictions function as:
- The mind grasping thoughts (*bsam pa rnam rjes su 'dzin pa'i sems*)
- Memory grasping recollections (*dran pa rnam rjes su 'dzin pa'i yid*)
- Concepts becoming the ground of habitual tendencies and doubt

[1837-1841] <structure>
The 84,000 Afflictions
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the classical enumeration of 84,000 afflictions (*brgyad khri bzhi stong*), derived from the multiplication of the three root poisons (attachment, hatred, and delusion) each producing 21,000 afflictions, with an additional 21,000 representing their combinations. This numerical taxonomy, rooted in Abhidharma literature, serves both pedagogical and soteriological purposes: it demonstrates the vast scope of suffering's causes while simultaneously indicating the comprehensive nature of the Buddha's teachings—the 84,000 dharma gates corresponding to these 84,000 afflictions.

Longchenpa presents the traditional enumeration: the conceptual masses (*rtog tshogs*) generate 84,000 (*brgyad khri bzhi stong*) afflictions.

**Distribution:**
- Attachment: 21,000
- Hatred: 21,000
- Delusion: 21,000
- Equal combination of all three: 21,000

This taxonomy derives from the *Abhidharmakosa* and reflects the standard Yogacara classification of defilements.

[1842-1863] <concept>
The Rope-Snake Metaphor
**Analysis:** The rope-snake metaphor (*thag pa sbrul 'dzin*) stands as Buddhism's most powerful illustration of fundamental delusion. Longchenpa draws from the *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl-Garland) to present this classic epistemological analysis: just as a rope in dim light appears as a snake, so too do the aggregates appear as a self where there is none. The metaphor elegantly demonstrates the two truths—conventional appearance (the snake) and ultimate reality (the rope)—while pointing toward the Dzogchen recognition that both are equally empty of inherent existence. This analysis bridges Madhyamaka emptiness and Dzogchen natural liberation.

The text presents the classic *thag pa sbrul 'dzin* (rope-snake grasping) metaphor from the *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl-Garland):

**The Simile Structure:**
1. A rope in dim light appears as a snake
2. The snake-appearance is "true" as appearance (*snang ba*)
3. The rope-reality is "correct" as ultimate (*don dam*)
4. Both are valid within their respective frames

**Application to Two Truths:**

```
The nature of the two truths:
Merely the conventional world
No relation to the ultimate
From the expanse of emptiness,
All aspects of that are liberated
```

**Philological Precision:**
- *de lta snang ba* — appearing thus (conventional appearance)
- *thag pa la ni sbrul mthong* — seeing snake where there is rope (conventional error)
- *de ma yin la der bzung* — grasping that which is not that (the fundamental error)

**Dzogchen Synthesis:** The aggregates are *sgyu ma sprul pa bzhin* — "like illusory emanations" — the same term used to describe the Buddha's display (*sprul pa*).

[1864] <structure> Transition to Vehicle Analysis
**Analysis:** Having completed the exhaustive analysis of samsaric phenomena—aggregates, elements, sense sources, faculties, objects, actions, and afflictions—Longchenpa now transitions to the vehicles (*theg pa*). This structural shift marks a crucial pedagogical movement from establishing the problem (samsara) to presenting the solution (the paths of liberation). The transition is marked by the recognition that understanding the empty nature of these phenomena is the gateway to entering ultimate truth, establishing the foundation for the vehicle classifications that follow.

The text completes the presentation of samsaric phenomena (*'khor ba'i chos*) and transitions to the vehicles (*theg pa*). Knowing these confused appearances (*'khrul snang*) leads to entry into the ultimate truth (*don dam pa'i bden pa*).

[1865-1867] <context>
Chapter Transition
**Analysis:** The chapter transition is marked by a decisive citation from the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra: "all of these are merely the causes of samsara." This scriptural anchor serves multiple functions: it validates the preceding analysis through authoritative tantric sources, establishes the samsaric nature of all phenomena discussed, and creates a boundary between the presentation of samsara (now complete) and the presentation of nirvana (to follow). The transition signals Longchenpa's shift from descriptive metaphysics to soteriological exposition.

The text marks the completion of the second major section with a citation from the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra: *de kun 'khor ba'i rgyu 'ba' zhig lags* — "all of these are merely the causes of samsara." This establishes that the preceding analysis of aggregates, elements, sense sources, and faculties serves as the foundation for understanding cyclic existence.

[1868-1880] <structure>
Chapter III: Detailed Division of Samsaric Phenomena
**Analysis:** Chapter III opens with an authoritative citation from the *Rig pa rang shar chen po'i rgyud* (Great Tantra of Self-Arisen Awareness), establishing the immeasurable scope of the vehicle. The twofold division into worldly (*'jig rten pa*) and transcendent (*'jig rten las 'das pa*) vehicles provides the overarching framework for all subsequent presentation. This classification encompasses the entire range of Buddhist and non-Buddhist paths, from the fixated vehicle of gods and humans through the causal vehicles to the resultant vehicle of Secret Mantra, culminating in Atiyoga.

The chapter heading establishes the scope: *'khor ba'i chos rab tu dbye ba ste rim khang gsum pa* — "The detailed division of samsaric phenomena—third chapter."

**Epistemological Framework:**

Longchenpa introduces the vehicle classification (*theg pa'i rnam grangs*) with authority from the *Rig pa rang shar chen po'i rgyud* (Great Tantra of Self-Arisen Awareness):

```
Hold the secret vajra!
My vehicle is immeasurable.
It gathers all modes of explanation into two:
Samsara and nirvana.
```

**Two-fold Division:**

1. **Worldly Vehicle** (*'jig rten pa'i theg pa*)
2. **Transcendent Vehicle** (*'jig rten las 'das pa'i theg pa*)

[1881-1897] <concept>
The Worldly Vehicle Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa subjects the worldly vehicle to rigorous fivefold analysis (*lnga*): essence (*ngo bo*), definition (*nges tshig*), division (*dbye na*), purpose (*dgos pa*), and result (*'bras bu*). This analytical framework reveals that even the most refined worldly spiritual practice—accumulating merit through ten virtues and ethical discipline—remains within samsara. The technical term *sor bzhag* (fixated) indicates that this vehicle establishes samsara as its ground without transcending it, serving as the necessary foundation while pointing toward the need for transcendent vehicles.

Longchenpa applies the fivefold analysis (*lnga*) to the worldly vehicle:

**1. Essence (*ngo bo*):**
*'khor ba las mi 'phags pa'i yid dpyod kyi rnam grangs* — "the enumerations of mental investigation that do not transcend samsara"

**2. Definition (*nges tshig*):**
*'jig rten gyi legs par tsam la sbyor zhing 'god pa* — "engaging and establishing merely the excellence of the world"

**3. Division (*dbye na*):**
- *sor bzhag* — Fixated vehicle
- *phyin ci log* — Mistaken vehicle

**4. Purpose (*dgos pa*):**
*rang rang gi 'bras bu 'grub par byed pa* — "accomplishing one's own results"

**5. Result (*'bras bu*):**
The manifestation of one's particular result at a certain time

**The Fixated Vehicle of Gods and Humans:**

Longchenpa references the *Rdo rje sems dpa' sgyu 'phrul drwa chen po* (Great Magical Net of Vajrasattva):
*theg pa sna pa lha dang mi'i theg pa'o* — "the earlier vehicle is the vehicle of gods and humans"

This vehicle accumulates merit (*bsod nams*) through:
- Ten virtues (*dge ba bcu*)
- Ethical discipline (*gso sbyong*)
- Merit-compatible actions (*bsod nams cha mthun*)

**Technical Term:** *sor bzhag* (fixated/established separately) indicates that this vehicle establishes samsara as the basis (*rten*) without transcending it.

[1898-1901] <philology>
Transition to Mistaken Vehicles
**Analysis:** The transition to *phyin ci log gi theg pa* (mistaken vehicles) marks the entry into non-Buddhist philosophical systems. Longchenpa cites the *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen Tantra) as the scriptural authority for this section, establishing the Dzogchen tantric framework as the ultimate reference point. These mistaken vehicles—eternalist and nihilist—represent the conceptual extremes that Buddhist philosophy refutes. By presenting them after the worldly vehicle but before the causal vehicles, Longchenpa creates a pedagogical progression from the naive to the erroneous to the correct, following the traditional Buddhist doxographical structure.

The text transitions to *phyin ci log gi theg pa* (mistaken vehicles), citing the *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen Tantra) as the authoritative source. These represent the non-Buddhist (*mu stegs*) philosophical systems that grasp at erroneous views.
