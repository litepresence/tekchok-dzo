Second: Light Rays Abiding
Structural marker for the second wisdom lamp.

[19405] <philology>
*gnyis pa 'od kyi zer thag tu gnas pa dang* — "Second: abiding as a continuum of light rays." *zer thag* (ray-thread) combines radiance (*zer*) with continuity (*thag*); terminative *tu* indicates manner of abiding.

[19405] <context>
Second of four wisdom lamps—the awareness-expanse lamp (*rig pa dbyings kyi sgron ma*). Progression from first (field of light) to second (thread of light) suggests movement from expansive ground to continuous medium.

[19405] <concept>
Second lamp represents the *dbyings* (expanse/dhātu) dimension—the all-pervasive continuum of awareness. The "thread" (*thag*) indicates the unbroken stream (*rgyun*) of knowing persisting through all states. Supports recognition of *rang bzhin* (nature) as luminous clarity.
