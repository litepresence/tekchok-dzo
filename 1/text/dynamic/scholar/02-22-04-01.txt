Eight Forms of Manifestation
**Close reading:** The essence (*ngo bo*) of body-appearance comprises eight forms:
1. *Sku rkyang* - singular body
2. *Phyed sku* - half-body
3. *Yab yum* - father-mother union
4. *Tshom bu* - sphere/circle
5. *Dkyil 'khor chen po* - great mandala
6. *Mchod rten* - stupa (and similar forms)
7. *'Khor lo* - wheel
8. *Rdo rje, rin po che, padma, rgya gram, ral gri* - vajra, jewel, lotus, cross, sword

<concept>
Development Stage Correlations
**Examination:** The text correlates developmental stages of practice (*bskyed rdzogs*) with manifestation types:
- Pre-perfect (*nar ma son pa*): seed syllables (*yi ge*), hand-emblems (*phyag mtshan*), half-bodies, single forms
- Fully complete (*yongs su rdzogs pa*): father-mother, spheres, mandalas

<grammatical-examination>
Dual Classification: *Zhi khro gnyis*
**Consideration:** The primary division (*dbye ba*) separates into:
- *Zhi ba'i sku* - peaceful body
- *Khro bo'i sku* - wrathful body
The numeral *gnyis* with *te* marks binary enumeration.

<doxographical-placement>
Scriptural Citations on Body Types
**Philological analysis:** Three citations establish the dual body typology:
1. *Sku gdung 'bar ba* (lines 11344-11350): Relics' remainder (*lhag ma'i zag bcas*) of aggregates burned and purified yield two body forms
2. *Rang shar* (lines 11351-11356): Peaceful and wrathful distinguished; wrathful body cannot emanate as Nirmanakaya
3. *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long* (lines 11357-11359): Confirms two body types

<concept>
Two Causes of Continuity
**Investigation:** The cause (*rgyu*) is twofold:
1. *Ngo bo'i rgyu* - Essential cause: sentient beings possess luminosity-body (*'od gsal gyi sku*) from the beginning
2. *Mngon gyur gyi rgyu* - Manifest cause: matured through creation-completion practice, arising from pure element essences (*dangs ma*), not latent impure nature

<historical-context>
Citation on Ripening
**Close reading:** The *Sngar ma* citation distinguishes:
- *Smin pa* - ripened/manifest
- *Ma smin* - unripened/latent (*bag la zha*)
Sentient beings dwell in great self-settled ground from the beginning.

<concept>
Locations of Emergence
**Examination:** Body primarily emerges from:
- *Mgo* - head, or
- *Sgal tshigs* - spinal column
However, through luminosity familiarity (*'od gsal goms pas*), the locations are those two.

[11379] <architectural-analysis> Transition to Results
**Consideration:** Line 11379 introduces the result (*'bras bu*) section: attainment of liberation through progressive stages.

[11344] <philology> Genitive Chain: *Rigs ldan mya ngan las 'das pa*
**Philological analysis:** The genitive particles link: "of the noble one who has passed into nirvana, of that [one's] remainder..."

<concept>
Liberation Through Both Body Types
**Investigation:** When both peaceful and wrathful bodies arise (*zhi khro gnyis ka byung*):
- Consciousness dissolves into space (*rnam shes nam mkhar thim*)
- Space's primordially pure self-radiance dawns (*nam mkha' ka dag gi rang gdangs shar*)
- Liberation without dharmata bardo (*chos nyid kyi bar do med par sangs rgyas*)
- Included within this-life liberation category (*tshe 'dir grol ba'i khongs su 'dus*)

<concept>
Future Separation
**Close reading:** The separation from this basis (*rten 'di nas 'bral ba*) in future (*phyi ma*) follows this same pattern (*de yin pa'i phyir*).

<concept>
Peaceful Body Liberation Timeline
**Examination:** When peaceful body arises:
- This appearance ceases (*snang ba 'di 'gags*)
- Liberation in five absorption days (*bsam gtan gyi zhag lnga*) of self-luminous self-appearance
- *Bsam gtan gyi zhag* defined as absorption duration (*ting nge 'dzin gyi gnas cha*)
- Duration varies (*ring thung gi khyad*) among yogins

<concept>
Wrathful Body Liberation Timeline
**Consideration:** When wrathful body arises:
- From eye emerges Vajrasattva nose-cord (*mig nas rdo rje sems dpa'i sna thag*)
- Sound-light-ray three self-appear (*sgra 'od zer gsum rang snang*)
- Liberation in five instants (*skad cig cha lnga*)

<context>
Citations on Dual Liberation
**Philological analysis:** 
1. *Sku gdung 'bar ba* (lines 11390-11400): If both arise, without bardo, confident in great primordially pure essence; five days for true seeing; buddhahood dissolution; wrathful body liberates in bardo in five instants
2. *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long* (lines 11401-11405): Peaceful body yields stability after appearance ceases, cannot emit Nirmanakaya; wrathful body gains stability, can emit Nirmanakaya after twenty-one days

<concept>
Distinction in Emanation Capacity
**Investigation:** The peaceful body:
- Dissolves into transparent primordial purity (*zang thal du ka dag sa*)
- No bardo emanation arises (*bar do nas rang snang gi sprul pa mi 'byung*)
- Pure appearance basis (*ka dag...sprul pa'i snang cha*) absent
- Becomes basis for other-appearance Sambhogakaya-Nirmanakaya
- No self-emanation capacity, but other-benefit activities (*'phrin las*) arise dependent on that

<concept>
Wrathful Body Emanation Process
**Close Reading:** The wrathful body:
- Liberates through recognizing sound-light-ray as self-appearance (*sgra 'od zer gsum rang snang du shes pas*)
- Spontaneous presence base-appearance dawns (*lhun grub kyi gzhi snang shar*)
- Pauses for a moment (*dar cig sdod pas*)
- After twenty-one absorption days completed
- From impure self-appearance (six realms), through pure gate, emanates Nirmanakaya for whoever needs taming
- Functions like illusion benefiting illusion (*sgyu mas sgyu ma'i don byed pa*)
- Self-appearance benefits self-appearance (*rang snang la rang snang gis don byed*)

<concept>
Detailed Emanation Mechanics
**Technical Examination:** The wrathful body liberation process continues:
- Luminosity essence essence dawns in spontaneous presence base-appearance (*lhun grub kyi gzhi snang shar ba*)
- Pauses for a moment (*dar cig sdod pas*)
- After twenty-one absorption days (*bsam gtan gyi zhag nyi shu rtsa gcig*)
- From impure self-appearance (samsara's six realms), through pure gate (*dag pa'i sgo*), Nirmanakaya emanates to tame beings
- Functions like illusion performing illusion's benefit (*sgyu mas sgyu ma'i don byed pa*)
- Self-appearance benefits self-appearance (*rang snang la rang snang gis don byed*)

<concept>
Necessity of Prior Liberation
**Detailed Analysis:** After emitting emanation, prior liberation is already accomplished. Without self-liberation, self-benefit incomplete, other-benefit circumstances cannot arise.

<concept>
Prior Liberation Requirement
**Syntactic Structure:** After emitting emanation, prior liberation already accomplished. Without self-liberation (*rang ma grol*), self-benefit incomplete (*rang don ma rdzogs*), other-benefit circumstances (*gnas skabs*) cannot arise.

<philology>
Comparative Particles: *Tsam dang...de bas*
**Detailed Analysis:** The comparison *skar mda' rgyug pa tsam* (like shooting star) establishes the brief, swift nature of emanation duration.

<concept>
Emanation Duration Variability
**Investigation:** Emanation duration compared to shooting star (*skar mda' rgyug pa*), longer or shorter, indefinite duration explained.

<concept>
Error Regarding Emanation Capacity
**Examination:** Common confusion (*'khrul pa*) regarding ability to emit emanation leads to focusing attention (*blo rtse gtod*) on whether buddhas can benefit others. This is called a "great fierce error" (*rnor ba rngams che*).

<concept>
Common Error on Buddha Activity
**Doxographical Placement:** Confusion (*'khrul nas*) regarding emanation capacity focuses attention on whether buddhas can benefit others after awakening. This is called "great fierce error" (*rnor ba rngams che*).

<context>
Mahayana View on Buddha Activity
**Tradition Context:** Buddhas not engaging in benefit is neither desired nor possible in Mahayana.

<context>
Mahayana Rejection of Inactive Buddhas
**Philological Analysis:** Buddhas not performing benefit neither desired (*mi 'dod*) nor possible (*mi srid*) in Mahayana.

<concept>
Emanation Absence in Complete Liberation
**Consideration:** Those liberated into transparent primordial purity without bardo spontaneous presence gate-opening lack emanation because:
- Impure taming-fields (*gdul zhing ma dag pa*) not visible at that time
- From spontaneous presence gate-appearance, impure appearances visible
- If emanation doesn't benefit there, samsara-appearance not dissolved
- Buddha-activity accomplished as self-appearance completion through emanation
- After benefiting, samsara empties, emanation reabsorbs into spontaneous presence eight gates, goes to primordial purity ground

<concept>
Non-Dual Kayas
**Doxographical Placement:** Primordial purity ground transcends visible/invisible distinction. Three kayas' appearance-basis only, no separate three kayas. From there, base-appearance other-benefit arises.

<context>
Secret Vajra Pledge
**Arrangement:** This place (*gnas 'di*) is the difficult supreme vajra pledge (*dka' ba'i mchog rdo rje'i chings*), great secret. If from now (*da phan chad*) one can speak without error, know it as this author's power.

[11436] <structure> Transition to Relics Section
**Close Reading:** Line 11436 initiates the second major section (*gnyis pa*): extensive explanation of relics (*gdung*), structured in three parts (*gsum ste*).

[11426] <philology> Negative Existential: *Med de*
**Arrangement:** *Med de* (there is no) marks absence of emanation for those completely liberated.

<structure>
Threefold Analysis of Relics
**Cross-Textual Note:** The relics (*gdung*) section comprises three divisions:
1. *Thun mong gi dbye bas mdor bstan* - brief presentation through common divisions
2. *Khyad par gyi dbye bas rgyas par bshad* - extensive explanation through distinctive divisions
3. *Gdung dang ring bsrel gyi khyad par gyis don bsdus* - meaning summary through relic-ring distinction

<concept>
Common Divisions of Relics
**Hermeneutical Frame:** All beings are buddhas from the beginning (*ye nas sangs rgyas*), dwelling as five buddha-families (*rig lnga*), both individual and non-individual. The unripened five relics (*gdung lnga*) in the life-force (*srog*) are ripened through yogin's luminosity-essence path practice, manifesting as five *shariram* (relics), liberating in respective families.

<context>
Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Examination:** The verse citation enumerates five relics by family:
- *Sha ri ram* - Tathagata family (white)
- *Ba ri ram* - Vajra family (dark blue)
- *Chu ri ram* - Ratna family (yellow)
- *Bse ri ram* - Padma family (red)
- *Nya ri ram* - Karma family (green)

<concept>
Relic Signs of Liberation
**Tradition Context:** Whatever family-relics arise on the person indicate liberation in that family's buddha. The citation from *De nyid* confirms:
- Signs arise on the capable person's body at death
- Individual family relics lead to seeing respective buddha-bodies in bardo

<context>
Citation from *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long*
**Examination:** Relics also divide into five by color, indicating liberation in respective pure realms:
- Dark blue (*mthing ga*) - Vairocana's realm, manifest complete awakening
- White (*dkar po*) - Vajrasattva
- Yellow (*ser po*) - Ratnasambhava
- Red (*dmar po*) - Amitabha
- Green (*ljang gu*) - Amoghasiddhi
- Multicolored (*sna tshogs*) - attainment of five kayas spontaneously accomplished ground

<structure>
Distinctive Divisions Structure
**Comparative Analysis:** The distinctive divisions (*khyad par gyi dbye ba*) analyze four aspects:
1. Color size measure (*kha dog che chung gi tshad*)
2. Location distinction (*gnas kyi khyad par*)
3. Cause of arising (*rgyu gang las byung ba*)
4. (Fourth implicit)
