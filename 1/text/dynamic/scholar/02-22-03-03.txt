Three Combinations of Signs
**Analysis:** The text analyzes liberation based on combinations of three signs (*rtags*):

1. **Body sign complete** (*lus rtags rdzogs na*): liberation in bardo (*bar dor grol*)
2. **Body and speech signs present** (*lus dang ngag gnyis...yod pa*): liberation in Nirmanakaya realm (*sprul pa'i zhing du grol*)
3. **Mind sign complete** (*sems rtags rdzogs na*): liberation in bardo in three instants (*bar do la skad cig gsum gyis grol*)
4. **All three complete** (*gsum ka rdzogs na*): engaging in other-benefit compassion (*snying rje gzhan don byed*)

[11188-11191] <concept>
Fruitional Dimensions
**Analysis:** When all three signs are complete:
- Knowledge of certain self-attainment (*rang don thob nges su shes pas*)
- Blessing for measureless lives (*tshe grangs med par byin gyis brlabs*)
- Benefit accomplished for beings
- Liberation as light into the very basis
- With body and mind signs: swift self-attainment and liberation

[11192-11194] <concept>
Specific Timeframes
**Analysis:** This section establishes precise temporal frameworks for spiritual attainment based on the combination of signs (*rtags*). Longchenpa demonstrates how different configurations of body, speech, and mind signs correspond to varying timeframes for liberation—from immediate awakening when all three signs are combined, to ten years when only speech and mind signs are present. This typology reflects the tantric principle that spiritual capacity (*dbang po*) and recognition (*rig pa*) determine the speed of attainment, with those possessing sharper faculties achieving more rapid results.

- Speech and mind signs combined (*ngag dang sems kyi rtags 'dzom pa*): light-body attained in ten years (*lo bcu na 'od lus thob*)
- All three signs combined (*lus ngag yid gsum gyi rtags 'dzom pa*): even those without other-benefit capacity liberated in two years (*lo gnyis na grol*)

Extensive Citation on Sign Combinations
**Analysis:** This long citation from *De nyid* (Thatness) tantra elaborates:
- Lines 11197-11199: Body sign complete leads to seeing reality in bardo and awakening
- Lines 11200-11202: Body and speech signs lead to one-birth awakening in Nirmanakaya realm
- Lines 11203-11209: Mind sign complete enables three-instant liberation like a shooting star
- Lines 11210-11218: All three signs combined leads to great bodhicitta, benefiting beings for eons with one human body
- Lines 11219-11224: Body and mind signs combined leads to liberation in ten years, elements dissolving into pure reality
- Lines 11225-11231: All three signs combined for fortunate being leads to liberation in two years without doubt

[11195] <philology> Citation Formula: *De nyid las*
**Analysis:** Marks transition to extended tantric citation.

[11232] <structure> Critical Distinction: Incomplete Signs
**Analysis:** Line 11232 introduces a crucial caveat: without distinctive outer/inner signs (*phyi nang gi rtags khyad par can*), merely possessing some signs (*rtags 'ga' tsam*) creates uncertain signs (*ma nges pa'i rtags*), not liberation.

[11232] <philology> Negative Particle Chain
**Analysis:** The construction *med par...yod kyang...ma nges pa* establishes the contrast between presence and certainty.

[11233-11235] <concept>
Certain Liberation Signs
**Analysis:** With certain outer/inner signs (*phyi nang gi rtags nges pa can*), liberation exists in such measure (*de ltar grol tshad du yod*). However, mere possession of signs does not pervade liberation (*rtags yod tsam la grol bas ma khyab*). The logic is: liberation pervades possession of signs (*grol ba la rtags yod pas khyab pa*), making this distinction precious (*gces*).

[11233-11235] <philology>
Particle Analysis: *Khyab pa*
**Analysis:** The term *khyab pa* (pervasion) denotes logical entailment in Tibetan epistemology (*tshad ma*). The instrumental *-s* in *yod pas* marks the pervasion relationship.

[11236-11249] <context>
Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** This citation warns against incomplete signs:
- Merely possessing some body/speech/mind signs (*lus ngag yid kyi rtags kun...'ga' tsam*)
- Does not mean liberation (*rnam par grol ba ma yin*)
- Worldly common siddhis (*'jig rten thun mong dngos grub*)
- Gradual hearers and self-buddhas (*rim gyis nyan thos rang sangs rgyas*)
- All enter this level (*sa la zhugs*)
- Without result of great purity (*rnam dag chen po'i 'bras bu med*)
- Only those with complete body/speech signs reach the great equality level (*mnyam pa chen po sa*)

[11236] <philology> Universal Quantifier: *Kun*
**Analysis:** *Kun* (all) with the genitive *ni* emphasizes that all three signs must be considered, not just one.

[11250-11251] <concept>
Absence of Signs in Non-Meditators
**Analysis:** Those without outer/inner liberation signs now, who have gone into non-meditation (*bsgom med*), do not need meditation practice (*bsgom mi dgos*) as karma cannot harm them (*las kyis mi gnod*). However, future instructions must not be neglected (*phyis thod pa mgo la mi 'gel bya*).

[11252-11254] <concept>
Warning Against False Claims
**Analysis:** Even if claiming "I see the authentic reality of dharmata, view and meditation are complete" (*ngas chos nyid rnal ma'i don mthong lta sgom mthar phyin*), if speaking falsely (*brdzun gtong*), this deceives both self and others, allowing demonic entry (*bdud zhugs pa*).

[11252] <philology> Rhetorical Particle: *Zer yang*
**Analysis:** *Zer yang* (even if saying) introduces a concessive clause, acknowledging the claim while refuting its validity.

[11255-11265] <context>
Citation on False Confidence
**Analysis:** This citation from *De nyid* warns:
- Without signs but claiming confidence in self-appearance (*rang snang gdeng du tshud*)
- Merely accepting intellectually (*yid dpyod rnams kyi lta ba*)
- Intellectually contrived meditation (*yid dpyod sgom pa*)
- Cannot liberate through this alone
- Will remain long in samsara

[11255] <philology> Negative Particle: *Mi ldan par*
**Analysis:** *Mi ldan par* (without possessing) establishes the prerequisite condition, negated in false practitioners.

[11266-11272] <concept>
Special Instruction for Thodgal Practitioners
**Analysis:** For *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) meditation yogins, these signs certainly arise without deception (*grol nges bslu ba med par 'byung*). Therefore, special effort (*brtson 'grus khyad par can*) is instructed.

[11266] <philology> Emphatic Particle: *De'ang*
**Analysis:** *De'ang* (even that) introduces an additional consideration beyond the previous warning.

[11267-11272] <context>
Final Citation on Familiarization
**Analysis:** The citation from *De las* emphasizes:
- Familiarization with expanse and awareness (*dbyings rig goms pa*) is precious
- Whoever familiarizes with expanse and awareness
- The previously explained signs will certainly arise
- Practice with diligence (*nan tan bya*)

[11273] <structure> Transition to Third General Meaning
**Analysis:** Line 11273 initiates the third general meaning (*spyi don gsum pa*): summarizing signs of liberation/confusion in bardo and future lives. This is structured in two parts (*gnyis te*).

[11273] <philology> Enumerative Particle: *La gnyis te*
**Analysis:** *La gnyis te* (regarding [this], two [divisions]) marks structural subdivision.

[11274-11278] <structure>
Two Divisions of the Third General Meaning
**Analysis:** The third general meaning comprises:
1. *Dang po* (line 11274-11278): Signs of yogins liberated and attaining awakening
2. *Gnyis pa* (line 11275): Signs of six realms' beings taking rebirth through confusion

Each has two subdivisions (*gnyis te*): brief presentation (*mdor bstan*) and extensive explanation (*rgyas par bshad*).

[11274-11282] <concept>
Two Types of Parinirvana in Dzogchen
**Analysis:** The text presents two Dzogchen approaches to awakening (*sangs rgya lugs gnyis*):

1. **Manifestly Complete Awakening** (*mngon par rdzogs par sangs rgyas pa*):
   - Occurs through sign-appearance (*rtags snang bas*)
   - With remainder of form aggregate (*rdos bcas kyi lhag ma*)
   - Nirvana with remainder (*lhag ma dang bcas pa'i mya ngan las 'das pa*)
   - Results from incomplete diligence (*brtson 'grus dman pas*)

2. **Truly Complete Awakening** (*yang dag par rdzogs par sangs rgyas pa*):
   - Through excellent diligence and pure remainder (*brtson 'grus rab rdos bcas dag pas*)
   - Nirvana without remainder (*phung po'i lhag ma med par mya ngan las 'das pa*)

[11276-11278] <philology>
Structural Particles: *La...te...o*
**Analysis:** The pattern *la gnyis te* / *dang* / *o* creates nested enumeration: "regarding [this], two [divisions]: brief and extensive presentation."

[11274] <philology> Agentive Construction: *Rnal 'byor pa grol bas*
**Analysis:** *Grol bas* (through/by liberation) marks agency: the yogin who is liberated, through that liberation, attains the signs of awakening.

[11280-11282] <philology>
Causal Construction: *Kyis...kyang*
**Analysis:** The instrumental *-s* in *bsgoms kyang* (even though meditated) establishes the concessive: despite having meditated on dharmata, incomplete diligence prevented reaching the measure.

[11283] <context> Source Citation: *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long gi rgyud*
**Analysis:** This citation from the Vajrasattva Heart-Mirror Tantra establishes the two types of nirvana as scriptural authority.

[11286-11297] <concept>
Five Manifestations at Death
**Analysis:** For the manifestly complete awakened person, five signs arise:
1. *'Od* - light
2. *Sgra* - sound
3. *Gdung* - relics/stupa
4. *Sku* - form/body
5. *Sa g.yo ba* - earth trembling

[11298-11310] <context>
Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Analysis:** This verse citation elaborates external signs (*phyi yi rtags*):
- Intelligent accomplished person (*skyes bu blo rtsal rab*)
- Elements dissolve to their own ground (*'byung ba rang gi sar dengs*)
- Result of own-nature (*ngo bo nyid kyi 'bras bu*)
- Contaminated aggregates become invisible (*zag bcas phung po mi snang*)
- Result transforms to its own ground
- After passing into nirvana: body, relics, light, sound, and earth trembling

[11298-11310] <philology>
Parallel Enumeration
**Analysis:** The verse employs fivefold enumeration marked by *dang* conjunctions, creating a rhythmic catalogue of miraculous signs.

[11311-11316] <structure>
Five Extensive Explanations
**Analysis:** The second subdivision presents five extensive explanations (*rgyas par bshad pa lnga*):
1. *Sku* - body
2. *Gdung* - relics/stupa
3. *'Od* - light
4. *Sgra* - sound
5. *Sa g.yo ba* - earth trembling

[11317] <structure> Subdivision Markers
**Analysis:** Line 11317 indicates the beginning of the first extensive explanation on body, with its own internal structure.

[11318-11321] <structure>
Fivefold Presentation Format
**Analysis:** The analysis of bodily form (*sku*) follows the standard fivefold scholastic format:
1. *Ngo bo* - essence (lines 11322-11324)
2. *Dbye ba* - divisions (lines 11318, 11342-11343)
3. *Rgyu* - cause (lines 11360-11371)
4. *Gnas* - location (lines 11372-11378)
5. *'Bras bu* - result (line 11379)
