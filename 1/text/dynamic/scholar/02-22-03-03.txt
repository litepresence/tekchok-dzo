Three Combinations of Signs
**Close reading:** The text analyzes liberation based on combinations of three signs (*rtags*):

1. **Body sign complete** (*lus rtags rdzogs na*): liberation in bardo (*bar dor grol*)
2. **Body and speech signs present** (*lus dang ngag gnyis...yod pa*): liberation in Nirmanakaya realm (*sprul pa'i zhing du grol*)
3. **Mind sign complete** (*sems rtags rdzogs na*): liberation in bardo in three instants (*bar do la skad cig gsum gyis grol*)
4. **All three complete** (*gsum ka rdzogs na*): engaging in other-benefit compassion (*snying rje gzhan don byed*)

<concept>
Fruitional Dimensions
**Investigation:** When all three signs are complete:
- Knowledge of certain self-attainment (*rang don thob nges su shes pas*)
- Blessing for measureless lives (*tshe grangs med par byin gyis brlabs*)
- Benefit accomplished for beings
- Liberation as light into the very basis
- With body and mind signs: swift self-attainment and liberation

<concept>
Specific Timeframes
**Examination:**
- Speech and mind signs combined (*ngag dang sems kyi rtags 'dzom pa*): light-body attained in ten years (*lo bcu na 'od lus thob*)
- All three signs combined (*lus ngag yid gsum gyi rtags 'dzom pa*): even those without other-benefit capacity liberated in two years (*lo gnyis na grol*)

Extensive Citation on Sign Combinations
**Consideration:** This long citation from *De nyid* (Thatness) tantra elaborates:
- Lines 11197-11199: Body sign complete leads to seeing reality in bardo and awakening
- Lines 11200-11202: Body and speech signs lead to one-birth awakening in Nirmanakaya realm
- Lines 11203-11209: Mind sign complete enables three-instant liberation like a shooting star
- Lines 11210-11218: All three signs combined leads to great bodhicitta, benefiting beings for eons with one human body
- Lines 11219-11224: Body and mind signs combined leads to liberation in ten years, elements dissolving into pure reality
- Lines 11225-11231: All three signs combined for fortunate being leads to liberation in two years without doubt

[11195] <grammatical-examination> Citation Formula: *De nyid las*
**Philological analysis:** Marks transition to extended tantric citation.

[11232] <structural-mapping> Critical Distinction: Incomplete Signs
**Close reading:** Line 11232 introduces a crucial caveat: without distinctive outer/inner signs (*phyi nang gi rtags khyad par can*), merely possessing some signs (*rtags 'ga' tsam*) creates uncertain signs (*ma nges pa'i rtags*), not liberation.

[11232] <linguistic-analysis> Negative Particle Chain
**Investigation:** The construction *med par...yod kyang...ma nges pa* sets up the contrast between presence and certainty.

<concept>
Certain Liberation Signs
**Examination:** With certain outer/inner signs (*phyi nang gi rtags nges pa can*), liberation exists in such measure (*de ltar grol tshad du yod*). However, mere possession of signs does not pervade liberation (*rtags yod tsam la grol bas ma khyab*). The logic is: liberation pervades possession of signs (*grol ba la rtags yod pas khyab pa*), making this distinction precious (*gces*).

<grammatical-examination>
Particle Analysis: *Khyab pa*
**Consideration:** The term *khyab pa* (pervasion) denotes logical entailment in Tibetan epistemology (*tshad ma*). The instrumental *-s* in *yod pas* marks the pervasion relationship.

<historical-context>
Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Philological analysis:** This citation warns against incomplete signs:
- Merely possessing some body/speech/mind signs (*lus ngag yid kyi rtags kun...'ga' tsam*)
- Does not mean liberation (*rnam par grol ba ma yin*)
- Worldly common siddhis (*'jig rten thun mong dngos grub*)
- Gradual hearers and self-buddhas (*rim gyis nyan thos rang sangs rgyas*)
- All enter this level (*sa la zhugs*)
- Without result of great purity (*rnam dag chen po'i 'bras bu med*)
- Only those with complete body/speech signs reach the great equality level (*mnyam pa chen po sa*)

[11236] <linguistic-analysis> Universal Quantifier: *Kun*
**Close reading:** *Kun* (all) with the genitive *ni* emphasizes that all three signs must be considered, not just one.

<concept>
Absence of Signs in Non-Meditators
**Investigation:** Those without outer/inner liberation signs now, who have gone into non-meditation (*bsgom med*), do not need meditation practice (*bsgom mi dgos*) as karma cannot harm them (*las kyis mi gnod*). However, future instructions must not be neglected (*phyis thod pa mgo la mi 'gel bya*).

<concept>
Warning Against False Claims
**Examination:** Even if claiming "I see the authentic reality of dharmata, view and meditation are complete" (*ngas chos nyid rnal ma'i don mthong lta sgom mthar phyin*), if speaking falsely (*brdzun gtong*), this deceives both self and others, allowing demonic entry (*bdud zhugs pa*).

[11252] <philology> Rhetorical Particle: *Zer yang*
**Hermeneutical Frame:** *Zer yang* (even if saying) introduces a concessive clause, acknowledging the claim while refuting its validity.

<context>
Citation on False Confidence
**Philological Analysis:** This citation from *De nyid* warns:
- Without signs but claiming confidence in self-appearance (*rang snang gdeng du tshud*)
- Merely accepting intellectually (*yid dpyod rnams kyi lta ba*)
- Intellectually contrived meditation (*yid dpyod sgom pa*)
- Cannot liberate through this alone
- Will remain long in samsara

[11255] <philology> Negative Particle: *Mi ldan par*
**Examination:** *Mi ldan par* (without possessing) establishes the prerequisite condition, negated in false practitioners.

<concept>
Special Instruction for Thodgal Practitioners
**Syntactic Structure:** For *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) meditation yogins, these signs certainly arise without deception (*grol nges bslu ba med par 'byung*). Therefore, special effort (*brtson 'grus khyad par can*) is instructed.

[11266] <philology> Emphatic Particle: *De'ang*
**Hermeneutical Frame:** *De'ang* (even that) introduces an additional consideration beyond the previous warning.

<context>
Final Citation on Familiarization
**Philological Analysis:** The citation from *De las* emphasizes:
- Familiarization with expanse and awareness (*dbyings rig goms pa*) is precious
- Whoever familiarizes with expanse and awareness
- The previously explained signs will certainly arise
- Practice with diligence (*nan tan bya*)

[11273] <architectural-analysis> Transition to Third General Meaning
**Morphological Breakdown:** Line 11273 initiates the third general meaning (*spyi don gsum pa*): summarizing signs of liberation/confusion in bardo and future lives. This is structured in two parts (*gnyis te*).

[11273] <philology> Enumerative Particle: *La gnyis te*
**Architectural Analysis:** *La gnyis te* (regarding [this], two [divisions]) marks structural subdivision.

<structure>
Two Divisions of the Third General Meaning
**Close Reading:** The third general meaning comprises:
1. *Dang po* (line 11274-11278): Signs of yogins liberated and attaining awakening
2. *Gnyis pa* (line 11275): Signs of six realms' beings taking rebirth through confusion

Each has two subdivisions (*gnyis te*): brief presentation (*mdor bstan*) and extensive explanation (*rgyas par bshad*).

<concept>
Two Types of Parinirvana in Dzogchen
**Consideration:** The text presents two Dzogchen approaches to awakening (*sangs rgya lugs gnyis*):

1. **Manifestly Complete Awakening** (*mngon par rdzogs par sangs rgyas pa*):
   - Occurs through sign-appearance (*rtags snang bas*)
   - With remainder of form aggregate (*rdos bcas kyi lhag ma*)
   - Nirvana with remainder (*lhag ma dang bcas pa'i mya ngan las 'das pa*)
   - Results from incomplete diligence (*brtson 'grus dman pas*)

2. **Truly Complete Awakening** (*yang dag par rdzogs par sangs rgyas pa*):
   - Through excellent diligence and pure remainder (*brtson 'grus rab rdos bcas dag pas*)
   - Nirvana without remainder (*phung po'i lhag ma med par mya ngan las 'das pa*)

<philology>
Structural Particles: *La...te...o*
**Technical Examination:** The pattern *la gnyis te* / *dang* / *o* creates nested enumeration: "regarding [this], two [divisions]: brief and extensive presentation."

[11274] <philology> Agentive Construction: *Rnal 'byor pa grol bas*
**Investigation:** *Grol bas* (through/by liberation) marks agency: the yogin who is liberated, through that liberation, attains the signs of awakening.

<philology>
Causal Construction: *Kyis...kyang*
**Hermeneutical Frame:** The instrumental *-s* in *bsgoms kyang* (even though meditated) establishes the concessive: despite having meditated on dharmata, incomplete diligence prevented reaching the measure.

[11283] <context> Source Citation: *Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long gi rgyud*
**Detailed Analysis:** This citation from the Vajrasattva Heart-Mirror Tantra establishes the two types of nirvana as scriptural authority.

<concept>
Five Manifestations at Death
**Investigation:** For the manifestly complete awakened person, five signs arise:
1. *'Od* - light
2. *Sgra* - sound
3. *Gdung* - relics/stupa
4. *Sku* - form/body
5. *Sa g.yo ba* - earth trembling

<context>
Citation from *Sku gdung 'bar ba*
**Technical Examination:** This verse citation elaborates external signs (*phyi yi rtags*):
- Intelligent accomplished person (*skyes bu blo rtsal rab*)
- Elements dissolve to their own ground (*'byung ba rang gi sar dengs*)
- Result of own-nature (*ngo bo nyid kyi 'bras bu*)
- Contaminated aggregates become invisible (*zag bcas phung po mi snang*)
- Result transforms to its own ground
- After passing into nirvana: body, relics, light, sound, and earth trembling

<philology>
Parallel Enumeration
**Architectural Analysis:** The verse employs fivefold enumeration marked by *dang* conjunctions, creating a rhythmic catalogue of miraculous signs.

<structure>
Five Extensive Explanations
**Consideration:** The second subdivision presents five extensive explanations (*rgyas par bshad pa lnga*):
1. *Sku* - body
2. *Gdung* - relics/stupa
3. *'Od* - light
4. *Sgra* - sound
5. *Sa g.yo ba* - earth trembling

[11317] <structure> Subdivision Markers
**Architectural Analysis:** Line 11317 indicates the beginning of the first extensive explanation on body, with its own internal structure.

<structure>
Fivefold Presentation Format
**Consideration:** The analysis of bodily form (*sku*) follows the standard fivefold scholastic format:
1. *Ngo bo* - essence (lines 11322-11324)
2. *Dbye ba* - divisions (lines 11318, 11342-11343)
3. *Rgyu* - cause (lines 11360-11371)
4. *Gnas* - location (lines 11372-11378)
5. *'Bras bu* - result (line 11379)
