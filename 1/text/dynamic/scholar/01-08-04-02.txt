## Seven Ground Positions and Refutations

**Philosophical Context:** This passage presents the seven extreme views of the ground (gzhi) that Longchenpa systematically refutes before presenting his own view of inseparable primordial purity and spontaneous presence.

**First Three Assertions:**
1. **Consciousness-based:** Ground follows as momentary (skad cig ma), as having many thoughts (rtogs pa du ma), as under power of afflictions (nyon mongs rkyen dbang can)
2. **External-Internal:** Ground as grasped-grasper (gzung 'dzin), as six collections (tshogs drug), as one-sided (phyogs gcig)
3. **Single Expanse:** Ground cannot be single expanse (dbyings gcig) because it is an assembly of many (mang po tshogs pa)

**Refutation Method:** The passage employs the thal (absurd consequence) mode of Madhyamaka logic, examining each alternative:
- If appearance is external → ground would appear manifold externally
- If appearance is internal consciousness → ground would be momentary, conceptual, afflicted
- If aggregation of both → ground would be subject-object duality, six aggregates to abandon

**Key Logical Markers:**
- cir yang: whatever/anything
- rkyen dbang can: subject to conditions
- 'gal: contradiction

## Canonical Citation: Klong Drug Pa Tantra

**Verse Analysis:** The Six Expanses tantra addresses variegated appearance:
- "The Teacher spoke scattered above"—appearance appears manifold
- "Because it does not accord with the side"—contradicts partiality
- "Whose essence is that appearance"—essence and appearance non-different
- "Result is different, meaning is similar"—duality in formulation

**Key Terms:**
- khra bor: variegated/multicolored
- phyogs dang mi 'thad: unsuitable with partiality
- ngo bo: essence
- 'bras bu tha dad: result different
- mang ba'i sgra yis: corrupted by manifold words

## Seventh Position: Primordial Purity Refutation

**Assertion:** Self-arising awareness wisdom (rig pa rang byung gi ye shes) is free from existence-nonexistence extremes (yod med kyi mtha' dang bral), not established anywhere (gang du'ang ma grub).

**Refutation Points:**
1. If nothing established → contradicts ground as source of samsara-nirvana (ci yang med na 'khor 'das 'byung ba'i dbyings su 'gal)
2. If no wisdom → no liberation for Buddhas and beings (ye shes med na sangs rgyas dang sems can gyi rnam grol med)
3. If no subtle five lights → no basis for appearances (phra ba'i 'od lnga med na gzhi snang 'char ba'i rgyu med)
4. If essence primordially pure → cyclic existence impossible (ngo bo nyid la ye dag pas sems can 'khor ba mi rigs)

**Canonical Citation:** "Because the essence itself is primordially pure, sentient beings' samsara is not logical. Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted."

**Conclusion:** The refutations demonstrate that total non-establishment leads to nihilism. Longchenpa's own view will present inseparability (dbyer med) of primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun grub).

**Technical Terminology:**
- thal ba: absurd consequence/logical implication
- yod med: existence-nonexistence
- ka dag: primordial purity
- lhun grub: spontaneous presence
- dbyer med: non-dual/inseparable
- 'od lnga: five lights (in Dzogchen cosmology)
- spros bral: freedom from elaborations
- thig le chen po: Great Bindu

**Doxographical Context:** This passage exemplifies the standard Tibetan philosophical method of presenting extreme positions (phyogs 'dzin) before refuting them (dgag pa). The seven ground positions represent the range of philosophical errors Longchenpa addresses: (1) spontaneous presence alone, (2) indeterminate, (3) unchanging like space, (4) transformable, (5) universally acceptable, (6) variegated appearance, (7) pure non-establishment. Each represents a partial truth elevated to an extreme.

**Madhyamaka Method:** The dialectical approach mirrors Madhyamaka prasanga—showing that each position leads to unacceptable consequences (thal ba) without asserting an alternative. This clears conceptual ground for the "non-dual basis" presentation that follows.

Longchenpa's own position will establish that the ground is neither pure unity nor pure multiplicity, but the inseparable union (dbyer med) of primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun grub).
