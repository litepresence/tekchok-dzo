Affliction and Karma Enumeration

**Anger Classifications:**
Anger, great anger, much anger, extreme anger—four from body each = sixteen.

**Pride Classifications:**
Pride small, coarse, changing, increasing, spreading—four also sixteen.

**Jealousy Classifications:**
Jealousy light, heavy, agitated, small—four divided = sixteen, altogether eighty.

From those specifically divided: element's different bodies five hundred twelve each with afflictions four-four's count twenty-twenty dwelling,
Altogether one ten-thousand and one hundred forty-eight,
Body and affliction both's numbers altogether one ten-thousand six hundred sixty definite objects of purification.

From *Rang shar*:
"Afflictions' enumeration thus
Body, speech, mind, consciousness
Earth, water, fire, wind
Various particularities definite
Purification empowerment definite"

**Karma Classifications:**
Body karma: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct.
Speech karma: lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, senseless speech.
Mind karma: covetousness, malice, wrong view.

Each with outer, inner, secret, completely perfect four = twelve.
Each with past, present, future three = thirty-six.

Like element and affliction enumeration, karma also definite.

<structural-mapping> Purification Enumeration and Empowerment Correspondence

<grammatical-examination>
Detailed Purification Framework

**Four Empowerments' Definite Purification:**
Four empowerments' purification definite: outer, inner, secret, completely perfect.
Each with three times, three doors, three realms.

Outer three times: past, present, future.
Inner three doors: body, speech, mind.
Secret three realms: desire, form, formless.
Completely perfect: dharmadhātu.

Thus four-four = sixteen.
Each with three = forty-eight.
With affliction-karma two = ninety-six.
With elaboration, etc., four = three hundred eighty-four.

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Four empowerments' definite divisions
Times, doors, realms definite
Affliction and karma two
Purification definite thus"

**Siddhi Classifications:**
Common siddhi: eight-fold—sword, pill, eye medicine, foot fast, underground, invisibility, sky-goer, immortality.

Supreme siddhi: rainbow body, liberation in dharmakāya.

Each siddhi with outer, inner, secret, completely perfect = thirty-two.
Each with method, prajñā = sixty-four.

Four Times and Purification Calculations

**Philological analysis:**
- **<context>** The 11,136 is correlated with four times (past, future, present, indefinite) producing 249 × 4 = 996. Combined with body-speech-mind non-dual (4) and three times (3), the total reaches 11,136 + 632 + 632 = complex numerology.

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *sku gsung thugs dbyer med pa* (body-speech-mind non-dual), *'das pa dang ma 'ongs pa dang da ltar byung ba dang ma nges pa'i dus bzhi* (four times: past, future, present, indefinite), *dbang nyis brgya brgyad cu rtsa dgu* (two hundred forty-nine empowerments), *khri chig stong tshig brgya dang sum cu rtsa drug* (eleven thousand one hundred thirty-six), *dag byed* (purifier), *dag bya 'gro ba'i lus mi 'dra ba bcu gnyis* (twelve different bodies of beings to be purified).

- **<concept>** The final calculation:
  - 11,136 purifiers
  - 632 body variations  
  - 632 affliction variations
  - Total: 12,400+
  
  The "intention" (*dgongs pa*) is to near completion of action's end—purifying the previous body and affliction divisions.

Unelaborated Fruition and Four Kayas

**Structural Mapping:**
- **<structure>** This passage describes the three degrees of unelaborated empowerment fruition: (1) extremely unelaborated produces awareness-definite-arrival, (2) completely unelaborated produces dharmatā-exhaustion appearance, (3) utterly unelaborated produces Buddha-ground connection. Then introduces the ultimate fruition: Vajradhara's ground with four kayas, four wisdoms, and thirty-two deities/wisdoms.

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *shin tu spros med kyis rig pa tshad phebs* (extremely unelaborated causes definite arrival of awareness), *rab tu spros med kyis chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba* (completely unelaborated produces dharmatā-exhaustion appearance), *phyi snang ba'i yon tan re dang nang nyams ting nge 'dzin re dang gsang ba lta dgongs khyad par can re dang yongs rdzogs bstan pa'i tshad re thob nas* (obtaining one outer appearance quality, one inner experience samadhi, one secret view-intention distinction, one complete teaching measure), *zag bcas mi snang bar sangs rgyas kyi sa la sbyor ba* (connect to Buddha-ground without visible outflows), *thun mong du gnas skabs kyi yon tan* (common intermediate attainments), *mthar thug gi 'bras bu* (ultimate fruition), *mgon po rdo rje 'chang gi sa* (Lord Vajradhara's ground), *sku gsung thugs mi zad pa rgyan gyi 'khor lo'i yon tan rdzogs par thob pa* (obtaining complete qualities of inexhaustible body-speech-mind ornament wheel), *sku dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa'i zhing khams mdor bstan* (brief showing of inseparable body-wisdom pure land), *bsam gyis mi khyab pa'i dbye ba rgyas par bshad* (extensive explanation of inconceivable divisions), *mngon par shes pa mtha' yas pas dbang bsgyur ba* (empowerment transformation through limitless superknowledges).

- **<concept>** 
  **Three Unelaborated Fruitions:**
  1. Extremely unelaborated: definite arrival of awareness; one outer appearance quality, one inner experience samadhi, one secret view-intention, one complete teaching measure obtained; without visible outflows, connect to Buddha-ground
  2. Completely unelaborated: dharmatā-exhaustion appearance
  3. Utterly unelaborated: same progression as above
  
  These are "common intermediate attainments" (*thun mong gnas skabs kyi yon tan*).
  
  **Ultimate Fruition:**
  - Vajradhara's ground
  - Inexhaustible body-speech-mind ornament wheel qualities complete
  - Three divisions: (1) inseparable body-wisdom pure land briefly shown, (2) inconceivable divisions extensively explained, (3) limitless superknowledges transformation
  
  **Thirty-Two from Thirty-Two Empowerments:**
  - Four signs, four measures, four ripened bodies = 12
  - Four wisdoms, four light-rays, four light-emanations, four fields = 16 + 12 = 28 + 4 = 32 ripened producing benefit
  - Path: obtained 32 empowerments
  - Four kayas: basis-abiding wisdom, characteristic-holding wisdom, all-knowing wisdom, all-aspect-knowing wisdom (4 × 4 = 16)
  - Four wisdom knowings (4 × 4 = 16) = 32 body-wisdom enumerations
  
  **Vajradhara's Sixteen Acts:** These 32 completions are Vajradhara's sixteen acts with sixteen wisdom objects.

Four Kayas' Perfections and Dharmakaya Presentation

**Structural Framework:**
- **<structure>** This passage describes the four pure lands (*zhing khams*) of the four kayas with five perfections (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga*) each, beginning detailed presentation of Dharmakaya: teacher, location, teaching, retinue, time, field, dharma, and activity.

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *bsam gyis mi khyab pa'i dbye bas rgyas par bshad pa* (extensive explanation through inconceivable divisions), *sku bzhi'i zhing khams phun sum tshogs pa lnga lnga* (four kayas' pure lands each with five perfections), *chos sku'i ston pa dpal kun tu bzang po* (Dharmakaya teacher glorious Samantabhadra), *gnas chos kyi dbyings* (location: dharmadhātu), *bstan pa sangs rgyas thams cad kyi thugs kyi bstan pa* (teaching: all Buddhas' mind teaching), *'khor 'dus ma byas pa* (retinue: unconditioned), *dus chos nyid la 'pho 'gyur med pa* (time: dharmatā without transition-change), *zhing khams rnam par dag pa de nyid dang brjod du med pa* (field: pure that itself and inexpressible), *chos brjod du med pa* (dharma: inexpressible), *'thad pa gang la gang 'dul du sprul pas na sprul sku'i* (valid: emanating to whatever needs taming, therefore Nirmanakaya), *rang gzhon gyi don gnyis rdzogs pa'i 'phrin las* (activity: completing two benefits for self and other), *phun sum tshogs pa lnga* (five perfections), *brjod du med pa dang lhun gyis grub pa gnyis* (inexpressible and spontaneous two), *dbang bzhi'i sa bon bzhi dang 'bras bu bzhi* (four empowerment seeds and four fruitions), *bcu drug smin pa* (sixteen maturations).

- **<concept>** 
  **Four Kayas' Pure Lands with Five Perfections Each:**
  - The four kayas' fields each have five perfections
  - 4 kayas × 5 perfections = 20 + 8 (inexpressible and spontaneous) = 28? Or: four empowerment seeds and four fruitions = 8; total sixteen maturations
  
  **Dharmakaya Valid Establishment:**
  - Teacher: Glorious Samantabhadra
  - Location: Dharmadhātu
  - Teaching: All Buddhas' mind teaching
  - Retinue: Unconditioned
  - Time: Dharmatā without transition-change
  - Field: Pure that itself and inexpressible
  - Dharma: Inexpressible
  - Valid: Because emanating to whatever needs taming, therefore called Dharmakaya
  - Activity: Through effortless spontaneous dharmatā door
  
  **Calculation:** Five perfections + inexpressible + spontaneous = 7? Or the five plus two aspects = Dharmakaya valid establishment. Four empowerment seeds + four fruitions = eight; sixteen maturations produce these.
