Three Gazes and Tantric Sources
**Philological analysis:** The section introduces the *gzhig stangs gsum* (three gazes) with multiple scriptural citations:
- *dPal nam mkha' dang mnyam pa'i rgyud* (4698): Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra—Dharmakaya gaze presses three realms' samsara
- *Yi ge med pa* (4704): Letterless—eye at sky element (*nam mkha'i khams*)
- *Gsang ba sgra rgyud* (4706-4710): Secret Sound Tantra—three gaze types: lower (*phab*), reverse (*bzlog*), corner (*zur*)

The typology at 4712-4714 maps gaze directions to soteriological targets:
- Nirmanakaya lower gaze → disciples (*gdul bya*)
- Sambhogakaya corner gaze → field-realms (*zhing khams*)
- Dharmakaya reverse gaze → base (*gzhi*)

This reflects the Sarma *phyag rgya chen po* (Mahamudra) gaze classifications, suggesting Nyingma-Sarma integration in Longchenpa's synthesis.

Physiological Typology and Gaze Selection
**Examination:** The text presents a medical-physiological (*gso rig*) typology for gaze selection:
1. **Poor eye faculty** (*mig shas ngan pa*): Nirmanakaya gaze—eye not dim (*mi 'grib*)
2. **Eye fault/affliction** (*mig la skyon chags*): Sambhogakaya gaze—eye clears (*gsal*)
3. **Good eye faculty** (*mig shas bzang*): Dharmakaya gaze—swift arrival at measure (*myur du snang ba tshad la phebs*)

This establishes *prakriti* (constitutional) discrimination adapted from Ayurvedic theory. The threefold eye typology (*spyan gsum*) at 4718 references the standard triad:
- Dharmata eye (*chos nyid kyi spyan*): speech
- Wisdom eye (*ye shes kyi spyan*): body
- Discriminating awareness eye (*shes rab kyi spyan*): mind

Three Eyes and Their Functions
**Examination:** The section presents a detailed analysis of the three eyes (*spyan gsum*) and their respective empowerments (*byin rlabs*). The structure follows a triadic pattern:
1. Dharmakaya eye empowerment (4720-4721): Enables direct seeing of wisdom
2. Sambhogakaya eye empowerment (4721-4723): Enables self-clear seeing, expands knowledge
3. Nirmanakaya eye empowerment (4723-4725): Enables seeing free from sound-words, dawns dharmata meaning

Each section uses the construction "eye exists in X, by its empowerment sees Y, result Z"—creating a formal logical structure. The section concludes with definitional analysis (*nges tshig*) at 4732-4733.

Particle Functions and Epistemic Markers
**Doxographical Placement:** The ablative *-las* in *'khor ba las grol* (4726, 4733) marks liberation-from, while the instrumental *-kyis* in *chos nyid kyi spyan* (4719) marks the eye as the agent of dharmata-seeing. The term *thag chod* (decided/resolved) at 4720 functions as an epistemic marker indicating certainty. The phrase *gsum du nges* (determined as three) at 4728, 4731 appears as a hermeneutical formula establishing the sufficiency of the triadic classification. The particle *ste* in *rtogs byed thams cad dag nas* (4725) marks the locus of purification: from all conceptual activity.

Technical Integration of Gaze and Liberation
**Investigation:** The three gazes are presented as technical operations:
1. **Dharmata eye upward gaze** (*chos nyid kyi spyan gyen la bzlog*): Clears latencies (*bag chags*) downward—the "upward" indicates transcendent direction
2. **Wisdom eye equal-corner gaze** (*ye shes kyi zur la mnyam por bltas*): Equalizes samsara-nirvana taste (*'khor 'das ro mnyam*)
3. **Discriminating awareness eye lowered gaze** (*shes rab kyis phab nas bltas*): Brings down wisdom vision (*ye shes kyi snang ba*)

The voice at 4728-4731 is Longchenpa's synthetic commentary, providing psychological (*blo*) correlations for gaze selection: laziness (*le lo*) → Sambhogakaya, diligence (*brtson 'grus*) → Nirmanakaya, equanimity (*btang snyoms*) → Dharmakaya. This reflects *kusala-mula* (skillful root) typology from Abhidharma.

Field-Pith: Outer and Inner Dimensions
**Consideration:** The section treats the second pith: field (*yul gyi gnad*). Two dimensions are established:
1. **Outer field** (4734-4740): Sky-space empty, separate from clouds (*sprin dang bral ba*)
2. **Inner field** (4735-4742): Between eyebrows (*smin mtshams*) at *mdzod spu* (treasure-hair/urna)

The inner field creates specific visionary experiences (*dbyings snang mthing ga*—blue dhatu-vision) and the five radiances (*'od lnga*). The text at 4743-4745 establishes the non-dual (*gnyis su med*) nature of awareness and experience (*rig pa dang nyams*), calling this "samsara-nirvana mixed" (*'khor 'das 'dres pa*). This reflects the *advaya* (non-dual) position distinguishing Dzogchen from Madhyamaka's *advaita* (non-difference).

The prohibition at 4746-4748 against using coarse elements (*'byung bzhi'i dngos po*) as objects reflects the critique of *kasina* practices and similar concentration techniques in favor of "objectless" (*yul med*) meditation.
