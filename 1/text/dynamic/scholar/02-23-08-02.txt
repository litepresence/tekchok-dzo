Second: Realization Arises
Sequential marker indicating the second stage: realization emerging from initial recognition.

[14589] <philology>
*gnyis pa la rtogs pa skyes* — "Second: realization arises." *rtogs pa* (realization) from *rtogs* (to penetrate/understand), with *skyes* (arises/born) indicating dynamic emergence rather than static possession.

[14589] <context>
Continues the progression in Chapter 23 from recognition to realization. In Dzogchen, recognition (*ngos 'dzin*) is initial knowing, while realization (*rtogs pa*) represents stable, irreversible understanding through familiarization.

[14589] <concept>
The arising (*skyes*) of realization indicates transition from contrived (*bcos ma*) to uncontrived (*ma bcos*) recognition. Realization dawns like sunrise illuminating what was always present—maturation of insight into spontaneous wisdom.
