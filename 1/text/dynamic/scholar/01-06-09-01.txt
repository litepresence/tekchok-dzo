Durkhrod Tragtsal Gyü Citation

The citation from Durkhrod Tragtsal Gyü (dur khrod khang bu brtsegs pa'i rgyud):
"Byang sems thig le la sbyangs pas / mchog dang thun mong yon tan rnams / rang gi sems la gang 'dod pa / 'di yis nges par 'grub par 'gyur"

This establishes the textual authority for thigle refinement practices and their results.

<grammatical-examination>
Conventional-Ultimate Distinction

The text employs ontological vocabulary:
- "Kun rdzob" (conventional): Relative level
- "Don dam" (ultimate): Absolute level
- "Sbyangs pa" (refined): Purified state
- "'Byongs pa" (released): Liberated state

The particle "ni" marks distinction: "don dam pa byang chub kyi sems 'byongs pas ni" (as for ultimate bodhicitta release). The instrumental "kyis" indicates means.

<concept>
Progressive Unfoldment of Powers

The powers develop sequentially:
1. Rtsa 'byongs: Physical health foundation
2. Rlung 'byongs: Energetic capacity
3. Thig le 'byongs: Essence mastery
4. Integration: All powers manifest

This progression reflects the natural unfoldment of subtle body mastery from coarse to subtle.

Unelaborated and Elaborated Distinctions

The text employs classification vocabulary:
- "Spros med" (unelaborated/without elaboration): Beyond constructs
- "Spros bcas" (elaborated/with elaboration): Constructed methods
- "Dkyil 'khor" (mandala): Sacred enclosure
- "'Jug pa" (entry): Initiation
- "Smin pa" (ripening): Maturation

The particle "ni" marks distinction: "'di spros med gsang dbang ste / ngag gi gnas dag pa yi ge dang rtsa 'tsir ba'i bde bas ngo sprod pa'o" (this is unelaborated secret empowerment: speech place purification through syllable and channel-pressing bliss introduction). The emphatic "ste" marks definition.

<concept>
Progressive Recognition Through Unelaboration

The progression moves from:
1. Ritual → Essence
   - Spros bcas: Full mandala, implements, sequence
   - Spros med: Direct essence extraction

2. External → Internal
   - Phyi: Observable actions
   - Nang: Subtle processes

3. Constructed → Natural
   - Gsang: Beyond ordinary perception
   - Yongs rdzogs: Complete naturalness

This follows the tantric principle of dbang (ripening) leading to grol (liberation).

Four Empowerments: Ripening Signs Example

This section presents the example (dpe) of ripening signs (smin pa'i rtags) to illustrate the four empowerments through the analogy of seed growth. The structure moves from agricultural metaphor to spiritual maturation, establishing the natural law (rang bzhin) of empowerment effectiveness.

<philology>
Agricultural and Ripening Terminology

The text employs metaphorical vocabulary:
- "Zhing sa" (field ground): Suitable vessel
- "Sa bon" (seed): Empowerment potential
- "Skyon med" (without fault): Unobstructed capacity
- "Btab pa" (planted): Bestowed, deposited
- "Smin pa" (ripened): Matured, fructified

The particle "ni" marks metaphor: "dpe na zhing sa bzang po la sa bon skyon med btab pas 'bras bu smin pa ltar" (for example, just as a faultless seed planted in good field ground ripens as fruit). The comparative "ltar" establishes analogy.

<concept>
Sonic-Energetic Correspondence

The integration operates through:
1. Yi ge gsum (three syllables):
   - Sonic forms of three vajras
   - Correspond to three centers
   - Activate three aspects

2. Rlung gi 'phen sdu (wind projection-withdrawal):
   - 'Phen (projection): Extension, engagement
   - Sdu (withdrawal): Retraction, stabilization
   - Balances activity and rest

3. Combined effect:
   - Sgra (sound) directs rlung (wind)
   - Rlung activates thig le (drop)
   - Thig le realizes ye shes (wisdom)

- "Snyoms 'jug" (equipoise): Post-meditation state
- "Rlung thub thang" (wind stability): Retained energy
- "Mi 'gro ba" (not go/dissipate): Maintained state
- "Lus stobs rgyas" (body power expands): Strengthened capacity

The particle "ni" marks technique: "snyoms 'jug de la skyo na gyan la drangs te" (if weary of that equipoise, draw upward). The conditional "na" indicates circumstance.

Four Empowerments' Ripening Power

Four empowerments' ripening time ripening signs impure and pure two included—gathered into space and field two.

Attachment, hatred, neutral three, time three gathered—body, speech, mind three ripening activity liberated.

Samsara-nirvana dharmas contaminated, uncontaminated two empowered—two arisen:
- Empowerment over appearance purifies aggregates, constituents, sense-bases, etc.
- Empowerment over existence purifies afflictions

With elaboration shows body, speech, mind, consciousness four entering activities.
Without elaboration shows four: obtaining, abiding, stabilizing, closely realizing.
Greatly without elaboration shows four causes/conditions of body, speech, mind, consciousness ripening.
Utterly without elaboration shows four: three doors matured into deity body, speech, mind and engaging in inexpressible meaning.

**Four Empowerments' Ripening Example:**
Like good field sown with faultless seeds ripening fruit—first with elaboration empowerment sows seed, without elaboration sprout emerges and leaves spread, greatly without elaboration flower blooms, utterly without elaboration four bodies definite fruit ripens.

Four Empowerments Classification

The four-fold structure:
1. Spros bcas (elaborated): Vase empowerment with full ritual
2. Spros med (unelaborated): Secret empowerment with mantra
3. Shin tu spros med (thoroughly unelaborated): Wisdom-knowledge
4. Rab tu spros med (completely unelaborated): Word empowerment

This follows:
- Guhyasamaja: Progressive subtlety
- Hevajra: Four abhisheka
- Nyingma: Integration with Atiyoga

<philology>
Conventional-Ultimate Distinction Markers

The text employs ontological vocabulary:
- "Kun rdzob" (conventional): Relative, apparent
- "Don dam" (ultimate): Absolute, real
- "Sbyangs pa" (refined): Purified through practice
- "'Byongs pa" (released): Liberated from binding

The particle "ni" distinguishes: "kun rdzob byang chub kyi sems 'byongs pa'i nus pa'o" (this is the power of conventional bodhicitta release). The emphatic "o" marks definition.

<philology>
Thorough Unelaboration and Distinction Terms

The text employs ultimate vocabulary:
- "Shin tu spros med" (thoroughly unelaborated): Beyond all constructs
- "'Khor 'das" (samsara-nirvana): Cyclic existence and liberation
- "Ru shan 'byed" (distinguish/part): Separate, discriminate
- "Rang rig" (self-awareness): Intrinsic knowing
- "Ka dag" (primordial purity): Original purity

The particle "ni" marks method: "shin tu spros med kyi dbang ni 'khor 'das ru shan phyed nas" (thoroughly unelaborated empowerment distinguishes samsara-nirvana). The instrumental "gis" indicates means.

**Summary:**

Page 206 presents Great Mudra realization, thigle retention methods, channel opening signs, the five stages of blissful wisdom, and three kaya stabilization. Philologically, the text employs causative and resultative constructions, ordinal enumeration, and achievement terminology. Contextual sources include Hevajra, Guhyasamaja, Kalachakra, Durkhrod Tragtsal Gyü, and Dzogchen systems. Conceptually, the section demonstrates the progression from four mudras to Great Mudra, the indicators of successful thigle practice, the five-fold dissolution of bliss, and the stabilization of view in the three kaya ground.

Agricultural Metaphor in Dharma

The seed-field-fruit metaphor derives from:
- Early Buddhist texts: Karma as seed, mind as field
- Yogacara: Alaya-vijnana as ground, bijas as seeds
- Tantra: Dbang as seed, practice as cultivation
- Nyingma: Natural fruition without effort

The metaphor establishes:
- Field (zhing): Disciple's capacity
- Seed (sa bon): Empowerment blessing
- Cultivation (skyed): Post-empowerment practice
- Fruit ('bras bu): Realization attainment
