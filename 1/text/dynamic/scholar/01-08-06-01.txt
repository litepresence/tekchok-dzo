## Refutation of Objections: Two-Part Dialectical Architecture

**Architectural Context:** The text addresses dispelling objections (rtsod pa spang ba), organized into two divisions following the standard Indian śāstra format of objections and responses (pūrvapakṣa-uttarapakṣa).

**Two Major Divisions:**
1. First: Objections regarding counting—whether the ground is eightfold or not
2. Second: Objections regarding the nature itself (rang ngo)

**Logical Structure:** The passage employs the thal (absurd consequence) mode of logical inference characteristic of the Madhyamaka tradition.

<philology>
**Key Terms:**
- rtsod pa: debate, objection
- thal: absurd consequence—prasaṅga mode of inference
- lan: answer, response
- ka dag: primordial purity
- lhun gyis grub: spontaneous presence
- dbyer med: non-dual, inseparable

<context>
**The Eight Grounds Controversy:** Longchenpa's system presents seven grounds (gzhi bdun). The objection suggests primordial purity and spontaneous presence might be counted as separate grounds, expanding to eight.

**Longchenpa's Response:** These are not separate grounds but dual aspects of a single ground—essence (ngo bo) and nature (rang bzhin). Thus the sevenfold schema remains intact.

**Non-Duality Preserves Enumeration:**
- If ka dag and lhun gyis grub were SEPARATE grounds → enumeration expands to eight
- Since they are DUAL ASPECTS of a SINGLE ground → sevenfold structure remains intact

This exemplifies the Madhyamaka principle that non-duality does not obliterate conventional distinctions—while ultimate reality is non-dual, conventional enumeration remains valid.
