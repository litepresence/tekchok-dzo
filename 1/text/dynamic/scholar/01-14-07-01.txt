# Structural Marker: First Division of Wisdom Lamps
**Analysis:** This minimal structural entry (*dang po*) initiates the first division within Chapter 14, Section 7 on the four wisdom lamps (*ye shes kyi sgron ma bzhi*). The phrase *'od kyi snam bur snang ba* (appearance as a mass/field of light) indicates this section addresses the first lamp—likely the bindu-empty lamp (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*) or the wisdom self-arisen lamp (*shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*)—which appears as luminous display. The structure suggests this is a transitional marker introducing detailed analysis of the four lamps that serve as the support (*rten*) for wisdom recognition.

**Analysis:** The construction *dang po* (first) without continuative particle (*ni* or *ste*) suggests this is a heading or list entry rather than a complete sentence. The phrase *'od kyi snam bur* employs the genitive *kyi* to create the attributive relationship—light's field/mass (*snam bu* means field, canvas, or mass). The term *snang ba* (appearance/manifestation) appears as the substantive, indicating that which appears as a field of light. This locative construction (*-r*) indicates the manner of appearance—appearing AS a field of light. The brevity suggests this marks a subsection within a larger topical framework.

**Analysis:** This marker appears within Chapter 14 on Wisdom (*ye shes*), specifically Section 7 which presents the four wisdom lamps (*ye shes sgron ma bzhi*) as supports for recognizing the nature of mind. The four lamps are: (1) bindu-empty lamp (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*)—the white and red essences in the heart; (2) awareness-expanse lamp (*rig pa dbyings kyi sgron ma*)—the ground of all appearance; (3) wisdom self-arisen lamp (*shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*)—natural clarity; (4) far-cast water lamp (*rgyang zhag chu'i sgron ma*)—the eyes as windows of wisdom. This "first" marker introduces the analysis of the first lamp, establishing the *gsum ldan* (threefold) hermeneutic: external (*phyi*), internal (*nang*), and secret (*gsang*) aspects of each lamp.

**Analysis:** The four wisdom lamps represent the *gzhi lam 'bras gsum* (ground, path, result) supports for wisdom recognition in *rDzogs chen* practice. The first lamp—appearing as a field/mass of light—corresponds to the *thig le* (bindu/essence) dimension: white element (*dkar po*) descending from father, red element (*dmar po*) ascending from mother, united in the heart center (*snying ga*). This field of light (*'od kyi snam bu*) is the ground (*gzhi*) from which all appearances arise, the basis for recognizing *rig pa* (awareness). The lamp metaphor (*sgron ma*) indicates both illumination—making visible what was hidden—and support—providing the basis for recognition. This first lamp specifically supports the recognition of *ngo bo* (essence) as empty yet luminous.
