Technical Terminology of Speech Restraint
**Analysis:** The term *bslab pa* (training) at 4601-4603 employs progressive intensification: first brief sessions (*thun chung ngu*), then extended (*ring du*). The verb *bcad pa* (cut) appears in multiple compounds: *smra rgyu bcad* (cutting speech), *brjod bya bcad* (cutting expression), establishing a semantics of restriction. The term *la bzla ba* (swallowing) at 4608 is glossed as "not uttering mantra" (*sngags la sogs pa brjod pa thams cad mi bya*), indicating total cessation of verbalization, not mere reduction. The particle *ste* (locative/instrumental) at 4609 marks the locus of stability: the state of non-speech (*ci yang mi brjod pa'i ngang*).

Scriptural Citations and Somatic Semiotics
**Analysis:** The citation from *Sa bon gyi rgyud* (Seed Tantra) at 4611-4620 presents a paradox: mind's projection and gathering (*sems kyi 'phro 'du*) self-cut (*rang chod*). This reflects the *ngo bo* (essence) teaching of Dzogchen—the nature of mind is self-liberating without deliberate intervention. The text at 4606-4607 introduces somatic semiotics (*lus kyi brdas*): when speech is restricted, meaning is conveyed through body-signs. This parallels the *mudra* systems of Buddhist tantra but in a Dzogchen-specific formulation where bodily communication replaces verbal in the advanced stages.

[4620-4631] <concept>
Purification Sequence and Siddhi Attainment
**Analysis:** The section presents a four-stage progressive model:
1. **Speech cutting** (4620-4622): Body purified, receives blessings (*byin gyis brlabs*) from buddhas and dakinis, liberates into illusory body (*sgyu ma'i skur grol*)
2. **Expression blocking** (4621-4625): Speech purified, meets signs (*brda phrad*) with non-humans (*mi ma yin*), conversations arise
3. **Mind cutting** (4622-4624): Mind purified, attains clairvoyance (*mngon par shes pa*), "bundle-pieces" (*dum bu pa*) arise
4. **Integration** (4625-4631): Speech pith cuts body-mind connection (*lus sems kyi 'brel gcod pa*), establishing the *gnad kyi gdams pa* (pith instruction)

The three-stage purification (body → speech → mind) mirrors the standard Buddhist path but accelerates it through Dzogchen's direct approach.

Mind Pith and Three Piths Summary
**Analysis:** The section transitions to the third of the three piths (*gnad gsum*): mind (*sems*). The structure follows a pattern of scriptural citation, explanation, summary verse:
1. Citation from *Thal 'gyur* (4632-4633): Body, speech, and mind bound
2. Citation from tantra (4636-4638): Knowing and relying on the three piths liberates from samsara
3. Transition to second main topic (*don gnyis pa*) at 4639

The term *don gnyis pa* (second meaning/topic) marks a major structural division, indicating the text moves from general introduction of the three piths to specific applications.

[4639-4651] <philology>
Technical Terminology of Direct Introduction
**Analysis:** The phrase *mngon sum rang thog tu dbab pa* (delivering direct to self-point) at 4639 uses *thog* (point/vertex) in a technical Dzogchen sense meaning direct, unmediated recognition. The term *rdz rje'i chings* (vajra binding) at 4640 suggests indestructible constraint—binding the three piths so they become inseparable from practice. The metaphorical triad at 4658-4660 employs folk terminology:
- *Sos* (sling/snare) for gate-pith: captures (*zin*) non-changing
- *'Gron po* (traveler/messenger) for field-pith: creates unavoidable encounter
- *Jag* (thief/bandit) for wind-awareness-pith: seizes (*tshud*) the mark-measure

The particle *'dra* (like/similar) in each line establishes simile as the primary mode of explanation.

Source Citations and Comparative Doctrines
**Analysis:** The citation at 4646-4651 from *Thal 'gyur* establishes the three piths (*gnad gsum*) as: gate (*sgo*), field (*yul*), and wind-awareness (*rlung rig*). This formulation appears in Nyingma *Thalgyur* texts but differs from Sarma (New Translation) formulations that typically emphasize channels (*rtsa*), winds (*rlung*), and drops (*thig le*). The text at 4661-4663 presents the three piths as both sufficient (*gsum du nges*) and necessary—more causes loss (*gnad stor*), less causes incompleteness (*don mi 'grub*). This reflects the "middle way" (*dbu ma*) logic applied to contemplative technique.

[4664-4672] <concept>
Interdependence of the Three Piths
**Analysis:** The section establishes logical dependencies:
1. **Without field** (*yul med na*): No support-base (*rten sa'i gzhi*)
2. **Without gate** (*sgo med na*): Lost path for wandering (*'gro ba'i lam*)
3. **Without wind-awareness** (*rlung rig gi gnad med na*): Awareness doesn't dissolve internally (*shes rig nang du mi chod*)

This creates a functional interdependence: field provides ground, gate provides access, wind-awareness provides dynamic energy. The text at 4669-4672 divides the second topic into: (1) establishing the general sequence (*spyi'i chings*) of the three piths, and (2) delivering to individual piths (*so so'i gnad*). The sequence (*rim pa*) requires body, speech, and mind to be unmoving (*mi 'gul*) while binding gate, field, and wind-awareness—establishing the *gnad gsum* as simultaneous requirements, not sequential stages.

[4673-4688] <structure>
Scriptural Citations Supporting Three Piths
**Analysis:** The section presents three scriptural authorities establishing the three piths practice:
1. *Rang byung rig pa'i tantra* (4673-4678): Self-Arising Awareness Tantra—pressing piths enables direct awareness
2. *Thal 'gyur* (4680-4688): From Thalgyur—relying on body, speech, and mind piths severs the body-mind connection
3. Summary verse (4689-4692): Gate (three bodies' eye), field (separate from obscuration), wind-awareness (accomplishes wisdom through slowness)

The *mthong ba rgyud pa'i lung* (lineage scripture of vision) at 4673 indicates this teaching derives from the *sNang ba rgyud* (Vision Tantra), one of the three major divisions (*sde gsum*) of Atiyoga.

[4673-4692] <philology>
Verse Structure and Technical Terms
**Analysis:** The citation from *Rang byung rig pa'i tantra* (4674-4678) uses *-yis* (instrumental) to mark the agent of pressing (*gzir ba*): body (*lus*) etc. pressed completely (*rab tu*) enables direct awareness (*mngon sum*). The particle *la* in *bzhugs stangs la* (4692) marks the object of harmonization. The term *bzlog* (reverse/turn back) at 4686 appears in both transitive and intransitive senses—wind reversal (*rlung bzlog*) as the agent severs connection (*'brel chad*). The summary verse at 4689-4692 uses appositional syntax: gate (*sgos*) is three bodies' eye (*sku gsum mig*), establishing equivalency rather than possession.

[4693-4695] <context>
Three Gazes and Tantric Sources
**Analysis:** The section introduces the *gzhig stangs gsum* (three gazes) with multiple scriptural citations:
- *dPal nam mkha' dang mnyam pa'i rgyud* (4698): Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra—Dharmakaya gaze presses three realms' samsara
- *Yi ge med pa* (4704): Letterless—eye at sky element (*nam mkha'i khams*)
- *Gsang ba sgra rgyud* (4706-4710): Secret Sound Tantra—three gaze types: lower (*phab*), reverse (*bzlog*), corner (*zur*)

The typology at 4712-4714 maps gaze directions to soteriological targets:
- Nirmanakaya lower gaze → disciples (*gdul bya*)
- Sambhogakaya corner gaze → field-realms (*zhing khams*)
- Dharmakaya reverse gaze → base (*gzhi*)

This reflects the Sarma *phyag rgya chen po* (Mahamudra) gaze classifications, suggesting Nyingma-Sarma integration in Longchenpa's synthesis.
