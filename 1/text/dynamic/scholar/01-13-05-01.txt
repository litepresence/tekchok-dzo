# Familiarization Method Section
**Consideration:** Longchenpa presents the sixth topic (*goms tshul*): the method of familiarization. The procedure involves:
1. Separating samsara-nirvana boundary (*'khor 'das ru shan phye*)
2. Placing body-speech in natural state (*lus ngag rnal du phab*)
3. Introducing awareness in the sphere's fence directly (*dbyings kyi ra bar rig pa bcu*)
4. Continuous practice day-night (*nyin mtshan med par*)

Progressive stages of appearance:
- First: merely mirror-like light (*od me long tsam*)
- Then: portions (*dum bu*)
- Then: land-area extent (*yul gru tsam*)
- Then: sky-filling (*nam mkha' gang ba*)
- Finally: whatever appears arises as sphere's appearance, seeing kayas until exhaustion of appearances

Citations from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (16872-16883) and *rang shar* (16884-16897) authenticate this progressive visionary unfolding.

**Summary:** Page 402 provides the definition, threefold classification, nature, characteristic, and familiarization method of the third lamp. The structural analysis reveals how Longchenpa maps the visionary experience through progressive stages from mirror-light to sky-filling appearances.

# Measure, Abode, and Door of the Third Lamp
**Investigation:** Longchenpa continues the eleven-topic analysis with:
- Seventh topic: Measure (*tshad*)
- Eighth topic: Abode (*gnas*)
- Ninth topic: Door (*sgo*)

**Measure (16898-16902):** Through practice, from nose-tip to eyebrow-midpoint space, blue spreading five-color under-barrel appearances, mirror-like, portions, vision-pervading inner kaya arising—this is the measure.

<context>
Extended citation from *gsang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*:
The citation (lines 16903-16949) provides detailed measurements and correlations:
- Sphere and awareness gaze: unobstructed sky gaze
- Sphere's inside snake-noose placed, not separated
- Who sees thus equals Samantabhadra
- Bindu seen, gaze directed upward, appearance progresses
- Four finger-widths from upper space: separated from body
- All appearing broken-vessel-like: attain emanation excellence
- Whatever appears as seen object: likewise to masses
- Outer appearance ceased: sixteen moments
- Unripened bindu to kaya: six, ten, five—definitely longs sku
- Inner body exhausted reaching place: likewise fingers, etc.
- Here directed, elements naturally stopped
- Birth-entry distinction: all dharmas exhausted self-place
- Without grasping abides: emanation kaya
- This entering's force empowerment
- Who attains birth's self-power
- Appearance's own sound empty-sound
- Manifestly returns, appears as delusion
- Does all beings' benefit
- For awareness equal one
- Three-thousand great beings' transference
- Thus gradual and instantaneous body attainment
- All these exhausted measure liberation
- These all definite fruition
- Supreme ground great mandala attainment

This extensive citation establishes the precise correlations between visionary stages (*snang ba*) and resultant kayas (*sku*).

<context>
Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* and *rang shar*:
The measure is further elaborated through scriptural citation:
- Blue unchanging from appearance
- Five colors clear light
- This itself greatly clarifies
- Self front upper space
- Four finger-widths or body-height
- Transcending separation from body
- That becomes the measure

The *rang shar* citation (16960-16982) describes the arising and vision process:
- Appearance arising and self great wisdom examining
- Ye shes appearance kaya and ye shes directionless arising
- Arising manner thus:
  - First: merely mirror mandala
  - From that: appearance portions arise
  - From that: land-area arise
  - From that: sky-filling arise
  - Whatever appears light mandala
  - Arising, seeing form kaya time
  - All kaya mandalas from self-arise, self-emanate
  - Sky-filling appearances
  - Seeing dharmata not ceasing
  - Ye shes sky movement sign
  - Nature itself appearance
  - Essence itself kaya arising
  - Arising that itself self is
  - Buddha intent valid dharma
  - True thusness thus-gone
  - That shown as familiarization measure

<philology>
Abode (*gnas*) and Door (*sgo*):
- Ground's sphere: cit
- Path's sphere: *'bri gu ta* (bridge-channel)
- Fruition sphere: cloud-free sky

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (16988-17007) establishes:
- Eye without arising condition
- Abiding, self-awareness itself appears as snake-noose
- Cloud-free sky holding
- Self-knowing inner clear time
- Abides in cit's center
- Outer-projection cloud-free sky
- Eye consciousness pure
- Clarifying blazing five light rays
- Unchanging pervading manner
- Blue great self-resound abides
- This arises from eye
- Unchanging pervading manner appears
- This appearance self-pure
- Sphere and awareness union
- Primordially abides, resting meditation
- Self-arising self activity-field

**Summary:** Page 403 completes the measure, abode, and door topics of the third lamp. The extensive scriptural citations from *gsang ba spyod pa*, *sgron ma 'bar ba*, and *rang shar* provide authoritative correlations between visionary measurements and resultant states.

# Actual Lamp and Simile Sections
**Philological Analysis:** Longchenpa completes the third lamp's eleven-topic analysis with:
- Tenth topic: Actual (*dngos*)
- Eleventh topic: Simile (*mthun dpe*)

<concept>
The Actual Lamp (*dbyings kyi sgron ma dngos*):
The lamp actually arises from both eye corners, blue pervading great light, limitless. Inside, awareness-light abides in that house. Outside, snake-noose bindu empty with that fence abides. The five lights' appearance and rim's fence—both are the actual sphere.

Four non-affirming characteristics (*gnad bzhi*):
1. Without coarse entity (*dngos po rag par med*): not established as grasped object
2. Not severed emptiness (*chad pa phyang chad*): self-luminous like rainbow
3. Unharmed by elements (*'byung ba'i gnod pas mi shigs*): not compounded samsara
4. Possessing vital point (*gnad dang ldan*): seeing and familiarizing leads to primordial buddhahood

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17024-17046) establishes these characteristics through verses on vital points, suitable persons, samsara's upper space, entry from two corners, method and wisdom nature, ignorance as one finger, day-time element condition, night-time blue face conjoining, sphere's nature light house, unchanging great self-resound, buddhas and beings all, none made by anyone, primordially nondual equal abiding, from subtle abides, self-cognition arises, manifestly that greatly secret, great secret this itself, who wishes to practice, buddhahood even in primordial buddhahood.

<concept>
The Simile: Na-ro bird letter (*yi ge na ro*):
The simile compares the sphere lamp to the Tibetan letter na-ro (ནྲོ): two wings gathered as one bird-form. Similarly, outer blue sphere and appearance arising from it gathered together are called sphere lamp as one.

The *sgron ma 'bar ba* citation (17053-17062) provides the scriptural basis:
- Example like letter na-ro
- Two grasped and gathered as one
- Black changed, able to transform
- From that familiarization confidence obtained
- Intermediate space rainbow like
- Color unmixed completely perfect
- Then also familiarization power
- Possessing that sign
- Intermediate realm likewise thus

# Fourth Lamp Introduction: shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma
**Investigation:** Longchenpa inaugurates the fourth lamp: The Lamp of Self-Arising Wisdom (*shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*). The structural schema presents eight topics:
1. ngo bo (essence)
2. nges tshig (definition)
3. dbye ba (classification)
4. mtshan nyid (characteristic)
5. sgo (door)
6. gnas (abode)
7. tshad (measure)
8. mthun dpe (simile)

This reduced topic count (eight vs. eleven) indicates a shift toward the most subtle and self-recognized dimension of the four lamps.
