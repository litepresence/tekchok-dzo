[16274-16276] <philology>
Analysis of *'khor 'das gnyis ka'i cha 'dzin pas*:
The instrumental *kyis* following the genitive *ka'i* creates a compound causal construction: "by means of holding the parts of both samsara and nirvana." The term *dbang rten* (power-support) denotes the supporting condition for the arising of appearances, not the appearances themselves.

[16276-16282] <context>
Citation from *gser gyi me tog mdzes pa rin po che'i sgron ma 'bar ba'i rgyud* (*Beautiful Golden Flower: Blazing Jewel Lamp Tantra*). This tantra belongs to the esoteric *thod rgal* cycle of the *sNying thig* tradition. The verse employs the technical term *mthong byed* (seeing-agent) rather than *mig* (eye), indicating a distinction between the physical organ and the cognitive function of visual apprehension.

[16283-16292] <concept>
Etymological Analysis of *rgyang zhags* (Far-Casting Snare):

**Rgyang (Distance):**
- Holds (*'dzin*) the reflection of clarity (*'od gsal dngas pa'i gzugs brnyan*) and deluded appearances
- Casts samsara (*'khor ba*) with deluded thoughts far away
- Casts nirvana (*myang 'das*) far if not realized

**Zhags (Snare):**
- The particle *zhags* (*zhags pa*) functions as both noun (snare) and metaphorical extension
- Self-appearance (*rang snang*) binds impurity when seen
- Non-recognition (*ma rtogs*) binds self-awareness through attachment to deluded appearance

[16290-16292] <philology>
The comparative particle *lta bu* (like/as) following *chos mthun pa* (similar with the Dharma) establishes the rope-snare simile. The particle *kyang* in line 16292 functions as concessive: "although when examined..." This sets up the Madhyamika-style analysis that follows.

[16292] <context> The analysis of *'khrul snang* and *'khrul 'dzin* reflects the standard Yogācāra-Svātantrika distinction between deluded appearance and deluded apprehension. The phrase *dpyad na gzhi med* (when examined, groundless) invokes the emptiness of inherent nature (*ngo bo nyid kyis stong*).

[16293-16295] <philology>
Analysis of *ma brtags na* (if not examined):
The conditional *na* with the negative *ma* creates a hypothetical epistemic frame: the binding appears real to non-analytical cognition. The particle *las* following *snang ba* in 16294 and 16295 is ablative: "from the time of appearing bound/liberated" — indicating temporal origination rather than simple cessation.

[16293-16295] <concept>
The Paradox of Liberation:
Longchenpa presents a dialectical structure:
1. When unexamined, mind and appearance appear as binding self-awareness
2. When appearing bound, there is no binding (appearance ≠ existence)
3. When appearing liberated, there is no liberating agent (no inherent nature)
4. Therefore, liberation does not exist as a thing

This parallels the Prasaṅgika analysis of bondage and liberation as mere dependent designations.

[16296-16302] <context>
Citation from *sgyu 'phrul* (Illusion/Māyā) tantra:
The quoted verse employs the double-negation structure typical of Nyingma *thod rgal* literature: "Not bound, binding does not exist" (*sus yang ma bcings bcings med de*). The phrase *ye nas lhun rdzogs* (primordially spontaneously complete) grounds the soteriological claim in the Dzogchen view of original buddhahood (*ye nas sangs rgyas*).

[16303-16305] <philology>
Analysis of *yas su mi 'jug pa* (not entering into vastness):
The term *yas* (vast) derives from *yas pa* (expanse/scope), with the negative *mi* indicating non-appropriation. The instrumental *kyis* in *'ching bas* establishes the binding function: "by means of the binding [of what does not enter into vastness]."

The term *rlan* (moisten) in 16304 functions metaphorically — the water element moistens through the bliss of samādhi (*ting nge 'dzin*), indicating that "water" refers to the non-attachment that "waters" the mind rather than a literal aqueous substance.

[16306-16309] <concept>
The Fourfold Naming (*ming bzhi*) of the Lamp:
Longchenpa establishes four etymological justifications (*nges tshig*):

1. **Chu** (Water): Non-attachment returns to its own place; the samādhi-bliss moistens
2. **Chu**: Relies on gathered clarity (*dngas ma 'dus pa*)
3. **Ma** (Mother): Not the base of producing appearances of space-awareness
4. **Ma**: The clear sense powers serve as the supporting base for viewing

The negative *ma yin* in 16308 is emphatic: "is definitively not" — excluding the mistaken view that appearances arise from the base.

[16310-16343] <context>
Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (*Blazing Lamp Tantra*):
The tantric citation provides etymological glosses (*nges pa'i tshig*) for each component:

**Rgyang** (Distance):
- Holds distant continuums of form-appearance
- Gathers colors, etc.
- The awareness-body (*rig pa'i sku*) also [appears] from far distance
- Makes the seer hold [appearances]
- From the side of samsara-thought, casts far — thus "far"
- Likewise from the side of non-realization, casts nirvana — thus "far"

**Zhags** (Snare):
- From samsara's appearance-aspects: forms and the five desire-objects are bound by this — thus "snare"
- The appearance of the sense-power holding memory and thought as self by this — "snare" holds from a distance
- Likewise in the sky free of clouds: awareness appearing as selfless body, not entering into the vast appearance — holding by this is called "snare"

**Chu** (Water):
- When attachment returns to its own place in these appearances
- When there is no mind of attachment to all
- When appearances are left in their own place
- Through freedom from self-grasping — called "water"

**Sgron** (Lamp):
- All self-appearances increasing above from above
- Lamp through the clarity of awareness' pristine wisdom
- All appearances of coarse elements
- Self-knowing experience not ceasing
- Lamp through clarity at the self-door of the sense-power
- Setting awareness in outer space
- Inner space pure in its own place
- Appearances

This extended citation demonstrates the tantric basis for Longchenpa's hermeneutical framework.

[16342-16343] <philology>
The construction *phyi yi dbyings bzhag pas* (having set [awareness] in outer space) employs the perfective *bzhag* with the instrumental *pas*, indicating a completed action that results in the purification of inner space.

[16344-16350] <philology>
Analysis of verse structure:
The particle *ste* (16344) functions as continuative, suspending meaning across the line break — a formal marker of verse (*tshig bcad*) style. The phrase *dbyings rigs 'dres pas* (space-race mixed) employs *rigs* (race/type) in the tantric sense of "aspect" or "category," not ethnic or biological race.

[16344-16350] <context>
The term *ma* (mother) here operates within the Nyingma *thod rgal* technical vocabulary: the "mother" is the supporting base (*rten gzhi*) for all sense powers, not a procreative metaphor. The *mu tig 'phreng ba* (*Pearl Garland Tantra*) citation establishes this as scriptural authority for the terminology.

[16351-16367] <structure>
# Threefold Classification of the Water Lamp
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes a tripartite typology (*dbye ba rnam pa gsum*):

1. **'Byung ba 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags** — Element-gathered Far-Casting Snare
   - Arises from the essence of wind (*rlung gi dngas ma*)
   - Root is like ram-horn (*ba men gyi rwa*)

2. **Ye shes 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags** — Pristine-awareness-gathered Far-Casting Snare
   - Holds the colors of pristine awareness
   - Does not hold deluded appearances

3. **Dbang po 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags** — Sense-power-gathered Far-Casting Snare
   - The essence of the five sense powers in the center of the eye's "a-berry"
   - Produces the power-support clarity as what sees forms
   - Does not see pristine awareness appearances

[16355-16359] <philology>
Analysis of *dbang po'i dngas ma mig gi a 'bras dkyil na*:
The term *a 'bras* (a-berry) is a technical anatomical term in Tibetan medical and tantric literature, referring to the crystalline structure within the eye. The genitive chain (*dbang po'i dngas ma mig gi a 'bras*) creates a nested structure: "the essence of the sense powers [within] the eye's a-berry."

[16356-16360] <concept>
The distinction between *chos can* and *chos nyid*:
Longchenpa asserts that the actual (*dngos*) Water Lamp is the second category (pristine-awareness-gathered), while the other two function merely as supporting conditions (*rten byed pa'i cha nas*). This reflects the Dzogchen distinction between the apparent phenomenon (*chos can*) and the definitive nature (*chos nyid*).

The phrase *'di shes pa gal che'o* (16360) — "knowing this is extremely important" — is an emphatic pedagogical marker typical of Longchenpa's autocommentary style.

[16361-16367] <context>
Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The tantric citation confirms the threefold classification using parallel structure:
- *'byung ba'i dngas ma rang 'dus pa'i rgyang zhag chu yi sgron ma*
- *ye shes 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags*
- *dbang po 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags*

[16368-16373] <structure>
# Characteristics Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa distinguishes:
- General characteristic (*spy'i mtshan nyid*): produces capable form-appearance as object-appearance
- Own characteristics (*rang gi mtshan nyid*): threefold corresponding to the three classifications

[16371-16373] <concept>
The three own characteristics:
1. **Element-gathered**: Abides in the aspect of gathering, holding, and expanding appearance
2. **Pristine-awareness-gathered**: Holds the self-appearance of light-clarity clearly
3. **Sense-power-gathered**: Holds appearance, appearance-object, and eye-consciousness self-knowing

[16374-16379] <philology>
Distinction between *snang ba* and *snang yul*:
Longchenpa clarifies the technical terminology:
- *Snang ba*: initially appears as object — placed as mountains, etc.
- *Snang yul*: object's own characteristics — rocks, etc.
- *Snang ba shes pa*: consciousness free of thought, aspect of sign-names
- *Snang yul*: object self-characterized, inert abiding, etc.

This distinction reflects the standard Sautrāntika-Yogācāra epistemological framework adapted for *thod rgal* context.

[16380] <context> Transitional marker (*yang de nyid las*) indicating continuation of tantric citation for the characteristics section.

[16381-16392] <context>
Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (*Blazing Lamp Tantra*):
The verse provides the characteristic analysis in poetic form. The particle *yis* (*kyis*) in 16382 functions as instrumental, indicating agency: "by means of unceasing arising."

[16381-16392] <philology>
Technical terms in the citation:
- *'char byed* (arising-maker): causative agent
- *pad+ma'i spyan* (lotus eye): synonym for eye in tantric physiology
- *rang gi mtshan nyid* (own characteristic): defining quality
- *'byung ba* (elements): the five material elements as causal forces
- *sdud* (gather): collecting or contracting function
- *'dzin* (hold): maintaining or sustaining function
- *mched* (expand): radiating or extending function
- *lta ba* (view): visual/cognitive perception
- *gnas* (abide): stable manifestation
- *gong ma* (above): hierarchical superior aspect
- *rang 'dzin* (self-hold): reflexive self-apprehension

[16393-16396] <concept>
Gloss on citation terminology:
Longchenpa provides a threefold gloss (*'grel pa*) on the verse:
1. *Yul snang rung gi gzugs rnams* — forms capable of appearing as objects
2. *Yul can dbang shes* — object-possessing sense consciousness
3. *Yul med* — non-object: clear appearances of non-existence, double-moon aspects, etc.

The "double-moon" (*zla gnyis*) refers to the visual phenomenon seen when pressing the eye, a standard example in Buddhist epistemology of perceptual error.

[16397-16405] <structure>
# Location Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa identifies the location (*gnas*) as the eye's "a-berry" (*mig gi a 'bras*). The exposition traces the embryological development:

1. First body formation: navel channel-knot triangle (*lte ba'i rtsa mdud gru gsum*)
2. Two eyes form: lamp-eye (*sgron ma'i spyan*) and element-eye (*'byung ba'i spyan*)
3. Arise: eye power-support (*mig gi dbang rten*) and power (*dbang po*)
4. Arise: light-root essence (*'od rtsa'i dngas ma*)
5. Path: navel → heart (*snying*) → spine branches (*sgal tshigs 'dab*) → inside surface of ears → skull membrane (*klad rgya'i spris*) → pierce two eye a-berries
6. Two channels without blood/yellow-water, like ram-horns, filled with light filaments (*'od kyi snal ma*) → pierce as door Water Lamp

[16399-16405] <philology>
Anatomical terminology:
- *Rtsa mdud* (channel-knot): energetic constriction point
- *Grus gsum* (triangle): geometric energetic configuration
- *Spris* (membrane): anatomical covering
- *A 'bras* (a-berry): crystalline lens structure
- *Rtsa khrag* (channel-blood): subtle energetic fluid
- *Chu ser* (yellow-water): metabolic fluid
- *Ba men gyi rwa* (ram-horn): descriptive simile for curved channel
- *'Od kyi snal ma* (light filaments): energetic channels of luminosity
- *Sgo chu'i sgron ma* (door Water Lamp): the channel aperture functioning as lamp

[16406-16417] <context>
Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The tantric verse provides the anatomical location in metered form:
- Location is the eye
- Arising unceasing, holding objects
- From white conch-hall of brain (*klad pa dung khang dkar po*)
- Channel with three coils to the right (*g.yas su 'khyil pa gsum*)
- Ram-horn shape
- All essences of sense powers gathered
- Arising for objects of sense powers
- Abides inside the channel

[16406] <philology> The phrase *dngos su gnas te* (actually abides) with the continuative *te* suspends meaning, linking the assertion of actual location to the subsequent scriptural citation.

[16418-16421] <concept>
The Five-Aggregate Ninefold Arising:
Longchenpa describes the subtle physiology:
- The channel, at the pulsation branch (*rgyungs pa'i 'dab*), has one upward root
- Enters skull cavity (*thod pa'i sbubs*)
- Three branches: right and left pierce two eyes; middle pierces Brahma-aperture (*tshangs bug*)
- Inside: thought-free awareness body (*rig pa rtog med kyi sku*)
- Vajra necklace (*rdo rje lu gu rgyud*) — subtle energetic structure
- Light-round dots stacked (*'od zlum gyi thig le brtsegs ma*)
- Five (*lnga*), nine (*dgu*) arise

The "five" and "nine" refer to configurations of bindus (*thig le*) that appear in *thod rgal* vision.

[16421] <philology> The term *brtsegs ma* (stacked/layered) with the locative *la* indicates the configuration of bindus as stacked or arranged in layers, not merely piled randomly.

[16422-16429] <structure>
# Correspondence with Four Lamps
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes the relationship between the bindu/dot structure and the Four Lamps:

1. **Rtsa sna chu'i sgron ma'i cha** — Channel nose: part of Water Lamp
2. **Thig le** — Dot: part of Empty Lamp (*stong sgron*)
3. **'Od lnga** — Five lights: part of Sphere Lamp (*dbyings kyi cha*)
4. **Shes pa mi rtogs pa** — Non-conceptual consciousness: part of Wisdom Lamp (*shes rab kyi sgron ma*)

This establishes a hierarchical and functional correspondence between the subtle body physiology and the fourfold *thod rgal* framework.

[16430-16433] <context>
Citation from *mu tig 'phreng ba* (*Pearl Garland Tantra*):
The verse cites the tantric source for the bindu-wisdom correspondence: "Thought-free awareness vajra necklace / appears from the door of Great Bliss Brahma."

[16430] <philology> The genitive *las* following *mu tig 'phreng ba* indicates source: "from the Pearl Garland."

[16434-16445] <structure>
# Manner of Arising
**Analysis:** Longchenpa explains the embryological genesis (*skyed tshul*) of the Water Lamp:
- Arises from navel (*lte ba nas*)
- Source: *sgron ma 'bar ba* tantra
- First formation: enters mother's womb
- Body's essence: great navel channel-knot
- Center triangle: from father-mother cause-condition essence
- Eye fruit forms
- Father-mother portions mixed: white-black (*dkar nag 'dres pa*)

[16434-16445] <philology>
Embryological terminology:
- *Ma'i mngal* (mother's womb): embryological container
- *Rgyu rkyen* (cause-condition): standard Buddhist causal terminology
- *'Bras bu* (fruit): resultant organ
- *Cha gnyis* (two portions): parental contributions
- *Dkar nag 'dres pa* (white-black mixed): reference to red/white essences (*dkar dmar*)

[16446-16452] <structure>
# Door Analysis
**Analysis:** The door (*sgo*) is identified as the straight center of the eye's a-berry clarity (*mig gi a 'bras dngas ma'i dkyil drang po*).

[16449-16452] <context>
Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"The door of arising is the two eyes themselves / arising for objects of sense powers / all this appears from the channel."

[16453-16460] <structure>
# Simile Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa introduces the hook (*lcags kyu*) simile:
- Object-appearance holding is like a hook
- The seizing hold acts like a hook
- Just as whatever appears is held by the nose [of the hook]
- This holds the two nostrils of samsara and nirvana

[16453-16460] <philology>
The comparative structure *lta bu* (like) establishes the simile. The instrumental *yis* indicates agency: "by means of the hook."

[16461-16469] <structure>
# Measure Analysis
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes three measures (*tshad gsum*):

1. **'Byung ba 'dus pa'i rgyang zhags kyi tshad** — Element-gathered far-casting snare measure: object-appearance expanding and gathering complete
2. **Ye shes kyi tshad** — Pristine awareness measure: seeing the necklace
3. **Dngas ma 'dus pa'i tshad** — Essence-gathered measure: distinguishing particular form-appearances

[16465-16469] <context>
Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"The lamp that makes appearances / objects form-appearances, and awareness / the measure of necklace-appearance / thus."

[16470-16482] <structure>
# Transition to Second Lamp
**Analysis:** Longchenpa transitions to the Lamp of Empty Bindus (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*) with a twelvefold schema:

1. Essence (*ngo bo*)
2. Definition (*nges tshig*)
3. Classification (*dbye ba*)
4. Characteristic (*mtshan nyid*)
5. Location (*gnas*)
6. Door (*sgo*)
7. Nature (*rang bzhin*)
8. Object-appearance (*yul snang*)
9. Measure (*tshad*)
10. Actual lamp (*sgron ma dngos*)
11. Method of practice (*de nyams su len thabs*)
12. Simile (*mthun dpe*)

The twelvefold structure exceeds the ninefold of the first lamp, indicating increasing complexity in the exposition.
