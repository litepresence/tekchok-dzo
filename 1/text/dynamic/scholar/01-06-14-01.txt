Colophon and Introduction to Samaya Presentation

**Analysis:** This colophon marks the completion of the empowerment chapter and the pivot to samaya (*dam tshig*), the sacred commitments that maintain tantric transmission. The standard formula identifies this as the sixth section (*rim khang drug pa*) of the Treasury, covering the ripening of the basis (*gzhi'i don smin par byed pa*) and empowerment presentation. The eightfold analysis of samaya—essence, definition, division, support, benefit, fault, repair, and protection—provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how commitment functions as the "antidote army" that binds the continuum through mantra vow.

- **<context>** Standard colophon formula: *Theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod las / gzhi'i don smin par byed pa dang dbang gi rnam par gzhag pa ste rim khang drug pa'o*—"From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the presentation of ripening the meaning of the basis and empowerment, the sixth section." This marks the closure of the empowerment chapter and pivot to samaya (*dam tshig*).

- **<structure>** The samaya presentation is organized into three topics: (1) samaya nature generally demonstrated, (2) body-speech-mind samaya specifically explained, (3) unsurpassable samaya supreme demonstrated. First topic has eight subdivisions: essence, definite-term, division, support, benefit, fault, repair-method, protect-method.

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *gzhi'i don smin par byed pa* (ripening the meaning of the basis), *dbang gi rnam par gzhag pa* (empowerment presentation), *rim khang drug pa* (sixth section), *dam tshig* (samaya/sacred pledge), *nges tshig* (definite-term), *rten* (support), *phan yon* (benefit), *nyes dmigs* (fault), *bskang thabs* (repair-method), *bsrung thabs* (protect-method), *sngags kyi sdom pas rgyud bsdams pa'i gnyen po'i dpung* (antidote army binding continuum by mantra vow).

- **<concept>** Samaya is defined as the non-emitting (*mi mda' bar byed pa*) through the antidote army binding the continuum by mantra vow. This reflects the Vajrayana understanding of samaya as active engagement (*dam tshig*)—not mere restraint but empowered commitment. The eightfold analysis (essence, term, division, support, benefit, fault, repair, protection) provides comprehensive coverage of samaya theory and practice.

- **<structure>** The transition from empowerment to samaya follows tantric logic: empowerment (*dbang*) transmits authority; samaya (*dam tshig*) maintains that transmission through commitment. The phrase *bla na med pa gsang sngags kyi sgor zhugs so cog la dam tshig kho na gal che*—"for all who enter the door of unsurpassable Secret Mantra, samaya alone is crucial"—emphasizes the centrality of sacred commitment.
