# Wind-Bindu Physiology: Four Element Transformations and Birth-Death Cycles
**Analysis:** This passage presents the advanced physiology of winds (རླུང་, *rlung*) and bindus (ཐིག་ལེ་, *thig le*) within the body. The structure follows: (1) Water element (ཆུ་, *chu*) transformations—producing blood, phlegm, channel blockage/looseness; (2) Earth element (སིལ་, *shel*) transformations—producing flesh, fat, bones, five sense organs; (3) Fire element (མེ་, *me*) transformations—producing digestive heat, body temperature, maturity; (4) Wind element (རླུང་, *rlung*) transformations—producing movement, speech, mental activity; (5) The birth-death cycle tied to seasonal and elemental transitions. The enumeration uses *dang po* (first), *gnyis pa* (second), *gsum pa* (third) for major divisions, with detailed subdivisions for each element's functions.

# Elemental Physiology and Wind Functions
**Analysis:** The Tibetan medical-tantric system presents four elements transforming within the body: Water produces blood (ཁྲག་, *khrag*) and phlegm (ཤའི་, *shai*); Earth produces flesh (ཤ་, *sha*), fat (ཚིལ་, *tshil*), bones (རུས་, *rus*), and five sense organs (ཡན་ལག, *yan lag*). Fire produces digestive heat (ཚོར་བ, *tshor ba*), and wind governs movement (སྒུལ་སྐྱོད, *sgul skyod*). The wind channels (རླུང་གི་རྩིས, *rlung gi rtsis*) are calculated based on seasons (summer, autumn, spring, winter), daily cycles, and respiration (21,600 breaths per day). The birth-death cycle (སྤྱོད་པ, *spyod pa*) corresponds to elemental decline and transformation within the body.
**Analysis:** Expected technical terms:
- Further wind (rlung) disorder classifications
- Channel blockage (rtsa bkag) and looseness (rtsa lhug) indicators
- Integration with pulse diagnosis (rtsa brtag) terminology

Transition to Next Section
**Analysis:** Probable structural markers:
- Transition to next major section on winds (rlung) or bindus (thig le)
- Citation closures and new source introductions
- Summary of channel section (rtsa'i skor) before proceeding
