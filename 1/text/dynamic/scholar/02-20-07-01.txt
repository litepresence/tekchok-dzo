. Timeframes for accomplishment: three years, five years, and the great essential point.

[9069-9083] <structure>
This section establishes the temporal parameters for Thögal accomplishment based on practitioner capacity. The structure presents three categories—supreme effort (three years), middle effort (five years), and last effort (seven years, eleven months, six days)—culminating in seeing dharmatā cease-appearance and liberating into light-body.

[9069-9083] <philology>
The term lo gsum (three years) indicates the timeframe for practitioners of supreme capacity who can accomplish complete liberation in the shortest period. The compound zla ba bcu gcig (eleven months) and zhag drug (six days) provides the precise calculation for last-capacity practitioners—demonstrating the systematic nature of Nyingma timeframes. The phrase 'od sku ru grol (liberating into light-body) employs grol (liberation) to indicate not merely mental freedom but physical transformation.

[9069-9083] <context>
The timeframes presented here reflect the Dzogchen teaching that recognition can be instantaneous, but stabilization requires time. The "three years" timeframe for supreme practitioners is a well-known Nyingma standard, associated with accounts of masters who achieved rainbow body in abbreviated periods. The specificity of "seven years, eleven months, six days" for last-capacity practitioners indicates that even those with least capacity will achieve results within a defined timeframe if they persist.

[9069-9083] <concept>
The philosophy of time presented here is non-linear: while the path unfolds temporally, the fruition transcends time. The concept of "supreme effort" (sgrub pa che) indicates not merely duration of practice but quality of engagement—undistracted, continuous recognition. The distinction between "seeing dharmatā cease-appearance" (chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba mthong) and ordinary perception indicates that the goal is not extended lifespan but recognition of the nature of appearances.

[9083-9102] <structure>
The concluding section identifies this as the "great essential point of secret experience-taking" (gsang ba nyams su len pa'i gnad chen po), transitioning to the third major division: determining the day-night wheel manner.

[9103-9142]
. Determining the day-night wheel manner: four aspects of practice.

[9103-9116] <structure>
This section presents the practical application of Thögal across the twenty-four hour cycle. The structure organizes practice into four time periods: gathering sense-faculties at night, putting knowable objects in the vase at dawn, demonstrating clear wisdom in morning, and striking with vast appearance by day.

[9103-9116] <philology>
The term nyin mtshan 'od 'khor (day-night luminosity wheel) indicates the cyclical nature of practice alternating between periods of expansion (day) and gathering (night). The phrase shes bya'i yul (knowable objects) employs epistemological terminology to indicate all phenomena that can be known. The compound thod rgal zhal 'debs (Thögal companion) indicates that these practices support and complement the main Thögal techniques.

[9103-9116] <context>
The day-night cycle reflects the natural rhythm of luminosity: daytime practice emphasizes expansive vision (glang po'i lta stags, elephant-gaze), nighttime practice emphasizes gathering into the bindu lamp (thig le stong pa'i sgron ma). The "elephant-gaze" (glang po lta stangs) refers to the specific technique of looking downward with partially closed eyes; the "lion's gaze" (seng ge lta stangs) refers to looking upward toward space.

[9103-9116] <concept>
The epistemology of day-night practice suggests that consciousness operates differently in different conditions—wakefulness and sleep, light and dark—and that the practitioner can harness these differences for recognition. The concept of "putting knowable objects in the vase" (shes bya yul bum pa la) indicates that all phenomena are gathered into the container of dharmadhātu, not scattered as ordinary perception.

[9116-9129] <structure>
The core section presents the specific techniques: daytime elephant-gaze releasing delusion-appearances to self-ceasing, nighttime placing cognition on bindu-empty lamp, and the progressive expansion and subtlety of bindu and cognition.

[9129-9142] <structure>
The conclusion presents the dawn practice: lion's gaze casting consciousness to white AH in the sky, producing meaning free of clear-empty elaboration.

[9143-9208]
. Extensive presentation: the wisdom wheel of profound expanse.

[9143-9165] <structure>
This section presents the third major division of the chapter: the wisdom wheel of profound expanse (zab mo klong gi ye shes 'khor lo). The structure is organized into three aspects: briefly demonstrating the essence, extensively explaining the nature, and summarizing the meaning by aspect.

[9143-9165] <philology>
The term zab mo (profound) indicates teachings that transcend ordinary conceptual understanding. The compound klong gi ye shes (expanse wisdom) refers to the dimension of awareness that is vast, deep, and all-pervading like space. The citation from Seng ge rtsal rdzogs (Lion Power-Perfect) establishes scriptural authority for the five intentions framework.

[9143-9165] <context>
The five intentions (dgongs pa lnga) presented here—mountain's general meaning, wisdom's general filling, bindu's range-penetration, sun-moon equal gap, ocean expanse-penetration—constitute the systematic framework for Thögal practice. Each intention addresses a specific dimension: view, ground, appearance, equality, and space. This organization reflects the Nyingma penchant for comprehensive taxonomies that ensure no aspect of practice is neglected.

[9143-9165] <concept>
The philosophical architecture of the five intentions presents a complete path: view transcends extremes (mountain), ground is recognized (wisdom filling), appearances are examined (bindu penetration), dualities are equalized (sun-moon), and awareness expands to space (ocean). This progression reflects the Dzogchen movement from recognition to stabilization to perfection.

[9165-9187] <structure>
The middle section elaborates the five intentions through specific metaphors: lion's play, king's empowerment, peacock emerging from egg, sun-moon equality, and sun arising from mountain neck.

[9187-9208] <structure>
The conclusion synthesizes the day-night wheel continuum practice: delusory appearances self-cease through body, field, and awareness, reaching the measure where even one's own body does not appear.

[9209-9222]
. Light-body and samādhi-body: distinctions and attainments.

[9209-9219] <structure>
This final section addresses the distinction between light-body ('od kyi sku) and samādhi-body (ting 'dzin sku)—two different types of accomplished embodiment. The structure presents the characteristics of each and their respective visibility.

[9209-9219] <philology>
The term 'od sku (light-body) indicates the body of pure luminosity achieved through Thögal practice, visible only to Buddha-eye (sangs rgyas kyi mig). The compound ting 'dzin sku (samādhi-body) refers to the body achieved through meditative stabilization, visible to those with god-eye (lha mig). The phrase bag chags smin pa (ripening habit-continuum) indicates that the samādhi-body results from accumulated karmic tendencies maturing.

[9209-9219] <context>
The distinction between light-body and samādhi-body reflects the Dzogchen understanding that there are different levels of accomplishment: the light-body represents the highest achievement of Thögal, transcending ordinary physicality entirely; the samādhi-body represents advanced meditative attainment still within the realm of form. The "four elements produced by ripening habit-continuum" indicates that the samādhi-body is composed of subtle matter, not pure luminosity.

[9209-9219] <concept>
The ontology of accomplished bodies presented here suggests a hierarchy of embodiment: ordinary flesh-body (lowest), samādhi-body (intermediate), and light-body (highest). The light-body's invisibility to sentient beings indicates that it transcends the perceptual capacities of ordinary consciousness—it exists at a frequency, so to speak, that only enlightened awareness can detect. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching that the ultimate nature of reality is not accessible to ordinary cognition.

[9219-9222] <structure>
The conclusion transitions to the third section: extensively explaining the wisdom wheel of profound expanse, with its three aspects of essence, nature, and meaning.
