Hearer Vehicle Overview
**Analysis:** This section presents the systematic doxographical classification (*grub mtha'*) of the Hearer Vehicle (*nyan thos kyi theg pa*), the foundational Buddhist path emphasizing individual liberation (*rang grol*) through realization of person-selflessness (*gang zag bdag med*). Longchenpa employs the standard fivefold analytical framework (*lnga ldan*)—essence (*ngo bo*), definition (*nges tshig*), purpose (*dgos pa*), effect (*'bras bu*), and divisions (*dbye ba*)—derived from Indian *abhidharma* methodologies. This presentation reflects the Nyingma tradition's commitment to preserving the complete Buddhist path hierarchy (*theg pa rim dgu*), establishing the philosophical foundation upon which Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna build. The technical terminology (*thig tshad*) reflects Sautrāntika and Vaibhāṣika influences as transmitted through the Tibetan *bstod 'grel* (praise and commentary) literature.

Longchenpa presents the hearer vehicle (*nyan thos kyi theg pa*) through five aspects:

**1. Essence (*ngo bo*):**
*'khor ba las rang grol 'dod pa'i sems* — "mind desiring sole self-liberation from samsara"
*gang zag bdag med rtogs pa'i thabs* — "method realizing person-selflessness"

**2. Definition (*nges tshig*):**
- Hearing dharma from teacher (*ston pas chos nyan*)
- Proclaiming to others (*gzhan la sgrog pa*)
- Depending on teachers (*ston pa la rag las*)
- Accomplishing last-existence enlightenment (*tshe tha mar byang chub sgrub pa*)

**3. Purpose (*dgos pa*):**
*'khor ba las nges par 'byung ba* — "definitely exiting samsara"

**4. Effect ('*bras bu*):**
*zag bcas dang zag med kyi dgra bcom* — "foe-destroyer with or without remainder"

**5. Division (*dbye ba*):**
- Sautrantika (*mdo sde pa*)
- Vaibhasika (*bye brag tu smra ba*)

**The Two Truths in Vaibhasika:**

**Relative Truth (*kun rdzob bden pa*):**
- Gross appearances gathered as one
- Like yak-horn and conch (*g.yag ru dang dung lta bu*)

**Ultimate Truth (*don dam bden pa*):**
- Part-possessed dust-atoms (*rdul phran cha can*)
- Separate pieces (*byed pa shas che*)
- Instant (*skad cig ma*) — partless, like pot-water (*bud rdza'i chu lta bu*)

**Person-Selflessness:**
Both schools accept person-selflessness (*gang zag bdag med*), yet accept dharma-self (*chos kyi bdag*) as dust-atoms and instants.

[2549-2566] <philology>
Vaibhasika Four Truths Analysis
**Analysis:** The Vaibhāṣika presentation of the Four Noble Truths (*'phags pa'i bden pa bzhi*) employs a functional typology (*byed las*) that classifies each truth according to its soteriological operation: suffering (*sdug bsngal gyi bden pa*) as that which must be known (*shes par bya ba*), origin (*kun 'byung gi bden pa*) as that which must be abandoned (*spang par bya ba*), cessation (*'gog pa'i bden pa*) as that which must be obtained (*thob par bya ba*), and path (*lam gyi bden pa*) as that which must be relied upon (*brten par bya ba*). This analytical framework, derived from the *Jñānaprasthāna* and transmitted through the Tibetan *gzhung chen bcu gsum* (Thirteen Great Scriptures), reflects the Sarvāstivāda commitment to systematic *abhidharma* classification. The integration of four conditions (*rkyen bzhi*) demonstrates the causal architecture underlying the path (*lam gyi rgyu 'bras*), establishing the metaphysical basis for the graduated cultivation (*mthong bsgom*) that characterizes Hearer practice.

**Four Truths as Cause-Effect:**

1. **Suffering** (*sdug bsngal*) — to be known (*shes par bya*)
2. **Origin** (*kun 'byung*) — to be abandoned (*spang par bya*)
3. **Cessation** (*'gog pa*) — to be obtained (*thob par bya*)
4. **Path** (*lam*) — to be relied upon (*brten par bya*)

**Four Conditions (*rkyen bzhi*):**

The path involves understanding:
- Cause (*rgyu*)
- Origin (*kun 'byung*)
- Cessation (*'gog pa*)
- Focusing on four condition types

**Meditation Method:**

*sdug bsngal mthong zhing bsgom pa dang* — "seeing and cultivating suffering"
*sgom pa'i thabs kyis rnam grol* — "liberation through cultivation method"

The path requires both intellectual understanding (*mthong*) and meditative cultivation (*bsgom*).

[2567-2596] <concept>
Sautrantika Refinement
**Analysis:** The Sautrāntika position (*mdo sde pa'i lugs*) refines Vaibhāṣika realism through the theory of svasaṃvedana (self-cognition) and the nominalist critique of permanent substances. Longchenpa identifies their distinctiveness as "surpassing regarding one portion of the dharmadhātu" (*chos kyi dbyings kyi cha gcig la bzlas*), acknowledging their deeper insight into dhārmic selflessness (*chos bdag med*) while maintaining shared ground on person-selflessness (*gang zag bdag med*). The enumeration of eighty-eight latent afflictions (*nyon mongs bag la nyal brgyad cu rtsa brgyad*) and twelve knowings (*shes pa bcu gnyis*) reflects the systematic *abhidharma* psychology transmitted through Vasubandhu's *Abhidharmakośa* and its Sautrāntika commentaries. This presentation preserves the Nyingma tradition's commitment to accurate doxographical distinction (*doxographical rigor*) between the two main Hearer philosophical schools (*shan 'byed*).

**Sautrantika Position (*mdo sde pa*):

The Sautrantikas refine the Vaibhasika position:

**Objects:**
- Four truths as objects (*yul bden pa bzhi*)
- Twelve knowings (*shes pa bcu gnyis*) as cognizing cognitions
- Eighty-eight latent afflictions (*nyon mongs bag la nyal brgyad cu rtsa brgyad*) to abandon

**Person-Selflessness:**
Same as Vaibhasika regarding person-selflessness.

**Dharma-Self Refinement:**
*chos kyi dbyings kyi cha gcig la bzlas* — "surpassed regarding one portion of dharma-realm"

**Five Knowable Bases (*gzhi shes pa lnga*) mainly obstructed:**

1. Main mind's basis (*gtso sems kyi gzhi*)
2. Retinue mind arisen basis (*'khor sems byung gzhi*)
3. Cohesion-not conditioned aggregate basis (*ldan min 'du byed phung po'i gzhi*)
4. Unconditioned eternal basis (*'dus ma byas rtag pa'i gzhi*)
5. Appearance form basis (*snang ba gzugs kyi gzhi*)

**Five Dharmata Realized:**
The portion-without-atom (*cha med rdul phran med pa*) only not-obstructed.

**Key Distinction:**
*de yang 'dzin pa'i yul rags pa snang ba'i rdul phran gyi srog gcig ma thug pa* — "that coarse-appearing atom wing of the grasped-object not reached"

The Sautrantikas do not accept even atoms as ultimately real—they too are conceptually imputed.

Common Path Cultivation
**Analysis:**

**Path Five Arising Sequence:**

Both schools practice the five paths (*lam lnga*):

**Antidotes:**

1. **General Antidote:**
   - Three poisons (*dug gsum*) countered by selflessness (*bdag med*) and illusion (*sgyu ma*) meditation

2. **Individual Antidotes:**
   - **Desire** (*'dod chags*): eight impure substances (*mi gtsang ba'i dngos po brgyad*), skeleton meditation
   - **Anger** (*zhe sdang*): love (*byams pa*) meditation
   - **Delusion** (*gti mug*): dependent arising (*rten 'brel*) forward and reverse meditation

3. **Concept Antidote:**
   - Breath out counting meditation (*dbugs rngub 'byung grangs bsgom pa*)

4. **Selflessness Cultivation:**
   - Object and object-possessor ceased
   - Non-observing object cultivation

5. **Dullness/Torpor Antidote:**
   - Crown-bump butter-lamp burning (*spyi gtsug mar me 'bar ba*)
   - Mind placed there

**Faculty Gradations:**

- Dull (*rtul po*): effort required
- Medium (*'bring*): some obtain result in life
- Sharp (*rno ba*): immediate liberation

[2607-2617] <structure>
Bodhisattva Comparison
**Analysis:**

**Bodhisattva Distinction:**

Some bodhisattvas:
- Path five previously gone (*lam lnga sngon song*)
- Collections much accumulated (*tshogs mang bsags*)
- On basis seat one (*gzhi'i gdan gcig*)
- Path five completed (*lam lnga rdzogs*)
- Liberated desire (*'dod chags grol*)

**Three Awakenings:**

From hearer vehicle, through three intellect levels:
- Small (*rtul po*): hearer's awakening
- Medium (*'bring*): self-enlightened's awakening
- Great (*chen po*): buddha's awakening

**Mahayana and Mantra:**
These paths are "not desired" (*'dod pa ma yin*) by hearers—indicating their limited aspiration.

[2618-2631] <structure>
Hearer Grounds
**Analysis:**

**Eight Inferior Grounds (*sa tha ma*):**

The hearers and self-enlightened traverse:
1. Stream-enterer (*rgyun zhugs*)
2. Once-returner (*lan gcig phyir 'ong*)
3. Non-returner (*phyir mi 'ong*)
4. Foe-destroyer (*dgra bcom pa*)

Each divided into entered (*zhugs*) and abiding (*gnas*) — making eight great-person stages (*gang zag chen po'i sa brgyad*).

**From Rigpa Rangshar:**

The hearer vehicle:
- Entering gate: four truths
- General entering gate for hearers
- Divisions: Vaibhasika and Sautrantika, two types

[2632-2670] <concept>
Detailed Path Meditation
**Analysis:**

**Vaibhasika View:**

*phung po khams skye mched g.yag ril rwa thur du shul* — "aggregates, realms, sense-bases like yak-drum marrow"

Complete analysis reveals dust-atoms (*rdul phran*) — meditate on this emptiness.

**Sautrantika View:**

*gsungs pa rang bzhin nyan bsam sgom gsum* — "recitation-made self-nature, hearing, contemplation, meditation three"

Wisdom three cultivation (*shes rab gsum bsgom*) to obtain ten grounds' result.

**General Hearer Type:**

Four truths meditation, four results.

**Cessation Meditation Method:**

1. External elements (*phyi 'byung ba*)
2. Non-attached abode (*mi chags gnas*) entered
3. First food accustomed
4. Food accustomed, samadhi meditate
5. Samadhi non-concept single-point

**Result:** Victor Maitreya's teaching obtained.

**Origination Abandonment:**

- Food's concept free (*zas kyi 'du shes dang bral*)
- Origination continuum cut (*kun 'byung rgyun chad*)
- Anger antidote meditate
- All afflictions abandoned

**Ground-Path Meditation:**

*'dod chags gnyen po bsgom pa* — "desire antidote meditate"
*gti mug gnyen po bsgom pa* — "delusion antidote meditate"

Thus the path's meditation abandons suffering.

[2671-2709] <structure>
Four Fruits from Meditation
**Analysis:**

**Fourfold Contemplation Results:**

1. **Stream-Enterer Fruit** (*rgyun zhugs kyi 'bras bu*):
   - From meditating on cessation (*'gog pa bsgom*)
   - Ground of great joy obtained (*sa dga' ba chen po thob*)
   - Up to seventh ground

2. **Once-Returner Fruit** (*lan gcig phyir 'ong gi 'bras bu*):
   - From nature of meditating on origination (*kun 'byung bsgom pa'i rang bzhin*)
   - Attained up to eighth ground

3. **Non-Returner Fruit** (*phyir mi 'ong gi 'bras bu*):
   - Through excellence of meditating on path (*lam bsgom pa'i khyad par*)

4. **Foe-Destroyer Fruit** (*dgra bcom pa'i 'bras bu*):
   - Perfected on tenth ground

**Dwelling on Grounds:**

When dwelling on grounds and mother (*sa dang ma la gnas*):
- They listen and make others hear
- Heroes below seventh ground listen to own masters
- Heroes below eighth ground wish to listen to emanation body
- Do not see it as entity, but hear through blessing-power

**Hearer Vehicle Conclusion:**

This completes the presentation of the hearer vehicle view.

[2710-2738] <structure>
Self-Enlightened Vehicle
**Analysis:**

Longchenpa presents the self-enlightened vehicle (*rang sangs rgyas kyi theg pa*) through five aspects:

**1. Essence (*ngo bo*):**
*phyogs tsam rang don gyis* — "through partial self-benefit"
*ston pa sangs rgyas la rag ma las* — "without depending on enlightenment teacher"
*tshe rabs mtha' ru mngon par sangs rgyas pa'i thabs* — "method manifesting at end of existence"
*phyogs rdzogs bdag med gnyis rtogs pa* — "realizing both half and complete selflessness"

**2. Definition (*nges tshig*):**
*bde bar rang nyid sangs rgyas par sems pa* — "thinking oneself alone becomes Buddha"

**3. Purpose (*dgos pa*):**
*'khor ba las thar pa'i bar mchog gi byang chub thob pa* — "obtaining medium enlightenment for liberation from samsara"

**4. Fruit ('*bras bu*):**
*gnyis dgra bcom* — "two foe-destroyers"

**5. Division (*dbye ba*):**
- Like crows (*bya rog*): flock-gathered (*tshogs 'dus*)
- Like rhinoceroses (*bse ru*): dwelling alone (*bse ru lta bu gcig pu gnas*)

**The Rhinoceros-Type:**

Focuses on phenomena gathered in four truths, meditating on twelve links of dependent arising in forward order, wishing to abandon all subtle defilements of three realms.

**Dependent Arising:**
From ignorance as cause to formative forces; from these, consciousness to aging-and-death, knowing before-after cause-effect.

**Selflessness Realization:**

The rhinoceros-type realizes:
- Person-self (*gang zag bdag*) nonexistent
- Half dharma-self (*chos kyi bdag phyogs gcig*) — outer grasping of atoms with/without parts, both nonexistent

[2739-2748] <context>
Citation from Abhisamayalankara
**Analysis:**

From the *Abhisamayalankara* (Ornament of Clear Realization):

*don la mi rtog 'dzin pa spangs /
'dzin pa nyid ni ma spangs dang* — "To abandon grasping of objects, yet not abandon grasping itself"

*de yi rten ni bse ru'i lam /*
yang dag sdom pas shes par bya* — "The rhinoceros-like path of support is to be known through correct summary"

**Key Insight:** Self-enlightened ones realize outer dharma-grasping is nonexistent, yet do not realize inner antidote-grasping is also empty.

**Time:**
*tshegs chung 'dus pa'i lam du brgya* — "arising from gathering accumulations on the path of accumulation for a hundred great kalpas"

*bskal pa brgya yi rgyu ni bse ru* — "The rhinoceros, through a hundred kalpas' cause"

[2749-2798] <structure>
Self-Enlightened Methods from Rigpa Rangshar
**Analysis:**

**Rigpa Rangshar Citation:**

```
Aho! Secret Lord, listen!
The sutra vehicle of self-enlightened ones
Has twelve links of dependent arising as its entrance.
The view realized is person-selflessness,
Seeing half-power regarding dharma-self.
Protecting the two hundred fifty disciplines,
The meditation stage: meditating on non-thought dharma-nature.
Outer and inner dependent arisings,
Through habituation become strength,
The fruit is considered complete perfection.
```

**Twelve Links Meditation:**

The example: corpse in charnel ground

**Forward Order:**
1. From ignorance (*ma rig pa*), formative forces (*'du byed*)
2. From formative forces, consciousness (*rnam shes*)
3. From consciousness, name (*ming*)
4. From name, form (*gzugs*) nature arises
5. From form, six sense-bases (*skye mched drug*)
6. From six sense-bases, contact (*reg pa*)
7. From contact, feeling (*tshor ba*)
8. From feeling, craving (*sred pa*)
9. From craving, grasping (*len pa*)
10. From grasping, existence (*srid pa*)
11. From existence, birth (*skye ba*)
12. From birth, aging (*rga ba*), sickness (*na ba*), death (*'chi ba*)

**Reverse Order:**
Going to charnel ground: "From what did this corpse arise?" "From death," thus contemplating up to ignorance.

**Eight Unpleasant Meditations:**

As antidotes to attachment:
1. Blue (*sngo*) — lividity
2. Red (*dmag*) — putrefaction
3. Remaining (*lhag*)
4. Swollen (*rgyas*)
5. Worm-entered (*srin bu za*)
6. Scattered (*bsil ba*)
7. White (*dkar*)
8. Skeleton (*rus pa*)

**Result:**
Without listening or hearing, therefore called self-enlightened vehicle.

[2799-2830] <structure>
Bodhisattva Vehicle Introduction
**Analysis:**

**Two Aspects:**

1. How it surpasses lesser vehicles
2. Explaining the especially superior vehicle itself

**Superiority Through:**

*snying rje chen po thabs dang gnyis bdag med rtogs pa'i shes rab* — "Great compassion as method and wisdom realizing both selflessnesses"

**From Ratnavali:**
```
Emptiness with compassion as essence—
This accomplishes enlightenment for some.
```

**From Compendium:**
```
Without method, separated from wisdom,
One falls into the hearer state.
```

**Five Aspects of Bodhisattva Vehicle:**

1. **Essence (*ngo bo*):**
   *chos thams cad nam mkha' lta bu rtogs* — "realizing all dharmas as space-like"
   *snying rje chen pos gzhan phan rgya chen spyod pa'i thabs mchog gam rgyu* — "through great compassion becoming supreme method or cause for vast conduct benefiting others"

2. **Definition (*nges tshig*):**
   *thabs gang la rag las thar pa'i grong khyer mchog tu khrid pa'i phyir theg pa chen po'o* — "depending on whatever method, leading to supreme great city of liberation—thus the Great Vehicle"

3. **Purpose (*dgos pa*):**
   *sems mchog can rnams sangs rgyas nyid 'thob par byed* — "causing those with supreme minds to obtain Buddhahood"

4. **Fruit ('*bras bu*):**
   *kun tu 'od kyi sa bcu gcig pa sgrub pa* — "accomplishing the all-illuminating ground, the eleventh"

5. **Division (*dbye ba*):**
   Though many, gathered into two: method and wisdom.

[2831-2832] <structure>
Two Truths Framework
**Analysis:**

**General Path Introduction:**

Longchenpa introduces the two truths (*bden pa gnyis*) as the basis for all Mahayana practice.

**From Root Wisdom (*rtsa ba'i shes rab*):**

All phenomena gathered by samsara and nirvana are gathered into the self-nature of the two truths.

**From Uttaratantra Commentary:**

```
All paths of truth are compounded.
All compounds are merely conventional.
That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—
The essence of emptiness, along with the subsequent measuring wisdom,
The peaceful aspect of elaboration, is the ultimate truth.
```

**Two-fold Ultimate Division:**

1. **Nominal Ultimate** (*rnam grangs pa'i don dam*):
   - Through reasoning that examines and dissects (*dpyod byed kyi rigs pas dpyad cing dbye ba na*)
   - When nothing is established as dharma-nature (*chos nyid du ma grub pa na*)
   - Wisdom realizing all as primordially dwelling arises in accord with its nature

2. **Verbal Ultimate** (*sgra ji bzhin pa'i don dam*)

**From Two Truths:**

The relationship between reasoning and realization established.

[2831-2832] <structure>
Vehicle of Characteristics Path
**Analysis:**

**Two-fold Division of Tenet Explanations:**

1. **Vehicle of Characteristics** (*mtshan nyid kyi theg pa*) — through methodological tradition
2. **Vehicle of Fruition** (*'bras bu'i theg pa*) — tantric approach

**Path for Sharp Faculties:**

Through the Vehicle of Characteristics, the path arises for:
- Sharp faculties (*dbang po rno ba*)
- Powerful mind-power (*sems kyi stobs ldan*)

**Basis:** Self-nature of the two truths (*gzhir gyur pa'i bden pa gnyis kyi rang bzhin*)

**Practice Framework:**

Knowing the two truths, the question becomes: *de ji ltar bsgom* — "how then to practice?"

**Fruit Presentation:**

Three divisions:
1. Path fruit
2. Complete perfection fruit
3. [Third aspect]

**From Entrance (*Jug pa*):**

```
The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear.
```

**Buddhahood Structure:**

- **Self-purpose** (*rang don*): Dharma-body (*chos sku*)
- **Others' benefit** (*gzhan don*): Two form-bodies (*gzugs sku gnyis*)
- **Wisdom** (*shes rab*): Beholding all with two wisdoms
- **Activity** (*phrin las*): Working for beings until samsara emptied
