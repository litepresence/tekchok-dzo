. First activity: pacifying (zhi ba) through white dharmatā.

<concept>
This section presents the first of the four enlightened activities (phrin las rnam bzhi): pacifying (zhi ba). The analysis establishes the doctrinal framework: "Particular explain in four, first pacifying" (bye brag tu bshad pa la bzhi las / dang po zhi ba). The conceptual structure demonstrates how each activity corresponds to a specific color, dharmatā quality, and function: pacifying is white, associated with the Vajra family (rdo rje rigs), and counteracts aversion (zhe sdang). The key doctrinal point is that dharmatā itself is pacifying (chos nyid zhi ba)—not that pacification is something achieved but recognized as already present.

<historical-context>
The citation from an unspecified tantra (de las) establishes scriptural authority for the four activities schema. The white dharmatā pacifying (dkar po chos nyid zhi ba) reflects the standard tantric correlation of white with Vajra family and mirror-like wisdom (me long lta bu'i ye shes). The crystal vessel metaphor (gos pa med pa'i dkyil 'khor ni / dper na shel gong dag pa bzhin) draws from classical Buddhist imagery: just as crystal remains pure despite containing impurities, dharmatā remains unstained by afflictions. This reflects the Nyingma integration of tantric practice with Dzogchen view.

<linguistic-analysis>
The term zhi ba (pacifying) carries its technical sense as one of the four enlightened activities. The compound chos nyid (dharmatā) refers to the ultimate nature of phenomena, here specifically its pacifying quality. The phrase nyon mongs dri ma (affliction defilement) employs standard Abhidharma terminology: nyon mongs (kleśa) are the afflictive emotions, dri ma (mala) are their defiling quality. The crystal metaphor uses shel gong (crystal vessel) to indicate transparency and purity. The particle 'i in gos pa'i indicates possession—the fault of defilement cannot possess or stain dharmatā.

<structural-mapping>
The section follows a four-part structure: (1) identification of the activity (pacifying), (2) scriptural citation establishing its dharmatā basis, (3) metaphorical illustration (crystal), (4) concluding affirmation of dharmatā's purity. This structure mirrors the standard Nyingma presentation: ground (dharmatā), path (activity), fruition (pacification). The transition to enriching (gnyis pa rgyas pa ni) at line 1599 marks the completion of this subsection.

<concept>
The philosophical architecture here is sophisticated: pacification is not the destruction of afflictions but recognition that they never stained dharmatā. The concept of dri ma med pa'i dkyil 'khor (stain-free mandala) indicates that the mandala of reality is inherently pure. The simile of crystal (shel gong) illustrates the relationship between dharmatā and afflictions: like crystal containing impurities that don't affect its transparency, dharmatā contains apparent afflictions that don't affect its purity. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching of primordial purity (ka dag)—obscurations are adventitious (glo bur), not inherent.

. Second activity: enriching (rgyas pa) through yellow dharmatā.

<structure>
This section transitions to the second activity: enriching. The structure follows the same four-part pattern: identification, scriptural citation, metaphorical illustration, concluding affirmation. The transition marker "Second enriching" (gnyis pa rgyas pa ni) clearly delineates this as the second of four. The enrichment is characterized by "great" (chen po) and "various qualities" (sna tshogs), indicating both magnitude and diversity of beneficial effects.

<context>
The citation from the same source (yang de las) maintains doctrinal continuity. The yellow enriching dharmatā (ser po rgyas pa'i chos nyid) correlates with the Jewel family (rin chen rigs) and equality wisdom (mnyam pa nyid ye shes). The wish-fulfilling jewel metaphor (nor bu rin po che) is standard in Buddhist literature: just as the jewel fulfills all desires without being diminished, enriching activity benefits all beings without exhaustion. This reflects the Nyingma understanding that enlightened activity is unlimited.

<philology>
The term rgyas pa (enriching/expanding) indicates the activity that increases qualities and merit. The compound yon tan (excellence/quality) refers to the enlightened qualities that enrich beings. The phrase dgos 'dod (needs desires) encompasses both necessities and wishes. The causative particle 'i in rgyas pa'i indicates the source of enrichment—dharmatā itself. The verb bskang (fulfill) in bskang ba ltar indicates complete satisfaction.

<concept>
The soteriological mechanism of enriching is distinct from pacifying: while pacifying removes obstacles, enriching adds positive qualities. However, in the Dzogchen view, both are recognition rather than production—qualities are not created but revealed as already present. The concept of yon tan thams cad 'byung ba (all qualities arise) indicates that enlightenment contains all positive qualities naturally. The wish-fulfilling jewel (cintāmaṇi) metaphor illustrates spontaneous abundance: just as the jewel manifests desired objects effortlessly, dharmatā naturally manifests qualities.

<structure>
The structure moves from dharmatā source through quality manifestation to soteriological result: chos nyid rgyas pa chen po des (by that great enriching dharmatā) → yon tan sna tshogs shar ba yis (through dawning of various qualities) → sems can thams cad grol bar byed (liberates all beings). This cause-method-result sequence reflects standard Buddhist lam rim adapted to Dzogchen.

. Third activity: power (dbang) through red dharmatā.

<concept>
This section presents the third activity: power or magnetizing. The key doctrinal point is that power is complete without seeking (ma btsal gzhi la grub pa yin)—not that power must be acquired but recognized as already present. The analysis identifies "Power itself dharmakaya essence" (dbang nyid chos sku'i ngo bo), establishing that power is not an external capacity but the nature of reality itself.

<context>
The red power dharmatā (dmar po dbang gi chos nyid) correlates with the Lotus family (padma rigs) and discriminating wisdom (so sor rtog pa ye shes). The jewel-gold metaphor (nor bu gser) illustrates natural completeness: just as gold's yellow color is intrinsic and need not be sought, power is inherent in dharmatā. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching of spontaneous presence (lhun grub)—qualities exist naturally without effort.

<philology>
The term dbang (power/magnetizing) carries its technical sense as the activity that attracts favorable conditions and beings. The phrase ma btsal (without seeking) indicates natural presence rather than acquired status. The compound gzhi la grub (complete in the ground) employs gzhi (ground/basis) in its Dzogchen sense as primordial reality. The term dbang nyid (power itself) uses the emphatic nyid to indicate essence rather than attribute.

<structure>
The structure presents: (1) definition of power activity, (2) scriptural citation, (3) jewel-gold metaphor, (4) application to ground-appearance mandala, (5) concluding affirmation. The progression from "without seeking" through examples to "complete in dharmatā ground" establishes the non-effortful nature of power in Dzogchen view.

<concept>
The philosophical implication is profound: power (dbang) in the Dzogchen context is not control over others but the natural capacity of reality to manifest appropriately. The concept of gzhi snang dkyil 'khor (ground-appearance mandala) indicates that power manifests through the natural display of reality, not through forceful intervention. The completeness (grub pa) indicates that nothing needs to be added—recognition is sufficient.

. Fourth activity: fierce (drag po) through green dharmatā.

<concept>
This section presents the fourth activity: fierce or wrathful. The key doctrinal point is that fierceness is complete in nature (rang bzhin drag po'i ngos la thams cad grub), indicating that wrathful activity is not angry destruction but natural intensity. The analysis emphasizes "without obstruction to anything" (gang la thogs pa med par), distinguishing fierce activity from ordinary aggression.

<context>
The green fierce dharmatā (ljang khu drag po'i chos nyid) correlates with the Karma family (phrin las rigs) and action-accomplishing wisdom (bya ba grub pa'i ye shes). The wind-emanation metaphor (rlung gi sprul pa) illustrates unobstructed activity: just as wind moves without impediment, fierce activity benefits beings without obstruction. This reflects the Nyingma presentation of wrathful deities as compassionate manifestations rather than angry forces.

<philology>
The term drag po (fierce/wrathful) carries its technical tantric sense of forceful enlightened activity. The compound rang bzhin (nature/essence) indicates that fierceness is intrinsic, not added. The phrase thogs pa med (without obstruction) distinguishes enlightened activity from ordinary force. The term rlung gi sprul pa (wind-emanation) employs rlung (wind/prāṇa) as metaphor for unstoppable natural force.

<structure>
The structure presents: (1) identification of fierce activity, (2) scriptural citation emphasizing completeness in nature, (3) ground purity, (4) wind-emanation metaphor, (5) wisdom dawning without obstruction, (6) conclusion on enlightened activity. The progression from nature through metaphor to wisdom establishes fierce activity as wisdom-display rather than emotional force.

<concept>
The philosophical architecture here is crucial: fierce activity is not anger but the natural intensity of wisdom when obstacles are encountered. The concept of thogs pa med par (without obstruction) indicates that fierce activity, like wind, benefits without being blocked by resistance. The "wisdom without need" (dgos pa med pa ye shes) indicates spontaneous benefit—wisdom acts naturally without deliberate intention. This reflects the Dzogchen understanding that all four activities are natural expressions of dharmatā, not manufactured techniques.
