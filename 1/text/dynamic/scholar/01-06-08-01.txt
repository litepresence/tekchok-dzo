## Four Empowerments

**Three Divisions:**
1. Brief: Four Empowerments
2. Extensive: Self-face distinctions  
3. Very extensive: Emanation distinctions

**Outer/Inner/Secret/Perfect:**
- Outer: posture (sku yi gzugs)
- Inner: gaze (spyan yi rnam)
- Secret: four directions + mind door
- Perfect: awareness primordially pure, beyond conceptual mind

## Completion Stage

The progression from deliberate practice to spontaneous wisdom through subtle body refinement. Five stages trace path from effort to beyond effort.

**Key Sources:** Hevajra Tantra, Guhyasamaja, Six Yogas of Naropa, Kalachakra—integrated into Nyingma presentation.

The Four Empowerments (dbang bzhi):
1. Vase Empowerment (bum pa): ripens the body
2. Secret Empowerment (gsang ba): ripens the speech  
3. Knowledge-Word Empowerment (shes pa'i tshig): ripens the mind
4. Precious Empowerment (rin po che): ripens beyond these

These correspond to the outer, inner, secret, and perfect aspects of tantric practice. The progression traces from deliberate engagement to spontaneous wisdom—from effort to effortlessness.

The "utterly unelaborate" (shin tu spros bral) empowerment introduces the self-nature of spontaneous accomplishment—awareness beyond conceptual mind, called "vast space" (klong chen po). This represents the culmination of tantric practice where all artificial constructs dissolve into natural awareness.

The structure divides into: outer (posture), inner (gaze), secret (entering through four directions into mind's door), perfect (primordially pure awareness transcending conceptual mind). Each aspect prepares for recognizing the nature without grasping.

This connects to the completion stage (rdzogs rim) practice where the five stages trace progression from deliberate engagement to spontaneous wisdom: initial setup, engagement, non-dual experience, beyond extremes, and the utterly unelaborate state where all conceptual constructs dissolve.

The Kalachakra and Hevajra systems provide detailed bliss taxonomy integrated into the Nyingma presentation. The Hevajra Tantra outlines the five wisdom families (rigs lnga) corresponding to the five buddhafields and five destructive emotions transformed.

The Guhyasamaja system presents the twenty-five gnosises (ye shes nyi shu rtsa lnga) as manifestations of enlightened wisdom. The Six Yogas of Naropa detail the subtle body practices including tummo (gtum mo) inner heat, phowa (pho ba) transference, and ilzong ('khrul 'khor) yoga of illusions.

These systems provide the technical framework for understanding how appearances arise from the subtle body and how they can be transformed through practice. The ultimate point is recognizing these appearances as the self-display of wisdom rather than external phenomena.

The progression from outer to inner to secret to perfect mirrors the Dzogchen teaching: first we work with external forms (posture, breath), then internal experiences (sensations, visions), then the secret dimension (mind's nature), and finally the perfect recognition that was always already present.

The four empowerments represent not stages to achieve but doorways to recognize what is already complete. The tantric path uses these skillful means to point directly to the nature—which is not created by practice but discovered as what has always been.
