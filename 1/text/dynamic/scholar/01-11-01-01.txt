### <structural-mapping>
The passage establishes a **systematic typology of wisdom manifestations** (ye shes) within the subtle body architecture. Lines 13250-13278 present a fourfold classification structure:

1. **Mtshan nyid 'dzin pa'i ye shes** (13250): Characteristic-holding wisdom
2. **Shes pas bsdus pa'i ye shes** (13254-13255): Consciousness-gathered wisdom
3. **Shes bya'i ye shes** (13263): Object-of-knowledge wisdom
4. **Gzhi gnas kyi ye shes** (implied): Ground-abiding wisdom

The architectural framework operates through **channel-wisdom correspondence**: each of the four fire channels (me'i rtsa bzhi) contains specific wisdom configurations. The structure demonstrates how physiological structures (lus kyi rtsa) serve as the support (rten) for metaphysical realizations.

### <grammatical-examination>
**Critical terminological analysis:**

- **མཚན་ཉིད་འཛིན་པའི་ཡེ་ཤེས།** (13250): "Characteristic-holding wisdom" - operates through the **defining marks** (mtshan nyid) that distinguish phenomena without reification. The particle 'dzin indicates **apprehension without grasping**.

- **ཤེས་པས་བསྡུས་པའི་ཡེ་ཤེས།** (13255): "Wisdom gathered by consciousness" - the instrumental/agentive particle ས་ marks consciousness (shes pa) as the **gathering agent** of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dual awareness into unified wisdom.

- **འོད་ཀྱི་འགྲེང་བུ།** (13251): "Column of light" - technical term for the **vertical luminosity axis** within channels. 'Greng bu (column/pillar) suggests **structural support** for wisdom manifestation.

- **དོན་དམ་དང་ཀུན་རྫོབ་གཉིས་ཀའི་འགག་པ།** (13264): "Cessation of both absolute and relative" - the dual-inclusive particle ཀའི་ establishes that wisdom transcends both frames simultaneously.

**Particle constructions:**
The **causative-resultative** ནས...བྱས། appears at 13273-13274, establishing the **karmic-mechanistic** link between wisdom-energies (ye shes) and wind-horses (rta rlung). The **conditional** ན། at 13268-13270 structures the **correspondence system** between body-events and kāya-realizations.

### <historical-context>
**Doxographical placement:**
This passage represents **Dzogchen embryology** (rdzogs chen skye mched) within the **Menngakde** (man ngag sde) tradition. The integration of the three kāyas (sku gsum) into physiological channels shows the **Nyingma** doctrine of **innate Buddhahood** (sangs rgyas chos sku).

**Tantric correlations:**
The four fire channels correspond to the **four inner channels** of **Kālacakra** physiology. The seven-day (zhag bdun) gestational timing indicates the **fourth empowerment** (dbang bzhi pa) completion timeframe.

**Intertextual matrix:**
The citation structure at 13274-13275 (yi ge dang 'od dang sku rnams) references the **Guhyagarbha Tantra** presentation of spontaneous arising (rang byung). The phrase **ka dag rang sor gnas pa** (13279) echoes **Longchenpa's** Chöying Dzö terminology.

### <concept>
**The three kāyas in the body's channels:**
The text presents a sophisticated **somatic soteriology** at lines 13268-13270:
- **Chags pa** (formation/birth) → **Chos sku** (dharmakāya): Body-formation reveals emptiness
- **Gnas pa** (abiding) → **Longs sku** (saṃbhogakāya): Sustained presence manifests enjoyment
- **'Jig pa** (dissolution) → **Sprul sku** (nirmāṇakāya): Dissolution creates emanation-body

**Wisdom-energies and the wind-horse:**
Line 13274 specifies that **ye shes rta rlung** (wisdom wind-horse) causes body-dissolution to be **not permanent absence** (gtan med ma yin). This creates the **continuity of awareness** beyond physical death—wisdom-energies persist as "light and movement" ('od dang sku ris can) in the bardo.

**Primordial purity and spontaneous presence:**
Lines 13276-13278 analyze the **ground-phase rigpa** (rig pa gzhi gnas kyi dus): initially internal luminosity (nang gsal phra ba) without form/color (kha dog ris can ma yin), then externalizing as display (phyir shar) when embodied. This demonstrates **ka dag** (primordial purity) as the base and **lhun grub** (spontaneous presence) as the manifestation.

### <architectural-analysis>
The passage presents **second seven-day period** (bdun tshan gnyis pa) embryology with systematic channel development. Lines 13279-13307 establish:

1. **Completion of three kāyas** (13279-13280): Lhun grub dissolution into ka dag
2. **Water channel generation** (13282-13290): Eight water channels producing eight consciousnesses
3. **Wind-sound manifestation** (13291-13296): Khra spungs (gathered sound) wind creating elemental wheels
4. **Embryonic nāḍī formation** (13296-13307): Twenty-one-day completion of srin bu (subtle channels)

The architectural progression follows **elemental emergence**: from wisdom dissolution (space) → water channels → wind-sound → earth-solidification.

### <grammatical-examination>
**Technical terminology:**

- **ཀ་དག་རང་སོར་གནས་པ།** (13279): "Primordial purity abiding in its own place" - rang sor (self-place) indicates **non-contrived naturalness**. The རང་ prefix emphasizes **self-originated** rather than achieved.

- **བདུན་ཚན་གཉིས་པ།** (13281): "Second seven-day [period]" - tshan marks **collective/group** timing. The enumeration establishes **tantric gestational cycles**.

- **སྐྱེད་བྱེད་དང་པོའི་འཁོར་ལོ།** (13282): "First producing wheel" - technical term for the **navel chakra** as generative center. Skyed byed (producer/generator) identifies the **manipūra** function.

- **ཁ་སྤུངས།** (13291): "Gathered sound/mouth-heap" - onomatopoeic term for the **primordial sound** of wind in channels. The wind-sound (rlung gi rang sgra) transforms into seed-syllables (yi ge).

- **དབང་བསྒྱུར་གྱི་ལུས།** (13305): "Body of transformation/control" - dbang bsgyur indicates **empowerment capacity**. The phrase specifies this is **not physical form** (dngos gzugs ma yin) but energetic body.

**Grammatical structures:**
The **causal-connective** ལས། appears extensively (13287, 13289, 13291), establishing **karmic causality** in embryonic development. The **conditional-consequential** ན...བྱུང་། structures (13286, 13296) mark **developmental thresholds**.

### <doxographical-placement>
**Tantric embryology:**
The passage aligns with **Nyingma** subtle body physiology as presented in the **Nyi Zla Kha Sbyor** tantra (cited at 13307). The eight consciousnesses (rnam shes brgyad) from eight channels reflect **Yogācāra** psychology integrated into **Dzogchen** physiology.

**Mantric cosmology:**
The **seed-syllables** (yi ge) and **light-columns** ('od) with **Samantabhadra parents** (kun bzang yab yum) establish the **adhiṣṭhāna** (blessing) dimension of embryology—each channel contains enlightened potential.

**Karmic theory integration:**
Line 13306 specifies that Buddha-bodies do not abide in **dual parents** (gnyis gnyis), establishing the **non-dual** nature of enlightened form. This contrasts with ordinary embodiment which requires dual conditions.

### <concept>
**Wind as the animator of consciousness:**
Lines 13286-13287 present the **wind-consciousness relationship**: when karmic wind (las kyi rlung) moves through channels, they **vibrate and coil** ('gul zhing 'phril) producing eight consciousnesses. This establishes **vāyu** as the bridge between physical and mental.

**The four earth channels and gathering wind:**
The text describes a sophisticated **energetic architecture** (13291-13296): four earth channels form wheels ascending upward, while **khra spungs wind** holds the space between them like **mustard seeds not touching** (yungs 'bru tsam gyis ma reg par). This creates the **luminous gap** where awareness resides.

**Twenty-one days as karmic completion:**
Line 13328 establishes **zhag nyer gcig** (twenty-one days) as the completion of all mantra activities (sngags kun gyi las mtha'). This reflects the **tantric principle** that energetic processes complete in three seven-day cycles—gestation follows the same pattern as spiritual practice.

### <structure>
The passage presents **citation and third seven-day period** with aggregate formation. Lines 13308-13331 divide into:

1. **Tantric citation** (13308-13314): Rdo rje rtse mo rol pa las—on form and emptiness
2. **Karmic completion** (13315-13317): Fourteen days marking karmic relationships
3. **Third seven-day development** (13317-13331): Elemental completion and aggregate manifestation

The structure demonstrates the **integration of scripture, karma, and physiology**.

### <philology>
**Technical terminology:**

- **གཟུགས་གཅིག་ལས་ནི་ལུས་ཀྱི་མཐའ།** (13308): "From one form, the body's limit"—quotation from **Vajra Pinnacle Play** tantra. Mttha' (limit/extreme) indicates the **boundaries of form** that are ultimately empty.

- **གྲུག་མཐའ་མ་གྲུབ་མཐར་འཛིན་པ།** (13309): "Grasping at extremes where the extreme of destruction is unestablished"—presents **Mādhyamika** emptiness through tantric verse. Gru mtha' (destruction-extreme) refers to **nihilism**.

- **ཆགས་སྤྱོད་ཀྱི་རླུང་།** (13315): "Desire-activity wind"—technical term for **kāma-vāyu**, the wind that drives attachment. The compound establishes the **link between wind-energies and afflictions**.

- **འདོད་ཆགས་ཀྱི་ལས་ཉེ་བར་ལེན་པ།** (13315): "Karma of attachment as near-seizer"—nye bar len pa (upādāna) identifies the **second link** of dependent origination, here applied to embryonic desire.

- **ཀུན་གཞིའི་རྟེན་བཞི།** (13320): "Four supports of ālaya"—the ālaya-vijñāna's fourfold basis, a technical **Yogācāra** term integrated into Dzogchen physiology.

**Grammatical analysis:**
The **quotative** ཞེས་སོ། appears at 13314 and 13330, marking **canonical authority**. The **causal-final** བྱས་པས། (13323, 13324) establishes **resultative processes** in development.

### <context>
**Doxographical synthesis:**
The passage integrates three systems:
1. **Madhyamaka**: Emptiness of form extremes (13308-13314)
2. **Yogācāra**: Ālaya-vijñāna and aggregates (13320-13323)
3. **Dzogchen**: Natural dissolution into dharmatā (13329)

**Tantric classification:**
The citation from **Rdo rje rtse mo rol pa** (Vajra Pinnacle Play) establishes the text's **Mahāyoga** affiliation. This tantra focuses on **guhyagarbha** (secret womb) teachings.

**Embryological correlation:**
The twenty-one-day (zhag nyer gcig) completion corresponds to the **three-week formation** in Ayurvedic embryology, but with tantric interpretation—dissolution of ālaya support marks the shift from collective to individual consciousness.

### <concept>
**Form, destruction-extreme, and emptiness:**
The citation at 13308-13314 presents the **sunyata of form**: form arises from limits, but the limit of destruction is unestablished. This means **form is neither eternal nor annihilated**—it appears dependently without inherent existence.

**Desire-wind and karmic formation:**
Lines 13315-13317 analyze **how desire creates embodiment**: desire-activity wind (chags spyod kyi rlung) in each srin bu (subtle channel) produces attachment-karma. This establishes that **embodiment is driven by karmic winds** that carry the imprints of past attachment.

**The four ālaya-supports and eighteen dhātus:**
The text presents the **physiological basis** for the eighteen elements (khams bco brgyad). At 13320-13322, the four ālaya-supports stabilize as energetic spheres (rlangs kyi dum bu), forming the basis for sense-consciousness development. This demonstrates that **the elements are energetic configurations** rather than solid substances.

### <structure>
The passage presents **channel wheel elaboration** and the **twelve sense bases** formation. Lines 13332-13356 establish:

1. **Fourth day development** (13332-13335): Eight channels generating twelve sense bases
2. **Channel wheel architecture** (13335-13339): Ro 'dus 'khor lo (taste-gathering wheel) as navel chakra
3. **Thirty-two to forty-six day development** (13340-13356): Elemental stabilization and crown wheel (rtse mo) formation

The structure demonstrates **systematic physiological cosmology**—the body as mandala.

### <philology>
**Technical terminology:**

- **རོ་རྣམས་འདུས་པའི་འཁོར་ལོ།** (13334): "Wheel of gathered tastes"—technical term for **navel chakra** (maṇipūra). Ro (taste) indicates the **digestive/gustatory function**; 'dus pa (gathered) marks the **centralizing** nature of this chakra.

- **སྐར་མའི་འོད་འདྲ་བ་འཚེར་བའི་གདངས།** (13334): "Resonance radiating like starlight"—gdangs (resonance/tone) establishes the **sonic dimension** of channel wheels. The compound suggests **luminous vibration**.

- **འདུས་པ་ནི་རོ་དྲུག་འདུས་པ་སྟེ།** (13377): "Gathering is the gathering of six tastes"—defines the navel wheel through **six taste-categories** (ro drug), linking Ayurvedic physiology to tantric anatomy.

- **འགྲོ་དྲུག་གི་ཆ་མི་ལ་ཚང་བའི་གནད་དོ།** (13379): "The crucial point where the six realm-elements are complete in humans"—gnad (crucial point/vital point) identifies this as **essential instruction**.

**Particle constructions:**
The **purposive** དུ། appears at 13332 ('phel ba yan lag gi rtsa bzhi ste brgyad du nges la), establishing **teleological development**—channels develop "toward" specific numbers. The **locative-inclusive** ན།...སུ། structures mark **spatial containment**.

### <context>
**Dzogchen physiology:**
The passage presents **Dzogchen** integration of **Guhyagarbha** tantra embryology. The twelve sense bases (skye mched bcu gnyis) developing from channels reflects the **interdependence** of physical and mental in Buddhist phenomenology.

**Yogic anatomy:**
The **four wheels** ('khor lo bzhi) correspond to:
1. Navel (ro 'dus): Taste/gathering
2. Heart (dran pa 'dus): Memory/consciousness
3. Throat (ro myong): Taste-experience/speech
4. Crown (rtse mo rnam bkod): Apex/complete manifestation

This structure parallels **Kālacakra** and **Hevajra** systems.

**Numerical symbolism:**
The numbers (32, 36, 60, 96) reflect **Vedic-Tantric numerology**:
- 32 = completion of major channels
- 36 = 12 sense bases × 3 dimensions
- 60 = lunar-solar correspondence
- 96 = four wheels × 24 (solar hours)

### <concept>
**The six tastes and six realms:**
Line 13379 establishes a **microcosm-macrocosm correspondence**: the six tastes in human digestion mirror the six realms of existence. This reflects the **Hindu-Buddhist** principle that **the body contains the universe**.

**Taste-yoga and vital extraction:**
Lines 13377-13384 present **rasāyana** (bcud len) theory: the six tastes gathered (ro drug 'dus pa) through "taste-yoga" (zas kyi rnal 'byor) can be refined over three years (lo gsum) to achieve vital extraction. This is the **tantric alchemical** dimension of physiology.

**The four behaviors and four wheels:**
The text specifies (13339-13340) that the four wheels support four behaviors ('gro nyal 'dug sdod spyod lam rnam bzhi): going, lying, sitting, staying. This establishes **postural practice** (gnas pa bzhi) as integral to channel work.

### <structure>
The passage presents **numerological cosmology** of the subtle body. Lines 13356-13380 establish:

1. **Thirty-two channels and thirty-two wisdoms** (13359-13360)
2. **Four lamps and ultimate thigle** (13360-13361)
3. **Defiled essence transformation** (13362-13366)
4. **Channel-wisdom-aggregate synthesis** (13366-13380)

The structure creates a **mathematical mandala** of correspondences between channels, letters, light-spheres, and deities.

### <philology>
**Technical terminology:**

- **ཡེ་ཤེས་སུམ་ཅུ་རྩ་གཉིས།** (13359): "Thirty-two wisdoms"—each of the 32 channels contains a specific wisdom configuration, establishing **channel-wisdom identity**.

- **དོན་དམ་པའི་ཐིག་ལེ་སྒྲོན་མ་བཞིའི་སྨིན་སོ།** (13360): "Ultimate bindu, four lamps with maturation marks"—thig le (bindu) as the **point-instant** of awareness; smin sa (maturation site) as the **ripening locus**.

- **བཙན་ཐབས་སུ་སངས་རྒྱས།** (13361): "Buddhahood through forceful method"—btsan thabs (forceful method) refers to **aggressive/rapid paths** including sexual yoga and powa ('pho ba).

- **སྙིགས་མ་ལས་ཀུན་རྫོབ་ཀྱི་ཐིག་ལེར་གྱུར།** (13362): "Defilements transform into relative bindu"—snyigs ma (defilement/dross) as alchemical terminology, transformed rather than rejected.

- **ཀུན་རྫོབ་ཀྱི་སྨིན་སོ་དབང་པོ་ལྔ།** (13364): "Relative maturation marks as five senses"—the defiled bindu becomes the **sensory apparatus** of saṃsāra.

**Grammatical structures:**
The **causative** བྱེད་པ། appears extensively (13363, 13364, 13369), establishing **agency in physiological processes**. The **conditional-benefactive** ན།...བྱེད། (13365-13366) marks **soteriological potential**.

### <context>
**Tantric alchemy:**
The passage presents **rasāyana** (bcud len) and **kāyasādhana** integrated. The transformation of snyigs ma (defilements) into thig le (bindu) reflects **nidāna reversal**—the same substances that bind in saṃsāra liberate when recognized.

**Dzogchen path integration:**
Line 13361 specifies **bde ba lam du byas na** (when bliss is taken as path), establishing the **anuyoga** approach. The four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) are **Tögal** (thod rgal) terminology.

**Medical correlation:**
The defilements (snyigs ma) producing the five senses parallels **Tibetan medical** theory where **dri chen** (fecal waste) and **dri chu** (urine) are byproducts of digestion that must be properly eliminated.

### <concept>
**Ultimate and relative bindus:**
The text presents a **dual-bindu theory** (13360-13366):
- **Don dam thig le**: Ultimate bindu = four lamps, leads to Buddhahood when recognized
- **Kun rdzob thig le**: Relative bindu = five senses, perpetuates saṃsāra when fixated

This demonstrates **the non-duality of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa**: same substance, different recognition.

**Channels as wisdom-path:**
Line 13367 specifies **rtsa de dag gis ni ye shes kyi lam du gyur** (these channels become the wisdom-path). This is a radical **somatic soteriology**: the physical body, when properly recognized, IS the path to enlightenment—not an obstacle to transcend.

**The thirty-two wisdoms and 72,000 channels:**
The numerology (13359, 13376-13380) establishes **micro-macro correspondence**: 32 main channels each contain 32 wisdoms, expanding to 72,000 sub-channels. This reflects **Ayurvedic** nāḍī theory (72,000 nāḍīs) adapted to Dzogchen framework.

### <structure>
The passage presents **crown wheel completion** and **channel numerology synthesis**. Lines 13380-13411 establish:

1. **Mathematical correspondences** (13380-13407): 62 channels, 62 letters, 62 light-spheres, 124 parents
2. **Three hundred ten wisdom movements** (13406-13407)
3. **Wisdom-wind functions** (13407-13411): śamatha and vipaśyanā operations
4. **Existence-body as first** (13411): Srid pa lus kyi gzhi yin pas dang po

The structure creates a **computational cosmology** enumerating the subtle body's components.

### <philology>
**Technical terminology:**

- **བརྒྱ་ཉེར་བཞི།** (13381): "One hundred twenty-four"—the sum of 62 channels × 2 (left-right). The term establishes **bilateral symmetry** in channel anatomy.

- **ཡེ་ཤེས་འགྱུ་བའི་ཁྱད་པར་སུམ་བརྒྱ་དང་བཅུ་ཐམ་པ།** (13386): "Three hundred ten varieties of wisdom-movement"—'gyu ba (movement) indicates the **dynamic nature** of wisdom-energies.

- **ཞི་གནས་དང་ལྷག་མཐོང་གི་བྱེད་པ་ངེས་པར་རྟོགས་པར་བྱེད།** (13388): "Definitely realizes the operations of śamatha and vipaśyanā"—byed pa (operation/function) specifies the **active dimension** of meditation.

- **སྐྱེད་བྱེད་ཅེས་བྱ་སྟེ་སྲིད་པ་ལུས་ཀྱི་གཞི་ཡིན་པས་དང་པོ་ཞེས་བྱའོ།** (13389): "Called 'producer' because it is the ground of existence-body, thus called 'first'"—etymological analysis linking generation (bskyed) and existence (srid).

- **རྐྱེན་ཚོགས་པ་བྱེ་བྲག་གི་ཆོས་དགུ་བརྒྱ་དང་སུམ་ཅུ་ཐམ་པ།** (13396): "930 particular condition-gathered dharmas"—chos (dharmas) here means **phenomenal factors** in Abhidharma sense.

**Particle analysis:**
The **enumerative** ཏེ། appears extensively for mathematical summation. The **causal-final** བྱས་པས། establishes **resultative numerology**—numbers emerge from conditions.

### <context>
**Abhidharma integration:**
The enumeration of dharmas (chos) reflects **Sarvāstivāda** Abhidharma categories (75 dharmas) expanded to 930 in tantric physiology. The passage integrates **systematic Buddhist phenomenology** with tantric anatomy.

**Nyingma cosmology:**
The numbers reflect **Nyingma** subtle body theory:
- 62 channels = 31 major pairs
- 310 wisdoms = 5 elements × 62 channels
- 930 dharmas = 15 factors × 62 channels

**Embryological completion:**
Line 13389 identifies the **navel wheel** (skye byed 'khor lo) as **first** because it is the ground of existence-body. This establishes the **ontological priority** of the navel in tantric physiology.

### <concept>
**Numerology as mandala:**
The passage presents **sacred mathematics**: 62 + 62 + 62 + 124 = 310 wisdom-movements. These numbers are not arbitrary but represent **resonant frequencies** of enlightened energy. The body is literally a **mathematical mandala**.

**Śamatha and vipaśyanā as wind-functions:**
Line 13388 specifies that wisdom-wind movements (ye shes rlung gi 'phar ba dang shib pa) **realize** śamatha and vipaśyanā. This subverts standard presentations: meditation is not **done by** the practitioner but **occurs through** wind-energies when channels are open.

**The producer wheel as existence-ground:**
The etymology at 13389 analyzes **skye byed** (producer) as **srid pa lus kyi gzhi** (ground of existence-body). This establishes that **ordinary embodiment itself** is the first wheel—the foundation from which liberation emerges. There is no need to reject the body; it is already the **ground of awakening**.

Ground: indivisible, complete.

From *Rang shar*:
"Ground ultimate basis
Beyond saṃsāra
Beyond nirvāṇa
Source both
Indivisible complete"

**No Higher Ground:**
No ground beyond this ground.
No basis more fundamental.
No source more original.
This ground: ultimate, complete.

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"No ground beyond
No basis fundamental
No source original
This ground ultimate
This ground complete"

**Ground in Every Phenomenon:**
Every phenomenon: ground's expression.
Every appearance: ground's display.
Every experience: ground's manifestation.
Ground: all-pervading, complete.

From *De nyid*:
"Every phenomenon expression
Every appearance display
Every experience manifestation
Ground all-pervading complete"

### <structure>
The passage presents **consciousness wheel elaboration** and **mind distinctions**. Lines 13411-13451 establish:

1. **Sixteen-channel wheel** (13412-13428): Dran pa 'dus pa'i 'khor lo with sixteen minds
2. **Mind-wind correspondence** (13428-13436): Sixteen winds carrying minds
3. **Mind itself analysis** (13436-13441): Four aspects of mind-essence
4. **Sixfold mind-memory** (13441-13451): Yid kyi dran pa drug with rebirth destinations

The structure demonstrates **systematic psychology**—mental factors mapped onto physiological structures.

### <philology>
**Technical terminology:**

- **དྲན་པ་འདུས་པའི་འཁོར་ལོ་རྩ་བཅུ་དྲུག་གི་ནང་ན་སེམས་བཅུ་དྲུག་བརྟེན་ནས་གནས་པའོ།** (13428): "In the sixteen channels of the memory-gathering wheel, sixteen minds abide dependent"—dran pa 'dus (memory-gathering) identifies the **heart chakra** as the site where consciousness aggregates.

- **སྐྱེ་མེད་དོན་གྱི་སེམས་ཉིད།** (13437): "Mind-itself of unborn meaning"—skye med (unborn) marks the **ultimate nature** of mind free from origination.

- **འགག་མེད་དྲན་པའི་སེམས་ཉིད།** (13438): "Mind-itself of non-ceasing memory"—'gag med (non-ceasing) establishes **continuity without permanence**.

- **འགྱུར་མེད་དཔེ་དོན་འདྲེས་པའི་སེམས་ཉིད།** (13439): "Mind-itself of unchanging example-meaning mixture"—dpe don (example-meaning) refers to the **two truths** integrated.

- **རང་རྫོགས་དངོས་དོན་གང་དུ་ཡང་མ་ཕྱེ་བའི་སེམས་ཉིད་དོ།** (13440): "Mind-itself of self-perfected actual-meaning not divided anywhere"—rang rdzogs (self-perfected) is **Dzogchen** technical terminology.

**Particle constructions:**
The **ablative of source** ལས། appears extensively (13446, 13448, 13450), establishing **karmic causality** for rebirth destinations. The **locative of abiding** ན། marks **spatial-mental correspondence**.

### <context>
**Yogācāra psychology:**
The sixfold yid kyi dran pa (mind-memories) correspond to **Yogācāra** analysis of manas and mano-vijñāna. The passage integrates **consciousness-only** theory with tantric physiology.

**Rebirth cosmology:**
The destinations (lha, lha min, mi, byol song, yi dwags, dmyal ba) follow standard **six realms** ( 'gro drug) cosmology. The text presents **how mental factors determine rebirth**.

**Dzogchen mind-essence:**
Lines 13436-13441 present the **four mind-itself aspects**, a **Dzogchen** classification establishing mind as:
1. Unborn (skye med)
2. Non-ceasing ('gag med)
3. Unchanging ('gyur med)
4. Self-perfected (rang rdzogs)

### <concept>
**The sixteen minds and their winds:**
The text presents a **sophisticated psychosomatic theory**: each of sixteen minds in the heart wheel has a corresponding wind-horse (rlung rta). The mind rides the wind like a rider on a horse—**consciousness requires energy** to function.

**Mind-memory and rebirth mechanism:**
Lines 13444-13451 establish **how mental factors create rebirth**:
- **Kun tu tshol byed** (searching-everywhere) → clean/unclean/perverted destination
- **Gtan la 'bebs pa** (definitive-establishing) → vidyādhara/god/animal destination
- **Nges par 'jog pa** (certain-establishing) → khechara/human/desire-realm destination

This demonstrates **karmic intentionality**: the **mode** of mind determines the **destination** of rebirth.

**Mind-itself beyond elaboration:**
The fourfold analysis (13436-13441) presents **mind-itself** (sems nyid) as:
- Beyond birth and cessation
- Beyond example and meaning
- Beyond division
- Self-perfected

This is the **Dzogchen view**: mind is not something to be achieved but **already complete**.
