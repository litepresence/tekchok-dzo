<classification> Four immeasurables: love, compassion, joy, equanimity. Longchenpa's systematic presentation of four brahmaviharas (tshad med bzhi). Structural markers rim pa organize immeasurables from coarse to subtle: love countering hostility, compassion countering cruelty, joy countering jealousy, equanimity countering attachment-aversion. Graduated approach reflects Buddhist lam rim structure adapted to Dzogchen. Risk of reification: treating immeasurables as achievements rather than natural expressions.

<classification> Structural analysis: passage demonstrates Longchenpa's systematic presentation. Rim pa markers organize four brahmaviharas from coarse to subtle. Graduated approach reflects Buddhist lam rim adapted to Dzogchen. Risk of view-collapse: mistaking structural analysis for doctrinal assertion.

<classification> Philological analysis: term byams pa (love/maitri) carries technical sense of wishing happiness for all beings. Compound snying rje (compassion/karuna) appears alongside near-synonyms requiring precision. Instrumental particles indicate how each immeasurable serves as antidote to specific affliction. Causative construction sgom pa establishes active nature—they must be deliberately developed before becoming spontaneous. Risk of view-collapse: treating philological analysis as doctrinal position.

<classification> Contextual analysis: citations from Thal 'gyur, Rang shar, Nyi zla kha sbyor establish doctrinal authority. Four immeasurables represent common Mahayana foundation that Atiyoga presupposes—Dzogchen does not bypass conventional bodhicitta but includes it within ultimate bodhicitta recognition. Risk of reification: treating context as endorsement of hierarchical vehicle structure.

<classification> Structural progression: from specific immeasurables to equanimity reflects graduated pedagogical approach—first cultivate partial love/compassion, then expand to all beings equally. Section follows Nyingma doxographical conventions presenting relative bodhicitta practices as indispensable foundation for absolute bodhicitta realization. Risk of view-collapse: treating relative bodhicitta as necessary cause rather than recognition-facilitating condition.

<classification> Conclusion of posture section: Dharmakaya manner and liberation modalities. Closing verse summarizes using term tshul (manner/way) as hermeneutical marker indicating systematic completeness. Rhetorical question establishes epistemic authority—posture efficacious for whoever understands body-piths in harmony. Phrase rnal 'byor dag tu byed pa signals section's soteriological function within treatise progression from theory to application. Risk of reification: treating manner as technique rather than recognition-facilitating condition.

<classification> Continuation: structural pivot linking posture instructions to soteriological result. Ablative -las indicates separation from cycle; instrumental marks three bodies as agents of intent. Term brda (sign/indication) with temporal qualifiers establishes postures as prophetic indicators of future liberation modalities: asceticism for Nirmanakaya, spontaneous completion for Sambhogakaya, fearlessness for Dharmakaya. Risk of view-collapse: treating indicators as predictions rather than recognition-descriptions.

<classification> Context: Longchenpa articulates metaphysical premise—three bodies exist as innate endowments within heart, posture merely manifests what is already present. Reflects Nyingma result vehicle position contrasting with Causal Vehicle gradualism. Element-body correlation: cold constitution Nirmanakaya, hot Dharmakaya, balanced Sambhogakaya. Traditional Tibetan medical constitutional theory integrated with Dzogchen soteriology. Risk of reification: treating constitutional correlations as deterministic rather than recognition-facilitating.

<classification> Conceptual analysis: distinction between ordinary sitting and precious posture. Snake-limb metaphor illustrates principle—just as snake's limbs manifest only when coiled, wisdom manifests only through specific bodily arrangement. Three epistemic conditions: blocking (without bending body, channels blocked), raising (vision increases with proper gaze), coiling (precious posture enables wisdom when ordinary sitting fails). Risk of view-collapse: treating conditions as causes rather than recognition-facilitating circumstances.

<classification> Section transitions from posture theory to application through soteriological principle—three poisons manifest as three bodies. Structure: thesis (three afflictions bind to three realms, liberated through three postures), analysis by poison type (desire, ignorance, aversion), conclusion (three postures determinate). Uses rebirth typology—bird, pig, snake—from wheel of existence tradition. Risk of reification: treating typology as permanent categories rather than provisional recognition-patterns.

<classification> Philological analysis: ablative las marks causal origin of rebirth forms. Particle ni serves topicalizing function introducing each rebirth type. Term smos pa (ripened/manifested) appears indicating smin pa process by which karmic predispositions manifest as specific embodied forms. Logical connector relates analysis to prescription. Risk of view-collapse: treating causal language as literal rather than pedagogical.

<classification> Contextual integration: three systems—karmic causality (three poisons produce three rebirth destinies), constitutional psychology (each rebirth type exhibits specific somatic/psychological characteristics), somatic remediation (each type harmonizes with specific postures). Bird-type (desire-dominated) speech-predominant, harmonizes with Sambhogakaya posture. Pig-type (ignorance-dominated) mind-predominant, harmonizes with Dharmakaya posture. Snake-type (aversion-dominated) body-predominant, harmonizes with Nirmanakaya posture. Risk of reification: treating correlations as fixed rather than recognition-facilitating.

<classification> Two liberation principles: path-obstacle clearing (three postures liberate from binding of body, speech, mind), numerical sufficiency (exactly three postures required—more unnecessary, fewer incomplete). Transition to ngag gi gnad section using term smra ba bcad pa as pivot. Triadic structure: body postures established, now speech training, mind to follow. Risk of view-collapse: treating sufficiency as ontological rather than pedagogical.

<classification> Speech pith introduction: training, abiding, swallowing. Opens with citation from Thal 'gyur establishing scriptural authority for three aspects of speech training. Verse structure uses tricolon with anaphora, common in Dzogchen instructional literature. Maintains triadic pattern from posture section.

<classification> Philological: continuative de ltar links preceding posture instructions to speech training. Term bslab pa (training) appears with progressive intensification: brief sessions then extended. Verb bcad pa (cut) appears in compounds establishing semantics of restriction. Term la bzla ba (swallowing) glossed as not uttering mantra—total cessation of verbalization. Risk of view-collapse: treating cessation as technique rather than natural state.
