<structure>

**Organizational Context:** This passage initiates a subsection within Chapter 4 concerning the analysis of the ultimate nature (don dam pa) and the classification of Svātantrika (brtag nyung) philosophical positions. The text presents two primary divisions within the Svātantrika school regarding the nature of ultimate truth: (1) those who assert the illusion-like ultimate (sgyu ma don dam) and (2) those who assert complete non-abiding (rab tu mi gnas pa). This enumeration establishes the framework for understanding the range of Svātantrika positions on emptiness.

**Structural Composition:** The passage exhibits a clear three-part structure:
- Verse 3037: Presentation of the general Svātantrika position—that wisdom (rig pa'i ye shes) is empty of inherent existence (ngo bo nyid med pa)
- Verse 3038: First subdivision—those who assert the illusion-like ultimate (sgyu ma don dam du 'dod pa)
- Verse 3039: Second subdivision—those who assert complete non-abiding (rab tu mi gnas pa)

This bipartite division represents the classic Svātantrika classification, distinguishing between positions that maintain some positive characterization of emptiness versus those emphasizing complete negation.

<context>

**Doctrinal Context:** This passage engages the Svātantrika (brtag nyung) branch of Madhyamaka philosophy, as distinguished from the Prāsaṅgika (thal 'gyur) school. The Svātantrikas, while accepting the emptiness of inherent existence, maintained certain positive characterizations of ultimate truth, leading to internal divisions.

**The Two Divisions:**

1. **Illusion-like Ultimate (sgyu ma don dam):** This position holds that ultimate truth is like a magical illusion—appearing to exist while actually being empty. This preserves the positive function of ultimate truth as an object of realization while denying its inherent existence.

2. **Complete Non-abiding (rab tu mi gnas pa):** This more radical position asserts that ultimate truth completely transcends all conceptual constructs—it cannot be characterized as existing, non-existing, or both. This approaches the Prāsaṅgika position.

**Historical Context:** These positions reflect the debates within Indian Madhyamaka, particularly the works of Bhāvaviveka (c. 500-578) and his followers. The classification became standard in Tibetan doxographical traditions, especially in the Gelug school's analysis of philosophical vehicles.

**Philosophical Implications:**

The passage addresses fundamental questions in Madhyamaka epistemology:
- **Nature of Wisdom:** Whether wisdom (ye shes) has inherent nature or is empty
- **Object of Realization:** Whether ultimate truth is a positive entity or complete negation
- **Relationship to Appearances:** How conventional appearance relates to ultimate truth

The Svātantrika position that wisdom "lacks self-nature" (ngo bo nyid med pa) aligns with the core Madhyamaka insight that all phenomena—including cognitive events—are empty of inherent existence. This prevents the reification of awareness into a substantial entity.

**Illusion-Like Ultimate:** This position attempts to preserve the meaningfulness of spiritual realization by allowing ultimate truth to function as an object of knowledge while denying its substantial existence. The meditation on illusion serves as the path—practitioners recognize that all appearances, including wisdom, are like magical displays.

**Complete Non-abiding:** This position emphasizes the radical emptiness of all phenomena, including the ultimate. Nothing can be designated as "ultimate truth" in a substantial sense—ultimate truth is precisely the lack of inherent existence. This position approaches the Prāsaṅgika view that even emptiness cannot be asserted as a positive entity.

** soteriological Significance:** The distinction has practical implications for meditation practice. The illusion-like view provides a more accessible object for contemplation, while the non-abiding view leads to more complete release from conceptual attachment to any doctrine about reality.
