[998-998] <structure>

**Organizational Context:** This verse describes the third and highest tier (bang rim gsum pa) of the Heaven of the Thirty-Three (sum cu rtsa gsum), representing the pinnacle of desire-realm divine existence within this particular heaven. As the final tier before transitioning to higher heavens and ultimately to the form realm, this verse marks the culmination of the desire-realm's spectrum of sensory pleasure.

**Structural Function:** This verse completes the triad of tiered descriptions within the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. The three-tier progression demonstrates an escalating trajectory: (1) protective/ceremonial function → (2) aesthetic refinement → (3) complete sensory absorption. This ascending pattern illustrates the Buddhist analysis of desire-realm existence as progressively subtler forms of attachment.

**Tibetan Text Analysis:**
- གསུམ་པ་ (gsum pa): "Third" - ordinal numeral derived from གསུམ (gsum) with the -pa nominalizing suffix; indicates the highest position in the three-tier hierarchy
- ལ་ (la): dative-locative particle establishing the domain being described
- སྦྲང་ཆང (sbrang chang): "honey-wine, mead" - compound noun; སྦྲང (sbrang) denotes bee/honey, ཆང (chang) denotes fermented alcoholic beverage; together refer to an intoxicant produced from honey
- གིས (gis): instrumental-ergative particle indicating the means/agent of intoxication
- རྟག་ཏུ (rtag tu): adverbial phrase meaning "constantly, perpetually, always" - from རྟག (rtag) meaning "permanent/constant" plus ཏུ (tu) ablative-directional suffix
- མྱོས་པ (myos pa): "intoxicated, drunk, engrossed" - past-tense participle from མྱོས (myos) meaning to become intoxicated or absorbed; indicates state of sensory immersion
- འི་ (yi): relative particle connecting the descriptive phrase to the following noun
- ལྷ (lha): "god, deity" - the nominal core indicating these are divine beings

**Grammatical Analysis:** The structure mirrors the previous verse with གསུམ་པ་ལ་ establishing the tier, followed by an elaborate descriptive clause. The instrumental གིས་ connects the means (honey-wine) to the resulting state (intoxication). The adverb རྟག་ཏུ emphasizes the perpetual nature of this intoxication, distinguishing it from temporary human intoxication.

**Cosmological Setting:** The Heaven of the Thirty-Three (Trayastrimsa) occupies a specific position in Buddhist cosmology—above the Four Great Kings' heaven on the lower slopes of Mount Sumeru, yet below the Yāma heavens and the Tuṣita heaven where future Buddhas reside. The thirty-three gods include various classes: the Trāyastriṃśa proper, the Śakras, and the Ahindras.

**Comparative Analysis:** This verse's depiction of divine intoxication parallels descriptions in other Buddhist texts of heavenly pleasures. The honey-wine represents a more subtle form of pleasure than coarse material enjoyment. In Buddhist ethical analysis, even divine pleasure—even that which arises from meritorious action—remains a form of attachment keeping beings bound in saṃsāra.

**Connection to Form Realm:** The progression from the first tier (physical protection) through the second tier (aesthetic appreciation) to the third tier (sensory absorption) parallels the progression toward form-realm meditative absorptions (dhyāna). The intoxicated state approaches the absorption of form-realm meditation, representing a transition point between desire and form realms.

**Symbolic Interpretation:** The honey-wine (sbrang chang) symbolizes the subtlest form of desire-realm pleasure. Unlike gross sensory pleasures, intoxication represents an altered state of consciousness—a more subtle engagement with sensory objects that approaches the meditative absorptions of higher realms. This marks the limit of desire-realm existence before transitioning to form-realm states.

** soteriological Implications:** From the Great Perfection perspective, even these elevated divine states remain within the cycle of appearance and attachment. The perpetual intoxication represents a state where beings are so absorbed in pleasure that they forget the suffering of saṃsāra and the need for liberation. This illustrates how even the most desirable saṃsāric states keep beings from awakening.

**Karmic Context:** These divine states arise from specific karmic patterns—meritorious actions combined with attachment to sensory pleasure. The three-tier structure demonstrates how different types of meritorious action yield different levels of divine rebirth within the same heaven, with each tier representing a more refined mode of experiencing the results of past good conduct.

**Pedagogical Function:** This detailed cosmological enumeration serves the Abhisamayālaṃkāra's pedagogical purpose of mapping all phenomena a bodhisattva must know. Understanding the structure of saṃsāric realms—including their subtle gradations—enables practitioners to recognize the nature of all conditioned existence and cultivate appropriate equanimity toward even the most elevated worldly states.
