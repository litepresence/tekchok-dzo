## Four Empowerments

**Vase Empowerment (bum dbang):** The first of four empowerments. Includes preparatory requirements (deity, vase, student), ritual substances (auspicious items), empowerment substance (tsaka-li, statues), and consecration sequence (Vajra blessing, name-empowerment, command-seal).

This configures the body as vase for enlightenment—ripening the body basis for tantric practice.

**Secret Empowerment (gsang dbang):** Second empowerment—ripens the speech. Involves mantra recitation, secret substances, and initiation into mandala.

**Knowledge-Word Empowerment (shes pa'i tshig dbang):** Third—ripens the mind. Pointing out directly to the nature of mind.

**Precious Empowerment (rin po che dbang):** Fourth—ripens beyond these. The utterly unelaborate introduction to self-recognizing wisdom.

These four correspond to the outer, inner, secret, and perfect aspects—each preparing the practitioner for recognizing the nature that is always already present.

The empowerment establishes the practitioner as suitable vessel for tantric practice. The vase empowerment configures body as support for enlightenment. The secret empowerment ripens speech for mantra practice. The knowledge-word empowerment introduces the nature of mind directly. The precious empowerment completes the recognition.

From the Dzogchen perspective, these are skillful means for those who need them—but the recognition they point to is already present, not caused by the empowerment.
