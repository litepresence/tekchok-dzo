# Definition Analysis
**Consideration:** Longchenpa provides etymological analysis (*nges tshig*) of the three components:

**Thig (Bindu):**
- Self-abiding round light (*rang gnas 'od zlum*)
- Unchanging (*mi 'gyur*)

**Le:**
- Pervades objects widely (*yul la khyab par gdal*)

**Stong pa (Empty):**
- Cannot identify things (*dngos po ngos gzung du med*)
- Five self-lights blaze — thus "lamp"

<historical-context>
Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The verse provides the tantric basis for the etymology:
- Bindu is unchanging, straight
- Free of primordial fabrication
- Le is great wide expansion
- All appearances complete in their own place
- Emptiness is thing-holding
- Minds attached to objects cease
- Great emptiness nature
- Self-attachment mind does not appear clearly
- Lamp makes five lights appear
- With clear recognition of self-face
- These are the definitive words

<doxographical-placement>
Citation from *mu tig 'phreng ba* (*Pearl Garland Tantra*):
The peacock simile illustrates the bindu-emptiness relationship:
- Like the peacock's essence
- Bindu has no change
- Le pervades and appears to objects
- Emptiness has no thing-marks
- Lamp becomes appearing darkness

<architectural-analysis>
# Fivefold Classification
**Philological analysis:** Longchenpa establishes five types of bindus (*dbye ba rnam pa lnga*):

1. **Gnas pa gzhi'i thig le** — Abiding ground bindu
   - Heart (*snying ga*), wisdom hero-bullet (*ye shes kyi dpa' be'u*)
   - Dividing line (*gyes mdo*) of samsara-nirvana
   - Source (*'byung gnas*)
   - Abides at exhaustion (*zad sar gnas*)

2. **Lus gnas rtsa'i thig le** — Body-abiding channel bindu
   - Like special great channel
   - Self-luminous
   - Abides as bliss-pain self-liberated, primordially liberated

3. **Kun rdzob rgyu'i thig le** — Conventional cause bindu
   - In roma (*ro ma*), etc.
   - Merely holds body constituents (*zungs*)
   - As holding agent

4. **Don dam spros pa med pa'i thig le** — Ultimate elaboration-free bindu
   - Awareness primordially pure from ka
   - Abides in space-awareness exhaustion intention

5. **Rang byung 'bras bu'i thig le** — Self-arisen fruit bindu
   - Appears manifest to sense powers
   - Day and night mix into light-clarity
   - Engages in great complete liberation of buddha intention

<linguistic-analysis>
Technical terminology:
- *Dpa' be'u* (hero-bullet): tantric anatomical term for energetic center
- *Gyes mdo* (dividing line): boundary marker
- *Zad sa* (exhaustion place): point of complete emptying
- *Roma* (roma): left energetic channel
- *Zungs* (constituents): bodily essences
- *'Dzin byed* (holding agent): functional capacity

<grammatical-examination>
The term *don dam* (ultimate) with *spros pa med pa* (without elaboration) indicates the *niṣprapañca* nature of the fourth bindu type.

<linguistic-analysis>
Analysis of *rig pa ka nas dag pas*:
The phrase indicates primordial purity (*ka dag*) as the starting point (*ka nas*) of awareness. The locative *la* following *dgongs pa* situates the bindu "in the intention of space-awareness exhaustion."

<concept>
The fifth bindu (*rang byung 'bras bu'i thig le*) appears in immediate manifest perception (*dbang po'i mngon sum*) and represents the "mixing" (*'dres*) of day-night dualities into non-dual light-clarity. This "mixing" is not a blending of substances but a recognition of inseparability.

<historical-context>
Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (*Blazing Lamp Tantra*):
The verse enumerates the five bindus in metric form:
- Division itself is of five aspects
- Through the bindu of base-abiding self-awareness: samsara-existence gathered as one
- Through channel-body bindu: bliss and suffering gathered as one
- Through conventional cause bindu: aggregates-consciousness producing cause-conditions; aggregates-elements gathered as one
- Through ultimate elaboration-free bindu: space and awareness gathered as one
- Through self-arisen fruit bindu: all buddhas' intentions gathered into effort-accomplishment-free space

Through that division, from unchangeable empty bindu, five aspects of appearance-aspects of objects are clear in the location of gathering as one.

<grammatical-examination>
The repetitive structure *thig le yis* (through the bindu) creates anaphoric emphasis on the instrumental function of each bindu type. The verb *bzlums* (gathered as one) implies non-dual integration.

<structural-mapping>
# Characteristics Analysis
**Examination:** Longchenpa explains that emptiness free of moon-phases (*zla dang bral ba'i stong pa*) — referring to the waxing and waning of conceptual elaboration — when arising as the object of sense powers, abides in the meditation of river-flow without meditation (*ma bsgoms chu bo rgyun gyi bsam gtan*).

<context>
Citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"Self-characteristic empty of essence / whatever manifest attachment ceases / self-called unchanging thought-free pure / non-meditated and without gap / bindu free of moon-phases itself / in self-abiding great intention / divisions actions flow abiding in rock-middle / characteristic emptiness clear pervades."

[16565] <linguistic-analysis> The phrase *mngon par zhen pa* (manifest attachment) employs *mngon par* as intensifier, indicating explicit, overt grasping.

<architectural-analysis>
# Location Analysis
**Investigation:** Longchenpa identifies four special great channels (*khyad par chen po'i rtsa bzhi*):

1. **Ka ti gser gyi rtsa chen** — Ka-ti gold great channel
   - Good ground bindu (*gzhi'i thig le bzang po*) abides self-arisen

2. **Dar dkar snal ma lta bu** — Like white silk filament
   - Good path bindu (*lam gyi thig le bzang po*) entering the lamp
   - Fine, coiled (*phra la 'khril*)
   - Good peak bindu (*bzang po rtse mo'i thig le*) self-arising clearly

3. **Shel sbug can** — Crystal cavity
   - Good ornament-possessing bindu (*bzang po'i rgyan dang ldan pa'i thig le*) appears as light-clarity

<grammatical-examination>
Anatomical terminology:
- *Ka ti* (ka-ti): tantric name for central energetic channel
- *Gser gyi rtsa* (gold channel): synonym for central channel
- *Dar dkar* (white silk): fine, pure channel quality
- *Snal ma* (filament): thread-like energetic pathway
- *Shel sbug* (crystal cavity): clear, transparent energetic center
- *'Khril* (coiled): spiral configuration

<context>
Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
The verse establishes the four channels as locations:
- Sentient beings' body center
- From citta jewel palace
- Although channels are thousands in number
- From four special great channels
- Ka-ti gold great channel
- Like white silk filament
- Fine coiled and crystal cavity
- Inside these four, especially
- Abiding and riding the horse of wind
- Arising, entering, self-arising
- As self-nature of appearance
- Although primordially without elaboration
- Base bindu good and path bindu likewise good
- Good peaks and good ornaments
- Abide inside channels

[16590] <philology> The phrase *rlung gi rta la zhon* (riding the horse of wind) is a standard Dzogchen metaphor for the movement of subtle energy (*rlung*) that carries awareness.

[16591] <concept> The threefold movement (*'byung dang 'jug dang rang shar*): arising (emanation), entering (withdrawal), and self-arising (spontaneous manifestation) correspond to the triad of *thod rgal* visionary processes.

[16600] <structural-mapping> # Door Analysis
**Close reading:** Transition marker indicating the next topic: the door (*sgo*) of the Empty Bindu Lamp.

<structure>
# Door Analysis (Continued)
**Consideration:** Longchenpa identifies the door (*sgo*) as arising from the center of the eye's clarity (*mig gi dngas ma'i dkyil las*). Generally, all four lamps appear; particularly, the Empty Bindu Lamp with self-light appears.

<context>
Citation from the tantra:
"Sentient beings' eye not obscured by conditions / from the door called cakṣu / like the sun mandala / as self-light and rays / completely appearing as self-parts."

<philology>
The Sanskrit term *cakṣu* (eye) appears in Tibetan transliteration (*tsak+Shu*), indicating direct tantric transmission. The phrase *rkyen gyis ma bsgribs* (not obscured by conditions) establishes the unimpeded nature of primordial perception.

<concept>
Distribution of Lamps in the Eyes:
- Generally (*spyir*): from right eye — Far-Casting and Wisdom two
- From left eye — Bindu and Sphere two
- Brahma-aperture: awareness body in the manner of blazing lamp

This establishes a bilateral physiological correspondence with the four lamps.

<context>
Citation from *mu tig 'phreng ba* (*Pearl Garland Tantra*):
"The path of beings / is the door of the seer / that itself right two left two center / abides in the manner of blazing lamp."

<structure>
# Nature Analysis
**Historical Context:** Longchenpa explains the nature (*rang bzhin*) of the Empty Bindu Lamp:
- Arises as empty bindu of spontaneous light-luminosity from first primordially pure nature
- Like water-moon (*chu zla*): reflective but without substantiality

<context>
Citation from *dbang rnam par phye ba* (*Distinguishing Empowerment*):
"Ignorance darkness dispelling empty bindu / wonderful great appearance to objects of sense powers."

<context>
Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"From emptiness self-returning / in the appearance of clear experience / together with five primordial resounds / abiding through nature's flow / to the essence of clear agents / reverse-enter from things / not in emptiness / in the first of self-luminous knowing / as primordial self-characteristic / from first great primordial purity / nature itself is like this / by no one made, self-luminous / primordially itself is nature."

<philology>
Technical terminology:
- *Rang log* (self-returning): reflexive turning-back
- *Myong byed* (experience agent): cognitive function
- *Ye gdangs* (primordial resound): timeless vibration
- *Rang bzhin babs* (nature's flow): spontaneous descent/flow
- *Gsar byed* (clear agent): illuminating function
- *Log par zhugs* (reverse-enter): entering against the stream
- *Rang gsal shes pa* (self-luminous knowing): reflexive awareness

<structure>
# Manner of Abiding from the Beginning
**Consideration:** Longchenpa distinguishes:
- Ground-time (*gzhi ka dag gi dus*): Four lamps exist in subtle inner clarity as spontaneous parts
- Ground-appearance arising (*gzhi snang du shar dus*): appearances arise as:
  - Five light rays of sphere
  - Body-parts in each bindu's light-house
  - Far-Casting as self-luminous light-ray connecting-cord
  - Wisdom arising as awareness — liberation-delusion merely as recognition/non-recognition

[16646] <philology> The phrase *lus la gnas dus* (time of abiding in the body) serves as transitional marker to the next section.

<structure>
# Body Abiding Analysis
**Terminological Precision:** Longchenpa describes the subtle physiology of bindu manifestation:
- From inside heart to eye: light-root makes path to appearance
- This bindu: in heart as five-light palace, round rim of five, abiding self-essence
- Distant-noose in lamp clearly
- Between-essence (*bar gdangs*) in sky: five-light round gather, slight trembling
- Lamp itself outwardly appearing: from that expanding self-essence immeasurable arise
- From heart-center inner bindu included: actual lamp, clear lamp
- Abiding at the door of non-abiding in the gatherer
- Like bird flocks: nature clear

<philology>
Technical terminology:
- *Snying nang* (inside heart): subtle anatomical location
- *'Od rtsa* (light-root): energetic basis for luminosity
- *'Od lnga'i pho brang* (five-light palace): visionary structure
- *Mu khyud lnga* (five rims): boundary markers
- *Rang gdangs* (self-essence): intrinsic luminosity
- *Bar gdangs* (between-essence): intermediate manifestation
- *'Gul phrig* (trembling): subtle movement
- *Shas chung* (small portion): minute degree

[16653] <concept> The paradox "abiding at the door of non-abiding" (*tshang na mi gnas sgor gnas pa*) reflects the Dzogchen principle that true abiding is non-abiding — the bindu manifests precisely at the point where fixation is released.

<structure>
# Object-Appearance Analysis
**Technical Examination:** Longchenpa addresses the question: To what object does [the bindu] appear?

- Appears as self-essence light with pure intermediate-space
- Citation from tantra: "Intermediate-space itself is emptiness / appearance not ceasing self-face / self-arisen great bindu abides / unexpressable self-abide essence / primordially appears in sky element."

<philology>
The phrase *bar snang nyid ni stong pa la* (intermediate-space itself is to emptiness) employs the emphatic *nyid* to stress identity: intermediate-space IS emptiness, not merely like or related to it.

<structure>
# Measure Analysis
**Hermeneutical Frame:** Longchenpa defines the measure (*tshad*) of actual lamp:
- Space-awareness appearing without day-night
- Through this: liberation measure of samsara into nirvana

<context>
Citation from tantra:
"Without bindu emanating and gathering / in intermediate-space itself who holds / becomes that measure / appears as sign of effort-free liberation / for effort-possessing, effort measure."

<philology>
The phrase *spro dang bsdu med par* (without emanating and gathering) negates the dualistic process of projection and withdrawal, indicating non-dual luminosity.

<structure>
# Actual Lamp Face-Grasping
**Close Reading:** Longchenpa describes the direct recognition (*ngo gzung*) of the actual lamp:

Bindu surrounded by round rim of five lights, possessing appearances of each of the six races:

1. **Gods (*lha*)**: Self hand-span, white, very large
2. **Demigods (*lha min*)**: Self hand, green
3. **Humans (*mi*)**: Self thumb-span, red-clear
4. **Animals (*byol song*)**: Not capable of outward viewing, naturally blue exists
5. **Hungry ghosts (*yi dwags*)**: Not outward, yellow
6. **Hells (*dmyal ba*)**: Not outwardly appearing, naturally five-colored

Bad destinies (*ngan song*) — due to small virtue portion, not outwardly appearing; inside, only a small portion exists self-complete.

<philology>
The possessive *la* indicates the "size" appropriate to each realm: gods have large bindus (hand-span), humans have smaller (thumb-span), lower realms have only internal/natural presence without outward manifestation.

<context>
Citation from *thal 'gyur* (*Result-Come* tantra):
"To all buddhas and sentient beings / pervaded by non-different, natureless / that and buddhas completely pure complete / abide free of stainless dust / from the appearance-aspect of six-race sentient beings / abide in each continuum / gods are self-clear complete / to demigods fine and flickering."

<concept>
The citation establishes the universal presence of the bindu across all six realms, with variations in clarity based on karmic condition. This reflects the Dzogchen view that *thod rgal* vision is potential for all beings, though manifest realization depends upon karmic readiness.

<context>
Continuation of *thal 'gyur* and *sgron ma 'bar ba* citations:
The verses complete the six-realm typology of bindu manifestation:
- Humans: self-luminous round itself
- Animals: inwardly luminous
- Pretas: subtle
- Hells: self-appearance complete

<context>
Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"The bindu of five-light gathering / to gods self-high extent / round self-luminous great exists / demigods self-hand extent / humans self-thumb extent / round without leak exists / to animals not outwardly appearing / to pretas self-face subtle exists / to hells self-luminous mere / to gods white greatly appears / demigods likewise green great / to humans red-luminous self-attachment free / animals sun-blue great portion / pretas yellow likewise / to hells five colors / abiding in the part of self-luminous awareness / actual lamp is likewise."

<philology>
Color symbolism:
- White: gods (clarity, purity)
- Green: demigods (energy, strife)
- Red: humans (passion, intensity)
- Blue: animals (instinct, darkness)
- Yellow: pretas (hunger, earth)
- Five colors: hells (confusion, totality)

<structure>
# Practice Method Analysis
**Technical Examination:** Longchenpa provides the eleventh topic: method of practice (*de nyams su blang thabs*):

- At place without aperture, slowly press with thumb and finger
- Many lamps, lights, and bindus appear
- Release effort and look to the extent of the appearance-gap
- Practice thus: night appears as light-clarity
- Appearance-darkness mixing is liberation into samsara-nirvana
- Without red color, self-luminous five-possessing: method of effort-free taking

<philology>
Technical terminology:
- *Bu ga med pa'i gnas* (place without aperture): sealed point
- *Mtheb mdzub* (thumb and finger): manual positioning
- *Dal bus mnan* (slowly press): gradual application
- *Rtsol ba btang* (release effort): non-doing
- *Ya mal* (gap): intermediate space
- *Lnga ldan* (five-possessing): having five aspects
- *Len lugs* (taking manner): method of engagement

<concept>
The method distinguishes:
- Effort-free (*rtsol med*): direct recognition without manipulation
- Effort-possessing (*rtsol bcas*): provisional technique for those needing structure

The warning about red color (*kha dog dmar po med par*) indicates the pure luminosity beyond passionate attachment.

<context>
Extended citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba*:
"With self-thumb and finger / pressing cakṣu cavity and side / first appearing through mind-trust / through familiarized essential point / without red portion, five-possessing / becomes sky-appearing person / by this obtains awareness self-power / that is effort-free self-liberation / effort-possessor also thus / self-nape outer power / fierce vibrating and leaping / with finger and finger press again / eye posture skillfully do / light clear until arrow-extent / hold all times of seizing that / as instruction of that method / all these become that."

<philology>
The phrase *mjing pa'i phyi rol rtsal* (outer power of nape) refers to the energetic activation at the base of the skull. The verb *'phrig* (vibrate) and *'phar* (leap) describe the spontaneous energetic movement.

[16737] <philology> The measurement *mda' gang* (arrow-extent) is a standard Tibetan measure of distance (approximately 150-200 meters), here indicating the projected range of visionary light.

[16742] <philology> The transitional phrase *rtse chung gi nang du* (inside the small tip) indicates the beginning of the next topic: the subtle channels within the bindu structure.

[16742] <structure> # Channel Analysis
**Detailed Analysis:** Longchenpa describes the internal structure:
- Inside the small tip: two channels, elements, clarity descending
- Channel-blood clarity mixed with essence

This establishes the physiological basis for the visionary experience.

---

**Summary:** These ten pages (391-400) contain Longchenpa's detailed exposition of the first two of the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) in the *thod rgal* context. The Water Lamp (*rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma*) and Empty Bindu Lamp (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*) receive systematic treatment following a structural schema that moves from essence to practice method. The exposition interweaves scriptural citations (*sgron ma 'bar ba*, *mu tig 'phreng ba*, *thal 'gyur*), anatomical detail (*ka ti* channel, *a 'bras* structure), and technical terminology characteristic of the *sNying thig* tradition. Longchenpa's method demonstrates the encyclopedic (*mdzod*) genre's commitment to comprehensive classification while maintaining the Dzogchen emphasis on direct recognition beyond effort.

<structure>
# Completion of the Twelve Similes Section
**Syntactic Structure:** Longchenpa completes the twelfth topic (*mthun dpe*) of the second lamp's eleven-fold analysis. The section employs a quadripartite simile structure comparing bindu (*thig le*) manifestations to:
1. Peacock tail (*rma bya'i mdongs*) - round self-resounding
2. Vulture eye (*pha khra'i mig*) - clarity portion and resound portion
3. Fish eye (*nya'i mig*) - luminous appearance and bindu particles
4. Thief's eye (*rkun mo'i mig*) - sparkle radiance and light rays

The citation from *sgron ma 'bar ba* (lines 16751-16755) authenticates these similes as standard Nyingthig technical vocabulary rather than literary ornamentation.

<structure>
# The Third Lamp: dbyings rnam par dag pa'i sgron ma
**Investigation:** Longchenpa inaugurates the third of the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*): The Lamp of the Completely Pure Sphere. The structural schema follows the established eleven-topic format:
1. ngo bo (essence)
2. nges tshig (definition)
3. dbye ba (classification)
4. rang bzhin (nature)
5. mtshan nyid (characteristic)
6. goms tshul (familiarization manner)
7. tshad (measure)
8. gnas (abode)
9. sgo (door)
10. dngos (actual)
11. mthun dpe (simile)

This architectural consistency reflects the *mdzod* genre's encyclopedic imperative toward systematic classification.
