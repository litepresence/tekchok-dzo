[8675] <philology>
*gsum pa bde ba ste sems dang ye shes 'khrug pa'i dus* — "Third: bliss, the time when mind and wisdom are stirred." *bde ba* (bliss) as catalyst; *'khrug pa* (stirred/activated) indicates dynamic awakening of wisdom.

[8675] <context>
Tantric context where bliss (*bde ba*) serves as gateway to wisdom. In Vajrayāna, bliss is deliberately cultivated as method (*upāya*) for wisdom realization, unlike śrāvaka practice where it may be seen as distraction.

[8675] <concept>
Union of bliss and wisdom (*bde ba dang ye shes zung 'jug*). The "stirring" indicates wisdom's activation through refined experience. Corresponds to three kāyas: Dharmakāya (wisdom), Saṃbhogakāya (bliss), Nirmāṇakāya (activity).
