# Karmic Winds Purified as Wisdom Winds: Foundation of the Four Lamps

**Analysis:** This section presents the energetic basis (*rlung gi gzhi*) for the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) in Thödgal (*thod rgal*) practice. The transition from karmic winds (*las kyi rlung*) to wisdom winds (*ye shes kyi rlung*) establishes the physiological and energetic foundation for visionary experience.

**Architectural Placement:** Following the completion of channel analysis (Chapter 12) and preceding the detailed lamp exposition (Chapter 13), this section bridges subtle body physiology (*rtsa rlung thig le*) and visionary practice (*thod rgal*).

**Key Transition:** The purification of winds (*las rlung dag cing*) marks the shift from ordinary perception to pristine awareness, enabling the far-casting water lamp (*rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma*) to manifest.

## Wind Terminology: *Las rlung* and *Ye shes rlung*

**Analysis:** The passage employs specific wind-energy terminology:

1. **Las kyi rlung** (*las kyi rlung*) — "karma wind":
   - *Las* (karma/action) + *rlung* (wind/breath)
   - Ordinary vital energy conditioned by past actions
   - Moves through side channels (*ro ma*, *rkyang ma*)
   - Associated with conceptual thought (*rnam rtog*)

2. **Ye shes kyi rlung** (*ye shes kyi rlung*) — "wisdom wind":
   - *Ye shes* (primordial wisdom) + *rlung* (wind)
   - Pristine energy of awareness
   - Moves through central channel (*dbu ma*)
   - Associated with non-conceptual recognition

3. **Dag cing** (*dag cing*) — "purified and":
   - *Dag* (pure/clean) + continuative *cing*
   - Indicates transformation process, not static state
   - Active purification through practice

**Particle Analysis:**
- *Las* (ablative): "from karma wind"
- *Kyis* (instrumental): "by wisdom wind"
- *La sog pa* (locative + etcetera): "and so forth"

## Thödgal Physiology: From Channels to Lamps

**Analysis:** This passage integrates two physiological systems:

**1. Channel-Wind System (*rtsa rlung*):**
- Derived from completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practices
- Karmic winds circulate through channels
- Purification leads to wisdom wind manifestation

**2. Four Lamps System (*sgron ma bzhi*):**
- Derived from Thödgal visionary practice
- Four supports for recognition (*ngos 'dzin*)
- Progressive refinement of appearances

**Source Texts:**
- *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl Garland Tantra)
- *Rig pa rang shar* (Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra)
- *sGron ma 'bar ba* (Lamp Blazing Tantra/Pradīpoddyotana)

**Doxographical Integration:**
The Nyingma system synthesizes these into a unified path:
- Channels/winds prepare the energetic basis
- Four lamps provide the visionary support
- Together they enable direct recognition (*ngos 'dzin*)

[16025-16033] <concept>
## Wind Purification as Foundation

**Analysis:** The transformation from karmic to wisdom wind involves:

**Karmic Wind Characteristics:**
- Conditioned by past actions (*las*)
- Associated with conceptual mind (*rtog pa*)
- Flows in side channels creating duality
- Produces ordinary perception

**Wisdom Wind Characteristics:**
- Unconditioned primordial awareness
- Associated with direct recognition (*rig pa*)
- Flows in central channel
- Produces visionary appearances (*snang ba*)

**Transformation Process:**
The purification (*dag pa*) is not elimination but recognition:
- Same wind-energy, different recognition
- Karmic wind = wisdom wind unrecognized
- Wisdom wind = karmic wind recognized
- This is the *gnas 'gyur* (location-transformation) principle

**Four Lamps Foundation:**
Once wisdom wind is active, it can support the four lamps:
1. Far-casting water lamp — distance vision
2. Empty bindus lamp — essence recognition
3. Pure sphere lamp — nature recognition
4. Self-arising wisdom lamp — compassion recognition

## The Water Lamp: Essence and Definition

**Analysis:** Lines 16034-16041 present the first of the Four Lamps — the Water Lamp of Far-Casting (*rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma*). The passage establishes:

1. **Essence** (*ngo bo*, line 16034): Pure light essence of wisdom
2. **Function** (*byed las*, lines 16035-16036): Holding both saṃsāric and nirvāṇic appearances
3. **Significance** (line 16041): Critical point for practice

**Dual Appearance System:**
- *'Khrul snang* (confused appearance) — saṃsāra
- *'Das pa'i cha* (transcendent aspect) — nirvāṇa
- Both held simultaneously (*'dzin*) by the water lamp

---

[16034-16041] <philology>
## Water Lamp Terminology

**Analysis:** Key terms in the water lamp definition:

1. **Rgyang zhags** (*rgyang zhags*) — "far-casting":
   - *Rgyang* (distant/far) + *zhags* (casting/net)
   - Indicates expansive, distance-spanning vision
   - Technical term for visionary capacity extending in space

2. **Chu'i sgron ma** (*chu'i sgron ma*) — "Water Lamp":
   - *Chu* (water) + *sgron ma* (lamp)
   - Why "water"? Fluid, reflective, holding quality
   - Holds appearances like water holds reflections

3. **'Od rtsa dag pa** (*'od rtsa dag pa*) — "pure light essence":
   - *'Od* (light) + *rtsa* (root/essence) + *dag pa* (pure)
   - The pure luminous nature underlying all appearance

4. **'Khrul snang** (*'khrul snang*) — "confused appearance":
   - *'Khrul* (confusion) + *snang* (appearance)
   - Ordinary saṃsāric perception
   - Contrast with *ye shes kyi snang ba* (wisdom appearance)

**Particle Constructions:**
- *La* (locative): Indicates domain of operation
- *Kyis* (instrumental): Means of holding appearances
- *Gis* (ergative): Agent of perception

## The Four Lamps in Nyingma Tantra

**Analysis:** The Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) derive from:

**Primary Sources:**
1. *sGron ma 'bar ba* (Pradīpoddyotana) — Lamp Blazing Tantra
2. *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl Garland Tantra)
3. *Rig pa rang shar* (Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra)

**Classification:**
- Category: *Thod rgal* (Direct Crossing) practice
- Sub-category: *sNying thig* (Heart Essence) tradition
- Function: Supports for recognition (*ngos 'dzin gyi rten*)

**Comparison with Other Systems:**
- **Kālacakra:** Six Yogas (heat, illusory body, etc.)
- **Guhyasamāja:** Five Stages (isolation, luminosity, etc.)
- **Nyingma Thödgal:** Four Lamps (water, bindu, sphere, wisdom)

**Dzogchen Distinction:**
Unlike gradual systems where practices produce results:
- Four Lamps are already present (*ye nas yod*)
- Practice reveals rather than creates
- Recognition (*ngos 'dzin*) vs. achievement (*bsgrub pa*)

[16034-16041] <concept>
## Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa: The Dual Holding

**Analysis:** The water lamp's unique function is simultaneously holding both:

**Saṃsāric Aspect (*'khrul snang*):**
- Ordinary confused perception
- Subject-object duality
- Conditioned by karma and afflictions
- Appears as "external world"

**Nirvāṇic Aspect (*'das pa'i cha*):**
- Transcendent wisdom appearance
- Non-dual recognition
- Primordially pure
- Appears as "self-display" (*rang snang*)

**Non-Dual Integration:**
The water lamp does not reject saṃsāra for nirvāṇa:
- Both are appearances (*snang ba*)
- Both arise from the ground (*gzhi*)
- Both are self-display (*rang snang*)
- The difference is recognition (*rtogs pa*), not ontology

**Critical Point:**
Line 16041: *gnad 'di gal po che'o* — "This point is extremely critical"

Failure to recognize this dual-holding:
- Rejecting saṃsāra = nihilism (*chad lta*)
- Grasping nirvāṇa = eternalism (*rtag lta*)
- Only simultaneous recognition is Dzogchen view

## The Remaining Three Lamps

**Analysis:** Lines 16042-16059 present the three wisdom lamps derived from the water lamp foundation:

**1. Empty Bindus Lamp (16043-16059):**
- Essence: Round bindus with five-colored light-rim
- Source: Purified karma wind
- Function: Essence recognition

**2. Self-Arising Wisdom Lamp (16045-16058):**
- Derived from empty bindus
- Three aspects: essence (*ngo bo*), potency (*rtsal*), resonance (*gdangs*)
- Function: Discriminating awareness (*shes rab*)

**3. Pure Sphere Lamp (16059-16077):**
- Two types: external and internal spheres
- External: Pure sky vision
- Internal: Expansive awareness
- Function: Nature recognition

**Integration:**
These three represent progressive refinement from the water lamp base.

## Lamp Terminology Detailed

**Analysis:** Technical terms for the three wisdom lamps:

**Empty Bindus Lamp:**
- *Thig le stong pa* — "empty bindu"
  - *Thig le*: Drop, dot, essence
  - *Stong pa*: Empty, devoid of inherent existence
  - Five-colored light (*'od lnga*) indicates five wisdoms
  - Round (*zlum po*) indicates completeness

**Self-Arising Wisdom Lamp:**
- *Shes rab rang byung* — "self-arising wisdom"
  - *Shes rab*: Discriminating awareness (Skt. prajñā)
  - *Rang byung*: Self-arisen, not created
  - Three aspects:
    - *Ngo bo*: Essence (unborn nature)
    - *Rtsal*: Potency (expressive capacity)
    - *Gdangs*: Resonance (vibrational quality)

**Pure Sphere Lamp:**
- *Dbyings rnam dag* — "completely pure sphere"
  - *Dbyings*: Dhātu, sphere, expanse
  - *Rnam dag*: Completely pure
  - Two modalities:
    - *Phyi dbyings*: External sphere (sky)
    - *Nang dbyings*: Internal sphere (awareness)

**Key Distinction:**
- Water lamp = base/ground (*gzhi*)
- Three wisdom lamps = display (*rol pa*)
- This mirrors *ka dag* (primordial purity) and *lhun grub* (spontaneous presence)

## Scriptural Sources and Lineage

**Analysis:** The Four Lamps presentation derives from:

**Seventeen Tantras (*rGyud bcu bdun*):**
Specifically from the *Man ngag sde* (Upadeśa class):
- *sGron ma 'bar ba* (Lamp Blazing)
- *Rig pa rang shar* (Self-Arisen Awareness)
- *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl Garland)

**Longchenpa's Integration:**
In the *Theg mchog mdzod*, Longchenpa synthesizes:
- *sNying thig* (Heart Essence) visionary practice
- *mDzod* (Treasury) systematic exposition
- *Khrid* (Instruction) practical application

**Lineage Transmission:**
- Samantabhadra → Vajrasattva → Garab Dorje
- Through *snyan brgyud* (aural lineage)
- To Longchenpa in 14th century

**Relation to Other Chapters:**
- Chapter 12: Channels/winds (energetic foundation)
- Chapter 13: Four lamps (visionary support) — THIS CHAPTER
- Chapter 14: Recognition (fruition)

---

[16042-16059] <concept>
## Progressive Recognition: From Water to Wisdom

**Analysis:** The Four Lamps represent progressive stages of recognition:

**Stage 1: Water Lamp (Base)**
- Holds all appearances (saṃsāra + nirvāṇa)
- Like water holding reflections
- Non-discriminating, expansive
- Foundation for further recognition

**Stage 2: Empty Bindus (Essence)**
- Recognition of appearances as empty
- Bindus = empty yet luminous
- Like reflections lacking substance
- Understanding essence (*ngo bo*) as emptiness

**Stage 3: Pure Sphere (Nature)**
- Recognition of awareness as expansive
- Sphere = all-pervading like space
- Internal and external indistinguishable
- Understanding nature (*rang bzhin*) as clarity

**Stage 4: Self-Arising Wisdom (Compassion)**
- Recognition of spontaneous display
- Wisdom arises without creation
- Discriminating yet non-conceptual
- Understanding compassion (*thugs rje*) as unobstructed

**Integration:**
These are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects:
- One recognition, four dimensions
- Like one jewel with four faces
- All present from the beginning (*ye nas yod*)
