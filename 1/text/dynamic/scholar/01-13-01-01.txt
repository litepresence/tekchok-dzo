# Karmic Winds Purified as Wisdom Winds: Foundation of the Four Lamps

**Analysis:** This section presents the energetic basis (*rlung gi gzhi*) for the Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) in Thödgal (*thod rgal*) practice. The transition from karmic winds (*las kyi rlung*) to wisdom winds (*ye shes kyi rlung*) establishes the physiological and energetic foundation for visionary experience.

**Architectural Placement:** Following the completion of channel analysis (Chapter 12) and preceding the detailed lamp exposition (Chapter 13), this section bridges subtle body physiology (*rtsa rlung thig le*) and visionary practice (*thod rgal*).

**Key Transition:** The purification of winds (*las rlung dag cing*) marks the shift from ordinary perception to pristine awareness, enabling the far-casting water lamp (*rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma*) to manifest.

## Wind Terminology: *Las rlung* and *Ye shes rlung*

**Analysis:** The passage employs specific wind-energy terminology:

1. **Las kyi rlung** (*las kyi rlung*) — "karma wind":
   - *Las* (karma/action) + *rlung* (wind/breath)
   - Ordinary vital energy conditioned by past actions
   - Moves through side channels (*ro ma*, *rkyang ma*)
   - Associated with conceptual thought (*rnam rtog*)

2. **Ye shes kyi rlung** (*ye shes kyi rlung*) — "wisdom wind":
   - *Ye shes* (primordial wisdom) + *rlung* (wind)
   - Pristine energy of awareness
   - Moves through central channel (*dbu ma*)
   - Associated with non-conceptual recognition

3. **Dag cing** (*dag cing*) — "purified and":
   - *Dag* (pure/clean) + continuative *cing*
   - Indicates transformation process, not static state
   - Active purification through practice

**Particle Analysis:**
- *Las* (ablative): "from karma wind"
- *Kyis* (instrumental): "by wisdom wind"
- *La sog pa* (locative + etcetera): "and so forth"

[16025-16033] <context>
## Thödgal Physiology: From Channels to Lamps

**Analysis:** This passage integrates two physiological systems:

**1. Channel-Wind System (*rtsa rlung*):**
- Derived from completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practices
- Karmic winds circulate through channels
- Purification leads to wisdom wind manifestation

**2. Four Lamps System (*sgron ma bzhi*):**
- Derived from Thödgal visionary practice
- Four supports for recognition (*ngos 'dzin*)
- Progressive refinement of appearances

**Source Texts:**
- *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl Garland Tantra)
- *Rig pa rang shar* (Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra)
- *sGron ma 'bar ba* (Lamp Blazing Tantra/Pradīpoddyotana)

**Doxographical Integration:**
The Nyingma system synthesizes these into a unified path:
- Channels/winds prepare the energetic basis
- Four lamps provide the visionary support
- Together they enable direct recognition (*ngos 'dzin*)

---

[16025-16033] <concept>
## Wind Purification as Foundation

**Analysis:** The transformation from karmic to wisdom wind involves:

**Karmic Wind Characteristics:**
- Conditioned by past actions (*las*)
- Associated with conceptual mind (*rtog pa*)
- Flows in side channels creating duality
- Produces ordinary perception

**Wisdom Wind Characteristics:**
- Unconditioned primordial awareness
- Associated with direct recognition (*rig pa*)
- Flows in central channel
- Produces visionary appearances (*snang ba*)

**Transformation Process:**
The purification (*dag pa*) is not elimination but recognition:
- Same wind-energy, different recognition
- Karmic wind = wisdom wind unrecognized
- Wisdom wind = karmic wind recognized
- This is the *gnas 'gyur* (location-transformation) principle

**Four Lamps Foundation:**
Once wisdom wind is active, it can support the four lamps:
1. Far-casting water lamp — distance vision
2. Empty bindus lamp — essence recognition
3. Pure sphere lamp — nature recognition
4. Self-arising wisdom lamp — compassion recognition

---

[16034-16041] <structure>
## The Water Lamp: Essence and Definition

**Analysis:** Lines 16034-16041 present the first of the Four Lamps — the Water Lamp of Far-Casting (*rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma*). The passage establishes:

1. **Essence** (*ngo bo*, line 16034): Pure light essence of wisdom
2. **Function** (*byed las*, lines 16035-16036): Holding both saṃsāric and nirvāṇic appearances
3. **Significance** (line 16041): Critical point for practice

**Dual Appearance System:**
- *'Khrul snang* (confused appearance) — saṃsāra
- *'Das pa'i cha* (transcendent aspect) — nirvāṇa
- Both held simultaneously (*'dzin*) by the water lamp

---

[16034-16041] <philology>
## Water Lamp Terminology

**Analysis:** Key terms in the water lamp definition:

1. **Rgyang zhags** (*rgyang zhags*) — "far-casting":
   - *Rgyang* (distant/far) + *zhags* (casting/net)
   - Indicates expansive, distance-spanning vision
   - Technical term for visionary capacity extending in space

2. **Chu'i sgron ma** (*chu'i sgron ma*) — "Water Lamp":
   - *Chu* (water) + *sgron ma* (lamp)
   - Why "water"? Fluid, reflective, holding quality
   - Holds appearances like water holds reflections

3. **'Od rtsa dag pa** (*'od rtsa dag pa*) — "pure light essence":
   - *'Od* (light) + *rtsa* (root/essence) + *dag pa* (pure)
   - The pure luminous nature underlying all appearance

4. **'Khrul snang** (*'khrul snang*) — "confused appearance":
   - *'Khrul* (confusion) + *snang* (appearance)
   - Ordinary saṃsāric perception
   - Contrast with *ye shes kyi snang ba* (wisdom appearance)

**Particle Constructions:**
- *La* (locative): Indicates domain of operation
- *Kyis* (instrumental): Means of holding appearances
- *Gis* (ergative): Agent of perception

[16034-16041] <context>
## The Four Lamps in Nyingma Tantra

**Analysis:** The Four Lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) derive from:

**Primary Sources:**
1. *sGron ma 'bar ba* (Pradīpoddyotana) — Lamp Blazing Tantra
2. *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl Garland Tantra)
3. *Rig pa rang shar* (Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra)

**Classification:**
- Category: *Thod rgal* (Direct Crossing) practice
- Sub-category: *sNying thig* (Heart Essence) tradition
- Function: Supports for recognition (*ngos 'dzin gyi rten*)

**Comparison with Other Systems:**
- **Kālacakra:** Six Yogas (heat, illusory body, etc.)
- **Guhyasamāja:** Five Stages (isolation, luminosity, etc.)
- **Nyingma Thödgal:** Four Lamps (water, bindu, sphere, wisdom)

**Dzogchen Distinction:**
Unlike gradual systems where practices produce results:
- Four Lamps are already present (*ye nas yod*)
- Practice reveals rather than creates
- Recognition (*ngos 'dzin*) vs. achievement (*bsgrub pa*)

---

[16034-16041] <concept>
## Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa: The Dual Holding

**Analysis:** The water lamp's unique function is simultaneously holding both:

**Saṃsāric Aspect (*'khrul snang*):**
- Ordinary confused perception
- Subject-object duality
- Conditioned by karma and afflictions
- Appears as "external world"

**Nirvāṇic Aspect (*'das pa'i cha*):**
- Transcendent wisdom appearance
- Non-dual recognition
- Primordially pure
- Appears as "self-display" (*rang snang*)

**Non-Dual Integration:**
The water lamp does not reject saṃsāra for nirvāṇa:
- Both are appearances (*snang ba*)
- Both arise from the ground (*gzhi*)
- Both are self-display (*rang snang*)
- The difference is recognition (*rtogs pa*), not ontology

**Critical Point:**
Line 16041: *gnad 'di gal po che'o* — "This point is extremely critical"

Failure to recognize this dual-holding:
- Rejecting saṃsāra = nihilism (*chad lta*)
- Grasping nirvāṇa = eternalism (*rtag lta*)
- Only simultaneous recognition is Dzogchen view

---

[16042-16059] <structure>
## The Remaining Three Lamps

**Analysis:** Lines 16042-16059 present the three wisdom lamps derived from the water lamp foundation:

**1. Empty Bindus Lamp (16043-16059):**
- Essence: Round bindus with five-colored light-rim
- Source: Purified karma wind
- Function: Essence recognition

**2. Self-Arising Wisdom Lamp (16045-16058):**
- Derived from empty bindus
- Three aspects: essence (*ngo bo*), potency (*rtsal*), resonance (*gdangs*)
- Function: Discriminating awareness (*shes rab*)

**3. Pure Sphere Lamp (16059-16077):**
- Two types: external and internal spheres
- External: Pure sky vision
- Internal: Expansive awareness
- Function: Nature recognition

**Integration:**
These three represent progressive refinement from the water lamp base.

[16042-16059] <philology>
## Lamp Terminology Detailed

**Analysis:** Technical terms for the three wisdom lamps:

**Empty Bindus Lamp:**
- *Thig le stong pa* — "empty bindu"
  - *Thig le*: Drop, dot, essence
  - *Stong pa*: Empty, devoid of inherent existence
  - Five-colored light (*'od lnga*) indicates five wisdoms
  - Round (*zlum po*) indicates completeness

**Self-Arising Wisdom Lamp:**
- *Shes rab rang byung* — "self-arising wisdom"
  - *Shes rab*: Discriminating awareness (Skt. prajñā)
  - *Rang byung*: Self-arisen, not created
  - Three aspects:
    - *Ngo bo*: Essence (unborn nature)
    - *Rtsal*: Potency (expressive capacity)
    - *Gdangs*: Resonance (vibrational quality)

**Pure Sphere Lamp:**
- *Dbyings rnam dag* — "completely pure sphere"
  - *Dbyings*: Dhātu, sphere, expanse
  - *Rnam dag*: Completely pure
  - Two modalities:
    - *Phyi dbyings*: External sphere (sky)
    - *Nang dbyings*: Internal sphere (awareness)

**Key Distinction:**
- Water lamp = base/ground (*gzhi*)
- Three wisdom lamps = display (*rol pa*)
- This mirrors *ka dag* (primordial purity) and *lhun grub* (spontaneous presence)

---

[16042-16059] <context>
## Scriptural Sources and Lineage

**Analysis:** The Four Lamps presentation derives from:

**Seventeen Tantras (*rGyud bcu bdun*):**
Specifically from the *Man ngag sde* (Upadeśa class):
- *sGron ma 'bar ba* (Lamp Blazing)
- *Rig pa rang shar* (Self-Arisen Awareness)
- *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl Garland)

**Longchenpa's Integration:**
In the *Theg mchog mdzod*, Longchenpa synthesizes:
- *sNying thig* (Heart Essence) visionary practice
- *mDzod* (Treasury) systematic exposition
- *Khrid* (Instruction) practical application

**Lineage Transmission:**
- Samantabhadra → Vajrasattva → Garab Dorje
- Through *snyan brgyud* (aural lineage)
- To Longchenpa in 14th century

**Relation to Other Chapters:**
- Chapter 12: Channels/winds (energetic foundation)
- Chapter 13: Four lamps (visionary support) — THIS CHAPTER
- Chapter 14: Recognition (fruition)

---

[16042-16059] <concept>
## Progressive Recognition: From Water to Wisdom

**Analysis:** The Four Lamps represent progressive stages of recognition:

**Stage 1: Water Lamp (Base)**
- Holds all appearances (saṃsāra + nirvāṇa)
- Like water holding reflections
- Non-discriminating, expansive
- Foundation for further recognition

**Stage 2: Empty Bindus (Essence)**
- Recognition of appearances as empty
- Bindus = empty yet luminous
- Like reflections lacking substance
- Understanding essence (*ngo bo*) as emptiness

**Stage 3: Pure Sphere (Nature)**
- Recognition of awareness as expansive
- Sphere = all-pervading like space
- Internal and external indistinguishable
- Understanding nature (*rang bzhin*) as clarity

**Stage 4: Self-Arising Wisdom (Compassion)**
- Recognition of spontaneous display
- Wisdom arises without creation
- Discriminating yet non-conceptual
- Understanding compassion (*thugs rje*) as unobstructed

**Integration:**
These are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects:
- One recognition, four dimensions
- Like one jewel with four faces
- All present from the beginning (*ye nas yod*)

The Four Lamps: Detailed Analysis of Empty Bindu and Self-Arisen Wisdom
**Architectural Analysis:** This passage presents detailed analysis of the Four Lamps, structured as:

1. **Far-Reaching Water Lamp Foundation** (lines 16033-16037): The relationship between pure channels and dependent deluded appearances.

2. **Four Lamps Enumeration** (lines 16038-16042): Introduction to the four lamps as distinct from samsaric delusion.

3. **Empty Bindu Lamp** (*Thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*, lines 16043-16050): The five-colored circular bindu arising from purified karma wind, generating Self-Arisen Wisdom and Pure Expanse lamps.

4. **Self-Arisen Wisdom Lamp** (*Shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*, lines 16050-16058): Three aspects—essence (*ngo bo*), potency (*rtsal*), and resonance (*gdangs*).

5. **Pure Expanse Lamp** (*Dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma*, lines 16059-16075): External and internal aspects, clarifying the distinction between mere sky and actual expanse.

6. **Etymological Analysis** (lines 16081-16104): Detailed word-by-word analysis of "Thig le stong pa'i sgron ma" showing conventional and ultimate meanings.

**Enumeration Framework:**
The text uses progressive enumeration:
- Four lamps total
- Three aspects of Self-Arisen Wisdom lamp
- Two aspects of Pure Expanse lamp (external/internal)
- Threefold etymology for "Empty Bindu"

[16034-16104] <philology>
**Technical Terminology:**

*Rgyang zhags* (རྒྱང་ཞགས་) - Far-reaching/far-cast: from *rgyang* (far/distance) + *zhags* (cast/throw). The water lamp that "casts" or "reaches" far into space.

*Thig le stong pa* (ཐིག་ལེ་སྟོང་པ་) - Empty bindu: the dimensionless point/essence empty of inherent existence.

*Mu khyud* (མུ་ཁྱུད་) - Perimeter/rim: the colored ring around the bindu.

*Shes rab rang byung* (ཤེས་རབ་རང་བྱུང་) - Self-arisen wisdom/prajñā: wisdom that arises spontaneously without causes.

*Dbyings rnam dag* (དབྱིངས་རྣམ་དག་) - Pure expanse: the thoroughly pure dharmadhātu.

*Ngo bo* (ངོ་བོ་) - Essence/nature: the intrinsic nature of the lamp.

*Rtsal* (རྩལ་) - Potency/capacity: the active expressive power.

*Gdangs* (གདངས་) - Resonance/tone: the radiating quality.

*Dangs sangs* (དངས་སངས་) - Clear and luminous: the quality of the internal awareness.

*Rang gsal* (རང་གསལ་) - Self-clear: naturally luminous without obstruction.

*Mthing ga* (མཐིང་ག་) - Deep blue/azure: the color of the inner expanse.

*'Ja' 'od* (འཇའ་འོད་) - Rainbow light: the transfer between expanse and appearance.

**Etymological Analysis of "Sgron Ma":**

The term *sgron ma* (སྒྲོན་མ་) — "lamp" — carries multiple connotations:

1. **Illumination** (*gsal byed*): making visible what was dark
2. **Support** (*rten*): foundation for recognition
3. **Purification** (*dag byed*): clearing obscurations

**The Four Lamps' Functions:**

1. **Far-reaching water**: Clears far distances
2. **Empty bindu**: Clears fixation on bindus
3. **Self-arisen wisdom**: Clears conceptual thought
4. **Pure expanse**: Clears all samsaric darkness

[16034-16104] <context>
**Nyingma Thödgal Tradition:**

The Four Lamps are central to the *Man ngag sde* (Instruction Class) teachings, particularly:

**Lineage Sources:**
- *sGron ma 'bar ba* (Pradīpoddyotana): Root tantra on lamps
- *Nges pa snying thig*: Longchenpa's definitive instructions
- *Klong chen snying thig*: Jigme Lingpa's revelation

**Practice Context:**
The lamps manifest sequentially in Thödgal practice:
1. First, the far-reaching water lamp appears
2. Then empty bindu lamp manifests
3. From bindu, wisdom lamp arises
4. Finally, expanse lamp dawns

**Comparative Framework:**

**Abhidharma:** No lamp system; only four elements
**Tantra:** Lamp metaphors for wisdom (e.g., *Pradīpoddyotana*)
**Mahāmudrā**: Light metaphors but different system
**Dzogchen:** Unique four-lamp system specific to Thödgal

**Physiological Basis:**

The lamps correspond to subtle body locations:

1. **Water lamp**: Eyes (*mig sgron*) — far-reaching vision
2. **Bindu lamp**: Heart (*snying ga*) — essence concentration
3. **Wisdom lamp**: Crown (*spyi gtsug*) — clarity and discrimination
4. **Expanse lamp**: Whole body/space — all-pervasive openness

**Gender Considerations:**
While the text uses male-oriented examples, the four lamps manifest universally:
- Same visionary appearances
- Same recognition principles
- Same physiological basis
- Adaptable to all practitioners

[16034-16104] <concept>
**The Four Lamps Decoded**

**1. Far-Reaching Water Lamp (*Rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma*):**

**Function:** Enables clear perception at distance

**Physiological Basis:**
- Purified water element (*chu*) in eyes
- Clear fluid of vision
- Connection between eye and brain channels

**Practice Application:**
- Gazing into space without fixation
- Eyes relaxed but alert (*dal ba*)
- Seeing appearances as they are

**Mistake to Avoid:**
- Confusing external sky with internal expanse
- Thinking lamp is physical eye
- Not recognizing appearances as awareness

**2. Empty Bindu Lamp (*Thig le stong pa'i sgron ma*):**

**Appearance:**
- Round (*zlum po*) five-colored bindu
- Five-colored perimeter (*mu khyud*)
- Arising from purified karma wind

**Three Conventional Meanings (etymology):**

a. **Thig** (འཐིག་): Posture that drops essence
   - Body posture (*'dug stangs*) settles awareness
   
b. **Le** (ལེ་): Secret holding through HUM
   - Mantra seals the bindu
   - Recognition of wisdom
   
c. **Stong pa** (སྟོང་པ་): Reversing bindu
   - Bindu reversed into space
   - Wind and bindu blending
   - Emptiness-bliss of mind

**Three Ultimate Meanings:**

a. **Thig**: Unchanging gaze (*gzig stangs*)
   - Awareness's nature unchanging
   - Three unchangeables: face, essence, nature
   
b. **Le**: Circular light perimeter (*mu khyud*)
   - Appearance of light around bindu
   - Not solid, luminous display
   
c. **Stong pa**: Unestablished in things/signs
   - No harm from four elements
   - Self-appearance, others don't see
   - Free from elaboration, clears ignorance

**Source of Other Lamps:**
From empty bindu arise:
- Self-Arisen Wisdom lamp (discrimination)
- Pure Expanse lamp (all-pervasiveness)

**3. Self-Arisen Wisdom Lamp (*Shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma*):**

**Three Aspects:**

**a. Essence (*Ngo bo*):**
- Clear self-luminosity of internal rigpa
- Experienced when gazing at empty bindu
- Not constructed, naturally present

**b. Potency (*Rtsal*):**
- External clarity of objects
- Sharp, quick discriminating wisdom (*shes rab*)
- Words and meanings appear like space-treasury

**c. Resonance (*Gdangs*):**
- Golden chain-like appearance
- Vajra chain (*rdo rje lu gu rgyud*)
- Continuous luminous thread

**Mistake to Avoid:**
- Calling discriminating awareness "wisdom lamp"
- Calling internal resonance "wisdom lamp"
- Calling vajra chain "wisdom lamp"
- All three are aspects, not the lamp itself

**4. Pure Expanse Lamp (*Dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma*):**

**Two Aspects:**

**a. External Expanse (*Phyi dbyings*):**
- Cloudless sky appearance
- Merely external appearance
- Not the actual expanse

**b. Internal Expanse (*Nang dbyings*):**
- Deep blue (*mthing ga*) resonance
- Arising from internal expanse
- The actual expanse lamp

**Critical Distinction:**

Space (*nam mkha'*) ≠ Expanse (*dbyings*)

- **Space**: Physical, no connection to practitioner
- **Expanse**: Awareness's nature, manifests light

**Correct Understanding:**
The deep blue appearing externally is called "external expanse" because it shines from internal expanse. The expanse itself is deep blue—internal expanse within internal expanse.

**Rainbow Light Transfer:**
The "rainbow light's household transfer" (*'ja' 'od kyi khur khyim du go 'phos pa*) means:
- Internal expanse manifests externally
- Like rainbow light transferring location
- Not internal going to external
- Rather: internal shining forth

**The Five Lights:**

From expanse lamp shine five lights:
- Self-nature is clear light (*rang bzhin gyis 'od gsal*)
- Self-resonance arises (*rang gdangs shar ba*)
- Purified of:
  - Thing-obscuration (*dngos po'i dri ma*)
  - Conceptual wisdom obscuration (*yid dpyod shes rab kyi dri ma*)
  - Bad conception mind obscuration (*ngan rtog sems kyi dri ma*)

**Synthesis: How the Lamps Work Together**

**Sequential Manifestation:**
1. **Water lamp** clears visual field
2. **Bindu lamp** concentrates essence
3. **Wisdom lamp** discriminates clearly
4. **Expanse lamp** pervades all

**Simultaneous Function:**
All four operate together:
- Water = Support for vision
- Bindu = Concentrated essence
- Wisdom = Discriminating clarity
- Expanse = All-pervasive nature

**Soteriological Result:**

Through the four lamps:
- Samsara's darkness cleared (*'khor ba'i mun pa sel*)
- Recognition stabilized (*ngos 'dzin brtan pa*)
- Visions self-liberate (*snang ba rang grol*)
- Rainbow body attained (*'ja' lus*)

**The Key Point:**

As the text emphasizes (line 16041): *Gnad 'di gal po che'o* — "This key point is extremely important."

The four lamps are not external objects but the self-display of awareness. Recognizing this transforms:
- Vision into wisdom
- Appearance into path
- Delusion into liberation
- Samsara into nirvana

This is the *zang thal* (direct) approach of Thödgal—direct recognition without gradual cultivation.
