<sectarian-error> [THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY AS SUPERIORITY]
**Misreading:**
The comparison of outer (Hinayana), inner (Mahayana), and lower (Kriya/Carya) practitioners is interpreted as establishing superiority hierarchy, with inner tantra practitioners as "highest."

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking. "Surpasses," "cannot," "ability" language suggests ranking. Dzogchen tradition often presents itself as "highest."

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual elitism. The practitioner believes they are "inner" practitioner superior to "outer" or "lower" paths.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dismissal of foundational vehicles; premature tantra practice without foundation; pride in transgressive practices (five meats/nectars).

**Cascade effects:**
<elitism-error> through hierarchical self-identification.
<practice-path-confusion> through skipping prerequisites.

<methodological-error> [LIBERATION IN ONE LIFE AS GOAL]
**Misreading:**
The description of "liberation attained in one life" is interpreted as teleological promise or result to achieve through practice, creating goal-oriented approach to tantra.

**Why it arises:**
Result-fixation. "Attained" suggests acquisition. "One life" seems faster than gradual paths, appealing to impatience.

**Primary consequence:**
Making one-life liberation objective. The practitioner believes they must achieve this goal through tantric practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Performance anxiety; deferring recognition to imagined future attainment; spiritual materialism of "achieving" in one life.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through goal-orientation.
<meditationism-error> through practice-to-obtain.

<triumphalist-error> [MAHA-ANU-ATI AS PROGRESSION]
**Misreading:**
The three subdivisions (Maha yoga, Anu yoga, Ati yoga) are interpreted as progressive stages, with Ati yoga/Dzogchen as "highest" or "final" vehicle to which one should graduate.

**Why it arises:**
Developmental thinking. "Three" suggests sequence. Modern presentations often present Dzogchen as "pinnacle."

**Primary consequence:**
Vehicle-hopping. The practitioner believes they should progress through Maha → Anu → Ati, or skip directly to Ati as "best."

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that each has distinct function; premature Dzogchen practice; "Ati superiority" complex.

**Cascade effects:**
<vehicle-hierarchy-elitism> through ranking vehicles.
<practice-path-confusion> through inappropriate vehicle selection.

<generation-stage-fixation> [THREE SAMADHIS AS MECHANISM]
**Misreading:**
The description of Maha yoga meditation through "three doors of concentration" and generation stage is interpreted as establishing causal mechanism—performing these samadhis produces realization.

**Why it arises:**
Cause-effect thinking. Technical description invites mechanistic interpretation. "Generation stage" sounds like procedure to execute.

**Primary consequence:**
Making samadhis production-method. The practitioner believes performing three samadhis causes "clear empty light wisdom" to arise.

**Secondary consequences:**
Samadhi-performance; visualization technique obsession; missing that samadhis are expressions of recognition, not causes.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-fetishism> through causal interpretation.
<meditationism-error> through method-obsession.

**Page bleed awareness:** This introduces three inner tantra structure that continues throughout subsequent sections. Misreading here affects entire tantra presentation.
