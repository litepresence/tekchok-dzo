[892-894]
[COSMOLOGY-LITERALIZATION] [CONTAINER WORLD REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
The systematic cosmological architecture (mountains, continents, oceans with precise measurements) interpreted as literal geography to be mapped like a physical atlas.

**Why it arises:**
The detailed measurements (sum 'gyur, phyed phyed phri ba) suggest empirical observation. The orderly arrangement mirrors geographical mapping conventions.

**Primary consequence:**
*ril gyis shar* (arising from accumulation) congeals into geological process rather than karmic manifestation. The container world (*snod*) is confused with physical space.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners search for Mount Meru on Earth. Cosmology congeals into archaeology. The visionary architecture solidifies as cartography.

[895-897]
[MOUNT-MERU-PHYSICALIZATION] [CENTRAL AXIS REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
*ri rab* (Mount Meru) interpreted as an actual physical mountain at Earth's center—a colossal geological formation made of precious substances.

**Why it arises:**
The detailed descriptions (lcags las grub pa, gnya' shing 'dzin) read like geological reports. The gold and jewel composition suggests literal mineralogy.

**Primary consequence:**
The axis mundi congeals as a destination. Pilgrimage congeals into geographical rather than psychological. The central channel of subtle body is externalized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Expeditions search for Meru's location. Measurements are applied to physical cartography. The symbolic center is confused with geographic center.

[898-900]
[FOUR-CONTINENTS-NATIONALISM] [JAMBUDVIPA IDENTIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
*gling bzhi* (four continents)—especially *'dzam bu'i gling* (Jambudvipa)—interpreted as referring to India or South Asia specifically, with other continents as actual world regions.

**Why it arises:**
Buddhism's Indian origins suggest Jambudvipa = India. The geographical descriptions seem to match ancient worldviews. The triangular shape of Lus 'phags gling resembles India.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual hierarchy congeals into national pride. India warps into the "center of the spiritual world." Other regions are spiritually peripheral by geography.

**Secondary consequences:**
Cultural chauvinism masquerades as cosmology. Missionary work congeals into continental conquest. Local traditions are delegitimized by "wrong continent" status.

**Cascade effects:**
<directional-superstition> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[901-903]
[DIRECTIONAL-SUPERSTITION] [CARDINAL POINTS SPIRITUALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
The four directions (shar, nub, byang, lho) interpreted as having inherent spiritual significance—East as "spiritual," West as "material," etc.

**Why it arises:**
The detailed descriptions of each continent include moral and karmic characteristics. Shar (East) hosts enlightened beings. This suggests directional power.

**Primary consequence:**
Architecture requires facing specific directions. Travel congeals into spiritually dangerous in wrong directions. Feng shui replaces insight.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ritual orientation congeals into obsessive. Buildings face East regardless of function. Geographical "auspiciousness" determines residence.

**Cascade effects:**
<geomancy-obsession> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<astrological-directions> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[904-906]
[CONTINENT-SHAPE-DETERMINISM] [MORPHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION]
**Misreading:**
The distinctive shapes (triangle, circle, square, semicircle) interpreted as determining the character of inhabitants rather than being symbolic topologies.

**Why it arises:**
Lus 'phags gling is triangular like a human torso. Ba glang spyod is circular. The shapes seem to encode psychological traits.

**Primary consequence:**
Shape congeals into destiny. Triangular people have specific characteristics. Geography determines psychology rather than the reverse.

**Secondary consequences:**
Stereotyping by "continental type." Body types determine spiritual capacity. Morphology replaces merit as destiny-determinant.

**Cascade effects:**
<body-type-spiritual-hierarchy> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<morphological-racism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<geographic-determinism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[907-909]
[SATELLITE-CONTINENT-OBSESSION] [SECONDARY GEOGRAPHY FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
The smaller "satellite" continents (rnga yab, g.yo ldan, lam mchog 'gro) interpreted as literal places to visit or be reborn in, with their own spiritual tourism industries.

**Why it arises:**
Their existence suggests more destination options. The descriptions are tantalizingly brief. "Half of half" dimensions suggest accessibility.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual attention fragments. Practitioners aspire to "better" satellite realms. The main continents seem insufficient.

**Secondary consequences:**
Literature proliferates about minor realms. Practitioners seek teachers from specific continents. Rebirth strategies multiply.

**Cascade effects:**
<cosmic-tourism-expansion> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<rebirth-destination-shopping> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<spiritual-colonialism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[910-912]
[NORTHERN-CONTINENT-UTOPIANISM] [SGRA MI SNYAN IDEALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
*Sgra mi snyan* (northern continent) interpreted as an actual utopia where suffering is minimal and spiritual practice effortless—a place to aspire to.

**Why it arises:**
Descriptions of effortless virtue and spontaneous pleasure. The square shape suggests stability. No mention of major suffering.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners aspire to northern rebirth. Earthly utopian communities claim to replicate it. The challenges of practice seem optional.

**Secondary consequences:**
Disappointment with current location. Spiritual bypassing through "northern consciousness." Practice aversion justified by geography.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-escapism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<utopian-community-fantasies> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<practice-avoidance> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[913-915]
[SAMSAra-LOCATION-REIFICATION] [REALM PLACE CONFUSION]
**Misreading:**
The six realms (*lha*, *mi*, *lha min*, *dmyal ba*, *yi dvags*, *byol song*) interpreted as actual locations in space rather than psychological conditions or perceptual modalities.

**Why it arises:**
They're described with geographical coordinates. Hell is "below," heaven "above." The spatial arrangement suggests physical places.

**Primary consequence:**
Rebirth is understood as travel. Meditation congeals into teleportation. Psychological transformation solidifies as location change.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Visiting" realms through visualization congeals into literal travel aspiration. Astral projection industries emerge. Realm hierarchy is spatialized.

**Cascade effects:**
<realm-tourism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<astral-projection-obsession> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<rebirth-destination-shopping> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[916-918]
[HELL-REALM-LITERALIZATION] [DAMYAL BA PHYSICALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
*Dmyal ba* (hell realms) interpreted as actual subterranean locations with fire and ice, navigable like caverns, rather than psychological states of intense suffering.

**Why it arises:**
Specific depth measurements (dpag tshad nyi khri nyi khri). Located under Gang Ti-se. Eight hot and eight cold hells catalogued like caves.

**Primary consequence:**
Fear of literal descent. Moral behavior congeals into avoiding "falling down." The psychological intensity of rage/anguish is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Hell congeals into geological hazard. Moral panic about "sinking." Spiritual practice is defensive rather than transformative.

**Cascade effects:**
<moral-panic> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<defensive-spirituality> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<hell-anxiety> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[919-921]
[HUNGRY-GHOST-SPATIALIZATION] [YI DVAGS LOCATION FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
*Yi dvags* (hungry ghosts/pretas) interpreted as literally living underground or invisibly among humans, rather than representing psychological states of insatiable craving.

**Why it arises:**
Root location specified (rgyal po'i khab 'og). Some described as living among gods and humans. Specific spatial coordinates.

**Primary consequence:**
Craving congeals into location problem. "Just don't go there." The ubiquitous nature of attachment is ignored.

**Secondary consequences:**
Superstitions about "preta territories." Fear of the invisible. Desire is externalized rather than examined.

**Cascade effects:**
<invisible-world-paranoia> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<craving-externalization> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<ghost-territory-anxiety> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[922-924]
[ANIMAL-REALM-NATURALIZATION] [DUD 'GRO REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
*Dud 'gro* (animal realm) interpreted as referring only to non-human animals in forests and oceans, rather than the psychological condition of instinct-driven existence.

**Why it arises:**
Specific mention of ocean locations. Animals catalogued like zoology. The scattering (*kha 'thor*) seems like migration.

**Primary consequence:**
Human exceptionalism. "At least I'm not an animal" comfort. The animalistic aspects of human mind are denied.

**Secondary consequences:**
Speciesism justified by cosmology. Animals as "lower realm" beings. Human cruelty rationalized by "just animals."

**Cascade effects:**
<speciesism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<human-superiority-complex> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<nature-domination> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[925-927]
[ASURA-REALM-MILITARIZATION] [LHA MIN AGGRESSION MYTH]
**Misreading:**
*Lha min* (asuras/titans) interpreted as a warrior race literally living inside Mount Meru, with whom one can identify or whose battles are literal cosmic conflicts.

**Why it arises:**
Specific location given (ri rab kyi chu mtshams). Descriptions of envy and warfare. The "subterranean palace" sounds habitable.

**Primary consequence:**
Jealousy is spatialized. Envy congeals into "asura nature." Spiritual warriors identify with asura aggression. War is cosmologically legitimized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Militaristic spirituality. "Divine jealousy" as virtue. Conflict with "gods" is normalized. Aggression is romanticized.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-militarism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<holy-war-ideology> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<envious-aspiration> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[928-930]
[CELESTIAL-REALM-ESCAPISM] [LHA YUL HEAVEN ORIENTATION]
**Misreading:**
*Lha yul* (god realms/celestial realms) interpreted as literal paradises to aspire to for rebirth—a desirable destination of eternal pleasure and beauty.

**Why it arises:**
Descriptions of palaces (*pho brang*), pleasure gardens (*skyed mos tshal*), wish-fulfilling trees (*dpag bsam gyi shing*). The beauty is seductive.

**Primary consequence:**
Heaven congeals into spiritual goal. Practice is for "earning" rebirth there. The trap of divine pleasure is ignored.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual materialism. Merit accumulation for tickets. Disappointment with earthly practice. Addictive pleasure-seeking.

**Cascade effects:**
<god-realm-attachment> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<pleasure-garden-hedonism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<wish-fulfilling-tree-dependency> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

<heavenly-tourism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[931-932]
[GOD-REALM-ATTACHMENT] [LHA REBIRTH ADDICTION]
**Misreading:**
The superior pleasures and longevity of *lha* (gods) interpreted as something to actively pursue through merit, rather than a trap that prevents liberation.

**Why it arises:**
Descriptions of infinite pleasure. Long lifespans. Beautiful bodies. The god realm seems like success.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual practice is instrumentalized for rebirth. Liberation is postponed for pleasure. Attachment masquerades as aspiration.

**Secondary consequences:**
Moralistic accumulation. Fear of falling from heaven. The whole point of Dharma—freedom from all realms—is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<merit-inflation> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<heaven-anxiety> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<pleasure-spirituality> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[933-934]
[SEVEN-MOUNTAIN-HIERARCHY] [RI BDUN CLIMBING METAPHOR]
**Misreading:**
The seven golden mountains (*ri bdun*) surrounding Meru interpreted as literal climbing stages—each higher level representing spiritual advancement.

**Why it arises:**
Sequential arrangement. Higher = better spatial logic. The seven numbers correspond to spiritual "stages."

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual progress is verticalized. "Climbing the mountain" congeals into literal. Horizontal integration is neglected.

**Secondary consequences:**
Hierarchy obsession. Status by "altitude." Lower levels are denigrated. The circular equality around the center is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-elitism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<hierarchical-consciousness> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<climbing-mentality> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

<vertical-path-obsession> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[935-936]
[PALACE-MATERIALIZATION] [PHO BRANG ARCHITECTURAL LITERALISM]
**Misreading:**
The descriptions of celestial palaces (*pho brang*)—made of gold, jewels, precious substances—interpreted as literal architecture rather than symbolic representations of purified mind.

**Why it arises:**
Specific architectural details (gser gyi sa gzhi, bang rim). Named structures like "gser ldan grong khyer." The opulence is catalogued.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual wealth is externalized. Architecture replaces insight. The palace of mind is confused with buildings.

**Secondary consequences:**
Materialistic spirituality. Building projects as practice. Opulent temples justified. Wealth display as virtue signal.

**Cascade effects:**
<architectural-fetishism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<temple-materialism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<precious-substance-obsession> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<opulent-spirituality> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[937-938]
[PLEASURE-GARDEN-HEDONISM] [SKYED MOS TSHAL SENSUALISM]
**Misreading:**
The pleasure gardens (*skyed mos tshal*)—named Dga' ba, Rab tu dga' ba, Kun dga' ra ba—interpreted as literal places of sensory enjoyment rather than symbols of cultivated bliss.

**Why it arises:**
Names emphasize pleasure. Descriptions of beautiful landscapes. Sensory delights are catalogued.

**Primary consequence:**
Hedonism congeals into spiritual practice. "Enjoying the garden" replaces meditation. Sensory pleasure is confused with spiritual bliss.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spa spirituality. Retreat centers as pleasure destinations. The dukkha of pleasure is missed. Addiction to "beautiful practice places."

**Cascade effects:**
<sensual-spirituality> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<retreat-hedonism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<beautiful-place-addiction> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<pleasure-confused-with-bliss> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[939-940]
[WISH-FULFILLING-TREE-DEPENDENCY] [DPAG BSAM SHING EXTERNALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
The wish-fulfilling tree (*dpag bsam gyi shing*) interpreted as an actual tree that grants desires, rather than a symbol of self-sufficient contentment and the mind's creative power.

**Why it arises:**
The name means "thoughts become real." The tree fulfills wishes. It sounds like magical object.

**Primary consequence:**
External source for satisfaction is sought. Contentment is delegated to objects. The mind's power is projected outward.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual consumerism. "Manifestation" teachings. The real work of transforming mind is replaced by wish-making.

**Cascade effects:**
<manifestation-mania> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<external-savior-seeking> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<object-dependency> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[941-942]
[DIVINE-POSSESSION-FETISHISM] [LONGS SPYOD MATERIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The descriptions of divine possessions—elephants, horses, clothing, jewels, nectar beverages—interpreted as catalogues of desirable objects to manifest or acquire.

**Why it arises:**
Detailed lists of beautiful things. Descriptions of abundance. The language sounds like luxury catalog.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual practice congeals into acquisition technique. Wealth is merit indicator. Poverty is spiritual failure.

**Secondary consequences:**
Prosperity gospel Buddhism. Material success as Dharma proof. The renunciation message is inverted.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-materialism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<prosperity-dharma> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<wealth-as-virtue> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[943-944]
[SUN-MOON-DEITY-WORSHIP] [NYI ZLA GZA' SKAR CULT]
**Misreading:**
The mention of sun, moon, stars, and planets (*nyi zla gza' skar*) in the celestial hierarchy interpreted as endorsing solar/lunar worship or astrological determinism.

**Why it arises:**
Celestial bodies are placed in the cosmology. Ancient cultures worship them. The connection is assumed.

**Primary consequence:**
Astrology replaces insight. Solar/lunar rituals proliferate. The astronomy is confused with astrology.

**Secondary consequences:**
Birth chart determinism. Auspicious timing obsession. Light/dark dualism. The cosmos is personalized.

**Cascade effects:**
<astrological-determinism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<solar-cult> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<lunar-ritualism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[945-946]
[TIME-DILATION-OBSESSION] [BSKAL PA CALCULATION MANIA]
**Misreading:**
The mention of *bskal pa* (kalpas/eons) and the lifespan of gods interpreted as invitations to calculate cosmic time, compare lifespans, or obsess over temporal vastness.

**Why it arises:**
Numbers are given (dpag tshad measurements). Comparisons are made. Time dilation is dramatic.

**Primary consequence:**
Temporal fascination replaces present practice. "Long life" congeals into goal. The timeless is sought through time calculation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Cosmic number mysticism. Lifespan comparison hierarchies. Present moment is devalued. Eternalism is embraced.

**Cascade effects:**
<temporal-grandiosity> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<kalpa-mathematics> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<longevity-obsession> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[947-948]
[EIGHT-NAGA-ELEMENTAL-FIXATION] [KLU BRGYAD ELEMENT SPIRIT WORSHIP]
**Misreading:**
The eight nagas (*klu brgyad*)—Dga' bo, Nye dga', Rta'i gzhi, etc.—interpreted as elemental spirits to be worshipped, propitiated, or controlled for power over weather and elements.

**Why it arises:**
Named beings with palaces (*pho brang*). They control rain and elements. They sound like nature spirits.

**Primary consequence:**
Elemental worship replaces insight. Rituals for rain. Naga propitiation congeals into primary practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Nature spirit obsession. Weather control rituals. Elemental manipulation. The symbolic meaning of nagas (energy currents) is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<naga-worship> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<elemental-spiritism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<weather-magic> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

<energy-current-reification> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[949-950]
[SEASONAL-DEITY-CONTROL] [DUS BZHI FUNCTIONALISM]
**Misreading:**
The directional deities controlling seasons (*dus bzhi*)—summer rain, autumn harvest, etc.—interpreted as endorsing seasonal rituals, agricultural magic, or weather control practices.

**Why it arises:**
Specific functions given. Seasonal control mentioned. The deities seem to manage nature.

**Primary consequence:**
Ritual functionalism. Magic for harvest. Seasonal practices replace continuous practice. Nature is managed rather than understood.

**Secondary consequences:**
Agricultural superstition. Weather anxiety. Functional deity worship. The deities' symbolic meaning solidifies as utility.

**Cascade effects:**
<agricultural-magic> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<seasonal-ritualism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<weather-anxiety> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<functional-deity-worship> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<harvest-spirituality> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[951-952]
[REALM-HIERARCHY-CLIMBING] [STENG GI RIS STATUS ADDICTION]
**Misreading:**
The hierarchical arrangement of realms (*steng gi ris*, *gong nas gong du*) interpreted as a ladder to climb—spiritual success measured by how "high" one is reborn.

**Why it arises:**
Vertical arrangement suggests hierarchy. "Higher" realms have more pleasure and longevity. Success seems measurable.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual practice is instrumentalized for status. Rebirth is competitive. The equality of all beings is denied.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual elitism. Merit as currency. "Lower" beings are pitied or despised. Liberation is replaced by elevation.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-class-system> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<rebirth-competition> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<hierarchical-consciousness> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<merit-status> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<spiritual-snobbery> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[953-954]
[CONTAINER-BEING-CONFUSION] [SNOD BCUD DUALISM]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between container world (*snod*) and beings (*bcud*) interpreted as endorsing a subject-object dualism where environment and inhabitants are fundamentally separate.

**Why it arises:**
The terms suggest two categories. The cosmology describes both. Separation seems inherent.

**Primary consequence:**
Environment is other. Beings are separate from world. The interdependence of mind and environment is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Environmental alienation. World as resource. Nature/culture split. The non-dual nature of experience is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
<environmental-exploitation> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<subject-object-dualism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<world-alienation> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

<nature-culture-split> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[955-956]
[KALPA-DURATION-FETISHISM] [TSHE BSKAL PA ETERNALISM]
**Misreading:**
The statement that certain beings last "one kalpa" (*tshe bskal par gnas pa*) interpreted as endorsing eternal existence rather than illustrating the temporary nature even of long-lasting phenomena.

**Why it arises:**
"Lasting a kalpa" sounds like permanence. The duration is impressive. It seems like achievement.

**Primary consequence:**
Longevity congeals into spiritual goal. Eternalism is embraced. The impermanence of even kalpas is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Death denial. Long-life obsession. The central teaching—impermanence—is contradicted.

**Cascade effects:**
<eternalism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<death-denial> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<longevity-mania> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[957-958]
[WIND-GODDESS-ANIMISM] [RLUNG GI LHA MO NATURE WORSHIP]
**Misreading:**
The four wind goddesses (*rlung gi lha mo bzhi*) interpreted as nature deities to be worshipped, embodying or controlling the winds rather than representing the movement of prana.

**Why it arises:**
Named feminine deities. Associated with natural phenomena. They seem like animistic spirits.

**Primary consequence:**
Wind worship replaces breath awareness. External goddesses are propitiated. Prana is externalized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Nature goddess cults. Elemental worship. The internal winds are projected outward.

**Cascade effects:**
<wind-worship> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<prana-externalization> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<nature-goddess-cults> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[959-960]
[KARMIC-ASTRONOMY-CONFUSION] [LAS SKAR MORAL ASTROLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The intersection of karma (*las*) and celestial bodies (*skar*) interpreted as endorsing moral astrology—birth charts showing karmic destiny, planets influencing moral fate.

**Why it arises:**
Celestial mechanics and karma both mentioned. Ancient cultures combined them. The temptation is strong.

**Primary consequence:**
Karma is astrologized. Birth congeals into destiny. Freedom is denied by "cosmic alignment."

**Secondary consequences:**
Fatalism. Astrological determinism. The malleability of karma is forgotten. Stars become tyrants.

**Cascade effects:**
<karmic-determinism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<birth-chart-fatalism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<astrological-karma> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[ROYAL-FOUR-ELITISM] [RGYAL CHEN BZHI DEVOTION]
**Misreading:**
The four great kings (*rgyal chen bzhi*)—Gser rkang, Stobs ldan, 'Jug srid, Grags pa'i dpal—interpreted as objects of devotion or identification, representing spiritual aristocracy.

**Why it arises:**
They have royal titles. They control territory. They sound like spiritual nobility.

**Primary consequence:**
Hierarchy is divinized. Royalty is spiritual. The equality of all paths is denied.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual aristocracy. Devotion to cosmic royalty. Democratic spirituality is rejected.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-aristocracy> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<royal-devotion> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<hierarchical-worship> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[963-964]
[COSMIC-DISEASE-EXTERNALIZATION] [MI NAD PHYUGS NAD FATALISM]
**Misreading:**
The mention that certain beings send diseases and calamities (*mi nad*, *phyugs nad*, *mtshon*, *mu ge*) interpreted as endorsing fatalism—suffering is externally imposed rather than karmically conditioned.

**Why it arises:**
External beings cause harm. It sounds like punishment. Victimhood is validated.

**Primary consequence:**
Suffering is blamed on others. Personal responsibility is avoided. External enemies are identified.

**Secondary consequences:**
Scapegoating. Fatalism. The teaching of karma is contradicted. Victim consciousness is reinforced.

**Cascade effects:**
<victim-consciousness> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[DIRECTIONAL-GUARDIAN-WORSHIP] [PHYOGS SKYONG SUPERSTITION]
**Misreading:**
The directional guardians (*phyogs skyong*) and local deities (*yul lha*, *gzhi bdag*) interpreted as requiring worship, appeasement, or contractual relationship for protection.

**Why it arises:**
They're described as powerful. They influence local conditions. Ancient practices involved propitiation.

**Primary consequence:**
Local deity worship proliferates. Contracts with spirits. Protection is bought rather than cultivated.

**Secondary consequences:**
Superstition replaces practice. Fear of local spirits. Territory congeals into spiritually dangerous.

[BANG-RIM-STATUS-CLIMBING] [BANG RIM FOURTHIERARCHY]
**Misreading:**
The four terraces (*bang rim bzhi*) of Mount Meru interpreted as literal stages of spiritual advancement—each higher terrace representing superior spiritual status.

**Why it arises:**
Four levels described sequentially. Higher levels mentioned. Progression seems inherent.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual materialism. "Level" congeals into status. The flat equality at each level is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Hierarchy obsession. Terrace-climbing mentality. Spiritual elitism by "altitude."

[969-970]
[GOD-REALM-SUPERIORITY-COMPLEX] [LHA'I RIS SPIRITUAL ARISTOCRACY]
**Misreading:**
The detailed descriptions of god realms (*lha'i ris*) interpreted as establishing a spiritual aristocracy that practitioners should aspire to join—a divine upper class.

**Why it arises:**
The opulence is seductive. The superiority is explicit. It looks like the pinnacle of success.

**Primary consequence:**
Divine superiority is sought. Spiritual aristocracy is the goal. The equality of all beings in Buddha-nature is forgotten.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual class consciousness. Elitism. The path of the bodhisattva—helping all beings—is replaced by personal elevation.

[CELESTIAL-ARCHITECTURE-FETISHISM] [KHANG BZANGS MATERIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The celestial palaces (*khang bzangs*, *pho brang*) interpreted as architectural achievements to replicate or visit, rather than symbolic representations of mind's inherent radiance.

**Why it arises:**
Detailed architectural descriptions. Precious materials catalogued. The beauty is overwhelming.

**Primary consequence:**
Architecture replaces realization. Building projects become practice. The inner palace is projected outward.

**Secondary consequences:**
Materialistic spirituality. Opulent temple construction. Wealth display. The simplicity of practice is lost.

[COSMIC-SYMBOLISM-LITERALIZATION] [MNGON RTOGS TIBETANIZATION]
**Misreading:**
The entire Abhidharma cosmology interpreted as Tibetan (rather than Indian) geography, to be mapped onto the Himalayan region specifically, with Meru as Kailash and Tibetan valleys as the continents.

**Why it arises:**
is Tibetan. Ti-se is mentioned. The temptation to "root" cosmology locally is strong.

**Primary consequence:**
Cosmology congeals into nationalism. Tibetan exceptionalism. Other cultures' spiritual maps are delegitimized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Cultural appropriation reversed. Sacred geography wars. The universal nature of the symbolism is lost.

[975-976]
[COSMOLOGY-DIDACTIC-FUNDAMENTALISM] [SGRA BSHAD LITERALISM]
**Misreading:**
The detailed Abhidharma explanations (*sgra bshad*) interpreted as requiring literal belief—rejection of modern cosmology (astronomy, geology) as "wrong" because Abhidharma says otherwise.

**Why it arises:**
The detail suggests authority. Traditional teachings are valued. Modern science seems threatening.

**Primary consequence:**
Fundamentalism. Science denial. Buddhism is put in opposition to knowledge.

**Secondary consequences:**
Intellectual isolation. Buddhism appears anti-scientific. The symbolic nature of cosmology is denied.

**Cascade effects:**

[977-978]
[ABHIDHARMA-COSMOLOGY-ESOTERICISM] [CHOS MNGON PA SECRECY]
**Misreading:**
The Abhidharma cosmology interpreted as esoteric teaching requiring secret transmission, special empowerments, or exclusive access—rather than being standard Buddhist doctrine.

**Why it arises:**
The complexity suggests esotericism. The detail implies importance. Secrecy seems to add value.

**Primary consequence:**
Standard teachings are restricted. Elitism around cosmology. Access is controlled.

**Secondary consequences:**
Democratic Buddhism is undermined. Knowledge is hoarded. The open nature of Dharma is forgotten.

**Cascade effects:**
<teaching-hoarding> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<cosmological-elitism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[COSMIC-CALCULATION-SPIRITUAL-BYPASS] [DPAG TSAD MATHEMATICAL OBSESSION]
**Misreading:**
The precise measurements (*dpag tshad*) throughout the text interpreted as requiring mathematical mastery, calculation exercises, or scholarly obsession as prerequisites for practice.

**Why it arises:**
Numbers suggest precision. Measurement implies science. Calculation seems rigorous.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice is delayed until "understanding" is complete. Intellectual mastery replaces realization. Scholars lord over practitioners.

**Secondary consequences:**
Analysis-paralysis. Spiritual bypass through scholarship. The simple practice of awareness is neglected.

**Cascade effects:**
<analysis-paralysis> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<scholarly-elitism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<intellectual-bypass> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[GEOGRAPHIC-BOUNDARY-PURIFICATION] [GLING MTSHAMS TERRITORIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The boundaries between continents (*gling mtshams*) interpreted as actual spiritual boundaries—contaminating to cross, requiring purification rituals, establishing spiritual territoriality.

**Why it arises:**
Boundaries are specified. Separation is emphasized. Territory seems significant.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual xenophobia. Boundary maintenance. Crossing borders congeals into spiritually dangerous.

**Secondary consequences:**
Territorial spirituality. Purity obsession. The interconnectedness of all realms is denied.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-xenophobia> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<territorial-purity> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<boundary-obsession> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[983-984]
[COSMOLOGY-THERAPY-SUBSTITUTION] [SGRIB GNON REPLACEMENT]
**Misreading:**
The cosmological teachings interpreted as therapeutic tools for managing anxiety, finding meaning, or psychological integration—rather than descriptions of actual conditions requiring liberation.

**Why it arises:**
Modern therapeutic culture. Psychology is trusted. The literal seems "unscientific."

**Primary consequence:**
Liberation is replaced by therapy. Hell congeals into "emotional state." Heaven congeals into "mental wellness."

**Secondary consequences:**
The urgency of practice is lost. Suffering is medicalized. Buddhism congeals into self-help.

**Cascade effects:**
<therapeutic-reductionism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<liberation-to-wellness> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<spiritual-materialism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[SYNCHRONIC-COSMOLOGY-DOGMATISM] [DUS MNYAM FUNDAMENTALISM]
**Misreading:**
The statement that certain beings arise simultaneously with world-formation (*'jig rten chags pa dang mnyam*) interpreted as endorsing creationism or fixed temporal schemes—denying evolution, change, or contingency.

**Why it arises:**
"Arising with creation" sounds like creationism. The temporal structure seems fixed. Change seems denied.

**Primary consequence:**
Creationist Buddhism. Evolution denial. Contingency is rejected.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fundamentalism. Anti-science. The dynamic nature of dependent origination is forgotten.

**Cascade effects:**
<creationist-buddhism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<evolution-denial> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<temporal-fundamentalism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[987-988]
[COSMIC-HARMONY-OBSESSION] [MI MTHUN PAR SPYOD PEACE ADDICTION]
**Misreading:**
The ordered, harmonious descriptions of the cosmos interpreted as endorsing peace at all costs, harmony as highest value, conflict as always bad—rather than recognizing the dynamic tensions of samsara.

**Why it arises:**
The order is beautiful. Harmony is appealing. Conflict is unpleasant.

**Primary consequence:**
False peace is sought. Conflict is denied. The dukkha of samsara is glossed over.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual bypassing. False tranquility. The motivation for practice—recognizing suffering—is weakened.

**Cascade effects:**
<peace-addiction> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<conflict-denial> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<false-tranquility> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[989-990]
[COSMOLOGY-CULTURAL-APPROPRIATION] [RGYA GAR EXOTICISM]
**Misreading:**
The Indian origins of cosmology interpreted as requiring cultural adoption—practitioners must become culturally Indian, adopt Sanskrit terms, reject local adaptations—to "authenticate" practice.

**Why it arises:**
is Indian in origin. Authenticity is sought. Local seems "diluted."

**Primary consequence:**
Cultural appropriation reversed. Local wisdom is rejected. Indian culture is fetishized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Identity confusion. Cultural imperialism. The universal message is obscured by cultural particularity.

**Cascade effects:**
<cultural-fetishism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<authenticity-obsession> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<indian-exceptionalism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[991-992]
[COSMIC-COMPARISON-COMPETITION] [GZHAN GYI GLING RIVALRY]
**Misreading:**
The descriptions of other continents interpreted as establishing spiritual competition—Jambudvipa practitioners competing with other continent practitioners for enlightenment speed, method superiority, etc.

**Why it arises:**
Comparisons are natural. Competition is cultural. Superiority feels good.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual competition. Continental rivalry. Comparison replaces practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Elitism. Nationalist spirituality. The universality of Buddha-nature is forgotten.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-competition> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<continental-rivalry> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<comparison-obsession> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[993-994]
[MOUNTAIN-GLORIFICATION-OBSESSION] [RI RAB CENTRALISM]
**Misreading:**
Mount Meru as the cosmic center interpreted as endorsing mountain worship, peak experiences as highest goal, altitude as spiritual attainment—literalizing the metaphor of "height."

**Why it arises:**
Center = important. Height = achievement. Mountains are impressive.

**Primary consequence:**
Mountain climbing congeals into spiritual practice. Peak experiences are sought. Low places are spiritually denigrated.

**Secondary consequences:**
Nature worship. Height obsession. The "low" aspects of practice—grounding, humility—are neglected.

**Cascade effects:**
<mountain-worship> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<peak-experience-addiction> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<altitude-spirituality> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[995-996]
[GOLD-METAL-SPIRITUALIZATION] [GSER LCAGS PRECIOUS SUBSTANCE CULT]
**Misreading:**
The precious substances (gold, silver, jewels, iron) composing the cosmos interpreted as having spiritual power—wearing gold for "resonance," using metals ritually, material wealth as spiritual currency.

**Why it arises:**
Precious materials are valued. Spiritual significance is sought. Wealth is attractive.

**Primary consequence:**
Materialism replaces practice. Gold congeals into sacred. Wealth is spiritualized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Precious metal fetishism. Jewelry as protection. Economic inequality as spiritual hierarchy.

<gold-cult> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<jewelry-magic> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
