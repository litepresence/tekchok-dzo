[892-915] [SPATIAL SUBSTANTIALISM] [CONTAINER WORLD REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
The precise measurements of continents and oceans (350 yojanas, 7,500 yojanas, half-by-half reduction) interpreted as describing actual physical geography—like a map of another planet.

**Why it arises:**
Numbers create credibility. "20,000 yojanas below Ti-se" sounds like a measurement report. The systematic arrangement suggests empirical observation rather than visionary architecture.

**Primary consequence:**
Cosmology is literalized as astronomy. The "seven gold mountains" become geological formations to locate rather than recognition-topology to realize.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners try to calculate distances to hells. Meditation becomes spatial navigation. The maṇḍala's symbolic function is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [GEOGRAPHIC OBSESSION] (finding locations), [MEASUREMENT FETISHISM] (precise calculations), [COSMIC TOURISM] (visiting realms), [DIMENSIONAL LITERALISM] (physical interpretation), and [CONTAINER CONFUSION] (confusing snod with geography).

[916-940] [KARMIC GEOGRAPHY DETERMINISM] [VERTICAL HIERARCHY REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
The vertical arrangement of realms (hells below, heavens above) interpreted as a literal cosmic elevator—beings transported up or down based on moral score.

**Why it arises:**
"Below" and "above" are spatial metaphors. The correlation between moral quality and location seems to describe a physical law like gravity.

**Primary consequence:**
Rebirth is spatialized as relocation. Merit becomes altitude fuel. The psychological dimensions of suffering and pleasure are reduced to coordinates.

**Secondary consequences:**
Moral behavior is motivated by destination-seeking. Spiritual practice becomes elevation-technology. Suffering is seen as bad location rather than conditioned perception.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [COSMIC TOURISM] (booking heaven tickets), [MORAL GEOGRAPHY] (mapping virtue to space), [VERTICAL DUALISM] (up=good/down=bad), [LOCATION ANXIETY] (worrying about rebirth coordinates), and [SPATIAL ESCAPISM] (climbing away from problems).
