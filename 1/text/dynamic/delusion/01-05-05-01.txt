[6759-6800] <meditation-objectification>
**Risk:** Empowerment presented as meditative object to be cultivated through practice—awareness becomes commodity produced through technique.

**Why:** Instructional language presupposes agent, action, object. Practice implies production. Technique promises control.

**Consequence:** Meditation becomes object-manipulation. Experience-chasing substitutes for recognition. Method shopping. Spirituality as self-improvement project.

**Cascade:** Objectification → grasping → attachment → suffering → seeking → endless cycle.

[6766-6780] <conduct-externalization>
**Risk:** Empowerment established as external behavioral requirement—conduct separate from view, rule-based ethics.

**Why:** Prescriptive language implies obligation. Conduct as visible activity suggests external observability.

**Consequence:** Rule-following substitutes for wisdom. Ethics separated from realization becomes moralism. Social presentation masks internal confusion.

**Cascade:** Performance anxiety, hypocrisy, rigidity, external validation addiction.

**CORRECTION:** Empowerment is not something given by guru to student but recognition of what is already present. Meditation is not producing awareness but recognizing it. Conduct flows naturally from recognition, not external rules.

The qualities of the guru described—compassion, skill, dzogchen instruction—are not achievements to attain but expressions of recognition already complete.

The risk: treating these qualities as checklist to verify rather than natural expressions of recognition. The guru's qualities point to the nature, not to a person to admire.

When empowerment is seen as something the guru "does to" you, the student remains dependent. When recognized as what is already present, liberation is immediate.

The "four characteristics of the guru" (discarding samsara, few desires, compassion, skill in view) are not prerequisites but descriptions of one who recognizes—the recognition itself produces these qualities naturally.

This applies to the student as well: the qualities are not "developed" through practice but recognized as already present. This is the meaning of "vajra holder"—one who recognizes the nature, not one who has achieved something.

The presentation of "basis, path, result" in the empowerment context can be misread as sequential development. The correct reading: basis is the recognition itself, path is maintaining that recognition, result is recognizing that there was never anything to develop—the basis was always complete.

The distinction between "vajra holder" and ordinary practitioner: one has recognized, the other seeks. But the seeking is also recognition playing hide and seek with itself.

When the student seeks empowerment, the seeking itself is the recognition looking for itself.
