[4696-4704] <trekcho-completion-achievement> <three-kaya-gaze-training>

**Misreading:**
The instruction to "train in the three gazes of the three kayas" (*sku gsum gyi gzigs stangs gsum la bslab ste*) interpreted as a sequential training program where one masters Trekcho first through specific kaya-gaze techniques, creating a curriculum-based approach to recognition.

**Why it arises:**
"Training" suggests pedagogy. "Three" implies curriculum structure. Educational mindset: learn basics, then advanced. The practitioner approaches recognition as course to complete.

**Primary consequence:**
Curriculum-approach: treating three gazes as lessons to master. Natural recognition is replaced by training program.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Sequential fixation: "I need to master Dharmakaya gaze first"
- Missing that all three gazes point to same recognition
- Practice-anxiety about "progress" through curriculum

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-completion-achievement> → <curriculum-fixation> [training program mindset] → <sequential-mastery> [lesson-by-lesson approach] → <natural-recognition-miss> [training over being]

[4696-4704] <thogal-visualization> <kaya-gaze-externalization>

**Misreading:**
The three gazes (*gzigs stangs gsum*)—Dharmakaya reversal (*bzlog*), Sambhogakaya side-glance (*zur*), Nirmanakaya downward (*phab*)—interpreted as specific physical eye positions to adopt and hold, creating fixation on external posture.

**Why it arises:**
"Gaze" suggests eye direction. "Downward/sideways" implies physical positioning. Embodiment traditions emphasize posture. The practitioner literalizes gaze as eye movement.

**Primary consequence:**
Posture-fixation: holding specific eye positions. Natural recognition is obscured by physical performance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Eye strain from "holding" gazes
- Missing that gazes indicate recognition, not cause it
- Posture pride: "I can hold the Dharmakaya gaze"

**Cascade effects:**
<thogal-visualization> → <posture-fixation> [physical eye position] → <performance-anxiety> [holding gaze correctly] → <recognition-miss> [posture over nature]

---

[4699-4704] <citation-fetishism> <scriptural-validation-seeking>

**Misreading:**
The citation from *dpal nam mkha' dang mnyam pa'i rgyud* interpreted as establishing authority through textual reference, creating dependence on tantric proof-texts rather than direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
"From the Tantra" suggests proof. Citation implies validation. Religious dependence: "The text says so." Academic habit of sourcing claims.

**Primary consequence:**
Textual-dependence: deferring to scriptural authority. Direct experience is replaced by citation-seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Where is this in the texts?" over direct seeing
- Missing that citation points to experience, not replaces it
- Argumentation about textual sources rather than practice

**Cascade effects:**
<citation-fetishism> → <scriptural-dependence> [external validation] → <experience-deferral> [text over seeing] → <citation-debate> [argument over recognition]

---

[4705-4707] <etymological-literalism> <yige-med-visualization>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "from no letter" (*yi ge med pa las*) interpreted as starting visualization practice from a blank or empty state, creating fixation on absence as starting point.

**Why it arises:**
"No letter" suggests blank slate. "From" implies origin point. Visualization traditions begin with emptiness. The practitioner literalizes as meditative starting point.

**Primary consequence:**
Blank-state-fixation: seeking letterless origin. Natural awareness is obscured by constructed emptiness.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Emptying" as prerequisite practice
- Missing that no-letter is nature, not state to achieve
- Preparatory fixation: "I must get to no-letter first"

**Cascade effects:**
<etymological-literalism> → <blank-state-fixation> [emptiness as origin] → <preparatory-obsession> [getting to ground] → <natural-awareness-miss> [construction over nature]

---

[4708-4711] <three-gaze-enumeration> <gzigs-stangs-compartmentalization>

**Misreading:**
The three gazes enumerated from *gsang ba sgra rgyud* interpreted as three distinct techniques to practice separately, creating checklist mentality about gaze-mastery.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests set to complete. Enumeration implies separate items. List-making mind catalogs practices. The practitioner works through the three gazes.

**Primary consequence:**
Gaze-checklist: going through three items separately. Natural recognition is replaced by sequential practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I've done gaze one, now gaze two"
- Missing that three gazes are aspects of single recognition
- Anxiety about "completing" all three

**Cascade effects:**
<three-gaze-enumeration> → <gaze-checklist> [separate practices] → <sequential-anxiety> [completing all three] → <single-recognition-miss> [three as one]

---

[4712-4714] <kaya-dualism> <three-kaya-separation>

**Misreading:**
The distinction between Nirmanakaya gazing at disciples (*gdul bya la gzigs*), Sambhogakaya gazing at pure lands (*zhing khams la gzigs*), and Dharmakaya gazing at ground (*gzhi la gzigs*) interpreted as three separate activities of three separate entities, creating tritheistic conception of kayas.

**Why it arises:**
"Gazing at" suggests subject-object. Three different objects imply three subjects. Dualistic pattern: seer and seen. The practitioner sees kayas as separate beings.

**Primary consequence:**
Kaya-tritheism: three separate entities with different activities. Indivisible three kayas are compartmentalized.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Preference for "higher" kaya (Dharmakaya)
- Missing that three kayas are single display
- Hierarchical conception of enlightenment

**Cascade effects:**
<kaya-dualism> → <kaya-tritheism> [three separate entities] → <hierarchical-preference> [higher/lower kayas] → <indivisibility-miss> [single display lost]

---

[4715-4717] <therapeutic-instrumentalization> <eye-condition-adaptation>

**Misreading:**
The matching of gazes to eye conditions—poor eyesight (*mig shas ngan pas*) with Nirmanakaya, eye defects (*mig la skyon chags pas*) with Sambhogakaya, good eyesight (*mig shas bzang bas*) with Dharmakaya—interpreted as therapeutic prescription where practice is adapted to physical limitations, creating medicalized approach.

**Why it arises:**
"Poor/good eyesight" suggests medical condition. Matching implies prescription. Wellness culture adapts practice to ability. The practitioner treats gazes as eye therapy.

**Primary consequence:**
Therapeutic-reduction: treating recognition as vision therapy. Natural recognition is medicalized.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My eyes aren't good enough for Dharmakaya gaze"
- Missing that gazes transcend physical conditions
- Physical limitation as spiritual limitation

**Cascade effects:**
<therapeutic-instrumentalization> → <therapeutic-reduction> [medical approach] → <physical-limitation> [body as obstacle] → <recognition-medicalization> [therapy over nature]

---

[4715-4717] <talent-meritocracy> <mig-shas-spiritual-hierarchy>

**Misreading:**
The correlation between good eyesight and Dharmakaya gaze interpreted as spiritual hierarchy where physical faculties indicate spiritual capacity, creating meritocratic elitism about "advanced" practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
"Good eyesight" suggests natural gift. Correlation implies causation. Meritocratic mindset: better faculties = better practitioner. The practitioner assumes physical superiority = spiritual superiority.

**Primary consequence:**
Faculty-elitism: "I have good eyesight, therefore Dharmakaya gaze is for me." Natural recognition is obscured by physical pride.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Discrimination against "lesser" practitioners
- Missing that recognition is equally accessible
- Physical privilege as spiritual attainment

**Cascade effects:**
<talent-meritocracy> → <faculty-elitism> [physical superiority] → <spiritual-discrimination> [hierarchy of practitioners] → <equal-recognition-miss> [faculty over nature]

---

[4718-4724] <three-eye-enumeration> <spyan-gsum-compartmentalization>

**Misreading:**
The three wisdom eyes (*spyan gsum*)—Dharmata eye (*chos nyid kyi spyan*), Wisdom eye (*ye shes kyi spyan*), Discriminating eye (*shes rab kyi spyan*)—interpreted as three separate attainments to develop sequentially, creating progressive checklist.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests set to master. "Eye" implies faculty to develop. Educational progress models: master one, then next. The practitioner collects three eyes.

**Primary consequence:**
Eye-collecting: treating three eyes as achievements to unlock. Natural wisdom is obscured by pursuit.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Sequential fixation: "I need to get Dharmata eye first"
- Missing that all three are aspects of single awareness
- Practice-anxiety about "getting" all three eyes

**Cascade effects:**
<three-eye-enumeration> → <eye-collecting> [achievement checklist] → <sequential-fixation> [order anxiety] → <single-awareness-miss> [missing unity]

---

[4719-4720] <byin-rlabs-dependence> <blessing-externalization>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "by the power of its blessing" (*de'i byin rlabs kyis*) interpreted as actual transmission or empowerment flowing from external source, creating dependence on external blessing-power.

**Why it arises:**
"Blessing" suggests transmission. "Power" implies energy transfer. Theistic/devotional traditions emphasize divine grace. The practitioner waits for blessing to "come."

**Primary consequence:**
Blessing-dependence: seeking external empowerment. Natural recognition is deferred to external source.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I haven't received the blessing yet"
- Missing that blessing is self-recognition
- External seeking rather than direct seeing

**Cascade effects:**
<byin-rlabs-dependence> → <blessing-externalization> [seeking transmission] → <empowerment-waiting> [awaiting power] → <self-recognition-deferral> [external over internal]

---

[4720-4724] <ye-shes-mthong-achievement> <wisdom-seeing-acquisition>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "actually seeing wisdom" (*ye shes dngos su mthong ba*) interpreted as achieving special capacity to perceive wisdom as object, creating subject-object dualism in recognition.

**Why it arises:**
"Seeing" suggests perception. "Wisdom" implies object to perceive. Dualistic pattern: seer and seen. The practitioner seeks to "see" wisdom.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom-perception: treating wisdom as object to see. Non-dual recognition is replaced by subject-object dualism.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "What does wisdom look like?"
- Missing that wisdom is not object but nature
- Perceptual seeking rather than recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<ye-shes-mthong-achievement> → <wisdom-perception> [object to see] → <subject-object-dualism> [seer and seen] → <non-dual-miss> [perception over nature]

---

[4721-4722] <rang-gsal-externalization> <self-clarity-objectification>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "seeing self-clarity" (*rang gsal du mthong ba*) interpreted as observing one's own clear nature as object of perception, creating self-reflexive observation loop.

**Why it arises:**
"Self" suggests identity. "Clarity" implies quality to observe. Self-improvement culture: observe yourself. The practitioner tries to "see" their clarity.

**Primary consequence:**
Self-obsession: watching oneself for clarity. Natural self-clarity is obscured by self-monitoring.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Am I clear right now?"
- Missing that self-clarity is not object of observation
- Narcissistic self-fascination as practice

**Cascade effects:**
<rang-gsal-externalization> → <self-obsession> [watching oneself] → <self-monitoring> [checking clarity] → <natural-clarity-miss> [observation over being]

---

[4723-4724] <thugs-gsang-externalization> <mind-secret-reification>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "seeing without words" (*sgra tshig dang bral bar mthong ba*) in relation to Nirmanakaya's mind-secret (*thugs gsang*) interpreted as accessing hidden mind-content beyond language, creating esoteric fascination with secret teachings.

**Why it arises:**
"Secret" suggests hidden knowledge. "Without words" implies transmission beyond language. Esoteric traditions value secret teachings. The practitioner seeks wordless secrets.

**Primary consequence:**
Esoteric-fixation: pursuing secret transmissions. Natural recognition is obscured by mystery-seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "The real teachings are wordless"
- Missing that clarity is openly present
- Secret-hunting as spiritual practice

**Cascade effects:**
<thugs-gsang-externalization> → <esoteric-fixation> [secret pursuit] → <mystery-seeking> [hidden knowledge] → <open-presence-miss> [secret over obvious]

---

[4725-4727] <gnad-fetishism> <key-point-obsession>

**Misreading:**
The three "key points" (*gnad*)—Dharmata eye reversing upward (*gyen la bzlog pa*), Wisdom eye gazing equally at side (*zur la mnyam por bltas pa*), Discriminating eye looking downward (*phab nas bltas pa*)—interpreted as secret techniques or crucial methods that must be precisely executed, creating obsession with getting the "key" right.

**Why it arises:**
"Key point" suggests crucial technique. "Three" implies secrets to master. Technical traditions emphasize precision. The practitioner seeks the essential trick.

**Primary consequence:**
Technique-obsession: trying to hit the "key point." Natural recognition is replaced by technical precision-seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety about "getting" the gnad
- Missing that gnad is recognition itself
- Technical perfectionism as practice

**Cascade effects:**
<gnad-fetishism> → <key-point-obsession> [secret technique] → <technical-perfectionism> [executing correctly] → <recognition-miss> [technique over nature]

---

[4725] <bag-chags-purification-project> <karmic-trace-elimination>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "purifying karmic traces downward" (*bag chags thur la sel ba*) interpreted as active elimination of past karma through specific practice, creating purification-project mentality.

**Why it arises:**
"Purifying" suggests cleaning. "Karmic traces" implies past stains to remove. Moral/spiritual traditions emphasize purification. The practitioner works to cleanse traces.

**Primary consequence:**
Purification-project: treating traces as stains to eliminate. Natural purity is obscured by cleaning-effort.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to purify my karma"
- Missing that traces are empty display
- Moral anxiety about past actions

**Cascade effects:**
<bag-chags-purification-project> → <karmic-trace-elimination> [stain removal] → <moral-anxiety> [past actions] → <natural-purity-miss> [cleaning over nature]

---

[4726] <khor-das-ro-mnyam-intellectualization> <samsara-nirvana-blending-concept>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "blending samsara and nirvana equally" (*'khor 'das ro mnyam du bsre ba*) interpreted as philosophical position or meditation technique of equalizing opposites, creating conceptual practice of "everything is the same."

**Why it arises:**
"Equally" suggests concept. "Blending" implies technique. Non-dual philosophy emphasizes equality. The practitioner thinks about equality.

**Primary consequence:**
Conceptual-equality: "samsara and nirvana are the same" as thought. Natural equality is replaced by philosophical position.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Intellectual pride: "I understand non-duality"
- Missing that equality is not position but nature
- "Everything is equal" as dismissive bypass

**Cascade effects:**
<khor-das-ro-mnyam-intellectualization> → <conceptual-equality> [thought about equal] → <philosophical-pride> [understanding vs being] → <natural-equality-miss> [position over nature]

---

[4727] <ye-shes-snang-ba-attachment> <wisdom-display-chasing>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "actually descending wisdom display" (*ye shes kyi snang ba dngos su 'bebs pa*) interpreted as achieving special visionary experience of wisdom-manifestation, creating attachment to spectacular displays.

**Why it arises:**
"Display" suggests phenomenon. "Wisdom" implies special experience. Visionary traditions value spectacular experiences. The practitioner seeks wisdom-visions.

**Primary consequence:**
Display-chasing: seeking special wisdom-appearances. Natural display is obscured by visionary pursuit.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Disappointment when no displays appear
- Manufacturing visionary experiences
- Missing that all display is wisdom-nature

**Cascade effects:**
<ye-shes-snang-ba-attachment> → <wisdom-display-chasing> [seeking visions] → <expectation-manufacturing> [creating experiences] → <natural-display-miss> [vision over nature]

---

[4728-4731] <temperament-determinism> <le-lo-btson-snyoms-typology>

**Misreading:**
The classification of gazes by temperament—lazy (*le lo can*) gets Sambhogakaya, diligent (*brtson 'grus can*) gets Nirmanakaya, equanimous (*btang snyoms can*) gets Dharmakaya—interpreted as fixed typology where one's innate character determines practice, creating deterministic approach.

**Why it arises:**
"Lazy/diligent/equanimous" suggests personality types. Classification implies fixed categories. Psychological typologies (Enneagram, MBTI) categorize people. The practitioner identifies with type.

**Primary consequence:**
Type-fixation: "I am lazy, therefore Sambhogakaya gaze." Natural recognition is obscured by personality-identification.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "This practice isn't for my type"
- Missing that recognition transcends temperament
- Type-pride or type-shame about practice

**Cascade effects:**
<temperament-determinism> → <type-fixation> [personality category] → <practice-limitation> [type-appropriate methods] → <transcendent-recognition-miss> [type over nature]

---

[4728-4731] <btson-'grus-addiction> <diligence-pride>

**Misreading:**
The assignment of Nirmanakaya gaze to the diligent (*brtson 'grus can*) interpreted as valorization of effortful practice, creating pride in hard work and spiritual achievement-through-struggle.

**Why it arises:**
"Diligent" suggests virtue. Work ethic culture values effort. Protestant/workaholic mindset: effort = results. The practitioner prides themselves on diligence.

**Primary consequence:**
Effort-pride: "I am diligent, therefore advanced." Natural recognition is obscured by work-ethic.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Judgment of "lazy" practitioners
- Missing that recognition is effortless
- Burnout from excessive effort

**Cascade effects:**
<btson-'grus-addiction> → <effort-pride> [virtue of hard work] → <spiritual-workaholism> [achievement through struggle] → <effortless-recognition-miss> [work over being]

---

[4730-4731] <btang-snyoms-romanticization> <equanimity-spiritual-superiority>

**Misreading:**
The assignment of Dharmakaya gaze to the equanimous (*btang snyoms can*) interpreted as spiritual hierarchy where equanimity indicates advanced realization, creating elitism about "balanced" practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
"Equanimous" suggests spiritual maturity. Dharmakaya implies highest kaya. Hierarchical mindset: equanimity = advanced. The practitioner prides themselves on balance.

**Primary consequence:**
Equanimity-elitism: "I am balanced, therefore Dharmakaya-level." Natural recognition is obscured by spiritual status.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Affectation of equanimity as status-marker
- Missing that recognition is equally accessible
- Spiritual hierarchy based on temperament

**Cascade effects:**
<btang-snyoms-romanticization> → <equanimity-elitism> [spiritual maturity marker] → <affectation-pride> [status display] → <equal-access-miss> [hierarchy over nature]

---

[4732-4733] <etymological-essentialism> <nges-tshig-word-magic>

**Misreading:**
The etymological explanation of "gzigs" as "seeing Dharmata" and "stangs" as "liberating from samsara" interpreted as word-magic where knowing definitions produces understanding, creating dictionary-dependence.

**Why it arises:**
"Etymology" suggests meaning-containment. Word origins imply essence. Scholarly traditions emphasize philology. The practitioner thinks definitions = knowledge.

**Primary consequence:**
Etymological-essentialism: believing word-origins convey reality. Direct recognition is replaced by lexical knowledge.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I know what gzigs stangs really means"
- Missing that etymology points to experience
- Philological pride over direct seeing

**Cascade effects:**
<etymological-essentialism> → <word-magic> [definitions as power] → <dictionary-dependence> [lexical knowledge] → <experience-miss> [words over seeing]

---

[4734-4735] <phyi-dbyings-externalization> <external-sphere-objectification>

**Misreading:**
The "external sphere" (*phyi dbyings*) described as "sky-space empty of clouds" (*nam mkha' stong pa sprin dang bral ba*) interpreted as actual physical sky to observe, creating fixation on external environment.

**Why it arises:**
"External" suggests outside. "Sky" implies visible object. Nature-mysticism values external landscape. The practitioner looks at actual sky.

**Primary consequence:**
Environment-fixation: seeking external sky-space. Internal recognition is replaced by landscape-observation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to see a cloudless sky"
- Missing that external sphere indicates internal nature
- Weather-dependence for practice

**Cascade effects:**
<phyi-dbyings-externalization> → <environment-fixation> [external observation] → <landscape-obsession> [sky-gazing] → <internal-recognition-miss> [external over internal]

[4735-4736] <smin-mtshams-fetishism> <eyebrow-point-fixation>

**Misreading:**
The instruction to place attention at the eyebrow-point (*smin mtshams kyi mdzod spu*) interpreted as specific physical location to focus on, creating fixation on anatomical point.

**Why it arises:**
"Eyebrow-point" suggests location. "Place attention" implies focus. Concentration traditions emphasize focal points. The practitioner stares at eyebrow area.

**Primary consequence:**
Point-fixation: concentrating on eyebrow-location. Natural recognition is obscured by anatomical obsession.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Eye strain from upward gazing
- Missing that point indicates recognition, not causes it
- Physical discomfort from fixation

**Cascade effects:**
<smin-mtshams-fetishism> → <point-fixation> [anatomical location] → <concentration-anxiety> [holding focus] → <recognition-miss> [point over nature]

[4735-4736] <dbyings-snang-mthing-ga-attachment> <blue-field-visualization>

**Misreading:**
The "blue appearance of the sphere" (*dbyings snang mthing ga*) interpreted as specific blue visionary target to stabilize and maintain, creating fixation on blue color-experience.

**Why it arises:**
"Blue" suggests color to see. "Appearance" implies phenomenon. Visualization traditions stabilize on colors. The practitioner seeks blue field.

**Primary consequence:**
Color-fixation: obsession with blue appearance. Natural clarity is replaced by chromatic pursuit.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety about "losing" the blue
- Disappointment when blue doesn't appear
- Missing that blue is self-display of awareness

**Cascade effects:**
<dbyings-snang-mthing-ga-attachment> → <color-fixation> [blue obsession] → <stability-anxiety> [maintaining vision] → <natural-clarity-miss> [color over nature]

[4735-4736] <rnam-lnga-rang-gdangs-attachment> <five-phenomena-compartmentalization>

**Misreading:**
The "self-radiance of the five" (*rnam lnga'i rang gdangs*) interpreted as five distinct visionary phenomena to identify and catalog, creating taxonomic obsession about appearance-types.

**Why it arises:**
"Five" suggests list to master. "Self-radiance" implies special experiences. Scholarly mind catalogs phenomena. The practitioner inventories the five.

**Primary consequence:**
Phenomena-compartmentalization: treating five as separate things. Natural unity is obscured by classification.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I saw two of the five today"
- Missing that five are single display
- Cataloging visions rather than recognizing

**Cascade effects:**
<rnam-lnga-rang-gdangs-attachment> → <phenomena-compartmentalization> [separate items] → <vision-cataloging> [inventory of sights] → <unity-miss> [five as one]

---

[4737-4742] <thal-'gyur-citation-fetishism> <tantra-textual-dependence>

**Misreading:**
The citation from *Thal 'gyur* interpreted as scriptural proof establishing authority, creating dependence on textual validation from highest tantra.

**Why it arises:**
"From Thalgyur" suggests highest authority. Tantra implies esoteric proof. Religious dependence: "The highest text says so." The practitioner defers to tantric authority.

**Primary consequence:**
Tantric-dependence: seeking validation from highest source. Direct recognition is replaced by scriptural appeal.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "This is proven in Thalgyur" over direct seeing
- Missing that citation points to experience
- Hierarchical textual competition

**Cascade effects:**
<thal-'gyur-citation-fetishism> → <tantric-dependence> [highest authority] → <scriptural-competition> [textual hierarchy] → <experience-miss> [authority over seeing]

---

[4738] <sprin-bral-blankness-addiction> <cloudless-sky-void-fixation>

**Misreading:**
The "cloudless sky" (*sprin bral mkha'*) interpreted as void-state or blank consciousness to achieve, creating fixation on emptiness-as-absence.

**Why it arises:**
"Cloudless" suggests empty. "Sky" implies space. Meditation traditions value void states. The practitioner seeks blank mind.

**Primary consequence:**
Void-fixation: pursuing empty consciousness. Natural awareness is obscured by blank-state pursuit.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Clearing" mind of thoughts
- Missing that cloudless indicates unobstructed nature
- Nihilistic emptiness as goal

**Cascade effects:**
<sprin-bral-blankness-addiction> → <void-fixation> [empty state] → <thought-clearing> [mental vacuum] → <natural-awareness-miss> [blank over nature]

[4739-4740] <bag-rdul-dengs-purification> <dust-mist-cleansing>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "when dust-mist clears" (*bag rdul char gyis dengs dus su*) interpreted as gradual purification process where obstacles slowly dissipate, creating timeline-based approach.

**Why it arises:**
"Clears" suggests process. "Dust-mist" implies obstacles. Purification traditions emphasize gradual cleaning. The practitioner waits for clearing.

**Primary consequence:**
Gradual-purification: expecting obstacles to slowly clear. Immediate recognition is replaced by timeline-expectation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My dust hasn't cleared yet"
- Missing that clearing is immediate recognition
- Waiting for future clarity

**Cascade effects:**
<bag-rdul-dengs-purification> → <gradual-purification> [slow clearing] → <timeline-expectation> [waiting for clarity] → <immediate-recognition-miss> [future over now]

[4740-4741] <mkhas-pa-mngon-gsum-elitism> <direct-perception-mastery>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "the skilled directly perceive and strike the key point" (*mkhas pa mngon gsum gnad gzir*) interpreted as special direct-perception ability that masters achieve, creating elitism about "skilled" practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
"Skilled" suggests expertise. "Directly perceive" implies special faculty. Meritocratic mindset: skill = direct perception. The practitioner seeks mastery-status.

**Primary consequence:**
Skill-elitism: "I am skilled, therefore I perceive directly." Natural recognition is obscured by expertise-pride.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Discrimination against "unskilled" practitioners
- Missing that recognition is equally accessible
- Spiritual hierarchy based on perceived skill

**Cascade effects:**
<mkhas-pa-mngon-gsum-elitism> → <skill-elitism> [expertise hierarchy] → <direct-perception-pride> [mastery status] → <equal-recognition-miss> [skill over nature]

[4741-4742] <nang-sgron-lam-technique> <inner-lamp-path-method>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "make the inner lamp the path" (*nang gi sgron ma lam du bya'o*) interpreted as specific technique of inner light meditation to practice, creating method-obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Inner lamp" suggests method. "Make the path" implies technique. Light-meditation traditions value inner luminosity. The practitioner seeks inner lamp method.

**Primary consequence:**
Technique-fixation: treating inner lamp as practice method. Natural recognition is replaced by method-pursuit.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "How do I make the inner lamp?"
- Missing that inner lamp indicates awareness-nature
- Method-seeking over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<nang-sgron-lam-technique> → <technique-fixation> [method obsession] → <method-seeking> [how-to pursuit] → <recognition-miss> [technique over nature]

---

[4743-4744] <phyi-rig-'char-externalization> <external-awareness-arising>

**Misreading:**
The "external arising of awareness" (*phyi rig pa 'char ba*) interpreted as awareness manifesting outside oneself in external space, creating spatial dualism.

**Why it arises:**
"External" suggests outside. "Arising" implies manifestation. Spatial dualism: inner/outer. The practitioner looks for awareness outside.

**Primary consequence:**
Spatial-dualism: seeking awareness externally. Non-spatial recognition is replaced by inside/outside division.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Where is awareness arising?"
- Missing that external indicates non-dual display
- Geographic confusion about awareness-location

**Cascade effects:**
<phyi-rig-'char-externalization> → <spatial-dualism> [inside/outside] → <external-seeking> [looking outside] → <non-spatial-miss> [location over nature]

---

[4744-4745] <nang-nyams-'phel-internalization> <internal-experience-development>

**Misreading:**
The "internal development of experience" (*nang nyams 'phel ba*) interpreted as cultivating inner states or experiences, creating internal-state obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Internal" suggests inside. "Development" implies cultivation. Experience-based traditions value state-development. The practitioner works on inner experience.

**Primary consequence:**
State-cultivation: developing internal experiences. Natural recognition is replaced by experience-building.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My inner experience needs developing"
- Missing that experience is display, not possession
- Internal-state anxiety

**Cascade effects:**
<nang-nyams-'phel-internalization> → <state-cultivation> [experience building] → <internal-anxiety> [state monitoring] → <natural-display-miss> [cultivation over nature]

[4745] <rig-nyams-gnyis-med-confusion> <awareness-experience-non-dual-intellectualization>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "awareness and experience are non-dual" (*rig pa dang nyams gnyis su med pa*) interpreted as philosophical position about non-duality of subject and object, creating conceptual meditation on "no separation."

**Why it arises:**
"Non-dual" suggests philosophy. "Awareness and experience" implies categories. Non-dual traditions emphasize unity. The practitioner thinks about non-duality.

**Primary consequence:**
Conceptual-non-duality: "awareness and experience are one" as thought. Natural non-duality is replaced by philosophical position.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Intellectual pride: "I understand non-duality"
- Missing that non-duality is not position but nature

[4745] <khor-'das-'dres-pa-blending> <samsara-nirvana-mixing-technique>

**Misreading:**
The term "mixing of samsara and nirvana" (*'khor 'das 'dres pa*) interpreted as specific meditation technique of combining or equalizing opposites, creating method-based approach.

**Why it arises:**
"Mixing" suggests technique. "Samsara and nirvana" implies opposites. Tantric traditions value union practices. The practitioner seeks mixing-method.

**Primary consequence:**
Technique-mixing: treating union as practice method. Natural indivisibility is replaced by combining-effort.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "How do I mix samsara and nirvana?"
- Missing that indivisibility is nature, not technique
- Method-seeking for natural unity

**Cascade effects:**
<khor-'das-'dres-pa-blending> → <technique-mixing> [method approach] → <combining-effort> [union practice] → <natural-indivisibility-miss> [technique over nature]

[4746-4747] <sa-chu-me-rlung-materialization> <element-objectification>

**Misreading:**
The reference to earth, water, fire, wind (*sa chu me rlung*) interpreted as actual material elements to observe or work with, creating elemental-materialism.

**Why it arises:**
"Elements" suggests physical substances. Naming implies objectification. Elemental traditions work with earth/water/fire/air. The practitioner treats elements as objects.

**Primary consequence:**
Element-materialization: treating elements as external objects. Symbolic indications are replaced by literal substances.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to observe the elements"
- Missing that elements indicate qualities
- Literalism about symbolic language

**Cascade effects:**
<sa-chu-me-rlung-materialization> → <element-materialization> [external objects] → <literal-observation> [watching elements] → <symbolic-miss> [objects over indications]

[4746-4747] <rag-pa-yul-fixation> <coarse-object-focus>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "taking coarse objects as focal point" (*dngos po rag pa la yul du gtad pa*) interpreted as permission to focus on ordinary phenomena, creating permission for distraction.

**Why it arises:**
"Coarse objects" suggests ordinary things. "Focal point" implies attention. Permissive interpretation: "I can focus on anything." The practitioner justifies distraction.

**Primary consequence:**
Distraction-permission: using coarse objects as meditation subjects. Recognition is replaced by ordinary fixation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Everything is meditation" as excuse for distraction
- Missing that focal point indicates recognition, not any object
- Dilution of practice into ordinary mind

**Cascade effects:**
<rag-pa-yul-fixation> → <distraction-permission> [ordinary focus] → <dilution-excuse> [everything is practice] → <recognition-miss> [distraction over nature]

[4746-4751] <ma-grol-neglect-justification> <non-liberation-permission>

**Misreading:**
The statement that focusing on coarse elements "does not liberate" (*mi grol*) interpreted as acknowledging some practices don't work, creating hierarchy where some methods are "ineffective" rather than understanding why.

**Why it arises:**
"Does not liberate" suggests failure. Comparison implies hierarchy. Method-evaluation mindset: some work, some don't. The practitioner seeks "effective" methods.

**Primary consequence:**
Method-hierarchy: categorizing practices as liberating/non-liberating. Natural recognition is obscured by technique-evaluation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Those practices don't work"
- Missing that non-liberation indicates wrong approach, not wrong method
- Arrogance about "correct" practice

**Cascade effects:**
<ma-grol-neglect-justification> → <method-hierarchy> [effective vs ineffective] → <technique-evaluation> [practice comparison] → <recognition-miss> [method over nature]
