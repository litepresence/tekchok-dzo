<svasamvedana-reification> <self-awareness-substantialism>
**Misreading:**
The presentation of self-awareness (so so rang rig) and primordial wisdom (ye shes) is interpreted as establishing a truly existing knowing essence—the ultimate nature of mind that exists in itself.

**Why it arises:**
The terminology suggests something real: "self-awareness" implies a self that is aware; "wisdom" suggests a positive quality. The phrase "naturally empty of essence" seems to describe something that exists.

**Primary consequence:**
Awareness is reified into an ultimate existent—the "true nature" that remains when all else is seen as empty. This becomes the new self.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dzogchen is understood as recognizing this "awareness essence." Practitioners try to "rest in awareness" as if it were a thing to abide in.

**Cascade effects:**
<awareness-identification> (identifying with rigpa), <awareness-reification> (making awareness a thing), <essence-search> (looking for true nature).

<illusion-as-ultimate> <maya-eternalism>
**Misreading:**
The "illusion as ultimate" position (sgyu ma don dam du 'dod pa) is interpreted as meaning that while conventional phenomena are empty, the appearance-aspect of illusion is itself the ultimate truth.

**Why it arises:**
The position name suggests that illusion is ultimate. The comparison to illusion seems to elevate appearance to ultimate status. The Middle Way's emptiness appears nihilistic by comparison.

**Primary consequence:**
Appearance is reified as ultimate. The empty nature of appearance itself is missed as practitioners grasp at the clarity-aspect.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dzogchen becomes a celebration of appearance without recognizing its emptiness. The non-duality of appearance-emptiness collapses into eternalism.

**Cascade effects:**
<appearance-eternalism> (grasping at clarity), <illusion-reification> (making illusion real), <clearlight-fixation> (clinging to luminous aspect).

<non-abiding-nihilism> <apratisthana-misunderstanding>
**Misreading:**
The "non-abiding" position (rab tu mi gnas pa) is interpreted as total nihilism—nothing exists, nothing matters, no position is valid.

**Why it arises:**
"Non-abiding" suggests not resting anywhere. The rejection of all positions sounds like skepticism. Nihilistic tendencies find confirmation.

**Primary consequence:**
Complete rejection of all views becomes a view itself. The middle way between existence and non-existence is missed as practitioners fall into extreme negation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Depression, apathy, or irresponsible behavior result from "nothing matters." The positive, luminous aspect of emptiness is completely missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<extreme-negation> (denying everything), <nihilistic-view> (nothing exists), <irresponsibility> (no consequences for actions).
