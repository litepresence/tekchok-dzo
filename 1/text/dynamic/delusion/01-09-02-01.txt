<narrative-error> [ORIGIN STORY AS LITERAL HISTORY]
**Misreading:**
The narrative of Vajrasattva's delusion is interpreted as literal historical account of "how things went wrong" at the beginning of time, treating the story as factual description of cosmic events.

**Why it arises:**
Literalist habit. Western readers approaching scripture as factual history apply same hermeneutic to Dzogchen myth. The specific details (Pig Year, Sun called Created) invite concrete interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
Missing that narrative is pedagogical device. The practitioner searches for "what really happened" , avoiding recognizing present structure of delusion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Temporal projection of delusion ("it started then"); cosmological speculation; missing immediacy of own delusion pattern.

**Cascade effects:**
<time-error> through temporalizing timeless delusion.
<fundamental-delusion> through not recognizing present pattern.

<doctrinal-confusion> [VAJRASATTVA AS ACTUAL BEING]
**Misreading:**
Vajrasattva is interpreted as actual primordial being who "fell" from enlightenment into delusion, treating the Pure Buddha and Vajrasattva as sequential historical figures.

**Why it arises:**
Personification reflex. Abstract principles (ground, awareness) are concretized into characters in drama. "Vajrasattva" sounds like name of first deluded being.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying narrative figures. The practitioner imagines actual entity "Vajrasattva" excluding recognizing own awareness-nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Externalizing delusion origin ("someone else fell first"); cosmic drama obsession; missing that "Vajrasattva" points to own nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<self-grasping> through identifying with separate deluder.
<fundamental-delusion> through externalizing delusion source.

<symbolic-misinterpretation> [EIGHT CONDITIONS AS REQUIREMENTS]
**Misreading:**
The eight specific conditions of delusion (field, place, time, year, day, star, name, lineage) are interpreted as requirements that must be present for delusion to occur, or as cosmological elements to study.

**Why it arises:**
List-compulsion. Enumeration suggests completeness and systematicity. Readers want to understand the "mechanism" through these eight factors.

**Primary consequence:**
Making delusion conditional and complex. The practitioner studies conditions simple non-recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Astrological obsession (year, day, star); geomantic fixation (field, place); nominal superstition (name, lineage).

**Cascade effects:**
<magical-thinking> through condition-fetishism.
<intellectualism> through studying yet not to recognizing.

<cosmological-error> [FIELD AND PLACE AS REAL LOCATIONS]
**Misreading:**
"Field called Broad" (yul yangs pa can) and "Place called Beautiful" (gnas mdzes ldan) are interpreted as actual geographical or metaphysical locations where delusion began.

**Why it arises:**
Spatial literalism. Descriptive epithets are taken as proper names of places. "Broad" and "Beautiful" suggest specific spatial qualities of delusion-ground.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying space of delusion. The practitioner imagines literal "place" where delusion occurred, spatializing what is no-place.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pilgrimage desires; pure land obsession; spatial dualism of "delusion place" vs "awakening place."

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-reification> through spatializing basis.
<attachment> through seeking special places.

---

<temporal-misreading> [TIME MARKERS AS HISTORICAL DATING]
**Misreading:**
The time references ("when destruction occurs," "Pig Year," "Sun called Created," "Star Bird") are interpreted as astrological or calendrical dating of the "event" of delusion.

**Why it arises:**
Chronological compulsion. Specific temporal markers invite dating. "Pig Year" and "Star Bird" sound like zodiacal references suggesting cosmic timing.

**Primary consequence:**
Temporalizing timeless process. The practitioner thinks delusion began at specific astrological moment rather than than being atemporal pattern.

**Secondary consequences:**
Astrological dependency; "good/bad" time superstition; temporal anxiety about "when" delusion occurred.

**Cascade effects:**
<time-error> through dating timelessness.
<magical-thinking> through astrological determinism.

---

<identity-error> [NAME AND LINEAGE AS ACTUAL IDENTITY]
**Misreading:**
"Old One Who Possesses a Heap" (rgan po ling tog can) and "indeterminate lineage" are interpreted as actual name and clan of first deluded being, suggesting identity-amnesia as delusion mechanism.

**Why it arises:**
Identity fascination. The idea of forgetting one's true name/resonates with spiritual amnesia themes. Sounds like "fall from identity" narrative.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying identity-loss. The practitioner thinks delusion involves forgetting "who I really am" as Vajrasattva.

**Secondary consequences:**
Identity-recovery projects; "finding true name" obsessions; past-life regression as recovery method.

**Cascade effects:**
<self-grasping> through identity-recovery.
<fundamental-delusion> through amnesia-model of ignorance.

---

<allegorical-misinterpretation> [COMPANIONS AND ARMIES AS PSYCHOLOGICAL FORCES]
**Misreading:**
The progression from four friends → five wild-men → back-support → thief → accumulator → armies is interpreted as allegory for psychological forces or ego-development stages.

**Why it arises:**
Psychological projection. Modern readers automatically psychologize myth. Progression suggests developmental psychology model.

**Primary consequence:**
Reducing narrative to psychology. The practitioner maps symbols to mental states rather than than recognizing direct pointing.

**Secondary consequences:**
Jungian/archetypal analysis; developmental stage theories; psychological interpretation replacing recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<intellectualism> through interpretive analysis.
<practice-path-confusion> through therapeutic approach.

---

<teleological-error> [DELUSION AS PURPOSEFUL PROCESS]
**Misreading:**
"That arises from the basis that possesses no delusion" is interpreted as teleological statement that delusion serves purpose, is meaningful development, or represents necessary fall for subsequent awakening.

**Why it arises:**
Meaning-making compulsion. "Arises from basis without delusion" sounds like cosmic plan or benevolent fall narrative. Cannot accept meaninglessness.

**Primary consequence:**
Justifying delusion as necessary. The practitioner believes samsara serves purpose, is classroom for soul, or required for realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual bypassing ("delusion is perfect"); complacency about liberation; romanticizing ignorance as wisdom-in-disguise.

**Cascade effects:**
<eternalistic-error> through benevolent universe myth.
<practice-path-confusion> through purpose-seeking.
