[15778-15781] <pedagogical-error> [EFFORTLESS APPROPRIATION]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between effortful (rtsol bcas) and effortless (rtsol med) systems is a hierarchical progression from lower to higher.

**Why it arises:**
Natural assumption that "effortless" is superior. Common marketing of "direct path" over gradual methods.

**Primary consequence:**
Premature abandonment of effortful preliminary practices.

**Secondary consequences:**
Lack of foundation for recognizing effortless state.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[15782-15789] <ontological-error> [BINDU SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The bindu (thig le) is a physical substance or energetic particle that can be manipulated through technique.

**Why it arises:**
Descriptions use physical language ("hold," "reverse," "drop"). Modern subtle-body discourse conflates symbol with physiology.

**Primary consequence:**
Treating thigle practices as bioenergetic manipulation rather than recognition of nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fixation on sensation and localized experience.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[15790-15797] <practice-error> [POSTURAL LITERALISM]
**Misreading:**
Specific sitting postures ('dug stangs) and gazes (gzigs stangs) mechanically produce realization.

**Why it arises:**
Prescriptive language suggests causality. Physical interventions offer tangible handles.

**Primary consequence:**
Obsession with correct posture over recognition of nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Body tension and fixation on form.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<practice-error> distracts from direct pointing.

[15798-15805] <epistemic-error> [VERSE ONTOLOGIZATION]
**Misreading:**
Poetic verse citations (mu tig phreng ba las) assert literal anatomical and metaphysical truths.

**Why it arises:**
Canonical authority of quotations. Beautiful language taken as descriptive fact.

**Primary consequence:**
System-building around poetic images.

**Secondary consequences:**
Elaborate symbolic interpretation disconnected from direct recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<scholarly-collapse-error>.

[15806-15817] <ontological-error> [THREE PARTS SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The three parts (right, left, center) of the bindu correspond to literal physical locations in the body.

**Why it arises:**
Anatomical language (ro ma, rkyang ma, dbu ma) suggests physical channels.

**Primary consequence:**
Mapping bindu locations onto Western anatomical structures.

**Secondary consequences:**
Disappointment when physical manipulation fails to produce realization.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[15818-15829] <pedagogical-error> [METHOD-WISDOM DUALITY]
**Misreading:**
Father-mother (yab yum) union of method and wisdom is a literal sexual practice or energy exchange.

**Why it arises:**
Sexual symbolism invites literalization. Karmamudra traditions exist in parallel.

**Primary consequence:**
Confusing symbolic union with physical or energetic technique.

**Secondary consequences:**
Moral confusion or fixation on sexual methods.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[15830-15841] <reification-error> [DHARMAKAYA BINDU LOCATION]
**Misreading:**
The dharmakaya bindu in the center is an actual place or container where something resides.

**Why it arises:**
Spatial language ("dwells," "center," "basis") suggests location.

**Primary consequence:**
Searching for bindu as object of meditation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that "center" is metaphor for non-dual nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<meditationism-error>.

[15842-15854] <epistemic-error> [GRADUALISM MISATTRIBUTION]
**Misreading:**
The progression from relative to ultimate bindu is a gradual cultivation path requiring time.

**Why it arises:**
Sequential presentation implies temporal process. Ordinary cognition requires time.

**Primary consequence:**
Approaching recognition as achievement to be developed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferral of present recognition to future attainment.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[15855-15868] <ontological-error> [LIGHT AS PHENOMENON]
**Misreading:**
The clear light ('od gsal) is a visible light phenomenon or altered state of consciousness.

**Why it arises:**
"Light" language invites visual interpretation. Meditation experiences produce luminosity.

**Primary consequence:**
Cultivating light experiences as goal.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fixation on signs (mtshan ma) rather than nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] confused for [DZOGCHEN VIEW].

[15869-15882] <practice-error> [LAMP MANIPULATION]
**Misreading:**
The four lamps (sgro ma bzhi) are objects to be cultivated or intensified.

**Why it arises:**
"Blazing" (bar ba) and "lamp" suggest active process. Effort-based conditioning.

**Primary consequence:**
Attempting to create or improve lamp experiences.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that lamps are self-arising display of nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[15883-15896] <ontological-error> [BARDO SPATIALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
The bardo (bar do) is a literal intermediate state or place between death and rebirth.

**Why it arises:**
"Intermediate" (bar) suggests spatial/temporal between-state. Popular Buddhist discourse.

**Primary consequence:**
Anxiety about navigating post-death geography.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that bardo is present moment of not recognizing.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[15897-15911] <epistemic-error> [APPEARANCE-EMPTINESS DUALITY]
**Misreading:**
Appearance and emptiness are two aspects that need to be combined or unified.

**Why it arises:**
Grammar of "union" (zung 'jug) suggests two things joining.

**Primary consequence:**
Intellectual synthesis project rather than direct recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Endless philosophical elaboration.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<scholarly-collapse-error>.

[15912-15926] <pedagogical-error> [SIX LOCUS LITERALISM]
**Misreading:**
The six loci ('khor lo drug) are fixed anatomical locations for specific energies.

**Why it arises:**
Anatomical mapping satisfies desire for concrete reference points.

**Primary consequence:**
Rigid fixation on channel locations.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that loci are pedagogical pointers, not geography.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[15927-15937] <reification-error> [CHANNEL SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**

**Primary consequence:**
Physical manipulation of posture and breath to "open" channels.

**Secondary consequences:**
Tension and strain seeking energetic flow.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[15938-15949] <ontological-error> [WIND AS ENTITY]
**Misreading:**
Winds (rlung) are actual moving energies or forces within the body.

**Why it arises:**
Respiratory and energetic sensations seem to move. Physics uses "wind" metaphorically.

**Primary consequence:**
Wind-control practices as end in themselves.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that winds are movements of mind.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] fixation.

[15950-15961] <pedagogical-error> [CAUSAL INVERSION]
**Misreading:**
The bindu causes or produces the clear light as an effect.

**Why it arises:**
Sequential description implies causality. Ordinary logic requires causes.

**Primary consequence:**
Seeking to produce clear light through bindu manipulation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Causal framework obscures spontaneous presence.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[SUTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW] applied to [DZOGCHEN VIEW].

[15962-15974] <practice-error> [MINDFULNESS FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
Mindfulness (dran pa) and introspection (shes bzhin) are states to be cultivated and maintained.

**Why it arises:**
Conventional meditation instruction emphasizes mindfulness.

**Primary consequence:**

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that natural awareness is prior to mindfulness.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[SUTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW] mistaken for [DZOGCHEN VIEW].

[15975-15987] <epistemic-error> [CONVENTIONAL-ULTIMATE CONFUSION]

Conventional (kun rdzob) and ultimate (don dam) are two different realities or levels.

**Why it arises:**
Two-truth framework deeply embedded in Buddhist thought.

**Primary consequence:**
Privileging "ultimate" over "conventional" experience.

**Secondary consequences:**
Devaluing everyday perception or seeking special states.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[15988-16000] <ontological-error> [PURE VISION SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
Pure perception (dag snang) means seeing things as actually pure rather than impure.

**Why it arises:**
"Pure" suggests evaluative hierarchy. Visualization practices train this.

**Primary consequence:**
Cultivating positive interpretations as spiritual progress.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual bypassing of difficult experiences.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
[16001-16014] <reification-error> [SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE]
**Misreading:**
Spontaneous presence (lhun grub) is an automatic result that happens without effort.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous" suggests ease. Effort-fatigue seeks effortless alternatives.

**Primary consequence:**
Passive waiting for realization to occur.

**Secondary consequences:**
Avoiding necessary engagement with recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<nihilistic-error> "nothing to do."

[16015-16024] <pedagogical-error> [PRIMORDIAL PURITY OBSCURATION]
**Misreading:**
Primordial purity (ka dag) means inherently pure so no need for recognition or practice.

**Why it arises:**
Logical inference from "already pure." Anti-effort movements.

**Primary consequence:**
Dismissal of path and practice as unnecessary.
