<guardian-deity-dependence> <protective-externalization>
**Misreading:**
The Four Great Kings (*'phags skyes po*, etc.) interpreted as actual protective deities who guard practitioners and directions—external powers to rely upon.

**Why it arises:**
"Guardian" suggests protection. Directional symbolism is universal. Fear seeks external security.

**Primary consequence:**
Dharma practice congeals into seeking divine protection. Kings are worshipped for safety. Self-reliance is abandoned.

**Secondary consequences:**
Rituals for invoking guardians proliferate. Fear of "unprotected" directions. The natural protection of awareness is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<guardian-worship> → deity reliance
<directional-fear> → unprotected quarters
<external-protection> → seeking safety outside
<ritual-security> → ceremonies for protection

<solar-lunar-palace-fetish> <celestial-tourism>
**Misreading:**
The elaborate descriptions of Sun and Moon palaces (51 yojanas, fire-crystal base, etc.) interpreted as literal destinations to visit or be reborn in—cosmic luxury resorts.

**Why it arises:**
Specific measurements create tangibility. "Palace" suggests opulence. Celestial residences appeal to desire.

**Primary consequence:**
Sun/Moon become rebirth goals. Practitioners visualize palaces to manifest them. The empty nature of light is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Astronomical bodies are personified. Solar/lunar worship develops. Natural phenomena are replaced by palace-fantasies.

**Cascade effects:**
<celestial-palace-obsession> → seeking sun/moon residence
<light-reification> → palaces instead of luminosity
<astronomical-fetishism> → worshipping planets
<rebirth-aspiration> → wanting celestial birth

[1023-1034]
<indra-kingship> <divine-monarchy>
**Misreading:**
Indra (*dbang po*) as king of gods interpreted as confirming divine monarchy—hierarchical power structure to be revered or emulated.

**Why it arises:**
"King" suggests sovereignty. Thirty-three gods resemble court. Monarchical structures feel natural.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual hierarchy is projected onto cosmos. Indra's rule congeals into model for human hierarchy. Democratic/egalitarian insights are lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Indra worship develops. Spiritual teachers claim "Indra-like" authority. The non-hierarchical nature of awareness is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
<divine-monarchism> → hierarchical cosmos
<indra-cult> → worshipping celestial king
<authority-projection> → king as spiritual model
<hierarchical-spirituality> → ranking by divine proximity

[1035-1046]
<measurement-precisism> <cosmic-geometry>
**Misreading:**
The specific measurements (150 yojanas, 4500 yojanas, 80,000 leagues) interpreted as establishing precise cosmic scale—Buddhist equivalent of astronomical distances.

**Why it arises:**
Numbers create authority. Precision suggests knowledge. "Leagues" and "yojanas" sound scientific.

**Primary consequence:**
Cosmology congeals into quantified geography. The immeasurable nature of awareness solidifies as calculable dimensions.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners memorize cosmic measurements. Comparisons with modern astronomy ensue. The metaphorical function is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<cosmic-calculation> → measuring universe
<numerical-authority> → numbers as truth
<scientific-comparison> → Buddhism vs. physics
<quantification-obsession> → counting the infinite

[1047-1058]

**Misreading:**
The four pleasure groves (*skyed mos tshal*) with specific characteristics interpreted as literal paradises—ideal vacation destinations to aspire to.

**Why it arises:**
"Wish-fulfilling" suggests magic. Specific measurements create tangibility. Trees are universally symbolic.

**Primary consequence:**
The tree petrifies into object-producer. Practitioners seek "wish-fulfillment" through tree meditation. Desire is indulged, not recognized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual materialism intensifies. "Get what I want" congeals into practice. The empty nature of desire and fulfillment is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<wish-tree-worship> → venerating cosmic tree
<desire-gratification> → getting what I want
<arbor-fetishism> → tree as provider
<materialization-magic> → manifesting objects

<formless-samadhi-addiction> <blankness-chasing>
**Misreading:**
The formless realm attainments (*gzugs med khams*)—infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception—interpreted as advanced meditation goals to achieve through effort.

**Why it arises:**
"Formless" sounds superior. "Infinite" suggests profundity. The four attainments appear progressive.

**Primary consequence:**
Formlessness solidifies as special state. Meditation congeals into blankness-seeking. Recognition is confused with absence.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners chase void-experiences. "Nothingness" congeals into something to get. The natural clarity is obscured by seeking blankness.

**Cascade effects:**

**Misreading:**
The "existence-nonexistence" (*yod min med min*) realms interpreted as describing actual ontological categories—beings who both exist and don't exist simultaneously.

**Why it arises:**
Paradox invites interpretation. "Neither exist nor not exist" sounds like quantum physics. Ontological speculation appeals.

**Primary consequence:**
Cosmology congeals into quantum mysticism. Practitioners try to "be neither existent nor nonexistent." The pedagogical point is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Confusion over "what they actually are." Philosophical debates about existence-status. The empty nature of all categories is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<quantum-mysticism> → Buddhism as physics

**Misreading:**
The hierarchy of formless realms (infinite space → infinite consciousness → nothingness → neither-nor) interpreted as ladder to climb—higher is better, more advanced.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchy feels natural. "Higher" suggests superiority. Progressive development is expected.

**Primary consequence:**
Formless attainments are moralized into stages. Practitioners compete over "how high." The equality of all appearances is missed.

**Misreading:**
The "peaceful samadhi" (*ting nge 'dzin zhi ba*) interpreted as ultimate goal—blissful tranquility as highest achievement.

**Why it arises:**
"Peaceful" sounds desirable. "Bliss" appeals to pleasure. Tranquility contrasts with worldly stress.

**Primary consequence:**
Samadhi solidifies as blissful state. Practitioners seek peaceful experiences. The dynamic clarity is replaced by tranquil dullness.

**Why it arises:**
"Body" suggests entity. "Emanation" implies production. Typology invites categorization.

**Primary consequence:**
Emanation petrifies into body-type. Practitioners study "three bodies" as metaphysics. The empty display is replaced by ontological classification.

**Secondary consequences:**
Body-ontology debates ensue. "Which body am I experiencing?" congeals into obsession. The seamless nature is fragmented.

**Cascade effects:**
<body-typology> → categorizing forms
<emanation-ontology> → bodies as real
