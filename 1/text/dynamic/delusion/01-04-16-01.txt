[3766-3769] <ontological-error> [VIEW AS OBJECT]
**Misreading:**
The phrase "essence is seeing, naturally pure" is interpreted as establishing view (lta ba) as perceptual object that can be seen, like looking at something.

**Why it arises:**
Visual metaphor confusion. "Seeing" suggests object of perception. The mind reifies view as something to look at.

**Primary consequence:**
Objectifying view. The practitioner tries to "see" the view as if it were an object of perception.

**Secondary consequences:**
Seeking visionary experiences; confusing view with visual perception; missing that view is how one sees, not what is seen.

**Cascade effects:**
<experience-substantialism> through seeking visual view.
<subject-object-dualism> through objectifying view.

[3770-3778] <expanse-reification> [OCEAN EXPANSE AS LOCATION]
**Misreading:**
The description of "ocean expanse" (rgya mtsho'i klong) is interpreted as establishing literal expanse or space that is vast like the ocean—a metaphysical location or container.

**Why it arises:**
Spatial metaphor literalism. "Expanse" suggests extended space. Ocean metaphor invites spatial imagination.

**Primary consequence:**
Making klong into place. The practitioner believes there is an "expanse" that is vast and contains everything.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spatialized view of mind; container-theory of awareness; seeking "vast expanse" as experience.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through spatializing klong.
<experience-substantialism> through seeking vastness.

[3772-3774] <extreme-error> [ETERNALIST EXTREME SELF-LIBERATED]
**Misreading:**
"Eternalist extreme self-liberated" is interpreted as establishing that eternalism is inherently liberated or acceptable, rather than recognizing it as reference point that self-liberates when not grasped.

**Why it arises:**
Partial reading. "Self-liberated" sounds positive. Missing that liberation refers to grasping-release, not validation of extreme.

**Primary consequence:**
Validating eternalism. The practitioner believes eternalistic views are "already liberated" and therefore acceptable.

**Secondary consequences:**
Extreme-view adoption; "all views are liberated" as license for any position; missing that liberation is from grasping, not of view itself.

**Cascade effects:**
<extreme-view> through validating extremes.
<view-attachment> through "liberated view" license.

[3778-3782] <sky-ocean-dualism> [TWO EXPANSES AS HIERARCHY]
**Misreading:**
The two expanse analogy (ocean expanse vs. sky expanse) is interpreted as establishing hierarchy or two-tier system, with one being "higher" than the other.

**Why it arises:**
Comparative thinking. Two items invite comparison. "Greater/smaller" distinction in text suggests ranking.

**Primary consequence:**
Seeking "greater expanse." The practitioner believes they should aim for "ocean expanse" rather than "sky expanse" (or vice versa).

**Secondary consequences:**
Expanse-comparison; hierarchical view of spatial metaphors; missing that both point to same non-spatial nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<spatial-reification> through comparing metaphors.
<hierarchical-thinking> through expanse-ranking.

[3783-3786] <reference-purification> [DEPENDENCE PURE AS ACHIEVEMENT]
**Misreading:**
"Dependence self-purifies, mind is stainless" is interpreted as establishing that purification has occurred or can be achieved, creating complacency about "already pure" nature.

**Why it arises:**
Purification language. "Stainless" suggests achieved state. Past tense "self-purified" invites completion-reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Purification-complex. The practitioner believes they are "already pure" and need do nothing, or seeks to "maintain" purity.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual complacency; purification-anxiety; missing that self-purification is absence of impurity, not achieved state.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-complacency> through purity-claim.
<eternalistic-error> through reifying purity.

[3787-3805] <analogical-overload> [EXPANSE ANALOGIES AS ONTOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The multiple expanse analogies (ocean, sky, greater, lesser) are interpreted as establishing complex ontology of mind with multiple dimensions or levels.

**Why it arises:**
System-building reflex. Multiple analogies suggest system. Wanting comprehensive map of "expanse theory."

**Primary consequence:**
Expanse-system building. The practitioner believes Dzogchen teaches elaborate "expanse doctrine" with various types.

**Secondary consequences:**
Typology-creation; missing that analogies are pedagogical tools, not ontological claims; scholastic categorization.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through systematizing metaphors.
<intellectualism> through expanse-typology.
