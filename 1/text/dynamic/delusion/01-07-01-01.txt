[9704-9705] [VIEW ERROR] [VISIONARY OBSESSION]
**Misreading:**
Reader adopts Four lamps - lamp of self-arisen wisdom as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Four lamps - lamp of self-arisen wisdom is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Conceptual pride replaces genuine recognition. Debates about positions poison communities. The intellect is fetishized over wisdom.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <ground-path-fruition temporalization>. View becomes position rather than recognition.

[9706-9712] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [STAGE HIERARCHY]
**Misreading:**
Reader interprets Four lamps - lamp of self-arisen wisdom through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.

**Why it arises:**

**Misreading:**
Reader understands Four lamps - lamp of self-arisen wisdom as a stage in a developmental sequence, deferring completion until prerequisites are met.

**Why it arises:**
Achievement-oriented psychology and hierarchical social structures impose staircase models. The desire for measurable advancement supports stage-fixation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Four lamps - lamp of self-arisen wisdom is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.

**Secondary consequences:**
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <experience substantialism>. Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.
