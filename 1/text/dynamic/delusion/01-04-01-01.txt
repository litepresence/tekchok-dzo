[2930-2945] <linguistic-reification> [SOUND-LETTER CORRESPONDENCE]
**Misreading:**
The correspondence between Sanskrit sounds and their effects (A produces clarity, I produces emptiness, etc.) interpreted as establishing sound-magic where specific phonemes mechanically produce specific results.

**Why it arises:**
Sound symbolism is real in linguistics. Mantra traditions emphasize syllable power. The systematic correspondence suggests causality.

**Primary consequence:**
Phoneme-fetishism. The practitioner believes saying "A" automatically produces clarity regardless of recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Sanskrit pronunciation obsession; missing that sounds point to recognition, not cause it; literal mantra mechanics.

**Cascade effects:**
<mantra-mechanism> through sound-causality.
<pronunciation-obsession> through phonetic literalism.

[2946-2960] <ayurvedic-reduction> [MEDICINE AS ONTOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The three humors (wind, bile, phlegm) and seven elements (flesh, blood, etc.) interpreted as comprehensive ontology of human being—medical materialism.

**Why it arises:**
Ayurveda is sophisticated medical system. The enumeration suggests completeness. Health focus supports medicalization.

**Primary consequence:**
Medical materialism. The practitioner reduces spiritual path to physical health optimization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Wellness obsession; diet fixation; missing that humors are metaphors for energetic patterns.

**Cascade effects:**
<somatic-reductionism> through medicalization.
<health-fetishism> through wellness obsession.

[2961-2975] <cosmic-physiology> [MACRO-MICRO CORRESPONDENCE]
**Misreading:**
The correspondence between microcosm (body elements) and macrocosm (world elements) interpreted as establishing literal physical connection between body and universe.

**Why it arises:**
Correspondence theory is philosophically valid. "As above, so below" appeals to holism. The isomorphism suggests identity.

**Primary consequence:**
Physical correspondence literalism. The practitioner believes body literally mirrors cosmos structurally.

**Secondary consequences:**
Cosmic body-obsession; astrological determinism; missing that correspondence is symbolic, not mechanical.

**Cascade effects:**
<astrological-determinism> through cosmic correspondence.
<structural-literalism> through macro-micro identity.

[2976-2982] <elemental-essentialism> [FIVE ELEMENTS AS SUBSTANCE]
**Misreading:**
The five elements (earth, water, fire, air, space) interpreted as fundamental substances composing all matter—elemental reductionism.

**Why it arises:**
Elemental theories exist in many traditions. The enumeration suggests primitive physics. Modern chemistry seems to supersede.

**Primary consequence:**
Elemental substantialism. The practitioner believes everything is "really" made of five elements.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pre-scientific literalism; dismissal as primitive; missing that elements describe experiential qualities.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through element-substantialism.
<scientific-dismissal> through physics-comparison.
