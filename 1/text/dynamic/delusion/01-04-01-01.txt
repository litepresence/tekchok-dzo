[1902-1917]
<numerical-obsession> [360 VIEWS AS CATALOG]
**Misreading:**
The "360 views" (sum brgya drug cu) is interpreted as establishing a precise inventory of wrong positions to be memorized, catalogued, and refuted point-by-point.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration suggests systematicity. "360" implies comprehensiveness. Cataloging impulse. Competitive hermeneutics.

**Primary consequence:**
Doxography becomes intellectual accumulation. The practitioner memorizes view-taxonomies without recognizing how their own mind fixates.

**Secondary consequences:**
Scholastic pride in knowing all 360. The living recognition of fixation patterns replaced by academic classification.

**Cascade effects:**
<catalog-compulsion> → <intellectual-pride> → <scholastic-obsession> → <living-inquiry-death>

[1918-1933]
<self-reification> [SAMKHYA SELF AS SUBSTANCE]
**Misreading:**
Samkhya's "self" (bdag) described as possessing three qualities (rdul, mun pa, snying stobs—literally "dust, darkness, power/essence") is interpreted as confirming the existence of a substantial, permanent soul or atman.

**Why it arises:**
"Self" triggers atman associations. "Permanent" suggests substance. Three qualities imply composition. The thumb-sized spatial description reinforces entity-view.

**Cognitive layer:** Inherent self-grasping projects substantiality onto any self-language.
**Cultural layer:** Hindu atman-doctrine familiarity. Western soul-concepts.
**Historical layer:** Samkhya-Vedanta synthesis traditions.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Samkhya describes genuine meditative experience (subtle mind access) but reifies it as permanent self is entirely missed. The distinction between coarse and subtle self-grasping is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Belief in "discovering true self." Self-recovery projects. Amnesia-model of ignorance. Confusion between rejection of Samkhya and denial of experience.

**Cascade effects:**
<self-reification> → <atman-projection> → <subtle-grasping> → <experience-denial>

**Safety-critical:** Risk of rejecting all self-language, missing Dzogchen's rang rig (self-aware wisdom) distinction.

[1934-1949]
<spatial-self-literalism> [THUMB-SIZED SOUL AS ANATOMY]
**Misreading:**
The description of self as "thumb-sized" (mthe bong tsam) in heart, or sesame-seed sized, or mustard-seed sized is interpreted as establishing the soul's literal physical dimensions—claiming the self has measurable size.

**Why it arises:**
Specific measurements invite literalization. "Thumb-sized" suggests anatomical location. Desires concrete soul-entity.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking size-descriptions as ontological claims. The practitioner believes there is literally a "thumb-sized me" inside the heart.

**Secondary consequences:**
Metaphysical speculation about soul-dimensions. Meditation on heart-center to "find self." Confusion when "self" can't be objectively located.

**Cascade effects:**
<spatial-literalism> → <anatomical-self> → <meditation-obsession> → <location-anxiety>

---

[1950-1965]
<guna-essentialism> [THREE QUALITIES AS COMPONENTS]
**Misreading:**
The three gunas (rdul, mun pa, snying stobs—roughly: inertia/darkness, activity/passion, clarity/goodness) are interpreted as three fundamental components composing both self and matter.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests building blocks. Component-view natural to analysis. Ayurvedic parallels.

**Primary consequence:**
Gunas substantialized into ingredients. The practitioner believes everything is "made of" these three qualities.

**Secondary consequences:**
Guna-balance obsession. Ayurvedic reduction. Missing that gunas describe experiential patterns, not substances.

**Cascade effects:**
<guna-essentialism> → <component-analysis> → <experiential-reduction> → <substantialism>

---

[1966-1981]
<liberation-literalism> [PURE SELF ABOVE AS DESTINATION]
**Misreading:**
Liberation described as "self appearing above like white canopy surrounded" interpreted as establishing actual spatial location—liberated self goes "up there" to dwell above.

**Why it arises:**
"Above" suggests vertical transcendence. Spatial metaphors dominate. Heaven-paradigm projection.

**Primary consequence:**
Liberation spatialized as destination. The practitioner believes enlightenment means "going up" to dwell in pure realm.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ascension-fantasies. Spatial hierarchy. Present circumstances devalued. Future-dependency.

**Cascade effects:**
<spatial-liberation> → <destination-obsession> → <vertical-hierarchy> → <present-devaluation>

---

[1982-1997]
<self-cognition-mysticism> [SELF-KNOWING AS PROOF]
**Misreading:**
"Its nature knows itself" (de'i rang bzhin rang gis rig) interpreted as establishing self-cognition as proof of eternal soul—awareness of self demonstrates permanent self-nature.

**Why it arises:**
Self-awareness seems to require self. "Knowing itself" suggests reflexivity proves existence. Cartesian cogito echoes.

**Primary consequence:**
Samkhya self-cognition conflated with Dzogchen rang ngo shes (self-recognition). The reified self-knowing of Samkhya mistaken for rigpa.

**Secondary consequences:**
Confusion between reified self-knowing and empty self-awareness. Subtle atman-view dressed in Dzogchen vocabulary.

**Cascade effects:**
<self-cognition-confusion> → <atman-rigpa-conflation> → <subtle-grasping> → <recognition-miss>

**Page-bleed awareness:** Heavy crossover with 01-09 sections on recognition.

---

[1998-2013]
<ritual-merit-connection> [SACRIFICE AS LIBERATION-MEANS]
**Misreading:**
"Properly performing sacrifices, offerings, etc." interpreted as establishing that ritual performance combined with self-knowledge produces liberation.

**Why it arises:**
Sacrifice/offering language suggests ritual. "Properly performed" implies technique. Merit-making intuition.

**Primary consequence:**
Ritual causality accepted. The practitioner believes correct sacrifice + self-knowledge = liberation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ritual-obsession. Merit-accumulation. External action conflated with recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<ritual-causality> → <merit-obsession> → <external-dependence> → <recognition-miss>

---

[2014-2029]
<nihilistic-denial> [CHAD PA AS TOTAL VOID]
**Misreading:**
Nihilism (chad par smra ba) stating "no past/future lives, no karma, no liberation" interpreted as establishing total ontological denial—nothing exists, nothing matters, pure void.

**Why it arises:**
"Does not exist" suggests absolute absence. Nihilistic tendency finds confirmation. Extreme interpretation of emptiness.

**Primary consequence:**
Nihilism embraced as truth. The practitioner believes "nothing exists" means ethical nihilism and practice-abandonment.

**Secondary consequences:**
Paralysis. "Why practice if nothing exists?" Ethical collapse. Extreme view of emptiness.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilistic-error> → <void-interpretation> → <ethical-nihilism> → <practice-abandonment>

**Safety-critical:** HIGH RISK - nihilism can lead to harmful behavior and practice abandonment.

---

[2030-2045]
<materialist-emergence> [SPONTANEOUS GENERATION AS DOCTRINE]
**Misreading:**
The view that beings arise spontaneously from elements (ants from seeds, bees from flowers, etc.) interpreted as establishing spontaneous generation as literal truth.

**Why it arises:**
Examples seem scientific/observational. "Spontaneous" suggests causeless. Materialist-mechanistic worldview.

**Primary consequence:**
Pre-scientific biology accepted. The practitioner believes life literally emerges spontaneously from matter.

**Secondary consequences:**
Scientific-materialism conflated with Buddhist view. Missing dependent origination. Confusion about causality.

**Cascade effects:**
<materialist-emergence> → <spontaneous-generation> → <causal-confusion> → <dependent-origination-miss>

---

[2046-2061]
<pansychism-literalism> [MIND IN OBJECTS AS ANIMISM]
**Misreading:**
The view that trees, stones, objects possess mind (sems yod pa) interpreted as establishing literal pansychism—everything has consciousness, animism.

**Why it arises:**
"Mind exists in trees" suggests animation. Eco-spirituality appeal. Reaction against human exceptionalism.

**Primary consequence:**
Objects substantialized as conscious. The practitioner believes rocks literally have minds.

**Secondary consequences:**
Animistic superstition. Attributing intention to objects. Missing that awareness is not "in" objects.

**Cascade effects:**
<pansychism-literalism> → <animistic-attribution> → <object-consciousness> → <awareness-misunderstanding>

---

[2062-2077]
<result-nihilism-extreme> [DEATH AS TOTAL ANNIHILATION]
**Misreading:**
Result-nihilism stating "after death nothing remains, no consequences" interpreted as establishing total annihilation—complete cessation with no continuity whatsoever.

**Why it arises:**
Fear of continuity. Desire for final rest. "Nothing remains" suggests peace.

**Primary consequence:**
Death nihilism embraced. The practitioner believes death is absolute end, leading to despair or hedonism.

**Secondary consequences:**
Existential despair. "Eat, drink, be merry." Practice abandonment. No motivation for virtue.

**Cascade effects:**
<death-nihilism> → <annihilation-belief> → <existential-despair> → <ethical-collapse>

**Safety-critical:** HIGH RISK - annihilation-view destroys ethical foundation and practice motivation.

---

[2078-2093]
<naturalism-fatalism> [NATURAL ORDER AS UNCHANGEABLE]
**Misreading:**
Examples (sun rising, water flowing, thorns sharp) as "naturally existing without cause" interpreted as establishing natural order as fixed, unchangeable determinism.

**Why it arises:**
"Natural" suggests inevitable. Regular patterns appear law-like. Deterministic worldview.

**Primary consequence:**
Natural fatalism accepted. The practitioner believes patterns are fixed, change impossible.

**Secondary consequences:**
Passivity. "Can't fight nature." Missing that natural order is also empty.

**Cascade effects:**
<natural-fatalism> → <deterministic-passivity> → <change-impossibility> → <emptiness-miss>

---


This section (1902-2001+) presents the 360 erroneous views, beginning with Samkhya eternalism and moving through various nihilistic positions. This is foundational philosophical material that sets up the rest of Chapter 4's philosophical analysis.

**Critical continuity:** Errors here (substantializing self, nihilistic void, etc.) reappear in subtle forms throughout subsequent chapters. The gross reification of Samkhya self warps into the subtle reification of "awareness" as self in later Dzogchen misreadings.


---

[2094-2109]
<tirthika-view-catalog-obsession> [COLLECTING VIEWS ACADEMICALLY]
**Misreading:**
The systematic enumeration of *sum brgya drug cu* (360 wrong views) and their sub-categories is interpreted as establishing an academic catalog to be studied, memorized, and mastered as intellectual achievement.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration implies completeness. Taxonomic structure invites cataloging. Competitive study environments. Bibliophilic accumulation pattern.

**Primary consequence:**
Doxography becomes scholastic exercise. The practitioner accumulates view-classifications without recognizing fixation patterns in their own cognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pride in knowing all 360 views. Living inquiry replaced by rote memorization. Intellectual competition over who "knows more" wrong views.

**Cascade effects:**
<catalog-obsession> → <intellectual-accumulation> → <view-identity> → <scholastic-fixation>

---

[2110-2125]
<crystal-self-meditation> [MEDITATING ON THUMB-SIZED SELF]
**Misreading:**
The Samkhya description of self as "thumb-sized" (*mthe bong tsam*) in the heart is interpreted as establishing a meditation object—a crystalline entity to be visualized and concentrated upon.

**Why it arises:**
Specific spatial description invites reification. "Heart center" suggests anatomical locus. Concentration practices favor concrete objects.

**Primary consequence:**
Meditation on reified self-entity. The practitioner visualizes a thumb-sized essence, mistaking concentration on concept for recognition of nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fixation on heart-center. Anatomical literalism. Meditation-obsession with finding "the self." Location-anxiety when object cannot be stabilized.

**Cascade effects:**
<crystal-self> → <anatomical-meditation> → <entity-fixation> → <recognition-miss>

---

[2126-2141]
<guna-balance-therapy> [USING THREE GUNAS FOR HEALING]
**Misreading:**
The three *guna* qualities (*rdul*, *mun pa*, *snying stobs*) are interpreted as therapeutic elements to be balanced through Ayurvedic practice, yoga therapy, or wellness interventions.

**Why it arises:**
"Three qualities" parallel Ayurvedic *dosha* theory. Health optimization appeal. Commercial wellness industry. Reduction of philosophy to self-care.

**Primary consequence:**
Philosophical categories reduced to health protocol. The practitioner pursues "balancing the gunas" as wellness project, missing their role in reifying self.

**Secondary consequences:**
Wellness-obsession. New Age synthesis. Commercial appropriation. Fundamental philosophical error treated as lifestyle choice.

**Cascade effects:**
<guna-therapy> → <wellness-reduction> → <commercial-appropriation> → <philosophy-death>

---

[2142-2157]
<spontaneous-generation-biology> [TAKING LITERALLY]
**Misreading:**
Examples of spontaneous generation (ants from seeds, bees from flowers, frogs from moisture) interpreted as establishing literal biological doctrine—accepting ancient embryology as scientific fact.

**Why it arises:**
Examples appear observational. Pre-scientific biology seems authoritative. Literal hermeneutic default. Desire for textual inerrancy.

**Primary consequence:**
Embarrassing literalism. The practitioner defends spontaneous generation as "what the text says," creating credibility crisis when confronted with modern biology.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fundamentalism. Science-Buddhism conflict. Defensive apologetics. Missing metaphorical/symbolic function of examples.

**Cascade effects:**
<literal-biology> → <credibility-crisis> → <defensive-fundamentalism> → <intelligent-discourse-death>

---

[2158-2173]
<elemental-mind-pansychism> [MIND IN WATER, FIRE, ETC.]
**Misreading:**
The view that mind (*sems*) abides inherently in elements—earth producing trees, water enabling motion, fire burning, wind moving—is interpreted as establishing pansychism: consciousness permeates all matter.

**Why it arises:**
"Mind in elements" suggests animation. Eco-spirituality appeal. Reaction against Cartesian dualism. Romantic nature-mysticism.

**Primary consequence:**
Matter substantialized as conscious. The practitioner believes rocks, rivers, flames literally possess mind, confusing dependent origination with animism.

**Secondary consequences:**
Animistic superstition. Attribution of intention to objects. Nature-worship. Missing that awareness is not "in" phenomena but is the nature of experience.

**Cascade effects:**
<pansychism-literalism> → <animistic-attribution> → <nature-reification> → <awareness-misunderstanding>

---

[2174-2189]
<nihilism-hedonism> [NO KARMA = DO WHAT YOU WANT]
**Misreading:**
Nihilism (*chad pa*) denying karma, rebirth, and consequences interpreted as establishing ethical libertinism—if nothing continues, moral action is irrelevant, permitting any behavior.

**Why it arises:**
"Nothing exists" suggests moral vacuum. Hedonistic rationalization. Taboo-breaking allure. Reaction against religious moralism.

**Primary consequence:**
Ethical nihilism embraced. The practitioner believes "emptiness" justifies indulgence, causing harm to self and others.

**Secondary consequences:**
Predatory behavior. "Spiritual" hedonism. Community damage. Discredit to Dharma. Psychological instability.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilism-hedonism> → <ethical-collapse> → <harmful-behavior> → <suffering-amplification>

**Safety-critical:** EXTREME RISK - nihilism-hedonism causes severe ethical harm and community destruction.

[2190-2205]
<animal-asceticism-imitation> [COPYING ANIMAL BEHAVIORS]
**Misreading:**
Tirthika practices of imitating animals (dog behaviors, bird postures, cow routines) interpreted as establishing legitimate ascetic methodology—extreme physical imitation as spiritual path.

**Why it arises:**
"Asceticism" suggests discipline. Animal simplicity romanticized. Self-mortification appeal. Perversion of naturalness concept.

**Primary consequence:**
Dehumanizing practices adopted. The practitioner believes "acting like a dog" is valid spiritual training, confusing imitation with recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Psychological regression. Social dysfunction. Health damage. Mockery from outsiders. Missing that naturalness is not imitation but non-fabrication.

**Cascade effects:**
<animal-imitation> → <behavioral-regression> → <social-dysfunction> → <recognition-miss>

---

[2206-2221]
<extreme-austerity-pride> [PROUD OF SELF-HARM]
**Misreading:**
Severe ascetic practices (fire offerings, spike-sitting, flesh-tearing) interpreted as establishing spiritual superiority through pain—greater suffering demonstrates greater attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Pain suggests sacrifice. Martyrdom paradigm. Masochistic tendencies. Spiritual heroism narrative.

**Primary consequence:**
Self-harm as status symbol. The practitioner pursues increasingly extreme austerities to prove dedication, conflating suffering with progress.

**Secondary consequences:**
Physical damage. Psychological trauma. Spiritual pride. Competitive asceticism. Sadomasochistic spirituality.

**Cascade effects:**
<austerity-pride> → <self-harm-competition> → <spiritual-masochism> → <attainment-fantasy>

**Safety-critical:** HIGH RISK - extreme austerity causes physical and psychological harm.

---

[2222-2237]
<ritual-fire-purification> [FIRE RITUALS LITERALLY]
**Misreading:**
Fire offerings (*me lnga bsten pa*) and self-immolation practices interpreted as establishing literal purification mechanism—fire literally burns away defilements.

**Why it arises:**
"Fire purifies" universal motif. Ritual efficacy belief. Dramatic practice appeal. Elemental symbolism literalized.

**Primary consequence:**
Ritual literalism. The practitioner believes fire rituals literally consume karma, leading to dangerous practices and literal self-harm.

**Secondary consequences:**
Burn injuries. Death. Ritual obsession. Missing symbolic dimension. Commercialization of fire rituals.

**Cascade effects:**
<fire-literalism> → <ritual-danger> → <self-harm> → <purification-fantasy>

**Safety-critical:** EXTREME RISK - literal fire practices cause severe injury and death.

---

[2238-2253]
<view-debate-competition> [ARGUING VIEWS AS SPORT]
**Misreading:**
Refutation of 360 views (*mu stegs*) interpreted as establishing debating as competitive sport—victory in argumentation demonstrates wisdom, defeat indicates ignorance.

**Why it arises:**
"Refutation" implies debate. Competitive intellect. Ego gratification through winning. Scholarly culture of disputation.

**Primary consequence:**
Philosophy becomes blood sport. The practitioner engages in aggressive debate to prove superiority, confusing victory with understanding.

**Secondary consequences:**
Combative community dynamics. Trauma from aggressive debate. Intellectual bullying. Fragile egos. True inquiry destroyed by competition.

**Cascade effects:**
<debate-competition> → <intellectual-aggression> → <community-toxicity> → <inquiry-death>

[2254-2268]
<wrong-view-secrecy> [HIDDEN TEACHINGS OF WRONG VIEWS]
**Misreading:**
Tirthika doctrines interpreted as establishing esoteric "secret teachings"—wrong views conceal hidden wisdom accessible only to initiates.

**Why it arises:**
"Secret" suggests depth. Esoteric appeal. Conspiratorial thinking. Desire for exclusive knowledge.

**Primary consequence:**
Refuted views revalorized as esoteric. The practitioner seeks "hidden meaning" in nihilism and eternalism, conflating profundity with error.

**Secondary consequences:**
Syncretic confusion. Appropriation of refuted views. Cult dynamics. Missing that wrong views are simply wrong, not secretly right.

**Cascade effects:**
<wrong-view-esotericism> → <cult-formation> → <syncretic-confusion> → <discrimination-loss>

[2269-2283]
<tirthika-guru-lineage> [FOLLOWING NON-BUDDHIST TEACHERS]
**Misreading:**
Detailed presentation of tirthika teachers (*ston pa brgya*) interpreted as establishing legitimacy of non-Buddhist gurus—knowing their views validates their authority.

**Why it arises:**
Name-recognition suggests authenticity. Lineage fetishism. Comparative religion appeal. Inclusivity bias.

**Primary consequence:**
Non-Buddhist teachers validated. The practitioner believes knowing Samkhya justifies studying with Samkhya gurus, leading to deviation from path.

**Secondary consequences:**
Lineage confusion. Guru-shopping. Appropriation without discernment. Vows compromised. Refuge diluted.

**Cascade effects:**
<tirthika-lineage> → <guru-confusion> → <refuge-dilution> → <path-deviation>

[2284-2298]
<360-views-memorization> [MEMORIZING WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING]
**Misreading:**
The enumeration of 360 views and 100 teachers interpreted as establishing memorization curriculum—knowing names and classifications equals doctrinal mastery.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration suggests systematic study. Educational conditioning. Name-dropping social currency. Surface-level competence.

**Primary consequence:**
Rote memorization substituted for wisdom. The practitioner can list 360 views without recognizing how their own mind fixates similarly.

**Secondary consequences:**
Intellectual arrogance. Library-building. Living practice abandoned for textual mastery. Name recognition over nature recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<memorization-obsession> → <name-mastery> → <intellectual-arrogance> → <practice-abandonment>

[2299-2313]
<mu-stegs-reification> [TREATING TIRTHIKA AS REAL ENEMY]
**Misreading:**
"Tirthika" (*mu stegs can*) interpreted as establishing concrete enemy category—literal opponents to be opposed, fought, or converted.

**Why it arises:**
"Wrong view" suggests antagonist. Tribal psychology. Persecution complex. Missionary impulse.

**Primary consequence:**
Othering dynamics activated. The practitioner views non-Buddhists as "the enemy," fostering hostility rather than compassion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Religious conflict. Superiority complex. Conversion aggression. Missing that "tirthika" refers to fixation patterns, not people.

**Cascade effects:**
<tirthika-reification> → <othering> → <religious-conflict> → <compassion-death>

---

[2314-2328]
<refutation-aggression> [AGGRESSIVELY REFUTING OTHERS]

---

[2374-2388]
<middle-way-intellectualization> [CONCEPTUAL MIDDLE ONLY]
**Misreading:**
"Middle way between eternalism and nihilism" interpreted as establishing conceptual position—intellectual synthesis of opposites as sufficient.

**Why it arises:**
"Middle" suggests compromise. Intellectual balance appeal. Avoiding extremes conceptually. Philosophical moderation.

**Primary consequence:**
Middle way reduced to concept. The practitioner believes "neither eternalism nor nihilism" is a view to hold, rather than fixation-release.

**Secondary consequences:**
Conceptual middle becomes new extreme. Smug centrism. Intellectual superiority. Still trapped in view-making.

**Cascade effects:**
<conceptual-middle> → <centrism-pride> → <view-making> → <release-miss>

---

[2389-2403]
<correct-view-possession> [PRIDE IN HAVING RIGHT VIEW]
**Misreading:**
Refutation of 360 wrong views interpreted as establishing possession of "correct view"—knowing what's wrong proves one has what's right.

**Why it arises:**
Negation implies affirmation. Binary logic. Superiority through negation. Confidence through contrast.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual pride in correctness. The practitioner believes knowing 360 wrong views indicates possession of right view, conflating negation with realization.

**Secondary consequences:**

**Cascade effects:**
<teacher-fetishism> → <name-worship> → <authority-obsession> → <living-wisdom-death>

---

[2419-2433]
<kumara-materialism> [SEMLESS BODY DOCTRINE]
**Misreading:**
Kumara's view of body without mind (*sems med pa'i lus*) interpreted as establishing materialist doctrine—consciousness as epiphenomenon of matter.

**Why it arises:**
"Body without mind" suggests materialism. Scientific materialist appeal. Reductionist tendency. Physicalist worldview.

**Primary consequence:**
Mind reduced to body-function. The practitioner believes consciousness is merely brain activity, missing awareness-nature.

**Why it arises:**
"Mantra" suggests power. Magical thinking. Aggression-sublimation. Control fantasy.

**Primary consequence:**
Mantra practice weaponized. The practitioner uses sacred sounds for aggressive purposes, corrupting the path.

**Secondary consequences:**
Black magic appropriation. Harmful practices. Commercialization of power. Spiritual materialism at its worst.

[2464-2478]
<symbol-fetishism> [PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES AS ATTAINMENT]
**Misreading:**
Tirthika physical markers (topknots, staff, skull-cup) interpreted as establishing attainment-indicators—external symbols prove internal realization.

**Why it arises:**
"Signs" suggest status. Symbolic communication. Shortcut to recognition. Appearance-reality confusion.

**Primary consequence:**
External symbols mistaken for realization. The practitioner adopts tirthika markers believing they indicate wisdom.

**Secondary consequences:**
Costume spirituality. Impostor syndrome. Consumerist acquisition of "spiritual look." Appearance over substance.

**Why it arises:**
"Space" suggests vastness. Cosmic consciousness appeal. Container metaphor dominance. Infinity fascination.

**Primary consequence:**
Space substantialized. The practitioner believes akasha is "the ultimate," reifying openness as entity.

**Secondary consequences:**
Cosmic expansion-fantasy. Container-view. Spatial absolutism. Missing that space is also empty.

<liberation-branding> [SPECIAL TITLES AS ATTAINMENT]
**Misreading:**
Names suggesting liberation (*'khor ba las grol ba pa*) interpreted as establishing attainment through labeling—calling oneself "liberated" makes it so.

**Why it arises:**
"Liberated" suggests achievement. Naming-power belief. Identity-through-label. Status shortcut.

**Primary consequence:**
Title as attainment. The practitioner adopts liberated-sounding names without realization, living in pretense.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual materialism. False advertising. Community confusion. Self-deception. Integrity collapse.

**Cascade effects:**
<liberation-branding> → <title-identity> → <false-advertising> → <integrity-death>

<numerical-mysticism> [NUMBERS AS ESOTERIC CODE]
**Misreading:**
Numbers in classifications (360, 60, 100, etc.) interpreted as establishing esoteric numerology—quantities encode secret meanings.

**Why it arises:**
Numbers suggest hidden order. Gematria tradition. Pattern-seeking. Secret-code fantasy.

**Primary consequence:**
Numerical divination. The practitioner searches for "hidden meanings" in 360, missing the pedagogical purpose of enumeration.

**Secondary consequences:**
Numerology obsession. Mathematical mysticism. Arbitrary pattern-creation. Missing actual teaching content.

**Cascade effects:**
<numerical-mysticism> → <gematria-fantasy> → <pattern-obsession> → <content-miss>
