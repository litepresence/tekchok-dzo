[8841-8847] [VIEW ERROR] [LOCATION ESSENTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The specific locations (tip to root, root to navel, etc.) are understood as fixed anatomical points that must be precisely mapped and manipulated, like acupuncture points with guaranteed effects.

**Why it arises:**
Cartographic thinking projects spatial certainty onto subtle body. The precise anatomical language suggests objective geography. Scientific materialism supports literalization.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that locations are conceptual designations for awareness-movement, not fixed points, is entirely obscured. The energetic becomes the cartographic.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners carry anatomical maps while missing the awareness that moves. Disappointment when locations don't match descriptions leads to doubt. The fluid becomes fixed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on channel opening become navigational challenges.

[8848-8857] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [RETENTION FETISHISM]
**Misreading:**
The signs of successful thigle retention (freedom from illness, youthful appearance, long life) are treated as guaranteed physiological benefits that automatically result from physical practice.

**Why it arises:**
Health-and-longevity frameworks project onto tantric practice. The benefit-list suggests causative product. Desire for tangible rewards supports literal interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that signs indicate recognition, not health benefits, is entirely lost. Practice becomes wellness regimen rather than wisdom cultivation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners measure success by physical appearance while neglecting realization. Disappointment when signs don't manifest leads to abandonment. The spiritual becomes the cosmetic.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on signs will be approached as achievement certificates.

[8858-8868] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [PERFECTION DEFERRAL]
**Misreading:**
The threefold process (outer body, inner mind, both simultaneously) is interpreted as progressive stages requiring mastery of each before advancing to the next, with simultaneous perfection as distant goal.

**Why it arises:**
Skill-acquisition models impose sequential learning frameworks. The tripartite structure suggests curriculum progression. Fear of "skipping ahead" drives deferral.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that all three are always already perfect is entirely obscured. Practitioners remain stuck in outer practices, deferring inner recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Elitist hierarchies form around which "level" one practices. The unity of outer-inner is never recognized. Fragmentation replaces simultaneity.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers all error types. Trekcho will be misread as advanced technique rather than present recognition.

[8869-8872] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [SIDDLHI SHOPPING]
**Misreading:**
The siddhis listed (walking without touching ground, seeing atoms, flying in space) are treated as spiritual trophies to be collected, like video game achievements unlocking at practice milestones.

**Why it arises:**
Gamification psychology projects onto spiritual practice. The enumerative lists suggest collectible items. Desire for extraordinary powers supports acquisition-mindset.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that siddhis are byproducts of recognition, not goals to pursue, is entirely lost. Practice becomes power-accumulation rather than wisdom-cultivation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners compare "attainments" competitively. Faking siddhis to maintain status becomes common. The supreme siddhi (recognition) is sacrificed for lesser displays.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on accomplishment will be approached as power-acquisition manual.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page discusses mahamudra and thigle retention practices. Preceding pages established subtle body errors that intensify here—practitioners will approach mahamudra as physical technique. Following pages (207+) discuss signs and benefits that will be misunderstood through lens of worldly attainment.
