[8841-8852] <purification-hierarchy> [BODY/SPEECH/MIND/CONSCIOUSNESS PURIFICATION AS STAGES]
**Misreading:**
The fourfold purification (body as deity, speech as mantra, mind as samadhi, consciousness as dharmata) is interpreted as progressive stages one advances through.

**Why it arises:**
Sequential thinking. Four items suggest curriculum. Purification implies process.

**Primary consequence:**
Staged purification. The practitioner believes they purify body first, then speech, then mind, then consciousness.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring "deep" purification; stage-anxiety; missing that all four are simultaneous.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through purification-stages.
<progress-tracking> through purification-levels.

[8853-8862] <elaboration-confusion> [ELABORATE/UNELABORATE HIERARCHY]
**Misreading:**
The elaborate/unelaborate distinctions applied to empowerments are interpreted as hierarchy with "utterly unelaborate" as highest.

**Why it arises:**
Progressive interpretation. "Utterly" suggests culmination. Elaboration seems like obstacle.

**Primary consequence:**
Elaboration-elitism. The practitioner seeks "unelaborate" empowerments as superior.

**Secondary consequences:**
Rejecting elaborate practices; missing that distinctions describe capacity-appropriateness, not hierarchy.

**Cascade effects:**
<elitism-error> through elaboration-hierarchy.
<practice-path-confusion> through rejecting appropriate methods.

[8863-8868] <action-liberation> [ACTIONS LIBERATED AS LICENSE]
**Misreading:**
"Liberation of action's extreme" and "liberating attachment and aversion" is interpreted as license for unethical behavior.

**Why it arises:**
Anti-nomian temptation. "Liberated" suggests freedom from ethics. Misunderstanding of tantric conduct.

**Primary consequence:**
Ethical nihilism. The practitioner believes actions are "already liberated" and therefore any conduct is acceptable.

**Secondary consequences:**
Harmful behavior; spiritual libertinism; "beyond ethics" as excuse.

**Cascade effects:**
<ethical-nihilism> through liberation-license.
<extreme-view> through abandoning discernment.

[8869-8872] <kaya-field-literalism> [THREE KAYA FIELDS AS LOCATIONS]
**Misreading:**
The "fields" of Nirmanakaya, Sambhogakaya, and Dharmakaya are interpreted as actual locations or realms to enter or achieve.

**Why it arises:**
Spatial literalism. "Field" suggests location. Pure land associations.

**Primary consequence:**
Field-seeking. The practitioner believes there are actual kaya-fields to enter.

**Secondary consequences:**
Realm-ambition; pure land fixation; missing that "fields" are modes of recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through spatializing kayas.
<future-dependency> through seeking fields.
