[5963-5981] <epistemic-error> [TRANSCENDENCE AS GOAL]
**Misreading:**
The text's description of primordial purity (rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po) is interpreted as a description of the goal state that practice should achieve.

**Why it arises:**
Desire for attainment. The mind automatically converts "already perfect" into "what I need to become." Cognitive bias toward goal-oriented achievement even when explicitly denied.

**Primary consequence:**
Missing that recognition is not attainment. The practitioner believes they must "reach" what is already present.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual bypassing of actual recognition work; premature "I've got it" syndrome; dismissive attitude toward gradual path practitioners.

**Cascade effects:**
<fundamental-delusion> through confusing map with territory.
<meditationism-error> through creating new practice of "non-practice."

[5982-6007] <ontological-error> [ATTRIBUTES AS ESSENCE]
**Misreading:**
The list of qualities ("vast," "leveled," "Buddha-ed," "freed," "unmoving," etc.) are taken as descriptions of an essential nature that can be known, possessed, or identified with.

**Why it arises:**
Reification reflex. Words describing how things are not (not this, not that) are heard as positive descriptions of what is. Language habits impose substance on negations.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking non-affirming negations as affirmations. The practitioner grasps at "vastness" or "spontaneity" as qualities of enlightened mind.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual materialism of "my vast awareness"; subtle eternalistic self-view dressed in Dzogchen vocabulary.

**Cascade effects:**
<self-grasping> through identifying with "primordially pure nature."
<eternalistic-error> through making emptiness into something.

[6008-6026] <logical-error> [TRIPLE-TIME DENIAL AS PRACTICE]
**Misreading:**
The threefold denial (before: not experiencing delusion; now: not abiding; end: delusion impossible) is interpreted as a teaching on the stages of practice or results to achieve.

**Why it arises:**
Temporal projection. Even explicit denial of past/present/future is heard through temporal framework. The mind cannot process timelessness directly.

**Primary consequence:**
Creating linear path where none exists. The practitioner thinks: "First I wasn't deluded, now I don't abide, finally I'll be free."

**Secondary consequences:**
Chronologizing the timeless; measuring progress through "less delusion"; anxiety about "which stage am I in?"

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-path-confusion> through imposing sequence on simultaneity.
<fundamental-delusion> through missing that time itself is the delusion.

---

[6027-6087] <methodological-error> [NEGATION AS INSTRUCTION]
**Misreading:**
The extensive list of negations ("nothing to look at," "nothing to meditate," "nothing to accomplish," etc.) is interpreted as a set of meditation instructions on what not to do.

**Why it arises:**
Instruction-habit. The practitioner is conditioned to receive practice instructions, so even radical negations are converted into new practices: "I must practice non-meditation."

**Primary consequence:**
Creating practice of non-practice. "I am meditating on nothing" becomes the new meditation object.

**Secondary consequences:**
Effort to be effortless; striving to be without striving; doing nothing as a doing.

**Cascade effects:**
<meditationism-error> through making non-meditation into meditation.
<doer-grasping> through creating "me who doesn't practice."

[6088-6177] <tantra-misapplication> [KAYA TRANSCENDENCE AS KAYA ATTAINMENT]
**Misreading:**
The description of three kayas as spontaneously self-dawning (outer vision as Dharmakāya, inner awareness as Sambhogakāya, appearances as Nirmāṇakāya) is interpreted as a teaching on the results of successful deity yoga practice.

**Why it arises:**
Tantric framework bleed. Practitioners familiar with generation/completion stage practices automatically interpret Dzogchen's spontaneous kayas through tantric lens of "attaining kayas through practice."

**Primary consequence:**
Taking natural display as created result. The practitioner believes they must "achieve" the three kayas through visualization practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that kayas are how things already are; creating separation between current state and "kaya state"; deity yoga practice for "attaining" what is already present.

**Cascade effects:**
<tantra-inflation> through imposing tantric methodology on Dzogchen view.
<fundamental-delusion> through not recognizing natural display.

**Page bleed awareness:** Heavy crossover with 02-19-01-01.txt deity visualization section. Misreading here reinforces deity yoga approach there.

[6178-6206] <practice-rejection> [NO-MANDALA AS SUPERIOR MANDALA]
**Misreading:**
The explicit rejection of mandala, deity, seed syllables, mantra, mudrā, offerings, empowerment, and samaya is interpreted as the "higher" or "more advanced" form of these practices.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchy habit. Rejection is understood as transcendence that includes and surpasses, rather than fundamental negation. The mind preserves rejected elements as "included."

**Primary consequence:**
Making non-mandala into ultimate mandala. The practitioner thinks: "The real mandala is no mandala" rather than seeing that mandala concept itself is unnecessary.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual pride about "not needing" practices others use; secret belief in superiority; covert retention of what was ostensibly rejected.

**Cascade effects:**
<elitism-error> through "higher" non-practice.
<spiritual-materialism> through accumulating "transcendence" as achievement.

---

[6207-6233] <view-misunderstanding> [BEYOND VIEW AS SPECIAL VIEW]
**Misreading:**
The statement "in great perfection ati yoga, no view, meditation, or conduct" is interpreted as a special or superior type of view, meditation, and conduct.

**Why it arises:**
Category preservation. The mind cannot truly abandon categories, so it creates "beyond-view view" to maintain cognitive framework while appearing to transcend it.

**Primary consequence:**
Converting negation into superior affirmation. "No view" becomes "the view of no-view" - a position held and defended.

**Secondary consequences:**
Debates about "correct Dzogchen view"; sectarianism; attachment to "viewlessness" as view.

**Cascade effects:**
<view-attachment> through holding "no-view" as view.
<fundamental-delusion> through missing that view itself is the problem.

---

[6234-6260] <essence-grasping> [UNBORN AS ESSENCE]
**Misreading:**
The teaching on unborn nature is interpreted as the discovery of an essential unborn nature that is the true self or substratum of reality.

**Why it arises:**
Substance habit. Even "unborn" is reified into an unborn thing/essence/nature. Negation of birth/death becomes positive eternal entity.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking unborn as existent essence. The practitioner believes they have discovered "the unborn nature" as something real.

**Secondary consequences:**
Nihilism dressed as Dzogchen; eternalistic self-view; dismissal of relative truth.

**Cascade effects:**
<eternalistic-error> through reifying unborn.
<nihilistic-error> through rejecting all appearing phenomena.

---

[6261-6338] <instruction-misapplication> [NO-INSTRUCTION AS SECRET INSTRUCTION]
**Misreading:**
The passage stating "not indicated by tantra and instruction" and "not to be examined even by wisdom" is interpreted as indicating a secret or special instruction beyond ordinary teachings.

**Why it arises:**
Esoteric temptation. Explicit denial of instruction-status creates mystique that makes it seem like "highest instruction." The prohibition becomes invitation.

**Primary consequence:**
Seeking secret where openness declared. The practitioner believes there must be hidden teachings or secret pointing-out they haven't received.

**Secondary consequences:**
Guru-shopping for "real" Dzogchen; dismissing accessible teachings; esoteric elitism.

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through seeking secret instructions.
<practice-path-confusion> through missing that recognition is immediate.

---

[6339-6413] <analytical-misuse> [ANALYSIS AS REALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
The analytical meditation on mind's arising, abiding, and going is interpreted as a practice that produces realization, rather than a demonstration that realization is already present.

**Why it arises:**
Cause-effect thinking. Analysis is automatically understood as method leading to result, when here it reveals what has always been so.

**Primary consequence:**
Practicing analysis to get somewhere. The practitioner engages in analytical meditation believing it will lead to realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that analysis reveals non-arising already true; turning recognition-tool into achievement-practice; intellectual understanding substituted for recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<meditationism-error> through analytical meditation as practice.
<intellectualism> through understanding without recognition.
