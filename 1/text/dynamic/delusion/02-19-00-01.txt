[5963-5981] <epistemic-error> [TRANSCENDENCE AS GOAL]
**Misreading:**
The text's description of primordial purity (rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po) is interpreted as a description of the goal state that practice should achieve.

**Why it arises:**
Desire for attainment. The mind automatically converts "already perfect" into "what I need to become."

**Primary consequence:**
Missing that recognition is not attainment.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual bypassing; premature "I've got it" syndrome.

**Cascade effects:**
<epistemic-error> → <goal-projection> (future-attainment) → <present-rejection> (inadequate-now) → <recognition-prevention-error> (seeking substitutes for being).

---

[5982-6000] <ontological-error> [ATTRIBUTES AS ESSENCE]
**Misreading:**
The list of qualities ("vast," "leveled," "Buddha-ed," "freed," "unmoving") are descriptions of an essential nature to know, possess, or identify with.

**Why it arises:**
Reification reflex. Words describing how things are not are heard as positive descriptions.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking non-affirming negations as affirmations.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual materialism; eternalistic self-view.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-error> → <essence-grasping> (quality-possession) → <self-identification> (I-am-vast) → <recognition-prevention-error> (attributes substitute for emptiness).

---

[6001-6019] <logical-error> [TRIPLE-TIME DENIAL AS PRACTICE]
**Misreading:**
The threefold denial (before: not experiencing delusion; now: not abiding; end: delusion impossible) is interpreted as stages of practice to achieve.

**Why it arises:**
Temporal projection. Even denial of past/present/future is heard through temporal framework.

**Primary consequence:**
Creating linear path where none exists.

**Secondary consequences:**
Chronologizing the timeless; progress anxiety.

**Cascade effects:**
<logical-error> → <temporal-imposition> (chronologizing) → <stage-creation> (progress-levels) → <recognition-prevention-error> (sequence substitutes for simultaneity).

---

[6020-6038] <methodological-error> [NEGATION AS INSTRUCTION]
**Misreading:**
The extensive negations ("nothing to look at," "nothing to meditate," "nothing to accomplish") are interpreted as meditation instructions on what not to do.

**Why it arises:**
Instruction-habit. Even radical negations are converted into new practices.

**Primary consequence:**
Creating practice of non-practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Effort to be effortless; striving to be without striving.

**Cascade effects:**
<methodological-error> → <practice-of-non-practice> (doing-nothing) → <effort-paradox> (striving-to-rest) → <recognition-prevention-error> (technique substitutes for freedom).

---

[6039-6057] <tantra-misapplication> [KAYA TRANSCENDENCE AS KAYA ATTAINMENT]
**Misreading:**
The three kayas as spontaneously self-dawning (outer vision as Dharmakāya, inner awareness as Sambhogakāya, appearances as Nirmāṇakāya) is interpreted as results of deity yoga practice.

**Why it arises:**
Tantric framework bleed. Practitioners familiar with generation/completion stages interpret Dzogchen through tantric lens.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking natural display as created result.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that kayas are how things already are.

**Cascade effects:**
<tantra-misapplication> → <attainment-approach> (creating-kayas) → <separation-creation> (from-kaya-state) → <recognition-prevention-error> (production substitutes for recognition).

---

[6058-6076] <practice-rejection> [NO-MANDALA AS SUPERIOR MANDALA]
**Misreading:**
The explicit rejection of mandala, deity, seed syllables, mantra, mudrā, offerings, empowerment, samaya is interpreted as "higher" or "more advanced" form of these practices.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchy habit. Rejection understood as transcendence that includes and surpasses.

**Primary consequence:**
Making non-mandala into ultimate mandala.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual pride; secret belief in superiority.

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-rejection> → <superiority-complex> (higher-non-practice) → <transcendence-accumulation> (including-while-denying) → <recognition-prevention-error> (pride substitutes for view).

---

[6077-6095] <view-misunderstanding> [BEYOND VIEW AS SPECIAL VIEW]
**Misreading:**
"In great perfection ati yoga, no view, meditation, or conduct" is interpreted as special or superior type of view, meditation, and conduct.

**Why it arises:**
Category preservation. Mind cannot abandon categories, creates "beyond-view view."

**Primary consequence:**
Converting negation into superior affirmation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Debates about "correct Dzogchen view"; sectarianism.

**Cascade effects:**
<view-misunderstanding> → <meta-view-formation> (beyond-as-view) → <position-defense> (protecting-no-view) → <recognition-prevention-error> (concept substitutes for openness).

---

[6096-6114] <essence-grasping> [UNBORN AS ESSENCE]
**Misreading:**
The teaching on unborn nature is interpreted as discovery of essential unborn nature as true self or substratum of reality.

**Why it arises:**
Substance habit. Even "unborn" is reified into unborn thing/essence.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking unborn as existent essence.

**Secondary consequences:**
Nihilism dressed as Dzogchen; eternalistic self-view.

**Cascade effects:**
<essence-grasping> → <unborn-reification> (thing-unborn) → <substrate-belief> (true-nature) → <recognition-prevention-error> (essence substitutes for emptiness).

---

[6115-6133] <instruction-misapplication> [NO-INSTRUCTION AS SECRET INSTRUCTION]
**Misreading:**
"Not indicated by tantra and instruction" and "not to be examined even by wisdom" is interpreted as indicating secret or special instruction beyond ordinary teachings.

**Why it arises:**
Esoteric temptation. Explicit denial creates mystique of "highest instruction."

**Primary consequence:**
Seeking secret where openness declared.

**Secondary consequences:**
Guru-shopping; dismissing accessible teachings.

**Cascade effects:**
<instruction-misapplication> → <secrecy-seeking> (hidden-teachings) → <authority-dependency> (special-masters) → <recognition-prevention-error> (seeking substitutes for immediate).

---

[6134-6152] <analytical-misuse> [ANALYSIS AS REALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
The analytical meditation on mind's arising, abiding, and going is interpreted as practice that produces realization, rather than demonstration that realization is already present.

**Why it arises:**
Cause-effect thinking. Analysis understood as method leading to result.

**Primary consequence:**
Practicing analysis to get somewhere.

**Secondary consequences:**
Turning recognition-tool into achievement-practice.

**Cascade effects:**
<analytical-misuse> → <method-obsession> (analysis-as-path) → <intellectual-substitution> (understanding-for-recognition) → <recognition-prevention-error> (thinking substitutes for being).

---

[6153-6171] <trekcho-completion-anxiety> <khregs-chod-readiness-pressure>

**Misreading:**
Trekcho (khregs chod) must be "completed" or "mastered" before one can receive thogal (thod rgal) teachings—creating pressure to achieve cutting-through proficiency.

**Why it arises:**
Pedagogical structure suggests prerequisites. "Cutting through" sounds like method to finish. Elitism around thogal secrecy.

**Primary consequence:**
Trekcho becomes obstacle to overcome. Practitioners create anxiety about "readiness," measuring cutting-through proficiency, comparing themselves to "qualified" thogal students.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Pressure to "finish" trekcho
- Comparison with "advanced" practitioners
- Believing one must "earn" thogal
- Missing that khregs chod is recognition itself

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-completion-anxiety> → <proficiency-measurement> (readiness-assessment) → <hierarchy-acceptance> (qualified-vs-unqualified) → <recognition-prevention-error> (achievement substitutes for immediacy).

---

[6172-6190] <thogal-light-phenomena-fixation> <thod-rgal-od-kyi-thig-le-grasping>

**Misreading:**
The light phenomena ('od kyi thig le) of thogal are special experiences to cultivate and sustain—practitioners should work to develop these visionary appearances.

**Why it arises:**
Light descriptions are vivid and inspiring. Phenomena seem verifiable. "Results" appeal to achievers. Visionary experiences fascinate.

**Primary consequence:**
Thogal light becomes cultivation object. Practitioners attempt to "produce" or "hold" light phenomena, treating natural display as something to manipulate.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Trying to "make" lights appear
- Anxiety when phenomena fade
- Believing light-sustainment equals progress
- Missing that thig le are empty rang snang

**Cascade effects:**
<thogal-light-phenomena-fixation> → <phenomena-cultivation> (developing-lights) → <experience-dependency> (needing-visions) → <recognition-prevention-error> (objects substitute for essence).

---

[6191-6209] <rainbow-body-achievement-fantasy> <ja-lus-attainment-dream>

**Misreading:**
Rainbow body ('ja' lus) is an attainment to work toward through dedicated practice—the practitioner should orient their entire Dzogchen path toward achieving dissolution into light.

**Why it arises:**
Rainbow body stories are dramatic. Tangible proof desire. Spiritual ambition. Spectacular result fantasy.

**Primary consequence:**
Rainbow body becomes ultimate goal. Practitioners secretly dedicate all practice toward 'ja' lus achievement, creating grasping at future dissolution.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Orienting practice toward death-display
- Believing 'ja' lus proves "real" realization
- Anxiety about "ordinary" dissolution
- Missing that rainbow body is spontaneous

**Cascade effects:**
<rainbow-body-achievement-fantasy> → <dissolution-aspiration> (wanting-display) → <death-performance> (special-dissolution) → <recognition-prevention-error> (phenomenon substitutes for freedom).

---

[6210-6228] <bardo-preparation-obsession> <bar-do-lam-khyer-fixation>

**Misreading:**
Bardo (bar do) teachings require extensive preparation and memorization—one must master the liberating instructions (grol khrid) to navigate death successfully.

**Why it arises:**
Death anxiety seeks control. Systematic teachings appeal. Fear of confusion. Preparation habit.

**Primary consequence:**
Bardo becomes obsession with preparation. Practitioners accumulate bardo techniques as insurance policy, studying for death-exam rather than recognizing now.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Treating death as test to study for
- Anxiety about forgetting at death-moment
- Accumulating techniques for future
- Missing that bar do is present nature

**Cascade effects:**
<bardo-preparation-obsession> → <future-insurance> (death-preparation) → <technique-accumulation> (bardo-methods) → <recognition-prevention-error> (preparation substitutes for presence).

---

[6229-6247] <phowa-compulsion> <pho-ba-obsessive-practice>

**Misreading:**
Phowa ('pho ba) must be practiced obsessively to ensure success at death—repetition creates reliability, guaranteeing consciousness ejection to pure land.

**Why it arises:**
Death anxiety. Compulsive practice habit. "Practice makes perfect" mentality. Guarantee-seeking.

**Primary consequence:**
Phowa becomes compulsive ritual. Practitioners repeat transference obsessively, believing repetition masters death—creating anxiety-driven mechanical practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Compulsive repetition for "mastery"
- Anxiety about "failing" at death
- Mechanical practice without recognition
- Missing that 'pho ba is spontaneous openness

**Cascade effects:**
<phowa-compulsion> → <obsessive-repetition> (mechanical-practice) → <mastery-illusion> (death-control) → <recognition-prevention-error> (compulsion substitutes for ease).

---

[6248-6266] <spontaneous-perfection-inertia> <lhun-rdzogs-passivity-trap>

**Misreading:**
Spontaneous perfection (lhun rdzogs) means no transformation or change is necessary—everything is already complete, so one can remain unchanged in comfortable habits.

**Why it arises:**
"Perfected" suggests completion. Complacency seeking. Misunderstanding lhun grub. Comfort-zone defense.

**Primary consequence:**
Spontaneous perfection justifies inertia. Practitioners use Dzogchen to affirm stagnation, confusing ordinary mind with natural state.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Dismissing all growth as unnecessary
- Justifying limitations as "perfection"
- Comfortable imprisonment in habits
- Missing that spontaneity is dynamic

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneous-perfection-inertia> → <stagnation-defense> (comfortable-unchanging) → <ordinary-mistake> (habits-as-nature) → <recognition-prevention-error> (inertia substitutes for recognition).

---

[6267-6285] <recognition-anxiety-syndrome> <ngo-shes-performance-stress>

**Misreading:**
Recognition (ngo shes pa) is a state one must achieve and then maintain—creating ongoing anxiety about "getting it" and "keeping it."

**Why it arises:**
"Recognition" suggests achievement. Performance culture. Fear of losing gains. State-obsession.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition becomes anxiety source. Practitioners create stress about attaining and maintaining recognition, when it's already present.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Performance anxiety about recognizing
- Trying to "hold" recognition state
- Fear of "losing" what was gained
- Missing that ngo shes is not state

**Cascade effects:**
<recognition-anxiety-syndrome> → <state-obsession> (getting-keeping) → <grasping-effort> (holding-recognition) → <recognition-prevention-error> (anxiety substitutes for ease).

---

[6286-6304] <ground-path-result-linearization> <gzhi-lam-'bras-bu-timeline>

**Misreading:**
Ground (gzhi), path (lam), and result ('bras bu) form a timeline—first find ground, then traverse path, finally arrive at result—a journey from here to there.

**Why it arises:**
Three words suggest sequence. Journey metaphor. Developmental thinking. Result seems destination.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes linear timeline. Practitioners view themselves as moving from ground-discovery through path-traversal to result-arrival.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Seeing ground as starting point
- Viewing path as distance to cover
- Waiting for result as arrival
- Missing that gzhi-lam-'bras bu are one view

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-result-linearization> → <timeline-thinking> (journey-metaphor) → <attainment-distance> (far-from-goal) → <recognition-prevention-error> (linearity substitutes for unity).

---

[6305-6323] <ka-dag-entity-view> <primordial-purity-thing-hood>

**Misreading:**
Ka-dag (ka dag) refers to an entity, thing, or existent called "primordial purity"—a metaphysical object existing prior to manifestation.

**Why it arises:**
"Primordial" suggests origin. "Purity" implies essence. Entity-thinking. Metaphysical habits.

**Primary consequence:**
Ka-dag becomes metaphysical entity. Practitioners search for "it"—the primordially pure thing—creating reification of negation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Seeking ka-dag as hidden object
- Believing "it" underlies phenomena
- Creating purity/contamination duality
- Missing that ka-dag is not a thing

**Cascade effects:**
<ka-dag-entity-view> → <thing-reification> (entity-belief) → <metaphysical-search> (finding-ka-dag) → <recognition-prevention-error> (object substitutes for emptiness).

---

[6324-6342] <lhun-grub-property-view> <spontaneous-presence-possession>

**Misreading:**
Lhun-grub (lhun grub) is a property, characteristic, or feature of awareness—something awareness has or possesses.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous presence" sounds like quality. Property-language. Possession thinking. Attributive habits.

**Primary consequence:**
Lhun-grub becomes possessed property. Practitioners believe awareness "has" lhun-grub, creating subtle dualism between owner and owned.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Attributing characteristics to awareness
- Believing lhun-grub describes "what mind is"
- Creating possessor/possessed relationship
- Missing that lhun-grub is unfindable

**Cascade effects:**
<lhun-grub-property-view> → <attribution-duality> (having-quality) → <characteristic-fixation> (describing-awareness) → <recognition-prevention-error> (property substitutes for nature).

---

[6343-6361] <thugs-rje-source-view> <compassion-origin-creation>

**Misreading:**
Thugs-rje (thugs rje) is a source or origin from which compassionate manifestations flow—a creative power generating responsive display.

**Why it arises:**
"Emanation" suggests source. Creativity language. Origin thinking. Causal habits.

**Primary consequence:**
Thugs-rje becomes origin-point. Practitioners view compassion as flowing from a source, creating causal duality of origin and manifestation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Viewing thugs-rje as generative source
- Believing compassion "comes from" ground
- Creating source/flow duality
- Missing that thugs-rje is non-dual display

**Cascade effects:**
<thugs-rje-source-view> → <origin-duality> (source-product) → <causal-thinking> (generating-compassion) → <recognition-prevention-error> (origin substitutes for display).

---

[6362-6380] <trinity-differentiation> <ngo-bo-rang-bzhin-thugs-rje-distinction>

**Misreading:**
Essence (ngo bo), nature (rang bzhin), and compassion (thugs rje) are three different things, realities, or aspects to be experienced separately.

**Why it arises:**
Three terms suggest distinction. Differentiation habit. Analytical separation. Language implies division.

**Primary consequence:**
Trinity becomes three separate things. Practitioners experience essence, then nature, then compassion—fragmenting unity into sequence.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Experiencing aspects separately
- Creating distinctions where none exist
- Missing inseparability of three
- Compartmentalizing enlightened mind

**Cascade effects:**
<trinity-differentiation> → <separation-experience> (distinct-moments) → <fragmentation> (three-things) → <recognition-prevention-error> (division substitutes for unity).

---

[6381-6399] <recognition-cognitive-achievement> <ngo-shes-mental-accomplishment>

**Misreading:**
Direct recognition (ngo shes pa) is a cognitive accomplishment, mental achievement, or intellectual understanding that marks progress.

**Why it arises:**
"Recognition" suggests cognition. Achievement culture. Mental accomplishment habits. "Getting it" language.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition becomes cognitive trophy. Practitioners seek ngo shes as mental badge of honor, believing it's something achieved "in" mind.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Pride in "understanding" Dzogchen
- Believing recognition equals comprehension
- Confusing intellectual with direct
- Missing that ngo shes transcends cognition

**Cascade effects:**
<recognition-cognitive-achievement> → <mental-trophy> (understanding-pride) → <intellectual-conflation> (thinking-is-recognizing) → <recognition-prevention-error> (cognition substitutes for nature).

---

[6400-6418] <self-liberation-passivity-permission> <rang-grol-non-engagement>

**Misreading:**
Self-liberation (rang grol) means phenomena liberate themselves without any engagement—one need not do anything because liberation is automatic.

**Why it arises:**
"Self" suggests automatic. "Liberation" sounds like result. Non-engagement appeal. Effort-avoidance.

**Primary consequence:**
Self-liberation becomes permission for passivity. Practitioners allow all patterns to continue, claiming they "self-liberate," bypassing recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Justifying non-engagement as "liberation"
- Allowing harmful patterns unchecked
- Dismissing recognition as unnecessary
- Missing that rang grol requires recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<self-liberation-passivity-permission> → <bypassing-justification> (non-engagement) → <recognition-dismissal> (unnecessary-effort) → <recognition-prevention-error> (passivity substitutes for awareness).

---

[6419-6437] <vision-stage-competition> <mtha'-drug-achievement-ladder>

**Misreading:**
The six limits/visions (mtha' drug) of thogal are achievements to compete for—practitioners should strive to "reach" higher stages and compare progress.

**Why it arises:**
"Six" suggests levels. Stage-language implies hierarchy. Competition culture. Achievement through advancement.

**Primary consequence:**
Thogal becomes achievement competition. Practitioners vie to "attain" higher mtha' drug stages, comparing "spiritual level" with others.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Competing over "which stage"
- Believing higher is better
- Anxiety about "falling behind"
- Missing that mtha' drug describe one display

**Cascade effects:**
<vision-stage-competition> → <competitive-hierarchy> (stage-climbing) → <comparison-anxiety> (who-is-higher) → <recognition-prevention-error> (competition substitutes for presence).

---

[6438-6456] <pure-land-spatial-goal> <zhing-khams-place-destination>

**Misreading:**
Pure lands (zhing khams) are actual places, locations, or destinations to reach through practice—geographical realities in Buddha-universe.

**Why it arises:**
"Land" suggests geography. Buddhist cosmology. Spatial thinking. Destination desire.

**Primary consequence:**
Pure land becomes spatial destination. Practitioners work toward rebirth in specific locations, treating zhing khams as places to arrive at.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Viewing pure lands as real estate
- Working for "good location" rebirth
- Creating spatial separation from purity
- Missing that zhing khams is mind-nature

**Cascade effects:**
<pure-land-spatial-goal> → <geographical-fantasy> (place-navigation) → <rebirth-location> (destination-striving) → <recognition-prevention-error> (place substitutes for nature).

---

[6457-6475] <deity-yoga-transformation-project> <lha'i-rnal-'byor-becoming-effort>

**Misreading:**
Deity yoga (lha'i rnal 'byor) is a transformation project—through sustained practice one changes from ordinary self into divine self.

**Why it arises:**
"Yoga" suggests practice. Transformation appeal. Self-improvement. Tantric methodology.

**Primary consequence:**
Deity yoga becomes self-change project. Practitioners work to "become" deity, creating duality between current and target self.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing practice transforms identity
- Creating ordinary/divine self hierarchy
- Viewing Dzogchen through tantric lens
- Missing that lha is rang snang

**Cascade effects:**
<deity-yoga-transformation-project> → <identity-project> (becoming-effort) → <self-duality> (who-I-am-vs-lha) → <recognition-prevention-error> (transformation substitutes for nature).

---

[6476-6494] <ground-foundation-metaphysics> <gzhi-base-substance>

**Misreading:**
The ground (gzhi) is a metaphysical foundation, base substance, or underlying reality supporting all manifestation.

**Why it arises:**
"Ground" suggests foundation. Metaphysical habits. Substance thinking. Support-structure language.

**Primary consequence:**
Ground becomes metaphysical substance. Practitioners search for gzhi as base reality, reifying it as existent foundation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Seeking gzhi as hidden substance
- Believing ground "supports" manifestation
- Creating base/appearance duality
- Missing that gzhi is unfindable as thing

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-foundation-metaphysics> → <substance-grasping> (foundation-belief) → <base-duality> (underlying-manifest) → <recognition-prevention-error> (metaphysics substitutes for experience).

---

[6495-6513] <path-coverage-mentality> <lam-accumulation-approach>

**Misreading:**
The path (lam) is territory to be covered through practice accumulation—more methods, more coverage, better progress.

**Why it arises:**
"Path" suggests travel. Coverage mentality. Buddhist sādhana accumulation. More-is-better thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Path becomes coverage project. Practitioners accumulate practices as "path mileage," believing quantity equals progress.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Collecting methods for coverage
- Believing variety advances progress
- Accumulation mentality
- Missing that lam is view, not territory

**Cascade effects:**
<path-coverage-mentality> → <accumulation-drive> (method-collection) → <coverage-illusion> (more-is-farther) → <recognition-prevention-error> (accumulation substitutes for view).

---

[6514-6532] <result-earning-expectation> <bras-bu-deserved-achievement>

**Misreading:**
The result ('bras bu) is earned, deserved, or merited through sufficient practice—enlightenment as reward for effort.

**Why it arises:**
"Result" implies outcome. Merit thinking. Cause-effect morality. Earning mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Result becomes earned reward. Practitioners expect 'bras bu as payment for practice, creating transactional relationship with enlightenment.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Expecting reward for practice
- Believing effort deserves result
- Transactional spirituality
- Missing that 'bras bu is already present

**Cascade effects:**
<result-earning-expectation> → <transactional-spirituality> (practice-for-payment) → <merit-accumulation> (deserving-enlightenment) → <recognition-prevention-error> (earning substitutes for being).

---

[6533-6551] <trekcho-thogal-preference-hierarchy> <khregs-chod-thod-rgal-superiority>

**Misreading:**
Thogal (thod rgal) is superior to trekcho (khregs chod)—the visionary approach is "higher" than mere cutting-through, creating value judgment between methods.

**Why it arises:**
Vision appeal. "Leap-over" sounds advanced. Elitism around thogal. Comparative thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes value hierarchy. Practitioners believe thogal is "better," creating spiritual materialism and trekcho-dismissal.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing thogal is "real" Dzogchen
- Dismissing trekcho as "beginner"
- Creating method-elitism
- Missing that both are recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-thogal-preference-hierarchy> → <value-judgment> (better-worse) → <spiritual-materialism> (wanting-best) → <recognition-prevention-error> (preference substitutes for unity).

---

[6552-6570] <spontaneous-presence-discovery> <lhun-grub-finding-mission>

**Misreading:**
Spontaneous presence (lhun grub) is something hidden that must be discovered or found through practice—a hidden quality of awareness to uncover.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous" suggests natural quality. Discovery language. Hidden treasure fantasy. Seeking mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Lhun-grub becomes discovery mission. Practitioners search for spontaneous presence as hidden thing, when it's never absent.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Searching for lhun-grub in experience
- Believing practice "reveals" it
- Creating seeker/sought duality
- Missing that lhun-grub is always present

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneous-presence-discovery> → <search-mission> (finding-lhun-grub) → <hidden-treasure-fantasy> (uncovering-quality) → <recognition-prevention-error> (discovery substitutes for nature).

---

[6571-6589] <primordial-purity-restoration-project> <ka-dag-return-effort>

**Misreading:**
Primordial purity (ka dag) is an original state before time that can be restored, returned to, or recovered through dedicated practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Primordial" suggests origin. Restoration narrative. Pre-lapsarian fantasy. Return-home desire.

**Primary consequence:**
Ka-dag becomes restoration project. Practitioners work to "return" to original purity, creating temporal dualism of then vs. now.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing oneself "exiled" from purity
- Working toward "homecoming"
- Nostalgia for pre-fall state
- Missing that ka-dag is timeless

**Cascade effects:**
<primordial-purity-restoration-project> → <homecoming-effort> (returning-pure) → <temporal-exile> (fallen-from-then) → <recognition-prevention-error> (restoration substitutes for presence).
