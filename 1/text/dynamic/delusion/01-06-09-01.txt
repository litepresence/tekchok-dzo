[8810-8813] <elaboration-hierarchy> [ELABORATE/UNELABORATE AS STAGES]
**Misreading:**
The fourfold progression (elaborate, unelaborate, very unelaborate, utterly unelaborate) is interpreted as developmental stages one advances through sequentially.

**Why it arises:**
Progressive thinking. Sequential descriptors suggest advancement. "Utterly" implies culmination.

**Primary consequence:**
Stage-climbing. The practitioner believes they progress from "elaborate" beginner to "utterly unelaborate" advanced.

**Secondary consequences:**
Progress-tracking by elaboration-level; elitism about "unelaborate" recognition; missing that all four describe simultaneous aspects.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through elaboration-stages.
<elitism-error> through hierarchy of simplicity.

[8814-8817] <sound-fetishism> [SPONTANEOUS SOUND AS MYSTICAL]
**Misreading:**
The "spontaneous sound of awareness" is interpreted as referring to literal mystical sounds or inner ringing to be listened for.

**Why it arises:**
Sensory mysticism. "Sound" suggests audible phenomenon. Seeking special experiences.

**Primary consequence:**
Listening for sounds. The practitioner seeks inner sounds believing they are the path.

**Secondary consequences:**
Tinnitus-interpretation; sound-chasing; missing that "sound" is metaphor for expression/display.

**Cascade effects:**
<experience-substantialism> through sound-fetishism.
<meditationism-error> through listening-practice.

[8818-8822] <fourfold-obsession> [OUTER/INNER/SECRET/UN SURPASSED AS LEVELS]
**Misreading:**
The fourfold structure (outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed) is interpreted as hierarchical levels with unsurpassed as "highest."

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking. "Secret" and "unsurpassed" suggest advancement. Four items invite progression.

**Primary consequence:**
Level-climbing. The practitioner seeks to advance from outer to unsurpassed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Secrecy-elitism; premature "unsurpassed" practice; missing that four describe simultaneous aspects.

**Cascade effects:**
<elitism-error> through level-hierarchy.
<practice-path-confusion> through premature advancement.

[8824-8826] <ripening-temporalization> [RIPENING AS PROCESS]
**Misreading:**
"Spontaneous ripening" is interpreted as gradual process over time like fruit ripening on a tree.

**Why it arises:**
Organic metaphor literalism. "Ripening" suggests temporal development. Natural growth models.

**Primary consequence:**
Developmental patience. The practitioner waits for "ripening" believing it takes time.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring recognition; waiting for results; missing that "ripening" is instantaneous recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through ripening-process.
<future-dependency> through waiting-for-results.

[8827-8829] <control-misunderstanding> [CONTROL AS DOMINATION]
**Misreading:**
"Appearance-control" and "existence-control" are interpreted as establishing power over phenomena or domination of samsara.

**Why it arises:**
Power-seeking. "Control" suggests mastery. Magical thinking about tantric powers.

**Primary consequence:**
Domination-ambition. The practitioner seeks to control phenomena rather than recognize their nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Power-obsession; siddhi-seeking; missing that "control" is freedom from fixation, not domination.

**Cascade effects:**
<magical-thinking> through control-fetishism.
<spiritual-materialism> through power-seeking.

[8830-8833] <bodily-channel-obsession> [BODY/SPEECH/MIND/CONSCIOUSNESS AS REQUIREMENTS]
**Misreading:**
The fourfold body/speech/mind/consciousness is interpreted as establishing four requirements that must all be engaged.

**Why it arises:**
Comprehensiveness compulsion. Four items suggest completeness. Fear of missing elements.

**Primary consequence:**
Mechanical fourfold practice. The practitioner tries to work with all four faculties simultaneously.

**Secondary consequences:**
Complexity-anxiety; mechanical engagement; missing that four describe single awareness-display.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-fetishism> through fourfold-method.
<perfectionism-paralysis> through completeness-requirement.

[8835-8839] <agricultural-metaphor-literalism> [FIELD/SEED/FRUIT AS DEVELOPMENT]
**Misreading:**
The agricultural metaphors (field, seed, sprout, flower, fruit) are interpreted as establishing developmental stages of spiritual growth.

**Why it arises:**
Organic growth model. Agricultural metaphors suggest natural development. Familiar growth tropes.

**Primary consequence:**
Developmental fixation. The practitioner believes they grow from seed to fruit over time.

**Secondary consequences:**
Progress-tracking by stage; deferring "ripeness" to future; missing that metaphors describe timeless nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through growth-stages.
<progress-tracking> through agricultural-metaphor.
