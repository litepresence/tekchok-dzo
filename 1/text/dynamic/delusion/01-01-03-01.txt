[578-583] <spatial-perception-error> <perspectival-dualism>
**Misreading:**
"Looking from inside, outside clear; looking from outside, inside clear" interpreted as describing actual visual capacity—seeing through things, X-ray vision.

**Why it arises:**
"Inside" (*nang*), "outside" (*phyi*), "looking" (*bltas*), "clear" (*gsal*) suggest vision. The phrases describe unusual seeing. Paranormal abilities fascinate.

**Primary consequence:**
The non-duality of appearance-emptiness is reduced to supernatural sight. The actual meaning—non-obstruction of awareness—is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek clairvoyance. Meditation aims for penetrating vision. The natural clarity is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <clairvoyance-seeking>, <perspectival-projection>, <visual-paranormal>, <seeing-obsession>, and <dualistic-vision>.

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 11 continues the thirty-six activities enumeration from Page 10, completing the "secret four" and beginning body/speech/mind activities. Lines 326-335 complete the body activities.

Line 336 begins speech activities which continue onto Page 12.

ERROR RISK: The detailed enumeration of marks and activities might be read as "what a Buddha has" rather than "ways to recognize uncompounded nature."

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands these enumerations as descriptive categories pointing to nature, not as checklist of accomplishments.

[584-593] <five-wisdoms-possession-error> <cognitive-entities>
**Misreading:**
The five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) interpreted as five things to acquire or possess—cognitive achievements or mental powers.

**Why it arises:**
"Five" suggests list. "Wisdoms" (*ye shes*) suggests knowledge. The text lists them (mirror-like, equality, etc.). Achievement frameworks use checklists.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom is commodified into possession. Practitioners try to "get" five wisdoms. The naturally present awareness is forgotten.

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation aims at wisdom accumulation. Teachers sell "wisdom transmission." Recognition is replaced by acquisition.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <wisdom-accumulation>, <cognitive-possession>, <achievement-checklist>, <knowledge-fetishism>, and <transmission-commerce>.

[594-603] <samadhi-concentration-effort> <meditative-achievement>
**Misreading:**
The samadhis (*ting nge 'dzin*)—non-composing, pure vision, pure dharmata, exhaustion of outflows—interpreted as meditative states to achieve through effort.

**Why it arises:**
"Samadhi" commonly means "concentration." "Achieving" (*mdzad*) suggests accomplishment. Buddhist practice includes samadhi cultivation.

**Primary consequence:**
Natural stability is turned into technique. Practitioners try to "do" samadhi. Effortless recognition is replaced by effort.

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation becomes struggle for concentration. Teachers judge students by samadhi depth. Simple awareness is overlooked.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates <concentration-effort>, <samadhi-hierarchy>, <meditative-struggle>, <achievement-measurement>, and <effort-paradox>.

[604-614] <exhaustion-outflows-purification> <contamination-cleanup>
**Misreading:**
"Exhaustion of outflows" (*zag pa zad pa*) interpreted as cleansing impurities—removing defilements, purifying contaminants.

**Why it arises:**
"Exhaustion" (*zad pa*) suggests depletion. "Outflows" (*zag pa*) suggests contamination. Purification frameworks dominate spirituality.

**Primary consequence:**
Awakening is reduced to cleaning process. Practitioners focus on removing impurities. The already-pure nature is forgotten.

**Secondary consequences:**
Endless purification practices develop. Self-purification becomes obsession. Recognition is replaced by cleansing.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <purification-obsession>, <contamination-anxiety>, <cleansing-practice>, <defilement-focus>, and <never-clean-enough>.

[615-624] <example-meaning-dichotomy> <dualistic-cognition>
**Misreading:**
"Mirror-like wisdom enjoying examples" (*me long lta bu'i ye shes kyis dpe la longs spyod pa*) interpreted as wisdom using examples to understand meaning—cognitive process of learning from illustrations.

**Why it arises:**
"Example" (*dpe*) and "meaning" (*don*) suggest pedagogical relationship. "Enjoying" (*longs spyod*) suggests consumption. Learning uses examples.

**Primary consequence:**
The non-dual display is divided into example and meaning. Wisdom becomes cognitive faculty using illustrations.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek "correct examples." Meditation uses visualizations as examples. Direct recognition is mediated.

**Cascade effects:**
Generates <example-dependency>, <cognitive-mediation>, <pedagogical-dualism>, <representationalism>, and <interpretation-obsession>.

[625-634] <emptiness-clarity-fusion-error> <substantialist-non-duality>
**Misreading:**
"Abiding as emptiness-clarity non-dual" (*gsal stong dbyer med du bzhugs pa*) interpreted as describing a special state where emptiness and clarity are fused together—like mixing two ingredients.

**Why it arises:**
"Non-dual" (*dbyer med*) negates duality but affirms something. "Emptiness" (*stong*) and "clarity" (*gsal*) sound like two things. Fusion suggests combination.

**Primary consequence:**
Non-duality is reified as "state of fusion." The inseparability is substantialized into special condition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners try to "unite" emptiness and clarity. Meditation seeks fusion experience. Natural inseparability is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <fusion-seeking>, <non-dual-substantialism>, <combination-obsession>, <synthesis-fetishism>, and <achieved-unity>.

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 12 continues from Page 11's speech activities, moving to mind activities and five wisdoms enumeration. Lines 351-355 describe mind's outer four activities. Lines 356-365 describe inner and secret four.

The page continues the thirty-six activities framework, shifting from body to speech to mind.

ERROR RISK: The progression (body → speech → mind) might be read as hierarchical ascent—mind wisdom "higher" than body marks—rather than simultaneous aspects.

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands body, speech, and mind activities as equally uncompounded, not as ladder to climb.
