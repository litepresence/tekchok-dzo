**Misreading:**
The distinction between Sravaka and Pratyekabuddha vehicles is interpreted as establishing rigid personality types, rather than recognizing fluid categories based on capacity and inclination.

**Why it arises:**
Typology fascination. The practitioner wants to identify 'which one am I?' Personality tests are popular.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner becomes fixated on vehicle-identity. 'I am a Pratyekabuddha type' becomes self-limiting belief.

**Secondary consequences:**
Flexibility is lost. The practitioner follows a rigid path based on initial assessment rather than responding to circumstances.

**Misreading:**
The 'result' of the Sravaka path—Arhatship—is understood as final extinction (nirvana with remainder) that represents a lower goal than Buddhahood.

**Why it arises:**
Mahayana superiority complex. The practitioner believes bigger goal = better. Compassion for all beings seems superior to personal liberation.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner looks down on Arhats as 'selfish' while lacking their actual attainment. Pride without substance.

**Misreading:**

**Why it arises:**

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner defers genuine recognition while working through vehicle-stages. The path becomes endless preparation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Each vehicle becomes another box to check. Recognition is perpetually deferred until 'completion' of current vehicle.

**Misreading:**

**Why it arises:**

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner dismisses Sravaka teachings as 'too basic' without having understood their profound purpose.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner rejects gradual paths in favor of 'direct' methods without proper foundation.
