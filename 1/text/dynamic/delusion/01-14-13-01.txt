[20285-20286] <epistemic-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The examples of wisdom-dissolving into light like "rainbow into space" or water-rivals into ocean are interpreted as literal processes to be experienced.

**Why it arises:**
Natural imagery triggers literal expectation. "Dissolving" suggests transformation. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate required experiences.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphorical nature of natural analogies is lost. The practitioner seeks literal dissolution-experiences. Phenomenological achievement replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Dissolution experiences" become goals. Teachers promising such experiences gain authority. The authentic recognition that dissolving is metaphorical is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 476's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by experience-seeking.

[20287-20293] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The final metaphors section triggers "almost done" mentality. The practitioner wants to "finish examples" and reach colophon.

**Why it arises:**
Proximity to absolute end creates urgency. Example-density creates fatigue. The practitioner wants "closure."

**Primary consequence:**
The integration-function of final examples is missed. The practitioner has "read" examples without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern to the very end. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached as "just final words."

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 476's completion is not contextualized. Arriving at PAGE 479 without integration, the practitioner misses dedication's essential power.

[20294-20300] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The "arrow of great measure" (dpag chen gyi mda') metaphor for non-returning is interpreted as literal description of irreversible attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Irreversibility-language triggers permanence-association. "Arrow" suggests trajectory. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate irreversible status.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphorical nature of non-returning is lost. Irreversible-status becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition is reversible.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Non-returner" becomes exclusive identity. Return-possibility is feared. The authentic recognition that returning is concept is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 479's colophon. The practitioner has "achieved" non-returning conceptually without recognition.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The example-literalism on this page carries to PAGE 476's completion. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with example-knowledge but without recognition.

[20301-20305] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between "deity yoga illusory body" (yi dam lha'i sgyu lus) and "dharmata bardo" (chos nyid bar do) is interpreted as establishing two ontologically different experiences with dzogchen's being superior.

**Why it arises:**
Comparative structure triggers hierarchy-assumption. "Dharmata" suggests authenticity. The practitioner wants superior experience.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-available-in-both nature is lost. Dharmata-bardo becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes deity yoga is inferior.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Dharmata practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Deity yoga practitioners are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that both point to same nature is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Ontological distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "chosen" dharmata over deity yoga conceptually.

[20306-20311] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between "natural nirmanakaya pure lands" (rang bzhin sprul sku'i zhing) and "travel-accomplished Buddha fields" (mas bgrod) is interpreted as establishing two classes of pure lands with natural being superior.

**Why it arises:**
"Natural" triggers authenticity-association. Comparative language suggests value. The practitioner wants "natural" attainment.

**Primary consequence:**
The equal-nature of all pure land is lost. Natural-pure-land becomes elitist destination. The practitioner believes accomplished-pure-lands are inferior.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Natural-pure-land practitioner" becomes superior identity. Travel-accomplishers are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that all pure lands are mind is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 477-478's comparisons. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "attained" natural-pure-land conceptually.

[20312-20316] <epistemic-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The comparison of "thigle of light-essence" ('od gsal gyi thig le) versus "rainbow thigle from wind-mind binding" (rlung sems bzung ba'i 'ja' 'od kyi thig le) is interpreted as establishing correct versus incorrect thigle experiences.

**Why it arises:**
Comparison suggests evaluation. "Essence" suggests authenticity. The practitioner wants "correct" thigle.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-nature of all thigle is lost. The practitioner judges thigle-experiences by origin. Authenticity-anxiety replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Essence-thigle practitioners" become orthodox. Wind-mind-thigle is deemed deviation. The authentic recognition that all thigles are appearances is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] carries to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Thigle-distinctions become deviation-sources. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is anxious about thigle-authenticity.

[20317-20322] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The final comparison section triggers "one more section before colophon" mentality. The practitioner rushes through comparisons to reach the end.

**Why it arises:**
Final-section urgency creates momentum. Comparison-density creates fatigue. The practitioner wants "done."

**Primary consequence:**
The humbling function of comparison-teaching is missed. The practitioner has "read" comparisons without being humbled. Information substitutes for transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern to colophon. Dedication is dismissed as "final formality."

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs are not contextualized. Arriving at PAGE 479 without integration, the practitioner misses dedication's power.

[20323-20328] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The "similar in appearance but different in recognition" principle is interpreted as establishing dzogchen's unique possession of subtle discernment technology.

**Why it arises:**
"Subtle" suggests sophistication. "Different" suggests special knowledge. The practitioner wants superior discernment.

**Primary consequence:**
The universal-availability of recognition is lost. Subtle-discernment becomes dzogchen-exclusive. Elitism emerges around "having discernment."

**Secondary consequences:**
"Discerning practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Others are deemed "discernment-lacking." The authentic recognition that discernment is not possession is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 477-478's 'dra'o 'dra'o verses. Discernment is reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "discerned" without recognition.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The comparison-elitism on this page carries to PAGE 477-478's 'dra'o 'dra'o elaboration. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with comparison-superiority.

[20329-20334] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The sixteen 'dra'o 'dra'o (similar, similar) verses comparing mind without thought and awareness without thought, unfabricated meditation and wind-mind rest, dharmata bardo and deity illusory body, etc., are interpreted as establishing sixteen ontological distinctions accessible only to superior practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
Enumerative subtlety suggests sophistication. "Similar but mistaken" suggests fine discernment. The practitioner wants superior discrimination.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-available-without-discrimination nature is lost. Fine-discernment becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition lacks subtlety.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Subtle-discerner" becomes exclusive identity. Those missing distinctions are deemed coarse. The authentic recognition that distinctions are pedagogical tools is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 478's 'dra'o 'dra'o completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "mastered" distinctions without recognition.

[20335-20340] <epistemic-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The 'dra'o 'dra'o verses are interpreted as phenomenological catalog of subtle experiences to be cultivated.

**Why it arises:**
Phenomenological language triggers experience-association. Pairs suggest comparative experiences. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate attainments.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is replaced by experience-matching. The practitioner seeks "unfabricated mind" experience versus "wind-mind rest" experience. Achievement-anxiety consumes practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Experience-pairs become orthodoxy. Teachers validating specific experiences gain authority. The authentic recognition that experiences don't matter is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[EXPERIENCE CHASING] intensifies through PAGE 478's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by pair-chasing.

[20341-20347] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The 'nor ra re (but mistaken) refrain is interpreted as warning about sixteen specific deviations to be vigilantly avoided.

**Why it arises:**
"Mistaken" suggests error. Enumerative structure triggers anxiety. The practitioner assumes listed mistakes are real dangers.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is suffocated by mistake-monitoring. The practitioner constantly checks: "Am I mistaking unfabricated for wind-mind? Dharmata for deity?" Fear replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Mistake-paralysis sets in. Every experience is suspected. The authentic recognition that "mistake" simply means non-recognition is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] carries to PAGE 478's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is paralyzed by sixteen-fold fear.

[20348-20353] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The proximity to absolute end triggers "just finish this" mentality. The practitioner wants to "get through" final verses and reach colophon.

**Why it arises:**
Final-content urgency creates momentum. Pair-density creates fatigue. The practitioner wants "done."

**Primary consequence:**
The crucial discernment-function of 'dra'o 'dra'o is missed. The practitioner has "read" pairs without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern to colophon. Dedication is dismissed as "final words."

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 478's completion is not contextualized. Arriving at PAGE 479 without integration, the practitioner misses dedication's power.

[20354-20360] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The 'dra'o 'dra'o principle is interpreted as establishing dzogchen's unique possession of subtle error-diagnosis superior to all other traditions.

**Why it arises:**
"Subtle" suggests expertise. Sixteen-fold precision suggests diagnostic power. The practitioner wants superior diagnostic tools.

**Primary consequence:**
The universal-availability of recognition is lost. Subtle-diagnosis becomes dzogchen-exclusive. Elitism emerges around "having diagnosis."

**Secondary consequences:**
"Diagnostic practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Other traditions are deemed "diagnostically inferior." The authentic recognition that diagnosis is not realization is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 478's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "diagnosed" without recognition.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The pair-discrimination on this page carries to PAGE 478's 'dra'o 'dra'o completion. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached with diagnostic-superiority.

[20361-20372] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The remaining 'dra'o 'dra'o verses—liberation-ground ka-dag vs. practice-time ka-dag, rig pa expanding without interruption vs. empty display, etc.—are interpreted as establishing subtle ontological hierarchies.

**Why it arises:**
Comparative structure triggers ranking-assumption. "Ground" vs. "practice" suggests levels. The practitioner wants "ground" status.

**Primary consequence:**
The equal-nature of all ka-dag is lost. Ground-ka-dag becomes elitist possession. The practitioner believes practice-ka-dag is inferior.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Ground-realized" becomes exclusive identity. Practitioners are ranked by "which ka-dag they have." The authentic recognition that ka-dag is not possessible is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 479's colophon. The practitioner approaches dedication with ka-dag-hierarchy.

[20373-20384] <epistemic-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The final 'dra'o 'dra'o verses are interpreted as subtle experience-pairs to be distinguished in practice.

**Why it arises:**
Phenomenological density triggers experience-expectation. Final content suggests "last chance." The practitioner wants to "get" these experiences.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is replaced by final-experience-chasing. The practitioner seeks "rig pa expanding" versus "empty display" as experiences. Last-chance anxiety consumes practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Final-pair orthodoxy emerges. Teachers promising final-distinction validation gain authority. The authentic recognition that pairs don't matter is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[EXPERIENCE CHASING] intensifies through final verses. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by final-chasing.

[20385-20396] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The absolute final verses trigger "almost done" mentality. The practitioner wants to "finish 'dra'o 'dra'o" and reach colophon.

**Why it arises:**
Absolute-final urgency creates maximum momentum. Verse-density creates maximum fatigue. The practitioner wants "closure."

**Primary consequence:**
The integration-function of final verses is completely missed. The practitioner has "read" final 'dra'o 'dra'o without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries maximum rushed-pattern to colophon. Dedication is dismissed as "just ending."

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 479's colophon is approached without any integration of Volume 1's teachings.

[20397-20408] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The final 'nor ra re refrain is interpreted as final warning about subtlest deviations.

**Why it arises:**
Final-warning suggests maximum danger. "Mistaken" triggers final-anxiety. The practitioner fears final-errors.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is suffocated by final-mistake-monitoring. The practitioner checks: "Am I making final subtle mistake?" Final-fear replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Final-paralysis sets in. Colophon-approach is feared as "final test." The authentic recognition that there is no final test is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] carries to PAGE 479's colophon. The practitioner approaches dedication with final-fear.

[20409-20421] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The 'dra'o 'dra'o completion is interpreted as establishing dzogchen-practitioners as uniquely possessing final-subtle-discernment.

**Why it arises:**
Completion suggests mastery. Sixteen-fold subtlety suggests final-expertise. The practitioner wants final-status.

**Primary consequence:**
The emptiness-of-all-status teaching is lost. Final-subtlety becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition lacks final-subtlety.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Final-subtle practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Others are deemed "not subtle enough." The authentic recognition that subtlety is not attainment is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] carries to PAGE 479's colophon. The practitioner approaches dedication with final-elitism.

PAGE BLEED NOTE: The final-pair completion on this page carries directly to PAGE 479's colophon. The practitioner approaches the volume's end with pair-knowledge but without recognition.

[20422-20422] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The colophon statement that this is an "extremely important key point" (gnad gal po che) not to be "broadcast to all directions" (phyogs bcur thams cad la bsgrags) is interpreted as either:
(A) Elitist claim reserving secret knowledge for special beings, OR
(B) Reason to reject all secrecy as hierarchical

Both interpretations miss the pedagogical-context nature of transmission.

**Why it arises:**
Secrecy triggers polarized reactions—either elitist coveting or egalitarian rejection. "Not broadcast" triggers access-control associations. Western political frameworks assume secrecy indicates either aristocracy or oppression.

**Primary consequence:**
The protective function of transmission-timing is lost. The practitioner either hoards "secret knowledge" or indiscriminately spreads unprepared teachings. Both miss recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Either secret-club identity forms (elitist) OR anti-secret activism forms (egalitarian). Both are identities replacing recognition. The authentic understanding that restrictions protect practitioners is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] becomes total—having rushed through PAGE 461-478, the practitioner now dismisses or misappropriates the colophon's protective wisdom. Volume 1 is "completed" without integration.

[20423-20423] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The closing exhortation to "understand well and practice in the continuum" (legs par khong du chud par byas la rgyud la nyams su blangs) is interpreted as claim that realization requires accumulated practice over time.

**Why it arises:**
Process-language triggers developmental assumption. "Practice" suggests effort. "Continuum" suggests duration. Western practitioners assume temporal descriptions indicate requirements.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-already-complete nature is obscured by temporal framing. The practitioner believes understanding requires duration. Recognition is replaced by practice-accumulation.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Long practitioner" becomes senior identity. Duration-metrics replace recognition-clarity. The authentic recognition that practice doesn't produce what is already present is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] ensures that "practice in continuum" is literalized as "keep practicing over time." The practitioner carries this error into Volume 2, approaching all teachings as "requirements to fulfill over time."

[20424-20424] [COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The colophon's placement at volume's end triggers "just the conclusion" dismissal. The practitioner has "finished the real content" and treats colophon as formality.

**Why it arises:**
Positional association—final placement suggests secondary importance. "Colophon" triggers "bibliographic information" association. The practitioner wants "main teaching," not "ending details."

**Primary consequence:**
The grounding-function of colophon is completely missed. The practitioner has "completed" Volume 1 without dedication, without merit-dedication, without seal. The teaching lacks foundation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pattern of dismissal carries forward. Future colophons are also dismissed. Each volume is "completed" without completion. The Treasury remains a collection of unsealed, ungrounded fragments.

**Cascade effects:**
[COMPLETION ANXIETY] becomes chronic—the practitioner carries "just finish" mentality into Volume 2, Volume 3, and beyond. Never completing, never integrating, always rushing.

[20425-20425] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The statement "this is the extremely important key point of the Natural Great Perfection Heart Essence" (rang bzhin rdzogs pa chen po gsang ba snying tig gi gnad gal po che) is interpreted as brand-claim establishing dzogchen's superiority.

**Why it arises:**
Superlative language triggers superiority-association. "Heart essence" suggests most precious. "Important" suggests highest. The practitioner wants highest-brand.

**Primary consequence:**
The emptiness-of-all-traditions teaching is lost. Dzogchen becomes superior-brand. Recognition is replaced by brand-loyalty.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Heart-essence practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Other traditions are deemed "non-essential." The authentic recognition that all paths are equal is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] ensures Volume 2 is approached with dzogchen-superiority assumption. All comparative teachings are read hierarchically. Recognition is never found in brand-identification.

[20426-20426] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The chapter-title "Fourteenth Chapter: Establishing the Places of Support and Knowledge" is interpreted as final checkpoint confirming "completion" of Volume 1 curriculum.

**Why it arises:**
Enumerative completion suggests achievement. "Fourteenth" implies sequence-finished. The practitioner wants curriculum-completion.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-nature of all chapters is lost. Chapter-counting replaces recognition. The practitioner believes "finishing fourteen" equals progress.

**Secondary consequences:**
Chapter-completion identity forms. "I finished Volume 1" becomes achievement-claim. The authentic recognition that chapters are pedagogical tools is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] carries to Volume 2—the practitioner now chases "completing" Volume 2's chapters. Completion-anxiety replaces recognition throughout the Treasury.
