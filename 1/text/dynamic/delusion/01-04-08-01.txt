<epistemological-error> [ASPECT-CONSCIOUSNESS PLURALISM]
**Misreading:**
The first position (same number of aspects and consciousnesses) is interpreted as correct description of how perception actually works—each aspect requiring its own separate consciousness.

**Why it arises:**
Naive realism. The intuition that "what you see is what exists" supports one-to-one correspondence between appearance and knowing. Each distinct appearance seems to require distinct awareness.

**Primary consequence:**
Fragmentation of awareness. The practitioner experiences consciousness as divided into many separate knowings, losing sense of unified awareness.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dissociative experience; inability to integrate perception; analytic dissection of experience into countless "consciousness-moments."

**Cascade effects:**
<dissociation-error> through fragmenting awareness.
<ontological-reification> through multiplying consciousnesses.

<dualistic-error> [EGG-SPLIT AS CARTESIAN DUALITY]
**Misreading:**
The "split like an egg" analogy is interpreted as establishing dualism between outer aspects (objects) and inner consciousness (mind)—a representational theory where consciousness mirrors external reality.

**Why it arises:**
Cartesian conditioning. Modern cognitive framework assumes subject-object split. "Egg split" naturally maps to inner/outer division.

**Primary consequence:**
Representational theory of mind. The practitioner believes consciousness represents external objects, creating epistemological gap between appearance and reality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Skepticism about whether aspects match objects; epistemological anxiety; representational correspondence theory.

**Cascade effects:**
<subject-object-dualism> through representational theory.
<fundamental-delusion> through appearance-reality split.

<reductionist-error> [MONKEY ANALOGY AS UNIFIED SELF]
**Misreading:**
The monkey-in-tower analogy is interpreted as teaching that a single underlying self or consciousness-entity perceives all appearances—implying unified subject behind diverse experiences.

**Why it arises:**
Self-consolidation. The desire for unified identity supports interpreting single-consciousness as substantial self. Monkey represents "me" looking through windows.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying single consciousness as self. The practitioner believes there is one "me" that experiences everything through different sense doors.

**Secondary consequences:**
Substantialist view of consciousness; unified self-theory; confusing single awareness-nature with individual self.

**Cascade effects:**
<self-grasping> through unified-consciousness-as-self.
<eternalistic-error> through substantializing awareness.

<analogical-confusion> [MONKEY AS OBSERVER]
**Misreading:**
The monkey is interpreted as conscious observer moving between windows (sense doors), suggesting active perceiver behind perception.

**Why it arises:**
Agency attribution. The monkey's active "entering and looking" implies volitional observer. Can't imagine perception without perceiver.

**Primary consequence:**
Inserting observer into perception. The practitioner believes awareness requires conscious subject doing the perceiving.

**Secondary consequences:**
Infinite regress (who perceives the perceiver?); duality of observer/observed; missing that awareness is self-illuminating without observer.

**Cascade effects:**
<subject-object-dualism> through observer-observed split.
<doer-grasping> through inserting perceiver-agent.

<dream-misinterpretation> [DREAM AS ILLUSION]
**Misreading:**
The dream analogy is interpreted as teaching that waking reality is "just a dream"—illusory, unreal, insubstantial, to be dismissed or transcended.

**Why it arises:**
Illusion-fetish. Familiarity with "life is dream" trope leads to dismissive interpretation. Dream = not real in common understanding.

**Primary consequence:**
Nihilistic view of appearance. The practitioner believes waking life is illusion to be seen through, rather than appearance as appearance.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual bypassing ("it's all a dream"); dissociation from engagement; missing that dream analogy points to non-duality, not unreality.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilistic-error> through dismissing appearance.
<practice-path-confusion> through seeking "beyond the dream."

---

<ontological-confusion> [FALSE ASPECTS AS METAPHYSICAL CLAIM]
**Misreading:**
The discussion of "false aspects" (rnam rdzun pa) is interpreted as metaphysical claim about ultimate nature of reality—that all appearances are "false" in the sense of non-existent or illusory.

**Why it arises:**
Ontological literalism. "False" suggests existence-status. Philosophical traditions debate what "really exists."

**Primary consequence:**
Taking "false" as ontological denial. The practitioner believes appearances don't exist at all—extreme nihilism.

**Secondary consequences:**
Paralysis through "nothing is real"; ethical disengagement; confusing epistemological limitation with ontological negation.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilistic-error> through ontological interpretation.
<fundamental-delusion> through missing that "false" means deluded apprehension, not non-existence.

---

<hierarchical-error> [STAINED VS PURE AS VALUATION]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between "false with stain" and "stainless pure" is interpreted as value hierarchy, with pure aspects as "better" or more real than stained aspects.

**Why it arises:**
Purity-fetish. "Stainless" and "pure" suggest superiority. Spiritual traditions privilege "pure" over "stained."

**Primary consequence:**
Hierarchical dualism. The practitioner seeks "pure aspects" and rejects "stained aspects" as inferior.

**Secondary consequences:**
Purification obsession; rejection of ordinary experience; spiritual materialism of "pure perception."

**Cascade effects:**
<dualistic-grasping> through pure/stained hierarchy.
<spiritual-materialism> through seeking pure aspects.
