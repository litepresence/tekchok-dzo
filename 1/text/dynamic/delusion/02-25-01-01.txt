[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Lines 15635-15714 present the spontaneous results of Dzogchen practice—the exhaustion of phenomena into primordial purity. This is the culmination of the entire Treasury.

ERROR RISK: Readers may reduce this profound teaching on exhaustion to attainment-ambition, identity-transformation, or destination-seeking, missing that exhaustion is recognition of what always is.

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands that exhaustion (zad pa) is not destruction but recognition of nature; that all results are already present; and that "becoming Samantabhadra" is recognition of what always is, not transformation into something new.
