[10548-10550] <practice-error> [PAST FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
Reader treats Samaya - view-based commitment as a technique to be mastered through repeated application, believing that correct execution automatically produces realization.

**Why it arises:**
Skill-acquisition models from education and training unconsciously impose technique-mastery frameworks. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports mechanism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Samaya - view-based commitment is recognition, not technique, is entirely lost. Practice becomes doing rather than being.

**Secondary consequences:**
Technique accumulation replaces wisdom cultivation. Practitioners collect methods while missing the view that animates them. Practice becomes performance.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <progress tracking> and [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. All practice becomes technique-accumulation.

[10555-10559] [VIEW ERROR] [PHILOSOPHICAL FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
Reader adopts Samaya - degeneration and restoration as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Samaya - degeneration and restoration is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Conceptual pride replaces genuine recognition. Debates about positions poison communities. The intellect is fetishized over wisdom.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <ground-path-fruition temporalization>. View becomes position rather than recognition.

[10560-10564] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [EMPTINESS NIHILISM]
**Misreading:**
Reader seeks Samaya - degeneration and restoration as a specific experience to be achieved and maintained, treating it as a goal to reach.

**Why it arises:**
Sensation-seeking psychology and peak-experience culture project onto spiritual practice. The desire for verifiable attainments supports experience-fetishism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Samaya - degeneration and restoration is natural expression, not goal to achieve, is entirely abandoned. Seeking replaces finding.

**Secondary consequences:**
Experience-chasing leads to technique-switching and teacher-shopping. Disappointment when experiences fade leads to abandonment.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <progress tracking>. Subsequent experiences will be approached as achievements to collect.

[10565-10569] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [LEVEL COMPARISON]
**Misreading:**
Reader understands Samaya - degeneration and restoration as a stage in a developmental sequence, deferring completion until prerequisites are met.

**Why it arises:**
Achievement-oriented psychology and hierarchical social structures impose staircase models. The desire for measurable advancement supports stage-fixation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Samaya - degeneration and restoration is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.

**Secondary consequences:**
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <experience substantialism>. Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.

[10570-10574] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [PRESENT NEGLECT]
**Misreading:**
Reader interprets Samaya - degeneration and restoration through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.

**Why it arises:**
Linear time consciousness and developmental psychology impose sequential frameworks. The fear of missing steps drives temporal sequencing.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Samaya - degeneration and restoration is timeless, never unfolding, is entirely lost. Time-based becoming replaces timeless presence.

**Secondary consequences:**
The present moment is perpetually sacrificed to future attainment. Practice becomes preparation rather than recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers all error types. The entire framework collapses into temporal development model.
