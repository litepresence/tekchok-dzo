[10548-10550] <lhun-grub-literalism> [SPONTANEOUS COMPLETION AS AUTOMATIC]
**Misreading:**
"Spontaneously completed" (lhun gyis grub pa) is interpreted as meaning that samsara and nirvana arise automatically without cause or condition.

**Why it arises:**
Literalism toward "spontaneous." Sounds like automatic. Misunderstanding of effortless.

**Primary consequence:**
Automatic-arising belief. The practitioner believes everything happens without causes.

**Secondary consequences:**
Causality-denial; nihilism; missing that lhun grub describes how, not that there are no conditions.

**Cascade effects:**
<causal-confusion> through spontaneity-misinterpretation.
<nihilistic-error> through condition-denial.

[10551-10559] <cause-effect-collapse> [CAUSALITY DENIAL]
**Misreading:**
The refutation of cause and effect being spontaneously completed is interpreted as establishing that causality is illusory and doesn't exist.

**Why it arises:**
Nihilistic reading. "Not spontaneously completed" suggests causality is real. Extreme view.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking refutation as nihilism. The practitioner believes cause and effect don't exist.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ethical nihilism; karma-denial; missing middle way on causality.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilistic-error> through causality-denial.
<ethical-collapse> through karma-rejection.

[10555-10559] <samsara-nirvana-identity> [SAMSARA IS NIRVANA AS LICENSE]
**Misreading:**
The consequence that "samsara and nirvana would be one" is interpreted as establishing that they are literally identical, justifying indulgence in samsara.

**Why it arises:**
Identity literalism. "One" suggests sameness. Anti-nomian temptation.

**Primary consequence:**
Samsara-indulgence. The practitioner believes samsara "is" nirvana, so nothing matters.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual libertinism; practice-abandonment; missing that they're not two, not identical.

**Cascade effects:**
<ethical-nihilism> through identity-misuse.
<practice-abandonment> through samsara-justification.

[10560-10569] <scriptural-authority> [KLONG DRUG AS PROOF]
**Misreading:**
The citation from Six Expanses (Klong drug) is interpreted as scriptural proof that establishes the argument definitively.

**Why it arises:**
Authority-dependency. Scriptural citation suggests proof. Fundamentalist tendency.

**Primary consequence:**
Citation-as-proof. The practitioner believes the position is true because scripture says so.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ending inquiry; dogmatism; missing that citation illustrates, not proves.

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through scriptural-proof.
<fundamentalism> through citation-dogmatism.

[10570-10584] <metaphor-literalism> [ASH-COAL METAPHOR AS ONTOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The metaphor of black coal not becoming white through washing is interpreted as establishing that delusion cannot be transformed into wisdom.

**Why it arises:**
Metaphor literalism. Coal metaphor suggests permanence. Fatalistic reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Transformation-denial. The practitioner believes delusion is permanent and cannot be purified.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fatalism; practice-abandonment; missing that metaphor illustrates conditionality, not permanence.

**Cascade effects:**
<fatalism> through metaphor-literalism.
<transformation-denial> through coal-metaphor.

[10585-10597] <dependent-origination-misunderstanding> [CONDITIONALITY AS UNCERTAINTY]
**Misreading:**
The statement that essence is not established and is uncertain is interpreted as establishing that everything is random or chaotic.

**Why it arises:**
"Not established" suggests randomness. "Uncertain" implies chaos. Missing dependent origination.

**Primary consequence:**
Randomness-belief. The practitioner believes things happen without pattern or reason.

**Secondary consequences:**
Chaos-view; missing order; confusion about dependent origination.

**Cascade effects:**
<confusion-error> through randomness-interpretation.
<dependent-origination-misunderstanding> through uncertainty-misreading.

[10594-10597] <one-many-obsession> [UNITY VS PLURALITY DEBATE]
**Misreading:**
The philosophical argument about one vs many is interpreted as establishing metaphysical position on whether basis is singular or plural.

**Why it arises:**
Metaphysical thinking. One/many debate suggests ontology. Philosophical fixation.

**Primary consequence:**
Ontological position-taking. The practitioner believes basis is either one or many.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that basis transcends numbers; philosophical debate; conceptual fixation.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through number-position.
<philosophical-fixation> through one-many debate.
