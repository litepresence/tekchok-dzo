[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, LINEAR ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text lists the twelve links: "Samsara all-by-means-of first not-distinguish make-not-possess nature from object grasp-by-means-of object arise and thought grasp from different appear object grasp connection twelve-as samsara first." A reader might think: "These are the twelve stages of samsara I need to understand in sequence. If I can trace them backward, I can reverse samsara."

**Why it arises:**
Lists trigger sequential thinking. Western linear minds want to follow the chain. Reversibility suggests the chain can be undone through understanding.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner traces the twelve links linearly, seeking to reverse them through understanding. They treat dependent origination as a reversible process.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Twelve links are memorized sequentially
2. Reversal strategy is planned
3. The circular nature is missed
4. Dzogchen congeals into linear problem-solving

**Cascade effects:**
This generates LINEAR ERROR (sequential thinking) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (understanding chain) → PRACTICE ERROR (reversal strategy). The practitioner tries to walk backward up the chain.

[12511-12525] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, PROCESS ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes bardo and death: "life one even light clear sets samsara bardo appearance-moment first self face not-know is ignorance outer breath cut time die by that interval dependent-origination manner enters." A reader might think: "This is describing the actual process of death and bardo entry. I need to prepare for this process so I can recognize at death."

**Why it arises:**
Death and bardo are existentially compelling. Westerners fear death and want preparation. sounds like a map of the dying process to master.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner produces death-preparation practices, trying to memorize the bardo stages. They anxiously prepare for future recognition at death.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Present recognition is abandoned for future preparation
2. Death anxiety drives practice
3. Bardo is feared as real transition
4. Living recognition is missed while preparing for dying

**Cascade effects:**
This generates PROCESS ERROR (death preparation) → PRACTICE ERROR (bardo memorization) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (future recognition). The practitioner lives for their death.

[12526-12540] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, NIHILISTIC ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "aggregates five and faculties five limbs five and essences five objects five and afflictions five minds five mentals five thoughts five grasped-grasper samsara accomplished." A reader might think: "All these fives are just constructions that accomplish samsara. None of them really exist. I should dismiss all these lists as empty."

**Why it arises:**
The repeated "five" and "accomplished" suggests fabrication. Western nihilists dismiss all lists as empty constructions. sounds like it's saying samsara is just made-up.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner dismisses all the five-fold lists as empty constructions, rejecting the detailed analysis. They use emptiness to avoid engaging with the teaching.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Lists are rejected without understanding
2. Nihilism masquerades as emptiness
3. Precise analysis is abandoned
4. Dzogchen congeals into dismissal

**Cascade effects:**
This generates NIHILISTIC ERROR (dismissing all) → PRACTICE ERROR (avoiding analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (nihilism as wisdom). The practitioner emptily dismisses everything.

[12541-12556] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ELEMENTAL ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text lists "Earth water fire wind sky also element great that from arise god and demigod human and hell animal hungry-great that from correctly arise." A reader might think: "These elements are the actual building blocks of realms. I need to understand how elements create realms to master manifestation."

**Why it arises:**
Elements suggest primal forces to harness. Western occult and elemental traditions seek elemental mastery. seems to offer a cosmology of elemental creation.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner studies elements as creative forces, seeking to understand how they produce realms. They try to work with elements spiritually.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Elements are reified as forces
2. Realm creation congeals into project
3. Natural manifestation is manipulated
4. Dzogchen congeals into elemental magic

**Cascade effects:**
This generates ELEMENTAL ERROR (force fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (elemental work) → REIFICATION ERROR (elements as powers). The practitioner petrifies into an elemental magician.

[12557-12572] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, IGNORANCE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes "ignorance six-as arise" including root mind ignorance, delusion object ignorance, delusion-basis ignorance, grasp thought ignorance, remedy path ignorance, and not-know confuse ignorance. A reader might think: "These are six types of ignorance I need to identify and eliminate. Each requires a specific antidote."

**Why it arises:**
Taxonomies suggest specific problems needing specific solutions. Western problem-solvers want to address each ignorance type. Six types suggest a system to master.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner categorizes their ignorance into six types, seeking to eliminate each. They create a project of ignorance-eradication.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Ignorance petrifies into enemy
2. Six-fold strategy is developed
3. Self-liberation is replaced with eradication
4. Dzogchen congeals into ignorance-management

**Cascade effects:**
This generates IGNORANCE ERROR (fighting ignorance) → PRACTICE ERROR (six-fold eradication) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (ignorance as enemy). The practitioner wages war on their own confusion.

[12573-12588] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR, OBJECT ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text asks "Delusion what-by-means-of delude object before world not-arise only when wish-fulfilling tree spread called." A reader might think: "Delusion happens through objects. Before the world arose, there was no delusion. I need to understand how objects delude the mind."

**Why it arises:**
"Object" suggests external things causing delusion. Western mind-object dualism assumes objects affect subjects. The question sounds like epistemological inquiry.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner investigates how objects delude, creating a theory of object-delusion. They try to free mind from object-influence.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Objects are blamed for delusion
2. Subject-object dualism is reinforced
3. World is rejected as delusive
4. Dzogchen congeals into idealism

**Cascade effects:**
This generates OBJECT ERROR (blaming objects) → PSYCHOLOGIZATION ERROR (mind-object theory) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (subject-object split). The practitioner tries to live without objects.

[12589-12605] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, CERTAINTY ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes "Certainty put mind object I-by-means-of object is think-by-means-of consciousness-by-means-of grasp-by-means-of that to attachment arise-by-means-of certainty put called." A reader might think: "This is describing how certainty-fixation arises through grasping. I need to avoid certainty to stay open."

**Why it arises:**
"Certainty" sounds like rigidity to avoid. Western postmodernists reject certainty. seems to warn against fixation.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner avoids all certainty, seeking permanent openness. They reject confidence and conviction as fixations.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. All certainty is rejected
2. Openness congeals into fixation
3. Genuine confidence is abandoned
4. Dzogchen congeals into permanent uncertainty

**Cascade effects:**
This generates CERTAINTY ERROR (rejecting conviction) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (confusing confidence with fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (permanent openness). The practitioner congeals into confidently uncertain.

[12606-12615] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR, OBSCURATION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "Mind six gather-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of path obscure and that also mind-by-means-of wisdom not-see and clear not-give wisdom to thought not-possess mind from move-maker exist-by-means-of cause Buddha-by-means-of path obscure is." A reader might think: "Mind obscures wisdom and Buddha-path. I need to stop mind from moving to clear the path. This is a practice of mind-stopping."

**Why it arises:**
"Mind obscures" suggests mind is the problem to solve. Westerners seek to stop thinking. seems to instruct mind-cessation.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner produces mind-stopping practices, trying to cease mental activity to reveal wisdom. They battle mind as obstacle.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Mind is rejected as enemy
2. Stopping congeals into fixation
3. Natural wisdom is missed in suppression
4. Dzogchen congeals into anti-mind warfare

**Cascade effects:**
This generates OBSCURATION ERROR (mind as enemy) → PRACTICE ERROR (stopping mind) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (mind vs wisdom dualism). The practitioner tries to kill their mind.

[12616-12625] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, COSMOLOGICAL ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "ignorance sentient-being-by-means-of delusion manner and first spontaneous from self arise and self face not-know-by-means-of awareness from." A reader might think: "This is the actual cosmology of how delusion began—first spontaneous presence, then not-knowing self-face. I need to understand this origin story."

**Why it arises:**
Origin stories fascinate Westerners. The "first" suggests a beginning to understand. Cosmological narratives feel like deep truth.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner studies the delusion cosmology as literal history, seeking to understand "how it all began." They reify the narrative as actual temporal sequence.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Cosmology is taken as literal history
2. The present is abandoned for origins
3. Narrative replaces recognition
4. Dzogchen congeals into mythology

**Cascade effects:**
This generates COSMOLOGICAL ERROR (literal cosmology) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (origin for understanding) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (reified beginning). The practitioner studies the fall from grace.

[12626-12636] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, HISTORICAL ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text lists specific delusions: "Field Broad called from delude place Beautiful called from delude time when destroyed and delude year Pig year to delude sun Created sun to delude." A reader might think: "These are specific historical or astrological conditions that cause delusion. I need to avoid these times, places, and conditions."

**Why it arises:**
Specific details (Pig year, etc.) suggest actionable information. Western astrologers and diviners seek to avoid inauspicious conditions. seems to warn about specific dangers.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner avoids specific times, places, and conditions mentioned, believing they cause delusion. They try to control circumstances.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. External conditions are blamed
2. Avoidance congeals into superstition
3. Internal recognition is abandoned
4. Dzogchen congeals into divination

**Cascade effects:**
This generates HISTORICAL ERROR (circumstantial avoidance) → PRACTICE ERROR (superstitious control) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (external causation). The practitioner congeals as a spiritual weathervane.

[12637-12646] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ARMY ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes "Friend four do then wild-man five arise then back-support one arise then thief one arise that all accumulate-by-means-of one arise that etc. army collection measure-not-possess arise." A reader might think: "These are actual negative forces—wild men, thieves, armies—that arise to obstruct practice. I need protection from these forces."

**Why it arises:**
Dramatic imagery (wild-men, thieves, armies) suggests real dangers. Westerners want protection from negative forces. seems to describe obstacles to overcome.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner reifies the "army" as actual obstructing forces, seeking protection and methods to defeat them. They engage in spiritual warfare.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Forces are treated as real enemies
2. Protection rituals are sought
3. The empty nature is missed
4. Dzogchen congeals into exorcism

**Cascade effects:**
This generates ARMY ERROR (obstacle fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (spiritual warfare) → REIFICATION ERROR (forces as real). The practitioner battles imaginary armies.

[12647-12657] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SEQUENTIAL ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury from spontaneous appearance manner door from samsara-nirvana divergence show section nine thus expanse appearance from liberation delusion sequence show." A reader might think: "The text is organized in nine sections showing sequences of divergence and liberation. I need to follow this sequence to understand the teaching."

**Why it arises:**
"Section nine" and "sequence" suggest progressive organization. Western textbook learners want to follow the sequence. seems to offer a path through the material.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner treats the nine sections as a sequence to progress through, believing understanding comes from following the order.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Sequential reading replaces recognition
2. Later sections are postponed
3. Present understanding is delayed
4. Dzogchen congeals into curriculum

**Cascade effects:**
This generates SEQUENTIAL ERROR (following order) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (sequence for understanding) → PRACTICE ERROR (progressive study). The practitioner reads the book instead of recognizing.

[12658-12668] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, COMMENTARY ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text begins "That-by-means-of commentary-in thus very wonder arise and think not-possess-by-means-of object Buddha that." A reader might think: "This is a commentary explaining the Buddha's inconceivable object. I need to study this commentary carefully to understand what cannot be thought."

**Why it arises:**
"Commentary" suggests explanation of something difficult. Western scholars trust commentaries to clarify. The paradox of explaining the inexplicable seems profound.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner studies the commentary as explanation, believing understanding comes from analysis. They miss that commentary points rather than explains.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Commentary petrifies into explanation
2. The inexplicable is approached conceptually
3. Direct pointing is replaced with study
4. Dzogchen congeals into commentary on commentary

**Cascade effects:**
This generates COMMENTARY ERROR (studying explanations) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (infinite regression) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (understanding for recognition). The practitioner reads about what cannot be thought.

[12669-12679] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MIRROR ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text quotes Vajrasattva heart mirror tantra: "Realm-three-by-means-of sentient-being this all basis what-also not-possess from what-also delude basis that essence empty nature-by-means-of clear." A reader might think: "the ground is like a mirror—empty essence, clear nature. I need to become like a mirror to reflect all realms without possessing them."

**Why it arises:**
Mirror metaphors are compelling and concrete. Westerners want to become mirror-like. suggests a state to achieve.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner attempts to become "mirror-like," trying to reflect without possessing. They reify mirroring as a practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Mirror congeals into meditation object
2. Reflection is practiced
3. Natural clarity is obscured
4. Dzogchen congeals into mirror maintenance

**Cascade effects:**
This generates MIRROR ERROR (mirror practice) → PRACTICE ERROR (trying to reflect) → REIFICATION ERROR (mirror as state). The practitioner polishes their mirror.

[12680-12690] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, COMPASSION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "Compassion sentient-being to appear capacity possess that to grasp-maker-by-means-of consciousness ignorance part from arise." A reader might think: "Compassion has capacity for sentient beings but gets turned into grasping consciousness. I need to keep compassion pure without letting it become ignorance."

**Why it arises:**
"Compassion" is valued in Buddhism. that compassion congeals into ignorance is shocking. Westerners want to protect compassion from corruption.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner tries to maintain "pure compassion" without letting it become grasping, creating a purity project around compassion.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Compassion is monitored for purity
2. Grasping is rejected
3. Natural compassion is constrained
4. Dzogchen congeals into compassion policing

**Cascade effects:**
This generates COMPASSION ERROR (purity project) → PRACTICE ERROR (monitoring compassion) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (pure vs impure compassion). The practitioner guards their heart.

[12691-12702] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, CONDITION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes "That also condition basis-by-means-of delude and end also condition four to touch cause object-possessor-as grasp-by-means-of condition from." A reader might think: "Conditions cause delusion. I need to understand the four conditions so I can avoid or transcend them."

**Why it arises:**
"Condition" suggests cause to control. Western problem-solvers want to manage conditions. Four conditions seem like a system to master.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner studies the four conditions as causes to avoid, seeking to transcend conditions entirely.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Conditions are treated as obstacles
2. Transcendence congeals into escape
3. Conditional reality is rejected
4. Dzogchen congeals into condition-free state

**Cascade effects:**

The text states "End self-by-means-of appearance self condition-by-means-of basis to return two-as not-possess-by-means-of appearance self arise-as not-know and delusion to master-as grasp-by-means-of master condition." A reader might think: "The self appears through conditions and returns to basis. I need to let self return to basis to end delusion."

**Why it arises:**
"Return to basis" sounds like going home. Westerners want to return to source. The self's return suggests a journey to complete.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner produces a practice of "returning self to basis," trying to dissolve self into ground.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Return is pursued as goal
2. Self is rejected for basis
3. Natural self-liberation is replaced with journey
4. Dzogchen congeals into homeward bound

**Cascade effects:**
This generates SELF-ERROR (return project) → PRACTICE ERROR (dissolving self) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (self vs basis dualism). The practitioner tries to go home.

[12713-12722] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, LIGHT-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "Object-by-means-of object self light outside arise from master condition mirror and face and light and awareness and reality three-as understand-by-means-of master condition called." A reader might think: "Light arises from objects outside. I need to understand how light, awareness, and reality work as the master condition. This is a teaching on light metaphysics."

**Why it arises:**
"Light" metaphors suggest spiritual illumination. Western esoteric traditions work with light. The three-fold analysis seems like metaphysics to study.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner studies light, awareness, and reality as a metaphysical system, trying to understand the "master condition."

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Light petrifies into metaphysical principle
2. System is analyzed intellectually
3. Natural clarity is obscured
4. Dzogchen congeals into light metaphysics

**Cascade effects:**
This generates LIGHT-ERROR (metaphysical light) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (system analysis) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (light as principle). The practitioner studies illumination.

[12723-12732] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, RIPENING-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "That two-by-means-of ripen body-by-means-of make accumulate different arise and mind-by-means-of cause make-by-means-of perception object different-by-means-of." A reader might think: "Through these two, body ripens and accumulations are made. I need to understand the ripening process to complete the path."

**Why it arises:**
"Ripen" suggests maturation over time. Western developmental psychology understands growth. seems to describe a maturation process.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner pursues "ripening" as developmental process, seeking to mature and complete accumulations.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Ripening is awaited
2. Accumulations are gathered
3. Natural perfection is delayed
4. Dzogchen congeals into ripening project

**Cascade effects:**
This generates RIPENING-ERROR (developmental thinking) → PRACTICE ERROR (maturation project) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (unripe vs ripe). The practitioner waits to mature.

[12733-12743] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, CHAIN-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text lists dependent origination: "that from object from utilize is touch that from joy sorrow middle three arise is feeling that from bliss to attached and suffering not-desiring knowing is craving." A reader might think: "This is the chain of dependent origination I need to break. If I can stop at any link, I can stop samsara."

**Why it arises:**
Chains suggest links to break. Western engineers want to break causal chains. Dependent origination is seen as mechanism to interrupt.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner tries to "break the chain" at various links, seeking to stop dependent origination.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Chain is treated as machine to stop
2. Links are targeted for interruption
3. Natural flow is resisted
4. Dzogchen congeals into chain-breaking

**Cascade effects:**
This generates CHAIN-ERROR (mechanistic interruption) → PRACTICE ERROR (breaking links) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (chain as machine). The practitioner congeals as a chain-breaker.

[12744-12751] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, CLOUD-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "that-also base and base-appearance both to ignorance none although cloud like adventitiously arise by-means-of condition made impure samsara like appear doorway cause made." A reader might think: "Base and appearances are without ignorance but clouds appear adventitiously. I need to see through these clouds to the clear sky of the base."

**Why it arises:**
Cloud-sky metaphors are vivid and common. Westerners immediately grasp the metaphor. "Seeing through" seems like the practice.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner tries to "see through" adventitious clouds to the clear base, creating a practice of penetration.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Clouds are rejected for sky
2. Seeing-through is practiced
3. Adventitious is denied
4. Dzogchen congeals into weather watching

**Cascade effects:**
This generates CLOUD-ERROR (metaphor fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeing through) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (clouds vs sky dualism). The practitioner waits for clear skies.

[12752-12759] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ELEMENT-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text lists "Earth water fire wind sky also element great that from arise god and demigod human and hell animal hungry-great that from correctly arise." A reader might think: "These are the five great elements from which all realms arise. I need to understand elemental cosmology to understand manifestation."

**Why it arises:**
Elements suggest fundamental building blocks. Western science and occult study elements. Cosmology seems like deep knowledge.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner studies five-element cosmology as explanation for manifestation, seeking elemental understanding.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Elements are reified as causes
2. Cosmology congeals into fixation
3. Natural arising is analyzed away
4. Dzogchen congeals into elemental science

**Cascade effects:**
This generates ELEMENT-ERROR (cosmological fixation) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (elemental analysis) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (elements as causes). The practitioner petrifies into an elemental scientist.

[12760-12767] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, IGNORANCE-TYPE-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes six types of ignorance: "ignorance six-as arise-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of appearance not-know said root mind-by-means-of ignorance and delusion object-by-means-of ignorance and delusion-basis basis-by-means-of ignorance and." A reader might think: "These are six specific ignorances with different causes. I need to identify which type I have and apply the appropriate remedy."

**Why it arises:**
Typologies suggest diagnosis and treatment. Western medicine treats by type. Six ignorances seem like conditions to diagnose.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner diagnoses their ignorance type, seeking specific remedies for each category.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Self is analyzed into ignorance types
2. Remedies are applied specifically
3. Natural wisdom is obscured by diagnosis
4. Dzogchen congeals into spiritual medicine

**Cascade effects:**
This generates IGNORANCE-TYPE-ERROR (diagnostic fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (type-specific remedies) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (ignorances as entities). The practitioner congeals into their own diagnostician.

[12768-12776] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, TREE-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text mentions "wish-fulfilling tree spread called Buddha youth vase body-by-means-of blessing from arise-by-means-of tree and egg from arise-by-means-of heat and moisture from hatch one exist." A reader might think: "This is describing cosmogony—how the world arose from a wish-fulfilling tree through heat and moisture. This is mythology to understand."

**Why it arises:**
Cosmogonic myths fascinate Westerners. Origin stories feel like deep truth. The tree metaphor suggests creation mythology.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner studies the cosmogony as literal creation myth, seeking to understand world-origins.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Myth is taken as history
2. Origins are sought
3. Present recognition is abandoned
4. Dzogchen congeals into mythology

**Cascade effects:**
This generates TREE-ERROR (cosmogonic literalism) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (origin for understanding) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (myth as history). The practitioner studies creation.

[12777-12785] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ELEMENT-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text lists "Earth water fire wind sky also element great that from arise god and demigod human and hell animal hungry-great that from correctly arise." A reader might think: "These five elements are the actual building blocks from which all realms physically manifest. Understanding elemental cosmology is key to understanding how samsara is constructed."

**Why it arises:**
The concrete enumeration of elements and realms suggests a physical cosmology. Western materialist and pagan traditions work with elemental forces. The systematic correspondence feels like hidden knowledge.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner studies the five elements as metaphysical forces generating realms, attempting to work with elemental energies. They reify elements as primal powers.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Elements are approached as forces to harness
2. Realm manifestation congeals into engineering
3. Natural purity is obscured by elemental work
4. Dzogchen congeals into elemental magic

**Cascade effects:**
This generates ELEMENT-ERROR (elemental reification) → PRACTICE ERROR (elemental manipulation) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (elements as causal). The practitioner petrifies into an elemental magician.

[12786-12794] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, IGNORANCE-TAXONOMY-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text catalogs six ignorances arising through different modes: root mind, delusion object, delusion-basis, grasp thought, remedy path, and not-know confuse. A reader might think: "These are six distinct types of ignorance with specific characteristics. I need to diagnose which types afflict me and apply targeted remedies."

**Why it arises:**
Taxonomies promise precision and control. Western psychology diagnoses by type. The six-fold classification suggests personalized treatment.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner analyzes their experience for these six ignorance types, seeking to categorize and eliminate each specifically.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Experience is fragmented into types
2. Remedies are tailored to diagnoses
3. Natural self-liberation is replaced with treatment
4. Dzogchen congeals into spiritual medicine

**Cascade effects:**
This generates IGNORANCE-TAXONOMY-ERROR (diagnostic fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (type-specific treatments) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (ignorances as entities). The practitioner congeals as a spiritual diagnostician.

[12795-12803] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, COSMOGONY-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes the wish-fulfilling tree, Buddha's blessing, eggs, heat and moisture, and the arising of world systems. A reader might think: "This is the actual cosmogony—how the universe literally began. Understanding this creation story reveals the deepest truth about reality."

**Why it arises:**
Origin narratives satisfy existential curiosity. Westerners seek creation stories. The vivid imagery suggests mythic truth about beginnings.

**Primary consequence:**
This reading interprets the cosmogony as literal history, studying how the world began instead of recognizing its nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Myth is taken as historical fact
2. Present recognition is postponed for origin-understanding
3. Narrative replaces direct pointing
4. Dzogchen congeals into mythology

**Cascade effects:**
This generates COSMOGONY-ERROR (literal myth) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (origin for understanding) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (myth as history). The practitioner studies the beginning instead of recognizing.

[12804-12813] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, MIND-CATEGORY-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text lists various minds: "Ignorance and equal mind and mind consciousness mind and all seek mind and certainty put mind and aspect coarse mind and definitely place mind." A reader might think: "These are distinct categories of mind I need to identify in my experience. Understanding these categories will clarify my mental landscape."

**Why it arises:**
Categorical lists suggest typologies to master. Western psychology categorizes mental states. The detailed enumeration promises comprehensive understanding.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner categorizes their mental states according to these types, seeking to map their mind completely.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Mind is fragmented into categories
2. Experience is analyzed rather than recognized
3. Natural clarity is obscured by mapping
4. Dzogchen congeals into mental cartography

**Cascade effects:**
This generates MIND-CATEGORY-ERROR (typological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (mental mapping) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (minds as separate entities). The practitioner draws maps of their mind.

[12814-12824] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, TIME-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "Time to certainty not-possess-by-means-of time before after mutually conflict-by-means-of equal immediate condition self place liberate." A reader might think: "Time is uncertain and conflicted. I need to escape time into the immediate condition where past and future don't exist."

**Why it arises:**
Time anxiety is universal in modernity. of temporal conflict triggers desire for timelessness. "Immediate" promises escape from duration.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner seeks to escape temporal experience into an eternal present, rejecting time as obstacle.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Time is rejected as impure
2. "Immediate" petrifies into timeless state
3. Natural unfolding is denied
4. Dzogchen congeals into escapism

**Cascade effects:**
This generates TIME-ERROR (temporal rejection) → PRACTICE ERROR (seeking timelessness) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (timeless vs temporal). The practitioner tries to stop the clock.

[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, DEPENDENT-ORIGINATION-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes dependent origination through twelve links from ignorance to aging-dying. A reader might think: "This is the mechanism of samsara. If I can understand and break any link, I can stop the whole process."

**Why it arises:**
Mechanistic explanations appeal to Western engineering minds. The chain metaphor suggests weak links to target. Understanding seems like control.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner analyzes dependent origination mechanically, seeking to identify and break specific links in the chain.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Dependent origination is treated as machine
2. Intervention points are targeted
3. Natural flow is resisted
4. Dzogchen congeals into mechanical engineering

**Cascade effects:**
This generates DEPENDENT-ORIGINATION-ERROR (mechanistic thinking) → PRACTICE ERROR (link-breaking) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (samsara as machine). The practitioner congeals as a spiritual mechanic.

[12837-12848] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, BARDO-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes the bardo process: "life one even light clear sets samsara bardo appearance-moment first self face not-know is ignorance outer breath cut time die by that interval dependent-origination manner enters." A reader might think: "This is the actual process of death and bardo I will experience. I must prepare now so I can recognize when it happens."

**Why it arises:**
Death is universally feared. The detailed description promises preparation. Future-oriented Westerners want to plan for death.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner anxiously prepares for death and bardo, trying to memorize the stages for future recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Present recognition is abandoned for future preparation
2. Death anxiety drives practice
3. Bardo is feared as real transition
4. Living is missed while preparing for dying

**Cascade effects:**
This generates BARDO-ERROR (future fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (death preparation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (future recognition). The practitioner lives for their death.

[12849-12860] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, EMPTY-FIVE-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text lists "aggregates five and faculties five limbs five and essences five objects five and afflictions five minds five mentals five thoughts five grasped-grasper samsara accomplished." A reader might think: "All these fives are just empty constructions. None of them are real. I should dismiss all this analysis as mere samsaric fabrication."

**Why it arises:**
The repetitive "five" and "accomplished" suggests empty construction. Western nihilists use emptiness to dismiss. The lists seem like mere enumeration.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner dismisses all five-fold analysis as empty fabrication, missing the precise pointing within the enumeration.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Lists are rejected without understanding
2. Nihilism masquerades as emptiness wisdom
3. Detailed analysis is abandoned
4. Dzogchen congeals into dismissal

**Cascade effects:**
This generates EMPTY-FIVE-ERROR (nihilistic dismissal) → PRACTICE ERROR (avoiding analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (emptiness as rejection). The practitioner emptily dismisses all.

[12861-12869] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, ELEMENTAL-ORIGIN-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "Earth water fire wind sky also element great that from arise god and demigod human and hell animal hungry-great that from correctly arise." A reader might think: "These elements are the actual primordial substances from which all existence physically manifests. Mastering the elements means mastering manifestation."

**Why it arises:**
Elemental metaphysics appeals to Western esoteric traditions. The systematic correspondence between elements and realms suggests hidden natural laws. Physicalist thinking seeks material causes.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner treats the five elements as metaphysical forces generating reality, attempting to harness elemental power for spiritual ends.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Elements are reified as causal forces
2. Realm manifestation congeals into control project
3. Natural purity is obscured by elemental work
4. Dzogchen congeals into elemental sorcery

**Cascade effects:**
This generates ELEMENTAL-ORIGIN-ERROR (force reification) → PRACTICE ERROR (elemental manipulation) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (elements as creative powers). The practitioner petrifies into an elemental sorcerer.

[12870-12879] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, SIX-IGNORANCE-DIAGNOSIS-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text enumerates six ignorances: "ignorance six-as arise root mind-by-means-of ignorance and delusion object-by-means-of ignorance and delusion-basis basis-by-means-of ignorance and grasp thought-by-means-of ignorance and remedy path-by-means-of ignorance and not-know confuse-by-means-of ignorance." A reader might think: "These are six distinct pathologies of mind requiring specific diagnoses and treatments. I need to identify which afflict me."

**Why it arises:**
Medical typologies promise precision healing. Western diagnostic culture categorizes dysfunction. The six-fold classification invites self-analysis.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner diagnostically examines their experience for these six ignorance types, seeking targeted interventions.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Experience is medicalized into pathologies
2. Remedies are prescribed by diagnosis
3. Natural self-liberation is replaced with treatment
4. Dzogchen congeals into spiritual pathology

**Cascade effects:**
This generates SIX-IGNORANCE-DIAGNOSIS-ERROR (pathological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (targeted interventions) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (ignorances as diseases). The practitioner congeals as a spiritual psychiatrist.

[12880-12889] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, COSMOGONIC-LITERALISM-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes the wish-fulfilling tree, Buddha's blessing, eggs, heat and moisture, and world arising from Jambudvipa. A reader might think: "This is the literal account of cosmic creation. Understanding this cosmogony reveals the fundamental structure of reality."

**Why it arises:**
Origin myths satisfy existential questioning. Western literalists seek historical truth in myths. The vivid imagery suggests hidden cosmological knowledge.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner interprets the cosmogony as factual history, studying world-origins instead of recognizing mind's nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Myth historicizes
2. Present recognition is postponed for origin-knowledge
3. Narrative replaces direct pointing
4. Dzogchen congeals into creationism

**Cascade effects:**
This generates COSMOGONIC-LITERALISM-ERROR (myth as history) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (origins for truth) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (creation as fact). The practitioner studies Genesis instead of recognizing.

[12890-12899] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, MIND-TYPOLOGY-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text catalogues: "Ignorance and equal mind and mind consciousness mind and all seek mind and certainty put mind and aspect coarse mind and definitely place mind." A reader might think: "These are distinct categories of mental function I can identify in my experience. Mastering this typology gives comprehensive mind-knowledge."

**Why it arises:**
Classification systems promise mastery. Western cognitive science categorizes mental functions. The detailed typology invites academic study.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner categorizes their mental states according to this system, seeking complete mental mapping.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Mind is fragmented into categories
2. Experience is catalogued rather than recognized
3. Natural clarity is obscured by classification
4. Dzogchen congeals into cognitive taxonomy

**Cascade effects:**
This generates MIND-TYPOLOGY-ERROR (classificatory fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (mental cataloguing) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (mind as category-system). The practitioner congeals as a librarian of their own mind.

[12900-12905] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, PRACTICE ERROR, OBSCURATION-WARFARE-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "Mind six gather-by-means-of wisdom-by-means-of path obscure and that also mind-by-means-of wisdom not-see and clear not-give wisdom to thought not-possess mind from move-maker exist-by-means-of cause Buddha-by-means-of path obscure is." A reader might think: "Mind actively obscures wisdom and Buddha-path. I must stop mind's movement to clear the path. This requires aggressive intervention."

**Why it arises:**
"Obscure" suggests active enemy. Western spiritual warfare metaphors frame mind as opponent. The causal language implies intervention is possible.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner wages war on mind, attempting to forcefully stop its movement to reveal wisdom. They reify obscuration as enemy to defeat.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Mind is demonized as opponent
2. Aggressive suppression replaces gentle recognition
3. Natural clarity is obscured by warfare
4. Dzogchen congeals into spiritual violence

**Cascade effects:**
This generates OBSCURATION-WARFARE-ERROR (mind as enemy) → PRACTICE ERROR (aggressive suppression) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (mind vs wisdom dualism). The practitioner battles their own mind.

[12906-12911] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MYTHIC-HISTORY-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes "first spontaneous from self arise and self face not-know-by-means-of awareness from end delusion cease time later not-pure lineage cut stain what be that samsara first-last is Buddha last not-possess." A reader might think: "This is the actual historical sequence—first spontaneous presence, then not-knowing, then delusion, then potential lineage-cutting. I need to understand this timeline."

**Why it arises:**
Sequential descriptions trigger historical thinking. Western narrative consciousness seeks timelines. The "first" and "later" suggest temporal sequence.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner interprets the description as historical timeline, trying to locate themselves in the sequence of fall and potential redemption.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Atemporal truth is temporalized
2. Present recognition is abandoned for historical understanding
3. Narrative replaces direct pointing
4. Dzogchen congeals into sacred history

**Cascade effects:**
This generates MYTHIC-HISTORY-ERROR (temporal literalism) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (history for understanding) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (fall-redemption timeline). The practitioner studies salvation history.

[12912-12917] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, ARMY-OBSTACLE-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text lists "Friend four do then wild-man five arise then back-support one arise then thief one arise that all accumulate-by-means-of one arise that etc. army collection measure-not-possess arise." A reader might think: "These are actual negative forces—wild men, thieves, armies—that arise to obstruct practice. I need protection rituals and methods to overcome them."

**Why it arises:**
Dramatic obstacle imagery suggests real dangers. Western spiritual warfare traditions battle negative forces. The accumulation into armies implies serious threat.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner reifies the "army" as actual obstructing forces, seeking protective practices and exorcisms.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Forces are treated as real enemies
2. Protection congeals into fixation
3. The empty nature is missed
4. Dzogchen congeals into spiritual combat

**Cascade effects:**
This generates ARMY-OBSTACLE-ERROR (demonological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (protective rituals) → REIFICATION ERROR (forces as real entities). The practitioner raises spiritual armies.

[12918-12923] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, SECTIONAL-SEQUENCE-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury from spontaneous appearance manner door from samsara-nirvana divergence show section nine thus expanse appearance from liberation delusion sequence show." A reader might think: "The teaching is organized in nine sequential sections showing divergence and liberation. I must progress through these sections in order."

**Why it arises:**
Numerical organization suggests curriculum. Western educational systems follow sequences. "Section nine" implies structured progression.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner treats the nine sections as progressive curriculum, delaying understanding until completing the sequence.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Sequential reading replaces instant recognition
2. Later sections are prematurely postponed
3. Present understanding is deferred
4. Dzogchen congeals into academic course

**Cascade effects:**
This generates SECTIONAL-SEQUENCE-ERROR (curriculum fixation) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (sequence for understanding) → PRACTICE ERROR (progressive study). The practitioner takes the course instead of recognizing.

[12924-12932] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, OBSTRUCTIVE-FORCES-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text describes "Vow break action many do definitely place mind that all-by-means-of appearance to I-by-means-of be and other-by-means-of be think that definitely place mind that grasp thought-by-means-of ignorance called remedy path-by-means-of ignorance." A reader might think: "Breaking vows produces forces that grasp at appearances and self. These are actual obstructive entities generated by negative action. I need purification practices."

**Why it arises:**
Moral causality suggests generated forces. Western guilt produces fear of karmic consequences. "Definitely place mind" sounds like created entities.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner reifies broken-vow consequences as actual forces, seeking purification to eliminate them.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Guilt drives purification obsession
2. Forces are treated as real obstacles
3. Natural purity is obscured by purification
4. Dzogchen congeals into sin-management

**Cascade effects:**
This generates OBSTRUCTIVE-FORCES-ERROR (karmic literalism) → PRACTICE ERROR (purification obsession) → REIFICATION ERROR (sins as entities). The practitioner scrubs their karma.

[12933-12941] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text states "Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury from spontaneous appearance manner door from samsara-nirvana divergence show section nine thus expanse appearance from liberation delusion sequence show and now delusion manner and delusion reverse manner sequence symbol door from extensive show to eight from." A reader might think: "The text has a precise structure—nine sections on divergence, then eight doors on reversal. Understanding this architecture is essential."

**Why it arises:**
Structural analysis appeals to Western academic minds. The numerical precision suggests intentional design. Architecture implies engineering principles.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner analyzes the text's structure, believing architectural understanding reveals meaning.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Form replaces content
2. Structure is analyzed rather than recognized
3. Natural pointing is missed in architecture
4. Dzogchen congeals into structural engineering

**Cascade effects:**
This generates STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS-ERROR (architectural fixation) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (endless analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (form for content). The practitioner studies the building instead of entering.

[12942-12950] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, MULTIPLICITY-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text lists "Friend four do then wild-man five arise then back-support one arise then thief one arise that all accumulate-by-means-of one arise that etc. army collection measure-not-possess arise that etc. measure-not-possess-as delude." A reader might think: "These specific numbers—four, five, one, one—have numerological significance. I need to understand the pattern of accumulation."

**Why it arises:**
Numerical patterns suggest esoteric codes. Western numerology seeks hidden meanings. The accumulation arithmetic implies calculable process.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner analyzes the numerical pattern, seeking numerological significance in the accumulating forces.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Numbers are esotericized
2. Arithmetic replaces recognition
3. Pattern is sought in description
4. Dzogchen congeals into numerology

**Cascade effects:**
This generates MULTIPLICITY-ERROR (numerological fixation) → PRACTICE ERROR (pattern-seeking) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (numbers as powers). The practitioner counts their obstacles.

[12951-12959] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, EPISTEMIC ERROR, DELUSION-BASIS-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text concludes "That from delusion-basis not-possess from arise-by-means-of cause although there-not is basis that delusion not-possess from arise although delude." A reader might think: "Even though delusion-basis doesn't exist, it still arises as cause. This is the mystery—how non-existent basis produces apparent delusion. I need to solve this paradox."

**Why it arises:**
Paradoxes fascinate Western philosophical minds. The contradiction between "not-possess" and "arise" invites analysis. Solving paradoxes seems like wisdom.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner attempts to philosophically resolve the paradox of non-existent basis producing delusion.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. Paradox is approached intellectually
2. Resolution is sought conceptually
3. The mystery is explained away
4. Dzogchen congeals into philosophy puzzle

**Cascade effects:**
This generates DELUSION-BASIS-ERROR (paradox fixation) → SCHOLARLY COLLAPSE ERROR (philosophical analysis) → EPISTEMIC ERROR (resolution for understanding). The philosopher solves the unsolvable.

[12960-12969] <ontological-error>
[ONTOLOGICAL ERROR, REIFICATION ERROR, COSMOLOGICAL-DETAIL-ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The text lists specific delusion scenarios: "Field Broad called from delude place Beautiful called from delude time when destroyed and delude year Pig year to delude sun Created sun to delude star Bird to delude human name Old-one Heap-possess called delude." A reader might think: "These are specific astrological and historical conditions that trigger delusion. I must avoid these times and names."

**Why it arises:**
Specific details suggest actionable information. Western astrology and superstition seek to avoid inauspicious conditions. The particulars seem meaningful.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner treats the details as astrological warnings, seeking to avoid specific times and circumstances.

**Secondary consequences:**
1. External conditions are controlled
2. Superstition replaces recognition
3. Life is constrained by avoidance
4. Dzogchen congeals into divination

**Cascade effects:**
This generates COSMOLOGICAL-DETAIL-ERROR (superstitious literalism) → PRACTICE ERROR (avoidance behavior) → ONTOLOGICAL ERROR (conditions as determining). The practitioner consults their horoscope.

[12970-12977] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Reader interprets the symbolic narrative literally, understanding "Pig year" and "Created sun" as actual temporal events rather than stages of delusion's arising.

**Why it arises:**
form with specific years and celestial bodies triggers historical/literal reading. The desire for concrete reference points supports this misreading.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen's symbolic language solidifies as cryptic history. The teaching about how delusion arises from pure ground congeals as a story about ancient times.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner seeks literal correspondences rather than recognizing the symbolic structure in their own experience. The immediacy of recognition is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<reification-error> → substantialization → entity-creation → grasping-suffering
<ontological-error> → future-orientation → present-miss → recognition-deferral

[12978-12986] <epistemic-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The "five poisons" (dug lnga) are understood as actual substances or forces to be eliminated, rather than spontaneous display of awareness.

**Why it arises:**
"Poison" suggests something harmful to remove. Dualistic frameworks require elimination of obstacles for realization.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice congeals into purification of poisons rather than recognition of their nature. The transformative potential of afflictions is entirely missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Aversion toward negative emotions develops. The teaching that poisons are wisdom when recognized congeals into theoretical rather than lived.

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-error>[MORALISTIC ERROR].

[12987-12994] <pedagogical-error>
**Misreading:**
Reader treats the symbolic narrative (Yacha story) as mere allegory or teaching device without actual transformative content.

**Why it arises:**
Modern skepticism toward symbolic narratives combines with inability to recognize symbolic language as pointing to direct experience.

**Primary consequence:**
The bar do (intermediate state) instructions encoded in the narrative are dismissed as mythology. Direct guidance for recognition is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reader believes they understand the "meaning" without undergoing the transformative recognition the narrative is designed to trigger.

**Cascade effects:**
<intellectualization error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<epistemic-error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

[12995-13003] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
"Seeing one's own face" (rang gi rang ngo shes) is interpreted as self-knowledge or self-awareness in the conventional psychological sense.

**Why it arises:**
"Self" and "face" suggest introspection. Modern psychological frameworks interpret self-knowledge as self-reflection.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen recognition solidifies as self-awareness practice. The fundamental distinction between mind (sems) and awareness (rig pa) is collapsed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner cultivates self-observation rather than recognition of awareness-nature. Meditative experience congeals into recursive self-monitoring.

**Cascade effects:**
<psychologization-error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<practice-error> → technique-fixation → recognition-obscuration → method-attachment

[13004-13015] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The "cave of samsara" ('khor ba'i dong) and "door closed by ignorance" are understood as actual locations and physical barriers.

**Why it arises:**
Spatial metaphors trigger literal spatial understanding. The tendency to concretize abstract processes supports this reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Liberation congeals into escape from a place rather than recognition of the nature of appearing. Samsara petrifies into a container.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practice is oriented toward leaving samsara rather than recognizing its nature. The non-dual teaching is undermined by dualistic spatialization.

**Cascade effects:**
<reification-error>[DUALISTIC ERROR].

[13016-13028] <epistemic-error> <practice-error>
**Misreading:**
The "four wisdoms" (shes rab bzhi) are treated as sequential stages of practice to be cultivated over time.

**Why it arises:**
The enumerated list suggests progressive stages. Linear temporal frameworks interpret practice as development through stages.

**Primary consequence:**
Simultaneous recognition is replaced by gradual cultivation. The wisdoms, which are aspects of one recognition, are pursued separately.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner exhausts themselves trying to master each wisdom sequentially, missing that they are spontaneously present.

**Cascade effects:**
<gradualist error>[EFFORT ERROR].

[13029-13040] <reification-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
"Sun and moon realm" (nyi ma can) is understood as an actual pure land or destination to reach through practice.

**Why it arises:**
Directional language suggests destination. The desire for a safe haven supports literalization of pure lands.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice congeals into journey toward a goal. The recognition that pure land is the nature of one's own mind is entirely missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Future-oriented practice replaces present recognition. The teaching that buddhafields are appearances of rig pa congeals into mere belief.

**Cascade effects:**
<teleological error>[FUTURIZATION ERROR].

[13041-13053] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The narrative of "Field Broad" (yul yangs pa can), the teacher "Light-Spread" ('od 'gyed pa), and the siblings is read as historical account.

**Why it arises:**
Proper names and narrative coherence trigger historical reading. Cultural conditioning toward literal interpretation of scriptures.

**Primary consequence:**
The symbolic anatomy being taught—how rig pa and spontaneous presence relate—is missed entirely. Narrative congeals into entertainment or mythology.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reader accumulates "knowledge" about the story without recognizing the mirror-like nature of their own awareness being pointed to.

**Cascade effects:**
<informational error>[EXTERNALIZATION ERROR].

[13054-13061] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The "black demon" (bdud nag po) and "demon realm" are understood as actual malevolent entities and locations rather than aspects of dualistic fixation.

**Why it arises:**
"Demon" (bdud) suggests external threat. Cultural residue of pre-Buddhist demonology supports literal reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen teaching solidifies as exorcism or protection from external forces. The internal process of dualistic fixation is externalized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner develops fear-based practice or seeks protection rituals. The recognition that demons are one's own projections is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<externalization error>[FEAR-BASED ERROR].

[13062-13069] <epistemic-error> <practice-error>
**Misreading:**
The "four types of people" (mi bzhi) and their military roles are interpreted as literal caste or social classes needed for practice.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration suggests classification system. Socio-political frameworks interpret symbolic categories as social stratification.

**Primary consequence:**
The four wisdom aspects symbolized by the four types are reduced to social commentary. Technical instructions become sociological observation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner misses the pointing to the four modes of wisdom (gathering, liberating, distinguishing, moving). Practice degenerates into class analysis.

**Cascade effects:**
<sociological collapse error>[TECHNICAL ERROR].

[13070-13077] <pedagogical-error>
**Misreading:**
The aunt "Ling-thog-can" and her refusal to release the son is understood as family drama rather than teaching on co-emergent ignorance.

**Why it arises:**
Family narrative triggers psychological reading. The relational dynamics suggest interpersonal conflict interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching about lhan cig skyes pa'i ma rig pa (co-emergent ignorance) binding rig pa is entirely missed. Drama replaces dharma.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reader believes they understand the "story" while remaining completely ignorant of the crucial Dzogchen distinction between innate ignorance and cognitive ignorance.

**Cascade effects:**
<psychologization-error>[IGNORANCE MISCLASSIFICATION ERROR].

[13078-13085] <practice-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The weapons (sword, mirrors) and military force are interpreted as actual implements and armies needed for spiritual warfare.

**Why it arises:**
Military imagery triggers literal martial interpretation. Heroic frameworks valorize spiritual combat against forces of evil.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen's peaceful recognition is replaced by aggressive spiritual warfare. The five wisdoms symbolized by the implements become weapons of destruction.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner adopts confrontational attitude toward experience. The teaching that recognition dissolves fixation without conflict is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<aggression error>[DUALISTIC ERROR].

[13086-13091] <reification-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
"Three days" (zhag gsum) is understood as literal three-day period rather than symbolic indication of time needed for recognition to mature.

**Why it arises:**
Temporal markers trigger chronological reading. The need for measurable practice periods supports literalization.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice congeals into time-based rather than recognition-based. The timeless nature of recognition is obscured by temporal framework.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner waits for time to pass rather than recognizing immediately. The teaching that time is also display of rig pa is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<duration error>[FUTURIZATION ERROR].

[13092-13098] <epistemic-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The crystal stupa, silver mirrors, and jewel staircase are understood as actual architectural features of a pure land to be visualized.

**Why it arises:**
Rich descriptive imagery triggers visualization practice. Tantric preliminary practices condition literal interpretation of symbols.

**Primary consequence:**
Generation stage (bskyed rim) visualization replaces Dzogchen recognition. The pointing to the structure of bar do experience congeals into complex visualization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner exhausts themselves in elaborate visualization rather than simple recognition. The spontaneous presence (lhun grub) is replaced by constructed imagery.

**Cascade effects:**
<generation stage error>[CONSTRUCTION ERROR].

[13099-13103] <ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The "jewel house with eight doors" is interpreted as an actual dwelling place or palace to be entered or achieved.

**Why it arises:**
Architectural metaphors trigger literal spatial understanding. The desire for a stable place supports reification.

**Primary consequence:**
The eight doors of spontaneous display (lhun grub) become eight entrances to a palace. The teaching on the eight modes of appearance is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practice congeals into about reaching or entering rather than recognizing what already displays. The immanence of realization is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
<spatialization error>[ATTAINMENT ERROR].
