**Misreading:**
The distinction between ground-expanse-awareness (gzhi'i dbyings rig), path-expanse-awareness (lam gyi dbyings rig), and fruition-expanse-awareness ('bras bu'i dbyings rig) is interpreted as establishing three ontological types of awareness or three classes of practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
Tripartite structure triggers typological thinking. "Ground, path, fruition" suggests developmental stages. The practitioner wants "fruition" awareness.

**Primary consequence:**
The single-nature of all awareness is fragmented into hierarchical types. The practitioner believes fruition-awareness is superior. Elitism emerges around "which awareness one has."

**Secondary consequences:**
"Fruition-awareness practitioner" congeals into advanced identity. Ground-awareness practitioners are deemed beginners. The authentic recognition that all three are aspects of single awareness is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 474-475's capacity distinctions. Awareness-type congeals into capacity-marker. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having fruition-awareness."

[20156-20167] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The "expanse-awareness distinction" (dbyings rig gi gnad) is interpreted as crucial doctrinal point requiring intellectual mastery.

**Why it arises:**
Technical terminology signals importance. "Crucial" suggests necessity. The practitioner assumes doctrinal precision is required.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-nature of distinction is lost. The practitioner studies dbyings-rig difference intellectually. Recognition is replaced by conceptual knowledge.

**Secondary consequences:**
Doctrinal debates proliferate. Teachers with precise definitions gain authority. The authentic recognition that distinction is pedagogical tool is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "mastered" distinctions without recognition.

[20168-20178] <epistemic-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The verses about "when appearances are fragmented... when extremely subtle and moving" are interpreted as phenomenological roadmap with required experiences.

**Why it arises:**
Conditional language triggers achievement-assumption. "When" suggests stages. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate requirements.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is suffocated by experience-matching. The practitioner checks: "Are my appearances fragmented? Subtle? Moving?" Achievement-anxiety replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Experience-stages become orthodoxy. Teachers who validate specific appearances gain authority. The authentic recognition that all appearances are equal is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 474-475's appearance-categories. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by appearance-tracking.

[20179-20190] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The practitioner-types section is seen as "near the end" triggering "just finish" mentality. The practitioner wants to "complete" Volume 1.

**Why it arises:**
Proximity to end produces momentum. Dense content produces fatigue. The practitioner wants "done."

**Primary consequence:**
The humbling function of practitioner-type teaching is missed. The practitioner has "read" types without being humbled. Information substitutes for transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward dismissive pattern. Type-awareness is not internalized. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "final formality."

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 474-475's type-elaboration is not absorbed. Arriving at PAGE 479 without humility, the practitioner misses dedication's grounding.

[20191-20202] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The "five elements dissolving into expanse" (byung ba rnams lnga thim gyur) is interpreted as literal alchemical process.

**Why it arises:**
Alchemical language triggers substance-transformation associations. "Dissolving" suggests metamorphosis. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate physical change.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-metaphor nature of elemental language is lost. The practitioner seeks literal elemental-transmutation. Somatic achievement replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Element-practices proliferate. Teachers promising "dissolution experiences" gain authority. The authentic recognition that elements are metaphorical is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Elemental metaphors are literalized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "dissolved" conceptually.


[20203-20208] <ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The appearance-catalog—fragmented, subtle-moving, flickering, round, flaming, dissolving—is interpreted as progressive stages indicating practitioner advancement.

**Why it arises:**
Catalog structure triggers developmental thinking. Sequential presentation suggests curriculum. The practitioner wants "advanced" appearances.

**Primary consequence:**
The equal-nature of all appearances is lost. "Dissolving appearances" become superior. Elitism emerges around "which appearance-stage one has reached."

**Secondary consequences:**
"Dissolution-experienced" congeals into exclusive identity. Fragmented-appearance practitioners are deemed beginners. The authentic recognition that appearance-content doesn't matter is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 474-475's completion. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "cataloged" appearances without recognition.

[20209-20211] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The "measure and time certainty" (tshad dang dus ngas pa) is interpreted as precise phenomenological standards to achieve.

**Why it arises:**
Technical terminology suggests precision. "Certainty" suggests requirement. The practitioner assumes standards indicate necessities.

**Primary consequence:**
Natural recognition is suffocated by standard-matching. The practitioner worries: "Is my measure correct? Is my timing certain?" Conformity-anxiety replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Standard-orthodoxies proliferate. Teachers who validate "correct" measures gain authority. The authentic recognition that measures are pedagogical tools is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Standards are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "measured" without recognition.
