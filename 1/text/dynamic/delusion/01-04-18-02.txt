[3893-3906] <methodological-error> [FOUR TRANSMISSION METHODS AS CURRICULUM]
**Misreading:**
The four teaching methods (thorough investigation, removing obscurations, bringing forth hidden, self-clarifying) are interpreted as mandatory curriculum stages that must be experienced in sequence.

**Why it arises:**
Pedagogical framework confusion. Four methods suggest systematic progression. Educational conditioning assumes structured learning.

**Primary consequence:**
Method-stage fixation. Students expect all four methods; teachers feel compelled to employ each sequentially.

**Secondary consequences:**
Artificial method-application; checking off teaching styles; missing that methods are spontaneous responses, not curriculum.

**Cascade effects:**
<pedagogical-rigidity> through method-requirements.
<progress-tracking> through stage-completion.

[3907-3913] <nihilistic-error> [NO BUDDHA/SENTIENT BEINGS AS DENIAL]
**Misreading:**
The statement "even the name of Buddha does not exist" and "buddhas and sentient beings do not exist" is interpreted as nihilistic denial of all distinctions and spiritual attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Negation literalism. "Does not exist" suggests total absence. Absence of positive terms invites nihilism.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking non-existence literally. The practitioner believes there are no buddhas, no path, no realization at all.

**Secondary consequences:**
Paralysis; practice abandonment; "nothing matters" spirituality; confusing non-inherent existence with non-existence.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilistic-error> through interpreting negation as denial.
<practice-abandonment> through void-extreme.

[3910-3911] <moral-confusion> [GOOD/BAD NON-ABANDONMENT AS LICENSE]
**Misreading:**
"Action free from good and bad" and "virtue and non-virtue not abandoned" is interpreted as license for unethical behavior since ethics don't matter.

**Why it arises:**
Anti-nomian temptation. Freedom from good/bad suggests moral anarchy. Spiritual libertinism finds confirmation.

**Primary consequence:**
Ethical nihilism. The practitioner believes any action is acceptable because "nothing is truly good or bad."

**Secondary consequences:**
Harmful behavior; spiritual bypassing; "beyond ethics" as excuse for acting out.

**Cascade effects:**
<ethical-nihilism> through moral-license.
<extreme-view> through abandoning ethical discernment.

[3912-3913] <investigation-confusion> [MIND INVESTIGATION AS ANALYSIS]
**Misreading:**
"Investigation of mind's realization" is interpreted as analytical inquiry or self-investigation technique requiring active searching.

**Why it arises:**
Active inquiry habit. "Investigation" suggests deliberate searching. Self-analysis is common in Western psychology.

**Primary consequence:**
Analytical self-obsession. The practitioner engages in endless self-investigation rather than simple recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Intellectual introspection; searching for "real" mind; confusing investigation with recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<intellectualism> through analytical inquiry.
<searching-delusion> through investigation-obsession.

[3914-3921] <spontaneity-fetishism> [SELF-LIBERATION AS PASSIVE]
**Misreading:**
The repeated emphasis on "self-liberated," "causeless," and "without acceptance/rejection" is interpreted as passive "letting everything happen" approach.

**Why it arises:**
Passive misinterpretation of spontaneity. "Self-liberated" sounds like no effort. Misunderstanding of "non-action."

**Primary consequence:**
Lazy non-practice. The practitioner believes they should do nothing because everything "liberates itself."

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual lethargy; dullness mistaken for natural mind; abandonment of discernment.

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-abandonment> through passive misinterpretation.
<dullness-error> through mistaking torpor for liberation.

[3922-3928] <gtarka-misunderstanding> [OBSTACLE-CLEARING AS TECHNIQUE]
**Misreading:**
The term "gtar-ka" (obstacle-clearing axe) and "removing obstacles" is interpreted as establishing specific technique or method for clearing obstacles.

**Why it arises:**
Tool-fetishism. "Axe" suggests implement. Obstacle-removal invites method-formulation.

**Primary consequence:**
Gtar-ka technique development. The practitioner seeks or develops "obstacle-clearing" methods.

**Secondary consequences:**
Method-inflation; ritual obstacle-clearing; missing that obstacles are self-liberated, not removed.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-fetishism> through tool-metaphor literalism.
<practice-methodology> through obstacle-clearing as procedure.

---

[3929-3942] <stage-progression-error> [HEAT/STABILITY STAGES AS LADDER]
**Misreading:**
The descriptions of view/meditation/conduct in states of movement, attainment, and stability are interpreted as developmental ladder with progressive stages to climb.

**Why it arises:**
Developmental psychology bias. Movement → attainment → stability suggests progression. Modern spiritual growth models.

**Primary consequence:**
Stage-climbing. The practitioner believes they progress from "heat" to "attainment" to "stability."

**Secondary consequences:**
Measuring progress by stage; anxiety about advancement; deferring recognition to "stability."

**Cascade effects:**
<progress-tracking> through stage-hierarchy.
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through developmental model.

---

[3930-3942] <analogical-interpretation> [ANIMAL/BATTLE METAPHORS AS MAPPING]
**Misreading:**
The metaphors (thief recognizing accomplice, fire in wood, army conquering fortress, wild boar tamed, etc.) are interpreted as precise mappings of internal spiritual experiences with specific signs to recognize.

**Why it arises:**
Literalist mapping. Rich metaphors invite one-to-one correspondence. Wanting concrete indicators of progress.

**Primary consequence:**
Experience-matching. The practitioner tries to match their experience to specific metaphors as validation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Experience-anxiety; seeking "correct" signs; confusion when experience doesn't match metaphor.

**Cascade effects:**
<experience-validation> through metaphor-matching.
<progress-obsession> through sign-seeking.

---

[3936-3941] <somatic-obsession> [WIND/MIND GATHERING AS PHYSIOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
"Wind and mind gathered" and "heart-wind rising" are interpreted as literal physiological processes in channels/energy system.

**Why it arises:**
Somatic literalism. Wind/body language invites physiological interpretation. Subtle body practices.

**Primary consequence:**
Physiological manipulation. The practitioner tries to physically gather wind/mind through breath/energy work.

**Secondary consequences:**
Body-control obsession; physical strain; missing that "wind" is metaphor for awareness-movement.

**Cascade effects:**
<embodiment-fetishism> through somatic reduction.
<technique-fetishism> through physiological manipulation.
