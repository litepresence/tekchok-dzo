[2873-2879] <reasoning-reification> <intellectual-emptiness>
**Misreading:**
The "wisdom that realizes all as primordially dwelling through reasoning" interpreted as intellectual achievement—understanding emptiness through philosophical analysis rather than direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
"Reasoning" suggests logic. "Examines and dissects" sounds like analysis. Academic study feels like progress.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom becomes intellectual property. Practitioners master debate without recognizing mind nature. Study replaces practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Scholastic pride develops. "I understand emptiness" becomes boast. Direct recognition is buried under conceptual mastery.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <intellectual-emptiness> (conceptual understanding), <debate-mastery> (winning arguments), <study-obsession> (endless analysis), <recognition-delay> (waiting until understood).

[2880-2887] <non-elaboration-substantialism> <peace-reification>
**Misreading:**
The dharmadhatu "pure from the beginning, transcending elaborations" interpreted as describing a special state of non-conceptual peace to achieve.

**Why it arises:**
"Pure from beginning" sounds like original innocence. "Transcending" suggests going beyond. "Peace" appeals to desire for rest.

**Primary consequence:**
Non-elaboration becomes goal to achieve. Practitioners try to "stop elaborating." The natural ease is replaced by effortful silence.

**Secondary consequences:**
Conceptual suppression develops. "No thoughts" becomes meditation goal. The spontaneous display is rejected as elaboration.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <conceptual-suppression> (stopping thought), <peace-seeking> (wanting rest), <non-elaboration-effort> (trying not to elaborate), <original-purity-romanticism> (returning to innocence).

---

[2888-2892] <precept-accumulation> <vinaya-fetishism>
**Misreading:**
The enumeration of precepts (10 novice, 250 bhikshu, 363 bhikshuni) interpreted as establishing complete moral code requiring literal adherence to all rules.

**Why it arises:**
Numbers suggest comprehensiveness. Rules provide clarity. Moral frameworks promise purity.

**Primary consequence:**
Discipline becomes rule-following. Practitioners obsess over precept violations. The spirit of ethics is lost in literalism.

**Secondary consequences:**
Legalism develops. "Did I break a rule?" becomes obsession. Compassion is sacrificed for purity codes.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <precept-legalism> (rule-following), <violation-anxiety> (fearing breakage), <moral-accounting> (tracking ethics), <literalist-purity> (codes over compassion).

---

[2893-2903] <five-paths-sequentialism> <path-climbing>
**Misreading:**
The five paths (*lam lnga*) with their specific practices (4 foundations, 4 abandonments, 4 feet, 5 faculties, 5 strengths, 7 limbs, 8 paths) interpreted as mandatory curriculum to complete in sequence.

**Why it arises:**
"Five paths" suggests roadmap. Sequential listing implies order. Educational conditioning expects progression.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes checklist completion. "Which path am I on?" replaces recognition. Progress-anxiety dominates.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners compare "path-level." Teachers rank students by progress. The already-complete nature is forgotten.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <path-obsession> (tracking progress), <curriculum-completion> (finishing stages), <sequential-fixation> (must go in order), <achievement-comparison> (who's ahead).

---

[2904-2914] <buddha-body-ontology> <kaya-reification>
**Misreading:**
The three bodies (dharmakaya for self, form bodies for others) interpreted as establishing ontological categories—actual types of bodies that Buddhas possess.

**Why it arises:**
"Bodies" suggests entities. "Obtained" implies acquisition. Typology invites classification.

**Primary consequence:**
The kayas are substantialized into possessions. Practitioners try to "get" the three bodies. The empty display is replaced by metaphysics.

**Secondary consequences:**
"I have dharmakaya" becomes claim. Body-ontology debates proliferate. The non-dual nature is fragmented.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <kaya-possession> (having bodies), <ontological-buddhism> (metaphysical entities), <body-acquisition> (getting kayas), <classification-obsession> (categorizing realities).

---

[2915-2922] <two-truths-dualism> <truth-hierarchy>
**Misreading:**
The "two truths—ultimate and conventional" as "doors of entry" interpreted as establishing two separate realities—conventional world vs. ultimate truth dimension.

**Why it arises:**
"Two" suggests separation. "Doors" implies entry points. "Ultimate" sounds higher.

**Primary consequence:**
Ultimate truth becomes transcendent realm. Conventional reality is devalued. Non-duality is lost in dualistic framework.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek "ultimate experience." Daily life is dismissed. The emptiness of both truths is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <transcendence-seeking> (going beyond), <conventional-rejection> (world is illusion), <hierarchical-truth> (one better than other), <experience-dualism> (separate realms).

---

[2923-2930] <eighty-four-vows-literalism> <bodhisattva-legalism>
**Misreading:**
The "eighty-four vows" and precepts interpreted as contractual obligations creating binding commitments with specific penalties for violation.

**Why it arises:**
"Vows" suggests promises. Numbers imply completeness. Legal frameworks understand contracts.

**Primary consequence:**
Bodhisattva vows become burden. Practitioners fear vow-breaking. Joy of altruism is replaced by obligation-anxiety.

**Secondary consequences:**
Vow-tracking develops. "Did I violate number 37?" becomes worry. Generosity becomes calculation.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <vow-burden> (heavy obligations), <contractual-ethics> (binding agreements), <violation-guilt> (failing commitments), <legalistic-bodhisattva> (rules over compassion).

---

[2931-2940] <emptiness-view-intellectualism> <philosophical-attachment>
**Misreading:**
The "view and wisdom of emptiness" interpreted as philosophical position to be held—correct doctrine to believe and defend.

**Why it arises:**
"View" suggests perspective. "Wisdom" implies knowledge. Doctrinal allegiance feels important.

**Primary consequence:**
Emptiness becomes ideology. Practitioners debate "correct view." Recognition is replaced by opinion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Sectarianism over emptiness formulations. "My understanding is right" becomes arrogance. The empty nature of all views is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <emptiness-sectarianism> (my view vs yours), <doctrinal-arrogance> (correct understanding), <philosophical-attachment> (clinging to view), <debate-obsession> (proving correctness).

---

[2941-2950] <path-of-accumulation-meritorism> <collection-obsession>
**Misreading:**
The "path of accumulation" (*tshogs lam*) interpreted as gathering sufficient merit and wisdom through practice—collecting enough to qualify for next stage.

**Why it arises:**
"Accumulation" suggests gathering. "Path" implies progress. Merit systems use collection metaphors.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual practice becomes accumulation project. "Do I have enough?" replaces recognition. Scarcity mentality dominates.

**Secondary consequences:**
Merit-anxiety develops. "Not ready yet" becomes excuse. The naturally present is obscured by seeking.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <merit-scarcity> (not enough), <collection-obsession> (gathering requirements), <qualification-anxiety> (am I ready), <accumulation-mentality> (getting more).

---

[2951-2960] <path-of-preparation-heating> <meditational-thermodynamics>
**Misreading:**
The "heat and peak" (*drod rtse*) stages interpreted as actual energetic phenomena—meditation generating literal heat in the body.

**Why it arises:**
"Heat" suggests temperature. "Peak" implies intensity. Tantric practices do generate physical heat (*gtum mo*).

**Primary consequence:**
Meditation becomes thermodynamics. Practitioners seek physical sensations. The metaphorical nature is literalized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Sensation-obsession develops. "Is it hot enough?" becomes concern. The cognitive-emotional dimension is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <thermal-obsession> (seeking heat), <sensation-fetishism> (physical feelings), <literal-gtum-mo> (body temperature), <energetic-materialism> (heat as achievement).

---

[2961-2970] <path-of-seeing-breakthrough> <insight-event>
**Misreading:**
The "path of seeing" (*mthong lam*) interpreted as dramatic breakthrough event—sudden flash of enlightenment that changes everything.

**Why it arises:**
"Seeing" suggests vision. "Path" implies progress. Breakthrough narratives are compelling.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes waiting for breakthrough. Ordinary experience is dismissed. The gradual nature is rejected.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Hasn't happened yet" becomes discouragement. Or: minor experiences are magnified into "the event."

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <breakthrough-fetishism> (waiting for event), <experience-inflation> (minor as major), <gradual-rejection> (only sudden counts), <enlightenment-expectation> (waiting for flash).

---

[2971-2982] <nine-grounds-elevation> <bhumi-climbing>
**Misreading:**
The nine grounds (*sa dgu*) from "great joy" onward interpreted as floors in a building—practitioner ascends floor by floor to reach top.

**Why it arises:**
"Grounds" suggests levels. "Nine" implies sequence. "Joy" sounds desirable.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes elevation-technology. "Which ground am I on?" becomes obsession. Hierarchy dominates.

**Secondary consequences:**
Comparison with others. "They're on ground 5, I'm only on 2." The equality of all phenomena is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <ground-competition> (ranking progress), <elevation-obsession> (climbing higher), <hierarchical-fixation> (levels matter), <inferiority-superiority> (comparing stages).

---

[2873-2873] <non-learning-path-completion> <graduation-myth>
**Misreading:**
The "path of no-more-learning" (*mi slob pa'i lam*) interpreted as graduation—final completion of study indicating mastery.

**Why it arises:**
"No-more-learning" suggests completion. "Path" implies journey. Educational frameworks use graduation.

**Primary consequence:**
Enlightenment becomes credential. "I've finished" becomes claim. The endless deepening is truncated.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual materialism peaks. "I am complete" becomes arrogance. Further learning is rejected.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <enlightenment-credential> (certified complete), <graduation-arrogance> (I'm done), <learning-aversion> (no more needed), <mastery-claim> (I know everything).

---

[2873-2873] <samsara-emptying-project> <liberation-mission>
**Misreading:**
"Working for benefit of beings until samsara is emptied" interpreted as literal mission—personal responsibility to liberate all beings from existence.

**Why it arises:**
"Until emptied" suggests completion. Compassion creates urgency. Hero narratives appeal.

**Primary consequence:**
Savior complex develops. "I must empty samsara" becomes crushing burden. Or: impossible mission creates despair.

**Secondary consequences:**
Burnout or grandiosity. "I'm failing all beings" vs "I will save everyone." Balance is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <savior-burden> (must save all), <samsara-emptying-obsession> (impossible task), <compassion-fatigue> (burnout), <mission-arrogance> (I can do it).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Page 2873-3005 covers the Bodhisattva vehicle in detail: two truths, five paths with their thirty-seven factors, ten grounds, three bodies, and bodhisattva precepts. This is dense pedagogical material with extensive enumerations.

**ERROR RISK:** The systematic enumeration (5 paths, 37 factors, 10 grounds, 84 vows) invites curriculum-completion mentality—treating enlightenment as academic program with required courses.

**SCHOLAR CHECK:** Ensure reader understands that all path structures are skillful means (*thabs*), not mandatory curricula. The thirty-seven factors describe aspects of recognition, not items to collect.

**CONTINUITY NOTE:** Lines 3006+ continue with result vehicle (tantra) exposition. The causal vehicle framework established here (paths, grounds, perfections) will be contrasted with result vehicle direct approach.
