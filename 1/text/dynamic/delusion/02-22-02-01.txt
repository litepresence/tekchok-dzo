**Secondary consequences:**
- "Practice should feel blissful"
- Missing that bliss is byproduct, not goal
- Disappointment with neutral experience

**Cascade effects:**
<association-bliss> → <pleasure-seeking> [chasing bliss] → <disappointment-compulsion> [not blissful] → <natural-bliss-miss> [bliss not sensation]

- Dualism: observer-observed

**Cascade effects:**
<affliction-arising-non-concept> → <witnessing-mode> [observing emotions] → <observer-dualism> [watcher vs watched] → <natural-non-holding-miss> [no observer]

[10820-10821] <ugly-form-non-aversion> <gzugs-mi-sdug-zhe-mi-sdang>

**Misreading:**
"No anger at ugly form" interpreted as emotional flatness or tolerance.

**Why it arises:**

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I tolerate ugly things"
- Missing that non-aversion is freedom, not tolerance
- Reifying acceptance as achievement
- Suppressed aversion

**Cascade effects:**
<ugly-form-non-aversion> → <tolerance-effort> [forced acceptance] → <suppression-mask> [hidden aversion] → <natural-non-aversion-miss> [freedom not tolerance]

- Health damage from fasting
- Reifying hunger-transcendence as power
