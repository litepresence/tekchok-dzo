**Misreading:**
The author's closing verses interpreted as authoritative pronouncements requiring submission.

**Why it arises:**
"Author" suggests authority. "Closing" implies final word. Submission-culture.

**Primary consequence:**
Authority-submission: accepting without recognition. Natural authority obscured by externalization.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Longchenpa said it, so it's true"
- Missing that text points to self-recognition
- Reifying author as ultimate source
- Dependency on external validation

**Cascade effects:**
<closing-verse-authority> → <textual-submission> [believing] → <external-dependency> [outside authority] → <natural-authority-miss> [self-evident]

**Misreading:**
Completion blessings interpreted as transmitted power received passively.

**Why it arises:**
"Blessing" suggests transmission. "Completion" implies final bestowal. Reception-mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Blessing-receptivity: waiting for transmitted power. Natural blessing obscured by passivity.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I receive the completion blessing"
- Missing that blessing is recognition
- Reifying blessing as transferable
- Passive waiting for grace

**Cascade effects:**
<blessing-receptivity> → <transmission-waiting> [receiving power] → <passive-grace> [waiting] → <natural-blessing-miss> [blessing is seeing]

[16750-16769] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The conclusion of text interpreted as closure providing completion-satisfaction.

**Why it arises:**
"Conclusion" suggests ending. "Closure" implies satisfaction. Completion-desire.

**Primary consequence:**
Closure-satisfaction: feeling complete after reading. Natural incompleteness obscured by false completion.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I've finished the text, I'm done"
- Missing that text is pointer, not completion
- Reifying reading as accomplishment
- Stopping at conclusion

**Cascade effects:**
<text-conclusion-closure> → <completion-illusion> [feeling done] → <practice-stopping> [not engaging] → <natural-incompleteness-miss> [never finished]

[16719-16728] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Author's humility interpreted as genuine inferiority rather than conventional modesty.

**Why it arises:**
"Humility" suggests modesty. "Author" implies status. Literal reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Humility-literalism: dismissing text due to author's modesty. Natural humility obscured by taking literally.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Even the author says he's unqualified"
- Missing that humility is convention
- Reifying modesty as literal truth
- Text-dismissal

**Cascade effects:**
<author-humility-dismissal> → <literalism> [taking seriously] → <text-rejection> [not authoritative] → <natural-humility-miss> [convention not truth]

[16728-16750] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Dedication of merit interpreted as transferring benefit to others externally.

**Why it arises:**
"Dedication" suggests giving. "Merit" implies transferable virtue. Transaction-mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Merit-transaction: treating virtue as currency. Natural dedication obscured by exchange.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I dedicate my merit to all beings"
- Missing that dedication is recognition-expansion
- Reifying merit as substance
- Virtue-banking

**Cascade effects:**
<merit-transaction> → <virtue-banking> [accumulating] → <exchange-mentality> [giving merit] → <natural-dedication-miss> [dedication is view]

[16750-16769] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The colophon and history interpreted as important for authenticating the teaching.

**Why it arises:**
"History" suggests authenticity. "Colophon" implies provenance. Certification-need.

**Primary consequence:**
Historical-fetishization: valuing text for historical pedigree. Natural teaching obscured by antiquarianism.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "This text is from 14th century Tibet"
- Missing that teaching is timeless
- Reifying history as validation
- Era-elitism

**Cascade effects:**
<historical-fetishization> → <antiquarianism> [valuing age] → <provenance-obsession> [where from] → <natural-timelessness-miss> [teaching ever-fresh]
