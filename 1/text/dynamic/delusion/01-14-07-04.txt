**Misreading:**
The detailed progression of bindu visions—from upright to wings, from that various weapon-forms, reliquaries, lotuses—is interpreted as the actual stages of thodgal practice that all practitioners should sequentially experience.

**Why it arises:**
Sequential description triggers developmental reading. "Seeing" (*མཐོང་) suggests visual achievement. Western stage-theories project linear progression onto Dzogchen.

**Primary consequence:**
Thodgal becomes standardized vision-sequence. Practitioners compare their experiences to this "map," believing they must see specific forms in order. Natural display is forced into prescriptive framework.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Upright bindu standing" becomes stage one requirement. "Rainbow-like" is intermediate. "Weapons and reliquaries" are advanced. Students become anxious about "not seeing the right things."

**Cascade effects:**
This <practice-error> produces <eternalistic-error> where specific visions become attainments. <pedagogical-error> follows as vision-stages are institutionalized. <epistemic-error> proliferates as students fake or force experiences.

<ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The statement that "at the time of kāya-maturing, awareness matures as kāya" is interpreted as asserting a literal transformation process where awareness actually becomes or turns into forms—substantial change metaphysics.

**Why it arises:**
"Maturing" (*སྨིན་པ་) triggers developmental reading. "Awareness matures as kāya" suggests transformation. Western process metaphysics interprets this as actual becoming.

**Primary consequence:**
Rigpa is treated as substance that transforms. The formless awareness "becomes" form through practice. The unchanging nature of rigpa is contradicted by transformation-ontology.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Shes rab maturing as kāya" is interpreted as actual change. "Body of wisdom" becomes produced form. The spontaneous display (*རྩལ་) is confused with causally-produced transformation.

**Cascade effects:**
This <ontological-error> triggers <eternalistic-error> where kāyas are reified as produced entities. <practice-error> follows as transformation is sought. occurs when Atiyoga becomes cause-effect system.
