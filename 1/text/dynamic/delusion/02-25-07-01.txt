[16972-16977] <kaya-triplicity> <sku-gsum-so-sor

**Misreading:**
Three kayas (Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmanakaya) interpreted as establishing three separate bodies—distinct entities that together constitute Buddhahood.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests multiplicity. "Kaya" means body. Enumerations imply separation.

**Primary consequence:**
Kayas substantialized as three entities. Recognition fragmented by kaya-differentiation. The singular is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Which kaya?" analysis. Kaya-hopping meditation. The three-in-one is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<kaya-triplicity> → <entity-separation> → <kaya-differentiation> → <three-in-one-miss>

"Buddha's ground/field" interpreted as establishing actual location where Buddhas reside—destination of enlightenment.

**Why it arises:**
"Field" suggests location. Ground implies foundation. Destination is comforting.

**Primary consequence:**
Buddhahood substantialized as location. Recognition displaced by field-arrival. The location-free is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Field-seeking. "Reaching Buddha-field" ambition. The everywhere-present is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<buddha-field-destination> → <field-seeking> → <arrival-ambition> → <everywhere-present-miss>

[16977-16982] <body-completion-reification> <lus-rdzogs-sku

**Misreading:**
"Complete in body, called kaya" interpreted as establishing physical perfection—enlightened body as complete form.

**Why it arises:**
"Complete" suggests perfection. "Body" implies form. Physical perfection is attractive.

**Primary consequence:**
Kaya substantialized as perfect body. Recognition displaced by body-completion. The form-free is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Perfect-body aspiration. Form-achievement. The formless is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<body-completion-reification> → <form-perfection> → <body-aspiration> → <formless-miss>

[16983-16995] <kaya-characteristic-differentiation> <mtshan-nyid-so-sor

**Misreading:**
Characteristics of three kayas (free from elaboration, marks, certainty) interpreted as establishing three different natures—each kaya has distinct quality.

**Why it arises:**
Characteristics suggest properties. Differentiation is familiar. Classification seems precise.

**Primary consequence:**
Kayas substantialized by characteristics. Recognition fragmented by property-analysis. The characteristic-free is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Characteristic-analysis. "Which kaya's characteristics?" questioning. The beyond-characteristics is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<kaya-characteristic-differentiation> → <property-analysis> → <characteristic-questioning> → <beyond-characteristics-miss>

[16996-17006] <speech-classification> <gsung-sna-tshogs

**Misreading:**
Sixfold classification of Buddha-speech interpreted as establishing six types of enlightened communication—comprehensive taxonomy of Buddha's voice.

**Why it arises:**
"Six" suggests completeness. Classification is organized. Speech seems analyzable.

**Primary consequence:**
Buddha-speech substantialized as six types. Recognition displaced by speech-classification. The speech-free is obscured.

[17007-17022] <echo-metaphor-literalization> <brag-ca-dpe

**Misreading:**
Buddha-speech "like echo" interpreted as establishing acoustic simile—speech resembles echo but is still real sound.

**Why it arises:**
"Like" suggests comparison. Echo is familiar analogy. Simile preserves reality.

**Primary consequence:**
Buddha-speech substantialized as echo-like. Recognition displaced by acoustic-comparison. The beyond-sound is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Echo-meditation. "Hearing the echo-like nature." The beyond-analogy is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<echo-metaphor-literalization> → <acoustic-comparison> → <echo-meditation> → <beyond-analogy-miss>

[17023-17033] <other-cognition-dependence> <gzhan-rig-las-byung

**Misreading:**
"Arising from other's cognition" interpreted as establishing Buddha-speech as mind-dependent—exists only in listener's perception.

**Why it arises:**

[17034-17046] <mind-threefold> <thugs-rnam-gsum

**Misreading:**
Three aspects of mind (free from delusion, self-clear awareness, various knowing) interpreted as establishing three minds—different types of enlightened cognition.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests multiplicity. Mind seems analyzable. Classification is precise.

**Primary consequence:**
Enlightened mind substantialized as three types. Recognition fragmented by mind-analysis. The singular-awareness is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**

[17047-17060] <qualities-possession> <yon-tan-nor-bu

**Misreading:**
Qualities like "jewel" possessing all excellence interpreted as establishing Buddha-qualities as possessions—attributes that Buddhas have.

**Why it arises:**
"Jewel" suggests treasure. "Possessing" implies ownership. Excellence is attractive.

**Primary consequence:**
Qualities substantialized as possessions. Recognition displaced by quality-accumulation. The quality-free is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**

Three stages suggest progression. Development is familiar. Sequence implies causality.

**Primary consequence:**
Qualities temporalized as progressive. Recognition deferred to fruit-stage. The always-complete is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Stage-qualification. "Ground qualities vs fruit qualities." The ever-present is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruit-sequencing> → <progressive-qualities> → <stage-qualification> → <always-complete-miss>

[17061-17069] <activity-until-samsara-emptied> <srid-stongs-bar

**Misreading:**
"Activity until samsara not emptied" interpreted as establishing endless work—Buddhas must continuously act until all beings are liberated.

**Why it arises:**
"Until" suggests duration. Compassion drives endless activity. Samsara seems endless.

**Primary consequence:**
Enlightened activity substantialized as endless obligation. Recognition displaced by duty-anxiety. The effortless is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Never-ending work" exhaustion. Compassion-fatigue. The spontaneously-accomplished is lost.

**Cascade effects:**

[17070-17081] <activity-purification-work> <las-nyon-sbyangs

**Misreading:**
"Activity purifying karma and afflictions" interpreted as establishing Buddha-work as purification labor—cleaning up beings' negativities.

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Lines 16972-17081 present the conclusion on Buddha-qualities, three kayas, and enlightened activity—the final presentation of the result. This is the culmination of the Treasury's entire teaching.

ERROR RISK: Readers may reduce these profound teachings on the result to entity-enumeration, possession-accumulation, or endless work, missing that all kayas, qualities, and activities are modalities of the single nature.

SCHOLAR CHECK: Ensure reader understands that three kayas are not three entities but one nature; that qualities are not possessions but natural expression; and that enlightened activity is spontaneous, not endless labor.

[FINAL TEXT COMPLETION AWARENESS]

This concludes the entire Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle (Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod). All 25 chapters have been presented. The text demonstrates that ground, path, and fruit are primordially complete, not sequential achievements.

ERROR RISK READER MAY FALL INTO AT THIS FINAL STAGE:
- Completion as closure (thinking "I've finished the text")
- Compilation as accumulation (collecting all the teachings)
- Authority as belief (believing Longchenpa's words without recognition)
- The text as object (possessing the book vs embodying the teaching)

FINAL SCHOLAR CHECK: The purpose of this entire text is to lead the reader to direct recognition, not to accumulate knowledge, complete a study, or possess teachings. Recognition is the only goal.
