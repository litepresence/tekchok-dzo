[16972-16977] <kaya-triplicity> <sku-gsum-so-sor>

**Misreading:**
Three kayas (*chos sku*, *longs sku*, *sprul sku*) interpreted as establishing three separate bodies—distinct entities that together constitute Buddhahood, each with its own location and function.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests multiplicity. *Sku* (body) implies form. Enumeration produces separation. The mind grasps at "Dharmakaya = essence, Sambhogakaya = enjoyment, Nirmanakaya = emanation" as three things.
