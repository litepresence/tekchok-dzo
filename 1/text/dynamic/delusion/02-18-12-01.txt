[5242-5246] <practice-error> [NON-MEDITATION AS NOT PRACTICING]
**Misreading:**
"Non-meditation" means one should not practice or make any effort at all.

**Why it arises:**
Literal interpretation of "non." Anti-effort romanticism.

**Primary consequence:**
Laziness justified as Dzogchen practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
No actual recognition; ordinary distraction.

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-error>.

[5247-5268] <pedagogical-error> [POINTING OUT AS MAGIC]
**Misreading:**
The pointing-out instruction magically transmits realization from teacher to student.

**Why it arises:**
Esoteric expectations. Wish for easy enlightenment.

**Primary consequence:**
Passive waiting for teacher to "give" realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing the necessity of own recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<pedagogical-error>.
