<ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The "threefold continuous yoga" (rgyun gyi rnal 'byor gsum) and its nine deviations (gol sa) are interpreted as precise curriculum where deviations are actual errors to be vigilantly avoided.

**Why it arises:**
Enumerative structure triggers anxiety-formation. "Deviation" suggests wrong-path. The practitioner assumes listed errors are real dangers.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-already-complete nature is obscured by deviation-paranoia. The practitioner believes they must navigate around nine specific errors. Recognition is replaced by error-avoidance.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deviation-monitoring consumes attention. "Am I falling into formless absorption?" becomes constant worry. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply non-recognition is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 470-472's deviation elaboration. Each deviation becomes new fear. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is paralyzed by deviation-avoidance.

<ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The description of deviations is interpreted as establishing "deviation-free practice" as advanced attainment accessible only to superior practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
Technical sophistication suggests esoteric content. Complex deviation-catalog signals "higher teaching." The practitioner wants advanced status.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-available-despite-deviation nature is lost. The practitioner believes deviation-free practice is required. Elitism emerges around "avoiding all nine deviations."

**Secondary consequences:**
"Deviation-free practitioner" becomes exclusive identity. Those showing deviation-signs are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply labels for non-recognition is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Deviation-mastery becomes capacity-indicator. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having no deviations."

<epistemic-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The deviation-examples—falling into formless absorptions, form realms, solid matter—are interpreted as literal geographical locations one can actually "fall into."

**Why it arises:**
Spatial language triggers literal mapping. "Fall into" suggests destination. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate cosmography.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-error nature of deviations is lost. The practitioner believes in literal wrong-realms. Navigation-anxiety replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Realm-maps" proliferate. Teachers who detail cosmographies gain authority. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply mistaken views is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Spatial metaphors there are also literalized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed "deviation-geography."

[COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The deviation section is seen as "danger warnings" to rush through so one can reach "positive content" (practitioner types, colophon). Fear-content creates dismissive reading.

**Why it arises:**
Fear-triggering content creates resistance. "Deviations" suggest negativity. The practitioner wants "inspirational" material.

**Primary consequence:**
The protective function of deviation-teaching is missed. The practitioner has "covered" deviations without understanding them. Information substitutes for discernment.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward aversion-pattern. Difficult teachings are avoided. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached as "positive conclusion" without deviation-awareness.

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 470-472's deviation-elaboration is not absorbed. Arriving at PAGE 479 without deviation-understanding, the practitioner misses the colophon's protective function.

<ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The "gol sa" (deviation) term itself is interpreted as establishing dzogchen's unique possession of precise error-diagnosis, superior to other traditions.

**Why it arises:**
Technical terminology signals expertise. "Deviation" suggests diagnostic precision. The practitioner wants superior diagnostic tools.

**Primary consequence:**
The universal-availability of error-recognition is lost. Gol sa becomes dzogchen-exclusive concept. Elitism emerges around "having deviation-map."

**Secondary consequences:**
"Gol sa practitioner" becomes diagnostician-identity. Other traditions are deemed "deviation-ignorant." The authentic recognition that all traditions recognize error is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Gol sa distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed "gol sa superiority."

<ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The detailed enumeration of nine deviations—three for view, three for conduct, three for meditation—is interpreted as comprehensive error-catalog requiring vigilance against all nine.

**Why it arises:**
Enumerative completeness triggers anxiety. "Nine" suggests exhaustive coverage. The practitioner assumes listed errors cover all possible mistakes.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is suffocated by deviation-monitoring. The practitioner constantly checks: "Am I in formless absorption? Acting crazy? Meditating on emptiness?" Fear replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deviation-paralysis sets in. Every practice-movement is suspected. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply non-recognition is lost in obsessive error-checking.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 471-472's deviation-consequences. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is paralyzed by fear of the nine deviations.

<ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between "those with deviations" and "those who have cut deviations" is interpreted as establishing two classes of practitioners with different essences.

**Why it arises:**
Typological thinking triggers essentialism. "With/without" suggests categorical difference. The practitioner wants "without deviation" status.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-available-to-all-despite-deviation nature is lost. Deviation-free status becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes some are inherently deviation-prone.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Deviation-free" becomes exclusive identity. Those showing deviation-signs are deemed inferior capacity. The authentic recognition that deviation is simply momentary non-recognition is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Deviation-status becomes capacity-marker. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having cut deviations."

<epistemic-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The deviation-consequences—falling into god realms, becoming demons, falling into formless absorptions—are interpreted as literal fates to be avoided.

**Why it arises:**
Consequential language triggers literal fear. "Fall into" suggests destination. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate real dangers.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-error nature of consequences is lost. The practitioner believes in literal bad-rebirths from wrong-meditation. Soteriological fear replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fear-based practice emerges. Teachers promising "safety from deviations" gain authority. The authentic recognition that consequences are simply continued non-recognition is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Consequence-metaphors are literalized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner practices from fear.

[COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The deviation section's length triggers "get through this" mentality. The practitioner wants to "finish deviations" and reach "practitioner types" and colophon.

**Why it arises:**
Dense fear-content creates resistance. Length suggests obstacle. The practitioner wants "positive conclusion."

**Primary consequence:**
The protective integration of deviation-teaching is missed. The practitioner has "read" deviations without absorbing them. Information substitutes for discernment.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward dismissive pattern. Difficult sections are glossed over. The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached without deviation-awareness.

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 471-472's deviation-cuts are not understood. Arriving at PAGE 479 without discernment, the practitioner misses the colophon's grounding function.

<ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The "cutting deviations" (gol sa bcad) terminology is interpreted as establishing dzogchen's unique possession of deviation-elimination technology.

**Why it arises:**
Technical terminology signals expertise. "Cut" suggests surgical precision. The practitioner wants superior cutting-tools.

**Primary consequence:**
The universal-availability of recognition is lost. Gol sa bcad becomes dzogchen-exclusive method. Elitism emerges around "having cut."

**Secondary consequences:**
"Cutter" becomes practitioner-identity. Other traditions are deemed "uncut." The authentic recognition that all paths cut deviation through recognition is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. "Cutting" metaphors are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "cut" conceptually without recognition.

<ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The instruction that "cutting deviations" requires "settling recognition with its radiance at the sense-gates" is interpreted as technique to be executed precisely.

**Why it arises:**
Instructional language triggers technique-assumption. "Settling" suggests action. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate procedures.

**Primary consequence:**
The non-effort nature of recognition is obscured by technique-anxiety. The practitioner worries about "correct settling." Recognition is replaced by position-achievement.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Settling techniques" proliferate. Teachers who specify precise methods gain authority. The authentic recognition that recognition is not a position is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] continues through PAGE 472's deviation-details. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is exhausted by technique-accumulation.

<ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between "those with deviations" (sem lam byed) and "those who see directly" (rig pa mngon sum) is interpreted as establishing ontological practitioner-types.

**Why it arises:**
Typological language triggers essentialism. "See directly" suggests superior capacity. The practitioner wants superior type.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-available-to-all nature is lost. Direct-seeing becomes elitist attainment. The practitioner believes some are inherently "direct-seeers."

**Secondary consequences:**
"Direct-seer" becomes exclusive identity. Mind-path practitioners are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that direct-seeing is simply present recognition is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Direct-seeing status becomes capacity-marker. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "being direct-seer."

<epistemic-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The description of "not going to extremes of dullness or excitation" and "not being moved by conceptual investigation" is interpreted as precise phenomenological standards to maintain.

**Why it arises:**
Phenomenological language triggers experience-matching. "Not" suggests prohibition. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate requirements.

**Primary consequence:**
Natural recognition is suffocated by state-monitoring. The practitioner constantly checks: "Am I dull? Excited? Conceptual?" Self-policing replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
State-anxiety consumes practice. Teachers promising "correct state" validation gain authority. The authentic recognition that states don't matter is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. State-distinctions are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is trapped in state-optimization.

[COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The approach to volume's end triggers "just finish" mentality. The practitioner wants to "complete deviations" and reach colophon.

**Why it arises:**
Proximity to end triggers momentum. Dense technical content creates fatigue. The practitioner wants "closure."

**Primary consequence:**
The integration-function of deviation-teaching is missed. The practitioner has "finished" deviations without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward rushed-pattern. Final sections are skimmed. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "just ending."

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 472's deviation-cuts are not contextualized. Arriving at PAGE 479 without integration, the practitioner misses dedication's importance.

<ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The "spontaneous liberation" (thal byung du grol) and "arising-there liberated" (shar thog tu grol) descriptions are interpreted as special attainment-marks.

**Why it arises:**
Liberation-language triggers achievement-association. "Spontaneous" suggests advanced. The practitioner wants spontaneous-liberation status.

**Primary consequence:**
The always-already nature of liberation is lost. Spontaneous liberation becomes elite experience. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition is insufficient.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Spontaneously liberated" becomes exclusive identity. Gradual practitioners are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that liberation is not an attainment is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Liberation-metaphors are reified. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has "achieved" spontaneous liberation conceptually.

<ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between ground-expanse-awareness (gzhi'i dbyings rig), path-expanse-awareness (lam gyi dbyings rig), and fruition-expanse-awareness ('bras bu'i dbyings rig) is interpreted as establishing three ontological types of awareness or three classes of practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
Tripartite structure triggers typological thinking. "Ground, path, fruition" suggests developmental stages. The practitioner wants "fruition" awareness.

**Primary consequence:**
The single-nature of all awareness is fragmented into hierarchical types. The practitioner believes fruition-awareness is superior. Elitism emerges around "which awareness one has."

**Secondary consequences:**
"Fruition-awareness practitioner" becomes advanced identity. Ground-awareness practitioners are deemed beginners. The authentic recognition that all three are aspects of single awareness is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 474-475's capacity distinctions. Awareness-type becomes capacity-marker. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having fruition-awareness."
