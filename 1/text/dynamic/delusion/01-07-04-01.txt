**Misreading:**
Reader understands Ground - essence, nature, capacity as a stage in a developmental sequence, deferring completion until prerequisites are met.

**Why it arises:**
Achievement-oriented psychology and hierarchical social structures impose staircase models. The desire for measurable advancement supports stage-fixation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Ground - essence, nature, capacity is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.

**Secondary consequences:**
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'

**Cascade effects:**
<experience substantialism> Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.

[10107-10131] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Reader interprets Ground - essence, nature, capacity through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.

**Why it arises:**
Linear time consciousness and developmental psychology impose sequential frameworks. The fear of missing steps drives temporal sequencing.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Ground - essence, nature, capacity is timeless, never unfolding, is entirely lost. Time-based becoming replaces timeless presence.

**Secondary consequences:**
The present moment is perpetually sacrificed to future attainment. Practice congeals into preparation rather than recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers all error types. The entire framework solidifies as temporal development model.

Reader adopts Ground - empty essence, clear nature, pervasive compassion as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Ground - empty essence, clear nature, pervasive compassion is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Ground - empty essence, clear nature, pervasive compassion is natural expression, not goal to achieve, is entirely abandoned. Seeking replaces finding.

**Why it arises:**
Skill-acquisition models from education and training unconsciously impose technique-mastery frameworks. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports mechanism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Ground - empty essence, clear nature, pervasive compassion is recognition, not technique, is entirely lost. Practice congeals into doing rather than being.
