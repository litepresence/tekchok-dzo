[8687-8688] <practice-error> [POSTURE FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
The physical posture instructions (lion's leap, joints bent, chest hollowed) are interpreted as literal gymnastic requirements that mechanically produce realization when held correctly, like asanas in hatha yoga.

**Why it arises:**
Physicalist frameworks assume form determines consciousness. The detailed anatomical instructions suggest biomechanical causation. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports posture-obsession.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that posture supports but does not cause recognition is entirely lost. Practitioners injure themselves forcing positions while neglecting the view that makes posture meaningful.

**Secondary consequences:**
Flexibility competition replaces wisdom inquiry. Those with physical limitations believe themselves excluded from realization. The energetic dimensions of posture are reduced to muscular mechanics.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <progress tracking>. Subsequent pages on channel practices will be approached as physical manipulations rather than energetic recognitions.

[8689-8698] [VIEW ERROR] [CAUSAL SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The "key points" (gnad) are understood as mechanical switches that automatically cut samsara or liberate bliss when properly executed, like pressing buttons on a spiritual machine.

**Why it arises:**
Technological causation models project onto subtle body. The imperative language ("cuts the root," "liberates") suggests automatic efficacy. The desire for guaranteed results without recognition supports mechanism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that key points only work when informed by view is entirely obscured. Practice becomes technique-collection rather than recognition-deepening.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners accumulate "key points" without understanding their purpose. Guru devotion degenerates into technique-transmission seeking. The causal chain of dependent origination is replaced by push-button causality.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <experience substantialism>. Subsequent descriptions of bliss will be treated as automatic physiological responses rather than recognition-based experiences.

[8699-8708] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [BLISS REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
The three blisses of the three kayas (held at root = dharmakaya bliss, at navel = sambhogakaya bliss, at tip = nirmanakaya bliss) are treated as substantially different physical sensations to be pursued and accumulated.

**Why it arises:**
Somatic mapping frameworks project subtle body geography onto physical anatomy. The localization language suggests discrete, graspable experiences. Desire for variety and accumulation drives differentiation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that all bliss is the single taste of dharmakaya is entirely lost. Practitioners chase location-specific sensations while missing the non-local essence.

**Secondary consequences:**
Competition around "which bliss have you experienced" replaces recognition. Practitioners manipulate physical conditions seeking specific sensations. The ground of bliss is abandoned for bliss-fragments.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <progress tracking>. Subsequent pages on four joys will be approached as sensation-accumulation sequence.

[8709-8718] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [SYLLABLE SEQUENCING]
**Misreading:**
The progression through Oṃ (body vajra), Āḥ (speech vajra), and Hūṃ (mind vajra) is interpreted as a temporal sequence requiring systematic development, with Hūṃ as advanced attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Developmental psychology frameworks impose sequential learning models. The distinct syllables suggest progressive curriculum. Fear of skipping "basics" drives sequential obsession.

**Primary consequence:**
The simultaneous presence of all three vajras is obscured. Practitioners get stuck in "body practice" indefinitely, deferring "mind practice." The non-dual essence is abandoned for graduated approach.

**Secondary consequences:**
Elitist hierarchies form around which syllable one is "working with." The unity of body-speech-mind is never recognized because they are kept separate in practice. Fragmentation replaces integration.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers all error types. The trekcho framework will be misread through sequencing lens.

[8719-8723] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [SYMBOL ACCUMULATION]
**Misreading:**
The generation of lotus (E), bell (Hrīḥ), and pistil (Ha) is interpreted as building up complex visualizations piece by piece, with each component adding to the final accomplishment.

**Why it arises:**
Architectural construction metaphors project onto visualization. The additive language ("generating," "building") suggests accumulation mechanics. Desire for impressive, detailed visualizations supports complexity-obsession.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that all symbols are simultaneously present as the display of awareness is lost. Practice becomes visualization-construction project rather than recognition of what already is.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners spend years "perfecting" visualizations without recognizing their nature. Pride in complexity replaces simplicity of recognition. The symbol is fetishized over the symbolized.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <view error>. Subsequent pages on deity yoga will be approached as construction projects rather than recognition practices.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page contains subtle body posture and syllable practices. Preceding pages established ritual mechanism errors that carry forward—practitioners will combine mantra-mechanism with posture-fixation. Following pages (204+) discuss empowerment processes that will be misunderstood through lens of mechanical efficacy.
