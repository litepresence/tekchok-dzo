<anatomical-literalism> [MUDRA AS PHYSICAL]
**Misreading:**
The term "mudra" (phyag rgya) in this context is interpreted as referring to physical hand gestures or sexual positions, , avoiding the symbolic/semiotic nature of all appearance.

**Why it arises:**
Terminological confusion. "Mudra" commonly means hand gesture in other Buddhist contexts. Sexual yoga associations with the term.

**Primary consequence:**
Physicalist reduction. The practitioner seeks physical sexual practices mudra as nature of appearance.

**Secondary consequences:**
Technique obsession; missing symbolic dimensions; confusion between outer and inner mudra.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-fetishism> through physical interpretation.
<practice-path-confusion> through outer/inner confusion.

<somatic-obsession> [BODY BLISS AS PHYSICAL PLEASURE]
**Misreading:**
The description of "bliss depending upon one's own body" is interpreted as referring to physical/sexual pleasure or sensations, rather than non-conceptual recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Sensory reductionism. "Bliss" (bde ba) suggests pleasure. Somatic culture reduces experience to bodily sensation.

**Primary consequence:**
Pleasure-seeking. The practitioner pursues physical sensations believing they are the path.

**Secondary consequences:**
Sensation-addiction; confusing physical pleasure with spiritual bliss; hedonistic spirituality.

**Cascade effects:**
<experience-substantialism> through sensation-fetishism.
<meditationism-error> through pleasure-cultivation.

<temporal-progression> [VIEW STAGES AS DEVELOPMENT]
**Misreading:**
The threefold temporal structure (shifting view, obtaining view, stable view) is interpreted as developmental stages one progresses through sequentially.

**Why it arises:**
Developmental psychology bias. Sequential description invites progressive reading. Modern growth models.

**Primary consequence:**
Stage-climbing. The practitioner believes they advance from "shifting" to "obtaining" to "stable" view.

**Secondary consequences:**
Progress-measurement; deferring "stable view" to future; view-hierarchy.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through stage model.
<progress-tracking> through view-development.

<kaya-hierarchy> [THREE KAYAS AS LEVELS]
**Misreading:**
"Proceeding to the ground of the Three Kayas" is interpreted as establishing three sequential grounds or levels of attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Numerical sequence bias. "Three" with "proceeding" suggests progression. Kaya distinctions invite hierarchy.

**Primary consequence:**
Sequential kaya-climbing. The practitioner believes they progress through Dharmakaya → Sambhogakaya → Nirmanakaya.

**Secondary consequences:**
Kaya-competition; delaying "higher" kayas; missing simultaneous presence.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through kaya-sequencing.
<elitism-error> through kaya-hierarchy.

<wind-manipulation> [WIND CONTROL AS TECHNIQUE]
**Misreading:**
The detailed wind/energy practices (drawing upward, blocking channels, holding) are interpreted as physical techniques that produce results through correct execution.

**Why it arises:**
Technique-formation. Detailed instructions invite mechanistic interpretation. Pranayama and qi-gong parallels.

**Primary consequence:**
Breath-control obsession. The practitioner focuses on manipulating winds.

**Secondary consequences:**
Physical strain; wind-obsession; missing that winds express view.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-fetishism> through breath-control.
<embodiment-reductionism> through somatic manipulation.

<substantialism-error> [BINDU AS PHYSICAL SUBSTANCE]
**Misreading:**
The description of bindu (thig le) not leaking, mixed with bodhicitta, compared to acacia juice, is interpreted as referring to literal physical substance requiring retention.

**Why it arises:**
Literal somatic reading. "Bodhicitta" here means sexual fluid. Fluid retention practices in tantra.

**Primary consequence:**
Fluid-obsession. The practitioner focuses on physical retention believing it causes realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Physical strain; sexual dysfunction; missing that bindu is metaphor for non-conceptual essence.

**Cascade effects:**
<somatic-reductionism> through fluid-literalism.
<technique-fetishism> through retention-practice.

<magical-thinking> [DIETARY PRESCRIPTIONS AS CAUSAL]
**Misreading:**
The dietary prescriptions (avoid alcohol, salt broth, eat three white foods) are interpreted as causal requirements that mechanically dispel obstacles.

**Why it arises:**
Dietary causation beliefs. Food-medicine models. Ritual purification associations.

**Primary consequence:**
Diet-fetishism. The practitioner believes specific foods cause spiritual results.

**Secondary consequences:**
Food-obsession; purity rituals; missing that dietary advice supports practice context, not causes realization.

**Cascade effects:**
<magical-thinking> through food-causality.
<ritual-formalism> through dietary-rules.

---

<syllable-magic> [OM AH HUM AS MECHANICAL BLESSING]
**Misreading:**
The instruction to emit "Om Ah Hum" is interpreted as establishing syllables as mechanically effective blessings that enter body/speech/mind automatically.

**Why it arises:**
Mantra literalism. Seed syllables have power associations. Blessing-language suggests causality.

**Primary consequence:**
Sound-magic. The practitioner believes uttering syllables causes three-kaya blessings.

**Secondary consequences:**
Vocal obsession; pronunciation anxiety; missing that syllables represent recognition, not cause it.

**Cascade effects:**
<mantra-fetishism> through sound-causality.
<ritual-mechanism> through syllable-power.
