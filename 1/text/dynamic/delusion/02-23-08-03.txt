<liberation-timing-quantification> <skad-cig-bsdebs>

**Misreading:**
The distinction between momentary recognition (*skad cig ma*) and samadhi days (*bsam gtan gyi zhag*) interpreted as quantifiable time units for liberation, creating measurement obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Three moments" suggests countable units. "Samadhi days" implies measurable duration. Time-quantification provides apparent structure.

**Primary consequence:**
Liberation-scheduling: treating awakening as time-calculable event. Natural timelessness obscured by temporal quantification.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need three moments to liberate"
- Not seeing that moments are pedagogical, not chronological
- Clock-watching during practice
- Reifying liberation as temporal endpoint

**Cascade effects:**
<liberation-timing-quantification> triggers <temporal-obsession> [clock-watching] generates <measurement-anxiety> [not enough time] leads to <natural-timelessness-miss> [liberation outside time]

<recognition-coverage-delusion> <rtogs-pas-khyab>

**Misreading:**
The statement that recognition (*ngo shes*) pervades/covers all moments interpreted as intellectual understanding being sufficient for liberation.

**Why it arises:**
"Covers" suggests comprehension. "Recognition" implies cognitive knowing. Intellectual mastery feels like progress.

**Primary consequence:**
Understanding-pride: equating knowledge with liberation. Natural recognition obscured by conceptual mastery.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I understand the teaching, therefore I'm liberated"
- Unrecognized: that recognition is direct, not intellectual
- Confusing explanation with realization
- Reifying comprehension as achievement

**Cascade effects:**
<recognition-coverage-delusion> generates <intellectual-pride> [understanding as mastery] → <explanation-conflation> [teaching as realization] → <natural-recognition-miss> [knowing vs seeing]

<samadhi-non-recognition-waiting> <bsam-gtan-lhun-grub>

**Misreading:**
The existence of natural samadhi without recognition interpreted as permission to wait for spontaneous liberation without effort.

**Why it arises:**
"Without recognition" suggests automatic process. "Natural" implies effortless. Laziness seeks justification.

**Primary consequence:**
Spontaneity-complacency: using naturalness as excuse for non-practice. Natural recognition obscured by passive waiting.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "It happens naturally, so I don't need to practice"
- Missing that natural samadhi still requires recognition
- Reifying spontaneity as bypass
- Waiting-mindset instead of recognizing

**Cascade effects:**
<samadhi-non-recognition-waiting> creates <passive-complacency> [waiting for natural] → <recognition-neglect> [not seeing] → <natural-samadhi-miss> [nature already present]

<three-moment-samadhi-dichotomy> <skad-cig-gsum-zhag>

**Misreading:**
The dichotomy between three moments and samadhi days interpreted as two distinct liberation paths requiring choice.

**Why it arises:**
"Dichotomy" suggests either/or. "Three" vs "days" implies different methods. Choice creates hierarchy.

**Primary consequence:**
Path-comparison: ranking moment-recognition vs samadhi-stability. Natural unity obscured by method-dualism.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Moment recognition is faster/better"
- Missing that both describe same nature
- Reifying methods as distinct
- Choosing sides in non-dual recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<three-moment-samadhi-dichotomy> generates <method-dualism> [either/or] → <hierarchy-creation> [ranking paths] → <natural-unity-miss> [all methods one]

<present-day-misinterpretation> <da-lta'i-zhag>

**Misreading:**
The interpretation of "samadhi days" as present calendar days interpreted as literal 24-hour periods, creating calendar-obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Days" suggests calendar time. "Present" implies now. Literal reading of temporal language.

**Primary consequence:**
Calendar-fixation: counting literal days of samadhi. Natural timelessness obscured by clock-time.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I've been in samadhi for 5 days"
- Missing that days are metaphor for stability duration
- Date-counting as spiritual progress
- Reifying duration as achievement

**Cascade effects:**
<present-day-misinterpretation> generates <obscuration>

<bardo-samadhi-transfer> <bar-do-ting-dzin>

**Misreading:**
The application of samadhi days to bardo interpreted as transferring clock-time measurements to intermediate state.

**Why it arises:**
"Bardo" suggests place. "Samadhi days" implies duration. Space-time continuity assumptions.

**Primary consequence:**
Bardo-temporalization: imposing time on intermediate state. Natural timelessness obscured by interval-measurement.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "How many days in bardo samadhi?"
- Missing that bardo transcends ordinary time
- Reifying bardo as temporal location
- Time-anxiety about bardo duration

**Cascade effects:**
<bardo-samadhi-transfer> creates <intermediate-state-temporalization> [time in gap] → <duration-anxiety> [how long] → <natural-timelessness-miss> [bardo timeless]

<three-faculty-hierarchy> <dbang-po-rab-bring-tha>

**Misreading:**
The three faculties—best, middling, least—interpreted as fixed spiritual castes determining liberation potential.

**Why it arises:**
"Best/middling/least" suggests hierarchy. "Faculty" implies innate capacity. Caste-system mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Faculty-determinism: believing one's category limits awakening. Natural equality obscured by hierarchical classification.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm only middling faculty, so liberation takes longer"
- Missing that faculties are descriptive, not prescriptive
- Resignation: "I'm not best faculty"
- Reifying categories as destiny

**Cascade effects:**
<three-faculty-hierarchy> generates <obscuration>

<shooting-star-liberation> <skar-mda'-nam-mkhar>

**Misreading:**
The simile of shooting star racing through space interpreted as liberation being a fast, spectacular event to achieve.

**Why it arises:**
"Shooting star" suggests speed. "Racing" implies velocity. Spectacular events seem significant.

**Primary consequence:**
Speed-obsession: pursuing rapid liberation. Natural non-haste obscured by velocity-fetish.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Liberation should be fast like a shooting star"
- Missing that simile describes natural movement, not goal
- Impatience with gradual recognition
- Reifying speed as spiritual virtue

**Cascade effects:**
<shooting-star-liberation> triggers <velocity-fetish> [speed desire] → <impatience-compulsion> [rushing] → <natural-non-haste-miss> [no speed needed]

<emanation-benefit-achievement> <sprul-pa-don-byed>

**Misreading:**
The capacity for emanation (*sprul pa*) to benefit beings interpreted as special power to develop for helping others.

**Why it arises:**
"Benefit beings" suggests altruistic power. "Emanation" implies magical capacity. Bodhisattva ideal romanticized.

**Primary consequence:**
Power-accumulation: pursuing emanation ability. Natural benefit obscured by capability-seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to develop emanation power to help others"
- Missing that benefit is natural display, not power
- Spiritual materialism of capacity-collection
- Reifying help as special ability

**Cascade effects:**
<emanation-benefit-achievement> triggers <power-accumulation> [capacity seeking] → <bodhisattva-romanticism> [heroic fantasy] → <natural-benefit-miss> [help already happening]

<ka-dag-non-division-pride> <ka-dag-mi-gyed>

**Misreading:**
The statement that emanations don't divide from ka-dag interpreted as achievement of non-dual state preventing all activity.

**Why it arises:**
"Don't divide" suggests unity achievement. "Ka-dag" implies primordial purity. Non-dual pride.

**Primary consequence:**
Non-dual-complacency: using unity as excuse for non-engagement. Natural display obscured by purity-fixation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm in ka-dag, so I don't need to emanate"
- Missing that non-division allows display
- Reifying purity as inactive state
- Withdrawal mistaken for realization

**Cascade effects:**
<ka-dag-non-division-pride> produces <non-dual-complacency> [unity as excuse] → <withdrawal-mistake> [inactivity] → <natural-display-miss> [activity in unity]

<lhun-grub-manifestation-dependency> <lhun-grub-gzhi-snang>

**Misreading:**
The manifestation from lhun grub basis interpreted as dependent arising requiring specific conditions.

**Why it arises:**
"Basis" suggests foundation. "Manifestation" implies dependent production. Causality assumptions.

**Primary consequence:**
Condition-dependency: waiting for right basis-manifestation. Natural spontaneity obscured by causal thinking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need the lhun grub basis to manifest"
- Missing that manifestation is self-arising
- Reifying basis as prerequisite
- Waiting for spontaneous appearance

**Cascade effects:**
<lhun-grub-manifestation-dependency> produces <condition-waiting> [basis required] → <causal-thinking> [dependent arising] → <natural-spontaneity-miss> [self-arising]

<dream-benefit-illusion> <rmi-lam-don-byed>

**Misreading:**
The simile of benefiting beings in dreams interpreted as dream yoga technique for practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Dream" suggests technique. "Benefit" implies action. Dream yoga tradition.

**Primary consequence:**
Dream-technique: treating dream simile as method. Natural dreamless-benefit obscured by practice-fixation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I practice dream yoga to benefit beings"
- Missing that dream illustrates illusory nature
- Reifying dream-state as special
- Technique-dependence for benefit

**Cascade effects:**
<dream-benefit-illusion> creates <obscuration>

<grub-mtha'-difficulty-elitism> <grub-mtha'-rtogs-dka'>

**Misreading:**
The statement that this view is difficult to realize interpreted as establishing elitist esotericism.

**Why it arises:**
"Difficult" suggests rarity. "Realize" implies special capacity. Esoteric traditions value exclusivity.

**Primary consequence:**
Difficulty-pride: believing oneself special for understanding. Natural accessibility obscured by elitism.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "This is difficult, so I'm special for getting it"
- Missing that difficulty protects from premature exposure
- Reifying complexity as value
- Exclusion of "unready" practitioners

**Cascade effects:**
<grub-mtha'-difficulty-elitism> leads to <recognition-blocked>

<three-moments-sequentiality> <skad-cig-gsum-du-byed>

**Misreading:**
The "three moments" interpreted as sequential stages to progress through during dissolution.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests sequence. "Moments" implies temporal stages. Developmental thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Moment-sequencing: treating three as progressive steps. Natural simultaneity obscured by temporal ordering.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm in moment one, moving to moment two"
- Missing that three are aspects, not stages
- Rush to complete the sequence
- Reifying progression as necessary

**Cascade effects:**
<three-moments-sequentiality> creates <stage-progression> [step-by-step] → <completion-anxiety> [finishing moments] → <natural-simultaneity-miss> [all present now]

<four-wisdom-sphere-cessation> <ye-shes-bzhi-tshom-bu>

**Misreading:**
The four wisdoms with spheres ceasing interpreted as loss of positive qualities, creating cessation-fear.

**Why it arises:**
"Ceasing" suggests ending. "Four wisdoms" implies valuable attributes. Loss-aversion.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom-loss-fear: clinging to four wisdoms as possessions. Natural wisdom-display obscured by attribute-attachment.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I don't want the four wisdoms to cease"
- Missing that cessation is exhaustion into nature
- Reifying wisdoms as owned qualities
- Fear of losing spiritual accomplishments

**Cascade effects:**
<four-wisdom-sphere-cessation> → <attribute-clinging> [holding wisdoms] → <cessation-fear> [losing qualities] → <natural-wisdom-miss> [wisdom not possessed]
