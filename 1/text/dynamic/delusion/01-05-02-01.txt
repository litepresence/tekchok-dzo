[4283-4288] <method-dualism> [TREKCHÖ/THÖGAL AS SEPARATE PATHS]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between Trekchö (simultaneous liberation) and Thögal (progressive liberation) is interpreted as establishing two separate paths for different capacity practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
Dualistic thinking. Two methods suggest choice. Capacity-discrimination seems practical.

**Primary consequence:**
Path-dualism. The practitioner believes they must choose between "direct" (Trekchö) and "gradual" (Thögal) approaches.

**Secondary consequences:**
Capacity-typing; elitism about Trekchö; deferring Thögal as "advanced"; missing that both are aspects of single recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<method-dualism> through path-separation.
<capacity-determinism> through faculty-typing.

[4284-4286] <spontaneity-fetishism> [EFFORTLESS AS PASSIVE]
**Misreading:**
"Primordially liberated without returning to basis" is interpreted as establishing that no effort whatsoever is needed, just passive resting.

**Why it arises:**
"Without effort" suggests passivity. Laziness finds confirmation. Misunderstanding of effortless.

**Primary consequence:**
Passive non-practice. The practitioner believes they should do nothing.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dullness mistaken for natural mind; missing that effortless requires recognition; complacency.

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-abandonment> through passive-misinterpretation.
<dullness-error> through torpor-mistake.

[4287-4306] <technique-accumulation> [THREE KEY POINTS AS REQUIREMENTS]
**Misreading:**
The three key points (body, aperture, object) are interpreted as establishing three requirements that must all be mastered.

**Why it arises:**
Comprehensiveness compulsion. Three suggests completeness. Fear of missing elements.

**Primary consequence:**
Key-point-anxiety. The practitioner worries about having all three correct.

**Secondary consequences:**
Technique-checking; formalism; missing that three describe single recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<perfectionism-paralysis> through requirement-checking.
<technique-fetishism> through point-mastery.

[4307-4327] <posture-essentialism> [LION/ELEPHANT/SEER AS MANDATORY]
**Misreading:**
The three postures (lion, elephant, rishi) are interpreted as establishing mandatory physical positions required for realization.

**Why it arises:**
Posture literalism. Animal names suggest specific forms. Physical causation belief.

**Primary consequence:**
Posture-obsession. The practitioner believes correct posture causes realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Physical strain; flexibility-competition; missing that postures support, not cause.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-fetishism> through posture-requirement.
<physical-obsession> through form-causality.

[4311-4322] <stillness-fetishism> [DWELLING AS FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
The repeated emphasis on "dwelling" (sdod pa) in pure expanse, rigpa, and appearances is interpreted as establishing stillness or fixation as the goal.

**Why it arises:**
"Dwelling" suggests stability. Peacefulness appeals. Confusing stability with recognition.

**Primary consequence:**
Stillness-seeking. The practitioner tries to make mind still and fixed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dullness; suppression; missing that dwelling is non-wandering, not fixation.

**Cascade effects:**
<dullness-error> through stillness-seeking.
<suppression> through fixation-effort.

[4323-4327] <tantra-identification> [METHOD TANTRA AS SUPERIOR]
**Misreading:**
The classification as "method tantra" (thabs kyi rgyud) is interpreted as establishing that method/technique is the essential feature, privileging technique over nature.

**Why it arises:**
Method-preference. "Method" suggests active approach. Wanting concrete practices.

**Primary consequence:**
Method-elitism. The practitioner believes this tantra is superior because it has methods.

**Secondary consequences:**
Technique-accumulation; missing nature tantra; dualism of method/nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-elitism> through method-privileging.
<dualistic-grasping> through method/nature split.

---

[4328-4336] <ground-path-result-temporalization> [THREE AS STAGES]
**Misreading:**
The threefold structure (ground, path, result) is interpreted as establishing developmental stages one progresses through.

**Why it arises:**
Temporal thinking. Three suggests sequence. Journey metaphor.

**Primary consequence:**
Stage-climbing. The practitioner believes they progress from ground to result.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring result; measuring progress; missing simultaneity.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through stage-model.
<progress-tracking> through advancement-measurement.

---

[4337-4362] <three-tantra-hierarchy> [GROUND/ESSENCE/SEED AS LEVELS]
**Misreading:**
The three tantras (ground nature, essence, seed) are interpreted as hierarchy or progression, with "seed" (result) as highest.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking. Three items invite ranking. "Seed" suggests fruition.

**Primary consequence:**
Tantra-hierarchy. The practitioner seeks "seed tantra" as most advanced.

**Secondary consequences:**
Skipping ground/essence; premature result-focus; missing that three describe single nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<elitism-error> through hierarchy.
<practice-path-confusion> through premature advancement.

---

[4341-4362] <kadag-literalism> [PRIMORDIAL PURITY AS STATE]
**Misreading:**
The description of ground nature tantra's primordial purity is interpreted as establishing a state of purity that exists from beginning and can be accessed.

**Why it arises:**
State-thinking. "Primordially pure" suggests existing condition. Wanting to "access" purity.

**Primary consequence:**
Purity-state seeking. The practitioner tries to access or enter primordial purity.

**Secondary consequences:**
Seeking special state; missing that ka dag is how things are, not state to enter.

**Cascade effects:**
<state-seeking> through purity-access.
<experience-substantialism> through state-fetishism.

---

[4363-4375] <lhungrub-achievement> [SPONTANEOUS COMPLETION AS RESULT]
**Misreading:**
The description of spontaneous completion (lhun grub) is interpreted as establishing a result or achievement that manifests naturally.

**Why it arises:**
Achievement thinking. "Completion" suggests result. Natural process implies development.

**Primary consequence:**
Result-seeking. The practitioner waits for spontaneous completion to happen.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring to future; passive expectation; missing that lhun grub is present display.

**Cascade effects:**
<future-dependency> through result-waiting.
<passivity> through spontaneous-misinterpretation.
