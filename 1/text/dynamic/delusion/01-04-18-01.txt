[3888-3889] <somatic-error> [WIND IN CHANNELS AS PHYSIOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The instruction about "vital-point wind abiding in channels" is interpreted as literal physiological technique requiring manipulation of subtle body energies.

**Why it arises:**
Somatic literalism. "Wind" and "channels" suggest anatomy. Modern interest in "embodiment" supports somatic reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Physicalist completion stage. The practitioner tries to physically control winds and channels as anatomical structures.

**Secondary consequences:**
Forceful breathing practices; physical strain; missing that "wind" is metaphor for awareness-movement.

**Cascade effects:**
<embodiment-fetishism> through somatic reduction.
<technique-fetishism> through physiological manipulation.

[3890-3891] <dualistic-error> [SEVERING DEBATE AS RESOLUTION]
**Misreading:**
The "essential point of severing debate between Buddhas and sentient beings" is interpreted as establishing non-dual view where the distinction is intellectually resolved or dissolved.

**Why it arises:**
Intellectual resolution habit. "Severing debate" sounds like philosophical conclusion. The mind wants to "solve" the Buddha/sentient-being duality.

**Primary consequence:**
Conceptual non-duality. The practitioner believes they must intellectually understand Buddha and sentient beings as "really" non-dual.

**Secondary consequences:**
Philosophical position-taking; "all beings are already Buddhas" as belief; missing that severing means cutting through conceptual fabrication entirely.

**Cascade effects:**
<view-attachment> through adopting non-dual position.
<intellectualism> through conceptual resolution.

[3891-3892] <dissociative-error> [BODY-MIND SEVERANCE AS ESCAPE]
**Misreading:**
The "essential point of severing body-mind connection" is interpreted as dissociative technique for transcending physical embodiment.

**Why it arises:**
Body-as-obstacle view. "Severing" suggests liberation from body. Cartesian dualism supports body-mind separation.

**Primary consequence:**
Disembodied spirituality. The practitioner seeks to escape body into "pure mind" or awareness.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dissociation; neglect of body; spiritual bypassing of embodiment; out-of-body ambitions.

**Cascade effects:**
<dissociation-error> through body-mind split.
<fundamental-delusion> through rejecting appearance.

[3892-3892] <movement-error> [NATURAL LIBERATION AS PASSIVITY]
**Misreading:**
"Arising's self-liberation" is interpreted as passive "letting whatever happens happen" approach, abandoning all discipline or engagement.

**Why it arises:**
Passive misinterpretation of spontaneity. "Self-liberation" sounds like no effort needed. Misunderstanding of "non-action."

**Primary consequence:**
Lazy non-practice. The practitioner believes they don't need to do anything because everything "liberates itself."

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual lethargy; dullness mistaken for natural mind; abandonment of discernment.

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-abandonment> through passive misinterpretation.
<dullness-error> through mistaking torpor for liberation.
