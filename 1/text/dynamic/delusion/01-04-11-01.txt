[3040-3056] <madhyamaka-confusion> [SVATANTRIKA ILLUSION AS ONTOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The Svatantrika position on illusion (appearing as illusion, merely illusion) is interpreted as establishing positive ontological claim about the nature of reality—that things "are" illusions or have illusion-nature.

**Why it arises:**
Ontological habit. Even "illusion" becomes positive predicate. Familiarity with "life is dream" trope supports illusion-ontology.

**Primary consequence:**
Making illusion the "what" of existence. The practitioner believes reality is "made of illusion" like some kind of ontological substance.

**Secondary consequences:**
Illusion-mysticism; "everything is unreal" as metaphysical position; confusing epistemological limitation with ontological status.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through making illusion into something.
<nihilistic-error> through taking illusion as non-existence.

[3042-3052] <teleological-error> [BUDDHA WISDOM AS RESULT]
**Misreading:**
The description of obtaining Buddha's illusion-like wisdom and working benefit is interpreted as teleological achievement—what practice produces at the end.

**Why it arises:**
Goal-oriented thinking. "Obtain" and "result at end" suggest acquisition. The passage appears to describe what enlightened beings have.

**Primary consequence:**
Making Buddha-wisdom future attainment. The practitioner believes they must practice to "get" this wisdom.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring recognition; seeking illusion-like experience; spiritual materialism of "attaining" wisdom.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through result-orientation.
<meditationism-error> through practice-to-obtain model.

[3053-3056] <hierarchical-error> [SVATANTRIKA AS LOWER]
**Misreading:**
The label "autonomous lower" (rang rgyud 'og ma) is interpreted as value judgment, confirming Prasangika superiority and Svatantrika inadequacy.

**Why it arises:**
Tibetan doxographical hierarchy. Modern presentations often rank Prasangika as "highest." "lower" suggests inferiority.

**Primary consequence:**
Dismissing Svatantrika. The practitioner believes they can ignore "lower" view, missing its pedagogical function.

**Secondary consequences:**
View-elitism; sectarianism; missing that Svatantrika has own valid purpose for certain practitioners.

**Cascade effects:**
<sectarianism> through hierarchical ranking.
<view-attachment> through adopting "higher" view.

[3057-3061] <nihilistic-error> [PRASANGIKA AS TOTAL NEGATION]
**Misreading:**
The Prasangika position (not even illusion abides, no self-awareness, like barren woman's son) is interpreted as absolute nihilism denying all existence, experience, and reality.

**Why it arises:**
Negation literalism. "Not even illusion" suggests total emptiness. Absence of positive terms invites nihilistic reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking Prasangika as nihilism. The practitioner believes nothing exists at all, including awareness itself.

**Secondary consequences:**
Paralysis; ethical nihilism; "nothing matters" spirituality; extreme view of emptiness.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilistic-error> through interpreting negation as denial.
<extreme-view> through taking emptiness too far.

[3060-3061] <conventional-ultimate-confusion> [TWO TRUTHS AS SEPARATE]
**Misreading:**
The relationship between conventional and ultimate (conventional not true, therefore ultimate non-abiding) is interpreted as establishing two separate domains or levels of truth.

**Why it arises:**
Two-truth dualism. Traditional formulation presents conventional/ultimate as pair. Dream analogy suggests "real" vs. "unreal" levels.

**Primary consequence:**
Dualistic two-truth theory. The practitioner believes there are "two ways things are" - conventionally one way, ultimately another.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ultimate-reality obsession; dismissing conventional; seeking "really real" beyond appearances.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-bifurcation> through two-level theory.
<fundamental-delusion> through not seeing unity of two truths.
