**Misreading:**
Spontaneous results (*lhun grub*) interpreted as fruits that appear automatically without recognition, creating passive waiting.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous" suggests automatic. "Results" implies fruits. Passivity-justification.

**Primary consequence:**
Result-waiting: expecting awakening without engagement. Natural spontaneity obscured by laziness.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "It will happen spontaneously when ready"
- Missing that spontaneity requires recognition
- Reifying automatic as effortless
- Complacent inaction

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneous-result-waiting> → <passive-complacency> [waiting] → <recognition-neglect> [not seeing] → <natural-spontaneity-miss> [active spontaneity]

**Misreading:**
Attainment of three kayas interpreted as progressive achievement to unlock sequentially.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests sequence. "Attainment" implies achievement. Developmental thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Kaya-climbing: pursuing three bodies as stages. Natural simultaneity obscured by progression.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I attained dharmakaya, working on sambhogakaya"
- Missing that three are inseparable
- Reifying separation as growth
- Spiritual level-hierarchy

**Cascade effects:**
<three-kaya-progression> → <stage-climbing> [body by body] → <hierarchy-creation> [ranking kayas] → <natural-simultaneity-miss> [three are one]

**Misreading:**
Result completion interpreted as checklist of accomplishments to verify.

**Why it arises:**
"Completion" suggests verification. "Result" implies output. Quality-control mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Completion-checking: verifying attainment markers. Natural completion obscured by validation-seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Have I completed all results?"
- Missing that completion is recognition
- Reifying results as measurable outputs
- Attainment-anxiety

**Cascade effects:**
<result-completion-checklist> → <validation-seeking> [checking boxes] → <attainment-anxiety> [not complete] → <natural-completion-miss> [already complete]

**Misreading:**
"Natural/spontaneous" (*lhun grub*) interpreted as "automatic" requiring no participation.

**Why it arises:**
"Natural" suggests effortless. "Spontaneous" implies automatic. Effort-avoidance.

**Primary consequence:**
Automatic-misunderstanding: using naturalness as excuse. Natural dynamism obscured by passivity.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "It's natural so I don't need to do anything"
- Missing that spontaneity is dynamic engagement
- Reifying natural as inactive
- Withdrawal as practice

**Cascade effects:**
<natural-automatic-confusion> → <effortless-misunderstanding> [no engagement] → <passive-withdrawal> [doing nothing] → <natural-dynamism-miss> [active naturalness]

**Misreading:**
The occurrence of fruition interpreted as special event marking enlightenment.

**Why it arises:**
"Occurrence" suggests happening. "Fruition" implies result. Event-fetish.

**Primary consequence:**
Event-seeking: pursuing fruition-moment. Natural ever-fruition obscured by occasion-hunting.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "When will fruition occur?"
- Missing that fruition is always present
- Reifying awakening as event
- Disappointment at ordinariness

**Cascade effects:**
<fruition-event-achievement> → <occasion-hunting> [waiting for event] → <ordinariness-disappointment> [not special] → <natural-ever-fruition-miss> [always fruit]

[16385-16408] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) interpreted as static resting in natural state.

**Why it arises:**
"Presence" suggests abiding. "Natural" implies rest. Stasis-comfort.

**Primary consequence:**
Static-complacency: mistaking presence for inactivity. Natural dynamism obscured by fixation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm just resting in spontaneous presence"
- Missing that presence is dynamic display
- Reifying rest as goal
- Inactivity as practice

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneous-presence-complacency> → <static-fixation> [not moving] → <dynamic-avoidance> [resisting change] → <natural-dynamism-miss> [presence is active]
