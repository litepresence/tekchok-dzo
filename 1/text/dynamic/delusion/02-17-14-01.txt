<trekcho-completion-achievement> [basis-establishment]

**Misreading:**
Reading "rang sa zin te" as having "achieved" Trekcho via coronation ceremony. Royal analogy triggers achievement psychology—practice becomes stabilizing a possession.

**Why it arises:**
Coronation marks transition to rulership, suggesting Trekcho requires such transition moment.

**Primary consequence:**
Subtle grasping at view as possession; practice oriented toward "confirming" recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-completion-achievement> produces <view-completion-pride> triggers <reification-error>

<cloud-sky-confusion> [basis-display-separation]

**Misreading:**
Interpreting "gzhi stongs pas" as consciousness "emptying into" ground, treating gzhi as container receiving contents.

**Why it arises:**
Military analogy suggests spatial framework—consciousnesses occupy ground.

**Primary consequence:**
Duality between "mind that perceives" and "ground of perception" under guise of non-duality.

**Cascade effects:**
<cloud-sky-confusion> → <formless-samadhi-addiction> → <nihilistic-error>

<liberation-event> [freedom-as-attainment]

**Misreading:**
Reading "rang dbang thob pa" as gaining autonomy—mind achieving independence from conditions.

**Why it arises:**
Captured-minister analogy evokes personal freedom narrative; Western autonomy psychology overlays dbang terminology.

**Primary consequence:**
Afflictive consciousnesses seen as obstacles to free from rather than self-liberated.

**Cascade effects:**
<liberation-event> → <psychologization-error> → <rigpa-unseen>

<ka-dag-purity-obsession> [primordial-romanticism]

**Misreading:**
Taking "ye nas de ltar gnas pa" as perfect primordial state requiring discovery; ka dag as ontological perfectionism.

**Why it arises:**
Bse shing fruit analogy suggests inherent potential actualizing; "ye nas" invites reading finished state awaiting recognition.

**Primary consequence:**
Devaluation of practice as "unnecessary"; nihilistic dismissal of relative path.

**Cascade effects:**
<ka-dag-purity-obsession> → <cause-effect-nihilism> → <pedagogical-error>

Deliberate effort to "be spontaneous"—paradox of effort toward effortlessness.

**Cascade effects:**
<lhun-grub-spontaneity-romanticism> → <practice-error> → <pedagogical-error>

---

<three-kaya-reification> [embodiment-achievement]

**Misreading:**
Taking "sku gsum rang la tshang bar rdzogs" as completing three kayas as attainment, treating trikaya as inventory of qualities.

**Why it arises:**
"Thob tu yod pa'i sems nyid" plus "rdzogs" parallels achievement language.

**Primary consequence:**
Trikaya as spiritual trophy rather than nature of awareness.

**Cascade effects:**
<three-kaya-reification> → <samadhi-emanation-materialism> → <eternalistic-error>

---

<recognition-achievement> [heart-essence-possession]

**Misreading:**
Interpreting "snying po yang gsang chen por rdzogs" as completing/reaching heart essence—arrival at destination.

**Why it arises:**
"Yang gsang chen po" triggers treasure-hunting psychology; "rdzogs" suggests progression.

**Primary consequence:**
Heart essence substantialized as hidden jewel; Dzogchen as esoteric attainment.

**Cascade effects:**
<recognition-achievement> → <pedagogical-error> → <ontological-error>

---

<appearances-reification> [phenomenal-substantialism]

**Misreading:**
Reading "snang ba sna tshogs rang shar te" as confirming appearances as real display, missing emptiness.

**Why it arises:**
Detailed phenomenological listing invites naive realism.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes sophisticated realism rather than than recognition of nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<hope-fear-denial> → <cause-effect-nihilism> → <pedagogical-error>

---

<nyon-mong-ngar-grol-distortion> [affliction-romanticism]

**Misreading:**
Reading "rang zhig rang grol" as afflictions automatically self-liberating without recognition.

Snake-knot and water-wave analogies suggest natural self-resolution.

**Primary consequence:**
Passive indulgence in negative emotion under guise of "self-liberation."

**Cascade effects:**
<nyon-mong-ngar-grol-distortion> → <nature-missed> → <practice-error>

---

**Misreading:**
Taking "rang sar dag" as mantra validating all experience as already perfect—license for non-practice.

**Primary consequence:**
Deliberate non-engagement with experience.

**Cascade effects:**
<rang-sar-dog-fetishization> → <nihilistic-error> → <psychologization-error>
