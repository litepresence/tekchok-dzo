<chos-can-reification> [objectification]

**Misreading:** Treating *chos can rang bzhin med* as intellectual categorization—phenomena "possess" emptiness as attribute yet not collapse of the possessing framework.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: mind craves conceptual stability. Cultural: Western privileging of propositional knowledge. Linguistic: *rang bzhin med* invites predication.

**Primary consequence:** Intellectual confidence replaces direct seeing; perceptual habits unchanged.

**Secondary consequences:** Dharma becomes philosophical position; practice becomes view-accumulation.

**Cascade effects:**
<chos-can-reification> triggers <sgyu-ma-illusion-intellectualization> leads to <meditationism-error>
[Reifying empty phenomena triggers conceptualizing illusion → seeking methods to achieve recognition]

<sgyu-ma-illusion-intellectualization> [comparative-metaphor]

**Misreading:** Understanding *sgyu ma* as simile—"things are like illusions"—while avoiding recognition that perception itself is illusory, including perceiver.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: simile format (*dpe brgyad*) invites comparison. Cultural: Western epistemology separates knower/known. Historical: Abhidharma treated maya as pedagogical device.

**Primary consequence:** Perceptual experience remains "real" while objects "unreal"; subject unquestioned.

**Secondary consequences:** "Seeing through illusion" becomes interpretive stance.

**Cascade effects:**
<sgyu-ma-illusion-intellectualization> → <chos-can-reification> → <eternalistic-error>

[3711] <blod-de-comfort-attachment> [spiritual-security]

**Misreading:** Reading *dogs pa med pas blo bde* as goal—cultivating comfort not recognizing ease as fixation's relaxation.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: aversion to doubt, craving certainty. Cultural: Western therapeutic paradigms pathologize discomfort.

**Primary consequence:** Doubt/fear become obstacles; practice becomes comfort-seeking.

**Secondary consequences:** Destabilizing recognition avoided.

**Cascade effects:**
<blod-de-comfort-attachment> → <yon-mongs-rang-grol-affliction-permission> → <chos-bor-ba-dharma-abandonment>

<ye-shes-mig-wisdom-eye-externalization> [faculty-development]

**Misreading:** Understanding *ye shes kyi mig* as capacity to develop—practice strengthens this "eye" to perceive dharmata.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: embodied metaphors invite literalization. Cultural: Western capacity-building models.

**Primary consequence:** Wisdom eye objectified; hierarchical comparison replaces non-dual recognition.

**Secondary consequences:** Elitism based on "sharp faculties."

**Cascade effects:**
<ye-shes-mig-wisdom-eye-externalization> → <dbang-po-khyad-faculty-elitism> → <direct-perception-obstruction>

---

<dbang-po-faculty-dependence> [sense-reification]

**Misreading:** Reading *mig gi dbang po ma 'gags pas* as requiring sensory engagement—realization depends on maintaining perception.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: literal "eye" dominates. Cultural: Western preference for "embodied" meditation.

**Primary consequence:** Sense experience fetishized; deep samadhi resisted as "blocking faculties."

**Secondary consequences:** Aesthetic experiences confused with recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<dbang-po-faculty-dependence> → <meditationism-error> → <peaceful-samadhi-complacency>

---

<chos-nyid-dharmata-objectification> [metaphysical-substrate]

**Misreading:** Understanding *chos nyid* as metaphysical substrate "behind" appearances—what phenomena "really are."

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: essentialist habits. Cultural: Western metaphysical traditions (Platonic forms). Buddhist: Vedantic influence.

**Primary consequence:** Dharmata becomes meditation object; appearance-emptiness split into illusory vs. real.

**Secondary consequences:** Seeking "dharmata experiences" as special states.

**Cascade effects:**
<chos-nyid-dharmata-objectification> → <chos-can-reification> → <eternalistic-error>

<dbyings-rig-gnyis-med-duality-confusion> [philosophical-unity]

**Misreading:** Understanding *dbyings rig gnyis su med pa* as proposition to affirm while preserving the subject affirming unity.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: predication requires distinction. Cultural: Western philosophy of mind debates.

**Primary consequence:** Non-duality becomes objectified view rather than collapse of positions.

**Secondary consequences:** Philosophical debates replace practice.

**Cascade effects:**
<dbyings-rig-gnyis-med-duality-confusion> → <psychologization-error> → <scholarly-collapse-error>

---

<mtshams-boundary-fixation> [staged-progression]

**Misreading:** Understanding three view levels (*phyi*, *nang*, *gsang ba*) as progressive stages—completing outer before inner before secret.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: sequential learning feels natural. Cultural: Western educational models. Buddhist: Tantric yana hierarchy.

**Primary consequence:** Views approached as curriculum; recognition deferred until "ready."

**Secondary consequences:** Spiritual materialism around "highest view."

**Cascade effects:**
<mtshams-boundary-fixation> → <trekcho-completion-achievement> → <liberation-event>

---

<dbang-po-khyad-faculty-elitism> [innate-hierarchy]

**Misreading:** Understanding *dbang po'i khyad* as literal capacity hierarchy—enlightenment probability determined by innate faculty.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: societies rank by ability. Cultural: Western meritocracy/IQ ideology.

**Primary consequence:** "Sharp faculty" arrogance and "dull faculty" inadequacy both block recognition.

**Secondary consequences:** Lineage access restricted.

**Cascade effects:**
<dbang-po-khyad-faculty-elitism> → <direct-perception-obstruction> → <trekcho-completion-achievement>

---

<bar-do-bardo-achievement> [post-death-destination]

**Misreading:** Understanding *bar do* as destination practitioners "reach" upon death—recognition in bardo as attainment to achieve.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: fear of death drives hope for post-death opportunity. Cultural: Western near-death fascination.

**Primary consequence:** Practice becomes preparation for future state; immediacy deferred.

**Secondary consequences:** Neglect of this-life recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<bar-do-bardo-achievement> → <bardo-terror> → <phowa-force-transference>

---

<ri-bo-mountain-peak-romanticism> [geographic-elevation]

**Misreading:** Understanding *ri bo cog gzhag* as literal prescription for mountain retreat—geographic elevation = spiritual elevation.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: elevation metaphors powerful. Cultural: Western wilderness romanticism.

**Primary consequence:** Practice conditional on location; urban practitioners disadvantaged.

**Secondary consequences:** Class barriers to "pure" locations.

**Cascade effects:**
<ri-bo-mountain-peak-romanticism> → <grove-romanticism> → <higher-realm-escalation>

---

<cog-gzhag-leave-as-is-technique> [effort-to-cease-effort]

**Misreading:** Understanding *cog gzhag* as technique—"just leave everything" as mental instruction, effort to cease effort.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: instruction sounds like permission. Cultural: Western therapeutic "acceptance."

**Primary consequence:** "Leaving as is" becomes new technique; monitoring non-alteration perpetuates doer/done.

**Secondary consequences:** Spiritual bypassing; passivity as Dzogchen.

**Cascade effects:**
<cog-gzhag-leave-as-is-technique> → <spontaneous-vision-effort> → <yon-mongs-rang-grol-affliction-permission>

---

<yon-mongs-rang-grol-affliction-permission> [antinomian-bypass]

**Misreading:** Understanding *nyon mongs rang grol* as doctrine that afflictions need not be examined—destructive emotions can be acted out since "already pure."

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: permission to not work on oneself attractive. Cultural: Western spiritual bypassing.

**Primary consequence:** Destructive behavior justified as "Dzogchen practice."

**Secondary consequences:** Lineage scandals; ethics abandoned as "dualistic."

**Cascade effects:**
<yon-mongs-rang-grol-affliction-permission> → <chos-bor-ba-dharma-abandonment> → <psychologization-error>

---

<chos-bor-ba-dharma-abandonment> [transcendence-fantasy]

**Misreading:** Understanding *chos bor ba'i gang zag* as positive—recognition means transcending need for practice, ethics, method.

**Why it arises:** Cognitive: freedom from obligation attractive. Cultural: Western anti-institutionalism.

**Primary consequence:** Genuine recognition confused with abandonment; practitioners stop practice prematurely.

**Secondary consequences:** Spiritual collapse when recognition fails to sustain.

**Cascade effects:**
<chos-bor-ba-dharma-abandonment> → <yon-mongs-rang-grol-affliction-permission> → <nature-missed>
