[4916-4919] <epistemological-error> [DIRECT PERCEPTION AS TECHNIQUE]
**Misreading:**
The classification of four types of direct perception (sense-power, mind, self-awareness, yogic) is interpreted as a four-stage training program or hierarchy of experiences to cultivate sequentially.

**Why it arises:**
Pedagogical framework confusion. The presentation structure suggests progression from coarse (sense) to subtle (yogic), inviting staged practice approach.

**Primary consequence:**
Making direct perception developmental. The practitioner believes they must "work up" to yogic direct perception through preliminary types.

**Secondary consequences:**
Devaluing ordinary perception; seeking extraordinary experiences; yogic elitism about "higher" direct perceptions.

**Cascade effects:**
<progress-tracking> through hierarchical perception model.
<experience-substantialism> through seeking specific perception-types.

[4920-4931] <ontological-error> [ULTIMATE DIRECT AS SEPARATE REALITY]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between conventional and ultimate direct perception is interpreted as referring to two different ontological domains or realities, with ultimate perception revealing a "higher" truth inaccessible to conventional cognition.

**Why it arises:**
Two-truth literalism. Familiarity with Madhyamaka two-truths framework leads to reifying ultimate dharmatā-perception as accessing separate metaphysical realm.

**Primary consequence:**
Dualistic perception theory. The practitioner believes ultimate direct perception reveals "real reality" behind appearances.

**Secondary consequences:**
Appearance-denial; seeking "direct perception" beyond ordinary seeing; metaphysical speculation about what is "really" perceived.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-bifurcation> through two-reality model.
<fundamental-delusion> through missing that ultimate is how conventional is seen.

[4932-4941] <linguistic-confusion> [DHARMATĀ AS REFERENT]
**Misreading:**
The fourfold application of "dharmatā" (samsara/nirvana dharmatā, appearance/emptiness dharmatā, etc.) is interpreted as showing that dharmatā is the common essence or underlying nature of all these pairs.

**Why it arises:**
Essence-seeking. The word "dharmatā" suggests substantive nature. Application to diverse contexts implies common denominator.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying dharmatā as metaphysical essence. The practitioner believes dharmatā is "what all these really are" - a discoverable substrate.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ontological reductionism; "everything is dharmatā" as metaphysical claim; missing that dharmatā is how things are, not what they are.

**Cascade effects:**
<essence-grasping> through reifying dharmatā.
<view-attachment> through dharmatā-doctrine.

---

[4942-4953] <methodological-error> [YOGIC DIRECT AS ACHIEVED STATE]
**Misreading:**
The description of yogic direct perception meeting dharmatā through "particular correct awareness" is interpreted as describing an achieved mystical state resulting from practice, characterized by specific experiential qualities.

**Why it arises:**
State-achievement model. "Yogic" implies attained condition. Descriptive language invites experiential seeking.

**Primary consequence:**
Seeking yogic perception as experience. The practitioner tries to produce specific state matching description.

**Secondary consequences:**
Experience-mimicking; dullness or excitation mistaken for "yogic direct"; judgment of own perception as "not yet yogic."

**Cascade effects:**
<meditationism-error> through state-achievement.
<self-grasping> through identifying with perceiver.

---

[4954-4967] <numerological-obsession> [THREEFOLD STRUCTURE AS BLUEPRINT]
**Misreading:**
The elaborate threefold structure (base three, path three, measure three, fruit three) is interpreted as precise technical blueprint for practice, requiring exact correspondence between enumerated elements.

**Why it arises:**
Systematization compulsion. Enumeration suggests systematicity. Threefold structure throughout invites architectural approach to practice.

**Primary consequence:**
Making Thögal mechanics. The practitioner believes they must correctly align "three gates," "three key points," "three measures," etc., as technical requirements.

**Secondary consequences:**
Anxiety about "getting it right"; technical obsession; missing spontaneity through structure-compliance.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-fetishism> through systematic approach.
<progress-tracking> through measuring "threefold" completion.

---

[4960-4971] <visionary-fetishism> [KAYA APPEARANCE AS GOAL]
**Misreading:**
The description of three kayas appearing through self-resonance (Dharmakāya as inner experience, Sambhogakāya as outer lights, Nirmāṇakāya as liberated appearances) is interpreted as describing the goal experiences to be achieved through practice.

**Why it arises:**
Visionary attraction. Descriptions of lights and appearances trigger desire for such experiences. "See three kayas" becomes practice objective.

**Primary consequence:**
Seeking kaya-visions. The practitioner tries to produce specific visual experiences matching descriptions.

**Secondary consequences:**
Light-chasing; disappointment with "ordinary" vision; hallucination or imagination mistaken for genuine appearance.

**Cascade effects:**
<experience-substantialism> through vision-seeking.
<tantra-inflation> through treating Thögal as visionary technique.

**Page bleed awareness:** Heavy crossover with 02-20-01-01.txt (Trekchö/Thögal). Misreading here reinforces technique-obsession there.

[4972-4977] <temporal-confusion> [PROGRESSION AS STAGES]
**Misreading:**
The threefold temporal structure (ordinary time, guru instruction time, measure arrival time) is interpreted as developmental stages of practice, with "measure arrival" as advanced attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Temporal projection. Sequential description invites developmental reading. "First...second...third" suggests progression.

**Primary consequence:**
Chronologizing direct perception. The practitioner believes they evolve from ordinary to "measure arrival" perception.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring recognition to future stage; measuring progress by temporal markers; missing immediacy of dharmatā-perception.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through stage model.
<future-dependency> through deferring to "measure arrival."

---

[4978-4987] <literalism-error> [VISION DESCRIPTION AS ONTOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The technical descriptions of vision (light, light-house, awareness hanging-cord) are interpreted as precise ontological claims about the structure of perception or metaphysical composition of experience.

**Why it arises:**
Technical literalism. Specific terminology ("hanging-cord," "light-house") suggests anatomical or physical claims about how vision works.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying vision-structures. The practitioner believes there are literal "channels," "winds," and "lights" with physical existence.

**Secondary consequences:**
Physiological speculation; metaphysics of perception; confusing metaphor with anatomy.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through literalizing technical terms.
<scientism-error> through pseudo-physical claims.

---

[4988-4999] <teleological-error> [CERTAIN ARRIVAL AS DESTINATION]
**Misreading:**
The phrase "certain arrival at field realm" (gting ka la phebs pa) is interpreted as describing journey to a destination or attainment of a specific location/state called "field realm."

**Why it arises:**
Spatial metaphor literalism. Journey language suggests destination. "Certain arrival" implies completion of travel.

**Primary consequence:**
Making liberation spatial journey. The practitioner believes they are traveling toward "field realm" of buddhahood.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferred arrival ("not there yet"); spiritual materialism of "distance traveled"; goal-fixation.

**Cascade effects:**
<progress-tracking> through spatial journey model.
<fundamental-delusion> through not recognizing already-arrived.

---

[5000-5017] <practice-reduction> [GAZE AND TECHNIQUE AS CAUSAL]
**Misreading:**
The specific practices (three gazes, arrow not moving, placing eye in sky element) are interpreted as causal techniques that produce direct perception through correct execution.

**Why it arises:**
Cause-effect thinking. Technical instructions invite mechanistic interpretation. "Do X to get Y" is default reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Technique-obsession. The practitioner focuses on "getting the gazes right" believing this causes results.

**Secondary consequences:**
Physical strain from forced gazes; technique-perfectionism; missing that gazes are supports for recognition, not causes.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-fetishism> through causal interpretation.
<meditationism-error> through practice-to-result thinking.

---

[5018-5034] <somatic-obsession> [CHANNEL/WIND AS PHYSIOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The references to channels, winds, and the "five wisdoms abiding in nature" are interpreted as claims about subtle physiology requiring manipulation or activation through practice.

**Why it arises:**
Somatic literalism. "Channels" and "winds" suggest anatomical structures. Modern interest in "embodiment" supports somatic reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Making Thögal body-work. The practitioner tries to manipulate subtle physiology to produce results.

**Secondary consequences:**
Energy-work obsession; confusion when experiences don't match physiology; missing that channels/winds are metaphor for awareness patterns.

**Cascade effects:**
<embodiment-fetishism> through somatic reduction.
<scientism-error> through pseudo-physiological claims.
