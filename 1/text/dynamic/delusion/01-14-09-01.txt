[19657-19665] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The detailed characteristics of each lamp are interpreted as precise specifications that must be exactly replicated in experience. The practitioner fears that any deviation from these specifications indicates wrong practice.

**Why it arises:**
Technical detail triggers precision-anxiety. The practitioner believes that "authentic practice" requires matching experience to description. "Characteristic of distant water lamp" congeals as a standard against which they judge their meditation.

**Primary consequence:**
Spontaneous recognition is suffocated by specification-matching. The practitioner cannot rest in awareness because they are constantly checking: "Is this the right kind of clarity? Is this the correct pervasion?" The lamps' pointing function is replaced by conformity-anxiety.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner develops orthodoxies around "correct lamp-experience." Teachers who confirm specific experiences are valued; those who emphasize recognition are dismissed. A culture of "lamp-validation" emerges, replacing direct pointing.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] congeals into entrenched by PAGE 469-472's enumeration of actual deviations. Having worried about lamp-specificity, the practitioner now obsesses over deviation-specificity. By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by fear of practice-mistakes, unable to recognize that deviation from recognition is the only real deviation.

[19666-19674] [COLOPHON DISMISSAL] <epistemic-error>
**Misreading:**
The four lamps section is seen as "the main point" of Volume 1, leading the practitioner to rush through understanding it so they can "complete" the volume and move to Volume 2. The detailed exposition congeals into something to "get through."

**Why it arises:**
Future-orientation always seeks the next thing. The technical density of the four lamps produces resistance, triggering "just get it done" psychology. The practitioner wants the "credential" of Volume 1 completion.

**Primary consequence:**
The four lamps' profound pointing-out instructions are skimmed rather than absorbed. The practitioner knows ABOUT the four lamps without knowing the four lamps. Information substitutes for recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward a pattern of shallow engagement. Every teaching congeals into something to "complete" rather than something to realize. The colophon (PAGE 479) will be dismissed entirely as "just the ending."

**Cascade effects:**
[COMPLETION ANXIETY] ensures that PAGE 463-468's detailed exposition of the four lamps is never properly digested. The practitioner arrives at PAGE 469-472's deviations without foundation, misunderstands them, and by PAGE 479 has "completed" Volume 1 without having begun it. The dedication and seal are skipped, leaving the teaching ungrounded.

[19675-19683] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The four lamps are interpreted as describing four "higher states of consciousness" accessible only to advanced practitioners. The technical vocabulary is used to gatekeep Dzogchen, with claims like "You must realize the four lamps to be a real Dzogchen practitioner."

**Why it arises:**
Spiritual materialism seeks exclusivity markers. The sophisticated terminology signals "advanced teaching," triggering elitist appropriation. The practitioner wants to belong to the "four-lamp club."

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen solidifies as an esoteric experience-package. The practitioner believes that "having" the four lamp-experiences constitutes realization. The simple recognition of awareness is deemed "beginner-level" compared to these "advanced" lamps.

**Secondary consequences:**
Teachers who emphasize ordinary awareness are dismissed as "not teaching the profound four lamps." Teachers who detail lamp-experiences are sought after, regardless of their understanding. Authentic pointing-out is replaced by esoteric initiation.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's discussion of different practitioner capacities. The four-lamp hierarchy warps into the lens through which all capacity-distinctions are read. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed an entire spiritual identity around "four-lamp realization," having missed that the lamps were simply pointers to what was already present.


[19684-19695] <ontological-error> [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The detailed exposition of the lamp of pristine cognition (shes rab sgron ma) and thigle lamp is interpreted as a map of actual visual phenomena to be experienced in meditation. The practitioner believes these describe "things that appear" rather than ways of recognizing the nature of appearance.

**Why it arises:**
Visionary experience provides tangible evidence of "progress." The detailed descriptions of lights, colors, and forms trigger expectation-formation. The practitioner anticipates these visions as signs of realization rather than as natural expressions of awareness.

**Primary consequence:**
Meditation congeals into visionary pursuit. The practitioner cultivates techniques to "see" the five-colored lights and thigle formations described in the text. Recognition is replaced by vision-generation. The practitioner judges practice-success by visual intensity.

**Secondary consequences:**
Communities form around sharing and validating visions. "What did you see?" replaces "Did you recognize?" Teachers who can interpret visions gain authority. The simple recognition that these visions are self-appearance is lost in the excitement of experience.

**Cascade effects:**
[EXPERIENCE CHASING] peaks in PAGE 464-468 as each lamp's visionary aspect is detailed. The practitioner accumulates ever-more-elaborate experiences. By PAGE 469-472's deviations, they are confused because their vision-chasing hasn't produced liberation. The colophon (PAGE 479) finds them addicted to light-shows.

[19696-19707] <epistemic-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The metaphor of the vajra fortress (rdo rje'i mkhar) and the description of "indestructible vajra" are interpreted as establishing the substantial existence of a "Dzogchen palace" in the subtle body. The practitioner believes in a literal vajra-citadel to be inhabited.

**Why it arises:**
Architectural metaphors trigger spatial reification. "Fortress" suggests protection and permanence, appealing to the ego's desire for security. The practitioner unconsciously constructs a "vajra self" to inhabit this vajra space.

**Primary consequence:**
The pointing-out instruction congeals as a real estate claim. The practitioner believes they "have" a vajra-fortress in their heart center. This subtle grasping at a special "Dzogchen space" obscures the recognition that all space is equally pristine cognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner feels threatened when their "vajra fortress" is challenged. They defend "their" realization as "the vajra realization." Sectarian divisions emerge around who has the "real" vajra-fortress experience.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 464-468's spatial metaphors (mandala, palace, dimension). Each congeals as a "place" to find. By PAGE 476's comparison of deity yoga vs. dharmata, the practitioner cannot understand the difference because they have substantialized both. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "outside the fortress."

[19708-19719] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between "outer visions" and "inner realization" is interpreted as establishing two classes of practitioners: those who "just see lights" (beginners) and those who "realize the vajra fortress" (advanced). This produces a hierarchy of lamp-realization.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking assumes value-differences in experience. The text's technical sophistication signals "higher teaching," triggering elitist identification. The practitioner wants to be in the "realizes vajra fortress" category.

**Primary consequence:**
The equal nature of all appearances as self-radiance is lost. The practitioner believes some appearances (vajra fortress) are "more real" than others (ordinary vision). Grasping at "higher" experiences, they miss the recognition available in "lower" ones.

**Secondary consequences:**
Teachers who emphasize ordinary awareness are dismissed as "not teaching the vajra path." Teachers who promise vajra-fortress experiences attract followings. The practitioner congeals as a connoisseur of "high realization" claims.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] intensifies through PAGE 473-475 where capacity-types are discussed. The vajra-fortress warps into the mark of "superior capacity." By PAGE 476, the practitioner looks down on deity yoga practitioners as "not realizing the vajra fortress." The colophon (PAGE 479) is ignored as "for ordinary practitioners."

[19720-19731] <epistemic-error> [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The detailed specifications of the thigle lamp (round, red, clear) are interpreted as exact measurements that must be replicated precisely. The practitioner fears that seeing a blue thigle instead of red indicates deviation, or that irregular shape indicates wrong practice.

**Why it arises:**
Technical precision triggers conformity-anxiety. The practitioner believes authentic realization matches textual description exactly. Any deviation from specification congeals into evidence of error.

**Primary consequence:**
Natural self-expression is suffocated by specification-matching. The practitioner cannot recognize that thigle-description is pointing to a mode of recognition, not prescribing visual content. They miss the forest for one red round tree.

**Secondary consequences:**
Orthodoxies form around "correct thigle appearance." Teachers who validate specific colors and shapes gain authority. Spontaneous recognition is dismissed if it doesn't match the manual. Practice congeals into paint-by-numbers meditation.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] congeals into pathological by PAGE 469-472's enumeration of actual deviations. Having obsessed over thigle-color, the practitioner now obsesses over deviation-categories. By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by orthodox anxiety, unable to recognize that awareness has no color.

[19732-19743] [COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The elaborate visionary descriptions are seen as "the heart of the teaching" to be rushed through so the practitioner can claim "knowledge of the four lamps" and complete Volume 1. The poetry is skimmed for technical specifications.

**Why it arises:**
Poetic language triggers "get to the point" impatience. The practitioner wants extractable instructions, not evocative imagery. The approach to the volume's end accelerates "just finish it" psychology.

**Primary consequence:**
The profound pointing-out hidden in the poetry is missed. The practitioner extracts "techniques" from visionary descriptions without absorbing their recognition-pointing. They have information about lamps without the lamp of recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner develops a utilitarian approach to all teachings: "What do I DO with this?" The aesthetic dimension of Dharma, which opens the heart, is dismissed as "decoration." Practice congeals into dry technique.

**Cascade effects:**
[COMPLETION ANXIETY] ensures PAGE 464-468's completion of the four lamps is rushed. The practitioner arrives at PAGE 469-472's deviations without having recognized the lamps' pointing. By PAGE 479, they "complete" Volume 1 with a collection of techniques but no recognition. The colophon is skipped as "just poetry."


[19744-19750] <ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The description of the general object (spyi'i yul) as "outer space free of clouds, inner dharmata self-clear, in-between expanding display luminosity" is interpreted as literal map of three ontological zones or regions of reality that must be navigated sequentially.

**Why it arises:**
Tripartite structures trigger spatial mapping instincts. "Outer, inner, between" suggests dimensional geography. The practitioner assumes sophisticated teachings describe literal territories rather than modes of recognition.

**Primary consequence:**
The non-dual nature of the three domains solidifies as navigational model. The practitioner believes they must "enter" inner dharmata from outer space through the in-between gateway. Recognition congeals into spatial traversal rather than present nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation congeals into "traveling" from outer to inner. The practitioner seeks "arrival" at dharmata-location. Communities form around "outer practitioners" versus "inner realizers," creating new hierarchies based on claimed spatial positioning.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 465-468's detailed lamp-objects. Each congeals as a "location" to reach. By PAGE 476's deity yoga vs. dharmata comparison, the practitioner has constructed an elaborate geography of spiritual territories. The colophon (PAGE 479) is seen as "outside" this geography.

[19751-19758] <epistemic-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The specific objects (bye brag gi yul) of each lamp—distant water's empty form, wisdom's word-meaning, thigle's color-measurements—are interpreted as phenomenological catalog to be experienced in sequence.

**Why it arises:**
Catalog structure triggers collection-psychology. Detailed specifications suggest "advanced content" to master. The practitioner assumes enumerated experiences constitute higher practice.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is replaced by experience-cataloging. The practitioner judges practice-success by "which objects they've accessed." Those claiming more objects are deemed senior practitioners.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dzogchen congeals into museum of experiences. The practitioner compares collections: "I have three lamp-objects, you have four." Authentic pointing-out is replaced by phenomenological show-and-tell.

**Cascade effects:**
[EXPERIENCE CHASING] intensifies through PAGE 466-468's elaboration of objects. By PAGE 469-472's deviations, the practitioner is confused because their object-collection hasn't produced liberation. The similarity-mistaken pairs (PAGE 477-478) are reduced to "object-comparisons."

[19759-19766] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The instruction to "hold the gaze at the self-nature of the eye" (mig gi de bzhin nyid) is interpreted as precise anatomical directive requiring exact eye-position. The practitioner fears deviation from "correct" gaze-angle.

**Why it arises:**
Technical specificity triggers conformity-anxiety. "Self-nature of eye" suggests esoteric anatomy. The practitioner assumes precise instructions require precise execution.

**Primary consequence:**
Natural uncontrived recognition is suffocated by ocular orthodoxy. The practitioner strains to achieve "correct" gaze, creating tension and fixation. Recognition is replaced by eye-position-achievement.

**Secondary consequences:**
Teachers who specify eye-positions gain authority. The practitioner develops ophthalmological Buddhism, judging practice by gaze-criteria. Spontaneous recognition is dismissed as "incorrectly positioned."

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] congeals into pathological by PAGE 469-472's enumeration of actual deviations. Having worried about eye-position, the practitioner now worries about all nine deviations. By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by practice-paranoia.

[19767-19774] [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The "vajra coil" (rdo rje lu gu rgyud) description as "the eye's suchness reveals the nature of all dharmas" is interpreted as claiming that only practitioners who master eye-gazing can truly understand Dharma.

**Why it arises:**
Exclusivity markers trigger elitist identification. "Reveals all dharmas" suggests master-key. The practitioner wants to possess this key.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-available-through-any-gate nature is lost. The practitioner believes eye-gazing is "the" method. They look down on practitioners using other approaches as "not having the vajra coil."

**Secondary consequences:**
Lineages emphasizing eye-practices are deemed superior. The practitioner congeals into sectarian about gaze-techniques. Authentic recognition is dismissed if achieved without "proper" eye-training.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. The vajra-coil warps into the mark of "superior capacity." By PAGE 476, the practitioner cannot understand deity yoga because it lacks this "essential" technique.

[19775-19782] [COLOPHON DISMISSAL] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The detailed object-descriptions are seen as "content to cover" so the practitioner can "finish" the four lamps section. Technical detail produces resistance, triggering "just get through it" mentality.

**Why it arises:**
Density of information triggers overwhelm. Detailed specifications suggest "advanced material" to complete. The practitioner wants Volume 1 credential.

**Primary consequence:**
The profound pointing-out in object-descriptions is missed. The practitioner skims for "the point" without absorbing recognition-contexts. Information substitutes for realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward shallow-engagement pattern. Every detailed teaching congeals into obstacle to overcome. The colophon (PAGE 479) will be dismissed as "just wrapping up."

**Cascade effects:**
[COMPLETION ANXIETY] ensures PAGE 465-468's completion of lamp-objects is rushed. Arriving at PAGE 469-472's deviations without foundation, the practitioner misunderstands them as more "content to cover." By PAGE 479, Volume 1 is "finished" without recognition.


[19783-19792] <ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The description of thigle objects as "five colors, six, three, two, six" and "six wisdom essences" with "warm, cool, moving" qualities is interpreted as literal phenomenological checklist to be completed.

**Why it arises:**
Numerical lists trigger achievement-mentality. Sensory specifications suggest "experiential content" to access. The practitioner assumes enumerated qualities constitute practice-validation.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is replaced by quality-counting. The practitioner judges practice by "how many colors" or "which temperatures." The pointing function of appearance-description solidifies as phenomenological inventory.

**Secondary consequences:**
Communities form around sharing "color-counts." Teachers who validate specific qualities gain authority. The practitioner develops sensory-materialism, believing warmth validates realization.

**Cascade effects:**
[EXPERIENCE CHASING] peaks in PAGE 466-468 as lamp-summary approaches. By PAGE 469-472's deviations, the practitioner is confused because their quality-collection hasn't produced liberation. The colophon (PAGE 479) finds them addicted to sensation-cataloging.

[19793-19802] [PRACTITIONER ELITISM] [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between objects of different lamps is interpreted as hierarchy of "object-purity," with thigle-objects being "higher" than distant-water-objects.

**Why it arises:**
Comparative structure triggers value-ranking. Technical sophistication suggests "advanced" content. The practitioner wants "highest" objects.

**Primary consequence:**
The equal nature of all objects as recognition-contexts is lost. The practitioner chases "superior" objects while dismissing "ordinary" appearances. Grasping at object-hierarchy prevents recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Object-snobbery emerges. Practitioners of "lower" objects are deemed beginners. The authentic recognition that all objects are self-display is missed in object-discrimination.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Object-mastery congeals into capacity-indicator. By PAGE 476, the practitioner looks down on deity yoga's "mental constructs" compared to dzogchen's "direct objects."

[19803-19812] <epistemic-error> [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The "space lamp object" description as "emptiness, clarity, unobstructed expression, pervading vastness" is interpreted as four qualities that must all be present simultaneously for "correct" practice.

**Why it arises:**
Conjunctive language triggers checklist-psychology. "And" suggests requirements. The practitioner assumes all descriptors must be matched.

**Primary consequence:**
Natural recognition is suffocated by quality-matching. The practitioner worries: "Am I clear enough? Empty enough? Vast enough?" The pointing function solidifies as adequacy-anxiety.

**Secondary consequences:**
Orthodoxies form around "correct" quality-combinations. Teachers who specify exact proportions gain authority. Spontaneous recognition is dismissed if "qualities don't align."

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] congeals into entrenched by PAGE 469-472's enumeration of actual deviations. Having worried about quality-matching, the practitioner now obsesses over deviation-avoidance. By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by orthodox anxiety.

[19813-19822] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The completion of lamp-object descriptions is seen as "finishing the four lamps section" so one can move to "the next topic." The approach to volume-end accelerates dismissive reading.

**Why it arises:**
Section-completion triggers "next section" anticipation. Dense technical content produces resistance. The practitioner wants to "get through" Volume 1.

**Primary consequence:**
The integration of all four lamps' pointing is missed. The practitioner has collected lamp-information without lamp-recognition. They "know about" four lamps without knowing four lamps.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward fragmented-engagement pattern. Each teaching congeals into isolated "topic" to complete. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "just conclusion."

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 466-468's lamp-summary is not absorbed. Arriving at PAGE 469-472's deviations without integrated understanding, the practitioner misreads them. By PAGE 479, Volume 1 is "completed" without completion.

[19823-19832] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The "space lamp" as "vast like the sky, clear like crystal" is interpreted as establishing spatial metaphors as actual metaphysical claims about awareness-size and awareness-clarity.

**Why it arises:**
Spatial metaphors trigger literal size-associations. "Vast" suggests magnitude. The practitioner assumes metaphorical magnitude indicates ontological magnitude.

**Primary consequence:**
The pedagogical function of spatial description is lost. The practitioner believes awareness literally "is" vast like sky. Recognition is replaced by magnitude-imagination.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Vast awareness" congeals into object of meditation. Practitioners compare "sizes" of awareness-experiences. The authentic recognition that size-concepts don't apply is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Spatial metaphors there are also substantialized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed an elaborate "metaphysics of vastness" around dzogchen.


[19833-19841] <ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The description of lamp-supports (sgron ma'i rten) as "causing samsara-nirvana seeds to expand" is interpreted as literal energetic mechanics—supports actually "work" to produce realization.

**Why it arises:**
Instrumental reasoning assumes causality. "Support" suggests functional mechanism. The practitioner assumes described supports are causal instruments.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-context nature of supports is lost. The practitioner believes "correct" supports cause realization. Support-gathering replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Materialism of supports emerges. Specific gazing-postures, breathing-patterns, or cushions are deemed "necessary." The practitioner judges practice by support-proximity.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 467-468's support elaborations. Each support congeals into another "thing to have." By PAGE 476, deity yoga's supports are compared unfavorably to dzogchen's "superior" supports.

[19842-19850] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between supports of different lamps is interpreted as hierarchy of "support-efficacy," with wisdom-lamp supports being "more powerful" than distant-water supports.

**Why it arises:**
Comparative language triggers value-ranking. Differentiation suggests superiority. The practitioner wants "best" supports.

**Primary consequence:**
The equal availability of recognition through any support is lost. The practitioner chases "superior" supports while neglecting present conditions. Grasping at support-hierarchy prevents recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Support-snobbery emerges. "I use wisdom-lamp supports" congeals into status-marker. The authentic recognition that supports are merely conditions is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Support-mastery congeals into capacity-indicator. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having superior supports."

[19851-19859] <epistemic-error> [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The "threefold gathering of function" (gsum gyi byed 'dus) is interpreted as three requirements that must all be assembled for "correct" practice.

**Why it arises:**
Enumerative language triggers checklist-psychology. "Three" suggests necessities. The practitioner assumes all must be present.

**Primary consequence:**
Natural recognition is suffocated by requirement-assembly. The practitioner worries: "Do I have all three? Is my gathering complete?" The pointing function solidifies as adequacy-anxiety.

**Secondary consequences:**
Orthodoxies form around "correct" threefold-assembly. Teachers who verify completeness gain authority. Spontaneous recognition is dismissed if "functions aren't gathered."

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] congeals into entrenched by PAGE 469-472's enumeration of nine deviations. Having worried about threefold-gathering, the practitioner now obsesses over ninefold-avoidance. By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by complexity.

[19860-19868] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The completion of four-lamp exposition is seen as "finishing the main teaching" of Volume 1. What follows (deviations, practitioner types, colophon) is seen as "supplementary material" to skim.

**Why it arises:**
Pedagogical structure suggests "main point" versus "addenda." Dense technical content produces fatigue. The practitioner wants to "get to the end."

**Primary consequence:**
The integration-function of latter sections is missed. The practitioner has "lamp-knowledge" without deviation-awareness, practitioner-humility, or dedication-merit.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward dismissive pattern. "Main teachings" are studied; "concluding sections" are ignored. The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed entirely.

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 469-472's deviations are not taken seriously. Arriving at PAGE 479 without deviation-awareness, the practitioner misses the dedication's importance. Volume 1 is "finished" without foundation.

[19869-19877] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The "vajra essence" (rdo rje snying po) and "indestructible" descriptions are interpreted as establishing dzogchen as "superior substance" compared to other paths.

**Why it arises:**
Substantial language triggers essence-thinking. "Vajra" suggests indestructible essence. The practitioner wants this superior essence.

**Primary consequence:**
The emptiness-of-all-essences teaching is lost. The practitioner believes dzogchen "has" vajra-essence. Recognition is replaced by essence-possession.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Vajra practitioner" congeals into identity. Other paths are deemed "non-vajra" and inferior. The authentic recognition that all paths are essenceless is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Substantial differences are emphasized over functional similarities. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed an "essence-identity" around dzogchen.


[19878-19886] <ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The thigle abiding-description as "vast as space, small as horse-hoof divided ten times, clear as sun-moon mandala" is interpreted as literal dimensional claims about actually-existing internal structures.

**Why it arises:**
Dimensional language triggers spatial literalism. Measurement-suggestions imply objective scale. The practitioner assumes precise descriptions indicate precise entities.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphorical function of dimension-description is lost. Thigle congeals into object with size. The practitioner literalizes all measurements, believing "correct" size validates practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Size-orthodoxies emerge. "My thigle was vast as space" congeals into achievement-claim. Teachers who specify dimensions gain authority. Spontaneous recognition is dismissed if "wrong-sized."

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 477-478's similarity-mistaken pairs. Dimensional differences are exaggerated. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed "thigle-ontology" with precise specifications.

[19887-19896] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The description of thigle characteristics is interpreted as establishing "thigle-realization" as advanced attainment accessible only to superior practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
Technical sophistication suggests esoteric content. Complex descriptions signal "higher teaching." The practitioner wants advanced status.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-available-to-all nature is lost. Thigle congeals into elite attainment. The practitioner believes ordinary awareness is insufficient; thigle-awareness is required.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Thigle practitioner" congeals into exclusive identity. Non-thigle practitioners are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that thigle-points-to-ordinary-awareness is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Thigle-mastery congeals into capacity-indicator. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having thigle-realization."

[19897-19906] <epistemic-error> [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The "indestructible vajra" and "unborn in vajra fortress" descriptions are interpreted as ontological claims about permanent, solid existence of dzogchen-awareness.

**Why it arises:**
Permanent-language triggers eternalism. "Indestructible" suggests permanence. The practitioner wants permanent ground.

**Primary consequence:**
The emptiness-of-all-phenomena teaching is lost. The practitioner believes dzogchen-awareness is permanent substance. Eternalism replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Permanent awareness" congeals into object of grasping. Change is seen as threat to "vajra nature." The authentic recognition that awareness is neither permanent nor impermanent is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] congeals into entrenched by PAGE 469-472's deviations. Having substantialized vajra-nature, the practitioner fears deviation as "destruction of vajra." By PAGE 479, they are paralyzed by permanence-anxiety.

[19907-19916] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The four-lamp summary section is seen as "wrapping up technical content" before "practical application" sections (yoga, deviations). The poetry is skimmed for "practical instructions."

**Why it arises:**
Poetic density triggers impatience. Technical completion suggests "moving to application." The practitioner wants "doable" content.

**Primary consequence:**
The integration-function of summary-poetry is missed. The practitioner has lamp-knowledge without lamp-recognition. Information substitutes for realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward utilitarian approach. Poetry is dismissed as "ornament." The colophon (PAGE 479) is approached as "mere dedication."

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 469-470's continuous yoga is not contextualized within four-lamp understanding. The deviations (PAGE 471-472) are read mechanically. By PAGE 479, the volume lacks integration.

[19917-19926] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The "channel-palaces" (rtsa'i gzhal yas) and "wisdom-abodes" descriptions are interpreted as literal architectural claims about internal anatomy.

**Why it arises:**
Architectural metaphors trigger spatial literalism. "Palace" suggests structure. The practitioner assumes descriptions indicate geography.

**Primary consequence:**
The pedagogical function of palace-metaphor is lost. Internal geography congeals into object of study. The practitioner literalizes all spatial language, creating subtle-body cartography.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Channel-palace practitioner" congeals into cartographer-identity. Maps of internal palaces proliferate. The authentic recognition that all space is equally awareness is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 476's deity yoga comparison. Palaces there are also substantialized. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed elaborate "palace-ontology."


[19927-19935] <ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The "four yogas of view, meditation, conduct, fruition" (lta sgom spyod 'bras) are interpreted as four actual practices to be trained sequentially, rather than four aspects of continuous recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Enumerative language triggers curriculum-thinking. "Yoga" suggests practice-regimen. The practitioner assumes numbered descriptions indicate stages.

**Primary consequence:**
The spontaneous-already nature of four-yoga is lost. The practitioner believes they must build four-yoga through effort. Recognition is replaced by stage-accumulation.

**Secondary consequences:**
"View-yoga" congeals into preliminary. "Fruition-yoga" congeals into advanced. The practitioner evaluates progress by "which yoga they're in."

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 469-470's continuous yoga. Yoga-stages are reified. By PAGE 471-472's deviations, the practitioner is confused because stage-progression hasn't produced liberation.

[19936-19944] <ontological-error> [COMPLETION ANXIETY]
**Misreading:**
The description of four-yoga as "taken by view, meditation, conduct, fruition" is interpreted as establishing four-yoga mastery as advanced attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Comprehensive language suggests mastery-content. "Four" implies completeness. The practitioner wants complete attainment.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-available-without-four-yoga-training nature is lost. Four-yoga congeals into elite curriculum. The practitioner believes ordinary recognition is insufficient.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Four-yoga practitioner" congeals into advanced identity. Those not practicing all four are deemed beginners. The authentic recognition that four-yoga describes already-present nature is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[PRACTITIONER ELITISM] poisons PAGE 473-475's capacity distinctions. Four-yoga mastery congeals into capacity-indicator. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has identified with "having four-yoga."

[19945-19953] <epistemic-error> [METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The "awareness and display as two" (rig pa dang snang ba gnyis) is interpreted as ontological claim about actually-distinct entities that must be "unified."

**Why it arises:**
Dualistic language triggers separation-assumption. "Two" implies duality. The practitioner assumes description indicates problem.

**Primary consequence:**
The non-dual identity of awareness-display is obscured by perceived need for "unification." The practitioner seeks to "join" what was never separate.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Unification practices" proliferate. Teachers promising "merging techniques" gain followings. The authentic recognition that awareness-display have always been non-dual is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] congeals into entrenched by PAGE 471-472's deviations. Having created artificial duality-problem, the practitioner fears deviation as "failure to unify." By PAGE 479, they are exhausted by unification-efforts.

[19954-19962] [COMPLETION ANXIETY] [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The four-yoga completion is seen as "finishing the lamp section" and "moving to yoga application." The transition triggers "next section" anticipation.

**Why it arises:**
Sectional structure suggests progression. Technical completion produces momentum. The practitioner wants to "advance."

**Primary consequence:**
The integration of four-yoga with lamp-recognition is missed. The practitioner has "completed" lamps without absorption. Information substitutes for transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
The practitioner carries forward fragmented engagement. Each section congeals into separate "achievement." The colophon (PAGE 479) is dismissed as "final section."

**Cascade effects:**
[COLOPHON DISMISSAL] ensures PAGE 469-470's continuous yoga lacks foundation. The deviations (PAGE 471-472) are read without yoga-context. By PAGE 479, the volume is "completed" in sections but not integrated.

[19963-19972] <ontological-error> [PRACTITIONER ELITISM]
**Misreading:**
The " Dzogchen Great Secret" (rdzogs chen gsang sngags che) and "Natural Great Perfection" are interpreted as brand-names of superior tradition.

**Why it arises:**
Proper names trigger identity-association. "Great" suggests superiority. The practitioner wants superior brand.

**Primary consequence:**
The essencelessness-of-all-traditions teaching is lost. Dzogchen congeals into identity-brand. Recognition is replaced by brand-loyalty.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Dzogchen practitioner" congeals into exclusive identity. Other traditions are deemed inferior. The authentic recognition that all paths lead to same nature is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[METAPHOR SUBSTANTIALISM] spreads to PAGE 476's deity yoga comparison. Brand-comparison replaces recognition-comparison. By PAGE 479, the practitioner has constructed "dzogchen-superiority" identity.


[19973-19974] <ontological-error> [EXPERIENCE CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The "threefold continuous yoga" (rgyun gyi rnal 'byor gsum) and its nine deviations (gol sa) are interpreted as precise curriculum where deviations are actual errors to be vigilantly avoided.

**Why it arises:**
Enumerative structure triggers anxiety-formation. "Deviation" suggests wrong-path. The practitioner assumes listed errors are real dangers.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition-already-complete nature is obscured by deviation-paranoia. The practitioner believes they must navigate around nine specific errors. Recognition is replaced by error-avoidance.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deviation-monitoring consumes attention. "Am I falling into formless absorption?" congeals into constant worry. The authentic recognition that deviations are simply non-recognition is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
[DEVIATION CONFUSION] intensifies through PAGE 470-472's deviation elaboration. Each deviation congeals into new fear. By PAGE 479, the practitioner is paralyzed by deviation-avoidance.
