[1463-1550] [MORAL PROGRESSION ADDICTION] [VIRTUE CALCULATION]
**Misreading:**
The lifespan extension through abandoning the ten non-virtues—20 years for abandoning killing, increasing to 80,000 years for abandoning wrong dharma practice—interpreted as literal moral accounting system where virtue equals longevity—like cosmic retirement benefits.

**Why it arises:**
Specific numbers reward specific behaviors. The arithmetic progression feels fair and systematic. "Abandon and gain" suggests controllable causality.

**Primary consequence:**
Morality becomes transaction. Spiritual practice is reduced to lifespan-extension technology. Recognition is obscured by virtue-calculations.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners track their "years gained." Ethics becomes investment strategy. Present recognition is sacrificed for future rewards.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [VIRTUE ACCOUNTING] (counting merit-points), [MORAL MATERIALISM] (goodness as currency), [LONGEVITY OBSESSION] (wanting to live long), [ABANDONMENT CALCULATION] (what to give up for gain), and [PROGRESSION FETISHISM] (climbing the ladder).

[1496-1530] [WORLD DESTRUCTION ANXIETY] [APOCALYPTIC FEAR]
**Misreading:**
The elaborate description of world destruction—seven suns burning everything, seven floods dissolving to salt water, wind scattering all—interpreted as literal future cataclysm to fear and prepare for—like cosmic climate change.

**Why it arises:**
Seven suns sounds plausible as heat-death. The sequential drying (rivers, lakes, oceans, mountains) follows physical logic. "Seven times burned to ash" suggests repeatable disaster.

**Primary consequence:**
Impermanence is temporalized as future catastrophe. Practice is motivated by apocalypse-avoidance. Recognition is obscured by disaster-anxiety.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners obsess over destruction-timelines. Dharma becomes survival-preparation. Present recognition is displaced by end-times worry.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [APOCALYPSE OBSESSION] (watching for signs), [DESTRUCTION FEAR] (cosmic anxiety), [SURVIVAL SPIRITUALITY] (practice as preparation), [FIRE FASCINATION] (seven suns fixation), and [DISSOLUTION DREAD] (water terror).

[1531-1571] [KALPA CALCULATION FETISHISM] [TEMPORAL MATHEMATICS]
**Misreading:**
The detailed kalpa mathematics—180 + 180 = one aeon of duration, 60 + 60 = intermediate kalpa, etc.—interpreted as essential cosmological knowledge to master—like Buddhist astrophysics.

**Why it arises:**
Numbers feel precise and authoritative. The symmetrical calculations (60, 180) suggest cosmic order. "Great kalpa" (*bskal pa chen po*) sounds like technical terminology.

**Primary consequence:**
Time is mathematized as cosmological structure. Recognition is confused with understanding temporal cycles. Practice becomes calculation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners memorize kalpa-systems. Dharma study focuses on chronology. Present awareness is displaced by temporal abstractions.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [KALPA OBSESSION] (studying time-systems), [MATHEMATICAL SPIRITUALITY] (numbers as truth), [DURATION FASCINATION] (how long), [CYCLING DETERMINISM] (trapped in loops), and [COSMOLOGICAL INTELLECTUALISM] (knowledge as realization).
