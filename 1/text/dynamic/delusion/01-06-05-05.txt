<ontological-error> [MIND/WISDOM NON-DUALITY AS UNITY]
**Misreading:**
The phrase "mind and wisdom neither open nor close anywhere" is interpreted as establishing that mind and wisdom are ultimately the same thing or merge into unity.

**Why it arises:**
Unity fetishism. "Neither open nor close" suggests sameness. Non-duality interpreted as identity rather than inseparability.

**Primary consequence:**
Conflating mind/wisdom. The practitioner believes ordinary mind "is" wisdom, leading to complacency about confusion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual bypassing; "my confusion is wisdom" excuse; missing that non-duality means wisdom is mind's nature, not identity.

**Cascade effects:**
<fundamental-delusion> through conflating confusion/liberation.
<spiritual-complacency> through unity-misinterpretation.
