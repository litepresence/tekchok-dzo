[8672-8678] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [ACHIEVEMENT FETISHISM]
**Misreading:**
The description of "approach" bringing supreme, medium, and lesser siddhis is interpreted as a promise of guaranteed worldly attainments (wealth, power, influence) proportionate to practice effort.

**Why it arises:**
Commodity-exchange frameworks project onto spiritual practice. The transactional language ("contact brings accomplishment") suggests investment-return mechanics. Desires for worldly success are spiritualized.

**Primary consequence:**
The siddhis are misunderstood as worldly powers rather than signs of realization. Practice becomes investment strategy for spiritual ROI. Recognition is abandoned for acquisition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Disappointment when worldly results don't manifest leads to abandonment of practice or frantic technique-switching. Comparison and competition around "attainments" poison communities. The supreme siddhi (recognition) is sacrificed for lesser gains.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <experience substantialism>. Subsequent descriptions of signs and indications are treated as promises to be collected rather than pointers to recognize.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page contains mantra and ritual substance instructions. Preceding page (201) established consort classification errors that carry forward—practitioners will combine consort-objectification with ritual-mechanism in dangerous ways. Following pages (203+) discuss subtle body practices that will be misunderstood through lens of substance-fetishism.

[8679-8679] <practice-error> [POSTURE FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
The physical posture instructions (lion's leap, joints bent, chest hollowed) are interpreted as literal gymnastic requirements that mechanically produce realization when held correctly, like asanas in hatha yoga.

**Why it arises:**
Physicalist frameworks assume form determines consciousness. The detailed anatomical instructions suggest biomechanical causation. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports posture-obsession.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that posture supports but does not cause recognition is entirely lost. Practitioners injure themselves forcing positions while neglecting the view that makes posture meaningful.

**Secondary consequences:**
Flexibility competition replaces wisdom inquiry. Those with physical limitations believe themselves excluded from realization. The energetic dimensions of posture are reduced to muscular mechanics.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <progress tracking>. Subsequent pages on channel practices will be approached as physical manipulations rather than energetic recognitions.
