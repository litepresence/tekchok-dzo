[15769-15773] [LIGHT CHASING] [BINDU MATERIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The thigle meditation produces light experiences and bindu movements that practitioners should seek to intensify and stabilize—resting in thigle means dwelling in luminous phenomena, and familiarization extends light duration.

**Why it arises:**
The thigle terminology suggests light-phenomena. Practitioners habitually interpret "resting in bindu" as luminous experience to pursue.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen congeals into light-dwelling practice. The practitioner focuses on generating, extending, and intensifying thigle-luminosity, treating light experiences as meditation object.

**Secondary consequences:**
Materialism of luminosity reaches peak. The practitioner grasps at thigle-light as precious substance to possess, day-and-night familiarization congeals into light-hoarding, and the "path" is now accumulation of luminous experience rather than recognition of nature beyond all phenomena.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
This error generates [LUMINOSITY DWELLING] staying in light, [THIGLE-LIGHT POSSESSION] holding experience, and [DAY-NIGHT ACCUMULATION] hoarding moments. The error produces grasping.

[15774-15777] <pedagogical-error> [EFFORTLESS APPROPRIATION]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between effortful (rtsol bcas) and effortless (rtsol med) systems is a hierarchical progression from lower to higher.

**Why it arises:**
Natural assumption that "effortless" is superior. Common marketing of "direct path" over gradual methods.

**Primary consequence:**
Premature abandonment of effortful preliminary practices.

**Secondary consequences:**
Lack of foundation for recognizing effortless state.

**Cascade effects:**
<error> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<pedagogical-error> → premature-bypass → foundation-weakness → recognition-failure
