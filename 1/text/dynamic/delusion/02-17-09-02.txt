<dus-bzhi-mnyam-sbyor-temporal-fixation> <four-time-equipoise-schedule-obsession>

**Misreading:**
The "four times equipoise" (*dus bzhi mnyam sbyor*) interpreted as rigid schedule to follow (morning, noon, evening, night), creating temporal practice obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Four times" suggests daily schedule. "Equipoise" implies balanced practice. Discipline culture: regular hours = good practice. The practitioner schedules sessions.

**Primary consequence:**
Schedule-obsession: treating four times as mandatory timetable. Natural recognition is obscured by clock-watching.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I missed the noon session"
- The blind spot: that equipoise is timeless
- Time-based guilt over recognition

**Primary consequence:**
Level-hierarchy: treating four as rungs to climb. Natural recognition is obscured by stage-obsession.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm at the secret level, not yet ultimate"
- Overlooking that all levels are single recognition
- Spiritual materialism about "advanced" status

**Cascade effects:**
<phyi-nang-gsang-de-kho-na-nyid-hierarchy> leads to <level-hierarchy> [stage climbing] generates <status-materialism> [advanced claim] leads to <single-recognition-miss> [hierarchy over unity]

<rtsa-rlung-srol-gzung-channel-wind-control> <channel-wind-system-manipulation>

**Misreading:**
The instruction to "hold channels and winds as pathway" (*rtsa rlung srol du gzung ba*) interpreted as specific energetic technique to master, creating energy-control project.

**Why it arises:**
"Hold" suggests technique. "Channels/winds" implies energy system. Kundalini traditions manipulate energies. The practitioner controls *rtsa rlung*.

**Primary consequence:**
Energy-control: treating channels/winds as objects to manipulate. Natural flow is obscured by intervention.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to hold my winds correctly"
- Energy-imbalance from forced control
- Not seeing that flow is natural, not held

**Cascade effects:**
<rtsa-rlung-srol-gzung-channel-wind-control> creates <ground-ignored>

**Why it arises:**
"Cutting" suggests elimination. "Ornaments" implies decoration. Renunciation-mentality: less = more. The practitioner stops speaking.

**Primary consequence:**
Silence-extremism: treating speech-cutting as total muteness. Natural expression is obscured by prohibition.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Inability to communicate functionally
- "I'm beyond words" as spiritual bypass
- Overlooking that cutting indicates non-attachment, not prohibition

**Cascade effects:**
<ngag-gi-brjod-pa-chopping> creates <silence-extremism> [total muteness] → <communication-breakdown> [functional impairment] → <non-attachment-miss> [prohibition over freedom]

<sems-ma-bcos-natural-mind-romanticism> <unfabricated-mind-affectation>

**Misreading:**
The "unfabricated mind" (*sems ma bcos*) interpreted as permission for ordinary distraction, creating "naturalness" affectation.

**Why it arises:**
"Unfabricated" suggests authenticity. "Natural" implies ordinary. Anti-effort romanticism: do nothing = Dzogchen. The practitioner performs naturalness.

**Primary consequence:**
Naturalness-affectation: treating ordinary mind as unfabricated. Natural recognition is obscured by effortful authenticity.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm just being natural" as excuse
- Not seeing that unfabricated is recognition, not ordinariness
- Distraction renamed as practice

**Why it arises:**
"Lion posture" suggests form. "Sleeping" implies position. Posture traditions value specific forms. The practitioner copies lion.

**Primary consequence:**
Posture-fetish: treating lion-form as requirement. Natural recognition is obscured by physical imitation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I must sleep like a lion"
- Physical discomfort from forced posture
- What's missed: that posture indicates confidence, not form

**Primary consequence:**
Heart-fixation: treating heart as meditation object. Natural awareness is obscured by anatomical focus.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I can't see the lights in my heart"
- Missing that heart indicates core recognition
- Anatomical literalism over awareness

**Cascade effects:**
<snying-nang-od-lnga-heart-five-lights-visualization> generates <heart-fixation> [center obsession] → <anatomical-literalism> [seeing in heart] → <core-recognition-miss> [location over nature]

**Primary consequence:**
Tantric-dependence: seeking validation from source. Direct experience is replaced by scriptural appeal.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Thalgyur proves this is correct"
- Missing that citation points to experience
- Textual authority over direct seeing
