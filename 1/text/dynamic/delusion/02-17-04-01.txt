[2064-2120] <conduct-hierarchy> <vehicle-stratification>

**Misreading:**
The three types of conduct (sutra non-clinging, tantra without-acceptance-rejection, Dzogchen non-attachment) represent hierarchical progression—sutra conduct is beginner-level, tantra is intermediate, Dzogchen is advanced. One must graduate from lower to higher conduct.

**Why it arises:**
The threefold structure suggests stages. Buddhist traditions often present progressive paths (sutra → tantra → Dzogchen). The criticism of first two types implies superiority of third.

**Primary consequence:**
The distinction becomes achievement hierarchy. Practitioners attempt to "reach" Dzogchen conduct, believing they must master lower forms first. The teaching that Dzogchen conduct is spontaneous expression becomes goal to attain.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing one must "complete" sutra conduct before tantra
- Looking down on sutra practitioners as "lower"
- Attempting to "do" Dzogchen conduct before recognition
- Missing that the difference is recognition, not conduct-level

**Cascade effects:**
<conduct-hierarchy> → <graduated-practice> (working through levels) → <elitism> (Dzogchen superiority) → <recognition-prevention-error> (seeking advanced conduct).

[2100-2145] <behavioral-mimicry> <animal-conduct-literalism>

**Misreading:**
The twenty-one animal conduct similes (bee-like, deer-like, mute-like, peacock-like, madman-like, lion-like, dog-pig-like, owl-like, child-like, elephant-like, etc.) describe actual behavioral prescriptions—practitioners should literally imitate these animals' behaviors.

**Why it arises:**
The similes suggest emulation. "Madman conduct" is famous in Tibetan Buddhism. The specificity ("charnel-ground go," "abandon fear mind") sounds like instructions. Animal yoga is known in other traditions.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct becomes behavioral imitation. Practitioners attempt to "act like a madman" or "be like a lion," creating affectation. The teaching that these are metaphors for spontaneous naturalness becomes role-playing.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Deliberately trying to "be spontaneous like a child"
- Affected madness or unpredictability as "practice"
- Missing that the similes point to natural qualities, not behaviors
- Creating new persona: "Dzogchen practitioner who acts like..."

**Cascade effects:**
<behavioral-mimicry> → <affected-conduct> (pretending to be natural) → <identity-formation> (adopting yogi persona) → <recognition-prevention-error> (role substitutes for authenticity).

[2146-2200] <performance-obsession> <vajra-song-ritual>

**Misreading:**
The vajra song (rdo rje'i glu) and dance instructions describe actual performances—specific times, methods, and benefits of singing and dancing as ritual practices that produce spiritual results.

**Why it arises:**
"Song and dance" suggests performance. Tibetan Buddhism has elaborate ritual music/dance. The benefits listed ("companion to non-conceptual meditation," "goes before all conduct") imply efficacy.

**Primary consequence:**
Vajra song becomes ritual performance. Practitioners attempt to "do" the songs and dances at prescribed times, believing this constitutes practice. The teaching that song/dance are spontaneous expression of recognition becomes ceremonial obligation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Learning ritual songs and dances as "Dzogchen practice"
- Believing performance at specific times is necessary
- Missing that song/dance are natural outpouring, not ritual
- Creating performance anxiety about "doing it right"

**Cascade effects:**
<performance-obsession> → <ritual-obligation> (performing songs/dances) → <effortful-spontaneity> (trying to be natural) → <recognition-prevention-error> (ceremony substitutes for recognition).

---

[2201-2250] <temporal-ritualism> <five-times-obligation>

**Misreading:**
The five times for secret conduct (distinguishing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, feast gathering, empowerment, maṇḍala accomplishment, meditation enhancement) create a ritual calendar—practitioners must perform conduct at these specific times.

**Why it arises:**
"Five times" suggests schedule. Vajrayāna has elaborate ritual calendars. The specificity ("feast time," "empowerment time") implies temporal requirements.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct becomes time-bound obligation. Practitioners believe they must "do" secret conduct at specific times, creating ritual schedule. The teaching that conduct is timeless natural expression becomes temporal performance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Creating conduct-calendar: "today is feast time, must do..."
- Believing conduct is only appropriate at certain times
- Missing that spontaneous conduct is timeless
- Time-anxiety about "missing" right moment

**Cascade effects:**
<temporal-ritualism> → <schedule-obsession> (conduct calendar) → <performance-timing> (waiting for right time) → <recognition-prevention-error> (timing substitutes for timelessness).

---

[2251-2300] <secrecy-fetish> <hidden-practice-exclusivity>

**Misreading:**
The emphasis on "secret conduct" (gsang spyod) and "not seen by ordinary people" means these practices are esoteric, advanced, and hidden from beginners—requiring special initiation, qualification, or secrecy.

**Why it arises:**
"Secret" suggests esotericism. Vajrayāna has secret teachings (guhyamantra). The phrase "not seen by ordinary" implies exclusivity. Special advanced practices appeal to spiritual ambition.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct becomes secret club. Practitioners believe they need special permission or qualification, creating hierarchy of "those who know" vs. "ordinary people." The teaching that conduct is natural becomes esoteric mystique.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing one needs initiation for secret conduct
- Creating exclusivity around "advanced" practices
- Spiritual pride in "knowing the secrets"
- Missing that "secret" means spontaneously hidden, not deliberately concealed

**Cascade effects:**
<secrecy-fetish> → <esoteric-elitism> (special knowledge) → <initiation-dependence> (waiting for permission) → <recognition-prevention-error> (exclusivity substitutes for universality).

[2301-2350] <literal-madness> <crazy-wisdom-fetish>

**Misreading:**
The "madman-like conduct" and other transgressive behaviors (dog-pig-like, eating others' food, roaming charnel grounds) license actual antisocial, unethical, or insane behavior in the name of Dzogchen—"crazy wisdom" justifies anything.

**Why it arises:**
"Madman conduct" (smyon pa) is famous in Tibetan Buddhism. Transgressive behavior appears in siddha stories. "Beyond good and evil" suggests amorality. The descriptions sound like permission for outrageous acts.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes license for unethical behavior. Practitioners claim "crazy wisdom" to justify selfishness, harm, or mental instability. The teaching that conduct transcends convention through recognition becomes excuse for acting out.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Justifying harmful behavior as "beyond ethics"
- Actual mental illness confused with crazy wisdom
- Narcissistic acting-out claiming Dzogchen authority
- Missing that genuine transcendence is compassionate, not chaotic

**Cascade effects:**
<literal-madness> → <unethical-justification> (harm as wisdom) → <spiritual-narcissism> (me above rules) → <recognition-prevention-error> (chaos substitutes for wisdom).

---

[2351-2400] <ascetic-fetish> <charnel-ground-romanticism>

**Misreading:**
The references to charnel-ground roaming, fearlessness, and transcending pure/impure mean one should literally go to cemeteries, burial grounds, and frightening places as practice—physical asceticism proves spiritual attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Charnel-ground practice is documented in Buddhism. Fearlessness is admired quality. The descriptions ("abandon fear mind, go to charnel ground") sound like instructions.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct becomes physical ordeal. Practitioners believe they must go to scary places, court danger, or endure hardship to prove/practice Dzogchen. The teaching that fearlessness is recognition's natural quality becomes stunt performance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Deliberately seeking frightening experiences
- Believing danger-proving shows attainment
- Creating new suffering as "practice"
- Missing that natural fearlessness is not forced courage

**Cascade effects:**
<ascetic-fetish> → <ordeal-seeking> (danger as practice) → <suffering-creation> (new obstacles) → <recognition-prevention-error> (hardship substitutes for ease).

---

[2401-2500] <method-accumulation> <twenty-one-conduct-mastery>

**Misreading:**
The twenty-one (or twenty-two) conducts constitute a comprehensive system that practitioners should study, memorize, and progressively master—like a curriculum of conduct to complete.

**Why it arises:**
The enumeration suggests system. Buddhist traditions have conduct codes (śīla). The parallel structure (all "like X conduct") implies taxonomy. Comprehensive mastery appeals to achievers.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct becomes academic subject. Practitioners attempt to "learn all twenty-one conducts," believing this constitutes training. The teaching that these are metaphors for natural qualities becomes curriculum.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Memorizing and cataloging the twenty-one conducts
- Attempting to "practice" each conduct type
- Believing mastery of all twenty-one is necessary
- Missing that the twenty-one describe one natural conduct

**Cascade effects:**
<method-accumulation> → <curriculum-approach> (studying conducts) → <completion-quest> (mastering all) → <recognition-prevention-error> (knowledge substitutes for being).

---

[2501-2600] <linguistic-fixation> <tibetan-language-requirement>

**Misreading:**
The vajra song instructions and specific terminology require Tibetan language proficiency—only those who can sing in Tibetan, understand the terms, or receive oral instruction in Tibetan can practice these conducts.

**Why it arises:**
Tibetan terms are untranslated. Vajrayāna emphasizes correct pronunciation. The text is in Tibetan. Language barriers create mystique around "authentic" practice.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct becomes language-dependent. Practitioners believe they need Tibetan to "really" practice, creating dependence on translators/teachers. The teaching that conduct is universal becomes culturally bound.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing one must learn Tibetan for authentic practice
- Dependence on "authorized" translators/teachers
- Missing that recognition transcends language
- Cultural appropriation anxiety

**Cascade effects:**
<linguistic-fixation> → <language-dependence> (needing Tibetan) → <authority-dependence> (authorized teachers) → <recognition-prevention-error> (language substitutes for recognition).

---

[2601-2688] <non-dual-confusion> <beyond-ethics-misuse>

**Misreading:**
The description of conduct "beyond directions and divisions, like space" means Dzogchen practitioners are "beyond ethics," "beyond rules," and can do anything without karmic consequence—complete license.

**Why it arises:**
"Beyond" suggests transcendence of conventional ethics. Buddhist emptiness is often misread as license. The phrase "acceptance-rejection nonexistent" sounds like "no good or bad."

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes excuse for unethical behavior. Practitioners claim "beyond good and evil" to avoid moral responsibility. The teaching that recognition naturally expresses as virtue becomes virtue's denial.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Justifying harmful behavior as "beyond ethics"
- Narcissistic belief in one's transcendence
- Dismissing ethical concerns as "dualistic"
- Missing that genuine non-dual is compassionate, not amoral

**Cascade effects:**
<non-dual-confusion> → <ethical-nihilism> (rejecting morality) → <harmful-justification> (hurting as wisdom) → <recognition-prevention-error> (license substitutes for liberation).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Line 2064 continues from 02-17-03-01.txt's conduct outline. This file presents extensive conduct teachings including three vehicle types, twenty-one animal conducts, and vajra song/dance.

ERROR RISK: Readers may study the twenty-one conducts as behavioral prescriptions without recognizing they are metaphors for spontaneous naturalness. The extensive descriptions invite literal behavioral interpretation.

SCHOLAR CHECK: Verify reader understands the twenty-one conducts as metaphors describing qualities of natural conduct (bee's enjoyment, lion's fearlessness, child's spontaneity, etc.), not as behavioral rules to follow.

[COMPLETE SECTION NOTE]

This section (02-17-04-01.txt) presents the most extensive conduct teaching in the mdzod, including vehicle stratification, twenty-one animal conducts, and vajra song/dance. Error-potential is extreme because:

1. **Vehicle hierarchy** creating graduated conduct levels
2. **Behavioral mimicry** imitating animal behaviors literally
3. **Performance obsession** ritualizing songs and dances
4. **Temporal ritualism** scheduling conduct at specific times
5. **Secrecy fetish** creating esoteric exclusivity
6. **Madness license** justifying unethical behavior
7. **Ascetic romanticism** seeking dangerous ordeals
8. **Method accumulation** treating twenty-one as curriculum
9. **Language dependence** requiring Tibetan proficiency
10. **Non-dual confusion** using "beyond ethics" as license

The delusion analysis must repeatedly emphasize: these elaborate conduct descriptions are not behavioral prescriptions, ritual obligations, or curricula to master—they are poetic metaphors pointing to the spontaneous, natural activity of recognized awareness, which cannot be performed, scheduled, or mastered because it is already complete.
