<conduct-hierarchy> <vehicle-stratification>

**Misreading:**
The three types of conduct (sutra non-clinging, tantra without-acceptance-rejection, Dzogchen non-attachment) represent hierarchical progression—sutra conduct is beginner-level, tantra is intermediate, Dzogchen is advanced. One must graduate from lower to higher conduct.

**Why it arises:**
The threefold structure suggests stages. Buddhist traditions often present progressive paths (sutra → tantra → Dzogchen). The criticism of first two types implies superiority of third.

**Primary consequence:**
The distinction congeals into achievement hierarchy. Practitioners attempt to "reach" Dzogchen conduct, believing they must master lower forms first. The teaching that Dzogchen conduct is spontaneous expression congeals into goal to attain.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing one must "complete" sutra conduct before tantra
- Looking down on sutra practitioners as "lower"
- Attempting to "do" Dzogchen conduct before recognition
- Missing that the difference is recognition, not conduct-level

**Cascade effects:**
<conduct-hierarchy> → <graduated-practice> (working through levels) → <elitism> (Dzogchen superiority) → <recognition-prevention> (seeking advanced conduct).

[2084-2103] <ontological-error>
<behavioral-mimicry> <animal-conduct-literalism>

**Misreading:**
The twenty-one animal conduct similes (bee-like, deer-like, mute-like, peacock-like, madman-like, lion-like, dog-pig-like, owl-like, child-like, elephant-like, etc.) describe actual behavioral prescriptions—practitioners should literally imitate these animals' behaviors.

**Why it arises:**
The similes suggest emulation. "Madman conduct" is famous in Tibetan Buddhism. The specificity ("charnel-ground go," "abandon fear mind") sounds like instructions. Animal yoga is known in other traditions.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct congeals into behavioral imitation. Practitioners attempt to "act like a madman" or "be like a lion," creating affectation. The teaching that these are metaphors for spontaneous naturalness congeals into role-playing.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Deliberately trying to "be spontaneous like a child"
- Affected madness or unpredictability as "practice"
- Missing that the similes point to natural qualities, not behaviors
- Creating new persona: "Dzogchen practitioner who acts like..."

**Cascade effects:**
<behavioral-mimicry> → <affected-conduct> (pretending to be natural) → <identity-formation> (adopting yogi persona) → <recognition-prevention> (role substitutes for authenticity).

[2104-2123] <ontological-error>
<performance-obsession> <vajra-song-ritual>

**Misreading:**
The vajra song (rdo rje'i glu) and dance instructions describe actual performances—specific times, methods, and benefits of singing and dancing as ritual practices that produce spiritual results.

**Why it arises:**
"Song and dance" suggests performance. Tibetan Buddhism has elaborate ritual music/dance. The benefits listed ("companion to non-conceptual meditation," "goes before all conduct") imply efficacy.

**Primary consequence:**
Vajra song congeals into ritual performance. Practitioners attempt to "do" the songs and dances at prescribed times, believing this constitutes practice. The teaching that song/dance are spontaneous expression of recognition congeals into ceremonial obligation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Learning ritual songs and dances as "Dzogchen practice"
- Believing performance at specific times is necessary
- Missing that song/dance are natural outpouring, not ritual
- Creating performance anxiety about "doing it right"

**Cascade effects:**
<performance-obsession> → <ritual-obligation> (performing songs/dances) → <effortful-spontaneity> (trying to be natural) → <recognition-prevention> (ceremony substitutes for recognition).

[2124-2143] <ontological-error>
<temporal-ritualism> <five-times-obligation>

**Misreading:**
The five times for secret conduct (distinguishing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, feast gathering, empowerment, maṇḍala accomplishment, meditation enhancement) create a ritual calendar—practitioners must perform conduct at these specific times.

**Why it arises:**
"Five times" suggests schedule. Vajrayāna has elaborate ritual calendars. The specificity ("feast time," "empowerment time") implies temporal requirements.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct congeals into time-bound obligation. Practitioners believe they must "do" secret conduct at specific times, creating ritual schedule. The teaching that conduct is timeless natural expression congeals into temporal performance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Creating conduct-calendar: "today is feast time, must do..."
- Believing conduct is only appropriate at certain times
- Missing that spontaneous conduct is timeless
- Time-anxiety about "missing" right moment

**Cascade effects:**
<temporal-ritualism> → <schedule-obsession> (conduct calendar) → <performance-timing> (waiting for right time) → <recognition-prevention> (timing substitutes for timelessness).

[2144-2163] <ontological-error>
<secrecy-fetish> <hidden-practice-exclusivity>

**Misreading:**
The emphasis on "secret conduct" (gsang spyod) and "not seen by ordinary people" means these practices are esoteric, advanced, and hidden from beginners—requiring special initiation, qualification, or secrecy.

**Why it arises:**
"Secret" suggests esotericism. Vajrayāna has secret teachings (guhyamantra). "not seen by ordinary" implies exclusivity. Special advanced practices appeal to spiritual ambition.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct congeals into secret club. Practitioners believe they need special permission or qualification, creating hierarchy of "those who know" vs. "ordinary people." The teaching that conduct is natural congeals into esoteric mystique.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing one needs initiation for secret conduct
- Creating exclusivity around "advanced" practices
- Spiritual pride in "knowing the secrets"
- Missing that "secret" means spontaneously hidden, not deliberately concealed

**Cascade effects:**
<secrecy-fetish> → <esoteric-elitism> (special knowledge) → <initiation-dependence> (waiting for permission) → <recognition-prevention> (exclusivity substitutes for universality).

[2164-2183] <ontological-error>
<literal-madness> <crazy-wisdom-fetish>

**Misreading:**
The "madman-like conduct" and other transgressive behaviors (dog-pig-like, eating others' food, roaming charnel grounds) license actual antisocial, unethical, or insane behavior in the name of Dzogchen—"crazy wisdom" justifies anything.

**Why it arises:**
"Madman conduct" (smyon pa) is famous in Tibetan Buddhism. Transgressive behavior appears in siddha stories. "Beyond good and evil" suggests amorality. The descriptions sound like permission for outrageous acts.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen congeals into license for unethical behavior. Practitioners claim "crazy wisdom" to justify selfishness, harm, or mental instability. The teaching that conduct transcends convention through recognition congeals into excuse for acting out.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Justifying harmful behavior as "beyond ethics"
- Actual mental illness confused with crazy wisdom
- Narcissistic acting-out claiming Dzogchen authority
- Missing that genuine transcendence is compassionate, not chaotic

**Cascade effects:**
<literal-madness> → <unethical-justification> (harm as wisdom) → <spiritual-narcissism> (me above rules) → <recognition-prevention> (chaos substitutes for wisdom).

[2184-2203] <ontological-error>
<ascetic-fetish> <charnel-ground-romanticism>

**Misreading:**
The references to charnel-ground roaming, fearlessness, and transcending pure/impure mean one should literally go to cemeteries, burial grounds, and frightening places as practice—physical asceticism proves spiritual attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Charnel-ground practice is documented in Buddhism. Fearlessness is admired quality. The descriptions ("abandon fear mind, go to charnel ground") sound like instructions.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct congeals into physical ordeal. Practitioners believe they must go to scary places, court danger, or endure hardship to prove/practice Dzogchen. The teaching that fearlessness is recognition's natural quality congeals into stunt performance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Deliberately seeking frightening experiences
- Believing danger-proving shows attainment
- Creating new suffering as "practice"
- Missing that natural fearlessness is not forced courage

**Cascade effects:**
<ascetic-fetish> → <ordeal-seeking> (danger as practice) → <suffering-creation> (new obstacles) → <recognition-prevention> (hardship substitutes for ease).

[2204-2223] <ontological-error>
<method-accumulation> <twenty-one-conduct-mastery>

**Misreading:**
The twenty-one (or twenty-two) conducts constitute a comprehensive system that practitioners should study, memorize, and progressively master—like a curriculum of conduct to complete.

**Why it arises:**
The enumeration suggests system. Buddhist traditions have conduct codes (śīla). The parallel structure (all "like X conduct") implies taxonomy. Comprehensive mastery appeals to achievers.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct congeals into academic subject. Practitioners attempt to "learn all twenty-one conducts," believing this constitutes training. The teaching that these are metaphors for natural qualities congeals into curriculum.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Memorizing and cataloging the twenty-one conducts
- Attempting to "practice" each conduct type
- Believing mastery of all twenty-one is necessary
- Missing that the twenty-one describe one natural conduct

**Cascade effects:**
<method-accumulation> → <curriculum-approach> (studying conducts) → <completion-quest> (mastering all) → <recognition-prevention> (knowledge substitutes for being).

[2224-2243] <ontological-error>
<linguistic-fixation> <tibetan-language-requirement>

**Misreading:**
The vajra song instructions and specific terminology require Tibetan language proficiency—only those who can sing in Tibetan, understand the terms, or receive oral instruction in Tibetan can practice these conducts.

**Why it arises:**
Tibetan terms are untranslated. Vajrayāna emphasizes correct pronunciation. is in Tibetan. Language barriers create mystique around "authentic" practice.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct congeals into language-dependent. Practitioners believe they need Tibetan to "really" practice, creating dependence on translators/teachers. The teaching that conduct is universal congeals into culturally bound.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing one must learn Tibetan for authentic practice
- Dependence on "authorized" translators/teachers
- Missing that recognition transcends language
- Cultural appropriation anxiety

**Cascade effects:**
<linguistic-fixation> → <language-dependence> (needing Tibetan) → <authority-dependence> (authorized teachers) → <recognition-prevention> (language substitutes for recognition).

[2244-2263] <ontological-error>
<non-dual-confusion> <beyond-ethics-misuse>

**Misreading:**
The description of conduct "beyond directions and divisions, like space" means Dzogchen practitioners are "beyond ethics," "beyond rules," and can do anything without karmic consequence—complete license.

**Why it arises:**
"Beyond" suggests transcendence of conventional ethics. Buddhist emptiness is often misread as license. "acceptance-rejection nonexistent" sounds like "no good or bad."

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen congeals into excuse for unethical behavior. Practitioners claim "beyond good and evil" to avoid moral responsibility. The teaching that recognition naturally expresses as virtue congeals into virtue's denial.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Justifying harmful behavior as "beyond ethics"
- Narcissistic belief in one's transcendence
- Dismissing ethical concerns as "dualistic"
- Missing that genuine non-dual is compassionate, not amoral

**Cascade effects:**
<non-dual-confusion> → <ethical-nihilism> (rejecting morality) → <harmful-justification> (hurting as wisdom) → <recognition-prevention> (license substitutes for liberation).

[2264-2283] <ontological-error>
<trekcho-completion-achievement> <cutting-through-striving>

**Misreading:**
The teaching on trekcho (khregs chod) cutting through represents a practice to complete before moving to thogal (thod rgal) leap-over. One must "finish" trekcho through diligent cutting-through practice to qualify for advanced thogal visions.

**Why it arises:**
The two-phase structure (khregs chod → thod rgal) suggests progression. "Cutting through" sounds like practice method. Advanced practitioners emphasize thogal as higher.

**Primary consequence:**
Trekcho congeals into obstacle to cross. Practitioners obsess over "completing" trekcho, measuring progress in cutting-through, believing they need permission to "advance" to thogal. The instantaneous nature of trekcho congeals into prolonged project.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Measuring trekcho completion through experiences
- Comparing oneself to "thogal-ready" practitioners
- Missing that trekcho is recognition itself, not preliminary
- Creating hierarchical view of Dzogchen phases

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-completion-achievement> → <progress-measurement> (assessing cutting-through) → <thogal-sequential-waiting> (waiting for visions) → <recognition-prevention> (sequence substitutes for simultaneity).

[2284-2303] <ontological-error>
<light-phenomena-attachment> <light-phenomena-attachment>

**Misreading:**
The thogal (thod rgal) visions (thig le, rigs lnga, mtha' drug) are spiritual attainments to achieve through practice—successful practitioners will definitely experience these light phenomena, and their presence indicates progress.

**Why it arises:**
Descriptions of light phenomena are vivid and inspiring. "Visionary" experiences appeal to spiritual ambition. Buddhist traditions describe signs of attainment. Thogal visions sound like verifiable results.

**Primary consequence:**
Thogal congeals into vision-quest. Practitioners practice specifically to see light phenomena, believing these are "real" achievements. The natural display of awareness (rang snang) congeals into objective goal to produce.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety when visions don't appear
- Creating expectations that block natural unfolding
- Believing external lights indicate internal progress
- Comparing vision-experiences with other practitioners

**Cascade effects:**
<light-phenomena-attachment> → <phenomena-expectation> (waiting for lights) → <experience-validation> (needing visions) → <recognition-prevention> (appearances substitute for essence).

[2304-2323] <ontological-error>
<rainbow-body-obsession> <ja-lus-chasing>

**Misreading:**
The rainbow body ('ja' lus) is the ultimate goal of Dzogchen practice—the practitioner should work toward achieving this dissolution of physical body into light, which proves complete realization.

**Why it arises:**
Rainbow body accounts are dramatic and inspiring. Tangible "proof" of realization appeals to goal-oriented mind. Cultural fascination with physical transformation. Stories create aspiration.

**Primary consequence:**
Rainbow body congeals into spiritual trophy. Practitioners view Dzogchen as means to achieve spectacular physical dissolution, creating grasping at result. The natural dissolution of grasping congeals into object of grasping.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing rainbow body proves "real" Dzogchen
- Secretly hoping for dramatic death-display
- Missing that rainbow body is spontaneous, not achieved
- Creating subtle fear of "ordinary" death

**Cascade effects:**
<rainbow-body-obsession> → <result-grasping> (wanting dissolution) → <death-anxiety> (ordinary vs. special) → <recognition-prevention> (phenomenon substitutes for freedom).

[2324-2343] <ontological-error>
<bardo-preparation-fixation> <bar-do-technique-accumulation>

**Misreading:**
The bardo (bar do) teachings provide techniques to practice and master for navigating the death-intermediate state—one must prepare extensively through specific bardophobic practices to ensure favorable rebirth or liberation.

**Why it arises:**
Death anxiety seeks concrete methods. Bardo teachings are elaborate and systematic. "Preparation" implies practice requirements. Fear of unfavorable rebirth motivates technique accumulation.

**Primary consequence:**
Bardo congeals into fear-driven curriculum. Practitioners obsess over memorizing bardo stages, visualizing wrathful deities, and preparing for death-moment recognition. Natural recognition congeals into death-anxiety management.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Treating bardo as "exam" to study for
- Creating anxiety about "forgetting" during death
- Accumulating techniques as insurance policy
- Missing that bardo recognition is same as present recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<bardo-preparation-fixation> → <death-anxiety> (future preparation) → <technique-insurance> (accumulating methods) → <recognition-prevention> (preparation substitutes for presence).

[2344-2363] <ontological-error>
<phowa-technique-obsession> <consciousness-transference-fixation>

**Misreading:**
The phowa ('pho ba) consciousness-transference practice is a technique to perfect through repetition, ensuring one can "eject" consciousness through the crown aperture at death for guaranteed pure land rebirth.

**Why it arises:**
Phowa offers tangible method with guaranteed result. Death-anxiety seeks control. "Technique" implies trainable skill. Pure land rebirth is appealing goal.

**Primary consequence:**
Phowa congeals into mechanical technique. Practitioners obsess over "hitting the mark" (rig 'phrul) through repeated practice, believing they must perfect this "insurance policy." The natural openness of awareness congeals into ejection-technique.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety about "missing" the aperture
- Believing repeated practice produces death-mastery
- Viewing Dzogchen through phowa lens
- Missing that phowa is spontaneous when recognition is stable

**Cascade effects:**
<phowa-technique-obsession> → <mechanical-practice> (repetition training) → <death-control-illusion> (mastering transference) → <recognition-prevention> (technique substitutes for freedom).

[2364-2383] <ontological-error>
<ground-path-result-sequentiality> <gzhi-lam-'bras-bu-linearization>

**Misreading:**
The ground (gzhi), path (lam), and result ('bras bu) schema represents three sequential stages: first discovering ground, then traversing path, finally achieving result—like journey with distinct phases.

**Why it arises:**
"Ground-path-result" sounds like developmental progression. Buddhist traditions describe paths and stages. Temporal mind structures experience chronologically. Result seems future attainment.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen congeals into three-stage journey. Practitioners believe they must "establish" ground recognition, then "traverse" path of practice, eventually "attaining" result—when these are actually simultaneous.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Searching for "ground" as something separate
- Believing "path" requires effortful travel
- Waiting for "result" as future achievement
- Missing that gzhi-lam-'bras bu are one moment's view

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-result-sequentiality> → <temporal-projection> (chronologizing) → <attainment-future> (waiting for result) → <recognition-prevention> (sequence substitutes for simultaneity).

[2384-2403] <ontological-error>
<ka-dag-reification> <primordial-purity-essence>

**Misreading:**
Ka-dag (ka dag), primordial purity, refers to an original state or essence that exists prior to contamination—a pure ground-nature that is the true self waiting to be discovered.

**Why it arises:**
"Primordial" suggests temporal priority. "Purity" implies original essence. Essence-thinking pervades spiritual seeking. The term sounds like metaphysical ground.

**Primary consequence:**
Ka-dag turns metaphysical essence. Practitioners seek "the primordially pure nature" as if it were a thing to find, grasping at "primordial purity" as ontological substrate.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Eternalistic view dressed as Dzogchen
- Searching for "pure awareness" as entity
- Creating separation between "pure" and "impure"
- Missing that ka-dag negates essence, not affirms it

**Cascade effects:**
<ka-dag-reification> → <essence-grasping> (original nature) → <eternalistic-view> (substrate-belief) → <recognition-prevention> (thing-found substitutes for emptiness).

[2404-2422] <ontological-error>
<lhun-grub-reification> <spontaneous-presence-thing>

**Misreading:**
Lhun-grub (lhun grub), spontaneous presence/self-perfection, describes an inherent quality or capacity of the ground—something the base possesses that allows spontaneous manifestation.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous presence" sounds like attribute. Buddhist traditions describe Buddha-nature qualities. Language suggests possession. Self-perfection implies inherent capacity.

**Primary consequence:**
Lhun-grub congeals into inherent quality. Practitioners believe awareness "has" spontaneous presence as characteristic, making self-perfection into something that characterizes something else.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Attributing qualities to awareness
- Believing spontaneous perfection is "how things are"
- Creating subtle duality between possessor and possessed
- Missing that lhun-grub is unfindable as attribute

**Cascade effects:**
<lhun-grub-reification> → <attribute-fixation> (characteristic-grasping) → <inherent-quality-view> (possession-belief) → <recognition-prevention> (quality substitutes for empty nature).

[2423-2441] <ontological-error>
<thugs-rje-reification> <responsive-compassion-substance>

**Misreading:**
Thugs-rje (thugs rje), compassion/responsive emanation, refers to an active power or energy that arises from the ground and manifests as compassionate response to beings' needs.

**Why it arises:**
"Compassion" suggests active quality. Buddhist traditions describe compassion as force. "Emanation" implies source. Thugs-rje sounds like metaphysical power.

**Primary consequence:**
Thugs-rje turns metaphysical energy. Practitioners view compassion as power flowing from ground, creating subtle reification of responsive capacity as thing-like force.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Viewing compassion as possession of realized ones
- Believing thugs-rje can be "increased"
- Creating duality between emanator and emanated
- Missing that thugs-rje is empty display, not force

**Cascade effects:**
<thugs-rje-reification> → <energy-substantialization> (power-view) → <emanation-duality> (source-product) → <recognition-prevention> (force substitutes for empty display).

[2442-2460] <ontological-error>
<essence-nature-compartmentalization> <ngo-bo-rang-bzhin-thugs-rje-separation>

**Misreading:**
The essence-nature-compassion trinity (ngo bo, rang bzhin, thugs rje) represents three distinct aspects or dimensions of the base that can be understood and experienced separately—like facets of a jewel.

**Why it arises:**
Threefold structure suggests separation. Analytical mind divides unity. Buddhist traditions describe "three bodies" separately. Language implies distinction.

**Primary consequence:**
Trinity congeals into compartmentalized. Practitioners study "essence" separately from "nature" separately from "compassion," missing their inseparability. Unity congeals into trinity of things.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Analyzing ngo-bo without rang-bzhin
- Treating thugs-rje as separate capacity
- Creating hierarchy among three aspects
- Missing that they are one reality's view

**Cascade effects:**
<essence-nature-compartmentalization> → <analytical-fragmentation> (separating unity) → <partial-grasping> (holding one aspect) → <recognition-prevention> (parts substitute for whole).

[2461-2479] <ontological-error>
<direct-recognition-achievement> <ngo-shes-goal-state>

**Misreading:**
Direct recognition (ngo shes pa, ngo sprod) is a special achievement, attainment, or goal-state that practitioners work toward through practice, pointing-out instructions, and meditation.

**Why it arises:**
"Recognition" suggests cognitive event. "Direct" implies special quality. Buddhist traditions describe attainments. Pointing-out seems like method toward result.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition congeals into prize to win. Practitioners view direct recognition as peak experience to achieve, creating goal-orientation toward what is already present. Practice congeals into recognition-chasing.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Waiting for "real" recognition to happen
- Comparing current state to "recognized" state
- Believing recognition requires special conditions
- Missing that recognition is not an achievement

**Cascade effects:**
<direct-recognition-achievement> → <experience-goal> (target state) → <present-rejection> (current state inadequate) → <recognition-prevention> (attainment substitutes for presence).

[2480-2498] <ontological-error>
<spontaneous-perfection-waiting> <lhun-rdzogs-passivity>

**Misreading:**
Spontaneous perfection (lhun rdzogs) means everything will automatically work out—one doesn't need to do anything because reality is already perfect, so waiting is the practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous" suggests automatic. "Perfection" implies everything's fine. Anti-effort romanticism. Misunderstanding of effortless nature.

**Primary consequence:**
Spontaneous perfection congeals into excuse for inaction. Practitioners justify laziness, lack of engagement, and ordinary distraction as "spontaneous perfection," creating complacent stasis.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Dismissing effort as "dualistic"
- Justifying ordinary mind habits as "perfection"
- Missing that spontaneity is dynamic, not passive
- Using Dzogchen to avoid change

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneous-perfection-waiting> → <passive-complacency> (inaction-justification) → <ordinary-mind-fixation> (habits-affirmed) → <recognition-prevention> (waiting substitutes for recognition).

[2499-2517] <ontological-error>
<self-liberation-complacency> <rang-grol-license>

**Misreading:**
Self-liberation (rang grol) means all phenomena liberate themselves automatically—one doesn't need to do anything about thoughts, emotions, or actions because they self-liberate.

**Why it arises:**
"Self-liberation" suggests automatic process. "All phenomena" sounds comprehensive. Misunderstanding of natural liberation. Desire for permission to not practice.

**Primary consequence:**
Self-liberation congeals into license for non-engagement. Practitioners allow harmful patterns to continue, claiming they "self-liberate," creating spiritual bypassing.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Justifying harmful behavior as "self-liberating"
- Allowing negative patterns to continue unchecked
- Dismissing ethics as unnecessary
- Missing that self-liberation requires recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<self-liberation-complacency> → <bypassing-behavior> (unchecked-patterns) → <ethical-dismissal> (morality-rejected) → <recognition-prevention> (license substitutes for liberation).

[2518-2536] <ontological-error>
<recognition-pressure> <ngo-shes-performance-anxiety>

**Misreading:**
Direct recognition is something one should be able to "get" or maintain consistently—pressure to recognize produces anxiety about not recognizing, which blocks natural recognition.

**Why it arises:**
"Recognition" implies active knowing. Achievement culture produces pressure. Fear of missing out. Comparing oneself to "recognized" teachers.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition congeals into performance pressure. Practitioners create anxiety about "getting it right," trying to force recognition, or worrying about losing recognition—missing that recognition is not an achievement to perform.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety about "not recognizing"
- Trying to "hold onto" recognition
- Comparing recognition-states with others
- Missing that recognition is not personal achievement

**Cascade effects:**
<recognition-pressure> → <performance-anxiety> (recognition-striving) → <grasping-recognition> (trying to hold) → <recognition-prevention> (pressure substitutes for ease).

[2537-2555] <ontological-error>
<vision-achievement-anxiety> <spontaneous-vision-effort>

**Misreading:**
The six visions/limits (mtha' drug) of thogal are achievements to work toward through practice—successful practitioners will progress through these stages, and failure to experience them indicates insufficient practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Stages" suggest progression. Vision descriptions are inspiring. Comparison with other practitioners. Achievement-orientation toward spiritual experiences.

**Primary consequence:**
Thogal visions become competitive achievements. Practitioners create anxiety about "progressing through" the six limits, measuring themselves against vision-descriptions, creating striving toward natural display.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety about "not having visions"
- Believing one is "behind" other practitioners
- Creating expectations that block natural unfolding
- Missing that visions are recognition's display, not goals

**Cascade effects:**
<vision-achievement-anxiety> → <progress-comparison> (measuring-visions) → <expectation-creation> (waiting for stages) → <recognition-prevention> (achievement substitutes for presence).

[2556-2574] <ontological-error>
<pure-land-destination> <de-bzhin-gshegs-pa'i-sngon-bsgrub>

**Misreading:**
The pure land (zhing khams) teachings describe actual destinations to achieve or be reborn in through practice, visualization, and merit accumulation—Sukhāvatī, Abhirati, etc. are places to reach.

**Why it arises:**
"Pure land" sounds like place. Buddhist traditions describe Buddha-fields spatially. Desire for favorable rebirth. Visualization practices create sense of "going somewhere."

**Primary consequence:**
Pure land congeals into geographical goal. Practitioners visualize pure lands as destinations to reach, accumulating "merit" for rebirth there, missing that pure land is mind's nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Viewing pure lands as external places
- Working toward rebirth as goal
- Creating duality between "here" and "there"
- Missing that zhing khams is inseparable from rig pa

**Cascade effects:**
<pure-land-destination> → <spatial-projection> (place-fantasy) → <rebirth-goal> (destination-striving) → <recognition-prevention> (there substitutes for here).

[2575-2593] <ontological-error>
<deity-yoga-identification> <lha'i-rnal-'byor-fixation>

**Misreading:**
Deity yoga (lha'i rnal 'byor) involves identifying with a specific deity through visualization, mantra, and mudra, creating the sense that "I am the deity" as practice achievement.

**Why it arises:**
Deity practices are elaborate and systematic. "Identification" sounds like method. Buddhist tantra emphasizes deity yoga. Visualizations create strong sense of "becoming."

**Primary consequence:**
Deity yoga congeals into identity-achievement. Practitioners work to "become" the deity through practice, creating subtle duality between practitioner and deity, and missing that all forms are awareness-display.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing one "congeals into" a deity through practice
- Creating hierarchy between "ordinary me" and "deity-me"
- Viewing Dzogchen through tantric deity-lens
- Missing that lha is rang snang, not transformation

**Cascade effects:**
<deity-yoga-identification> → <identity-achievement> (becoming-practice) → <duality-reinforcement> (practitioner-deity) → <recognition-prevention> (transformation substitutes for nature).

[2594-2612] <ontological-error>
<ground-path-result-reification> <gzhi-lam-'bras-bhu-thingification>

**Misreading:**
Ground, path, and result are three distinct realities or things—the ground is the base, the path is what we traverse, and the result is what we achieve—like three separate entities.

**Why it arises:**
Language suggests separate nouns. Analytical thinking divides. Buddhist traditions discuss them separately. Common sense sees journey with start/middle/end.

**Primary consequence:**
Gzhi-lam-'bras-bu become reified as things. Practitioners view ground as "thing to find," path as "thing to travel," result as "thing to achieve," creating triple reification of unity.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Searching for "ground" as lost object
- Viewing path as territory to cover
- Waiting for "result" as future acquisition
- Missing that they are one reality's three views

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-result-reification> → <triple-thingification> (three-entities) → <attainment-separation> (finding-traveling-getting) → <recognition-prevention> (things substitute for view).

[2613-2631] <ontological-error>
<primordial-purity-waiting> <ka-dag-temporal-projection>

**Misreading:**
Primordial purity (ka dag) refers to an original state before time that one can return to or recover through practice—"primordial" means "long ago" and "purity" means uncontaminated.

**Why it arises:**
"Primordial" suggests temporal priority. "Purity" implies pre-fall state. Creation myths influence thinking. Desire to return to "better" state.

**Primary consequence:**
Ka-dag congeals into lost golden age. Practitioners view themselves as separated from primordial purity, working to "return" to it, creating temporal dualism of "then" vs "now."

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing oneself "fallen" from original state
- Working to "recover" primordial purity
- Creating nostalgia for pre-contaminated condition

<spontaneous-presence-achievement> <lhun-grub-striving>

**Misreading:**
Spontaneous presence (lhun grub) is a quality to develop or increase through practice—one should work to make awareness more "spontaneously present" and self-perfected.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous" sounds positive. "Presence" suggests quality to cultivate. Buddhist traditions describe developing qualities. Self-improvement mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Lhun-grub congeals into self-improvement goal. Practitioners attempt to "increase" spontaneous presence, believing they can make awareness more self-perfected through effort.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Measuring "spontaneity-level"
- Believing practice "enhances" lhun-grub
- Creating subtle effort toward effortlessness
- Missing that lhun-grub is never absent

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneous-presence-achievement> → <quality-development> (improving-presence) → <effort-toward-effortlessness> (striving-to-spontaneity) → <recognition-prevention> (development substitutes for nature).

<compassion-accumulation> <thugs-rje-cultivation>

**Misreading:**
Compassion (thugs rje) is a quality to cultivate, develop, and increase through practice—one should work on becoming more compassionate, expanding thugs-rje as attribute of realization.

**Why it arises:**
"Compassion" suggests virtuous quality. Buddhist traditions teach compassion cultivation. Self-improvement toward virtue. Thugs-rje sounds like capacity to develop.

**Primary consequence:**
Thugs-rje congeals into cultivation project. Practitioners attempt to "develop" compassion as quality of awareness, creating subtle dualism between cultivator and cultivated.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Measuring "compassion-level"
- Believing realization "increases" compassion
- Creating effort toward "natural" responsiveness
- Missing that thugs-rje is empty display, not quality

**Cascade effects:**
<compassion-accumulation> → <virtue-cultivation> (developing-thugs-rje) → <attainment-hierarchy> (more-compassionate) → <recognition-prevention> (cultivation substitutes for nature).
