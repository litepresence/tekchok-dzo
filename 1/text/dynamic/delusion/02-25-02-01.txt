<result-achievement-fantasy> <bras-bu-thob-pa-goal>

**Misreading:**
The three kayas as result ('bras bu) describe an attainment to achieve through practice—Buddhahood as the earned fruit of successful Dzogchen practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Result" suggests outcome. "Obtained" (thob) implies achievement. Path-fruit framework. Buddhist sādhana culture. Effort-reward mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Result becomes achievement goal. Practitioners work toward obtaining three kayas, treating 'bras bu as future destination.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Working to "attain" Buddhahood
- Believing practice produces result
- Waiting for three kayas to manifest
- What's missed: that kayas are already present

**Cascade effects:**
<result-achievement-fantasy> triggers <goal-orientation> (future-aiming) triggers <production-view> (practice-makes-Buddha) generates <recognition-blocked> (achievement substitutes for being).

<ground-appearance-separation> <ngos-'char-gzhi-snang-duality>

**Misreading:**
The three kayas appearing from the ground's essence (ngo bo'i 'char gzhi las) suggests the kayas arise from or depend upon the ground—ground as source, kayas as products.

**Why it arises:**
"From" suggests origin. Ground-appearance language. Cause-effect habits. Source/derivative thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Ground and kayas become separate. One might assume gzhi produces sku gsum, creating source/display duality.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing ground "contains" kayas
- Creating producer/product relationship
- Searching for source beneath appearance
- Unrecognized: that gzhi and sku are inseparable

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-appearance-separation> generates <source-derivative> (ground-producing) generates <origin-seeking> (finding-source) leads to <rigpa-unseen> (separation substitutes for unity).

<three-gate-purification-project> <sgo-gsum-dag-pa-method>

**Misreading:**
Purifying the stains of the three gates (dag bya sgo gsum gyi dri ma dag) is a cleansing process applied to body, speech, and mind—systematic defilement removal.

**Why it arises:**
"Purify" suggests cleaning. "Stains" implies dirt. Three gates as objects. Methodical approach. Impurity-purity duality.

**Primary consequence:**
Purification becomes cleaning operation. Practitioners work on "purifying" each gate, maintaining stain-remover duality.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Systematic defilement removal
- Believing gates need cleansing
- Creating pure/impure hierarchy
- Unrecognized: that dag pa is recognition, not removal

**Cascade effects:**
<three-gate-purification-project> leads to <cleansing-operation> (stain-removal) → <gate-fixation> (working-on-body-speech-mind) → <nature-missed> (purification substitutes for nature).

<scriptural-authority-dependence> <thal-'gyur-lung-validation>

**Misreading:**
The Thal 'gyur citation proves the three kayas are obtained through mind, speech, and body activities—scripture validating the mechanism of attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Citation formula implies authority. "From Thal 'gyur" suggests proof. Text-validation culture. Mechanism-seeking.

**Primary consequence:**
Scripture becomes validation source. Practitioners cite Thal 'gyur as evidence for attainment method, treating text as authority.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing citation confirms mechanism
- Text-dependent understanding
- Missing direct recognition
- Creating scriptural/living duality

**Cascade effects:**
<scriptural-authority-dependence> creates <awareness-overlooked>

---

<cause-result-entity-binding> <rgyu-'bras-btags-pa-reification>

**Misreading:**
The cause-result of what is to be purified (dag bya'i rgyu 'bras) is an actual binding or connection—real causal links that must be severed through practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Cause-result" language. Buddhist dependent origination habits. "Binding" suggests real connection. Entity-preservation.

**Primary consequence:**
Cause-result becomes substantial binding. It's commonly thought that rgyu 'bras is real connection requiring severance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing in causal entities
- Working to "cut" connections
- Maintaining cause-effect framework
- The blind spot: that rgyu 'bras is empty designation

**Cascade effects:**
<cause-result-entity-binding> triggers <connection-reification> (real-binding) → <severance-project> (cutting-links) → <ground-ignored> (causality substitutes for emptiness).

---

<spontaneous-accomplishment-attribute> <lhun-grub-yon-tan-possession>

**Misreading:**
Spontaneously accomplished by nature (rang bzhin du lhun grub) means awareness inherently possesses spontaneous presence as a quality or characteristic.

**Why it arises:**
"By nature" suggests inherent quality. "Spontaneously" implies attribute. Possession language. Characteristic thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Lhun grub becomes possessed attribute. The belief forms that spontaneous presence is quality awareness has.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Attributing qualities to nature
- Believing lhun grub describes "what is"
- Creating possessor/possessed duality
- Missing that lhun grub is unfindable

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneous-accomplishment-attribute> leads to <quality-possession> (having-characteristic) → <descriptive-reification> (what-awareness-is) → <awareness-overlooked> (attribute substitutes for nature).

---

<cause-condition-production-impossibility> <rgyu-rkyen-bskyed-pa-rejection>

**Misreading:**
The impossibility of attainment through causes and conditions (rgyu rkyen gyis bskyed nas thob pa) means practice is unnecessary—since causes can't produce the result, no effort is required.

**Why it arises:**
"Impossible" suggests rejection. "Not produced" implies no need. Anti-effort romanticism. Laziness justification.

**Primary consequence:**
Impossibility becomes license for inaction. Practitioners dismiss all effort, believing nothing needs to be done.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Rejecting practice as unnecessary
- Justifying ordinary habits
- Believing "nothing to do" means do nothing
- Missing that recognition is the "doing"

**Cascade effects:**
<cause-condition-production-impossibility> leads to <practice-rejection> (no-effort-needed) → <ordinary-justification> (habits-as-fine) → <rigpa-unseen> (inaction substitutes for recognition).

---

<three-kaya-enumeration-separation> <sku-gsum-grangs-dbye-duality>

**Misreading:**
The three kayas (sku gsum) and five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) are distinct categories—eight separate realities to know individually.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" and "five" suggest count. Enumeration invites separation. Category-thinking. Analytical habits.

**Primary consequence:**
Kayas and wisdoms become separate entities. Practitioners study sku gsum and ye shes lnga as distinct, fragmenting unity.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Knowing kayas separately from wisdoms
- Creating eight-fold multiplicity
- Missing their inseparability
- Compartmentalizing enlightened mind

**Cascade effects:**
<three-kaya-enumeration-separation> generates <multiplicity-creation> (eight-things) → <category-fixation> (separate-classes) → <recognition-blocked> (division substitutes for unity).

---

<pearland-citation-authority> <mu-tig-phreng-ba-lung>

**Misreading:**
The Pearl Garland (Mu tig phreng ba) citation establishes scriptural authority for the three kayas as result—textual proof validating the doctrine.

**Why it arises:**
Citation formula implies authority. Source-name suggests validation. Text-dependence. Proof-seeking.

**Primary consequence:**
Scripture becomes doctrine source. Practitioners rely on Mu tig phreng ba for kayas-view, treating citation as foundation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Text-dependent Buddhism
- Believing citation establishes truth
- Missing self-evident recognition
- Creating external/internal authority duality

**Cascade effects:**
<pearland-citation-authority> → <rigpa-unseen>

---

<vajrasattva-instruction-dependence> <rdo-rje-sems-dpa'-man-ngag>

**Misreading:**
The Vajrasattva Heart Mirror (rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long) citation provides essential instruction that must be followed—heart advice requiring adherence.

**Why it arises:**
"Heart mirror" suggests sacred instruction. "Know that" implies command. Authority-dependence. Following mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Instruction becomes requirement. Practitioners follow Vajrasattva teaching as rule, treating man ngag as obligation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Adhering to instructions
- Believing "know" means understand conceptually
- Creating follower/teaching duality
- Missing that recognition is not following

**Cascade effects:**
<vajrasattva-instruction-dependence> produces <adherence-requirement> (following-teaching) → <conceptual-knowledge> (understanding-instruction) → <ground-ignored> (following substitutes for being).

---

<irreversibility-security> <phyir-mi-ldog-pa-guarantee>

**Misreading:**
The irreversibility (phyir mi ldog pa) of the three kayas provides security—once attained, one cannot fall back, offering guarantee against regression.

**Why it arises:**
"Irreversible" suggests permanence. "Guarantee" implies safety. Security-seeking. Fear of loss. Achievement-protection.

**Primary consequence:**
Irreversibility becomes security blanket. Practitioners seek phyir mi ldog pa as insurance, treating recognition as protected state.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Seeking irreversible attainment
- Fear of "falling back"
- Believing recognition can be lost
- Creating attainment/security duality

**Cascade effects:**
<irreversibility-security> triggers <insurance-seeking> (guarantee-wanting) → <loss-fear> (falling-back) → <recognition-blocked> (security substitutes for naturalness).

---

<path-result-contradiction-anxiety> <lam-bras-'gal-ba-confusion>

**Misreading:**
The discussion of whether three kayas as path-appearance contradicts their being result creates anxiety about correct view—fear of holding contradictory positions.

**Why it arises:**
"Contradiction" suggests error. "Removing" implies problem. Anxiety about wrong view. Correct-answer seeking.

**Primary consequence:**
Contradiction becomes error to avoid. Practitioners worry about holding 'gal ba views, seeking correct formulation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety about view correctness
- Seeking non-contradictory formulation
- Believing one perspective must be right
- Missing that path and result are perspectives, not positions

**Cascade effects:**
<path-result-contradiction-anxiety> produces <view-correctness-obsession> (right-formulation) → <perspective-entrenchment> (taking-sides) → <awareness-overlooked> (position substitutes for seeing).

---

<early-master-authority-appeal> <sngar-rabs-pa-khri-lung>

**Misreading:**
The early masters (sngar rabs pa) said "not result" and their authority resolves the contradiction—appeal to lineage masters as truth-source.

**Why it arises:**
"Early masters" suggests authority. Lineage-validation culture. Teacher-dependence. Historical authority appeal.

**Primary consequence:**
Masters become authority source. Practitioners cite sngar rabs pa as proof, treating lineage as validation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Authority-dependent view
- Believing masters establish truth
- Missing self-evident recognition
- Creating external/internal authority duality

**Cascade effects:**
<early-master-authority-appeal> produces <lineage-validation> (master-as-proof) → <teacher-dependence> (authority-seeking) → <obscuration> (authority substitutes for directness).

---

<extreme-attachment-avoidance> <mthar-'dzin-spang-pa-project>

**Misreading:**
The statement that early masters freed us from extreme attachment to three kayas as truly existent results describes a project of avoiding extremes—systematic non-attachment practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Freeing" suggests method. "Extreme" implies danger. Avoidance mentality. Middle-way project.

**Primary consequence:**
Freedom becomes avoidance project. Practitioners work on "not attaching," creating non-attachment as goal.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Practicing non-attachment
- Believing detachment is freedom
- Creating attacher/attachment duality
- Missing that freedom is recognition, not avoidance

**Cascade effects:**
<extreme-attachment-avoidance> leads to <detachment-project> (non-attaching) → <extreme-avoidance> (middle-way-practice) → <obscuration> (avoidance substitutes for presence).

---

<three-cycle-ultimate-denial> <skor-gsum-mthar-thug-rejection>

**Misreading:**
The refutation of those who hold the three cycles as ultimate (skor gsum la sbubs mthar thug tu 'dod pa) validates a higher non-cyclic view—ultimate truth beyond all formulations.

**Why it arises:**
"Refutation" suggests correction. "Ultimate" implies hierarchy. Higher-view seeking. Transcendence fantasy.

**Primary consequence:**
Refutation becomes view-elevation. Practitioners seek mthar thug beyond skor gsum, treating transcendence as goal.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Seeking "highest" view
- Believing beyond is better
- Creating cyclic/transcendent duality
- Missing that all views are perspectives

**Cascade effects:**
<three-cycle-ultimate-denial> generates <ground-ignored>

---

<primordial-purity-essence-misunderstanding> <ka-dag-ngo-bo-'khrul-pa>

**Misreading:**
Those who don't understand the essence of primordially pure internal expanse (ka dag gi nang dbyings kyi ngo bo) as the nature are in great error—suggests correct understanding is essential.

**Why it arises:**
"Not understanding" suggests error. "Great error" implies danger. Correct-understanding seeking. Knowledge-validation.

**Primary consequence:**
Understanding becomes requirement. Practitioners seek correct ngo bo knowledge, treating comprehension as essential.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Working to "understand" correctly
- Fear of misunderstanding
- Creating understander/understood duality
- Missing that recognition transcends understanding

**Cascade effects:**
<primordial-purity-essence-misunderstanding> → <obscuration>

---

<internal-expanse-spatialization> <nang-dbyings-ghat-grong-reification>

**Misreading:**
The primordially pure internal expanse (ka dag gi nang dbyings) is a space or container—an internal dimension or realm where purity abides.

**Why it arises:**
"Internal" suggests location. "Expanse" implies space. Container thinking. Spatial metaphors taken literally.

**Primary consequence:**
Expanse becomes spatial container. The assumption arises that nang dbyings is internal realm, reifying space.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Believing in internal dimension
- Seeking "inside" expanse
- Creating container/contained duality
- Missing that dbyings is not spatial

**Cascade effects:**
<internal-expanse-spatialization> produces <nature-missed>

---

<simultaneous-path-result-attainment> <lam-bras-cig-car-achievement>

**Misreading:**
Path-appearance and result existing simultaneously without contradiction (lam snang yang yin 'bras bu yang yin pa mi 'gal) describes an attainment where both are held together—advanced non-dual achievement.

**Why it arises:**
"Simultaneous" suggests state. "Without contradiction" implies achievement. Non-dual romanticism. Advanced-view fantasy.

**Primary consequence:**
Simultaneity becomes elevated state. Practitioners seek to "hold" path and result together, treating non-contradiction as attainment.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Working to "simultaneously" hold views
- Believing non-contradiction is advanced
- Creating holder/held duality
- Missing that simultaneity is natural, not achieved

**Cascade effects:**
<simultaneous-path-result-attainment> triggers <non-dual-achievement> (holding-together) → <advanced-view-seeking> (beyond-contradiction) → <ground-ignored> (attainment substitutes for naturalness).
