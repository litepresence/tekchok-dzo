[8112-8137] <ground-path-fruition-temporization>
**Risk:** Presenting ground-path-fruition as sequential stages creates temporal hierarchy requiring progressive development.

**Why:** Grammatical structure suggests sequence through particle chains. Western progressive models project onto threefold structure.

**Consequence:** Ground becomes past origin needing recovery. Path becomes present effort. Fruition becomes future goal. Shifts from spontaneous presence to developmental achievement.

**Cascade:** Stage anxiety, progress obsession, achievement orientation, completion fixation, chronic dissatisfaction.

[8112-8125] <nine-ya-hierarchy>
**Risk:** Nine vehicles presented as ranked progression creating elitist spiritual stratification.

**Why:** Numerical sequence suggests ascending order. Comparative language implies superiority/inferiority.

**Consequence:** Vehicles substantialized as hierarchy. Superiority/inferiority complex. Spiritual caste system develops.

**Cascade:** Vehicle-chauvinism, sectarian aggression, competition, tradition fragmentation.

[8126-8131] <view-misplacement>
**Risk:** View established as philosophical position to adopt through study rather than direct recognition.

**Why:** Definitional language suggests possession. Academic training privileges conceptual mastery.

**Consequence:** View substantialized as belief inventory. Intellectual understanding substituted for realization.

**Cascade:** Philosophy fixation, intellectual arrogance, dialectical debates, conceptual imprisonment.

**CORRECTION:** The Dzogchen view presents ground, path, and fruition as simultaneous aspects of one recognition—not developmental stages. Recognition is immediate, not gradual. The ground is not past, path is not present effort, fruition is not future achievement—all are the present nature, recognized now or not at all.

The nine vehicles are nine ways of describing the same nature, not ranks to climb. The lowest and highest vehicle point to the same recognition.

View is not a position to adopt but a recognition to be lived. Understanding words is not the same as knowing the nature.
