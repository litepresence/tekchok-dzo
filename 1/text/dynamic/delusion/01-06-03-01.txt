[8112-8119] <ritual-mechanism> [VASE EMPOWERMENT AS OBJECT-TRANSFER]
**Misreading:**
The elaborate description of vase empowerment with auspicious substances, royal possessions, and statue blessings is interpreted as establishing that physical objects and substances mechanically transmit empowerment.

**Why it arises:**
Material causation thinking. Ritual objects suggest tangible transfer. Physical descriptions invite literal interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
Object-dependence. The practitioner believes empowerment requires specific physical implements.

**Secondary consequences:**
Materialism; ritual-obsession; missing that empowerment is recognition, not object-transfer.

**Cascade effects:**
<materialism> through object-causality.
<ritual-formalism> through implement-requirement.

[8120-8125] <substance-transmission> [BODHICITTA AS PHYSICAL]
**Misreading:**
The "two bodhicittas" of secret empowerment are interpreted as literal physical substances that must be transmitted for empowerment to be complete.

**Why it arises:**
Somatic literalism. "Giving bodhicitta" suggests physical transfer. Taboo reinforces material interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
Substance-dependency. The practitioner believes secret empowerment requires physical substances.

**Secondary consequences:**
Health risks; substance-obsession; missing symbolic dimensions.

**Cascade effects:**
<somatic-reductionism> through substance-literalism.
<magical-thinking> through physical-causality.

[8121-8124] <attachment-typology> [ATTACHED/FREE AS PERMANENT TYPES]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between practitioners "free from attachment" (using meditation mudrā) and "attached" (using action mudrā) is interpreted as establishing permanent personality types.

**Why it arises:**
Typology habit. Two categories suggest types. Personality frameworks.

**Primary consequence:**
Identity-fixation. The practitioner identifies as "attached type" or "free type."

**Secondary consequences:**
Limiting flexibility; self-fulfilling prophecy; missing that attachment is fluid.

**Cascade effects:**
<identity-fixation> through typology.
<practice-limitation> through type-assignment.

[8126-8133] <word-empowerment-magic> [VIEW/MEDITATION/RIGPA AS LEVELS]
**Misreading:**
The three aspects of word empowerment (external view, internal meditation, secret rigpa) are interpreted as hierarchical levels, with rigpa as highest.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking. Three items suggest ranking. "Secret" implies superiority.

**Primary consequence:**
Level-climbing. The practitioner seeks "secret rigpa empowerment" as most advanced.

**Secondary consequences:**
Skipping view/meditation; premature rigpa focus; missing that three are simultaneous.

**Cascade effects:**
<elitism-error> through hierarchy.
<practice-path-confusion> through premature advancement.

[8131-8133] <introduction-magic> [POINTING-OUT AS TRANSMISSION]
**Misreading:**
"Introducing rigpa through introduction" is interpreted as establishing that the teacher transmits something to the student through pointing-out.

**Why it arises:**
Transmission model. "Introduction" suggests transfer. Teacher-student dynamics.

**Primary consequence:**
Transmission-dependency. The practitioner believes teacher must "give" recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Guru-dependency; waiting for pointing-out; missing that recognition is self-recognized.

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through transmission-model.
<waiting-paralysis> through introduction-dependency.

[8134-8137] <fourfold-completeness> [FOUR EMPOWERMENTS AS SET]
**Misreading:**
The "definite four empowerments" are interpreted as establishing that all four must be received for complete or valid practice.

**Why it arises:**
Set-completion psychology. Four suggests wholeness. Fear of missing elements.

**Primary consequence:**
Empowerment-anxiety. The practitioner believes they need all four empowerments.

**Secondary consequences:**
Accumulation-obsession; missing that one recognition is sufficient; formalism.

**Cascade effects:**
<accumulation-mindset> through set-completion.
<perfectionism-paralysis> through four-requirement.
