[9079-9081] <red-bindu-materialization> <dmar-po-thig-le>

**Misreading:**
The initial red bindu (*dmar po*) of pure empowerment (*dbang rdzogs*) interpreted as a literal red sphere that appears in space, representing successful practice progress.

**Why it arises:**
"Red bindu" sounds like visionary target. "Pure empowerment" suggests achievement. Round self-luminous (*zlum po rang gsal*) description implies objective phenomenon.

**Primary consequence:**
Bindu-chasing: pursuing red sphere appearance as practice goal. Natural bindu-nature obscured by fixation on color-form.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Disappointment when red doesn't appear
- Missing that bindu is nature of awareness, not object
- Color-fixation: "I need to see red specifically"
- Reifying empowerment as external blessing

**Cascade effects:**
<red-bindu-materialization> → <bindu-chasing> [phenomenon pursuit] → <color-fixation> [specific appearance] → <natural-bindu-miss> [bindu already present]

[9081-9082] <finger-counting-achievement> <mdzub-gnyis-gsum-gyur>

**Misreading:**
The two fingers becoming three interpreted as literal measurement of bindu expansion—practitioners measuring visionary phenomena with physical gestures.

**Why it arises:**
"Two becoming three" suggests quantifiable growth. Physical reference (*mdzub* = finger) implies measurement. Expansion seems like progress.

**Primary consequence:**
Measurement-obsession: quantifying visionary growth. Natural immeasurability obscured by metric fixation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Comparing bindu sizes with others
- Missing that description is metaphorical
- Physical gesture as magic ritual
- Anxiety about "proper" expansion rate

**Cascade effects:**
<finger-counting-achievement> → <measurement-obsession> [quantifying visions] → <comparison-compulsion> [ sizing against others] → <natural-immeasurability-miss> [beyond size]

[9082-9085] <five-wisdom-color-collection> <ye-shes-lnga-kha-dog>

**Primary consequence:**
Color-collecting: pursuing chromatic appearances as wisdom achievements. Natural wisdom-display obscured by hue-hunting.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to see all five colors" checklist
- Missing that colors are nature-display, not collection
- Chromatic hierarchy: "blue is higher than yellow"
- Disappointment when colors don't match descriptions

**Cascade effects:**
<five-wisdom-color-collection> → <color-checklist> [completion mentality] → <chromatic-hierarchy> [ranking appearances] → <natural-wisdom-miss> [wisdom already displaying]

[9085] <effort-reification> <rtsol-ba>

**Misreading:**
The mention of effort (*rtsol ba*) in initial visions interpreted as meaning practitioners should apply effort to see colors, making visions result of striving.

**Why it arises:**

**Primary consequence:**
Effort-fixation: straining to produce visions. Natural effortless display obscured by forceful practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Tension headaches from trying too hard
- Missing that effort refers to initial familiarization
- Strain-as-virtue: "no pain, no gain"
- Exhaustion from over-efforting

**Cascade effects:**
<effort-reification> → <strain-practice> [forceful meditation] → <exhaustion-cycle> [depletion] → <natural-effortlessness-miss> [spontaneity already present]

[9086-9089] <effortless-vision-dependency> <rtsol-bral>

**Misreading:**
The "effortless visions" (*rtsol bral*) appearing from wind element interpreted as advanced state where visions arise without practice, creating dependency on conditions.

**Why it arises:**
"Effortless" sounds like automatic. "Wind element" suggests external cause. "External" (*phyi pa*) implies independence from practitioner.

**Primary consequence:**
Condition-dependency: waiting for right circumstances. Natural ever-presence obscured by situational attachment.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need wind/space element right"
- Missing that effortlessness is nature, not condition
- Externalizing appearance-causes
- Passivity: "waiting for visions"
