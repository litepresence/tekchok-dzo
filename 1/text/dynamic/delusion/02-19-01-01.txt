**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes non-holding-effort. "I don't hold appearances as mind." Natural non-conceptuality replaced by practiced restraint.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Restraint-practice
- Effortful non-doing
- Missing that non-holding is natural, not practiced

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <restraint-practice> (not doing), <effortful-non-conceptuality> (stopping thought), <discipline-approach> (controlled mind), <recognition-prevention> (effort obscures natural ease).

**Misreading:**
"Not experiencing mind as existent is great ground-awakening" (*sems yod ma myong gzhi sangs chen po*) interpreted as achievement—not having certain experiences.

**Why it arises:**
"Not experiencing" suggests absence. Ground-awakening implies attainment. Achievement model. Experience-avoidance.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes experience-avoidance. "I don't experience mind as existent." Natural absence replaced by cultivated non-experience.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Avoidance-practice
- Absence-cultivation
- Missing that non-experience is always already present

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <experience-avoidance> (not having), <absence-cultivation> (cultivating lack), <achievement-absence> (attaining non-experience), <recognition-prevention> (cultivation obscures natural absence).

[PAGE BLEED AWARENESS]

Pages 6414-7105 present Trekcho completion, Thogal introduction, and the culmination of Dzogchen practice instructions. This is the pinnacle of the text's teachings with MAXIMUM error risk.

**ERROR RISK:** These teachings on Trekcho (*khregs chod*) and Thogal (*thod rgal*) are commonly misunderstood as:
1. Sequential practices (Trekcho first, then Thogal)
2. Techniques to achieve (meditation methods)
3. Special states to reach (experiences to have)
4. Union of two things (appearance and awareness merging)
5. Progressive achievements (levels of realization)

**SCHOLAR CHECK:** Ensure reader understands:
- Trekcho and Thogal point to the same recognition, not sequential stages
- Neither is a technique—both point to ever-present nature
- "Union" means never-separated, not merging
- "Results" are simultaneous recognitions, not progressive achievements
- All analogies (cloud-sky, dream, illusion, water-waves) point to natural condition, not practices

**CONTINUITY NOTE:** 
- Lines 6414-6521: Trekcho completion analysis
- Lines 6522-6688: Thogal introduction and vision teachings  
- Lines 6689-6800: Three results and dissolution
- Lines 6801-7105: Heart Essence instructions and union

This material represents the most subtle and easily misunderstood teachings in the entire Treasury. Extreme care required.

[7106-7149] <deity-yoga-reification> <lha'i-'khor-lo-construct>
**Misreading:**

**Why it arises:**
"Deity" suggests supernatural being. Yoga implies practice. Empowerment feels tangible. Ritual provides structure.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen reduced to tantric methodology. "I do deity practice." The spontaneous nature obscured by constructed ritual.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Reifying deities as external entities
- Empowerment-seeking behavior
- Missing that all appearances are already deity-display

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <tantric-fundamentalism> (ritual obsession), <deity-reification> (external gods), <empowerment-dependency> (needing permission), <recognition-prevention> (construction obscures spontaneity).

---

[7150-7182] <mahamudra-conflation> <phyag-rgya-chen-po-collapse>
**Misreading:**
References to Mahamudra (*phyag rgya chen po*) interpreted as endorsement of gradual Mahamudra path—confusing Dzogchen with Kagyu practice systems.

**Why it arises:**
"Mahamudra" is familiar term. Shared terminology suggests shared path. Kagyu methods are well-documented. Confusion of similar words.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen co-opted into Mahamudra framework. "It's the same thing." The unique pointing-out instruction lost in generic "great seal" talk.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Kagyu method application to Dzogchen
- Gradual path imposition
- Missing that Dzogchen points differently

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <tradition-conflation> (collapsing distinctions), <method-transfer> (wrong technique), <pointing-confusion> (mixed instructions), <recognition-prevention> (wrong framework obscures direct pointing).

**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes laughter-cultivation. "Ha ha! I'm so free!" The natural ease obscured by performed spontaneity.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Affectation of freedom
- Performance of non-duality
- Missing that laughter emerges from recognition, not cultivation

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <affected-liberation> (performing freedom), <joy-seeking> (cultivating states), <spontaneity-performance> (acting natural), <recognition-prevention> (performance obscures genuine ease).
