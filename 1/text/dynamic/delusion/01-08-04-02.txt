<temporalization-error> [MOMENTARY CONSCIOUSNESS AS BASIS]
**Misreading:**
The refutation of "consciousness being momentary therefore basis is momentary" is interpreted as establishing that basis is permanent or enduring, as opposed to being timeless.

**Why it arises:**
Binary thinking. If not momentary, must be permanent. Missing the third option of timelessness.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying basis as permanent entity. The practitioner believes basis "lasts" or endures.

**Secondary consequences:**
Eternalistic view; seeking "permanent basis"; confusing timelessness with duration.

**Cascade effects:**
<eternalistic-error> through permanence-reification.
<time-error> through duration-misunderstanding.

<dualistic-error> [EXTERNAL/INTERNAL AS ONTOLOGICAL]
**Misreading:**
The refutation of "basis as external and internal" is interpreted through dualistic lens, seeking a "non-dual basis" that transcends both.

**Why it arises:**
Non-dual fetishism. "Beyond internal/external" sounds like higher view. Seeking metaphysical non-duality.

**Primary consequence:**
Making non-duality into position. The practitioner believes in "non-dual basis" as ontological claim.

**Secondary consequences:**
Non-dual identity; "beyond all distinctions" as view; performative contradiction.

**Cascade effects:**
<view-attachment> through non-dual position.
<performative-contradiction> through asserting transcendence.

<numerical-confusion> [UNITY VS MULTIPLICITY DEBATE]
**Misreading:**
The statement "basis cannot be held as single expanse because it is many" is interpreted as establishing basis as plural or manifold.

**Why it arises:**
Numerical literalism. "Many" suggests multiplicity. Either/or logic (one or many).

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying basis as plural. The practitioner believes there are many bases or basis is manifold.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pluralistic ontology; missing that "many" describes display, not basis-nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through number-fixation.
<view-fragmentation> through multiplicity.

<scriptural-literalism> [SIX EXPANSES CITATION AS AUTHORITY]
**Misreading:**
The citation from Six Expanses (Klong drug) is interpreted as scriptural proof that ends inquiry while avoiding pedagogical pointer.

**Why it arises:**
Authority-dependency. Scriptural citations suggest definitive truth. "Thus it is" sounds final.

**Primary consequence:**
Citation-as-proof. The practitioner believes the text is proven because scripture says so.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fundamentalism; ending inquiry; missing that citation illustrates, not proves.

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through scriptural literalism.
<fundamentalism> through citation-as-proof.

<wisdom-reification> [PRIMORDIAL WISDOM AS ENTITY]
**Misreading:**
The description of primordial wisdom "not established merely as primordial wisdom" is interpreted as establishing a mysterious wisdom-essence beyond all designation.

**Why it arises:**
Essence-seeking. "Not merely wisdom" suggests something deeper. Romantic mysticism.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying primordial wisdom. The practitioner believes there is ineffable wisdom-essence.

**Secondary consequences:**
Wisdom-fetishism; seeking "true primordial wisdom"; ontologizing ye shes.

**Cascade effects:**
<essence-grasping> through wisdom-reification.
<eternalistic-error> through ineffable-essence.

<nihilistic-fear> [FEAR OF EMPTINESS]
**Misreading:**
The refutation of "if nothing exists, samsara/nirvana cannot arise" is interpreted as fear-based defense of existence, rather than demonstrating dependent origination.

**Why it arises:**
Existential anxiety. Fear that emptiness means nothingness. Wanting to preserve meaning.

**Primary consequence:**
Defensive reification. The practitioner clings to existence to avoid nihilism.

**Secondary consequences:**
Grasping at existence; fear of emptiness; missing middle way.

**Cascade effects:**
<eternalistic-error> through fear-of-emptiness.
<fundamental-delusion> through existence-clinging.
