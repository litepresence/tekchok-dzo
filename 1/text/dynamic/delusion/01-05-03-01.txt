[4639-4642] <root-tantra-fetishism> [ROOT TANTRA AS ESSENCE]
**Misreading:**
The "root tantra" (rtsa ba'i rgyud) classification is interpreted as establishing that some tantras are more fundamental or essential than others, creating hierarchy.

**Why it arises:**
Root metaphor suggests foundation. "Root" implies essential vs. non-essential. Botanical literalism.

**Primary consequence:**
Root-elitism. The practitioner believes root tantras are "real" while others are secondary.

**Secondary consequences:**
Tantra-hierarchy; neglecting non-root texts; missing that all point to same nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<textual-hierarchy> through root-privileging.
<essentialism> through fundamentalism.

[4643-4660] <tantra-catalog-obsession> [EIGHTEEN TANTRAS AS CURRICULUM]
**Misreading:**
The enumeration of eighteen tantras (organized by function) is interpreted as establishing a curriculum that must be studied systematically.

**Why it arises:**
Curriculum thinking. Enumeration suggests syllabus. Educational framework.

**Primary consequence:**
Tantra-completionism. The practitioner believes they must study all eighteen.

**Secondary consequences:**
Overwhelm; deferring practice for study; missing that tantras are pointers, not requirements.

**Cascade effects:**
<curriculum-obsession> through enumeration.
<study-paralysis> through completion-requirement.

[4641-4642] <letterless-elitism> [LETTERLESS TANTRA AS HIGHEST]
**Misreading:**
The "letterless tantra" (yi ge med pa'i rgyud) is interpreted as establishing wordless transmission as superior to textual tantras.

**Why it arises:**
Beyond-words mystique. "Letterless" sounds more advanced. Anti-textual bias.

**Primary consequence:**
Text-rejection. The practitioner believes wordless is better than textual.

**Secondary consequences:**
Illiteracy-elitism; guru-dependency; missing that letterless depends on letters.

**Cascade effects:**
<anti-intellectualism> through text-rejection.
<authority-dependency> through guru-only transmission.

[4647-4650] <upadesa-dependency> [INSTRUCTION TANTRAS AS SECRET]
**Misreading:**
The "branch tantras" (yan lag gi rgyud) showing self-perfection and signs are interpreted as esoteric instructions requiring special transmission.

**Why it arises:**
Secrecy mystique. Branch/limb suggests esoteric anatomy. Exclusivity appeal.

**Primary consequence:**
Instruction-fetishism. The practitioner seeks secret pointing-out instructions.

**Secondary consequences:**
Guru-shopping; transmission-elitism; missing that instructions point to what's already present.

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through instruction-seeking.
<esoteric-elitism> through secret-transmission.

[4651-4653] <scriptural-fundamentalism> [THALGYUR AS AUTHORITY]
**Misreading:**
The Thalgyur (Thal 'gyur) tantra as "revealing basis of all pitaka" is interpreted as establishing scriptural authority that supersedes all other texts.

**Why it arises:**
Authority-seeking. "All pitaka basis" suggests supreme authority. Fundamentalist tendency.

**Primary consequence:**
Thalgyur-fundamentalism. The practitioner treats this tantra as absolute authority.

**Secondary consequences:**
Textual literalism; sectarianism; missing that all texts are skillful means.

**Cascade effects:**
<fundamentalism> through textual-authority.
<sectarianism> through supremacy-claims.

[4654-4664] <instruction-accumulation> [FOUR UPADESA AS SET]
**Misreading:**
The four upadeśa tantras (pointing-out, encountering, empowerment, samaya) are interpreted as a set that must all be received for complete transmission.

**Why it arises:**
Set-completion psychology. Four suggests comprehensive set. Collecting mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Upadeśa-collecting. The practitioner tries to receive all four types.

**Secondary consequences:**
Transmission-shopping; missing that one recognition is enough; formalism.

**Cascade effects:**
<accumulation-mindset> through set-completion.
<ritual-formalism> through transmission-collection.

---

[4661-4669] <self-liberation-misunderstanding> [SELF-LIBERATION AS PASSIVE]
**Misreading:**
The "self-liberated" (rang grol) tantras are interpreted as establishing that liberation happens automatically without any engagement.

**Why it arises:**
Passive misinterpretation. "Self-liberated" suggests no effort. Laziness finds confirmation.

**Primary consequence:**
Passive non-practice. The practitioner does nothing believing liberation is automatic.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual lethargy; missing recognition entirely; "already enlightened" complacency.

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-abandonment> through passive-misinterpretation.
<complacency> through auto-liberation-belief.

---

[4670-4688] <tree-metaphor-systematization> [TANTRAS AS TREE PARTS]
**Misreading:**
The metaphors comparing tantras to tree parts (root, leaves, branches, flowers, fruit) are interpreted as establishing a systematic growth model for tantra study.

**Why it arises:**
Organic metaphor literalism. Tree growth suggests development. Natural progression model.

**Primary consequence:**
Developmental fixation. The practitioner believes they grow from root to fruit through tantra study.

**Secondary consequences:**
Progress-tracking by metaphor; deferring "fruit" tantras; missing that metaphors are simultaneous.

**Cascade effects:**
<organic-developmentalism> through growth-metaphor.
<progress-tracking> through tree-stages.
