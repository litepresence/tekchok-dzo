root-delusion: capacity-denial

tibetan-term: rang shar rig pa (self-arising awareness)
critical-misconception: "I cannot recognize because I lack the capacity"

error-chain:
 1. Believing recognition requires special prerequisites
 2. Thinking one must purify before recognition
 3. Assuming recognition is for advanced practitioners only
 4. Waiting for future readiness
 5. Rejecting present awareness as insufficient

cascade-mechanism: |
 The text says "rang shar las" (from self-arising) but the practitioner
 believes self-arising requires preparation. This creates a temporal
 delay where recognition is always postponed to the future. The
 practitioner searches for something other than what is already
 present.

liberation-point: |
 Recognition is not an achievement but the recognition of what
 already is (ye shes dag pa'i rang snang). The capacity is not
 developed but discovered.

root-delusion: outside-seeking

tibetan-term: nor bu rin chen bdud rtsi (precious wish-fulfilling jewel)
critical-misconception: "Recognition must be found outside oneself"

error-chain:
 1. Searching in external teachings
 2. Looking for confirmation from teachers
 3. Seeking experiences
 4. Believing recognition comes from practice
 5. Treating pointing-out as giving something new

cascade-mechanism: |
 Line 8845 states: "byas shing bsgoms pas rnyed mi 'gyur"
 (It cannot be found through doing and meditating). Yet the
 practitioner continues seeking, not understanding that the
 wish-fulfilling jewel is already present.

liberation-point: |
 "btang bzhag med na rnyed pa'i mchog" (Without seeking or
 placing, it is the supreme finding). Recognition is not
 acquisition but non-distraction from what is.

root-delusion: event-based-recognition

tibetan-term: nyams su blangs dus (when applied in experience)
critical-misconception: "Recognition is an event that occurs in time"

error-chain:
 1. Waiting for the moment of recognition
 2. Believing recognition happens once and is complete
 3. Seeking to replicate a past recognition
 4. Treating recognition as attainment
 5. Defining self by having recognized

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8878-8880 describe progressive stages of experience
 (nyams su shar ba), but the practitioner fixates on achieving
 a particular stage. Each progressive description becomes a
 goal while avoiding a description of natural unfolding.

liberation-point: |
 "de nas don la ma yengs na" (Then, without distraction from
 the meaning). Recognition is not an event but the continuity
 of non-distraction (ma yengs).

tibetan-term: rim pas nyams su shar ba (progressively manifest in experience)
critical-misconception: "Recognition has stages that must be completed"

error-chain:
 1. Working through stages methodically
 2. Seeking specific visions
 3. Judging progress by appearance quality
 4. Comparing one's experience to descriptions
 5. Believing completion requires all signs

cascade-mechanism: |
 The text describes mirage-like appearance (smig rgyu lta bur gnas),
 movement/flickering ('gul lam 'phrig pa), and empty bindu
 (thig le stong pa'i sgron ma). The practitioner believes these
 are achievements to be attained , avoiding natural
 descriptions of what unfolds when fixation releases.

liberation-point: |
 "sku yi snang ba de rnams kun, sgyu ma 'ja' tshon ji bzhin pa'o"
 All these kayas' appearances are like illusions and rainbows.
 The appearances are not achievements but natural display.

root-delusion: technique-fixation

tibetan-term: gnad (pith instruction/point)
critical-misconception: "Pointing-out instructions are techniques to apply"

error-chain:
 1. Treating posture instructions literally
 2. Mechanically practicing gaze methods
 3. Controlling prana as technique
 4. Following thigle manipulation
 5. Treating bindu dissolution as goal

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8855-8868 describe sku, ye shes, thigle, 'od, rlung,
 rig pa, dbyings, and snang ba points. The practitioner
 literalizes these as physical techniques in contrast to
 pointing to natural states. The "instruction" is taken
 as something to do description of what is.

liberation-point: |
 "sku mthong dus de rdzogs pa'i gnad gdangs de la mi 'gyur bar blta ba'o"
 When seeing the kaya, the pith is to view the tone without
 alteration. Not a technique but a recognition.

root-delusion: vision-achievement

tibetan-term: sku mthong dus (when seeing the kaya)
critical-misconception: "Pointing-out means seeing specific visions"

error-chain:
 1. Seeking empty form visions
 2. Trying to see thigle
 3. Expecting rainbow lights
 4. Pursuing deity appearances
 5. Believing visions confirm recognition

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8870-8877 describe practical applications of pith
 instructions. The practitioner believes these describe
 visions to be achieved as opposed to natural displays that
 appear when fixation releases. They practice to see rather
 than recognize what is already appearing.

liberation-point: |
 "nang 'od rtsa dangs pa'i me long na, snying ga'i rig pa byad lta bu'i gdangs snang ba de"
 In the mirror of inner clear light channel, that display
 of heart-awareness like a reflection. The vision is the
 natural display, not something to be achieved.

root-delusion: inner-thing

tibetan-term: nang lus kyi 'od rtsa (inner body's light channel)
critical-misconception: "Mind-nature is an inner entity to be found"

error-chain:
 1. Believing awareness is inside the body
 2. Treating channels as containers
 3. Locating rigpa in the heart
 4. Reifying empty forms as things
 5. Believing others cannot see one's visions

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8914-8937 clarify that while the text says visions
 appear "outside," they actually appear internally. The
 practitioner reifies this as meaning there is a real inner
 space with real inner visions. They confuse the metaphor
 of "inner" for a literal location.

liberation-point: |
 "phyi na med par shes la" Know that it does not exist outside.
 Not that it exists inside instead. The display is neither
 inside nor outside - the distinction itself is confusion.

tibetan-term: me long (mirror)
critical-misconception: "Mind is like a mirror that reflects reality"

error-chain:
 1. Believing mind has mirror-like essence
 2. Treating appearances as mirror reflections
 3. Assuming awareness is the mirror
 4. Reifying clear light as substance
 5. Believing obscuration veils a real nature

cascade-mechanism: |
 Line 8934 uses the mirror analogy: "me long la bltas dus byad shar ba ltar"
 Like seeing one's face appear when looking in a mirror.
 The practitioner reifies this, believing there is an actual
 mirror-like mind that reflects actual appearances.

liberation-point: |
 "yul la med kyang nang du mthong ba dmigs pa dag pa'i 'od rtsa'i yon tan gyi cha las shar ba'o"
 Though not in the object, it appears internally - arising
 from the quality of pure perception's light channel.
 Neither subject nor object - appearance without basis.

root-delusion: special-vision-attainment

tibetan-term: ce spyang mo'i mig (fox's eye)
critical-misconception: "I have attained the view because I see without day/night difference"

error-chain:
 1. Believing continuous vision means completion
 2. Pride in seeing self-display
 3. Claiming recognition through comparison
 4. Believing oneself superior
 5. Identifying as Dzogchen practitioner

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8906-8909 use the fox-eye analogy: the fox sees
 equally day and night. The practitioner believes this
 describes their own attainment, taking the metaphor as
 confirmation of their special status rather than than as
 description of natural, uncontrived continuity.

liberation-point: |
 "rang snang dkyil 'khor de bzhin no" One's own self-display
 mandala is like that. Natural, not achieved. The fox-eye
 describes what is, not what has been attained.

tibetan-term: skyes bu shes rab can (person of wisdom)
critical-misconception: "Understanding these teachings makes me a wisdom person"

error-chain:
 1. Pride in intellectual understanding
 2. Believing comprehension equals realization
 3. Claiming Dzogchen birth
 4. Comparing self to realized beings
 5. Thinking one's understanding is sufficient

cascade-mechanism: |
 Line 8939: "tshul 'di ltar go na skyes bu shes rab can rdzogs pa chen po'i klong nas skyes pa zhes bya ste"
 If one understands this method, one is called a person
 of wisdom, born from the expanse of Great Perfection.
 The practitioner takes this as personal validation.

liberation-point: |
 The text describes natural recognition, not status.
 Understanding the mechanism of error is not liberation
 from error. Pride in wisdom is the subtlest obscuration.

root-delusion: dissolution-practice

tibetan-term: rtsal gzhi thim (play-ground dissolution)
critical-misconception: "Spontaneous presence is achieved through dissolution practice"

error-chain:
 1. Practicing dissolution of appearances
 2. Seeking lhungrub as result
 3. Believing wind-mind purification creates spontaneity
 4. Working toward dissolution completion
 5. Waiting for kadag liberation

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8920-8925 describe how when wind-mind are pure,
 lhungrub's appearances are seen within the body, and
 when play-ground dissolves, appearances dissolve into
 ground as kadag liberation. The practitioner treats this
 as a practice to perform rather than than description of
 natural process.

liberation-point: |
 "snang ba de kun 'phel bar snang dus 'phel ba rang mtshan du med la,
 nang du rang log pas 'gribs pa med do"
 When all those appearances appear to increase, increase
 has no self-nature. From self-withdrawal inward,
 there is no decrease. Neither increase nor decrease
 is achieved.

tibetan-term: phyi'i nam mkha' (outer space)
critical-misconception: "Spontaneous presence appears in external space"

error-chain:
 1. Believing space-dharmakaya is outside
 2. Seeking visions in sky-gazing
 3. Treating outer space as container
 4. Confusing appearance with existence
 5. Practicing to see dharmakaya in space

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8926-8937 explain that while texts say visions
 appear in outer space, this is provisional (dgongs te gsungs pa).
 The practitioner literalizes this, practicing sky-gazing
 to see dharmakaya in external space, not understanding
 the metaphor points to inner space.

liberation-point: |
 "rang gis mthong ba ni 'od rtsa dag pa'i gseng las nang du shar ba mthongs khung las nang na nyi ma shar ba'i snang ba mthong ba bzhin no"
 What one sees oneself is like seeing the appearance of
 the sun rising inside, within the window, from the gap
 of pure light channel - appearing internally.

error-chain:
 1. Trying to not be distracted
 2. Monitoring for distraction
 3. Believing non-distraction is a state
 4. Efforting to remain undistracted
 5. Fear of distraction

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8834, 8848, 8851 repeatedly emphasize "ma yengs"
 (without distraction). The practitioner believes this
 is an instruction to effortfully maintain a state of
 non-distraction, creating tension and fixation around
 the very concept of not being distracted.

liberation-point: |
 "'dzin med ngang du bzhag gyur na" If placed in a state
 without fixation. Non-distraction is not maintained
 but is the natural state when fixation releases.

critical-misconception: "Once recognized, I must maintain that recognition"

error-chain:
 1. Believing recognition needs continuity
 2. Trying to hold the recognition
 3. Fear of losing recognition
 4. Checking if still recognized
 5. Defining practice as recognition maintenance

cascade-mechanism: |
 Line 8919: "rang ngo shes nas rang gdangs la sa le bzhag pas"
 Having recognized oneself, placed evenly in self-tone.
 The practitioner interprets this as instruction to
 maintain recognition, not understanding that "placement"
 (bzhag pa) is description, not instruction.

liberation-point: |
 Recognition cannot be maintained because there is no
 one to maintain it and nothing to maintain. The
 "placement" is recognition that there is nothing to
 place. Effort to maintain is the only obstacle.

tibetan-term: lhun grub kyi snang ba (spontaneous presence's appearance)
critical-misconception: "First lhundrup appears, then kadag liberates it"

error-chain:
 1. Believing lhundrup and kadag are sequential
 2. Practicing to manifest appearances
 3. Then dissolving into kadag
 4. Treating them as two aspects to unite
 5. Seeking the union of lhundrup-kadag

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8920-8925 describe how appearances (lhundrup) are
 seen, then dissolve into ground (kadag). The practitioner
 believes this is a two-phase practice: first generate
 lhundrup, then liberate into kadag. This creates a
 fundamental duality where none exists.

liberation-point: |
 "snang ba de kun 'phel bar snang dus 'phel ba rang mtshan du med la,

 When appearances appear to increase, increase has no
 self-nature. From self-withdrawal inward, no decrease.

 3. Seeking return to ground
 4. Believing dissolution is liberation
 5. Maintaining ground-display hierarchy

cascade-mechanism: |
 Line 8923: "slar nub dus gzhi snang gzhi la thim pas ka dag tu grol ba las"
 When dissolving back, ground-display dissolving into
 ground is liberation as kadag. The practitioner believes
 this describes a real dissolution of something into
 something else, not recognizing ground and display
 are never separate.

liberation-point: |
 There is no ground separate from display. No display
 separate from ground. The "dissolution" is recognition
 that they were never two. Kadag is not the result of
 dissolving lhundrup - lhundrup is kadag's display.

error-chain:
 1. Believing self-arising is a type of arising
 2. Waiting for awareness to arise
 3. Believing arising implies existence
 4. Treating self-arising as special arising
 5. Seeking the moment of self-arising

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8831-8838 begin with "rang shar las" (from self-arising).
 The practitioner believes this describes a process where
 awareness arises by itself, not understanding that
 "self-arising" means there is no arising at all - nothing
 arises because nothing is ever non-arisen.

 1. Believing one has the wish-fulfilling jewel
 2. Treating awareness as a possession
 3. Believing the jewel fulfills wishes

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8844-8852 use the wish-fulfilling jewel analogy.
 The practitioner reifies this, believing they possess
 an actual "self-arising awareness" that functions like
 a magic jewel. This creates subtle pride and the belief
 in a special possession that makes one superior.

 1. Believing rigpa is one thing, ye shes another
 2. Seeking to transform rigpa into ye shes
 3. Believing ye shes is the goal
 4. Treating rigpa as preliminary
 5. Seeking the wisdom of awareness

cascade-mechanism: |
 Lines 8834, 8841, 8851 use rigpa and ye shes seemingly
 interchangeably. The practitioner believes these are
 distinct states or levels, creating a hierarchy where
 they must progress from rigpa to ye shes. This creates
 a goal-oriented practice based on misunderstanding.

 The practitioner reifies this as a special type of
 awareness they possess, creating pride in their
 "self-awareness" versus others' lack thereof.

 "rang rig gcig pu grogs kyi mchog" Sole self-awareness,
 supreme companion. Not "my" awareness but awareness
 without subject-object. Not possessed but the nature
 of possession itself.

# LIBERATION SUMMARY
# =============================================================================

<liberation-summary>
source-text: Chapter 20 - Rangshar & Thalgyur Direct Recognition
core-teaching: |
 Recognition is not an achievement but recognition of what is.
 Not inside, not outside. Not to be sought, not to be maintained.
 The wish-fulfilling jewel is present as the nature of seeking.
 Spontaneous presence (lhungrub) and primordial purity (kadag)
 are not two - display and ground are never separate.

key-liberation-points:
 1. btang bzhag med na rnyed pa'i mchog (Without seeking or placing, supreme finding)
 2. 'dzin med ngang du bzhag (Placed in state without fixation)
 3. ma yengs par (Without distraction - not effort but release)
 4. rang sar grol (Self-liberated in its own place)
 5. sgyu ma 'ja' tshon ji bzhin pa (Like illusions, like rainbows)
 6. phyi na med par shes (Know it does not exist outside - nor inside)

ultimate-point: |
 "rang rig gcig pu grogs kyi mchog" - Sole self-awareness, supreme companion.
 The error is believing there is error. The recognition is
 recognizing there is nothing to recognize. The practice is
 releasing the practicer.
