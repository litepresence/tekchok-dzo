[13104-13105] <ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The "jewel house with eight doors" is interpreted as an actual dwelling place or palace to be entered or achieved.

**Why it arises:**
Architectural metaphors trigger literal spatial understanding. The desire for a stable place supports reification.

**Primary consequence:**
The eight doors of spontaneous display (lhun grub) become eight entrances to a palace. The teaching on the eight modes of appearance is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practice becomes about reaching or entering rather than recognizing what already displays. The immanence of realization is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <spatialization error> and [ATTAINMENT ERROR].

[13106-13112] <reification-error> <practice-error>
**Misreading:**
Riding sunbeams, wearing rainbow garments, and carrying crystal spears are understood as actual siddhis or magical powers to be achieved.

**Why it arises:**
Magical imagery triggers siddhi-seeking. The desire for extraordinary powers supports literal reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen's simple recognition is replaced by pursuit of magical abilities. The symbolic language pointing to direct experience becomes goal-oriented practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner becomes distracted by magical thinking. The teaching that the path is recognition, not acquisition, is entirely lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <siddhi-seeking error> and <acquisition-error>.

[13113-13119] <ontological-error> [SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The symbolic correspondences—"Field Broad is samsara," "mud is body, speech, and mind"—are treated as poetic metaphors without technical meaning.

**Why it arises:**
Correspondence lists suggest allegorical reading. The distinction between technical terminology and poetic language is not recognized.

**Primary consequence:**
The precise Dzogchen anatomy being taught is dismissed as poetic fancy. Technical terms become literary devices.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reader remains ignorant of how the narrative encodes instructions for recognizing the bar do. The practical guidance is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <poeticization error> and [TECHNICAL ERROR].

[13120-13126] <epistemic-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The parents sending children to two different realms is interpreted as parental abandonment or bad parenting rather than teaching on the two aspects of appearance.

**Why it arises:**
Family narrative triggers psychological/parenting interpretation. Modern family values influence reading of ancient symbolic text.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching on dbyings snang (expanse appearance) and thig le (sphere) as two modes of rig pa's display is entirely missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reader judges the narrative morally rather than recognizing its technical content. The pointing to the two lamps of bar do instruction is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <moralistic error> and <psychologization-error>.

[13127-13133] [HERMENEUTIC ERROR] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
"Not listening to instructions" is understood as moral failure of disobedience rather than indicating how dull faculties fixate on appearance.

**Why it arises:**
"Not listening" suggests moral fault. Ethical frameworks interpret narrative events as moral lessons.

**Primary consequence:**
The technical teaching about dbang po rtul ba (dull faculties) and fixation on appearance is replaced by moral exhortation to obey.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner develops guilt-based practice rather than understanding cognitive processes. The pointing to habitual fixation patterns is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <moralistic error> and <pedagogical-error>.

[13134-13140] <ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The three messengers (mi gsum) and their journey is understood as literal travel narrative rather than pointing to the three baskets (sde snod gsum) of teachings.

**Why it arises:**
Travel narrative triggers geographical reading. The concrete imagery of journey obscures symbolic reference.

**Primary consequence:**
The three baskets as aspects of the path become a travel story. The integration of scripture, reasoning, and instruction is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner misses how the three baskets serve as supports for recognition. The unity of the three vehicles is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <externalization error> and [FRAGMENTATION ERROR].

[13141-13147] <epistemic-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
"Four lamps" (sgron ma bzhi) are understood as actual light sources or visual phenomena to be cultivated in meditation.

**Why it arises:**
"Lamp" suggests illumination to develop. Meditative visualization practices condition this reading.

**Primary consequence:**
The four modes of intrinsic awareness are reduced to visual experiences. The technical meaning of the four lamps is entirely lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner seeks light experiences rather than recognizing awareness-nature. Dzogchen recognition becomes light-based meditation.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <vision-seeking error> and [EXPERIENTIAL ERROR].

[13148-13155] <ontological-error> [SPATIALIZATION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The "bar do of unarranged appearance" (yul ma bkod par snang ba) is interpreted as an actual intermediate state place between death and rebirth.

**Why it arises:**
"Bar do" commonly refers to after-death state. Popular Buddhist cosmology supports literal spatial interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition that bar do is the nature of present experience is lost. Practice becomes preparation for future death rather than present recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner postpones recognition until death. The teaching that bar do is always displaying is entirely missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <futurization error> and [DEATH-ORIENTED ERROR].

[13156-13163] <reification-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The "jewel house" (rin po che'i khang pa) is understood as actual abode to reach or visualized pure land rather than spontaneous presence (lhun grub).

**Why it arises:**
"House" suggests dwelling place. Pure land visualization practices condition this interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
Spontaneous presence is externalized as destination. The teaching that lhun grub is the display of one's own nature is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practice becomes about reaching a place rather than recognizing what already is. The immanence of realization is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <pure-land externalization error> and [TELEOLOGICAL ERROR].

[13164-13171] [SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The narrative of the five princes being imprisoned is understood as historical-political drama rather than teaching on how the five poisons bind rig pa.

**Why it arises:**
Political narrative triggers historical reading. The imagery of imprisonment suggests social oppression interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
The technical teaching about how afflictions (nyon mongs) bind awareness is replaced by political allegory. Dzogchen anatomy is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reader believes they understand the "meaning" while remaining ignorant of the precise pointing to recognition of affliction's nature.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <politicization error> and [TECHNICAL ERROR].

[13172-13178] <ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
"Old woman" (rgan mo) representing ignorance is understood as misogynistic imagery rather than technical term for co-emergent ignorance.

**Why it arises:**
Gendered imagery triggers gender analysis. Modern sensitivity to sexist language supports this reading.

**Primary consequence:**
The technical Dzogchen term ma rig pa is obscured by gender analysis. The teaching on co-emergent ignorance becomes feminist critique.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reader either dismisses text as sexist or attempts to redeem it through reinterpretation, missing the actual technical content entirely.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <ideological error> and [TECHNICAL ERROR].

[13179-13186] <epistemic-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The "lineage not determined" (rus ma nges pa) is interpreted as social commentary on caste/class rather than teaching on the ground's neutrality.

**Why it arises:**
"Lineage" suggests social hierarchy. Contemporary concerns with social justice support this reading.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that the ground appears for both delusion and liberation is lost. Dzogchen ontology is replaced by social critique.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reader believes they are extracting "deeper meaning" while missing the surface-level technical instruction entirely.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <sociological collapse error> and <ontological-error>.

[13187-13193] [SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR] [MORALISTIC ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The narrative of killing the old woman and eating flesh, drinking blood is understood as literal violence or as endorsement of transgressive behavior.

**Why it arises:**
Violent imagery triggers moral outrage or fascination with transgression. Taboo-breaking suggests antinomian practice.

**Primary consequence:**
The symbolic language pointing to recognition without rejection (spang blang) is either dismissed as barbaric or literalized as license for harmful behavior.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reader either rejects the teaching or adopts harmful practices. The middle way of recognition without acceptance/rejection is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <antinomian error> or [MORALISTIC REJECTION ERROR].

[13194-13201] <ontological-error> <practice-error>
**Misreading:**
"Fire deity" (me lha) is understood as actual deity to be propitiated or visualized rather than symbol for self-recognizing wisdom.

**Why it arises:**
Deity names trigger deity yoga practice. Tantric preliminary training conditions deity-based interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
Self-recognizing wisdom is externalized as deity. The teaching that wisdom arises naturally when ignorance is recognized is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner performs deity yoga rather than direct recognition. The unique Dzogchen approach is replaced by common tantric practice.

**Why it arises:**
Miraculous survival suggests magical power. The desire for protection supports this reading.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that rig pa cannot be harmed by delusion is replaced by belief in magical protection. Ontological safety becomes magical safety.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner seeks magical protection rather than recognition. The imperturbable nature of awareness is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <miracle-seeking error> and <reification-error>.

[13207-13211] <ontological-error> <temporal-error>
**Misreading:**
"First did not depart" suggests that samsara and enlightenment are eternally fixed states with no possibility of change or transformation.

**Why it arises:**
"From the first" suggests eternal pre-existence. Essentialist frameworks interpret this as fixed nature.

**Primary consequence:**
Path and practice become meaningless. "Already enlightened" becomes excuse for non-practice while remaining in delusion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner adopts "nothing to do" stance without recognition. The dynamic of recognition is replaced by static eternalism.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <eternalistic-error> and <practice-error>.

[13212-13216] [HERMENEUTIC ERROR] <practice-error>
**Misreading:**
The king's divination and sending away the queen is interpreted as misogynistic political narrative rather than teaching on how conceptual mind sends away pure awareness.

**Why it arises:**
Political narrative with gendered elements triggers social analysis. The king-queen power dynamic suggests gender critique.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching on rgyu rkyen (cause and condition) and the conceptual mind's relationship to pure awareness is lost. Dzogchen becomes political commentary.

**Primary consequence:**
The twenty-one pointing-out instructions (ngo sprod nyi shu rtsa gcig) are entirely missed. Technical Dzogchen content becomes travel narrative.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner reads the story without receiving the instructions. The practical guidance for bar do recognition is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <narrative absorption error> and <pedagogical-error>.

[13222-13233] <ontological-error> [VIOLENCE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
"Kill all sentient beings" is understood as literal violence or as endorsement of actual killing for spiritual benefit.

**Why it arises:**
Literal reading of violent imagery. Either moral horror or antinomian fascination supports this interpretation.
