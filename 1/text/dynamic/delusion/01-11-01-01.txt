<ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The "jewel house with eight doors" is interpreted as an actual dwelling place or palace to be entered or achieved.

**Why it arises:**
Architectural metaphors trigger literal spatial understanding. The desire for a stable place supports reification.

**Primary consequence:**
The eight doors of spontaneous display (lhun grub) become eight entrances to a palace. The teaching on the eight modes of appearance is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practice becomes about reaching or entering rather than recognizing what already displays. The immanence of realization is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <spatialization error> and [ATTAINMENT ERROR].

<reification-error> <practice-error>
**Misreading:**
Riding sunbeams, wearing rainbow garments, and carrying crystal spears are understood as actual siddhis or magical powers to be achieved.

**Why it arises:**
Magical imagery triggers siddhi-seeking. The desire for extraordinary powers supports literal reading.

**Primary consequence:**

Triggers <siddhi-seeking error> and <acquisition-error>.

<ontological-error> [SYMBOLIC LITERALIZATION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The symbolic correspondences—"Field Broad is samsara," "mud is body, speech, and mind"—are treated as poetic metaphors without technical meaning.

**Why it arises:**
Correspondence lists suggest allegorical reading. The distinction between technical terminology and poetic language is not recognized.

**Primary consequence:**
The precise Dzogchen anatomy being taught is dismissed as poetic fancy. Technical terms become literary devices.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reader remains ignorant of how the narrative encodes instructions for recognizing the bar do. The practical guidance is lost.

Triggers <poeticization error> and [TECHNICAL ERROR].

<epistemic-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The parents sending children to two different realms is interpreted as parental abandonment or bad parenting instead of teaching on the two aspects of appearance.

**Why it arises:**
Family narrative triggers psychological/parenting interpretation. Modern family values influence reading of ancient symbolic text.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching on dbyings snang (expanse appearance) and thig le (sphere) as two modes of rig pa's display is entirely missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reader judges the narrative morally in contrast to recognizing its technical content. The pointing to the two lamps of bar do instruction is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <moralistic error> and <psychologization-error>.

[HERMENEUTIC ERROR] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
"Not listening to instructions" is understood as moral failure of disobedience as opposed to indicating how dull faculties fixate on appearance.

**Why it arises:**
"Not listening" suggests moral fault. Ethical frameworks interpret narrative events as moral lessons.

**Primary consequence:**
The technical teaching about dbang po rtul ba (dull faculties) and fixation on appearance is replaced by moral exhortation to obey.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner develops guilt-based practice rather than understanding cognitive processes. The pointing to habitual fixation patterns is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <moralistic error> and <pedagogical-error>.

<ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The three messengers (mi gsum) and their journey is understood as literal travel narrative in contrast to pointing to the three baskets (sde snod gsum) of teachings.

<ontological-error> [SPATIALIZATION ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The "bar do of unarranged appearance" (yul ma bkod par snang ba) is interpreted as an actual intermediate state place between death and rebirth.

**Why it arises:**
"Bar do" commonly refers to after-death state. Popular Buddhist cosmology supports literal spatial interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
The recognition that bar do is the nature of present experience is lost. Practice becomes preparation for future death rather than present recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner postpones recognition until death. The teaching that bar do is always displaying is entirely missed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <futurization error> and [DEATH-ORIENTED ERROR].

<reification-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
