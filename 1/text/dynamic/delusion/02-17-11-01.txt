<dream-yoga-technique> <rmi-lam-manipulation>
**Misreading:**
Dream yoga (*rmi lam*) instructions interpreted as techniques to control, manipulate, or use dreams for spiritual practice—lucid dreaming as achievement.

**Why it arises:**
"Yoga" suggests technique. Lucid dreaming is popular. Control appeals to ego. Methods promise results.

**Primary consequence:**
Dreams become objects to master. Practitioners try to "stay aware" in dreams, missing that dream and waking are equally empty display.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Lucid dreaming obsession
- Valuing "spiritual" dreams over ordinary
- Failing to recognize that recognition transcends dream/waking

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <dream-control> (manipulating dreams), <lucid-obsession> (staying aware), <experience-seeking> (special dreams), <obscuration> (technique obscures nature).

<bardo-itinerary> <bar-do-travel-guide>
**Misreading:**
Bardo instructions interpreted as post-death travel guide—literal description of what happens after death that one must memorize and navigate.

**Why it arises:**
"Intermediate state" suggests journey. Tibetan Book of Dead popularized this. Fear of death. Wanting control over afterlife.

**Primary consequence:**
Bardo becomes future destination. Practitioners study as "what will happen when I die," creating anxiety. The present moment bardo is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Memorizing bardo stages for future use
- Anxiety about "getting it right" at death
- Overlooking that bardo is this moment's display

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <future-preparation> (waiting for death), <bardo-anxiety> (worrying about journey), <postponement> (I'll practice when dying), <awareness-overlooked> (future obscures present).

---

<illusion-body-reification> <sgyu-lus-substantialism>
**Misreading:**
The "illusory body" (*sgyu lus*) interpreted as actual subtle body created through practice—something to develop and possess.

**Why it arises:**
"Body" suggests entity. "Illusory" sounds magical. Subtle body fascination. Creation appeals to ego.

**Primary consequence:**
Illusory body becomes achievement. Practitioners try to "create" or "manifest" it. The empty nature of all bodies is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Body-building meditation
- Valuing "subtle" over "gross" body
- What's missed: that all form is illusory display

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <subtle-body-obsession> (building light body), <body-hierarchy> (illusory > physical), <creation-ego> (I made this), <ground-ignored> (having obscures emptiness).

---

<light-experience-seeking> <od-gsal-phenomenon>
**Misreading:**
The "clear light" (*od gsal*) interpreted as luminous experience to be cultivated or attained through meditation—visual achievement.

**Why it arises:**
"Light" suggests vision. Near-death experiences describe light. Meditative phenomena include lights. Experience validates practice.

**Primary consequence:**
Clear light becomes goal. Practitioners seek light-experiences. The naturally luminous nature is obscured by seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Light-chasing meditation
- Disappointment without visual phenomena
- Missing that clear light is awareness's nature, not experience

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <light-obsession> (seeking luminosity), <experience-validation> (light = progress), <phenomena-attachment> (clinging to visions), <rigpa-unseen> (seeking obscures presence).

---

<wisdom-sequentialism> <ye-shes-stages>
**Misreading:**
The four wisdoms (manifestation, increase, attainment, complete attainment) interpreted as progressive stages to achieve sequentially.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration suggests progression. "Increase" implies growth. Developmental psychology. Achievement orientation.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom becomes developmental stage. Practitioners try to "reach" each wisdom. The spontaneously present is obscured by progression.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Stage-tracking: "Which wisdom am I at?"
- Believing wisdoms are sequential achievements
- Missing that all four describe one nature

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <stage-obsession> (tracking progress), <sequential-attainment> (achieving levels), <hierarchy-wisdom> (higher is better), <nature-missed> (progress obscures presence).

---

<recognition-pressure> <ngo-she-anxiety>
**Misreading:**
The emphasis on "recognizing" clear light interpreted as pressure to "get it right"—test-like evaluation at moment of death or in meditation.

**Why it arises:**
"Recognize" suggests correct identification. Test anxiety. Fear of failure. Wanting to pass.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes performance anxiety. Practitioners fear "missing" recognition. The natural ease is replaced by pressure.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Test-anxiety about recognition
- Self-judgment: "Did I recognize or not?"
- Missing that recognition is not achievement

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <performance-anxiety> (getting it right), <recognition-doubt> (did I or didn't I), <evaluation-stress> (being tested), <rigpa-unseen> (anxiety obscures ease).

---

<death-bed-practice> <khrid-ka-special-effort>
**Misreading:**
Instructions about death and clear light interpreted as requiring special practice at moment of death—waiting until then to "do" the practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Death" suggests special time. Bardo teachings emphasize death moment. Postponement tendency. Hope for future salvation.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice deferred to deathbed. "I'll recognize when I die" becomes excuse. Present moment availability is ignored.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Waiting for death to practice
- Missing that death happens in every moment
- Future-fixation obscures present recognition

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <postponement> (waiting for death), <future-practice> (then I'll do it), <present-neglect> (not now), <rigpa-unseen> (later obscures now).

---

<intermediate-rebirth> <srid-pa-bar-do-destination>
**Misreading:**
The "bardo of existence" (*srid pa bar do*) interpreted as literal intermediate realm where one can choose or influence next rebirth.

**Why it arises:**
"Intermediate" suggests place. Rebirth narratives describe choices. Wanting control over future. Fear of bad rebirth.

**Primary consequence:**
Bardo becomes literal place. Practitioners try to "navigate" it. The metaphorical nature is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Bardo-navigation techniques
- Anxiety about "choosing" right rebirth
- Missing that bardo describes present confusion

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <navigation-obsession> (steering rebirth), <choice-anxiety> (picking parents), <future-control> (managing next life), <awareness-overlooked> (place obscures process).

---

<deity-yoga-reliance> <yi-dam-skyu-lus-escape>
**Misreading:**
The "illusory body of chosen deity" (*yi dam gyi sgyu lus*) interpreted as requiring specific deity visualization practice for liberation in bardo.

**Why it arises:**
"Deity" suggests worship. "Chosen" implies special relationship. Tantric deity yoga is major practice. Hope for divine aid.

**Primary consequence:**
Deity dependence develops. The error suggests that they need specific deity practice. Self-power is abandoned.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Deity-dependence for liberation
- Anxiety about "having" right deity
- Missing that deity is awareness's display

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <deity-dependence> (need deity to save me), <practice-requirement> (must do deity yoga), <external-salvation> (waiting for rescue), <obscuration> (other-power obscures self-power).

---

<spontaneity-reduction> <lhun-grub-casualness>
**Misreading:**
"Spontaneous presence" (*lhun grub*) reduced to "being casual" or "going with the flow"—lackadaisical attitude mistaken for Dzogchen.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous" suggests casual. "Effortless" sounds easy. New Age "go with flow." Laziness appeals.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes excuse for laziness. "It's all spontaneous" justifies inaction. The dynamic clarity is reduced to passivity.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Whatever" attitude as practice
- Avoiding discipline through Dzogchen rhetoric
- Missing that spontaneity is dynamic, not passive

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <casual-spirituality> (laziness as practice), <avoidance-justification> (Dzogchen as excuse), <passivity-error> (doing nothing), <ground-ignored> (indifference obscures dynamic awareness).

---

<lhungrub-achievement> <spontaneous-accomplishment>
**Misreading:**
Spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) interpreted as achievement state—something that happens when practice succeeds, not inherent nature.

**Why it arises:**
"Presence" suggests state. "Spontaneous" sounds advanced. Achievement culture. Wanting to "have" realization.

**Primary consequence:**
Lhundrub becomes goal. Practitioners try to "reach" spontaneous presence. The already-spontaneous is obscured by seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Trying to "be spontaneous"
- Paradox of effortful spontaneity
- Missing that lhundrub is always already the case

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <spontaneity-goal> (trying to be natural), <effort-paradox> (striving to relax), <achievement-orientation> (reaching lhundrub), <obscuration> (seeking obscures presence).
