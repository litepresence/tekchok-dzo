[MANIFESTATION ERROR] [LIGHT ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18570-18606 describe "wisdom-pervading objects" (yul la khyab pa'i ye shes) as "inner light rays" and their external projection as "appearances of wisdom" with five colors, like sun, firefly, butter lamp, and moon. The reader sees this as describing actual visual phenomena or metaphysical optics.

**Why it arises:**
The detailed phenomenology of light—colors, sources, characteristics—resembles descriptions of visionary experiences. Technical terms like "light rays" (zer), "projection" ('phro ba), "clarity" (gsal ba) suggest physical or energetic phenomena. The specificity invites literal interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
The metaphorical nature of light imagery is completely missed. What describes the clarity, luminosity, and cognizance aspects of awareness becomes literalized as actual visual phenomena to be experienced, cultivated, or interpreted.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may actively seek light experiences—colors, brightness, radiance. They may interpret any visual phenomena in meditation as "wisdom lights." Attachment to specific appearances develops. The natural clarity of ordinary awareness is overlooked in pursuit of special light experiences.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <vision error> where experiences are reified as signs, <chasing light error> where specific phenomena become goals, <interpretation error> where appearances are analyzed, <color error> where five colors are sought, and [LUMINOSITY FIXATION] where brightness is pursued.

<practice-error> [TECHNIQUE ERROR]
**Misreading:**
Lines 18584-18606 mention specific practices: "wisdom arises from the eyes," "gazing upward," "turning the eyeballs upward," "sun and moon union," "gazing at space." The reader reduces Dzogchen to these physical techniques or takes them as essential methods.

**Why it arises:**
The concrete, specific instructions resemble yoga or physical practice. The technical detail suggests these are the actual methods; the surrounding text appears as philosophical explanation. Specificity implies importance.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen is reduced to physical technique—eye positions, gazes, postures. The understanding that these are merely supports for those who need them, skillful means rather than essence, is lost. The techniques become the path itself rather than than supports for recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners may obsess over proper technique—exact eye position, precise gaze, correct duration. They may believe doing the technique "correctly" produces realization. The effortless nature of recognition is obscured by effort to "do it right."

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <technique fixation error> where method replaces recognition, <correct performance error> where doing it "right" becomes goal, <physicalism error> where practice is reduced to body, <duration error> where time spent is measured, and [PERFECTIONISM] where technique is polished.
