[2983-2985] <epistemological-error> [ASPECTS AS EXTERNAL]
**Misreading:**
The analogy of jewel reflection in water is interpreted as teaching that appearances are external objects "out there" like the jewel on the tree, with consciousness merely reflecting them.

**Why it arises:**
Realist reflex. The reflection analogy naturally invites "original vs. copy" interpretation. Western epistemology assumes subject-object structure.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking appearances as external. The practitioner believes appearances point to "real objects" behind them.

**Secondary consequences:**
External-world realism; missing that jewel and reflection are both appearance; consciousness-as-mirror theory.

**Cascade effects:**
<subject-object-dualism> through representational theory.
<fundamental-delusion> through taking appearance as external.

[2986-2988] <doctrinal-confusion> [POSITIONAL DEBATE AS HIERARCHY]
**Misreading:**
The three positions on aspects/consciousness (same number, split like egg, non-dual) are interpreted as hierarchical stages, with non-dual as "highest" view to be adopted.

**Why it arises:**
Dzogchen supremacism. Practitioners assume their tradition's "non-dual" must be superior to "dualistic" Yogācāra positions.

**Primary consequence:**
Adopting position rather than recognizing. The practitioner believes they should hold "aspects and consciousness non-dual" as correct view.

**Secondary consequences:**
Philosophical position-taking; debates about which school is right; missing that all three are pedagogical distinctions.

**Cascade effects:**
<view-attachment> through adopting positions.
<sectarianism> through hierarchical ranking.
