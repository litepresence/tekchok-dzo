<element-dissolution-materialization> <byung-lnga-thim-pa-literalization>

**Misreading:**
The five elements dissolving (*'byung lnga thim pa*) interpreted as actual physical elements literally leaving the body, creating materialistic understanding of death process.

**Why it arises:**
"Dissolving" suggests physical departure. "Elements" implies chemistry. Scientific materialism: "The body is losing its components."

**Primary consequence:**
Physical-death-obsession: monitoring body for signs of elemental departure. Recognition is replaced by somatic cartography.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Is my earth element gone yet?" monitoring
- Not seeing that dissolution is recognition opportunity
- Medicalization of death process

**Cascade effects:**
<element-dissolution-materialization> produces <physical-death-obsession> [somatic monitoring] leads to <element-monitoring> [tracking components] produces <recognition-miss> [dissolution as display]
