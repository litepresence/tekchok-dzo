[13304-13308] <element-dissolution-materialization> <byung-lnga-thim-pa-literalization>

**Misreading:**
The five elements dissolving (*'byung lnga thim pa*) interpreted as actual physical elements literally leaving the body, creating materialistic understanding of death process.

**Why it arises:**
"Dissolving" suggests physical departure. "Elements" implies chemistry. Scientific materialism: "The body is losing its components."
