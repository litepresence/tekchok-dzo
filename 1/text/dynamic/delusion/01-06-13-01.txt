[9518-9525] <ontological-error> [DHARMAKAYA AS ENTITY]
**Misreading:**
The description of Dharmakaya teacher Samantabhadra in dharmadhatu is interpreted as establishing an actual being or person who is the Dharmakaya teacher.

**Why it arises:**
Personification reflex. "Teacher" suggests person. Mythic thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying Dharmakaya as person. The practitioner believes there is a "Samantabhadra being."

**Secondary consequences:**
Theism; praying to Samantabhadra; missing that Dharmakaya is nature, not person.

**Cascade effects:**
<eternalistic-error> through personifying Dharmakaya.
<theism-error> through reifying teacher.

[9520-9528] <ascription-error> [SPONTANEOUSLY COMPLETED AS ATTRIBUTE]
**Misreading:**
"Spontaneously completed Dharmata" is interpreted as establishing Dharmakaya as possessing spontaneous completion as an attribute or quality.

**Why it arises:**
Attribution habit. Descriptions become predicates. Grammar imposes subject-predicate structure.

**Primary consequence:**
Attributing qualities to Dharmakaya. The practitioner believes Dharmakaya "has" spontaneous completion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Substantializing Dharmakaya; quality-fetishism; missing that lhun grub is how Dharmakaya appears.

**Cascade effects:**
<essence-grasping> through attributing qualities.
<ontological-reification> through substantializing.

[9529-9531] <numerical-obsession> [EIGHTFOLD STRUCTURE AS ONTOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The eightfold structure (four empowerment seeds, four results) is interpreted as establishing an eight-part ontology of enlightenment.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration compulsion. "Eight" suggests systematicity. Wanting complete map.

**Primary consequence:**
Eightfold-ontology. The practitioner believes enlightenment has eight components.

**Secondary consequences:**
Component-tracking; missing that eight is pedagogical enumeration.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through number-systematization.
<intellectualism> through component-analysis.

[9532-9548] <cosmological-literalism> [SAMBHOGAKAYA REALM AS LOCATION]
**Misreading:**
The description of Sambhogakaya teacher Vairocana in Ghanavyuha is interpreted as establishing actual location or pure land where Sambhogakaya resides.

**Why it arises:**
Spatial literalism. "Abode" suggests place. Pure land mythology.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying Sambhogakaya realm. The practitioner believes there is a literal "Ghanavyuha" location.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pure land aspiration; cosmological speculation; missing that realm is display of awareness.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through spatializing kayas.
<pure-land-fetishism> through realm-literalism.

[9544-9548] <ray-mechanism> [LIGHT RAYS AS CAUSAL]
**Misreading:**
The description of light rays entering secret place and emerging into space is interpreted as establishing causal mechanism of manifestation.

**Why it arises:**
Physical optics projection. "Rays" suggests light physics. Mechanistic thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Making manifestation optical. The practitioner believes light rays literally cause emanation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Physics-of-manifestation speculation; missing that rays are metaphor for display.

**Cascade effects:**
<mechanistic-thinking> through optical literalism.
<scientism-error> through physics-projection.

[9549-9557] <nirmanakaya-anthropomorphism> [NIRMANAKAYA AS HISTORICAL]
**Misreading:**
The description of Nirmanakaya teacher Vajradhara in Tuṣita is interpreted as establishing historical or actual incarnation of Buddha.

**Why it arises:**
Historical literalism. "Teacher" suggests person. Wanting "real" Buddha.

**Primary consequence:**
Literalizing Nirmanakaya. The practitioner believes Nirmanakaya is actual historical teacher.

**Secondary consequences:**
Historical Buddha-obsession; dismissing other kayas; missing that all three are simultaneous aspects.

**Cascade effects:**
<historical-literalism> through reifying Nirmanakaya.
<kaya-hierarchy> through privileging historical.

---

[9552-9557] <world-system-literalism> [COSMOLOGY AS GEOGRAPHY]
**Misreading:**
The cosmological description (four continents, Mt. Meru, billion worlds) is interpreted as establishing literal physical geography of universe.

**Why it arises:**
Cartographic thinking. Cosmological descriptions invite literalization. Pre-scientific cosmology seems factual.

**Primary consequence:**
Literal cosmology. The practitioner believes Buddhist cosmology is physical description.

**Secondary consequences:**
Science-conflict; cosmological defense; missing that cosmology is pedagogical, not geographical.

**Cascade effects:**
<fundamentalism> through cosmological literalism.
<science-conflict> through geographical claims.
