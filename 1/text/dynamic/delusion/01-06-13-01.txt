[9518-9519] [VIEW ERROR] [VISIONARY OBSESSION]
**Misreading:**
Reader adopts Thogyal - self-existing awareness as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Thogyal - self-existing awareness is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Conceptual pride replaces genuine recognition. Debates about positions poison communities. The intellect is fetishized over wisdom.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <ground-path-fruition temporalization>. View becomes position rather than recognition.

[9520-9528] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [STAGE HIERARCHY]
**Misreading:**
Reader interprets Thogyal - self-existing awareness through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.

**Why it arises:**
Linear time consciousness and developmental psychology impose sequential frameworks. The fear of missing steps drives temporal sequencing.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Thogyal - self-existing awareness is timeless, never unfolding, is entirely lost. Time-based becoming replaces timeless presence.

**Secondary consequences:**
The present moment is perpetually sacrificed to future attainment. Practice becomes preparation rather than recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers all error types. The entire framework collapses into temporal development model.

[9529-9537] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [DEVELOPMENTAL MODEL]
**Misreading:**
Reader understands Thogyal - self-existing awareness as a stage in a developmental sequence, deferring completion until prerequisites are met.

**Why it arises:**
Achievement-oriented psychology and hierarchical social structures impose staircase models. The desire for measurable advancement supports stage-fixation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Thogyal - self-existing awareness is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.

**Secondary consequences:**
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <experience substantialism>. Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.
