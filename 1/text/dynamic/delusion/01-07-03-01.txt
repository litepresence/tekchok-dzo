[9990-10004] <mantra-mechanism> [MANTRA RECITATION AS AUTOMATIC]
**Misreading:**
The consequences of false speech despite mantra recitation are interpreted as establishing that mantra only works if speech is pure, creating anxiety about speech-purity requirements.

**Why it arises:**
Purity anxiety. Fear that impurity invalidates practice. Conditional causation thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Speech-monitoring obsession. The practitioner constantly checks if speech is "pure enough."

**Secondary consequences:**
Performance anxiety; purification rituals; missing that recognition matters more than speech-monitoring.

**Cascade effects:**
<ritual-obsession> through purity-requirement.
<performance-anxiety> through constant monitoring.

[10005-10026] <karmic-literalism> [HELL REALMS AS GEOGRAPHY]
**Misreading:**
The descriptions of rebirth in hell realms after death are interpreted as establishing literal geographical locations where beings physically go.

**Why it arises:**
Spatial literalism. "Go to hell" suggests location. Pre-modern cosmology.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying hells as places. The practitioner believes there are actual hell locations.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fear of literal destinations; missing that hell is state of mind; cosmological literalism.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through spatializing states.
<fundamentalism> through literal cosmology.

[10027-10039] <triplicity-obsession> [OUTER/INNER/SECRET AS HIERARCHY]
**Misreading:**
The threefold classification of speech commitments (outer: teaching, inner: practice, secret: meditation) is interpreted as hierarchy, with "secret" as highest.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking. "Secret" suggests esoteric superiority. Triadic structures invite ranking.

**Primary consequence:**
Secret-elitism. The practitioner believes "secret" speech is most important or advanced.

**Secondary consequences:**
Neglecting outer/inner; premature "secret" focus; missing that three describe aspects, not levels.

**Cascade effects:**
<elitism-error> through hierarchical ranking.
<practice-path-confusion> through premature advancement.

[10040-10082] <guru-worship-pathology> [NEVER CRITICIZING GURU]
**Misreading:**
The strict prohibition against criticizing guru is interpreted as absolute requirement to never question or evaluate teacher's behavior, enabling abuse.

**Why it arises:**
Authority-dependency. "Guru is Buddha" literalism. Fear of hell for criticism.

**Primary consequence:**
Abuse-enabling. The practitioner cannot leave harmful teacher or question misconduct.

**Secondary consequences:**
Cult dynamics; exploitation; psychological harm; missing that guru-devotion requires discernment.

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through absolute submission.
<abuse-vulnerability> through prohibition on discernment.

[10059-10082] <karmic-calculus> [MULTIPLIED KARMA AS ACCOUNTING]
**Misreading:**
The descriptions of karma being multiplied (twofold, thousandfold) for criticizing guru is interpreted as literal quantitative accounting system.

**Why it arises:**
Quantitative thinking. Numbers suggest calculability. Justice-framework desires fairness.

**Primary consequence:**
Karmic-accounting. The practitioner believes karma can be calculated and multiplied.

**Secondary consequences:**
Karmic-anxiety; mathematical obsession; missing that multiplication is rhetorical, not arithmetic.

**Cascade effects:**
<magical-thinking> through karmic-arithmetic.
<anxiety-amplification> through quantitative fear.

[10083-10085] <enumerative-fetishism> [NINE COMMITMENTS AS CHECKLIST]
**Misreading:**
The enumeration of nine speech commitments is interpreted as checklist to complete, with completion ensuring safety.

**Why it arises:**
Checklist mentality. Enumeration invites completion. Desire for security through compliance.

**Primary consequence:**
Commitment-checking. The practitioner obsessively monitors all nine.

**Secondary consequences:**
Anxiety about missing one; formalism over substance; missing that samaya is recognition, not compliance.

**Cascade effects:**
<ritual-formalism> through checklist-obsession.
<performance-anxiety> through monitoring-requirement.
