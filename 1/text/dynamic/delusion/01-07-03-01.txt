[9990-9994] [VIEW ERROR] [CLARITY FETISHISM]
**Misreading:**
Reader adopts Ground - spontaneous presence vs primordial purity as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Ground - spontaneous presence vs primordial purity is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Conceptual pride replaces genuine recognition. Debates about positions poison communities. The intellect is fetishized over wisdom.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <ground-path-fruition temporalization>. View becomes position rather than recognition.

[9995-10002] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [ATTAINMENT SHOPPING]
**Misreading:**
Reader seeks Ground - spontaneous presence vs primordial purity as a specific experience to be achieved and maintained, treating it as a goal to reach.

**Why it arises:**
Sensation-seeking psychology and peak-experience culture project onto spiritual practice. The desire for verifiable attainments supports experience-fetishism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Ground - spontaneous presence vs primordial purity is natural expression, not goal to achieve, is entirely abandoned. Seeking replaces finding.

**Secondary consequences:**
Experience-chasing leads to technique-switching and teacher-shopping. Disappointment when experiences fade leads to abandonment.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <progress tracking>. Subsequent experiences will be approached as achievements to collect.

[10003-10010] <practice-error> [PAST FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
Reader treats Ground - spontaneous presence vs primordial purity as a technique to be mastered through repeated application, believing that correct execution automatically produces realization.

**Why it arises:**
Skill-acquisition models from education and training unconsciously impose technique-mastery frameworks. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports mechanism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Ground - spontaneous presence vs primordial purity is recognition, not technique, is entirely lost. Practice becomes doing rather than being.

**Secondary consequences:**
Technique accumulation replaces wisdom cultivation. Practitioners collect methods while missing the view that animates them. Practice becomes performance.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <progress tracking> and [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. All practice becomes technique-accumulation.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page discusses Ground - spontaneous presence vs primordial purity. Preceding page (233) established errors that carry forward—practitioners will approach this content through already-deluded lenses. Following pages (235+) contain related material that will be misunderstood through the cascade effects established here.

[10011-10034] <practice-error> [MEDITATION FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
Reader treats Ground - essence, nature, capacity as a technique to be mastered through repeated application, believing that correct execution automatically produces realization.

**Why it arises:**
Skill-acquisition models from education and training unconsciously impose technique-mastery frameworks. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports mechanism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Ground - essence, nature, capacity is recognition, not technique, is entirely lost. Practice becomes doing rather than being.

**Secondary consequences:**

[10059-10082] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [EMPTINESS NIHILISM]
**Misreading:**
Reader seeks Ground - essence, nature, capacity as a specific experience to be achieved and maintained, treating it as a goal to reach.

**Why it arises:**
Sensation-seeking psychology and peak-experience culture project onto spiritual practice. The desire for verifiable attainments supports experience-fetishism.

**Primary consequence:**

[10083-10085] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [LEVEL COMPARISON]
**Misreading:**
Reader understands Ground - essence, nature, capacity as a stage in a developmental sequence, deferring completion until prerequisites are met.

**Why it arises:**
Achievement-oriented psychology and hierarchical social structures impose staircase models. The desire for measurable advancement supports stage-fixation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Ground - essence, nature, capacity is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.

**Secondary consequences:**
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <experience substantialism>. Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.
