[3870-3876] <epistemic-error>
**Misreading:**
The description of dharmatā as "without letters" (yi ge med pa) and "beyond expression" is interpreted as pointing to a mysterious, transcendent truth that cannot be captured in language—inviting esoteric attitude toward the ineffable.

**Why it arises:**
Romanticism of mystery. "Beyond words" suggests something word-concepts cannot touch, creating mystique. Apophatic theology tradition supports ineffability-fetish.

**Primary consequence:**
Making truth esoteric. The practitioner believes ultimate reality is secret, requiring special transmission outside words.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dismissing conceptual understanding; guru-dependency for "ineffable pointing"; elitism about those who "know beyond words."

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through esoteric transmission.
<hierarchical-error> through ineffability-superiority.

[3877-3882] <causal-error>
**Misreading:**
The phrase "three kayas appearing on the path" is interpreted as describing progressive manifestation of kayas through practice stages, with full appearance at result.

**Why it arises:**
Path-result sequencing. "On the path" suggests journey. "Result arising" implies final achievement.

**Primary consequence:**
Chronologizing kayas. The practitioner believes kayas manifest gradually through practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring kaya-recognition to future; seeking "appearance" of kayas; missing that kayas are how things already are.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through sequential model.
<meditationism-error> through practice-for-results.

[3883-3887] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The two types of oral transmission (abandoned to distraction vs. timeless encounter) are interpreted as hierarchy, with "timeless struck in the head" as superior method.

**Why it arises:**
Dzogchen exceptionalism. "Timeless" sounds more profound than "abandoned." Practitioners assume pointing-out is superior to systematic teaching.

**Primary consequence:**
Seeking dramatic transmission. The practitioner waits for "struck in the head" moment, dismissing gradual instruction.

**Secondary consequences:**
Impatience with study; seeking "direct pointing" without foundation; rejecting oral transmission as "abandoned to dullness."

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through seeking dramatic guru-moment.
<practice-path-confusion> through rejecting systematic approach.
