[10775-10781] <polemical-error> [DISPUTE-RESOLUTION AS PHILOSOPHICAL VICTORY]
**Misreading:**
The dispute-resolution format is interpreted as establishing Dzogchen view through philosophical debate victory, making intellectual refutation the path to understanding.

**Why it arises:**
Dialectical habit. Dispute/response format suggests debate. Tibetan scholastic tradition emphasizes philosophical defense.

**Primary consequence:**
Debate-skill substitution. The practitioner believes winning arguments establishes view, rather than direct recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Intellectual combat; debate-club Dzogchen; missing that disputes are pedagogical devices, not truth-establishment.

**Cascade effects:**
<intellectualism> through debate-focus.
<view-attachment> through position-defense.

[10777-10778] <numerical-obsession> [EIGHT BASES AS PROBLEM]
**Misreading:**
The concern about "eighth ground" is interpreted as establishing numerical precision as doctrinally important, inviting metaphysical speculation about how many "bases" exist.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration compulsion. Number disputes suggest numerical precision matters. Wanting "correct" ontology.

**Primary consequence:**
Number-fetishism. The practitioner worries about whether there are seven, eight, or nine bases as if this were crucial.

**Secondary consequences:**
Metaphysical speculation; missing that numbers are pedagogical tools, not metaphysical claims.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through number-fixation.
<scholastic-hairsplitting> through enumeration-debates.
