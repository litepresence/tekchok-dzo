[10775-10779] [VIEW ERROR] [PHILOSOPHICAL FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
Reader adopts Completion - signs and indications error as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Completion - signs and indications error is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Conceptual pride replaces genuine recognition. Debates about positions poison communities. The intellect is fetishized over wisdom.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <ground-path-fruition temporalization>. View becomes position rather than recognition.

[10780-10781] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [EMPTINESS NIHILISM]
**Misreading:**
Reader seeks Completion - signs and indications error as a specific experience to be achieved and maintained, treating it as a goal to reach.

**Why it arises:**
Sensation-seeking psychology and peak-experience culture project onto spiritual practice. The desire for verifiable attainments supports experience-fetishism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Completion - signs and indications error is natural expression, not goal to achieve, is entirely abandoned. Seeking replaces finding.

**Secondary consequences:**
Experience-chasing leads to technique-switching and teacher-shopping. Disappointment when experiences fade leads to abandonment.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <progress tracking>. Subsequent experiences will be approached as achievements to collect.
