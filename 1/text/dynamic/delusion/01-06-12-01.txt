[9015-9019] <empowerment-accumulation> [ELABORATE EMPOWERMENTS AS CHECKLIST]
**Misreading:**
The elaborate outer empowerments (tooth-stick, mandala offering, protection cord, dream divination) are interpreted as establishing a checklist of requirements to complete.

**Why it arises:**
List-compulsion. Four items suggest completeness. Fear of missing empowerment elements.

**Primary consequence:**
Empowerment-checking. The practitioner believes they must receive all elaborate outer empowerments.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ritual-accumulation; missing that all point to same recognition; formalism.

**Cascade effects:**
<ritual-formalism> through checklist-completion.
<empowerment-shopping> through accumulation.

[9020-9033] <unelaborate-confusion> [WASHING/SOLICITING AS MECHANICAL]
**Misreading:**
The unelaborate empowerments (washing, soliciting, vajra summoning) are interpreted as mechanical procedures that automatically confer empowerment.

**Why it arises:**
Procedure literalism. Actions suggest causation. Ritual mechanics.

**Primary consequence:**
Procedure-obsession. The practitioner believes performing actions causes empowerment.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing recognition aspect; ritual performance; externalizing transmission.

**Cascade effects:**
<ritual-mechanism> through procedure-causality.
<externalization> through action-dependence.

[9023-9026] <oath-magic> [SAMAYA OATHS AS BINDING CONTRACTS]
**Misreading:**
The four samaya oaths (renouncing samsara, accepting nirvana, not abandoning beings, etc.) are interpreted as binding magical contracts with automatic punitive consequences.

**Why it arises:**
Contractual thinking. Oaths suggest binding. Fear of consequences.

**Primary consequence:**
Oath-anxiety. The practitioner fears breaking samaya as contract-violation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Paralysis; guilt; missing that samaya is recognition, not contract.

**Cascade effects:**
<anxiety-amplification> through contract-fear.
<guilt-complex> through oath-breaking.

[9027-9042] <mandala-entry-fetishism> [ENTERING MANDALA AS INITIATION]
**Misreading:**
The "entering mandala" (dkyil 'khor du 'jug pa) is interpreted as establishing a literal spatial initiation rite required for practice authorization.

**Why it arises:**
Spatial literalism. "Entering" suggests physical space. Initiation mystique.

**Primary consequence:**
Mandala-entry dependency. The practitioner believes they must physically enter mandala.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ritual-geography; missing that mandala is perceptual frame; spatial fixation.

**Cascade effects:**
<spatial-reification> through mandala-literalism.
<initiation-dependency> through entry-requirement.

[9034-9047] <sravaka-mandala-confusion> [HINAYANA EMPOWERMENT AS REAL]
**Misreading:**
The description of sravaka (hearer) mandala entry is interpreted as establishing that even Hinayana practitioners receive tantric empowerments.

**Why it arises:**
Inclusivity desire. Universal empowerment seems fair. Misunderstanding of vehicles.

**Primary consequence:**
Vehicle-conflation. The practitioner believes all vehicles have same empowerments.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing vehicle distinctions; universalism; inappropriate practice.

**Cascade effects:**
<vehicle-confusion> through universal-empowerment.
<inappropriate-practice> through vehicle-mixing.

---

[9048-9056] <kriya-upa-yoga-enumeration> [27 EMPOWERMENTS AS REQUIREMENTS]
**Misreading:**
The enumeration of 27 empowerments across Kriya, Upa, and Yoga tantras is interpreted as establishing requirements that must all be received.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration compulsion. 27 suggests comprehensiveness. Completionist mindset.

**Primary consequence:**
Empowerment-overwhelm. The practitioner believes they need all 27.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferral; accumulation-obsession; missing that all point to single recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<accumulation-mindset> through enumeration.
<empowerment-paralysis> through 27-requirement.

---

[9057-9069] <twelve-empowerment-hierarchy> [MAHA EMPOWERMENTS AS SUPERIOR]
**Misreading:**
The twelve Maha yoga empowerments are interpreted as establishing superiority over the 27 lesser vehicle empowerments.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking. Twelve sounds more complete than 27. Maha superiority.

**Primary consequence:**
Empowerment-elitism. The practitioner seeks Maha empowerments as "higher."

**Secondary consequences:**
Vehicle-skipping; premature Maha practice; missing appropriate method.

**Cascade effects:**
<vehicle-hierarchy-elitism> through empowerment-ranking.
<premature-practice> through Maha-seeking.

---

[9070-9074] <anu-skillful-means> [ANU YOGA AS ADVANCED TECHNIQUE]
**Misreading:**
The Anu yoga empowerments (symbolic certainty, breath release, mudra transformation) are interpreted as advanced techniques requiring mastery of preliminary empowerments.

**Why it arises:**
Progressive skill model. "Anu" suggests refined. Technique-mastery framework.

**Primary consequence:**
Technique-deferral. The practitioner believes they must master preliminaries first.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring Anu; technique-accumulation; missing that Anu is recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<preparation-paralysis> through prerequisite-obsession.
<technique-fetishism> through skill-mastery.
