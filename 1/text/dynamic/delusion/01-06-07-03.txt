[8724-8728] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [SYMBOL ACCUMULATION]
**Misreading:**
The generation of lotus (E), bell (Hrīḥ), and pistil (Ha) is interpreted as building up complex visualizations piece by piece, with each component adding to the final accomplishment.

**Why it arises:**
Architectural construction metaphors project onto visualization. The additive language ("generating," "building") suggests accumulation mechanics. Desire for impressive, detailed visualizations supports complexity-obsession.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that all symbols are simultaneously present as the display of awareness is lost. Practice becomes visualization-construction project rather than recognition of what already is.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners spend years "perfecting" visualizations without recognizing their nature. Pride in complexity replaces simplicity of recognition. The symbol is fetishized over the symbolized.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <view error>. Subsequent pages on deity yoga will be approached as construction projects rather than recognition practices.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page contains subtle body posture and syllable practices. Preceding pages established ritual mechanism errors that carry forward—practitioners will combine mantra-mechanism with posture-fixation. Following pages (204+) discuss empowerment processes that will be misunderstood through lens of mechanical efficacy.

[8729-8738] <practice-error> [EMPOWERMENT TRANSACTION]
**Misreading:**
The four empowerments are understood as transactions where something is transferred from guru to disciple, like a license or certification that authorizes subsequent practice.

**Why it arises:**
Legal-institutional frameworks project onto transmission. The language of "receiving" and "bestowal" suggests property transfer. The desire for authorized status supports transactional interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that empowerment is recognition of one's own nature is entirely lost. Guru becomes external granter, disciple becomes dependent recipient. Self-sufficiency is abandoned for dependency.

**Secondary consequences:**
Lineage shopping and empowerment collecting replace practice. Guru devotion degenerates into credential-seeking. The pointing-out instruction is missed while the ritual is obsessively documented.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <ground-path-fruition temporalization>. Subsequent pages on empowerment stages will be misread as progressive authorization levels.

[8739-8749] [VIEW ERROR] [VASE SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The vase empowerment (bum dbang) is interpreted as literally purifying the physical body through contact with blessed water, like a spiritual cleansing or baptism.

**Why it arises:**
Purification-through-contact frameworks project from other religions. The physicality of the vase and water suggests material purification. Desire for tangible spiritual cleansing supports literalism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that vase empowerment introduces the nature of mind as empty-yet-lucid is entirely obscured. Water-touch is mistaken for wisdom-transmission.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners obsess over water quality, vase materials, and ritual purity while neglecting recognition. External cleanliness replaces internal realization. The symbolic becomes the substantial.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <experience substantialism>. Subsequent empowerments will be approached as accumulative purifications rather than progressive recognitions.

[8750-8759] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [SECRET SUBSTANCE]
**Misreading:**
The secret empowerment (gsang dbang) involving bodhicitta is understood as physical substance transmission with automatic efficacy, like receiving a transfusion of spiritual material.

**Why it arises:**
Substance-exchange frameworks project onto tantric practice. The physiological nature of bodhicitta suggests material transfer. Taboo reinforces belief in hidden power.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that secret empowerment introduces the union of bliss-emptiness is entirely lost. Substance-contact is mistaken for wisdom-transmission.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek substances while neglecting recognition. Health risks arise from improper substance handling. Consent violations occur under guise of "empowerment." The wisdom dimension is reduced to chemistry.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <practice-error> and [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on subtle body will be approached as substance-manipulation.

[8760-8769] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [WISDOM SEQUENCING]
**Misreading:**
The wisdom-prajna empowerment (shes rab ye shes dbang) and word empowerment (tshig dbang) are interpreted as advanced stages requiring preparation through previous empowerments, forming a temporal curriculum.

**Why it arises:**
Educational progression models impose sequential learning frameworks. The numerical ordering suggests prerequisite structure. Fear of "incomplete foundation" drives deferral.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that all four empowerments are simultaneous aspects of single recognition is entirely lost. The highest empowerment is deferred indefinitely while lower ones are obsessively repeated.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners accumulate empowerments like academic degrees without recognizing their nature. Elitist hierarchies form around empowerment-status. The simplicity of direct introduction is abandoned for complexity.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers all error types. Trekcho/thogyal will be approached as advanced curriculum rather than direct recognition.
