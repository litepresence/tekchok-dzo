**Misreading:**
"Speech is three syllables" is interpreted as establishing that the essence of speech is reducible to three fundamental sounds (OM AH HUM) that are the building blocks of all expression.

**Why it arises:**
Atomistic thinking. "Three syllables" suggests basic units. Mantra fundamentalism.

**Primary consequence:**
Sound-essentialism. The practitioner believes all speech is composed of these three syllables.

**Secondary consequences:**
Mantra-magic; syllable-obsession; missing that "three syllables" points to body-speech-mind, not phonemes.

**Cascade effects:**
<essentialism> through sound-atomism.
<mantra-fetishism> through syllable-power.

**Misreading:**
The description of substance transmission ("fall into the student's mouth," "drink at the mouth") is interpreted as literal physical substance transfer required for empowerment.

**Why it arises:**
Literal somatic reading. Physical description invites materialism. Taboo reinforces sense of hidden power.

**Primary consequence:**
Physical transmission dependency. The practitioner believes empowerment requires literal substance ingestion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Health risks; ritual literalism; missing symbolic dimensions.

**Cascade effects:**
<magical-thinking> through substance-causality.
<somatic-reductionism> through physical literalism.

**Misreading:**
The "mute's dream" experience (where whatever is spoken is not known) is interpreted as a special meditative state to be achieved.

**Why it arises:**
Experience-seeking. "Mute's dream" sounds like mystical state. Wanting non-conceptual experience.

**Primary consequence:**
State-seeking. The practitioner tries to achieve "mute's dream" experience.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dissociation; dullness mistaken for non-conceptuality; missing that it's description, not prescription.

**Cascade effects:**
<experience-substantialism> through state-seeking.
<meditationism-error> through goal-achievement.

**Misreading:**
The list of animal parts (dog eye, jackal eye, owl, bat, crow wing) is interpreted as magical ingredients required for practice.

**Why it arises:**
Ingredient-list literalism. Animal parts suggest sympathetic magic. Shamanic associations.

**Primary consequence:**
Ingredient-obsession. The practitioner believes these specific animal parts are necessary.

**Secondary consequences:**
Animal harm; procurement difficulties; missing symbolic meaning (clear vision, etc.).

**Cascade effects:**
<magical-thinking> through ingredient-causality.
<ritual-obsession> through component-requirement.

[8751-8753] <externalization-error>
**Misreading:**
The instruction to give gifts ("gold and so forth") to the Mudrā is interpreted as transactional payment for services rendered.

**Why it arises:**
Commodity exchange mindset. Gifts suggest payment. Professional service model.

**Primary consequence:**
Commercialization. The practitioner treats empowerment as service to be purchased.

**Secondary consequences:**
Exploitation; commercial sex work dynamics; missing that "gifts" express gratitude, not payment.

**Cascade effects:**
<transactional-mindset> through payment-for-practice.
<exploitation-risk> through commodification.
