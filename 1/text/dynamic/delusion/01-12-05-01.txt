<practice-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The description of winds transforming into disease when elements conflict (fire wind causing bile disease, etc.) describes actual pathophysiology requiring medical intervention to restore elemental harmony.

**Why it arises:**
The disease causation language suggests medical pathology. Medical frameworks naturally interpret these as descriptions of actual illness mechanisms.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes elemental medicine. The practitioner approaches wind imbalances as medical conditions requiring treatment-based transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Medicalization of spiritual practice. The practitioner treats spiritual obstacles as elemental disorders to be healed , avoiding recognized.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [PATHOLOGY OBSESSION] disease framework, [ELEMENTAL MEDICINE] treating imbalance, and [THERAPEUTIC REDUCTION] healing replacing liberation. The error reduces Dzogchen to clinic.

<ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The description of earth wind generating flesh, water wind generating blood, etc., describes actual embryological and physiological processes by which elements literally construct the physical body.

**Why it arises:**
The generative language ("generates," "produces") suggests biological causation. Scientific materialism interprets these as literal developmental biology.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen embryology becomes literal biology. The practitioner believes elements actually build the body through wind-mediated processes.

**Secondary consequences:**
Materialism obscures symbolic dimension. The profound presentation of body as elemental manifestation is reduced to physicalist explanation.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [EMBRYOLOGICAL MATERIALISM] literal biology, [DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANICS] construction process, and [BODY BUILDING] elements as builders. The error reduces body to machine.

<scholarly-collapse-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The elaborate calculations of wind movements (21,600 breaths per day, etc.) and their relationship to time measurements constitute a precise temporal science that should be studied and applied mathematically.

**Why it arises:**
The mathematical precision suggests scientific quantification. Academic training values such systematic calculations as rigorous knowledge.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes temporal mathematics. The practitioner focuses on calculations and measurements rather timeless recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Quantification obsession develops. The practitioner becomes fixated on counting and measuring rather direct experience.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [MATHEMATICAL OBSESSION] counting everything, [TEMPORAL QUANTIFICATION] time as numbers, and [CALCULATION ADDICTION] measuring over experiencing. The error reduces timelessness to clock.

[PRACTICE ACCUMULATION] <meditationism-error>
**Misreading:**
The different wind types (earth, water, fire, air) each require specific practices to master—practitioners should learn multiple techniques to address each elemental wind, building comprehensive skill set.

**Why it arises:**
The elemental diversity suggests technique variety. Educational frameworks encourage accumulating methods to cover all aspects.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes elemental technique collection. The practitioner amasses earth-wind practices, water-wind practices, etc., believing comprehensive coverage produces realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Technique proliferation obscures view. The practitioner jumps between elemental practices, mastering execution without recognizing that all winds are equally empty of inherent nature. Quantity of techniques replaces quality of recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [TECHNIQUE PROLIFERATION] accumulating methods, [ELEMENTAL COVERAGE] comprehensive approach, and [SKILL DISPERSAL] scattered attention. The error obscures single recognition.

[REALM PROJECTION] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The elemental winds create and sustain actual realms—earth wind builds the physical structure of the hell realms, water wind sustains preta existence, etc.—literal construction forces that build real locations.

**Why it arises:**
The generative language suggests actual creation. Cosmological frameworks encourage belief in elemental construction of world-systems.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen cosmology becomes literal architecture. The practitioner believes winds literally construct realm-realities, missing that realms are experiential modalities without independent existence.

**Secondary consequences:**
Externalization of mind develops. The practitioner projects realm-creation outward, believing worlds exist independently constructed by winds, and not recognizing realms as mind's display.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [COSMIC ARCHITECTURE] building worlds, [CONSTRUCTION ONTOLOGY] wind as builder, and [EXTERNALIZED CREATION] outside mind. The error reduces display to construction site.

- PAGE 372: Cosmological correlations, two winds (connected)

<ontological-error> <eternalistic-error>
**Misreading:**
The correlation between sun's movement and breath count variations describes actual cosmological mechanics where celestial movements literally affect human respiration through energetic connections.

**Why it arises:**
The astronomical correlations suggest cosmic mechanics. Astrological frameworks encourage belief in celestial-terrestrial causation.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes astrological determinism. The practitioner believes celestial movements mechanically control human energies.

**Secondary consequences:**
External dependence replaces inner recognition. The practitioner looks to external celestial conditions , avoiding recognizing inner nature.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [ASTROLOGICAL DETERMINISM] stars control breath, [CELESTIAL DEPENDENCY] looking upward, and [COSMIC OBSESSION] external causation. The error creates subservience.

<reification-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The description of 360 days, 12 months, 720 hours, etc., as wind measurements describes fixed temporal realities that constitute the absolute structure of time.

**Why it arises:**
The calendar correlations suggest absolute temporal truths. The precise enumeration appears to reveal the true nature of time.

**Primary consequence:**
Time is reified into fixed measurable structure. The practitioner believes these calculations describe time's ultimate nature excluding conventional measurement.

**Secondary consequences:**
Temporal fixation obscures timelessness. The practitioner becomes obsessed with temporal calculations, missing the timeless dimension of mind.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [TEMPORAL REIFICATION] time as thing, [CALENDAR OBSESSION] measuring moments, and [CHRONOLOGICAL MATERIALISM] dates as real. The error reduces eternity to schedule.

<ontological-error> 
**Misreading:**
The distinction between wisdom wind (ye shes rlung) ripening nirvana and karma wind (las rlung) ripening samsara describes two fundamentally different types of wind with different essences and destinies.

**Why it arises:**
The functional distinction suggests ontological difference. Dualistic habits interpret different functions as evidence of different essences.

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner attempts to eliminate karma wind and cultivate wisdom wind, treating them as actually separate entities.

**Secondary consequences:**
Aversion to samsara-wind develops. The practitioner tries to get rid of ordinary breathing, believing it obstructs liberation.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [WIND PURIFICATION] eliminating bad, [DUALISTIC PRACTICE] separate cultivation, and [SAMSAra AVERSION] rejecting ordinary. The error creates warfare.

[LIGHT CHASING] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The cosmological correlations (sun, moon, breath) produce enhanced light experiences at specific times—practitioners should time their practice to celestial alignments to maximize luminosity and vision intensity.

**Why it arises:**
The sun-breath correlation suggests optimal conditions for light phenomena. Astrological traditions emphasize timing for maximum effect.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes astrological light-hunting. The practitioner plans practice around celestial events, believing specific alignments produce better visions, treating external timing as causal factor.

**Secondary consequences:**
External dependence develops. The practitioner waits for "right" cosmic conditions , avoiding recognizing light's always-available nature. Luminosity is sought as external phenomenon but not recognized as mind's display.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [OPTIMAL TIMING HUNTING] waiting for alignment, [COSMIC LIGHT CHASING] external conditions, and [CONDITION DEPENDENCY] requiring specific setup. The error creates limitation.

[STAGE HIERARCHY] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Wisdom wind and karma wind represent progressive stages—practitioners begin dominated by karma wind, gradually shift to wisdom wind, until finally only wisdom wind remains at full realization.

**Why it arises:**
The two-wind distinction suggests developmental progression. Spiritual paths often frame practice as progressive transformation from impure to pure.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes wind-purification project. The practitioner works to "replace" karma wind with wisdom wind, believing this substitution constitutes awakening.

**Secondary consequences:**
Elitism about "wisdom wind" develops. The practitioner feels advanced when experiencing certain states, superior to those with "ordinary" wind. Hierarchical wind-states obscure recognition that both winds are equally empty.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [WIND HIERARCHY] better/worse breathing, [STATUS OBSESSION] measuring advancement, and [ELITIST PRACTICE] superior states. The error creates division.

- PAGE 373: Wind contraction, wisdom functions (connected)

<ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The explanation that the same wind becomes wisdom or karma wind depending on whether channels are "contracted" or not describes an actual mechanical process where channel constriction literally transforms wind's nature.

**Why it arises:**
The causal language ("becomes," "transforms") suggests physical mechanism. Mechanical frameworks interpret these as literal transformative processes.

**Primary consequence:**
Channel mechanics replace view. The practitioner works to keep channels unconstricted, believing this mechanically produces wisdom wind.

**Secondary consequences:**
Physical manipulation replaces recognition. The practitioner focuses on channel openness in contrast to recognizing that wind's nature is mind.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [CHANNEL MECHANICS] keeping open, [PHYSICAL MANIPULATION] preventing constriction, and [OPENNESS OBSESSION] mechanical factor. The error reduces view to maintenance.

<ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The description of wisdom wind's four functions (basis wisdom, characteristic wisdom, etc.) constitutes an ontology of wisdom as a thing with specific powers and capabilities.

**Why it arises:**
The functional description suggests entity with powers. Reifying habits interpret functions as properties of an existing thing.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom is reified into a powerful force. The practitioner seeks to access or activate wisdom wind as if it were a special energy.

**Secondary consequences:**
Power-seeking replaces recognition. The practitioner pursues wisdom wind for its capabilities , avoiding recognizing empty nature.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [POWER SEEKING] capabilities over nature, [FUNCTIONAL OBSESSION] what wisdom does, and [ABILITY ACCUMULATION] collecting powers. The error reduces recognition to utility.

<ontological-error> <eternalistic-error>
**Misreading:**
The description of the twelve functions of karma wind producing body growth, samsara, etc., describes fixed karmic destiny mechanically produced by wind functions.

**Why it arises:**
The enumeration of functions suggests deterministic mechanics. Fatalistic frameworks interpret these as unchangeable causal chains.

**Primary consequence:**
Karma becomes mechanical determinism. The practitioner believes wind functions fix destiny but not seeing karma as empty.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fatalistic resignation develops. The practitioner accepts conditions as mechanically produced yet not recognizing their malleable nature.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [MECHANICAL DETERMINISM] automatic production, [FATALISTIC RESIGNATION] accepting cycling, and [FUNCTION MATERIALISM] fixed operations. The error creates hopelessness.

[PRACTICE ACCUMULATION] <meditationism-error>
**Misreading:**
The various wind states (contracted/uncontracted channels, wisdom/karma winds) each require specific techniques—practitioners should master multiple methods to address all wind conditions comprehensively.

**Why it arises:**
The wind diversity suggests technique variety. Educational frameworks encourage accumulating methods to cover all possibilities.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes wind-technique collection. The practitioner amasses methods for contracted channels, unconstricted channels, wisdom wind cultivation, karma wind transformation, etc.

**Secondary consequences:**
Technique proliferation obscures single recognition. The practitioner jumps between wind-focused practices without recognizing that all wind conditions are equally displays of mind's nature. Multiple methods create confusion about the one recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [TECHNIQUE VARIETY] accumulating methods, [CONDITION-SPECIFIC PRACTICE] addressing all states, and [DISPERSAL OBSESSION] comprehensive coverage. The error obscures unity.

[VISIONARY EXPERIENCE OBSESSION] [BINDU MATERIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The four wisdom wind functions produce distinct visionary experiences and bindu movements that practitioners should seek to experience—each function generates characteristic lights and thigle displays.

**Why it arises:**
The functional description suggests experiential results. Practitioners habitually interpret wisdom manifestations as visual phenomena to be pursued.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes function-vision mapping. The practitioner works to produce specific light shows for each wisdom function, tracking which "type" of wisdom wind is active by visual criteria.

**Secondary consequences:**
Materialism of wisdom develops. The practitioner treats wisdom wind as entity producing bindu and light substances. Functions are reified as mechanical processes, visions as accomplishments, creating complex materialistic framework disguised as Dzogchen.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [VISION MAPPING] function to light, [CATEGORIAL PHENOMENA] distinct experiences, and [MECHANICAL DISPLAY] wind produces show. The error reduces nature to cinema.

- PAGE 374: Lifespan calculations, thigle practice (connected)

<ontological-error> <eternalistic-error>
**Misreading:**
The wind measurement calculations showing deficiency from 21,600 indicating lifespan reduction describe actual fixed destiny—mechanical correlations between breath count and death time.

**Why it arises:**
The numerical correlations suggest scientific fatalism. The precise deficiency calculations appear to predict death with certainty.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes fatalistic numerology. The practitioner believes breath calculations mechanically determine lifespan.

**Secondary consequences:**
Death anxiety or complacency develops. The practitioner becomes anxious about breath deficiency or fatalistically resigned to calculated death time.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [FATALISTIC NUMEROLOGY] death by calculation, [BREATH DEFICIENCY ANXIETY] tracking loss, and [RESIGNATION OBSESSION] accepting destiny. The error creates despair.

<ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The detailed calculations showing specific lifespan reduction for specific breath deficiencies (50 missing = 2 years, etc.) describe actual fixed correlations between physiology and longevity.

**Why it arises:**
The precise numerical table suggests scientific law. Mathematical precision encourages belief in discoverable deterministic relationships.

**Primary consequence:**
Longevity becomes mathematical calculation. The practitioner treats lifespan as determined by physiological mathematics.

**Secondary consequences:**
Numerical obsession with death develops. The practitioner calculates remaining lifespan from breath measurements, missing that recognition transcends death.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [LIFESPAN MATHEMATICS] living by formula, [CALCULATED DEATH] predicted ending, and [NUMERICAL DESTINY] digits determine fate. The error reduces life to equation.

<meditationism-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The description of conventional thigle (kun rdzob thig le) and ultimate thigle (don dam thig le) practice presents two distinct meditation techniques for realizing different levels of truth.

**Why it arises:**
The two-truth framework suggests progressive practice. Mahayana training encourages staged approach to conventional and ultimate.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes two-stage meditation. The practitioner works on conventional thigle first, planning to advance to ultimate thigle later.

**Secondary consequences:**
Gradualism obscures direct recognition. The practitioner believes awakening requires sequential practice and not immediate recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [STAGE PROGRESSION] beginner to advanced, [TWO-STEP MEDITATION] sequential practice, and [GRADUALIST OBSESSION] step-by-step approach. The error delays recognition.

[BINDU MATERIALISM] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The breath-thigle correlation indicates that each breath moves bindu through channels—practitioners should seek to maximize bindu flow and minimize loss, treating thigle as precious life-substance to conserve.

**Why it arises:**
The calculation of breaths suggests measurable substance movement. Materialist frameworks interpret thigle as physical drops depleted by each exhalation.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes bindu conservation. The practitioner focuses on retaining thigle, minimizing breath loss, treating bindu as limited resource to hoard.

**Secondary consequences:**
Substantialism creates anxiety. The practitioner worries about "wasting" thigle through excessive breathing, develops breath-holding practices, confuses bindu accumulation with realization. Life-force is treated as commodity to manage.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [BINDU DEFICIENCY TRACKING] monitoring loss, [THIGLE ECONOMICS] managing drops, and [RETENTION OBSESSION] preventing escape. The error creates anxiety.

[STAGE HIERARCHY] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Conventional thigle and ultimate thigle represent progressive stages—beginners must work with conventional thigle (channels, winds), advanced practitioners graduate to ultimate thigle (emptiness), creating tiered curriculum.

**Why it arises:**
The two-thigle distinction suggests developmental progression. Educational systems encourage staged learning from simple to complex.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes thigle curriculum. The practitioner believes conventional thigle is beginner practice, ultimate thigle advanced, creating artificial hierarchy and delayed recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Elitism develops. Those practicing "ultimate thigle" feel superior to "conventional thigle" practitioners. Both miss that all thigle is mind's display. Hierarchy obscures immediate availability of recognition in any thigle state.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [CURRICULAR HIERARCHY] conventional = beginner, [ADVANCED ELITISM] ultimate = superior, and [PROGRESSIVE OBSESSION] delayed awakening. The error creates barriers.

- PAGE 373: Wisdom functions, karma functions
- PAGE 375: Wind analogy, scholarly arguments (connected)

<ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The analogy of the same child becoming a tiger when angry and human when calm is interpreted as proof that wisdom and karma winds are literally the same substance with different accidental properties.

**Why it arises:**
The analogy suggests substance with changing qualities. Essentialist frameworks interpret the sameness as shared underlying essence.

**Primary consequence:**
Wind is reified into single substance. The practitioner believes all wind is ultimately one thing that can be either wisdom or karma.

**Secondary consequences:**
Substantialism obscures emptiness. The practitioner grasps at wind as real substance with variable qualities instead of seeing its empty nature.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [SUBSTANCE ONTOLOGY] one thing many forms, [VARIABLE ESSENCE] changeable nature, and [ACCIDENTAL PROPERTIES] surface changes. The error creates confusion.

<scholarly-collapse-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The polemical section refuting objections about how one wind can be two presents philosophical arguments that should be studied, understood, and defended as correct doctrine.

**Why it arises:**
The debate format suggests philosophical position to be mastered. Academic training encourages analysis and defense of argumentative positions.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes philosophical position. The practitioner studies the arguments to defend Dzogchen view in debate not realizing the view.

**Secondary consequences:**
Intellectual mastery replaces realization. The practitioner can explain the refutation eloquently without recognizing the nature it points to.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [DEBATE OBSESSION] defending positions, [ARGUMENT MASTERY] winning discussions, and [PHILOSOPHICAL MATERIALISM] view as opinion. The error reduces pointing to argument.

<reification-error> <eternalistic-error>
**Misreading:**
The four wisdom winds' functions (basis wisdom, characteristic wisdom, producing wisdom, moving wisdom) describe permanent ontological categories of wisdom with distinct essential natures.

**Why it arises:**
The fourfold classification suggests categorical ontology. Typological habits interpret these as four distinct types of wisdom.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom is reified into four types. The practitioner seeks to identify and cultivate each type as distinct entity.

**Secondary consequences:**
Categorical fixation develops. The practitioner obsesses about which wisdom is manifesting rather than recognizing wisdom's non-dual nature.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [CATEGORICAL WISDOM] four separate types, [DISTINCT ESSENCES] different natures, and [TYPOLOGICAL OBSESSION] classification over recognition. The error fragments unity.

[VISIONARY EXPERIENCE OBSESSION] [LIGHT CHASING]
**Misreading:**
The wind transformations (like child becoming tiger) produce characteristic visionary experiences—distinct "shapes" of wind that appear as different lights, forms, or displays that practitioners should seek to experience.

**Why it arises:**
The transformation analogy suggests experiential results. Practitioners habitually interpret change as producing visual phenomena to pursue.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes transformation-chasing. The practitioner seeks to experience wind "becoming" different things, treating these shifts as spiritual progress, collecting various wind-states as accomplishments.

**Secondary consequences:**
Experience substantialism develops. Each wind transformation is treated as real achievement. The practitioner becomes attached to "tiger-wind" experiences, avoids "child-wind," creating dualistic fixation on desirable transformations.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [TRANSFORMATION CHASING] experiencing changes, [SHAPE COLLECTION] various forms, and [VARIETY OBSESSION] wanting different states. The error creates restlessness.

[POSTURE RIGIDITY] <practice-error>
**Misreading:**
The debate posture and presentation style require specific physical positioning—scholarly refutations must be delivered in formal debate postures, and maintaining these positions enhances argumentative power and understanding.

**Why it arises:**
The polemical format suggests performative requirements. Academic traditions often formalize physical presentation of arguments.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes debate posture fixation. The practitioner obsesses about sitting correctly for philosophical discussion, believing physical form affects logical clarity or doctrinal understanding.

**Secondary consequences:**
Form obscures content. The effort to maintain "correct" scholarly posture creates tension, distracting from the view being discussed. Physical rigidity mirrors intellectual rigidity, both obstructing recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [DEBATE POSTURE FIXATION] formal positioning, [PRESENTATIONAL RIGIDITY] physical formality, and [ARGUMENTATIVE TENSION] conflict energy. The error creates rigidity.

- PAGE 376: Twelve functions, wind characteristics (connected)

<ontological-error> <eternalistic-error>
**Misreading:**
The description of the twelve functions of karma wind producing external, internal, and secret twelvefold cycles describes fixed karmic mechanics that mechanically produce samsaric existence.

**Why it arises:**
The twelvefold structure suggests cyclical determinism. Cyclical time frameworks encourage belief in mechanical repetition.

**Primary consequence:**
Samsara becomes mechanical cycle. The practitioner believes karma wind mechanically produces existence in predetermined patterns.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deterministic resignation develops. The practitioner accepts samsaric cycling as mechanically inevitable rather than seeing its empty nature.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [CYCLICAL DETERMINISM] mechanical repetition, [SAMSAra MACHINERY] automatic cycling, and [RESIGNED ACCEPTANCE] inevitability. The error creates fatalism.

<ontological-error> <reification-error>
**Misreading:**
The description of wind characteristics (strong, weak, dull, sharp, etc.) and their karmic results describes fixed personality types determined by wind quality.

**Why it arises:**
The typology suggests psychological determinism. Personality frameworks encourage belief in fixed character types.

**Primary consequence:**
Character becomes wind-determined fate. The practitioner believes personality is mechanically produced by wind quality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fatalism about character develops. The practitioner accepts negative traits as wind-determined rather than recognizing their transformable nature.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [PERSONALITY TYPOLOGY] fixed character, [WIND-DETERMINED FATE] mechanical self, and [CHARACTER FATALISM] accepting traits. The error creates limitation.

<practice-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The concluding verses on thigle practice present meditation instructions that, when followed correctly, will produce realization through gradual familiarization.

**Why it arises:**
The instruction format suggests progressive practice. Spiritual training encourages staged approach to realization.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes progressive thigle meditation. The practitioner works on thigle practices expecting gradual results.

**Secondary consequences:**
Effortful practice replaces effortless recognition. The practitioner familiarizes with thigle rather than recognizing always-present nature.

**Cascade effects:**
This error generates [GRADUAL FAMILIARIZATION] effort over time, [MEDITATION PROGRESS] step-by-step, and [EFFORT ACCUMULATION] working toward. The error delays recognition.

[REALM PROJECTION] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The twelvefold cycles of karma wind create and sustain actual realms—each function builds a specific realm-location with real inhabitants, literal construction of six realm geographies.

**Why it arises:**
The twelvefold structure suggests comprehensive cosmology. The enumeration invites mapping to specific realm-locations.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes realm-cartography. The practitioner believes karma wind literally constructs realm-realities, studying which functions create which destinations.

**Secondary consequences:**
Externalization obscures mind-nature. The practitioner projects realm-creation outward, believing worlds exist independently, rather than recognizing realms as modes of experience without separate existence.

**Cascade effects:**
This error produces [COSMIC CARTOGRAPHY] mapping realms, [TWELVE-DESTINATION FRAMEWORK] specific locations, and [CONSTRUCTION ONTOLOGY] building worlds. The error externalizes display.
