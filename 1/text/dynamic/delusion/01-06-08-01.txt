[8770-8774] <symbolic-literalism> [OUTER/INNER/SECRET/PERFECT AS LEVELS]
**Misreading:**
The fourfold structure (outer, inner, secret, perfect) is interpreted as hierarchical levels one progresses through, with "perfect" as highest attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking. "Perfect" suggests completion. Four items invite progression.

**Primary consequence:**
Level-climbing. The practitioner seeks to advance from outer to perfect.

**Secondary consequences:**
Elitism about "perfect" level; premature advanced practice; missing that four describe simultaneous aspects.

**Cascade effects:**
<elitism-error> through level-hierarchy.
<practice-path-confusion> through premature advancement.

[8775-8786] <purity-obsession> [OBSCURATION PURIFICATION AS REQUIRED]
**Misreading:**
The mention of "purifying body, speech, and mind obscurations" is interpreted as establishing required purification work before recognition is possible.

**Why it arises:**
Purification psychology. "Obscurations" suggest impurity. Fear of being unworthy.

**Primary consequence:**
Deferring recognition. The practitioner believes they must purify before recognizing.

**Secondary consequences:**
Endless purification practices; unworthiness-complex; missing that recognition is immediate.

**Cascade effects:**
<preparation-paralysis> through purification-requirements.
<future-dependency> through deferring to purified state.

[8787-8801] <posture-fetishism> [SITTING/GAZING AS TECHNIQUE]
**Misreading:**
The descriptions of postures (sitting posture, gazing posture) are interpreted as establishing specific physical positions that cause realization when held correctly.

**Why it arises:**
Physical causation belief. "Posture" suggests form. Yoga asana parallels.

**Primary consequence:**
Position-obsession. The practitioner believes correct posture causes results.

**Secondary consequences:**
Physical strain; checking posture constantly; missing that posture supports, not causes.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-fetishism> through posture-requirement.
<meditationism-error> through form-causality.

[8794-8801] <word-empowerment-magic> [SYMBOLIC WORDS AS POWER]
**Misreading:**
The "words" (tshig) of symbolic indication are interpreted as mantras or special words that carry power to convey meaning automatically.

**Why it arises:**
Mantra literalism. "Words" suggest verbal power. Magical thinking about sacred speech.

**Primary consequence:**
Word-power belief. The practitioner believes specific words cause transmission.

**Secondary consequences:**
Mantra-accumulation; verbal obsession; missing that words point, not power.

**Cascade effects:**
<mantra-fetishism> through word-power.
<ritual-mechanism> through verbal-causality.

[8802-8809] <empowerment-typology> [FOUR EMPOWERMENTS AS CURRICULUM]
**Misreading:**
The four empowerments classified by "certainty, ripening, self-nature, and manifestation" are interpreted as curriculum stages to progress through.

**Why it arises:**
Educational framework. Classification suggests curriculum. Wanting systematic path.

**Primary consequence:**
Curriculum-completion. The practitioner tries to "complete" all four types.

**Secondary consequences:**
Empowerment-collecting; missing that classification describes aspects, not stages.

**Cascade effects:**
<progress-tracking> through type-completion.
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through curriculum-model.
