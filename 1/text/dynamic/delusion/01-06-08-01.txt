[8770-8770] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [WISDOM SEQUENCING]
**Misreading:**
The wisdom-prajna empowerment (shes rab ye shes dbang) and word empowerment (tshig dbang) are interpreted as advanced stages requiring preparation through previous empowerments, forming a temporal curriculum.

**Why it arises:**
Educational progression models impose sequential learning frameworks. The numerical ordering suggests prerequisite structure. Fear of "incomplete foundation" drives deferral.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that all four empowerments are simultaneous aspects of single recognition is entirely lost. The highest empowerment is deferred indefinitely while lower ones are obsessively repeated.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners accumulate empowerments like academic degrees without recognizing their nature. Elitist hierarchies form around empowerment-status. The simplicity of direct introduction is abandoned for complexity.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers all error types. Trekcho/thogyal will be approached as advanced curriculum rather than direct recognition.

[8771-8781] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [PURIFICATION METRICS]
**Misreading:**
The 64, 128, or 512 bodies/purifications are interpreted as measurable quotas to be completed, like items on a spiritual checklist, with completion guaranteeing attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Quantification provides illusion of progress. The mathematical precision suggests calculable achievement. Anxiety about "enough" practice drives counting-obsession.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that these numbers point to recognition, not quantities to accumulate, is entirely lost. Practice becomes spreadsheet management rather than wisdom cultivation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners compete over numbers completed while neglecting quality of recognition. Burnout from obsessive counting leads to abandonment of practice. The symbolic becomes the literal.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on signs of warmth will be treated as completion certificates rather than natural expressions of recognition.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page contains empowerment instructions. Preceding pages established posture and mantra errors that carry forward. Following pages (205+) discuss subtle body bliss practices that will be misunderstood as empowerment-dependent techniques rather than universally available recognition.

[8782-8790] <practice-error> [THIGLE MANIPULATION]
**Misreading:**
The bindu/thigle practices are interpreted as physical manipulations of actual substances within the body, like moving fluids or energy through hydraulic mechanics.

**Why it arises:**
Physiological reductionism projects onto subtle body. The liquid-like descriptions suggest material substances. Desire for tangible, controllable practice supports hydraulic interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that thigle is the luminous nature of mind, not a substance to move, is entirely lost. Practice becomes body-manipulation rather than recognition-cultivation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners force physical movements seeking "thigle flow," causing injury. The wisdom aspect of bliss is abandoned for sensation-seeking. Technique-accumulation replaces view-grounded practice.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. Subsequent pages on four joys will be approached as thigle-management techniques.

[8791-8799] [VIEW ERROR] [CHANNEL SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The channels (rtsa) and chakras are treated as anatomical structures with fixed locations, like the cardiovascular system, that can be mapped, manipulated, and developed.

**Why it arises:**
Medical anatomy models unconsciously project onto subtle body. The spatial language suggests fixed geography. The desire for objective, scientific certainty supports literalization.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that channels are conceptual designations for the movement of awareness, not fixed structures, is entirely obscured. The energetic becomes the physical.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners obsess over precise anatomical locations while neglecting the awareness that moves. Disappointment when "channels" can't be objectively verified leads to skepticism. The symbolic is reduced to the literal.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Subsequent pages on channel-opening will be approached as anatomical development.

[8800-8808] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [WIND CONTROL]
**Misreading:**
The winds (rlung) are understood as actual energies or forces that can be captured, directed, and controlled through breathing techniques, like capturing and directing a physical current.

**Why it arises:**
Physics models of energy projection onto prana. The kinetic language suggests controllable forces. Desire for power-over experience supports control-interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that winds are the movements of mind, not forces to control, is entirely lost. Practice becomes manipulation rather than recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Breathing obsession replaces recognition. Practitioners develop anxiety about "correct" breathing while missing that awareness is never breath-dependent. The natural becomes forced.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <practice-error>. Subsequent pages on wind-mind union will be approached as fusion of two substances.

[8809-8809] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [BLISS DEVELOPMENT]
**Misreading:**
The cultivation of bliss is interpreted as developing an experience over time through repeated practice, like building muscle or acquiring skill, with bliss as conditioned attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Conditioning and training frameworks impose development models. The language of "cultivation" suggests temporal growth. Fear that bliss won't happen without effort drives doing-obsession.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that bliss is the natural expression of mind's nature, always present, never developed, is entirely obscured. Seeking replaces finding.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners chase increasingly intense experiences, becoming bliss-addicted. Disappointment when conditioned experiences fade leads to technique-switching. The unconditioned is abandoned for the conditioned.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [PROGRESS TRACKING]. Four joys will be misread as temporal progression rather than simultaneous aspects.
