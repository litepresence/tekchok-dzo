<ontological-error> [PRIMORDIAL PURITY AS STATE]
**Misreading:**
The description of primordial purity (ka dag) as essence and spontaneous presence (lhun grub) as nature is interpreted as describing two sequential or hierarchical states of realization.

**Why it arises:**
Dualistic structuring. The mind automatically converts "essence/nature" into "ground/result" or "before/after" despite explicit non-duality statements.

**Primary consequence:**
Viewing ka dag as preliminary state and lhun grub as advanced attainment, creating two-phase Dzogchen practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Seeking "deeper" experience beyond primordial purity; missing that lhun grub is how ka dag appears.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through sequencing inseparable aspects.
<meditationism-error> through seeking lhun grub as new experience.

<doctrinal-confusion> [TWO BASES AS DUALITY]
**Misreading:**
The tantric citation describing "two aspects of the basis" (ka dag and lhun grub) is interpreted as literal duality within the ground, implying two separate dimensions or principles.

**Why it arises:**
Literalism toward enumeration. Even within Dzogchen tradition, practitioners hear "two" as two rather than pedagogical distinctions of single nature.

**Primary consequence:**
Believing ground has dual structure. The practitioner conceptualizes ka dag and lhun grub as separate realities needing reconciliation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Theological debates about priority; seeking "pure ka dag" beyond appearances or "rich lhun grub" appearances beyond emptiness.

**Cascade effects:**
<view-fragmentation> through dividing what text presents as unified.
<philosophical-fixation> through metaphysical speculation.

<linguistic-error> [BEYOND EXPRESSION AS INEXPRESSIBLE TRUTH]
**Misreading:**
The phrase "free from the basis of expression" is interpreted to mean the truth is ineffable, mysterious, or requires special transmission beyond words.

**Why it arises:**
Romanticization of mysticism. The denial of expression becomes invitation to esoteric exceptionalism rather than simple directness.

**Primary consequence:**
Creating special-status knowledge. The practitioner believes primordial purity is secret teaching requiring initiation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Guru-dependency; dismissive attitude toward straightforward explanations; spiritual materialism of "ineffable realization."

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through making transmission esoteric.
<elitism-error> through "ineffable" superiority.

<practical-error> [DISPUTE ABANDONMENT AS TECHNIQUE]
**Misreading:**
The section on "abandoning disputes" through "conceptual enumeration and direct recognition" is interpreted as presenting two methods for resolving doctrinal disagreements.

**Why it arises:**
Method-acquisition habit. Even description of non-conceptual recognition is heard as offering technique for ending debate.

**Primary consequence:**
Turning recognition into debate-resolution strategy. The practitioner applies "direct recognition" as rhetorical move rather than genuine insight.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dzogchen becoming debate club methodology; spiritual pride in "not disputing"; covert competitiveness about non-competitiveness.

**Cascade effects:**
<intellectualism> through conceptual mastery of non-conceptuality.
<spiritual-materialism> through accumulating "correct view" as position.
