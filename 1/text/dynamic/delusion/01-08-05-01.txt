[10757-10760] <practice-error> [PAST FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
Reader treats View - establishing position error as a technique to be mastered through repeated application, believing that correct execution automatically produces realization.

**Why it arises:**
Skill-acquisition models from education and training unconsciously impose technique-mastery frameworks. The desire for concrete, do-able practices supports mechanism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that View - establishing position error is recognition, not technique, is entirely lost. Practice becomes doing rather than being.

**Secondary consequences:**
Technique accumulation replaces wisdom cultivation. Practitioners collect methods while missing the view that animates them. Practice becomes performance.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <progress tracking> and [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM]. All practice becomes technique-accumulation.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page discusses View - establishing position error. Preceding page (248) established errors that carry forward—practitioners will approach this content through already-deluded lenses. Following pages (250+) contain related material that will be misunderstood through the cascade effects established here.

[10770-10774] [VIEW ERROR] [PHILOSOPHICAL FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
Reader adopts Completion - signs and indications error as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Completion - signs and indications error is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Conceptual pride replaces genuine recognition. Debates about positions poison communities. The intellect is fetishized over wisdom.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <ground-path-fruition temporalization>. View becomes position rather than recognition.
