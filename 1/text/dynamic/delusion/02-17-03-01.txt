<conduct-obsession> <behavioral-yoga-fallacy>

**Misreading:**
The three types of conduct (not-attach-holding, negate-affirm-not, attach-not-clinging) describe actual behavioral practices—specific ways to act in the world that constitute the "conduct" of a Dzogchen practitioner, like ethical disciplines to follow.

**Why it arises:**
"Conduct" (spyod pa, caryā) suggests behavior and ethics. Buddhist traditions have elaborate conduct codes. The descriptions sound like behavioral guidelines (don't attach, don't negate/affirm, etc.).

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct becomes behavioral performance. Practitioners attempt to "do" non-attachment or "practice" non-clinging as deliberate actions, creating subtle effort. The teaching that conduct is spontaneous expression of recognition becomes moralistic discipline.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Deliberately trying to "not attach" to experiences
- Behavioral monitoring: "am I clinging or not?"
- Creating new rules: "Dzogchen practitioners don't attach"
- Missing that "not-attach-holding" describes spontaneous conduct, not deliberate behavior

**Cascade effects:**
<conduct-obsession> creates <behavioral-monitoring> (watching conduct) → <effortful-spontaneity> (trying to be spontaneous) → <recognition-prevention-error> (deliberate conduct substitutes for natural expression).

This brief section (02-17-03-01.txt, 14 lines) serves as structural outline for conduct practices in Chapter 17. The actual conduct instructions continue in subsequent sections.

This brief structural section introduces conduct (spyod pa) taxonomy. Primary error is conduct literalization—taking "not-attach-holding" etc. as behavioral rules rather than than spontaneous expression of recognition. The delusion analysis emphasizes: conduct in Dzogchen is not ethical discipline but natural activity of recognized awareness.
