<deity-form-materialization> [VISUAL REIFICATION]

**Misreading:**
The *sku rkyang* appearing during Phowa is an actual deity manifesting externally to be perceived by the dying consciousness.

**Why it arises:**
The term "appearing" (*snang ba*) triggers object-perception habits. The instruction that single body forms appear before complete forms creates temporal hierarchy suggesting progressive materialization.

**Primary consequence:**
Dying practitioner fixates on "meeting" the deity, creating subject-object dualism at moment requiring non-dual recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Disappointment when forms appear incomplete; grasping at *phyed sku* as partial failure manifestation pattern; anxiety about whether form is "real enough" to indicate success.

**Cascade effects:**
<deity-form-materialization> generates <phowa-force-transference> [fixation on form as destination requires effort to reach it] generates <liberation-event> [external deity becomes goal to achieve]

<five-family-segregation> [RIGS BOUNDARY REIFICATION]

**Misreading:**
The five forms (*sku rkyang*, *phyed sku*, *yab yum*, *tshom bu*, *dkyil 'khor*) represent progressive stages of accomplishment, with the great mandala being superior achievement.

**Why it arises:**
The enumeration suggests hierarchy. Cultural valuation of "great" (*chen po*) over "single" (*rkyang*) maps onto spiritual accomplishment hierarchies.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner evaluates their signs against others, craving *dkyil 'khor chen po* appearance as validation of superior practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Jealousy of others' signs; concealment of actual visions to present more impressive account; self-aggrandizement when elaborate signs appear.

**Cascade effects:**
<five-family-segregation> leads to <deity-form-materialization> [hierarchical valuation requires external forms to possess value] produces <relic-achievement> [elaborate signs become trophies of accomplishment]

<symbol-object-reification> [MCHOD RTEN MATERIALIZATION]

**Misreading:**
Stupas (*mchod rten*), wheels (*'khor lo*), vajras (*rdo rje*), and jewels (*rin po che*) appearing during dissolution are physical sacred objects manifesting in space to guide the consciousness.

**Why it arises:**
Concrete ritual objects have established sacred value. Their appearance seems to offer tangible confirmation of successful Phowa.

**Primary consequence:**
Consciousness directed toward grasping at objects while avoiding recognizing their empty nature as own-mind display.

**Secondary consequences:**
Accumulating merit obsession transfers to afterlife; craving for precious object visions; disappointment with simple light appearances.

**Cascade effects:**
<symbol-object-reification> triggers <sound-light-ray-chasing> [objects are more graspable than light] produces <phowa-force-transference> [consciousness must "go toward" objects]

<lotus-attachment> [PADMA PURIFICATION FANTASY]

**Misreading:**
Lotus (*padma*) appearances indicate purification of desire and guarantee of Vajra family rebirth or Padma Buddha field attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Lotus symbolism throughout Buddhism as purity from defilement. Padma family association creates expectation of specific soteriological outcome.

**Primary consequence:**
Relaxation into habitual patterns under guise of "pure desire," mistaking symbolic appearance for actual transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual bypassing justified by visionary signs; premature cessation of investigation; dismissal of ongoing attachment as "purified."

**Cascade effects:**
<lotus-attachment> produces <color-family-hierarchy> [Padma association privileges red/passion] triggers <five-family-segregation> [family membership becomes identity]

<generation-stage-incompletion> [BSKYED RIM FAILURE ANXIETY]

**Misreading:**
Letters (*yi ge*) and hand emblems (*phyag mtshan*) appearing instead of complete forms indicate insufficient generation stage practice and failed visualization capacity.

**Why it arises:**
Text explicitly contrasts incomplete (*nar ma son pa*) with complete (*yongs su rdzogs pa*) manifestations, suggesting evaluation criteria.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner at death panics that preparation was inadequate, creating desperate striving that obstructs natural liberation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Self-condemnation; regret about practice time allocation; envy of those with complete form visions.

**Cascade effects:**
<generation-stage-incompletion> generates <phowa-force-transference> [inadequacy drives compensatory effort] → <liberation-event> [future full appearance becomes salvation goal]

<completion-stage-arrogance> [RDZOGS RIM SUPERIORITY]

**Misreading:**
Complete *yab yum*, *tshom bu*, and *dkyil 'khor* appearances prove superior completion stage realization, authorizing spiritual authority over those with incomplete signs.

**Why it arises:**
Cultural valuation of wholeness over fragmentation. Sexual yoga (*yab yum*) mystique suggests advanced accomplishment.

**Primary consequence:**
Inflation of spiritual status based on visionary content as opposed to recognition of vision nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Teacher authority established through impressive death signs; lineage credentialing based on post-mortem phenomena; exploitation of bereaved through interpretation control.

**Cascade effects:**
<completion-stage-arrogance> → <deity-form-materialization> [superior forms prove superior realization] → <emanation-body-achievement> [authority demands sprul sku capacity]

<peaceful-wrathful-dualism> [ZHI KHRO SEPARATION]

**Misreading:**
Peaceful (*zhi ba*) and wrathful (*khro bo*) forms are two distinct categories requiring different responses, with peaceful being preferable for gentle practitioners.

**Why it arises:**
Explicit division (*gnyis te*) suggests classification. Cultural aversion to anger makes wrathful forms appear dangerous.

**Primary consequence:**
Rejection of wrathful manifestations as mistakes or obstacles, missing their identical essence to peaceful forms.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual type-casting; preference-based practice selection; avoidance of necessary intensity.

**Cascade effects:**
<peaceful-wrathful-dualism> → <wrathful-terror> [separation enables fear] → <peaceful-attachment> [preference hardens into aversion]

<relic-achievement> [SKU GDUNG MATERIALIZATION]

**Misreading:**
Relics (*sku gdung*) burning from the body prove successful liberation and provide material evidence of saintly accomplishment for community validation.

**Why it arises:**
Physical relics serve as tangible proof when spiritual attainment is invisible. Community needs verification mechanisms.

**Primary consequence:**
Dying concern shifts to producing impressive remains and not recognizing nature of mind.

**Secondary consequences:**
Post-mortem manipulation of cremation conditions to produce relics; family anxiety about corpse phenomena; commercialization of sacred remains.

**Cascade effects:**
<relic-achievement> → <five-family-segregation> [relic types become family membership cards] → <color-family-hierarchy> [color-coded relics establish hierarchy]

<liberation-event> [MYA NGAN LAS 'DAS PA AS FUTURE]

**Misreading:**
Nirvana (*mya ngan las 'das pa*) is a state achieved after death through proper sign recognition, a future event to be accomplished.

**Why it arises:**
"Having passed beyond sorrow" suggests movement from here to there. The sequence of signs-then-liberation implies temporal process.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner waits for liberation to happen but not recognizing ever-present nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Anticipatory anxiety; evaluation of "how close" to liberation; time-pressure panic.

**Cascade effects:**
<liberation-event> → <timeframe-expectation> [future achievement requires timeline] → <phowa-force-transference> [consciousness must travel to liberation]

<remainder-obsession> [BCAS MED PURITY PURSUIT]

**Misreading:**
Nirvana without remainder (*bcas med*) is superior to nirvana with remainder (*bcas bcas*), and practitioners should aim for complete dissolution without physical traces.

**Why it arises:**
"Without" suggests transcendence of "with." Complete disappearance seems more ultimate than partial.

**Primary consequence:**
Devaluation of embodied presence and emanation capacity; preference for annihilation over engagement.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dismissal of teachers displaying physical presence; nihilistic interpretations of emptiness; world-negation.

**Cascade effects:**
<remainder-obsession> → <emanation-body-rejection> [bcas med precludes sprul sku] → <engagement-avoidance> [no remainder means no return]

<aggregates-escape> [PHUNG PO ABANDONMENT]

**Misreading:**
Burning of aggregates' residue (*phung po'i rjen shul bsregs*) means consciousness successfully escapes the five aggregates and leaves them behind as impure dross.

**Why it arises:**
Fire imagery suggests purification through destruction. Escape narrative dominates spiritual imagination.

**Primary consequence:**
Aversion to embodied existence as obstacle to liberation; somatic rejection.

**Secondary consequences:**
Disassociation practices; body-neglect; premature cremation desires.

**Cascade effects:**
<aggregates-escape> → <deity-form-materialization> [new body replaces rejected aggregates] → <phowa-force-transference> [consciousness flees old vessel]

<maturity-hierarchy> [SMIN PA STATUS GRADING]

**Misreading:**
Manifest (*mngon gyur*) and mature (*smin pa*) signs indicate advanced practitioner status, while latent (*bag la zhar*) signs mark beginners, creating ranked spiritual classes.

**Why it arises:**
Explicit contrast between mature and immature (*ma smin*) suggests developmental evaluation framework.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner judges their signs and others' through maturity lens, creating comparative spirituality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual elitism; exclusion of "immature" practitioners from advanced teachings; credentialism based on visionary phenomena.

**Cascade effects:**
<maturity-hierarchy> → <generation-stage-incompletion> [immature signs indicate failure] → <completion-stage-arrogance> [mature signs prove superiority]

<location-obsession> [GNAS SPECIFICATION ATTACHMENT]

**Misreading:**
Signs emerging from specific locations—head (*mgo*) or between vertebrae (*sgal tshigs*)—require conscious attention to anatomical precision during death process.

**Why it arises:**
Detailed anatomical instructions suggest technical importance of exit point.

**Primary consequence:**
Mental fixation on body scanning during dissolution, creating cognitive obstruction.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pre-death anxiety about "correct" exit; body-part valuation hierarchies; medicalization of spiritual process.

**Cascade effects:**
<location-obsession> → <phowa-force-transference> [consciousness must navigate anatomy] → <liberation-event> [exit location determines destination]

<crown-exit-elitism> [MGO LAS 'BYUNG SUPERIORITY]

**Misreading:**
Signs emerging from the crown (*mgo*) represent superior liberation through the *gtsug tor* opening, while spinal signs indicate inferior sideways departure.

**Why it arises:**
Crown is culturally established as highest point. Vertical hierarchy maps onto spiritual hierarchy.

**Primary consequence:**
Effort to force consciousness upward against natural flow, creating struggle.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dismissal of authentic liberation through other pathways; rigidification of Phowa technique; bypassing of natural process.

**Cascade effects:**
<crown-exit-elitism> → <location-obsession> [hierarchy requires precise navigation] → <phowa-force-transference> [upward force necessary for best outcome]

<consciousness-dissolution-reification> [RNAM SHES THIM MATERIALIZATION]

**Misreading:**
Consciousness (*rnam shes*) literally dissolves into space (*nam mkhar thim*) like liquid absorbing into cloth, a substantial process of merging.

**Why it arises:**
"Dissolution" (*thim*) suggests substance entering container. Spatial metaphors trigger reification.

**Primary consequence:**
Consciousness conceived as entity that travels and merges, maintaining subtle grasping at self.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fear of losing consciousness; desire to maintain witness during dissolution; confusion about who recognizes.

**Cascade effects:**
<consciousness-dissolution-reification> → <phowa-force-transference> [entity must be moved] → <liberation-event> [merging completes the journey]

<dharmakaya-attainment> [CHOS SKU ACHIEVEMENT]

**Misreading:**
Dharmakaya (*chos nyid*) is attained when consciousness dissolves, marking transition from ordinary to enlightened state.

**Why it arises:**
"Liberation" (*grol ba*) and "buddhahood" (*sangs rgyas*) suggest acquisition of new status.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner awaits transformation into Buddha-state but not recognizing ever-present nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Post-mortem identity confusion; waiting for "other side" awakening; missing immediate recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<dharmakaya-attainment> → <liberation-event> [attainment happens in time] → <emanation-body-achievement> [next stage is sprul sku capacity]

<five-day-fixation> [ZHAG LNGA TEMPORAL RIGIDITY]

**Misreading:**
The five days (*zhag lnga*) of samadhi is a fixed timeline that all practitioners experience, with liberation guaranteed upon completion of this period.

**Why it arises:**
Specific numerical instruction suggests standardized process. "Samadhi days" appears to measure time in conventional units.

**Primary consequence:**
Anxiety about timeline; comparison with others' experiences; fixation on duration rather quality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Disturbance of samadhi by time-checking; family concern about "delay"; medical intervention during samadhi period.

**Cascade effects:**
<five-day-fixation> creates <timeframe-expectation> [numbers create expectations] → <liberation-event> [completion triggers result]

<ting-nge-'dzin-duration> [SAMADHI LENGTH COMPARISON]

**Misreading:**
Longer samadhi duration indicates superior realization, with shorter periods marking inferior practitioners who "couldn't maintain" the state.

**Why it arises:**
Text mentions variation (*khyad yod*) in duration, which comparison-prone mind interprets as hierarchical.

**Primary consequence:**
Effort to prolong samadhi artificially, creating tension in naturally time-free state.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pride in extended samadhi reports; shame about brief periods; competitive spirituality.

**Cascade effects:**
<ting-nge-'dzin-duration> → <maturity-hierarchy> [duration proves maturity] → <completion-stage-arrogance> [longer equals better]

<wrathful-terror> [KHRO BO FEAR RESPONSE]

**Misreading:**
Wrathful appearances signal danger, punishment, or failed peaceful liberation requiring emergency corrective measures.

**Why it arises:**
Wrathful iconography triggers threat-detection. Cultural association of anger with harm.

**Primary consequence:**
Fight-flight activation during wrathful visions, destroying recognition opportunity.

**Secondary consequences:**
Aversion to wrathful deities; preference for gentle approaches; incomplete practice integration.

**Cascade effects:**
<wrathful-terror> → <peaceful-attachment> [fear drives preference] → <liberation-event> [wrathful form becomes obstacle to overcome]

<vajrasattva-thread-grasping> [RDO RJE SEMS DPA' SNANG THAG REIFICATION]

**Misreading:**
The Vajrasattva nose-thread (*sna thag*) is a literal cord connecting the dying practitioner to the deity, which must be grasped or followed.

**Why it arises:**
"Thread" (*thag*) suggests physical connection. Guidance imagery implies following path.

**Primary consequence:**
Effort to "grab" or "climb" the thread, creating striving where none is needed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Disappointment if thread not perceived; manipulation of subtle body to "find" it; fixation on nose sensation.

**Cascade effects:**
<vajrasattva-thread-grasping> → <phowa-force-transference> [thread is highway for consciousness] → <deity-form-materialization> [thread connects to external deity]

<sound-light-ray-chasing> [SGRA 'OD ZER GSUM PURSUIT]

**Misreading:**
Sound, light, and rays (*sgra 'od zer gsum*) are phenomena to be pursued, entered, or merged with as vehicles of liberation.

**Why it arises:**
Attractive sensory phenomena draw attention naturally. "Appearance" (*snang ba*) seems to offer experience.

**Primary consequence:**
Consciousness chases phenomena rather recognizing their nature, perpetuating grasping.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dissatisfaction when phenomena fade; craving for more intense experiences; spiritual materialism of perception.

**Cascade effects:**
<sound-light-ray-chasing> → <phowa-force-transference> [must move toward phenomena] → <liberation-event> [merging with light completes transfer]

<five-moments-haste> [SKAD CIG CHA LNGA IMPATIENCE]

**Misreading:**
The five moments (*skad cig cha lnga*) of liberation through wrathful forms is "faster" and therefore superior to five days through peaceful forms.

**Why it arises:**
Temporal comparison invites efficiency evaluation. Cultural preference for speed.

**Primary consequence:**
Preference for wrathful signs motivated by impatience , avoiding recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dismissal of gradual process; premature forcing; overlooking peaceful form profundity.

**Cascade effects:**
<five-moments-haste> → <wrathful-terror> [speed preference overcomes fear] → <timeframe-expectation> [shorter equals better]

<bardo-avoidance> [BAR DO MED PAR ESCAPE]

**Misreading:**
No-bardo liberation (*bar do med par*) is superior goal to be achieved, avoiding the dangerous intermediate state entirely.

**Why it arises:**
Bardo teachings emphasize its perils. "Without" seems safer than "with."

**Primary consequence:**
Fear of bardo creates aversion , avoiding preparation; rejection of experiences as "bardo" in contrast to recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Premature celebration of success; failure to recognize when in bardo; dissociative escapes.

**Cascade effects:**
<bardo-avoidance> → <liberation-event> [immediate liberation precludes bardo] → <remainder-obsession> [no bardo requires complete dissolution]

<stability-as-obstacle> [BRtan PA BLOCKAGE]

**Misreading:**
Stability (*brtan pa*) in peaceful forms prevents emanation capacity, making it inferior to wrathful instability that enables *sprul pa*.

**Why it arises:**
Text explicitly states peaceful stability prevents (*mi nus*) emanation while wrathful stability enables it.

**Primary consequence:**
Rejection of stability as obstacle; cultivation of instability; preference for chaos.

**Secondary consequences:**
Disregard for grounded practice; attraction to dramatic displays; confusion of instability with power.

**Cascade effects:**
<stability-as-obstacle> → <peaceful-attachment> [rejection of peaceful stability] → <wrathful-terror> [embracing fearful instability]

<twenty-one-day-expectation> [ZHAG NYI SHU RTSA GCIG FIXATION]

**Misreading:**
The twenty-one days (*zhag nyi shu rtsa gcig*) until emanation capacity is a fixed incubation period that all wrathful-form practitioners must complete.

**Why it arises:**
Specific numerical instruction interpreted as universal rule , avoiding approximate indication.

**Primary consequence:**
Anxiety about timeline; premature testing of capacity; disturbance of natural process.

**Secondary consequences:**
Family concern about "delayed" signs; medical interference; practitioner frustration.

**Cascade effects:**
<twenty-one-day-expectation> → <timeframe-expectation> [specific numbers create rigid expectations] → <emanation-body-achievement> [capacity arrives on schedule]

<od-gsal-path-grasping> ['OD GSAL LAM GTOD REIFICATION]

**Misreading:**
The clear light (*'od gsal*) is a path to be entered, traveled, and dissolved into, requiring navigation toward the *ka dag* ground.

**Why it arises:**
"Path" (*lam*) and "ground" (*sa*) suggest journey with destination. "Dissolution" (*zang thal*) suggests arrival.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner attempts to "enter" clear light as location, maintaining dualistic framework.

**Secondary consequences:**
Seeking clear light rather than recognizing present awareness; dissatisfaction with ordinary perception.

**Cascade effects:**
<od-gsal-path-grasping> → <phowa-force-transference> [path requires movement] → <liberation-event> [arrival at ground is achievement]

<ka-dag-purity-preference> [KA DAG SUPERIORITY]

**Misreading:**
Primordial purity (*ka dag*) is superior state to be achieved through dissolution of bardo appearances, representing final destination.

**Primary consequence:**
Devaluation of bardo and manifestation as impure; rejection of display; escape orientation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dismissal of emanation capacity; preference for cessation; nihilistic emptiness.

**Cascade effects:**
<ka-dag-purity-preference> → <bardo-avoidance> [purity precludes intermediate state] → <remainder-obsession> 

<sprul-pa-inability-shame> [SPRUl PA MI NUS INADEQUACY]

**Misreading:**
Inability to emanate (*sprul pa mi nus*) represents spiritual failure and incomplete realization, proving inadequate practice.

**Why it arises:**
Capacity (*nus pa*) implies ability, and inability implies lack. Social valuation of miracle-workers.

**Primary consequence:**
Shame about simple liberation; feeling of inadequacy; striving for dramatic displays.

**Secondary consequences:**
Hiding simple death signs; claiming emanation capacity falsely; spiritual depression.

**Cascade effects:**
<sprul-pa-inability-shame> → <emanation-body-achievement> [capacity becomes necessary proof] → <relic-achievement> [alternative evidence required]

<other-appearance-rejection> [GZHEN SNANG EXCLUSION]

**Misreading:**
Other-appearance (*gzhan snang*) liberation serves others but represents inferior path compared to self-appearance (*rang snang*) direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Distinction between self and other suggests hierarchy. Solipsistic spirituality privileges "my" experience.

**Primary consequence:**
Disregard for other-benefit as distraction from "real" liberation; narcissistic spirituality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Withdrawal from engagement; dismissal of compassionate activity; elitist isolation.

**Cascade effects:**
<other-appearance-rejection> → <ka-dag-purity-preference> [other-appearance is impure display] → <remainder-obsession> [no return needed]

<self-liberation-prerequisite> [RANG GROL PRECONDITION]

**Misreading:**
Self-liberation (*rang grol*) must be completed before other-benefit (*gzhan don*) can occur, creating temporal sequence of personal then collective salvation.

**Why it arises:**
Text states that without self-liberation (*rang ma grol*), other-benefit has no basis (*gnas skabs med*).

**Primary consequence:**
Delaying engagement until "fully liberated," which never arrives; perpetual preparation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual narcissism; abandonment of bodhisattva vow; justification of inactivity.

**Cascade effects:**
<self-liberation-prerequisite> → <liberation-event> [must achieve first] → <emanation-body-achievement> [then capacity emerges]

<sprul-pa-capacity-confusion> [SPRUl PA 'BYIN NUS MISUNDERSTANDING]

**Misreading:**
Emanation capacity (*sprul pa 'byin nus*) determines whether one is a "real" Buddha who benefits beings or fake Buddha who does nothing.

**Why it arises:**
Text explicitly criticizes those who fixate (*blo rtse gtod*) on capacity, calling it great error (*nor ba rngams che*).

**Primary consequence:**
Despite explicit warning, practitioner cannot help evaluating self and others by emanation capacity.

**Secondary consequences:**
Doubt about accomplished masters without displays; elevation of showy practitioners; commercialization of miracles.

**Cascade effects:**
<sprul-pa-capacity-confusion> → <emanation-body-achievement> [capacity defines achievement] → <relic-achievement> [alternative proofs when no emanations]

<buddha-as-doer> [SANGS RGYAS DON BYED REIFICATION]

**Misreading:**
A Buddha who does not act (*don mi byed pa*) is impossible, meaning all Buddhas must display emanations and perform miracles.

**Why it arises:**
Logical argument that Buddha must benefit or not be Buddha seems to require activity.

**Primary consequence:**
Expectation of constant miraculous intervention; disappointment with subtle activity; doubt about silent masters.

**Secondary consequences:**
Demanding attitude toward teachers; dismissal of quiet presence; attraction to theatrical displays.

**Cascade effects:**
<buddha-as-doer> → <emanation-body-achievement> [activity proves Buddha status] → <phowa-force-transference> [dying consciousness needs visible help]

<sku-gsum-separation> [THREE BODY DUALISM]

**Misreading:**
Dharmakaya (*chos sku*), Sambhogakaya (*longs sku*), and Nirmanakaya (*sprul sku*) are three actually separate bodies with distinct functions and locations.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration (*gsum*) suggests plurality. Different names imply different things.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner seeks specific body rather than recognizing inseparability; hierarchical valuation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Body-hopping spirituality; dharmakaya-escapism; form-rejection.

**Cascade effects:**
<sku-gsum-separation> → <dharmakaya-attainment> [dharmakaya is separate goal] → <emanation-body-achievement> [sprul sku is separate capacity]

<five-relic-typing> [SKU GDUNG LNGA CLASSIFICATION]

**Misreading:**
The five relic types (*shari ram*, *pari ram*, *churi ram*, *bseri ram*, *nyari ram*) permanently categorize practitioners into five Buddha families with fixed destinies.

**Why it arises:**
Explicit fivefold classification suggests typology. Family (*rigs*) language implies membership.

**Primary consequence:**
Fatalistic acceptance of family destiny; resignation or arrogance based on relic type.

**Secondary consequences:**
Rigid spiritual identity; exclusion from other family practices; predetermined salvation anxiety.

**Cascade effects:**
<five-relic-typing> → <five-family-segregation> [relics fix family membership] → <color-family-hierarchy> [family determines color status]

Disappointment with single relic; striving for complete set; materialistic collection mentality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Competitive display of relic variety; dismissal of single-type practitioners; commodification.

**Cascade effects:**
<collective-relic-superiority> → <relic-achievement> [variety proves achievement] → <five-relic-typing>

<relic-color-destiny> [KHADOG RIGS LU 'PHO FATALISM]

**Misreading:**
Relic color determines (*khadod*) the specific Buddha field one will enter, fixing post-mortem destination by color-coded geography.

**Why it arises:**
Explicit color-field correlations suggest deterministic mapping.

**Primary consequence:**
Anxiety about relic color; preference for preferred field's color; color-based salvation hierarchy.

**Secondary consequences:**
Field-prejudice; color-discrimination; resignation to "inferior" destinations.

**Cascade effects:**
<relic-color-destiny> → <color-family-hierarchy> [colors rank fields] → <liberation-event> [arrival at color-coded destination]

**Cascade effects:**
<blue-akshobhya-preference> → <color-family-hierarchy> [blue on top] → <relic-color-destiny> [blue determines best field]

<white-vajrasattva-purity> [DKAR PO PURITY OBSESSION]

**Misreading:**
White (*dkar po*) relics indicating Vajrasattva represent purity from all defilement, making white the "cleanest" and most advanced sign.

**Why it arises:**
White universally associated with purity. Vajrasattva as purification deity.

**Primary consequence:**
Obsession with white signs; aversion to "impure" colors; purification compulsions.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual cleanliness fetish; rejection of embodied life; dissociative purity.

<red-amitabha-attachment> [DMAR PO PASSION PREFERENCE]

**Misreading:**
Red (*dmar po*) relics indicating Amitabha's lotus family justify continued attachment and desire as "purified passion" rather than obstacles.

**Why it arises:**
Amitabha associated with desire-transformation. Red with passion. Western pure land popularity.

**Primary consequence:**
Rationalization of attachment; premature declaration of desire-purification; indulgence justified.

**Secondary consequences:**
Addiction-spirituality confusion; boundary-violation justified; premature tantric practice.

<green-amoghasiddhi-action> → <buddha-as-doer> [action proves Buddha status] → <phowa-force-transference> [active consciousness movement]

<size-hierarchy> [CHE CHUNG GRADING]

**Misreading:**
Larger relics indicate greater accomplishment, with size serving as measurable metric of spiritual attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Mention of size (*che chung*) invites quantification. Bigger seems better in material world.

**Primary consequence:**
Pride in large relics; shame about small ones; measurement obsession.

**Secondary consequences:**
Post-mortem size reporting; competitive relic displays; commodification by weight.

**Cascade effects:**
<size-hierarchy> → <relic-achievement> [size proves achievement] → <maturity-hierarchy> [larger equals more mature]

<location-quality-gradation> [GNAS KYI KHYAD PAR SPATIAL HIERARCHY]

**Misreading:**
Specific emergence locations for relics indicate quality gradations, with some anatomical positions producing "better" relics than others.

**Why it arises:**
Explicit mention of location differences (*khyad par*) invites hierarchical interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
Anxiety about where relics emerge; body-part valuation; anatomical obsession.

**Secondary consequences:**
Post-mortem location documentation; discrimination by emergence site; medicalization.

**Cascade effects:**
<location-quality-gradation> → <location-obsession> [hierarchy requires precise location] → <crown-exit-elitism> [superior locations exist]

<phowa-force-transference> [CONSCIOUSNESS PROJECTION]

**Misreading:**
Phowa is a technique of forcefully projecting consciousness out of the body toward chosen destination, requiring effort and control.

**Why it arises:**
"Transference" suggests movement. Instruction to "eject" consciousness implies force. Anxiety about death drives control-seeking.

**Primary consequence:**
Tension and striving during natural dissolution process, creating obstruction rather than opening.

**Secondary consequences:**
Exhaustion; fixation on technique over recognition; disappointment with effortless dissolution.

**Cascade effects:**
<phowa-force-transference> produces <consciousness-dissolution-reification> [entity must be moved] → <liberation-event> [arrival requires journey] → <dharmakaya-attainment> [destination is new state]
