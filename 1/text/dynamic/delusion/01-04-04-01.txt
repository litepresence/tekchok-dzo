[2836-2843] <two-truths-hierarchy> [ULTIMATE AS SUPERIOR]
**Misreading:**
The two truths framework (conventional and ultimate) is interpreted as establishing a value hierarchy where ultimate truth is "higher" or "better" than conventional truth.

**Why it arises:**
"Ultimate" suggests superiority. Hierarchical thinking. "Conventional" sounds mundane or lesser.

**Primary consequence:**
Ultimate-truth elitism. The practitioner dismisses conventional truth as inferior or unnecessary.

**Secondary consequences:**
Rejecting relative phenomena; nihilism; missing that both truths are inseparable.

**Cascade effects:**
<ultimate-truth-fetishism> through hierarchy.
<conventional-dismissal> through devaluation.

[2839-2842] <scriptural-authority> [NAGARJUNA CITATION AS PROOF]
**Misreading:**
The citation from Mulamadhyamakakarika is interpreted as establishing scriptural authority that proves the two truths doctrine definitively.

**Why it arises:**
Authority-dependency. Scriptural citation suggests proof. Buddhist fundamentalism.

**Primary consequence:**
Citation-as-proof. The practitioner believes two truths are true because Nagarjuna said so.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ending inquiry; dogmatism; missing that citation illustrates, not proves.

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through scriptural-proof.
<fundamentalism> through citation-dogmatism.

[2844-2848] <illusion-literalism> [PHENOMENA AS UNREAL]
**Misreading:**
"Phenomena marked by characteristics" being conventional truth is interpreted as establishing that phenomena are unreal, false, or illusory in the sense of non-existent.

**Why it arises:**
"Conventional" suggests "not really real." Illusion net tantra association. Nihilistic tendency.

**Primary consequence:**
Phenomena-dismissal. The practitioner believes appearances are unreal and can be ignored.

**Secondary consequences:**
Nihilism; world-rejection; missing that conventional truth is truth, not falsehood.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilistic-error> through unreality-interpretation.
<appearance-denial> through dismissal.

[2847-2848] <conventional-bifurcation> [FALSE/TRUE CONVENTIONAL AS TYPES]
**Misreading:**
The division into "false conventional" and "true conventional" is interpreted as establishing two types of conventional truth with different ontological statuses.

**Why it arises:**
Dualistic classification. False/true suggests value judgment. Wanting to distinguish "real" conventional from "fake."

**Primary consequence:**
Conventional-typology. The practitioner believes some conventional phenomena are "truly conventional" while others are "falsely conventional."

**Secondary consequences:**
Confusion; value-judgment of phenomena; missing that division is pedagogical.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-confusion> through conventional-typology.
<phenomena-ranking> through value-judgment.
