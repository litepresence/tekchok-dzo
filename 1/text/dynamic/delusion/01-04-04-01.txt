[2836-2843] <two-truths-hierarchy> <philosophical-stratification>
**Misreading:**
The presentation of two truths is interpreted as establishing a value hierarchy—ultimate truth is better, more important, and what really matters, while conventional truth is preparatory or secondary.

**Why it arises:**
The structure suggests levels: conventional then ultimate. "Ultimate" carries superlative connotations. Philosophical education often proceeds from preparatory to advanced material.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners focus exclusively on ultimate truth, viewing conventional analysis as merely preliminary. The integration of both truths in practice is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Philosophical sophistication is valued over practical application. Scholars debate emptiness while missing the emptiness of their debates.

**Cascade effects:**
<philosophical-elitism> (valuing sophisticated analysis), <preparatory-dismissal> (skipping basics), <academic-obscuration> (study replacing practice).

[2844-2848] <illusion-comparison-misunderstanding> <maya-negation>
**Misreading:**
The comparison of phenomena to illusions, dreams, and mirages is interpreted as meaning phenomena do not exist at all—that they are unreal, false, and meaningless.

**Why it arises:**
"Like an illusion" suggests fakery and deception. Dreams are not real. The comparison seems to deny existence. Nihilistic tendencies find support.

**Primary consequence:**
Phenomena are dismissed as unreal and unimportant. The middle way between existence and non-existence is missed as practitioners swing toward nihilism.

**Secondary consequences:**
Life is devalued. Why engage with what is "just an illusion"? The compassionate response to suffering is weakened by ontological dismissal.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilistic-interpretation> (denying existence), <meaninglessness> (life without value), <compassion-atrophy> (not responding to suffering).

[2836-2836] <functional-empiricism> <pragmatic-reification>
**Misreading:**
The emphasis on functional efficacy (don byed nugs pa) is interpreted as establishing a pragmatic criterion—if it works, it's conventionally real; ultimate truth is irrelevant to practical life.

**Why it arises:**
Pragmatism values what works. Western empirical traditions emphasize function. The phrase "functional efficacy" suggests practical utility.

**Primary consequence:**
Conventional truth becomes a pragmatic domain separate from ultimate truth. Practitioners compartmentalize—practical life vs spiritual truth.

**Secondary consequences:**
The integration of view and conduct is lost. Business as usual continues, with "ultimate truth" reserved for meditation sessions.

**Cascade effects:**
<compartmentalization> (splitting life and practice), <pragmatic-materialism> (what works is real), <spiritual-hobbyism> (Dzogchen as leisure activity).

[2836-2836] <virtue-merit-transaction> <karmic-calculism>
**Misreading:**
The ten virtuous actions and six perfections are understood as a transactional system—doing good creates merit, which can be cashed in for better rebirth or enlightenment.

**Why it arises:**
The language of cause and result implies transaction. Merit accumulation is often taught literally. Business-minded practitioners expect return on investment.

**Primary consequence:**
Virtue becomes a means of exchange—good deeds traded for spiritual rewards. The intrinsic value of virtue is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual materialism flourishes as practitioners accumulate merit like capital. Generosity becomes investment with expected returns.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-capitalism> (merit as currency), <transactional-ethics> (good deeds for rewards), <merit-attachment> (clinging to virtue).

[2836-2836] <emptiness-negation> <void-misunderstanding>
**Misreading:**
Ultimate truth as emptiness is interpreted as a grand negation—the universe is empty, meaningless, void, and nothing matters.

**Why it arises:**
"Emptiness" suggests absence and lack. Nihilistic worldviews resonate with void. Existential angst finds confirmation.

**Primary consequence:**
Emptiness is misunderstood as nihilistic void. The positive, luminous nature of emptiness is missed as practitioners fall into depression or apathy.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dzogchen becomes an existential philosophy of meaninglessness. The joyful recognition of primordial purity is replaced by grim nihilism.

**Cascade effects:**
<existential-nihilism> (nothing matters), <depression-error> (emptiness as despair), <void-fixation> (focusing on absence).
