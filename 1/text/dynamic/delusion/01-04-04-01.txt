[2836-2848] <two-truths-hierarchy>
**Risk:** Interpreting two truths as establishing value hierarchy—ultimate is "better" than conventional.

**How:** Structure suggests levels: conventional then ultimate. "Ultimate" carries superlative connotations.

**Consequence:** Practitioners focus exclusively on ultimate truth, missing integration of both truths in practice.

**Cascade:** Philosophical elitism, preparatory dismissal, academic obscuration replacing practice.

[2844-2848] <illusion-comparison-misreading>
**Risk:** Interpreting "phenomena like illusion" as phenomena do not exist—unreal, false, meaningless.

**How:** "Like an illusion" suggests fakery. Dreams are not real. Comparison seems to deny existence.

**Consequence:** Phenomena dismissed as unreal. Middle way between existence and non-existence is missed.

**Cascade:** Nihilistic interpretation, meaninglessness, compassion atrophy.

[2836-2843] <functional-empiricism>
**Risk:** Interpreting functional efficacy as pragmatic criterion—if it works, it's real; ultimate truth irrelevant.

**How:** Pragmatism values what works. "Functional efficacy" suggests practical utility.

**Consequence:** Conventional truth becomes separate domain from ultimate. Practice compartmentalized.

**Cascade:** Splitting life and practice, pragmatic materialism, Dzogchen as hobby.
