<tantra-typology> [WORD/MEANING AS HIERARCHY]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between "meaning tantra" (don gyi rgyud) and "word tantra" (tshig gi rgyud) is interpreted as establishing hierarchy, with meaning tantra as "higher" than word tantra.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking. "Meaning" sounds deeper than "words." Anti-textual bias in spirituality.

**Primary consequence:**
Word-devaluation. The practitioner believes they can ignore texts and focus only on "meaning."

**Secondary consequences:**
Illiteracy-spirituality; missing that words convey meaning; false depth.

**Cascade effects:**
<anti-intellectualism> through word-rejection.
<elitism-error> through meaning-superiority.

<buddha-nature-literalism> [BUDDHA FAMILY AS BLOODLINE]
**Misreading:**
"Buddha family" (sangs rgyas kyi rigs) interpreted as establishing hereditary caste or bloodline determining spiritual capacity.

**Why it arises:**
Racial/familial thinking. "Family" suggests genetics. Historical caste systems.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual eugenics. The practitioner believes some are "born Buddhist" and others aren't.

**Secondary consequences:**
Exclusion; elitism; missing that Buddha nature is universal.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-racism> through hereditary capacity.
<elitism-error> through birth-privilege.

<generation-completion-dualism> [STAGE SEPARATION]
**Misreading:**
The classification into generation stage (bskyed rim), completion stage (rdzogs rim), and union (zung 'jug) is interpreted as three sequential practices to master in order.

**Why it arises:**
Progressive learning models. Stages suggest curriculum. Fear of skipping basics.

**Primary consequence:**
Stage-climbing. The practitioner believes they must complete generation before completion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring completion; generation-obsession; missing simultaneity.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through stage-model.
<progress-tracking> through stage-completion.

<component-checklist> [TEN COMPONENTS AS REQUIREMENTS]
**Misreading:**
The ten components of generation stage tantra are interpreted as mandatory requirements that must all be present.

**Why it arises:**
Comprehensiveness compulsion. Ten items suggest completeness. Fear of missing elements.

**Primary consequence:**
Component-anxiety. The practitioner worries about having all ten.

**Secondary consequences:**
Formalism; checking off components; missing that classification is descriptive.

**Cascade effects:**
<perfectionism-paralysis> through requirement-checking.
<ritual-formalism> through component-compliance.

<eightfold-mechanism> [EIGHT MEASURES AS CRITERIA]
**Misreading:**
The eight measures of completion stage are interpreted as criteria that must be satisfied for completion stage to "work."

**Why it arises:**
Criterion-based assessment. Eight suggests systematicity. Quality-control mindset.

**Primary consequence:**
Assessment-obsession. The practitioner measures themselves against eight criteria.

**Secondary consequences:**
Self-judgment; inadequacy-feelings; missing that eight describe aspects, not requirements.

**Cascade effects:**
<self-monitoring> through criterion-assessment.
<inadequacy-amplification> through measurement.

---

<union-accumulation> [EIGHTEEN AS TOTAL]
**Misreading:**
The eighteen elements (ten + eight) needed for union are interpreted as establishing that union requires accumulating all eighteen components.

**Why it arises:**
Accumulation logic. Union as result of combining parts. Construction metaphor.

**Primary consequence:**
Union-construction. The practitioner tries to "build" union from eighteen parts.

**Secondary consequences:**
Complexity-anxiety; missing that union is recognition, not assembly.

**Cascade effects:**
<construction-metaphor> through union-assembly.
<complexity-paralysis> through part-accumulation.

---

<dzogchen-supremacy> [TRANSCENDING ALL AS HIERARCHY]
**Misreading:**
Dzogchen as "transcending all" is interpreted as establishing Dzogchen as supreme vehicle above all others.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical spirituality. "Transcend" suggests superiority. Marketing of Dzogchen.

**Primary consequence:**
Vehicle-denigration. The practitioner believes other vehicles are inferior.

**Secondary consequences:**
Skipping foundations; Dzogchen elitism; sectarianism.

**Cascade effects:**
<vehicle-hierarchy-elitism> through transcendence-claims.
<practice-path-confusion> through skipping prerequisites.

---

<weaving-metaphor-literalism> [THREADS AS COMPONENTS]
**Misreading:**
The weaving metaphor (many threads making cloth) is interpreted as establishing that tantra is constructed from many separate components.

**Why it arises:**
Construction literalism. Weaving suggests assembly. Part-whole thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Tantra-construction. The practitioner believes tantra is assembled from parts.

**Secondary consequences:**
Component-accumulation; missing unified nature; reductionism.

**Cascade effects:**
<reductionism> through part-assembly.
<accumulation-mindset> through component-gathering.
