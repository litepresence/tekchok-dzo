[1861-1873] <yoga-typology-fetish> <five-yoga-hierarchy>
**Misreading:**
The five yogas (*rnal 'byor lnga*)—great perfections of power, prophecy of scripture, great breath, body-separation, action-yogin—interpreted as hierarchical stages of spiritual development to progress through sequentially.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration suggests progression. "Five" implies system. Tantric traditions have graduated practices. The terminology sounds technical and advanced.

**Primary consequence:**
Yogas become achievement ladder. Practitioners attempt to "complete" each yoga before proceeding. The spontaneous nature is replaced by curriculum.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Attempting to "master" body-separation yoga before breath yoga
- Creating developmental hierarchy among the five
- Missing that all five describe aspects of single recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<yoga-hierarchy> → ranking practices
<sequential-mastery> → completing stages
<progress-tracking> → which yoga am I in
<recognition-delay> → working through system

[1874-1891] <yogin-identity-formation> <five-yoga-personality>
**Misreading:**
The five yogas describe five types of practitioners—personality archetypes one identifies with or aspires to become (like "I'm a breath-yogin type").

**Why it arises:**
Typology fascination. Personality tests are popular. Wanting to know "which one am I." The specific characteristics invite identification.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners adopt yogic personas. "I'm body-separation type" congeals into identity. The emptiness of all typologies is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Yoga-type as spiritual identity
- Comparing "yoga-levels" with others
- Missing that the five describe one nature, not five types

**Cascade effects:**
<persona-adoption> → being the yogin
<type-competition> → my yoga vs yours
<identity-fixation> → I am this type
<recognition-prevention> → role obscures nature

[1892-1909] <vessel-qualification-elitism> <snod-ldan-exclusivity>
**Misreading:**
The "eight qualifications of suitable vessel" (*brgyad ldan*) interpreted as establishing elite criteria—only special, pre-selected individuals can receive Dzogchen teachings.

**Why it arises:**
"Suitable vessel" suggests qualification. Elitism appeals to spiritual ambition. Eightfold criteria sound like entrance requirements. Esoteric traditions use exclusivity.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen congeals into exclusive club. Practitioners either develop pride ("I'm qualified") or shame ("I'm not worthy"). The universal availability is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Gatekeeping by teachers: "You're not ready"
- Self-exclusion: "I don't meet the qualifications"
- Spiritual pride in being "suitable vessel"
- Missing that nature is equally present in all

**Cascade effects:**
<elitism> → special qualification
<exclusion-anxiety> → not good enough
<pride-shame-cycle> → worthy vs unworthy
<recognition-prevention> → access denied

[1910-1925] <faith-reification> <dad-pa-accumulation>
**Misreading:**
The emphasis on "great faith" (*dad pa che*) interpreted as emotional state to cultivate—believing harder, trusting more, as prerequisite for practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Faith" suggests belief. "Great" implies quantity. Religious traditions emphasize faith. Insecurity seeks validation through belief.

**Primary consequence:**
Faith congeals into commodity to acquire. Practitioners try to "have more faith," measuring emotional intensity. The natural confidence of recognition is replaced by belief-effort.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Self-judgment: "I don't have enough faith"
- Attempting to manufacture emotional states
- Confusing doubt with lack of faith
- Missing that recognition transcends belief/disbelief

**Cascade effects:**
<faith-accumulation> → getting more belief
<emotional-manufacturing> → creating feelings
<doubt-anxiety> → losing faith
<recognition-prevention> → seeking confidence

[1926-1940] <effort-cultivation> <brtson-grus-development>
**Misreading:**
The "great effort" (*brtson 'grus che*) interpreted as requiring hard work, striving, and disciplined practice to generate sufficient spiritual energy.

**Why it arises:**
"Effort" suggests exertion. "Great" implies intensity. Puritan work ethic. Achievement culture values striving. Fear of laziness.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice congeals into labor. Practitioners exhaust themselves trying harder. The effortless nature is replaced by striving. Burnout ensues.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Exhaustion from over-effort
- Guilt when not practicing hard enough
- Missing that recognition is already present
- Effort paradox: trying to be effortless

**Cascade effects:**
<effort-obsession> → working harder
<burnout-cycle> → exhaustion
<striving-paradox> → effort toward effortlessness
<recognition-prevention> → working for what is present

[1941-1955] <guru-dependence> <bla-ma-gus-pa-fetish>
**Misreading:**
The emphasis on "respecting guru" (*bla ma la gus*) interpreted as requiring subservience, worship, and absolute obedience to external authority figure.

**Why it arises:**
"Respect" suggests hierarchy. Guru traditions emphasize devotion. Authoritarian structures appeal. Uncertainty seeks external guidance.

**Primary consequence:**
Self-reliance is abandoned. Practitioners wait for guru's approval. The inner guru is ignored. Dependency replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Guru worship replacing self-recognition
- Authoritarian abuse vulnerability
- Inability to trust own understanding
- Missing that guru points to what is already present

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependence> → needing approval
<worship-obsession> → devotion to person
<disempowerment> → cannot recognize alone
<recognition-prevention> → looking outside

[1956-1970] <generosity-transaction> <gtong-ba-exchange>
**Misreading:**
The qualification "ability to give" (*gtong bar nus*) interpreted as material generosity—donating wealth, time, possessions as spiritual transaction.

**Why it arises:**
"Give" suggests donation. Religious traditions value charity. Merit-making through giving. Reciprocity expectations.

**Primary consequence:**
Generosity congeals into transaction. "I gave X, so I deserve Y." The natural openness is replaced by calculated exchange.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Strategic giving for spiritual ROI
- Pride in generosity
- Resentment when not reciprocated
- Missing that true generosity is recognition's expression

**Cascade effects:**
<transactional-spirituality> → giving to get
<merit-accounting> → tracking generosity
<entitlement> → deserving rewards
<recognition-prevention> → exchange obscures gift

[1971-1985] <moral-aversion> <sdig-la-dzem-pa-anxiety>
**Misreading:**
"Aversion to non-virtue" (*sdig la 'dzem*) interpreted as moral anxiety—fear of sin, obsession with purity, judgment of self and others.

**Why it arises:**
"Non-virtue" suggests sin. Moral frameworks create anxiety. Puritanical conditioning. Fear of bad karma.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice congeals into fear-driven. Practitioners obsess over moral correctness. Natural virtue is replaced by anxious avoidance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Moral scrupulosity
- Judgment of others' behavior
- Self-flagellation over past actions
- Missing that recognition naturally expresses as virtue

**Cascade effects:**
<moral-anxiety> → fear of wrong
<judgment-obsession> → evaluating behavior
<purity-pursuit> → avoiding contamination
<recognition-prevention> → fear obscures ease

[1986-2000] <samsara-revulsion> <khor-ba-skyo-ba-escape>
**Misreading:**
"Revulsion toward samsara" (*'khor ba la skyos*) interpreted as world-rejection, ascetic withdrawal, life-negation.

**Why it arises:**
"Revulsion" suggests disgust. Ascetic traditions value renunciation. Suffering aversion. Escape fantasy.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice congeals into world-flight. Practitioners reject life experiences. The natural play is replaced by avoidance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Depressive withdrawal
- Missing life's richness
- Spiritual bypassing through rejection
- Missing that samsara is nirvana when recognized

**Cascade effects:**
<world-rejection> → leaving samsara
<ascetic-obsession> → denying life
<depressive-spirituality> → everything is suffering
<recognition-prevention> → aversion obscures acceptance

[2001-2028] <special-aspiration> <chos-la-mos-pa-elitism>
**Misreading:**
"Aspiration for these teachings" (*chos la mos pa*) interpreted as special calling—only those with prior karma or unique destiny can access Dzogchen.

**Why it arises:**
"Aspiration" suggests calling. Elitist appeal. Past-life romanticism. Wanting to feel chosen.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen congeals into exclusive inheritance. Practitioners believe they are "old souls" or specially destined. Universal availability is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Spiritual narcissism: "I was destined for this"
- Exclusion of others as "not ready"
- Missing that nature is equally present in all beings

**Cascade effects:**
<chosen-one-syndrome> → special destiny
<exclusion-pride> → I'm meant for this
<karma-elitism> → past-life merit
<recognition-prevention> → specialness obscures equality

[2029-2050] <intellectual-suitability> <shes-rab-ldan-pa-criterion>
**Misreading:**
"Possessing wisdom/prajna" (*shes rab ldan*) interpreted as intellectual qualification—only smart, educated, philosophically sophisticated people can understand Dzogchen.

**Why it arises:**
"Wisdom" suggests intelligence. Intellectual pride. Educational elitism. Complex texts intimidate.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen congeals into academic subject. Practitioners believe they need high IQ or philosophical training. The simplicity of recognition is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Intellectual intimidation
- Over-intellectualization of practice
- Exclusion of "simple" practitioners
- Missing that recognition transcends intellect

**Cascade effects:**
<intellectual-elitism> → smart people only
<overthinking> → analyzing instead of seeing
<intimidation-barrier> → not smart enough
<recognition-prevention> → intellect obscures simplicity
