<ontological-error> <summary-closure-illusion>
**Misreading:**
Summary provides closure or completion of understanding.

**Why it arises:**
Desire for completion. Closure-seeking.

**Primary consequence:**
Premature conclusion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Stopping inquiry.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-error> → <closure-illusion> (thinking-finished) → <inquiry-cessation> (stopping-exploration) → <recognition-prevention-error> (conclusion substitutes for openness).

<trekcho-thogal-graduation-model> <khregs-chod-thod-rgal-progression>

**Misreading:**
Trekcho (khregs chod) and thogal (thod rgal) represent a graduation model—complete beginner-level cutting-through to qualify for advanced leap-over teachings.

**Why it arises:**
Educational structure suggests levels. "Cutting through" sounds foundational. Thogal appears advanced. Progression mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen congeals into graded curriculum. Practitioners view trekcho as "prerequisite" to graduate from, creating hierarchical relationship between two aspects of recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Viewing trekcho as "lower division"
- Waiting for thogal "graduation"
- Believing visions require "completion"
- Missing that both are simultaneous

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-thogal-graduation-model> → <curriculum-hierarchy> (level-system) → <graduation-anxiety> (waiting-for-advanced) → <recognition-prevention-error> (progression substitutes for unity).

<thogal-vision-accumulation> <thod-rgal-snang-ba-collection>

**Misreading:**
Thogal visions (thod rgal gyi snang ba) are experiences to accumulate and collect—the more visions one has, the more advanced the practice.

**Why it arises:**
Vision descriptions multiply. Accumulation mentality. "More is better" thinking. Experience-collection habit.

**Primary consequence:**
Thogal congeals into vision accumulation. Practitioners seek to "collect" various light phenomena, treating rang snang as acquisitions.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Collecting vision-types as trophies
- Quantity over quality of recognition
- Exhibitionism about experiences
- Missing that visions are empty display

**Cascade effects:**
<thogal-vision-accumulation> → <experience-collection> (vision-trophies) → <quantity-obsession> (more-is-better) → <recognition-prevention-error> (accumulation substitutes for essence).
