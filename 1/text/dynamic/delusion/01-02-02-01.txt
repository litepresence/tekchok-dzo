[1424-1453] [HELL LIFESPAN LITERALISM] [TEMPORAL TORTURE CALCULATION]
**Misreading:**
The elaborate lifespan calculations for hell beings—Reviving hell's 500 years where one day equals 50 human years, increasing exponentially to Unrelenting hell's kalpa-long suffering—interpreted as literal temporal predictions to fear and calculate—like cosmic prison sentences.

**Why it arises:**
Specific numbers create credibility. The progression from 500 to 16,000 to "one intermediate kalpa" suggests measurable consequences. The calculations feel like actuarial tables for karma.

**Primary consequence:**
Hell is temporalized as extended duration. Fear of future punishment motivates practice. Recognition is obscured by anxiety about kalpa-length suffering.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners obsess over karma-calculations. Morality becomes avoidance-therapy. Present recognition is sacrificed for future safety.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [DURATION OBSESSION] (counting kalpas), [PUNISHMENT ANXIETY] (fearing hell-time), [KARMIC ACCOUNTING] (calculating consequences), [TEMPORAL TERROR] (time as torture), and [FUTURE FIXATION] (worrying about later).

[1448-1453] [COSMIC CYCLING MATERIALISM] [AEON REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
The description of kalpa formation—twenty intermediate kalpas for arising, twenty for abiding, destruction phases—interpreted as literal cosmic history with measurable timelines—like geological epochs to study.

**Why it arises:**
"Twenty intermediate kalpas" sounds scientific. The four-stage cycle (arising, abiding, destruction, empty) appears systematic. The "three-thousand great-thousand worlds" suggests quantifiable scope.

**Primary consequence:**
Cosmic cycling is historicized as temporal process. Buddhist cosmology becomes competing creation narrative. Recognition is confused with understanding world-history.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners study kalpa-calculations. Dharma practice becomes cosmology-research. Present awareness is displaced by origin-stories.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [AEON OBSESSION] (studying kalpas), [CYCLING DETERMINISM] (trapped in loops), [COSMIC HISTORIOGRAPHY] (mapping time), [FORMATION FASCINATION] (how it began), and [DESTINATION ANXIETY] (when it ends).
