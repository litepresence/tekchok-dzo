[3721-3724] <ontological-error> [ARISING AS PRODUCTION]
**Misreading:**
The description of "various appearances arising causelessly" is interpreted as establishing that appearances are produced or generated without causes, implying they have independent self-nature.

**Why it arises:**
"Causelessly" (rgyu med) invites interpretation. In common language, "uncaused" suggests spontaneous generation or independent existence.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking spontaneous as self-existent. The practitioner believes appearances exist independently because they arise "without cause."

**Secondary consequences:**
Confusing causeless with inherent; eternalistic view of appearance; missing that "causeless" means not produced by other, not self-existent.

**Cascade effects:**
<eternalistic-error> through reifying spontaneous arising.
<ontological-reification> through "causeless" literalism.

[3725-3729] <dualistic-error> [ARISING VS LIBERATION AS SEPARATE]
**Misreading:**
The description of arising as wisdom and liberation as mind is interpreted as establishing two distinct principles—wisdom that appears and mind that liberates—rather than simultaneous self-arising/self-liberation.

**Why it arises:**
Grammatical parsing. "Arising is wisdom, liberation is mind" suggests two subjects. Dualistic mind separates what text presents as unified.

**Primary consequence:**
Splitting arising/liberation. The practitioner believes appearance happens (wisdom), then liberation occurs (mind).

**Secondary consequences:**
Sequential understanding; seeking liberation after appearance; missing simultaneity of shar-grol.

**Cascade effects:**
<temporalization-error> through sequential parsing.
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through separating recognition from appearance.

[3730-3735] <logical-error> [REASONING AS PROOF]
**Misreading:**
The use of logical reasoning (gtan tshigs) to establish Dzogchen view is interpreted as establishing Dzogchen through intellectual proof rather than direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Scholastic conditioning. Logical reasoning suggests philosophical establishment. Tibetan tradition uses reasoning extensively.

**Primary consequence:**
Intellectual conversion. The practitioner believes they "understand" Dzogchen through following the logic.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reasoning-mastery without recognition; philosophical Dzogchen; missing that reasoning points, not proves.

**Cascade effects:**
<intellectualism> through proof-focused reasoning.
<understanding-delusion> through logical comprehension.

[3731-3735] <extreme-avoidance> [BEYOND IS/IS-NOT AS POSITION]
**Misreading:**
"Free from is/is-not extremes" is interpreted as establishing "neither is nor is not" as the correct view—positioning non-extremism as highest philosophical stance.

**Why it arises:**
Meta-position habit. "Beyond extremes" sounds like higher-order position. Mind wants "correct" view to adopt.

**Primary consequence:**
Adopting non-extremism as view. The practitioner believes "neither is nor is not" is the right position.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Fourth position" fetishism; philosophical superiority; performative contradiction of asserting non-assertion.

**Cascade effects:**
<view-attachment> through adopting non-extremism.
<performative-contradiction> through asserting beyond-assertion.

[3732-3734] <naturalism-error> [NATURAL PURITY AS INNATE]
**Misreading:**
"Natural purity" (rang dag) and "primordially liberated" are interpreted as establishing innate essence that is naturally pure—like inherent cleanliness needing no washing.

**Why it arises:**
Essentialist habit. "Natural" suggests inherent quality. "Primordially" invites eternalistic reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying natural purity. The practitioner believes mind has innate pure essence that is always already clean.

**Secondary consequences:**
Essence-view of Buddha-nature; "already perfect" complacency; missing that natural purity is absence of artifice, not positive quality.

**Cascade effects:**
<essence-grasping> through reifying natural purity.
<eternalistic-error> through innate-essence view.

[3734-3735] <terminology-fetishism> [SELF-EXHAUSTION AS CONCEPT]
**Misreading:**
The phrase "self-exhaustion of basis-of-reference" (ltos gzhi rang zad) is interpreted as technical term denoting special process or state, rather than simple description of reference-point collapse.

**Why it arises:**
Technical terminology fascination. Unfamiliar compound terms suggest technical precision. Scholarly tradition privileges terminology.

**Primary consequence:**
Terminology-accumulation. The practitioner learns "ltos gzhi rang zad" as concept without recognizing what it points to.

**Secondary consequences:**
Conceptual mastery without recognition; jargon-display; missing that term simply describes absence of reference.

**Cascade effects:**
<intellectualism> through terminology-mastery.
<conceptual-fetishism> through technical vocabulary.
