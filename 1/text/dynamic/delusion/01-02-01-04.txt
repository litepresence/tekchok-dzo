[998-998] [INTOXICATION AS LIBERATION] [BLISS CONFUSION]
**Misreading:**
The perpetually intoxicated gods interpreted as showing that spiritual advancement brings continuous bliss, ecstasy, and altered states—like being high forever as reward for practice.

**Why it arises:**
Intoxication is pleasurable. "Perpetually" suggests permanence. The progression to altered states looks like transcendence.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual practice becomes drug-seeking. Meditation aims at blissful states. Recognition is confused with intoxication.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners pursue peak experiences. Ordinary awareness is rejected. Sobriety is seen as spiritual failure.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers [BLISS CHASING] (seeking high states), [INTOXICATION MIMICRY] (faking transcendence), [ECSTASY ADDICTION] (needing the buzz), [ORDINARY REJECTION] (despising normal mind), and [DRUNKEN DELUSION] (confusion as wisdom).
