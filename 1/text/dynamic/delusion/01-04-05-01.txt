[2849-2861] <false-conventional-misidentification>
**Misreading:**
"False conventional" (*log pa'i kun rdzob*) is interpreted as "everything is false," leading to nihilism, rather than "mistaken appearance" that still functions conventionally.

**Why it arises:**
"false" (*log pa*) suggests deception and unreality. If it's false, how can it matter?

**Primary consequence:**
Nihilistic dismissal of conventional reality: "it's all illusion anyway, so nothing matters." Missing that false conventional still operates by dependent origination.
[2862-2869] <true-conventional-accumulation>
**Misreading:**
"True conventional" (*yang dag kun rdzob*) is interpreted as virtuous actions to accumulate, merit to collect, positive karma to build up—treating spirituality as a bank account.

**Why it arises:**
"True" (*yang dag*) suggests valuable and worth pursuing. Virtue seems like a good thing to do. The ten virtues provide a clear program.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual materialism: collecting merit as capital, becoming attached to virtue, developing pride in one's goodness. Missing that even virtue is empty.
[2870-2872] <ultimate-truth-grasping>
**Misreading:**
Ultimate truth is interpreted as a special object of knowledge—the way things "really are" that can be known through meditation or philosophy.

**Why it arises:**
"Truth" suggests a correct description of reality. "Ultimate" implies the deepest, most fundamental level. Knowledge seems to grasp truths.

**Primary consequence:**
Emptiness petrifies into an object: something to understand, realize, or perceive. The subject-object structure is maintained even in "ultimate" knowledge. Meditation petrifies into an attempt to "see" emptiness.
