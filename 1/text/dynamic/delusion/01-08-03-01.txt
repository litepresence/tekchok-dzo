[10699-10699] [VIEW ERROR] [ADVANCEMENT FANTASY]
**Misreading:**
Reader adopts Practice - measuring progress error as a philosophical position or belief system, intellectually affirming it without direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Philosophical study habits project intellectual understanding onto direct recognition. The comfort of conceptual certainty supports position-adoption.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Practice - measuring progress error is direct perception, not philosophical position, is entirely obscured. Understanding replaces recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Conceptual pride replaces genuine recognition. Debates about positions poison communities. The intellect is fetishized over wisdom.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <ground-path-fruition temporalization>. View becomes position rather than recognition.

[10700-10709] [EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIALISM] [FUTURE ORIENTATION]
**Misreading:**
Reader seeks Practice - measuring progress error as a specific experience to be achieved and maintained, treating it as a goal to reach.

**Why it arises:**
Sensation-seeking psychology and peak-experience culture project onto spiritual practice. The desire for verifiable attainments supports experience-fetishism.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that Practice - measuring progress error is natural expression, not goal to achieve, is entirely abandoned. Seeking replaces finding.

**Secondary consequences:**
Experience-chasing leads to technique-switching and teacher-shopping. Disappointment when experiences fade leads to abandonment.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <progress tracking>. Subsequent experiences will be approached as achievements to collect.

PAGE BLEED AWARENESS:
This page discusses Practice - measuring progress error. Preceding page (247) established errors that carry forward—practitioners will approach this content through already-deluded lenses. Following pages (249+) contain related material that will be misunderstood through the cascade effects established here.

[10710-10719] [GROUND-PATH-FRUITION TEMPORALIZATION] [BREATH CONTROL]
**Misreading:**
Reader interprets View - establishing position error through temporal frameworks, believing it unfolds sequentially over time through practice.

**Why it arises:**
Linear time consciousness and developmental psychology impose sequential frameworks. The fear of missing steps drives temporal sequencing.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that View - establishing position error is timeless, never unfolding, is entirely lost. Time-based becoming replaces timeless presence.

**Secondary consequences:**
The present moment is perpetually sacrificed to future attainment. Practice becomes preparation rather than recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers all error types. The entire framework collapses into temporal development model.

[10720-10721] [PROGRESS TRACKING] [POSITION ADOPTION]
**Misreading:**
Reader understands View - establishing position error as a stage in a developmental sequence, deferring completion until prerequisites are met.

**Why it arises:**
Achievement-oriented psychology and hierarchical social structures impose staircase models. The desire for measurable advancement supports stage-fixation.

**Primary consequence:**
The teaching that View - establishing position error is already complete is entirely obscured. Becoming replaces being.

**Secondary consequences:**
Eternal studenthood replaces recognition. Practitioners defer 'advanced' practices indefinitely while obsessing over 'basics.'

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <experience substantialism>. Stages become substantial entities rather than conceptual designations.
