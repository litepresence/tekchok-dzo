<thogal-visualization> <light-phenomena-attachment>

**Misreading:**
The "light entering the mother's heart" (*ma'i snying gar thim pa*) and "entering the lap" (*pang du 'jug pa*) interpreted as actual visualized light rays moving through space to a physical destination, while avoiding the natural dissolution of display into awareness.

**Why it arises:**
"Entering" suggests spatial movement. "Heart" implies location. The practitioner visualizes light-travel and not recognizing the nature of dissolution.

**Primary consequence:**
Spatial fixation: light becomes object moving through space. The natural dissolution (*thim pa*) is replaced by directed visualization. Recognition is lost in technique.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Light-chasing: trying to "make" light enter
- What remains unseen: that dissolution is recognition itself
- Geographic confusion about "where" light goes

**Cascade effects:**
<thogal-visualization> generates <awareness-overlooked>

<trekcho-completion-achievement> <ka-dag-result>

**Misreading:**
"Liberated into the ground of ka-dag" (*ka dag gi sa la grol ba*) interpreted as achieving a final state of primordial purity through the completion of trekcho practice, creating a before-and-after narrative.

**Why it arises:**
"Liberated" suggests result of action. "Ground" implies destination. Linear progress narrative: "first trekcho, then liberation."

**Primary consequence:**
Trekcho-completion project: practicing to "get" to ka-dag. The ever-present nature is obscured by achievement timeline.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Future-orientation: "when I complete trekcho"
- What remains unseen: that ka-dag is immediate presence
- Practice-anxiety about "progress"

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-completion-achievement> leads to <ka-dag-future> [achieving presence] generates <progress-anxiety> [completion timeline] leads to <immediate-miss> [ever-present overlooked]

<citation-fetishism> <lung-dependence>

**Misreading:**
The citation from *Nyi zla kha sbyor* interpreted as establishing authority through textual reference, leading to dependence on scriptural validation rather direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
"From the Tantra" suggests proof. Citation implies authority. Academic/Sutric validation patterns: "The text says so."

**Primary consequence:**
Textual validation-seeking: "Where does it say this?" Direct experience deferred to textual authority.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Scripture-dependence over recognition
- Debating citations as opposed to seeing
- Failing to recognize that citation points to experience

**Cascade effects:**
<citation-fetishism> triggers <scripture-dependence> [external validation] triggers <experience-deferral> [text over seeing] produces <citation-debate> [argument over practice]

<bindu-materialization> <thig-le-vision-chasing>

**Misreading:**
The "extremely subtle light appearing from the heart" (*snying gar 'od shin tu phra ba cig 'char*) and "bindus appearing on the light-ray" (*zer thig de la yang thig le phra mo*) interpreted as actual visual phenomena to seek and observe, but not the natural display of awareness.

**Why it arises:**
"Light" suggests visible phenomenon. "Appearing" implies observation. The practitioner looks for lights instead of recognizing awareness-display.

**Primary consequence:**
Vision-hunting: seeking specific light-phenomena. Natural clarity is replaced by expectation of special experiences.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Disappointment when no lights appear
- Manufacturing visions through expectation
- The crucial omission: that display is awareness-nature

**Cascade effects:**
<bindu-materialization> generates <nature-missed>

- Sequential fixation: "I need to get mirror-like first"
- Overlooking that all four are aspects of single awareness
- Practice-anxiety about "getting" wisdoms

**Cascade effects:**
<four-wisdom-achievement> → <wisdom-collecting> [achievement checklist] → <sequential-fixation> [order anxiety] → <single-awareness-miss> [missing unity]

<blue-curtain-fixation> <mthing-ga-snam-bu>

**Misreading:**
The "blue curtain" (*mthing ga'i snam bu*)—the field of blue light—interpreted as a specific visionary target to stabilize and maintain, creating fixation on blue appearance.

**Why it arises:**
"Blue" suggests color to see. "Curtain" implies phenomenon. The practitioner stabilizes on blue but not recognizing mirror-like wisdom.

**Primary consequence:**
Color-fixation: obsession with blue field. The mirror-like nature is missed in favor of blue appearance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety about "losing" the blue
- Discrimination between good/bad visions
- The blind spot: that blue is self-display of awareness

**Cascade effects:**
<blue-curtain-fixation> creates <color-attachment> [fixating on blue] → <stability-anxiety> [maintaining vision] → <mirror-wisdom-miss> [missing nature]

**Primary consequence:**
Color-compartmentalization: treating five colors as separate things. The indivisibility of five wisdoms is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Cataloging visions: "I saw red, then blue..."
- The error obscures that colors are wisdom-display
- Preference for certain colors over others

**Cascade effects:**
<thig-le-five-color-fixation> leads to <recognition-blocked>

**Misreading:**
The equality wisdom (*mnyam pa nyid kyi ye shes*) interpreted as philosophical position about equality of all phenomena, leading to conceptual meditation on "everything is equal."

**Why it arises:**
"Equality" suggests concept. "Wisdom" implies understanding. The practitioner thinks about equality in contrast to resting in equal nature.

**Primary consequence:**
Conceptual-equality: "All is equal" as thought. The natural equality is replaced by philosophical position.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Intellectual pride: "I understand equality"
- Missing that equality is not a position but nature
- "Everything is equal" as dismissive bypass

**Cascade effects:**
<equality-wisdom-intellectualization> creates <conceptual-equality> [thought about equal] → <philosophical-pride> [understanding vs being] → <natural-equality-miss> [position over nature]
