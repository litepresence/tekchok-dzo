<thogal-visualization> <light-phenomena-attachment>

**Misreading:**
The "light entering the mother's heart" (*ma'i snying gar thim pa*) and "entering the lap" (*pang du 'jug pa*) interpreted as actual visualized light rays moving through space to a physical destination, rather than the natural dissolution of display into awareness.

**Why it arises:**
"Entering" suggests spatial movement. "Heart" implies location. The practitioner visualizes light-travel rather than recognizing the nature of dissolution.

**Primary consequence:**
Spatial fixation: light congeals into object moving through space. The natural dissolution (*thim pa*) is replaced by directed visualization. Recognition is lost in technique.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Light-chasing: trying to "make" light enter
- Missing that dissolution is recognition itself
- Geographic confusion about "where" light goes

**Cascade effects:**
<thogal-visualization> → <spatial-fixation> [light as moving object] → <dissolution-miss> [missing natural recognition] → <technique-obsession> [doing vs being]

[13706-13726] <ontological-error>
<citation-fetishism> <lung-dependence>

**Misreading:**
The citation from *Nyi zla kha sbyor* interpreted as establishing authority through textual reference, leading to dependence on scriptural validation rather than direct recognition.

**Why it arises:**
"From the Tantra" suggests proof. Citation implies authority. Academic/Sutric validation patterns: "says so."

**Primary consequence:**
Textual validation-seeking: "Where does it say this?" Direct experience deferred to textual authority.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Scripture-dependence over recognition
- Debating citations rather than seeing
- Missing that citation points to experience

**Cascade effects:**
<citation-fetishism> → <scripture-dependence> [external validation] → <experience-deferral> [text over seeing] → <citation-debate> [argument over practice]

[13724-13733] <ontological-error>
<bindu-materialization> <thig-le-vision-chasing>

**Misreading:**
The "extremely subtle light appearing from the heart" (*snying gar 'od shin tu phra ba cig 'char*) and "bindus appearing on the light-ray" (*zer thig de la yang thig le phra mo*) interpreted as actual visual phenomena to seek and observe, rather than the natural display of awareness.

**Why it arises:**
"Light" suggests visible phenomenon. "Appearing" implies observation. The practitioner looks for lights rather than recognizing awareness-display.

**Primary consequence:**
Vision-hunting: seeking specific light-phenomena. Natural clarity is replaced by expectation of special experiences.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Disappointment when no lights appear
- Manufacturing visions through expectation
- Missing that display is awareness-nature

**Cascade effects:**
<bindu-materialization> → <vision-chasing> [seeking lights] → <expectation-manufacturing> [creating experiences] → <natural-display-miss> [awareness overlooked]

<four-wisdom-achievement> <ye-shes-bzhi-practice>

**Misreading:**
The four wisdoms (*ye shes bzhi*)—mirror-like, equality, discrimination, all-accomplishing—interpreted as four attainments to achieve through practice, creating checklist mentality.

**Why it arises:**
"Four" suggests set to complete. "Wisdom" implies achievement. Educational/career progress models: "master one, then the next."

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom-collecting: treating the four as achievements to unlock. Natural wisdom is obscured by pursuit.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Sequential fixation: "I need to get mirror-like first"
- Missing that all four are aspects of single awareness
- Practice-anxiety about "getting" wisdoms

**Cascade effects:**
<four-wisdom-achievement> → <wisdom-collecting> [achievement checklist] → <sequential-fixation> [order anxiety] → <single-awareness-miss> [missing unity]

[13737-13754] <ontological-error>
<blue-curtain-fixation> <mthing-ga-snam-bu>

**Misreading:**
The "blue curtain" (*mthing ga'i snam bu*)—the field of blue light—interpreted as a specific visionary target to stabilize and maintain, creating fixation on blue appearance.

**Why it arises:**
"Blue" suggests color to see. "Curtain" implies phenomenon. The practitioner stabilizes on blue rather than recognizing mirror-like wisdom.

**Primary consequence:**
Color-fixation: obsession with blue field. The mirror-like nature is missed in favor of blue appearance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety about "losing" the blue
- Discrimination between good/bad visions
- Missing that blue is self-display of awareness

**Cascade effects:**
<blue-curtain-fixation> → <color-attachment> [fixating on blue] → <stability-anxiety> [maintaining vision] → <mirror-wisdom-miss> [missing nature]

[13744-13784] <ontological-error>
<wisdom-radiance-addiction> <ye-shes-gting-gdangs>

**Misreading:**
The "wisdom depth-radiance" (*ye shes kyi gting gdangs*) interpreted as special luminous intensity to cultivate and increase, creating attachment to clarity states.

**Why it arises:**
"Radiance" suggests light to increase. "Depth" implies profundity. The practitioner seeks to "deepen" radiance.

**Primary consequence:**
Radiance-chasing: seeking and maintaining luminous experiences. Natural luminosity is obscured by pursuit.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety about "losing" radiance
- Rejection of "dim" states
- Missing that all experience is wisdom-display

**Cascade effects:**
<wisdom-radiance-addiction> → <radiance-chasing> [seeking intensity] → <clarity-anxiety> [losing it] → <natural-luminosity-miss> [all is wisdom]

[13751-13784] <ontological-error>
<thig-le-five-color-fixation> <kha-dog-lnga-compartmentalization>

**Misreading:**
The bindus with five colors (*thig le 'od lnga*) interpreted as five distinct phenomena to be seen separately, creating compartmentalized vision-obsession about color arrangement.

**Why it arises:**
"Five" suggests enumeration. "Colors" implies distinct phenomena. The practitioner catalogs colors rather than recognizing five-wisdom unity.

**Primary consequence:**
Color-compartmentalization: treating five colors as separate things. The indivisibility of five wisdoms is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Cataloging visions: "I saw red, then blue..."
- Missing that colors are wisdom-display
- Preference for certain colors over others

**Cascade effects:**
<thig-le-five-color-fixation> → <color-compartmentalization> [separate phenomena] → <vision-cataloging> [inventory of sights] → <wisdom-unity-miss> [indivisibility lost]

[13764-13784] <ontological-error>
<mirror-analogy-misunderstanding> <me-long-externalization>

**Misreading:**
The mirror-like wisdom (*me long lta bu'i ye shes*) interpreted through the analogy of actual mirrors and reflections, creating dualism between "mirror" (awareness) and "reflections" (appearances).

**Why it arises:**
"Mirror" suggests physical object. "Reflection" implies image. The practitioner seeks the "pure" mirror apart from "impure" reflections.

**Primary consequence:**
Mirror-fetish: seeking awareness apart from appearances. The indivisibility of mirror and reflection is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Rejection of appearances to find "pure" awareness
- Dualistic meditation: "rest in the mirror"
- Missing that mirror IS the reflections

**Cascade effects:**
<mirror-analogy-misunderstanding> → <mirror-fetish> [pure awareness apart] → <appearance-rejection> [seeking behind reflections] → <indivisibility-miss> [dualistic meditation]

[13776-13816] <ontological-error>
<equality-wisdom-intellectualization> <mnyam-nyid-conceptualization>

**Misreading:**
The equality wisdom (*mnyam pa nyid kyi ye shes*) interpreted as philosophical position about equality of all phenomena, leading to conceptual meditation on "everything is equal."

**Why it arises:**
"Equality" suggests concept. "Wisdom" implies understanding. The practitioner thinks about equality rather than resting in equal nature.

**Primary consequence:**
Conceptual-equality: "All is equal" as thought. The natural equality is replaced by philosophical position.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Intellectual pride: "I understand equality"
- Missing that equality is not a position but nature
- "Everything is equal" as dismissive bypass

**Cascade effects:**
<equality-wisdom-intellectualization> → <conceptual-equality> [thought about equal] → <philosophical-pride> [understanding vs being] → <natural-equality-miss> [position over nature]

[13798-13816] <ontological-error>
<discrimination-wisdom-analytical-obsession> <so-sor-rtog-pa-investigation>

**Misreading:**
The discrimination wisdom (*so sor rtog pa'i ye shes*) interpreted as analytical investigation of phenomena, leading to obsessive discernment practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Discrimination" suggests analysis. "Wisdom" implies understanding. Analytical traditions emphasize investigation.

**Primary consequence:**
Analytical-obsession: endless investigation of appearances. The natural discernment is replaced by compulsive analysis.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Intellectual proliferation about phenomena
- Missing that discrimination is spontaneous
- Deferring recognition until "analysis complete"

**Cascade effects:**
<discrimination-wisdom-analytical-obsession> → <analytical-compulsion> [investigation obsession] → <spontaneous-discernment-miss> [natural clarity overlooked] → <intellectual-proliferation> [thinking vs seeing]

<all-accomplishing-incomplete> <bya-grub-rtsal-ma-rdzogs>

**Misreading:**
The all-accomplishing wisdom (*bya ba grub pa'i ye shes*) appearing "incomplete" (*rtsal ma rdzogs*) interpreted as failure to achieve full enlightenment, creating deficiency-anxiety about "unfinished" practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Incomplete" suggests lack. "Accomplishing" implies results. Achievement mindset: "I'm not done yet."

**Primary consequence:**
Deficiency-anxiety: "My wisdom is incomplete." Natural completeness is obscured by sense of lack.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Future-fixation: "when completion comes"
- Missing that incompleteness is display
- Practice-anxiety about "getting there"

**Cascade effects:**
<all-accomplishing-incomplete> → <deficiency-anxiety> [sense of lack] → <future-fixation> [awaiting completion] → <natural-completeness-miss> [already accomplished]

[13820-13856] <ontological-error>
<spontaneous-presence-achievement> <lhun-grub-rin-po-che>

**Misreading:**
The "jewel-like appearance of spontaneous presence" (*lhun grub rin po che'i snang ba*) interpreted as precious visionary attainment to achieve through practice, commodifying lhun-grub.

**Why it arises:**
"Jewel" suggests value. "Spontaneous" implies effortless goal. The practitioner seeks to "get" spontaneous presence.

**Primary consequence:**
Lhun-grub-commodification: treating spontaneous presence as product. Natural spontaneity is obscured by acquisition.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Getting" what is already present
- Practice as production of lhun-grub
- Missing that spontaneity cannot be achieved

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneous-presence-achievement> → <lhun-grub-commodification> [product to acquire] → <production-mentality> [making spontaneity] → <natural-spontaneity-miss> [achievement paradox]

[13850-13896] <ontological-error>
<eight-arising-modes-cataloging> <shar-lugs-brgyad-obsession>

**Misreading:**
The eight modes of arising (*shar lugs brgyad*) interpreted as eight distinct visionary patterns to identify and catalog, creating taxonomic obsession about appearance-types.

**Why it arises:**
"Eight" suggests list to master. "Modes" implies categories. Scholarly/list-making mind catalogs experiences.

**Primary consequence:**
Taxonomic-obsession: "Which mode is this?" The natural arising is missed in favor of classification.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Cataloging visions rather than recognizing
- Pride in "identifying" eight modes
- Missing that modes are single display

**Cascade effects:**
<eight-arising-modes-cataloging> → <taxonomic-obsession> [classification mania] → <vision-cataloging> [inventory over recognition] → <single-display-miss> [modes as one]

[13857-13896] <ontological-error>
<compassion-appearance-attachment> <thugs-rje-fixation>

<sambhogakaya-wrathful-peaceful-dualism> <longs-sku-khro-zhi-separation>

**Misreading:**
The wrathful (*khro bo*) and peaceful (*zhi ba*) sambhogakaya displays interpreted as two distinct types of appearance requiring different responses, creating dualistic approach to kayas.

**Why it arises:**
"Wrathful" suggests danger. "Peaceful" implies safety. Dualistic pattern: good vs bad appearances.

**Primary consequence:**
Kaya-dualism: different approaches to wrathful/peaceful. The single nature of both displays is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Fear of wrathful, preference for peaceful
- Different practices for different kayas
- Missing that both are self-display

**Cascade effects:**
<sambhogakaya-wrathful-peaceful-dualism> → <kaya-dualism> [different responses] → <wrathful-fear> [danger perception] → <single-nature-miss> [both are display]

**Misreading:**
The "arrow of mahapradzna shot without return" (*dpag chen gyi mda' phyir 'phangs pa thogs med du song*) interpreted as aggressive forceful intervention to "shoot through" obstacles, creating violent approach to recognition.

**Why it arises:**
"Arrow" suggests weapon. "Shot" implies action. Warrior mentality: "penetrate to the truth."

**Primary consequence:**
Aggressive-intervention: forcing recognition. The natural non-return is replaced by violent effort.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Battle mentality toward mind
- Forcing clarity rather than allowing
- Missing that non-return is natural, not forced

**Cascade effects:**
<mahapradzna-arrow-literalization> → <aggressive-intervention> [forcing recognition] → <battle-mentality> [war with mind] → <natural-non-return-miss> [effort vs allowing]

<rainbow-body-materialization> <lu-gu-rgyud-physicalization>

**Misreading:**
The rainbow body (*lu gu rgyud*) and light-phenomena interpreted as physical transformation to achieve, creating body-obsession about dissolution signs.

**Why it arises:**
"Body" suggests physical form. "Rainbow" implies visible phenomenon. The practitioner seeks physical signs.

**Primary consequence:**
Body-materialization: looking for physical dissolution. Natural display is obscured by somatic obsession.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Physical-sign fixation: "Is my body dissolving?"
- Missing that rainbow body is nature of form
- Somatic anxiety about dissolution markers

**Cascade effects:**
<rainbow-body-materialization> → <physical-sign-fixation> [body observation] → <somatic-anxiety> [dissolution monitoring] → <natural-display-miss> [form as display]

**Primary consequence:**
Visionary-dependence: waiting for guru appearance. Self-recognition is deferred to external manifestation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Missing that guru-appearance is self-display
- Disappointment when guru doesn't appear
- External seeking rather than recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<guru-vision-dependence> → <visionary-dependence> [waiting for appearance] → <self-recognition-deferral> [external vs internal] → <appearance-disappointment> [missing nature]

- Missing that view is immediate seeing
- Thinking about view rather than resting in it

**Cascade effects:**
<view-recollection-intellectualization> → <conceptual-rehearsal> [mental repetition] → <philosophical-pride> [knowing vs seeing] → <immediate-view-miss> [thinking over being]
