[3017-3023] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The description of "non-dual primordial wisdom" as ultimately existing with qualities is interpreted as establishing positive metaphysical entity—the true nature of mind as substantial ground.

**Why it arises:**
Positive language habit. "Exists," "wisdom," "qualities" suggest affirmative ontology. Fear of nihilism pushes toward reification.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying primordial wisdom. The practitioner believes there is a "wisdom entity" that is the true nature beyond appearances.

**Secondary consequences:**
Eternalistic view of Buddha-nature; substantialist Dzogchen; confusing descriptions of how things are not with what things are.

**Cascade effects:**
<eternalistic-error> through reifying wisdom.
<essence-grasping> through making buddha-nature substantial.

[3024-3027] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The distinction between nirvana with remainder (affliction-wisdom mixed) and without remainder (pure wisdom) is interpreted as describing progressive stages of attainment on the path.

**Why it arises:**
Developmental model. "With/without" suggests before/after. Purity language invites progressive purification interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
Chronologizing nirvana. The practitioner believes they progress from "with remainder" to "without remainder" through practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring pure wisdom to future; measuring progress by "purification level"; missing that both are descriptions of single nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through stage model.
<progress-tracking> through measuring purification.

[3028-3034] <epistemic-error>
**Misreading:**
The phrase "self-aware wisdom of one's own experience" is interpreted as establishing special perceptual faculty (rang rig) that directly accesses ultimate truth, bypassing ordinary cognition.

**Why it arises:**
Faculty-fetish. "Self-aware wisdom" suggests special knowing. Desire for direct access to truth without mediation.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying self-awareness as faculty. The practitioner believes "rang rig" is special consciousness that perceives dharmatā.

**Secondary consequences:**
Faculty-dualism (ordinary vs. wisdom perception); seeking "pure experience"; confusing self-reflexivity with recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<experience-substantialism> through faculty-reification.
<meditationism-error> through cultivating special perception.

[3035-3036] <hierarchical-error>
**Misreading:**
The mention of "autonomous and consequence" (Svatantrika and Prasangika) is interpreted as establishing two-tier system with Prasangika as "higher" view to be adopted.

**Why it arises:**
Tibetan doxographical conditioning. Tibetan tradition ranks Prasangika above Svatantrika. Dzogchen practitioners assume their view is "highest."

**Primary consequence:**
Hierarchical view-adoption. The practitioner believes they should hold "consequence" (Prasangika) view as superior.

**Secondary consequences:**
View-identity ("I am Prasangika"); debates about which is "really" ultimate; missing that both are pedagogical approaches.

**Cascade effects:**
<view-attachment> through adopting positions.
<sectarianism> through hierarchical ranking.
