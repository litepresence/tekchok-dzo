<logical-obsession> [PERMANENCE/IMPERMANENCE DEBATE AS CRUCIAL]
**Misreading:**
The philosophical debate about permanence and impermanence is interpreted as establishing this as a crucial doctrinal issue requiring correct philosophical position.

**Why it arises:**
Scholastic conditioning. Debates seem important in traditional context. Wanting "correct" view.

**Primary consequence:**
Debate-prioritization. The practitioner believes winning this argument matters for realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Intellectual combat; missing that both extremes are to be transcended, not debated.

**Cascade effects:**
<intellectualism> through debate-focus.
<view-attachment> through position-defense.

<absurdum-reduction> [ABSURD CONCLUSIONS AS REFUTATION]
**Misreading:**
The reductio ad absurdum (rabbit horns, barren woman's son) is interpreted as definitive proof that samsara is illusory, rather than pedagogical tool.

**Why it arises:**
Logical literalism. Absurd examples seem like proof. Western philosophical training.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking absurdity as ontology. The practitioner believes these examples establish metaphysical claims.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ontological nihilism; absurdity-fetishism; missing that examples illustrate dependent origination.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through example-literalism.
<nihilistic-error> through absurdity-as-proof.

<assertion-phobia> [NON-ASSERTION AS POSITION]
**Misreading:**
The citation about "without assertions" is interpreted as establishing non-assertion as the correct philosophical position.

**Why it arises:**
Meta-position habit. "No assertion" sounds sophisticated. Fear of being wrong.

**Primary consequence:**
Performative contradiction. The practitioner asserts non-assertion as view.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Beyond all views" as identity; philosophical paralysis; missing that non-assertion is release, not stance.

**Cascade effects:**
<performative-contradiction> through asserting non-assertion.
<view-attachment> through meta-position.

<appearance-dualism> [OUTER/INNER AS ONTOLOGICAL]
**Misreading:**
The question of whether appearances are "outer appearance or inner consciousness" is interpreted as establishing ontological dualism.

**Why it arises:**
Subject-object habit. Outer/inner suggests dualism. Epistemological frameworks.

**Primary consequence:**
Dualistic appearance-theory. The practitioner debates idealism vs. realism.

**Secondary consequences:**
Philosophical dualism; missing that both are appearances; Yogacara vs. Madhyamaka debates.

**Cascade effects:**
<subject-object-dualism> through outer/inner bifurcation.
<philosophical-fixation> through appearance-debate.
