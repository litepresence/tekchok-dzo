<non-attainment-nihilism> <thob-pa-med-pa-negation>

**Misreading:**
"Nothing to attain" (thob pa med pa) establishes that there is no enlightenment, no liberation, and no spiritual result—absolute nihilism dressed in Dzogchen language.

**Why it arises:**
"Nothing" triggers nihilistic attractor. Negation language invites denial. "To attain" suggests there was something. Misunderstanding of emptiness as annihilation.

**Primary consequence:**
Nihilistic rejection of all spiritual possibilities. "Nothing to attain" becomes "nothing exists," leading to denial of path, fruit, and recognition itself.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Rejection of path and fruit as meaningful
- Spiritual apathy: "why practice if nothing?"
- Licentiousness justified by emptiness
- The crucial omission: that non-attainment is not denial

**Cascade effects:**
<non-attainment-nihilism> produces <recognition-blocked>

<trekcho-completion-fixation> <khregs-chod-mastery-requirement>

**Misreading:**
Trekcho (khregs chod) cutting-through practice must be completed, mastered, or perfected before one can advance to thogal (thod rgal) leap-over teachings.

**Why it arises:**
Pedagogical sequencing suggests prerequisite. "Cutting through" sounds like method to finish. Elitism around advanced teachings.

**Primary consequence:**
Trekcho becomes prerequisite obstacle. Practitioners obsess over "finishing" trekcho, measuring proficiency, waiting for thogal qualification.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Pressure to "complete" trekcho
- Comparison with "advanced" thogal students
- Believing one must "earn" visions
- The crucial omission: that khregs chod is recognition itself

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-completion-fixation> → <obscuration>

<thogal-vision-achievement> <thod-rgal-snang-ba-goal>

**Misreading:**
Thogal visions (thod rgal gyi snang ba)—light circles (thig le), Buddha families (rigs lnga), six limits (mtha' drug)—are achievements to work toward through practice.

**Why it arises:**
Vision descriptions are inspiring. Tangible results appeal. "Signs of success" language. Achievement culture.

**Primary consequence:**
Thogal becomes vision-achievement project. Practitioners practice specifically to produce light phenomena, treating rang snang as objective goal.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Practicing to "get" visions
- Anxiety when phenomena don't appear
- Believing lights indicate progress
- Not seeing that visions are natural display

**Cascade effects:**

- Believing ordinary dissolution = failure
- Secretly striving for special display
- What remains unseen: that 'ja' lus is spontaneous

**Cascade effects:**
<rainbow-body-aspiration-pressure> generates <rigpa-unseen>

<light-phenomena-addiction> <od-kyi-thig-le-dependency>

**Misreading:**
The light phenomena ('od kyi thig le) in thogal practice are special experiences to pursue, sustain, and become attached to as signs of success.

**Why it arises:**
Light descriptions are beautiful. Phenomena seem verifiable. Addiction to spiritual experiences. Confirmation-seeking.

**Primary consequence:**
Light becomes addictive pursuit. Practitioners chase light experiences, creating dependency on phenomena for validation.

**Secondary consequences:**

**Why it arises:**
"Perfected" suggests completion. Laziness seeking. Misunderstanding of lhun grub. Comfort-zone defense.

**Primary consequence:**
Spontaneous perfection becomes license. Practitioners use Dzogchen to affirm ordinary mind habits, creating complacent stagnation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Dismissing all effort as "dualistic"

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen becomes spatial trajectory. Practitioners view themselves as moving through ground-discovery, path-traversal, to result-arrival.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Viewing ground as origin point
- Seeing path as distance to cover
- Waiting for result as destination
- Missing that gzhi-lam-'bras bu are simultaneous

Lhun-grub becomes inherent attribute. Many assume awareness "has" spontaneous presence, creating subtle dualism of possessor and possessed.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Attributing qualities to awareness
- Believing lhun-grub describes "what is"
- Creating owner/attribute relationship
- Missing that lhun-grub is unfindable
