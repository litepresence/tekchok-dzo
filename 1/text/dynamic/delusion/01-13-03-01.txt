[16483-16498] <epistemic-error> [SENSE-PERCEPTION AS REALITY]
**Misreading:**
Sense perceptions (dbang po, yul) accurately represent external reality.

**Why it arises:**
Naive realism default. Perceptions seem to reveal objects.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking perceptions as evidence of external reality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reification of perceived objects.

**Cascade effects:**
[16499-16514] <ontological-error> [HOOK AS INSTRUMENT]
**Misreading:**
The hook (lcags kyu) is an actual instrument that grasps or pulls objects.

**Why it arises:**
"Hook" metaphor invites literalization. Agency attributed to tool.

**Primary consequence:**
Looking for hook as subtle structure.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that hook represents grasping nature itself.

**Cascade effects:**
<reification-error> metaphor literalism.

[16515-16530] <pedagogical-error> [SAMENESS AS IDENTITY]
**Misreading:**
Samsara and nirvana are the same (mtshungs) in the sense of being identical or one thing.

**Why it arises:**
"Same" suggests identity. Unity mysticism conflates sameness with non-duality.

**Primary consequence:**
Concluding that samsara IS nirvana without transformation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual bypassing and unethical behavior.

**Cascade effects:**
<nihilistic-error> "nothing matters."

[16531-16546] <reification-error> [MEASURE AS STANDARD]
**Misreading:**
The three measures (tshad la gsum) are objective standards for valid cognition.

**Why it arises:**
"Measure" suggests quantification. Epistemological frameworks seek criteria.

**Primary consequence:**
Applying external standards to direct recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Conceptual verification replacing direct seeing.

**Cascade effects:**
<scholarly-collapse-error>.

[16547-16563] <ontological-error> [SIZE VARIATION SUBSTANTIALISM]
**Misreading:**
The bindu varies in size (thig le che chung) as a literal dimensional quality.

**Why it arises:**
Comparative language suggests measurement. Spatial cognition.

**Primary consequence:**
Looking for large or small bindu experiences.

**Secondary consequences:**
Comparing and measuring experiences.

**Cascade effects:**
[16564-16571] <practice-error> [REALM-SPECIFIC BINDU PERCEPTION]
**Misreading:**
Different beings perceive different bindu sizes because of their karmic realm.

**Why it arises:**
Descriptive text invites literal interpretation. Six realms seem like places.

**Primary consequence:**
Believing bindu perception depends on rebirth status.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fatalism about present capacity for recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
[16572-16579] <pedagogical-error> [COLOR VARIATION OBSTRUCTION]
**Misreading:**
The five colors appearing differently in different realms indicate different bindu types.

**Why it arises:**
Color description seems like taxonomy. Variation suggests classification.

**Primary consequence:**
Identifying bindu by color characteristics.

**Secondary consequences:**
Sensory discrimination replacing recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] fixation on signs.

[16580-16588] <ontological-error> [THUMB-PRESS PRODUCTION]
**Misreading:**
Pressing thumb and finger (mtheb mdzub) together physically produces lamp appearances.

**Why it arises:**
Instructional language suggests technique. Physical gesture seems causal.

**Primary consequence:**
Manipulating body to force experiences.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that gesture is support for natural recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
[16589-16596] <epistemic-error> [EFFORT-EFFORTLESS DICHOTOMY]
**Misreading:**
Effortful (rtsol bcas) and effortless (rtsol med) approaches are mutually exclusive alternatives.

**Why it arises:**
"Or" (yang) suggests choice. Binary thinking default.

**Primary consequence:**
Choosing one approach and rejecting the other.

**Secondary consequences:**
Missing that both are pedagogical pointers.

**Cascade effects:**
<pedagogical-error> hardened positions.

[16597-16604] <reification-error> [CLEAR LIGHT AS EXPERIENCE]
**Misreading:**
Clear light appearing at night (mtshan mo 'od gsal) is a special nocturnal experience.

**Why it arises:**
"Night" suggests time. Luminous experiences occur in darkness.

**Primary consequence:**
Waiting for night practice for special experiences.

**Secondary consequences:**
Temporal conditioning of recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
[16605-16613] <ontological-error> [MIXED APPEARANCE LIBERATION]
**Misreading:**
Mixed appearance of light and darkness ('od mun 'dres pa) automatically liberates samsara-nirvana.

**Why it arises:**
"Liberated" suggests causal result. Description sounds like technique.

**Primary consequence:**
Seeking mixed appearance experiences.

**Secondary consequences:**
Chasing particular perceptual conditions.

**Cascade effects:**
[TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW] fixation on signs.

[16614-16627] <practice-error> <meditationism-error>
**Misreading:**
The bindus falling at the life-channel during pressing and the mixing of wind and light rays are specific techniques to be performed to generate visionary experiences.

**Why it arises:**
Technical physiological descriptions suggest procedural instructions. Western achievement-oriented frameworks seek techniques to produce results.

**Primary consequence:**
Thodgal becomes technique-driven practice focused on manipulating subtle body elements to force visions, rather than natural self-display of rigpa.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner develops obsession with "pressing" and physiological manipulation. Five lights become goal to achieve rather than self-arising display.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <reification-error> and <ontological-error>.

[16628-16642] <ontological-error> [LITERALISM ERROR]
**Misreading:**
The similes of peacock tail, vulture eye, fish eye, and cat eye describe literal anatomical structures or optical phenomena in the physical eyes.

**Why it arises:**
Comparative language suggests physical correspondence. Scientific materialist frameworks seek concrete anatomical correlates.

**Primary consequence:**
Four lamps are reduced to ophthalmological phenomena or retinal biology. Visionary experience becomes explainable as physical optics.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner examines own eyes seeking peacock-tail patterns or cat-eye reflections. Natural meditative experience is dismissed if not matching descriptions.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <medicalization error> and <scholarly-collapse-error>.

[16643-16656] <reification-error> <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The blue five-petaled bindu with light-rim is an actual entity or structure located in the subtle body that can be found and observed.

**Why it arises:**
Detailed spatial descriptions suggest objective location. Substantialist frameworks interpret all references as pointing to existing things.

**Primary consequence:**
"Lamp of pure sphere" is objectified as subtle body organ or chakra to be visualized or located. Rigpa is confused with bindu-appearance.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner searches for "snake-noose fence" in body or visual field. The metaphorical description becomes literal map to be followed.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <eternalistic-error> and <practice-error>.

[16657-16671] <epistemic-error> <psychologization-error>
**Misreading:**
"Whoever familiarizes" suggests that through repeated practice and familiarization, one can stabilize this vision and make it permanent.

**Why it arises:**
"Familiarization" (*goms*) interpreted as habituation or training. Psychological frameworks emphasize learning and conditioning.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition becomes skill to be developed through repetition. "Unfabricated essence" is pursued through deliberate fabrication.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioner accumulates "familiarization time" believing quantity produces quality. Natural state is confused with conditioned attainment.

**Cascade effects:**
Triggers <meditationism-error> and <eternalistic-error>.
