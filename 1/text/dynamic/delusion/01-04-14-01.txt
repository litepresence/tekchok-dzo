<mind-ultimate-reification>
The practitioner clings to *sems nyid* (sems nyid) as a truly existent ultimate truth, failing to recognize that even "mind itself" is a conceptual designation. They believe they have "found" the mind-nature through analysis, creating a subtle reification of the very ground (*gzhi*) they seek to understand. This is the error of treating the pointing finger as the moon.
Tibetan: sems nyid don dam du 'dzin pa - grasping mind-itself as ultimate reality
</ERROR_BLOCK_001>

<ERROR_BLOCK_002>
<gold-simile-materialization>
The gold/gold-color non-duality simile (*gser dang ser po*) is misunderstood as proof that the basis (*gzhi*) and its display are two separate entities that merely appear as one. The practitioner searches for the "gold" of the mind-nature as if it were a substance to be extracted from the impurities of samsara, rather than understanding the inseparability of appearance and emptiness from the beginning.

</ERROR_BLOCK_002>

<ERROR_BLOCK_003>
<practice-tradition-attachment>
The student becomes attached to *sgrub pa* (practice traditions) as ends in themselves rather than skillful means. They believe that accumulating more sadhanas (*bsgrub pa'i thabs*) equals more progress on the path (*lam*), measuring spiritual attainment by the number of practices completed rather than the depth of recognition. This creates a subtle pride in "my practice" versus "your practice."
Tibetan: sgrub pa'i lugs la zhen pa - attachment to practice traditions
</ERROR_BLOCK_003>

<ERROR_BLOCK_004>
<five-family-achievement>
The practitioner believes they must "achieve" the five Buddha families (*rigs lnga*) through deliberate effort, visualizing themselves transforming into Vairochana or Akshobhya as if putting on a costume. They treat the five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) as accomplishments to be gained in the future, missing the immediate presence of these qualities as the nature of their own mind.
Tibetan: rigs lnga'i sangs rgyas su byed pa bsgrubs pas 'thob par 'dod pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_004>

<ERROR_BLOCK_005>
<generation-stage-obsession>
The yogi becomes obsessed with *bskyed rim* (generation stage) details, spending hours perfecting the visualization of mandalas (*dkyil 'khor*), deity colors, ornaments, and hand implements. They believe that if the visualization is not crystal clear, no blessing can arise, creating anxiety and tightness where there should be natural ease. The generation stage becomes a prison of conceptual fabrication rather than a display of wisdom.
Tibetan: bskyed rim gyi zhal bzang la chags pa - attachment to generation stage aesthetics
</ERROR_BLOCK_005>

<ERROR_BLOCK_006>
<completion-stage-elitism>
The practitioner believes *rdzogs rim* (completion stage) is superior to generation stage, looking down on those who still rely on visualization. They claim to practice "formless meditation" while subtly maintaining a subtle image of themselves as advanced practitioners. This creates a dualistic hierarchy where completion stage becomes another object of attainment rather than the natural state.
Tibetan: rdzogs rim mchog tu 'dzin pa - conceit of completion stage superiority
</ERROR_BLOCK_006>

<ERROR_BLOCK_007>
<svatantrika-madhyamaka-debate>
The scholar becomes entangled in the Svātantrika (*dbu ma rang rgyud pa*) versus Prasaṅgika (*thal 'gyur pa*) debate, believing that understanding the logical distinctions between these schools constitutes realization of emptiness. They spend years mastering the syllogisms and refutations while their mind remains fundamentally unchanged, treating the finger pointing at the moon as the moon itself.
Tibetan: dbu ma rang rgyud dang thal 'gyur gyi rtsod pa la 'khris pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_007>

<ERROR_BLOCK_008>
<basis-path-result-sequentiality>
The practitioner views basis (*gzhi*), path (*lam*), and result (*'bras bu*) as three distinct stages in time. They believe they are currently "on the path" heading toward a future "result," not realizing that the path is the recognition of the basis and the result is the basis fully disclosed. This temporal misunderstanding creates the illusion of spiritual progress as a journey rather than a series of recognitions.
Tibetan: gzhi lam 'bras bu rim gyis 'byung bar 'dod pa'i 'khrul pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_008>

<ERROR_BLOCK_009>
<self-liberation-waiting>
Having heard teachings on *rang grol* (self-liberation), the practitioner passively waits for enlightenment to happen without effort. They believe that since everything is already liberated, no practice is necessary, misunderstanding "effortlessness" as laziness. This is the extreme of nihilism masquerading as the Great Perfection (*rdzogs pa chen po*).
Tibetan: rang grol la bzod cing sgrub pa mi byed pa'i phyogs lhung
</ERROR_BLOCK_009>

<ERROR_BLOCK_010>
<three-samadhi-achievement>
The practitioner treats the three samadhis (*ting 'dzin gsum*) - suchness, all-illuminating, and causal - as sequential achievements to be accomplished through force. They believe they must "do" the samadhi of suchness (*de bzhin nyid kyi ting nge 'dzin*) before moving to the next, creating a mechanical practice divorced from the natural flow of mind.
Tibetan: ting 'dzin gsum bsgrubs pa'i go rim la chags pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_010>

<ERROR_BLOCK_011>
<deity-yoga-identification>
In *lha'i rnal 'byor* (deity yoga), the practitioner identifies so strongly with the deity visualization that they develop spiritual inflation, believing they have actually become the Buddha. They mistake the imagined form for realization, developing subtle arrogance and looking down on "ordinary beings." The deity becomes a new ego-mask rather than a display of emptiness.
Tibetan: lha'i sku la bdag 'dzin bskyed pa - creating self-grasping in the deity form
</ERROR_BLOCK_011>

<ERROR_BLOCK_012>
<buddha-field-destination>
The practitioner views pure lands (*zhing khams*) as actual locations to be reached after death, like heavenly destinations. They pray to be reborn in Sukhavati or Zangdokpalri as if booking a ticket to a foreign country, not realizing that Buddha fields are the natural display of one's own purified mind. The spatial misunderstanding turns liberation into a change of address.
Tibetan: zhing khams phyogs su bgrod pa'i 'dod pa - desire to travel to Buddha fields
</ERROR_BLOCK_012>

<ERROR_BLOCK_013>
<sadhana-mechanical-recitation>
The practitioner performs *sgrub thabs* (sadhana) as mechanical recitation, believing that completing the required number of repetitions (*bsnyen pa*) automatically generates blessings. They accumulate mantras like coins in a bank, treating the practice as a transaction where quantity guarantees quality, completely missing the transformative power of authentic devotion and recognition.
Tibetan: sgrub thabs kyi ngag 'don gyi 'phred la chags pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_013>

<ERROR_BLOCK_014>
<ngondro-accumulation-pride>
After completing the preliminary practices (*sngon 'gro*), the practitioner develops pride in their 100,000 prostrations, mantras, and mandala offerings. They wear their ngondro completion like a badge of honor, looking down on those who haven't finished. The accumulation of merit becomes a source of ego rather than humility, completely defeating the purpose of the practices.
Tibetan: sngon 'gro'i grangs rdzogs kyi nga rgyal - pride in completing ngondro numbers
</ERROR_BLOCK_014>

<ERROR_BLOCK_015>
<mantra-phonetic-obsession>
The practitioner becomes obsessed with the exact pronunciation of mantras (*sngags*), believing that mispronouncing a syllable renders the practice ineffective or even harmful. They spend more time worrying about the pitch and tone than resting in the nature of mind. The mantra becomes a magical formula rather than a support for recognition.
Tibetan: sngags kyi ngag phyogs la zhen pa - attachment to mantra phonetics
</ERROR_BLOCK_015>

<ERROR_BLOCK_016>
<mind-ultimate-reification>
The student clings to the concept of "mind" (*sems*) as a thing that exists, believing that pointing to "mind itself" (*sems nyid*) captures the ultimate truth. They fail to recognize that even the label "mind" is a conventional designation, and that the actual nature transcends all conceptual categories including "mind" and "not-mind."
Tibetan: sems don dam par grub par 'dzin pa - grasping mind as ultimately existent
</ERROR_BLOCK_016>

<ERROR_BLOCK_017>
<gold-simile-materialization>
The non-duality of gold and its color (*gser dang ser po gnyis su med pa*) is materialistically understood. The practitioner searches for a "ground" (*gzhi*) as if it were a substrate underlying phenomena, like gold underlying various ornaments. They miss that the simile points to the inseparability of appearance and emptiness, not a metaphysical substance.
Tibetan: gser gyi dpe gtan la phab pa'i ngo bo nyid du 'dzin pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_017>

<ERROR_BLOCK_018>
<practice-tradition-attachment>
The student believes that belonging to a particular practice lineage (*sgrub pa'i lugs*) grants special protection or blessings unavailable to others. They develop sectarian pride, thinking "my teachers and practices are superior to yours," creating the very dualistic grasping that the teachings aim to dissolve.
Tibetan: sgrub lugs kyi khyad par du 'dzin pa - conceit of practice lineage superiority
</ERROR_BLOCK_018>

<ERROR_BLOCK_019>
<five-family-achievement>
The five Buddha families (*rigs lnga*) are approached as five separate achievements requiring five separate practices. The practitioner believes they must "get" each family's blessing sequentially, missing that the five wisdoms are spontaneously present as the nature of the five skandhas and five poisons from the very beginning.
Tibetan: rigs lnga re re bsgrub dgos par 'dod pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_019>

<ERROR_BLOCK_020>
<generation-stage-obsession>
The visualization of deities (*lha*) becomes an end in itself. The practitioner believes that clearer visualization equals more advanced practice, spending hours perfecting details while the mind remains fundamentally unchanged. The generation stage (*bskyed rim*) becomes sophisticated fantasy rather than the display of wisdom.
Tibetan: lha'i sku gsal snang la chags pa - attachment to deity clarity
</ERROR_BLOCK_020>

<ERROR_BLOCK_021>
<completion-stage-elitism>
The practitioner claims to be practicing completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) while actually just spacing out in dullness. They look down on structured practice as "inferior," not recognizing that without stable recognition, "formless meditation" is just ordinary mind-wandering with spiritual packaging.
Tibetan: rdzogs rim 'dzin pa'i sgyu ma - the illusion of holding completion stage
</ERROR_BLOCK_021>

<ERROR_BLOCK_022>
<svatantrika-madhyamaka-debate>
Intellectual mastery of the Svātantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction (*rang rgyud thal 'gyur gyi khyad par*) becomes mistaken for realization. The scholar can debate subtle points of Madhyamaka for hours while their emotional patterns remain completely unchanged, demonstrating the difference between philosophical understanding and transformative wisdom.
Tibetan: dbu ma'i gzhung 'dzin rtogs pa yin par 'khrul ba
</ERROR_BLOCK_022>

<ERROR_BLOCK_023>
<basis-path-result-sequentiality>
The practitioner waits for the result (*'bras bu*) as if it will arrive in the future, not recognizing that the "result" is simply the full disclosure of what already is. The path (*lam*) becomes a journey toward a destination rather than a process of recognition, creating the very distance that practice aims to dissolve.
Tibetan: lam gyi 'bras bu phyi nas 'byung bar 'dod pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_023>

<ERROR_BLOCK_024>
<self-liberation-waiting>
The teaching that all phenomena are self-liberated (*rang grol*) is used to justify non-practice. The student believes they can simply wait for liberation while continuing their ordinary confused patterns, failing to understand that self-liberation requires the recognition of that nature in the moment of arising.
Tibetan: rang grol bzod cing 'bad rtsol med par 'dod pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_024>

<ERROR_BLOCK_025>
<three-samadhi-achievement>
The three samadhis (*ting 'dzin gsum*) are practiced as if building a staircase to enlightenment. The practitioner believes they must perfect each samadhi before moving to the next, not recognizing that they are three aspects of a single recognition - the emptiness, the clarity, and the non-dual union.
Tibetan: ting 'dzin gsum rim gyis bsgom par 'dod pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_025>

<ERROR_BLOCK_026>
<deity-yoga-identification>
During deity practice (*lha'i rnal 'byor*), the practitioner develops a subtle sense of "I am the deity" as a new identity. They feel special or powerful, looking down on ordinary beings. This is just ego-clinging wearing a deity costume, the opposite of the recognition that deity and practitioner share the same empty nature.
Tibetan: lha dngos su gyur par 'dzin pa'i bdag 'dzin
</ERROR_BLOCK_026>

<ERROR_BLOCK_027>
<buddha-field-destination>
Pure lands (*zhing khams*) are sought as literal escape routes from samsara. The practitioner prays for rebirth in a Buddha field as if changing locations could solve the fundamental issue of misrecognition. They fail to understand that wherever you go, your mind goes with you - the "pure land" is the recognition of the nature of mind.
Tibetan: zhing khams gzhan na yod par 'dod pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_027>

<ERROR_BLOCK_028>
<sadhana-mechanical-recitation>
The sadhana (*sgrub thabs*) becomes a chore to be completed, like filling a quota. The practitioner believes that finishing the text equals finishing the practice, accumulating sessions like notches on a belt while the mind remains distracted and unchanged throughout.
Tibetan: sgrub thabs kyi ngag 'don 'ba' zhig byed pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_028>

<ERROR_BLOCK_029>
<ngondro-accumulation-pride>
The numbers of preliminary practices (*sngon 'gro*) become a source of competition. Practitioners compare their accumulation counts, with higher numbers implying greater spiritual attainment. The practice designed to generate humility instead becomes a foundation for arrogance.
Tibetan: sngon 'gro'i grangs kyi nga rgyal - pride in ngondro numbers
</ERROR_BLOCK_029>

<ERROR_BLOCK_030>
<mantra-phonetic-obsession>
The practitioner believes that Sanskrit pronunciation holds magical power, worrying that mispronunciation will anger the deities or nullify the practice. They focus entirely on external form while the inner meaning - the recognition of mind's nature - remains completely absent.
Tibetan: sngags kyi skad phyogs gcig tu 'dzin pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_030>

<ERROR_BLOCK_031>
<mind-ultimate-reification>
The concept of "mind itself" (*sems nyid*) becomes a subtle object of meditation. The practitioner searches for this "mind" as if it were a hidden treasure, not recognizing that the search itself is the mind, and the sought-after "mind" is already fully present as the searcher.
Tibetan: sems nyid btsal ba'i 'khrul pa - the delusion of seeking mind itself
</ERROR_BLOCK_031>

<ERROR_BLOCK_032>
<gold-simile-materialization>
The gold simile (*gser gyi dpe*) is taken to mean that the basis (*gzhi*) is a real substance from which appearances emerge. The practitioner conceptualizes "ground" as a metaphysical foundation, missing that the simile only illustrates the non-duality of appearance and emptiness, not a creation theory.
Tibetan: gser gyi dpe la brten nas gtan la 'bebs pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_032>

<ERROR_BLOCK_033>
<practice-tradition-attachment>
The practitioner believes their specific sadhana (*sgrub thabs*) is uniquely powerful, looking down on other methods. They develop a proprietary relationship with their practice, as if owning a special technique, when all practices are simply skillful means (*thabs*) pointing to the same recognition.
Tibetan: sgrub thabs khyad par can du 'dzin pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_033>

<ERROR_BLOCK_034>
<five-family-achievement>
The five Buddha families (*sangs rgyas kyi rigs lnga*) are approached like merit badges to be earned. The practitioner believes they must "become" each Buddha through effort, not recognizing that the five wisdoms are already present as the nature of the five aggregates (*phung po lnga*).
Tibetan: rigs lnga bsgrubs nas 'thob par 'dod pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_034>

<ERROR_BLOCK_035>
<generation-stage-obsession>
The generation stage (*bskyed rim*) becomes a test of mental gymnastics. The practitioner believes that holding complex visualizations proves spiritual advancement, when in fact the clarity of visualization has no necessary correlation with the depth of wisdom recognition.
Tibetan: bskyed rim gyi gsal snang rtsal du bton pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_035>

<ERROR_BLOCK_036>
<completion-stage-elitism>
The practitioner believes that completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) means stopping all practice and just "being natural." They use this as an excuse for undisciplined behavior, claiming all actions are meditation while remaining completely caught in ordinary confusion.
Tibetan: rdzogs rim rang bzhin du song ba yin par 'khrul ba
</ERROR_BLOCK_036>

<ERROR_BLOCK_037>
<svatantrika-madhyamaka-debate>
The philosophical distinction between Svātantrika and Prasaṅgika becomes a source of sectarian identity. Practitioners identify with one school against the other, not realizing that both are skillful means pointing to the same emptiness, and that philosophical affiliation is irrelevant to realization.
Tibetan: dbu ma'i grub mtha' la brgya phrag 'khyer ba
</ERROR_BLOCK_037>

<ERROR_BLOCK_038>
<basis-path-result-sequentiality>
The practitioner views enlightenment as a future state to be achieved after completing the path. They believe the basis (*gzhi*) is merely potential, the path (*lam*) is preparation, and the result (*'bras bu*) is the reward - missing that all three are simply perspectives on the same reality.
Tibetan: gzhi lam 'bras bu gsum dus gsum du 'dod pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_038>

<ERROR_BLOCK_039>
<self-liberation-waiting>
The teaching on self-liberation (*rang grol*) becomes an excuse for inaction. The practitioner believes they don't need to practice because everything is already liberated, failing to understand that self-liberation is only realized through the recognition of that nature, not through intellectual acceptance.
Tibetan: rang grol yid ches tsam gyis chog par 'dod pa
</ERROR_BLOCK_039>

<ERROR_BLOCK_040>
<three-samadhi-achievement>
The three samadhis (*ting 'dzin gsum*) are approached as progressive attainments. The practitioner believes they must master emptiness (*stong pa nyid*), then clarity (*gsal ba*), then non-dual union (*zung 'jug*) in sequence, not recognizing that all three are simultaneous aspects of the natural state.
