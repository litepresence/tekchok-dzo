[3341-3345] <ontological-error> [BASIS AS FOUNDATION]
**Misreading:**
The description of "basis" (gzhi) as cause of clarity and "mind itself as ultimate" is interpreted as establishing metaphysical foundation or ground of existence—a substrate underlying all phenomena.

**Why it arises:**
Substance habit. "Basis" suggests foundational reality. Metaphysical traditions look for ultimate ground.

**Primary consequence:**
Reifying basis as existent entity. The practitioner believes there is a "basis" that is the true nature of reality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Basis-fetishism; seeking "ground of being"; confusing pedagogical pointer with ontological claim.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-reification> through making basis into thing.
<eternalistic-error> through substantializing ground.

[3343-3343] <analogical-confusion> [GOLD/YELLOW AS ONTOLOGY]
**Misreading:**
The gold/yellow non-duality analogy is interpreted as establishing identity relationship where mind and its nature are "the same" ontologically, like gold and its color.

**Why it arises:**
Analogy literalism. Gold/yellow inseparability suggests essential identity. Western metaphysics debates substance/attribute relations.

**Primary consequence:**
Taking analogy as metaphysical claim. The practitioner believes mind and emptiness have "identity relationship."

**Secondary consequences:**
Ontological speculation about nature of mind; substance-attribute confusion; missing that analogy illustrates non-duality, not ontology.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through analogical literalism.
<essence-grasping> through identity-theorizing.

[3345-3346] <teleological-error> [BASIS AS OBJECT TO ACCOMPLISH]
**Misreading:**
The phrase "basis is the object to be accomplished" is interpreted literally as teleological goal—the practitioner must accomplish or realize the basis as future attainment.

**Why it arises:**
Goal-oriented thinking. "Accomplish" suggests achievement. Future-directed mind converts ground into destination.

**Primary consequence:**
Making basis into future result. The practitioner believes they must "accomplish" what is already the case.

**Secondary consequences:**
Temporal confusion; seeking what is already present; missing that "accomplishment" is recognition, not production.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through goal-orientation.
<searching-delusion> through seeking what is already present.

[3347-3354] <progressive-error> [PATH AS DEVELOPMENT]
**Misreading:**
The description of path ( entering liberation in sequence, stages of yoga path, great yoga body) is interpreted as developmental progression through stages toward realization.

**Why it arises:**
Path-literalism. "Path" implies journey. Sequential descriptions invite developmental reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Chronologizing realization. The practitioner believes they progress through stages toward self-liberation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Stage-obsession; measuring progress; deferring recognition to future "great yoga" state.

**Cascade effects:**
<progress-tracking> through stage model.
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through path-journey interpretation.

---

[3355-3361] <fruition-fetishism> [SELF-ARISEN WISDOM AS RESULT]
**Misreading:**
The description of "self-arisen primordial wisdom" and "all-knowing wisdom" as results is interpreted as establishing attainments to be achieved through practice.

**Why it arises:**
Result-orientation. "Result" suggests goal. Desirable qualities (all-knowing) trigger attainment-desire.

**Primary consequence:**
Making wisdom into acquisition. The practitioner believes they must achieve "self-arisen wisdom" as result.

**Secondary consequences:**
Seeking "wisdom experiences"; disappointment with "ordinary" mind; spiritual materialism of result-accumulation.

**Cascade effects:**
<experience-substantialism> through wisdom-fetishism.
<meditationism-error> through practice-to-obtain.

---

[3358-3361] <effort-confusion> [EFFORTLESSNESS AS TECHNIQUE]
**Misreading:**
The statement that result "cannot be established through effort" is interpreted as establishing "effortlessness" as technique—relaxing or not trying as method to achieve result.

**Why it arises:**
Technique-formation. "Without effort" sounds like instruction. Effort/effortlessness becomes binary method choice.

**Primary consequence:**
Making non-effort into effort. The practitioner tries hard to "not try" believing this produces result.

**Secondary consequences:**
Passive-aggressive practice; "letting go" as technique; confusion about spontaneous vs. cultivated effortlessness.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-fetishism> through method-formation.
<performative-contradiction> through trying not to try.

---

[3362-3369] <family-typology> [FIVE FAMILIES AS PERSONALITY TYPES]
**Misreading:**
The fivefold division of accomplishment (body/speech/mind/quality/activity → five families) is interpreted as personality typology where practitioners identify with specific family based on inclination.

**Why it arises:**
Typology fascination. Five families suggest categories. Personality typing is popular in modern spirituality.

**Primary consequence:**
Identity-fixation. The practitioner believes they are "Heruka type" or "Lotus family person."

**Secondary consequences:**
Limiting flexibility; family-elitism; missing that families describe aspects of enlightenment, not personality types.

**Cascade effects:**
<identity-fixation> through typology.
<practice-path-confusion> through family-limitation.

---

[3368-3369] <deity-fusion> [IDENTITY WITH DEITY AS LITERAL]
**Misreading:**
"Accomplishing each deity without duality through three concentrations" is interpreted as literal identity-fusion where practitioner becomes the deity ontologically.

**Why it arises:**
Literalism toward non-duality. "Without duality" suggests identity. Tantric visualization practices invite this interpretation.

**Primary consequence:**
Ontological fusion belief. The practitioner believes they literally "are" the deity after practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Grandiose identification; confusion between meditative state and ontological identity; deity-delusion.

**Cascade effects:**
<self-grasping> through deity-identification.
<grandiose-delusion> through ontological fusion.

---

[3370-3390] <terminology-obsession> [ETYMOLOGY/CLASSIFICATION AS KNOWLEDGE]
**Misreading:**
The detailed etymological explanations and classifications (tantra vs. upadeśa, generation/completion/union) are interpreted as essential knowledge that must be mastered before practice.

**Why it arises:**
Intellectualism. Etymology suggests deep understanding. Classification systems invite categorical mastery.

**Primary consequence:**
Terminology-accumulation. The practitioner studies classifications without entering practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pedantic knowledge-display; scholastic pride; missing that terminology serves pointing, not knowledge-acquisition.

**Cascade effects:**
<intellectualism> through terminology-mastery.
<preparation-paralysis> through studying before practicing.

---

[3390-3390] <container-palace-error> [WORLD AS MANDALA AS LITERAL]
**Misreading:**
The instruction to view "outer container world as celestial palace" is interpreted as establishing mandala-ontology where the world literally is or becomes divine palace through practice.

**Why it arises:**
Visualization literalism. Sacred geography traditions literalize mandala. Visualization practice invites ontological claims.

**Primary consequence:**
Mandala-mania. The practitioner believes world is "really" mandala and ordinary perception is false.

**Secondary consequences:**
Reality-denial; "pure vision" elitism; confusing perceptual frame with ontological claim.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-reification> through mandala-literalism.
<appearance-denial> through pure-vision superiority.
