**Misreading:**
The perfection of wisdom is understood as an intellectual achievement requiring extensive study of Madhyamaka texts, rather than direct recognition of mind nature.

**Why it arises:**
Intellectual bias. The practitioner equates understanding with realization. Scholarly achievement signals competence.

**Primary consequence:**
Study replaces practice. The practitioner masters Chandrakirti without recognizing mind nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Scholastic pride develops. 'I understand emptiness' replaces 'I recognize rigpa.'

**Misreading:**
The ten stages (sa bcu) of the Bodhisattva path are understood as mandatory sequential progression that every practitioner must complete in order, rather than fluid descriptions of realization.

**Why it arises:**

**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes stage-obsession. 'Which stage am I at?' replaces recognition.

**Misreading:**
The practice of the six perfections is interpreted as requiring the accumulation of vast quantities of merit over countless lifetimes, making immediate recognition impossible.

**Why it arises:**
Quantitative thinking. The practitioner believes more merit = better result. 'Countless aeons' suggests temporal distance from goal.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is deferred to future lifetimes. The practitioner believes they are 'working toward' enlightenment.

**Secondary consequences:**

The bodhisattva vow to save all beings is interpreted as a literal commitment that creates overwhelming burden and guilt when the practitioner cannot accomplish it.

**Why it arises:**

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner develops savior complex or guilt complex. 'I must save all beings' becomes crushing burden.

**Why it arises:**

**Primary consequence:**
The practitioner denies validity of all conventional practice. 'All is empty' becomes excuse for non-practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ethics are dismissed as conventional. Harmful behavior is justified by 'emptiness.' Spiritual libertinism develops.
