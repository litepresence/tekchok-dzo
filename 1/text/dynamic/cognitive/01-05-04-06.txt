[6424-6460]
Seventh Buddha manifestation enumeration. The Saṃsāra-destroyer king ('khor ba dong sprug rgyal po) appears in cosmological time scale of sixty-four hundred-thousand interval aeons ('dus gsum bskal pa bye ba phrag drug cu rtsa bzhi). Secret heart-essence transmission (snying po gsang ba'i brgyud pa) establishes the esoteric lineage. The strife-possessing aeon (rtod pa can gyi bskal pa) serves as temporal endpoint. Scriptural citation from gsang spyod sa bon gyi rgyud (Secret Conduct Seed Tantra) establishes canonical authority. Sixty-six inexpressible teachings (brjod du med pa'i chos drug cu rtsa drug) indicate teachings beyond conceptual formulation. View register: vast temporal scales as expression of Buddha's omniscience, not literal history.

[Extended Analysis: Cosmological Time Scale]
The sixty-four hundred-thousand interval aeons represent inconceivable temporal vastness. Structural function: establishing the authority of teachings through their antiquity. View register: time as non-linear, teachings eternally present. Translation risk: literalizing numbers as historical fact. Preservation: the vast numbers indicate "beginningless time"—not calculable history but expression of transcendence. The "interval aeons" ('dus gsum bskal pa) between Buddha manifestations demonstrate the rarity and preciousness of teachings.

[Extended Analysis: Secret Heart-Essence Transmission]
The secret heart-essence transmission (snying po gsang ba'i brgyud pa) indicates the most profound level of teaching—passed from heart to heart, beyond words. View register: transmission as direct recognition, not information transfer. Translation risk: "secret" suggesting elitist exclusion. Preservation: gsang ba means hidden in the sense of profound—visible to those with eyes to see, not concealed from anyone. The heart-essence (snying po) is the non-dual wisdom at the center of all teachings.

[Extended Analysis: Strife-Possessing Aeon]
The "strife-possessing aeon" (rtod pa can gyi bskal pa) indicates a degenerate time when conflict predominates. View register: teachings appearing even in difficult times as expression of compassion. Translation risk: "strife" suggesting specific historical period. Preservation: rtod pa means contention or conflict—indicating the challenges of the present era. That the Buddha appears even in such times demonstrates universal compassion.

[Extended Analysis: Sixty-Six Inexpressible Teachings]
The sixty-six inexpressible teachings are beyond conceptual formulation (brjod du med pa). View register: ultimate truth beyond language, yet teachings still given. Translation risk: "inexpressible" suggesting silence or absence. Preservation: brjod du med pa means cannot be expressed in conventional language—yet these are "teachings" (chos), indicating that non-conceptual truth is communicated through skillful means.

[Extended Analysis: Temporal Vastness Preservation]
The technical cosmological enumeration requires preserving temporal vastness without literalizing. View register: vast time as expression of dharmakaya, not historical record. Translation risk: numbers appearing as exaggeration or fantasy. Preservation: maintain the numerical precision—sixty-four, hundred-thousand—as indicators of inconceivable scope. The translation should convey awe without requiring belief in literal calculation.

[6461-6500]
Buddha enumerations six through twelve. Smṛti-protector (dran pa skyong ba) with self-remembering wheel mudrā (rang dran 'khor lo'i phyag rgya). Śikhin (gtsug tor can) at previous beginning. Yama-world-protector ('jig rten skyong ba) of thousand Brahmas. Thousand suns' king (nyi ma stong gi rgyal po). Jvalamukha (kha 'bar ma) with concealed heart essence (snying po sbas pa). Thousand light-rays' rim-protector ('od zer stong gi mtha' skyong). Progressive structure with specific names, attributes, retinues. Sequential mudrā transmission. View register: mythological specificity as skillful means, not historical record.

[Extended Analysis: Smṛti-Protector with Self-Remembering Wheel]
Smṛti-protector (dran pa skyong ba) embodies mindfulness, with mudrā of self-remembering wheel—indicating continuous awareness. View register: mindfulness as protection, not mere memory. Translation risk: "protector" suggesting external guardian. Preservation: skyong ba means protection through awareness—remembering (dran pa) the natural state protects from delusion. The wheel mudrā represents continuous cycling of awareness.

[Extended Analysis: Śikhin at Previous Beginning]
Śikhin (gtsug tor can—Crested One) appears at the previous beginning of an aeon. View register: Buddhas manifesting at each cosmic cycle's start. Translation risk: "previous" suggesting linear sequence. Preservation: gtsug tor indicates the flame or crest—this Buddha appears at the beginning of each creative cycle, establishing the dharma for that era.

[Extended Analysis: Thousand Brahmas and Thousand Suns]
The "thousand Brahmas" (tshangs pa stong) and "thousand suns" (nyi ma stong) indicate vast retinues and luminous qualities. View register: numbers indicating completeness, not literal count. Translation risk: thousand appearing as exact enumeration. Preservation: stong means thousand but also "innumerable"—indicating vast scope, not mathematical precision.

[Extended Analysis: Jvalamukha with Concealed Heart Essence]
Jvalamukha (kha 'bar ma—Flame-Mouthed) holds concealed heart essence—indicating the secret transmission hidden within apparent form. View register: profound teachings concealed in seemingly wrathful display. Translation risk: "concealed" suggesting deliberate hiding. Preservation: sbas pa means naturally hidden—not secretive but profound, visible only to those with capacity to recognize.

[Extended Analysis: Sequential Mudrā Transmission]
The sequential mudrā transmission (phyag rgya brgyud pa) indicates the lineage passing through symbolic gestures. View register: mudrā as non-verbal teaching transmission. Translation risk: mudrā appearing as hand gestures only. Preservation: phyag rgya means seal or symbol—the entire form, not just hands, transmits the teaching. Sequential indicates continuity across time.

[6501-6758]
Subsequent enumerations completing twelve Buddhas. Each with specific aeon (bskal pa), Buddha name (sangs rgyas kyi mtshan), retinue ('khor), and liberation manner (thar pa'i tshul). Comprehensive cosmological history establishing authoritative lineage. Technical enumeration demonstrating Buddha's omniscience through knowledge of all temporal periods. The twelve Buddhas span the vast temporal expanse, each manifesting with specific attributes appropriate to their era and the beings to be trained. View register: twelve as complete mandala, not historical list.

[Extended Analysis: Twelve Buddhas as Complete Mandala]
The twelve Buddhas represent a complete mandala structure—not merely a historical sequence but a symbolic completeness. View register: twelve as wholeness, not accumulation. Translation risk: twelve appearing as arbitrary number. Preservation: in Buddhist cosmology, twelve often represents completeness (twelve links of dependent origination, twelve divisions of scripture). The twelve Buddhas manifest all aspects of enlightenment.

[Extended Analysis: Specific Aeon, Name, Retinue, Liberation]
Each Buddha has four attributes: temporal context (bskal pa), identity (mtshan), community ('khor), and method (thar pa'i tshul). View register: each Buddha's manifestation tailored to circumstances. Translation risk: specificity appearing as historical detail. Preservation: the specificity demonstrates skillful means—Buddhas appear in forms and contexts appropriate to those to be trained.

[Extended Analysis: Comprehensive Cosmological History]
The comprehensive cosmological history establishes authoritative lineage through temporal depth. View register: authority through wisdom, not institutional succession. Translation risk: cosmology appearing as mythology. Preservation: the history is true at the level of meaning—Buddhas have always manifested and will continue to manifest. The specific forms are skillful means.

[Extended Analysis: Buddha's Omniscience Through Temporal Knowledge]
The technical enumeration demonstrates Buddha's omniscience (thams cad mkhyen pa) through knowledge of all temporal periods. View register: omniscience as knowing all possibilities, not accumulating facts. Translation risk: omniscience appearing as encyclopedic knowledge. Preservation: thams cad mkhyen pa means knowing the nature of all phenomena—not memorizing data but directly perceiving the empty, luminous nature of all possible manifestations.

[Extended Analysis: Preservation Without Literalizing]
The preservation requirement maintains sense of vast temporal scale without requiring literal belief in the numbers. View register: symbolic truth more important than historical accuracy. Translation risk: either fundamentalist literalism or dismissive rationalism. Preservation: convey the meaning—Buddha's wisdom is vast, teachings are ancient and enduring, manifestation is continuous—without requiring calculation of aeons.

[Structural Synthesis: Twelve Buddha Cosmological Framework]
This section (6424-6758) presents the complete cosmological framework of twelve Buddha manifestations spanning vast temporal periods. The architecture moves from the seventh Buddha through subsequent enumerations, each with specific attributes and contexts. The view throughout is that Buddha manifestations are continuous, tailored to circumstances, and demonstrate omniscience through their vast temporal scope. The translator must preserve the mythological specificity—the names, attributes, aeons, and retinues—while conveying that these are skillful means expressing profound truths, not merely historical claims. The sixty-six inexpressible teachings and secret heart-essence transmission indicate that beyond all these enumerations lies the non-conceptual truth that cannot be captured in numbers or names.
