The opening enumeration establishes the seventh Buddha manifestation within an immense cosmological framework. The structural function serves as temporal anchor, positioning the teaching within sixty-four hundred-thousand interval aeons, transcending ordinary historical conception. The Saṃsāra-destroyer king indicates a Buddha manifestation responsible for dissolving cyclic existence, while the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra citation provides scriptural authority. The passage transitions from general cosmological scope to specific lineage markers, including the strife-possessing aeon as temporal endpoint and secret heart-essence transmission as preservation method.

View register maintains that vast temporal scales express Buddha's omniscience rather than literal historical record. Cosmological numbers function as transcendence indicators, suggesting teachings emerge from beyond calculable time. The strife-possessing aeon represents the present degenerate era, demonstrating that profound teachings appear even when conditions are most challenging. Manifestation occurs across all temporal conditions, not merely during optimal circumstances.

Translation risks include literalizing numerical specifications as historical fact rather than expressions of inconceivable scope. The term strife-possessing may be misunderstood as referring to specific historical period rather than qualitative description of present era. Rendering of secret heart-essence transmission risks suggesting esoteric elitism rather than profound accessibility. Preservation conveys temporal vastness without requiring literal belief in calculations.

The cosmological framework establishes authority through temporal depth, yet this authority derives from wisdom rather than institutional succession. Numbers sixty-four and hundred-thousand serve as scope indicators rather than mathematical precision. Translation should maintain specificity of names and aeons while conveying that these represent skillful means expressing profound truths.

[6451-6480]
This section enumerates Buddhas six through twelve, each with distinct attributes, mudrās, and temporal associations. Smṛti-protector emerges with self-remembering wheel mudrā, embodying continuous awareness as protection. Śikhin appears at previous beginning, establishing the pattern of Buddhas manifesting at each cosmic cycle's commencement. The thousand Brahmas and thousand suns indicate vast retinues and luminous qualities, while Jvalamukha holds concealed heart essence within apparently wrathful display.

View register understands these mythological specificities as skillful means rather than historical records. The self-remembering wheel indicates awareness that protects through recognition rather than external guardianship. Thousandfold retinues express completeness rather than literal enumeration. Concealment suggests natural profundity rather than deliberate secrecy. The twelve Buddhas represent complete mandala structure rather than mere accumulation.

Translation risks include reducing mudrās to hand gestures rather than complete symbolic transmissions. The term protector may suggest external guardians rather than awareness-based protection. Thousand risks appearing as exact enumeration rather than vast scope indicator. Preservation maintains symbolic richness without requiring literal interpretation.

The sequential structure demonstrates continuity across vast temporal periods, with each Buddha establishing appropriate teachings for their era. Specific names and attributes serve as meditation supports, providing concrete forms for contemplation of enlightenment's multifaceted nature. Mudrā transmission indicates non-verbal teaching continuity, preserving dharma through symbolic gesture across inconceivable time spans.

[6481-6512]
This section provides detailed cosmological calculations and scriptural citations establishing Buddha's manifestation scope. Specification of nineteen hundred-thousand definite Buddhas condensing teachings indicates selective manifestation tailored to circumstances. Reference to Samantabhadra's time and Brahma's great aeon establishes supreme temporal markers. The Vairocana citation with lotus blossom imagery provides concrete visualization support while maintaining transcendence through sky-like spatial metaphors.

View register holds that Buddha deeds, qualities, and activities pervade space like sky, making them immeasurable even for tenth-ground bodhisattvas. Comparison to sky indicates unobstructed pervasion without limitation. Scriptural citations from Uttara Tantra and Jewel Heap Sutra establish canonical authority for these inconceivable attributes. Buddha manifestation exceeds conceptual measurement.

Translation risks include reducing sky metaphor to mere poetic language rather than indicating unobstructed pervasion. The term tenth-ground may suggest hierarchical spiritual attainment rather than advanced realization. Scriptural citations risk appearing as proof-texting rather than resonance with established wisdom. Preservation conveys that Buddha qualities pervade all space without limitation, accessible to recognition rather than calculation.

The cosmological mathematics serve to expand mind beyond ordinary conception rather than establish historical facts. References to Vairocana's lotus and Samantabhadra's time provide specific contemplative supports while maintaining openness. Scriptural citations demonstrate continuity with recognized authority while expressing ineffable qualities. Passage establishes that ordinary intellect cannot measure Buddha manifestation.

[6513-6550]
This section presents liberation statistics for Jambudvipa, enumerating beings freed through this life and intermediate state encounters with teachings. Text specifies numbers of male and female practitioners, monastic and lay, achieving liberation at various lifespan intervals. Statistics progress from one hundred thousand at sixty-year lifespans through two hundred thousand at fifty-year intervals to six hundred thousand at thirty-year spans. These figures demonstrate teaching's efficacy across different temporal conditions.

View register understands these statistics as demonstrating power of encountering definitive secret essence rather than establishing historical census data. Gender and lifestyle specifications indicate teaching accessibility across all conditions rather than limitation to specific groups. Numerical progression suggests increasing efficacy as lifespans shorten and conditions degenerate. Liberation occurs through recognition of nature rather than accumulation of practice duration.

Translation risks include interpreting statistics as literal demographic records rather than indicators of teaching power. Gender divisions may suggest differential capacity rather than recognition of diverse manifestations. Lifespan correlations risk appearing as causal relationships rather than contextual descriptions. Preservation conveys that liberation occurs through encounter with definitive essence regardless of demographic category.

The statistical enumeration serves to inspire confidence in teaching's efficacy while demonstrating its accessibility. By specifying numbers across different conditions, text establishes that liberation is available to all who encounter teachings sincerely. Progression suggests that teachings become more potent as conditions become more challenging, offering hope in degenerate times.

[6551-6581]
This continuation of liberation statistics specifies intermediate state liberation figures and emphasizes unique power of these particular teachings. Seven thousand meet light-mother in intermediate state, with six thousand male and one thousand female manifestations. Passage emphasizes that all who achieve Buddhahood do so through this teaching's time, recognizing awareness-nature directly. Result-heart encounter distinguishes this path from others, establishing superiority of direct recognition.

View register maintains that liberation in intermediate state occurs through prior connection with teachings, not through spontaneous occurrence. Light-mother meeting indicates recognition of luminosity at death rather than ordinary intermediate state wandering. Emphasis on all Buddhas achieving through this teaching establishes its definitive nature without negating other paths. Direct recognition of awareness-nature constitutes Buddhahood.

Translation risks include interpreting intermediate state liberation as automatic rather than requiring prior preparation. Light-mother may be misunderstood as external deity rather than recognition of innate luminosity. Teaching's superiority risk appearing as exclusivism rather than affirmation of direct recognition. Preservation conveys that intermediate state liberation requires prior connection and recognition capacity.

Statistics establish that liberation occurs through this life, intermediate state, or pure field emanation, providing multiple avenues for awakening. Emphasis on direct recognition of awareness-nature distinguishes this approach from gradual cultivation paths. Passage creates confidence that encounter with these teachings guarantees eventual liberation through one of these three modes.

[6582-6630]
This section presents vidyadhara lineage prophecy, beginning with Buddha's prediction of transmission holders after his parinirvana. Prophecy specifies Uddiyana's Dhanakosha as location, with god-princess as mother and fatherless Vajrahe as initial holder. Detailed succession continues through western direction brahmins, seventy-five year reigns, and various family lineages including outcastes and kings. This creates comprehensive transmission map spanning diverse social conditions.

View register understands prophecy as indicating inevitable continuity rather than fatalistic predetermination. Fatherless birth suggests immaculate conception of wisdom rather than literal absence of paternity. Diverse social categories demonstrate teaching accessibility across all conditions without hierarchy. Lineage holders appear in whatever forms best serve beings in each era.

Translation risks include interpreting prophecy as rigid prediction rather than pattern recognition. Fatherless birth may suggest miraculous exceptionalism rather than wisdom's self-arising nature. Succession timing risks appearing as literal historical schedule rather than organic unfolding. Preservation conveys that lineage continues inevitably through diverse manifestations.

The prophecy creates confidence in transmission continuity while demonstrating that holders appear in unexpected forms and conditions. By spanning outcaste, king, and householder lineages, text establishes that realization transcends social category. Seventy-five year specification provides concrete temporal reference while allowing flexibility in interpretation.

[6631-6672]
This section completes lineage prophecy and presents extensive praise of guru Kumaradza, describing his parinirvana and its miraculous signs. Autumn moon's first phase marks peaceful forest departure, with subsequent blessings and compassion described as exceeding others. Earth quaking with forests, five-colored light filling space, and musical sounds spreading create comprehensive description of sacred transition. Melting body-relics with blazing light rays and dakini offering clouds establish guru's exalted status.

View register maintains that parinirvana signs indicate wisdom accomplishment rather than magical display. Autumn timing suggests natural completion rather than tragic loss. Earth-quaking indicates widespread impact rather than mere physical event. Teacher's transition serves as final teaching demonstrating impermanence and luminosity.

Translation risks include interpreting signs as literal requirements for sanctity rather than expressions of profound transition. Praise may appear excessive to contemporary sensibilities accustomed to modesty. Miraculous descriptions risk dismissal as mythology rather than recognition of sacred process. Preservation conveys profundity of transition without requiring literal belief in specific signs.

The detailed description serves to establish guru's realization while providing contemplative support for understanding death as transformation. Five-colored lights and musical sounds create vivid imagery for meditation on luminosity. Passage affirms that even after physical departure, guru's influence continues through blessings and emanations.

[6673-6710]
This section describes seven lineage transmissions across pure fields and vast temporal cycles of teaching duration. Jambudvipa transmission passes through seven lineage holders before moving to beautiful arrangement pure fields for teaching spread and being maturation. After fortunate aeon's end and destruction of form, Samsara-eradicator aeon sees Buddha Wheel Lightning Garland holding sacred teaching, liberating beings from samsara until all return to original nature.

View register understands seven transmissions as complete cycles rather than limited duration. Pure field transitions indicate teaching movement to wherever beings have capacity to receive. Twenty thousand great aeons of non-appearance represent latent potential rather than absence. Teaching manifests whenever conditions support recognition.

Translation risks include interpreting seven transmissions as fixed limitation rather than complete cycle. Pure field movement may suggest geographical relocation rather than manifestation wherever beings are ready. Non-appearance period risks appearing as nihilistic void rather than latent presence. Preservation conveys that teaching cycles through manifestation and latency naturally.

This section continues cosmological prophecy from Sound Consequence Great Tantra, describing teaching's descent at Vajra Seat summit after seven pure field experiences. Self-arisen great syllable descends with sound across hundred million aeons, with Wheel Lightning Garland making conqueror appear. Progressive manifestation moves from speech duration through mind vajra to actual body descent across three hundred and five hundred year intervals.

[6711-6735]
This section describes teaching duration, retinue gathering, and eventual completion. Teacher's retinue includes twenty thousand noble hearers, with discipline teaching lasting one aeon placing foe-destroyers in result. Six darkness aeons pass before another twenty thousand foe-destroyers gather, with sutra teaching lasting eight aeons placing beings in provisional and definitive action ends. Miraculous power and control propel teaching completion across these vast periods.

View register understands retinue numbers as indicators of vast gathering rather than literal census. Discipline and sutra teachings represent gradual and sudden approaches appropriate to different capacities. Darkness aeons represent intervals between manifest teachings rather than mere emptiness. Teaching cycles through active and latent phases naturally.

Translation risks include interpreting numbers as precise counts rather than scope indicators. Teaching categories may suggest rigid hierarchy rather than skillful means gradation. Darkness periods risk appearing as absence rather than latent potential. Preservation conveys that teaching manifests and withdraws in natural cycles.

This section describes final liberation events where samsara is eradicated and beings obtain Buddhahood. After twenty thousand aeons, samsara's continuity ceases and embodied appearance becomes impossible. Action distinctions lead beings to take subtle forms from latent tendencies, eventually growing into form-possessing beings again. Teaching end remains thought-incomprehensible, with words merely indicating vast scope.

[6736-6758]
This concluding section presents guru interpretations regarding scope of liberation, addressing apparent contradictions between Samantabhadra-time liberation and Vajra-holder Brahma liberation. Some gurus consider that all beings in Samantabhadra's time are liberated, while others hold that all in Vajra-holder's Brahma are liberated. Text affirms both views as non-contradictory since Samantabhadra's compassion liberates all while immeasurable latent tendencies still arise from dimension.

View register understands two liberation scopes as complementary rather than contradictory. Vastest liberation recognition constitutes supreme goodness regardless of specific interpretation. Samantabhadra's compassion operates universally while individual karmic patterns continue manifesting. Liberation is both absolute and gradual without contradiction.

Translation risks include interpreting two views as competing doctrines requiring reconciliation. Immeasurable latent tendencies may suggest failure of universal liberation rather than co-existence of recognition and manifestation. Supreme goodness affirmation risks appearing as relativistic dismissal rather than appreciation of diverse perspectives. Preservation conveys that multiple valid views describe same ineffable reality.

The section concludes by affirming legitimacy of diverse guru interpretations while establishing confidence in teaching's efficacy. Non-contradictory nature of views demonstrates flexibility of wisdom in accommodating different perspectives. Passage transitions to next chapter having established both vast temporal scope and multiple valid approaches to understanding liberation.

[Structural Synthesis: Lines 6424-6758]
This comprehensive section establishes cosmological framework, liberation statistics, and lineage transmission for secret heart-essence teachings. Architecture moves from vast temporal scales through specific enumeration, quantitative liberation data, detailed lineage prophecy, guru praise, and cosmological cycling to final interpretive diversity. View throughout maintains that Buddha manifestation is continuous and omnipresent, liberation occurs through recognition of nature, and lineage transmission adapts to conditions while maintaining continuity. Translator must preserve mythological specificity while conveying that these represent skillful means expressing truths beyond formulation.

[Preservation Summary]
Cognitive layer requires maintaining sense of vast temporal scope without literalizing numerical specifications. Cosmological framework serves to expand mind beyond ordinary conception rather than establish historical facts. Liberation statistics demonstrate teaching efficacy without functioning as demographic records. Lineage prophecy creates confidence in transmission continuity while remaining open to diverse manifestations. Overall tone conveys calm authority without didacticism, acknowledging interpretive diversity without uncertainty. Translation risks center on reduction of symbolic richness to literal claims or dismissal as mythology rather than recognition of skillful means.
