[6801-6871]
Student qualification framework—establishing the necessary characteristics of a suitable vessel for Great Perfection teachings. Six-family seed emptying (rigs drug gi sa bon stong pa), six affliction purification (nyon mong drug sbyangs pa), six pristine cognition arising (dag pa ye shes drug 'char ba)—indicating preliminary purification through the six-syllable mantra (OM MANI PADME HUM). Root guru (rtsa ba'i bla ma) with four marks (mtshan bzhi) and empowerment basis (dbang gi gzhi), branch guru (yan lag gi bla ma) with two or three qualifications. View register: qualifications indicating capacity, not creating it.

[Extended Analysis: Six-Family Seed Emptying]
The six-family seed emptying indicates purification of the six realms' karmic seeds through the six-syllable mantra practice. Each syllable purifies a specific realm: OM (gods), MA (demi-gods), NI (humans), PAD (animals), ME (hungry ghosts), HUM (hell beings). View register: preliminary purification preparing the vessel. Translation risk: "emptying" suggesting destruction. Preservation: stong pa means emptying or releasing—liberating the karmic seeds, not destroying them. This is preparation, not the main practice.

[Extended Analysis: Six Affliction Purification]
The six afflictions (nyon mong drug) purified correspond to the six realms' primary poisons: gods' attachment to pleasure, demi-gods' jealousy, humans' desire, animals' delusion, hungry ghosts' greed, hell beings' hatred. View register: purification of obscurations revealing natural purity. Translation risk: purification suggesting stained nature. Preservation: sbyangs pa means refined or purified—the afflictions are temporary obscurations, not inherent. Purification reveals what was always pure.

[Extended Analysis: Six Pristine Cognition Arising]
The six pristine cognitions (dag pa ye shes drug) arising correspond to the five wisdoms plus their integration—mirror wisdom, equality wisdom, discriminating wisdom, accomplishing wisdom, dharmadhatu wisdom, and their unified operation. View register: wisdoms naturally present, revealed by purification. Translation risk: "arising" suggesting production. Preservation: 'char ba means appearing or dawning—the wisdoms are not created but revealed when obscurations are purified.

[Extended Analysis: Root Guru Four Marks]
The root guru requires four marks (mtshan bzhi): scriptural knowledge (lung), realization (rtogs pa), compassionate activity (thugs rje'i spyod pa), and lineage holding (brgyud pa 'dzin pa). These establish authentic transmission. View register: guru as living embodiment of teachings. Translation risk: qualifications appearing as checklist. Preservation: the four marks indicate comprehensive mastery—knowing, realizing, acting, and transmitting. This ensures authentic lineage.

[Extended Analysis: Empowerment Basis]
The guru must have "empowerment basis" (dbang gi gzhi)—having received the necessary initiations and being authorized to transmit. View register: empowerment as introduction, not license. Translation risk: "authorized" suggesting institutional control. Preservation: dbang gi gzhi means the foundation of empowerment—the guru must have the transmission to give it. This is functional, not bureaucratic.

[Extended Analysis: Branch Guru Qualifications]
The branch guru (yan lag gi bla ma) has two or three qualifications—less comprehensive than root guru but still qualified to teach specific practices. View register: different levels of guidance appropriate to different needs. Translation risk: hierarchy suggesting value judgment. Preservation: yan lag means branch—specialized guidance, not inferior. Some practices require only branch guru; others require root guru.

[Extended Analysis: Guru to be Avoided]
The guru to be avoided (spang bya'i bla ma) has characteristics: ignorance (mi shes pa), pride (nga rgyal), foolishness (rmongs pa), external attachment (phyi la chags pa), inattention to Secret Mantra (gsang sngag la mi gsal ba), critical arrogance (kha na ma tho ba'i nga rgyal), wrong paths (lam log pa), no empowerment (dbang med), casual samaya (dam tshig shin tu sral ba), unable to answer (dris lan mi 'debs pa), little learning (thos pa nyung ba). View register: these disqualifications protect students from misguidance.

[Extended Analysis: Ten Student Dharmas]
The qualified student has ten dharmas: devotion (mos pa), faith (dad pa), desire for definitive meaning (nges don 'dod pa), generosity (sbyin pa), diligence (brtson 'grus), few attachments (chags pa nyung ba), good nature (sems bzang ba), wisdom (shes rab), samaya (dam tshig), harmony (mthun pa). View register: qualities supporting receptivity. Translation risk: list appearing as moral requirements. Preservation: these are natural qualities of suitable vessels, not forced achievements. A student with these qualities can receive the teachings.

[Extended Analysis: Guru Devotion as Buddha or Surpassing]
Guru devotion views the guru as Buddha or surpassing Buddha (bla ma sangs rgyas dang 'dra'am sangs rgyas las kyang lhag par mos pa). View register: guru as embodiment of enlightenment. Translation risk: guru worship or cult of personality. Preservation: this view recognizes the guru as the immediate source of enlightenment in this life—the guru's role is essential, hence "surpassing" in functional importance. This is view, not factual claim about the person.

[Extended Analysis: Vessel of Great Perfection]
The "vessel of Great Perfection" (rdzogs pa chen po'i snod) is the qualified student—prepared, purified, and receptive. View register: student readiness as essential condition. Translation risk: "vessel" suggesting passive container. Preservation: snod means vessel in the sense of capacity—able to hold the teachings. The student actively prepares through preliminary practices. The teachings are vast; the vessel must be capacious.

[6872-7098]
Student to be abandoned—characteristics indicating unsuitability for tantric practice. No honor (ma gus pa), careless Secret Mantra conduct (gsang sngag gi spyod pa bag med pa), no lineage (brgyud pa med pa), small wisdom (shes rab chung ba), disregarding kindness (byin rlabs la mi gus pa), speaking of own lineage (rang gi brgyud pa smra ba), bodily ornamentation (sku rgyan byed pa). These indicate fundamental incompatibility with Vajrayana's profound and potentially dangerous methods.

[Extended Analysis: No Honor and Careless Conduct]
"No honor" (ma gus pa) indicates lack of respect for teachings, teacher, and tradition. "Careless Secret Mantra conduct" indicates treating profound methods casually. View register: seriousness as protection. Translation risk: "careless" suggesting minor negligence. Preservation: bag med means without mindfulness or carefulness—treating Vajrayana as ordinary is dangerous. The methods are powerful; carelessness causes harm.

[Extended Analysis: No Lineage and Small Wisdom]
"No lineage" means lacking authentic transmission, learning from books or unqualified teachers. "Small wisdom" means insufficient intelligence to understand the teachings properly. View register: lineage and capacity as necessary supports. Translation risk: elitism or exclusion. Preservation: these are functional requirements, not value judgments. Some people need different approaches; Great Perfection is not for everyone.

[Extended Analysis: Disregarding Kindness and Speaking of Lineage]
"Disregarding kindness" shows ingratitude for the guru's blessing. "Speaking of own lineage" indicates pride in pedigree without realization. View register: proper relationship to teacher and tradition. Translation risk: anti-intellectualism. Preservation: byin rlabs (blessing) is essential; disregarding it cuts the student off. Boasting of lineage without embodying it is empty pretension.

[Extended Analysis: Bodily Ornamentation]
"Bodily ornamentation" (sku rgyan byed pa) indicates concern with external appearance rather than inner practice. View register: appearance vs. essence distinction. Translation risk: asceticism or anti-beauty. Preservation: external ornamentation is not wrong in itself, but prioritizing it over practice indicates wrong emphasis. The tantric practitioner may be beautiful, but beauty is not the point.

[Extended Analysis: Guru-Student Relationship Core]
The guru-student relationship is the core of tantric practice—the method by which realization is transmitted. View register: relationship as the path itself. Translation risk: authoritarian abuse or dependency. Preservation: in traditional context, this relationship is consensual, tested, and serves liberation. Modern contexts require care to prevent abuse while preserving the method's power.

[Extended Analysis: Risk of Guru Abuse in Modern Contexts]
The note acknowledges risk of guru abuse in modern contexts while preserving traditional framework. View register: traditional method requiring modern discernment. Translation risk: either naive traditionalism or dismissive modernism. Preservation: the traditional framework has value; modern practitioners must apply discernment. Not all who claim to be gurus are qualified.

[Extended Analysis: Scriptural Authority from Self-Arisen Tantra]
The Self-Arisen tantra (rang byung rgyud) provides scriptural authority for these qualifications. View register: canonical grounding for requirements. Translation risk: citation as proof-texting. Preservation: the tantra establishes that qualifications matter—Great Perfection is not for everyone immediately. Preliminary preparation ensures the student can benefit without harm.

[Extended Analysis: Abandoning Unsuitable Students]
The "student to be abandoned" (spang bya'i slob ma) is not rejected with contempt but guided to more suitable practices. View register: skillful matching of student to method. Translation risk: "abandoned" suggesting cruelty. Preservation: spang bya means to be set aside—this student is not ready for Great Perfection. They may be excellent practitioners of other methods. This is discernment, not rejection.

[Extended Analysis: Traditional Framework Without Anachronism]
Preserving traditional framework without anachronism means honoring the traditional requirements while recognizing modern contexts differ. View register: tradition as living, not fossilized. Translation risk: rigid traditionalism or casual modernization. Preservation: the essence—qualification matters—remains; the specific forms may adapt. The student's inner qualities matter more than external markers.

[Structural Synthesis: Complete Student Qualification Framework]
This section (6801-7098) presents the complete framework for determining student suitability for Great Perfection teachings. The architecture moves from qualifications through disqualifications, establishing clear criteria. The view throughout is that Great Perfection is powerful and requires proper preparation—the student must be a suitable vessel to hold these teachings without harm. The translator must preserve the traditional framework—the six purifications, ten qualities, four guru marks—while conveying that these are functional requirements, not arbitrary barriers. The guru-student relationship is central, requiring both devotion and discernment. Unsuitable students are not rejected but guided to appropriate practices. This is compassion—matching the teaching to the capacity ensures benefit for all.
