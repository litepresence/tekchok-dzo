[18262-18273]
Wisdom nature exposition—second section. Opens with negation: yeshes (wisdom) is not conceptual thought (rtog pa). Threefold classification follows: nges tshig (definitive meaning), ro snang (appearance of emptiness), and sems tsam (Cittamātra). The definitive meaning refers to direct non-conceptual realization. "Knowing by knowing itself" (shes pa shes pas) indicates self-aware knowing without中介. Structural note: the three divisions correspond to Madhyamaka, Yogācāra, and epistemological approaches. Register maintained at highest philosophical level. Preserve technical terms: nges tshig (definitive statement), ro snang (emptiness appearing), sems tsam (mind-only).
