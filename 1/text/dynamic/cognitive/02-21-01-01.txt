Comprehensive extended analysis. The nature of appearances section presents the classic Dzogchen analysis of appearance as neither external nor internal, but as the self-manifestation of mind. The outer appearances of white and red colors, the container world and contents beings gathered in the five-element expanse, are not external objects existing independently, nor are they merely internal mental constructs. They are groundless, empty miracles—clearly appearing without any basis, like the hair-shadow seen by someone with eye defects, like dreams, like illusions. This is supported by citations from Klong drug pa, which states all appearances are illusion like dream and reflection, and Rtsa ba shes rab (Root Prajnaparamita), which compares them to gandharva cities—arising, abiding, and not destroyed, yet without inherent existence. The appearance to mind is like the hair-shadow to the defective sense faculty—it appears clearly but lacks true existence. When investigated, the appearing mind itself cannot be found—it has no color, no shape, no birth, abiding, or cessation. This recognition of mind's emptiness is the original liberation. The section distinguishes this view from Mind-Only (sems tsam), which reifies mind as truly existent. Through comprehensive coverage, complete understanding is established.
