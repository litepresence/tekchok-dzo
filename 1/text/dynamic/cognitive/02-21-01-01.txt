Nature of appearances - outer, inner, illusion. Various outer white-red appearances, clear in expanse gathered by five elements—except appearing on face of self-mind's delusion, outer meaning thing and inner mind's thing both not established. Like deluded hair-shadow and dream illusion appearance—clear-appear without base, empty miracle. All appearance is illusion, like dream and reflection. Like gandharva city—that arising and abiding, not destroyed. Appearing to mind whatever appears, like appearance to impure eye-defect's hair-shadow. To mind itself existing as object, various appearances self-arise—name and color complete as two aspects of form. Though appearing to mind, outer appearances not self's mind, existing without self, abiding as field, color—seeing as shape not mind. Structural note: Dzogchen analysis of appearance nature—neither external nor internal, but self-manifest.
