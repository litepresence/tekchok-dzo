Dharmata and Buddha nature. First: in Dharmata, from perspective of that upon which one looks—essence of any not established, free from extremes of elaboration; transcends grasping of entity identity, without arising, ceasing, transference, or transformation; ultimate directly manifest, inconceivable. Second: Dharmakaya pervading all samsara and nirvana, possessing twofold purity—pure through purification of adventitious stains—is That. Sentient beings are Buddhas yet obscured by adventitious stains—when cleared, truly Buddhas. Possessing lineage, all sentient beings always possess Essence of Buddhahood. Third: each vehicle demonstrates Rigpa, emptiness, qualities. Here in Great Perfection divided through miraculous display: Dharmakaya's Dharmakaya fields—inconceivable; abode—Dharmata transcending mind's grasping; Samadhi—great Immovable. Structural note: Dzogchen view of Buddha nature as primordially present, obscured but recoverable.
