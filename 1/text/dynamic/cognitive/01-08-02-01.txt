Refutation of mere unceasing display as ground. Position holding ground of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as mere unceasing display unreasonable upon analysis. If rigpa merely unceasing display without recognition, unreasonable for saṃsāra and nirvāṇa to arise cease without recognition. Who among sentient beings liberated without recognizing nature? If cause and effect primordially spontaneously accomplished without dependence on recognition, then exist simultaneously as one essence, distinction meaningless. When cause established as saṃsāra, effect cannot manifest as nirvāṇa, identical. If truly one essence, saṃsāra follows wherever nirvāṇa present, nirvāṇa following saṃsāra causes one without distinction. Pure and impure cannot exist simultaneously as cause and effect if one substance. Position of mere unceasing display does not abide under scrutiny. Klongdrukpa citation: mere spontaneous display not correct recognition of liberation. If mere awareness existing sufficient cause, effect liberation not distinct from ordinary existence. Charcoal piled on black earth cannot be cleaned white. Cause and effect remain separate without connection. Samantabhadra: teaching of unceasing display as sole ground exists merely among conventional dharmas known by intellect, not correct essence of ultimate recognition. Second position: nature not established as definite entity, uncertain and indeterminate; conditions transform and alter every moment. Semde citation: manifold names and designations, meaning merely labels empty like echoes, nature not determined singular or fixed. Refutation: if basis truly one essence, cannot simultaneously be non-one. If uncertain basis truly cause-base of saṃsāra, clearly determined as cause of confusion. If basis of nirvāṇa, established as determined in contradictory manner. If inherently pure, impurity cannot arise; accepting both alternation and uncertainty causes contradiction. From purity, impurity necessarily reverts to purity, eliminating distinction.

The refutation of mere unceasing display addresses a potential misunderstanding of Dzogchen view.
Holding that samsara and nirvana are mere spontaneous display without recognition is unreasonable.
Without recognition of the natural state, there is no liberation from samsara.
If cause and effect were primordially one without dependence on recognition, practice would be meaningless.
The position of mere spontaneous display does not withstand logical analysis.
Klongdrukpa citation establishes that mere awareness is not sufficient for liberation.
The basis must be recognized as primordially pure for liberation to occur.
Uncertainty and indeterminacy as positions also fail under scrutiny.
If the basis is truly one essence, it cannot simultaneously be non-one.
The Dzogchen view transcends these extremes through recognition of the natural state.
Translator must preserve the logical rigor of the refutations.
The refutation establishes the necessity of recognition for liberation.
Without recognition, mere spontaneous display remains samsara.
With recognition, spontaneous display becomes the display of wisdom.
This is the crucial distinction in Dzogchen view.
Translator must preserve the logical precision while conveying the practical implications.
The natural state is not merely present but must be recognized as present.
Recognition transforms everything without changing anything.
This is the paradox and power of Dzogchen.
The text provides rigorous logical analysis to establish this point.
The detailed analysis establishes correct Dzogchen view beyond extremes.
Recognition is essential; mere presence is not sufficient.
Translator must preserve logical structure and citations.
This is core Dzogchen philosophical exposition.
The refutation of incorrect views establishes correct understanding.
Mere unceasing display is not enough; recognition is required.

The extended analysis in this section systematically refutes positions that would misunderstanding Dzogchen view. The mere unceasing display position fails because it lacks recognition. The uncertainty position fails because it lacks determination. Both extremes must be transcended through correct recognition of the natural state. The Klongdrukpa citations provide scriptural authority for these refutations. The logic is rigorous: if samsara and nirvana are one substance without recognition, then practice is meaningless. If they are truly different substances, then liberation is impossible. The correct view recognizes non-duality while maintaining distinction through awareness. This is the middle way of Dzogchen.
The correct view transcends both eternalism and nihilism through recognition.
Translator must preserve this philosophical precision.
Dzogchen view is precise.
Translator must preserve exact meaning.
