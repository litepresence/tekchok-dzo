Refutation of mere unceasing display as ground. Position holding ground of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as mere unceasing display unreasonable upon analysis. If rigpa merely unceasing display without recognition, unreasonable for saṃsāra and nirvāṇa to arise cease without recognition. Who among sentient beings liberated without recognizing nature? If cause and effect primordially spontaneously accomplished without dependence on recognition, then exist simultaneously as one essence, distinction meaningless. When cause established as saṃsāra, effect cannot manifest as nirvāṇa, identical. If truly one essence, saṃsāra follows wherever nirvāṇa present, nirvāṇa following saṃsāra causes one without distinction. Pure and impure cannot exist simultaneously as cause and effect if one substance. Position of mere unceasing display does not abide under scrutiny. Klongdrukpa citation: mere spontaneous display not correct recognition of liberation. If mere awareness existing sufficient cause, effect liberation not distinct from ordinary existence. Charcoal piled on black earth cannot be cleaned white. Cause and effect remain separate without connection. Samantabhadra: teaching of unceasing display as sole ground exists merely among conventional dharmas known by intellect, not correct essence of ultimate recognition. Second position: nature not established as definite entity, uncertain and indeterminate; conditions transform and alter every moment. Semde citation: manifold names and designations, meaning merely labels empty like echoes, nature not determined singular or fixed. Refutation: if basis truly one essence, cannot simultaneously be non-one. If uncertain basis truly cause-base of saṃsāra, clearly determined as cause of confusion. If basis of nirvāṇa, established as determined in contradictory manner. If inherently pure, impurity cannot arise; accepting both alternation and uncertainty causes contradiction. From purity, impurity necessarily reverts to purity, eliminating distinction. Basis uncertain means changes every regard without stability; all sentient beings liberated without effort, Buddhas revert to impure confusion. Basis follows as possession of mind rather than true nature; asserting only uncertainty constitutes determination, contradicting claim.
