Structural function: Recognition stage (ngo 'phrod) analysis within Cittamātra tenet system presentation. Four subsections progressing from True Aspectarian analysis through similes to False Aspectarian transition. First subsection establishes correspondence between aspects and consciousness through direct perception without elaboration. Second subsection presents egg-split simile analyzing apparent duality of perceiver-perceived arising from single mind, addressing objections regarding simultaneous cognitions through non-conceptual aspect consciousness. View register: Indian Buddhist philosophical analysis.

Third subsection introduces monkey-fortress analogy explaining how single consciousness operates through multiple sense doors like a monkey moving through fortress chambers, followed by dream analogy establishing unity of consciousness across sensory modalities. Fourth subsection transitions to False Aspectarian positions—stained and pure appearance sub-schools—introducing dharmakāya as ultimate resolution.

Extended recognition of the philosophical progression: True Aspectarians hold that aspects are real but consciousness is the fundamental reality, using the egg-split simile to explain how subject-object duality arises from non-dual mind. The monkey-fortress analogy addresses the problem of multiple simultaneous cognitions—if consciousness is single, how can it perceive through multiple senses simultaneously? The answer: like a monkey moving quickly through fortress chambers, consciousness appears to be multiple while remaining single. The dream analogy extends this: just as dream consciousness creates multiple objects while remaining single, waking consciousness does the same.

Overall structural recognition: This section continues the Tenet Systems analysis of Cittamātra, specifically focusing on the True Aspectarian position and its transition to False Aspectarian views. The recognition required is that these are not arbitrary philosophical speculations but systematic analyses of how experience is constructed. The similes are not decorative but essential explanatory tools—the egg-split explains the subject-object structure of experience, the monkey-fortress explains sensory integration, the dream explains the illusory nature of perceived multiplicity. The translator must preserve the philosophical precision while making the similes comprehensible to modern readers.
