Five Buddha lineages and mandala appearance in this Jambu continent. Opening citation from Khorwa Dongtruk Rinpoche Sangwe Gyud (Treasury of Precious Secrets that Pushes Out Samsara). Holding lineage of five Buddhas: five crystal stupas of thousand-span height, nature of five wisdoms, lineage of five sky-expanses—expanding to pervade the sky without appearance, individually clear colors unmixed. Three aspects: essence (ngo bo—pure ground without ceasing), nature (rang bzhin—five great elements), compassion (thugs rje—demonstrated form-body). From Vajra-space mandala, spontaneous complete body, water-moon body possessing five wisdoms, self-nature of unclear-clear. Five crystal stupa descends to Vajra-Holder's left, three aspects of tone enters corner in northeast direction. Nighttime direction sees daytime. Wisdom placed near right corner becomes seeing single Buddha. present a distinctive Dzogchen cosmogonic narrative—the descent of the five crystal stupas from the Vajra-space mandala to this Jambu continent. The structural function: establishing the origin of the Thögal (thod rgal) teachings as transcendent revelation rather than human composition. View register: teachings arising from the natural display of rigpa itself, not constructed philosophy. Translation risk: reading as mythology rather than description of how wisdom manifests in apparent space-time. Preservation: the specificity of "five crystal stupas" (shel gyi mchod rten) and "thousand-span height" (khri 'phang) indicates precise visionary description, not metaphor. The five Buddhas (sangs rgyas lnga) mentioned—Akshobhya, Vairocana, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi, Ratnasambhava—represent the five wisdoms and five elements in their purified form. View register: these are not historical figures but the natural display of rigpa's qualities. Translation risk: personifying the Buddhas as external beings rather than intrinsic wisdom displays. Preservation: "lineage" (gdung) here indicates continuity of wisdom nature, not genealogical descent. The "five sky-expanses" (mkha' klong lnga) indicate that these manifestations pervade all space without being localized appearances. The crystal stupa (shel gyi mchod rten) represents the transparent, luminous nature of mind—like crystal, it takes on the color of what is placed behind it yet remains essentially clear. View register: the stupa as representation of enlightened mind's structure—base (earth), dome (water), spire (fire), parasol (air), jewel (space). Translation risk: literalizing the stupa as physical object rather than visionary appearance. Preservation: the stupa is "water-moon body" (chu zla'i sku)—reflection-like, apparent yet empty. The descent to Vajra-Holder's (rdo rje 'chang) left side establishes the tantric transmission lineage. present the three aspects (ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje gsum)—essence, nature, and compassion—that characterize Dzogchen ontology. Essence: pure ground without ceasing ('gag med dag pa'i gzhi)—the unborn base. Nature: five great elements ('byung ba chen po lnga)—the spontaneous display. Compassion: demonstrated form-body (gzugs sku yongs su bstan)—the manifestation for others. View register: these three are inseparable (dbyer med)—not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects. Translation risk: separating the three as distinct components rather than unity with three aspects. Preservation: the Tibetan grammar (essence X, nature Y, compassion Z) indicates apposition, not sequence. describe the descent path: from Vajra-space mandala (rdo rje dbyings kyi dkyil 'khor) to Vajra-Holder's left, then to the thirty-three gods' realm (sum cu rtsa gsum), Palace of Complete Victory (rnam par rgyal ba'i khang bzangs), Potalaka (pa ta ri ka), then to the five-peaked mountain (ri bo rtse lnga), Vajra-seat (rdo rje gdan), and finally to Mount Kailash (gangs ri ti se). View register: these are not literal geographical locations but symbolic representations of stages of manifestation. Translation risk: literalizing the geography or dismissing as mere symbolism. Preservation: each location has specific significance—Potalaka as Chenrezig's pure land, Vajra-seat as Bodhgaya, Kailash as worldly power place.

Thirty-three gods' realm and descent locations. Palace of Complete Victory's upper story called Potalaka. Then descending to five-peaked mountain's peak. Then to Vajra-seat. Then to Mount Kailash. Then the great stupa radiated as light rays, dispelling sentient beings' conceptions. Thus at the beginning when this world formed, from Vajra-space mandala through natural blessing the teacher Vajra-Holder, delighted in beings' benefit, descended to Tushita's left, then progressively to thirty-three, five-peaked mountain, Vajra-seat, Mount Kailash—now residing at Kailash's peak in jewel-light-radiating mansion, attended and served by many dakinis, siddhas, and mantra-holders. Without actual mirror, using various jewels or naturally arisen crystal from snow-ocean continents and so forth as introduction mirrors. establish the temporal framework: "when this world formed" ('jig rten 'di chags dus)—the beginning of this kalpa. The descent narrative places Dzogchen teachings as primordially present, not historically originated. View register: time as non-linear, teachings eternally present but manifesting when conditions arise. Translation risk: reading as historical claim about when Buddhism began. Preservation: the "beginning" refers to the apparent formation of this world-system, not absolute origin. The progressive descent (gcig nas gcig tu bab) represents increasing density of manifestation, not temporal sequence. identify Mount Kailash (gangs ti se, Tib. gangs ri ti se) as the current residence of the teachings. The "jewel-light-radiating mansion" (rin po che 'od 'phro ba'i khang bu) describes a visionary palace, not physical structure. View register: sacred geography as support for practice, not merely symbolic. Translation risk: literalizing the residence or dismissing as fantasy. Preservation: Kailash is identified as the "Crystal Stupa" (shel gyi mchod rten) in Tibetan tradition—the physical mountain as manifestation of the five Buddha families. The attendance by dakinis, siddhas, and mantra-holders establishes the ongoing vitality of the transmission. transition to practical instruction: without the actual mirror (dngos kyi me long), one can use "various jewels" (nor bu sna tshogs) or "naturally arisen crystal" (rang byung ba'i men shel) from "snow-ocean continents" (gangs dang rgya mtsho'i gling) as "introduction mirrors" (ngo sprod kyi me long). View register: physical supports for recognizing what is already present. Translation risk: treating the mirror as magical device or dismissing as superstition. Preservation: the mirror (me long) reflects without modification—like mind's nature. The specific jewels mentioned—rinchen snying po (jewel essence), mar gd (coral?), sa yi snying po (earth essence)—have specific correspondences to elements and chakras. cite from Norbu Thrakö (Jewel Ornament) tantra, describing Vajrasattva's symbolic representation: stainless white like moon, discerned from between darkness and light, luminous jewel without stain, possessing five-colored lights, five bodies not individually distinguished, indivisible front and back, great light of apparent-clear dharmata, dharmata clarity universally blazing, supreme lamp of all illuminators, within great emptiness sky-expanse all appearances arise as light. View register: deity as description of mind's nature, not external entity. Translation risk: literalizing the description or treating as mere poetry. Preservation: each image describes actual visionary appearance in Thögal practice—white light, five colors, indivisibility.

[9490-9512]
Practical instructions for using the mirror. Holding such a mirror, cleansing stains with mantra water, regarding it as one's root guru, blessing with hundreds of thousands of OM AH HUNG, scattering flowers with dependent-origination essence, reciting auspicious verses, performing seven-branch offering, again reciting auspicious verses, offering scarves of five colors and perfumed powders as clothing. Thus performing all examples first. Second, actual introduction through lineage and direct introduction. Lineage: transmitted through Buddhas' intention, vidyadharas' symbolic transmission, persons' aural lineage. Actual introduction: copper-shining introduction of single vehicle, single family, single bindu, single wisdom eye—Vajrasattva's mirror introduction, knowing meaning through example, unelaborated expanse, merit-ornamented body, to Emanation Vajra Od-sung. detail the ritual preparation for mirror practice. "Cleansing stains with mantra water" (gzungs chus dri ma bkru) indicates purification not of the mirror but of perception. "Regarding as root guru" (rtsa ba'i bla mar mos) establishes the guru yoga dimension—all appearance as guru's display. The "hundred thousand OM AH HUNG" (aom ah hum brgya stong) are the three vajras—body, speech, mind—of all Buddhas. View register: ritual as creating conditions for recognition, not magical operation. Translation risk: ritual elements appearing superstitious. Preservation: each element serves specific function—mantra water purifies conceptual obscuration, guru devotion opens to blessing, auspicious verses create positive conditions. enumerate the three lineages (brgyud pa gsum): mind lineage of the Buddhas (sangs rgyas dgongs pa'i brgyud), symbolic lineage of the vidyadharas (rigs 'dzin brda'i brgyud), and aural lineage of persons (gang zag snyan khungs kyi brgyud). View register: transmission as continuity of recognition across apparent time. Translation risk: "lineage" suggesting institutional authority rather than recognition continuity. Preservation: the three lineages represent different modalities—direct mind-to-mind, symbolic indication, and verbal instruction. All three convey the same recognition. describe the actual introduction (ngo sprod pa dngos): copper-shining (zang thal) introduction of single vehicle (theg pa gcig), single family (rigs gcig), single bindu (thig le gcig), single wisdom eye (ye shes mig gcig). View register: singularity indicating non-duality, not numerical oneness. Translation risk: "single" suggesting exclusivity rather than non-dual recognition. Preservation: the four "singles" represent the unity of ground, path, and result—one vehicle to buddhahood, one Buddha-nature, one essence, one recognition. Vajrasattva's mirror serves as the example—knowing the meaning through the example. The term "copper-shining" (zang thal) requires specific attention. It describes the direct, unobstructed quality of Thögal vision—like polished copper, directly reflective without distortion. View register: the introduction is not mediated through concept but directly pointing. Translation risk: "copper-shining" appearing as obscure metaphor. Preservation: zang thal is a technical term in Dzogchen indicating the unobstructed, direct, naturally clear quality of rigpa's self-recognition. It is not an adjective but a noun—the copper-shining itself.

This section (9413-9512) presents the origin myth and practical foundation of Thögal practice. The architecture moves from cosmogonic descent of the crystal stupas, through sacred geography, to practical mirror instructions. The view throughout is that Thögal is not human invention but wisdom's natural display, transmitted through three lineages, pointing directly to rigpa's nature. The translator must preserve both the visionary quality of the descent narrative and the practical precision of the mirror instructions. The copper-shining introduction is the essence—all elaborate description serves this direct pointing.
