Bardo liberation methods. Recognizing self-face in seeing primordial purity's appearances—Ground established. Those of sharp acumen liberated in an instant; lesser acumen dwell long in Realm meditating for many days. Swiftness like arrow's flight, something slow, something extremely slow—progressive departures. Moment of consummate capacity completion: combined with six others' meditation days, recognition understood. Various liberation methods: in three moments, through mirror sphere, father and mother, flickering and radiant light, arising in own truth, through compassionate radiance, through two spheres, through whatever appears by Body liberated. Supreme capacity: in three moments becoming Buddha, Emanations naturally arise. In one moment sphere-appearance ceases, spontaneous presence appearance ceases. Structural note: enumeration of bardo liberation techniques in Dzogchen.
