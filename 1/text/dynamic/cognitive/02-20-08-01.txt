[9223-9403]
Dzogchen view, intention, conduct, fruit - twelve aspects. Essence: awareness nature of Great Perfection, luminosity without transfer, space-wisdom non-dual. When realized by sense-faculty, space-awareness appears as field, view, intention, conduct, fruit—four fours for best, middle, last of three faculties: twelve portions. Best faculty: view wisdom spontaneously arising, realizing self-wisdom without body; intention unmoving clarity like planets on ocean; conduct ceaseless power-arising like sky-spear; fruit seeing birthless self-arising. Middle faculty: view realizes self-awareness without birth; intention free from conceptual portions like flags on ocean; conduct unblocked spontaneous like madman; fruit endowed with self-place intention, conquering signs. Last faculty: view realizes appearance as illusion/emanation; intention demonstrating self-appearance essence, wisdom arising like lion-chick free from womb-egg; conduct endowed grasping samsara-nirvana; fruit abandoning body, breath reaches nature-emanation body field. Structural note: detailed Dzogchen path structure.
