Structural function: Dharmakaya field presentation within the three-kāya architecture. The analytical structure is fourfold—essence (ngo bo), divisions (dbye ba), enumerations (rnam grangs), extensive explanation (rgyas par bshad pa)—establishing systematic methodology. View register: Dzogchen ultimate truth, primordial purity (ka dag). Translation risk: Rendering chos sku as "Truth Body" loses the emptiness-dharma resonance. Preservation: The term must retain connection to dharmatā as emptiness possessing awareness-essiness (stong gsal).

Extended recognition of the fivefold dharmakaya analysis—abiding manner, defining characteristic, nature, compassion, and appearance. This is not random enumeration but progressive disclosure of emptiness- awareness from different angles. Abiding manner: unstained from beginning establishes primordial purity. Defining characteristic: emptiness possessing awareness-essence establishes union of empty and aware. Nature: non-mixed establishes that emptiness-awareness is not composite. Compassion: without opening or closing establishes spontaneous responsiveness without agency. Appearance manner: non-dual establishes that emptiness-awareness is not bifurcated into subject-object. The recognition required is that these five are all ways of describing one dharmatā from different angles.

Recognition of the definitive terminology section. The etymology "chos su sku"—maturation into kāya from dharmas—establishes dharmakaya as result of purification, yet the text immediately deconstructs this: without entity, defining characteristic nowhere determined, emptiness nowhere established. This is classic Madhyamaka deconstruction applied to dharmakaya. The recognition required is that dharmakaya is both the result of purification and never impure to begin with. The translator must preserve this paradox without collapsing it into either pole.
