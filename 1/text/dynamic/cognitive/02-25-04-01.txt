[16409-16435]
Dharmakaya field. Extensively explained: essence, divisions, enumerations, extensive explanation—four. Dharmakaya's essence: self-arisen wisdom, empty-clarity, free from elaboration. Abiding manner, defining characteristic, nature, compassion, appearance manner—five. Essence's abiding manner: unstained by any flaw, pure from beginning. Defining characteristic: emptiness possessing awareness-essence. Nature: non-mixed with anything. Compassion: without opening, closing, or division-making. Appearance manner: non-dual. Definitive terminology: maturation from labeled enumeration dharmas into kaya—thus without entity, defining characteristic nowhere determined, emptiness nowhere established—therefore called Dharma-kaya. Structural note: Dzogchen analysis of Dharmakaya nature and terminology.
