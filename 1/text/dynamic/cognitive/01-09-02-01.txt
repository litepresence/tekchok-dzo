Basis appears from ground, deluded by Three Ignorances and Four Conditions. Self-Arisen Rigpa: Pure Buddha possesses no delusion, Vajrasattva's manner of delusion from early basis. Field called Broad, Place called Beautiful, time when destruction occurs, Pig Year, Sun called Created, Star Bird, human named Old One Who Possesses Heap, indeterminate lineage: all sources of delusion. Four friends, five wild-men arise, one back-support, one thief, one accumulator of all arise. Immeasurable collections of armies arise, become deluded. Arises from basis that possesses no delusion.
