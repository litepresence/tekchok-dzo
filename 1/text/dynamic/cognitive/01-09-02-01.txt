Structural function: Mythic cosmogony narrative describing the arising of delusion from the primordial basis (gzhi). The basis appears from ground, deluded by Three Ignorances (ma rig pa gsum) and Four Conditions (rkyen bzhi). View register: Dzogchen creation myth, symbolic narrative of how samsara emerges from primordial purity. The self-arisen rigpa is pure Buddha possessing no delusion, yet Vajrasattva's manner of delusion arises from the early basis. Translation risk: Literalizing the mythic names and events misses their symbolic function—they represent stages of cognitive obscuration, not historical events. Preservation: The symbolic resonance of the names must be maintained.

Extended recognition of the mythic elements: Field called Broad (yang pa), Place called Beautiful (mdzes pa), time when destruction occurs, Pig Year (phag lo), Sun called Created (bskyed pa), Star Bird (skar bya), human named Old One Who Possesses Heap (gsol 'dzin rgan po)—all sources of delusion. The four friends, five wild-men arise, one back-support, one thief, one accumulator of all arise. Immeasurable collections of armies arise and become deluded, yet all arises from the basis that possesses no delusion. Recognition: These are not historical facts but symbolic representations of how cognitive obscurations develop.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents the Dzogchen cosmogonic myth describing how delusion arises from the primordial basis. The recognition required is that this is symbolic narrative, not literal history—the names and events represent stages of increasing cognitive obscuration from pure presence to full delusion. The translator must preserve the mythic resonance of the symbolic names while maintaining the understanding that this describes psychological processes, not external events. The key teaching: delusion arises from basis that itself possesses no delusion—establishing the Dzogchen view that obscuration is adventitious, not inherent.
