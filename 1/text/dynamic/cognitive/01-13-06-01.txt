The Wisdom Self-Arisen Lamp (shes rab rang byung sgron ma) presents the third of the Four Lamps, establishing the discriminating awareness that recognizes all phenomena as empty-luminous dharmata. This section operates at the pinnacle of the Treasury's phenomenological system, presenting the cognitive dimension of primordial wisdom that directly knows reality without conceptual mediation.

Structural analysis of lines 17072-17360 reveals a comprehensive six-part exposition: essence (ngo bo), definitive meaning (nges tshig), divisions (dbye ba), characteristics (mtshan nyid), gateway ('char byed kyi sgo), and measure (tshad). This organizational schema maintains consistency with the Treasury's systematic approach to the Four Lamps, treating each as a complete phenomenological structure with specific coordinates for recognition and practice.

The essence-definition (17072-17087) establishes the Wisdom Self-Arisen Lamp as the intention of all lamps as object-knowledge, dharmata empty-luminous self-abiding together with dynamic knowledge. The method involves three unmoving dimensions—ground-hook (sa rgyang zhags), bindu, and expanse—placed within self-awareness crystal-clear, split intention self-abiding together with interval knowledge filling the expanse. The Blazing Lamp Tantra citation grounds the presentation: "Thus all lamps abiding as object-knowledge exactly all parts, discriminating wisdom exactly abiding manner, non-discrimination nature producing, subtle parts abiding primordially from beginning."

Technical precision on terminology: "Self-arisen" (rang byung) indicates spontaneous emergence without causal conditions; "wisdom" (shes rab) here transcends ordinary intellect, representing direct non-conceptual knowing; "lamp" (sgron ma) illuminates the nature of all phenomena without obscuration. The three dimensions (sa, thig le, dbyings) correspond to the triad of support, essence, and field that characterizes each lamp's architecture.

The definitive meaning section (17088-17122) opens with the recognition that occurs when self-abiding effortless intention knows: outer-appearance becomes self-appearance completely obvious; dharmas are universally known as empty and selfless; one's own primordial wisdom measures are known—hence called "knowledge." "Excellent" (rab) indicates supremacy over all, difficult to realize, intention not sought but found from self. "Self" (rang) means the primordially existing jewel found at oneself. "Arisen" (byung) means self-arisen ceaselessly arising. "Lamp" (sgron) means knowing dharmas clearly. "Not knowledge" (ma) means self-appearance pervading at self-face by awareness, not by knowledge.

Tantric citations from the Blazing Lamp and Jewel Garland establish scriptural authority. The Jewel Garland states: "Like kindling lamp, knowledge knows dharmas simultaneously; excellent becomes summit of all; self is free from other-dependence and conditions; arisen unblocked appears directly." This series of definitions demonstrates the text's hermeneutical method—each term analyzed through multiple lenses to establish its ultimate significance.

Extended analysis of the non-dual recognition: The Wisdom Self-Arisen Lamp operates through awareness (rig pa) rather than ordinary knowledge (shes pa), representing the shift from conceptual cognition to direct non-dual perception. Entity and non-entity completely enter into all appearances; universal meanings are obtained; confidence in non-sought, non-placed knowing measures primordial wisdom. The Dharmakaya's pure nature appears through self-awareness—not finding the three (body, speech, mind) clearly appearing, surpassing all excellence, without basis for examination by others.

The five divisions (gsum pa dbye na lnga) present the graduated taxonomy of wisdom functioning (lines 17123-17151):

1. Ground-abiding self-arisen wisdom (gzhi gnas rang byung gi shes rab): inner-abiding awareness knowledge, abiding as arising-basis support.

2. One-pointed-grasping-appearance wisdom (snang ba cer 'dzin gyi shes rab): expansive awareness non-dual union, own time self-clear stainless pure, conveying intention to dharmata.

3. Memory-ceaseless wisdom (dran pa 'gag med kyi shes rab): arising without characteristic, below yet liberating, self-face to dharmata as one.

4. Analytical wisdom (so sor rtog pa'i shes rab): dharmas' dharmatas, self universal aspects, characteristics etc. appearing without confusion.

5. Three-engaging wisdom ('jug byed rnam gsum gyi shes rab): bardo nature by hearing establishing definitively, by thinking determining, by meditation tasting, certainly liberating from samsara, making realize word-meaning.

Technical progression: These five wisdoms represent stages of increasing refinement—from ground-abiding as basis, through one-pointed grasping as focused recognition, memory-ceaseless as continuous flow, analytical as discriminative clarity, to three-engaging as active liberation. This taxonomy mirrors the five wisdoms of buddhahood while maintaining the Treasury's specific technical vocabulary.

The characteristic (mtshan nyid) at lines 17152-17163 establishes the defining quality: knowing dharmas gathered by appearing objects and knowing awareness as without nature. All dharmas appearing or not-appearing, whoever knows them as without nature—this characteristic is called supreme Prajnaparamita. The Sutra citation confirms: "All dharmas transformed into naturelessness—this is called supreme transcendent wisdom."

Gateway ('char byed kyi sgo) specification (lines 17164-17197): The five faculties (dbang po lnga) serve as the gateway—power-awareness measuring objects as wisdom. Particularly, from the nose, memory-wisdom-horse-wind moves. Fire-wind wisdom spark-like appearance arises when night squeezes. The Jewel Garland states: "Gateway-manifestation five faculties; particularly from nose arising; horse-mark night time; squeezing wisdom fire-spark certainty."

The field (yul) section (lines 17198-17220) locates the wisdom functioning: Citta on four channels with great distinction, grasped by wisdom clarity-wind not dispersing outward, internally self-abiding only. Unclear karma-wind outward-force moved, objects awareness-appeared abiding in name-ground-gathered clarity. Element knowledge fourfold clarity wisdom-awareness.

Measure (tshad) comprehensive specification (lines 17221-17360):
- Ground-abiding wisdom measure: abiding in heat-measure equal-intention
- One-pointed-grasping wisdom measure: expansive awareness mixed, obtaining self-power
- Memory-ceaseless wisdom measure: liberating-arising without characteristic, gathering-dispersing exhausted, abiding in effortless spontaneous intention
- Conditions not moving awareness: analytical wisdom measure
- Dualistic dharmas discriminated separately, establishing definitively: three-engaging wisdom measure
- Realizing word-meaning: abiding in meaning's self-face

Structural function: This section completes the third lamp presentation, establishing the Wisdom Self-Arisen Lamp as the discriminating awareness that cuts through all conceptual elaborations while remaining non-conceptual itself. The progression from ground-abiding to three-engaging wisdom demonstrates the dynamic functioning of recognition, moving from passive abiding to active liberation. The integration of Prajnaparamita terminology with Dzogchen technical vocabulary maintains doctrinal coherence across Buddhist traditions.

Preservation note: Technical terminology requires careful handling—"self-arisen wisdom" as shes rab rang byung, "ground-abiding" as gzhi gnas, "one-pointed-grasping" as snang ba cer 'dzin, "three-engaging" as 'jug byed rnam gsum. The fivefold classification appears consistently across the Treasury's presentation of wisdom dimensions. The citations from Blazing Lamp and Jewel Garland establish scriptural authority while demonstrating the text's integration of tantric and sutric sources.

Risk acknowledgment: The terminology of "not knowledge" (ma) for awareness versus knowledge represents a technical distinction that may confuse modern readers—this indicates the shift from conceptual to non-conceptual knowing, not a denial of cognitive function. The five wisdoms' correspondence to traditional buddha-wisdom taxonomy requires preservation of both the conventional mapping and the Treasury's specific technical elaborations.

The Wisdom Self-Arisen Lamp serves as the cognitive culmination of the Four Lamps system, presenting the awareness that recognizes the empty-luminous nature of all phenomena without falling into conceptual proliferation. Its location at the eyes, its dependence on the five faculties, and its fivefold graduated functioning provide comprehensive coordinates for the recognition of primordial wisdom in direct experience.
