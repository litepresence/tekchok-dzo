Structural function establishes the four directional guardians ('phags skyes po, spyan mi bzang, rnam thos kyi bu, yul 'khor srung) as cosmological boundary markers within the thirty-three god realm framework. These four great kings (rgyal chen bzhi) serve as both protective deities and pedagogical symbols for meditative visualization practice, representing the administrative structure of the desire realm cosmos. Each guardian maintains specific directional responsibilities with attendant retinues that establish the outer boundary of the Trayastrimsa heaven. View register presents these beings as embodiments of the four immeasurables—loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity—manifested in form to protect practitioners and maintain cosmic order. Translation risks obscure the technical classification of these beings as lha yi gtso bo (divine chiefs) rather than mere mythological figures, potentially reducing their significance to folkloric status when they actually represent sophisticated psychological principles. Preservation requirements maintain the precise enumeration of their retinues and spatial positioning as essential for ritual cosmology reconstruction, ensuring that future practitioners can accurately visualize the protective mandala structure.

Structural function details the architectural specifications of divine palaces ('khor) and parks (skye mos tshal) through measurable material descriptions that serve as supports for meditation practice. The gold ground (gser gyi sa gzhi) spread with sandalwood water (tsan dan gyi chu) creates an environment of sensory refinement that corresponds to the mental pliancy achieved in advanced concentration states. The divine mandara flowers covering the ground to knee depth establish a specific visual field for meditation, while the beautiful ponds filled with flowers provide cooling water features that symbolize the pacification of afflictive emotions. View register presents these as visualization supports rather than literal geographical claims, emphasizing the pedagogical function of precise measurement in training the mind's capacity for vivid mental creation. Translation risks misrepresent gser gyi sa gzhi and tsan dan gyi chu as merely poetic flourishes rather than technical terminology for meditative concentration objects that correspond to specific mental factors. Preservation requirements note the specific dimensions and material compositions serve as standardized references for generation stage practice, ensuring consistency across translation traditions and meditation lineages.

Structural function establishes the sun and moon palaces with precise measurements (51 and 50 yojanas respectively) as foundational cosmological elements that structure the entire desire realm. The sun palace's base of fire crystal (me shel) and the moon's self-arisen water crystal (chu shel las rang byung) embody the complementary principles of method and wisdom, heat and coolness, activity and stability. The gold and silver fences surrounding these celestial residences, along with the four jewels at their pinnacles and divine city adornments, create a complete mandala structure that mirrors the inner architecture of subtle body channels and chakras. View register presents these celestial bodies as both physical entities and symbolic representations of method and wisdom in dynamic interplay, demonstrating how external cosmos reflects internal psychophysical processes. Translation risks obscure the technical distinction between nyi ma'i gzhal med khang and zla ba chu shel las rang byung, potentially conflating them with generic astronomical references when they actually represent specific stages of meditative experience. Preservation requirements maintain the specific materials (me shel, chu shel) and measurements that establish the hierarchical cosmological structure and its correspondence to subtle body geography.

Structural function centers on Mount Meru as the cosmological axis with the thirty-three god realm (sum cu rtsa gsum pa) situated at its summit, establishing the administrative center of the desire realm. The fivefold classification of abodes—city (grong), park (tshal), ground (sa gzhi), trees (shing), and assembly hall ('dun sa)—creates a comprehensive architectural grammar for understanding divine realms and their functional differentiation. The central Victorious Palace (rnam par rgyal ba'i khang bzangs) with its eight-layer foundation and seven-story structure, surrounded by four parks with jewel trees, birds, and ponds, establishes a complete mandala environment for divine activity. View register presents Meru rtsa mo as the unified field from which all manifestation extends, reflecting the Dzogchen principle of spontaneous presence where all appearance arises from the single ground of being without ever departing from it. Translation risks reduce dbang po'i pho brang 'khor to merely Indra's palace rather than recognizing it as the central organizing principle of the desire realm that demonstrates how merit and concentration create experiential environments. Preservation requirements note the fivefold classification establishes the architectural grammar for understanding divine realms, providing the template for visualization practices and cosmological understanding.

Structural function details the four equal parks (skye mos tshal) surrounding the central city with specific directional attributes and aesthetic qualities that complete the mandala structure. Each park extends twenty yojanas in the four directions from the central city, creating a balanced environment of 250 yojanas width where divine beings engage in playful activity (rol pa) without attachment. The parks feature wish-fulfilling trees, divine musical instruments, nectar, jewel nets, and divine sons and daughters engaged in song and cymbals, creating an environment of total sensory satisfaction that transcends yet includes ordinary sense pleasures. View register presents these as the playful display (rol pa) of enlightened appearance, emphasizing enjoyment without attachment as the natural expression of realized awareness rather than something to be rejected or suppressed. Translation risks misrepresent blta na sdug as merely beautiful rather than technically referring to the quality of immediate aesthetic satisfaction that arises when perception is free from grasping. Preservation requirements maintain the precise measurements (250 yojanas width) and the specific directional parks that constitute the complete mandala structure, ensuring that the cosmological template remains intact for ritual and meditative purposes.

Structural function introduces the cosmic tree yongs 'dus brtol as a central axis marker with specific measurements (5 yojanas down, 100 up) and surrounding canopy (50 yojanas) that establishes a vertical dimension to the horizontal mandala layout. The jewel net and divine garments adorning the tree represent the spontaneous display of rigpa, while the ar moni stone slab beneath serves as the specific meditation seat (dbang po'i khri) for the chief deity. The flower rain falling from above creates an atmosphere of continuous blessing and purification that permeates the entire environment. View register presents this tree as the union of space and awareness, with its extensive root system representing the profound depth of wisdom and its spreading branches embodying the vast extent of compassionate activity. Translation risks obscure the technical significance of the ar moni stone slab beneath the tree as a specific meditation seat, potentially reducing it to merely a mythological detail when it actually represents the immovable ground of realization. Preservation requirements note the tree's branches forming an umbrella-like canopy establishes a spatial metaphor for enlightened activity radiating in all directions while remaining centered in non-dual awareness.

Structural function describes the arrangement of desire and form realm gods above the celestial bodies like arrays of stars and planets, establishing a hierarchical stacking that extends upward through increasingly refined states of consciousness. The width doubling at each level creates a pyramidal structure where the distance from Jambudvipa to the Thirty-Three equals the distance from Thirty-Three to Conflict-Free heaven, demonstrating proportional relationships throughout the cosmos. This spatial arrangement reflects the graduated refinement of consciousness, where higher realms correspond to subtler states of meditative absorption and less coarse manifestation. View register presents this hierarchical stacking as illustrating the graduated refinement of consciousness, demonstrating how meditative stability creates corresponding experiential environments free from the grosser afflictions of lower realms. Translation risks misrepresent the spatial relationships as literal geographical distances rather than qualitative distinctions in consciousness that reflect different degrees of conceptual grasping and mental stability. Preservation requirements maintain the precise measurements (80,000 yojanas) that establish proportional relationships between realms, creating a coherent cosmological system that maps internal meditative experience to external spatial descriptions.

Structural function presents the cosmological vessel world (snod kyi 'jig rten) during the intermediate eon as empty of beings but filled with mountains, trees, grass, flowers, and forests, creating the prepared environment awaiting consciousness habitation. The sequential description of elemental interaction—rain falling from the sky, jewel trees expanding, nectar rain producing earth vapor—establishes the dependent origination framework for understanding how world systems emerge from the interdependence of elements and consciousness. This process demonstrates the Buddhist understanding of cosmological evolution as driven by collective karma rather than divine creation or random accident. View register emphasizes this as the ground of potentiality before manifestation, reflecting the Dzogchen view of spontaneous presence awaiting recognition, where the world exists as the display of awareness ready to be cognized but not yet fixated upon as external. Translation risks reduce the description to mere geological formation rather than recognizing it as the preparation of the vessel for consciousness habitation, the stage where the stage is set for the play of appearance to begin. Preservation requirements note the sequence of elemental interaction establishes the dependent origination framework, demonstrating how Buddhist cosmology integrates scientific observation with spiritual insight into the interdependent nature of all phenomena.

Structural function describes the emergence of beings through the interaction of wind goddesses, water goddesses dancing, and powerful naga forces, culminating in the awakening of latent consciousness from formless potential through Padma's speech sound pervading all directions. This cosmogonic process demonstrates the gradual densification of awareness from subtle to coarse, maintaining the continuity between formless and formed existence while showing how consciousness projects external worlds through its own movement. The samadhi emanation body (ting nge 'dzin gyi sprul pa'i lus) emerges as neither existent nor non-existent, establishing the illusory nature of all manifestation. This operates within view-register as the gradual densification of awareness from subtle to coarse, maintaining the continuity between formless and formed existence while demonstrating how consciousness itself creates the worlds it inhabits through the power of habitual tendency and karmic momentum. Translation risks obscure the technical process of consciousness awakening (sad de) from the bbag la nyal (latency) state, potentially reducing it to mythological storytelling when it actually describes the mechanics of how pure awareness becomes entangled in its own display. Preservation requirements maintain the citation from Guhyagarbha Tantra that establishes the ultimate source of manifestation as the sugata essence (bde gshegs snying po), grounding this cosmology in the highest tantric authority and connecting it to the view of Dzogchen.

Structural function establishes the samadhi emanation body (ting nge 'dzin gyi sprul pa'i lus) as neither existent nor non-existent, appearing only through the power of meditative concentration and the collective karma of beings ready to perceive it. These beings abide on the lotus-stacked sky (padma rnam par brtsegs pa'i nam mkha'), occupying the intermediate position between formless and formed realms where consciousness has not yet fully solidified into coarse embodiment. The fourfold negation (yod min med min gnyis min) points directly to the nature of appearance as beyond all conceptual categories, neither truly existing as independent entities nor completely non-existent as mere nothingness. The hermeneutical frame presents the bridge between pure presence and apparent manifestation, demonstrating the illusory nature of all formed existence while acknowledging the undeniable fact of experience. Translation risks misrepresent the fourfold negation as philosophical abstraction rather than direct pointing to the nature of appearance as it actually is, beyond all conceptual fabrication. Preservation requirements note the beings' residence on the lotus-stacked sky establishes the intermediate position between formless and formed realms, a crucial transitional space in the cosmological hierarchy that reflects the subtle states of meditative experience.

Structural function describes the golden vajra rising from the lower realms and the subsequent emanation of beings who see its beauty, establishing the Heroic Going Samadhi (dpa' bar 'gro ba'i ting nge 'dzin) as a distinct meditative state characterized by aesthetic appreciation and confidence. The progression from seeing the vajra to mind moving to beings arising establishes the mechanics of emanation and perception, demonstrating how the recognition of beauty triggers the creative process of manifestation. These beings represent a subtle refinement from the previous emanation body beings, having developed the capacity for appreciative perception that corresponds to increased meditative stability. The register indicates the progressive refinement of recognition, where coarse perception gives way to subtler seeing, and the appreciation of beauty becomes a path to deeper realization rather than a distraction from it. Translation risks reduce the vajra to merely a mythological object rather than recognizing it as the symbol of indestructible awareness, the diamond-like nature of mind that cannot be destroyed by any external force or internal confusion. Preservation requirements note the specific sequence (seeing the vajra, mind moving, beings arising) establishes the mechanics of emanation and perception, providing insight into how consciousness continuously creates and inhabits worlds through the power of recognition and response.

Structural function continues the cosmogonic narrative with the expansion of immeasurable beings from the perception-only state, establishing the consciousness base (rnam shes mtha' yas kyi skye mched) as the interface between pure awareness and differentiated experience. The Jewel Casket Samadhi (rin po che za ma tog gi ting nge 'dzin) serves as the abode for these beings, providing a stable environment where consciousness can operate without yet fixating on coarse external objects. The distinction between ci yang med pa (nothing at all) and cung zad med pa (slightly nothing) establishes subtle gradations within the formless realm, demonstrating the precision of Buddhist phenomenological analysis. This view-classification shows the play of awareness mistaking its own display for external objects, the fundamental error at the root of samsara that begins with the subtle grasping at perception itself as truly existing. Translation risks misrepresent ci yang med pa and cung zad med pa as nihilistic negations rather than technical terms for subtle gradations of formless existence that correspond to specific meditative attainments. Preservation requirements maintain the distinction between perception-only ('du shes tsam) and actual non-existence that establishes the Yogacara influence on this cosmology, demonstrating how Buddhist philosophy integrates multiple perspectives on the nature of consciousness and reality.

Structural function establishes the connection between this common vehicle cosmological presentation and the Dzogchen view of spontaneous presence (lhun grub) and original purity (kadag). The beings in these realms are not truly newly born, as their fundamental nature as rigpa has never been separate from the expanse of reality (dbyings), even when obscured by co-emergent ignorance (lhan skyes ma rig pa). The four elements expressed through the term dbyings demonstrate how the ultimate ground manifests as the apparent world without ever departing from its own nature. The citations from Guhyagarbha Tantra and the Condensed Perfection of Wisdom establish the scriptural authority for this cosmological framework while pointing toward its ultimate resolution in the recognition of mind nature. View-context: this appears as the acknowledgment that even this elaborate cosmology remains within conventional truth, pointing toward the ultimate view of Dzogchen where all manifestation is the spontaneous play of awareness never departing from the ground of being. Translation risks obscure the citation from Guhyagarbha Tantra (e ma ho bde gshegs snying po las) that grounds this cosmology in tantric authority, potentially severing the connection between this descriptive cosmology and its ultimate purpose as a support for recognizing mind nature. Preservation requirements note the distinction between this common vehicle presentation and the Dzogchen view of spontaneous presence that transcends sequential causation, ensuring that readers understand both the conventional accuracy and ultimate emptiness of this cosmological description.

Structural function details the descent of beings from higher samadhi states through the sound of interacting wheels, establishing the consciousness base of infinite space (rnam shes mtha' yas kyi skye mched) as the first of the four formless realms. The wheels touching and producing self-arising sound creates the acoustic trigger for consciousness differentiation, demonstrating how subtle sensory experience initiates the process of coarse manifestation. These beings, falling from the peaceful abiding of one-pointed concentration, expand into countless forms through consciousness alone, establishing the pattern of how awareness proliferates into multiplicity while remaining fundamentally undivided. This operates within view-register as the progressive coarsening of consciousness, where undifferentiated awareness begins to grasp at appearances as external, initiating the cascade of dualistic perception that characterizes samsaric existence. Translation risks misrepresent the technical term skye mched (sense-base) as merely realm or abode rather than recognizing it as the interface between consciousness and apparent objects where the fundamental split between subject and object occurs. Preservation requirements maintain the precise description of wheel sounds (phrad pa'i sgra rang byung) as the acoustic trigger for consciousness differentiation, demonstrating the sophisticated Buddhist understanding of how sensory experience catalyzes the emergence of conceptual mind.

Structural function establishes the gradual diminution of lifespan, body size, and light clarity as beings descend to lower realms, correlating these qualities with the strength of samadhi and merit. The systematic correspondence between meditative stability and manifested qualities demonstrates the inverse relationship between conceptual grasping and manifest clarity—wherever mind becomes more fixated, appearance becomes more coarse and limited. The four formless realms—infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and peak of existence—with their specific lifespans ranging from 20,000 to 80,000 great eons, establish the complete map of subtle existence beyond coarse form. The hermeneutical frame presents the inverse relationship between conceptual grasping and manifest clarity, demonstrating how distraction leads to densification while sustained attention creates spaciousness and longevity. Translation risks obscure the systematic correlation between meditative stability (ting nge 'dzin), merit strength (bsod nams kyi stobs), and manifested qualities, potentially reducing these relationships to poetic metaphor rather than precise phenomenological description. Preservation requirements note the four formless realms with their specific lifespans establish the complete map of subtle existence, providing essential reference points for understanding the full spectrum of possible experience from the most refined formless states to the coarsest material embodiments.

Structural function addresses the apparent contradiction between formless realms and body appearance, resolving it through the understanding of samadhi light bodies that are not composed of flesh and blood but of the luminosity of concentrated mind. These beings, while appearing to have form from the perspective of lower realms, are actually consciousness-only abiding in the joy and pleasure of meditative absorption, demonstrating the continuity between formless consciousness and subtle form. The graduated hierarchy of form realm heavens—with body sizes ranging from 0.5 to 64 yojanas and lifespans from 1 to 64 intermediate kalpas—establishes precise quantitative distinctions between levels of meditative attainment. The register indicates demonstrating the continuity between formless consciousness and subtle form, bridging the gap between pure awareness and manifestation while showing how the apparent contradiction dissolves upon deeper understanding. Translation risks misrepresent 'od gsal expanding as merely clear light rather than recognizing it as the transitional state between formless and formed existence where consciousness begins to show its own nature as appearance. Preservation requirements maintain the precise enumeration of form realm heavens with their corresponding body sizes and lifespans that establish the graduated cosmological hierarchy, ensuring that the quantitative precision of this cosmological system is preserved for accurate understanding and practice.

Structural function details the six desire god races with their specific locations, body measurements, and lifespan calculations relative to human time, establishing a comprehensive map of the desire realm's vertical hierarchy. The Mastery of Others' Emanations heaven (gzan 'phrul dbang byed) with its body of 1.5 yojanas and lifespan of 16,000 years calculated as 1,600 human years per day represents the pinnacle of desire realm existence, where beings have such mastery over their environment that they can manifest enjoyment forms at will. The Joyous heaven (dga' ldan) and Free from Conflict heaven ('thab bral) represent descending levels of meditative stability and enjoyment, with corresponding reductions in body size and lifespan. View register presents these increasingly refined states of meditative stability where enjoyment becomes less dependent on coarse materiality, demonstrating how concentration power creates corresponding experiential environments. Translation risks obscure the technical measurements that establish precise hierarchical distinctions, potentially reducing these descriptions to mere storytelling when they actually represent systematic phenomenological categories. Preservation requirements note the inverse relationship between realm height and lifespan/body size demonstrates the trade-off between stability and manifestation—higher realms have longer lives and larger bodies due to greater meditative stability, while lower realms have shorter lives and smaller bodies due to increased distraction and affliction.

Structural function establishes the thirty-three god realm with its specific features including the elephant rab brtan with gold and turquoise heads, the ma 'dres phreng 'bar abodes, and the 33 actions of Indra, creating a complete administrative center for the desire realm. The four great kings (rgyal chen bzhi) as protectors of the four continents represent the boundary between divine and human realms, maintaining order and protecting the Dharma. The specific measurements—body 0.25 to 0.5 yojanas, life 500 to 1,000 years calculated from 50 to 100 human years per day—establish quantitative distinctions that reflect qualitative differences in consciousness refinement. This view-classification shows the administrative structure of the desire realm, where beings with greater merit assume responsibility for maintaining cosmic order while enjoying the fruits of their virtuous karma. Translation risks reduce the four great kings to merely directional guardians rather than recognizing them as representations of the four immeasurables manifesting in form to protect practitioners and maintain the conditions for Dharma practice. Preservation requirements maintain the specific measurements that establish quantitative distinctions between desire realm levels, ensuring that the proportional relationships between body size, lifespan, and realm elevation remain accurate for proper cosmological understanding.

Structural function describes the four types of demigods (asuras)—the tshé dpal lha race with bodies and lifespans equal to the thirty-three gods, the powerful yaksha race equal to the four great kings, the fierce naga race, and the destructive preta race—establishing the boundary between harmony and conflict in the cosmological order. These beings represent the karmic consequence of jealous competitiveness, possessing sufficient merit for divine birth but lacking the mental stability to enjoy it fully due to constant envy and warfare with the gods. The asuras' abode in the hollow of Mount Meru below the water line symbolizes their liminal position between the divine and lower realms. View register presents these as the karmic consequence of jealous competitiveness, representing the boundary between harmony and conflict in the cosmological order where beings with sufficient merit for peace are prevented from enjoying it by their own mental afflictions. Translation risks misrepresent the asuras as merely angry gods rather than recognizing them as beings whose merit was sufficient for divine birth but whose jealousy creates constant warfare, demonstrating how mental affliction can sabotage even highly favorable circumstances. Preservation requirements note the inclusion of demigods within both god and demigod categories establishes the fluid boundaries between these realms, acknowledging that the distinctions between divine, demigod, and lower existence are not absolute but depend on karmic conditions and mental states.

Structural function presents the origin narrative of Jambudvīpa humans from the two divine sons (nyi ma rab tu snang byed and zla ba dri med) who fell from the clear light state through desiring solid food, establishing the archetypal fall from pure awareness into dualistic grasping. The appearance of the thousand-petaled light lotus and the 64,000 stars as signs of the Great Perfection Dharma's future dissemination establishes this event as significant for the spiritual history of the universe, not merely a biological origin story. The three gazes—of beings, of taming, and of showing—demonstrate the interdependent arising of teacher, teaching, and student in the cosmic order. View-context: this appears as the archetypal fall from pure awareness into dualistic grasping, establishing the fundamental human condition as one of having fallen from primordial clarity through the arising of desire yet retaining the potential for re-awakening. Translation risks reduce the narrative to mere myth rather than recognizing it as the description of consciousness coarsening through habitual tendencies, demonstrating how the human condition results from the progressive development of attachment and conceptual fixation. Preservation requirements maintain the specific details (light lotus with thousand petals, 64,000 stars appearing as signs, 17 beautiful stars as tantra signs) that establish the timing and significance of human emergence within the broader context of cosmic spiritual evolution.

Structural function details the three gazes and the emergence of the first teachings from the expanse of reality (sgra thal 'gyur), establishing the precedent for all subsequent Dharma transmission as spontaneous arising from the ground of being rather than human invention. The gradual diminution of lifespan from immeasurable to 100,000 years and body size from 32 elbows correlates with increasing conceptual complexity and the arising of social structures, demonstrating how mental affliction creates corresponding external conditions. The womb-born beings of the Manifest Attachment eon represent the final stage of human coarsening before the current era of decreasing lifespan and increasing conflict. This operates within view-register as the spontaneous arising of wisdom from the ground of being, establishing the precedent for all subsequent Dharma transmission as revelation rather than construction, pointing to the ever-present availability of awakening regardless of historical circumstances. Translation risks obscure the significance of the 17 beautiful stars as prophetic indicators of the 17 most secret unsurpassed tantras, potentially severing the connection between cosmological events and the temporal unfolding of Buddhist teachings. Preservation requirements note the gradual diminution of lifespan and body size correlates with increasing conceptual complexity, establishing the inverse relationship between mental simplicity and longevity that characterizes Buddhist cosmological history.

Structural function describes the progressive coarsening of human existence through the eons, from the light-egg born beings of 'jig rten mi mjed (World Without Fear) who flew through the sky and fed on elemental essences, to the womb-born beings of chags 'byung (Attachment-Arising) where sexual differentiation and familial structures emerged. The appearance of shame, sexual organs, and the need for clothing mark the stages of increasing ego-consciousness and social complexity, as beings lost their natural luminosity and became increasingly dependent on external resources. The sālu fields that grew spontaneously without plowing represent the original abundance available to beings before possessiveness and hoarding created scarcity. The hermeneutical frame presents the karmic maturation of increasing attachment, where external conditions reflect internal states of consciousness, demonstrating how the external world becomes increasingly coarse and demanding as mind becomes more fixated and grasping. Translation risks misrepresent the land names as merely chronological markers rather than descriptions of collective karmic fruition, potentially reducing them to mythological time periods rather than recognizing them as precise phenomenological categories describing the quality of collective consciousness. Preservation requirements maintain the correlation between merit decrease, affliction increase, and birth mode transformation, ensuring that the systematic relationship between mental states and manifested conditions remains clear.

Structural function continues the narrative of human decline with the arising of shame, sexual differentiation, and the accumulation of karma through grasping at earth essence, establishing the foundation of samsaric existence in the bifurcation of subject and object. The sequence of shame arising, houses building, and grain diminishing demonstrates the dependent origination of human social structures, showing how the fundamental error of ego-consciousness proliferates into complex institutional forms. The appearance of unplowed self-grown sālu fields that ripened in a single day represents the original abundance that was lost through possessiveness and the concept of private property. The register indicates the emergence of ego-consciousness through the bifurcation of subject and object, establishing the foundation of samsaric existence in the fundamental split between self and other that arises with the grasping at identity. Translation risks reduce the description of sālu fields and spontaneous grain to mere agricultural history rather than recognizing them as symbols of original abundance lost through possessiveness, failing to see the psychological and spiritual dimensions of this cosmological narrative. Preservation requirements note the specific sequence (shame arising, houses building, grain diminishing) establishes the dependent origination of human social structures, providing insight into how Buddhist cosmology understands the evolution of human civilization as driven by karmic forces rather than technological progress.

Structural function describes the emergence of kingship, social organization, and the eight hot and cold hells as the karmic consequence of accumulated three poisons, demonstrating how institutionalized egoic structures inevitably produce corresponding suffering. The eight hot hells—Reviving, Black Line, Crushing, Weeping, Great Weeping, Hot, Intensely Hot, and Unrelenting—along with the eight cold hells—Blister, Burst Blister, Brr, Shivering, Chattering Teeth, Lotus-Like, Utpala-Like, and Great Lotus-Like—provide a comprehensive mapping of the possible intensities of suffering resulting from intense mental affliction. The calculation of hell lifespans in relation to god realm time establishes the proportional relationship between karma and its result. This view-classification shows the institutionalization of egoic structures and their inevitable consequences, demonstrating how confusion begets suffering in ever-intensifying cycles until the karma that sustains them is exhausted. Translation risks obscure the specific measurements of hell lifespans calculated in relation to god realm time, potentially reducing them to moralistic threats rather than precise karmic mechanics showing how mental states create corresponding experiential environments. Preservation requirements maintain the detailed enumeration of hell realms as essential for understanding the full scope of possible existence, ensuring that the complete range of samsaric potential is mapped for practitioners to understand the stakes of their practice and the urgency of liberation.

Structural function provides comprehensive enumeration of the lower realms with detailed descriptions of their characteristics and karmic causes, completing the mapping of samsaric possibility from the highest formless realms to the most intense hellish sufferings. The nearby hells (nye 'khor) surrounding the main hells demonstrate that suffering has no fixed boundary but extends in all directions according to the particular mental afflictions that produced them, appearing as various forms of earth, water, fire, and wind. The pretas inhabit a city 500 yojanas below the root with branches extending throughout the god and human worlds, representing the ubiquitous nature of desire and its inability to find satisfaction. View-context: this appears as the complete mapping of samsaric possibility, leaving no corner of confusion unexamined and demonstrating the thoroughness of Buddhist phenomenological analysis in cataloging all possible states of experience. Translation risks misrepresent the hell guardians (bird and dog forms) as merely sadistic inventions rather than recognizing them as projections of one's own aggressive tendencies externalized as tormentors, failing to understand how hell is the mind's own creation projected outward. Preservation requirements note the nearby hells surrounding the main hells establish that suffering has no fixed boundary, ensuring that readers understand hell not as a specific location but as the inevitable result of particular mental states manifesting as environmental torment.

Structural function concludes with lifespan calculations for the lower realms, establishing the temporal scope of suffering based on the heaviness of karma and demonstrating the precise mechanics of cause and effect. The systematic calculation methodology—converting human years to god realm days and then calculating the resulting lifespan—establishes proportional relationships across all realms that reflect the precise correspondence between mental action and experiential result. The final summary that desire-heavy karma matures as pretas while ignorance-heavy karma matures as animals establishes the correlation between specific mental afflictions and their corresponding resultant existences. This operates within view-register as demonstrating the precise mechanics of cause and effect, where the duration of experience directly corresponds to the intensity of confusion, showing how karma operates with mathematical precision to create environments that mirror the mental states that produced them. Translation risks obscure the systematic calculation methodology that establishes proportional relationships across all realms, potentially reducing these calculations to arbitrary moralistic exaggeration rather than recognizing them as precise descriptions of how mental momentum creates corresponding temporal duration. Preservation requirements maintain the final summary establishing the correlation between mental affliction and resultant existence, ensuring that readers understand the relationship between specific karmic causes (desire, anger, ignorance) and their corresponding results (preta, hell, animal) as a precise phenomenological description rather than moralistic judgment.
