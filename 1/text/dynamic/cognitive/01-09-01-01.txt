Self-Arisen Rigpa citation: nature of primordial purity not falling into India or Tibet directions. Precious Jewel Casket of Spontaneous Presence with eight modes of appearance, two gates. Ground of Spontaneous Presence, Ground of Indeterminacy, Ground Appearing as Diversity. Point of reversal below. Great Ground-Appearance, Sambhogakāya appearance. Essence abiding as form in youthful vase body of primordial expanse, nature as speech, compassion as mind. Outward projection of rigpa tones in five wisdom winds with four limbs of life-wind. Tones of spontaneous presence in expanding expanse, five lights as fiery sparks. Investigating consciousness arises toward rigpa-compassion tones, not knowing own face, abides as non-recognition dependent upon rigpa. Ground itself does not change, ground-appearance arising seems to change: change of appearance in rigpa. Primordially pure appearance like cloudless sky, eight modes of spontaneous presence as self-appearance. Great manner of appearance of precious casket jewel: gate of compassion unobstructed gives rise to compassion for sentient beings. Gate of light unobstructed fills appearances with self-light of five wisdoms like rainbow. Gate of wisdom unobstructed abides in non-conceptuality. Gate of form unobstructed fills space with clear light bodies of peaceful and wrathful deities. Gate of non-duality unobstructed does not conceive singular or plural. Gate of beyond-extremes unobstructed makes spontaneous presence naturally clear. Gate of pure wisdom unobstructed reveals appearances above like cloudless sky, primordially pure appearance. Gate of impure saṃsāra unobstructed reveals appearances of six realms below. Saṃsāra and lower realms manifest in spontaneous presence. From power of spontaneous presence appearance, within five wisdom fields, Sambhogakāya appearances directly self-clear. From power of qualities in directions, Natural Nirmāṇakāya fields appear self-arisen immeasurable. From power of compassion below, sentient beings appear immeasurably self-appearing. Ground-appearance clarity like reflections in mirror, appearing to oneself not others, not recognized as self-appearance, like dream appearances. Arising suddenly, flickering, inconstant, not grasping own face for single moment. Spontaneous presence appearance within primordial purity. Great primordial ground-appearance of clear light bindus and light rays. Sambhogakāya appearance, Natural Nirmāṇakāya appearance, appearance of six realms. Six Subduers, Nirmanakayas subduing beings, impure Nirmāṇakāya fields taming through birth aging sickness death. Eight modes of spontaneous presence source from which all arise, like container for roasting barley, called casket. Auspicious Beautiful Great Tantra: no error but from power error arises, from unchanging ground appearing without ceasing, from compassion's indeterminacy non-recognition self-arises. Clouds do not truly exist in sky but arise adventitiously, ground path and rigpa do not exist as such, yet from appearing like compassion non-recognition arises.
