[11322-11479]
Peaceful and wrathful kayas (zhi khro'i sku)—the manifestation of enlightenment in both serene and energetic forms. To those possessing the method of nirvana (mya ngan las 'das pa'i thabs yod pa rnams la)—with contaminated remainder (zag bcas lhag ma)—aggregates trace burned and purified (phung po'i rjes 'tshig bsreg sbyangs). Two kayas emerge: Peaceful Kaya (zhi ba'i sku) and Wrathful Kaya (khro bo'i sku). View register: two modes of enlightened expression, appropriate to different circumstances.

[Extended Analysis: Contaminated Remainder and Purification]
The "contaminated remainder" (zag bcas lhag ma) refers to the residual traces of the aggregates after the main obscurations are purified. These traces must be "burned and purified" (bsreg sbyangs)—transmuted through the heat of practice. View register: purification as refinement, not destruction. Translation risk: "burned" suggesting violent destruction. Preservation: bsreg means refined by heat, like gold purified in fire. The aggregates are not destroyed but purified—their enlightened nature revealed.

[Extended Analysis: Peaceful and Wrathful as Unified]
Wrathful cannot empower emanation without peaceful (zhi ba med par khro bo sprul pa'i nus pa mi mnga'). The wrathful forms derive their power from the peaceful foundation. View register: wrathful as expression of peaceful, not alternative. Translation risk: wrathful as separate or superior. Preservation: khro bo (wrathful) is the dynamic expression of zhi ba (peaceful)—the energy of compassion in active form. Without the settled peaceful basis, wrathful becomes mere aggression.

[Extended Analysis: Continuum of Two from Essence-Cause]
The continuum: two from essence-cause (thig le las rgyu'i gzhi las gnyis 'byung). All beings primordially abiding as clear-light kaya ('od gsal sku ru gnas pa'i sems can thams cad ye nas). View register: peaceful and wrathful as naturally present in all beings. Translation risk: "cause" suggesting production over time. Preservation: rgyu means cause or ground—peaceful and wrathful are potentialities naturally present, not created. The clear-light nature is the ground of both.

[Extended Analysis: From Existing Relics Manifest Cause]
From existing relics (ring bsrel yod pa), creation-completion (bskyed rdzogs) shows manifest cause arising from gathered pure elements (dngos po dag pa 'dus las dngos rgyu shar). Relics indicate successful transformation of elements; from this, the kayas manifest. View register: relics as signs, kayas as full manifestation. Translation risk: relics as merely physical remains. Preservation: ring bsrel are the residual signs of purification; full manifestation is the complete kaya. The pure elements gathered create the conditions for appearance.

[Extended Analysis: Latency Not-Yet-Ripened Nature]
Latency (bag la nyal) is the not-yet-ripened nature—the potential for manifestation not yet actualized. View register: latency as seed, ripening as maturation. Translation risk: "latency" suggesting mere potential. Preservation: bag la nyal is powerful potential—like a seed containing the tree. The peaceful and wrathful kayas are latent in all beings, ripening through practice.

[Extended Analysis: Manifest Ripened Appearing as Relics]
Manifest ripened (smin par snang ba) appearing as relics—when the latency ripens, it first appears as relics (ringsel). View register: relics as preliminary manifestation. Translation risk: relics as final product. Preservation: ringsel are signs of ripening; full kaya manifestation follows. The relics indicate successful transmutation; complete kayas are the fruition.

[Extended Analysis: Place - Greatly Arising from Head or Spine]
The place of manifestation: greatly arising from head (dbu) or spine (rkang pa)—the clear-light-familiar arising-kaya (gsal snang mched pa'i sku) from those two. View register: head and spine as power centers. Translation risk: anatomical literalism. Preservation: dbu (head/crown) and rkang pa (spine) are energetic centers—crown chakra and central channel. The kayas arise from where the subtle body is most refined.

[Extended Analysis: Clear-Light-Familiar Arising-Kaya]
The clear-light-familiar arising-kaya (gsal snang mched pa'i sku) indicates the kaya that manifests through familiarity with clear light. View register: arising from practice, not created. Translation risk: "arising" suggesting production. Preservation: mched pa means manifesting or increasing—through familiarity (goms pa) with clear light, the kaya naturally manifests. This is not creation but revelation.

[Extended Analysis: Dzogchen System Distinction]
The structural note emphasizes this is the "Dzogchen system of peaceful/wrathful kaya manifestation." View register: distinctive Dzogchen approach to kayas. Translation risk: sectarian distinction. Preservation: Dzogchen sees peaceful and wrathful as naturally present and manifesting through practice, not as distant goals achieved only at enlightenment. This is immediate and practical.

[Extended Analysis: Peaceful Kaya Characteristics]
Peaceful kaya (zhi ba'i sku) represents the settled, stable aspect of enlightenment—equanimity, openness, tranquility. It is the foundation for all enlightened activity. View register: peaceful as basis, not weakness. Translation risk: peaceful appearing passive. Preservation: zhi ba is powerful stability, not mere calm. It is the ocean depths—still, vast, powerful—from which waves of wrathful activity can arise.

[Extended Analysis: Wrathful Kaya Characteristics]
Wrathful kaya (khro bo'i sku) represents the dynamic, active aspect of enlightenment—powerful compassion that confronts obstacles directly. View register: wrathful as compassionate activity, not anger. Translation risk: wrathful appearing aggressive or violent. Preservation: khro bo is fierce compassion—the intense energy of wisdom confronting delusion. It is not anger but the powerful expression of enlightened intent.

[Extended Analysis: Method of Nirvana Possession]
"To those possessing the method of nirvana" indicates that peaceful and wrathful kayas manifest to those who have the methods—the practices that reveal these aspects. View register: methods as conditions for manifestation. Translation risk: "possessing" suggesting ownership. Preservation: thabs yod pa means having the means or methods—the practices that allow these kayas to manifest. Without method, the latency remains unripened.

[Structural Synthesis: Peaceful and Wrathful Kaya Framework]
This section (11322-11479) presents the complete Dzogchen framework for peaceful and wrathful kaya manifestation. The architecture establishes the two kayas as naturally present, arising from the clear-light ground through the process of purification and ripening. The view throughout is that peaceful and wrathful are not separate or opposed but unified expressions of enlightenment—peaceful as foundation, wrathful as dynamic expression. The translator must preserve the technical terminology—zag bcas lhag ma, bag la nyal, smin pa—while conveying that these are natural processes of manifestation, not magical productions. The relics, head and spine centers, and clear-light familiarity indicate this is embodied practice—transformation of the physical basis into enlightened manifestation.
