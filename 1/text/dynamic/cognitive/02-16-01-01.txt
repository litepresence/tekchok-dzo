[685-1020]
Structural opening establishing Three Kayas through completion, awakening, expansion. View register: Dzogchen self-liberation, not progressive path. Risk: "self-arising" as technical term—preserve. The "threefold expansion" framework structures kaya presentation.

Detailed definition of Dharmakāya through ten aspects: essence, definition, self-body, metaphor, sign, appearance, place, characteristic, object, intent. Structural function: systematic kaya exposition. View register: philosophical definition, more analytical than preceding sections. Risk: "self-body" as technical term—maintain consistency.

Continues Dharmakāya definition through object, intent, and the view-meditation-conduct-fruition-enlightened activity framework. Establishes Dharmakāya as basis for all subsequent kaya explanation. Risk: terminology precision critical here due to philosophical density.

Extensive Sambhogakāya enumeration through five fathers, five mothers, five clusters, five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations, five bases, five paths, five fruitions, five abodes, five fields, five essences. Structural function: complete enumerative mapping. Risk: "five paths" requires distinction between common and uncommon—preserve technical precision.

Sambhogakāya etymology and detailed characteristic exposition. The verse sections present self-qualification structure. View register: tantric deity mandala correspondence. Risk: "father-mother" as technical dyad—preserve without literal reading.

Sambhogakāya appearance and abiding manner with extensive quotation from tantric sources. Establishes emanation-radiating continuity. View register: Dzogchen self-appearance doctrine. Risk: "self-appearance" as technical term requires consistent translation throughout.

Nirmāṇakāya introduction and etymology—appears fragmented in source with placeholder markers. Structural function: transition to five kayas particular explanation. View register: emanation-taming correspondence. Note: source contains significant gaps requiring attention.

Five kayas particular explanation: essence, etymology, appearance, divisions, meaning application. Structural function: five-family kaya mapping. Risk: "family" as Buddha-family technical term.
