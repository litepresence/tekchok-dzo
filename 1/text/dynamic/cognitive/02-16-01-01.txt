[1-50]
Structural opening establishing Three Kayas through completion, awakening, expansion. View register: Dzogchen self-liberation, not progressive path. Risk: "self-arising" as technical term—preserve. The "threefold expansion" framework structures kaya presentation.

[51-100]
Detailed definition of Dharmakāya through ten aspects: essence, definition, self-body, metaphor, sign, appearance, place, characteristic, object, intent. Structural function: systematic kaya exposition. View register: philosophical definition, more analytical than preceding sections. Risk: "self-body" as technical term—maintain consistency.

[101-150]
Continues Dharmakāya definition through object, intent, and the view-meditation-conduct-fruition-enlightened activity framework. Establishes Dharmakāya as basis for all subsequent kaya explanation. Risk: terminology precision critical here due to philosophical density.

[151-220]
Extensive Sambhogakāya enumeration through five fathers, five mothers, five clusters, five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations, five bases, five paths, five fruitions, five abodes, five fields, five essences. Structural function: complete enumerative mapping. Risk: "five paths" requires distinction between common and uncommon—preserve technical precision.

[221-290]
Sambhogakāya etymology and detailed characteristic exposition. The verse sections present self-qualification structure. View register: tantric deity mandala correspondence. Risk: "father-mother" as technical dyad—preserve without literal reading.

[291-340]
Sambhogakāya appearance and abiding manner with extensive quotation from tantric sources. Establishes emanation-radiating continuity. View register: Dzogchen self-appearance doctrine. Risk: "self-appearance" as technical term requires consistent translation throughout.

[341-380]
Nirmāṇakāya introduction and etymology—appears fragmented in source with placeholder markers. Structural function: transition to five kayas particular explanation. View register: emanation-taming correspondence. Note: source contains significant gaps requiring attention.

[381-420]
Five kayas particular explanation: essence, etymology, appearance, divisions, meaning application. Structural function: five-family kaya mapping. Risk: "family" as Buddha-family technical term.
