The opening presents vajra family purification as the foundation of the five-family mandala structure. Mirror-like wisdom's own radiance appears as white color, with the white radiance of Akshobhya Vajra Unshakable One shining forth as the ground of all subsequent appearances. This establishes the correlation between buddha families, wisdoms, and color manifestations that structures the entire presentation. The structural function maps the five-wisdom schema onto visionary experience, providing practitioners with reference points for recognizing the nature of their experiences. The view register maintains the non-duality of wisdom and its display—colors are not external objects but the self-radiance of awareness itself. Translation must preserve the technical terminology of "own radiance" while conveying its immediate experiential significance rather than allowing metaphysical abstraction to obscure direct recognition.

Tathagata family purification produces dharmadhatu wisdom appearing as blue color, the deep blue radiance of Vairocana manifesting with the characteristic of pervading all space. Ratna family purification produces equality wisdom as yellow color, the shining radiance of Ratnasambhava appearing like refined gold, rich and warm. The systematic presentation demonstrates the completeness of the five-family framework, showing how each family corresponds to a specific wisdom, color, and kaya aspect. Translation risk lies in rendering color terms precisely while acknowledging their visionary rather than physical nature—these are not ordinary colors but the display of awareness-emptiness.

Padma family purification produces discriminating wisdom as red color, the deeply red radiance of Amitabha resembling the color of ruby or coral. Karma family purification produces all-accomplishing wisdom as green color, the very green radiance of Amoghasiddhi appearing like beryl or emerald. The outer rim surrounded by blue vajra fence indicates the non-difference of these wisdoms in essence despite their distinct manifestations. This imagery provides the mandala structure for visionary experience, establishing the organized cosmos that appears to recognition. Each detail carries precise meaning: the fence indicates protection and boundary, the arrangement shows interdependence, and the colors represent the play of awareness.

From this foundation, appearance increase emerges—five lights individually predominant, with colors five by five distinct—arising from family and family distinctions. Wisdom wind purification produces mirror-like appearances vertically oriented, supporting the increase of experience through stable recognition. Equality wing appearing eastward indicates that deluded appearance is nearing exhaustion, with coarse fixation dissolving. Discriminating wheel-cut appearing indicates the cessation of subtle elemental fixation, moving beyond even the most refined objectification. All-accomplishing like weapon appearance arises from unmodified nature, demonstrating spontaneous activity without contrivance.

Dharmadhatu wisdom appearing as fortress indicates that coarse thoughts have completely ceased, leaving only the spacious ground of being. From that, various forms like wheels appear from complete preliminary practice, showing the fruition of sustained recognition. The arising sequence establishes timeframes: excellent diligence achieves results in five days each, medium capacity requires seven days, and the last require twenty-one days, with higher appearance ceasing as lower appears. This provides practice benchmarks while acknowledging individual variation in capacity, conditions, and karmic inheritance. Colors and shapes may appear momentarily here, indicating the transitional nature of even sublime experiences.

The citation from Rangjung Gyud establishes the recognition of one's own face: "Separated by four inches from upper joint, fortunate one with good karma, how could you enter samsara? Wheel-cut completely appearing accomplishes emanation qualities. Whatever appearing as seen object, likewise in the sphere. Outer appearance ceasing becomes sixteen moments." This scriptural authority supports the visionary progression, demonstrating that individual experience participates in universal structure. The structural function connects personal recognition to the timeless wisdom tradition, validating experience without allowing personal inflation or spiritual materialism.

The final verses summarize the complete path: recognition of one's own nature, the impossibility of returning to samsara once true nature is seen, the accomplishment of emanation qualities through wheel-cut appearance, and the transformation of outer appearance into moments of pure awareness. The presentation maintains throughout the emphasis on direct recognition rather than philosophical analysis—these appearances support recognition but are not the goal themselves. The practitioner who recognizes these as self-appearance progresses toward complete liberation.
