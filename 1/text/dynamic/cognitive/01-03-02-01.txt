[1671-1676]
Worldly aggregates exposition. Form, feeling, recognition, formation, consciousness—grasped, afflictive. Standard fivefold structure of conditioned existence. Each aggregate analyzed for essence, cause, and result. Preservation requirement: maintain Abhidharma technical terminology without psychological reduction.

[1677-1692]
Transcendent aggregates exposition. Thought-free aggregates abiding in self-knowing aspect of aryas beyond world. Samatha-vipasyana nature as samādhi aggregate. Liberated from own afflictions as wisdom aggregate. Seeing own-common nature as discerning aggregate. Fivefold structure parallel to ordinary aggregates but transformed through path. Not different substances but different mode of abiding. Preserve distinction between ordinary and transcendent aggregates.

[1693-1709]
Ethics aggregate for purifying stains. Liberation aggregate beyond all conceptualization. Sense-bases: what arises and expands from what. Six objects like form for eye, sound for ear, etc. Arising and expanding as mutual dependent origination. Twelve sense-bases: six internal apprehenders, six external objects. Not creator-creation but simultaneous conditionality. Preserve Abhidharma framework.

[1710-1731]
Elements as basis: five great elements as ground of appearance. Earth-solid, water-moist, fire-hot, wind-moving, space-accommodating. Not material substances but qualities of experience. Eighteen dhatus: six sense-bases plus six objects plus six consciousnesses. Complete phenomenological analysis. Preserve enumeration structure without losing forest for trees.
