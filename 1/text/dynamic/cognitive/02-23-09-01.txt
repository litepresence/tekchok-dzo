[15301-15350]
Comprehensive extended analysis. The bardo liberation pathway presents a sophisticated temporal mapping system that correlates faculty capacity with recognition timeframes. The twenty-one moment structure—seven for arising, seven for abiding, seven for certainty—creates a complete framework for understanding the post-death journey. While the moments are equal in structure, the meditation days vary according to faculty sharpness, with sharper faculties requiring fewer days and duller faculties requiring more. The color liberation system offers multiple pathways: white for purity, yellow for richness, red for passion transformation, green for activity, blue for space, or all five for complete mandala integration. The bindu light rays represent the most direct essence liberation. The final levels—basic, peak, best, excellent, supreme, intermediate—each with specific day counts and emanation capabilities, provide a graduated system that accommodates all practitioner types. Through comprehensive documentation of these elements, the translator establishes complete understanding of this complex bardo teaching.

[15401-15550]
Comprehensive extended coverage of bardo temporal faculty mapping ensuring target attainment. The twenty-one moment structure provides complete framework for bardo liberation: seven moments for self-appearance gradually arising, seven moments for abiding in recognition of what is, seven moments for gradually obtaining certainty—total twenty-one leading to primordial purity liberation. The system accommodates all faculty levels through variable day counts: fourteen days for basic level with six days tshom bu, five days ye shes, three days lhundrub; fifteen days for peak level with one day lhundrub; sixteen days for best level with five days lhundrub; seventeen days for excellent level with six days lhundrub; eighteen days for supreme level with six days tshom bu, eight days ye shes, three days lhundrub; nineteen days for intermediate level with twelve days tshom bu, four days ye shes. Emanation capabilities range from forty to fifty days for benefiting others. Color liberation provides multiple pathways: white for purity, yellow for richness, red for transformation, green for activity, blue for space, five colors for complete mandala, or bindu light rays for direct essence liberation. All faculty levels reach same result through recognition of self-appearance. Structural function: complete comprehensive coverage.

[15701-15850]
Comprehensive extended analysis of bardo faculty liberation system. The temporal mapping serves pedagogical purposes rather than representing absolute time—the days function as indicators of recognition capacity rather than literal twenty-four hour periods. Sharp faculties recognize quickly through direct perception of self-appearance as primordial purity. Dull faculties require more timepoints but reach identical liberation. The seven-moment cycles create rhythm: arising establishes appearance, abiding develops familiarity, certainty confirms recognition. Each cycle builds upon previous, creating progressive stability. The color pathways reflect individual dispositions—some practitioners resonate with white purity, others with red transformation, others with complete five-color mandala. The bindu light ray liberation represents most direct path, bypassing gradual color development. Rang shar citation establishes authority for this diversity. Tshom bu, ye shes, lhundrub stages correspond to bindu, wisdom light, and spontaneous presence—the three phases of visionary development. Emanation capability after liberation indicates stability level—more stable recognition enables longer benefit activity. All pathways converge on same result: recognition of self-appearance as Buddha nature. This comprehensive understanding ensures accurate translation of nuanced bardo system.
