Bardo liberation pathway presentation—temporal faculty mapping. Structural function: sequential exposition with progressive temporal markers (zhag gcig, zhag gnyis) correlating faculties to liberation timeframes. View register: detailed phenomenological mapping of post-death states. Translation: preserve tsm bu (bindu), ye shes 'od (wisdom light), lhun grub, zhag grangs (temporal progression) technical vocabulary. Note: the temporal markers function pedagogically, not absolutely—faculties correlate with liberation windows. Translation risk: treating zhag (day/count) literally obscures the symbolic correspondence. Preservation: bindu dynamics and wisdom light recognition as liberation trigger represent core Dzogchen bardo methodology.
