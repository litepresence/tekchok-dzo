[14823-14850]
The bardo liberation pathway begins with temporal faculty mapping. First, self-appearance gradually arises through seven moments. Once arisen, abiding as-is recognition occurs through seven more moments. Knowing that self-appearance, gradually obtaining certainty requires seven additional moments. Twenty-one moments total lead to liberation into primordial purity. Before dissolving, emanation projects; then dissolves into primordial purity. This twenty-one moment structure creates complete framework for post-death recognition. Structural function: establish temporal framework for bardo liberation.

[14851-14880]
The twenty-one moments are equal in structure, yet meditation days vary according to faculty sharpness. Sharp faculties require fewer days; dull faculties require more. Days correlate with moments through specific correspondences. Faculty appearance manner and day numbers interconnect. Emanation distribution differs by individual capacity. Rang shar citation establishes diversity of liberation pathways: some liberate through white color, others through yellow, red, green, blue, five colors combined, or bindu light rays. This color diversity represents multiple entry points to the same result. Structural function: faculty-correlated timing with multiple pathways.

[14881-14910]
The final faculty liberation method presents systematic progression. Fourteen days mark the final ground obtaining. Tshom bu occupies six days above and below. Ye shes spans five days. Lhun grub requires three days at the final stage. Seeing own appearance results in Buddha recognition. Emanation capability extends forty days for benefiting others. This basic timeframe accommodates the dullest faculties through extended duration. Each component serves specific function in the recognition process. Structural function: basic timeframe for dullest faculties.

[14911-14940]
The final peak level reduces duration while maintaining structure. Fifteen days total, with tshom bu and ye shes as before. Lhun grub reduces to one day abiding. Final appearance recognition produces stability attainment. Emanation capability maintains forty days. This peak level represents moderate faculty capacity requiring less time for recognition. The structural elements remain constant while durations adjust. Structural function: peak level for moderate faculties.

[14941-14970]
The final best level further reduces timeframe. Sixteen days total with consistent tshom bu and ye shes allocation. Lhun grub extends to five days abiding. Final appearance recognition produces stability. Emanation capability increases to forty-six days. This best level accommodates sharper faculties through increased efficiency. The inverse correlation between faculty sharpness and required time becomes evident. Structural function: best level for sharper faculties.

[14971-15000]
The final excellent level demonstrates continued efficiency. Seventeen days total maintains structural consistency. Lhun grub requires six days abiding. Final appearance recognition yields stability. Emanation capability reaches forty-seven days. Progressively sharper faculties require progressively less time for recognition. The system accommodates all capacities without denying any practitioner the possibility of liberation. Structural function: excellent level for sharp faculties.

[15001-15030]
The final supreme level represents highest capacity. Eighteen days total with expanded ye shes allocation to eight days. Tshom bu occupies six days. Lhun grub maintains three days. Final appearance recognition produces stability. Emanation capability extends to fifty days. This supreme level serves the sharpest faculties with greatest efficiency. The complete range from fourteen to eighteen days covers all practitioner types. Structural function: supreme level for sharpest faculties.

[15031-15060]
The final intermediate level presents alternative configuration. Nineteen days total represents expanded timeframe for specific capacities. Tshom bu extends to twelve days. Ye shes reduces to four days. Lhun grub and final appearance recognition yield stability. Emanation capability follows established patterns. This intermediate level serves practitioners with different capacity distributions. The flexibility of the system accommodates diverse faculty configurations. Structural function: intermediate level for alternative capacities.

[15061-15090]
Temporal progression reveals comprehensive inverse correlation. Increasing days indicate decreasing faculty capacity. More time required reflects duller faculties. Fewer time required reflects sharper faculties. Yet all reach identical result through recognition of self-appearance. Time functions as pedagogical indicator rather than absolute measure. The correlation serves diagnostic purposes, not evaluative hierarchy. Structural function: inverse correlation as diagnostic tool.

[15091-15120]
Color liberation diversity establishes multiple pathways. White color liberation represents purity recognition. Yellow color liberation indicates richness transformation. Red color liberation demonstrates passion transformation. Green color liberation shows activity liberation. Blue color liberation reveals space recognition. Five colors combined create complete mandala integration. Bindu light rays offer most direct essence liberation. Each pathway suits different practitioner dispositions. Structural function: multiple pathways as disposition accommodation.

[15121-15150]
Recognition mechanics establish essential factors. Self-appearance serves as key recognition factor. Own appearance seeing produces Buddha result. Stability emerges through progressive attainment. Emanation follows liberation, enabling benefit to others. The mechanics operate automatically when recognition occurs—no forced effort required. Natural processes unfold according to recognition depth. Structural function: recognition as automatic mechanism.

[15151-15180]
Faculty correlation demonstrates capacity-based adaptation. Sharp faculties achieve recognition in fewer days. Dull faculties require extended timeframes. All reach identical result regardless of capacity differences. Time serves pedagogical purpose, not absolute constraint. The correlation enables appropriate preparation without creating hierarchical judgment. Each practitioner receives suitable guidance. Structural function: capacity-based timing without hierarchy.

[15181-15210]
Comprehensive summary consolidates complete system. Twenty-one moments provide complete recognition structure. Days vary according to faculty capacity. Colors offer multiple pathways. Recognition remains essential factor. Liberation results as certain outcome. All elements integrate into coherent framework. The summary confirms systematic completeness without gaps or contradictions. Structural function: complete system confirmation.

[15211-15240]
Practical application provides guidance for recognition. Recognition can occur at any moment within the sequence. Stability develops progressively through the stages. Emanation follows liberation, extending benefit. Continuous benefit activity demonstrates stability depth. The application transforms theoretical framework into lived experience. Recognition in any moment suffices for liberation. Structural function: practice guidance for moment recognition.

Comprehensive extended analysis of bardo faculty liberation system. Temporal mapping serves pedagogical purposes rather than representing absolute time—days function as recognition capacity indicators rather than literal twenty-four hour periods. Sharp faculties recognize quickly through direct perception of self-appearance as primordial purity. Dull faculties require more timepoints but reach identical liberation. Seven-moment cycles create rhythm: arising establishes appearance, abiding develops familiarity, certainty confirms recognition. Each cycle builds upon previous, creating progressive stability. Color pathways reflect individual dispositions—some resonate with white purity, others with red transformation, others with complete five-color mandala. Bindu light ray liberation represents most direct path, bypassing gradual color development. Rang shar citation establishes authority for diversity. Tshom bu, ye shes, lhundrub stages correspond to bindu, wisdom light, spontaneous presence—three phases of visionary development.
