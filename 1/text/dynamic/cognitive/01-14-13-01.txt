Differences between mind and awareness (sems vs. rig pa) and various meditation stages. First: mind without thought vs. awareness without object—they appear similar but awareness is more fundamental, like ocean vs. wave. Second: aware的基础 clarity vs. mind's objects—awareness without grasping, mind with grasping. Third: natural meditation vs. effortful meditation—effortful has conceptual support, natural is effortless. Fourth: awareness self-appearing vs. conceptual wandering—awareness arises without grasper/grasp, conceptual mind produces subject/object duality. Fifth: dharmata intermediate state vs. deity yoga—appearance of deities without actual union. Sixth: spontaneous presence vs. pure appearance—spontaneous presence arises from path, pure appearance remains within confusion. Seventh: final liberation vs. ground liberation—distinguishing liberation at fruit vs. recognition at ground. Eighth: ordinary mind vs. directly perceived awareness—difference between conceptual view and direct experience. Structural note: extensive enumeration of Dzogchen technical distinctions.
