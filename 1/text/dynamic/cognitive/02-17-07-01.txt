This section presents dream yoga preliminary practices and main techniques, establishing the foundational training for recognizing and transforming the dream state. The structural function moves from preliminary recognition of dreams through the three techniques—training, transforming, and cutting—to establish the complete practice framework. The opening description of recognizing fear-inducing conditions as dreams establishes the basic capacity for dream awareness.

The register operates in dream yoga technical terminology: dream recognition (rmi lam zin pa), training ('byongs pa), emanation (sprul pa), transformation (bsgyur ba), cutting (bcad pa), empty (stong pa), appearance-emptiness (snang stong). The preliminary practice of recognizing dreams through strong intention establishes the psychological foundation for subsequent techniques.

Translation risks center on preserving the specific techniques without conflating them. The training technique involves daytime practice of viewing all appearances as last night's dreams, then looking back at the observing awareness to see appearances as groundless, rootless, and naturally clear. The transformation technique involves appearing and empty transformation through mirror meditation on deity bodies. The cutting technique involves releasing all appearance-mind connections without fabrication.

The developmental progression described—from coarse dreams to subtle, then to forgetting, finally to nothing dreamed with awareness resting in clear samādhi day and night—establishes the complete path. The technical term "day-night union" (nyin mtshan kha sbyor) indicates the final integration of waking and dream states.

This subsection details the main practice through three aspects: dharmatā-meaning crucial point, means and focus crucial point, and channel-wind binding crucial point. The structural function presents these as integrated dimensions of the practice, with the threefold training—training, transforming, cutting—serving as the foundation. The instruction that while some say doing one or two is sufficient for those with lesser capacity, here all three are trained establishes the comprehensive approach.

The register maintains technical terminology: dharmatā-meaning (chos nyid don), means (thabs), focus (dmigs pa), channel-wind binding (rtsa rlung chings). The training technique emphasizes strong intention and looking back at awareness to see groundless appearances, establishing the reflexive recognition essential to the practice.

Preservation requires maintaining the hierarchical relationship between preliminary and main practices without diminishing either. The description of training transforming cutting as "extremely difficult" for some while "easy" for others acknowledges different capacities while affirming the completeness of the full practice.

This passage presents the specific techniques for dream transformation, establishing the methods for working with appearance and emptiness in the dream state. The structural function moves from appearance transformation to empty transformation, presenting two complementary approaches. The appearance transformation involves deity body meditation using mirrors, transforming all appearances into divine maṇḍalas, pure realms, or the eight similes of illusion.

The register operates in transformation terminology: appearance transformation (snang ba sgyur ba), empty transformation (stong par sgyur ba), mirror (me long), deity body (lha'i sku), divine maṇḍala (lha'i dkyil 'khor), pure realm (sangs rgyas kyi zhing), eight similes of illusion (sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad). The eight similes refer to the standard Buddhist list: illusion, dream, mirage, echo, reflection, city of gandharvas, rainbow, and water-moon.

Translation risks center on preserving the specific visualizations while maintaining their technical function. The empty transformation—like clouds or mist clearing in space—establishes the dissolution aspect complementary to the appearance aspect. Both must be practiced with strong intention to accomplish transformation in dreams.

This subsection concludes the dream training with the cutting technique and introduces the means and focus crucial points: churning, squeezing, and throwing to the crucial point. The structural function presents cutting as the non-dual resolution of the previous techniques, then transitions to the wind and mind practices that support dream yoga.

The register maintains cutting terminology: not establishing apprehension in space (bar snang thog tu rig pa 'dzin pa mi 'dogs), not apprehending appearance's reflection (snang ba'i gzugs brnyan mi 'dzin), appearance-mind connection (snang sems gnyis la 'brel ba), self-clear awareness (rang gsal gyi rig pa). The technique of releasing into spacious clarity without fabrication establishes the non-dual completion of the practice.

Preservation requires maintaining the progression from dualistic training through non-dual cutting without imposing external philosophical frameworks. The introduction of churning, squeezing, and throwing indicates the next level of practice involving subtle body work, establishing the transition to the channel-wind binding techniques that support advanced dream yoga.
