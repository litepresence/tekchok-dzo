Structural function: Threefold emanation body classification opening with surprising examples—hunters and butchers as Buddha-manifestations. The text immediately establishes non-conventional emanation view: not just glorious forms but socially transgressive ones. Register: tantric iconoclasm, mahasiddha perspective. Translation risk: Domesticating "rngon pa dang smad 'tshong" loses the shock value essential to the teaching. Preservation: The jarring juxtaposition of low-status professions with Buddha-activity must remain audible.

Second and third emanation types expanding the typology. Six Shakya forms for different disciples, five pure Buddha pure lands with specific names—Akanishta, Sudarshana, Glorious-Endowed, Lotus-Stack, Karma-Perfect. This is systematic classification, not random listing. The recognition required is that each emanation type corresponds to different capacity levels and karmic connections. Register shifts from provocative examples to systematic cosmology. Risk: The five pure land names become meaningless labels without recognizing their specific iconographic and energetic associations. Preservation: Each name carries precise connotations that must not be flattened.

Extended presentation of emanation body characteristics across three-kāya levels. The structure is consistent: field, retinue, teaching, duration—fourfold analysis applied to emanation, sambhogakaya, and nirmanakaya dimensions. Thirty-six deeds for Shakya forms, inconceivable aeons for supreme emanations. The recognition required is that these are not different Buddhas but different modalities of one awakening activity. Register: Abhidharma-style systematic enumeration applied to tantric cosmology. Risk: The enumeration appears scholastic abstraction unless recognized as precision in describing what transcends ordinary cognition. Preservation: The fourfold structure must remain visible even amid extensive detail.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents the threefold emanation body typology—manifesting in transgressive forms, manifesting as six Shakya forms, manifesting as five pure Buddha fields. The recognition required is that all three are skillful means (thabs) operating at different levels of disciple capacity. The hunters and butchers manifestation is not less "real" than the Akanishta manifestation—both are equally Buddha-activity appearing appropriately to conditions. This is the Dzogchen view of emanation: not lesser than sambhogakaya or dharmakaya, but the natural display of responsive compassion. The translator must preserve both the iconoclastic edge of the opening examples and the systematic precision of the subsequent enumeration.
