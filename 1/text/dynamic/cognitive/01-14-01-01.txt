[17361-17523]
Section opens with mind as ground (sems kyi gnas) and dharmakāya as ground of wisdom (shes kyi gnas)—foundational Dzogchen distinction. The Kun bzang po longs spyur rdzogs chen text presents a dialogue format examining kun gzhi (all-ground) and chos sku (dharmakāya). Two positions emerge: those asserting kun gzhi as dharmakāya versus those distinguishing them. Key analogy: ocean (rgya mtsho) and boat (gru)—dharmakāya as pure ocean, kun gzhi as surface where boats (appearances) move without disturbing the depths. Another simile: dream and waking—illusionary display arising from the same ground. Structural note: this section establishes the ground for subsequent āyatanas and vajra-knowledge discussions. Register maintains highest philosophical precision. Translation risk: kun gzhi rendered as "storehouse consciousness" loses Dzogchen technical sense—prefer "all-ground" with context.
