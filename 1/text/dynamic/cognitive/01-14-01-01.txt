Section opens establishing foundational Dzogchen distinction: mind as ground and dharmakaya as ground of wisdom. Kun gzhi as all-ground accommodates all objects of thought known as mind. Dharmakaya transcends all memory and conception lacking discriminating awareness grasping objects as separate. Kunzang Po text presents this through dialogue examining whether these two are identical or distinct. View register: Dzogchen ground distinction between neutral basis and primordially pure enlightened aspect. Translation risk: kun gzhi rendered as storehouse consciousness losing Dzogchen meaning. Preservation: prefer all-ground with context clarifying distinction from Yogacara.

Two positions emerge regarding relationship. Some assert kun gzhi is dharmakaya finding support in common treatises where kun gzhi serves as support for pure and impure phenomena while dharmakaya is stainless suchness within purity. Certain mantra traditions hold when kun gzhi transforms its abode becomes wisdom of dharmadhatu and svabhavikakaya citing texts stating kun gzhi is ground of all including nirvana. Objections arise: if kun gzhi were dharmakaya then dharmakaya would become defiled, all-ground's production of confusion would mean dharmakaya produces confusion, if enlightenment achieved from this ground buddhas could revert to sentient beings. Kunzang Po Thugs kyi Me long states those considering kun gzhi as dharmakaya deviated from teaching. Rig pa Rang shar provides responses demonstrating kun gzhi's characteristic is holding conceptual discrimination obscured by consciousness of various confusions, thing itself of fundamental ignorance for all.

Distinction between kun gzhi and dharmakaya must be precisely divided as Klong drug pa states: if not distinguished like awareness grasping one form as separate, true meaning cannot appear individually distinct. Analogies illustrate relationship: like ocean and boats, dharmakaya is primordially pure awareness stainless never experienced as defiled like clear ocean expanse not established anywhere yet appearing everywhere unobstructed, ground of final liberation aspect of purity possessing primordial realm and natural purity separated from adventitious conditions. Kun gzhi like boats not entering ocean depths, all-ground serving as support for fundamental ignorance when confusion arises from primordial expanse, pervading and abiding as entity like boats filled with confused persons of mind mental factors karma and habitual tendencies. Rang shar states analogy for kun gzhi and dharmakaya like ocean and boats on path, like sleep and waking because of difference in faculties. Stainless awareness of dharmakaya not to be rejected at any time exists as ground of final liberation while kun gzhi like sleep support for appearing dreams of confusion to be awakened from, difference extremely significant.

Extensive explanation divides into two parts: extensive explanation of kun gzhi and extensive explanation of dharmakaya. Regarding kun gzhi Thalgyur states: kun gzhi and essential point of dharmakaya, first explaining kun gzhi as ground of all dharma and non-dharma, its entity etymology divisions and reasons for term's application. Entity is vessel containing virtuous and non-virtuous compounded phenomena with habitual tendencies of samsaric phenomena. Etymology: kun means all or many, gzhi means ground where many assemble, temporal location, or abiding support. Divisions are four: kun gzhi of ultimate meaning as primordial ground of expanse of samsaric phenomena spoken from perspective of reversing ignorance co-emergent with awareness as first moving deliberating agent; kun gzhi of application meaning spoken from aspect that when awareness does not recognize itself applies to samsara when recognized applies to nirvana; kun gzhi of body habitual tendencies from aspect that in root awareness body habitual tendencies exist causing flesh blood light and mental body to appear; kun gzhi of various habitual tendencies spoken from aspect of serving as ground for impure karma and habitual tendencies. Though given four names they are imputed upon four aspects turned toward one knowing entity. From first moving aspect to present support for all awareness is kun gzhi, eight collections depending upon it dwelling separately as parts, if divided root is ground opening and appearing as samsara. Ultimate meaning opens samsara and nirvana through application, application meaning connects body and mind through bliss and suffering, body serves as condition for body and collections, habitual tendencies are amassing of karma and afflictions causes and conditions. Reason for term's application: connects previous and subsequent habitual tendencies, connects five external ripenings of karma, connects cause and result, performs binding of all-pervading connection. Regarding dharmakaya Thalgyur states: dharmakaya is free from elaboration without marks of self-grasping, entity is empty and radiant without distinction, divisions are dharma sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya, etymology chos means true path sku means what is accomplished from that.
