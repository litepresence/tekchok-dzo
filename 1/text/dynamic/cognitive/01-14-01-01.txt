[17361-17523]
Section opens with mind as ground and dharmakāya as ground of wisdom—foundational Dzogchen distinction. Kun bzang po longs spyur rdzogs chen text presents dialogue examining kun gzhi and chos sku. Two positions: those asserting kun gzhi as dharmakāya versus those distinguishing them. Key analogy: ocean and boat—dharmakāya as pure ocean, kun gzhi as surface where boats move without disturbing depths. Dream and waking simile—illusionary display arising from same ground. Structural function: establish ground for subsequent āyatanas and vajra-knowledge discussions. Risk: kun gzhi rendered as "storehouse consciousness" loses Dzogchen technical sense—prefer "all-ground" with context.
