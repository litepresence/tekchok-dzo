[19657-19974]
Vajra-knowledge (rdo rje ye shests) characteristics section. General characteristic: wisdom showing self-manifestation, illuminating luminosity without relying on external causes—distinguishing samsara and nirvana. Specific characteristics: four aspects. First: distant (rgya mtshams) —uncompounded appearance arising from four causes, manifesting as two truth appearances. Second: naturally arisen (shes rab rang byung)—inner luminosity arising from understanding dharmata, cutting karmic and afflictive bonds. Third: great (che ba)—when basis-appearance arises, wisdom and body mature into sambhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya spontaneously. Fourth: bindu-circle (thig le tshig)—appearances within mind as luminous circle. Structural note: connects to subsequent sections on vajra-knowledge as fruit. Register: highest vajra-knowledge terminology. Key term: rdo rje ye shests—vajra-knowledge, the fourth of five wisdoms, representing perfect clarity.
