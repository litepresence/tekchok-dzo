[19441-19656]
Thögal visionary bindu-circle appearances section. First: bindu appearing externally (thig le phyi rol) like rainbow in space—wisdom's own nature appearing as luminosity. Comparisons: kitchen hearth, rainbow. Second: matured wisdom bindu (ye shests smin pa'i thig le)—bindu on path appearing like sun's circle with five colors. Three, five, or multiple points (rtse ba) and tips (mtshan) arise: three points (triśūnya), five points (pañca), many points—visualizations of wisdom maturation. Third: ripened awareness bindu (rig pa smin pa'i thig le)—awareness maturing into great purity appearance, seeing dharmakāya spontaneously present. Structural note: these are intermediate thögal stages between initial light appearances and final fruition. Register: highest visionary physiology terminology. Translation note: thögal (mehod) visualizations are experiential, not conceptual—render with precise technical terms.
