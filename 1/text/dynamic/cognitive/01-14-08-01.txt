Thögal visionary bindu-circle appearances section—detailing the progressive stages of visionary experience in Thögal practice. First stage: bindu appearing externally (phyi snang gi thig le) like rainbow in space (nam mkha' la 'ja' ris lta bu)—wisdom's own nature appearing as luminosity. Comparisons provided: kitchen hearth (thab ka), rainbow ('ja' ris). These similes indicate the nature of the appearance—luminous, without substantial existence, appearing yet empty. View register: appearances as wisdom's display, not external objects.

[Extended Analysis: External Bindu Appearances]
The external bindu appearances represent the initial stage of Thögal vision—luminous spheres or circles appearing in the visual field, not created by external light but by mind's own luminosity. View register: thig le as bindu-nature of mind manifesting. Translation risk: "bindu" appearing as physical dot or drop. Preservation: thig le is spherical completeness—the essence in manifest form, like a pearl or drop, but luminous and spacious. The kitchen hearth simile indicates light that is natural, domestic, unpretentious—not special or otherworldly, just present.

[Extended Analysis: Rainbow Simile Significance]
The rainbow simile ('ja' ris) is crucial—indicating appearance without substantial existence, vivid yet untouchable, naturally occurring yet empty. View register: rainbow as model for all appearance. Translation risk: rainbow appearing merely as metaphor. Preservation: the rainbow represents exactly how thig le appears—brilliant colors, distinct form, yet utterly insubstantial. If you try to grasp a rainbow, nothing is there; likewise with thig le appearances.

[Extended Analysis: Second Stage - Matured Wisdom Bindu]
Second stage: matured wisdom bindu (ye shes thig le yongs su smin pa)—bindu on the path appearing like sun's circle with five colors (nyi ma'i dkyil 'dra 'od lnga). This indicates maturation of the visionary experience—more stable, more vivid, with the five colors of the five wisdoms. View register: maturation as natural development, not forced growth. Translation risk: "matured" suggesting achievement. Preservation: smin pa means ripened naturally—like fruit ripening on a tree, not forced. The wisdom bindu matures as obscurations dissolve.

[Extended Analysis: Three, Five, or Multiple Points and Tips]
Three, five, or multiple points and tips arise: three points (rtse gsum, triśūnya), five points (rtse lnga, pañca), many points—visualizations of wisdom maturation. These configurations represent different stages or aspects of visionary development. Three points may represent essence, nature, and compassion; five points the five wisdoms; many points the manifold display of phenomena. View register: numerical configurations as meaningful patterns, not arbitrary. Translation risk: numbers appearing as magical. Preservation: the numbers indicate specific energetic and wisdom configurations—triangular, pentagonal, or manifold arrays.

[Extended Analysis: Third Stage - Ripened Awareness Bindu]
Third stage: ripened awareness bindu (rig pa yongs su smin pa'i thig le)—awareness maturing into great purity appearance (dag pa chen po'i snang ba), seeing dharmakāya spontaneously present (chos sku lhun gyis grub par mthong). This is advanced Thögal where the bindu appearances reveal the dharmakāya nature directly. View register: ripening as revelation of what was always present. Translation risk: "ripened" suggesting completion of process. Preservation: yongs su smin pa means fully ripened—the point where appearance and essence are recognized as inseparable. The dharmakāya was always spontaneously present; now it is seen.

[Extended Analysis: Intermediate Thögal Stages]
These are intermediate thögal stages between initial light appearances and final fruition. The progression moves from external appearances through maturation to ripening—not linear stages but deepening recognition. View register: stages as recognition deepening, not achievement accumulating. Translation risk: stages appearing as separate goals. Preservation: these are not rungs on a ladder but waves of the same ocean—each reveals more deeply what was always present.

[Extended Analysis: Highest Visionary Physiology Terminology]
The terminology throughout represents the highest visionary physiology—thig le (bindu), 'od (light), snang ba (appearance), smin pa (maturation), yongs su dag pa (complete purity). View register: technical precision as support for recognition. Translation risk: terminology appearing as jargon. Preservation: each term is precise—thig le is not just "dot" but spherical essence; smin pa is not just "ripe" but naturally matured. The translator must maintain technical accuracy.

[Extended Analysis: Translation Note on Experiential Nature]
The translation note indicates these are experiential, not conceptual—render with precise technical terms. View register: experience preceding and transcending language. Translation risk: conceptualizing visionary experiences. Preservation: the descriptions point to experiences that cannot be captured in words. Terms like thig le, 'od, snang ba are fingers pointing at the moon of direct experience.

[Extended Analysis: Visualizations as Wisdom Maturation]
The visualizations (dmigs pa) are of wisdom maturation—not constructed images but natural appearances of ripening wisdom. View register: visualization as recognition, not creation. Translation risk: "visualization" suggesting imagination. Preservation: dmigs pa here is recognition of what appears naturally, not deliberate visualization. The practitioner recognizes the bindu appearances as wisdom maturing.

[Extended Analysis: Structural Note on Progressive Stages]
The structural note identifies these as intermediate stages—between initial appearances and final fruition. This locates the section within the overall Thögal progression. View register: path as continuous, stages as conveniences. Translation risk: stages appearing as rigid categories. Preservation: the stages describe experience, not prescribe route. Some practitioners may experience all three; others move directly to ripening.

[Extended Analysis: Five Colors as Five Wisdoms]
The five colors in the matured bindu represent the five wisdoms: blue (dharmadhātu), white (mirror-like), yellow (equality), red (discriminating), green (all-accomplishing). View register: colors as wisdom display, not decoration. Translation risk: color symbolism appearing arbitrary. Preservation: each color corresponds to specific wisdom and element—the bindu displays the complete mandala of wisdom in chromatic form.

[Extended Analysis: Spontaneously Present Dharmakāya]
Seeing dharmakāya spontaneously present (chos sku lhun gyis grub par mthong) indicates direct recognition of the truth body—not as distant goal but as immediate nature of appearances. View register: dharmakāya as ever-present, not achieved. Translation risk: "seeing" suggesting visual perception only. Preservation: mthong here is realization—recognizing the empty, luminous nature of all appearance as dharmakāya.

[Extended Analysis: Great Purity Appearance]
Great purity appearance (dag pa chen po'i snang ba) indicates the vision of kadag—primordial purity appearing as all phenomena. Nothing is impure; all is the stainless display of wisdom. View register: purity as intrinsic, not achieved. Translation risk: "purity" suggesting moral judgment. Preservation: dag pa means primordially pure—not cleaned or purified, but never stained. The appearance itself is purity.

[Structural Synthesis: Complete Bindu-Circle Framework]
This section (19441-19656) presents the complete framework of bindu-circle appearances in Thögal practice. The architecture moves from external appearances through maturation to ripening, establishing three stages of visionary development. The view throughout is that these appearances are wisdom's natural display—maturing, ripening, revealing dharmakāya spontaneously present. Dzogchen terms require careful preservation terminology—thig le, smin pa, yongs su dag pa—while conveying that these are direct experiential descriptions, not philosophical speculations. The kitchen hearth and rainbow similes ground the sublime in the ordinary—these are natural phenomena, not supernatural intrusions. The five colors, three points, and manifold configurations encode the complete wisdom mandala in visionary form.
