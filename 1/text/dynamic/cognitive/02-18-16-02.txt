[5923-5924]
Eighth ground and ninth perfection transition. Structural function: marks major bodhisattva stage progression within ten-ground system. View register: doxographical enumeration with specific attainment markers. Translation: preserve brgyad pa (eighth), mi g.yo ba (immovable), yon tan rdzogs pa (qualities perfection). Note: eighth ground represents irreversibility—bodhisattva cannot fall back. Translation risk: treating "immovable" as static misses the dynamic stability involved. Preservation: the de nas (thereafter) transition signals sequential advancement through grounds. The eighth-ninth transition is doctrinally significant as move from shared to uncommon path realization.
