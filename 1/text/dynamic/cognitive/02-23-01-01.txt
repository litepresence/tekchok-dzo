Four intermediate states (bar do) in Dzogchen. In primordial purity, no intermediate state exists—that very self depends not on other dharmas, before or after, cannot enter any interval. Etymology: "bar" (center) is central dharma of upper, lower, before, after—like dream intermediate state between sleep and waking. "Ma" indicates center, "do" (two) dwells in center like connecting rope joining beginning and end. Divisions: common vehicles assert birth-death, dream, dharmatā, existence intermediate states. This uncommon Secret King system has four: nature-remaining intermediate state, death-time intermediate state, dharmatā intermediate state, existence intermediate state. Structural note: Dzogchen bardo system distinct from common Buddhist bardo teachings.
