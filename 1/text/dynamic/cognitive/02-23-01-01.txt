Even now it remains in the external-internal nature of how it manifests. Finally, it must be carried in that nature. In primordial purity's expanse, no intermediate state exists—that very self not depending on other dharmas before or after, cannot enter any interval. Because transcending transfer-change and apparent-empty extremes. Citation from Thalgyur: "In primordial purity from the beginning, even delusion-basis cannot be spoken. Likewise, non-delusion also what?" This crucial point, if wisdom exists, is great meaning condensed. Second, etymology: "bar" is central dharma of upper, lower, before, after—like dream intermediate state between sleep and waking. "Ma" indicates center, "do" dwells in center like connecting rope joining beginning and end. Third, divisions: common and uncommon. Common vehicles assert birth-death, dream, dharmatā, existence intermediate states. This uncommon Secret King system has four: nature-remaining, death-time, dharmatā, existence intermediate states. Citation from Thalgyur: "Bardo's dharmatā such, explained as extremely secret dharmatā. Dividing into four aspects."

[Extended Analysis: Bardo in Primordial Purity]
Lines 12011-12020 establish the fundamental Dzogchen view: in primordial purity (ka dag), no bardo exists. The structural function: establishing that bardo is not ultimate reality but appearance of non-recognition. View register: This presents bardo as description of delusion, not inherent state. Translation risk: "no bardo" may misleadingly suggest bardo is unreal or unimportant. Preservation: Translate to convey that in ka dag—pure from the beginning—there is no interval because there is no transition; what appears as bardo is non-recognition of what is already the case.

[Extended Analysis: Dependence on Other Dharmas]
The phrase "not depending on other dharmas before or after" (chos gzhan snga phyi la mi ltos shing) establishes bardo's conventional nature. View register: This presents bardo as dependent designation, not self-existing. Translation risk: "independence" may misleadingly suggest positive quality. Preservation: Translate to convey that absence of dependence indicates bardo's lack of inherent existence—it exists only relative to transition between states.

[Extended Analysis: Thalgyur Citation on Indescribability]
The Thalgyur citation at lines 12017-12020 emphasizes indescribability: "In primordial purity from the beginning, even delusion-basis cannot be spoken. Likewise, non-delusion also what?" View register: This presents the as ground transcends both delusion and non-delusion. Translation risk: "citation" may misleadingly suggest paradox for effect. Preservation: Translate to convey that in ka dag, there is not even a basis for delusion ( 'khrul gzhi)—the ground is beyond the delusion-realization duality.

[Extended Analysis: Etymological Precision]
Lines 12022-12025 provide etymology of "bardo" (bar do). "Bar" means interval or center—between upper and lower, before and after, like dream between sleep and waking. "Ma" indicates center. "Do" means two—dwelling in center like connecting rope (sbrel thag) joining beginning and end. View register: This presents bardo as interval, gap, in-between state. Translation risk: "intermediate state" may misleadingly suggest the sense of interval. Preservation: Translate to convey that Tibetan emphasizes the "interval" quality—neither this nor that, yet connecting both.

[Extended Analysis: Four Bardos of Dzogchen]
The four bardos specific to Dzogchen (lines 12033-12037): rang bzhin bar do (nature-remaining), 'chi kha'i bar do (death-time), chos nyid kyi bar do (dharmatā), srid pa'i bar do (existence/becoming). View register: Dzogchen framework distinct from common Buddhist bardo. Translation risk: conflating with six bardos of other systems. Preservation: Translate to convey that these four correspond to the four stages of mind's manifestation—from natural abiding through death to rebirth.

Fourth, appearance modes has two parts. First, general presentation: three realms' common appearances are grasping-grasper, attachment-aversion, afflictions manifest; subtle form and formless. Six migrations' individual appearances: from single cause water, gods have nectar and so forth. Citation from Denyig: "Although mind is one, different, therefore seen as not established as object." Individual door: to one person Lhaskyin appear as many enemies and friends, happiness-suffering, delusion-non-delusion, attachment-aversion, good-bad, dharma and non-dharma, etc. manifest diversely. Later good-bad karmic causes operate variously. In brief, whoever appears to, like last night's dream good-bad variously appears, yet not established though appearing, operating in clear appearance of non-existence.

[Extended Analysis: General Appearance Presentation]
Lines 12044-12061 present the general mode of appearance (snang tshul) in samsara. The structural function: establishing that all appearances are mind's display. View register: This presents appearances as dreamlike, not externally established. Translation risk: "appearances" may misleadingly suggest objective phenomena. Preservation: snang ba indicates manifestation, display—not solid objects but mind's own showing.

[Extended Analysis: Common vs. Individual Appearances]
The distinction between "common appearances" (spyi snang) of the three realms and "individual appearances" (so so snang) of the six migrations establishes the layers of perception. View register: shared and private dimensions of experience. Translation risk: "common" may misleadingly suggest objective shared world. Preservation: Translate to convey that "common" appearances are commonly experienced projections, not external realities.

[Extended Analysis: Causality and Perception]
The citation from Denyig (bden gnyis) at lines 12050-12052—"Although mind is one, different, therefore seen as not established as object"—establishes the Yogacara view applied in Dzogchen. View register: perception as mind-only, objects as projection. Translation risk: solipsism or idealism. Preservation: "not established as object" (don ma grub pa) indicates lack of external existence, not denial of appearance.

Particular explanation has four. Nature-remaining bardo's appearances: bound by form aggregates, five bodies' appearance self-cessation; bound by elements and sense-bases, light and color appearance self-cessation; bound by karma and afflictions, wisdom and dharmatā appearance self-cessation. External appearance objects, internal grasper mind attached, difficult to cross the four perverted streams' depths, day and night wandering continuously, operating various karmic latencies. Four perversions: not knowing samsara's delusion-appearance dream-illusion-like nature, grasping impermanent as permanent, untrue as true, suffering cause-effect as happiness, naturally empty as entity and marks.

[Extended Analysis: Nature-Remaining Bardo]
Lines 12063-12069 present the nature-remaining bardo (rang bzhin gnas pa'i bar do)—ordinary life as bardo. The structural function: establishing that we are already in bardo. View register: life itself as intermediate state between death and rebirth. Translation risk: "nature-remaining" may misleadingly suggest obscure. Preservation: rang bzhin gnas pa means "naturally abiding"—the natural state that appears as bardo when not recognized.

[Extended Analysis: Three Types of Binding and Self-Cessation]
The three types of binding (bcings pa)—aggregates, elements/sense-bases, karma/afflictions—correspond to three dimensions of obscuration. View register: obscurations as opportunities for recognition when their self-liberating nature is seen. Translation risk: "binding" may misleadingly suggest permanent entrapment. Preservation: "self-cessation" (rang 'gags) indicates that when recognized, bindings naturally release.

[Extended Analysis: Four Perversions (Phyin Ci Log)
The four perversions at lines 12070-12074 are standard Buddhist doctrine: grasping impermanent as permanent, unsatisfactory as satisfying, impure as pure, selfless as self. View register: This presents the asse as fundamental errors creating samsara. Translation risk: "moralistic framing of ignorance. Preservation: Translate to convey that perversions are cognitive errors, not moral failings—correct understanding liberates.

Death-time bardo's appearances: body elements disturbed, experiencing external body's suffering; mind-born feeling path lost, experiencing internal mind's suffering; latency-grasping lake overflowed, experiencing separation from this life's appearances though attached; non-virtue-virtue karma remembered, experiencing fear of falling into lower realms; cherishing-grasping cared-for body remembered, experiencing fear of aggregates' fortress falling. Actually, if matter and awareness separated, dwelling in fear of death. Dharmatā bardo's appearances: aggregates' self-grasping support abandoned, bodies and wisdoms' dharmatā manifest; karma and latencies' connection cut, enjoying natural samadhi's dharmatā; sense-power grasper's objects emptied, operating in self-appearing luminosity's dharmatā. Existence bardo's appearances: external body's existence, mind-body with complete sense-power moving unimpededly; internal mind's existence, thinking many conceptions and mind entering; body-mind combined existence, moving unimpededly to all except two supports, fear and terror.

[Extended Analysis: Death-Time Bardo]
Lines 12076-12082 present the death-time bardo ('chi kha'i bar do)—the process of dying. The structural function: describing what appears as the elements dissolve. View register: This presents death as opportunity for recognition. Translation risk: death appearing as morbid fixation. Preservation: Translate to convey that Dzogchen, death is a crucial opportunity—if recognition happens at death, liberation is achieved.

[Extended Analysis: Five Sufferings of Death]
The five sufferings of death time: external body suffering, internal mind suffering, separation from appearances, fear of lower realms, fear of" may misleadingly suggest the body—establish the intensity of the death experience. View register: This presents the asse sufferings as signs to recognize, not obstacles. Translation risk: dwelling on suffering as pessimistic. Preservation: awareness of death's intensity motivates practice and prepares recognition.

[Extended Analysis: Dharmatā Bardo as Opportunity]
The dharmatā bardo (chos nyid kyi bar do) at lines 12083-12087 presents the clear light experience after death. View register: dharmatā as natural purity manifesting when obscurations dissolve. Translation risk: "dharmatā" may misleadingly suggest technical abstraction. Preservation: chos nyid means "nature of phenomena"—the way things actually are, which becomes visible when conceptual mind dissolves.

[Extended Analysis: Threefold Dharmatā Enjoyment]
Lines 12085-12087 describe three aspects of dharmatā bardo: bodies and wisdoms' dharmatā manifesting, enjoying natural samadhi, operating in self-appearing luminosity. View register: This presents death as most profound opportunity for recognition. Translation risk: "these" may misleadingly suggest inaccessible to ordinary understanding. Preservation: Translate to convey that description is precise—what happens when the coarse mind dissolves and subtle mind manifests.

[Extended Analysis: Existence Bardo as Rebirth Opportunity]
The existence/becoming bardo (srid pa'i bar do) at lines 12088-12091 describes the intermediate state proper—the "dream body" that can travel without physical limitation. View register: This presents bardo as body as last opportunity for recognition before rebirth. Translation risk: "bardo body" may misleadingly suggest supernatural. Preservation: Translate to convey that description is phenomenological—what is actually experienced when consciousness is separated from physical body.

[Extended Analysis: Two Supports for Rebirth]
Lines 12093-12095 identify the "two supports" (rten gnis) for rebirth: vajra-seat (blessing-established) and mother's womb. View register: This presents the asse as the two ways consciousness can reincarnate. Translation risk: literalizing the vajra-seat or mother's womb as only physical. Preservation: Translate to convey that Dzogchen, the vajra-seat (rdo rje'i gdan) is also the pure land of natural purity—not only physical Bodhgaya.

[Extended Analysis: Six Limits of Interpretation]
Lines 12100-12103 mention the "six limits" (mtha' drug) for binding tantra meanings: literal and non-literal, etc. This indicates that bardo descriptions require careful hermeneutics. View register: multiple levels of meaning in bardo teachings. Translation risk: literalizing or over-spiritualizing. Preservation: Translate to convey that six limits prevent both literal materialism and disembodied spiritualism—bardo is actual experience, not mere metaphor.

[Structural Synthesis: Complete Bardo Framework]
This section (12011-12244) presents the four-bardo system distinctive to Dzogchen. The architecture moves from the fundamental view that bardo is ultimately non-existent in primordial purity, through etymology and classification, to detailed description of each bardo's appearances. The view throughout is that bardo is not merely after death but describes the entire condition of non-recognition. The four bardos—nature-remaining, death-time, dharmatā, existence—represent the complete cycle from life through death to rebirth. The translator must preserve both the technical precision of the descriptions and the ultimate view that bardo is appearance of non-recognition, not inherent reality. The descriptions are phenomenologically precise—what is actually experienced—and serve as maps for recognition, not merely philosophical speculation.
