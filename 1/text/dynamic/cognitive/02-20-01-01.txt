[8083-8830]
Distinction between Trekchö and Thögal in Dzogchen path. Section addresses differences between cutting through (khregs chod) and direct crossing (thod rgal). First: Trekchö liberates from samsara but leaves atomic particles—cannot transform into light body. Without light body, vajra body not established, temporary illusory body cannot complete path, great transference body not attained, benefit for others impossible. Thögal accomplishes what Trekchö cannot. Second: although rigpa is luminous from beginning, Trekchö's emptiness estimation doesn't see its own light; Thögal captures essence-luminosity internally, manifesting individual's own-resonance luminosity externally. Third: Trekchö doesn't see rigpa's pristine wisdom, covered by expansion; Thögal opens wisdom vision, seeing dharmatā's sun-rays clearly. Structural note: critical distinction between two Dzogchen methods—emptiness realization vs. visionary manifestation. Register: highest Dzogchen technical terminology (khregs chod, thod rgal, rigpa, gdod ma, lhun grub).
