Light-ray continuum appearances. Sequential enumeration of visionary phenomena: subtle, moving, wriggling, flickering, blazing. Progressive intensification from refined to vigorous manifestation. Technical terminology: 'gyu ba (movement), 'phrig pa (wriggling/contraction), ltem pa (flickering/pulsation), mer bar (blazing). These describe natural stages of thod rgal vision development, not objective phenomena. Preserve phenomenological precision without reifying as external objects.

[19427-19429]
Bindu-circle manifestations. Gsum pa marks third topic transition. Thig le'i mu khyud—circle of bindu—as container for visionary display. Gye 'greng (upright standing) and rtsibs shar (spokes appearing eastward) describe geometric patterns of light. Structural function: establish spatial orientation within visionary experience. The eastward reference signals directional clarity in primordial display.

[19430-19435]
Threefold ripened bindu classification. Synthesis of thig le typology: 'od rnams smin pa (ripened lights), ye shes smin pa (ripened pristine cognition), rig pa smin pa (ripened awareness). Citation from Nyi zla kha sbyor establishes scriptural authority. Each bindu represents progressive integration of appearance and recognition. Smin pa—ripening—denotes maturation through practice, not automatic development.

[19436-19440]
Bindu characteristics and outcome. Standing upright posture signals stability. Rainbow analogy (unmixed clarity) describes non-physical luminosity. Goms pa—accustoming/familiarization—as causal condition for appearance-seeing confirms this is cultivated recognition, not spontaneous occurrence. Technical precision: appearances themselves become visible through practice, not merely bindus. Preserve this subtle distinction.
