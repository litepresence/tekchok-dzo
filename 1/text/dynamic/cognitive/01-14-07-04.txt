Structural function: Light-ray continuum (gsal 'od rgyun) appearances presentation within Thogal visionary phenomenology. Sequential visionary phenomena described: subtle, moving, wriggling, flickering, blazing—representing progressive thod rgal intensification. Third major topic: bindu-circle (thig le) manifestations as geometric light patterns. View register: Dzogchen Thogal subtle body visionary experience. Translation risk: Literalizing the geometric descriptions misses their function as phenomenological markers of progressive recognition. Preservation: The sequential nature of the intensification must remain clear.

Extended recognition of the threefold ripened bindu classification presented with scriptural citation from Nyi zla kha sbyor (Sun-Moon Union). The bindu manifestations are not automatic but ripen through practice—establishing that Thogal visions are not hallucinations to be passively observed but signs of recognition to be actively integrated. The progression from subtle to blazing establishes the increasing intensity of clarity as obscurations dissolve.

Overall structural recognition: This brief section presents key Thogal phenomenology—the light-ray continuum and bindu manifestations that characterize advanced Dzogchen practice. The recognition required is that these are not external phenomena but the natural display of rigpa's luminosity. The translator must preserve the technical precision of the sequential descriptions while maintaining the understanding that these are internal visionary experiences, not objective external events.
