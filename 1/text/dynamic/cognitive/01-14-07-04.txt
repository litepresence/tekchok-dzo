Light-ray continuum (gsal 'od rgyun) in Thogal: subtle, moving, wriggling, flickering, blazing—progressive intensification. Third topic: bindu-circle (thig le) manifestations as geometric light patterns. View register: Thogal visionary experience, not external phenomena but rigpa's luminosity display. Ripened through practice, not automatic. Citation from Nyi zla kha sbyor (Sun-Moon Union).

The light-ray continuum represents progressive stages of Thogal recognition. Each stage—subtle, moving, wriggling, flickering, blazing—marks increasing clarity. The bindu-circle manifestations appear as natural geometric patterns, not constructed visualizations. These are signs of ripening awareness, requiring practice to develop. Translator must preserve technical terminology while conveying natural development.
