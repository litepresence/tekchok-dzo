[10722-10723]
Refutation of singular and multiple basis assertions. First: if basis singular like variety of appearances, fault of singular arising outwardly as variety. If ground truly one, how manifest as ten thousandfold display? Singular cannot become manifold. Second: if basis multiple like variety, fault of manifold failing to account for singular experience. If ground truly many, how unified consciousness? Manifold cannot become singular.
