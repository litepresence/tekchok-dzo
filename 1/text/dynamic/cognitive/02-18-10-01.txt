The text presents liberation from samsara's bondage through transformation of five poisons into five wisdoms. As mastery is obtained over desire, hatred, ignorance, pride, and jealousy, the five wisdom colors manifest. These poisons no longer bind but appear as residual imprints, indicating transcendence of samsara. The structural function maps the five-poison and five-wisdom schema onto visionary experience.

[5138-5155]
The progression continues through appearance stages resembling nets, broken nets, intricate patterns, and tent canopies. These appearances indicate transcending the five aggregates and worldly self-view. Each stage represents refinement, with coarser misconceptions dissolving into subtler manifestations. This represents purification of view in dharmata.

[5156-5168]
Subsequent appearances manifest as wisdom castles, sun and moon union, stacked lotuses, piled stupas, and thousand-petalled lotuses. These indicate transcendence of five elements' binding characteristics. All appearances arise and cease as a single event, termed "experience," with progressive development representing "increase" of recognition.

[5169-5176]
The vajra family purification establishes correlation between buddha families, wisdoms, and colors. Mirror-like wisdom appears as white, dharmadhatu wisdom as blue, equality wisdom as yellow. This systematic presentation maps the five-wisdom schema onto visionary experience.

[5177-5185]
Discriminating wisdom appears as red, all-accomplishing wisdom as green. The blue vajra fence indicates wisdoms' non-difference in essence. The arising sequence establishes practice timeframes: five days, seven days, or twenty-one days.

[5186-5201]
The Rangjung Gyud citation establishes recognition: "Fortunate one with good karma, how could you enter samsara? Wheel-cut appearing accomplishes emanation qualities." This connects personal experience to universal structure.

[5202-5220]
The path summary includes recognition of own nature, impossibility of returning to samsara, and emanation qualities' accomplishment. The emphasis remains on direct recognition rather than fixation on appearances.

[5221-5241]
The practitioner recognizing these as self-appearance progresses toward liberation, while fixation on appearances remains binding. These are supports for recognizing mind's nature, not objects for attachment.
