[5125-5158]
Liberation from samsara. First: liberation from five poisons—desire, hatred, ignorance, pride, jealousy—when freed, appearances naturally arise as wisdom. Five poisons transform into five wisdoms: desire becomes mirror-like wisdom, hatred becomes discriminating wisdom, ignorance becomes dharmadhatu wisdom, pride becomes all-accomplishing wisdom, jealousy becomes equalizing wisdom. Appearances: like nets, broken nets, broken pieces—objects dissolve, self-grasping dissolves. Structural note: connects poison transformation to wisdom manifestation. Register: Buddhist five-poison/wisdom transformation schema.
