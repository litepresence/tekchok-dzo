Field continuation verse. From this world south-east left, world-realm six beyond, Thal ba'i sgra called, savior 'Phan fully trained, victory banner umbrella etc. raised, flower fragment rain and scent, teacher himself and teaching, beautiful form reflections surrounding, bliss play arising. From this world south-west right, six below Thal ba wind, moving shaking space within, mutually moving hovering and, shaking from sounds arising, teacher's teaching wind moving, five possessing entering three. Detailed directional cosmology continues. The phrase five possessing entering three is ambiguous in Tibetan. Commentary interprets as five elements or aggregates and three doors of body, speech, and mind, but could also reference five wisdoms entering three realms. Context suggests the former interpretation fits the cosmological exposition, mapping elemental emergence to the three doors of action.

[645-657]
Remaining fields enumeration. Above that thirteen stacked, rin chen thal ba called, auspicious suns adorned, desirable qualities ornamented, magical letters marks beautiful, teacher's teaching form reflection complete, Ldal ldhi lotus eyes beautiful. Thal-ba retained as technical term rather than translating as dust or powder. While thal literally means dust or ashes, in this context it functions as a proper name for the field category. Scholar layer provides etymological analysis. Ldal ldhi, also written lda ldi, is a plant said to grow in pure lands with no standardized English equivalent. Retaining phonetic rendering with explanatory note in commentary.

[658-665]
North-west intermediate field. From this north-west intermediate, world-realm six, 'Dul ba'i thal ba called, offering complete with goddess, light filled sandalwood scent, teacher's teaching partial equal, sixteen years possessing beautiful form, very youthful surrounded. The directional schema combines cardinal points with intermediate spaces. This reflects Indian cosmological models adapted to Tibetan understanding. The six transcendent realms consistently mark field locations, suggesting a vertical coordinate system overlaid on directional geography.

[666-682]
Final two fields. Below that nine world, Dung ldan thal ba'i lha called, faith protecting scent intoxicated, swirling very blazing light, very flaming fire blazing, teacher himself and teaching, that retinue and enjoyment complete. From this world six, Star thal ba called, wheel stacked form, five and nine fully stacked, moon water waves ornamented, thunder sound lightning red tongues emitting, teacher's teaching scripture surrounded, light arising garland naga lineage, directions and intermediate all illuminating. Cosmological verse concludes detailed field description. The pattern of five-and-nine appears in multiple field descriptions. Five represents five elements, wisdoms, or perfections. Nine represents nine vehicles or stages. Stacked together they form complete path structure. The Tibetan preference for enumerative completeness manifests in these multiplied combinations.

Twenty-five stacked lotus dwelling directions-intermediate-above-below numberless fields pervading. Like scattered stars. From immeasurable fields explaining this Jambudvīpa sequence. Citation: external elements from wind, joining space element, then water, then earth. Extent 100,000 yojanas, thickness even. Four immeasurables and 100,000. One is four parts empty. Cosmological formation from elements: wind to space to water to earth. Yojana rendered as league following standard Buddhist lexicography, though actual measurement varies. The text's cosmological measurements are symbolic rather than empirical, suggesting retention of traditional units rather than metric conversion. The elemental sequence follows Abhidharmakośa cosmogony with tantric elaboration. The four immeasurables here refers to spatial directions, distinct from the brahmavihāras, though the pun may be intentional.

[694-711]
Continued cosmological description. Continents arrangement and Meru, wish-fulfilling tree and jewel possessing, sun moon individual gods and, great ocean method surrounded, small mountains and water-small, seven jewels certainly surrounded. Inside formless first from, form realm clear light, distant desire realm also, stainless moon and, sun great illuminating from, world realm expanded, other-power etc. above sequentially, then asura abodes, four continents humans sequentially, afflictions self possessing, lower realm abodes sequentially established. Standard Buddhist cosmology enumerated. Method surrounded uses thabs typically translated as method or skillful means but here functions as a verb meaning surrounded by or encircled by. Contextual interpretation: surrounded by the ocean which is the method or condition for world's existence. Other-power equals Paranirmitavaśavartin, rendered traditionally. Asura equals not-gods, maintaining Tibetan etymology where possible. Systematic decision to preserve Tibetan technical terms where English equivalents lack nuance.

Mu tig phreng ba'i rgyud citation. Sky wind supported, upon that water, hundred-thousand eleven, round coiling indeed established, from milk cream arising like, earth hundred-thousand twelve. Wind number 100,000. Wind gathering-contracting-projecting-lifting. Water pervading-holding-ripening three. Earth grinding-subtle-coarse three. Stirred down becoming like, mountain between mountain king, four steps great pinnacle, encircling ocean and mountains seven, continents and surrounding established, three thousand etc. realms. Desire form formless by, three realms that depending, neither existence nor nothing and, consciousness slight without, formless realm that from arisen. Pure abodes etc. embodied, above to below dripping manner, Akanishta etc. desire. Gods asuras humans, high then three abodes, animals hungry ghosts hells, those sentient beings birth four. That also eon first humans, form and youth marks possessing, self-light radiance body pervading, desire-increasing etc. merit food, beings life 80,000, male and female organs without. Then confusion cause two from, desire etc. afflictions, gradually coarse indeed became, senses etc. doors solid, merit exhausted therefore light etc. diminish, then gradually earth oil, Sālu etc. food eat. Detailed cosmological and anthropological narrative from pearl garland tantra. Muktikā or Mu tig phreng ba, the Pearl Garland Tantra, citation confirmed in various Tibetan collections. The embryological-cosmological parallel of cream from milk equaling earth from churning reflects traditional Indian homological thinking of microcosm-macrocosm correspondence. Wind 110,000 versus Earth 120,000 presents measurement discrepancy. Commentary addresses symbolic numerology while literal interpretation risks reification. Earth oil refers to primordial nutrient, sometimes translated as earth-essence or ground-nectar. Context suggests pre-agricultural sustenance. Sālu is a rice variety, rendered simply as rice with note that this marks transition to agricultural food sources in degeneration narrative.

Transition to specific Jambudvīpa cosmology. Common sūtras describe general features; uncommon tantras measure extensively. Here explained according to unsurpassed vehicle Vajra Pinnacle. From Ati bkod pa chen po establishing unmistaken meaning of actually-abiding entities. Great Brahmā field containing sky, Great Ocean hand lotus center pistils twenty-five trichiliocosms stacked abiding fields called ground-essence flower-adorned field. From within that thirteenth heart-center dPal gyi be'u nearby abides secret mantra vajra vehicle field Jambudvīpa this arrangement. Eon first forming, middle abiding, final destroying, finally empty four knowable. First forming vessel-content two sequences, vessel forming sequence: near here previously arisen world empty intermediate eon twenty passed below, element seed particles unclear color five arising sphere sky empty, above formless realm consciousness apprehending object arising element seed particles with dripping manner content above forming like, below vessel sequence stūpa steps like forming manner. The triad of sources of common, uncommon, and unsurpassed established at 757-760 guides translation approach. Unsurpassed vehicle perspective privileges Dzogchen interpretation over literal cosmography. Ati koṭa chen po or Great Ati Arrangement is a key Dzogchen source text. Retaining Sanskrit-Tibetan hybrid as established convention. Hand lotus center pistils presents complex mandala geometry. Pistils equals lotus heart or essence. Multiple nested spatial metaphors require careful English layering to avoid confusion. Element seed particles refers to subtle matter preceding manifest elements. Translation attempts to preserve seed metaphor while indicating pre-manifest state.

[757-780]
Hermeneutical triad establishing framework. Common sutras describe general features; uncommon tantras measure extensively. Here explained according to unsurpassed vehicle Vajra Pinnacle. From Ati bkod pa chen po establishing unmistaken meaning of actually-abiding entities. Actually-abiding uses dngos po meaning entity, thing, or reality, contrasted with dngos med meaning non-thing or emptiness. The unmistaken claims ontological correspondence between description and reality, a claim Delusion layer appropriately problematizes. Retain actually-abiding to preserve philosophical precision, though reality or entities might read more smoothly. Scholar layer addresses ontological implications.

Detailed wind formation. Seed syllable A uṃ sound three times renowned gives rise to suppressing-appearance wind, mouse black mouth's breath just rising, clouding sky like mist-cloud mass. Various vajra crossed form center yaṃ marked, four wind goddesses holding wind banners, color various blazing light, wind realm green indranīla form, vast thick forming, eon duration unmoving lifting strength showing. Extent dpag tshad 108,000, width 160,000. Water formation: gold essence cloud seven years rain stream, clear unmoving silt water round like full moon, water goddess dancing immeasurable, extent 112,000, width 5,000. Intermediate eon wind maṇḍala below grinding wind crushing sound, stirring water and wind, cream like gold ground 5,000, earth-forming earth 5,000, earth's fire 20,000. A uṃ or A-um rendering indicates sacred syllable status. Alternative AH-ŪṂ would be Sanskritized. Selected former as closer to Tibetan pronunciation while maintaining recognition as seed syllable. Mouse black mouth's breath presents vivid but bizarre imagery. Mouse-striped or speckled mouse modifying breath. Context suggests subtlety of mouse breath barely perceptible. Retained literal rendering with note in commentary. Wind 108,000 equals 100,000 plus 8,000. Tibetan sa ya equals 100,000. Systematic rendering maintains numerical integrity for scholar analysis.

Ocean wave separation. Sky wind particles immeasurable descend like space snow, become 100,000. Above that earth-supporting space turquoise color, sky particles fall swirling, natural action like ocean cloth, pervading equal dwelling, four-cornered form, four corners earth goddess four gold vases holding, four sides nāga sons powerful holding. Extent 110,000, depth 41,000. Element maṇḍalas like stūpa steps dependent formation. Sūtras explain intermediate sky divided equally. Fire maṇḍala 5,000 lifted, center fire extent 1,000 width 50,000, red light, common element ripening action. Water pervading shows beings' action particular. Fire ripening clarifies beings' body color. Wind particle completes beings' senses. Sky space opening abides beings' mind. Earth pressing shows beings' action and merit. These called vessel benefiting content. Nāga retained versus serpent spirit as established Buddhist technical term. Maṇḍala used throughout for dkyil 'khor meaning center-periphery or wholeness. Vessel benefiting content uses snod kyis bcud la phan pa where container benefits contained. Cosmological physiology: world-system as vessel creates conditions for beings as contents. The five elemental actions of water-ripening, fire-clarifying, wind-completing, space-opening, and earth-stabilizing establish homological framework connecting cosmos and body, addressed extensively in commentary layer.

[842-872]
Meru formation. Golden wheel form self-nature shaking power rising churns earth-water, like butter from milk dust impurity becomes gold sinking ground-base, clear rising center Meru 160,000 high, down gold ground pierced 320,000 total. Some tantras: down 12,400. Meru four directions: east silver, south vaiḍūrya, west padmarāga, north gold, sky colors harmonious. Meru gold ground 80,000 half below water, above half four steps stacked, lower wind step turquoise vajra crossed called g.yu'i rdo rje can, extent 80,000 equal to water, outside Meru 16,000 high, depth triple equal, width each up 10,000. Second step water lotus heap crystal blazing, outside Meru 8,000. Third step wheel stacked gold, outside 4,000. Fourth step jewel blazing coral fire light red, outside 2,000, showing rain falling or not by beings' action. Meru height discrepancy between main text at 320,000 total and some tantras at 12,400. Both preserved as textual evidence of variant traditions. Four directions equal four elements or precious substances: silver for east and clarity, vaidūrya for south and expansion, padmarāga for west and passion transformed, gold for north and wealth. Colors correspond to directional psychology. Step or bang rim equals stūpa terrace. Four steps equal four stages of material manifestation from wind to water to fire to earth ascending. Commentary provides symbolic interpretation.

Seven gold mountains and oceans. Seven gold mountains inside sequential: gNya' shing 'dzin, gShol mda' 'dzin, Seng ldeng can, Blta na sdug, Rta rna, Rnam 'dud, Mu khyud 'dzin, from water gap rising: 40,000, 20,000, 5,000, 2,500, 1,350, 625. Width each equals height. Between eight oceans surrounding, great nāga eight sporting. First play ocean width 80,000, subsequent half by half, depth triple. Outer surrounding iron formed, equal to gNya' shing 'dzin, some equal to Mu khyud 'dzin. Outer ocean four directions width 120,000. Continents: east lus 'phags moon-land protrusion 350, other sides 2,000, lus and lus 'phags right left supporting main half half. Jambudvīpa srog mkhar three sides 2,000 each long, short outside 4.5, right and left rnga yab main half half. West ba glang spyod round 7,500 surrounding, right g.yo ldan left lam mchog 'gro half half. North sgra mi snyan four corners four sides 2,000, right and left sgra mi snyan half half. This section contains the most intricate measurements in the text. Seven mountains with varying dimensions following halving sequence from 40,000 to 20,000 to 5,000 to 2,500 to 1,350 to 625. Continental geometries precise to fractional yojanas at 4.5. Tibetan proper names for mountains retained with descriptive translations available in commentary. Continent names standardized: Lū 'phags as Pūrvavideha, Ba lang spyod as Aparagodānīya, Sgra mi snyan as Uttarakuru. The measurement precision creates scientific impression that Delusion layer warns against literalizing. Translation preserves precision while commentary and other layers provide interpretive context.
