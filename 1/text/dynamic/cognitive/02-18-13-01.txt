Awareness reaching maturity. First: awareness matures—basis awareness manifests as path appearances, paths dissolve, circles complete. Maturity levels: half-body to full-body to complete circles—progressing through stages. Second: three aspects—external appearance, internal realization, secret awareness. External: appearances as luminous wisdom. Internal: body as mandala circles. Secret: awareness as dharmadhatu. Third: manifestations—moon-like, sun-like, star-like appearances, dawn-like clarity. When awareness matures: three kayas arise naturally, appearances manifest without effort, wisdom fills all space. Structural note: extensive treatment of realization stages. Register: highest Dzogchen terminology.
