Comprehensive extended analysis. The awareness reaching maturity section presents the progressive stages of Dzogchen realization through three measures—external, internal, and secret. The external measure involves the control of appearances as fields become light, direct objects cease to appear as solid, and even earth and stone take on a melted, insubstantial quality. The practitioner's own knowing penetrates everything, and the body begins to show signs of transformation—the bems po moves, wind finds its proper measure, and atomic particles become visible. The completion of this stage is marked by whatever appears becoming complete as a form body, with father and mother deities in union, fivefold mandalas, and round halos. The yogi's own body becomes light and clear, with natural movement. The internal measure shows the clearing of the body's dust, the appearance of five light rays from a white A in the heart center like a sun in a seeing-hole, shining through the light window of the sky. The crown shows wisdom wind abiding with natural uplifted appearance, the usnisa radiates five-colored light, and the five fingers display light garlands. The body pores become doorways to immeasurable pure fields where Buddhas and beings appear without number. All of this manifests through the eight gates of spontaneous presence as self-appearance without addition or subtraction. The secret measure involves the manifestation of mandalas in the skull and heart, various emanations for beings' benefit, six clairvoyances through the compassion door, wisdom knowing all phenomena, and the completion of Sambhogakaya in self-appearance. Through comprehensive documentation, complete understanding is established.
