Dzogchen crucial points - view, meditation, action. First: natural expression appears as light—recognizing own face is awareness-resonance inseparable from single expanse, primordially pure clarity-emptiness crystal-clear nature—decisive cutting is introduction to ultimate liberation ground, directly revealing naked View. Second: within that nature, without deliberate placement or abandonment, decisively cutting through natural meditative stability, neither distracted nor grasping—this is meditation. Third: awareness naturally lucent, beyond meditation object and meditator, liberated as arises, confidence in self-liberation without rejecting good or bad—first crucial point. Natural realm appears variously, beyond mere appearance—gathering self-lucid naked pristine cognition into unified vastness, reciting as self-lucid self-arisen, even grasping liberated. Looking at appearances infinite; looking at awareness not even one exists, naturally lucent self-arisen—pith instruction striking liberation ground. Compassion's vital point: awareness as means radiates outwardly—inwardly, do not cut trail, do not examine own face, leave whatever arises resting, recognizing uninterrupted knowing nakedly—liberation ground directly revealed. Structural note: essential Dzogchen pointing-out instructions.
