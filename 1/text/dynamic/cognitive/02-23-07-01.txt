[14278-14587]
Dzogchen crucial points (gnad)—view, meditation, and action presented as essential instructions. First: natural expression appears as light (rang bzhin rtsal snang 'od du shar ba)—recognizing own face (rang ngo shes pa) is awareness-resonance (rig pa rtsal) inseparable from single expanse (dbyings gcig), primordially pure clarity-emptiness crystal-clear nature (ka dag gsal stong shel gyis dag pa'i rang bzhin). Decisive cutting (gtad gcod) is introduction to ultimate liberation ground (grol gzhi don gyi ngo sprod), directly revealing naked View (ka ltar zol med zang thal du lta ba). View register: view as direct recognition, not philosophical position. Natural expression appears as light—this describes the Thögal (thod rgal) visionary experience where rigpa's natural display manifests as luminosity. View register: light as nature of mind, not external phenomenon. Translation risk: "light" suggesting visual experience only. Preservation: 'od here is the luminous nature of mind itself—awareness's natural radiance. It "appears" (shar) spontaneously, not created. "Recognizing own face" (rang ngo shes pa) is the essence of Dzogchen—mind recognizing its own nature. View register: recognition as immediate, not gradual. Translation risk: "own face" suggesting narcissism. Preservation: rang ngo means one's own nature, one's true face—the face before parents were born. This is recognition of buddha-nature, not ego-aggrandizement. "Awareness-resonance inseparable from single expanse" (rig pa rtsal dbyings gcig dbyer med) indicates that the dynamic display (rtsal) of awareness is not separate from the space (dbyings) in which it appears. View register: display and essence as unity. Translation risk: "resonance" suggesting vibration or sound. Preservation: rtsal means dynamic display, energy, expression—the play of awareness that is inseparable from awareness itself. "Primordially pure clarity-emptiness crystal-clear nature" (ka dag gsal stong shel gyis dag pa'i rang bzhin) describes the essence—empty yet clear, like crystal. View register: union of clarity and emptiness as Dzogchen essence. Translation risk: separate clarity and emptiness. Preservation: gsal stong is a unity—luminous emptiness, empty luminosity. Like crystal: transparent (empty) yet visible (clear). "Decisive cutting is introduction to ultimate liberation ground" (gtad gcod grol gzhi don gyi ngo sprod) indicates the pointing-out instruction that cuts through doubt. View register: introduction as sufficient, not preliminary. Translation risk: "introduction" suggesting beginning only. Preservation: ngo sprod is the complete teaching—pointing out what is already present. Gtad gcod (decisive cutting) cuts conceptual wavering. "Directly revealing naked View" (ka ltar zol med zang thal du lta ba) presents the view without coverings or elaboration. View register: naked view as immediate perception. Translation risk: "naked" suggesting exposure. Preservation: zol med means without covering, without hidden dimension—direct, unobstructed. Zang thal (copper-shining) indicates the unobstructed, direct quality. "Within that nature, without deliberate placement or abandonment, decisively cutting through natural meditative stability, neither distracted nor grasping—this is meditation" (de'i rang bzhin de nyid la bzhag dor dang 'dzin med gtad gcod gnyug ma'i ngang bzhag 'phro g.yengs med pa 'di ni sgom pa). View register: meditation as natural abiding, not fabrication. Translation risk: "meditation" suggesting technique. Preservation: sgom pa here is gnyug ma'i ngang bzhag—abiding in natural state. No placement (bzhag), no abandonment (dor)—no deliberate effort. "Awareness naturally lucent, beyond meditation object and meditator, liberated as arises, confidence in self-liberation without rejecting good or bad—first crucial point" (rig pa rang gsal sgom pa'i yul can dang yul las 'das pa shar grol grol tshod yid gnyis med pa dang po'i gnad). View register: action as natural expression of view. Translation risk: "action" suggesting deliberate behavior. Preservation: here "action" (spyod pa) is the natural unfolding—awareness naturally lucent, liberating whatever arises. "Confidence in self-liberation without rejecting good or bad" (grol tshod yid gnyis med pa) indicates the third crucial point—whatever arises, good or bad, liberates itself when recognized. View register: self-liberation as key method. Translation risk: "without rejecting" suggesting amorality. Preservation: not rejecting does not mean indulging—it means not suppressing, allowing natural liberation through recognition. "Natural realm appears variously, beyond mere appearance—gathering self-lucid naked pristine cognition into unified vastness" (rang bzhin klong du sna tshogs snang yang snang tsam las 'das te rang gsal zol med ka dag lhun gyis 'jug pa gcer grol). View register: variety within unity, appearance beyond mere appearance. Translation risk: "beyond mere appearance" denying appearance. Preservation: 'das pa means transcending—not denying appearance but recognizing its nature. "Reciting as self-lucid self-arisen" (rang gsal rang byung ngang du bzlas) applies the crucial point to mantra recitation—not deliberate repetition but natural expression. View register: practice becoming natural expression. Translation risk: "reciting" suggesting mechanical repetition. Preservation: bzlas pa here is spontaneous—the mantra arises naturally from awareness, not from effort. "Even grasping liberated" ('dzin pa nyid grol) indicates that not only calm states but even the movement of grasping liberates when recognized. View register: all states equally valid for liberation. Translation risk: "even" suggesting grasping is normatively bad. Preservation: in Dzogchen, grasping recognized is grasping liberated—no state is excluded from recognition. "Looking at appearances infinite; looking at awareness not even one exists, naturally lucent self-arisen" (snang ba la bltas na mtha' yas rig pa la bltas na gcig kyang med rang gsal rang byung). View register: appearances vast, awareness simple. Translation risk: "not even one" suggesting nihilism. Preservation: awareness cannot be counted or objectified—when looked for, it cannot be found as object, yet is naturally present. "Pith instruction striking liberation ground" (grol gzhi gcer gnon man ngag) indicates these instructions hit the mark directly—pointing to liberation without detour. View register: pith instructions as direct pointing. Translation risk: "striking" suggesting violence. Preservation: gcer gnon means hitting directly, precisely—like an arrow hitting the target. No wasted movement. "Compassion's vital point: awareness as means radiates outwardly—inwardly, do not cut trail, do not examine own face, leave whatever arises resting, recognizing uninterrupted knowing nakedly—liberation ground directly revealed" (thugs rje'i gnad rig pa thabs su phar 'chang nang phyi'i lam mi gcod rang ngo mi rtog ci shar ba ci bzhag yengs med shes par rig grol gzhi zang thal ngo sprod). View register: compassion as dynamic expression of awareness. Translation risk: "compassion" suggesting emotion. Preservation: thugs rje is wisdom's responsiveness—not pity but natural, appropriate response. "Do not cut trail" (lam mi gcod) means do not interrupt the natural flow. View register: continuity as essential. Translation risk: "trail" suggesting path to follow. Preservation: lam here is the continuity of recognition—don't interrupt it with examination or deliberate action. "Do not examine own face" (rang ngo mi rtog) indicates that recognition is immediate, not achieved through analysis. View register: recognition as seeing, not thinking. Translation risk: "do not examine" suggesting anti-intellectualism. Preservation: rtog pa here is conceptual examination—don't try to figure out awareness, just recognize it directly. "Leave whatever arises resting" (ci shar ba ci bzhag) is the essence—don't manipulate, don't alter, just let be. View register: non-manipulation as supreme method. Translation risk: passivity or laziness. Preservation: bzhag means resting in natural state—not suppressing, not indulging, just allowing natural liberation. "Recognizing uninterrupted knowing nakedly" (yengs med shes par rig) indicates continuous recognition without distraction. View register: recognition as continuous, not momentary. Translation risk: "uninterrupted" suggesting effort. Preservation: yengs med means without distraction—natural continuity, not forced maintenance. "Liberation ground directly revealed" (grol gzhi zang thal ngo sprod) concludes—the ground of liberation is directly pointed out, not achieved. View register: liberation as recognition of what is. Translation risk: "ground" suggesting foundation to build on. Preservation: grol gzhi is the basis of liberation—already present, just recognized. Zang thal indicates the direct, unobstructed quality.

This section (14278-14587) presents the essential Dzogchen pointing-out instructions—crucial points of view, meditation, and action. The architecture moves from view (direct recognition) through meditation (natural abiding) to action (self-liberation), then integrates them. The view throughout is that Dzogchen is direct and simple—recognize your own nature, let it be, whatever arises liberates itself. The translator must preserve the pithy, direct quality of these instructions while conveying their profound depth. The "copper-shining" (zang thal) quality—direct, unobstructed, naked—is the hallmark of Dzogchen instruction. These are not philosophical positions but direct pointings to immediate experience. The practitioner who recognizes these crucial points has the essence of the entire teaching.
