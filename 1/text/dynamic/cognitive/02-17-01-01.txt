The text inaugurates a section on the progressive manner of taking meditative experience into practice through definite ascertainment of the path. This opening structural movement establishes two distinct audiences: those whose cognition operates through object-oriented apprehension, and those whose cognition manifests as self-arising awareness. The former require gradual guidance through superior methods, while the latter engage directly with the essential points of practice. The transition establishes a threefold framework for the first topic: distinctions among practitioners, methods of practice, and the actual substance of what is to be practiced.

Twelve categories of yogins are enumerated, forming a graduated typology that maps the landscape of practitioners from those fixated upon characteristics and words to those who have completed the path and attained liberation. The structural sequence moves from fixation upon signs through various stages of engagement with meditation, action, cause, condition, and fruit, culminating in yogins who have perfected meaning and liberation. This taxonomy serves as a diagnostic tool for situating practitioners within the framework of the Great Perfection teachings.

The text delineates which among the twelve categories achieve liberation and which do not. The first eight categories remain unliberated: the word-yogin fixated upon terminology, the sign-yogin attached to marks, the subsequent-yogin abiding in the stage of aspiration, the naturally-abiding-yogin cultivating non-conceptual absorption, the appearance-mind-yogin who asserts all appearances as mind, the engagement-action-yogin bound by extensive conduct, the cause-action-yogin who looks to causes, and the condition-action-yogin who seeks true meaning through conduct. Each category demonstrates a specific mode of binding through conceptual fixation.

Four latter categories achieve liberation: the fruit-completing-yogin who carries realization into the path without abiding in stages or paths, the meaning-yogin who sees true nature in the purified appearances of the intermediate state, the liberation-completing-yogin who sees self-nature upon reaching the stage of ascertainment, and the completion-perfecting-yogin who abides as the primordially pure great Buddha without departure or arrival. These four constitute authentic Great Perfection practitioners for whom stages and paths require neither purification nor traversal.

A crucial hermeneutical clarification follows. Although the text states that practitioners need not traverse or purify stages and paths, this applies specifically to those who have actualized clear light directly. Such practitioners simultaneously accomplish lower stages and paths through the completion of higher realizations. The completion of the above spontaneously perfects the below, demonstrating the principle that in the Great Perfection, the highest realization encompasses and completes all subsidiary attainments without separate engagement.

The section transitions to establishing the supreme place of the Great Perfection through general presentation of yogin distinctions and particular explanation of qualified individuals capable of receiving these teachings. This prepares the ground for the subsequent detailed presentation of the five types of qualified practitioners.
