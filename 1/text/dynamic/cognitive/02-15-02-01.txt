[474-668]
Structural enumeration of the five winds, each subdivided into five aspects—life-holding, fire-equal, color-radiance, all-pervading, compassionless karma. View register: Dzogchen base-practitioner, not sutric dependent-arising. Risk: "wind" as vital energy versus atmospheric air—preserve specialized terminology.

Continuing explanation of the five winds and their wisdom correspondences. The text establishes that each wind abides in specific relationship to awareness-wisdom, lamp, and bindhu. Note the causal language ("because of") indicating tantric reasoning. Risk: "compassionless" as technical term—preserve without normative reading.

Transition from wind-system to kayas and wisdoms. Establishes the two-knowing: dharmatā's all-knowing and dharmapossessor's all-aspect-knowing. View register: Dzogchen rigpa, direct recognition. Risk: "wisdom-expanse gathering" as technical Dzogchen phrase requiring consistent translation.

Detailed exposition of five fires, five earths, five waters, five spaces—each with awareness correspondence. Structural pattern: element, then sequence of correspondences. View register: tantric correspondence system. Risk: "thigle" as bindu term—preserve Tibetan in glossary.

Completes five elements analysis and transitions to supported's fourfold purity: kayas, tone, wisdom, activities. Structural function: establishing framework for kaya explanation. Risk: "tone" as inner sound—avoid musical reading. Preservation requirement: maintain sequence of supported categories.

Compact structural conclusion of kaya exposition. Three kayas defined through awareness-types: thought-free (Dharmakāya), uncensored clear (Sambhogakāya), whatever-appearing (Nirmāṇakāya). View register: Dzogchen rigpa, not abhidharma classification. Risk: "whatever-appearing" as freedom from conceptual construction.
