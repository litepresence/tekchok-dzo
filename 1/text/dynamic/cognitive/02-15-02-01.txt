Life-holding wind (srog 'dzin) subdivides into five distinct aspects, each with precise location and function within the subtle body system. The structural function provides detailed exposition of the vital wind architecture that supports recognition. Root-holding life (rtsa 'dzin) anchors to the channels; protecting life (skyob byed) provides defense; radiating life (rnam par 'phro ba) extends outward; impure life (mi gtsang ba) processes contaminants; shaking life (rnam par 'dar byed) creates necessary movement. The view register presents these winds as wisdom-energetic patterns, not merely physiological functions. Translation risk: literal rendering of wind names without preserving technical specificity reduces precision to generic description. Preservation requires maintaining the fivefold structure as systematic anatomy of subtle energetics, with each wind's location and function precisely mapped.

Fire-equal wind (me mnyam) presents fivefold subdivision continuing the systematic wind analysis. These winds operate in non-dual correspondence with the life-holding winds: fire-equal wind one non-dual with life-holding, fire-equal two non-dual with rigpa, fire-equal three non-dual with lamp, fire-equal four non-dual with bindu, fire-equal five non-dual with prajna. The structural function maintains parallel architecture across wind categories. The view register presents winds as wisdom-energetic matrices, not physiological breath. Translation risk: "fire-equal" terminology could be misread as comparative (equal to fire) rather than technical identity (fire-equal as specific wind category). Preservation requires maintaining the wind-wisdom non-dual correspondences as functional mappings, not poetic associations—these are technical specifications, not decorative language.

Color-radiance producing wind (bkra) and all-pervading wind (kun khyab) complete the five-wind system with their wisdom correspondences and perceptual dimensions. The five color-radiance winds correspond to: consciousness-producing, mind-arising, radiance-possessing, consuming, and agitating functions. The five all-pervading winds correspond to: wisdom-pervading, lamp-pervading, awareness-pervading, memory-pervading, and body-holding-pervading. The structural function completes the wind enumeration with wisdom-object correlations. The view register presents appearance-making as wisdom function operating through wind activity. Translation risk: "color-radiance" (bkra) and "radiance" (gzi mdangs) terminology could be conflated, losing distinct technical meanings. Preservation requires maintaining the object-correspondences as establishing the perceptual dimension of wind function—what winds make appear and how they appear.

[527-540]
Compassionless karma wind (snying rje med pa las kyi rlung) presents the fivefold completion of the wind system, addressing the most active and karmic dimension of subtle energetics. The five karma winds are: moving, liberating, reversing, accelerating, and instantaneous. Their pervasions span: aggregates, moments, bardo, thought, and the three times. The structural function concludes wind enumeration with comprehensive kinetic range. The view register presents karma as movement pattern, not moral judgment—this wind category operates without discrimination, hence "compassionless" as technical designation for non-selective kinetic function. Translation risk: "compassionless" could be read as ethical deficiency or absence of compassion rather than technical terminology for non-discriminating pervasion. Preservation requires maintaining this as technical designation for kinetic function operating across all domains without selection.

[541-590]
Etymological explanations and integration with kayas and wisdoms connect the wind system to broader Dzogchen framework. The twenty-five winds ultimately gather into five root winds, each with specific etymological derivation. Life-holding wind: because of holding wisdom-life; color-radiance wind: because of possessing five wisdom-lights naturally; fire-equal wind: because of abiding without separation from wisdom-appearance; karma wind: because of liberating into wisdom's authentic expanse. The structural function connects wind system to Three Kayas and Five Wisdoms. The view register presents etymology as recognition support, not linguistic analysis—understanding why winds are named as they are supports recognition of their nature. Translation risk: "because of" (phyir) constructions could imply causal generation rather than natural expression or functional designation. Preservation requires maintaining the two knowings (thams cad mkhyen, rnam pa thams cad mkhyen) establishing Dharmakaya-Sambhogakaya correspondence to dharmata-internal-appearance and dharmachan-external-appearance.

[591-668]
Synthesis and transition to inner-arising demonstrates winds as wisdom display abiding in the expanse without ever departing from it. The five winds ultimately arise from the expanse as its display, never separate from it, never truly arising or ceasing. The structural function demonstrates winds as wisdom display abiding inexpanse. The view register presents winds as ultimately non-arising from expanse, display without departure. Translation risk: "arising from expanse" could imply causal generation or emanation rather than display-without-departure. Preservation priority: the citation from Kunsal establishes the three-kaya presence through wind-wisdom integration—body, speech, and mind each have their specific manner of abiding through wind-wisdom integration. This triadic structure must remain clear as the organizing principle.
