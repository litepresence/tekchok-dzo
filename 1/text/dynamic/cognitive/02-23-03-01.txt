Signs of death in bardo. In space realm, reflections become impermanent and dissolve. Without moon-form—that is death. When limbs break in four, in four months. When head breaks above, in three months. When upper-lower separate, in two months. When rolled into ball, in one month. Connection cord of sky-earth—if cut, cannot exceed nineteen days. From Mount Meru sides, White Lioness not descending—in sixteen days cannot but befall. Between mountain and plain, wish-fulfilling tree trunk breaks—these examined by wise. Ocean water vapor dissolves—divided by wise in sequence. Structural note: detailed signs for recognizing approaching death in Dzogchen bardo teachings.
