Three kaya seated postures. Nirmāṇakāya posture: lion (seng ge) posture—feet apart, two eyes focused, pressing vital points, straightening spine, hands in meditation mudra, pointing to wisdom realm. Sambhogakāya posture: elephant posture—lying down like elephant, body heavy, pressing three gates, golden sky appearance, all accomplishments arising. Dharmakāya posture: rishi (sages) posture—cross-legged, like space, neither moving nor staying. Each posture connects to specific kaya manifestation: nirmāṇakāya appears in world, sambhogakāya in pure realms, dharmakāya beyond all form. Structural note: connects physical posture to subtle energy and kaya realization.
