[3600-3623]
Structural function: This section establishes the progressive view system, presenting the verbal view through seven individual mental discriminations. The structural arrangement presents these discriminations as progressive realizations: action-free from the beginning, effort-free natural liberation, progressive guidance through superior intelligence, transcendence of virtue and vice, great non-doing and non-arising, unmodified self-purity, and self-arisen self-liberation. This sevenfold schema provides a comprehensive map of the view's progressive articulation.

[3600-3613]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen view through its progressive verbal formulations. Each discrimination represents a dimension of the view: the freedom from action that characterizes primordial purity, the effortlessness of natural liberation, the progressive guidance that leads beings of different capacities, the transcendence of conventional moral categories, the great non-doing that transcends causality, the unmodified nature of self-purity, and the self-arisen quality of self-liberation. These seven capture the complete view in its progressive unfolding.

[3614-3630]
Preservation note: The distinction between verbal view and meaning view establishes the hermeneutical framework of the tradition. The verbal view represents the progressive articulations accessible to conceptual understanding, while the meaning view represents the direct recognition of dharmatā beyond concepts. This distinction requires preservation for its function in guiding practitioners from conceptual understanding to direct recognition. The verse from the source text presents this distinction in both technical and accessible formulations.

[3631-3660]
Structural function: This section presents the nine individual progressive views of the nine yānas, establishing the systematic presentation of views according to the capacities they address. The structural arrangement follows the fourfold schema: outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed. This fourfold structure encompasses the complete range of views from the most accessible to the most profound, demonstrating how the tradition accommodates practitioners of different capacities while maintaining the ultimate view as the culmination.

[3661-3690]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen view as the unsurpassed view that encompasses all others. The outer view of phenomena presents appearances as mind's discrimination, the inner view of dharmatā recognizes nature and characteristics as illusion, the secret view of self-awareness sees karmic connections as like a chain, and the unsurpassed view is the suchness of expanse and rigpa. This fourfold presentation establishes the progressive refinement of view while maintaining the ultimate non-duality as the final recognition.

[3691-3720]
Translation risk: The technical terminology for the four views—outer, inner, secret, unsurpassed—requires precise rendering to maintain their specific functions. The "secret view" of self-awareness refers to the recognition of karmic connections, not to any hidden teaching. The "unsurpassed view" of expanse and rigpa represents the non-dual recognition that transcends all conceptual formulations. These technical distinctions require careful preservation to maintain the graduated nature of the presentation.

[3721-3750]
Structural function: This section presents the nature view in four aspects: abiding view, pure-seeing view, nature view, and unfabricated view. The structural arrangement establishes these as dimensions of the complete view rather than separate views. The abiding view recognizes samsara and nirvana as primordially beyond suffering, the pure-seeing view transcends cause, effect, effort, and achievement, the nature view recognizes appearance and existence as naturally liberated, and the unfabricated view presents the great expansive openness beyond extremes.

[3751-3780]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen view as encompassing multiple dimensions of recognition. The abiding view establishes the primordial purity of all phenomena, the pure-seeing view transcends the karmic framework of effort and result, the nature view recognizes the self-liberated quality of all appearance, and the unfabricated view presents the openness that transcends all conceptual limits. These four aspects together establish the completeness of the view, demonstrating how it addresses all possible dimensions of experience.

[3781-3810]
Preservation note: The multiple verses from the source text present the nature view through poetic and technical formulations. These verses establish the view as the recognition that transcends all ordinary frameworks: cause and effect, effort and achievement, acceptance and rejection, existence and non-existence. The preservation of these verses in their relational context maintains their function as both validation and practice support. The concluding identification of this as the "view of the expressed" establishes its character as the final articulation.

[3811-3840]
Structural function: This section presents the boundary of the general view, establishing when one has entered the expanse of recognition. The structural arrangement distinguishes between the general boundary of individual realization and the specific boundary of the verbal view. The boundary of the verbal view is mental discrimination, while transcending that discrimination is the boundary of meaning. This establishes the graduated progression from conceptual to non-conceptual recognition.

[3841-3870]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen view as having specific boundaries of recognition. The boundary of the verbal view is the capacity for mental discrimination—the point at which one can articulate the view conceptually. The boundary of meaning is the transcendence of that discrimination—the point at which one recognizes directly beyond concepts. This distinction establishes the graduated path while maintaining that the ultimate recognition transcends all boundaries.

[3871-3900]
Translation risk: The technical terminology for the boundaries of view requires precise rendering to maintain their specific functions. The "boundary" here refers to the limit or extent of a particular view, not to a restrictive barrier. The distinction between the boundary of the verbal view and the boundary of meaning establishes the relationship between conceptual and non-conceptual recognition. These technical distinctions require careful preservation to maintain the epistemological framework.

[3901-3930]
Structural function: This section presents the second topic: recognizing one's own view as the great perfection view of action-free spontaneous accomplishment. The structural arrangement establishes this recognition as the foundation for practice, presenting three subdivisions that will be elaborated subsequently. This structural marker establishes the transition from the systematic presentation of views to the specific recognition of the Dzogchen view as one's own.

[3931-3960]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen view as one's own innate recognition rather than an external teaching to be acquired. The view of action-free spontaneous accomplishment establishes the effortlessness that characterizes this tradition. The recognition that this is one's own view—primordially present rather than newly achieved—dissolves the duality between practitioner and path. This view enables the practitioner to rest in natural recognition without the anxiety of needing to achieve something.

[3961-3990]
Preservation note: The structural marker indicating three subdivisions establishes the framework for the subsequent presentation. This organizational structure requires preservation for its function in guiding the reader through the material. The identification of the view as "action-free spontaneous accomplishment" captures the essential character of the Dzogchen approach: not something to be achieved through effort but something to be recognized as already present.

[3991-4020]
Structural function: This section concludes the presentation of the view section, establishing the foundation for the subsequent meditation and result presentations. The structural arrangement completes the systematic exposition of the view, having presented the verbal view, the nine progressive views, the four nature views, the boundaries, and the recognition of one's own view. This comprehensive presentation establishes the theoretical foundation for the practical instructions that follow.

[4021-4050]
View register: The perspective here presents the completed view as the foundation for all subsequent practice. The recognition that the view encompasses all dimensions of experience—outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassed—establishes the comprehensiveness of the approach. The view that this recognition is one's own primordial nature rather than an external acquisition dissolves the duality between path and fruition. This view enables the practitioner to engage with the subsequent instructions from the perspective of recognition rather than achievement.

[4051-4080]
Translation risk: The technical terminology for the view categories—verbal view, meaning view, individual progressive views, nature view—requires precise rendering to maintain their specific functions. These terms represent different modalities of the same recognition rather than separate views. The distinction between them establishes the graduated path from conceptual understanding to direct recognition. These technical distinctions require careful preservation to maintain the pedagogical structure.

[4081-4110]
Structural function: This section presents the hermeneutical framework for understanding the view, establishing the relationship between words and meaning. The structural arrangement presents words as the cause of expression and thought, establishing the connection between verbal formulation and conceptual understanding. This framework guides the practitioner from the verbal view to the meaning view, from conceptual understanding to direct recognition.

[4111-4140]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen view as requiring transcendence of verbal and conceptual formulations. The recognition that words and thoughts are the cause of conceptual understanding establishes the limitation of the verbal view. The view that meaning transcends words establishes the necessity of direct recognition beyond conceptual formulation. This view guides the practitioner from intellectual understanding to experiential recognition.

[4141-4170]
Preservation note: The verse from the Talgyur presents the relationship between words, meaning, and direct perception. This verse establishes the hermeneutical framework of the tradition: words lead to thought, thought leads to discrimination, and discrimination must be transcended through direct perception. This framework requires preservation for its function in guiding the practitioner from conceptual to non-conceptual recognition.

[4171-4200]
Structural function: This section presents the concluding elements of the view section, establishing the transition to the subsequent meditation presentation. The structural arrangement completes the systematic exposition of the view, having established the verbal and meaning views, the progressive and nature views, the boundaries, and the hermeneutical framework. This comprehensive presentation provides the foundation for the practical instructions that follow.

[4201-4230]
View register: The perspective here presents the completed view as the recognition that encompasses all dimensions of experience. The view that all phenomena are primordially pure, naturally liberated, and spontaneously accomplished establishes the non-dual recognition that characterizes the tradition. This view dissolves the duality between samsara and nirvana, effort and achievement, path and fruition. The practitioner who recognizes this view can engage with all subsequent instructions from the perspective of natural perfection.

[4231-4260]
Translation risk: The technical terminology for the view of "action-free spontaneous accomplishment" requires precise rendering to maintain its specific meaning. This view does not advocate inaction or passivity but recognizes the effortlessness of natural perfection. The distinction between this view and nihilistic interpretations requires careful preservation to maintain the practical orientation of the teaching. The term "spontaneous accomplishment" captures the natural unfolding of recognition without forced effort.
