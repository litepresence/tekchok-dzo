Structural function: Enumeration of bardo experience categories and clairvoyances (mngon shes). Systematic presentation: second and third categories have twenty-four each, remaining three have six each—divided into 134 portions, gathered into six groups of six. The thirty-six's fifth comprises six faculties with outflows. View register: Abhidharma-style systematic enumeration applied to bardo phenomenology. Translation risk: The numerical classifications appear arbitrary without recognizing their correspondence to subtle body energetics. Preservation: The correlation between the 134 portions and six groups must remain mathematically precise.

Extended recognition of the bardo experience framework as representing progressive stages of clarity as obscurations dissolve. The numerical divisions—24, 6, 134, 36—are not arbitrary but correspond to specific energetic patterns in the subtle body. The six faculties with outflows correspond to ordinary perception; the thirty without outflows correspond to increasingly purified perception; the utterly without outflows represents complete purification. The recognition required is that these numbers describe actual phenomenological experiences, not abstract categories.

Extended recognition of the first group's six faculties seeing beyond—thirty without outflows, last utterly without outflows. The six clairvoyances enumerated: knowledge of previous realms (sngon gnas rjes su dran pa), death and transmigration ('chi 'pho rjes su dran pa), knowledge of birth (skye ba rjes su dran pa), knowledge of others' minds (sems can gzhan gyi sems rjes su dran pa), knowledge of all hidden appearances (lkog gyur mngon par shes pa), seeing and knowing six realms—clairvoyance of purified faculties. Recognition: These are not supernatural powers to be acquired but natural capacities revealed when obscurations are cleared.

Extended recognition of the fourth attainment: retentive powers (gzungs) enable previously heard Dharma to appear simultaneously, never-before-heard Dharma also arising—called dharmata bardo. This is the fruition of recognition in the bardo state—access to all Dharma, heard and unheard, arising spontaneously from dharmata. The recognition required is that this is not supernatural acquisition but natural function revealed when the dualistic mind that obstructs knowing is dissolved.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents the systematic enumeration of bardo experiences and the six clairvoyances that manifest in the bardo state. The recognition required is that these are not attainments to be achieved but natural capacities that emerge when the obscurations of the physical body and conceptual mind are cleared. The translator must preserve both the systematic precision of the enumeration and the understanding that these are natural functions, not supernatural acquisitions. The dharmata bardo as the state where all Dharma arises spontaneously represents the culmination of the bardo journey—complete access to wisdom without obstruction. The six clairvoyances demonstrate the complete knowledge available when the limitations of physical embodiment are transcended.

The bardo state reveals the mind's natural clarity and capacity for complete knowing.
Recognition of these capacities leads to complete liberation.
Dzogchen reveals the natural state.
Liberation is recognition.
