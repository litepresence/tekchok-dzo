[10900-11181]
Three kayas in Dzogchen—definition, divisions, characteristics, and fruition. Essence (ngo bo): permanent abiding nature serving as support for all dharmas of nirvana (mya ngan las 'das pa'i chos thams cad kyi rten du gyur pa). Definition (nges tshig): stainless (dri ma med pa), transparent penetration (snying po la rdol ba), self-perfected Great Perfection (rang byung rdzogs pa chen po). Divisions (dbye ba): dharmakaya (chos sku), sambhogakaya (longs sku), nirmanakaya (sprul sku). View register: Dzogchen distinctive understanding of kayas as path-appearances rather than ultimate fruition.

[Extended Analysis: Essence as Permanent Abiding Nature]
The essence of three kayas is the "permanent abiding nature" (rtag tu gnas pa'i rang bzhin) serving as support for all nirvana dharmas. View register: permanence as unchanging nature, not eternal duration. Translation risk: "permanent" suggesting eternalism. Preservation: rtag tu gnas means abiding without change—the nature of mind does not change while its manifestations vary. This is permanence of nature, not persistence in time.

[Extended Analysis: Stainless and Transparent Penetration]
"Stainless" (dri ma med pa) indicates freedom from afflictive and cognitive obscurations. "Transparent penetration" (snying po la rdol ba) indicates the essence clearly visible, not hidden. View register: clarity as natural, not achieved. Translation risk: "stainless" suggesting purification process. Preservation: dri ma med means never stained—the nature was never obscured, only apparently so. The transparency is natural, not produced.

[Extended Analysis: Self-Perfection of Great Perfection]
"Self-perfected Great Perfection" (rang byung rdzogs pa chen po) is the definition—already complete, not needing improvement. View register: perfection as intrinsic, not developed. Translation risk: "self-perfected" suggesting achievement. Preservation: rang byung rdzogs pa means spontaneously complete—the kayas are not constructed but recognized. This is the Dzogchen view: nothing to add, only to recognize.

[Extended Analysis: Three Divisions Standard and Distinctive]
The three divisions are standard across Buddhism: dharmakaya (truth body), sambhogakaya (enjoyment body), nirmanakaya (emanation body). However, Dzogchen has distinctive understanding. View register: same terms, different significance. Translation risk: assuming common understanding applies. Preservation: while terms are shared, Dzogchen emphasizes that kayas are "path-appearances" (lam snang), not merely fruition.

[Extended Analysis: Path-Appearances vs. Fruition]
"Though common vehicles consider Three Kayas as fruition, Great Perfection regards them as path-appearances" (theg pa thun mong bas sku gsum 'bras bur 'dod kyang rdzogs pa chen po lam snang du 'dod). View register: kayas present throughout, not only at end. Translation risk: "path" suggesting preliminary stage. Preservation: lam snang means appearances on the path—the kayas manifest as soon as recognition dawns, not only at final buddhahood. Common vehicles see kayas as result of long practice; Dzogchen sees them as naturally present.

[Extended Analysis: Dharmakaya as Self-Appearance]
"Dharmakaya is self-appearance" (chos sku rang snang yin)—as long as dharmas exist, mind exists, therefore path; as long as kaya exists, body exists, also path-appearance, not ultimate. View register: dharmakaya not separate from appearances. Translation risk: "self-appearance" suggesting solipsism. Preservation: rang snang means mind's own display—dharmakaya is not a separate realm but the empty, luminous nature of all appearance.

[Extended Analysis: Appearance of Exhaustion as Ultimate]
"When main measure reached, appearance of exhaustion dissolving into primordial purity—this is it" (gtsod gtugs pa na zad pa'i snang ba ka dag tu 'gags pa 'di yin). View register: exhaustion of phenomena revealing purity. Translation risk: "exhaustion" suggesting nihilism. Preservation: zad pa means exhausting the apparent solidity of phenomena—when this dissolves, primordial purity (ka dag) is revealed. This is the ultimate.

[Extended Analysis: Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya as Path-Appearances]
Sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya are "path-appearances—in rank of various appearances, not ultimate, free of extremes, markless, equal" (lam snang du longs sku dang sprul sku snang sna'i grangs su mchis kyang don dam pa ma yin pa mtha' bral mtshan ma med pa mnyam pa). View register: form kayas as supports for recognition, not ultimate. Translation risk: form kayas devalued. Preservation: they are "not ultimate" (don dam pa ma yin) compared to dharmakaya, but they are essential skillful means. "Free of extremes, markless, equal" indicates their nature is the same as dharmakaya.

[Extended Analysis: Dzogchen Distinction Summary]
The structural note emphasizes "Dzogchen distinction of kayas from common vehicles." View register: Dzogchen sees kayas as naturally present, not constructed; as path, not merely result; as indivisible in essence, though appearing as three. Translation risk: distinction appearing as sectarian superiority. Preservation: this is pedagogical difference, not sectarian claim. Dzogchen emphasizes immediate recognition; common vehicles emphasize gradual development. Both are skillful means for different capacities.

[Extended Analysis: Kayas Throughout the Path]
In Dzogchen, kayas are recognized from the beginning—dharmakaya as the empty essence of mind, sambhogakaya as its luminous nature, nirmanakaya as its compassionate display. View register: kayas as aspects of experience, not far-off goals. Translation risk: kayas appearing abstract or distant. Preservation: the three are present right now—emptiness of thoughts, clarity of awareness, display of phenomena. Recognition makes them kayas; non-recognition makes them ordinary.

[Extended Analysis: Fruition as Recognition]
The fruition ('bras bu) in Dzogchen is not attainment of new kayas but recognition of kayas always present. View register: fruition as removal of obscuration, not construction. Translation risk: "fruition" suggesting future achievement. Preservation: the result is present as ground—the path reveals what was always the case. This is the distinctive Dzogchen emphasis: you are already buddha, just recognize it.

[Structural Synthesis: Three Kayas in Dzogchen Framework]
This section (10900-11181) presents the complete Dzogchen understanding of the three kayas. The architecture moves from definition through divisions to distinctive Dzogchen interpretation. The view throughout is that kayas are naturally present as path-appearances, not merely distant fruition. The translator must preserve the technical terminology—dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya—while conveying the Dzogchen nuance that these are recognized from the beginning, not constructed at the end. The essence is self-perfected Great Perfection; the fruition is appearance of exhaustion dissolving into primordial purity. This is Dzogchen's direct pointing: you are already the three kayas; simply recognize your own nature.
