Three kayas in Dzogchen - definition, divisions, characteristics, fruition. Essence: permanent abiding nature serving as support for all dharmas of nirvana. Definition: stainless, transparent penetration, self-perfected Great Perfection. Divisions: dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya. Though common vehicles consider Three Kayas as fruition, Great Perfection regards them as path-appearances. Dharmakaya is self-appearance—as long as dharmas exist, mind exists, therefore path; as long as kaya exists, body exists, also path-appearance, not ultimate. When main measure reached, appearance of exhaustion dissolving into primordial purity—this is it. Sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya are path-appearances—in rank of various appearances, not ultimate, free of extremes, markless, equal. Structural note: Dzogchen distinction of kayas from common vehicles.
