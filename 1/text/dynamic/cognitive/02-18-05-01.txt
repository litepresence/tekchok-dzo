[4601-4695]
Speech training in Dzogchen practice. First: reduce ordinary speech—speak less, then gradually speak only when necessary, eventually single syllable silence. When silence established, mantras and recitation cease—nothing to recite. Rest in silence: even body gestures stopped. Ultimately: speech cut, meaning arises directly—wordless transmission. When speech stops, mind naturally rests. Structural note: connects to Mahāyāna silence teachings and Buddhist "noble silence." Register: practical meditation instruction style.
