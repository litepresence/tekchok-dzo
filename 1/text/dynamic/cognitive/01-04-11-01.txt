Illusion doctrine introduction. First position: yul yul can—object and subject—not established, yet ma grub pa rig pa'i ye shes—unestablished awareness wisdom—exists in ultimate truth as sgyu ma'i tshul—manner of illusion. Madhyamaka two truths applied to path: meditation qualities as path grounds, fruition as Buddha wisdom like illusion, Dharmakāya benefiting through illusion. Yum bar ma—intermediate Prajñāpāramitā—citation establishes canonical basis. All phenomena, nirvāṇa, and even something superior to nirvāṇa—all like dream, like illusion. Progressive universalization of emptiness to include all possible designations.

Svātantrika interpretation analysis. Three sub-schools enumerated: sgyu ma rigs grub tu 'dod pa—illusion as established reasoning, sgyu ma ltar snang du 'dod pa—appearance as merely illusion-like, sgyu ma tsam por 'dod pa—mere illusion. Rang rgyud 'og ma ba—Autonomous Lower School—as designation for Svātantrika. These distinctions concern degree of conventional existence accorded to illusion-appearance. Structural function: present Svātantrika as maintaining some ontological status for conventional appearances.

Prasaṅgika transcendence. Don dam par sgyu ma tsam du'ang mi gnas—not even illusion abides in ultimate truth. Yul dang rnam pa med pa—no objects or aspects—therefore med par myong ba'i so so rang rig—self-aware experience—also med pa—not existent. Mo gsham gyi bu—barren woman's son—as standard example of total non-existence. Kun rdzob la bden par med pas—conventional truth not truly existent—therefore don dam la gang yang mi gnas—nothing abides in ultimate. Rmi lam sad pa—awakening from dream—as metaphor for transcendence of all designation.
