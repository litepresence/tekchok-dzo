Two truths exposition. All phenomena included within saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are of the nature of the two truths: conventional and ultimate. Buddhas taught the Dharma relying on these two truths. Conventional truth of the world, ultimate truth of meaning. Conventional divided into false and true: false conventional as deluded appearance, true conventional as virtuous action. Ultimate truth as emptiness, nature of phenomena, peaceful and free from elaboration. Framework established for all further analysis.
