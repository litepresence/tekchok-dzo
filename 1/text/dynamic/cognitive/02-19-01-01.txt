[9670-9692]
If immaterial, how known? Movement known? That movement analyzed as contact of moments, directions, three times—not established. Structural recognition: movement impossibility. Register: temporal analysis.

[9693-9715]
If prior movement meets present movement, prior recollection of meeting moment must exist now. If exists, contradicts being prior. Meeting moment ceased is absurd. Structural recognition: temporal contradiction. Register: moment analysis.

[10038-10060]
Through this reversal, no dharmas of deliberate effort on path. Thus, for dharma of nonexistence, since nothing at all, designations of samsara and nirvana merely names—having found nothing in meaning, called measure of liberation. Structural recognition: path resolution. Register: liberation measure.

[10061-10083]
Therefore, since nothing at all in mind as nonexistence, since no reason in mind, not object of sight. Thus fourfold recognition of nonexistence, knowing sixteen dharmic subjects, is destruction of mind's small house. Structural recognition: sightless recognition. Register: comprehensive destruction.

[10084-10106]
Like child's sandcastle being built and destroyed. Like iron destroying iron, or impermanence destroying impermanence, like magician destroying magician's city. Fabrication destroying impermanence like heaping corpse upon corpse. Structural recognition: destruction analogies. Register: metaphorical destruction.

[10107-10129]
Impermanence destroying fabrication like present awareness destroying prior ignorance. Thus, through mind destroying mind, both cease without trace like writing on water. Structural recognition: self-destruction. Register: traceless cessation.

[10130-10152]
Therefore, searching for nonexistence yet finding nothing like poor person searching for wish-fulfilling jewel not in their house, having no place to find it. Structural recognition: search metaphor. Register: futile seeking.

[10153-10175]
For mind as nonexistence, no place to destroy like there being no place to grasp when waves collapse upon water. Structural recognition: water metaphor. Register: wave dissolution.

[10176-10198]
Therefore, without knowing meaning of mindlessness, seeking view, meditation, conduct in mind will never find teachings of Great Bliss Liberation. Like grasping at water when boat sinks. Structural recognition: practice error. Register: drowning metaphor.

[10199-10221]
Taking existence as support in mindlessness itself is deception and binding. Kun tu bzang po thugs kyi me long: holding appearance as dharmakaya is obscuration. Holding whatever appears as mind is obscuration. Desiring other than self-arising is obscuration. Structural recognition: three obscurations. Register: kun tu bzang po citation.

[10222-10244]
One may ask: then is mind dissolving not becoming nonexistent from existent? Dissolving, if analyzed as before, not established. If not analyzed, merely dissolution of adventitious recollective thoughts. Structural recognition: dissolution question. Register: adventitious analysis.

[10245-10267]
Mind never become nonexistent from being existent in own continuum. No cause of dissolution nor condition of dissolution anywhere. Structural recognition: unconditional dissolution. Register: continuum nonexistence.

[10268-10290]
One may object: no need to destroy mind's small house, nothing to destroy. For mind is nonexistent from beginning. Merely realizing nature of nonexistence. Structural recognition: objection response. Register: primordial nonexistence.

[10291-10313]
Not that there exists ground or thing of mind's small house. Source of recollection becomes dharmata. Having made nonexistence understood, conventionally called destroying small house. Destroying existence—nothing at all. Structural recognition: conventional destruction. Register: dharmata source.

[10314-10336]
Therefore, through placing whatever appearing object-point appears as seeming result of convention upon that appearance, without grasping at material appearance, result of non-duality of object and mind. Structural recognition: appearance placement. Register: non-dual appearance.

[10337-10359]
Through placing upon ground of whatever awareness arises, mind's small house self-dissolves—result of awareness-awakening of movement. Structural recognition: awareness placement. Register: self-dissolving house.

[10360-10382]
Thus, having realized ground of dissolution of non-dual wisdom of material-awareness, result of nonexistence. Thus time of three results too is recognition at time of dissolution in four key points of recognition. Structural recognition: result timing. Register: four key points.

[10383-10405]
Know sixteen dharmas of nonexistence as before. Severance of mind's nonexistence, self-awakened, from Great Secret Certainty Heart Essence instructions. Structural recognition: sixteen dharmas knowing. Register: snying thig severance.

[10406-10428]
Knowing movement as adventitiously liberated from beginning. Other instructions say mind ultimately nonexistent, conventionally existent, making view and meditation path of mind—these two merely contradictory in claiming self-liberation, self-arising, self-settling. Structural recognition: instruction comparison. Register: other paths critique.

[10429-10451]
Not ultimately contradictory. Here making nonexistent, there holding existence as nonexistence. Union: there, holding existence as two related to one, desiring such union. Here, since nonexistent from beginning, nothing to unite. Structural recognition: contradiction clarification. Register: ultimate reconciliation.

[10452-10474]
In nature of nonexistence, without partiality of difference, non-dual union called union. This key point supreme among all vehicles, most crucial and essential. Structural recognition: key point supremacy. Register: without partiality.

[10475-10497]
From this, not holding appearance as mind, not experiencing mind as existent taught as great ground-awakening. Relying upon this, recognizing appearance as mind and recognizing mind as emptiness is to be known as Heart Essence intention. Structural recognition: heart essence. Register: snying tig intention.

[10498-10520]
If any instruction appears thus, know as merely provisional, not ultimate—decisively resolved. Third topic: external appearances arising as mirror of awareness, six collections as great equality, vast and pervasive. Structural recognition: provisional distinction. Register: decisive resolution.

[10521-10543]
External various appearances, internal adventitious recollective thoughts, six sense-faculties with objects—all merely clear appearance of nonexistence. Structural recognition: six collections. Register: clear appearance.

[10544-10566]
Without anything existing internally or externally, like hair-faults of one with ophthalmia, like illusion, mirage, optical illusion. Appearing to mind yet transcending extremes of existence and nonexistence from time of appearing. Structural recognition: extreme transcendence. Register: illusion metaphors.

[10567-10589]
However designated from side of appearance, does not contradict. Let it be existent, let it be nonexistent, let it appear, let it be empty, let it be deluded, let it be liberated. Structural recognition: designation freedom. Register: permissive non-contradiction.

[10590-10612]
Let it be good, let it be bad, let it be mind, let it be other. However designated, from side of emptiness, as designated, empty from start. Designation is mind. Mind is nonexistent. Structural recognition: emptiness designation. Register: original emptiness.

[10613-10635]
Without designator for nonexistent, like actions of dream and actions of illusion. Appearance and arising, virtue and nonvirtue—these very things adventitious. Nature groundless, self-dissolves. Structural recognition: adventitious virtue. Register: groundless nature.

[10636-10658]
If realized as existing in dynamic energy of awareness's self-resonance, intention-dharmata does not depend on anything. Great appearance of all phenomenal samsara-nirvana dharmas self-arising and self-appearing as clear appearance of nonexistence in nature of awareness. Structural recognition: self-resonance. Register: dharmata independence.

[10659-10681]
Like appearances of four elements abiding in nature of space. Like dream in sleep. Like cloud in sky—suddenly gathering, without going anywhere, suddenly dissolving. Though nonexistent in sky, appear within it. Structural recognition: sky metaphors. Register: natural appearing.

[10682-10704]
Though conditions and causes nonexistent in mind, appear as appearing. At that time, causes and conditions nonexistent, ascertained as nonexistent through analysis of one, many, three times. Structural recognition: apparent conditions. Register: analytical ascertainment.

[10705-10727]
Thus one and many analysis applied to mind—trilemma structure. Madhyamaka deconstructive methodology. Structural function: establish groundlessness through reasoning. View register: analytical, not assertive. Gcig tha dad distinctions require preservation. Structural recognition: trilemma completion. Register: Madhyamaka methodology.

[10728-10750]
Absurdity consequences must remain sharp. Mind is nonexistent. This is the recognition. Structural recognition: final recognition. Register: decisive knowing.

[10751-10773]
Sixteen dharmas complete. Four recognitions applied to four times. Groundlessness fully established. Liberation through recognition. Structural recognition: comprehensive completion. Register: liberation established.

[10774-10796]
No meditation needed. No practice required. Recognition alone sufficient. Mind self-liberated from beginning. Structural recognition: non-meditation. Register: spontaneous liberation.

[10797-10819]
All practices provisional. All paths conventional. Direct recognition ultimate. Self-arising wisdom alone. Structural recognition: path completion. Register: wisdom supremacy.

[10820-10842]
Therefore, Treasury of Supreme Vehicle, Chapter Nineteen, Section One: Mind is Nonexistent. Recognition complete. Structural recognition: textual closure. Register: section completion.
