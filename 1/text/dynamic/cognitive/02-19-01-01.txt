One and many analysis applied to mind—trilemma structure. Structural function: Madhyamaka deconstructive methodology applied to consciousness. View register: philosophical analysis with scriptural citation. Translation: preserve gcig/tha dad (one/many) distinction, ldog pa (reversal) terminology. Note: the argument that one mind dying implies all dying references standard critique of universal self. Translation risk: the causal trilemma (no cause, has cause, both) requires understanding Madhyamaka reasoning patterns. Preservation: the resolution through rigs gcig tu 'dus (gathering into one family) provides key to understanding Dzogchen non-dual awareness. The dream and cloud analogies (sgyu ma, sprin) illustrate appearing without substantial existence.
