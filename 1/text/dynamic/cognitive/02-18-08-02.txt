Meditation continuation and fruit. Second: extending session length—maintaining meditation without break. Third: practicing day and night continuously—resting in spacious awareness without movement. Fruit: when external space appears, eyes unmoving, awareness merges with space—appearance and awareness become inseparable. Awareness entering dharmakāya: primordial purity—spontaneous presence beyond samsara's three realms. Seeing the fruit: recognizing dharmata directly—the view becomes the fruit. Structural note: connects meditation training to final fruit realization. Register: Dzogchen fruit terminology.
