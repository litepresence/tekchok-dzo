This section establishes the progression of meditation training through three stages: second, enhancing sessions and extending duration; third, practicing day and night without distinction, taking experiences into practice; resting awareness in the sphere-fence without movement. The structural function is to demonstrate how initial recognition is stabilized through systematic extension of practice time and intensity. The verse citation from Sgron Ma 'Bar Ba establishes the method: dbyings kyis rig pa'i rang yul byed, rdo rje nyid ni lu gu rgyud, 'di nyid nang du gzhag par bya. The sphere makes awareness its own object, the vajra is the chain, this itself is to be placed internally. The preservation requirement is to maintain the technical meaning of lu gu rgyud as chain or continuum without reducing it to mere metaphor.

The fruit section establishes the result of meditation practice: when external space appears and eyes do not move at their own time, internally awareness dwells in the base, self-resonance dissolves on its own, and returning, separated from the galloping-horse of the wind, pristine awareness space dissolves into sphere space, liberated as face-equal without distinction. The originally pure awareness, unmoving in the sphere, naturally clear light in the heart center, dwells naturally in the expanse. Such a yogin is called one who has captured the primordial clear light of dharmatā—saṃsāra becomes empty without name, and the three realms are cut like a severed tendon. The extensive verse citation from Thalgyur establishes the complete path: seeing dharmatā directly, knowing through mere seeing, realizing through that knowing, liberating through mere realization—liberation is not untying, like space dissolving into space, naturally without object, without partiality or portions. The structural function is to establish meditation training's direct connection to final fruit realization without intermediate stages.

The progressive enhancement of experiences section divides into brief presentation and extensive explanation. The brief presentation establishes that through gradual training of sphere-awareness, externally in sphere-appearance awareness remains inseparable as chain, and internally in originally pure empty sphere, self-resonance awareness dwells non-dually—clear light mother and child mix, and appearance-experiences increase diversely. The verse citation from Thalgyur describes the process: nyeams kyi snang ba gong 'phel ni, ye shes kha dog phir byung nas, gyen 'greng ba dang rtsibs shar dang, thig le sna tshogs sku nyid du, rags par snang ba'i yul la gsal. The preservation requirement is to maintain the technical specificity of these meditative signs without conflating them with general progress indicators.

[5076-5084]
The extensive explanation establishes that progressive enhancement of experiences has two aspects: cognitive experiences and appearance experiences. Cognitive experiences include worldly cognitive experiences—bliss and clarity obtained through samādhi, mental attachment, desire to sing and dance, and transcendent cognitive experiences—signs of realization of empty-clear without extremes, together with wisdom's power. From the beginning, middle, and end of this, three arise through familiarity: cognitive bliss-experience, final transformation experience, and appearance experience. The structural function is to map the complete trajectory of meditative development, distinguishing between fabricated and natural experiences while establishing their progressive unfolding. The preservation concern involves maintaining the technical distinctions between shes nyams and snang nyams without reducing them to general meditative terminology.
