[9015-9019]
Opening structural enumeration establishing four aspects of elaborated empowerment: external preparation gathering with tooth-stick distribution, internal mandala offering, secret protection cord tying with kusha grass bestowal, fully complete dream examination. The fourfold structure provides systematic mapping of tantric initiatory procedures. View register: empowerment as graduated introduction to recognition, not conferral of external power. Translation risk: elaborate enumeration appearing mechanical rather than organic progression. Preservation: numerical precision establishes systematic completeness.

[9020-9026]
Unelaborated empowerment structure. External: washing ritual, supplication, three vajra callings. Internal: samaya oath-water administering, samsara abandoning oath, nirvana accepting oath, four negating oaths. View register: samaya as continuity of recognition, not mere promise. Translation risk: oath suggesting moralistic commitment rather than recognition-support. Preservation: mna' indicates binding commitment supporting the view.

[9027-9033]
Secret and fully complete components. Secret: samaya and vow bestowal, mandala entering, mind-flower offering. Fully complete: mandala entering, deity face revealing, flower throwing, name empowerment. Very unelaborated extensive coverage traverses nine vehicles through their empowerment procedures. View register: graduated vehicles as progressive refinement leading to Dzogchen. Translation risk: hierarchizing as lower/higher rather than skillful means. Preservation: extensive enumeration demonstrates systematic completeness of vehicle framework.

[9034-9068]
Detailed enumeration of very unelaborated empowerments across vehicles. Shravaka and Pratyekabuddha vehicles establish foundational disciplines with six and five components respectively. Bodhisattva vehicle adds altruistic commitment with four components. Kriya, Upa, and Yoga introduce tantric methods with nine components each, twenty-seven for Upa-Yoga, nine for Yoga. Mahayoga twelve components, Anuyoga six components. Atiyoga represents Dzogchen with four components. View register: all nine as expressions of single intention, different methods for different capacities. Translation risk: reading as historical development or hierarchy of value. Preservation: numerical correspondences demonstrate systematic integration.

[9069-9115]
Complete enumeration summary and progressive elaboration. Mathematical summary: elaborate with elaborate contains sixty-four external empowerments through systematic enumeration. Elaborate without elaborate: sixteen external combining guru and disciple activities, mandala and vase components. Unelaborated structure: washing purification, mandala offerings, scripture transmission, entering mandala, deity introduction, name empowerment. View register: numerical completeness as expression of comprehensive compassion. Translation risk: mathematical precision appearing scholastic rather than practical. Preservation: sixty-four represents completion, thirty corresponds to completion of process.

[9116-9129]
Very unelaborated structure totals. External: sixty-four for elaborate-external, progressing through thirty for secret-complete, establishing comprehensive coverage. Very unelaborated external for Shravaka six, Pratyekabuddha five making eleven, Bodhisattva four making fifteen. Internal: Kriya nine making twenty-four, Upa nine making thirty-three, Yoga nine making forty-two. Secret: Mahayana twelve making fifty-four, Anuyoga six making sixty. Fully complete: Atiyoga four making sixty-four elaborate external empowerments. View register: completeness as expression of enlightened mind's all-inclusiveness. Translation risk: numbers appearing arbitrary or merely organizational. Preservation: sixty-four represents complete mandala structure.

[9130-9164]
Progressive structure from elaborate to essential. Elaborate without elaborate external: guru activities establishing space and transmitting blessing, disciple activities receiving and generating power, mandala and vase as central ritual objects. Unelaborated external: preparation with A training unborn path, accomplishment with A clearing unobstructed flow, gathering with A purifying body speech and mind. Internal: bathing showing purification method, mandala offerings accomplishing desired aims, scripture transmission knowing engagement. Secret and complete: entering mandala introducing rigpa to space, deity face pointing out space-rigpa, name empowerment making buddha-son, prophecy through verses showing nondual experience, breath emission showing unborn recognition, encouragement showing nondual great bliss. View register: progressive refinement from elaborate ritual to essential pointing-out. Translation risk: sound practices appearing mechanical. Preservation: A represents primordial unborn nature.

[9165-9220]
Extremely unelaborated and complete structures. Very unelaborated external: worthy of entering, worthy of obtaining. Internal: certain activity, certain view. Secret: family differentiation, self-abiding. Complete: cause and condition pair. Extremely unelaborated external: mind abiding, speech abiding. Internal: speech transforming, mind obtaining. Secret: bliss prophecy, secret breath emission. Complete: dwelling in emanation, obtaining own activity. View register: ultimate refinement to essential pointing without elaboration. Translation risk: minimal description appearing incomplete. Preservation: numerical reduction represents progressive refinement to essence.

[9221-9289]
Systematic completion and comprehensive summary. Summary totals across all categories: elaborate with elaborate 115, elaborate without elaborate 64, unelaborated 109, very unelaborated 94, extremely unelaborated 30, total 412 empowerments. Alternative enumerations presented: 94 very unelaborated through different counting, variations for unelaborated 109. These indicate different pedagogical frameworks serving different needs. View register: flexibility in enumeration serving different capacities, not contradiction. Translation risk: varying totals appearing as inconsistency. Preservation: different counting systems serve different purposes demonstrating adaptability.

[9290-9350]
Final integration and Dzogchen culmination. Very unelaborated complete empowerment: external nondual experience of knower-known, internal unborn recognition, secret nondual great bliss. Extremely unelaborated: mind abiding, speech abiding transforming, mind obtaining, bliss prophecy, secret breath emission, emanation dwelling, own activity obtaining. All elaborate structures ultimately point to direct recognition without elaboration. Nondual formulas presented: knower-known nondual, unborn recognition free from identification, space-rigpa nondual great bliss. View register: elaboration serves recognition, recognition transcends elaboration. Translation risk: formulas appearing as philosophical positions rather than direct pointers. Preservation: these are recognitions to have, not concepts to understand.

[9351-9450]
Concluding synthesis of empowerment taxonomy. Review of entire structure: elaborated with elaboration as ground, four aspects across all categories. Final integration emphasizing all empowerments serve single purpose of introduction to nature of mind. Multiplicity serving unity, elaboration serving essence. View register: Dzogchen includes and transcends all vehicles, all approaches find their place, all lead to recognition. Translation risk: vast taxonomy appearing as end in itself. Preservation: every empowerment from most elaborate to simplest is introduction to rigpa, numerical multiplicity serves singular purpose of recognition. Complete framework demonstrates Dzogchen's comprehensive compassion refusing to abandon any being, elaborate taxonomy serving those who need it, essence always direct recognition of nature of mind.
