[1902-1906]
Doxographic exposition opening. Erroneous vehicles classification into two main categories: eternalism and nihilism. Text positions itself as orthodox evaluator of non-Buddhist positions. Three hundred sixty views as comprehensive catalog of wrong positions. Structural binary: general nature of extremes first, specific varieties second. Log pa'i theg pa as errant vehicles, not wrong paths. Preserve evaluative stance without modernizing.

[1907-1935]
Eternalist exposition with Sāṃkhya as paradigmatic case. Three constituents—dust, darkness, energy—in equipoise constitute self. Physical description of self as proportionate to body size, from thumb to sesame fragment. Qualities: white, oily, coiled, indestructible, invisible. Presently three poisons, when balanced self-knows through self-cognition. Liberation visualized as white parasol. Technical details require precise rendering: rdul mun pa as dust-darkness, snying stobs as energy, bdag as self not soul. Risk of importing Hindu atman concept; maintain distinct Buddhist critique.

[1936-1942]
Sāṃkhya branching into sub-schools. Scriptural citation from Entry into the Middle Way confirming their position. Varieties based on subtle distinctions. Preserve sense of philosophical proliferation from single root. Citation marks authoritative Buddhist evaluation.

[1943-1957]
Nihilist exposition: Lokāyata position. Denial of past-future lives, karma, cause-effect, liberation. Two types: cause-nihilism and result-nihilism. First type: Carvaka position that consciousness exists naturally in elements, arises adventitiously through heat-moisture conditions, not from past mind. Materialist emergentism. New consciousness enters new body. Risk of conflating with modern materialism; preserve ancient Indian context.

[1958-1985]
Lokayata arguments for consciousness in all matter. Wood, stones, crops possess consciousness evidenced by response to conditions. Specific examples: trees closing leaves at night, bark-stripped withering, regeneration through moisture. Summer heat causing animal transformations as proof of adventitious arising. Refutation of permanent cause through seasonal transformations. Argument structure: observation of natural phenomena interpreted as evidence for consciousness-in-matter. Maintain argumentative flow without endorsing position.

[1986-2010]
Result-nihilism: Kātikas and others. Denial of past lives and consciousness as latent cause. All phenomena self-arisen without cause. Examples: thorns sharp naturally, sun rising naturally, water flowing naturally. Death as complete cessation. Scriptural citation from Maheśvara tantra confirming their view. Risk of reducing to simple hedonism; preserve philosophical sophistication of position.

[2011-2050]
Enumeration of nihilist schools and their variations. Twenty-five varieties of cause-nihilism. Sixteen varieties of result-nihilism. Twenty-four or twenty adherents of nihilism. Four eternalist positions. Comprehensive doxography establishing exhaustive classification. Numbers require precision but need not be taken literally as historical fact. Structural function: demonstrate Buddha's knowledge of all positions.

[2051-2100]
Buddhist refutation of extremes. Neither position tenable. Scriptural citations establishing middle way. Those positions: twenty-five, sixteen, six, four—all enumerated for recognition of extremes. Root text citation from Praise of Dharmadhātu. Dharmakārti verse refuting both extremes. Purpose: establish Buddha as omniscient through comprehensive knowledge of wrong views. Translate citations with majestic cadence appropriate to authority claims.

[2101-2200]
Enumeration of eternalist varieties continued. Four main eternalist positions with specific names: self as all-pervading creator, self as all-pervading non-creator, self as all-pervading partless particle, self as all-pervading knowing subject. Each with specific scriptural support. Additional sixty-two views from Brahmajalasutta. Seventy-four including non-Buddhist. Eighty including Sāṃkhya-Lokayata. Five hundred from Mu stegs kyi go rim. Comprehensive enumeration demonstrating exhaustive classification. Preserve specificity of categories without getting lost in lists.

[2201-2300]
Final enumeration and transition. Three hundred sixty wrong views from men, men, men positions. Four views asserting self same as aggregates. Four asserting different. Fourteen from Sāṃkhyas. Sixteen nihilist. Ten combining both. Twenty-five cause-nihilist. Twenty-four result-nihilist. Twenty-five plus sixteen equals forty-one. Plus fourteen eternalist. Plus six nihilist. Plus four same-different. Plus twenty-four equals ninety-five. Plus seventy-four equals one hundred sixty-nine. Plus five hundred equals six hundred sixty-nine. Exhaustive enumeration culminates in praise of Buddha's omniscience. Structural function complete: establish comprehensive knowledge as prerequisite for teaching.

[2301-2376]
Transition to Buddhist vehicles. Non-erroneous vehicles: three or ninefold classification. From Buddha's word, Bodhisattva commentaries, treatises, root tantras, explanatory tantras, instruction manuals. Nine vehicles: śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, bodhisattva, kriyā, caryā, yoga, mahā, anu, ati. Causal three: śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, bodhisattva practicing causes of buddhahood. Resultant six: tantric vehicles. Atiyoga as supreme. Enumeration establishes hierarchy culminating in Dzogchen. Preserve ninefold structure as Nyingma classification system.

[2377-2538]
Detailed exposition of śrāvakayāna. Definition: wisdom arisen in accord with nature realizing all as primordially abiding through reasoning that examines. Ultimate truth as negation of arising. Conventional as accordant purpose. Person selflessness. Two divisions: Sautrāntika and Vaibhāṣika. Sautrāntika: coarse conventional as collection-appearance, ultimate as partless atom instant. Person selflessness asserted, dhātu selflessness as atom-instant exists. Four truths, twelve links, four applications, four abandonments, four bases of miraculous power, five faculties, five powers, seven limbs, eightfold path. Thirty-seven factors. Detailed enumeration requires technical precision. Risk of losing forest for trees; maintain sense of comprehensive path structure.
