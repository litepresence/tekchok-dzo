[1902-1906]
Doxographic exposition opens with classification of erroneous vehicles (log pa'i theg pa). The text establishes a comprehensive framework for evaluating all philosophical positions through the enumeration of 360 views (lta ba sum brgya drug cu). This binary structure divides into eternalism (rtag pa) and nihilism (chad pa) as the two fundamental extremes. The evaluative stance of the text positions itself as orthodox Buddhist doxography, not through polemical attack but through systematic presentation. The enumeration serves a pedagogical function: by understanding wrong views thoroughly, the correct view becomes apparent. Translation must preserve the evaluative stance without modernizing or dismissing the philosophical positions as mere historical curiosities.

[1907-1935]
Eternalist exposition presents Sāṃkhya (grangs can pa) as the paradigmatic case of permanent self theory. Three constituents form the basis of their system: dust (rdul), darkness (mun pa), and energy (snying stobs). When these three exist in equipoise, they constitute the self (bdag). The physical description presents the self as proportionate to body size, ranging from thumb-sized in larger beings to sesame-fragment-sized in smaller beings. The qualities attributed to this self include whiteness (dkar pa), oiliness (snum pa), coiled nature ('dril ba), indestructibility (gzhig cing gzhom du med), and invisibility (sus kyang mi mthong). The present state involves three poisons (desire, hatred, delusion); when these achieve balance, the self knows itself through self-cognition. Liberation is visualized as a white parasol (gdugs dkar po) surrounded on all sides. Technical terminology requires precision: rdul mun pa represents dust-darkness as inertia, snying stobs represents energy or vital force, and bdag represents the permanent self distinct from the Buddhist no-self doctrine. Risk of conflation with Hindu atman concepts requires maintaining the distinct Buddhist critique.

[1936-1942]
Sāṃkhya branches into numerous sub-schools through subtle interpretive distinctions. Scriptural citation from Madhyamakāvatāra (dbu ma la 'jug pa) confirms their fundamental position while acknowledging the proliferation of views. The citation marks authoritative Buddhist evaluation of their system. Varieties emerge based on subtle distinctions in their understanding of the three constituents and their relationship to the self. The sense of philosophical proliferation from a single root position requires preservation in translation.

[1943-1957]
Nihilist exposition presents Lokāyata (rgyang 'phan pa) as the denial of all transcendent phenomena. Their position negates past and future lives, karma, cause and effect relationships, and liberation. Two main types emerge: cause-nihilism (rgyu chad) and result-nihilism ('bras bu chad). The first type represents the Carvaka position that consciousness exists naturally within the four elements, arising adventitiously through the conditions of heat and moisture rather than from past mental continuity. This represents materialist emergentism: new consciousness enters new bodies without previous mental cause. The risk of conflating this with modern materialism requires preservation of its ancient Indian philosophical context.

[1958-1972]
Lokāyata arguments for consciousness-in-matter proceed through observation of natural phenomena. Wood, stones, and crops possess consciousness evidenced by their responses to environmental conditions. Trees closing their leaves at night, bark-stripped wood withering, and regeneration through moisture all serve as evidence. Summer heat causing the transformation of insects into bees demonstrates adventitious arising. The argument structure observes natural phenomena and interprets them as evidence for consciousness existing in all matter. The refutation of permanent cause emerges through observation of seasonal transformations.

[1973-1985]
The seasonal transformation argument proceeds through specific examples. During summer, when heat and moisture combine, wooden materials in ant nests transform into ants, grains produce worms, and frog eggs develop into tadpoles. These observations demonstrate that causes are adventitious rather than permanent. Winter conditions do not produce such transformations, proving that the cause is not inherent but dependent on temporary conditions. Good causes produce good results, like a beautiful queen producing attractive offspring. This demonstrates their understanding of conditional causation while denying the permanence of causes.

[1986-2010]
Result-nihilism (Kātikas and others) denies both past lives and consciousness as latent cause. All phenomena arise through self-nature without cause. Examples from nature support this view: thorns are sharp naturally without a maker sharpening them, the sun rises without being caused to rise, water flows downward without being directed. Death represents complete cessation without continuation. Scriptural citation from Maheśvara tantra confirms their position. The risk of reducing this to simple hedonism requires preserving its philosophical sophistication as a complete metaphysical system.

[2011-2032]
The four Tīrthika positions representing extreme views include: self as all-pervading creator, self as all-pervading non-creator, self as all-pervading partless particle, and self as all-pervading knowing subject. Each position has specific scriptural support and represents a different articulation of the eternalist extreme. These four positions demonstrate the range of views within the eternalist camp, showing that eternalism is not a monolithic position but contains significant internal variation.

[2033-2050]
Enumeration of the sixty-two wrong views from the Brahmajalasutta provides exhaustive classification. Additional views bring the total to seventy-four including non-Buddhist positions, eighty including Sāṃkhya-Lokāyata distinctions, and five hundred from the Mu stegs kyi go rim. These comprehensive enumerations demonstrate the Buddha's omniscience through knowledge of all possible positions. The numbers function structurally rather than historically; they establish comprehensive knowledge, not specific historical claims.

[2051-2100]
Buddhist refutation of both extremes establishes the middle way. Scriptural citations from Dharmadhātustotra (chos dbyings bstod pa) and Dharmakārti demonstrate the untenability of both positions. The twenty-five cause-nihilist views, sixteen result-nihilist views, six combined views, four same-different views—all enumerated for recognition as extremes rather than as historical facts. The purpose is establishing Buddha's omniscience through comprehensive knowledge of wrong views. Translation of citations requires majestic cadence appropriate to authority claims.

[2101-2200]
Further enumeration extends to ninety-five, then one hundred sixty-nine, then six hundred sixty-nine views. This exhaustive enumeration culminates in praise of Buddha's omniscience. The structural function is complete: establishing comprehensive knowledge as prerequisite for teaching. The view throughout is that the Buddha's omniscience encompasses knowledge of all positions, allowing him to establish the correct middle way that transcends both eternalism and nihilism.

[2201-2300]
Transition to Buddhist vehicles marks the shift from refutation to exposition. Non-erroneous vehicles are classified as threefold or ninefold. The three causal vehicles (śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, bodhisattva) practice the causes of buddhahood. The six resultant vehicles (tantric) are Kriyā, Caryā, Yoga, Mahāyoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga. Atiyoga (Dzogchen) is presented as supreme. The ninefold structure represents Nyingma classification system, establishing hierarchy culminating in Dzogchen.

[2301-2400]
Detailed exposition of śrāvakayāna presents its definition: wisdom arising in accord with nature, realizing all as primordially abiding through reasoning that examines. Ultimate truth (don dam bden pa) as negation of arising, conventional (kun rdzob bden pa) as accordant purpose. Person selflessness (gang zag bdag med) is asserted, dhātu selflessness is denied—atom-instant exists as truly established. The four truths, twelve links, four applications of mindfulness, four abandonments, four bases of miraculous power, five faculties, five powers, seven limbs of enlightenment, and eightfold path constitute the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment.

[2401-2538]
The complete doxographic framework moves from non-Buddhist eternalism and nihilism through detailed enumeration of wrong views to the Buddhist refutation and the nine vehicle classification. The detailed enumeration of Abhidharma categories requires technical precision. The translator must preserve the systematic philosophy while conveying that this is not mere polemic but comprehensive knowledge demonstration. The final section establishes the hierarchy of vehicles with Atiyoga as supreme, completing the structural arc from lowest wrong view to highest correct view.
