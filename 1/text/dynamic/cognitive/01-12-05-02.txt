Third gathering: water wind water-yellow impure purify, water earth blood flesh pure impure. Water fire water-block gather separate, water water saliva eye-water move not-move. Earth earth flesh produce, that fat, bone, marrow, bodhicitta sequence five. Earth water bindu work, mercury piece became child not-arise, rta-rnga knot daughter, eye-corner small son ripen. Earth fire heat produce, that vessel, object, rise-fall, birth aging disease death four. Earth wind strength complexion, movement, paralysis etc. Risk: element correlations represent period somatic theory.

Month waxing second third menstruation stain-not flow boy develop, month center fifteen flow girl develop, waning always flow boy girl mixed. Risk: physiological descriptions are period-specific.

Elements four birth sequence: summer winter autumn spring action change, element row transfer, disease, fever, death. Body speech mind actions distinction show. Past life long change clear located change definite, future life long transfer clear moved located definite, present short expel action calculate change know. Day-one session eight, session thirty-two, digit sixty-four, transfer sixteen, transfer each wind thousand three-hundred fifty. Risk: temporal-element-wind calculations are systematic—preserve exact enumeration.

The third gathering presents the relationship between elements in the subtle body system.
Water element interactions with wind, earth, and fire create various bodily substances.
The purification process transforms impure substances into pure wisdom elements.
Earth element produces flesh, fat, bone, marrow, and bodhicitta in sequence.
Fire element produces heat, vessels, and the cycle of birth, aging, sickness, and death.
Wind element produces strength, complexion, movement, and various bodily functions.
The element correlations represent traditional somatic theory, not modern physiology.
Temporal-element-wind calculations provide systematic framework for understanding bodily processes.
Translator must preserve exact enumeration while understanding historical context.
The subtle body system provides the energetic framework for Dzogchen practice.
Understanding element interactions is essential for completion phase practice.
The correlations between elements and bodily functions guide meditation.
Men and women have different energetic patterns requiring different approaches.
Seasonal and temporal factors influence elemental balance.
The calculations provide precise timing for practice.

The subtle body system presented here provides the energetic map for completion phase practice. The five elements interact in specific ways to produce bodily constituents and functions. Understanding these interactions allows the practitioner to work with the subtle body effectively. The water element section shows how purification transforms impure substances into pure wisdom elements. The fire element section demonstrates the role of heat in bodily processes. The wind element section reveals the dynamics of movement and vitality. Together these form a comprehensive system of subtle body physiology that supports advanced meditation practice.
