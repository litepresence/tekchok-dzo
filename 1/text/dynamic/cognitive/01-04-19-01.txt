[3994-4004]
Structural function establishes the threefold natural state through essence, nature, and marks as the foundation for understanding delusion-never-experienced, non-abiding in delusion, and impossibility of future delusion. The progression creates temporal logic showing the ground nature transcends three times while remaining basis for samsara and nirvana.

View register operates within Dzogchen / Natural State / Timeless Awareness. Key terms include "'khrul pa" (delusion), "rang byung ye shes" (self-arising wisdom), "khams gsum dong sprugs" (shaking three realms to their foundation). The ground nature is never stained by delusion in past, does not dwell in delusion in present, and will not experience delusion in future, yet remains basis for both samsara and nirvana without duality.

Translation risks include misrepresenting "'khrul pa" as mere confusion rather than fundamental delusion creating samsara, and rendering "rang byung ye shes" without capturing its technical meaning as wisdom arising spontaneously without causes or conditions. The phrase "khams gsum dong sprugs" specifically means shaking three realms to their foundation, not merely purifying them.

Preservation priorities maintain distinction between three aspects (essence, nature, marks) and temporal structure of past-never-experienced, present-non-abiding, future-impossible. The non-dual nature of samsara and nirvana sharing single ground must remain clear.

Extended recognition: The term "thig le rang gnas" (thigle self-abiding) represents bindu remaining in its own place without movement, the indecomposable nature of awareness. "Spra bral" and "spros pa dang bral ba" indicate ineffable nature transcending conceptual designation.

[4005-4014]
Structural function introduces thigle self-abiding nature through freedom from elaborations and beyond words, establishing direct introduction producing decisive confidence. Presents oral transmission (snyan rgyud) as means transmitting nature of reality from master to student without interruption.

View register operates within Dzogchen / Oral Transmission / Direct Introduction. Oral transmission characterized by uninterrupted continuity, proximity of distinction, connection to auditory sense power, and freedom from obstruction by others. Letterless oral transmission of dharmatā meaning oral instructions represents highest form transcending verbal expression while still functioning as transmission.

Translation risks include conflating "snyan rgyud" with ordinary oral instruction when it specifically refers to unbroken lineage of direct mind-to-mind transmission. The distinction between "yi ge dang bcas pa" and "yi ge med pa" must be preserved as technical taxonomy.

Preservation priorities maintain hierarchy of transmission methods, with letterless oral transmission of dharmatā meaning oral instructions representing pinnacle. Simultaneity of factors—unobstructed connection to auditory sense power, freedom from interruption, decisive confidence with liberation—must be presented as structural features of authentic oral transmission.

Extended recognition: Oral transmission represents one of three main Dzogchen lineages alongside mind transmission and sign transmission. The emphasis on continuity reflects understanding that realization must be transmitted through unbroken lineage to retain its power.

[4015-4039]
Structural function introduces explanatory transmission through four cycles: outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassed secret. Each cycle presented through essence, nature, and marks, creating systematic presentation of progressively subtle teachings. Outer cycle establishes five poisons as path without abandonment; inner cycle presents non-material nature of dharmatā; secret cycle introduces simultaneity of recognition and attainment; unsurpassed secret cycle reveals non-reliance on words and direct perception.

View register operates within Dzogchen / Four Cycles / Progressive Revelation. Outer cycle transforms five poisons into path without requiring abandonment, reflecting essential Dzogchen view that afflictive emotions are wisdom when recognized. Secret cycle presents three simultaneities: recognition and attainment occurring simultaneously, breath cessation and buddhahood occurring simultaneously, buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneously.

Translation risks include rendering four cycles as merely hierarchical rather than structurally distinct pedagogical approaches. The phrase "dug lnga lam khyer la gnas" requires careful handling to avoid suggesting antinomian practices without proper view. Three simultaneities must be preserved as technical statements about nature of realization.

Preservation priorities maintain systematic presentation of four cycles and respective characteristics. Three simultaneities in secret cycle—ngo sprad pa dang rtogs pa thob pa dus mnyam pa, dbugs chad pa dang sangs rgyas pa dus mnyam pa, sangs rgyas pa dang thugs rje 'byung ba dus mnyam pa—represent crucial technical formulations.

Extended recognition: Three simultaneities reflect Dzogchen understanding that realization is not gradual process but occurs instantaneously when proper conditions present. Simultaneity of breath cessation and buddhahood refers to moment when conceptual mind ceases and non-conceptual wisdom arises.

[4040-4059]
Structural function concludes unsurpassed secret cycle through non-reliance on words, direct perception, and four visions reaching their measure. Transitions to summary enumeration of Dzogchen textual corpus: nine expanses, twenty-one thousand chapters, three sections, thirty-five thousand chapters, eight great insertions, one hundred eighty nails, one thousand five hundred obstacles, seven thousand distinctions, one hundred fifty thousand cycles, five thousand essential points, sixty-four thousand ślokas, twenty thousand named tantras.

View register operates within Dzogchen / Four Visions / Textual Corpus. Unsurpassed secret cycle establishes complete reliance on wisdom means not abiding in view holding to intellectual examination. Four visions reaching their measure without depending on fruition reflects Dzogchen view that fruition is not something to be achieved in future but already present.

Translation risks include conflating "mngon sum du mthong" with ordinary direct perception when it specifically refers to direct recognition of natural state without conceptual mediation. Enumeration terms must be preserved as technical bibliographic categories rather than rendered as generic terms.

Preservation priorities maintain distinction between unsurpassed secret cycle and lower cycles, particularly regarding non-reliance on words and direct perception. Four visions reaching their measure must be preserved as technical description of completion of Dzogchen practice.

Extended recognition: Four visions represent progressive stages of thögal practice: direct realization of dharmakāya, experience of increased vision, reaching full measure of awareness, exhaustion of phenomena into reality.

[4060-4085]
Structural function presents summary citation from Thal 'gyur tantra establishing all enumerated teachings emerge from Great Perfection of natural state. Verse summarizes textual organization: from three sections come nine expanses, from condensed words come thirty-four thousand ślokas, from which emerge thirty-five thousand chapters, twenty-one thousand bam po, subjects equal to extent of space. Synthesizes into three sections: sems sde, klong sde, and man ngag sde, with sems sde subdivided into three expanses.

View register operates within Dzogchen / Three Sections / Nine Expanses. Three expanses of sems sde: expanse of dharmatā being ineffable, expanse of view having no existence-nonexistence, expanse of conduct having no existence-nonexistence. These establish radical non-duality of Dzogchen view and practice.

Translation risks include misinterpreting "bam po" and "'phyong" as mere literary divisions rather than technical bibliographic categories. Three expanses must be preserved as technical terms describing ineffable nature of dharmatā and non-duality of existence and nonexistence.

Preservation priorities maintain authority of Thal 'gyur citation and three-section organizational framework. Three expanses represent crucial doctrinal formulation establishing ineffability of dharmatā, non-duality of view, non-duality of conduct.

Extended recognition: Thal 'gyur is one of seventeen tantras of man ngag sde, key canonical source for Dzogchen. Three sections represent historical organization into distinct lineages: sems sde focusing on nature of mind, klong sde on expanse/space dimension, man ngag sde on practical oral instructions.

[4086-4121]
Structural function synthesizes textual categories of three sections into condensed summaries with precise numerical correspondences. Sems sde enumeration shows condensation from five thousand named tantras through progressive reduction. Klong sde enumeration shows condensation from three thousand named tantras, with three insertions: liberation through action, liberation through resting, bare liberation.

View register operates within Dzogchen / Textual Condensation / Numerical Correspondences. Enumeration represents traditional ways of organizing vast Dzogchen literature. Three insertions in klong sde represent three approaches to liberation corresponding to different capacities of practitioners.

Translation risks include rendering enumeration as merely symbolic rather than preserving technical precision of numerical correspondences. Terms "shan 'byed", "gags", "gnad", "gzer bu", "'phyong" must be preserved as technical bibliographic categories.

Preservation priorities maintain precise numerical relationships between different levels of condensation. Three types of liberation—through action, resting, bare—must be preserved as distinct categories.

Extended recognition: Three types of liberation represent three approaches corresponding to gradual, spontaneous, and instantaneous capacities of practitioners.

[4122-4154]
Structural function completes enumeration with man ngag sde, subdivided into three expanses: expanse of display ceasing without interruption, expanse of mind not liberating through intellect, expanse of essence without good or bad. Enumeration continues with twelve thousand named tantras through progressive condensation to three insertions: expansion of essential points, seeing essential points, knowing essential points. Concludes categorizing all as both canonical teachings and treatises, with treatises subdivided into tantras, scriptures, and oral instruction treatises.

View register operates within Dzogchen / Oral Instruction Section / Three Expanses. Three expanses represent most subtle teachings: display without cessation reflects continuous nature of manifestation; non-liberation through intellect indicates realization transcends conceptual mind; essence without good or bad establishes absolute equality of natural state.

Translation risks include conflating three expanses of man ngag sde with those of sems sde when they represent distinct formulations. The phrase "blo la ma grol ba med pa'i klong" must indicate there is no liberation through intellect, not that mind is unliberated.

Preservation priorities maintain distinct characteristics of man ngag sde and its three expanses. Three insertions—gnad spro ba, gnad mthong ba, gnad shes—must be distinguished from three insertions of klong sde.

Extended recognition: Man ngag sde represents most extensive section of Dzogchen teachings containing practical instructions for realization. Three expanses reflect unique characteristics: uninterrupted nature of display, transcendence of intellectual liberation, absolute equality of essence.

[4155-4171]
Structural function transitions to next major section on nature of tantra, establishing six topics: essence of tantra, definitive terminology, classification, extent of arising, examples, and establishment of validity. Begins systematic analysis of tantra as vehicle for teachings, establishing tantra as that which causes beings to be born in whichever class or family they belong to, with definitive etymology explaining "rgyud" as continuity that is decisive and uninterrupted.

View register operates within Dzogchen / Tantra / Definitive Characteristics. Sixfold presentation follows standard Buddhist scholastic methods. Etymology of rgyud as that which causes birth in specific families and as decisive uninterrupted continuity establishes both soteriological function and structural characteristic of tantra. Classification into natural/essential tantra and textual tantra begins the typology.

Translation risks include rendering "rgyud" merely as "tantra" without preserving etymological meanings of continuity and causation of birth in families. Distinction between "rang bzhin don gyi rgyud" and textual tantras must be preserved as fundamental classification.

Preservation priorities maintain sixfold structure and specific etymological derivations. Definition of tantra as both that which causes birth in families and as decisive uninterrupted continuity must be preserved as two aspects of single definition.

Extended recognition: Distinction between natural tantra and textual tantra parallels distinction between natural nirvana and attained nirvana. Natural tantra refers to continuity of awareness itself, while textual tantras are teachings that reveal this continuity.
