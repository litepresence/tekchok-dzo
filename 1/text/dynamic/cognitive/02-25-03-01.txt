[16360-16408]
Path appearance in Dzogchen. Path-appearance: great treasury of spontaneous presence's primordial purity—meaningful fruition like a house—one enters and emerges again; from primordial purity must manifest as external display. Manifestation arises from essence abiding as kaya. Two types: path of making oneself Buddha preceding fruition; path of guiding those to be trained, having made oneself Buddha, kayas manifesting for benefit. Here considered path-appearance of no-more-learning—meaning wherein two are non-contradictory: three kayas as path-appearance and fruition. Result two, contradictory yet relationship established—liberated Dharmakaya's three kayas manifesting externally as path from inner Expanse—emanations of kayas and wisdoms. Dharmakaya as wisdom-mind, Sambhogakaya as that very kaya, Emanation appearing as deeds for benefit. Single awareness-display, self-appearance not seen by those to be trained, yet what manifests from it is seen—distinguishing between two similars. Structural note: Dzogchen understanding of how buddhahood manifests for benefit of beings.
