[11825-12002]
Signs of birth in hell realms. At death: sky gathers black clouds, darkness spreading, rain, mist, great wind, hail, dust-whirlwinds swirl—taking birth in eight hot hells, eight cold hells, intermittent hells, neighboring hells, Avīci, seven vajra hells. Last two included in eight hot but distinguished due to long lifespan and great suffering. Karma of immediate actions—all who take birth in last hot hell dwell one intermediate kalpa; those who abandoned Dharma remain billions of kalpas—called Unbearable Sentient-Being Hell. Breaking samaya with vajra guru produces long lifespans and great suffering. Structural note: Buddhist hell realm taxonomy for recognizing negative outcomes.
