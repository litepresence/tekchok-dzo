[1638-1648]
Pacifying activity in being-time. The exposition establishes rang gi tsitta dkyil na gnas as the location of zhi ba'i gdangs. The four qualities—'jam, 'dril, dkar, 'od zer 'phro—map onto the activity's manifest characteristics. The verse quotation from rang shar maintains source authority. The structural function is grounding emanation-activity in subtle-body geography without reifying the body as mere physical form. The dkyil 'khor terminology preserves the mandala architecture. Risk: translation must avoid literalizing the heart-center as anatomical location while maintaining the precise technical reference.

[1649-1662]
Enriching activity in being-time. The 'od gsal 'gyur med kyi rtsa snying na establishes the changeless light-root as the basis. The fivefold expansion pattern—'od lnga, sku lnga, rig pa sku'i klong, sku rnams ye shes klong, 'od rnams zer gyi klong—establishes comprehensive radiance. The verse quotation maintains the klong terminology that characterizes Dzogchen spatial metaphors. The structural density requires recognition of each expansion-dimension as distinct yet inseparable. Risk: the enumeration could be collapsed into general radiance; preservation requires maintaining the specific expansion-vectors.

[1663-1693]
Powerful activity in being-time. The dung khang nas g.yas su 'khyil ba'i rtsa 'dab las mig tu zug pa'i nang nas sgron ma bzhi snang ba establishes the four lamps as the ground of dbang gi dkyil 'khor. The detailed correspondence—rgyang zhags kyis mngon sum dang 'od gsal gnyis, dbyings kyis gong 'phel dang ye shes bzhi sbyor, thig les tshad phebs dang zung 'jug tshom bu'i snang ba, shes rab kyis zad pa dang lhun grub kyi snang ba—maps four empowerments onto four recognitions. The verse exposition from rang shar maintains authoritative grounding. Risk: the complexity of lamp-empowerment correspondence requires precise technical translation.

[1694-1709]
Fierce activity in being-time. The rig pa'i gdangs las sems kyi 'phro 'du rtogs tshogs nyon mong dang bcas pa establishes the thought-aggregate as the ground of fierce activity. The structural insight that ma rtogs na 'khor ba rang ka ma 'khor ba'i 'khrul snang skyed and rtogs na rtogs pa'i rtsal sbyong du 'char establishes the recognition-transformation dynamic. The verse quotation maintains the dbang po'i sgo dag terminology. Risk: fierce activity could be read as aggressive; preservation requires recognizing the energetic-unobstructed quality without negative affect.

[1710-1737]
Four bardo appearances corresponding to four activities. Zhi ba through bar do dang po 'od gsal las tshom bu'i snang ba shar ba establishes the sphere-appearance of first bardo as pacifying. Rgyas pa through bar do gnyis pa ye shes bzhi sbyor gyi snang ba establishes the four-wisdom preparation of second bardo as enriching. Dbang through bar do gsum pa lhun grub rin po che'i sgo brgyad establishes the eight-gates of third bardo as powerful. Drag po through ka dag gi sa la gtan srid zin pa bar do bzhi pa'i ye shes dbyings su 'khyil ba establishes the fourth bardo wisdom-expanse dissolution as fierce. The verse exposition from rang shar maintains the lam du rdzogs lugs structure.

[1738-1753]
Concluding affirmation of self-completion. The text establishes skudang ye shes 'phrin las thams cad ye nas rang la tshang bas as the ground, rdzogs pa chen po rtsol sgrub las 'das pa as the path-characteristic, and bya bral lhun gyis grub pa'i ngang du glod pa tsam gyis byang chub tshe 'dir thob pa as the fruition. The structural function is synthesis and conclusion, gathering the entire kaya-wisdom-activity framework into single recognition. The sgyu 'phrul gsang snying citation grounds the conclusion in canonical source. Risk: the comprehensive claim could read as exclusivism; preservation requires recognizing the self-liberation structure as description, not polemic.
