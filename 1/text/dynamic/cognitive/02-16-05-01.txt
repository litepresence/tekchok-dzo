[1-50]
Enlightened activities in being-time: pacifying (white radiance in heart), enriching (light-body expansion), powerful (four appearances gather power), fierce (emanation-gathering through sense gates). View register: tantric transformation practice. Risk: "four appearances" as technical term requires definition.

[51-100]
Powerful enlightened activity through four lamps: expanse-rigpa, emptiness-bindu, self-arisen wisdom, far-reaching-lasso. Structural function: establishing yogic apparatus. Risk: lamp terminology critical.

[101-117]
Four bardo appearances corresponding to four activities: sphere-appearance (pacifying), wisdom-link (enriching), spontaneously accomplished eight-gates (powerful), self-appearance liberated (fierce). Concluding affirmation of self-completion. Note: source includes mixed Tibetan.
