[1582-1600]
Abhidharma exposition of three gates: aggregates, sense-bases, elements. Three realms explained through consciousness origination. Form realm with spatial distinctions above-below. Desire realm with five objects, afflictions arising from alaya as all-seed mind. Eight consciousnesses with various concepts. Formless realm fourfold: infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothing-at-all, neither perception nor non-perception. Each arising from previous as gathering and aspect.

[1601-1660]
Dharmakāya level: five wisdoms as spontaneously arisen clear light, awareness-emptiness inseparable. Sambhogakāya level: five families as appearance aspects, buddha field enjoyments, self-awareness object non-dual. Nirmāṇakāya level: six sense-bases as various concepts, object-subject grasping, habit beings. Samsara arising from self-awareness aspect clear, from alaya mind only six consciousnesses. Preserve Abhidharma framework without importing Yogācāra interpretation.

[1661-1670]
Six consciousnesses enumeration: eye consciousness holding name and color, ear accomplishing grasping, nose grasping others, tongue experiencing objects, body consciousness gathering all objects, mind consciousness pervading all existent and non-existent. Each with specific function in perception process. Standard Abhidharma analysis. Technical precision required for rnam par shes pa renderings.

[1582-1582]
Two types of aggregates: worldly and transcendent. Worldly: form, feeling, recognition, formation, consciousness—grasped, afflictive. Transcendent: thought-free aggregates abiding in self-knowing aspect of aryas beyond world. Samatha-vipasyana nature as samādhi aggregate. Liberated from own afflictions as wisdom aggregate. Seeing own-common nature as discerning aggregate. Ethics aggregate for purifying stains. Liberation aggregate beyond conceptualization. Path-related qualities transforming ordinary aggregates into transcendent.

[1582-1582]
Sense-bases exposition: what arises and expands from what. Six objects like form for eye. Twelve sense-bases: six internal, six external. Arising and expanding from mutual dependence. Eye sense-base arises from form, form from eye, consciousness from both. Not sequential but simultaneous dependent origination. Dharmadhātu as basis of all. Five elements as support: earth-solid, water-moist, fire-hot, wind-moving, space-accommodating. Not analysis into parts but recognition of interdependence.

[1582-1582]
Detailed faculty analysis: sense faculties and wisdom faculties. Eleven form faculties: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, plus five subtle sense faculties and life faculty. Five faculties of those who are learning and those beyond learning: faith, effort, mindfulness, samādhi, wisdom. Five faculties of those who are not learning: faith through wisdom similarly. Preserve Abhidharma classification system without reduction to psychology.
