The clear-light four-times equal-application section opens as the fourth and final method for luminosity practice, building systematically on three previous approaches. The structural function introduces the culminating practice method, establishing the complete mandala of clear-light training. The view register presents Dzogchen clear-light ('od gsal) as foundational ground nature, not as produced state or achieved condition. Translation risk: this could be conflated with lower tantra clear-light practices focused on stage achievement, or treated as a yogic state to produce rather than recognition of ever-present nature. Preservation priority: the four-time structure (dus bzhi)—external, internal, secret, suchness—establishes a complete mandala covering all temporal conditions without exception, demonstrating how clear-light recognition operates across the full spectrum of experience.

The root text citation establishes the comprehensive framework through verse structure covering yogi's physical training, verbal training, mental training, and integration. External time: four aspects training body's capacity, channels as source held as essential point. Internal time: four aspects training speech's capacity, cutting through verbal elaborations. Secret time: four aspects training mind's capacity, resting uncontrived mind in natural state. Suchness time: four aspects integrating body-speech-mind, mixing clear-light with sleep. The structural function presents concise encapsulation of complete path through four dimensions. The view register presents these as recognition supports, not progressive stages. Translation risk: the verse's brevity can obscure extensive practices it references, suggesting simpler method than actual content. Preservation: the citation structure—root verse followed by detailed exposition—follows standard Tibetan pedagogical form. The four key points (daytime, dusk, midnight, dawn) provide temporal structure organizing practice across the full day-night cycle.

Daytime practice integrates samadhi and post-meditation with sleep yoga as continuous clear-light recognition. Lion-posture (seng ge'i nyal lugs) provides specific physical configuration: lying on right side, left hand supporting cheek, legs crossed in vajra position. Holding awareness on five-light sphere within heart center while external appearances gradually diminish, recognition of thought-free clarity emerges at the threshold between waking and sleep. Sleep itself becomes clear-light display without dream content—awareness abides in samadhi's nature, self-luminous. If awareness enters sleep, nearby forms-sounds-smells continue perceived without interruption; if awareness does not enter sleep entirely, conditions cause emergence from that state. Daytime appearances merely represent conceptual cessation while appearance-essence remains luminously present. The structural function provides detailed exposition of primary practice period demonstrating waking-sleep continuity. The view register presents integration of waking and sleeping states as seamless clear-light continuity, not separate practices. Translation risk: treating sleep yoga as separate practice from daytime recognition misses their identity; or treating sleep as merely another state to observe rather than clear-light display itself. Preservation requires maintaining precise phenomenological threshold: six-collection conceptual consciousness ceases while five-gate consciousnesses remain clear—this distinction establishes the exact recognition point.

Three types of clear-light recognition provide analytical framework for what is actually unified recognition: bliss-clear-light, clarity-clear-light, non-conceptual-clear-light. These are pedagogical differentiations of the non-dual ground, not separate experiences to achieve. Bliss-clear-light: arises from blissful equipoise, coemergent joy, cannot be separated from samadhi, produces joy-bliss perception. Clarity-clear-light: produces smoke, mirage, fireflies, clouds, lightning, blazing, moon, eclipse, dark jewel forms, five-light appearances, bindus, deity forms, beings, pure lands, perception through coarse obstructions like walls and fences, clairvoyances. Non-conceptual-clear-light: samadhi-day-night indistinguishable, whatever appears meets thought-free spaciousness, whatever topic meets effortless thought-free flow, abiding continuously in sky-like expanse, immeasurable experiences. The structural function provides analytical differentiation of unified recognition. The view register presents pedagogical distinction of non-dual ground for recognition support. Translation risk: reifying the three as separate experiences rather than aspects of single recognition; or treating signs (smoke, mirage, etc.) as goals rather than natural recognition markers. Preservation: the signs of clarity-clear-light are standard Indian and Tibetan meditative phenomenology—these must be preserved as technical terms without reduction to metaphor or psychology.

Post-meditation integration establishes continuity between formal practice and daily activity without separation. Rising from samadhi, external appearances are viewed as five-light forms, beings and elements as illusion, eight similes of illusion, sky-simile—whatever experience arises, integrated with emptiness-clarity appearance without fixation, unified evenly. The structural function establishes continuity between formal practice and daily activity. The view register presents Dzogchen view maintained without separation between sessions—recognition continues without distinction between meditation and post-meditation. Translation risk: "post-meditation" (rjes thob) terminology can imply something inferior to samadhi, or recognition that fades, rather than continuous recognition. Preservation: the eight similes of illusion (sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad) and sky-simile (nam mkha' ltar) are standard Madhyamaka-Dzogchen integration points, connecting analytical understanding with direct recognition. The dusk, midnight, and dawn sections follow this pattern with specific emphases appropriate to those times—dusk emphasizes sense-faculty gathering, midnight emphasizes objects entering vase, dawn emphasizes wisdom clarification.
