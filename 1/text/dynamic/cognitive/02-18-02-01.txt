[4156-4169]
Structural function: Opening of body conduct section with authoritative citation from Sangye Sechik. The structural function establishes scriptural foundation for the twenty-one fold conduct practice. The verse enumerates body activities that will serve as the basis for distinction practice.

View register: Conduct as spontaneous expression of recognition, not discipline imposed from without. The activities enumerated—running, lying, rising, limb movement, circling, prostration, limb circling, head rolling, remembered actions, dance, mudra transformation, envisioned actions—all become vehicles for recognition when distinction is made. The key phrase body manifest attachment self-ceases indicates natural cessation through recognition, not forced restraint.

Translation risk: The phrase body manifest attachment self-ceases could imply a process of cessation rather than recognition of natural cessation. The twenty-one aspects begin here with body, and the animal similes that follow map to specific qualities requiring preservation.

Preservation: The citation establishes the complete range of body activities that can serve as recognition support. The distinction ru shan is the operative verb—making clear divisions between ordinary and enlightened activity, not between acceptable and prohibited. The translator activity body that transforms indicates this is about recognition of transformation, not cultivation of transformation.

[4170-4192]
Structural function: Talgyur citation elaborating the conduct framework with tantric authorization. The structural movement from general enumeration to tantric source establishes lineage continuity and method authority.

View register: Tantric conduct as means, not end. The enumeration of body activities—moving, sitting, gathering, various exercises, limb extending and withdrawing, various activities, mind of mindfulness grasping manifestly—provides comprehensive inventory. The six realms form conduct—all taken by mind, enacted by body. The two purposes establish dual benefit structure: common purification of body karma, supreme preparation for illusory body practice.

Translation risk: The list of activities can read as mere inventory rather than comprehensive coverage. Grasping with mind of mindfulness could be interpreted as deliberate control rather than recognition-based engagement.

Preservation: The Talgyur citation provides tantric authorization for the conduct approach. The Great Array Sutra citation at line 4184 grounds the practice in canonical authority. The key phrase whoever is able to enact conduct, like that thought later continuity ceases establishes that recognition in conduct interrupts samsaric continuity. This is not about activity cessation but fixation cessation.

[4193-4214]
Structural function: Detailed exposition of body distinction practice—the first of three gates. The structural function provides practical instruction with time periods and result markers.

View register: Body as foundation—since attachment arose through body initially, body must be starting point for reversal. The time periods are calibrated to individual capacity: seven days, eleven days, or half month. The three results establish progressive markers: external attachment reversed, internal body pacified, secret illusory body liberated. These are recognition signs, not achievement milestones.

Translation risk: The time periods could be read as arbitrary or mandatory rather than calibrated indicators. Illusory body could be interpreted as visualization rather than recognition of body's natural state.

Preservation: The Golden Essence Tantra citation provides lineage continuity. The three results correspond to three gates: external body attachment reversed, internal body pacification, secret illusory body clear-light liberation. The method body conduct done, afterward body karma exhausted, not delighting in doing, body misdeeds purified establishes the function—not activity accumulation but fixation exhaustion.

[4215-4260]
Structural function: Transition to speech conduct section—completing body, moving to speech as middle gate. The structural function maintains architectural consistency with body section while addressing speech's unique characteristics.

View register: Speech as connective tissue between body and mind. The diversity of languages—god, naga, yaksha, smell-eater, mermaid, pervader—represents comprehensive communication range, not exotic enumeration. Speech distinction cuts samsara-nirvana through the diversity of expression, not through silence.

Translation risk: The diversity of languages could be exoticized or dismissed as mythology rather than understood as comprehensive communication range. The twenty-one fold structure continues from body section and requires recognition as systematic coverage.

Preservation: The Secret Conduct Seed Tantra citation establishes the twenty-one fold structure continues. The Talgyur citation elaborates: having reached signs and measure, yogin begins speech conduct. Understanding expressed nature, various speech sounds, whatever spoken not reversed—this establishes that recognition in speech is not about what is said but about fixation on expression. The two purposes parallel body section: common cutting of three realms wheel, supreme liberation into three kayas.

[4261-4303]
Structural function: Mind conduct section completion—culminating the three gates with mind as fruit. The structural function establishes mind as root of samsara and therefore key to liberation.

View register: Mind conduct cuts the root of samsara. The enumeration of mental states—joy and displeasure, happiness and suffering, permanent and impermanent, view and meditation conduct intention, dharma and non-dharma, attachment aversion delusion, virtue and non-virtue—establishes comprehensive range. The essential point: body and speech free from attachment allows mind root to be cut.

Translation risk: Three realms wheel ceases could be read as achievement rather than recognition of natural cessation. The comprehensive enumeration of mental states risks being read as checklist rather than recognition that all mental states are equally empty in essence.

Preservation: The Sangye Sechik citation establishes authoritative foundation. The Talgyur citation elaborates: having reached measure, yogin trains mind. Past future present, memory thought gathering-dispersing wheel—this establishes that mind conduct encompasses temporal and cognitive range. The final citation from Khorlo Tsekpa seals the three-fold presentation: whoever distinguishes mind's distinction, this does not return to mind—indicating recognition beyond subject-object.

[4304-4345]
Structural function: Integration and conclusion of distinction conduct. The structural function demonstrates how three gates together prevent entry into three realms and establish the connection to empowerment and view.

View register: Integration as non-separation of practice and view. The term ru shan appears throughout as operative verb—making clear divisions between samsara and nirvana recognition, not gradual refinement. The three gates together function as complete practice: body as ground, speech as path, mind as fruit.

Translation risk: Treating this as sequential practice rather than simultaneous recognition misses the essential point. The time periods mentioned could be interpreted as graduated curriculum rather than recognition stabilization markers.

Preservation: The Dang Nyer Tokpa citation establishes authority: distinction made, not returning to three realms, stability shown, these are preliminary rites. The structural note—today's lazy ones given to mental preliminary followed by direct introduction—indicates historical adaptation. The essential point: diligent ones may liberate in three months through this practice alone, middling and lesser ones follow direct introduction afterward.

[4346-4367]
Structural function: Main practice section opening—defining main practice through fourfold analysis. The structural fourfold division provides comprehensive typology: base but not entity, entity but not base, neither base nor entity, both base and entity.

View register: Main practice as recognition beyond four extremes. The metaphors establish clarity: seeing palace without seeing king—some Dzogchen practitioners see base but not entity, arriving at natural death. Seeing king without recognizing characteristics—some instructions hit the point initially but do not establish certainty through words, becoming scattered. Seeing neither—common vehicles using words for view-meditation, not meeting meaning. Seeing both—direct perception Heart Essence point, seeing base without return point, samsara-nirvana decided in single moment.

Translation risk: The fourfold analysis could be read as philosophical logic-chopping rather than recognition pointers. The metaphor of king and palace requires cultural contextualization.

Preservation: The essential distinction: authentic main practice is recognition beyond the four extremes, where view-meditation are spontaneous, base seen without return, samsara-nirvana decided simultaneously. The warning—even seeing dharma-nature directly, without practice, liberation does not occur. This establishes that recognition requires stabilization, not that practice creates what is absent.

[4368-4390]
Structural function: Detailed exposition of direct introduction proper—bringing meaning to the point. The structural function provides the actual pointing-out instruction for recognition.

View register: Rigpa brought to its own ground—this is called seeing vajra coil of joy's appearance. The criticism of those who describe rigpa without direct introduction: like describing Vajra Seat without seeing it, or excellent blind description of color to another. The oscillation between thinking it is unborn emptiness and thinking it is various appearances—this is conceptual assessment, not recognition.

Translation risk: Brought to the point could be read as achieving rather than recognizing. The criticism of mere words risks being read as anti-intellectual rather than emphasizing direct experience.

Preservation: The pointing-out is not describable through words. Those who speak of rigpa in common way do not reach the point. The oscillation between emptiness and appearance creates suffering: sometimes thinking it is, sometimes thinking it is not, mind falling into uncertainty, wounded by unhappy grief, wondering what it is, thinking what to do if die now, circling samsara's shore without dharma. This describes the suffering of conceptual assessment, not the peace of recognition.

[4391-4400]
Structural function: Conclusion of view section with technical markers of recognition. The structural function provides precise phenomenological indicators for confirming recognition.

View register: Rigpa's nature without good-bad or change—all arises from that nature with nowhere else to go. This is called base—impossible to stray elsewhere. The threefold liberation markers: wind key holding liberates through movement signs, bindu liberation through bindu connection, channel key liberation through subtle coil signs. These three are not rigpa itself but liberation through depending on it.

Translation risk: The technical descriptions of signs could be read as requirements rather than indicators. Base as impossibility of straying could be interpreted as determinism rather as recognition of natural purity.

Preservation: Rigpa seen is not enough—familiarization required. Sign of familiarization: coils connecting with each other. Direct perception seeing with pure wisdom eye—seeing at that moment liberates like arrow striking hero's heart. Seeing with pure dharma-nature eye—distinctions distinguished in first instant. The technical precision serves recognition confirmation, not achievement measurement.
