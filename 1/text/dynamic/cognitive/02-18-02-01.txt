[4156-4400]
Distinction between ordinary and enlightened body behavior. Ordinary body functions: moving, lying down, sitting, limbs stretching, walking, various physical actions—all performed with mental grasping. Buddha's body actions: moving, sitting, all activities done without mental grasping—body manifests as transformation body (sprul pa'i sku). Two categories: common and supreme distinction. First: ordinary behavior done with attachment, buddha behavior without grasping. Second: when body cuts attachment, naturally becomes dharmakāya—spontaneous presence beyond conceptual activity. Structural note: connects to discussion of how enlightened activity manifests without effort. Register: Mahāyāna Buddha-body terminology (sprul pa, chos sku).
