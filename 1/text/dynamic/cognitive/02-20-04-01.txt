Awareness in various states - no good-bad distinction. When first losing rigpa, two awarenesses at time of delusion have no good-bad distinction. Awareness not meditated, during meditation, during wandering, at time of passing, going to sleep, waking, coming and going—awareness has no good-bad. However, dream shows joy and suffering of good-bad appearance. Essence doesn't go to good—awareness has no transfer or change. Key metaphor: precious jewel nectar lost in beginningless time, wandering wrongly in suffering, not found by searching—self-arisen, realized by self. Structural note: Dzogchen view of rigpa's immutable nature across all states.
