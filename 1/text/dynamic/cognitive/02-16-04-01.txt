Four enlightened activities through color-symbolism correspondence. The structural function is establishing the activity-system that organizes tantric transformation practice. Zhi ba through dkar po chos nyid zhi ba establishes white as pacifying color, mapped onto chos nyid as the dharmatā dimension. The metaphor of shel gong dag pa preserves the crystal purity image. The verse citation dkar po chos nyid zhi ba'o, nyon mongs dri ma ga la yod, gos pa med pa'i dkyil 'khor ni, dper na shel gong dag pa bzhin, dri ma'i skyon gyis ma gos pa'o establishes the undefiled nature as basis for pacifying activity. Rgyas pa through ser po rgyas pa'i chos nyid establishes yellow as enriching, mapped onto yon tan abundance. The nor bu rin po che metaphor maintains the wish-fulfilling jewel correspondence. Risk: color-activity correspondences must be preserved as technical tantric mappings, not generalized symbolism.

[1610-1636]
Powerful and fierce activities. Dbang through dmar po dbang gi chos nyid establishes red as powerful, mapped onto ma btsal gzhi la grub pa. The rin chen gser metaphor preserves the gold self-existing quality. The verse citation dmar po dbang gi chos nyid de, ma btsal gzhi la grub pa yin, dbang nyid chos sku'i ngo bo ste, thams cad ma btsal grub pa ste establishes power as self-existing in the ground. Drag po through ljangs gu chos nyid drag po establishes green as fierce, mapped onto thogs med 'char ba. The rlung gi sprul pa metaphor maintains the wind unstoppable force. The verse citation ljangs gu chos nyid drag po ste, thams cad drag po'i ngo la rdzogs, gzhi nyid dag pa'i chos nyid la, gang la thogs med 'char ba ni establishes fierce activity as unobstructed manifestation. The structural function is completing the four-activity system. Risk: drag po as fierce must be preserved as energetic-unobstructed, not aggressive-violent.

[1637-1637]
Transition marker to being-time exposition. The structural function is shifting from primordial-ground presentation to temporal-unfolding presentation. The phrase sems can gyi dus na rdzogs pa'i tshul establishes the temporal frame without abandoning the non-temporal ground. This marks the transition from gnas lugs to snang lugs, from abiding manner to appearance manner. The second paragraph will present the four activities in the context of beings' temporal experience. Risk: the temporal language could be read as historicization; preservation requires recognizing the timeless-time structure that characterizes Dzogchen exposition. The distinction between gdod ma'i gzhi la rdzogs pa and sems can gyi dus na rdzogs pa preserves the ground-display relationship without dualism.
