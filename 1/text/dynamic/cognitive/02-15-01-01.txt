Volume Two opening marks the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle's second book. The structural function operates as a transitional architecture, bridging Volume One's extensive analysis of Alaya-ground and Dharmakaya distinctions into the present treatment of dependent arising nature. The chapter organizes through a primary bifurcation: common distinction followed by extensive individual nature explanation. The view register presents synthetic Dzogchen cosmology where dependent arising integrates with primordial purity, not as philosophical synthesis but as recognition support. Translation risk emerges in treating this as standard Abhidharma dependent arising rather than Dzogchen's distinct reinterpretation where arising displays wisdom nature. Preservation priority: the two-fold distinction establishing outer-arising and inner-arising provides the comprehensive framework for all subsequent element analysis, and this structural scaffolding must remain visible.

[16-55]
The presentation establishes the five elements as the basis for all existence without exception. Outer elements as earth, water, fire, wind, and space serve as the support for beings; inner elements as channels, fluids, heat, breath, and mind serve as the basis for mind. The structural function demonstrates the interdependence: without these outer and inner elements, neither sentient beings nor buddhas could manifest. The view register presents elements not as material substrates but as wisdom display—the term 'byung ba chen po' (great arising) indicates their nature as expressive display rather than substantial ground. Translation risk involves normalizing this terminology into generic element concepts, losing the Dzogchen specificity. Preservation requires maintaining the citation from Self-Arisen tantra as authoritative grounding, and the distinction between confused elements (samsara) and pure elements (nirvana) maps the samsara-nirvana correspondence crucial to the tradition's view.

[56-99]
The extensive explanation unfolds through ten analytical categories: essence, definitive terminology, purpose, characteristics, sequence, dharma-nature, meaning application, liberation manner, divisions, and completeness. The structural function applies Abhidharma-style analytical precision to Dzogchen view, demonstrating how systematic exposition serves recognition rather than philosophical speculation. The view register maintains that analytical precision itself becomes recognition support when understood properly. Translation risk involves rendering the tenfold structure as mere categorical list rather than systematic exposition building cumulative understanding. Preservation priority: the essence section (ngo bo) establishes the pivotal Dzogchen view that outer-arising as appearance is actually inner-arising's play—this identity is the chapter's central pivot and must remain explicit.

[100-127]
The purpose section demonstrates the utility of each element through detailed functional descriptions. Water gathers and separates, earth holds and establishes, fire ripens and clarifies, wind moves and lifts—each function corresponds to specific wisdom qualities manifesting through elemental display. The structural function establishes practical cosmology where element operations map to wisdom activities. The view register presents functional cosmology as direct display of wisdom qualities, not primitive material science. Translation risk: functional descriptions can read as pre-scientific natural philosophy rather than wisdom pointers requiring recognition. Preservation demands maintaining the explicit connection between element functions and wisdom qualities. The citation from Talgyur tantra establishes tantric authority for these functional descriptions, anchoring them in received tradition rather than speculative construction.

[128-145]
Characteristics and sequence sections establish the phenomenology and temporal process of elements. Earth manifests solidity, water moisture, fire warmth, wind movement, space spaciousness—these characteristics map directly to wisdom aspects: earth connects with birth-free wisdom, wind with unobstructed wisdom, fire with wisdom under afflictions, water with all-objects wisdom, space with unbroken continuity. The structural function establishes systematic phenomenology. The view register presents characteristics as wisdom qualities manifesting through elemental appearance. Translation risk: solidity-moisture-warmth-movement-spaciousness could be read as mere material properties rather than wisdom signatures. Preservation requires maintaining these wisdom-element correspondences as technical mappings, not poetic associations.

[146-166]
The dharma-nature section establishes emptiness as the intrinsic nature of elements through Self-Arisen citation. Elements appear yet are empty; they are not non-existent but empty in their appearing. The structural function establishes the emptiness-appearance identity as element nature. The view register presents elements as empty yet appearing, manifesting without substantial existence. Translation risk: "dharma-nature" terminology could be normalized into generic emptiness concepts, losing the specific Dzogchen formulation. Preservation priority: the fivefold correspondence—earth as arising cause, fire as prajna, wind as emanation, water as master, space as dharma-nature—establishes the wisdom-element identity that structures the entire presentation.

[167-194]
Meaning application unfolds in two parts: essence meaning establishing the overall framework, and individual meaning connecting each element with rigpa. The structural function bridges theoretical analysis to recognition practice, demonstrating how outer elements become vehicles for self-awareness connection. The view register presents outer elements as naturally connecting with self-rigpa through their appearing. Translation risk: "common self-continuum" (thun mong rang rgyud) could be misread as universal substance rather than shared recognition basis. Preservation requires maintaining the Norbu Phrulkod citation establishing outer elements as common dharma through connection with self-rigpa, and the detailed element-rigpa correspondences must preserve technical precision without reduction to generalities.

[195-224]
The liberation manner section presents twenty-five element divisions demonstrating how each element liberates into its natural state. Space liberates as entity through pervasive emptiness; wind liberates through ungraspable appearance; fire through consuming-ripening function; earth through limitless non-entity; water through burning-ripening function. The structural function demonstrates liberation as recognition of natural purity rather than transformation or purification. The view register presents liberation as recognition, not achievement. Translation risk: the Mutig Phrengba citation's poetic expression could obscure the technical meaning of liberation-as-recognition. Preservation requires maintaining the specific liberation mechanism for each element as recognition of its natural purity.

[225-239]
Training in element distinctions and sound-meaning accomplishments connects analytical understanding to practice results. Familiarity with element-sound correspondences produces capacities and clarities—not as magical powers but as natural expressions of recognition. The structural function establishes the practical application of element analysis. The view register presents accomplishments as natural expressions of recognition maturity, not siddhis to acquire. Translation risk: "common attainments" could be read as worldly siddhis rather than recognition capacities. Preservation requires maintaining the Sound Talgyur and Secret Conduct Seed citations establishing the connection between element-sound training and capacities, and the six clairvoyances arising from self-sound familiarity.

[240-270]
The completeness section opens with partial similarity explanation: all dharmas complete in body-mind as primordial fact, not achievement. Father-mother correspond to method-wisdom; karma-wind to Dharmakaya-awakening; five families to five elements; two equipoise essences to two accumulations; womb abiding to base-expanse abiding. The structural function demonstrates cosmological-embodiment mappings. The view register presents completeness as primordial fact always already present. Translation risk: the detailed correspondence lists could be rendered as arbitrary symbolic associations. Preservation requires maintaining systematic mappings as recognition supports, not decorative symbolism.

[271-350]
Detailed womb-development correspondences demonstrate path completion through embryonic development. Seven seven-day sets correspond to seven pure elements and seven paths; ten months correspond to ten grounds; birth-death processes correspond to three kayas. The structural function presents biological process as dharma display. The view register treats embryonic development as natural dharma unfolding, not metaphor requiring interpretation. Translation risk: literal reading of womb stages as developmental narrative misses their function as recognition supports. Preservation priority: these correspondences operate as recognition supports, not biological metaphors. The Mutig Phrengba citation seals the primordial liberation teaching—liberation already complete, never requiring achievement.

[351-425]
Body-mind completeness presents the exhaustive inventory of correspondences: channels as trees, bones as rocks, heart as root, limbs as branches, faculties as flowers, body as fruit; male as birth, female as death; planets as desire-gates, stars as teeth; clouds as hair, trees as channels; mountains as whole body, rocks as bones. The structural function culminates the outer-arising presentation with comprehensive inventory demonstrating all phenomena complete in the practitioner. The view register presents all phenomena as wisdom display naturally complete. Translation risk: microcosm-macrocosm framing could exoticize the presentation as mystical correspondence rather than recognition support. Preservation requires maintaining the exhaustive lists as detailed correspondences used in actual practice, not decorative catalogues.

[426-473]
The transition to inner-arising completes the outer-arising presentation and sets up Volume Two's main topic. The structural function marks the pivot from external cosmological analysis to internal subtle body investigation. The view register maintains continuity: outer elements are inner elements' display, inner elements are outer elements' basis—neither precedes nor exceeds the other. Translation risk: treating the transition as abandoning outer for inner analysis misses their identity. Preservation priority: the framework established in outer-arising serves as the template for inner-arising analysis, maintaining structural continuity across the volume's two major sections.
