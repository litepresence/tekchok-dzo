Volume Two opening marks the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle's second book. The structural function operates as transitional architecture, bridging Volume One's extensive analysis of Alaya-ground and Dharmakaya distinctions into the present treatment of dependent arising nature. The chapter organizes through a primary bifurcation: common distinction followed by extensive individual nature explanation. The view register presents synthetic Dzogchen cosmology where dependent arising integrates with primordial purity, not as philosophical synthesis but as recognition support. Translation risk emerges in treating this as standard Abhidharma dependent arising rather than Dzogchen's distinct reinterpretation where arising displays wisdom nature. Preservation priority: the two-fold distinction establishing outer-arising and inner-arising provides the comprehensive framework for all subsequent element analysis, and this structural scaffolding must remain visible to downstream rendering processes.

The presentation establishes the five elements as the basis for all existence without exception. Outer elements as earth, water, fire, wind, and space serve as the support for beings; inner elements as channels, fluids, heat, breath, and mind serve as the basis for mind and awareness. The structural function demonstrates the interdependence: without these outer and inner elements, neither sentient beings nor buddhas could manifest. The view register presents elements not as material substrates but as wisdom display—the term 'byung ba chen po' (great arising) indicates their nature as expressive display rather than substantial ground. Translation risk involves normalizing this terminology into generic element concepts, losing the Dzogchen specificity that elements are primordial wisdom's spontaneous display. Preservation requires maintaining the citation from Self-Arisen tantra as authoritative grounding, and the distinction between confused elements (samsara) and pure elements (nirvana) maps the samsara-nirvana correspondence crucial to the tradition's view of non-dual purity.

The extensive explanation unfolds through ten analytical categories: essence, definitive terminology, purpose, characteristics, sequence, dharma-nature, meaning application, liberation manner, divisions, and completeness. The structural function applies Abhidharma-style analytical precision to Dzogchen view, demonstrating how systematic exposition serves recognition rather than philosophical speculation. The view register maintains that analytical precision itself becomes recognition support when understood properly—not as knowledge to acquire but as structure that reveals nature. Translation risk involves rendering the tenfold structure as mere categorical list rather than systematic exposition building cumulative understanding. Preservation priority: the essence section (ngo bo) establishes the pivotal Dzogchen view that outer-arising as appearance is actually inner-arising's play—this identity is the chapter's central pivot and must remain explicit as the non-dual foundation of all subsequent analysis.

The purpose section demonstrates the utility of each element through detailed functional descriptions. Water gathers and separates, earth holds and establishes, fire ripens and clarifies, wind moves and lifts—each function corresponds to specific wisdom qualities manifesting through elemental display. The structural function establishes practical cosmology where element operations map to wisdom activities. The view register presents functional cosmology as direct display of wisdom qualities, not primitive material science. Translation risk: functional descriptions can read as pre-scientific natural philosophy rather than wisdom pointers requiring recognition. Preservation demands maintaining the explicit connection between element functions and wisdom qualities. The citation from Talgyur tantra establishes tantric authority for these functional descriptions, anchoring them in received tradition rather than speculative construction.

Characteristics and sequence sections establish the phenomenology and temporal process of elements. Earth manifests solidity, water moisture, fire warmth, wind movement, space spaciousness—these characteristics map directly to wisdom aspects: earth connects with birth-free wisdom, wind with unobstructed wisdom, fire with wisdom under afflictions, water with all-objects wisdom, space with unbroken continuity. The structural function establishes systematic phenomenology. The view register presents characteristics as wisdom qualities manifesting through elemental appearance. Translation risk: solidity-moisture-warmth-movement-spaciousness could be read as mere material properties rather than wisdom signatures. Preservation requires maintaining these wisdom-element correspondences as technical mappings, not poetic associations. The sequence section establishes the temporal development of elements in embryonic formation, demonstrating biological process as dharma display.

The dharma-nature section establishes emptiness as the intrinsic nature of elements through Self-Arisen citation. Elements appear yet are empty; they are not non-existent but empty in their appearing. The structural function establishes the emptiness-appearance identity as element nature. The view register presents elements as empty yet appearing, manifesting without substantial existence. Translation risk: "dharma-nature" terminology could be normalized into generic emptiness concepts, losing the specific Dzogchen formulation. Preservation priority: the fivefold correspondence—earth as arising cause, fire as prajna, wind as emanation, water as master, space as dharma-nature—establishes the wisdom-element identity that structures the entire presentation. This mapping is not arbitrary symbolism but precise technical correspondence.

Meaning application unfolds in two parts: essence meaning establishing the overall framework, and individual meaning connecting each element with rigpa. The structural function bridges theoretical analysis to recognition practice, demonstrating how outer elements become vehicles for self-awareness connection. The view register presents outer elements as naturally connecting with self-rigpa through their appearing. Translation risk: "common self-continuum" (thun mong rang rgyud) could be misread as universal substance rather than shared recognition basis. Preservation requires maintaining the Norbu Phrulkod citation establishing outer elements as common dharma through connection with self-rigpa, and the detailed element-rigpa correspondences must preserve technical precision without reduction to generalities. Earth solidity corresponds to wisdom free from birth-death, wind lifting to unobstructed wisdom, fire burning to wisdom under afflictions, water gathering to wisdom entering all objects, space spaciousness to wisdom without interruption.

The liberation manner section presents twenty-five element divisions demonstrating how each element liberates into its natural state. Space liberates as entity through pervasive emptiness; wind liberates through ungraspable appearance; fire through consuming-ripening function; earth through limitless non-entity; water through burning-ripening function. The structural function demonstrates liberation as recognition of natural purity rather than transformation or purification. The view register presents liberation as recognition, not achievement. Translation risk: the Mutig Phrengba citation's poetic expression could obscure the technical meaning of liberation-as-recognition. Preservation requires maintaining the specific liberation mechanism for each element as recognition of its natural purity. The twenty-fivefold structure demonstrates systematic completeness: each of five elements has five modes of expression.

Training in element distinctions and sound-meaning accomplishments connects analytical understanding to practice results. Familiarity with element-sound correspondences produces capacities and clarities—not as magical powers but as natural expressions of recognition. The structural function establishes the practical application of element analysis. The view register presents accomplishments as natural expressions of recognition maturity, not siddhis to acquire. Translation risk: "common attainments" could be read as worldly siddhis rather than recognition capacities. Preservation requires maintaining the Sound Talgyur and Secret Conduct Seed citations establishing the connection between element-sound training and capacities, and the six clairvoyances arising from self-sound familiarity. The six classes' self-sounds manifesting through familiarity demonstrates how analytical training yields practical recognition.

The completeness section opens with partial similarity explanation: all dharmas complete in body-mind as primordial fact, not achievement. Father-mother correspond to method-wisdom; karma-wind to Dharmakaya-awakening; five families to five elements; two equipoise essences to two accumulations; womb abiding to base-expanse abiding. The structural function demonstrates cosmological-embodiment mappings. The view register presents completeness as primordial fact always already present. Translation risk: the detailed correspondence lists could be rendered as arbitrary symbolic associations. Preservation requires maintaining systematic mappings as recognition supports, not decorative symbolism. The seven seven-day sets and ten months establish embryonic development as path completion display.

Detailed womb-development correspondences demonstrate path completion through embryonic development. Seven seven-day sets correspond to seven pure elements and seven paths; ten months correspond to ten grounds; birth-death processes correspond to three kayas. The structural function presents biological process as dharma display. The view register treats embryonic development as natural dharma unfolding, not metaphor requiring interpretation. Translation risk: literal reading of womb stages as developmental narrative misses their function as recognition supports. Preservation priority: these correspondences operate as recognition supports, not biological metaphors. The Mutig Phrengba citation seals the primordial liberation teaching—liberation already complete, never requiring achievement. Birth as Dharmakaya-awakening from expanse, body abiding as Sambhogakaya-enjoyment of objects, death as Dharmakaya-empty nature—these are not metaphors but descriptions of always-already condition.

Body-mind completeness presents the exhaustive inventory of correspondences: channels as trees, bones as rocks, heart as root, limbs as branches, faculties as flowers, body as fruit; male as birth, female as death; planets as desire-gates, stars as teeth; clouds as hair, trees as channels; mountains as whole body, rocks as bones. The structural function culminates the outer-arising presentation with comprehensive inventory demonstrating all phenomena complete in the practitioner. The view register presents all phenomena as wisdom display naturally complete. Translation risk: microcosm-macrocosm framing could exoticize the presentation as mystical correspondence rather than recognition support. Preservation requires maintaining the exhaustive lists as detailed correspondences used in actual practice, not decorative catalogues. The detailed channel-fluid-heat-breath-mind to tree-water-fire-wind-space mappings establish systematic identity between body and cosmos.

The element-component correspondences complete the body-cosmos identity: earth component flesh, water component blood, fire component warmth, wind component breath, space component mind, sun-moon component eyes, male component birth, female component death. The structural function provides detailed component mapping. The view register presents components as wisdom display naturally complete. Translation risk: component terminology could be read as material analysis rather than recognition support. Preservation requires maintaining the systematic component-to-phenomena correspondence as precise technical mapping. The planets as desire-gates and nostrils, stars as teeth, clouds as hair, trees as channels, mountains as whole body, rocks as bones establish comprehensive outer-inner identity.

The mind completeness section establishes that all samsara-nirvana base-path dharmas complete in body-mind. Past white dharmas complete in body and mind; samsara's dharmas past-empty; mandala deities, offerings, mantras, mudras, absorptions, empowerments, samayas, instructions, experiences, development stages, hearing, thinking, meditation, view, conduct, giving, ethics, patience, effort, concentration, wisdom, powers, aspirations, wisdoms, method perfections, ten virtues—all complete in body and mind. The structural function demonstrates comprehensive dharma completeness. The view register presents all dharmas as naturally present, not achievements to accomplish. Translation risk: the extensive lists could be read as catalogues rather than recognition supports. Preservation requires maintaining the exhaustive enumeration as complete description of natural completeness.

The rigpa completeness section establishes that however phenomena appear, dharmas complete in self-appearance rigpa. Sun-moon as method-wisdom, male as base, female as path, planets as recognition measure, stars as dharmas, clouds as all-pervasive compassion, trees as dharmata extensive path, mountains as unchanging view, rocks as Dharmakaya free from birth-death, root as all dharmas' single cause, branches as bodhi branches, trunk as empty single taste, leaves as pervasive dharmadhatu, flowers as wisdom lamps, fruit as spontaneously complete three kayas, sound as dharmata object sound, smell as Buddha speech fragrance, taste as experience bliss taste, touch as great concentration, music as fivefold mandala complete, banner as clear color resonance, parasol as protecting prajna, victory banner as recognition manifest Buddha. The structural function completes the comprehensive inventory. The view register presents all phenomena as wisdom display naturally complete in mind nature. Translation risk: the extensive correspondences could be read as arbitrary symbolism. Preservation requires maintaining the systematic rigpa-phenomena correspondence as complete description of natural identity.

The transition to inner-arising completes the outer-arising presentation and sets up Volume Two's main topic. The structural function marks the pivot from external cosmological analysis to internal subtle body investigation. The view register maintains continuity: outer elements are inner elements' display, inner elements are outer elements' basis—neither precedes nor exceeds the other. Translation risk: treating the transition as abandoning outer for inner analysis misses their identity. Preservation priority: the framework established in outer-arising serves as the template for inner-arising analysis, maintaining structural continuity across the volume's two major sections. The five winds and five fires each subdividing into twenty-five demonstrates systematic completeness of inner-arising analysis.

The final section establishes that inner-arising winds—life-holding, fire-equal, color-radiance, all-pervading, karma—each subdivide into five, creating twenty-five winds corresponding to twenty-five body components. The structural function demonstrates systematic wind enumeration. The view register presents winds as wisdom display manifesting through subtle body. Translation risk: wind terminology could be read as physiological breath rather than subtle energetic wisdom display. Preservation requires maintaining the twenty-fivefold wind structure as complete description of subtle body wisdom display. The Self-Arisen citation establishes that five great elements complete in own body, with five winds producing wisdom resonance, five fires producing wisdom capacity, five earths producing wisdom entity, five waters producing wisdom objects, five spaces producing wisdom abiding. This establishes the systematic identity between outer and inner elements as wisdom display.
