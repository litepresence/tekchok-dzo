Opening marks Volume Two beginning—Treasury of Supreme Vehicle. Previous chapter established Alaya-ground and Dharmakaya distinction. Now dependent arising nature explained: common distinction and extensive explanation of individual natures. Outer-arising and inner-arising two types. Outer-arising: earth water fire wind space exist as basis for inner-arising—connected as basis dependent twofold. Without these two no beings nor buddhas exist. All beings move within confused expanse five-arising possessing self-nature great arising. All buddhas dwell in expanse five pure-arisings: earth without solidity moving in complete cessation five great arising stains. Five great arising possess luminosity-wisdom five colors five small arisings earth water fire wind space five pure arisings clear warm bright cool spacious holding self-nature movement.

Five confused arisings arrive in expanse meeting inner expanse like purity great arising spontaneous presence appearance. Small arising: arising-form and actual arising two. Arising-form five appearing now externally earth water fire wind space. Actual arising five qualities body thin becoming five inner-arising bases. Inner-arising five individual dharma-arisings bases pure realms. All samsara nirvana do not move from expanse five-arising before five-arising samsara nirvana do not arise. Self-Arisen tantra: Kye Ho Secret Lord listen five-arising characteristics shown Bhagavan exists as nature all beings three realms move in expanse five-arising before five-arising did not exist neither buddhas beings names did not exist five-arising themselves mother-expanse not established five-arising not even one birth-going being exists five-arisings beings dwelling therein shown twofold.

Extensive explanation outer-arising and inner-arising. Outer-arising essence: outer-arising appearing as form is play of inner-arising actuality gathered within inner domain five-arising. Self-Arisen: outer-arising earth water fire wind space five forms outer-arising appearing container-support beings five actualities inner-arising support mind awareness. Thal gyur: arising assertion from particularities general-common karma individual karma-supports beings relying upon outer-arising karma sustenance faculties entourage birth complete. Definitive terminology: Self-Arisen not made by fabrication spontaneously complete producing arises pervading all migrators great-arising simultaneous birth great-arising existing in themselves great-arising without change great-arising appearing harmoniously great-arising.

Purpose: Thal gyur water gathers clear essence separates impurities function heat cold earth holds foundation performs establishing cohering ripening produces roots relative thigle fire increases arising performs ripening clarifying blazing spreading produces eyes warmth wind scatters lifts performs moving quivering holds body abode mind four arising great mandala self become cause accomplishing body abiding middle performing holding function end performing destruction functions one cause great arising appear as master performing various intention self other skilled meaning completed action. Characteristics five: earth solidity water moisture fire warmth wind movement space openness spaciousness. Sequence functions: earth makes body basis producing flesh ripening water gathers entire body producing blood ripening fire ripens entire body warmth ripening wind lifts entire body breath ripening.

Dharma-nature: generally empty dharma-nature holds its own characteristic made authoritative. Self-Arisen five-arising dharma-nature: arising cause earth arising wisdom fire arising emanation wind arising master water arising dharma-nature space. Application meaning: That Very five-arising essence within Dharmakaya nature primordially pure essence without change arising-earth awareness-wisdom engaging meaning arising-fire awareness-wisdom unmoved gone into expanse arising-wind awareness-wisdom gathering three cavities as one arising-water wisdom dissolving into nondual empty-luminous manner arising-space. Connecting five-arising individual meanings with inner awareness: Norbu phrul bkod outer-arising common dharma self-continuum connecting all outer-appearing arising with self-awareness itself common dharma.

Divisions: earth-characteristic making solidity connects with awareness-wisdom free from birth destruction wind-characteristic making lifting connects with awareness-wisdom without obstruction fire-characteristic making burning connects with awareness-wisdom gone under afflictions authority water-characteristic making moistening connects with awareness-wisdom entering all objects space-characteristic vastness connects with awareness-characteristic without break continuity. Manner liberation: Mu tig phreng ba space pervading emptiness liberates as entity wind appearing without graspable object liberates into entity-gathering function fire consuming what ripens liberates moving separating clear from impure earth producer lift liberates into limitless empty non-entity water moistening liberates into burning-ripening function. Divisions: each five-arising earth earth five sets five enumeration portions twenty-five.

Wind toward entity space fire makes gathering space water makes burning space earth opens opportunity space space appears wind wind toward stability space great sound-potential wind water great quickness speed wind fire great projection gathering wind earth clear form-reflection water water sound-echo water space without obstruction water wind flows attachment-free water fire makes gathering water earth makes pervading fire earth makes producing fire space burns entity fire wind makes blazing fire water makes destroying fire earth holds earth earth pervades migrators earth space mahayana earth wind makes snow-empty earth water produces entity earth fire dries. Training distinctions distinguished qualities each accomplished Sound Thal gyur training elements sound-meaning common attainments obtained form body becomes exhausted sound languages known smell taking essence accomplished taste entity becomes nectar.

Secret Conduct Seed Tantra: earth water fire wind four elements sounds meanings becoming familiar six races self-sounds arising clairvoyance accomplishes. Outer-arising all beings support abode. Tenth: manner showing how samsara-nirvana dharmas complete in yogi body-mind threefold: generally showing partial-similarity completeness manner explaining particular body-mind completeness manner making understood through play great definite symbols. Partial-similarity: gathered body-mind migrators all primordially self-arise with complete parts father mother method wisdom portion karma-projecting wind Dharmakaya-awakening portion five elements seeds five families sound-potential portion two equipoise essences path two accumulations method-wisdom union portion womb-abiding base-expanse-abiding portion body forming seven seven-day sets seven pure elements seven paths completing portion ten womb months ten grounds completing portion three-kaya buddhahood path-completing portion birth emanation-body body-abiding engaging fields enjoyment-body death Dharmakaya emptiness portion manner migrators primordially traversing base-path-result liberated.

Mu tig phreng ba: Bhagavan not liberated by effort abiding liberated from primordial method wisdom union Father mother cause projecting wind moving portion self-aware awakening great bliss five-arising cause seed arises appearing from emptiness-field two bliss equipoise wisdom itself arisen from method womb-belly entering self-awareness arising from base seven seven-sets realization measure ten months grounds traversing birth kaya-arising producing body base-appearing field body-abiding base aging delusion confusion-awakening sickness realization-confidence death liberation into dharmat emptiness thus all appearing beings primordially liberated without effort. Connecting with delusion-reversing: birth awareness moving from expanse portion body base outer-appearing portion base-appearing spontaneous completion sickness realization meeting face-to-face aging truth-clinging confusion-awakening death knowing self-face shows final arrival at primordial purity ground inner expanse portion.

These arising primordially instruction introduction empowerment liberation through meditation suitable complete in partial similarity not able liberate through instruction clearly showing partial similarity exists Buddha dharma called existing in base-path primordial measure what becomes shown as symbol-meaning Buddha speaking also arrives at this essence. Body-mind completeness manner threefold: body mind awareness completeness. Body: four-arising gathered aggregate outer container-world portion inner essence-migrants portions all complete. Mu tig phreng ba earth water fire wind space sun moon born males females forms planets stars clouds trees mountains rocks roots trunks branches leaves flowers fruits smells tastes sounds touches music canopies banners upper-canopies those appearing surrounding dharmas complete in yogi own body.

Explaining portions: earth portion flesh water blood fire warmth wind breath space mind sun-moon two eyes male portion birth female death planet portion desire gate-house nostrils star teeth cloud hair tree channels mountain whole body rock bones heart limbs five faculties eyes accomplished body happiness-suffering voice body pores skin sickness channels internal organs urine legs name breath. Mu tig phreng ba earth flesh entity water blood gathering fire warmth ripening all body wind breath karma container space mind body potential sun-moon eye making clear male birth female appears death planet mouth star teeth cloud hair tree channels mountain body rock bones root heart trunk legs branches limbs flower five faculties fruit accomplished body smell pores skin sound voice touch sickness music internal organs canopy water parasol legs banner name upper-canopy breath complete in yogi body.

Mind: all samsara-nirvana dharmas base path completely present. That Very all white transcendence dharmas completely present in body-mind because samsara dharmas empty of transcendence mandala deity offering mantra mudra concentration empowerment samaya instruction-giving experience likewise development stage hearing contemplating meditating view conduct meditation giving ethics patience effort concentration wisdom power aspiration wisdom method perfection ten virtues conduct method wisdom. Those transcendence-indicating dharmas abide completely in body-mind. Awareness completeness: whatever self-appearing awareness face all however-appearing dharmas complete. Awareness itself sun moon method wisdom male base female path planet realization measure dharma cloud compassion pervading all tree dharmat expanding path mountain view without change rock Dharmakaya free from birth destruction root all dharmas one cause branch awakening branch trunk one taste emptiness leaf pervading dharmadhatu flower wisdom lamp fruit three kayas self-complete sound dharmat field sound smell Buddha-speech fame taste experience bliss taste touch great concentration music five complete mandala clear color potential protecting wisdom instruction great essential point banner manifest realization Buddha all dharmas mind-itself face abide in primordial spontaneous completion manner mind entity dharmas merely imputed.

Inner-arising: essence five-arising inwardly rely upon body five coarse arising wind fire earth water space five each abiding as five twenty-five limbs definite suitability five depending on five different functions. Self-Arisen five great arising complete in own body five winds make wisdom-potential five fires make wisdom-potency five earths make wisdom-essence five waters make wisdom-object five spaces make wisdom-abode. Second: five wind fire earth water space nature extensive explanation. Root division: Self-Arisen five wind types life-holding wind color-radiance producing wind fire-equal wind all-pervading wind compassionless karma wind five those winds abide in all beings bodies head tail life-holding wind abides in life-channel color-radiance producing abides in chest fire-equal abides in navel all-pervading abides pervading whole body karma wind abides between heart heart-membrane functions life-abiding radiance-producing food-digesting going-sitting life-transference function performing sequence.
