Mind-Only presentation: appearing objects are aspects of one's own consciousness, appearing externally like a jewel's reflection in water. Three positions: equal number of aspects and consciousness; aspects contained within consciousness like shell and kernel; or aspects and consciousness non-dual. All deny external objects while affirming consciousness as ultimately existent.
