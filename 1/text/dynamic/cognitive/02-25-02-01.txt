Manner of attainment and result. Three aspects: general presentation of manner of attainment, detailed explanation that it is result, explanation of path as appearance and avoidance of contradiction. From essence arising as Three Bodies—demonstration of attainment by power of purifying stains of three gates. Result: Dharmakaya attained by action of mind, Sambhogakaya by aspect of speech, Emanation Body by body—called cause-effect to be purified.
