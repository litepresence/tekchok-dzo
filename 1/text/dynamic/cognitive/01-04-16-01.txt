Structural function establishes the two categories of klong dkar po related to vast action and view-meditation integration. View register positions these as expressions of the ocean-like expanse where primordial purity manifests without effort. Translation risks render "las rgya che ba" as mere magnitude rather than recognizing its technical sense of vast activity without causal origination. Preservation requirements maintain the distinction between the ocean expanse and sky expanse as separate categories with specific characteristics.

Structural function details the great ocean expanse through self-abiding emptiness and primordial liberation. View register emphasizes the single wheel of great transcendence dwelling in emptiness. Translation risks lose the technical precision of "yin rang 'das chen po" as a specific classification. Preservation requirements note the phrase "stong pas gang du yang grub pa med par" establishes the view of emptiness without established existence anywhere.

Structural function introduces the sky expanse with its two divisions of sun-moon expanse and jewel-white expanse. View register presents the essence of dharmatā as unalterable self-liberation. Translation risks misinterpret "rin po che'i klong dkar po" as metaphorical rather than technical terminology. Preservation requirements ensure the spontaneous perfection of qualities and self-purification of causes and conditions remains distinct from lower vehicle concepts.

Structural function presents the rab 'byams sde through the essence of appearance known by mind and non-appearance known by natural state. View register classifies four types of vastness: external, internal, secret, and suchness. Translation risks conflate these categories without recognizing their hierarchical relationship. Preservation requirements maintain the three essential points of causelessness, conditionlessness, and non-establishment of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as foundational to the external vastness.

Structural function continues the external vastness exposition emphasizing the non-division of mind through absence of cause. View register asserts the natural state as spontaneously perfect great completion without partiality toward any vehicle. Translation risks obscure "gnas lugs ye rdzogs" as a specific technical classification. Preservation requirements note the phrase "gang yang ma spangs par yongs su rdzogs" establishes the non-rejection completion principle unique to dzogchen.

Structural function presents the secret vastness through recognizing obstacles to appearance as self-liberated pure nature. View register maintains the completion of memory and thought as dharmatā. Translation risks misrepresent "dran bsam rang dag" as mere purified thought rather than the technical process of thought recognizing its own nature. Preservation requirements ensure the distinction between outer and inner obstacles remains clear.

Structural function synthesizes the vastness categories into three divisions through the aspiration-arising great completion. View register presents the fourfold framework of view, meditation, conduct, and fruition. Translation risks conflate "bya spyod chos nyid du grol ba" with lower vehicle conduct concepts. Preservation requirements maintain the technical precision of "thob pa med pas ma thob pa rang la bzhag pa" as fruition without attainment.

Structural function concludes the action-free expanse through the principle of liberation without action. View register establishes "bya ba med pas grol bas grol" as the essential formulation. Translation risks render this as mere passivity rather than spontaneous liberation. Preservation requirements note this phrase encapsulates the entire klong dkar po section's essential meaning.

Structural function introduces the ornament expanse through appearances as mind-stream and emptiness free from grasping. View register presents the non-arising non-ceasing contemplation. Translation risks misinterpret "rgyan gyi klong" as decorative rather than functional ornament. Preservation requirements maintain the citation "mi skye mi 'gag cir mi dgongs" as canonical support.

Structural function presents the play expanse and dharmatā expanse through unceasing manifestation and unaltered self-arising. View register emphasizes the unity of appearance and knowledge. Translation risks conflate "rol pa'i klong" with ordinary play. Preservation requirements ensure the technical term "mthong shes gnyis su med pa" retains its precise meaning of non-dual view and knowledge.

Structural function transitions to the direct approach oral instruction section, establishing three teaching styles. View register presents the me btsa' analogy for hitting the essential point. Translation risks obscure "lam drang thad du smra ba" as merely straightforward rather than technically direct. Preservation requirements distinguish the three styles: scattered speech, conversational speech, and sutra self-commentary style.
