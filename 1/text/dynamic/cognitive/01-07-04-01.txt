[10086-10165]
Mind samaya (sems kyi dam tshig) outer's outer (phyi'i phyi): harmful mind abandoning (gnod sems spang ba). The outermost level of mental commitment is abandoning the harmful mind—the intention to harm others. Essence Meaning Aspect-Taken (snying po don phyogs blangs): mantra-holder vajra holder (sngags 'chang rdo rje 'chang), other self suffice (gzhan bdag chog), harm-doing mind hold (gnod sems 'dzin), leprosy body (mdze'i lus), cold touch (grang reg), body thousand-times five taken (lnga stong lus 'phrog), cold hell certain (grang dmyal nges). View register: harmful mind leads to severe consequences.

[Extended Analysis: Harmful Mind as Root Violation]
The harmful mind (gnod sems) is the root violation of samaya—the intention to cause harm to others, especially vajra siblings and guru. View register: intention as crucial in samaya. Translation risk: "harmful" suggesting only physical harm. Preservation: gnod sems includes mental, verbal, and physical harm—the intention itself violates samaya.

[Extended Analysis: Consequences of Harmful Mind]
The consequences listed—leprosy body, cold touch, body taken, cold hell—represent the karmic results of harmful intention. View register: consequences as natural results, not punishments. Translation risk: listing consequences as threats. Preservation: these are natural karmic results (rnam smin), not imposed penalties. Harmful mind naturally leads to suffering states.

[Extended Analysis: Mantra-Holder Vajra Holder]
The "mantra-holder vajra holder" who develops harmful mind falls into these sufferings. View register: even advanced practitioners subject to karma. Translation risk: suggesting failure of practice. Preservation: even those with high status fall if samaya is broken. This emphasizes the importance of samaya regardless of position.

[Extended Analysis: Outer Inner - Guru and Vajra Siblings]
Outer inner (phyi'i nang): guru vajra siblings harmful mind abandoning (bla rdo rje spun gnod sems spang ba). The next level of samaya is abandoning harmful mind specifically toward guru and vajra siblings. View register: specific commitments to spiritual community.

[Extended Analysis: Sky-Iron Fire Blazing]
Sky-Iron Fire Blazing (gnam lcags me 'bar) tantra citation: common object (thun mong gi yul), harm mind arise (gnod sems skyes), migrate world body ('gro ba'i lus), hundred three life cut (tshe brgya gsum gcod), sin share equal (sdig pa thun mong). View register: scriptural authority for consequences.

[Extended Analysis: Teaching Sign Hold Form Wrong]
Teaching sign hold form wrong (bstan pa'i rtags gzugs 'dzin log), mantra entered hundred-times (sngags la 'jug pa brgya). Wrong views about the teaching's form lead to breaking samaya even after entering mantra practice. View register: wrong view as dangerous as wrong action.

[Extended Analysis: Vajra Sibling Seven-Times, Lineage Guru Hundred-Times]
Vajra sibling seven-times (rdo rje spun bdun), lineage guru hundred-times (brgyud pa'i bla ma brgya), root guru hundred (rtsa ba'i bla ma brgya). Specific numbers indicating severity—harming vajra siblings requires seven-fold repair, lineage guru hundred-fold, root guru immeasurable. View register: hierarchy of commitment.

[Extended Analysis: Mantra Door Entered Empowerment]
Mantra door entered empowerment (sngags sgo 'jug pa'i dbang), aspect-ripen (phyogs smin). Once empowerment is received, aspects ripen into specific commitments. View register: empowerment creating binding commitment.

[Extended Analysis: Outer's Secret - Wrong-View Abandoning]
Outer's secret (phyi'i gsang): self-other established-view wrong-view arise abandoning (bdag gzhan 'dzin pa'i lta ba log par 'dzin spang). The secret level abandons wrong views about self and other. View register: secret as profound, not hidden.

[Extended Analysis: Great Arrangement Citation]
Great Arrangement (bkod pa chen po): self other hidden Dharma disparage wrong path (gsang chos bkag pa log lam), root samaya exceed (rtsa ba'i dam tshig 'das), earth-dwell fire suffering (sa gnas me sdug), long dwell (yun ring gnas), established-view wrong-view (lta ba 'dzin log), hell liberate not (dmyal ba grol dka'). View register: scriptural support for severity.

[10166-10470]
Mind inner's outer (nang gi phyi): conduct (spyod pa), inner (nang): meditate (sgom pa), secret (gsang): wrong view abandoning (log lta spang ba). Three levels of inner samaya. View register: progressive depth of commitment.

[Extended Analysis: Crystal House Stacked]
Crystal House Stacked (shel gyi khang brtsegs) tantra: view meditate conduct wrong (lta sgom spyod log), path wrong great (lam log che), being suffering (sems can sdug), mind ripen (sems smin). Wrong view, meditation, and conduct lead to wrong path and suffering.

[Extended Analysis: Secret's Three Outer]
Secret's three outer (gsang gsum phyi): view meditate conduct (lta sgom spyod), inner (nang): yi-dam deity (yi dam lha), secret (gsang): guru vajra siblings day-night mind (bla rdo rje spun nyin mtshan sems). The secret samaya encompasses all levels—view, meditation, conduct, deity practice, and constant mindfulness of guru and vajra siblings.

[Extended Analysis: Lotus Klong Citation]
Lotus Klong (padma klong): mind karma wander (sems las rgyu 'phyan), mind dharmas (sems chos), mind not-done degenerate (sems mi byed nyams), past ceased karma end (sngon chad las zad), uninterrupted suffering (bar chad med pa'i sdug). Degeneration of mind samaya leads to continuous suffering.

[Extended Analysis: Co-Arisen Near-Taken]
Co-Arisen Near-Taken (lhan cig nye 'dzin): actual-accomplish supreme desire (dngos grub mchog 'dod), yi-dam abandon not-do (yi dam btang mi byed), guru abandon actual-accomplish destroyed (bla ma btang dngos 'jig), other accomplish not-find (gzhan grub mi rnyed), Dharma promise (chos khas btags), guru samaya pledged (bla ma'i dam tshig bcag), mind virtue karma (sems dge sdig), self abandon actual-accomplish degenerates (rang btang dngos grub nyams). Abandoning yi-dam and guru destroys accomplishment.

[Extended Analysis: Supreme Trunk Samaya Arrangements]
Supreme Trunk Samaya Arrangements (dam tshig 'dus pa mchog gi sdong po): promises not transgressed (khas mi 'da'), guru commitments not broken (bla ma'i bka' mi 'gal), guru activities not wrong (bla ma'i mdzad pa mi 'khrul), body speech mind not stray Dharma (lus ngag yid chos la mi 'phyan), benefit beings (sems can don), respecting guru (bla ma gus), not transgressing samaya (dam mi 'da'), holding vajra bell (rdo rje dril bu 'dzin), substances suitable mantra (rdzas sngags mthun). Comprehensive summary of samaya commitments.

[Structural Synthesis: Complete Mind Samaya Framework]
This section (10086-10470) presents the complete framework for mind samaya—commitments at multiple levels from outer to secret. The architecture moves from abandoning harmful mind through proper conduct, meditation, and view, culminating in comprehensive samaya commitments. The view throughout is that samaya is essential for Vajrayana practice—breakage leads to severe consequences while maintenance leads to accomplishment. The translator must preserve the technical terminology—dam tshig (samaya), gnod sems (harmful mind), bla ma (guru), rdo rje spun (vajra siblings)—while conveying that these are functional commitments creating the conditions for realization, not arbitrary rules. The consequences listed are natural karmic results, not punishments imposed by external authority. The section emphasizes the guru-vajra sibling relationship as central, with specific gradations of severity for different violations. This is the ethical foundation without which tantric practice cannot succeed.
