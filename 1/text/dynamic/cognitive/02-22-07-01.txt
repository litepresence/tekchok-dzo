Bardo essence exposition. External objects appearing to internal mind as bardo state. From primordially pure expanse, all appearances as bardo. Basis-appearing as form bodies and wisdoms, the display of self-nature as pure dharmatā bardo. Deluded appearances as impure bardo of six migrations. Between pure and impure, the primordially pure expanse from which projection and reabsorption occurs. Ground-bardo as essential nature. Not post-mortem state but present moment's non-recognition. Preserve Dzogchen interpretation against literalist readings.
