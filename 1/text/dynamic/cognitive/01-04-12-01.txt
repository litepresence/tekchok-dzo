Madhyamaka analysis of non-existence: First, non-existence in meaning not established as cause of cessation. Mother Perfection of Wisdom Middle: Ultimately samsara also not, nirvana also not, emptiness also not, merely words expression taught.

Scriptural support: Samādhirāja Sutra—permanent and impermanent this extreme, existing and not existing called both extreme, thus both's extremes completely abandoned, knowledgeable center also not abiding. Ratnakūṭa Sutra: Tathāgata unborn Dharma, all dharmas Sugata like, childish intellect mark grasping so, world not existing dharmas practice. Root Wisdom citation: whatever dependent arising, ceasing not so arising not, cutting not so permanent not, coming not so going not, different meaning not meaning one not, elaboration near peace shown, complete Buddha speak this, supreme that homage.

Negated what not having, I what not negate, thus negation doing, accusation that you imputed. Structural function: Prasaṅgika via consequence (thal 'gyur) without autonomous positions. View register: freedom from all positions including emptiness as position. Translation risk: "not abiding" suggesting nihilistic absence rather than non-dwelling. Preservation: mi gnas as non-abiding, not non-existing.
