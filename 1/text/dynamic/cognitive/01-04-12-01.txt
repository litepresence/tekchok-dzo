[3100-3110]
Supreme mundane dharma stage: highest ordinary attainment before entering the path of seeing (mthong lam). This represents the peak of worldly spiritual accomplishment—the culmination of preparatory practices on the ordinary path. Structural function: establishing the final stage before transcendent realization. View register: gradual path framework where ordinary practice prepares for extraordinary breakthrough. The practitioner at this stage possesses unshakable samādhi (ting nge 'dzin mi g.yo ba)—concentration that cannot be disturbed by external circumstances or internal afflictions. Translation risk: "supreme mundane" suggesting inferiority to transcendent stages. Preservation: this is "supreme" among mundane stages, the necessary foundation for transcendence. The samādhi achieved here is called "worldly" but is already highly refined.

[Extended Analysis: Supreme Mundane Dharma Technical Details]
The supreme mundane dharma (jig rten chos mchog) is the ninth of the nine stages leading to the first bhūmi. At this stage, the practitioner has completed all preparatory practices: the four foundations of mindfulness (dran pa nye bar bzhag pa bzhi), the four right efforts (yang dag spong ba bzhi), the four bases of miraculous power (rdzu 'phrul gyi rkang pa bzhi), the five faculties (dbang po lnga), and the five powers (stobs lnga). View register: systematic preparation for direct perception of emptiness. Translation risk: these appearing as separate achievements rather than progressive refinement. Preservation: each builds on the previous—the faculties become powers through familiarization.

[Extended Analysis: Unshakable Samādhi]
The "unshakable samādhi" (mi g.yo ba'i ting nge 'dzin) achieved at this stage indicates profound stability of attention. Unlike earlier concentrations that can be disturbed by strong afflictions or circumstances, this samādhi remains steady. View register: samādhi as support for wisdom, not wisdom itself. Translation risk: "unshakable" suggesting permanence or attainment. Preservation: mi g.yo means "not moving" in the sense of not being disturbed—this is still conditioned, not the unconditioned liberation. The practitioner can maintain this concentration even in challenging circumstances.

[Extended Analysis: Critical Juncture]
This stage represents the critical juncture (gnad) between ordinary (so so skye bo) and noble ('phags pa) paths. The practitioner stands at the threshold—having exhausted the possibilities of the ordinary path, ready to enter the transcendent. View register: the transition not as crossing into a different realm but as recognition of what was always present. Translation risk: "threshold" suggesting two separate territories. Preservation: the distinction is between recognition and non-recognition, not ontological separation. The path of seeing reveals what the supreme mundane prepared for but could not yet directly perceive.

[Extended Analysis: Preparation for First Bhūmi]
The structural function of this stage is preparation for entering the first bodhisattva bhūmi (sa dang po). The practitioner has developed all necessary qualities: faith (dad pa), discipline (tshul khrims), learning (thos pa), generosity (sbyin pa), wisdom (shes rab)—yet these remain "ordinary" until the direct perception of emptiness. View register: bhūmi entry as recognition, not achievement. Translation risk: "first bhūmi" appearing as a place to arrive. Preservation: sa indicates ground or foundation—the first recognition that serves as basis for all subsequent development. The supreme mundane practitioner is like someone who has prepared all materials and is ready to build, but has not yet begun construction.

[Extended Analysis: Not Yet Noble]
The characterization as "not yet noble" (so so skye bo) indicates that despite supreme accomplishment, the practitioner has not yet achieved the direct realization that defines noble beings. View register: nobility as recognition of nature, not moral superiority. Translation risk: hierarchy appearing as value judgment. Preservation: 'phags pa means "transcendent" or "noble"—having transcended ordinary conceptual mind. The distinction is epistemological (how one knows) not ontological (what one is). Many bodhisattvas remain at supreme mundane for aeons, developing qualities before the breakthrough.

[Extended Analysis: Highest Ordinary Distinction]
The phrase "highest ordinary" (mtho so so skye bo) indicates the summit of what is possible without direct realization. All qualities are present—compassion, concentration, generosity, wisdom—yet they operate within conceptual framework. View register: conceptual accomplishment as genuine but limited. Translation risk: devaluing ordinary practice. Preservation: this is genuinely supreme among ordinary attainments, worthy of respect. The limitation is not in the qualities but in the mode of knowing—conceptual vs. direct. The transition to noble path does not discard these qualities but transforms their basis.

[3200-3210]
Path of meditation: second through tenth bhūmis (gsom lam, sa gnyis nas bcu'i bar). This represents the main practice period for bodhisattvas—the long path of familiarization after initial realization. Structural function: establishing the gradual purification process subsequent to direct seeing. View register: meditation path as deepening integration of what was seen, not new seeing. The path of seeing provides the first direct perception of emptiness; the path of meditation deepens and expands this realization through repeated familiarization. Translation risk: "meditation" suggesting sitting practice rather than continuous integration. Preservation: gsom lam means "path of cultivation/familiarization"—making the realization continuous and stable.

[Extended Analysis: Nine Stages of Gradual Purification]
The nine bhūmis from second to tenth represent nine stages of gradual purification (dag pa rim pa). Each bhūmi removes specific obscurations and develops specific qualities. Second bhūmi: stainless, pure ethics. Third: luminous, patience and forbearance. Fourth: radiating light, exertion. Fifth: difficult to conquer, samādhi. Sixth: clearly manifest, prajñā. Seventh: gone afar, skillful means. Eighth: immovable, aspiration prayers. Ninth: excellent wisdom, power. Tenth: cloud of dharma, primordial wisdom. View register: bhūmis as natural unfoldment, not forced development. Translation risk: bhūmis appearing as hierarchical achievements. Preservation: each bhūmi represents the natural expression of realization at that stage, like a tree naturally producing fruit when mature.

[Extended Analysis: Habitual Tendencies Removal]
The path of meditation primarily addresses habitual tendencies (bag chags)—the deep patterns of ignorance that persist even after direct realization. While the path of seeing removes intellectual obscurations, the path of meditation removes emotional and habitual obscurations. View register: tendencies as removable through familiarization, not permanent stains. Translation risk: "removal" suggesting something solid being taken away. Preservation: bag chags are patterns of energy/awareness that naturally dissolve when not reinforced. The path of meditation is like allowing muddy water to settle—clearing happens naturally when not disturbed.

[Extended Analysis: Deepening Integration]
The phrase "deepening integration" (yongs su 'dris pa) indicates that the path of meditation makes the initial realization stable, continuous, and pervasive. What was glimpsed on the path of seeing becomes the continuous mode of experience. View register: deepening as natural expansion, not accumulation. Translation risk: "deepening" suggesting something getting bigger or better. Preservation: deepening means more continuous recognition, not "more" realization. The realization itself does not change—it is the same emptiness from first bhūmi to buddhahood—but its continuity and pervasiveness expand.

[Extended Analysis: Main Practice Period]
The characterization as "main practice period" indicates that most bodhisattvas spend the longest time on this path. While the path of preparation may take many lifetimes, and the path of seeing is instantaneous, the path of meditation spans countless aeons as the bodhisattva develops qualities for the benefit of beings. View register: duration as expression of compassion, not delay. Translation risk: length appearing as obstacle. Preservation: the long duration allows bodhisattvas to develop infinite skillful means for helping beings—this is not delay but maturation. The bodhisattva could achieve buddhahood quickly but chooses to remain to benefit others.

[Extended Analysis: Not New Seeing]
The clarification that this is "not new seeing" indicates that the path of meditation does not provide new realizations of emptiness—the first bhūmi already saw emptiness directly. What develops are the qualities that flow from this realization: compassion, power, skillful means. View register: realization as single, qualities as manifold. Translation risk: "not new" suggesting deficiency. Preservation: the realization is complete at first bhūmi, but its expression unfolds. Like the sun fully risen but its warmth continuing to spread, the realization is complete but its effects continue to manifest.

[3250-3260]
Path of no-more-learning: complete enlightenment, full buddhahood (mi slob lam, rdzogs pa'i byang chub, sangs rgyas). This represents the culmination of the entire path—not nothing to learn but nothing to cultivate. Structural function: establishing the final attainment where all obscurations are removed and all qualities are fully manifest. View register: buddhahood as recognition complete, not achievement earned. Translation risk: "no-more-learning" suggesting stagnation or finality. Preservation: mi slob means no need for further cultivation—the natural state is fully revealed, not something new attained.

[Extended Analysis: Complete Enlightenment]
Complete enlightenment (rdzogs pa'i byang chub) indicates that both obscurations—the afflictive obscuration (nyon sgrib) and the cognitive obscuration (shes sgrib)—have been completely removed. What remains is the natural state fully manifest. View register: enlightenment as removal of veils, not addition of qualities. Translation risk: "complete" suggesting final accumulation. Preservation: rdzogs pa means perfect or complete in the sense of nothing lacking—like a full moon, not "more full" than three-quarter moon. The qualities were always present, now fully unobscured.

[Extended Analysis: Full Buddhahood]
Full buddhahood (sangs rgyas) is explained etymologically: sangs means purified of obscurations, rgyas means expanded or blossomed in qualities. View register: purification and blossoming as simultaneous, not sequential. Translation risk: etymology appearing as mere wordplay. Preservation: the Tibetan etymology is meaningful—purification allows natural expansion. Like removing clouds allows sun to shine, removing obscurations allows qualities to manifest naturally. The buddha is not "more" than a bodhisattva—just unobscured.

[Extended Analysis: End of Path]
The phrase "end of path" (lam gyi mtha') indicates that the path has accomplished its purpose. This is not cessation but completion—the traveler has arrived. View register: path as means, not end; arrival as beginning of activity. Translation risk: "end" suggesting termination. Preservation: mtha' means both end and perfection—the path is perfected, not stopped. The buddha continues "activity" (spyod pa) but without the distinction of path and result—all is spontaneous expression of the natural state.

[Extended Analysis: Effortless Abiding]
Effortless abiding (rtsol med du gnas pa) characterizes buddhahood. While earlier paths required effort (rtsol ba)—deliberate cultivation and practice—the buddha's activity is spontaneous. View register: effortlessness as natural expression, not passivity. Translation risk: "effortless" suggesting inactivity. Preservation: rtsol med means without deliberate effort, not without activity. The buddha's compassion and activity are continuous and powerful but spontaneous, like a fire giving heat without deciding to.

[Extended Analysis: Three Kayas as Complete Manifestation]
The three kayas (sku gsum)—dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya—represent the complete manifestation of enlightenment. Dharmakāya: empty essence, the nature of mind for the buddha's own experience. Sambhogakāya: luminous nature, enjoyment body for high bodhisattvas. Nirmāṇakāya: compassionate display, emanation body for ordinary beings. View register: three kayas as simultaneous aspects, not sequential emanations. Translation risk: three kayas appearing as separate bodies. Preservation: sku gsum are three aspects of single enlightened nature, like one sun with heat, light, and color. The buddha simultaneously abides in essence, enjoys natural expression, and manifests for beings.

[Extended Analysis: Nothing to Cultivate]
The phrase "nothing to cultivate" (bsgom du med pa) indicates that the buddha has nothing to develop—no qualities lacking, no obscurations remaining. View register: completion as natural perfection, not forced achievement. Translation risk: "nothing to cultivate" suggesting anti-practice. Preservation: this describes the result, not the path. On the path, cultivation is essential; at the result, cultivation is transcended—not rejected but naturally complete. Like a tree grown to full height, it does not stop growing but needs no cultivation.

[Extended Analysis: Dharmakāya as Own Experience]
Dharmakāya (chos sku) represents the buddha's own experience—the empty, luminous nature of mind as realized by the buddha for themselves. This is not accessible to others directly. View register: dharmakāya as basis, not isolated self-enjoyment. Translation risk: dharmakāya appearing as selfish. Preservation: chos sku is the nature of phenomena—this is what the buddha realizes, and all phenomena share this nature. The buddha's "own experience" is simultaneously the nature of all experience.

[Extended Analysis: Sambhogakāya for Bodhisattvas]
Sambhogakāya (longs sku) appears to tenth-bhūmi bodhisattvas in pure lands—glorious, adorned, teaching the vast dharma. View register: sambhogakāya as communication, not exclusive enjoyment. Translation risk: "enjoyment" suggesting hedonism. Preservation: longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku means "complete enjoyment body"—complete enjoyment of dharma, not sensory pleasure. This kaya serves as the basis for the nirmāṇakāya and communicates with advanced practitioners.

[Extended Analysis: Nirmāṇakāya for Ordinary Beings]
Nirmāṇakāya (sprul sku) manifests in ordinary realms in forms appropriate to benefit beings—human, animal, even inanimate forms. View register: emanation as compassionate skill, not limitation. Translation risk: nirmāṇakāya appearing as "lesser" than other kayas. Preservation: sprul sku is the activity aspect—all buddha activity is emanation. The historical Buddha Shakyamuni was a nirmāṇakāya, demonstrating that this is not inferior but the aspect that directly benefits ordinary beings.

[Structural Synthesis: Five Paths Complete Framework]
This section (3100-3260) presents the culmination of the five paths framework from supreme mundane through buddhahood. The architecture traces the progression from highest ordinary attainment, through the transcendent paths of seeing and meditation, to final enlightenment. The view throughout is that the path is progressive but the result is recognition of what was always present. The five paths represent stages of recognition, not acquisition of new qualities. The translator must preserve the technical precision of the bhūmi system while maintaining that buddhahood is not achievement but complete unobscured presence. The three kayas are not separate bodies but simultaneous aspects of single enlightened nature—essence, enjoyment, and emanation corresponding to the buddha's own experience, communication with advanced practitioners, and manifestation for ordinary beings.
