This section presents Thögal practical instructions through a structured progression from theoretical foundation to embodied technique. The opening verses establish the view—dharmatā's self-appearance as the basis, awareness wisdom undistracted, settled in a non-grasping condition. The imagery of never-setting victory banners, unchanging lamps, and five lights without waxing or waning operate as technical designations for specific visionary phenomena rather than poetic flourishes. The structural function moves from establishing the view through contemplative verses to detailed body and mind techniques, culminating in experiential descriptions of the path's stages.

The register throughout maintains Dzogchen Thögal technical terminology: dharmatā's self-appearance (chos nyid rang snang), awareness wisdom (rig pa ye shes), non-grasping state ('dzin med ngang), pure wisdom's self-appearance (ye shes dag pa'i rang snang). These compounds must be preserved as single conceptual units. The body techniques reference specific postures—resonance (gdangs), settling postures ('dug stangs), bindu accumulation (thig le bskyil), light expansion and gathering ('od yas sdud). The wind practices involve binding the related wind ('brel ldan bsdams pa) and distinguishing entry activities through extremities.

Translation risks emerge in several domains. The phrase "wish-fulfilling jewel" (nor bu rin chen bdud rtsi) combines two distinct technical terms—jewel and nectar—that operate as a compound designation for a specific visionary object. The expanse-lamp (dbyings kyi sgron ma) appears as a technical term requiring preservation. The instructions for "examine without distraction, without grasping clarity" (ma yengs gsal 'dzin med par brtag) present a three-part technical instruction that must maintain its sequential logic. The commentary on appearances existing internally rather than externally in space challenges common Thögal interpretations, requiring careful handling to preserve the author's specific understanding without imposing external frameworks.

The experiential progression described—from the first taking up through completion—follows a precise developmental arc. The similes of bird flight, bee circling nectar, and mirage establish recognizable stages without reducing them to mere metaphor. The descriptions of bindu, light, and kāya appearances maintain technical specificity while acknowledging their illusory nature. The final integration emphasizes that day and night become indistinguishable, establishing the completion of the practice. The structural preservation of this progression—from preliminary recognition through various stages to final stability—must remain intact to transmit the practical instructions accurately.
