This section presents Thögal practical instructions through a structured progression from theoretical foundation to embodied technique. The opening verses establish the view—dharmatā's self-appearance as the basis, awareness wisdom undistracted, settled in a non-grasping condition. The imagery of never-setting victory banners, unchanging lamps, and five lights without waxing or waning operate as technical designations for specific visionary phenomena rather than poetic flourishes. The structural function moves from establishing the view through contemplative verses to detailed body and mind techniques, culminating in experiential descriptions of the path's stages.

The register throughout maintains Dzogchen Thögal technical terminology: dharmatā's self-appearance (chos nyid rang snang), awareness wisdom (rig pa ye shes), non-grasping state ('dzin med ngang), pure wisdom's self-appearance (ye shes dag pa'i rang snang). These compounds must be preserved as single conceptual units. The body techniques reference specific postures—resonance (gdangs), settling postures ('dug stangs), bindu accumulation (thig le bskyil), light expansion and gathering ('od yas sdud). The wind practices involve binding the related wind ('brel ldan bsdams pa) and distinguishing entry activities through extremities.

Translation risks emerge in several domains. The phrase "wish-fulfilling jewel" (nor bu rin chen bdud rtsi) combines two distinct technical terms—jewel and nectar—that operate as a compound designation for a specific visionary object. The expanse-lamp (dbyings kyi sgron ma) appears as a technical term requiring preservation. The instructions for "examine without distraction, without grasping clarity" (ma yengs gsal 'dzin med par brtag) present a three-part technical instruction that must maintain its sequential logic. The commentary on appearances existing internally rather than externally in space challenges common Thögal interpretations, requiring careful handling to preserve the author's specific understanding without imposing external frameworks.

The experiential progression described—from the first taking up through completion—follows a precise developmental arc. The similes of bird flight, bee circling nectar, and mirage establish recognizable stages without reducing them to mere metaphor. The descriptions of bindu, light, and kāya appearances maintain technical specificity while acknowledging their illusory nature. The final integration emphasizes that day and night become indistinguishable, establishing the completion of the practice. The structural preservation of this progression—from preliminary recognition through various stages to final stability—must remain intact to transmit the practical instructions accurately.

This subsection details the technical implementation of Thögal body practices with precise anatomical and energetic instructions. The body's crucial point operates through resonance (gdangs), establishing a vibrational foundation for the practice. Wisdom settling postures (ye shes 'dug stangs) remain unchanged, indicating specific physical configurations that support the visionary process. The bindu accumulation involves churning (dkrugs) to accomplish results, while light practices expand and gather. These techniques form an integrated system where physical posture, energetic manipulation, and visionary experience interdepend.

The wind techniques present particularly dense technical instructions. Binding the related wind ('brel ldan bsdams pa) establishes the energetic foundation, while distinguishing entry activities through extremities (mtha' yis dbye) suggests subtle work with the body's peripheral channels. The transformation of that wind and exhaustion of karma-wind (las rlung zad) indicate a precise process of energetic refinement. The mention of confused perception's arrangement ('khrul pa'i sdeb) suggests a technical reference to how ordinary perception structures itself, requiring careful preservation.

The crucial points of awareness and expanse present specialized techniques. Awareness's crucial point involves projection and lifting (dbyung ba, bskyil), releasing into space. The expanse's crucial point involves gathering and drawing in (bsdus, dgug), combined with the body's radiance. These techniques operate on the interface between individual awareness and universal expanse, requiring precise technical language to preserve their function.

This extended passage presents the progressive stages of Thögal practice through the Sengé Tsal Dzogchen tantra. The structural function establishes a developmental trajectory from initial engagement through various experiential thresholds to final stability. The similes serve as recognitions markers for practitioners—bird in flight indicating immediate omnipresence, bee circling nectar showing engagement without dispersion, mirage-like appearance establishing illusory nature. Each stage builds upon the previous, with the instruction to "not be distracted from its meaning" recurring as the essential practice element.

The register maintains specific Dzogchen terminology: self-appearance of awareness (rang snang rig pa), expanse-awareness (dbyings rig), and the various visionary phenomena—bindu, light, kāya appearances. The description of kaya appearances as like illusions and rainbows establishes their empty nature while acknowledging their vivid presence. The final simile of the fox's eyes without day or night indicates the completion stage where temporal distinctions dissolve.

Preservation concerns center on the developmental logic. The progression from coarse to subtle, from dispersed to gathered, from dualistic to non-dual must remain clear. The technical descriptions of appearances—thig le, light, kāyas—require consistent terminology to maintain their distinct references. The commentary notes that while these appear externally in space, they actually exist internally as the body's pure light channels, a crucial distinction for understanding the practice's somatic foundation.

[8911-8937]

This subsection addresses the ontological status of visionary appearances in Thögal practice, presenting a sophisticated analysis that challenges superficial interpretations. The structural function moves from common misconceptions to authoritative correction, establishing the internal nature of visionary phenomena through logical reasoning and scriptural citation. The author's voice emerges clearly as an experienced practitioner asserting a specific understanding against prevalent views.

The register operates in the domain of Dzogchen epistemology and phenomenology: external space (phyi'i bar snang), internal channels (nang lus kyi 'od rtsa), pure channels (dag pa), heart center (snying ga), all-pervasive resonance (kun khyab kyi gdangs). The mirror simile—seeing one's face reflected—serves as the primary analogy for understanding how internal phenomena appear as if external. The technical description of the heart's resonance radiating all-pervasively establishes the energetic basis for visionary experience.

Translation risks are significant in this passage. The distinction between "appearing to exist externally" and "actually existing internally" requires precise handling to avoid either reifying the visions as purely subjective or locating them in external space. The phrase "at this time of ground-appearance dawning" (da lta gzhi snang shar ba'i dus) refers to a specific stage in the practice where the ground of being manifests as appearance. The description of awareness knowing its own face and settling in its own resonance establishes a reflexive recognition that must be preserved without imposing Western psychological categories.

[8938-8963]

The concluding section integrates practical instructions with scriptural authority, establishing the Sengé Tsal Dzogchen tantra as the source of validation. The structural function moves from personal experience to textual authority, demonstrating that the internal nature of visionary appearances aligns with authoritative teachings. The citation serves not as proof-texting but as confirmation of experiential understanding.

The register maintains Dzogchen technical vocabulary: kaya appearances (sku yi snang ba), field appearances (yul gyi snang ba), mirror with clear characteristics (me long mtshan nyid gsal ba), dharmatā's field (chos nyid yul gyi nam mkha'), awareness's appearance kāya (rig pa'i snang ba sku ru shar). The verse emphasizes that these appearances are not external field appearances but manifestations of one's own condition, seen through pure perception.

Preservation requires maintaining the relationship between the practical instructions and their scriptural basis without collapsing the distinction between personal experience and textual authority. The final verses on the greatness of realization, understanding, and experience establish the soteriological significance of the practice while maintaining the technical specificity of the instructions. The reference to "Dorjé Lukgyü" and "inconceivable partial kāyas" grounds the practice in specific tantric sources, requiring preservation of these technical references.

[8964-8969]

This brief conclusion acknowledges the intelligibility of the preceding instructions while maintaining appropriate modesty. The structural function provides closure to the extensive practical section, noting that intelligent individuals will understand while acknowledging the possibility of straightforward comprehension. The reference to "body appearances" (lus snang) for ease of understanding suggests a pedagogical accommodation without compromising the deeper internal understanding.

The register shifts slightly to include pedagogical terminology: intelligible (go rgyu), intelligent ones (blo gro can), easy to understand (rtogs sla). The mention of explaining to the deluded for ease of understanding (rmongs pa rnams la rtogs sla ba'i phyir) indicates the author's awareness of different capacities among practitioners. The final note that internal understanding follows the previous pattern maintains consistency with the established view.
