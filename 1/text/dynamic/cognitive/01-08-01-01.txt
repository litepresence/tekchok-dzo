Sevenfold ground nature general exposition. Rigpa's primordial abiding through seven ways of natural recognition. Three principal divisions: brief presentation of seven aspects, demonstrating conceptual fixations fundamentally faulty, establishing non-dual recognition of primordial purity and unceasing display as authentic tradition. Seven aspects: basis primordially pure from beginning, spontaneously present with qualities complete, uncertain and indeterminate, certain and established as actual basis, transformable into anything, accepting anything that arises, various manifold multiplicity. Seven views seeing limited aspects of single primordial purity, each perceiver accepting own recognition as complete. Self-arisen wisdom transcends conceptual fabrication, not asserting existent or non-existent. Great sphere free from elaborations: primordially pure. Unceasing display: natural expression spontaneously possessing qualities like sun and rays. Uncertain: nature not established singularly, freedom from extremes. Certain: abides without change. Transformable: naturally appears as whatever manifests. Accepting: all phenomena arise equally from awareness. Multiplicity: appears without ceasing, naturally variegated. Thalgyur and Klongdrukpa citations establishing sevenfold manner.
