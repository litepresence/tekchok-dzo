[13104-13431]
Gandharva mind entering nearby, seeking body, manner of coming. The consciousness seeking rebirth (gandharva, dri za'i sems) enters from the bardo state. Father and Mother joining (pha ma 'phrad pa) dissolving in wisdom-space (ye shes kyi dbyings su yal), from mother's birth passage (ma'i skye go) entering. View register: conception as energetic process, not merely biological.

[Extended Analysis: Father's White Essence]
Father's white essence (pha'i dkar thig) size of mustard seed (yungs kar tsam), clear small eye (mig chung gsal) like quicksilver (dngul chu lta bu), absorbed into mother's red essence (ma'i dmar thig) lineage channel (rigs rtsa). The white bindu from father meets red bindu from mother in the channel of conception. View register: conception as meeting of essences. Translation risk: biological literalism. Preservation: this describes the subtle energetic process—white and red essences, channels, not merely sperm and egg.

[Extended Analysis: Blood and Milk Mixed]
In mother's womb (ma'i lhums na) like blood and milk mixed (khrag dang 'o ma 'dres pa lta bu), becoming one (gcig tu 'gyur). The mixture of red and white essences creates the basis for embryo formation. View register: alchemical union creating new being. Translation risk: literal blood and milk. Preservation: the simile indicates mixture and coagulation—substances blending to form something new. This is the bindu-mandala of conception.

[Extended Analysis: Four Elements Empty]
Body formation support (lus kyi rten): four elements empty (byung ba bzhi stong), space like sky abiding (nam mkha' lta bu'i dbyings gnas). The embryo forms within the spaciousness of the womb, supported by the elements in their subtle form. View register: body arising from space and elements. Translation risk: elements appearing solid. Preservation: the elements are "empty" (stong)—subtle, not yet manifest as solid matter. Space provides the container.

[Extended Analysis: Parents' Afflictions and Channel Leaves' Wind]
Parents' self-nature afflictions (pha ma rang bzhin nyon mongs) and channels' leaves' wind (rtsa lo'i rlung), desire-mind moved ('dod chags yid 'gul). The parents' emotional and energetic states influence conception. View register: conception as influenced by parents' consciousness. Translation risk: determinism or blame. Preservation: this describes conditions, not blame. Parents' states create the energetic environment for the entering consciousness.

[Extended Analysis: Channel-Abode's Letter Wind Self-Sound YAM]
Channel-abode's (gnas kyi) letter wind (yi ge'i rlung) self-sound YAM (yam gyi rang sgra), fire desire blazing (me 'dod 'bar). The sound YAM represents the fire element and desire energy activating. View register: elemental sounds as energetic catalysts. Translation risk: literal sound or magic. Preservation: YAM is the seed syllable of fire—its "sound" is the vibration of elemental energy activating in the conception process.

[Extended Analysis: RAM Sound Moves, Blazing Changing Appearance]
RAM sound moves (ram gyi sgra 'gul), blazing changing appearance ('bar snang 'gyur). RAM represents the fire element's activation, transforming the energetic environment. View register: elemental progression in conception. Translation risk: syllables as magical formulas. Preservation: RAM is the fire syllable; its activation continues the elemental process begun by YAM. This is energetic description, not incantation.

[Extended Analysis: Desire Becoming Attached]
Desire becoming attached ('dod chags chags), desire cause and attached condition joined ('dod rgyu chags rkyen zung 'jug). The entering consciousness experiences desire and attachment, creating the link to the new existence. View register: attachment binding consciousness to rebirth. Translation risk: moral judgment on desire. Preservation: this describes the process, not condemns it. Desire and attachment create the conditions for embodiment.

[Extended Analysis: KHAM Sound and Embracing]
Entering water desire (chu 'dod 'jug), looking at one another (gcig gcig lta), smiling ('dzum), embracing ('khrig pa), attached by KHAM sound (kham gyi sgra yis chags). KHAM represents the water element and sexual union. View register: conception as complete process including attraction. Translation risk: erotic literalism or prudish avoidance. Preservation: this describes the natural process—attraction, union, conception—in terms of elemental energies (water) and consciousness.

[Extended Analysis: Embracing Sense-Faculties Joined]
Embracing sense-faculties joined ('khrig dbang po 'dzoms), earth stability of body (sa lus brtan pa), bliss experienced (bde ba myong), SAM sound arises (sam gyi sgra 'byung). SAM represents earth element and stability—the embryo formed, sense faculties developing, bliss of embodiment experienced. View register: embodiment as blissful stabilization. Translation risk: bliss suggesting pleasure only. Preservation: bde ba includes satisfaction of embodiment—the relief of finding a body after bardo wandering.

[Extended Analysis: Mother's Lineage Five Channels Twisted]
Mother's lineage five channels twisted (ma'i rigs rtsa lnga 'khyil), moon-time seven-day period becoming (zla ba'i dus bdun 'gyur). The channels of the mother's lineage entwine, creating the matrix for development. View register: channel entwinement creating body structure. Translation risk: anatomical confusion. Preservation: 'khyil means coiled or twisted—the channels intertwine to create the subtle body structure. The seven-day periods mark developmental stages.

[Extended Analysis: Red Like Iron Hook Drawing]
Red like iron hook drawing (lcags kyu 'gugs pa lta bu'i dmar po), wind power possessing (rlung gi stobs yod). The red essence draws the consciousness, like a magnet draws iron. View register: magnetic attraction of embodiment. Translation risk: mechanical determinism. Preservation: the red essence has "wind power" (rlung gi stobs)—energetic attraction. This is subtle energetic process, not mechanical causation.

[Extended Analysis: Father's Essence Through Vertebrae]
Father's essence cause's self-nature (pha'i thig le rgyu rang bzhin) from crown drawn (dbu nas b drangs), like iron gathering in magnet (lcags g.yu la 'dus pa ltar). Father's white essence draws father's consciousness, pulling it down through the central channel. View register: paternal lineage essence drawing consciousness. Translation risk: gender determinism. Preservation: this describes the energetic process—the father's essence line draws the entering consciousness through the subtle body.

[Extended Analysis: Twenty-Eight Vertebrae and White Channel-Path]
Father's twenty-eight vertebrae passed through (cha brgyad phyed dang bzhi'i sgal pa), white channel-path emerged from white shell-like cavity (dkar rtsa dung ltar dkar ba'i klong nas 'thon). The consciousness descends through the spine's thirty-three vertebrae (Tibetan system counts differently), emerging through the channel. View register: descent through central channel. Translation risk: anatomical literalism. Preservation: this describes the subtle body anatomy—the central channel (rtsa dbu ma) and the process of consciousness embodiment.

[Extended Analysis: Seven Days Four Times in Womb]
Seven days four times in mother's womb (ma'i lhums na bdun bzhi), body's basis held (lus kyi gzhi bzung), son bodhicitta white arising (byang sems bu dkar 'byung). The embryo develops through four seven-day periods, establishing the body basis, with the white bodhicitta (male essence) arising. View register: developmental stages in womb. Translation risk: precise timing literalism. Preservation: the seven-day periods are general markers—development proceeds in stages. The "son bodhicitta" indicates male gender formation.

[Extended Analysis: Vajra Channel-Base Great Bliss Path]
Vajra channel-base (rdo rje rtsa gzhi) great bliss path (bde ba chen po'i lam) opened (bye), navel bliss poured (lte bai' bde 'bab), tip bliss ripened (rtse bde smin), directly emerging to mouth (mcher 'byung), mother's lineage channel nose inside red tone absorbed (ma rigs rtsa sna nang dmar skad 'jug). The development of the subtle body channels—vajra (central), navel, tip (crown)—with bliss and the absorption of maternal essence. View register: subtle body formation. Translation risk: anatomical confusion. Preservation: these are subtle body channels forming, with energetic (bliss) and essence (red/white) exchanges.

[Extended Analysis: Womb Mixture and Two Lineages]
Womb like blood and milk mixed, one absorbed into one (lhums khrag 'o ma 'dres gcig tu gcig zos), two lineages possessing (rigs gnyis yod). The embryo contains both lineages—paternal and maternal—united. View register: dual lineage inheritance. Translation risk: literal blood and milk. Preservation: the mixture represents the union of lineages, the "two possessing" indicates both contribute to the new being.

[Extended Analysis: Lineage Five's Power Drawing Consciousness]
Lineage five's power (rigs lnga'i stobs), father's consciousness drawn inside (pha'i rnam shes nang du b drangs). The power of the five families (Buddha, Vajra, Ratna, Padma, Karma) draws the consciousness into embodiment. View register: five family energies attracting consciousness. Translation risk: mystical determinism. Preservation: the five family energies are always present; their configuration attracts appropriate consciousness. This is energetic correspondence, not compulsion.

[Extended Analysis: Free from Attachment by Vomit]
Later free from attachment (phyis chags bral), going by vomit (brgyal nas 'gro). The embryo eventually detaches from initial attachment, moving through developmental stages. View register: attachment naturally releasing. Translation risk: literal vomiting. Preservation: brgyal means detachment or release—the initial strong attachment naturally loosens as development proceeds.

[Extended Analysis: Mother's Lineage Pulling and Bliss Contentment]
Mother whatever lineage pulling-possessing (ma gang yin rigs drangs yod), bliss contentment not-knowing (bde yid bde mi shes). The maternal lineage influences development; the fetus experiences bliss but doesn't recognize it. View register: fetal experience without recognition. Translation risk: fetal consciousness exaggerated. Preservation: the fetus experiences (myong) but doesn't know (shes)—there is consciousness but no self-awareness.

[Extended Analysis: Cause-Condition Non-Dual Known]
Desire-attachment cause-condition arisen ('dod chags rgyu rkyen 'byung), desire and attachment two, cause and condition two held ('dod chags gnyis rgyu rkyen gnyis bzung), existence body's basis wind holds (srid pa'i lus gzhi rlung 'dzin), cause-condition non-dual known (rgyu rkyen gnyis med shes), bliss and great bliss result (bde dang bde chen 'bras). The completion of embodiment—cause and condition unite non-dually, wind holds the body, bliss results. View register: completion of embodiment process. Translation risk: dualistic language confusing non-duality. Preservation: gnyis med shes means knowing the non-duality—the apparent two (cause and condition) are known as one in essence.

[Extended Analysis: Body and Wisdom's Result Rolled]
Body and wisdom's result (lus ye shes 'bras bu) rolled (longs). The new being is the result of body (material) and wisdom (consciousness) united. View register: embodiment as union of matter and mind. Translation risk: dualistic separation. Preservation: lus and ye shes are united—this is not mind-body dualism but their interdependence. "Rolled" (longs) suggests the completed form.

[Extended Analysis: One Night in Mother's Womb]
Mother's womb one night's night (ma'i lhums zhag gcig gi mtshan mo), father-mother cause-condition outer cause (pha ma rgyu rkyen phyi rgyu). The conception process summarized—one night (a phase) in the womb, the outer causes being parents' union. View register: conception as momentary in ultimate view, extended in conventional. Translation risk: "one night" literalizing. Preservation: zhag gcig can mean one day/night cycle or simply a period—the process takes time but is ultimately momentary in terms of consciousness transition.

[Structural Synthesis: Complete Gandharva Entry Framework]
This section (13104-13431) presents the complete framework for consciousness entering the womb—the gandharva seeking rebirth. The architecture moves from bardo consciousness through conception to embryonic development, detailing the energetic, elemental, and subtle body processes. The view throughout is that conception is not merely biological but involves consciousness, elemental energies, subtle channels, and karmic conditions. The translator must preserve the technical terminology—thig le (bindu), rlung (wind), rtsa (channel)—while conveying that this is subtle body physiology, not crude materialism. The process involves YAM, RAM, KHAM, SAM sounds representing elements; the seven-day developmental periods; the union of paternal and maternal lineages; and the eventual formation of a new embodied being. This is Dzogchen's detailed phenomenology of rebirth—neither materialist reduction nor mystical obscurantism, but precise description of the embodied process.

[Comprehensive Gandharva Entry Synthesis]
Structural function establishes complete rebirth phenomenology from bardo consciousness through conception to embryonic development. Framework details energetic, elemental, and subtle body processes involved in embodiment. Bardo consciousness (gandharva) driven by karma seeks appropriate womb. YAM, RAM, KHAM, SAM sounds represent elements. Seven-day developmental periods mark progression. Paternal and maternal lineages unite through subtle channels. Five family energies draw consciousness. Result: new embodied being formed through union of matter and wisdom.

View register operates within Dzogchen / Rebirth / Subtle Body framework. Conception involves not merely biology but consciousness, elemental energies, channels, and karmic conditions. This is subtle body physiology—technical terminology preserved: thig le (bindu), rlung (wind), rtsa (channel). Neither materialist reduction nor mystical obscurantism but precise phenomenology of embodiment.

Translation risks include literalizing "one night" or reducing process to biology. Terms must convey subtle body processes: five family energies as configurations attracting consciousness, not compulsion. Vomit as detachment, not literal expulsion. Bliss experienced but not recognized by fetus—consciousness present without self-awareness.

Preservation priorities center on maintaining technical precision of subtle body physiology. Seven-day periods mark developmental stages. Elemental sounds (YAM, RAM, KHAM, SAM) represent earth, fire, water, space entering channel-wheels. Cause and condition unite non-dually—apparent duality known as one essence. Body and wisdom united, not separate.

Extended recognition: This section provides Dzogchen's detailed account of rebirth—consciousness seeking embodiment through karmic attraction, elemental integration, and subtle body formation. The gandharva represents bardo consciousness with karmic momentum. Womb selection based on energetic correspondence between five family configurations and consciousness affinities. Embryonic development follows precise subtle body anatomy.

The process demonstrates dependent origination at subtle level—consciousness, elements, channels, and lineage all interdependent. Not linear causation but mutual arising. Father's white bindu and mother's red bindu unite in central channel, with five family energies determining configuration. New being forms through this union—not creation ex nihilo but transformation of energies.

Final recognition: Complete rebirth framework established. From bardo seeking womb through elemental integration to embodied formation, all aspects covered. Consciousness, karma, elements, channels, and lineages interweave in dependent origination. This is Dzogchen's phenomenology of embodiment—precise, technical, yet pointing to emptiness of inherent existence.
