Gandharva consciousness seeking embodiment enters through mother's birth passage as father and mother join in union. Father's white essence, clear and small like quicksilver, absorbs into mother's red essence in the lineage channel. Like blood and milk mixed, the two essences become one, forming the basis of the body. This process unfolds within empty space of the four elements, like sky abiding. Parents' self-nature afflictions and channel leaves' wind move the mind of desire. Channel-abode's letter wind resonates as YAM, fire desire blazes forth. RAM sound moves, blazing and transforming. Desire becomes attached, cause and condition joined, entering through water element desire. Mutual gazing, smiling, embracing, KHAM sound resonates. Sense faculties joined through embrace, body's earth stability brings bliss experienced, SAM sound arises. Mother's lineage five channels twisted become seven-day periods, red like iron hook drawing. Wind power draws father's essence from crown, passing through twenty-eight vertebrae, emerging through white channel-path. This establishes the body basis in mother's womb through four seven-day periods, generating white bodhicitta in the son. View register: conception as energetic process of consciousness embodiment through elemental and subtle body channels. Translation risk: reducing to biological literalism. Preservation: maintain subtle body physiology framework of essences, channels, winds, and elemental sounds.

Vajra channel-base opens the path of great bliss, navel bliss poured in, tip bliss ripened, directly emerging to mouth, absorbed into mother's lineage channel nose inside red tone. Like blood and milk mixed in womb, one absorbed into one, possessing two lineages. Lineage five's power draws father's consciousness inside. Later free from attachment, going by detachment. Mother whatever lineage pulling-possessing, bliss experienced without contentment recognition. This arises from desire-attachment cause and condition. Desire and attachment as two, held as cause and condition two, existence body's basis held by wind, cause-condition known as non-dual, bliss and great bliss result. Body and wisdom's result rolled together. Thus one night's phase in mother's womb, father-mother cause-condition as outer cause become one, inner non-mixed like mustard seed in pod, holding son's wind-mind, bound by four elements' binding like precious jewel net, without separation opportunity. This gives rise to life not abiding without food of elements at body completion time. View register: embodiment as union of dual lineages through subtle energetic process. Translation risk: interpreting non-dual as merger rather than interdependence. Preservation: gnyis med shes means knowing non-duality of apparent cause and condition as unified in essence, not their dissolution.

At that time, wind holding the body arises from inner wind's leaping power going upward, like mercury drops rising upward, remaining dispersed. At body completion time, whatever sudden condition occurs to body-mind, body trembling arises from this. Then on second day, earth mixes as one, pressing down with weight, the son experiences suffering from crown pressed down. At this time, body cause considered as merely flesh ripening, condition channels merely water expanding. From cause-condition of ignorance non-dual, non-conceptual wisdom liberated, Dzogchen beyond acceptance and rejection point. Above body's cause merely moist becoming merely blood, condition water merely channels merely flowing. Then on third day, wind-mind with cause-condition burned to dust particle size, entering red fire pit, experiencing suffering. At this time, body cause merely wind above, condition merely feet below. Then on fourth day, those scattered to wind's mercury dust particles, suffering like being carried limb by limb by executioners. This arises from anger. This also from above body's cause dust particle ripening, condition made clear as brightness by outer four elements' karma, held by inner four elements. At body completion time, outer as moon time four periods, inner as day-night inner-four conduct, arising from this. This point indicates four empowerments' transformation. View register: embryonic development through elemental stages with corresponding sufferings. Translation risk: literalizing suffering as only physical pain. Preservation: sufferings indicate energetic blockages at each elemental stage, not merely physiological pain.

Then on fourth day, pervading water channel spreading clear, inside elements refined and moved by wind, sent upward. From this, four directions water-earth, fire, wind channels quivering, flashing, coiling inside, YAM green, red, yellow three channels harmonious with quivering, flashing, coiling. When complete, arises from much mind movement. Four's center abides life-knowing like stretched cord. That itself called life, called time, called occasion. From that abiding and increasing-decreasing. That itself straight abiding long life, body ripening falling to earth time, sound A-YU renowned. Life cord coiling left interrupts life, immediately after born KHAM sound heard. Coiling down short life, immediately after born sound A-KHRIM. From treatises: life is life, warmth, consciousness support. Explained thus here. View register: life as channel-based energetic process with directional correspondences. Translation risk: reducing life force to mere physiology. Preservation: tse as channel-centered life force with directional and temporal correspondences, not merely biological vitality.

Then on fifth day, water holding clear body, performing generating action. Inside letter SUM yellow clear shining arising, from this depending on migrators' speech tone arising. Four directions of that earth, water, fire, wind channels holding, gathering, raising inside SUM white, red, green those channels harmonious each abiding. From this arise four conduct modes of going, lying, sitting, standing. Then on sixth day, fire and wind united, performing body forming and disintegrating action. At this time, fire channels blazing expanding inside letter RAM extremely clear abiding blazing. Migrators' consciousness sharp and dull differences distinguished by this letter clear or unclear. Four directions of that inner side four elements' channels expanding, blazing, burning inside RAM generating, RUM empty, RAM sleeping sign abiding, from depending on migrators' memory-thought wheel arising. Thus six days completed, elements as that action become support and abide. If four not done, outer depending on four elements' food clothing not controlled, inner dharmas not appearing as four sets, secretly four empowerments' result not ripening, thus four as forming support determined. View register: elemental progression creating functional capacities and cognitive distinctions. Translation risk: treating elements as separate sequential stages rather than simultaneous interdependence. Preservation: elements as simultaneously present capacities, with each day's emphasis marking a different aspect of their integration.

Then two by two days, two by two elements' karma holding body basis. Male female two joined like seed increasing-arising, elements male female joined body collection increasing should be known. Also on seventh day, four elements one taste become, cause-condition wind-mind four, flesh-blood-warmth-breath four, channels four, letters four become pulsating one form, making complete collection together. Wind channel leaping moving inside YAM moving flowing like abiding, from this migrators' breath going-coming and empty-full become. From this earth wind channel leaping dissolving, water gathering-expanding, fire conduct three inside YAM heap-distinguish, YE distinguish-gather, OM coil-bow abiding. Four letters' center form aggregate's basis dust particle abides, perception aggregate's basis warmth horse-ear empty cooling merely abides, feeling aggregate's basis memory cord three parts coiling merely abides, consciousness's basis knowing color changing merely abides, formations' basis arising-feeling door opening like abides. Thus cause elements' karma actually arisen, five aggregates' basis and their conditions collection becoming formations. From these five outside, five color light net canopies spread like covering, abiding inner supports five heads ornamented by JRIM KHAM TAM MAM BYAM five is five aggregates five families buddhahood point. OM JRIM AAM KHAM HUM TAM SVA MAM HA PYAM these. From merely changing abiding become certain buddha. Thus water channels four each inside basis-abiding wisdom three face not distinguished non-distinguished without, body mustard seed to six thousand cooling merely clear as face-arms, five light ball filled each pure own life letter together is nirvana basis-holding thus called basis-abiding wisdom. View register: embryonic formation as mandala of aggregates, elements, and wisdoms. Translation risk: confusing literal embryology with subtle body symbolism. Preservation: simultaneous formation of coarse and subtle bodies through elemental and wisdom energies.

Earth channels four inside characteristic-holding wisdom five not distinguished abiding. Five color white-yellow-red-green-blue essence-drop mustard seed to thousand cooling merely abiding, each of those five five light canopies beautifully surrounding is buddha path arising from five lights. Also each family's color characteristic-holding thus called characteristic-holding wisdom. Fire channels four inside consciousness-contained basis abiding is light pillar holding consciousness contained green abiding, action karma power transformation. Past consciousness wisdom white light pillar like star canopy abiding, from dharmata purity karma and latencies not staining point arising. Also samsara-nirvana consciousness merely contained abiding thus called consciousness-contained wisdom. Wind channels four object-knowing wisdom two non-conceptual mind abiding. Also light's clear gathered red self-benefit realizing abiding, yellow other-benefit realizing abiding. Also object knowing existing and non-existing, thing and non-thing all object knowing wisdom two contained thus called object-knowing wisdom. Also body's channels ultimate and conventional two cessation, arising, abiding, pleasure-pain all experienced thus yogi's body three kayas self-nature abiding. Also body arising characteristic known dharmakaya certainty obtained, abiding known sambhogakaya, disintegrating known nirmanakaya abiding certainty obtained. Thus seven days body basis established. View register: completion of embryonic subtle body with four wisdoms and three kayas. Translation risk: literalizing kayas as physical bodies. Preservation: three kayas as modes of body-knowing at arising, abiding, and disintegration phases.

Thus body basis established by seven days is gathering all approach-accomplishment action ends by seven days and elements gathering-expanding completion seven days completion indicated. These wisdoms wind-mind thus body disintegrating not permanent nothing, merely abiding in moved refined. Letters and light and bodies wisdom's own tone outward shining, returning to non-recognition itself merely dissolves. Also wisdom basis-abiding time inside clear subtle blazing basis merely, not color form. Body existing time basis from appearance outward shining thus light and body form completed, also appears in bardo, dissolving into spontaneous presence then form completed any not existing thus purity self-place abiding. Therefore three kayas complete in body, wisdom path from body's channels arise. Then second seven-day period, elements' action done as above, generating first wheel for eleven days gathering water channels eight inside letter and light and Samantabhadra father-mother body together is arising from channel increase-basis. From those channels karma wind moving coiling, arising as eight channels by elements male four female four's draw, eight consciousnesses' basis, collection lump certain movement non-mixed moving shifting existing eight abiding inside, eight self-arisen consciousness letters arising is migrators consciousness object-possessing enjoying depending on arising. View register: second developmental phase with eight channels and consciousnesses. Translation risk: confusing eight channels with physical anatomy. Preservation: eight channels as basis for eight consciousnesses through elemental male-female pairing.

From four channels changing struggling, gathered-mouth called wind's self-sound letter's change many spreading, earth channels four wheel upward thrown, between those two gathered-mouth wind mustard seed merely not touching holding, mutually like star canopy light tone letter brightness together abiding, up-down lotus petal spread like abiding. Then fourteen days alaya support four measure abiding those become mer-mer red form time, water creatures generating basis, subtle and changing-knowing and emerging and action-rising creatures four body formed. Also inside those channels etc. supports previous like forming is one body countless lives abiding. These called control-body, buddha body father-mother two-two not abiding thus called body-less, not actual form thus. From Vajra Tip Play: from one form body's end, holding non-end not-established end, abiding beyond thousand count, also sky-body from, abandoning containing action, knowing form end dust atom sky. Thus each creature desire-conduct wind each abiding, migrators all desire-attachment karma near taking arising from this. Fourteen indicates karma connection also that point. View register: formation of control-body with four creatures and karma connections. Translation risk: literalizing body-less as non-existence rather than non-fixed form. Preservation: body-less indicates non-abiding in fixed paternal-maternal forms, not absence of form.

Then third seven-day period becoming, fifteenth day from earth channel increase-basis light and letter together generating, those central sixteenth day memory basis gold vapor merely arising, seventeenth day sky like clouds gathering inside draw-gather action karma changing wind together, eighteenth day elements each power completed, eighteen elements basis channels changing vapor lump eighteen formed. Then two-two elements united action connection made is previous power exhausted. Eighteen elements vapor like egg-shell from element-holding called wind quivering shifting arisen sound together, fire channels wheel four together upward leaping, to dust sky direct-called below above mustard seed double surpassing, twenty-one days moving alaya support basis channels together thus lta-lta form transformed. This is five hundred's end all mantra action end twenty-one days doing, indicated alaya collection disintegrating. Then from earth creatures four wind bile phlegm etc. sickness horse becoming formed previous like. Then twenty-two to twenty-five days elements each power and body basis completing, four days elements' power previous channels four increasing limb channels four thus eight determined, each light and letter clear-generating together is tastes collection wheel star-light like shining tone together, stacked wheel petal like channel wheel called. View register: third phase with eighteen elements and limb channel formation. Translation risk: treating eighteen elements as separate rather than interdependent configurations. Preservation: eighteen elements as basis for sensory and cognitive capacities, not merely physiological constituents.

Eight's center desire-object five pleasure touching support warmth essence goat-fat merely abiding vapor from, twelve ayatanas basis fruit like sa-lu swelled and dissolving life twelve abiding, gathering-expanding wheel form alaya action support abiding. Expanding place wheel letter together. Then twenty-nine to thirty-two days element water gathering, earth stable pressing, fire blazing expanding, wind blazing moving action done. Thirty-two day elements each power somewhat exhausted, this time generating action wind called wild-debauched wind arising, previous wind channels four upward thrown, to dust particle sky mustard seed above thrown, from previous channels four again channels four increased, those center tip wind force-holding called petal from star-canopy like light spreading gathering, previous element-basis actual power exhausted, again two elements united action from thirty-four day alaya support four set together those hard-form support, afflictions gathering coarse channel-poison vapor poison pot like gathering abiding, tip arranged wheel called abiding is thirty-five day king's writing-completed tantra arising from this. Thus seven sets seven samsara body channels wheel four generated, each eight channel-twigs eight thirty-two body generally abiding is samsara river substance twelve limbs samsara body basis holding arising from this. Thus channels thirty-two from wisdom thirty-two action arises. View register: formation of thirty-two channel twigs and completion of essential tantra. Translation risk: confusing king's writing with political metaphor. Preservation: king's writing-completed indicates mature configuration of channels ready for further development.

From essence ultimate essence-drop lamp four ripening together arising, that making bliss path if done forceful method buddha certain. Those residue becoming conventional essence-drop, four elements ripening together arising, that sending suffering to own continuum samsara seed expanding, that itself channel point depending making path, does special bliss dharmata direct realization. Those channels become wisdom path, essence-drop nature gone, pleasure-pain experienced action doing. Then thirty-five day again previous like elements each action power generating first action connection completing, from form dust particle countless aggregate heap gathering expanding, thus feeling perception formations aggregate parts from expanding gathering countless immeasurable generating is five aggregates family manifest appearance raised. Then forty-two day two-two elements united action, generating water creatures eighty-four thousand body expanded. That wheel channel-twigs sixty-two indicated action done is eon arising-ceasing sixty-two arising cause. Those channels each inside channel-abode special letter each, that supporting light ball each, light holding Samantabhadra father-mother two-two abiding. Also channels sixty-two, letters sixty-two thus one-twenty-four, lights sixty-two thus one hundred eighty-six, Samantabhadra father and mother combined one-twenty-four, generating first wheel wisdom change special three hundred and ten. Those wisdom pure wind leaping and sinking etc., shamatha and vipashyana action certain realizing thus called generating, samsara body basis thus first called. Thus all basis thus wheel. Element special dharma wind etc. enumerations that much each element's extent going-coming difference abiding. Afflictions and action doing that much karma wind's draw and inhaling and holding and releasing thus day-night certain. Thus condition collection particular dharmas nine hundred and thirty abiding is empowerment basis path certain arising from this. View register: completion of generating wheel with full subtle body mandala. Translation risk: reducing numerical correspondences to mere symbolism. Preservation: numerical correspondences indicate precise subtle body architecture with functional capacities.
