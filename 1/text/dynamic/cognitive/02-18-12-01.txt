Three kaya manifestations. Half-body appearances: nirmāṇakāya manifesting. Full-body appearances: sambhogakāya appearing as complete form. Five-parent appearances: sambhogakāya with five wisdoms. Circle appearances: dharmakāya as mandala. Awareness reaching maturity: appearances arise as wisdom nature. Past actions cease producing results—wisdom manifests naturally, not caused by past karma. Structural note: connects kaya manifestations to wisdom appearances.
