Light dissolution and Buddha-body appearances. Light rays expand outward, dissolve withdraw inward entering heart center—resemble silk, like child entering lap. Through blending into Dharmata, liberation upon ground of primordial purity occurs. These appearances arise as spontaneous presence of Buddha-body. Buddha-bodies neither large nor small—equal in size with ornaments, colors, postures, thrones, seats, mudras. All pervaded by pairs of fivefold ones, each set surrounded by halo of light. Families holding father aspect, mother aspect, heroes, heroines—all mandalas complete present as one. From heart center, extremely subtle light arises, connects to hearts of all Buddha-bodies, illuminates. Structural note: Dzogchen bardo visionary experiences—Buddha mandala manifestations at death.
