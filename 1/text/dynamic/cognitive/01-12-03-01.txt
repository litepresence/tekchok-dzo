Throat wheel enumeration begins with sixteen petals (rtsa 'dab ma bcu drug), from which inner and outer divided small-petals number countless. Inside, coarse channels number three hundred sixty, located in the spirals of seven wheels. The Garland of Channels (rtsa gnas 'khor lo) establishes the throat enjoyment wheel (mgrin pa longs spyod 'khor lo) with three hundred sixty-four channels. The wheel sequence possesses seven aspects, with the first sequence's petals numbering ten, the remainder all similar, all ending with twenty.

Karma and affliction latency, wisdom moving vital-point gathering path—wisdom moving sixteen, awareness body also that number, prajna bindu sixteen, elements also sixteen. Empty clear bindu channels number eight, gathering channels fourteen. Awareness body wheel aspects sixteen possessing: seven awareness actual-thing, remainder body. Prajna bindu sixteen: eight bindu empty move, four basis path bindu, remainder prajna moving path.

Elements' sixteen petals divide: four from wind essence, four from fire essence heat, three from earth essence yellow, three from water essence blood, two from space essence mind. These pervade all. Throat enjoyment wheel channel movements: four go above (empty power training), two all-pervading (awareness self-power training), two go below (elements pure-dross disturbing), four go right (wisdom power training), four go left (karmic power generating).

Wind goddesses perform elaborate actions: gathering, holding, radiating. Five goddesses represent five wisdom-winds circling in wisdom-expanse purity. Outer channel petals specific: wheel front back, fire-streak like channel, left mitten-like tip-small left called, gathering affliction moving channel.

Throat wheel channels include: wheel front back has fire-streak like channel; right side circling, scarf-wind moved, great channels one each, small tips right left located; wisdom light and blood essence. Left side mitten-like, small tip left called, gathering affliction moving channel. Wheel's sides right left, sprout-like channel one each, shoulder heads right left.

Wheel's four spokes have conch-shell-like channels, armor mirror right left. There channels two-two. Wheel's remaining petals, water-drop-like channels one each located. Shoulder's power-entering center right left one each. Above that, petal's channels, thorn-like channels two, shoulder's own center right left located. Above that, remaining petals, sun-ray-like channel one, shoulder's corner located. These two also two-two.

These are famous as throat enjoyment wheel's channel forms. Sabhata wheel possesses sixteen petals, channel forms there. Moving wind and bindu support, consciousness constituents located. Four channels suitable for cutting, four winds suitable for pressing, four bindus suitable for abiding. Four channels suitable for scattering without cutting, four consciousness winds, four gathering bindus located.

Four equal-channels have four winds without reversal. Four secret bindus located. Remainder need not concern. Leaping channels eleven; suitable for opening eight; if burned, remainder becomes faulty. Remainder of abiding: from those, if burned, two become faulty. This is abiding's vital-point. If throat wheel disease arises, treatment methods from vital-letter: throat right upward flows.

E located tip-small right: bloodletting benefits neck stiffness. Left O tip-small left: bloodletting benefits upper-torso stopping, head-ache, stomach disease. Shoulder right E: mind-channel Yonpo, bloodletting benefits lung heat. Left A: general-channel Thenpo, bloodletting benefits all disease. Shoulder's sun-center right: A located poison-channel Yonpo, bloodletting benefits poison disease.

Left A: Scal-channel great, bloodletting benefits epilepsy-fainting. Shoulder corner right: vowel I located, black Scal-channel called, bloodletting benefits all waist disease. Left same: vowel Ī located, gold-channel short called, bloodletting clears all channel diseases. O located armor mirror center: great lung-channel called, burning benefits head confusion.

Shoulder's lung-entering center: O located right Scal-thread called, burning clears shoulder swelling. Left I: left Scal-thread, burning benefits stomach bloating. Rī located below-throat hollow: Lī located spear-tip right: left Li, tiger-center E; front center AĪ—all these. Not cut and disturbed. If yogi's body elements disturbed, these letters' locations, directions and front-back, with breath recited, accomplished.

Remainder benefit-harmless. Knowing these, element disturbance impossible. Thus states the text. Great bliss wheel's sequence individual explanation has four aspects. First: sentient beings' one body relying on wheel; non-wheel relying dharma many composed also. External existence's attachment-way: wind-supported becomes water, water becomes earth etc.

Wind-mind pure-gathered, water gathers one, internal body forms. First wheel water's function composed: blood, serum, saliva, tears etc., ripening-essences produced. Body's growth-decline blood does function. Hot season blood dries, body's disease; blood increase clears disease. Cold season blood freezes, disease; warming clears disease. Thus water earth-supported.

Second wheel earth's function chief: earth produces body's muscle, organ meat, flesh diversity from heart spreading, supported. These cut, squeezed, beaten, pierced do life's function; moxibustion dependent-origination clears disease. Thus earth produces wood etc., fire's cause egg womb power place. Third wheel fire's function chief: produces body's heat, color, radiance.

This also generation transforms male-female; memory transforms life-length; flavors transform enjoyment magnitude; tip transforms sense pure-impure and being kindness-hostility. Generation's projecting produces large body, thick limbs, great power. Its gathering produces small form, weak power, thin limbs. Gathering-leaping produces small form yet power-possessing.

Memory's projecting produces clear intelligence, clear senses, no coarse conceptual thought. Gathering produces great conceptual thought, forgetfulness. Gathering produces clear senses, clear intelligence, forgetfulness. Projecting-leaping produces great conceptual thought yet quick samadhi production. Flavors' projecting pure produces pleasant speech, clear words, sound expertise.

Gathering produces unpleasant speech. Increase impure produces pleasant speech, great eloquence, yet speech powerless. Tip's projecting pure produces pure mind, accomplished thought. Increase impure produces mind's goodness accomplished yet virtue not increasing. Gathering produces mind's desire unaccomplished, wrong memory-thought. These pure produces mind's desire unaccomplished yet virtue increasing.

This is projecting-gathering's certainty. Four wheels' certainty reason: one and two don't ripen empowerment-path-result; three also doesn't ripen. Connection sequence establishes outer four elements, inner four wisdoms, secret four lamps, supreme four kayas. Body-speech-mind-consciousness four, four purifiers, four result fruits—certainty grounds four wheels.

Individual classifications: navel Nirmanakaya wheel, heart Dharmacakra wheel, throat Sambhogakaya wheel, crown great bliss wheel. Nirmanakaya wheel four: general classification, individual limb explanation, vital-point specific explanation, treatment method certain explanation. Root channels sixty-four from six water four divided, petals countless.

Particularly inside channels certain: elements, mind, ignorance, consciousness, dalwa all-gathered divisions. Small wheel petals one each thirty-eight eighty become. Divide: two thousand four hundred thirty-two exist. Root and limb power considered: from channel-location wheel, emanation wheel sixty-four petals, element etc. sequence division.

Earth channels five aspects hold body basis. Water channels five aspects gather body essence. Fire channels five aspects gather essence. Wind channels five aspects gather wind essence. Mind channels five aspects gather breath essence. Ignorance channels five aspects show individual body constituents connection. Space-mind channels two gather breath and consciousness essence. Dalwa all-gathered channels six gather objects and ignorance.

Channel forms there: fifteen above go, fifteen below go, eight certainly sideways move. Outer channel limbs: from this, emanation wheel from these, aspects outer-transform doing, channel forms there, its right left petals from. Garland-like great channels color-possessing aspects transform. Knees' hollows two, black light-possessing one each.

These two have ten each. From those petals, gold-color-like channels, calf's center one each. These two have five each. Then wheel's petals, transforming great channels, mist-like channels two, cow's inside certainly become. These two also five each. Wheel bliss petals: extremely subtle great channels, ankle's two joints one each. These two have four each.

Thus outer channels inner channels karma and wisdom etc. moving. Channel forms there, wheel's body located. Emanation nature wheel, sixty-four great channels, attendant channels inconceivable. Channel forms there, gathering channels ten located, disturbing and holding functions do. Those inside, gathering essences one each, times elements disturb, times latency, times self-abide.

Wisdom channels eight aspects, knowledge's aspect hold only located. Remainder karma and affliction channels. Fifty itself located. Karma channels ten. Remainder affliction channels become. Affliction channels forty from: ignorance channels ten. Mind channels also that number. Consciousness channels also ten. Three poisons also that much.

Ignorance channels ten: three simultaneously-born, three cause-condition ignorance, remainder imagined. Mind channels ten aspects: three object-holding, four object-gathering mind, remainder conceptual mind. Consciousness channels ten: two all-searching, two certainty-placing mind, three certainty-establishing, remainder consciousness. Three poison channels ten: three generation-desire channels, three non-attachment delusion channels, four ripening-hatred channels.

Navel emanation wheel located channels those. Gathering channels those. Two phlegm channels. Two wind channels. Two bile serum channels. Remainder gathering channels. Wisdom itself self-clear. This is navel's channels. Thus states the text.
