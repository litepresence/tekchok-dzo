Example: cowherd son one angered tiger become, not-angered human come like. Awareness resonance body channel-from move wind only one also, channel twist twist-not—from consciousness suitable wisdom, not-suitable karma defilements become mount arise defect-not. Wisdom wind action wisdom four: basis-located wisdom work (whatever-appear actual-state top-from other change not-possible), characteristic-hold wisdom (individual family body wisdom light color clear pass not-possible), attachment-not wisdom called. Risk: practical example uses metaphor—preserve without expanding into narrative.

[15851-15890]
Arise part knowables-gather wisdom (self-other benefit obstruct not, action doer own-continuum not-not), move part consciousness-gather wisdom (worldly transcended knowledge distinction various arise, self self-possess grasp not). Four definite cause time: path time ultimate elements four, fruition time four bodies essence ripen. Basis path fruition three refer twelve arise, Buddha activities twelve arise cause certain. Karma wind action four: right move male, left move female, outside go appearance various enter inside fill conceptual groups spread. Right left time definite male female ripen father mother power. Risk: gender-wind correlation uses period categories—preserve without modernization.

[15891-15930]
Nature right-from move transfer work karma end near, left-from move time grasp work. Outside go inside fill go-come power: outside go happy work, inside come unhappy. Those two wheel spread-gather vital-point day-night arise. Outside go part day appearance arise, inside fill part night appearance arise. Thus two four actions two-two counted eight become, those parts counted twenty-four. Karma wind difference twelve change actions twelve: body increase-decrease work outside twelve, inside twelve months, secret twelve times. Risk: temporal correlations are systematic—preserve exact enumeration.

[15931-15970]
Change amount: body ripen age prime one day-night elements individual wind change amount. Earth wind five-thousand four-hundred, water, fire, wind five-thousand four-hundred four-hundred combine, twenty-one-thousand six-hundred prime one change amount certain. Youth teeth-two not-complete elements not-developed. Wind element latency sleep life time: wind transfer long life end bring, short not-bring. Fierce merit enjoyment possess, attached disease certain suffering. Risk: numerical precision critical—preserve exact counts.

[15971-16010]
Slow samsara disease few, slow body weapons gather virtue mind not-arise. Pressed constant non-virtue harm decrease located, agitated mind-agitated beings not-kind. Aged fifty-eight not-complete: element row damaged, very agitated life time quick, dull suffering sorrow lamentation engage, swirl mind actual-state not-reach non-virtue engage. Slow life end extend constant bliss, khyig constant enemy dispute cause not-arise, khyog constant action happy life short, gyur enjoyment great disease certain. Risk: bio-energetic typology uses period categories—preserve without modernization.

[16011-16050]
Rgal body speech work not-accomplish, increase pacify-increase work quick accomplish. Thus body enemy flourish constant suffering, gap good-bad show. Prime age three-hundred not-complete year one, fifty not-complete year two, thirty-two year three, twenty-one year four, one-eighth month seven, one-sixth month five, one-fourth month one one-tenth day twenty-nine, twenty not-complete eighteen, thirty ten, forty seven, sixty five. Wind calculation apply: worldly, transcended two. Worldly life merit, bliss-suffering etc. Risk: numerological calculations represent period system—preserve exact enumeration.

[16051-16090]
Transcended: change amount transfer time two. Change amount: day aspect twelve change, night aspect sixteen change. Day elements individual action bliss-suffering virtuous-non-virtuous conceptual groups horses move. Night also same, wisdom wind increase doing. Transfer time explained. Bindu detailed distinction: Thalgyur quote establishes relative and ultimate bindu. Relative bindu: rely Buddha desire, consort characteristic complete, god anti-god Brahma, outcaste tirthika characteristic complete see, attract application certain begin, object rely channels, object body complete. Risk: textual citation—preserve exact quote.

[16091-16130]
Then relative bindu itself: drop hold reverse, channel strike wind roast, emptiness object mind follow-cut, body mind reverse. Ultimate bindu: Dharmakaya empty objects obtain, bindu empty lamp itself, insert awareness power train, day-night not-different familiarization train, effort-not directly appear, mastery amount. Secret mantra near path channel bindu wind vital-point rely, effort-possessing elaboration system, effort-not elaboration free system two. Elaboration artifice channel wind coarse effort path. Risk: this describes tantric practice—preserve as translator awareness only.

[16131-16170]
First relative bindu yoga: consort seek, attract, serve, channel seek, hold, application do, main-part bindu drop, hold, reverse, potential bestow, wind roast, dharmata recite, after experience examine, body mind reverse experience. Karma wind time bindu hold, wisdom time bindu reverse potential bestow vital-point correct. Elaboration-not yogi: light clear bindu direct path, sitting-manner gazing-manner definite. Action time bindu empty lamp insert meditate, light clear appearance day-night mixed engage. Relative bindu Roma located, path union father-mother method. Risk: these are condensed oral instruction—preserve compression, implementation requires transmission.

[16171-16210]
Left nature bindu pure subtle resonance light self-tone located, mouth-pair bliss essence empty transform meaning. Center Dharmakaya bindu elaboration-free light clear pure self-arise wisdom lamp blaze basis located. Pearl Garland quote: bindu three—right left middle. Right relative bindu, great bliss essence-possess, bliss gather source, Buddha all great secret, method indicate nature. Ultimate Dharmakaya nature-possess, empty clear bindu single, center located nature clear. Risk: textual citation—preserve exact quote.

[16211-16250]
Emanation-withdrawal speech thought object beyond, gradually thought free, existence-nonexistence two limits clear, eternal-nihilism extreme located not, thought-not spontaneously complete, expression-not nature empty, ultimate thing bindu. Left nature bindu located, bliss union two spread, firm located not, mouth-pair bliss obtain, Mahamudra itself cause, great bliss great wisdom path, secret mantra all-lord mandala, samsara save great method, secret wisdom tone blaze light, great bliss essence. Thus effort-possessing coarse train, effort-not self-place two this vehicle taught. Risk: vehicle (yana) terminology indicates doctrinal context—preserve as technical vocabulary.

[16251-16290]
Particularly intelligence supreme, body speech vital-point press mind side free, wisdom actually appear Three Kayas path bindu unsurpassable vital-point taught vehicle surpass vital-point. Vehicle's Dharma Treasury vital-point certain specific explain twelve lecture-hall. Latency body accomplish manner distinction shown. Now wisdom support lamps four distinction: lamps four essence brief show, nature extensive explain. Body first form time water rely first form generate-doing channel knot inside lamp eye. Risk: four lamps represent highest yogic attainment—preserve as technical apparatus.

[16291-16330]
Element eye two first form, element eye-from elements four body accomplish manner before explained. Lamp eye-from wisdom appearance light bindu body etc. nature ultimate transcend basis eye two A fruit center horn like base subtle tip large two form, far-cast water lamp called. Rely bindu empty lamp, wisdom self-arise lamp, expanse pure lamp four arise. Pearl Garland quote: being path arise gateway, right two left two center, lamp blaze manner located, bindu empty lamp, pure expanse lamp, wisdom self-arise and, far-cast water lamp, see object appear. Risk: textual citation—preserve exact quote.

[16331-16370]
Self-Arisen quote: lamps four thus—bindu empty lamp, awareness expanse lamp, wisdom self-arise lamp, far-cast water lamps, sentient beings all located. Thus ultimate elements four pure lamps four ripen. Both effort-possessing coarse train and effort-not self-place complete Chapter Twelve. Risk: closing marks section transition—preserve formulaic closure.
