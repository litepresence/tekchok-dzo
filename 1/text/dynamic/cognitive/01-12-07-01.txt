[15778-15800]
Dispute resolution opens with a philosophical question: if wind moving from channels is only one, how do karma and wisdom become two individual movements? The objection notes that if they are different, two natures exist, making "one" untenable. The response establishes that movement is only one, yet from channel twist-not-twist movement, wisdom wind becomes action with bliss-power, emptiness, and clear emptiness—hence called "wisdom wind." From channel location twist-not-twist, karma wind becomes action with conceptual difference, non-virtuous connection, unclear, dull, agitated, torpid, coiled, etc.—wind defects arise.

[15801-15825]
The cowherd son example illustrates: one son angered becomes tiger, not-angered becomes human. Similarly, awareness resonance body channel-from moving wind is only one, yet from channel twist-not-twist—consciousness suitable becomes wisdom, not-suitable becomes karma-defilements. No defect exists in this system. Wisdom wind action produces four wisdoms: basis-located wisdom, characteristic-hold wisdom, attachment-not wisdom, knowables-gather wisdom, and consciousness-gather wisdom.

[15826-15850]
The fourfold wisdom certainty at cause-time becomes four ultimate elements at path-time, four kayas at fruition-time. Thus basis-path-result three, twelve emerge—twelve buddha activities' definite cause. Karma wind action has four functions: right move produces male, left move produces female, outside going produces various appearance-entering, inside filling produces conceptual groups spreading. Outside going and inside filling: outside going produces happy function, inside coming produces unhappy.

[15851-15875]
These two also from wheel's radiate-gather vital-point, day-night produced. Outside going aspect produces day-appearance; inside filling aspect produces night-appearance. Thus two actions two-two counted become eight; those parts counted become twenty-four. Karma wind difference twelve: change actions twelve, body increase-decrease function. Thus outside twelve years, inside twelve months, secret twelve times produced.

[15876-15900]
Change amount: body ripened, age prime one, day-night elements individual wind change amount. Earth wind five-thousand four-hundred; water, fire, wind winds also five-thousand four-hundred four-hundred; combined twenty-one-thousand six-hundred prime one change amount certain. Youth twenty-two incomplete: elements not matured. Wind element latency life's time calculated: wind leap long, life-end reaches; short, not reached.

[15901-15925]
Forceful: merit and enjoyment possessed. Attachment: disease and suffering. Slow: circling, disease few. Late: body weapon-gathered, virtue-mind not produced. Agitated: always non-virtue, increase-decrease located. Agitated: mind agitated, beings not friendly. Elderly fifty-eight incomplete: elements' order damaged. Thus extremely agitated, life's time quickly done. Dull: suffering, grief and lamentation practiced.

[15926-15950]
Circling: mind not abide naturally, non-virtue practiced. Slow: life-end long, always bliss. Kinked: always enemy and dispute cause produced. Crooked: always work delighting, life short. Change: enjoyment great yet disease. Straight: body-speech action unaccomplished. Increase: pacifying-increasing action quickly accomplished. Briefly: body's enemy matured, always suffering. Opening: good-bad showing.

[15951-15975]
Prime three-hundred incomplete: one year life's function. Fifty incomplete: two years. Thirty-two incomplete: three years. Twenty-one incomplete: four years. Eight-part incomplete: seven months. Six-part incomplete: five months. Four-part incomplete: one month. Ten-part incomplete: twenty-nine days. Twenty incomplete: eighteen. Thirty incomplete: ten. Forty incomplete: seven. Sixty incomplete: five days.

[15976-16000]
Thus wind calculation applied: world and transcendence two. World's life, merit, bliss-suffering etc. Transcendence: change-amount and leap-time two. Change-amount: day part twelve changes, night part sixteen changes. Day: elements' individual functions, bliss-suffering and virtue-non-virtue conceptual groups many horse-riding. Night: similar, yet pristine-awareness wind increase-producing.

[16001-16025]
Leap-time previously explained. Third topic: bindu abiding thorough division. Thalgyur states: wanting to show bindu's dharmata, from ultimate and relative, first relative bindu relying, Buddha-desiring, consort characteristic complete. If low-caste Tīrthika, characteristic complete seen, magnetizing practice certainly begun, relying itself and channels, object bodies complete. Then relative bindu itself, descending, holding, reversing, channel striking, wind burning, emptiness relying mind severed, body-mind itself reversing.

[16026-16050]
Ultimate bindu relying, dharmakāya empty objects obtained. Empty bindu lamp itself, cutting, Rigpa's powers trained, day-night without mixing accustomed—this itself effort-free appears directly. This is mastery's measure. Thus states the text. Secret mantra near-path: channel-bindu-wind three vital-points relying. Here effort-possessing elaboration system and effort-free elaboration-free system two exist.

[16051-16075]
Elaboration practitioners coarse channel-wind effort path-making, relative bindu yogi-making, consort seeking, magnetizing, relying, channel seeking, holding, practicing, actual basis bindu descending, holding, reversing, power striking, wind burning, dharmata reversing, subsequent experience examining, body-mind reversing experience etc.—above third empowerment time extensively elaborated.

[16076-16100]
That also karma-wind time bindu holding, wisdom time bindu reversing and power striking is correct vital-point. Elaboration-free yogi: light-clarity bindu direct path-making, posture and gaze certain, beginner's time empty bindu lamp cut contemplated, light-clarity appearance day-night mixed practiced.

[16101-16125]
That also relative bindu Roma located, path-making union-father-mother method. Left natural bindu essence, subtle melody, light's self-melody abiding only—mouth-union bliss-emptiness transformation meaning. Center dharmakāya bindu, free of elaboration, light-clarity purity, self-arisen wisdom blazing lamp basis. This itself extensively below explained.

[16126-16150]
Pearl Garland: "From channels bindus, subtle flowing nature, beautified by light rays. Also three parts: right, left, center. Right relative bindu, great bliss condition, gathered bliss source, all buddhas' great secret, means-indicating nature. Center dharmakāya nature, empty-clarity singular bindu, center-located self-nature clear, radiating-withdrawing beyond thought-speech, gradually free conceptual thought, existence-nonexistence extremes cleared, eternalism-nihilism extremes non-abiding, non-conceptual spontaneously complete, inexpressible naturally empty—ultimate bindu."

[16151-16175]
Left natural bindu abides, bliss-union both-pervading, not strongly established, mouth-union itself obtains bliss. Mahamudra's cause, great bliss wisdom's path, all secret mantras' self-mandala, great method saving from samsara, secret wisdom-blazing light—this is great bliss essence. Thus effort-possessing coarse training and effort-free self-settled both taught in this vehicle.

[16176-16200]
Particularly supreme intelligence, body-speech vital-points pressed, mind side freed, wisdom actually appears—three kayas path bindu unsurpassable vital-point taught. Thus this vehicle surpasses all vehicles. From The Precious Treasury of Vehicle Dharma, twelfth section on certain vital-points.

[16201-16225]
Thus having shown latency-body formation with divisions, now wisdom-support four lamps' distinctions with parts spoken. Four lamps' essence brief show, nature extensive explain. Body first forming time: water-supported, first-formed generation-doing channel knot inside, lamp-eye and element-eye first form. From element-eye, four elements' body formation previously explained.

[16226-16250]
From lamp-eye, wisdom-appearance light, bindu, body etc., nature ultimate transcendence basis, eye two A-fruit center, goat-horn-like base subtle tip large two form, called far-casting water lamp. Relying on this, empty bindu lamp, wisdom self-arisen lamp, expanse pure lamp—four arise. Pearl Garland: "Beings' path arise gateway, right two left two center, lamp blaze manner located, empty bindu lamp, pure expanse lamp, wisdom self-arisen, far-casting water lamp, see object appear."

[16251-16275]
Self-Arisen: "Four lamps thus—empty bindu lamp, awareness expanse lamp, wisdom self-arisen lamp, far-casting water lamps—all sentient beings located." Thus ultimate elements four pure, four lamps ripen. This knowing extremely important.

[16276-16300]
Also from that: "Divisions three aspects: element essence self-gathered far-noose water lamp, pristine-awareness gathered far-noose, power gathered far-noose." Thus the three divisions. Characteristics: general form-appearance hold capable produce object-appearance. Self-characteristics three: element gather far-noose expand aspect abide appearance gather hold, pristine-awareness gather clear hold light-clarity self-appearance, power gather hold appearance appearance-object self-know eye consciousness.

[16301-16325]
Object-appearance refers to objects appearing externally like mountains; appearance-object refers to objects with their own characteristics like cliffs; appearance-knowledge is free of conceptual thought and verbal name-forms; appearance-object refers to objects established as solid things. Location is eye's A-fruit. Body first forms, navel's great channel knot triangular center, lamp-eye and element-eye first form from parents' causal conditional essences. Pathway: navel to heart, heart to spine, shoulders to inner ear, skull to eye's A-fruit center.

[16326-16350]
Two channels without blood or serum, like goat horns, filled with light channels inside, insert as water-lamp's gateway. These two channels' inner light channels constitute actual far-casting water lamp. From within: Rigpa's thought-free body, vajra chain, stacked light spheres five colors, nine arrangements—containing four lamps' aspects. This channel is water lamp's aspect; bindu is empty lamp's aspect; five lights are expanse's aspect; non-realized knowledge is wisdom's lamp aspect.

[16351-16375]
Pearl Garland: "Thought-free Rigpa vajra chain, great bliss Brahma's gate appears." Generation from navel: entering mother's womb, body forms from essence. Great channel knot at navel's triangular center produces eye-fruit from parents' causal conditional essences. White and black mix. Gateway is eye's A-fruit essence's straight center.

[16376-16400]
Simile compares to hook: "Like holding-hook takes what appears from nose, samsara and nirvana's two noses this holds." Measures: element-essence far-noose measure completes expanding and gathering; pristine-awareness measure sees vajra chain; essence-gathering measure distinguishes form-appearance particulars. Tantra states: "Lamp appearing-purpose, object form-appearance, Rigpa also, vajra chain appearance measure."

[16401-16425]
Empty bindu lamp has twelve aspects: essence, etymology, divisions, characteristics, location, gateway, nature, object-appearance, measure, actual lamp, practice method, simile. Practice methods: settling empty lamp through contemplation, experiencing light-clarity appearance mixed day-night. Relative bindu Roma located, path practice union-father-mother method.

[16426-16450]
Left natural bindu, subtle essence melody, abiding as light's self-melody—mouth-union's bliss-emptiness transformation meaning. Center dharmakāya bindu, free of elaboration, light-clarity purity, self-arisen wisdom blazing lamp basis. This itself extensively below explained. Pearl Garland citation continues with detailed bindu classifications.

[16451-16475]
Right relative bindu is great bliss condition, source of gathered bliss, all buddhas' great secret, means-indicating nature. Center dharmakāya nature, empty-clarity singular bindu, center-located self-nature clear, radiating-withdrawing beyond thought-speech, gradually free of conceptual thought, existence-nonexistence extremes cleared, eternalism-nihilism extremes non-abiding, non-conceptual spontaneously complete, inexpressible naturally empty—ultimate bindu.

[16476-16500]
Left natural bindu abides, bliss-union both-pervading, not strongly established, mouth-union itself obtains bliss. Mahamudra's cause, great bliss wisdom's path, all secret mantras' self-mandala, great method saving from samsara, secret wisdom-blazing light—this is great bliss essence. Thus effort-possessing coarse training and effort-free self-settled both are taught in this vehicle.

[16501-16525]
Particularly for supreme intelligence, body-speech vital-points pressed, mind side freed, wisdom actually appears—three kayas path bindu unsurpassable vital-point taught. Thus this vehicle surpasses all vehicles. From The Precious Treasury of Vehicle Dharma, the section on certain vital-points. Thus having shown latency-body formation with divisions, now wisdom-support four lamps' distinctions with parts are spoken.
