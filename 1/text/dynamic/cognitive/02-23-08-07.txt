Third: in that state knowing awareness in an instant. Structural marker for third bardo moment. View register: non-conceptual direct knowing—shifting from recognition to established knowing. Translation: preserve gsum pa, ngang, dar cig (instant), shes pa zin (having known) technical construction. Note: the perfective zin indicates completion of recognition event—stabilization rather than mere glimpse. Translation risk: instant (dar cig) refers not to ordinary temporal moment but to timeless awareness moment. Preservation: the four-moment progression shows development even within non-temporal bardo state.
