[2539-2548]
The Treasury's exposition of the Śrāvakayāna establishes foundational vehicle classification through systematic fivefold analysis. Essence, definition, purpose, result, and divisions structure each vehicle presentation. The śrāvaka as "hearer" depends on teacher, hears doctrine, proclaims to others, achieves final existence bodhi. Personal liberation motivation distinguishes this vehicle, with person selflessness realization as method. Arhat attainment with remainder marks the result. Two divisions emerge: Sautrāntika and Vaibhāṣika, representing distinct Abhidharma schools with varying ontological commitments.

[2549-2579]
Vaibhāṣika ontology presents coarse conventional truth as unified collection, ultimately consisting of part-possessing atoms scattered like dust. Consciousness continuum remains conventional; momentary particles without parts constitute ultimate reality. The four truths structure systematic practice: cause, origin, cessation, condition. Consciousness modes engage knowable suffering, abandonable origin, reliable path, attainable cessation. Threefold abandonment through suffering, emptiness, and selflessness realization. Path of reason, cultivation, and definite emergence leads to cessation, peace, excellence. Meditation on selflessness abandons 414 objects through three realms' seeing and meditation, manifesting exhaustion and non-production wisdom.

[2580-2597]
Sautrāntika exposition presents twelve knowledges regarding four truths as objects, abandoning eighty-eight latent afflictions to attain supreme wisdom. Similar to Vaibhāṣika regarding person selflessness, yet superior through partially transcending dharmas' domain. Five consciousness bases with parts as main, mind basis as subsidiary. Five uncompounded bases not established, transcending earlier position. Key distinction: Sautrāntikas recognize partless atoms as merely imputed, not ultimately existent. This refined position within Hīnayāna realism demonstrates philosophical development.

[2598-2610]
Path cultivation technical precision: five paths arise sequentially during meditation. Three poisons' general antidote through selflessness and illusion meditation. Specific antidotes include impurity and skeleton visualization for desire, love for anger, dependent arising for delusion, breath-counting for discursive thought. Drowsiness antidote employs light visualization at crown. Three faculties—dull, medium, sharp—determine attainment capacity. Some achieve in this life; others complete five paths on one seat with extensive accumulation. This methodological specificity preserves distinct practice lineages.

[2611-2625]
Vehicle hierarchy positions small, medium, great intellect as producing śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and Buddha enlightenment respectively. Eight inferior grounds for śrāvaka-pratyekabuddha. Four fruits—stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, arhat—each divided into entering and abiding, making eight great person stages. Pratyekabuddha realizes dependent arising through own power, solitary like rhinoceros, without teacher in final life. The rhinoceros simile establishes archetype of solitary practice, distinguishing pratyekabuddhas from śrāvakas who depend on teachers.

[2626-2680]
Bodhisattvayāna exposition presents bodhicitta generation and six perfections. Two accumulations—merit and wisdom—support progress through ten grounds and five paths. Two philosophical systems: Prajñāpāramitā realizing three circles empty, perfecting six perfections through five paths and ten grounds; Tathāgatagarbha recognizing Buddha-nature endowed with virtues from beginning, purifying adventitious defilements to reveal spontaneously present essence. This comprehensive path establishes foundation for tantric vehicles, maintaining Mahāyāna as necessary precursor.

[2681-2832]
Tantric vehicle classification presents outer three—kriyā, upa, yoga—and inner three—mahā, anu, ati. Kriyā emphasizes view of purity, deity as lord, self as servant, ritual purity. Upa maintains balanced view, deity as friend, equal external-internal emphasis. Yoga views self as deity, internal yoga primary. Mahā emphasizes generation stage; anu emphasizes completion stage; ati represents direct recognition without stages. Progressive subtlety from outer to inner demonstrates hierarchical presentation, with Atiyoga representing pinnacle of Nine Vehicle system.

[2833-2900]
Extended technical analysis of śrāvaka path stages. Stream-enterer abandons first three fetters, never reborn in lower realms. Once-returner attenuates desire and hatred, returning once more to this world. Non-returner eliminates remaining desire realm fetters, reborn in form realm. Arhat destroys all afflictions, attained exhaustion and non-arising wisdom. These four fruits subdivided into entering and abiding phases, making eight great persons. Detailed meditation stages include impurity meditation on thirty-two body parts, skeleton visualization, breath meditation on sixteen aspects. Each practice targets specific affliction with corresponding antidote.

[2901-2975]
Pratyekabuddha practice analysis. Solitary realization distinguishes this vehicle from śrāvaka's teacher-dependent approach. Cemetery meditation on dependent arising in reverse order—from death back to ignorance—produces recognition of causal chain. No need for external instruction in final life; accumulated merit from previous lives flowers spontaneously. Two types: those who congregate like parrots and those solitary like rhinoceros. Both realize person selflessness but not full emptiness of phenomena. Their realization exceeds śrāvaka's through understanding dependent arising, yet remains below bodhisattva's universal compassion.

[2976-3050]
Mahāyāna superiority established through compassion-wisdom union. Sūtra citations demonstrate emptiness without compassion leads to śrāvaka result. Bodhicitta generation distinguishes bodhisattva: intention to liberate all beings before oneself. Six perfections practiced across ten grounds, each ground marking increased capacity. First ground: joy at realizing emptiness; tenth ground: cloud of dharma, able to teach effortlessly. Five paths structure: accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, no-learning. Completion of two accumulations—merit and wisdom—produces buddhahood with three bodies.

[3051-3125]
Tantric vehicle technical sophistication. Generation stage visualization creates pure perception, transforming ordinary appearances into divine mandala. Completion stage manipulates subtle energies—winds, channels, drops—for direct realization. Outer tantras maintain deity separate from practitioner; inner tantras identify deity and practitioner as inseparable. Atiyoga transcends all stages: ground already pure, path is recognition, result is no different from ground. This structure demonstrates progressive subtlety while maintaining that highest teaching is always available.

[3126-3200]
Comprehensive structural analysis. Text establishes complete Buddhist path from foundational personal liberation through universal compassion to direct recognition. Fivefold analytical schema—essence, definition, purpose, result, divisions—maintains consistency across vehicle presentations. Each vehicle complete soteriological system with distinct view, meditation, conduct, and result. Hierarchy established through scope of motivation, depth of realization, and speed of attainment. Final position: all vehicles lead to same goal, yet Dzogchen provides most direct access.

[3201-3275]
Detailed preservation requirements for technical terminology. Vehicle classifications: nyan thos theg pa, rang sangs rgyas theg pa, byang chub sems dpa'i theg pa, theg pa chen po, gsang sngags kyi theg pa. Abhidharma schools: bye brag tu smra ba, mdo sde pa. Path structures: sbyor lam, mthong lam, bsgom lam, mi slob lam. Tantric classes: bya ba'i rgyud, u pa'i rgyud, yo ga, ma hA yo ga, a nu yo ga, a ti yo ga. Each term carries precise technical meaning requiring consistent rendering.

[3276-3350]
Extended translation risk analysis. Hierarchical presentation of Hīnayāna as inferior reflects traditional doxographical stance, not modern pluralism. This should be preserved without apologetics. Philosophical positions of Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika presented systematically for comparative analysis. Risk of imposing modern categories—idealism, realism, nominalism—on ancient Indian philosophy requires caution. Text's own categories—conventional and ultimate, person and dharma selflessness—should guide translation rather than imported frameworks.

[3351-3425]
Comprehensive preservation note on numerical correspondences. Four truths, twelve links, thirty-seven factors of enlightenment, five paths, ten grounds, six perfections, nine vehicles—numbers encode complete systematic structures. Four truths: suffering, origin, cessation, path. Twelve links: ignorance to aging and death. Thirty-seven factors: four applications of mindfulness, four abandonments, four bases of miraculous power, five faculties, five powers, seven limbs of enlightenment, eightfold path. These enumerations represent complete sets, not arbitrary selections.

[3426-3500]
Final structural analysis. Treasury presents itself as encyclopedic repository of Buddhist doctrine through comprehensive vehicle exposition. From śrāvaka's personal liberation through pratyekabuddha's solitary wisdom, bodhisattva's universal compassion, to tantric yogin's rapid transformation—complete spectrum documented. Each vehicle's philosophical foundations, practical methods, and realized goals preserved with precision. This systematic presentation demonstrates text's pedagogical sophistication and establishes foundation for individual practice selection based on capacity and inclination.

Structural function: This section establishes graduated path structure characterizing Tibetan doxography. From Hīnayāna's personal liberation through Mahāyāna's altruistic bodhicitta to Vajrayāna's rapid transformation, each vehicle builds upon yet transcends predecessor. Fivefold analytical structure maintains consistency across presentations, demonstrating systematic pedagogical methodology. Detailed meditation instructions preserve specific practice lineages with theoretical foundations.

View register: Technical terminology requires careful handling—vehicle names, philosophical schools, path structures, tantric classes. Numerical correspondences encode systematic relationships fundamental to Buddhist soteriology. Distinction between causal vehicles and resultant vehicles organizes hierarchy from śrāvakayāna through atiyoga.

Translation risks: Hierarchical presentation of vehicles, with Hīnayāna positioned as inferior, reflects traditional Tibetan doxographical conventions rather than ecumenical Buddhist pluralism. This should be preserved as explicit doctrinal position without apologetic softening or sectarian amplification. Philosophical positions of Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika represent historical Abhidharma schools presented systematically for comparative analysis.

Preservation note: Comprehensive vehicle exposition establishes the Treasury as complete presentation of Buddhist paths. Each vehicle's distinct characteristics, philosophical commitments, and practical methods are preserved with precision, demonstrating the text's role as encyclopedic repository of Buddhist doctrine and practice.
