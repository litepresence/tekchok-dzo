[2539-2546]
Śrāvakayāna exposition opening. Fivefold analytical structure: essence, definition, purpose, result, divisions. Personal liberation motivation: wanting to escape saṃsāra for oneself alone. Wisdom realizing person selflessness as method. Definition: one who hears from teacher, proclaims to others, achieves final existence bodhi, depends on teacher. Purpose: definite emergence from saṃsāra. Result: arhat attainment with remainder. Structural clarity in fivefold exposition must be preserved; resist flattening into narrative.

[2547-2556]
Vaibhāṣika subdivision exposition. Coarse conventional truth as collection-appearance like mirror and drum images. Ultimate truth as partless atoms, instantaneous, discrete like water in pot. Consciousness continuum conventional, momentary ultimate. Aggregates, elements, sense-sources as basis of knowable objects. Five main consciousness bases established while person selflessness asserted; dharmas exist as atoms and instants. Critical distinction: person empty, dharmas substantially exist. Risk of importing modern atomism; preserve ancient Indian philosophical context.

[2557-2579]
Path structure enumeration. Four truths with cause-effect knowable as rejection-acceptance. Four aspects: cause, origin, cessation, condition. Consciousness modes: suffering as knowable, origin as to be abandoned, path as to be relied upon, cessation as to be attained. Threefold abandonment: through suffering, emptiness, selflessness realization. Path of reason, cultivation, definite emergence leading to cessation, peace, excellence. Meditation on selflessness abandons 414 objects of abandonment through three realms' seeing and meditation. Exhaustion and non-production wisdoms manifested. Technical enumeration requires precision; thirty-seven factors implicit in structure.

[2580-2597]
Sautrāntika exposition. Twelve knowledges regarding four truths as objects. Eighty-eight latent afflictions abandoned. Supreme wisdom attained. Similar to Vaibhāṣika regarding person selflessness, but superior through partially transcending dharmas' domain. Five consciousness bases with parts established as main, mind basis as subsidiary. Five uncompounded bases not established, thus transcending earlier position. Two divisions maintain philosophical progression within Hīnayāna. Subtle distinction in uncompounded bases requires careful rendering.

[2598-2620]
Path cultivation details. Five paths arise in sequence during meditation. Three poisons' general antidote: selflessness and illusion meditation. Specific antidotes: impurity for desire, love for anger, dependent arising for delusion, breath-counting for discursive thought. Drowsiness antidote: light visualization at crown. Three faculties: dull, medium, sharp. Some attain in this life, others complete five paths on one seat with extensive accumulation. Structure: five paths generation, specific antidotes, faculty distinctions, attainment variations. Methodological specificity must not be reduced to generic meditation instruction.

[2621-2680]
Vehicle hierarchy and Pratyekabuddhayāna. Small, medium, great intellect produces śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, Buddha enlightenment. Mahāyāna and mantra path not desired by Hīnayāna practitioners. Eight inferior grounds for śrāvaka-pratyekabuddha. Pratyekabuddha realizes dependent arising through own power, solitary like rhinoceros, without teacher in final life. Vehicle stratification explicit: causal vehicles below, resultant vehicles above. Three capacities as organizing principle. Rhinoceros simile as solitary practice archetype.

[2681-2710]
Bodhisattvayāna exposition. Bodhicitta generation and six perfections. Two accumulations: merit and wisdom. Ten grounds and five paths. Two systems: Prajñāpāramitā and Tathāgatagarbha. Prajñāpāramitā: realizing three circles empty, perfecting six perfections, attaining buddhahood through five paths and ten grounds. Tathāgatagarbha: recognizing Buddha-nature endowed with virtues from beginning, purifying adventitious defilements, revealing spontaneously present essence. Comprehensive path structure establishing foundation for tantric vehicles. Translate *tshogs gnyis* as two accumulations, *sa bcu* as ten grounds consistently.

[2711-2832]
Resultant vehicle classification. Outer three: kriyā, upa, yoga. Inner three: mahā, anu, ati. Kriyā: view of purity, deity as lord, self as servant, ritual purity emphasis. Upa: balanced view, deity as friend, equal external-internal emphasis. Yoga: view of self as deity, internal yoga primary. Mahā: generation stage emphasis. Anu: completion stage emphasis. Ati: direct recognition without stages. Progressive subtlety from outer to inner. Preserve tantric hierarchy and distinct practice emphases. Risk of conflating stages; maintain clear distinctions.

[2833-3005]
Atiyoga detailed exposition. Two divisions: with effort, without effort. Or four: outer, inner, secret, suchness. Or six: three kayas each with three. Or three sections: mind, space, instruction. Comprehensive classification demonstrating Dzogchen as supreme. Mind section: outer, inner, secret, suchness divisions with specific teachers and texts. Space section: similar fourfold structure. Instruction section: cutting through and direct transcendence. Technical terminology: *khregs chod* as cutting through, *thod rgal* as direct transcendence. Risk of literalizing visionary language; maintain recognition-pointing function.

[3006-3993]
Detailed Atiyoga teachings. Trekcho: exhaustion of grasping at mind, recognition of primordial purity. Thogal: spontaneous vision, four lamps, four visions, light development, exhaustion into dharmakāya. Technical anatomy: channels, winds, essences. Five lights, rainbow body, dissolution processes. Visionary progression: dharmatā perception, experience development, concept exhaustion, dharma exhaustion. Detailed preservation required without medical literalization or experience-chasing interpretation. These are recognition descriptions, not recipes.

[3994-4155]
Fruition and summary. All vehicles as methods for three capacities. Dzogchen suitable for highest capacity. Seven vessel qualifications: devotion, wisdom, effort, generosity, morality, renunciation, aspiration. Atiyoga as supreme result, natural great perfection, unsurpassable. Final emphasis on spontaneity: no acceptance-rejection, no meditation, natural behavior. Comprehensive presentation complete. Translate *lhun grub* as spontaneous accomplishment consistently throughout.
