[4426-4426]
Section marker for second category. Direct introduction through three vital points. Structural function: warning passage against intellectual understanding without transmission. View register: transmission-focused, not study-focused. Translation: preserve ngo sprod, mngon sum rang ngor technical terms. Note: the phrase "view becomes mere words cast outward" (lta ba tshig phyi rol gyi 'khor) requires context for accurate rendering—refers specifically to doctrinal discussion without experiential grounding. Preservation: the three vital points (gnas rnam pa gsum) enumeration must remain intact.
