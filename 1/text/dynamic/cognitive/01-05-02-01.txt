Structural function establishes the two primary approaches to Dzogchen practice: Trekchö (khregs chod) as the path for those with instantaneous faculties (dbang po cig car ba) who recognize primordial liberation without return to the ground, and Thögal (thod rgal) as the gradual path for those with progressive faculties (dbang po rim gyis pa) who utilize the key points of channels and winds to achieve liberation. The preliminary practices (sngon 'gro gsum) and direct pointing to one's own condition (mngon sum rang gnad la 'bebs pa) serve as the foundation for both approaches, establishing the necessary preparation before engaging in the main practice. The three key points of body (lus gnad), gates (sgo'i gnad), and objects (yul gyi gnad) provide the technical framework for practice, while the integration of wind and awareness (rlung rig gi gnad) creates the conditions for realization. View register presents these two paths not as contradictory but as skillful means adapted to different capacities, both leading to the same recognition of the four visions (snang ba bzhi) and liberation. Translation risks obscure the technical distinction between cig car ba (simultaneous/sudden) and rim gyis pa (gradual) faculties, potentially reducing these to psychological types rather than recognizing them as descriptions of karmic propensities that determine appropriate method. Preservation requirements note the specific threefold key points (lus, sgo, yul gnad) that constitute the technical vocabulary of Dzogchen practice, ensuring that these precise instructions are transmitted rather than generalized into vague meditation advice.

Structural function details the specific body postures (lus kyi gnad) through three animal metaphors: lion posture (seng ge'i tshul), elephant posture (glang chen tshul), and rishi posture (drang srong lta bu), establishing physical supports for meditation that facilitate the recognition of mind nature. The gate key points (sgo'i gnad) emphasize non-movement (ma 'gul) of the gates themselves and the two clarity-producers (gsal byed rnam gnyis), creating the condition where even space itself remains unmoving. The object key points (yul gyi gnad) establish three modes of abiding: the pure expanse abiding (dag pa'i dbyings ni sdod pa), the nature of awareness abiding (de bzhin rig pa'i ngo bo sdod), and all appearances abiding (snang ba thams cad sdod pa). These technical instructions create a comprehensive framework for practice that addresses body, sense faculties, and perception simultaneously. View register presents these physical and perceptual techniques not as ends in themselves but as supports for recognizing the unchanging nature of mind, demonstrating how relative practice creates conditions for absolute realization without ever leaving the ground of primordial purity. Translation risks reduce sgo to merely "doors" without recognizing it as the technical term for sensory gates (sgo drug), or misinterpret ma 'gul as physical stillness rather than the non-movement of dualistic grasping at sensory experience. Preservation requirements maintain the specific animal metaphors for body postures, which encode not merely physical positions but the quality of presence (confidence for lion, stability for elephant, naturalness for rishi) that each posture is designed to cultivate.

Structural function presents the second type of rgyud (continuity/tantra) as rang bzhin gyi rgyud (nature tantra), encompassing the meaning of ground, path, and result (gzhi lam 'bras bu'i don). The essence (ngo bo) is identified as empty-clear-awareness (stong gsal rig pa), while the definitive terminology (nges tshig) establishes that it pervades all and has the nature of producing buddhahood. This nature tantra is divided into three: ground nature tantra (gzhi rang bzhin gyi rgyud), essence nature tantra (snying po rang bzhin gyi rgyud), and nectar nature tantra (bcud rang bzhin gyi rgyud), each representing a different aspect or perspective on the same fundamental nature. View register presents these three divisions as different ways of approaching the same reality—ground emphasizing original purity (ka dag), essence emphasizing the spontaneous presence of ye shes, and nectar emphasizing the ripened result of practice—demonstrating how Dzogchen integrates view, meditation, and result into a seamless whole. Translation risks interpret rang bzhin merely as "nature" in a general sense rather than recognizing it as the technical term for the intrinsic nature of mind that is neither produced nor destructible, the ground of all appearance without being tainted by it. Preservation requirements note the threefold division into gzhi, snying po, and bcud establishes a complete framework for understanding how the nature of mind manifests as view, meditation, and result, ensuring that readers understand these as integrated aspects of a single reality rather than sequential stages.

Structural function elaborates the ground nature tantra (gzhi rang bzhin gyi rgyud) as the original kadag rigpa possessing essence, nature, and compassion (ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje gsum), establishing the triune structure that characterizes Dzogchen ontology. The essence is primordially pure (ka nas dag pa) without even the name of ignorance, meaning that delusion is a superimposition never actually experienced by the nature of mind itself. The nature is spontaneously accomplished (lhun gyis grub pa) with rigpa clear as light, indicating that awareness is self-illuminating without dependence on external conditions. The compassion is all-pervasive (kun la khyab pa) with arising and ceasing never blocked, demonstrating that the dynamic display of appearance is inseparable from the ground. View register presents this triune structure as the foundation of Dzogchen view, where primordial purity, spontaneous presence, and all-pervasive compassion are not sequential attainments but simultaneous aspects of the nature of mind as it always already is. Translation risks reduce thugs rje to merely "compassion" in the conventional sense of wishing others free from suffering, rather than recognizing it as the technical term for the dynamic, manifestation-capacity of awareness that responds spontaneously to the needs of beings without conceptual intervention. Preservation requirements note the specific formulation ka dag, lhun grub, thugs rje gsum as the three fundamental aspects of Dzogchen view, ensuring that these are transmitted as technical terms with precise meanings rather than general spiritual vocabulary.

Structural function presents the essence nature tantra (snying po rang bzhin gyi rgyud) as the ye shes sum brtsegs (three-stacked wisdom) arising in the heart as essence, representing the potential for the four visions (snang ba bzhi) to manifest through the opening of the four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) from the eyes. The nectar nature tantra (bcud rang bzhin gyi rgyud) is described as the ripened result of practicing the vision of rigpa, characterized by emptiness without falling into marks, permanence without grasping extremes, and self-appearance of emptiness without falling into nihilism. The three clarities (gsal ba gsum), three confidences (gdeng gsum), and three non-reversions (mi ldog pa gsum) establish the qualities that accompany realization of the bcud rgyud. View register presents these progressively subtle aspects—ground as the base, essence as the potential, and nectar as the result—as demonstrating the continuity (rgyud) of Dzogchen practice, where the nature of mind never changes but its recognition deepens and ripens through practice. Translation risks obscure the technical reference to sgron ma bzhi (four lamps) as the subtle physiological and perceptual conditions for the manifestation of thögal visions, potentially reducing this to metaphor when it describes actual meditative experiences. Preservation requirements note the three clarities, three confidences, and three non-reversions constitute specific attainment-markers in Dzogchen practice, ensuring that these technical terms are preserved with their precise meanings rather than generalized into vague spiritual qualities.

Structural function continues the detailed presentation of bcud rang bzhin gyi rgyud, emphasizing the non-duality of emptiness and clarity (stong gsal dbyer mi phyed) as the actual nectar of rigpa, which when ripened to completion is called bcud (nectar/essence). The progression through dangs ma gsum (three pure essences) and gsal ba gsum (three clarities) to the ultimate fruition of the three kayas and wisdoms demonstrates the path structure within the nature tantra framework. The three visions (snang ba gsum) of the expanse without day and night, awareness without clarity-obscuration, and dharmata without change-transformation establish the perceptual characteristics of full realization. View register presents these progressively refined descriptions as demonstrating that Dzogchen realization is not a single event but a deepening recognition that transforms all aspects of experience, from gross perception to the subtlest levels of appearance, into the display of wisdom. Translation risks misrepresent dangs ma as merely "pure" without recognizing it as the technical term for the subtle essence of the elements in the completion stage, or confuse snang ba thams cad with ordinary perception rather than recognizing it as the transformed vision where all appearance is seen as deity and pure land. Preservation requirements note the specific progression from ground through essence to nectar represents the Dzogchen understanding of the path as recognition (rtogs pa) rather than transformation (bsgyur ba), ensuring that this fundamental distinction is maintained.

Structural function establishes the relationships between the various rgyud classifications, demonstrating that thabs kyi rgyud (method tantra) and rang bzhin gyi rgyud (nature tantra) are both aspects of gzhi rigpa (ground awareness), with the former representing the pointing-out (mtshon byed) and the latter the pointed-out (mtshon bya). The five different names—method tantra, nature tantra, ground, essence, and nectar—all refer to the single nature without transcending its essence, like different names for the same person. This integration establishes that all Dzogchen teachings, regardless of classification, point to the same reality of primordial purity and spontaneous presence. The three rgyud—ground, essence, and nectar—are explained as rgyud (continuity) because they connect all beings: all buddhas and sentient beings arise from the ground, recognition establishes the buddha-continuity, non-recognition establishes the sentient-being-continuity, making the ground itself the basis for both. View register presents this classification system as demonstrating the comprehensive scope of Dzogchen, which accounts for both the absolute nature and the relative methods, both the ground of being and the path of recognition, without ever confusing or conflating these two truths. Translation risks reduce the intricate classification system to mere scholasticism rather than recognizing it as the precise mapping of the relationship between view, meditation, and result that guides practitioners through the complexities of Dzogchen practice. Preservation requirements note the specific logic of why gzhi is called rgyud—because it serves as the basis (gzhi) for both samsara and nirvana, connecting all beings regardless of their recognition—ensuring that readers understand rgyud not merely as "tantra" in the sense of scripture but as "continuity" describing the unbroken nature of awareness.

Structural function cites multiple scriptural sources including Mu ti phreng ba, Sangs rgyas rnam kyi gsang chen, and others to establish the definitive meaning of nature tantra as ground, essence, and nectar, demonstrating the scriptural basis for these classifications across Dzogchen literature. The metaphor of the king, minister, and subjects (rgyal blon 'bangs gsum) illustrates the relationship between the three heart-essences (rgyud kyi snying po gsum) of rig pa rang shar, rang grol, and yi ge med pa, showing how mastery of these three brings control over all tantras like a king controlling his realm. The metaphor of reaching three mountain peaks (ri gsum rgyi rtser phyin pa) illustrates the three pure essences (rgyud kyi dangs ma gsum), demonstrating how knowledge of these brings understanding of all tantras' inner meaning. View register presents these metaphors as skillful means to convey the hierarchical yet integrated relationship between different aspects of Dzogchen teaching, where understanding the essence brings mastery of the details without needing exhaustive study of every textual classification. Translation risks interpret these metaphors literally as descriptions of social or geographical hierarchies rather than recognizing them as pedagogical devices conveying the relationship between principle and application, between view and its elaboration. Preservation requirements note the multiple scriptural citations establish the universality of these classifications across Dzogchen lineages, ensuring that readers understand these are not idiosyncratic to a single teacher but represent the shared understanding of the Great Perfection tradition.

Structural function presents the detailed classification of the seventeen tantras (rgyud bcu bdun) of Thal 'gyur (Disentangled Sound), providing both their metaphorical names and their functional descriptions. The classification begins with Rig pa rang shar as the ocean-like tantra showing the vast depth of meaning, followed by Rdo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long as the sun-like tantra showing clear illumination, and Seng ge rtsal rdzogs chen po as the lion-like tantra showing how to overwhelm lower vehicles. The metaphors continue with Ri rgyal lta bu, 'Khor lo lta bu, Lde mig lta bu, Ral gri lta bu, Gsal shing lta bu, Gser zhun lta bu, Ma bu 'brel ba lta bu, Me long lta bu, Mu tig phreng ba'i rgyud, Sbrul mdud lta bu, Khyung chen po, Chu bo lta bu, Rgyal po lta bu, Bang mdzod lta bu, and finally Nag mo khros ma. Each metaphor conveys the specific function and character of the tantra it names. View register presents these seventeen tantras as the complete expression of Dzogchen teaching through different modalities—some emphasizing view, some meditation, some conduct, some result—demonstrating that the Great Perfection can be approached from multiple angles all leading to the same recognition. Translation risks reduce these metaphorical names to mere poetic titles rather than recognizing them as precise indicators of each tantra's function, potentially obscuring the systematic relationship between metaphor and meaning that characterizes Dzogchen literature. Preservation requirements note the specific metaphorical system establishes a taxonomy of Dzogchen teachings, ensuring that the functional distinctions between these seventeen tantras are maintained for accurate transmission of which tantra addresses which aspect of practice.

Structural function details the eleven categories (sde tshan bcu gcig) for explaining the purpose (dgos ched) of the seventeen tantras, beginning with the three heart-essences of the tantra (rgyud kyi snying po gsum) which function like a king controlling his realm, the three pure essences (dangs ma gsum) which function like seeing valleys from mountain peaks, and the three flower-tantras (me tog gsum) which function like three suns dispelling darkness. The comprehensive summary (rgyud kun gyi sdom) functions like placing foundation stones for a fortress, while the complete depth of vision (snang ba gting rdzogs) functions like a fortress on a high peak. The reversing tantra of wisdom (ye shes g.yul ldog) functions like opening windows in the four directions, while the two branch-tantras (yan lag gi rgyud) function like placing battlements on the four sides. The tantra of yogic liberation functions like a king residing in the palace summit, while the heart-like tantra functions like firmly locking the door. View register presents these elaborate metaphorical classifications as demonstrating the interdependence of different aspects of Dzogchen teaching, where each tantra serves a specific function in the complete structure of practice and realization, like different architectural elements contributing to the integrity of a fortress. Translation risks misinterpret these metaphors as mere literary flourish rather than recognizing them as a sophisticated pedagogical system where each metaphor encodes specific relationships between teachings, such as the king-minister-subjects hierarchy indicating relative importance or the mountain-peak perspective indicating comprehensive vision. Preservation requirements note the specific eleven categories with their corresponding metaphors establish a complete framework for understanding the seventeen tantras' relationships and functions, ensuring that this architectural metaphor system is preserved as an integral part of Dzogchen pedagogical method.

Structural function concludes with the detailed presentation of the eight sections of definitive order (go rim gyi sde tshan brgyad), though the text appears to be cut off or incomplete at this point. The preceding material has established the complete framework for understanding Dzogchen tantra classification through the categories of method tantra, nature tantra (with its three subdivisions), and the seventeen tantras with their eleven functional categories. The integration of scriptural citation, metaphorical illustration, and technical terminology creates a comprehensive presentation of Dzogchen literature and its systematic approach to the nature of mind and its realization. The text emphasizes throughout that all these classifications ultimately point to the same reality of primordial purity and spontaneous presence, with the various categories serving as skillful means for beings of different capacities and inclinations. View register presents this elaborate classification system as both a map of the terrain of Dzogchen realization and a pedagogical device for guiding practitioners through the progressive stages of understanding, from initial introduction to complete mastery. Translation risks fragment this comprehensive presentation into disconnected lists rather than recognizing the systematic integration of all elements into a coherent whole that characterizes Dzogchen philosophy. Preservation requirements note the incomplete nature of the final section suggests either textual truncation or intentional open-endedness, but the preceding material provides sufficient framework for understanding the structure and purpose of Dzogchen tantra classification, ensuring that readers have access to the complete pedagogical system even if the final details are not fully elaborated.

Structural function presents the comprehensive summary verses from Mu ti phreng ba that systematically review all the tantra categories through extended metaphors, creating a mnemonic device for practitioners to remember the relationships between different tantras and their functions. The metaphor of the king, minister, and subjects coming together illustrates how mastery of the three heart-essences brings control over all tantras, while the metaphor of reaching three mountain peaks demonstrates how understanding the three pure essences provides comprehensive vision. The three suns shining in the sky metaphor illustrates how knowledge of the three flower-tantras dispels the darkness of confusion about tantra meaning and words. Each metaphor reinforces the pedagogical principle that understanding the essence makes mastery of details possible without exhaustive study. View register presents these concluding verses as the mnemonic distillation of the entire classification system, designed to be memorized and recalled as a complete map of Dzogchen literature and its relationships. Translation risks reduce these verses to mere summary rather than recognizing them as the essential condensation that practitioners would commit to memory, serving as the keys to unlock the entire system of seventeen tantras. Preservation requirements note the specific metaphorical language—king controlling realm, mountain peak perspective, sun dispelling darkness—creates a consistent symbolic vocabulary throughout the text, ensuring that these interlocking metaphors are maintained as a systematic pedagogical device rather than treated as random poetic imagery.
