[Structural Synthesis: Complete Condensed Meaning Tantra Framework]
This section (4283-4638) presents the complete framework of condensed meaning tantras, root tantras, Buddha-nature teachings, six spaces, letter symbolism, and four cycles. The architecture moves from condensed teachings through textual enumeration to symbolic systems (letters, spaces) and progressive approaches (four cycles). The view throughout is that Dzogchen has a vast textual tradition with precise symbolic systems, all pointing to direct recognition. The translator must preserve the technical terminology and numerical enumerations while conveying that these are supports for recognition, not ends in themselves. The six spaces show how "space" operates at multiple levels; the letter symbolism demonstrates how language encodes the nature of reality; the four cycles show progressive approaches from external scripture to direct pointing-out. This is the complete educational framework of Dzogchen—comprehensive, systematic, yet always pointing beyond itself to immediate recognition.
