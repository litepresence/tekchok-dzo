[Structural Synthesis: Complete Elaborate-Unelaborate Framework]
This section (8873-9014) presents the complete system of elaborate to unelaborate practices—four levels with outer, inner, secret, and perfect dimensions. The architecture moves from most elaborate to utterly unelaborate, showing the progression from complex ritual to direct recognition. The view throughout is that different practitioners require different methods, but all lead to the same recognition. The translator must preserve the four-by-four structure (four levels, four dimensions) while conveying that this is a graduated system, not a hierarchy of value. The elaborate practices serve those who need them; the unelaborate practices serve those ready for direct pointing. All are skillful means (thabs) for the same goal—recognition of the natural state.

The elaborate to unelaborate framework demonstrates Dzogchen's graduated approach to practice. Starting from elaborate rituals, practitioners progress toward direct recognition. Each level—elaborate, unelaborate, very unelaborate, utterly unelaborate—serves practitioners of different capacity. The four-by-four structure creates comprehensive coverage of all practice possibilities. The sixteen elaborate differences purify body and elements systematically. The four unelaborate empowerments work directly with self-recognition. The speech and mind seals liberate through fourfold analysis. The gaze practices of utterly unelaborate level point directly to the natural state. This graduated system ensures that all practitioners find appropriate entry points while all paths lead to the same recognition.
