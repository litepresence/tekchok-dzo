Essence extraction practices are divided into reliance upon various essences and reliance upon wind. The various essences include extraction from the five elements, medicines, grasses, and nectar, among which precious jewel extraction is supreme and profound. The method for combined precious jewel and five-nectar extraction involves mixing five nectars when elements are in balance, using skilled composition, placing in a jewel vessel, adding honey and ushira, adding mercury droplets, and consuming a quantity the size of a pea kernel. Practiced thus, essence extraction becomes supreme and without doubt.

Wind practice involves joining upper and lower winds, drawing into the roma channel, filling the throat wheel with nectar taste, concealing earth and water winds so all appearances become food, dissolving at throat and roma, and meditating that absorption bliss pervades, accomplishing food-yoga. Benefits include lifespan equal to sun and moon, immunity from weapons through various stone preparations, elimination of white hair and wrinkles through reliance on herbs, radiant youthfulness through essence combinations, bodily strength and vitality through flesh reliance, and wondrous essence extraction through wind reliance. This severs the torment of existence.

The distinction between austerity and essence extraction is clarified. Austerity involves consuming slight amounts of stones, water, or other supports while merely employing mantra and visualization as auxiliaries. Essence extraction, whether with pills, powders, or without supports, constitutes wind and essence yoga properly engaged.

Training in meditation sessions for cutting clothes fixation involves three practices. Deep dependent-arising includes flesh combination, stone combination, herb combination, and essence combination as explained in the Khandro Zod. Relying upon the fierce woman's fire heat involves sitting in vajra posture with joined winds, meditating fire blazing from ram at the navel pervading up to the great bliss wheel, conceiving wind through the central channel, holding wind through the left nostril with refinement, and accomplishing clothes-meditation. Wind reliance involves sitting cross-legged, drawing wind inside, holding when heat arises at the navel, slowly releasing, slightly holding wind at the feet while drawing again, generating heat, becoming free from carnivorous beings, and afflictions and concepts naturally ceasing.

Cutting dream and habituation fixation through meditation session training involves six practices: channels-winds, dreams, illusory body, clear light, transfer, and union-intermediate state. This establishes the complete framework for transforming the deep-seated patterns that bind consciousness to ordinary perception through systematic engagement with subtle body practices and transitional states.
