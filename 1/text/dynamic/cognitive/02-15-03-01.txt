The Three Kayas receive compact definition through three awareness-types: thought-free awareness as Dharmakaya nature, uninterrupted clarity as Sambhogakaya, all-possible appearance as Nirmanakaya. The structural function provides concise definitional framework for the Kayas through rigpa's modes. The view register presents Dzogchen rigpa recognition, not Abhidharma skandha analysis—the Kayas are not achieved bodies but rigpa's natural modes of presence. Translation risk: "thought-free awareness" as rigpa technical term could be interpreted through general meditative vocabulary, losing specific Dzogchen usage. Preservation requirement: maintain direct recognition framing throughout, emphasizing that the Three Kayas are already present as rigpa's nature, not bodies to be attained.

Additional expositions on Kayas would extend the definitional framework into detailed correspondences. The structural function would expand the compact definition into systematic presentation. The view register would maintain the recognition-based approach, demonstrating how each Kaya manifests through specific recognition conditions. Translation risk: expansion could shift from recognition-framing to attainment-framing, suggesting Kayas as goals rather than present nature. Preservation priority: any expansion must maintain the primordial presence of Kayas as rigpa's nature, never as achievements requiring effort or time.
