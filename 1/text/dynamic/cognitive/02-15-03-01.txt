The Three Kayas receive compact definition through three awareness-types: thought-free awareness as Dharmakaya nature, uninterrupted clarity as Sambhogakaya, all-possible appearance as Nirmanakaya. View register: Dzogchen rigpa recognition—the Kayas are not achieved bodies but rigpa's natural modes of presence. Translation risk: "thought-free awareness" as rigpa technical term could lose specific Dzogchen usage. Preservation: maintain direct recognition framing—Three Kayas are already present as rigpa's nature, not bodies to be attained.
