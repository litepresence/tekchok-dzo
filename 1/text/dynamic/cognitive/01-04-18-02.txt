Structural function introduces the conversational speech style through thought-free natural state without delusion. View register presents the non-dual characteristics free from grasping. Translation risks render "glen pa yengs la bor ba" as mere distraction rather than the technical process of releasing fixation. Preservation requirements maintain the four essential points of wind, channels, body-mind disconnection, and self-liberation of movement.

Structural function presents the sutra self-commentary oral instruction as the source of all teachings cut by suchness. View register establishes the non-difference of nature and cessation of saṃsāra support. Translation risks conflate this with lower vehicle sutra concepts. Preservation requirements note the technical term "stong nyid rtsod gzhi dang bral ba" establishes emptiness free from debate objects.

Structural function introduces the four divisions of view, beginning with the bundle-sealed style. View register distinguishes between appearance as view without contrivance and realized mind as view. Translation risks misrepresent "sgang dril" as mere compression. Preservation requirements maintain the technical precision of the view classifications as specific to man ngag sde.

Structural function continues the view exposition through absence of Buddha name, appearance as view, and measureless view-meditation. View register presents the three characteristics of essence, nature, and marks. Translation risks obscure the technical meaning of "ltos gzhi rang zad." Preservation requirements ensure the threefold liberation of afflictions, absence of acceptance-rejection, and exhaustion of paths remains distinct.

Structural function introduces the obstacle-removing lancet style through cutting the boundary between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. View view register establishes the threefold supportless nature. Translation risks misrepresent "gtar ka" as mere criticism. Preservation requirements note the two divisions of view-meditation warmth obstacle removal and entity dwelling obstacle removal.

Structural function details the view-meditation warmth obstacles through the three stages of unstable, attained, and stable. View register presents the similes of recognizing bandits, adding wood to fire, and army victory. Translation risks render these as mere pedagogical flourish rather than precise technical descriptions. Preservation requirements maintain the specific analogies for each stage and their correspondence to view, meditation, conduct, and fruition. The section concludes with the threefold essential point of conduct purifying appearance, meditation removing movement obstacles, and view removing dharmatā obstacles.

Structural function concludes the entity-dwelling obstacle removal through absence of cause-effect in nature and absence of habituation in marks. View register establishes the root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as rotten through investigation. Translation risks misrepresent "rtsa ba rul ba" as mere metaphor. Preservation requirements introduce the hidden-revealed section with its two divisions: one hidden revealing two, and two hidden revealing one.

Structural function details the first pattern where view and conduct revealed hide meditation. View register presents union without beginning or end cutting the extremes of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Translation risks conflate "zung 'jug" with tantric union concepts. Preservation requirements ensure the four combinations of hiding and revealing maintain their technical precision.

Structural function introduces the fourth self-clarifying explanation style through cutting word attachment. View register establishes establishment as supreme through non-dwelling. Translation risks render "tshig zhen rgyun chad" as mere intellectual critique. Preservation requirements note the three divisions of delusion-pursuing style, delusion-reversing style, and self-nature thigle placement.

Structural function establishes the delusion-reversing style through cutting the root of delusion as ignorance. View register presents three approaches: cutting delusion at the root, leaving delusion self-purified, and emptying the delusion basis. Translation risks conflate these with path-based methods. Preservation requirements maintain the distinction between "rtsad nas bcad" as decisive cutting versus gradual purification.

Structural function details the three approaches through essence, nature, and marks. View register establishes self-arising wisdom as first awareness and delusion-never-experienced as expansion. Translation risks misrepresent "rang rig pa dang po" as ordinary self-awareness. Preservation requirements note the technical term "khams gsum dong sprugs" as specifically dzogchen terminology.
