The text introduces dream yoga as one application of illusory body practice, distinguishing between dreams that remain unmastered and those brought under conscious direction. The practitioner trains in recognizing the dream state while maintaining awareness that ordinary perception and dream perception share the same nature—both are manifestations without inherent existence. This recognition forms the foundation for subsequent techniques that transform the dream experience from unconscious wandering into intentional practice.

The passage outlines six primary techniques for dream yoga mastery: training (sbyang ba), churning (dkrugs pa), transforming (bsgyur ba), cutting (bcad pa), extracting (gchud pa), and releasing into the essential point (gnad la bor ba). These methods work systematically to develop stability, flexibility, and depth in dream recognition. The author's experiential note emphasizes that extracting and releasing into the essential point carry particular weight in actual practice, as these methods most directly address the root of dream fixation.

The four wheels represent focal points where wind and mind are placed—typically the crown, throat, heart, and navel centers. These energetic locations serve as anchors for consciousness during the transition into sleep, allowing the practitioner to maintain continuity of recognition as waking perception dissolves. The lion's sleeping posture creates optimal conditions for engaging these points, with the body positioned to facilitate energy flow while maintaining alertness in relaxation.

Binding wind and mind at the throat center involves visualizing a red AH syllable seated upon a white four-petaled lotus. The practitioner draws appearances of both cyclic existence and transcendence into the wheel of mindfulness at the nostrils, then internalizes this focus. As subtle energy withdraws and consciousness becomes concentrated, the descent of bindu from the crown syllable HAM creates a clear appearance in the heart center, like a reflection in a mirror—vivid yet without substantial nature.

The results manifest according to the intensity of effort applied. With sharp diligence, dreams may cease before completing all contemplative focuses, as consciousness stabilizes in clear light. Moderate effort leads to rapid mastery of the dream state, while lesser diligence gradually transforms dreams into virtuous tendencies until they naturally subside. The progression moves from initially numerous dreams through diminishing frequency, paralleled by shifting from forgotten dreams to extraordinary clarity and finally to unclear residual traces.

The Thalgyur tantra presents this system in verse form, emphasizing the complete path: preliminary empowerment directing the mind to essential points, purification of body, speech, and mind, recognition of signs indicating mastery, and application of the six techniques. The three latent tendencies—training, suppression, and transformation—represent progressive stages of integration where unconscious patterns are progressively brought under conscious recognition and transformed into supports for awakening.

Dream yoga functions as guidance for transforming the fundamental confusion of habitual perception into the clarity of clear light. The text cites the practice's capacity to make delusion itself into the path, emphasizing that dream yoga does not reject ordinary consciousness but recognizes its true nature. This connects to broader illusory body practices, where daytime recognition and nighttime dream training mutually reinforce each other, dissolving the apparent boundary between waking and sleeping states.

Extracting dreams involves specific body postures and mental placements that concentrate attention at crucial energetic points. The throat center becomes particularly significant as the junction between higher and lower energy circuits. By concealing consciousness at this location through deliberate focus, the practitioner prevents dispersion into ordinary discursive thought while maintaining sufficient alertness to recognize the dream state as it arises. This method addresses the tendency for consciousness to either fall into dullness or scatter into distraction.

The visualization sequence creates a complete energetic circuit: gathering external appearances into the nose, drawing internal wind upward, receiving the descent of luminous bindu from above, and stabilizing recognition in the heart center. The red AH at the throat serves as the anchor point where wind and subtle essence are held during sleep transition. This binding of energies prevents the unconscious dissolution that ordinarily accompanies falling asleep, maintaining the thread of recognition across the threshold into the dream state.

The ultimate result manifests when dreams completely cease and sleep itself transforms into clear light. This represents not the loss of a valuable tool but its natural completion—like a raft left behind after crossing a river. The practitioner who recognizes clear light during sleep has transcended the need for dream yoga proper, though the capacity to enter dream state intentionally remains available as a skillful means for guiding others or specific purposes.
