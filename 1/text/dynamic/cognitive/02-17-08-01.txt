This section presents dream yoga instructions as part of the illusory body practices, establishing a systematic approach to working with the dream state as a vehicle for transformation. The structural function moves from preliminary recognition through various techniques to final integration with clear light. The opening distinction between dreams not mastered and those mastered establishes the developmental framework, with the instruction that practitioners should churn and reverse each other's understanding to accomplish training.

The register operates in the domain of dream yoga technical terminology: dream conduct (rmi lam spyod), recognition (zin pa), training ('byongs pa), crucial points (gnad), churning (dkrugs pa), reversing (bzlos), throwing (phyal phyol du sbyangs). The four wheels ('khor lo bzhi'i gnas) as locations for placing wind and mind indicate specific energetic centers within the subtle body. The lion's sleeping posture (seng ge'i nyal lugs) appears as a technical instruction for both physical position and energetic engagement.

Translation risks center on preserving the sequence of techniques: training, churning, transforming, cutting, throwing, and releasing into the crucial point. These form an integrated system where each technique builds upon the previous. The description of the red AH on a white four-petaled lotus at the throat center presents a specific visualization requiring precise anatomical and symbolic preservation. The crucial point of wind and mind binding at the throat when sleeping establishes a technical instruction for maintaining awareness during sleep onset.

The developmental progression described—from many dreams initially to few finally, from forgetting to clarity—must remain intact as a recognition framework for practitioners. The distinction between sharp, medium, and dull diligence establishing different results provides a realistic assessment of the practice's trajectory. The final integration with clear light establishes the completion of the dream yoga path.

This subsection enumerates the six techniques for dream yoga: training, churning, transforming, cutting, throwing, and releasing into the crucial point. The structural function presents these as a complete system, with the author noting that while all six are taught, the current context emphasizes throwing and releasing as most crucial based on personal experience. This authorial voice adds experiential authority to the technical instructions.

The register maintains dream yoga terminology: training (sbyang ba), churning (dkrugs pa), transforming (bsgyur ba), cutting (bcad pa), throwing (gchud pa), releasing into crucial point (gnad la bor ba). The mention of the three—churning at the channel-wheel center, cutting, and releasing into the crucial point—establishes a condensed practice for those with less capacity while affirming the completeness of the full sixfold system.

Preservation requires maintaining the hierarchy of techniques without imposing external value judgments. The author's experiential note that "I have experienced this as most crucial" (bdag gis kyang nyams su blangs pas nges pa yin no) establishes a pattern of personal validation that runs through the text. This voice must be preserved without either over-emphasizing or dismissing it as merely subjective.

This passage details the wind and mind binding technique as the essential companion for all dream yoga practice. The structural function establishes this as the core method upon which all other techniques depend, presenting specific instructions for wind manipulation during the lion's sleeping posture. The technical description involves gathering all appearances of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa into the wheel of mindfulness at the nose, then drawing wind internally.

The register operates in subtle body terminology: wind bindu (rlung gi thig le), net (dra ba), lion's sleeping posture (seng ge'i nyal lugs), wheel of mindfulness (dran pa'i 'khor lo), bindu descending from HAM (thig le babs pa), mirror-like reflection (me long gi gzugs brnyan). The technique of wind slow projection gathering all appearances establishes a specific energetic practice for dream state entry.

Translation risks involve the precise description of wind movement and visualization. The gathering of appearances at the crown as bindu descending from HAM, then focusing on the heart center as mirror-like clear appearance, requires careful handling to preserve both the anatomical references and the phenomenological experience. The instruction to "hold wind and clarity at the throat" when sleeping presents a subtle technique that must remain clear without oversimplification.

[3082-3092]

This subsection addresses the results of binding the crucial points, establishing the progressive exhaustion of dreams and latent tendencies. The structural function presents a realistic assessment of different capacities: sharp diligence may stop dreams before completing all focuses, medium diligence quickly masters dreams, while dull diligence transforms into virtuous tendencies before eventual cessation. This nuanced presentation acknowledges varying capacities without diminishing the path's integrity.

The register maintains dream yoga result terminology: exhaustion of dreams and latent tendencies (rmi lam dang bag chags mthar zad), delusion awakened ('khrul pa sangs), clear light of sleep (gnyid 'od gsal). The progression from many dreams initially to few finally, from forgetting to clarity, then to unclear, establishes a recognizable trajectory for practitioners.

Preservation requires maintaining the developmental logic without imposing linear expectations. The description that "these also go from many dreams initially to few finally" indicates a natural progression that may not match all practitioners' experiences. The final state of sleep becoming clear light, with dreams awakened as clear light, establishes the completion of the practice.

This extended citation from the Thalgyur tantra provides scriptural authority for the dream yoga instructions, presenting the complete system in verse form. The structural function integrates textual authority with practical instructions, demonstrating the scriptural basis for the techniques previously described. The verses cover the preliminary empowerment, body-speech-mind training, signs of mastery, and the six techniques.

The register maintains tantric verse terminology: crucial path of dreams (rmi lam gnad kyi lam khyer), signs of mastery ('byongs pa'i rtags), throwing and releasing (gchud pa, gnad la bor ba), reversed gathering (bskyil bzlog). The three latent tendencies to be determined—training, suppression, and transformation—establish a comprehensive framework for understanding dream content.

Translation risks center on preserving the verse structure while maintaining technical precision. The description of exhaustion of karmic dreams and awakening of confused perception from the root requires careful handling to preserve both the metaphorical language and the technical meaning. The final verses on capacity—sharp, medium, dull—establish the realistic framework for practice results.

[3116-3123]

This concluding section identifies the dream yoga instructions as the guidance for transforming delusion into clear light, citing the tantra on sleep yoga. The structural function provides closure while establishing the soteriological significance of the practice. The transition to illusory body (sgyu lus) indicates the next topic in the systematic presentation.

The register shifts to include soteriological terminology: transforming delusion into clear light (gti mug 'od gsal du sgyur ba), guidance (gdams pa), sleep yoga (gnyid kyi rnal 'byor), illusory body (sgyu lus), apparitional existence (snang srid sgyu ma). The twofold training—daytime reflection training and nighttime dream training—establishes the comprehensive nature of the practice.

Preservation requires maintaining the relationship between dream yoga and illusory body as integrated practices rather than separate techniques. The final note that some explain dream training as the main practice of illusory body, while here it serves as preliminary, indicates different pedagogical approaches that must be preserved without imposing hierarchical judgments.
