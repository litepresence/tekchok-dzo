Secret empowerment (gsang dbang): two bodhicittas given—representing the union of means and wisdom. Prajñā-Jñāna empowerment (shes rab ye shes kyi dbang): mudrā meditation for unattached practitioners, action-seal for those with attachment. Word empowerment (tshig dbang): realization wisdom of view, meditation, and rigpa. These four empowerments represent the middling elaboration (mngon rtogs bar pa) of practice.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents the standard four-empowerment sequence of Highest Yoga Tantra within the specific context of colored-powder maṇḍala consecration. The recognition required is that these empowerments create the conditions for recognition—vase empowerment authorizes creation-phase practice, secret empowerment authorizes subtle body practice, prajñā-jñāna empowerment authorizes conduct, and word empowerment points directly to the nature of mind. The translator must preserve the technical terminology of the empowerment sequence while maintaining the understanding that these are authorization rituals, not magical transmissions of power.
