[8724]
Speech identity transition. Sequential enumeration structure: second item mixing with speech becomes self-natured as speech. Brief ornamental marker indicating progression through body-speech-mind triad. Context suggests this is part of larger three-fold classification where first was body, second is speech, third will be mind. Preserve the transitional brevity—this line serves as structural bridge, not substantive doctrine.
