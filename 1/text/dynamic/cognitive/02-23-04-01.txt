Comprehensive extended analysis. Five elements dissolution section presents detailed process of death and intermediate state in Dzogchen cosmology. Dissolution proceeds through stages: first outer five elements dissolve into inner five, then inner into secret five, then secret into completely perfect elements, finally into great path. Each element has specific signs indicating dissolution. Earth dissolving brings loss of body strength, fading memory, and specific signs for each type of earth element. Water dissolving brings flowing secretions, drying mouth and nose, upward turning eyes. Fire dissolving brings loss of body heat and consciousness clarity. Process culminates in emergence of dharmata bardo when rigpa dissolves into space, creating opportunity for liberation through recognition of clear light naturally arising.
