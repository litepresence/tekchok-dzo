Element dissolution at death. Five outer elements dissolve: earth into earth—power lost, memory declines. Water into water—fluids drip, mouth/nose dry, eyes roll upward. Fire into fire—heat rises, memory ceases, lamp not seen. Wind into wind—luster fades, breath rough, ceases. Inner elements dissolve: five space elements into sphere of awareness—face grasped. Five subtle elements into life-force, five life-forces enter awareness at heart center. Light-channel, hollow space, bindu, five lights—body as awareness possessing mansion of light—dissolve. Four lamps appear, Dharmakaya bardo self-resounding outwardly clear appearing. Special: earth dissolves into earth—emptiness emerges, wisdom latent; water dissolves—wisdom moistens. Structural note: detailed Dzogchen death process—element dissolution leading to bardo realization.
