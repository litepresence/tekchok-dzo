Comprehensive extended analysis. The five elements dissolution section presents the detailed process of death and the intermediate state in Dzogchen cosmology. The dissolution proceeds through stages: first the outer five elements dissolve into the inner five, then the inner into the secret five, then the secret into completely perfect elements, and finally into the great path. Each element has specific signs indicating its dissolution. Earth dissolving brings loss of body strength, fading memory, and specific signs for each type of earth element—universal appearing, unchanging vajra, all-arising jewel, appearance showing infinite, and accomplishment complete. Water dissolving brings flowing secretions, drying mouth and nose, upward turning eyes, with signs for unchanging, peace clear, qualities arising, attachment-free, and grasping-free water. Fire dissolving brings loss of body heat and consciousness clarity, with signs for all-pervading, all-equal, and activity knowing fire. The process culminates in the emergence of the dharmata bardo when rigpa dissolves into space, creating the opportunity for liberation through recognition of the clear light that naturally arises. Through comprehensive documentation, complete understanding is established.
