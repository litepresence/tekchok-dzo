Structural function: This section continues the training in illusory body recognition, establishing the mirror-reflection contemplation as the foundation for recognizing all phenomena as illusory display. The text presents a progressive methodology: first recognizing external phenomena as mirror reflections, then extending this recognition to include one's own body, and finally realizing the bardo illusory body as the natural expression of this training. This structural progression from external to internal recognition mirrors the standard contemplative development path in Dzogchen practice literature.

[3124-3135]
View register: The perspective here belongs to the Dzogchen illusory-body doctrine, specifically the recognition that all appearances lack inherent existence while manifesting clearly. The mirror metaphor captures the essence: reflections appear vividly without substantial existence, phenomena manifest while being empty of self-nature. This view enables the practitioner to engage with appearances without the reification that generates cyclic existence. The specific contemplation of one's own body as a mirror reflection—dressing it, adorning it, then recognizing the insubstantiality of such modifications—serves as the direct recognition practice.

[3148-3168]
Preservation note: The multiple scriptural citations—from the Inquiry of Bhadrapāla Sūtra and the King of Samādhi Sūtra—establish the canonical authority for the illusory-body view. These citations include the classic similes: water-moon, magical illusion, plantain tree without core. Each simile illuminates a specific dimension of the illusory nature: the water-moon demonstrates appearance without substance, the magical illusion shows creation without inherent existence, the plantain tree reveals the absence of essential core. These traditional similes require preservation for their established contemplative resonance.

[3169-3197]
Structural function: This section addresses nighttime dream training as the continuation and intensification of daytime illusory-body practice. The structural arrangement establishes the mutual reinforcement of daytime and dream recognition: as all appearances become recognized as dream-illusion during waking, the dream state naturally reflects this recognition. This continuous training leads to the dream illusory body, which serves as the direct preparation for the bardo illusory body. The text explicitly identifies this training as the mark of the "last existence being," establishing its soteriological significance.

[3178-3197]
View register: The perspective here presents the recognition that birth, death, acceptance, rejection, and all confused appearances are dream-illusion. This view dissolves the fixations that bind consciousness to cyclic existence. The citation from the Ornament of Clear Realization establishes that dream recognition constitutes the peak of the path of preparation, with its twelve signs of progress. The exemplary references to the precious master Gyalwa Zhangton and the scholar Nyibum establish the attainability of this realization through dedicated practice.

[3100-3123]
Translation risk: The term "last existence being" refers to the practitioner who, having achieved recognition of the illusory nature of all appearances, will no longer take ordinary rebirth. This technical designation requires precise rendering to avoid confusion with other soteriological categories. The "dream illusory body" represents a specific attainment within the six yogas tradition, distinct from the waking illusory body yet continuous with it. The distinction between the shadow-like appearance of the body and the actual dream illusory body requires careful technical precision to maintain doctrinal coherence.

[3198-3250]
Structural function: This section establishes the comprehensive scope of illusory-body training, extending recognition to all possible experiences. The structural arrangement presents a catalog of dualistic fixations to be dissolved: self and other, friend and enemy, food and clothing, pleasant and unpleasant, acceptance and rejection, birth and death, happiness and suffering, illness. This enumerative approach ensures no aspect of experience remains outside the scope of recognition, establishing the all-encompassing nature of the practice.

[3251-3300]
View register: The perspective here presents the equalization of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa through illusory recognition. The view that all saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dharmas appear like reflections in a mirror while lacking inherent existence dissolves the fundamental dualism that perpetuates cyclic existence. This recognition enables engagement with all phenomena without the grasping that generates suffering. The cultivation of this view without distraction establishes the continuous recognition that transforms ordinary perception into the path.

[3301-3350]
Preservation note: The detailed description of mirror-reflection practice—dressing the reflection, removing clothes, offering praise, speaking ill—establishes a specific contemplative protocol. This practice structure requires preservation for its function as a meditation support. The recognition that the reflection appears without being established in reality serves as the template for recognizing all phenomena. The concluding certainty regarding the attainment of the bardo illusory body establishes the soteriological trajectory of the practice.

[3351-3400]
Structural function: This section presents the fruit of illusory-body training: the bardo illusory body as the natural expression of recognition. The structural arrangement establishes the progression from daytime training through dream recognition to bardo attainment. The exemplary masters demonstrate the attainability of this realization, grounding the teaching in lived experience. The scriptural citations from the Talgyur establish the textual authority for the direct relationship between dream training and bardo recognition.

[3401-3450]
View register: The perspective here presents the bardo illusory body as the continuation of recognition beyond the dissolution of the physical body. The view that one has "captured" the bardo body through dream training establishes the continuity of consciousness across states. This recognition dissolves the fear of death and the uncertainty of the intermediate state, replacing them with confident recognition of the illusory nature of all appearances. The shadow-like appearance of the trained body serves as the bridge between waking recognition and bardo recognition.

[3451-3500]
Translation risk: The technical distinction between the ordinary body, the dream illusory body, and the bardo illusory body requires precise rendering. These represent progressive recognitions rather than substantially different entities. The term "shadow-like" captures the appearance of the trained practitioner—present yet insubstantial, visible yet empty. This technical description requires careful preservation to maintain its function as a recognition sign.

[3501-3550]
Structural function: This section establishes the comprehensive nature of illusory-body recognition, extending to all possible experiences without exception. The structural arrangement presents the finality of this training: having recognized all appearances as illusory, the practitioner no longer fixates on any appearance as inherently existent. This establishes the foundation for the subsequent practices of clear light and bardo recognition, demonstrating how illusory-body training serves as the preliminary for all advanced practices.

[3551-3600]
View register: The perspective here presents the dissolution of all fixations through illusory recognition. The view that all appearances—from the most pleasant to the most painful—are equally illusory dissolves the selective grasping that perpetuates cyclic existence. This equalization of all experience establishes the equanimity that characterizes advanced practice. The recognition extends to all saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dharmas, dissolving the final duality between path and fruition.

[3601-3650]
Preservation note: The concluding scriptural citations establish the authoritative basis for illusory-body practice and its results. These citations function as both validation and practice supports, requiring preservation in their relational context. The final identification of this training as establishing the "self-capture of the bardo body" captures the essential function of the practice: preparing the practitioner for recognition in the death transition.
