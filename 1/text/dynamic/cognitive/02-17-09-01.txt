The practice begins with mirror contemplation—recognizing that external phenomena appearing in the mind share the nature of reflections: manifesting clearly without existing independently. The practitioner examines this by observing how appearances seem substantial yet lack inherent existence upon investigation. This recognition gradually extends from external objects to include all internal experiences, dissolving the apparent boundary between outer and inner, matter and consciousness, self and other.

The comprehensive scope of illusory body practice encompasses every possible experience without exception. Self and other appearances, friend and enemy relationships, material necessities like food and clothing, all sensory enjoyments, pleasant and unpleasant sounds, philosophical positions of acceptance and rejection, the fundamental events of birth and death, emotional experiences of happiness and suffering, physical conditions of illness—all are brought within the scope of recognition. Nothing is excluded from this view, for exclusion itself would constitute a subtle form of reification.

The text provides scriptural authority from the Inquiry of Bhadrapāla Sūtra and the King of Samādhi Sūtra. These citations employ three primary analogies: the water-moon (appearing clearly yet empty of substance), magical illusions (creations without inherent existence), and the plantain tree (lacking a solid core). Each metaphor points to the same recognition—that phenomena appear vividly while being empty of independent nature. The mirror itself becomes the primary symbol: it reflects all forms without being affected, modified, or limited by what appears within it.

The recognition of birth and death as illusory dissolves the fundamental anxiety that drives cyclic existence. When the practitioner views these transitions as dream-appearances, the compulsive grasping that perpetuates rebirth naturally relaxes. The text cites the example of a young woman dreaming of giving birth to a son—her joy at his birth and grief at his death, both intense yet both equally unreal. All phenomena share this nature: manifesting clearly without existing as they appear.

At this stage, qualities of the path of preparation may naturally manifest. The Ornament of Clear Realization describes twelve signs indicating the peak of the path of preparation: viewing all phenomena within dreams as dreamlike. This represents not imagination but the natural expression of recognition having permeated the mindstream so thoroughly that it operates regardless of the state—waking, dreaming, or meditative absorption.

Through continuous daytime and nighttime training in illusory body, fixation on inherent existence dissolves. The body itself begins to manifest shadow-like—appearing clearly without substantial solidity. This recognition prepares the practitioner for the bardo illusory body, ensuring confidence in navigating the intermediate state. Historical examples include the precious guru Gyalwa Zhangton and the scholar Nyibum, who demonstrated this capacity through their own realization and manifestation.
