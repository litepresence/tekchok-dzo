Structural function: Nature of expanse (dbyings) presentation—essential nature analysis. Expanse as vast and expansive (rgya yangs), great identity of clarity, self-illuminating. Definitive terms: called "center" (dkyil) and "expanse" (dbyings)—Dharmatā's nature vast without limit. View register: Dzogchen technical analysis of spatial/expanse terminology. Translation risk: Rendering dbyings as "space" or "sphere" loses the specific Dzogchen valence of luminous, aware expanse. Preservation: The connection to dharmadhātu and dharmatā must remain audible.

Four aspects of expanse enumerated: (1) outer expanse (phyi'i dbyings) as space; (2) inner expanse (nang dbyings) as lamp; (3) secret expanse (gsang ba'i dbyings) as light and bindu; (4) unsurpassed expanse (bla na med pa'i dbyings) as great display of self-liberated delusory appearance. Progressive order: awareness, wisdom, three kayas are domain of fruition. Characteristic: opens to vast, has capacity to appear, pervades—appears as domain of clarity like mirror.

Extended recognition that dharmatā is not a thing in itself—it brings forth power to clarify domain through which dharmatā appears. This is the crucial Dzogchen view: expanse is not a container or location but the luminous, aware nature of mind itself. The four aspects represent progressive subtlety from outer physical space to innermost self-liberated display.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents the Dzogchen analysis of expanse (dbyings) as one of the key technical terms. The recognition required is that dbyings is not mere emptiness or space but luminous, aware expanse—the ground from which all appearance arises. The translator must preserve the technical precision of the fourfold classification while maintaining the understanding that these are aspects of mind's nature, not external spatial categories.
