Nature of expanse (dbyings). Essential nature: vast and expansive, great identity of clarity, self-illuminating. Definitive terms: called "center" and "expanse"—Dharmatā's nature vast without limit. Four aspects: outer expanse (space), inner expanse (lamp), secret expanse (light and bindu), unsurpassed expanse (great display of self-liberated delusory appearance). Progressive order: awareness, wisdom, three kayas are domain of fruition. Characteristic: opens to vast, has capacity to appear, pervades—appears as domain of clarity like mirror. Dharmatā not thing in itself—it brings forth power to clarify domain through which Dharmatā appears. Structural note: Dzogchen analysis of expanse terminology.
