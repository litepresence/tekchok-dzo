Ringsel (relics) section—detailing the colors, sizes, locations, and causes of these bodily manifestations of spiritual accomplishment. Colors: blue-black, yellow, red, green, white luster, dark-blue, red-green-black mixtures. Sizes: ranging from poppy seed to small mustard seed—big and small variations, oily texture, round shape, gathered clusters. Locations: head (top of skull), rib joint, liver top, kidney area, lung top. Causes: peaceful relics arise from pure bone, heat, blood, elements, and awareness gathered in the body. Wrathful relics manifest from skull luster at head, pure blood at joints and feet, from pure five elements. Five relics of very round shape, oily, gathered appearance. Structural function: Dzogchen tantric physiology of ringsel (rdul phran/ringsel) as material signs of spiritual realization.

[Extended Analysis: Ringsel as Spiritual Accomplishment]
Ringsel (also called rdul phran—small particles) are spherical pearl-like substances found in the bodily remains of advanced practitioners after cremation. They represent the materialization of spiritual accomplishment—the subtle essences (thig le) refined through practice. View register: ringsel as natural manifestation of inner transformation, not magical production. Translation risk: ringsel appearing as superstitious fetish or mere mineral deposit. Preservation: ringsel are recognized across Tibetan Buddhist traditions as signs of realization—their presence indicates successful transformation of the physical basis through practice.

[Extended Analysis: Color Classifications]
The colors of ringsel correspond to the five Buddha families and five elements: blue-black (Akshobhya/water), yellow (Ratnasambhava/earth), red (Amitabha/fire), green (Amoghasiddhi/air), white (Vairocana/space). Additional colors—white luster, dark-blue, red-green-black mixtures—indicate blended or advanced manifestations. View register: colors as indicators of which wisdoms have been stabilized. Translation risk: color classification appearing arbitrary. Preservation: each color corresponds to specific energetic and wisdom qualities—the practitioner in whom Akshobhya's dharmadhātu wisdom is prominent may produce blue ringsel.

[Extended Analysis: Size Variations]
Sizes range from poppy seed (nyi 'bras) to small mustard seed (yungs kar)—tiny yet distinct spheres. "Big and small" (che chung) variations indicate different degrees or aspects of accomplishment. View register: size as secondary to presence, not hierarchical ranking. Translation risk: larger ringsel suggesting greater accomplishment. Preservation: size varies based on many factors; presence of ringsel is the significant indicator. Some traditions say larger ringsel indicate compassion-manifestation, smaller indicate wisdom-manifestation—both valid, neither superior.

[Extended Analysis: Texture and Shape]
The "oily" (snum pa) texture indicates the essences (thig le) refined into smooth, lustrous form. "Round shape" (zlum po) represents the bindu-nature—spherical completeness. "Gathered" (bsdoms pa) indicates clusters or groupings. View register: physical characteristics as expressions of inner refinement. Translation risk: literal materialism or dismissive skepticism. Preservation: the oily, round, gathered qualities indicate successful transmutation of bodily essences—the coarse has been refined into subtle, the scattered into gathered.

[Extended Analysis: Location Correspondences]
Locations correspond to chakras and elements: head (crown chakra, space element), rib joint (heart chakra), liver top (navel chakra, fire element), kidney area (secret chakra, water element), lung top (throat chakra, air element). View register: body as mandala, ringsel appearing at power centers. Translation risk: anatomical literalism. Preservation: these are energetic centers (rtsa 'khor) where refined essences gather. The specific locations indicate which chakras were most activated or purified in the practitioner's practice.

[Extended Analysis: Peaceful Relics Causes]
Peaceful ringsel (zhi ba'i ringsel) arise from pure bone (rus pa), heat (drod), blood (khrag), elements ('byung ba), and awareness (rig pa) gathered and refined in the body. View register: peaceful relics from pacifying practices, transformation of ordinary constituents. Translation risk: cause-effect appearing as material process only. Preservation: the "causes" are the purification practices—bone practices, tummo heat, essence refinement, element transformation, awareness cultivation. The ringsel are the residual signs of these transformations.

[Extended Analysis: Wrathful Relics Causes]
Wrathful ringsel (khro bo'i ringsel) manifest from skull luster (thod 'od) at head, pure blood at joints (tshigs) and feet (zhabs), from pure five elements. These indicate more forceful, energetic transformation. View register: wrathful relics from energetic practices, rapid transmutation. Translation risk: wrathful suggesting violence or anger. Preservation: khro bo means fierce or powerful—indicating the intensity of transformation, not emotional state. Wrathful relics often appear in practitioners of wrathful deity yoga or those with powerful energy practices.

[Extended Analysis: Five Relics Configuration]
The "five relics" (ringsel lnga) of very round shape, oily, gathered, represent the five Buddha families or five wisdoms manifested physically. This complete set indicates comprehensive accomplishment across all dimensions. View register: five as complete mandala, not partial achievement. Translation risk: "five" as numerical quota. Preservation: the five together represent the complete transformation—the practitioner has stabilized all five wisdoms, all five elements purified. Single ringsel or partial sets also indicate accomplishment; five together indicates completeness.

[Extended Analysis: Dzogchen Tantric Physiology]
The section operates within Dzogchen tantric physiology—the body as the basis for transformation through working with channels (rtsa), winds (rlung), and essences (thig le). Ringsel represent the most refined product of this work. View register: body as vehicle for enlightenment, not obstacle. Translation risk: body-neglecting spirituality or body-obsessed materialism. Preservation: Dzogchen respects the body as the support for realization—ringsel demonstrate that even the physical can be transmuted into wisdom-display. This is not about preserving the body but about demonstrating complete transformation.

[Extended Analysis: Signs of Realization]
Across Tibetan Buddhism, ringsel are accepted as signs of realization (rtags)—indicators that the practitioner achieved genuine accomplishment. They are not the realization itself but its physical signature. View register: signs as confirmations, not the goal. Translation risk: seeking ringsel as objective or proof. Preservation: ringsel naturally manifest when realization is profound—they cannot be produced deliberately. Their presence confirms; their absence does not deny. Many realized masters leave no ringsel, some leave many—neither indicates superiority.

[Extended Analysis: Post-Cremation Discovery]
Ringsel are typically discovered after cremation of advanced practitioners' bodies. The fire releases the refined essences that ordinary cremation would destroy. View register: fire as transformation agent, not destruction. Translation risk: cremation appearing as disrespect or disposal. Preservation: in Tibetan tradition, cremation of high masters is honor—the fire releases the realized consciousness and reveals the ringsel. The discovery is a moment of confirmation and blessing for disciples.

[Extended Analysis: Relic Veneration]
Ringsel are venerated as sacred relics (ring bsrel)—objects of refuge and blessing. They are placed in stupas, worn in amulets, or used in practice. View register: veneration as support for faith, not idolatry. Translation risk: relic worship as superstition. Preservation: the veneration is for what the ringsel represent—the presence of realization. Like venerating a master's robes, the ringsel connect practitioners to the realized presence. The blessing (byin rlabs) is real because the transformation was real.

[Structural Synthesis: Ringsel as Complete Physiological Transformation]
This section (11480-11735) presents the complete taxonomy of ringsel as material signs of spiritual accomplishment in Dzogchen tantric physiology. The architecture details colors, sizes, locations, and causes, establishing ringsel as the physical residue of profound inner transformation. The view throughout is that ringsel represent the successful refinement of bodily essences into wisdom-display—the coarse elements transmuted into subtle, luminous form. The translator must preserve the physiological specificity while conveying that ringsel are natural manifestations of realization, not magical productions. The five colors correspond to five wisdoms, the locations to five chakras, the causes to purification practices—ringsel thus encode the complete mandala of transformation in material form.
