Structural function: Speech samaya (gsung dam tshig) comprehensive presentation with three levels—outer, inner, secret—each further divided into outer-outer, outer-inner, outer-secret, plus secret three. Speech samaya outer's outer: abandoning falsehood. Citation from Wheel-Stacked Tantra (dkyil 'khor brtsegs rgyud) on mantra inclination conduct—migrating in world with common ones, speaking false words for self-desire, experiencing joy but mantra recitation power does not arise. Speaking what others spoke as not holy, speech degenerates, migrating in world as tongue-drip. Future consequences: gadfly body, Northern direction, bad-migrate suffering with various aspects.

Speech samaya outer-inner: not speaking slander. Same source instruction—mantra-entered person who speaks slander dividing two, does not gather Dharma circles, has done wrong, not practiced, enemy strikes body with weapon, dies clawed body, sequences to bad-migration. Outer-secret: abandoning harsh-words. Same—speaking harsh-words, karma sign, migrating in world lacking love, friend hates, seeks Dharma words, dies pride body, bad-migration in three circles.

Two-Joined Mudra warning: vajra brother sister with cut word speech, for aeons hundred million, bad-migration suffering unbearable. This experience shows former not-done present sign, sequence experience—former done in life middle last, former life earlier, this done karma end. Life measure speech karma, circle tongue-drip, sudden speech stream stop. Guru son wife, near-dwell ones suffice, exceeding command and samaya creates former karma two-times. Guru distinction between root and branch—speech exceed spoke, exaggerate-blame desire-word creates former karma thousand-times, aspect ripen unbearable.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents detailed samaya commitments for speech with extensive consequences for violations. The recognition required is that samaya protects the practitioner's energy and realization—violation creates specific obstacles. The translator must preserve concrete imagery of consequences while maintaining understanding of natural results, not arbitrary punishments.
