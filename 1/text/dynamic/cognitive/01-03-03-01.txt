[1732-1799]
Faculties (dbang po) detailed analysis. Form faculties (gzugs kyi dbang po): eye (mig), ear (rna ba), nose (sna), tongue (lce), body (lus) faculties as subtle material basis of perception. Life faculty (srog gi dbang po) as vital principle. View register: Abhidharma classification system.

[Extended Analysis: Wisdom Faculties]
Wisdom faculties (shes rab kyi dbang po): faith (dad pa), effort (brtson 'grus), mindfulness (dran pa), samādhi (ting nge 'dzin), wisdom (shes rab). Those learning (slob pa) and those beyond learning (mi slob pa) each with five faculties. View register: faculties as supports for enlightenment.

[Extended Analysis: Gender Faculties]
Gender faculties (pho mo'i dbang po): female (mo), male (pho). Distinguishing biological sex as faculty. View register: gender as conditioning factor.

[Extended Analysis: Suffering and Happiness Faculties]
Suffering and happiness faculties (sdug bsngal dang bde ba'i dbang po): capacity to experience pleasure and pain. Mental faculty (yid kyi dbang po): the sixth sense, mind. Twenty-two faculties total in Abhidharma system. View register: comprehensive classification.

[Extended Analysis: Enumeration Not Hierarchy]
Enumeration serves comprehensive classification, not hierarchy. View register: systematic description, not ranking.

[1800-1849]
Detailed phenomenological analysis continuation. Consciousness and object relationships examined through faculty-object pairing. Each faculty has specific object range (yul), specific manner of engagement ('jug tshul). View register: precise phenomenology.

[Extended Analysis: Not Mechanical Process]
Not mechanical process but conditioned arising (rten 'brel). View register: dependent origination, not determinism.

[Extended Analysis: Preserve Technical Abhidharma Terminology]
Preserve technical Abhidharma terminology: dbang po as faculty, yul as object, rnam par shes pa as consciousness. View register: technical precision required.

[1850-1901]
Faculty-element correspondences. Form faculties arise from elements: eye from fire (me), ear from wind (rlung), nose from earth (sa), tongue from water (chu), body from all five. View register: elemental basis of senses.

[Extended Analysis: Wisdom Faculties from Mind]
Wisdom faculties arise from mind (sems) and mental factors (sems byung). View register: spiritual faculties as mental development.

[Extended Analysis: Complex Mapping System]
Complex mapping system preserving Buddhist cosmology. Not scientific physiology but soteriological classification. Translate without modernizing or medicalizing. View register: traditional system requiring preservation.

[Extended Analysis: Eye Faculty and Fire Element]
The eye faculty (mig gi dbang po) arises from the fire element (me) according to Abhidharma cosmology. Fire provides the illuminating quality necessary for vision—the capacity to apprehend form and color. Without the fire element's penetrating quality, visual consciousness could not arise. View register: elemental basis of perception.

[Extended Analysis: Ear Faculty and Wind Element]
The ear faculty (rna ba'i dbang po) arises from the wind element (rlung). Wind provides movement and penetration—the capacity to apprehend sound as vibration traveling through medium. Sound is essentially vibration, and wind is the element of motion. View register: hearing as movement.

[Extended Analysis: Nose Faculty and Earth Element]
The nose faculty (sna'i dbang po) arises from the earth element (sa). Earth provides stability and support—the capacity to hold and identify odors. Smell requires a stable basis for the olfactory objects to be recognized. View register: smell as grounded perception.

[Extended Analysis: Tongue Faculty and Water Element]
The tongue faculty (lce'i dbang po) arises from the water element (chu). Water provides fluidity and cohesion—the capacity to dissolve and taste. Flavor requires moisture to be experienced; dryness cannot taste. View register: taste as dissolution.

[Extended Analysis: Body Faculty and All Five Elements]
The body faculty (lus kyi dbang po) arises from all five elements. Touch requires all qualities—hardness (earth), moisture (water), heat (fire), movement (wind), and space (space). The body is the most comprehensive sense faculty. View register: touch as total engagement.

[Extended Analysis: Life Faculty as Continuity]
The life faculty (srog gi dbang po) is not merely biological life but the vital principle that maintains continuity of consciousness and form. It is the faculty that keeps the continuum alive from moment to moment. View register: life as maintaining factor.

[Extended Analysis: Faith Faculty]
The faculty of faith (dad pa'i dbang po) is confidence in what is worthy of confidence—the Dharma, the path, the teacher. It is not blind belief but clear confidence based on investigation. View register: faith as supportive faculty.

[Extended Analysis: Effort Faculty]
The faculty of effort (brtson 'grus kyi dbang po) is the energy that engages in virtuous practice. It is the capacity to exert oneself toward liberation without becoming exhausted. View register: effort as dynamic faculty.

[Extended Analysis: Mindfulness Faculty]
The faculty of mindfulness (dran pa'i dbang po) is the capacity to hold the object of meditation without forgetting. It is the glue of practice—the factor that maintains continuity. View register: mindfulness as holding factor.

[Extended Analysis: Samadhi Faculty]
The faculty of samadhi (ting nge 'dzin gyi dbang po) is the capacity for one-pointed concentration. It is the stability that allows wisdom to arise. Without samadhi, wisdom is scattered. View register: concentration as stable basis.

[Extended Analysis: Wisdom Faculty]
The faculty of wisdom (shes rab kyi dbang po) is the capacity to discern reality as it is. It is the cutting faculty that distinguishes truth from falsehood, essence from appearance. View register: wisdom as discernment.

[Extended Analysis: Learning and Beyond Learning]
Those learning (slob pa) and those beyond learning (mi slob pa) each have the five wisdom faculties. Even arhats and Buddhas possess and employ these faculties, though in perfected form. View register: faculties at all stages.

[Extended Analysis: Gender Faculties as Conditioning]
The gender faculties condition the types of rebirth and certain physical and mental tendencies, but do not determine spiritual capacity. Both male and female can achieve enlightenment. View register: gender as conventional, not ultimate.

[Extended Analysis: Feeling Faculties and Experience]
The suffering and happiness faculties (sdug bsngal dang bde ba'i dbang po) are the capacity to experience the results of karma. They are not the experiences themselves but the equipment that experiences. View register: feeling as equipment.

[Extended Analysis: Mental Faculty as Sixth Sense]
The mental faculty (yid kyi dbang po) is the sixth sense—the capacity for mental consciousness to know objects. It coordinates the other senses and engages with mental objects. View register: mind as master sense.

[Extended Analysis: Faculty-Object-Consciousness Triad]
The complete process involves faculty (dbang po), object (yul), and consciousness (rnam shes). None can function without the others. This triad represents the minimum conditions for perception. View register: dependent origination of perception.

[Extended Analysis: Soteriological Purpose]
The classification serves soteriological purpose—not to explain physics but to understand the equipment of experience so it can be transformed. The faculties are the basis for both samsara and nirvana. View register: classification for liberation.

[Structural Synthesis: Complete Faculties Framework]
This section (1732-1901) presents the Abhidharma system of twenty-two faculties—sense faculties, life faculty, gender faculties, feeling faculties, mental faculty, and wisdom faculties. The architecture systematically classifies all capacities of sentient beings. The view throughout is that these faculties can be understood and developed toward enlightenment. The translator must preserve the technical terminology of Abhidharma while conveying that this is a traditional phenomenological system, not modern psychology. The faculties represent both the equipment of samsaric existence and the potential for liberation.
