Overall structural recognition: This extensive section presents the complete Abhidharma cosmology with precise measurements and locations. The recognition required is that this is traditional Buddhist cosmography, not modern geography—the numbers and descriptions serve contemplative purposes, not cartographic accuracy. The translator must preserve the precise numerical descriptions and proper names while maintaining understanding that this describes the phenomenal world as experienced, not as measured scientifically.
