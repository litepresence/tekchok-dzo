[17524-17883]
Detailed exposition of primordial wisdom nature. Opens with first aspect: great primordial clarity appearing as subtle wisdom basis. Five wisdom aspects: ratna, padma, vajra, pema, karma—standard five-wisdom scheme. Two modes: ordinary appearance-ground and primordial purity basis. Three aspects of compassion: appearing, arising, and radiating. Structural note: longest Chapter 14 section, covering multiple wisdom taxonomies. Context suggests connection to later sections on vajra-knowledge. Register: highest tantric technical precision. Preserve all five-wisdom Sanskrit loanwords with Tibetan equivalents.
