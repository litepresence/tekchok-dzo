[17524-17550]
The section on primordial wisdom nature begins with the first aspect: essence. Great primordial clarity abides within as the subtle wisdom basis of spontaneous presence. When confusion arises, its tones are placed in proper context, allowing understanding to emerge as proliferation-free singularity, accompanied by direct experience. This establishes the foundational framework for all subsequent exposition. Structural function: establish wisdom basis through essence recognition.

[17551-17580]
The Rang shar citation introduces two modes of abiding. The first mode involves abiding in the primordial ground itself. The second involves abiding in the objects of confusion. These two modes demonstrate the flexibility of the ground—its capacity to accommodate both recognition and delusion without losing its essential nature. The primordial essence nature remains unchanged regardless of which mode predominates. Compassion manifests in three aspects regardless of mode. Structural function: citation authority for ground flexibility.

[17581-17610]
The three aspects integrate comprehensively. Essence abides as the kaya, nature as speech, and compassion as mind. These three are not divided into separate categories; rather, they exist without division or distinction. From the natural descent of accomplishment, body color and other characteristics emerge as objects beyond ordinary mind. The nature appears as light, manifesting the five colors—white, red, yellow, green, and blue—each representing a distinct wisdom. Structural function: kaya integration without reification.

[17611-17640]
The five colors manifest without possessing marks. They are not mark-possessing phenomena in the conventional sense. Rather, they appear markless, accomplished through natural descent rather than fabrication. The characteristic indeterminacy of the ground allows it to appear as various phenomena—white for purity, red for passion transformation, yellow for richness, green for activity, blue for space—without losing its essential nature. This indeterminacy is why the ground is called various appearing. Structural function: color wisdom without fixation.

[17641-17670]
The ground accommodates both self-settled recognition and cog bzhag rang grol rgyas gdab—spontaneous liberation through resting. Whether confusion objects are present or not, the ground remains capable of revealing its nature. This flexibility is not a defect but the very characteristic that makes liberation possible. The ground does not require specific conditions to manifest its nature; it is always present, always available, always the basis of all experience. Structural function: ground as liberating potential.

[17671-17700]
A second Rang shar citation establishes Dharmakaya characteristics. The great wisdom scripture describes Dharmakaya as possessing three aspects: essence, nature, and compassion. These three form the complete characteristic of Dharmakaya, inseparable from the first citation's exposition. The consistency between citations reinforces the authority of the presentation. The three aspects are not sequential but simultaneous, not developmental but primordial. Structural function: dharmakaya definition through authoritative citation.

[17701-17730]
The location inquiry establishes where Dharmakaya abides. It exists in the heart center, the glorious be'u, the precious secret treasury. This location is not metaphorical but functional—the center of being from which all experience radiates. The heart center is the palace of Dharmakaya, unchanging and immutable. Within each being's own citta, it abides clearly, not as an external object but as the very nature of awareness itself. Structural function: location specification as recognition site.

[17731-17760]
Three essences converge at this location. Empty wisdom essence, clear light essence, and self-arisen rigpa essence—all three are present simultaneously. These three essences possessing Dharmakaya are not separate entities but aspects of a single reality. Wisdom meaning is understood without traversing any path; the understanding is immediate, direct, non-conceptual. This immediacy is characteristic of Dharmakaya recognition. Structural function: three essences as unified ground.

[17761-17790]
Dharmakaya is beyond expression, beyond extremes. It is expression-extreme-free, great Dharmakaya, abiding in all yet recognized by none. It is mindless and thoughtless, free from non-recognition and confusion. This description does not negate Dharmakaya but establishes its transcendence of all conceptual categories. What is beyond expression is not absent; it is simply not capturable by expression. What is unrecognized by ordinary mind is not unknown; it is directly known by wisdom. Structural function: beyond characteristics as positive attribute.

[17791-17820]
Terminology variations reflect the ground's flexibility. Sometimes it is tagged as ground-abiding wisdom, sometimes as Dharmakaya, sometimes as liberation-ground. These variations do not indicate different entities but different aspects of a single essence. From the perspective of reversal, the one essence is expressed differently. The inseparability of kaya and wisdom is the key insight—body and awareness are never separated, never divided, always unified. Structural function: terminological flexibility reflecting unity.

[17821-17850]
The second aspect—definitive terminology—marks the transition to technical definitions. The term Dharmakaya derives from the gathering of profound and vast dharma essences. This etymological explanation grounds the concept in its functional meaning rather than abstract metaphysics. The structural marker indicates precision in terminology, emphasizing the importance of exact understanding in this context. Structural function: definitional section transition.

[17851-17880]
The third aspect—division—introduces comprehensive classification. The ground of original purity exists both in itself and in the body. The supreme Dharmakaya free from adventitious stains is distinguished from the three kayas. When divided, these become nine through the three kayas and their subdivisions. This classification system is not arbitrary but reflects different modes of recognition and different levels of realization. Structural function: systematic taxonomy.

[17881-17910]
Rang shar citation on body classification: bodies are inconceivable yet gather into three categories. What are these three? Dharmakaya transcends the object of signs. Sambhogakaya transcends the object of grasping. Nirmanakaya transcends the object of attachment. Each kaya represents a different transcendence, a different freedom, a different mode of beyond. The three subdivisions of Dharmakaya—Dharmakaya's Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya's Sambhogakaya, Dharmakaya's Nirmanakaya—demonstrate the recursive nature of classification. Structural function: kaya subdivision.

[17911-17940]
Dharmakaya's Dharmakaya is awareness itself—dharma appears as object, body as awareness nature not ceasing. Dharmakaya's Sambhogakaya is the five lights. Dharmakaya's Nirmanakaya is seeing not ceasing in the eye's sense power. Each subdivision specifies a different dimension of Dharmakaya's manifestation, a different aspect of its appearance, a different mode of its presence. The object of Dharmakaya is completely pure sky. The abode of Dharmakaya is citta. The path of Dharmakaya is the jewel crystal duct. Structural function: dharmakaya specifications.

[17941-17970]
Sambhogakaya also has three subdivisions: Sambhogakaya's Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya's Sambhogakaya, and Sambhogakaya's Nirmanakaya. Sambhogakaya's Dharmakaya is the five wisdoms appearing not ceasing, lucidly abiding. Sambhogakaya's Sambhogakaya is the five bindu forms with their paths. Sambhogakaya's Nirmanakaya is awareness arising in the five sense doors' knowledge objects. The abode is avadhuti. The path is the right small tip. Each specification adds precision to the classification. Structural function: sambhogakaya specifications.

[17971-18000]
Nirmanakaya likewise has three subdivisions: Nirmanakaya's Dharmakaya, Nirmanakaya's Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya's Nirmanakaya. Nirmanakaya's Dharmakaya is the two lamps. Nirmanakaya's Sambhogakaya is seeing the five lights. Nirmanakaya's Nirmanakaya is individual self-awareness arising with the five afflictions. The abode is the brain. The path is the eye. The object is appearing as delusion. This completes the nine-fold classification, demonstrating the comprehensive coverage of the system. Structural function: nirmanakaya specifications.

[18001-18050]
Although Dharmakaya is not mind or affliction, its divisions include Sambhogakaya's Nirmanakaya and Nirmanakaya's Nirmanakaya—which might seem contradictory when called the five sense knowledges and afflictions. This is not contradictory. When consciousness and afflictions exist as self, awareness's self-expression exists—this is what is being referred to. Consciousness and afflictions themselves are not Nirmanakaya. The distinction is crucial: the expression is Nirmanakaya, not the affliction itself. Structural function: resolving apparent contradiction.

[18051-18100]
The fourth aspect—function—reveals practical application. The Dharmakaya of original purity nature serves as liberation-ground. The Dharmakaya of path-time natural clarity serves as liberation-doing action. These three kayas perform purifying and pure-basis actions. The functional dimension transforms abstract classification into practical soteriology. It is not enough to know the kayas; one must understand what they do, how they operate, what effects they produce. Structural function: practical functionality.

[18101-18150]
The fifth aspect—cause of word entry—explains why the term Dharmakaya is used. From the beginning, free from dust and stains, pure; existing in circumstances yet not known face-to-face, existing as secret dharma; final meaning, the aim to seek, the fruit that exists—these characteristics warrant the term Dharmakaya. The word is not arbitrary but reflects essential qualities: primordial purity, hidden presence, ultimate aim. Structural function: terminological justification.

[18151-18200]
The second topic—mind and wisdom distinction—divides into two parts: essence briefly shown, and individual nature extensively explained. The brief presentation establishes the fundamental distinction: mind is associated with root non-awareness, possessing stains, like clouds obscuring the sun of wisdom. Wisdom is associated with Dharmakaya, free from stains, not abiding with mind's recollection and thought, like the sun itself. This contrast is not evaluative but descriptive. Structural function: mind-wisdom distinction.

[18201-18250]
Mind is the basis of all latencies, the stain of embodied beings, grasping objects as its function—the dharmata of samsara. The citations from Jewel Garland establish this definitively. Wisdom, conversely, is separate from recollection-basis, free from the activity that characterizes mind. This distinction is crucial for understanding the entire system—without it, confusion between mind and wisdom leads to fundamental error. Structural function: establishing definitive distinction.

[18251-18300]
The Six Expanses citation reinforces the distinction: if mind and wisdom's own essence is not distinguished, it is like the sun obscured by clouds—unable to perform external appearance's function. Mind is the basis, source, accumulator, and all-arising of karma, afflictions, and latencies. It always abides in non-awareness's house, opposing and obscuring the sun of wisdom. This is not a moral failing but a structural characteristic. Structural function: structural opposition.

[18301-18350]
Rang shar citations on mind's nature: mind gathers all latencies, accumulates all afflictions, is the basis of all latencies. These latencies are difficult to cut, obscuring self-appearance, abiding equally with ignorance. The Jewel Garland citation reinforces: mind arises from gathered assemblies, is coated with defilement, becomes the number of defilements. This accumulation is what makes beings beings—awareness obstructed by mind. Structural function: mind as accumulative basis.

[18351-18400]
When mind accumulates karma, delusion becomes delusion—one delusion circling from one to another, performing samsara's actions. When mind is liberated from awareness—pure, exhausted, purified—it is called Buddha. Awareness is free from defilement. The object to be free from is the assembly of defilements, truly so. Mind alone is that object. When mind is free, Buddha is present. All embodied beings' defilements are exhausted. Migrating beings migrate through mind; without it, migration is impossible. Structural function: liberation through mind cessation.

[18401-18450]
Mind manifests through object-appearance—this and this—symbol, name, universal grasping, object-mind. These divide into two: grasping object-mind and grasping subject-mind investigating distinctions, analyzing minutely. Grasping object, grasping mind—thus it is explained. These need to be established from common texts. Mind's cessation is directly made by body. Clear words, mind and mental factors entering, continuous break—these establish the scriptural basis. Structural function: mind's operational mechanism.

[18451-18500]
Jewel Heap citation: free from mind, intellect, and consciousness; not abandoning concentration's abode—this is the Tathagata's heart secret, unfathomable. Wisdom, like space, elaboration-ceased, is the basis and source of Buddha's measureless dharmas, together with the ocean-assembly of wheel-wisdom, always abiding in Dharmakaya's home, burning all affliction-habit thickets like fire. Jewel Garland citation: conceptions all burned, wisdom itself consumes like fire, equals space itself, is empty-luminous awareness-possessing itself. Structural function: wisdom characteristics.

[18501-18550]
Some not-knowing here think: if mind does not exist, it becomes inanimate or darkness-like. This indicates limited learning. Even without mind, wisdom exists, so awareness does not cease. When non-awareness delusion mind ceases, wisdom's clear sun arises—like day rising when night dawns. The transition is natural, not forced; wisdom emerges when obscuration dissolves. Structural function: wisdom emergence.

[18551-18600]
Some think: since non-awareness pervades awareness, when mind ceases, awareness ceases. This is great error. Awareness pervades non-awareness outwardly, but non-awareness does not pervade awareness inwardly—like Buddha's wisdom. Non-awareness pervades mind, making mind suitable as pervader. Since it does not pervade awareness, non-awareness withdraws from awareness's expanse or its continuum breaks. Structural function: pervasion asymmetry.

[18601-18650]
Therefore, when mind ceases, basis non-awareness with its parts ceases, but awareness does not cease—the basis of cessation is awareness itself. If awareness also did not exist, what would be the basis for thinking about cessation? Here, when non-awareness mind with its parts ceases, awareness expands as wisdom—enjoying the two knowledges. Jewel Garland citation: mind is without all movement, not inanimate, knowing and aware, clear-making appearance. Structural function: awareness as cessation basis.

[18651-18700]
There, mind and wisdom are separate. Common body citation: mind and mind-itself, nature pure, distinguish two. On that, mind is all-conception, samsara's dharma. Mind-itself is free from elaboration, nirvana's dharma. Arya Prajnaparamita Eight Thousand citation: mind on mind does not exist; mind's nature is luminosity. Thus spoken. Mind on thus is basis-gathering—showing essence, nature. Structural function: textual authority for distinction.

[18701-18750]
Mind's elaboration-possessing thought, defilement-dharma, emanating and gathering, one-pointed higher-realms entering—all these have no nature. Mind's nature, mind's natural state, mind itself—these are name enumerations. That itself's character is luminous wisdom abiding—thus arises. Those who do not distinguish mind and mind-itself, fools who arrogantly think they know pitaka, are merely display-arrogance-possessing. Structural function: nature as luminous.

[18751-18800]
Thus, well separating mind and wisdom, common object-possessing vehicles make mind into ground, path, and fruit. Yet all these do not directly arrive at meaning. This vehicle enumerates wisdom as Buddha's ground, path, and fruit—quickly liberating from samsara. Others, hoping for enlightenment from samsara's root, even after long time find it difficult to obtain—because of error in ground-opening manner. Structural function: comparative vehicle analysis.

[18801-18850]
Kuntu-zangpo Heart Mirror citation: desiring Buddha from mind is error from me. Error manner is contradicted by both reasoning and scripture. Thus, if ground, path, and fruit are opened from mind, the opening-ground mind itself, possessing grasping-grasping, results in your ground, path, and fruit all possessing grasping-grasping. Desiring, Buddha is not accomplished; even if accomplished, it is reverse result—not liberated from grasping-grasping. Structural function: error identification.

[18851-18900]
Also, as mind gathers various habits and karma, ground, path, and fruit also result in that. Desiring, there is the flaw of resulting in delusion. Opponent says thus: if mind does not exist, Buddha is not reasonable; Buddha, distinguished as bya-sems, you also desire. Answer: not by mind not-existing and existing does Buddha become, but by Dharmakaya wisdom's existence and non-existence thus arises. Structural function: responding to objection.

[18901-18950]
By mind's delusion waking, Buddha is distinguished—true though this is, still ground spontaneous-presence Buddha is not certain by it, not true actual. By rigpa doing ground, path, and fruit, if rigpa itself becomes thing-mark, it does not become so—because empty, clear, and grasp-attachment are all non-existent. Structural function: rigpa beyond reification.

[18951-19000]
Again, from that same source: knowing awareness clear itself exists. Why, if clear exists, does it not become mark-possessing? Because clear makes beautiful. Ask-answer thus: does not become mark-possessing because attachment does not exist there. That also should be known thus: example, like sun mandala—clear yet not fallen into direction. Why? Because desire does not exist. Structural function: clarity without fixation.

[19001-19050]
Second, extensive explanation of each own-nature, two parts: extensive explanation of mind and wisdom's nature. First, from Thal 'gyur: mind and wisdom's essential point—mind thus called on delusion-conception, essence entering and pervading, recollection-thought various by basis not, distinction pure and impure, definition thought by recollection-object produce. Structural function: mind definition.

[19051-19100]
What on mind, what by mind, what mind, what reason mind—thus spoken. On this: essence, definition, distinction, each meaning from four. Essence enters delusion-conception, pervades all, not basis of recollection-thought, distinguishes pure and impure, produces recollection-objects through definition. These five characteristics define mind operationally. Structural function: five characteristics.

[19101-19150]
The extensive explanation completes the cognitive mapping of mind and wisdom distinction. Through detailed citation analysis, structural function documentation, and view register calibration, the section establishes definitive understanding necessary for translation. The calm, settled presentation avoids didactic intrusion while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Preservation of technical terminology ensures downstream rendering accuracy.
