Comprehensive extended analysis. The primordial wisdom nature section establishes the foundational understanding of Dharmakaya as the ground of all experience. The exposition begins with the essence—the great primordial clarity that abides within as the subtle wisdom basis of spontaneous presence. This wisdom is not created but naturally present, becoming apparent when confusion's tones are placed in their proper context. The Rang shar citation introduces two modes of abiding—in the primordial ground for the realized, in confusion objects for the deluded—demonstrating the flexibility of the ground itself. The three aspects of essence, nature, and compassion form the complete Dharmakaya, with essence abiding as the kaya, nature as speech, and compassion as mind. The five colors (white, red, yellow, green, blue) represent the five wisdoms, each appearing without possessing marks, accomplished through natural descent rather than fabrication. The characteristic indeterminacy of the ground allows it to appear as various phenomena without losing its essential nature. The three essences—empty wisdom, clear light, and self-arisen rigpa—are all present in the heart center's secret treasury, abiding clearly in each being's own mind. This wisdom is beyond expression, beyond extremes, and unrecognized by ordinary mind, yet fully present. The inseparability of kaya and wisdom is the key insight—that body and awareness are never separate, never divided. Through comprehensive coverage of all these elements, complete understanding is established.
