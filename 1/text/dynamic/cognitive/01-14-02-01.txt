[17524-17883]
Detailed exposition of primordial wisdom (ye shes) nature. Opens with first aspect: great primordial clarity (dang po ka dag chen po) appearing as subtle wisdom basis. Five wisdom aspects emerge: ratna (jewel), padma (lotus), vajra (thunderbolt), pema (lotus alternate), karma (action)—standard five-wisdom scheme. Then presents two modes: ordinary appearance-ground (glu dus) and primordial purity (gdod ma) basis. Three aspects of compassion (thugs rje): appearing, arising, and radiating. Structural note: this is one of the longest Chapter 14 sections, covering multiple wisdom taxonomies. Context suggests connection to later sections on vajra-knowledge (rdo rje ye shes). Register: highest tantric technical precision. Preserve all five-wisdom Sanskrit loanwords with Tibetan equivalents.
