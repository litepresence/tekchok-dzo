[5646-5910]
Physical posture and breath control for Dzogchen meditation. First: holding breath (absorbing): feet pressed, pressing vital points, gathering vital winds, generating inner heat (gtum mo), sitting in vajra posture, hands in meditation mudra, pressing subtle points—cutting karmic and afflictive traces. Second: resting awareness: when thoughts arise, reverse vital winds, body appearances manifest, mind rests inside. When feet pressed, life-force winds controlled; when hands pressed, subtle winds enter central channel; when body straight, awareness naturally settles. Three aspects: body points, wind points, mind points. Structural note: detailed physical techniques for channel and wind training. Register: Dzogchen tantric physical practice terminology.
