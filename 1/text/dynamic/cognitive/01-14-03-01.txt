First section establishing essence of mind-ground. Object-subject-grasper duality arises from ignorance pervading consciousness—the six types of mind: grasping mind, mind attending one-pointedly to grasper-holder, desire-loaded coarse conception, pure and impure mind. Pure mind-itself: emptiness of dharma-nature with self-awareness, beyond mental factors and marks. Citations from Uttaratantra and Precious Garland clarify: emptiness-compassion essence, three-times Buddha as mother. Impure mind arises from self-grasping; pure mind arises through path—uncorrupted samadhi and compassion mind-generation lead to liberation. Key distinction: ultimate meaning cannot be grasped through conceptual mind. Register is Dzogchen-sem side transitioning to rigpa. Risk: reifying six mind types as categories loses non-dual ground. Preservation: must maintain recognition sequence from grasping to self-awareness.

Second section examining five gates (ayatanas) as basis-appearance. The five gates: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body—each having object and consciousness. Eye consciousness arises from eye and form; similar pattern for all gates. The perceiver and perceived co-appearing as appearance-consciousness without inherent existence. This establishes epistemological structure for subsequent vajra-knowledge presentation. Gate analysis demonstrates dependent origination without substantial self. Register shifts to Abhidharma-style enumeration. Risk: reifying gates as independent existents loses dependent nature. Preservation: must maintain co-appearing syntax throughout.
