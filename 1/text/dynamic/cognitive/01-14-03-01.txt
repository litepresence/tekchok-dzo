[17884-18000]
First section establishing essence of mind-ground (sems kyi gzhi). Object-subject-grasper duality arises from ignorance pervading consciousness—this fundamental error creates the six types of mind: grasping mind ('dzin pa'i sems), mind attending one-pointedly to grasper-holder (gzung 'dzin nyid la rtse gcig tu yid la byed pa'i sems), desire-loaded coarse conception ('dod chags dang ldan pa'i rtog pa rags pa), pure and impure mind (dag pa dang ma dag pa'i sems). Pure mind-itself: emptiness of dharma-nature with self-awareness, beyond mental factors and marks. View register: the six minds are all conceptual; pure mind is non-conceptual recognition.

[Extended Analysis: Six Types of Mind]
The six types of mind (sems drug) represent the progressive refinement of conceptual consciousness—from gross grasping to subtle distinctions between pure and impure. All six operate within dualistic framework. Grasping mind: basic subject-object duality. Mind attending one-pointedly: concentrated focus on duality. Desire-loaded conception: emotional engagement with duality. Pure/impure mind: evaluative judgment of duality. View register: all six are obscurations to be transcended. Translation risk: "pure mind" suggesting the last is acceptable. Preservation: even the distinction between pure and impure is dualistic conceptual mind—the truly pure mind transcends this distinction.

[Extended Analysis: Object-Subject-Grasper Duality]
The fundamental duality is object (yul), subject (yul can), and grasper ('dzin pa)—the triad that constitutes samsaric experience. View register: this triad as the root of delusion, not reality. Translation risk: duality appearing as natural structure. Preservation: the triad arises from ignorance (ma rig pa)—it is not the natural state but the error to be corrected. When rigpa recognizes its own nature, the triad self-liberates into nondual display.

[Extended Analysis: Ignorance Pervading Consciousness]
Ignorance (ma rig pa) pervades all six types of mind—it is the fundamental misapprehension that creates the subject-object split. View register: ignorance as active mis-knowing, not mere absence. Translation risk: "ignorance" suggesting lack of education. Preservation: ma rig is "not knowing" in the sense of mis-knowing—taking what is not self to be self, what is impermanent to be permanent. It pervades consciousness like a dye coloring water.

[Extended Analysis: Pure Mind Itself]
The pure mind itself (dag pa'i sems nyid) is defined as "emptiness of dharma-nature with self-awareness" (chos nyid kyi stong pa rang rig pa). This transcends all six conceptual minds. View register: pure mind as rigpa, not improved consciousness. Translation risk: "pure mind" suggesting refined thinking. Preservation: dag pa'i sems nyid is rigpa—primordial knowing beyond conceptual elaboration. It is "pure" not because it has been purified but because it was never stained.

[Extended Analysis: Beyond Mental Factors and Marks]
The pure mind is "beyond mental factors and marks" (sems byung dang mtshan ma las 'das pa). Mental factors (sems byung) are the fifty-one auxiliary mind states in Abhidharma analysis. Marks (mtshan ma) are characteristics that distinguish phenomena. View register: pure mind transcending all Buddhist analytical categories. Translation risk: "beyond" suggesting rejection of Buddhism. Preservation: pure mind transcends even the sophisticated categories of Buddhist psychology—it is not a mind-state but the nature of mind itself.

[18001-18100]
Citations from Uttaratantra (rgyud bla ma) and Precious Garland (rin po che'i phreng ba) clarify: emptiness-compassion essence (stong pa nyid snying rje'i snying po), three-times Buddha as mother (dus gsum sangs rgyas ma). Impure mind arises from self-grasping (bdag 'dzin); pure mind arises through path—uncorrupted samadhi (zag med ting nge 'dzin) and compassion mind-generation (snying rje sems bskyed) lead to liberation. Ultimate meaning cannot be grasped through conceptual mind. View register: scriptural authority supporting the distinction between impure and pure mind.

[Extended Analysis: Uttaratantra Citation]
The Uttaratantra (rGyud gShes rGya mtsho) is a key text on Buddha-nature. The citation establishes emptiness-compassion as the essence—indivisible union. "Three-times Buddha as mother" indicates that all buddhas of past, present, and future arise from this emptiness-compassion essence. View register: all enlightenment arising from single ground. Translation risk: "mother" suggesting femininity or origin. Preservation: ma means mother as source—all buddhas are born from understanding emptiness-compassion. This is not gendered but indicates the ground of arising.

[Extended Analysis: Impure Mind Arises from Self-Grasping]
Impure mind arises from self-grasping (bdag 'dzin)—the fundamental error of taking a self where there is none. View register: self-grasping as root of all impurity. Translation risk: "impure" suggesting moral judgment. Preservation: ma dag means "not pure" in the sense of obscured—the mind is obscured by self-grasping, not morally stained. All suffering arises from this single error.

[Extended Analysis: Pure Mind Through Path]
Pure mind arises through path—specifically through uncorrupted samadhi (zag med ting nge 'dzin) and compassion mind-generation (snying rje sems bskyed). View register: path as purification of obscurations, not construction of purity. Translation risk: path appearing as necessary cause. Preservation: the path removes what obscures pure mind—it does not create purity. Zag med (uncorrupted) means free from afflictive obscurations; samadhi reveals what was always present.

[Extended Analysis: Compassion Mind-Generation]
Compassion mind-generation (snying rje sems bskyed) refers to bodhicitta—the altruistic intention to achieve enlightenment for all beings. View register: compassion as expression of pure mind, not separate quality. Translation risk: compassion appearing as emotion. Preservation: snying rje here is the natural responsiveness of pure mind to the suffering of beings—not sentimental pity but wisdom's dynamic expression.

[Extended Analysis: Ultimate Meaning Beyond Conceptual Mind]
The ultimate meaning (don dam pa) "cannot be grasped through conceptual mind" (rnam par rtog pa'i yid kyis gzung du med). View register: ultimate truth beyond concepts but not beyond experience. Translation risk: "cannot be grasped" suggesting incomprehensibility. Preservation: gzung du med means cannot be objectified or grasped as concept—it can be directly realized. The conceptual mind can point to it but cannot contain it.

[18101-18261]
Second section examining five gates (sgo lnga) as basis-appearance. Five gates: eye (mig), ear (rna ba), nose (sna), tongue (lce), body (lus)—each having object (yul) and consciousness (rnam shes). Eye consciousness arises from eye and form (gzugs); similar pattern for all gates. Perceiver and perceived co-appearing as appearance-consciousness without inherent existence. Establishes epistemological structure for subsequent vajra-knowledge presentation. Gate analysis demonstrates dependent origination without substantial self.

[Extended Analysis: Five Gates as Basis-Appearance]
The five gates (sgo lnga) are the five sense faculties that serve as the basis for appearance (snang gzhi). View register: gates as channels for manifestation, not barriers. Translation risk: "gates" suggesting separation. Preservation: sgo means door or gate—senses are openings through which experience enters, not walls that separate. They are the basis (gzhi) on which appearances manifest.

[Extended Analysis: Each Gate with Object and Consciousness]
Each gate has its object and consciousness: eye-gate with forms and eye-consciousness, ear-gate with sounds and ear-consciousness, etc. View register: dependent origination of perception. Translation risk: six consciousness system appearing as reification. Preservation: this is the standard Buddhist analysis—consciousness arises dependent on faculty and object, not as independent entity. No eye, no form, no eye-consciousness.

[Extended Analysis: Co-Appearing Structure]
The "co-appearing" (lhan cig snang ba) of perceiver and perceived indicates that subject and object arise together, not independently. View register: subject-object as inseparable pair, not separate realities. Translation risk: co-appearing suggesting two things appearing together. Preservation: lhan cig means "together" or "simultaneous"—perceiver and perceived are two aspects of single experience, not two independent things that meet.

[Extended Analysis: Appearance-Consciousness Without Inherent Existence]
The phrase "appearance-consciousness without inherent existence" (snang rnam rang bzhin med pa) applies emptiness analysis to perception. View register: perception as dependently arisen, not self-existing. Translation risk: "without inherent existence" suggesting nihilism. Preservation: rang bzhin med pa means lacking svabhava—independent, inherent nature. Perception certainly occurs, but not through independent entities. Like a dream: appearances and consciousness occur, but nothing inherently exists.

[Extended Analysis: Epistemological Structure for Vajra-Knowledge]
This five-gate analysis establishes the epistemological structure for subsequent vajra-knowledge presentation. View register: ordinary perception as basis for transcendent knowledge. Translation risk: ordinary perception devalued. Preservation: the same gates that create samsara when grasped become the channels of wisdom when recognized. The structure is the same; the recognition differs.

[Extended Analysis: Dependent Origination Without Substantial Self]
The gate analysis demonstrates dependent origination (rten 'brel) without substantial self (bdag med). View register: dependent origination as middle way between existence and non-existence. Translation risk: dependent origination appearing as causal mechanism. Preservation: rten 'brel here means dependent arising—gates, objects, and consciousness arise dependent on each other, not from self, not from other, not from both, not from neither. This is the Madhyamaka analysis applied to perception.

[Extended Analysis: Risk of Reifying Gates]
The note on risk: reifying gates as independent existents loses dependent nature. View register: analysis serving recognition, not creating new entities. Translation risk: sophisticated analysis becoming new dogma. Preservation: the gates are functional designations, not substantial entities. To grasp the analysis while missing the point—dependent origination—creates new attachments. The finger points at the moon; don't worship the finger.

[Extended Analysis: Preservation of Co-Appearing Syntax]
The emphasis on preserving co-appearing syntax indicates that translation must maintain the sense of simultaneous arising. View register: grammar expressing ontology. Translation risk: English syntax forcing sequential interpretation. Preservation: Tibetan grammar allows simultaneous presentation—subject, object, and consciousness as co-arising. English may require sequence, but the meaning must preserve simultaneity.

[Structural Synthesis: Mind-Ground and Five Gates Framework]
This section (17884-18261) presents the foundational framework for understanding mind and perception in Dzogchen. The architecture moves from the essence of mind-ground through the six types of conceptual mind to pure mind itself, then examines the five gates as the epistemological structure for experience. The view throughout is that pure mind (rigpa) transcends all conceptual elaboration, while the five gates demonstrate dependent origination without substantial self. The translator must preserve the distinction between conceptual and non-conceptual mind while conveying that the five gates—when recognized as dependently arisen—become the channels for vajra-knowledge. The ultimate meaning cannot be grasped conceptually but can be directly realized through the very gates that ordinarily create delusion.
