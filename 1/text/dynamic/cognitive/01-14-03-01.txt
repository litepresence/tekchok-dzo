First section establishing essence of mind-ground. Object-subject-grasper duality arises from ignorance pervading consciousness—six types of mind: grasping mind, mind attending one-pointedly to grasper-holder, desire-loaded coarse conception, pure and impure mind. Pure mind-itself: emptiness of dharma-nature with self-awareness, beyond mental factors and marks. Citations from Uttaratantra and Precious Garland clarify: emptiness-compassion essence, three-times Buddha as mother. Impure mind arises from self-grasping; pure mind arises through path—uncorrupted samadhi and compassion mind-generation lead to liberation. Ultimate meaning cannot be grasped through conceptual mind.

Second section examining five gates as basis-appearance. Five gates: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body—each having object and consciousness. Eye consciousness arises from eye and form; similar pattern for all gates. Perceiver and perceived co-appearing as appearance-consciousness without inherent existence. Establishes epistemological structure for subsequent vajra-knowledge presentation. Gate analysis demonstrates dependent origination without substantial self. Risk: reifying gates as independent existents loses dependent nature. Preservation: must maintain co-appearing syntax throughout.
