First position establishing essence-nature framework. Primordial purity (ka dag) as essence not established as thing or mark—awareness self-abiding within clarity-empty nature. Appearance emptiness and emptiness clarity are not two—awareness is form and wisdom, without separation, like sun's heart. Spontaneous presence (lhun grub) as nature recognized non-dually with essence. Three tantra citations from Rangshar, Klong drug pa, Mu tig phreng ba establish authoritative support. Register is highest Dzogchen view—primordial purity and spontaneous presence as co-emergent. Risk: temporalizing essence-nature as sequential phases loses non-dual import. Preservation: must maintain non-assertive syntax avoiding conceptual solidification.

Second position addressing disputes about recognition. Two parts: conceptual enumeration versus direct recognition of one's own face. The progression from philosophical formulation to immediate realization marks transition from sems to rigpa. This establishes the methodological structure for subsequent presentation.
