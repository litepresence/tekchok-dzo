Structural function: False Aspectarian Cittamātra position within Tenet Systems analysis. Four subsections: ultimate reality as wisdom of non-duality with qualities; stainless suchness with residual stains during remainder state; pure position—aspects and consciousness not merely false, spontaneous luminosity; transition to Madhyamaka. View register: Indian Buddhist philosophical tenet system analysis. Translation risk: technical terms (rnam rdzun, sems tsam) require precise rendering. Preservation: transition from Cittamātra to Madhyamaka must remain clear.

False Aspectarian Cittamātra holds ultimate reality as wisdom of non-duality with qualities, denying consciousness ultimately established. Both aspects and consciousness ultimately unreal—only Buddha's dharmakāya remains without remainder. Remainder (lhag bcas) vs remainderless (lhag med) states: residual stains mixed with wisdom during remainder; pure wisdom manifests through purification.

Section completes Cittamātra presentation, focusing on False Aspectarian subtype. Cittamātra as sophisticated phenomenological analysis of experience construction. Transition to Madhyamaka establishes progression toward emptiness teachings. Preserve philosophical precision while understanding these as stages leading toward Dzogchen view.
