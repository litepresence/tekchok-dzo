Structural function: False Aspectarian Cittamātra (rnam rdzun sems tsam) position presentation within Tenet Systems (siddhānta) analysis. Four subsections: (1) ultimate reality as wisdom of non-duality with qualities, consciousness not ultimately established, Buddha's dharmakāya without remainder; (2) stainless suchness as non-dual wisdom with residual stains during remainder state, mixed afflictions and wisdom, pure wisdom manifestation through purification; (3) pure position analysis—aspects and consciousness not merely false, habituation through attachment, spontaneous luminosity, reflection analogy applied to experience; (4) transition to Madhyamaka with Svātantrika and Prasaṅgika branches introduced. View register: Indian Buddhist philosophical tenet system analysis. Translation risk: Philosophical technical terms (rnam rdzun, sems tsam) require precise rendering to maintain doctrinal distinctions. Preservation: The transition from Cittamātra to Madhyamaka must remain clear.

Extended recognition of False Aspectarian Cittamātra as holding that ultimate reality is wisdom of non-duality with qualities, while denying that consciousness is ultimately established. Unlike True Aspectarians who hold that all aspects are false but consciousness is real, False Aspectarians hold that both aspects and consciousness are ultimately unreal—only the dharmakāya of the Buddha remains without remainder. The distinction between remainder (lhag bcas) and remainderless (lhag med) states is crucial: during the remainder state, there are residual stains mixed with wisdom; through purification, pure wisdom manifests.

Overall structural recognition: This section completes the Cittamātra presentation in the Tenet Systems analysis, specifically focusing on the False Aspectarian subtype. The recognition required is that Cittamātra is not merely "mind-only" idealism but a sophisticated phenomenological analysis of how experience is constructed. The transition to Madhyamaka at the end establishes the progression toward emptiness teachings. The translator must preserve the philosophical precision of the distinctions while maintaining the understanding that these are stages of analysis leading toward the Dzogchen view.
