Structural function: Highest tantric empowerment instruction presentation with detailed mixing practices. Mixing with mind establishes self-natured as mind-basis; mixing with body relies on yantra of body; mixing with speech involves three syllables; mind extends and gathers wind. Transferring with mirror and ring-thumb into student's mouth establishes absolute-relative inseparability. Mute's dream simile signals experience beyond conceptual expression. View register: completion-phase highest yoga tantra. Translation risk: Literal interpretation of physical substances could misread as external practice rather than inner transformation. Preservation: The non-dual syntax and symbolic nature must remain clear throughout.

Extended recognition of the mixing practices: the mirror represents the clear, reflective nature of mind; the ring-thumb gesture represents the union of skillful means and wisdom; transferring into the student's mouth symbolizes the transmission of realization. The mute's dream simile is crucial—just as a mute cannot describe the taste of sugar but knows it directly, the practitioner experiences the inseparability of absolute and relative beyond conceptual expression.

Second subsection: Dependent origination (rten 'brel) as key for not seeing mudrā as mere external form. The animal eyes enumeration—black dog right eye, black jackal left, owl right, bat left—functions as symbolic dependent-arising instruction representing different aspects of wisdom and means. Crow wing-tip wrapped in golden pill placed in mudrā's mouth while holding damaru creates unity of vajra-holder and wisdom—external ritual symbolizing internal union.

Extended recognition of timing and alternative paths: when empowerment time has not arrived, gift-giving and sending to one's own land marks transition to more exterior methods. The third empowerment's difficult points conclude with reference to great secret meaning—establishing that these practices are not mechanical rituals but direct pointing to the nature of mind. The recognition required is that all external forms are symbols for internal transformation.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents the culmination of the third empowerment instructions with detailed mixing practices and symbolic rituals. The recognition required is that these are not external, mechanical procedures but symbolic representations of internal processes—the union of mind, body, and speech with the natural state. The translator must preserve the symbolic resonance while avoiding both literal materialism and vague spiritualization.
