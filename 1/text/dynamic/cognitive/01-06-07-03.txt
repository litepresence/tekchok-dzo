Third section on mixing with mind transitioning to body-speech-mind synthesis. Mixing with mind establishes self-natured as mind-basis; mixing with body relies on yantra of body; mixing with speech involves three syllables; mind extends and gathers wind. The instruction on transferring with mirror and ring-thumb into student's mouth establishes absolute-relative inseparability. The mute's dream simile signals experience beyond conceptual expression. Register is highest tantric empowerment instruction. Risk: literal interpretation of physical substances could misread as external practice rather than inner transformation. Preservation: must maintain non-dual syntax throughout.

Sixteenth section on dependent origination key for not seeing mudrā. Enumeration of animal eyes—black dog right eye, black jackal left, owl right, bat left—functions as symbolic dependent-arising instruction. Crow wing-tip wrapped in golden pill placed in mudrā's mouth while holding damaru creates unity of vajra-holder and wisdom. Seventeenth section addresses timing of empowerment and alternative paths when empowerment time has not arrived. Gift-giving and sending to one's own land marks transition to more exterior methods. The third empowerment's difficult points conclude this section with reference to great secret meaning.
