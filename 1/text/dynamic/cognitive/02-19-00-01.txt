Ground-path-result integration with ten bhūmi analysis. Structural function: concludes Tögal presentation by integrating Dzogchen into broader Mahāyāna soteriology. View register: synthetic doctrinal exposition—reinterprets classical ten grounds through Dzogchen recognition stages. Translation: preserve gzhi-lam-'bras bu triad, sems nyid chos sku key formulation. Note: the correspondence between each bhūmi and Dzogchen realization (bden pa mthong ba through chos thams cad kyi sprin lta bur) provides interpretive framework often absent in literal translations. Translation risk: losing the integrative logic by treating bhūmis and Dzogchen stages as separate systems. Preservation: the distinction between those who maintain versus abandon retreat center (sbubs ma bor ba vs sbubs bor ba) reflects institutional dimension of practice.
