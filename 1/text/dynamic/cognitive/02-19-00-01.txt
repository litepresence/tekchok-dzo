[5963-5968]
Section header establishing copper-shining wisdom beyond exhausted dharmas and mind. This Tögal presentation occupies the second division of the Instruction Section. The structural function introduces through Dzogchen's characteristic poetic compression—zang thal rendered as copper-shining, direct, unmediated. The view register maintains Dzogchen-rigpa, a non-assertive presentation of what is already the case. Translation risk involves treating zang thal as merely metaphorical rather than pointing to direct perception beyond conceptual overlay. Preservation requires maintaining the formulaic pattern establishing the epistemic frame—this is recognition to be pointed at, not philosophy to be intellectually understood. The phrase "exhausted dharmas, beyond mind" establishes that ordinary cognition cannot grasp what is being indicated.

[5969-6017]
First subsection opens with structural enumeration: "First has three." The text progresses through systematic emptying—ye stong, yongs stong, then stong chen po variations. The view register employs iterative negation as pointer rather than nihilistic denial. Each negation (myong) accumulates what is not the case, building momentum toward non-conceptual recognition. Translation risk normalizes the repetitive structure into flowing English prose, losing the cumulative hammering effect essential to the method. Preservation requires maintaining the parallel construction across existence, truth, falsehood, delusion, freedom, samsara, nirvana, is, is-not, vision, emptiness—this complete inventory of possible positions, all dismissed, forms the architecture of liberation. The ten "vast" terms (gdal) require consistent rendering to maintain structural symmetry.

[6018-6060]
Transition to negation-of-attributes section shifts from myong to med, from experiential negation to ontological negation. Lines 5998-6007 present the "un-" series—unmoving, unabiding, untaking, ungoing, uncoming, unthinking, unconceptualizing, unobserving, unequaling, unchanging. The view register pushes apophatic theology to absolute limit. Translation risk involves the English "un-" prefix reading as simple negation rather than the transcendence implied by las 'das. Preservation maintains the temporal triad structure—before, now, end—appearing three times (delusion, freedom, transcendence), establishing this is not developmental narrative but recognition of what has always been so. The framework emphasizes timeless immediacy over progressive achievement.

[6061-6137]
Scriptural citation block from Ratnaketu Tantra shifts structure to authoritative quotation, marking transition from direct pointing to canonical support. The view register becomes synthetic—Dzogchen claims validated through tantric authority. Translation risk treats extensive citations as decorative rather than integral to the argument. Preservation recognizes the tantric verses provide doctrinal scaffolding—recognizing all dharmas as primordially empty, samsara and nirvana as not different, the five poisons as primordially self-arisen awareness. The sensory imagery (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body) follows standard sequence but demonstrates sense-contact is already wisdom-display. This integration of sensory experience into sacred view distinguishes Dzogchen from more abstract philosophical approaches.

[6138-6187]
Second citation block from Talgyur shifts register from Ratnaketu's detailed phenomenology to Talgyur's direct pointing. The key phrase—kun gzhi chos sku chen por rtogs—recognizing the universal ground as dharmakaya. The view register identifies ground-recognition as the pivot point. Translation risk conflates kun gzhi (universal ground) with kun gzhi rnam shes (universal-ground consciousness), a crucial distinction in Dzogchen. Preservation maintains that lines on "appearances of delusion" and "wisdom" being the same nature establish identity, not similarity. The text demonstrates that what appears as confusion to ordinary mind is actually pristine awareness when recognized. This recognition shifts perspective without changing the underlying nature.

[6188-6265]
Third citation block from Mutig Phrengba (Pearl Garland) presents the "reversal" (log) structure. Eighteen reversals catalog Dzogchen's inversion of standard Buddhist practice categories. The view register expresses radical non-duality through systematic negation of the path. Translation risk reads reversals as anti-nomian if not understood as pointing to primordial completion. Preservation maintains the structure—drima med pas, gzung 'dzin med pas, 'gyu ba med pas, etc.—each reversal has the same form: because X is the case, Y is reversed. This is not rejection but recognition of natural purity. The apparent contradictions resolve when understood as expressions of completion rather than opposition to method.

[6266-6306]
Fourth citation block continues the reversal theme with more explicit integration of the three kayas. Lines 6270-6274 present: snying po yin pas chos skur khyab, gsal bar snang bas longs skur rgyas, ma bu phrad pas sprul skur byung. The view register presents Dzogchen cosmology as recognition rather than construction. Translation risk renders the mother-son meeting metaphor too literally, missing its technical meaning. Preservation maintains that the three kaya presentation here is not causal-generation stage but natural display—this distinction must hold in any downstream translation. The three kayas emerge spontaneously from recognition rather than being constructed through practice.

[6307-6338]
Fifth citation block from Sutra sources—Dharma Cloud Sutra, Samadhiraja Sutra, Ratnaketu again. The structural function demonstrates Dzogchen claims have sutric support, not just tantric. The view register bridges sutra and tantra through Dzogchen view. Translation risk emphasizes emptiness and signlessness in ways that seem redundant with earlier material. Preservation maintains the progression—Sutra citation, then tantric, then Dzogchen-specific—establishing textual authority hierarchy. The Samadhiraja quote on primordial buddhahood is particularly crucial, establishing that awakening is not achieved but recognized. This sutric foundation prevents Dzogchen from being dismissed as solely tantric innovation.

[6339-6374]
Transition to second major section: "Cutting connection to great root-free emptiness." Structural shift moves from general explanation to specific analysis of bind-free self-mind. The three-part analysis framework appears: examining arising-place, abiding-place, and going-place. The view register applies analytical meditation to Dzogchen view—this is vipasyana supporting rigpa. Translation risk treats this as standard Madhyamaka analysis rather than Dzogchen-specific recognition. Preservation maintains the key phrase sems dang po skye ba med par ye nas 'dug pa—the mind is primordially unborn—must not be normalized into generic emptiness language. The analysis serves recognition rather than establishing philosophical positions.

[6375-6412]
Conclusion of three-part analysis demonstrates external appearances, internal mind, and their relationship are all without basis. The structural function shows that external appearances, internal mind, and their connection are all groundless. The view register culminates analysis into non-dual recognition. Translation risk involves the phrase snang sems 'brel med zang thal chen por mthong ba—seeing appearances and mind as unconnected, vast copper-shining—contains technical terms requiring preservation. The citation from Arya Ratnaketu Sutra provides canonical seal. The final integration—external appearances without object, internal mind without subject, appearances and mind without connection—completes the analysis and opens into direct recognition.

[6413-6430]
Causal analysis opens with one and many applied to mind. The trilemma structure examines: no cause, has cause, both. If cause exists, compounded things disintegrate—merit and demerit without inherent existence. The structural recognition employs Madhyamaka deconstructive methodology establishing groundlessness. The view register maintains analytical precision without assertive conclusion. Gcig and tha dad distinctions require careful preservation. The absurdity consequences—universal death from individual death—must retain their logical force in translation. These arguments demonstrate the impossibility of mind having a cause while maintaining the appearances that seem to require one.

[6431-6450]
Condition analysis continues. No reversal possible without conditions. Immeasurable aggregates could not arise. Manifold mind prevents self-other conceptions. The structural recognition extends groundlessness through consequence-cascade. The view register sustains analytical pressure. Rgyu, rkyen, ldog pa technical terminology requires consistency with earlier causal framework. The analysis undermines the apparent stability of conventional existence while not denying the appearance itself. This delicate balance distinguishes Dzogchen from nihilism.

[6451-6470]
Dream analogy shifts approach. Adventitious thoughts compared to dream-jewel joy—waking reveals nothing at all. The structural recognition employs phenomenological pointing replacing logical analysis. The view register becomes illustrative rather than argumentative. Glo bur force must survive translation. Cloud-sky analogy reinforces insubstantiality without establishing new ontology. These analogies shift from analytical deconstruction to direct recognition of the nature of appearances. The dream example demonstrates that what seems substantial in one state reveals its emptiness in another, yet neither state is ultimately privileged.

[6471-6495]
Movement analysis extends groundlessness to apparent activity. Motion impossibility through moment-direction-time analysis. Prior movement meeting present movement produces absurd consequences. The structural recognition extends groundlessness to apparent activity. The view register applies rigorous analytical standards. Gyu ba analysis requires familiarity with standard motion-refutation patterns. This classical Buddhist analysis of motion demonstrates that change cannot be located in moments, directions, or their combination. The unfindability of motion under analysis points to its dependently arisen nature.

[6496-6520]
Rootless realization transitions from analysis to recognition. Space-like mind without birth or ground. Four recognitions framework emerges. The structural recognition shifts from analysis to recognition proper. The view register points to direct experience. Risk involves over-philosophizing experiential language into new conceptual framework. The space metaphor conveys openness without boundaries, not mere emptiness. This transition marks the shift from intellectual understanding to direct recognition.

[6521-6545]
Mind-house destruction imagery illustrates self-awakened nonexistence. Iron-iron, magician-city analogies demonstrate self-liberation. The structural recognition employs familiar examples. The view register maintains Dzogchen self-recognition without self-help instruction. Rang grol, rang sangs terminology must preserve spontaneous flavor—not achievement language. These analogies show liberation occurring through recognition rather than effort. The mind-house was never truly built, so its destruction is not an accomplishment but a recognition of what has always been the case.

[6546-6570]
Dissolution clarification prevents nihilistic misinterpretation. Not existent becoming nonexistent. Convention language acknowledged. Three results framework established. The structural recognition prevents groundlessness from being interpreted as annihilation. The view register makes careful distinction without hedging. Yal ba as non-thing rather than thing destroyed. This clarification is crucial—Dzogchen does not destroy something that existed but recognizes that what appeared to exist never did. The three results describe the practical outcomes of this recognition.

[6571-6595]
Union redefined: not two becoming one but nonexistence without partiality. Other instructions contrast. The structural recognition distinguishes Dzogchen union from conventional yuganaddha. The view register maintains supreme vehicle primacy without hierarchy. Zung jug terminology shift requires noting for consistency. The Dzogchen view transcends both existence and nonexistence, one and many, without landing in any position. This is not a dialectical synthesis but recognition beyond the framework of the question.

[6596-6620]
Appearance as mind-mirror transition introduces six collections as great equality, pervasive. External appearances, internal thoughts, sense faculties—all clear nonexistence. The structural recognition provides phenomenological description of realization. The view register enters thod rgal descriptive mode. Dag snang terminology must remain pure vision rather than pure appearance. This shift marks the transition from analysis of mind to description of how appearances manifest in realization.

[6621-6645]
Designation freedom demonstrated: existent, nonexistent, appearing, empty—all acceptable from appearance side, empty from start. The structural recognition demonstrates extreme transcendence. The view register achieves non-assertive completion. Chug particles require recognition of permissive voice—let be rather than command. This freedom from the need to determine what things "really are" characterizes the realized view. All designations are allowed without any being ultimately binding.

[6646-6670]
Self-arising great appearance established. Samsara-nirvana dharmas as awareness's self-display. Four elements in space, dream in sleep analogies. The structural recognition establishes spontaneous presence. The view register enters lhundrup register. Rang shar, rang snang must remain self-referential—not caused by other. This is not creation by a cause but manifestation without cause. The self-arising nature means appearing without dependence on anything external to awareness itself.

[6671-6695]
Scriptural citation cluster from Klong drug pa, Nor bu phra bkod, Mu tig phreng ba, Rin chen spungs pa. The structural recognition grounds through multiple authoritative sources. The view register employs scriptural validation. Tantric citation tone must be preserved—not academic reference. These citations serve as confirmation rather than proof, pointing to the same recognition expressed in authoritative verse.

[6696-6720]
Common vehicle reference from Ting nge dzin rgyal po employs cloud-echo, rock-cave echo analogies. The structural recognition demonstrates universality of pointing. The view register is inclusive, not exclusive. Thun mong acknowledgment requires careful handling—not condescension. These analogies show that the principles appear in common vehicle teachings, though perhaps not with the same directness. The universality suggests that Dzogchen is not a separate tradition but the essence of all approaches.

[6721-6895]
Second topic implementation: Chos zad blo das—dharma exhausted beyond mind. Rig pa zang thal rjen pa recognition. Three subdivisions structure. First subdivision: rang babs kyis rig pa rang gsal. Outer not emanating, inner not gathering, middle not thinking. Self-clear as dharmakaya. Three postures: rang gnas cog bzhag, thog babs chen po, snang ba rgyas debs. Four cog bzhag: mountain, ocean, rig pa, snang ba metaphors. Threefold exhaustion: lta sgom yul das, ting dzin rang babs, dgongs pa blo das. The structural recognition unfolds exhaustion categories. The view register emphasizes exhaustion of phenomena. Poetic citations from Seng ge rtsal rdzogs, Klong drugpa. Ka dag dri med, sgyu ma, byung ba sangs pa imagery. The structural recognition employs authoritative ornamentation. The view register offers self-arisen wisdom praise. These sections repeat with variations to demonstrate different entry points to the same recognition.

[6896-8082]
Third topic and extensive repetition: Yul snang bloi me long. Six collections as great equality, pervasive. External appearances, internal thoughts, six faculties—all clear nonexistence. Extreme transcendence reasserted. Yin du chug, min du chug particles. Designation freedom from emptiness side. Self-arising great appearance. Eight comparisons: four elements, dream, cloud, etc. Multiple scriptural citations. Thun mong vehicle references. The structural recognition demonstrates comprehensive authoritative grounding. The view register achieves self-validating recognition. Chos zad blo das reprise. Rig pa zang thal. Three subdivisions. Rang babs implementation. Outer, inner, middle. Self-clear dharmakaya. Sixteen dharmas summary. Mind-house destruction analogies. Yal ba clarification. Three results through four recognitions. Other instructions contrast. Yod med vs ye med frameworks. Zung jug redefinition. Supreme essential point. Section conclusion marks completion of mind-is-nonexistent presentation, establishing the foundation for all subsequent Tögal instructions through systematic exhaustion of conceptual elaboration. The extensive repetition serves as meditative support, each cycle reinforcing recognition from different angles.
