[5963-5968]
Section header establishing the scope: copper-shining wisdom beyond exhausted dharmas and mind. This is Tögal presentation, the second division of the Instruction Section. Structural function: introductory framing naming the topic through characteristic Dzogchen poetic compression—zang thal as copper-shining, direct, unmediated. View register: Dzogchen-rigpa, non-assertive presentation of what is already the case. Translation risk: treating zang thal as merely metaphorical rather than pointing to direct perception. Preservation: the formulaic pattern "exhausted dharmas, beyond mind" establishes the epistemic frame—this is not philosophy to be understood but recognition to be pointed at.

[5969-6017]
First subsection opening with structural enumeration: "First has three." The text moves through progressive emptying—ye stong, yongs stong, then stong chen po variations. View register: iterative negation as pointer, not nihilism. Each negation (myong) adds to the pile of what is not the case, building momentum toward non-conceptual recognition. Translation risk: normalizing the repetitive structure into English prose flow, losing the cumulative hammering effect. Preservation: the parallel construction across existence, truth, falsehood, delusion, freedom, samsara, nirvana, is, is-not, vision, emptiness—this is a complete inventory of possible positions, all dismissed. The ten "vast" terms (gdal) require consistent rendering to maintain the architectural symmetry.

[6018-6060]
Transition to the negation-of-attributes section. The structure shifts from myong to med, from experiential negation to ontological negation. Lines 5998-6007 present the "un-" series—unmoving, unabiding, untaking, ungoing, uncoming, unthinking, unconceptualizing, unobserving, unequaling, unchanging. View register: apophatic theology pushed to absolute limit. Translation risk: the English "un-" prefix may read as simple negation rather than the transcendence implied by las 'das. Preservation: the temporal triad structure—before, now, end—appears three times (delusion, freedom, transcendence), establishing that this is not a developmental narrative but recognition of what has always been so.

[6061-6137]
Scriptural citation block from Ratnaketu Tantra. The structure shifts to authoritative quotation, marking the transition from direct pointing to canonical support. View register: synthetic—Dzogchen claims validated through tantric authority. Translation risk: the citations are extensive; treating them as decorative rather than integral to the argument. Preservation: the tantric verses provide the doctrinal scaffolding—recognizing that all dharmas are primordially empty, that samsara and nirvana are not different, that the five poisons are primordially self-arisen awareness. The sensory imagery (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body) follows the standard sequence but here used to demonstrate that sense-contact is already wisdom-display.

[6138-6187]
Second citation block from Talgyur, shifting register from Ratnaketu's detailed phenomenology to Talgyur's direct pointing. The key phrase: kun gzhi chos sku chen por rtogs—recognizing the universal ground as dharmakaya. View register: ground-recognition as the pivot point. Translation risk: conflating kun gzhi (universal ground) with kun gzhi rnam shes (universal-ground consciousness), a crucial distinction in Dzogchen. Preservation: the lines on "appearances of delusion" and "wisdom" being the same nature—the text is establishing identity, not similarity.

[6188-6265]
Third citation block from Mutig Phrengba (Pearl Garland), presenting the "reversal" (log) structure. Eighteen reversals cataloging how Dzogchen inverts standard Buddhist practice categories. View register: radical non-duality expressed through systematic negation of the path. Translation risk: the reversals can read as anti-nomian if not understood as pointing to primordial completion. Preservation: the structure—drima med pas, gzung 'dzin med pas, 'gyu ba med pas, etc.—each reversal has the same form: because X is the case, Y is reversed. This is not rejection but recognition of natural purity.

[6266-6306]
Fourth citation block continuing the reversal theme but with more explicit integration of the three kayas. Lines 6270-6274: snying po yin pas chos skur khyab, gsal bar snang bas longs skur rgyas, ma bu phrad pas sprul skur byung. View register: Dzogchen cosmology as recognition rather than construction. Translation risk: the mother-son meeting metaphor may be rendered too literally. Preservation: the three kaya presentation here is not causal-generation stage but natural display—this distinction must hold in any downstream translation.

[6307-6338]
Fifth citation block from Sutra sources—Dharma Cloud Sutra, Samadhiraja Sutra, Ratnaketu again. The structural function: demonstrating that Dzogchen claims have sutric support, not just tantric. View register: synthetic, bridging sutra and tantra through Dzogchen view. Translation risk: the sutra passages emphasize emptiness and signlessness in ways that might seem redundant with earlier material. Preservation: the progression—Sutra citation, then tantric, then Dzogchen-specific—establishes textual authority hierarchy. The Samadhiraja quote on primordial buddhahood is particularly crucial.

[6339-6374]
Transition to the second major section: "Cutting connection to great root-free emptiness." Structural shift from general explanation to specific analysis of bind-free self-mind. The three-part analysis framework appears: examining arising-place, abiding-place, and going-place. View register: analytical meditation applied to Dzogchen view—this is vipasyana as support for rigpa. Translation risk: treating this as standard Madhyamaka analysis rather than Dzogchen-specific. Preservation: the key phrase sems dang po skye ba med par ye nas 'dug pa—the mind is primordially unborn—must not be normalized into generic emptiness language.

[6375-6412]
Conclusion of the three-part analysis. The structural function: demonstrating that external appearances, internal mind, and their relationship are all without basis. View register: culmination of analysis into non-dual recognition. Translation risk: the phrase snang sems 'brel med zang thal chen por mthong ba—seeing appearances and mind as unconnected, vast copper-shining—contains technical terms that must be preserved. The citation from Arya Ratnaketu Sutra provides canonical seal. Preservation: the final integration—external appearances are without object, internal mind is without subject, appearances and mind are without connection—this triad completes the analysis and opens into direct recognition.
