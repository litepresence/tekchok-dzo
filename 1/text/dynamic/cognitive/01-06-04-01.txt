Structural function: completion of four empowerments' action sequence, transitioning from general empowerment framework to specific wisdom-prajñā empowerment detailed exposition. Frame establishes lineage continuity: Vimala to Lhetsün hand lineage, Guru Jobér treasure lineage interruption acknowledged, guru's clarification on blessing bestowal permissibility. View register: Anuttara-yoga tantra—completion stage practices within empowerment context. Translation risks: lineage terminology precision, distinction between hand lineage (phyag len) and treasure (gter) lineages. Preservation requirement: lineage markers remain distinct, empowerment sequence clarity maintained.

[8153-8171]
Structural function: wisdom-prajñā empowerment classification introduction, seventeen-point analytical framework for mudrā/consort examination. Sequential enumeration: seeking-examining, attracting, channel marks examination, bodhicitta expansion, dhāraṇī training, mantra-path holding, bliss generation method instruction, special seat method, conventional bindu descent, body posture, wind key holding, bindu refinement, bliss sequence application, view application, change calculation, ultimate bodhicitta application, special empowerment certainty, bliss object separation measure, continuous practice guideline, post-empowerment conduct. View register: Anuttara-yoga technical classification system. Translation risks: seventeenfold structure must remain numerically precise, technical terms (rtsa, rlung, thig le) must maintain technical specificity without reduction to generic equivalents. Preservation requirement: sequential integrity of seventeen points, technical terminology consistency with broader Nyingma lexical conventions.

[8172-8218]
Structural function: first examination category—consort type (rigs) classification through caste-Buddha family correspondence system. Five-fold typology: royal-Tathāgata, minister-vajra, commoner-jewel, brahmin-lotus, outcaste-karma. Necessity principle: each type requires corresponding consort type for accomplishment. Inner type classification: yakṣa, god, nāga, Brahma, Indra daughters as five karma family types. Secret type classification: four channel types—conch, elephant-nose, lotus, deer, cow—each with anatomical markers and functional characteristics. View register: Traditional Indian-Buddhist classification systems applied to tantric context. Translation risks: caste terminology carries historical baggage, anatomical classifications require precise technical rendering without clinical reduction or euphemism. Preservation requirement: five-fold structure integrity, anatomical marker specificity, functional correspondence clarity.

[8219-8273]
Structural function: continuation of type classification with etymological analysis of mudrā/mā terminology. Division scheme: outer five, inner five, secret five, completely perfect two, totaling seventeen examination points. Etymological analysis: rig pa-awareness, ma-world/mother, dhāraṇī-mind holding, mudrā-grasping. Second examination category: shape (dbyibs) examination—waist thin, body curved, limbs thin, nails lustrous, body straight, body short as bliss signs. Third examination category: color (kha dog) examination—blue-green optimal, excesses to be avoided. Fourth examination category: conduct (spyo lam) examination—slow movement, goose walk, pleasant speech, gentle demeanor. View register: Traditional Indian aesthetic-cum-physiognomic classification applied to tantric context. Translation risks: physiognomic terminology must remain technical rather than aestheticized, conduct descriptions must preserve traditional Indian behavioral norms without modernization. Preservation requirement: four examination categories remain distinct, etymological analysis preserved.

[8274-8421]
Structural function: detailed marks examination (mtshan nyid) expanding type classification into extensive physiognomic system. Four primary types: lotus, conch, striped, harti—each with specific anatomical markers, coloration, voice characteristics, age parameters. Marks examination framework: features, color, walk, voice as fourfold analysis. Additional classifications: supreme consort types (ḍākiṇī characteristics), age definiteness, examination priorities. Second examination sequence: attracting instruction with mantra formulation. Third examination: channel marks examination—nose length classification (long, short, medium) with functional correlations. Fourth: bodhicitta expansion methods—five root methods with specific substance preparations. View register: Detailed technical physiology within tantric medical-energetic framework. Translation risks: anatomical specificity required without clinical reduction, substance terminology must maintain traditional pharmacological references, age parameters must remain explicit. Preservation requirement: four-type system integrity, anatomical marker precision, method sequence clarity.

[8422-8507]
Structural function: continuation of seventeen-point sequence with dhāraṇī training, bliss generation methods, special key techniques, conventional bindu descent practices. Fifth: dhāraṇī training sequence—karma cause-effect explanation, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa demonstration, samaya commitment. Sixth: bliss generation method—warming, bathing, scent application, touch techniques. Seventh: special method key channels—arousal techniques through specific bodily locations, holding key methods with substance applications, deity visualization integration, Hevajra reference. Eighth: conventional bindu body key descent—six body key positions, posture instructions, bliss expansion techniques, three bodies obtainment methods. View register: Anuttara-yoga completion stage subtle body practices. Translation risks: subtle body terminology must maintain technical precision, bodily location terms must be anatomically accurate without over-specification, substance names require traditional pharmacological precision. Preservation requirement: sequential methodology integrity, bodily location specificity, technical term consistency.

[8508-8593]
Structural function: continuation with advanced techniques—bindu holding, mudrā application, three syllable generation practices, seal classifications. Bindu vase holding techniques: body key positions for trikāya correlation. Three syllable generation: oṃ (body), āḥ (speech), hūṃ (mind) with vajra generation framework. Three mudrā classification: action mudrā, samaya mudrā, dharma mudrā with corresponding bliss experiences. Mother syllable generation: e (body), hṛīḥ (speech), ha (mind) with seal correlations. Advanced techniques: phaṭ blocking, wind release methods, channel expansion practices, bliss-clarity-emptiness experience sequence. View register: Highest yoga tantra completion stage subtle energy practices with seed syllable (bīja) framework. Translation risks: syllable transliteration must follow IAST conventions, seal classifications must remain technically distinct, energy terminology (rlung/sems) must maintain precision. Preservation requirement: bīja syllable transliteration accuracy, three-mudrā distinction, energy-movement terminology consistency.

[8594-8673]
Structural function: conclusion of wisdom-prajñā empowerment section with summary verses and transition to next topic. Summary: five pristine cognition representing awareness wisdom, colored-powder mandala entry, four empowerments with four indications. Lineage affirmation: Vimala-Lhetsün hand lineage continues, Guru Jobér treasure lineage interruption noted, guru's permission for blessing bestowal clarified. Closing frame: action sequence of four empowerments complete. View register: Traditional tantric closing with lineage validation. Translation risks: lineage names must maintain proper noun status, blessing/empowerment distinction must remain clear. Preservation requirement: lineage continuity markers, empowerment completion framing.
