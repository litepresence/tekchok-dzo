[Comprehensive Empowerment Framework Synthesis]
Structural function establishes complete initiatory system integrating fourfold empowerment, mudrā classification, and consort typology. The progression moves from entering mandala through empowerment bestowal to Prajñā-Jñāna empowerment with detailed practical instruction. Family classification by caste, non-human beings, and physical characteristics provides systematic typology. All elements serve single purpose: direct recognition of wisdom through appropriate means.

View register operates within Tantra / Empowerment / Wisdom Recognition framework. The four empowerments progressively introduce practitioner to capacities already present. Vase empowerment introduces form body. Secret empowerment introduces speech dimension. Prajñā-Jñāna empowerment introduces mind nature. Word of Dzogchen Complete empowerment introduces complete recognition. Not external power conferred but internal capacity revealed.

Translation risks include interpreting empowerment as authority transfer rather than pointing-out. Term "dbang" must convey introduction to inherent capacity, not conferral of external power. Mudrā classifications must be preserved as symbolic consort practice supporting wisdom recognition, not literalized or dismissed. Family classifications serve functional purposes—different configurations optimally support different practitioners.

Preservation priorities center on maintaining initiatory framework as wisdom recognition system. Seventeenfold mudrā classification provides detailed practical instruction for consort yoga. Five family correspondences demonstrate how practice realizes five wisdoms. Physical characteristic classifications indicate energetic configurations affecting practice approach.
