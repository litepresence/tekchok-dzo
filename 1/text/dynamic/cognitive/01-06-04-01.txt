[8138-8152]
Condensed elaboration meaning. Teacher and student entering the colored-powder mandala representing the Five Jñānas of Rigpa. Four empowerments bestowed: Vase empowerment (bum pa), Secret empowerment (gsang ba), Prajñā-Jñāna empowerment (shes rab ye shes), and Word of Dzogchen Complete empowerment (tshig dbang rdzogs pa chen po), with four symbolic indications (brda bzhi), making festival (dga' ston) until completion. This is the actual transmission sequence from Vimalamitra to Lhetsün, still practiced today as hand lineage (phyag len). The other two lineages from Guru Jobér are interrupted (chad pa). Before that, only symbolic indication (brda) existed without hand lineage. Treasure teachings (gter nas byon) are difficult to establish as hand-blessing (phyag bzhes). Meaning elaboration (don spros) is sufficient for practice. Even if one requests hand lineage, the empowerment root exists without difficulty. If established, no contradiction. Thus spoke the Guru.

[Extended Analysis: Four Empowerments Structure]
Lines 8138-8152 present the four empowerments (dbang bzhi) in their condensed form. The structural function: establishing the complete initiatory framework for entering the mandala. View register: empowerments as progressive introduction to nature of mind. Translation risk: "empowerment" suggesting authority-transfer rather than pointing-out. Preservation: dbang indicates introduction to capacities already present, not conferral of external power. The fourfold structure—vase, secret, prajñā-jñāna, word—represents progressive subtlety from outer to inner.

[Extended Analysis: Vimalamitra Transmission Lineage]
The reference to "Vimalamitra to Lhetsün direct transmission" (bi ma las lce btsun la dngos su bskur ba'i rim pa) establishes the Indian-Tibetan transmission lineage. Vimalamitra (bi ma la mi tra), one of the three main Dzogchen masters who transmitted to Tibet, represents the direct lineage from Garab Dorje. Lhetsün (lce btsun) refers to the Tibetan recipient of this specific transmission. View register: unbroken lineage as guarantee of authentic transmission. Translation risk: lineage appearing as institutional authority rather than recognition continuity. Preservation: the transmission is "direct" (dngos su)—immediate pointing-out, not gradual instruction.

[Extended Analysis: Guru Jobér Lineage Interruption]
The mention of "other Guru Jobér lineages interrupted" (gnyis gu ru jo 'ber nas chad pa) indicates that while Vimalamitra's lineage continued, Jobér's lineages did not. Jobér was another early Dzogchen master in Tibet. View register: not all lineages survive; continuity depends on conditions. Translation risk: value judgment on interrupted lineages. Preservation: chad pa simply indicates discontinuity, not deficiency. The statement that "only symbolic indication preceded" (de'i gong nas brda tsam las) suggests that before formal empowerment, direct pointing-out (brda) was sufficient.

[Extended Analysis: Treasure Teaching Distinction]
The distinction that treasure teachings (gter ma) are "difficult to establish as hand-blessing" (phyag bzhes su 'deb dka') relates to terma revelation dynamics. Terma teachings are discovered rather than transmitted through conventional lineage. View register: multiple valid modes of transmission, not only institutional. Translation risk: privileging institutional over revealed teachings or vice versa. Preservation: both are valid—the hand lineage (phyag len) provides continuity, terma provides freshness. "Hand-blessing" indicates physical transmission ritual, which terma revelations may not follow exactly.

[8153-8171]
Third, the inner meaning of difficult-to-realize Prajñā-Jñāna empowerment. Mudrā classification in seventeen aspects: examining the knowledge-woman (rig ma brtag), how to attract her (de ji ltar dgug), examining channel characteristics (rtsa'i mtshan nyid brtag), expanding bodhicitta (byang chub kyi sems rgyas par bya), training in dhāraṇī (gzungs ma la bslab), holding mantra-path (sngags kyi lam du nges par gzung), method of generating bliss (bde ba bskyed pa'i thabs), seeking channels through special seat (sbyor ba khyad par can gyi gdan gyis rtsa btsal), descending conventional bindu (kun rdzob kyi thig le), relying on body key (lus kyi gnad), body posture (lus kyi 'dug stangs), holding wind key (rlung gi gnad kyis gzung), how to refine bindu (thig le ji ltar sbyang), applying Great Bliss mudrā (bde chen gyi phyag rgya), certain sequence of bliss generation (bde ba skye ba'i go rims), applying view (lta ba dang syar), calculating change ('gyur ba rtsi), placing bindu at channel object (thig le rtsa'i dmigs su dgram), expanding body strength with wind (rlung dang bsres pas lus kyi stobs rgyas), applying ultimate bodhicitta (don dam pa byang chub kyi sems).

[Extended Analysis: Seventeenfold Mudrā Classification]
Lines 8153-8171 present the seventeenfold classification of mudrā practices in Prajñā-Jñāna empowerment. The structural function: detailed practical instruction for consort yoga. View register: these practices as direct supports for recognizing the indivisibility of bliss and emptiness. Translation risk: literalizing the sexual symbolism or dismissing as primitive. Preservation: mudrā (phyag rgya) here indicates the symbolic consort practice where physical union serves as support for wisdom recognition.

[Extended Analysis: Knowledge-Woman (Rig Ma) ]
The "knowledge-woman" (rig ma) represents the feminine principle of wisdom—the union of skillful means and wisdom. View register: not ordinary woman but symbolic representation of emptiness. Translation risk: reifying as actual woman or dismissing as mere symbol. Preservation: rig ma is the consort who embodies wisdom; the practice requires actual consort or visualization, depending on capacity. "Examining" (brtag) indicates assessing suitability—physical characteristics, astrological compatibility, willingness.

[Extended Analysis: Channel Examination]
Examining channel characteristics (rtsa'i mtshan nyid brtag) involves the subtle body anatomy—central, right, left channels, their intersections, and qualities. View register: subtle body as map for energetic transformation. Translation risk: anatomical literalism or dismissal as fantasy. Preservation: the channels (rtsa) are not physical nerves but energetic pathways; their "examination" is recognition of how energy flows. The five family classifications (dung can, glang sna can, padma can, ri dwags can, ba glang can) indicate different channel configurations corresponding to Buddha families.

[Extended Analysis: Bindu (Thig Le) Practices]
The bindu (thig le)—drops or essences—represent the refined energetic substances that flow through channels. "Descending conventional bindu" (kun rdzob kyi thig le dbab) indicates bringing the essence from crown to heart or navel. View register: bindu as support for bliss generation and wisdom recognition. Translation risk: literalizing as physical substance or dismissing. Preservation: bindu represents the union of red and white essences—the non-dual nature manifesting as bliss.

[8172-8671]
Family classification. Outer family: royal caste accomplishes Tathāgata family Buddha, minister caste Vajra family, commoner caste Jewel family, Brahmin caste Lotus family, outcaste caste Karma family. Inner family: yakṣa daughter, god daughter, nāga daughter, Brahmā daughter, Indra daughter as Karma Mudrā. Buddhas determined as five families with respective knowledge-women. Scripture from Great Empowerment Arrangement (dbang bkod chen po) and Vajraḍākinī Samvara (rdo rje mkha' 'gro sdom pa).

[Extended Analysis: Five Families and Castes]
Lines 8172-8190 present the correspondence between Indian social castes (varna) and five Buddha families. Royal (rgyal rigs) corresponds to Tathāgata/Buddha family (sangs rgyas rigs). Minister (rje'u rigs) corresponds to Vajra family. Commoner (dmangs rigs) corresponds to Jewel/Ratna family. Brahmin (bram ze) corresponds to Lotus/Padma family. Outcaste (gdol pa'i rigs) corresponds to Karma family. View register: social hierarchy as symbolic of spiritual types, not valorization of caste. Translation risk: endorsing caste system or appearing to. Preservation: the correspondence is symbolic—different spiritual affinities correlate with different social backgrounds, but all five families are equally necessary for complete enlightenment.

[Extended Analysis: Inner Family - Non-Human Consorts]
The inner family (nang gi rigs) lists non-human consorts: yakṣa (gnod sbyin), god (lha), nāga (klu), Brahmā (tshangs pa), Indra (brgya byin) daughters as Karma Mudrā. View register: wisdom available through all realms, not only human. Translation risk: mythologizing or literalizing non-human beings. Preservation: these represent different energetic qualities—yakṣas earth/wealth, gods pleasure, nāgas water/power, Brahmā purity, Indra sovereignty. The citation from Vajraḍākinī Samvara establishes tantric scriptural authority.

[Extended Analysis: Secret Family - Physical Characteristics]
Lines 8203-8234 present the secret family (gsang ba'i rigs) classification by physical characteristics: conch-shell woman (dung can ma), elephant-nose woman (glang sna can ma), lotus woman (padma can), deer woman (ri dwags can), cow woman (ba glang can ma). Each has specific physical markers—hair quality, forehead shape, and corresponding channel qualities. View register: physical form as indicator of energetic configuration. Translation risk: objectifying women or reducing to physical traits. Preservation: these are classifications for practice purposes, like medical body-types, not value judgments.

[Extended Analysis: Lotus Woman as Supreme]
Lines 8219-8221 identify the lotus woman (padma can) as supreme for generating bliss and clarifying dharmatā—"like lotus blossomed and un-blossomed channels exist, therefore channel-opening instruction is chief." View register: certain configurations optimally support recognition. Translation risk: hierarchical ranking of women. Preservation: the "supremacy" is functional—lotus configuration optimally supports the practice, not a value judgment on persons.

[Extended Analysis: Deer Woman and Channels]
The deer woman (ri dwags can) has "channels entering thin like the deer king Enaya's haunch" (ri dwags kyi rgyal po enaya'i byin pa ltar rtsa 'jug phra ba). View register: subtle body configurations vary and affect practice. Translation risk: anatomical literalism. Preservation: the deer represents sensitivity and gentleness; its "haunch" symbolizes the subtle channel entry points. The instruction "like Enaya's haunch, thin and concentrated" indicates specific practice approach for this configuration.

[Extended Analysis: Elephant-Nose Woman and Attraction]
The elephant-nose woman (glang sna ma) has channels "rising upward and coiled like elephant's trunk" (glang po'i snar ltar gyen la log nas yod). View register: different configurations require different techniques. Translation risk: literal anatomical description. Preservation: the elephant represents power and stability; its trunk symbolizes the upward-rising energy that requires specific attraction (dgug pa) techniques.

[Extended Analysis: Five Wisdoms and Five Consorts]
Lines 8235-8237 state that all five "act as vidyādharas of five wisdoms, therefore determined as five." View register: consort practice as direct support for realizing five wisdoms. Translation risk: reducing wisdom to sexual symbolism. Preservation: the five consort types correspond to five wisdoms—through the practice, the five aspects of primordial knowing are realized. This is not metaphor but functional correspondence.

[Extended Analysis: Scriptural Authority for Classification]
The citation from dbang bkod chen po (Great Empowerment Arrangement) at lines 8187-8190 establishes canonical authority: "Buddha families also from difference, knowledge-women also thus from difference become." View register: diversity as natural expression, not deviation. Translation risk: proof-texting. Preservation: the scripture affirms that different practitioners require different approaches—the classification serves individual needs.

[Structural Synthesis: Complete Empowerment Framework]
This section (8138-8671) presents the complete framework for Prajñā-Jñāna empowerment within the condensed elaboration system. The architecture moves from the four empowerments and their lineage, through detailed mudrā classifications, to consort family typology. The view throughout is that these elaborate procedures serve direct recognition—the consort practice reveals the indivisibility of bliss and emptiness, the families indicate different approaches suited to different practitioners, the channels and bindus provide the subtle body technology for transformation. The translator must preserve both the technical specificity of the practices and the ultimate recognition they serve. Despite the elaborate enumeration, the essence is simple: recognize the non-dual nature of bliss and emptiness through whatever means are appropriate.
