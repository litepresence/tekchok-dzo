[18610-19302]
Five wisdoms exposition—extensive section. First: appearing wisdom (snang ba'i ye shests) manifests as five elements (earth, water, fire, air, space) while remaining fundamentally empty. Second: dharmadhatu wisdom (chos dbyings ye shests)—beyond conceptual grasping, like space, cutting the five sensory attachments. Third: mirror-like wisdom (me long ye shests)—knowing all appearances without grasping. Fourth: discriminating wisdom (shes rab ye shests)—knowing distinctions among phenomena while remaining in equality. Fifth: all-accomplishing wisdom (bya ba grub pa ye shests)—activity without effort. Key structural pattern: each wisdom section follows formula of "wisdom is X, arising from Y, producing Z." Longest Chapter 14 section at 693 lines—likely core tantric curriculum. Register: highest tantric technical precision with standard five-wisdom taxonomy.
