[3709-3731]
Structural function: This section establishes the threefold view recognition as the foundation for the view of cutting the continuum of the city. The structural arrangement presents a graduated progression: first recognizing outer phenomena as lacking self-nature through the vajra eye, then recognizing inner dharmatā as lacking self-nature through the wisdom eye, and finally recognizing the non-duality of expanse and rigpa through the essential eye. This threefold structure encompasses the complete path from conventional appearance to ultimate recognition.

[3709-3723]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen view of external phenomena as appearance without inherent existence. The recognition that all appearances—worlds and beings—are like the eight similes of illusion dissolves the reification that generates cyclic existence. The view that there is no doubt of returning to the three realms establishes the confidence that comes from recognizing the empty nature of all phenomena. This outer view serves as the foundation for the deeper recognitions that follow.

[3724-3743]
Preservation note: The multiple scriptural citations—from the Sun-Moon Union and Self-Arisen—establish the authoritative basis for the view of external phenomena. These citations present the view in both technical and poetic formulations, demonstrating how the tradition articulates the same recognition through different modes of expression. The Sun-Moon Union verse establishes the view as appearance-emptiness non-duality without blocking the six sense-fields, while the Self-Arisen verse presents the direct perception of rigpa as the supreme view.

[3744-3763]
Structural function: This section presents the inner view of dharmatā, establishing the recognition of dharmatā through the wisdom eye. The structural arrangement builds upon the outer view: having recognized phenomena as empty, the practitioner now recognizes the nature of mind itself as unborn and free from conceptual elaboration. The progression from outer to inner establishes the complete view that encompasses both phenomena and mind.

[3764-3787]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen view of the nature of mind as unborn and self-arisen. The recognition that even self-awareness lacks a grasping mind dissolves the subtlest forms of reification. The view that conceptual thought and characteristics are naturally absent establishes the non-conceptual recognition that characterizes this tradition. The quotation from Self-Arisen presents the view as great meditation beyond effort and achievement, capturing the essence of effortless recognition.

[3788-3815]
Translation risk: The technical terminology for the three eyes—vajra eye, wisdom eye, essential eye—requires precise rendering. These represent progressive capacities for recognition rather than literal organs of sight. The "essential eye" in particular refers to the capacity to recognize the non-duality of expanse and rigpa, the deepest level of view. The distinction between these three requires careful preservation to maintain the graduated nature of the presentation.

[3816-3841]
Structural function: This section presents the secret view of rigpa, establishing the non-dual recognition of expanse and awareness as the culmination of view. The structural arrangement completes the threefold progression: outer phenomena, inner dharmatā, secret rigpa. This secret view represents the direct recognition that transcends the subject-object duality of outer and inner. The presentation of this view as "cutting the continuum of the city" establishes its liberating function.

[3842-3866]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen view of the non-duality of expanse and rigpa as the ultimate view of all buddhas. The recognition that no buddha is achieved through mental examination establishes the transcendence of conceptual approaches. The view that samsara and nirvana are primordially pure dissolves the final dualistic fixation. This view, named "cutting the continuum of the city," represents the complete liberation from the womb-city of cyclic existence into non-return and buddhahood in this life.

[3867-3892]
Preservation note: The multiple scriptural citations—from the Sun-Moon Union and Lion Perfection—establish the authoritative basis for the secret view. The Sun-Moon Union verse presents the progression of capacities: superior practitioners achieve without two births, intermediate in the bardo, last at the moment of exhalation. This graduated presentation requires preservation for its function as a recognition framework and soteriological map.

[3893-3917]
Structural function: This section presents the essential point instruction of the mountain peak settling method, establishing how the comprehensive view enables the recognition of all vehicle intentions. The structural arrangement uses the mountain peak metaphor: from the summit, all lower valleys are visible, while from below, the summit remains unseen. This captures the Dzogchen self-understanding as the summit of all paths, the perspective from which all other paths are comprehended while remaining incomprehensible to them.

[3918-3942]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen view as the comprehensive recognition that encompasses all nine yānas within its own system. The view that one sees all from the peak while others cannot see this perspective establishes the hierarchical yet non-exclusive nature of the tradition. The recognition that the three realms are completely liberated into great purity captures the scope of this view: nothing remains outside the recognition, no realm remains to be purified.

[3943-3967]
Translation risk: The mountain peak metaphor captures the Dzogchen self-understanding but requires careful rendering to avoid appearing as mere sectarianism. The perspective is not that Dzogchen is "better" than other paths in a competitive sense, but that it represents the recognition from which all paths are understood. The technical terminology of the nine yānas and their respective intentions requires precise rendering to maintain the systematic nature of the presentation.

[3968-3992]
Structural function: This section presents the intention of the view: the great liberation of the three realms. The structural arrangement establishes that for the yogin who recognizes in this way, there is nothing unliberated, as all has transcended bondage and liberation from the beginning. This establishes the fruition as the recognition of what has always been the case, rather than the achievement of something new. The multiple quotations from the Six Expanses establish the textual foundation for this recognition.

[3993-4017]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen view as the recognition that all appearances are the display of the baseless, self-arisen great expanse—like dreams, illusions, or sky. This view dissolves the duality between appearance and emptiness, establishing the equal purity of all phenomena. The quotations from the Six Expanses enumerate the various aspects of this recognition: non-arising feeling and cognition, non-blocking pure appearance, self-arisen great appearance without grasping or thought.

[4018-4042]
Preservation note: The catalog of recognition aspects—from the Six Expanses—presents the comprehensive nature of the view through multiple dimensions. These enumerations serve as meditation supports and recognition frameworks, requiring preservation of their specific formulations. The repetition of "Samantabhadra I teach" establishes the authoritative voice of the tradition, connecting the presentation to the primordial buddha.

[4043-4067]
Structural function: This section presents the result of the view: afflictions settled in their place without being abandoned or transformed. The structural arrangement establishes the fruition of view practice as the spontaneous liberation of afflictions through recognition of their nature. This represents the completion of the fourfold structure: view, essential point, intention, and result. The presentation of this result establishes the practicality of the view—it actually transforms experience rather than merely providing philosophical understanding.

[4068-4092]
View register: The perspective here presents the Dzogchen approach to afflictions as self-liberation without abandonment. The view that afflictions settle in their place—like clouds clearing in sky or silt settling in water—dissolves the duality between purification and impurity. The three temporal dimensions establish the completeness of this liberation: initially confusion not experienced, presently not abiding in confusion, finally confusion impossible. This establishes the person who has abandoned dharmas as one who has transcended fixation rather than rejected phenomena.

[4093-4117]
Preservation note: The catalog of self-liberating phenomena—from the Six Expanses—enumerates how various afflictions and perceptions naturally liberate when recognized as mind's display. The specific pairing of each phenomenon with its liberated expression establishes a systematic recognition framework: existence and non-existence self-purified in the mind of appearance, self-grasping purified in the mind of self-appearance, and so on. This enumerative structure requires preservation for its function as a comprehensive recognition support.

[4118-4142]
Structural function: This section concludes the presentation of the view of cutting the continuum of the city, establishing this as the result of view exposition. The structural arrangement completes the fourfold presentation and establishes its function as the foundation for the subsequent result section. The progression from view to result demonstrates how theoretical recognition matures into practical transformation, establishing the continuity between understanding and realization.

[4143-4167]
View register: The perspective here presents the view result as the natural expression of recognition. The view that there is no phenomenon that does not self-liberate establishes the completeness of the recognition. The understanding that all afflictions are the display of the nature of mind dissolves the need for repressive or transformative practices. This view enables the practitioner to rest in natural purity without the anxiety of needing to change experience.

[4168-4192]
Translation risk: The term "person who has abandoned dharmas" refers to one who has transcended fixation on all phenomena, not to someone who has rejected Buddhism or practice. This technical usage requires precise rendering to avoid nihilistic misinterpretation. The sense of having "left behind" dharmas captures the transcendence of conceptual frameworks that characterizes complete recognition. This nuanced meaning requires careful preservation.

[4193-4217]
Structural function: This section transitions to the fourth topic: the result of continuous practice. The structural arrangement presents the fourfold structure of the result section: naturally pure result, essential point of rigpa settling, intention of pure three realms, and result of afflictions self-liberated. This establishes the result as the natural expression of the view previously established, completing the systematic presentation of view, meditation, and result.

[4218-4242]
View register: The perspective here presents the naturally pure result as the recognition that all phenomena are primordially pure. The view that king, commoner, and minister—though different in social status—are equally unchanging in their nature dissolves the duality between high and low, pure and impure, sacred and profane. This equalization establishes the foundation for the subsequent presentations of the essential point, intention, and result of continuous practice.
