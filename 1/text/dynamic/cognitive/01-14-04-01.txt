[18274-18609]
Wisdom essence exposition—first section. Opens with definition: yeshes is self-knowing recognition transcending samsara and nirvana. Threefold classification: gzhi gnas (basis-wisdom), mtshan nyid 'dzin (characteristics-grasping), yul khyab (object-encompassing). First aspect: primordial wisdom of empty essence beyond existence-nonexistence, like space—negations without positive imputation. Second aspect: spontaneously accomplished wisdom appears as jewel-treasure, complete qualities manifesting while empty. Third: all-appearing wisdom—simultaneous luminosity and emptiness. Key phrase: "neither born nor ceased, like space"—standard Madhyamaka negation applied to Dzogchen wisdom. Register: highest philosophical precision.
