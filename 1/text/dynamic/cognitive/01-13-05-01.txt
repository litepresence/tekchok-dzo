Extended structural analysis: This section presents the complete system of Thogal visionary experiences organized through eleven major topics. The progression moves from initial appearances to complete exhaustion of phenomena into the ground. Each topic represents a stage of increasing familiarity with the natural display of rigpa.

The first topic addresses light appearances that initially manifest like mirror surfaces, then as fragments filling all space. These are not external phenomena but the display of Dharmata itself. The practitioner learns to recognize whatever appears as this display through progressive familiarization.

The Rangshar tantra citation establishes the method: settling body and speech in their natural place while examining appearances. This creates the condition for Space Vidya to find the measure of familiarity. Outer appearances progressively increase from above, gradually obtaining great self-familiarity and stability.

The second topic addresses pristine cognition seeing familiarization. The key is seeing without mind grasping whatsoever. This is held in the completely pure sky of unceasing power. The eye center in the lower sky reveals Thusness pure Space Lamp. Through King Awareness-Knowledge, one familiarizes seeing one's own View, making deep familiarization paramount.

The measurement system provides precise guidelines: practice from nose-tip to upper-reach between eyebrows reveals blue expanding shimmering light with visionary spikes. The contour appears like mirror fragments inside pervasion extent, with vision bodies arising as measure.

The third topic addresses bindu focusing where appearances rise above. Seeing one's own face at the upper-reach four finger-widths creates the condition for excellent being separated from entry into Samsara. Whatever appears becomes filled vessel qualities with Emanation accomplished.

The progressive stages continue through sixteen moments as bindus unripened reach the body. The sequence progresses through six, ten, five, three without doubt until Sambhogakaya reaching ground exhaustion. Inner body fingers focusing causes elements to self-cessate.

The eighth location establishes Space Ground, Citta Space, Path Briguta Space, and Fruition Self-Arising location as the cloudless sky. These represent progressively subtle dimensions of recognition.

The nine gates describe how visionary experiences arise: from eye Lamp Blazing, appearing manner unchanging pervasion, self-purity appearances, Space Awareness united pair abiding primordially, resting evenly self-arising, own sphere appearances connected with eye, sky free conditions, and unceasing arising.

The ten Space Lamp describes arising from two corners of eye as blue great-pervading light without limit. Inner Rigpa abides as light in mansion while outwardly bindu necklace appears thousandfold. Emptiness abides as fence with five-colored light-display encircling. Space itself possesses no coarse substantiality, not established as object grasping.

The severance from nihilistic severance means self-clear like rainbow, unharmed by elemental disturbance, not conditioned by Samsara. Through seeing and familiarizing, one becomes originally enlightened and re-enlightened.

The eleven analogical example uses the four Naro letters with two wings gathered as one Naro accomplished. Outer blue Space appearances arise gathered together designated as one Space Lamp. The form of Naro creates great blue pervasion. When first appearing at eyebrow-center, black form appears somewhat upright with curvature. Focusing on that afterwards fills intermediate space like five-colored rainbow.

Translator must preserve the technical terminology of Thogal visionary experiences while conveying that these are natural manifestations of awareness, not constructed visualizations. The numerical precision of the measurement system is essential for practice.
