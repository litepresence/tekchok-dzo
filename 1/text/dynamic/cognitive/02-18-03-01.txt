Preservation: sequence structure essential for understanding path progression.

Structural marker for direct introduction instructions. Critical warning passage—without three vital points reliance, view becomes mere intellectual conceptualization. View register: doctrinal caution against scholarly distortion of experiential transmission. Translation: maintain conditional phrasing (mi...na). Preservation: the warning's force depends on recognizing what "mere words cast outward" signifies in practice context.

[4408-4409]
Structural marker for four pure visions presentation. Natural arising through progressive stages after introduction and practice. View register: phenomenological description of advanced realization. Translation: preserve rang bzhin/rang snang terminology distinguishing natural from contrived. Preservation: the progression (ji ltar 'char ba'i rim pa) indicates developmental dimension often missed in static translations.
