[Extended Analysis: All Nature Four Kāyas of Marks]
All nature (rang bzhin thams cad) four kāyas of marks (mtshan nyid sku bzhi). The four kāyas represent the complete nature of buddhahood. View register: four kāyas as aspects of one nature.

[Extended Analysis: Five Perfections Structure]
The five perfections (phun sum tshogs pa lnga) are the standard framework for describing complete buddhahood: teacher (ston pa), abode (gnas), teaching (bstan pa), retinue ('khor), and time (dus). These five apply to each kaya, adapted to its nature. For dharmakāya, these are ineffable; for saṃbhogakāya, they are glorious; for nirmāṇakāya, they are adapted to beings. View register: fivefold structure as complete description.

[Extended Analysis: Samantabhadra as Dharmakāya Teacher]
Samantabhadra (kun tu bzang po)—"All Good"—represents the primordial Buddha, dharmakāya itself personified. Not a historical figure but the symbol of enlightened nature always present. View register: primordial Buddha as symbolic, not temporal. Translation risk: literalizing as person. Preservation: kun tu bzang po represents the all-good nature of mind—primordially pure, spontaneously perfect.

[Extended Analysis: Dharmadhātu as Abode]
Dharmadhātu (chos kyi dbyings)—the realm of dharma, space of phenomena—is the abode of dharmakāya. Not a place but the infinite openness in which all phenomena appear. View register: dharmadhātu as space of awareness.

[Extended Analysis: Uncompounded Retinue]
The retinue of dharmakāya is uncompounded ('dus ma byas)—not assembled beings but the natural manifestations of wisdom. No gathering required; presence is inherent. View register: retinue as natural display, not assembled group.

[Extended Analysis: Dharmatā Without Change as Time]
Time for dharmakāya is dharmatā without change (chos nyid 'gyur med)—not temporal sequence but timeless nature. View register: timelessness as temporal mode.

[Extended Analysis: Four Seeds and Four Empowerments]
The four seeds (sa bon bzhi) and four empowerments (dbang bzhi) indicate the potential and actualization of kayas. Seeds are latent; empowerments activate. View register: potential and actualization.

[Extended Analysis: Vairocana and Gaṅgā Lake]
Vairocana (rnam par snang mdzad)—"Illuminating"—the saṃbhogakāya Buddha, appearing at Gaṅgā Lake, the gathering place of Buddhas. Dense array (g.ya' bkod) describes the elaborate palace. View register: glorious manifestation.

[Extended Analysis: Six Syllables from Tongue Light Rays]
The teaching—six syllables (yi ge drug) self-arisen from tongue light rays—indicates mantra as natural expression, not created teaching. View register: mantra as spontaneous wisdom.

[Extended Analysis: Four Family Buddhas as Retinue]
The four family Buddhas (rigs lnga'i sangs rgyas)—Akshobhya, Vairocana, Amitabha, Ratnasambhava, Amoghasiddhi—represent the retinue, with Vairocana central. View register: mandala structure.

[Extended Analysis: Twenty-Five Stacked Above Sixteen Below]
The field description—twenty-five stacked above, sixteen below, vajra posture—describes the elaborate mandala palace of saṃbhogakāya. View register: architectural symbolism.

[Extended Analysis: Sixth Vajradhara as Nirmāṇakāya]
The sixth Vajradhara (rdo rje 'chang drug pa) indicates the current Buddha of this era, emanating from the five Buddha families. View register: historical Buddha as emanation.

[Extended Analysis: Tuṣita and Ogmin]
Tuṣita (dga' ldan)—the joy realm—where the future Buddha resides before final emanation. Ogmin ('og min)—"not lower"—the pure land above all. View register: pure lands as abodes.

[Extended Analysis: Taming Through Form]
Time for nirmāṇakāya is taming through form (gzugs kyis 'dul ba'i dus)—the era when beings are taught through physical manifestation. View register: form as teaching method.

[Extended Analysis: Svābhāvikakāya Beyond Thought]
Svābhāvikakāya (ngo bo nyid sku)—essence nature body—is beyond thought and expression (bsam brjod kyi yul las 'das). The most subtle aspect, pointing to nature itself. View register: ineffability of essence.

[Extended Analysis: Integration of Four Kāyas]
The four kāyas integrate as complete buddhahood—dharmakāya as essence, saṃbhogakāya as enjoyment, nirmāṇakāya as manifestation, svābhāvikakāya as nature. None separate; all aspects of one enlightenment. View register: unity in diversity.

[Structural Synthesis: Complete Four Kāyas Framework]
This section (9518-9567) presents the complete framework of the four kāyas—dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya, and svābhāvikakāya—each with five perfections. The architecture systematically describes each kaya with teacher, abode, teaching, retinue, time, field, dharma, and activity. The view throughout is that the four kāyas represent different aspects or dimensions of complete enlightenment, not separate entities. Dharmakāya is the truth body beyond characteristics; saṃbhogakāya is the enjoyment body for advanced practitioners; nirmāṇakāya is the emanation body for ordinary beings; svābhāvikakāya is the essential nature body. The translator must preserve the technical terminology and the eightfold or fivefold structures while conveying that these are descriptive categories, not ontological separations. The four kāyas together represent the complete manifestation of buddhahood for the benefit of all beings according to their capacity.
