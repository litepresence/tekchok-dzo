Chapter 18: Distinguishing Dzogchen from common vehicles—seven key differences. First: point (nadb) distinction—other paths require great effort, Dzogchen point is effortless direct recognition. Second: non-reliance on conceptual thought—unlike other systems depending on intellectual analysis, Dzogchen rests in non-conceptual direct awareness. Third: single meaning beyond words—whereas other vehicles depend on word sequences, Dzogchen shows meaning directly without verbal mediation. Fourth: self-manifestation vs. cause-effect—other paths work through cause-effect, Dzogchen recognizes result arising naturally without effort. Fifth: no dependence on subtle winds and bindus—unlike tantric systems requiring life-force manipulation, Dzogchen works in any moment. Sixth: three bodies arising naturally—unlike gradual vehicles, Dzogchen's three kayas manifest spontaneously. Seventh: supreme mastery beyond all vehicles.
