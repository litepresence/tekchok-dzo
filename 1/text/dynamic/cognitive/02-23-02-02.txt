[12351-12521]
Meditation on impermanence and emptiness. Impermanent compounded dharmas resemble dream, illusion. Standard similes: star, dust, eye-disease, lamp, magical-illusion, dew, water-bubble, dream, lightning, cloud. Life impermanent like dream—dream establishment not exists. Life like rushing water—by falling water not sit as one. Life like wind not grasped—by wind beings not seized. Life like short-duration emanation—emanation not remain always. Life like not-true magical-illusion—magical illusion true ground not seized. Life like not-staying traveler—traveler not always sit. Structural note: standard Buddhist impermanence contemplations applied to Dzogchen practice motivation.
