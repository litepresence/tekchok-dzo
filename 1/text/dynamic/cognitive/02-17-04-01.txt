The conduct chapter opening establishes three categories: Characteristic Vehicle conduct, Mantra general conduct, and Great Perfection spontaneous conduct. This tripartite structure serves the pedagogical function of hierarchical presentation from lower to higher vehicles. The view register positions Dzogchen not as rejection of lower approaches but as their transcendence. The citation from Rangshar provides scriptural authority for the typology, establishing conduct-with-method and conduct-without-method as the crucial distinction.

Characteristic Vehicle conduct enters the common path but conduct alone does not quickly liberate—this establishes the limitation of ethical discipline without view. The critique emphasizes attachment to conduct itself as binding. The translation risk involves rendering this as pedagogical progression rather than sectarian dismissal. Preservation requires maintaining the distinction between "with method" and "without method" as central to understanding Dzogchen's unique position.

Mantra general conduct possesses method but remains in effortful accomplishment, so quick liberation does not occur. This establishes the intermediate status of tantric practice—superior to sutra through method, yet still constrained by deliberate engagement. The view register recognizes the value of method while pointing toward the spontaneity beyond deliberate application. Translation must preserve the technical vocabulary of "effortless" versus "effortful."

Great Perfection spontaneous conduct has no acceptance or rejection in the nature, conducting accordingly, dwelling in sky-like great spontaneous liberation beyond direction and class. The twenty-one vajra conducts through animal similes from Nyida Khajor Tantra present a comprehensive conduct inventory. Bee conduct enjoys all flavors; deer conduct abandons delusion conditions; mute conduct abandons delusion speech; bird conduct cuts secret mantra doubts; madman conduct dwells in unified objects; lion conduct abandons fear mind and moves in charnel grounds.

The enumeration continues: dog-pig conduct abandons pure-impure conceptions; weasel conduct uses memory and thought as sudden occurrence; small child conduct abandons long-term delusion attachment; camel conduct uses worldly conventional speech to guide; great elephant conduct turns from samsara's battles; deer conduct abandons friend-enemy perceptions; queen bee conduct cuts desire satisfaction timing; bear conduct does not spread samsara's seed; brahmin conduct abandons others' enjoyed food; heroine conduct distinguishes samsara-nirvana boundaries; fish conduct places memory support in self-place; sky-spear conduct uses all things universally.

Space wind-like conduct abandons grasping and fixation thoughts; garuda conduct cuts abysses with wings; mountain conduct uses unmoving self-pure above; great thunder conduct uses appearance not returning outward. Though twenty-two are listed, the two deer conducts are combined into one, making twenty-one total. This demonstrates the flexibility in enumeration while preserving complete coverage. Translation must maintain the integrity of the simile system while rendering each animal's characteristics accessibly.

The vajra song-dance section transitions from general conduct to specific ritual expression. Five occasions for song-dance: distinguishing samsara-nirvada, gathering, empowerment, mandala accomplishment, and concentration enhancement. The citation establishes song as companion to non-conceptual samadhi, not mere entertainment. The structural function demonstrates how ritual supports recognition without becoming performance.

Detailed ritual instructions for body, speech, and mind: peaceful costume uses silk and jewel ornaments, peaceful crown, vajra and bell; wrathful costume uses six bone ornaments, ash paste, tiger skin skirt, bhanda, and phurba. Body postures—right extended left contracted and variations—function as mudras with specific energetic effects. The mantras and seed syllables provide the vocal dimension of practice. Translation risk involves exoticizing the wrathful imagery rather than conveying its yogic function.

Song lyrics from Nyida Khajor present the view in poetic form: unborn therefore not ceasing, going and coming absent, pervading all, great bliss supreme dharma unmoving, equal to space liberation without defilement. This demonstrates how song carries the view. The structural function connects ritual performance to view recognition. Preservation requires maintaining the poetic structure while conveying the philosophical content.

Benefits of song-dance: supreme method for yogins, vajra song without sound, satisfying all buddhas' minds, companion to yogins' experience, capturing dakinis' minds, turning back six migrations' attachment, source of virtue accumulation, place for gathering merit, self-liberating all mind streams, clearing beings' faults, purifying bodily obscurations, granting empowerments and samaya bliss, suppressing ignorance together, resting place for all vehicles, threshold between view and meditation, pure field for essence holders.

Definite sequence conduct for timing determination presents three aspects: beginner conduct, samsara-nirvana distinguishing conduct, and vowed commitment conduct. Beginner conduct includes ten Dharma activities: writing, offering, giving, listening, reading, holding, explaining, recitation, contemplation, and meditation. The structural function provides graduated entry into the complete conduct system. The citation from Madhyamaka establishes the ten activities as immeasurable merit accumulation.

The practice of gathering deep instructions and receiving the three empowerments uses body, speech, and mind conduct to distinguish samsara-nirvana, settling awareness in its place. The three wisdoms—hearing, contemplation, meditation—cut outer, inner, and secret superimpositions respectively. This demonstrates how gradual practice supports direct recognition. Translation must preserve the technical vocabulary of "superimposition" and "cutting."

Deer conduct like fearful deer staying alone in mountains exemplifies solitary retreat practice. Mute conduct cuts speech, speaking with no one. When done, memory freezes, producing madman conduct—body, speech, and mind activity without planetary fixation, occurring spontaneously. At that time, dog-pig conduct without pure-impure discrimination arises, enjoying food and clothing without selection. The similes work together as a progressive system.

When six completions are finished, lion conduct arises—not suppressed by others' methods but suppressing outward. Like a lion without fear or terror toward anything, the yogin becomes free from harm by humans and non-humans, gaining power over all. This establishes the culmination of conduct practice. The view register maintains that these are not moral injunctions but descriptions of natural behavior when recognition is stable.

Meditation conduct presents the general meditation framework: deity yoga meditation, Mahayana concentration, and the intention of all buddhas of the three times. The citation from Thalgyur establishes meditation as involving channels, winds, thigles, body essential points, eyes, and emptiness. This demonstrates the integration of tantric physiology with Dzogchen view. Translation must preserve the technical terminology while showing its function within the broader system.

The twenty-one mind holdings present detailed meditation instructions: placing mind on white A at the nose tip, coordinating with breathing; using PHAT to cut thoughts; using wrathful laughter; using demi-gods' argument visualizations; using HUM to drive thoughts; using RAM at the navel; using empty thigle at the heart. Each technique targets specific obstacles and produces distinct experiences. The structural function provides comprehensive methods for all practitioner types.

Seven sets for seeing true nature: gradually cutting the body's many parts with names, investigating names until meaning becomes particles, searching for where names abide without finding, resting in empty nature without search or memory. This analytical meditation on emptiness leads to non-dual empty experience. The application extends to all appearances as body. Instant emptiness meditation sees all appearance as empty-clear like pressing a mirror.

Impermanence meditation trains on appearance without fixation, various appearances therefore unreliable, becoming free from fixation. Five elements meditation rests awareness on whatever appears of the five elements, releasing where placed, producing dream-like liberation experience. Non-conceptual meditation recognizes whatever appears as thought-free, abiding thus from the beginning, producing great self-abiding thought-free concentration. Union meditation looks intensely at dualistic appearance when it arises, producing great non-dual self-pure experience.

Space path meditation rests awareness in space, all appearances and mind motionless in sky expanse without support, meditating sky and all phenomena as equal, producing great emptiness free from extremes. The citation from Nyida Khajor summarizes: A letter meditation turns back entity attachment; generated deity meditation purifies bodily defilements; vajra song satisfies the mind. HUM letter meditation purifies speech defilements. RAM meditation conquers all entities. The structural integration demonstrates how all methods converge in Dzogchen practice.

Bodhisattva concentration presents two divisions: essence and incidental. Essence includes natural concentration spontaneously arising without thought, abiding in mode; dependent concentration that causes body and speech to enter the mode; object-support concentration as antidote to afflictions; ground-abiding concentration as the bodhisattva ground's samadhi. The incidental division includes natural concentration present in all sentient beings during moments of mind distraction, and fabricated concentration deliberately created by mind.

Day-night union meditation presents three aspects: meditation, ocean-completely-placed method, and the dharmata of ground-appearance placed in intention. The twenty-one mind holdings continue with specific techniques: lung and body essential points combined with mind-horse, pulling and gathering wind, cutting thought streams. Evening practice closes memory doorway through sense faculty essential point gathering. Midnight knowledge placed in vase causes wisdom to dawn clearly.

Morning practice on wisdom clarity shows rise and fall experiences self-purifying. Daytime appearance radiance suppresses all signs. These practices, though explained before, are summarized here as thogal supports with slight differences from previous presentations. Daytime elephant gaze looks at direct perception while letting deluded appearances self-release. Nighttime places awareness on empty thigle lamp, expanding and contracting with it.

Before sleep, placing mind in thigle empty space recognizes sleep luminosity. At midnight, holding mind on inner heart luminosity liberates dream into luminosity, cutting the stream of habitual patterns. Dawn lion gaze on bow-length sky on white A causes empty-clear free from elaboration to arise from within, resting in that mode as meditation. The structural presentation integrates all times of day into continuous practice.

The citations from Klong Drugpa support the gaze instructions and continuous practice approach. The day-night cycle demonstrates how thogal integrates with all times. Daytime appearance radiance suppresses signs; nighttime empty thigle meditation liberates dreams; dawn practice recognizes luminosity. The progression establishes round-the-clock practice without gap.

Body, sense objects, and awareness measure the pure appearances of self-appearance. When such self-appearance measures are taken, the deluded appearances of the six migrations cease. When that very ceasing occurs, awareness arrives at the measuring line. When that measuring line is reached, even one's own body is not seen—the flesh and blood body produced by elements self-purifies in the elements because it is an object appearing to mind.

The mind-body grasped by delusion self-purifies in the elements and self-releases. The light body grasped by reasoning is like moon in water. At this time, nearing the exhaustion of dharmata, whoever becomes familiar with this becomes Buddha. Then, the three bodies' limits exhausted, obtains the body of completed transcending activity. At this time, the body becomes free from all limits.

The yogin familiar with the base causes their own place to become empty. The yogin familiar with the path exhausts coarse elemental defilements. Whoever becomes familiar with the result reaches the irreversible ground. This establishes the progressive familiarization leading to irreversible result. The view register maintains that familiarization is not building up something new but recognizing what has always been present.

Third, the extensive explanation of the wheel of wisdom space expanse intention presents three aspects: essence briefly shown, nature extensively explained, and aspects summarizing meaning. The five intentions are: mountain-top intention for view practice, wisdom general anointing for ground-holding, thigle seeing liberation for investigating appearance's arising mode, sun moon equal measure for delivering to meaning's end, ocean expanse liberation for delivering awareness to the ground.

The intention of mountain-top universal intention establishes the awareness nature of Great Perfection, luminosity without transfer, space-wisdom non-dual. When realized by sense faculty, space-awareness appears as field. The view for supreme faculty shows wisdom light spontaneously arising, realizing self-wisdom without form. Intention unmoving clarity like planets on ocean. Conduct ceaseless power-arising like sky-spear. Fruit seeing birthless self-arising.

Middle faculty view realizes self-awareness without birth. Intention free from conceptual portions like flags on ocean. Conduct unblocked spontaneous like madman, without obstacle through all appearance. Fruit endowed with self-place intention, conquering signs. Last faculty view realizes appearance as illusion or emanation. Intention demonstrating self-appearance essence, wisdom arising like lion chick free from womb-egg. Conduct endowed grasping samsara-nirvana. Fruit abandoning body, breath reaches nature-emanation body field.

Second, wisdom general anointing intention establishes awareness power naturally perfect from beginning. Three faculties' different realization modes: supreme faculty recognizes empowerment as unborn fruit self-place showing. Intention unmoved in great bliss equal to space through wisdom method pressing thigle. Conduct without pure-impure in white-red bodhicitta. Fruit sees family ground suchness.

Middle faculty view recognizes appearances as awareness power. Intention rests unmoved like sun and moon united in space. Conduct in true nature yoga mode. Result obtains suchness without birth and death. Last faculty view recognizes empowerment qualities expanding. Intention relies on deity form with signs for meditation. Conduct moves in true nature display. Result obtains buddhahood through qualities doorway.

Third, thigle seeing liberation intention establishes bardo wisdom self-arising awareness recognizing self-appearance as self-awareness, achieving buddhahood. Supreme faculty view sees wisdom power qualities appearing like shooting star moving in space, recognizing liberation in three moments. Intention dwells clear and pervasive like sun risen in space. Conduct enjoys wisdom body pure. Result becomes Buddha on original purity ground in three moments.

Middle faculty view recognizes true nature bliss inexhaustible great appearing excellently arising. Intention sees each moment's distinct object, producing excellent recognitions, seeing each dharma body appearance. Last faculty view recognizes pure wisdom appearance with uncertainty about self and other. Intention rests without seeing. Conduct possesses doubt. Result obtains breath-release in nature-emanation body field.

Fourth intention, sun moon measure equal, establishes appearance-emptiness exhausting equal recognition. Supreme faculty view recognizes wisdom penetrating completeness. Intention unmoved in unobstructed wisdom like river flow. Conduct plays with great wisdom activity unceasing. Fruit obtains method wisdom union, liberating bondage, four aspects without separation. Middle faculty recognizes method wisdom non-dual. Intention rests in method wisdom nature like sun moon appearing in space.

Last faculty view recognizes father-mother union demonstrating bodhicitta appearing as result. Intention dwells in clear samadhi through remembering deity essence heart. Conduct enjoys five medicines five nectars. Result obtains pure appearance fruit by holding yidam deity maya body in bardo. Fifth intention, ocean expanse liberation, establishes dwelling in naturally clear equal true nature, innate concentration.

Supreme faculty view recognizes great wisdom activity whatever appears as own appearance. Intention has little attachment to appearance, like intoxicated with beer. Conduct moves in samsara and nirvana. Fruit obtains wisdom singularly arising not abiding in appearance. Middle faculty recognizes clear penetrating wisdom body. Intention possesses brief fierce like waterfall. Conduct possesses object of wild beasts, not common object. Fruit obtains certainty completed in emptiness wisdom essence.

Last faculty view desires abandoning deluded appearance excellently. Intention dwells in deity and human mind holding. Conduct possesses fabricated dualistic grasping. Fruit obtains divine and human status. Summary: these five intentions bind all Secret Essence yogins. The yogin's experience arises: mountain-top intention balances highest view without high or low; wisdom anointing holds its own abiding in true nature; thigle seeing investigates awareness liberation from space-appearance; sun moon equal delivers intention to exhausted phenomena expanse; ocean expanse delivers awareness to original purity ground.

First, view washes the outside, suppressing deluded appearance's fear like lion's sport. Second, obtains self-power in true nature, like royal caste receiving empowerment from crown. Third, reaches purity sphere, like peacock chick emerging from egg. Fourth, expands great equal vastness, like sun moon non-dual union. Fifth, clears self-appearance as wisdom, like sun rising from Mount Meru's neck.

Thus five requests each divided into three faculties makes fifteen, each with view, intention, conduct, fruit four by four, making sixty Dharma portions. This purifies beings' sixty eons' development and decline, afflictions, and view portions, showing the completely pure essence of wisdom. This is the twenty-fifth chapter establishing the key points of wisdom experience in spontaneous thogal.

Thus having shown the methods of practice through guidance instruction, now extensive explanation of how to practice through direct introduction: general introduction procedure determining all phenomena, and particular determination extensively explaining mind and wisdom symbols. First, preliminary before introduction and actual introduction. The preliminary presents the preparation necessary for direct recognition.

Actual introduction presents recognizing mind and nature as separate, recognizing wisdom and dharmata as separate, then introducing their inseparability. This establishes the graduated approach to recognition. The structural function moves from preparation to direct pointing. The view register maintains that recognition is not intellectual understanding but direct non-conceptual knowing.

Mind is the moving, cognizing, grasping—this is the entity to be introduced. Nature is the abiding, empty, clear—this is the field in which introduction occurs. Wisdom is the knowing without grasping, the self-clear awareness. Dharmata is the suchness, the way things actually are. These four terms establish the complete framework for introduction practice.

Introduction to mind involves looking at the present mind: where did it come from, where does it abide, where does it go? Not finding any of these, one recognizes mind's unborn nature. Introduction to nature involves looking at what remains when mind is not found—the empty clarity that is always present. This is the nature, the ground of all experience.

Introduction to wisdom involves recognizing that which knows the looking—that which is aware of the search. This awareness is not separate from what it knows, yet it is not what it knows. This is wisdom, the self-recognizing awareness. Introduction to dharmata involves seeing that all appearances are of the same nature—empty yet appearing, appearing yet empty.

The inseparability of these four is the actual introduction. Not that they become inseparable, but that they have never been separate. This is the great secret of Dzogchen. The view register emphasizes that introduction does not create something new but reveals what has always been the case. Translation must preserve the distinction between the four while showing their ultimate unity.

The particular determination of mind and wisdom symbols presents the detailed analysis of how mind functions and how wisdom recognizes. Mind is symbolized by the ocean—vast, moving, containing all. Wisdom is symbolized by the sun—clear, illuminating, without movement. These symbols support recognition without becoming objects of fixation.

The mind's six collections—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mental consciousness—are the conventional functioning. The wisdom's five doors—mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing, dharma sphere—are the ultimate display. The relationship between these two sets establishes the non-duality of conventional and ultimate.

The eight consciousnesses transform into the five wisdoms—this is the promise of practice. Not that consciousnesses become wisdoms, but that their true nature is wisdom. This transformation is not a change in nature but a recognition of nature. The view register maintains the continuity between conventional mind and ultimate wisdom.

The ground aspect of mind is the storehouse consciousness, the basis of all habitual patterns. The path aspect is the transforming consciousnesses, the dynamic functioning. The fruit aspect is the wisdoms, the recognized nature. This threefold division provides the framework for understanding the complete journey.

The afflictions—desire, anger, ignorance, pride, jealousy—are the conventional display. Their true nature is the five wisdoms—discriminating, mirror-like, dharma sphere, equality, all-accomplishing. This correspondence demonstrates the fundamental purity of all experience. Nothing needs to be rejected; everything is the display of wisdom.

The particular introduction of wisdom involves recognizing the five wisdoms in immediate experience. The wisdom that knows forms is mirror-like. The wisdom that knows equality is the wisdom of sameness. The wisdom that knows distinctions is discriminating. The wisdom that accomplishes benefit is all-accomplishing. The wisdom that knows suchness is dharma sphere.

These are not different wisdoms but different aspects of the same wisdom. Like one sun reflecting in different waters, the wisdom appears differently according to the vessel. This analogy supports recognition without reification. The view register maintains the non-dual wisdom beyond one and many.

The symbols for wisdom—sun, moon, jewel, lotus, sword—each convey specific qualities. The sun's clarity, the moon's coolness, the jewel's value, the lotus's purity, the sword's sharpness. These symbols are not arbitrary but point to actual qualities of experience. The practitioner uses these symbols to support recognition.

The completion of introduction is not the end but the beginning. Having been introduced, one practices familiarization. The familiarization is not different from the introduction but its extension in time. The view register emphasizes that introduction is sudden but familiarization takes time.

The signs of successful introduction include: decrease of attachment, increase of clarity, natural compassion, reduced conceptualization, dream practice, and meditative experiences. These are not goals but signs along the way. The practitioner does not pursue them but notices them as byproducts of practice.

The obstacles to introduction include: doubt, conceptualization, distraction, dullness, agitation, and ordinary perception. These are not enemies but opportunities for recognition. Each obstacle, when recognized as such, becomes the path. The view register maintains that there is no obstacle to recognition other than not recognizing.

The enhancement of introduction involves: repeated introduction by the teacher, self-introduction through recollection, introduction through signs and symbols, and introduction through the natural dissolution of obstacles. These four methods provide comprehensive support for recognition.

The ultimate introduction is self-introduction—awareness recognizing itself without intermediary. This is the apex of Dzogchen practice. The teacher, the teachings, and the practice all point to this. When it occurs, there is nothing more to do. The view register emphasizes that self-introduction is always available but usually overlooked.

The fruit of introduction is not something new but the recognition of what has always been the case. This is the great liberation—liberation from the need for liberation. The practitioner who has recognized this can engage in all activities without being bound by them.

The summary verse from Rangshar: "Introduction to mind, introduction to nature, introduction to wisdom, introduction to dharmata—these four introductions are the supreme path of Dzogchen." This scriptural authority establishes the centrality of introduction to the tradition. The structural function demonstrates how all previous conduct instructions support this recognition.

The integration of conduct and view completes the presentation. Conduct without view is binding; view without conduct is incomplete. Together, they form the complete path. The practitioner engages in conduct while maintaining view, in view while engaging in conduct. This is the Dzogchen way.

The final dedication transfers merit for the benefit of all beings. This is not mere formula but the expression of the recognition that self and other are not separate. The merit of practice is shared because there is no one to possess it and no one separate from it.

The colophon establishes this as the fourth chapter of the conduct section, completing the detailed presentation of conduct in the Great Perfection vehicle. The structural function marks the transition to the next major section. The view register maintains the continuity of Dzogchen teaching from beginning to end.
