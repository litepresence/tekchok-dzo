This section establishes the distinction between authentic natural meditation and fabricated cultivation. When body and speech are bound at the vital point, the vital wind enters the central channel, giving rise to inner samādhi—resting in the state of clear-light emptiness. Awareness relaxes without grasping or holding, and bliss and clarity arise spaciously. Even when anger or desire arise, there is no attachment or fixation even the size of a hair. This originates from arriving at the essential point of natural contemplation. The structural function is to establish the difference between natural and artificial meditative experience. In fabricated meditation, arising bliss produces strong attachment, coarse agitation, and desire to sing or dance. The preservation requirement is to maintain the technical distinction between bcos ma and rang bzhin without conflating them into general meditation terminology.

The signs of final transformation present eight metaphors for wind-movement experiences: like fireflies, like clouds, like smoke, like haze, like rising moon, like appearing stars, like dawn breaking with blue appearance, like rising sun with internal and external transparency. These appearances arise and dissolve, unstable and unable to remain—hence called "signs of final transformation" because they indicate wind-movement. The structural function is to provide practitioners with recognition markers for authentic progress versus disturbance. The preservation concern involves maintaining the poetic precision of these metaphors without reducing them to mere psychological states or hallucinations.

The explanation of these signs establishes that they are naturally occurring—vital wind and mind need to settle. The appearance-signs represent the self-resonance of awareness as great clear light. In the interim state, external appearance increases and reaches measure, then self-resonance dissolves into the base and turns inward—external clarity alone must dissolve because it needs to dissolve into the originally pure spontaneous presence sphere. Internally clear, in the expanse of self-light, awareness dwells in the palace of the kāya and pristine awareness—great spontaneous presence without transition or change.

[5111-5118]
The section establishes appearance-signs as primary—cognitive experiences are merely intellect, so they transform and cannot be measured, being included in the conceptual, conventional forms, memory-making, separate, surface-level thought. Attempting to measure this is like a bird making hiding places in clouds—there is no time for conceptual thought, and seeing does not arrive directly at its own face. This is the appearance-sign: seeing the five pristine awareness colors transcends the half of saṃsāric activity grasping objects as appearance. Seeing the sphere-appearance, above that, grasping and thought-aspect are absent—wrong view grasps emptiness, transcending two-thirds of saṃsāra. When conceptual ground-heap self-liberates as rang sangs, the grasping-aspect half grasping appearance as self-characteristic is reversed—this is called selflessness of persons and phenomena.

[5119-5124]
The summary establishes that appearance-experiences are gathered into two: the five pristine awareness colors' appearance and the sphere-appearance. The progressive enhancement is these appearances becoming increasingly beautiful, excellent, and numerous. The structural pattern divides into general presentation through purity-method and specific explanation through appearance-method. The preservation requirement is to maintain the technical specificity of these appearance-signs without conflating them with general meditative experiences or reducing them to psychological epiphenomena. The view register remains focused on the inseparability of appearance and emptiness within the natural state.
