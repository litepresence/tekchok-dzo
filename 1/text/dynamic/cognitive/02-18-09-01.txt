Signs and experiences in Dzogchen meditation. First: controlling body and speech, vital wind enters central channel, inner warmth arising—bliss and clarity without grasping. Comparing corrected vs. uncorrected meditation: uncorrected produces strong experiences but attachment arises; corrected produces non-attached bliss. Signs: like insects carrying fire, clouds, mist, moon rising, stars appearing, dawn breaking—appearances arise and dissolve unstably. These are wind-movement signs—indicating subtle energy movement. Structural note: practical guidance for recognizing authentic progress vs. disturbance. Register: Dzogchen meditation experience terminology.
