[5928-5962]
Advanced Dzogchen stages (10-16) and distinction from common paths. Tenth: dharma cloud—illusory appearances dissolve, pure appearance remains. Eleventh: non-attachment—nothing stains, like lotus. Twelfth: five Buddha families—wisdom lights as five wheel mandala. Thirteenth: great samādhi—awareness rests in wisdom. Fourteenth: vajra holder—spontaneous presence attained. Fifteenth: pristine awareness—beyond all else. Sixteenth: supreme wisdom teacher. Key distinction: these stages are not bodhisattva grounds—they arise from primordial awareness, not conceptual cultivation. Not common cause-effect path, not external tantric generation. Structural note: emphasizes Dzogchen's unique approach vs. common vehicles.
