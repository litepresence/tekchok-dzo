[7099-7112]
Temporal specifications establish auspicious conditions. The outer section on empowerment timing begins with favorable years—rat, dragon, horse, and pig—marked as particularly conducive. Four special years receive designation as optimal. This creates supportive external conditions rather than absolute requirements. The structural function operates as practical guidance: timing enhances but devotion matters more. Translation must preserve conditional nature—"auspicious" not "mandatory." The view register treats cosmic alignment as supportive condition, not deterministic force.

[7113-7125]
Student qualifications define recipient readiness. Samaya possession establishes foundational commitment. Harmonious elemental bodies indicate physical preparation. Numbers remain flexible—no fixed count required. One hundred, fifty, or other numbers acceptable if elements align. The structural function reveals adaptive capacity, accommodating varying circumstances without rigid exclusion. Translation risks include reifying numbers as requirements rather than guidelines. Preservation demands maintaining flexibility of "grangs la tshad du gzung du med"—no fixed numerical determination.

[7126-7136]
Obstacle recognition serves diagnostic purpose. Meaningless death indicates impurity requiring attention. Disease among assembly signals disharmony. Chaos in speech organization reveals energy disturbance. Hunger suggests merit deficiency. Memory fading indicates clarity obscuration. These function as diagnostic indicators, not superstitious omens. Translation must preserve clinical precision without alarm. The view register treats obstacles as manageable conditions requiring response, not fatal prohibitions.

[7137-7148]

[7149-7160]
Positive signs mark successful preparation. General improvement indicates blessing flow. Substance increase demonstrates material abundance. Blissful body and speech confirm experiential purification. Good signs appearing sustain auspicious momentum. These serve as progress markers, not guarantees. Translation must preserve indicative nature without promising specific results. The view register treats signs as guidance for proceeding, not deterministic predictions.

[7161-7173]
Siddhi accomplishment represents fruition. Common siddhi indicates accessible powers. Supreme accomplishment marks enlightenment potential. Faith in equality meaning establishes necessary non-dual view. Post-empowerment signs may appear continuously. The structural function distinguishes results while emphasizing practice requirement for full actualization. Translation risks include making siddhi appear as automatic empowerment effects. Preservation demands showing these as potentials requiring cultivation.

[7174-7186]
Empowerment without elaboration presents condensed approach. No year distinction required—summer and winter equally suitable. Waxing fortnight dates suffice for timing. Dawn empowerment when sounds are clear indicates appropriate moment. Simplified approach suits advanced practitioners needing less structure. The structural function demonstrates methodological flexibility for different capacities. Translation must preserve that both approaches yield identical results. The view register treats elaboration level as matching student need, not hierarchical ranking.

[7187-7200]
The four empowerments condense to essential form. Vase empowerment purifies body obscurations. Secret empowerment purifies speech. Wisdom-prajna empowerment transforms mind. Word empowerment introduces essential recognition. Direct transmission flows from Vimalamitra to Legé-tsün, with Guru Jo-ber maintaining lineage continuity. The structural function grounds practice in authenticated transmission. Translation risks include making lineage appear as institutional authority rather than recognition continuity. Preservation demands showing transmission as direct pointing-out.

[7201-7215]
Symbolic indication preceded direct transmission. As times degenerated, direct transmission became necessary. Treasure teachings present unique circumstances for hand-blessing transmission. Meaning elaboration provides sufficient alternative without contradiction. Both approaches remain valid according to circumstance. The structural function explains method adaptation historically. Translation must preserve that interruption of one lineage does not invalidate it. The view register treats all transmissions as authentic, adapting to conditions.

[7216-7228]
Comprehensive empowerment integrates both approaches. With elaboration: complete ritual structure. Without elaboration: essential core. Both valid according to capacity. Both effective producing same result. Methodological flexibility serves pedagogical purposes, not doctrinal division. The structural function accommodates all student needs. Translation risks include creating false dichotomy between approaches. Preservation demands showing both lead to identical recognition.

[7229-7241]
Timing precision demonstrates temporal sensitivity. Auspicious times enhance results. Inauspicious times invite obstacles. Remedies remain available if obstacles occur. Signs indicate progress or problems requiring response. This reflects understanding of subtle influences without superstitious fixation. Translation must preserve practical wisdom without mystification. The view register treats timing as supportive condition among many factors.

[7242-7254]
Student qualification depth emphasizes preparation. Samaya establishes commitment. Elements ensure physical harmony. Numbers remain flexible but appropriate. Devotion proves essential throughout.
