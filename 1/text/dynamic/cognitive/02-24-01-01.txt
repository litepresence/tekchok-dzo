Final faculties and becoming bardo. Those of final faculties or lesser who failed to recognize truth when dharma-nature bardo arose—when path appears within becoming bardo, dreamlike, recognition dawns: "I have died." Remembering wavering in bardo state, recall guru and instructions—resolving "Now I go unto field of natural emanation." Through blessing of dharma-nature truth previously realized, absence of self-grasping stain, propensities exhaust—miraculously arise upon lotus in that field, instantly born, liberated. Preliminary instruction: habituate daytime to direct perception of self-appearance; nighttime habituate five lights within heart, then sleep looking toward emanation field. Train power through transference during intervals. When wisdom-consciousness riding wind projects from heart or eyes to chief heart-center into emanation field through this crucial point. Structural note: Dzogchen practice for those failing earlier liberation—rebirthing in pure realms.
