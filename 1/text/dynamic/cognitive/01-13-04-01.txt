Structural function: Blazing Lamp ('bar ba'i sgron ma) detailed presentation in Thogal practice. Essence: five colors spread as five lights, rim rounds inner petal together like under-barrel house appearance. Awareness snake-noose (sbrul mdud) with ray-shooting fence arises. Bindu light house moves through slight small part. View register: Dzogchen Thogal visionary phenomenology. Translation risk: The technical terminology (snake-noose, bindu, rim rounds) requires precise rendering as these are standard Thoggal technical terms. Preservation: The visual-geometric descriptions must remain precise.

Definition: through Rigpa self-object appearance display-ground-doing, expanse through completely pure nonexistent defilement, object-appearance through chain-circle going-space, grasp appearance-awareness clarifying lamp. Former aspect: through expanse Rigpa self-object vajra chain-circle entering inside self essence thought-not, through inside expanse going-space not-grasping nonabiding manner, appearing continuous as nonexistent separation. Recognition: The Blazing Lamp is the clarifying power of awareness that illuminates all appearance without separation.

Three divisions: through abiding at ground—completely pure expanse lamp inside tsitta pristine awareness light body, spontaneous-presence clear abiding; through appearing at path—completely pure expanse lamp through five rims enclosure surrounding center possessing lotus petal essence gathering bindu; through appearing at fruit-object—completely pure expanse lamp through bound chain-circle grasping web half-web five lights. The progression from ground to path to fruition mirrors the Three Kayas.

Four natures: through abiding as self-face primordially pure enclosure, expanse Rigpa inserts naked-straight equal intention, great self-ease meditation state set-down, through spontaneous-presence primordial-resonance appearance space projection below wall-house many appearances. Five characteristics: empty clear open outer light space abiding primordially ka-pure open Self-Awareness space, through open nonexistent outer-inner unobscured nonexistent stain, great primordial ka-pure completely pure space abiding primordial characteristics nonexistent, this nonexistent object Awareness nonexistent ceasing-appearance lamp aspect-sound.

Six habituation-manner: from cut distinction samsara-nirvana, put body-speech natural-place, manifest face-introduce space fence, through making experience abiding ten Awareness day-night nonexistent. Recognition: The Blazing Lamp represents the complete illumination of awareness that transcends day-night, samsara-nirvana distinctions.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents the Blazing Lamp as one of the Four Lamps of Thogal practice, with detailed analysis of essence, definition, divisions, natures, characteristics, and habituation. The recognition required is that these descriptions are not visualizations to be created but natural manifestations to be recognized. Dzogchen terms require careful preservation precision of the Thogal terminology while maintaining the understanding that these are descriptions of naturally present luminosity.
