[1182-1588]
Five kayas/five families correspondence: essence, etymology, appearance, divisions, meaning application. Structural function: systematic mapping between kaya and family systems. View register: tantric correspondence. Risk: "five families" enumeration must match five kayas.

General abiding manner: five lights in heart-center as rigpa's wisdom. Then appearance to path-untrained: six realms luminosity gradation. View register: Dzogchen self-luminescence. Risk: luminosity terminology critical.

Detailed correspondence: each of five lights maps to kaya, wisdom, mother, element, aggregate, ground, family. Structural function: complete fivefold mapping table. Risk: precision essential for technical correspondence.

Intermediate state appearance: six impure delusion lights versus wisdom lights. Then wisdom distinction: essence, distinction, definite-words. View register: bardo doctrine. Risk: "delusion light" versus "wisdom light" distinction critical.

Five wisdoms common and definite-word distinctions: dharma-expanse, mirror, equalizing, individually-discerning, all-accomplishing. Each with example, realization, definite-word. Structural function: complete wisdom exposition. Risk: technical precision for each wisdom.

Enlightened-activity distinction: four kinds (pacifying, enriching, power, fierce) with original ground and being-time completion. Structural function: concluding kaya-wisdom-activity framework. Note: source contains mixed Tibetan-English sections requiring attention.
