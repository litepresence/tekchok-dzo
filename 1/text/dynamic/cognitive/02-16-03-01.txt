Five kayas essence section opens through mtshan rdzogs dpe byad kyi dpal 'du 'bar ba, establishing the major and minor marks as the defining characteristic. This marks a structural shift from the three kayas exposition to the five kayas system. The distinction is not hierarchical but perspectival—three kayas present the ground, five kayas present the display-variety within that ground. The verse citation from rang shar maintains the self-arising register: ngo bo mtshan dang dpe byad ldan, rang bzhin so so'i mtshan 'dzin pa. The structural function is establishing the formal characteristics that distinguish the fivefold system. Risk: translation of mtshan dang dpe byad requires technical precision; these are the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks of a Buddha, but here applied to kayas as spontaneous display rather than achieved attainments.

Etymology section for five kayas. The nges tshig presents rigs mi 'dra ba lnga'i skur snang bas rigs lnga'i sku, establishing the Buddha-family correspondence as the semantic ground. This maps the kaya-system onto the family-system that organizes tantric mandala architecture. The verse citation snang ba ye shes chen po la, rigs kyi nges tshig de bzhin no confirms the correspondence. The structural insight is that five kayas are not five separate entities but five modes of displaying the single ye shes through rigs-variety. Risk: rigs must be preserved as "family" in the technical tantric sense, not generalized as "type" or "kind."

Appearance section establishes the method-wisdom dyad as the display-mode. The phrase yab yum sku dang ye shes su snang ba preserves the tantric architecture of thabs-shes rab. The verse exposition from rang shar develops this: sku lnga ye shes snang ba ni, yab yum gnyis kyi tshul du snang, yab kyi cha 'dzin thabs kyi sku, yum gyi cha 'dzin shes rab sku. The structural function is grounding the five-kaya display in the non-dual method-wisdom dynamic. Risk: the yab-yum terminology requires careful translation to preserve the technical meaning without anthropomorphic literalization.

Division section presents two levels: rigs lnga dbye ba and sku lnga dbye ba. The rigs lnga presents the five Buddha-families—de bzhin gshegs pa'i rigs, rdo rje'i rigs, rin chen rigs, padma'i rigs, las kyi rigs—as the classification system. The sku lnga maps these onto five specific kayas: rnam par snang mdzad, rdo rje sems dpa', rin chen 'byung ldan, snang mtha' yas, don yod grub pa. The structural function is complete systematic correspondence. The verse citation maintains the authoritative pattern. Risk: each kaya-family correspondence must be preserved precisely; the mapping is not arbitrary but based on specific qualities and functions.

Meaning-application section presents two subsections: rigs lnga'i don sbyar and sku'i don sbyar. The rigs lnga section maps each family onto rig pa-qualities: rig pa'i don la de bzhin gshegs pas de bzhin rigs su bshad, rigs pa'i don la skye dang 'chi ba med pas rdo rje'i rigs su bshad, rig pa'i don la sna tshogs 'byung bas rin chen rigs su bshad, rig pa'i don la skyon med dag pas padma'i rigs su bshad, rig pa'i ngang la bya ba rdzogs pas las kyi rigs su bshad. The sku'i don sbyar maps specific kaya-names onto rig pa-functions: rig pa'i snang ba 'gag pa med pas rnam par snang mdzad yin, rig pa bdag gzhan don gnyis rtogs pas rdo rje sems dpa' yin, cig car rig pas shes pas rin chen 'byung ldan yin, rang gi snang ba mthong bas snang ba mtha' yas yin, rig pa skye med rtogs pas don yod grub pa yin. The structural density here requires recognition of the comprehensive mapping system.

General abiding manner section. The phrase gtso chen gyi 'od lnga ye nas lhun grub chen po gnas establishes the five lights as spontaneously present in the ground. The da lta sems can la yod tshul transitions to how this appears for beings now. The anatomical location through snying rin po che ze'u btugs pa 'dra ba'i nang 'od rtsa dangs pa'i dbus na establishes the heart-center as the physical correspondence. The structural function is mapping the metaphysical ground onto subtle-body geography. The verse citation ye shes chen po'i snang ba de, gnas ni tsittai dkyil na gnas maintains source authority.

Appearance to path-untrained section. The phrase rang la 'od gal gnas kyang ngo ma shes pa'i 'gro drug la da lta sgron ma'i rang 'od cha phra bar yod de establishes that the light is present but unrecognized. The six-realm gradation presents specific correspondences: mi la mtson du yod pa, lha rnams la ni blta yod pa, lha ma yin la phra bar yod, byol song rang gnas tsam du yod, yi dwags rnams la 'phrig par yod, dmyal ba'i yul la til 'bru tsam. The structural insight is that luminosity is equally present but appears differently based on karmic obstruction. Risk: the gradation must not be read as hierarchy of value; preservation requires recognizing the single-luminosity apparent-difference structure.

Path-trained appearance section. The sbyangs pa la snang tshul presents nine aspects for detailed exposition: 'od kyi gnas, lam, yul, lus, spyan, snying po, mtshon dpe, dus, grol sa. The gnas exposition through snying na lhun grub 'od lnga'i thig le kha dog lnga'i dbus na sku lnga yab yum tshom bu'i dkyil 'khor du gnas pa establishes the heart-center bindu as the location of five-kaya mandala. The structural correspondence maps: 'byung ba lnga, phung po lnga, sku lnga, rigs lnga, ye shes lnga, sa lnga onto the single location. The lam through rgyang zhags nas 'byung ba establishes the far-reaching lasso as the pathway.

Continuation of path-trained appearance. The yul through nam mkha' stong pa establishes space as the field. The lus through sku lnga dang ye shes bzhi yar gyi snang ba establishes the light-body as ascending display. The spyan through shes rab rang byung gi sgron mas rang ngo shes nas dbyings la skyod pa establishes self-recognition as the eye. The snying po through kun gsal 'gag med ye shes establishes all-luminous non-cessation as essence. The mtshon dpe through shel dang 'dra preserves the crystal metaphor. The dus establishes both practice-time and bardo-time as occasions for appearance. The grol sa through thog ma'i ka dag rin po che gsang ba'i sbubs la establishes the original purity as liberation-place.

Bardo appearance section. The detailed exposition of snang ba bzhi—tshom bu'i snang ba, ye shes bzhi sbyor gyi snang ba, lhun grub rin po che'i sgo brgyad, ye shes dbyings su 'khyil ba—maps the four bardo stages onto the four activities. The structural function is establishing the temporal-unfolding of spontaneous presence. The color correspondence for each of five lights maps to specific kaya-wisdom-mother-element-aggregate-ground-family: mthing ga to rnam par snang mdzad, chos dbyings ye shes, nam mkha' dbyings phyug ma, nam mkha', gzugs kyi phung po, bya ba rdzogs pa'i sa, de bzhin gshegs pa'i rigs. This pattern repeats for dkar po, ser po, dmar po, ljangs gu with their respective correspondences. Risk: the systematic density requires preservation of each correspondence without collapsing distinctions.

Impurified delusion lights section. The 'od lnga ye shes kyi snang ba 'char ba presents wisdom-light, while ma dag pa'i 'od rang la yod pa la brten nas presents delusion-light. The structural distinction is critical: both arise from the same ground but are recognized or not recognized. The verse citation ma dag 'khrul pa'i 'od la drug, dbang po tha ma'i tha ma la establishes the six delusion-lights appearing at the twenty-first faculty's end. Risk: translation must preserve the distinction between dag pa and ma dag pa without moralizing the delusion-light.

Wisdom essence section. The phrase ye nas 'dus ma byas pa'i shes pa establishes the unconstructed nature of wisdom. The exposition through dbyings rig pa ka dag chos nyid stong pa'i ngang las shar ba ni rig pa rang shar chen po'i rgyud las grounds wisdom in the expanse-awareness original purity. The verse citation kye ma gsang bdag nges par zung, chos min shes rab rang byung ba, chos kun khong nas skye bar 'gyur, de las ye shes 'byung ba ste establishes the self-arising rigpa as the source of wisdom.

Wisdom distinction section. The phrase ye shes lnga po de dri ma dang bcas dus sems can pa'i rgyud kyis bsdus pa na rang bzhin lhun grub kyi ye shes zer establishes the spontaneous presence wisdom when obscured. The dri ma dag pa sangs rgyas kyi dus na rtogs pa mngon gyur 'bras bu'i ye shes establishes the realized wisdom when pure. The verse citation ye shes chen po'i bshad lugs ni, rtogs pa mngon gyur sangs rgyas dang, rang bzhin lhun grub sangs rgyas so presents the twofold distinction. Risk: the rang bzhin rtogs pa distinction must be preserved as mode-of-presence versus mode-of-recognition, not as two different wisdoms.

Five wisdoms common exposition. The enumeration presents: chos dbyings ye shes rtog med, me long ye shes 'gag med gsal, mnyam nyid ye shes ma 'dres rdzogs, so rtog ye shes gong bzhin rtogs, bya grub ye shes chos rnams rdzogs. Each preserves specific qualities: dharma-expanse without thought, mirror without cessation, equalization without distinction, individual discernment as before, all-accomplishing completion. The structural function is establishing the complete wisdom-framework. Risk: each wisdom requires distinct technical translation consistent with tradition.

Definite-word exposition for dharma-expanse wisdom. The chos dbyings ye shes ni stong pa chen po'i yul nyid dang gsal ba 'od kyi snang ba dang ye shes rig pa'i spyod yul gsum establishes threefold field. The de gsum 'dzom pa dbyings zhes bya establishes their convergence as expanse. The dag pa ye shes dbyings nyid and ma dag sems can dbyings su bstan present the pure-impure distinction. Risk: translation must preserve the technical terminology without flattening into generalities.

Definite-word exposition for remaining wisdoms. Me long ye shes through dpe na me long dkyil 'khor la preserves the mirror metaphor while establishing recognition-liberation through ngo sprod nang du shes par bya. Mnyam nyid ye shes through chos rnams mnyam pa'i ngo bo la gang gi phyogs su ma lhung ba establishes non-partisanship. So sor rtog pa'i ye shes through dbang po nyi shu rtsa gcig phyir establishes the twenty-one faculties as basis. Bya grub ye shes through ci snang rig pa'i ngang du rdzogs establishes completion without action. The structural pattern maintains consistency across all five.

Methodological note on translation. The text establishes awareness of exegetical tradition through references to mdo, gsar ma'i rgyud, and pandita traditions. The structural function is acknowledging the interpretive complexity while maintaining confidence in the Dzogchen presentation. The note that rgyud nas 'bru re re bsnan pas rgyud la the tshom du za na could arise establishes awareness of potential confusion from detailed phonetic analysis. The defense of man ngag gi rgyud as go sla establishes the instructional genre's legitimacy. Risk: this meta-commentary requires neutral translation that preserves the epistemic stance without polemic.

Enlightened activity exposition. The 'phrin las kyi rab tu dbye ba presents three aspects: ngo bo, dbye ba, dbye ba nges pa'i tshig bshad pa. The ngo bo through don gnyis lhun gyis rdzogs pa establishes spontaneous completion of twofold benefit. The verse citation 'phrin las kun gyi ye shes ni, bya ba thams cad byed pa yin maintains the wisdom-activity identity. The etymology through 'phrin ni sangs rgyas nyid la brjod, las ni ye shes nyams su len establishes the term's dual semantic ground. The four divisions present: zhi ba, rgyas pa, dbang, drag po. Risk: activity-translation must preserve the technical tantric meanings of these four.

Mandala, mudra, and deity host sections. The dkyil 'khor through ma bris par ye nas bkra ba rang rdzogs rang la yod pa establishes the self-complete mandala. The phyag rgya through ma bsgyur gzhi nas rdzogs pa establishes the unaltered mudra. The lha tshogs through ma bskyed ye rdzogs kyi zhi khro establishes the unproduced deities. The sngags kyi snying po through rtsa gnas yi ge'i 'khor lo establishes the mantra-essence. The verse citations maintain the rang la yod, bzhi la rdzogs, rang gi lus la rdzogs pattern of self-completion. The structural function is establishing that activity-apparatus is not constructed but recognized as spontaneously present.
