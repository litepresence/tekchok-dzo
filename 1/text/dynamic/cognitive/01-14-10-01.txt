Vajra-knowledge as fruit section. First: looking at mind (lta ba)—gazing without moving eyes, maintaining undistracted shamatha on mind's appearances. "View continuous with appearance" (lta ba rgyun)—non-distracted awareness seeing myriad phenomena as dharmata while remaining one. Simile: stars appearing in ocean without disturbing it. All appearances arise from vajra-knowledge yet dharmata remains undifferentiated. Second: error (gol sa)—three errors in practice: grasping appearances as external, grasping mind as internal, grasping duality. Third: non-error (mi gol)—view beyond error, appearance and awareness inseparable. Structural note: this is practical instructions for recognizing vajra-knowledge as fruit. Register: highest Dzogchen pointing-out instruction style.
