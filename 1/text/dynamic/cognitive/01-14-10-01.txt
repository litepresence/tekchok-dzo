Vajra-knowledge as fruit section—practical instructions for recognizing the fruition of practice. First: looking at mind (sems la bltas na)—gazing without moving eyes (mig mi g.yo bar), maintaining undistracted shamatha (ma yengs zhi gnas) on mind's appearances. "View continuous with appearance" (lta snang rgyun chad med)—non-distracted awareness seeing myriad phenomena as dharmata while remaining one. View register: shamatha leading to vipashyana recognition.

[Extended Analysis: Gazing Without Moving Eyes]
Gazing without moving eyes (mig mi g.yo bar) indicates stable attention—not physical staring but mental non-wandering. View register: stable attention as foundation. Translation risk: literal eye movement. Preservation: mig here represents attention—the gaze is directed at mind's nature without distraction. Physical eyes may move or not; the attention doesn't waver.

[Extended Analysis: Undistracted Shamatha on Mind's Appearances]
Maintaining undistracted shamatha (ma yengs zhi gnas) on mind's appearances (sems kyi snang ba)—calm abiding focused on what mind displays. View register: shamatha not blank but focused on appearance. Translation risk: shamatha as empty trance. Preservation: zhi gnas is stability—calm, clear, one-pointed. Here it is maintained on mind's own appearances, not external objects.

[Extended Analysis: View Continuous with Appearance]
"View continuous with appearance" (lta snang rgyun chad med)—the view (lta ba) and appearance (snang ba) are not separate. The view sees appearances as they are, continuously. View register: non-dual view and appearance. Translation risk: "continuous" suggesting duration. Preservation: rgyun chad med means without interruption—view and appearance are never separate. What appears is what is viewed.

[Extended Analysis: Non-Distracted Awareness Seeing Myriad Phenomena]
Non-distracted awareness (ma yengs rig pa) seeing myriad phenomena (sna tshogs chos) as dharmata while remaining one (gcig tu gnas). Many appearances, one awareness. View register: multiplicity within unity. Translation risk: "one" suggesting numerical oneness. Preservation: gcig tu gnas means abiding as one—the awareness remains single while knowing many. Not one instead of many, but one knowing many.

[Extended Analysis: Stars Appearing in Ocean Simile]
Simile: stars appearing in ocean without disturbing it (rgya mtsho la skar ma snang yang 'khrug med). Stars reflect in calm ocean without disturbing the water—likewise phenomena appear in awareness without disturbing its nature. View register: appearance not affecting essence. Translation risk: simile suggesting separation. Preservation: the ocean (awareness) remains undisturbed while reflecting stars (phenomena)—this is simultaneous appearance and emptiness.

[Extended Analysis: All Appearances Arise from Vajra-Knowledge]
All appearances arise from vajra-knowledge (rdo rje ye shes las snang ba thams cad 'byung) yet dharmata remains undifferentiated (chos nyid tha dad med par gnas). View register: appearances as wisdom-display, ground as unchanged. Translation risk: "arise from" suggesting causation. Preservation: 'byung here means manifesting from—not created by, but naturally displaying the nature of. Dharmata is unchanged because it never was different.

[Extended Analysis: Second - Three Errors in Practice]
Second: error (nyes pa)—three errors in practice (nyes pa gsum): grasping appearances as external (phyi rol tu 'dzin pa), grasping mind as internal (nang du 'dzin pa), grasping duality (gnyis su 'dzin pa). These are fundamental errors that obstruct recognition. View register: errors as misapprehensions to be corrected. Translation risk: "errors" suggesting moral failure. Preservation: nyes pa means fault or error—cognitive mistakes, not sins. Grasping internal/external and duality is the root of delusion.

[Extended Analysis: Grasping Appearances as External]
Grasping appearances as external (phyi rol tu 'dzin pa)—the error of taking mind's display as objectively real, existing "out there." View register: reification of appearance as primary error. Translation risk: "external" suggesting spatial location. Preservation: phyi rol means outside or external—taking appearances as existing independently of mind. This is the fundamental error of samsara.

[Extended Analysis: Grasping Mind as Internal]
Grasping mind as internal (nang du 'dzin pa)—the complementary error of taking awareness as a subjective entity, existing "in here." View register: reification of awareness as error. Translation risk: "internal" suggesting location. Preservation: nang means inside—taking awareness as an entity residing somewhere. This creates the subject-object split.

[Extended Analysis: Grasping Duality]
Grasping duality (gnyis su 'dzin pa)—the error of holding internal and external as truly separate, different in nature. View register: dualistic grasping as root of samsara. Translation risk: "duality" as abstract concept. Preservation: gnyis means two—taking subject and object, mind and matter, self and other as truly distinct. This is the root error from which all others grow.

[Extended Analysis: Third - Non-Error Beyond Error]
Third: non-error (nyes med)—view beyond error (nyes pa las 'das pa'i lta ba), appearance and awareness inseparable (snang rig dbyer med). Beyond error doesn't mean correcting errors but transcending the framework where errors are possible. View register: non-error as natural state, not achievement. Translation risk: "beyond" suggesting escape. Preservation: 'das pa means transcending—seeing that error was never truly possible because appearance and awareness were never separate.

[Extended Analysis: Appearance and Awareness Inseparable]
Appearance and awareness inseparable (snang rig dbyer med)—the recognition that what appears and what knows are not two things. View register: non-duality as fact, not theory. Translation risk: "inseparable" suggesting two things stuck together. Preservation: dbyer med means without difference—not two things made one, but never two. Appearance is awareness's display; awareness is appearance's knowing.

[Extended Analysis: Practical Instructions for Recognition]
The structural note identifies this as "practical instructions for recognizing vajra-knowledge as fruit." View register: instructions for direct application, not theory. Translation risk: "fruit" suggesting future result. Preservation: 'bras bu means fruit or result—vajra-knowledge as what manifests when practice matures. But it is also the path and the ground—recognized here and now.

[Extended Analysis: Highest Dzogchen Pointing-Out Style]
The register is "highest Dzogchen pointing-out instruction style"—direct, non-conceptual, immediate. View register: instruction transcending gradual approach. Translation risk: "highest" suggesting hierarchy. Preservation: this is direct pointing-out (ngo sprod)—immediately indicating the nature of mind without gradual buildup. The style is essential Dzogchen.

[Extended Analysis: Vajra-Knowledge as Fruit]
Vajra-knowledge as fruit indicates this is the discriminating wisdom (sor rtog ye shes) fully manifest—not developed but revealed. View register: fruition as recognition, not production. Translation risk: "fruit" suggesting result of cause. Preservation: vajra-knowledge is the nature of mind—it doesn't need to be produced but recognized. The "fruit" is recognition itself.

[Extended Analysis: Shamatha Leading to Vipashyana]
The progression from shamatha (calm abiding) to vipashyana (clear seeing) is implicit—stable attention allows recognition of nature. View register: shamatha as support, vipashyana as recognition. Translation risk: sequential progression. Preservation: while described sequentially, they can be simultaneous—stable mind seeing clearly. The shamatha is not abandoned when vipashyana arises; they are unified.

[Structural Synthesis: Vajra-Knowledge Recognition Framework]
This section (19975-20146) presents the practical instructions for recognizing vajra-knowledge as the fruit of practice. The architecture moves from shamatha practice through recognition of errors to the non-error of inseparable appearance and awareness. The view throughout is that vajra-knowledge is not achieved but recognized—through stable attention on mind's appearances, seeing that they arise from wisdom yet don't disturb dharmata. The translator must preserve the direct pointing-out style while conveying the precision of the instructions. The three errors are clearly identified so they can be recognized and released; the non-error is not another position but the transcendence of the error framework. The stars in ocean simile beautifully captures the relationship—phenomena appearing vividly without disturbing the nature of awareness, like stars reflected in calm water.
