This section presents mind training through the three views of the three kāyas, establishing a systematic approach to transforming ordinary perception into enlightened vision. The structural function moves from the problem—ordinary views do not produce wisdom—through the solution—training in three kāya gazes— to the detailed description of each view and its effects. The integration of tantric sources provides scriptural authority while the practical instructions offer immediate application.

The register operates in Mahāyāna and Dzogchen terminology: three kāyas (sku gsum), three gazes (gzigs stangs), dharmakāya gaze (chos sku'i gzigs stangs), sambhogakāya gaze (longs sku'i gzigs stangs), nirmāṇakāya gaze (sprul sku'i gzigs stangs), three realms (khams gsum), samsara (srid pa), pure realm (zhin khams). The three gazes—downward, sideways, and upward—correspond to the three kāyas and their respective wisdom eyes.

Translation risks center on preserving the specific correlations between gaze direction and kāya without oversimplification. The dharmakāya gaze downward compresses samsara, the sambhogakāya gaze sideways destroys existence's ground, and the nirmāṇakāya gaze downward liberates into Buddha field. These descriptions operate as technical instructions rather than poetic imagery. The three eyes—dharmatā eye, wisdom eye, discriminating eye—must be preserved as distinct technical terms.

The practical application establishes three types of practitioners: lazy ones benefit from sambhogakāya gaze, diligent ones from nirmāṇakāya gaze, and equanimous ones from dharmakāya gaze. This typology acknowledges different capacities while affirming the path's accessibility. The etymological note on "gzigs" as seeing dharmatā and "stangs" as liberating from samsara preserves the Tibetan terminological analysis.

This subsection presents the object crucial points—external and internal expanse objects—establishing the contemplative supports for the three-gaze practice. The structural function moves from external space to internal focus, presenting two complementary approaches. The external expanse object is empty space free from clouds, while the internal is the Brahma aperture between the eyebrows supporting expanse-appearance.

The register maintains spatial terminology: external expanse (phyi'i dbyings), internal expanse (nang gi dbyings), empty space (nam mkha' stong pa), Brahma aperture (tshangs bug), expanse-appearance (dbyings snang), five colors (rnam lnga). The citation from Thalgyur tantra establishes the scriptural basis while describing the practical method of holding external space.

Translation risks center on the distinction between external and internal objects. The external serves as the arising field for awareness, while the internal serves as the field for experience enhancement. The statement that they are non-dual establishes saṃsāra-nirvāṇa mixture ('khor 'das 'dres pa), a technical term indicating their essential unity. The warning that taking coarse elements as objects prevents liberation establishes the need for subtle focus, indicating advanced practice requirements.
