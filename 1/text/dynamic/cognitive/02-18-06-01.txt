[4696-4746]
Mind training: three views of three kayas. Ordinary view doesn't produce wisdom—need to train in three kaya views. Dharmakāya view: seeing samsara as dharmakāya—three realms as enlightened body. Sambhogakāya view: seeing pure realms as sambhogakāya—appearances as luminous. Nirmāṇakāya view: appearance as transformation body—display without grasping. Structural note: three ways of looking correspond to three kayas—training in viewing determines realization. Register: Mahāyāna three-body terminology.
