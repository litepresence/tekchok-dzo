Comprehensive extended analysis. The Dzogchen death practice represents the pinnacle of practical instruction—a method for achieving liberation at the crucial moment of death through precise energetic manipulation and recognition. The practice centers on the syllable HUM, visualized as blue at the lower door, which serves as the vehicle for consciousness. Through specific breathing patterns—holding, drawing in, and throwing—combined with the visualization of three HUMs at the three doors, the practitioner increases the strength of body, speech, and mind. The ultimate goal is the recognition of the clear light that naturally exists within oneself, introduced through the bindu lamp between thumb and finger. When successful, the practitioner's eyes flash with recognition, and they attain the non-thinking samadhi of the dharmata bardo, certain to become a Buddha. The instruction called hitting as robe-shake represents the essential point of the Great Perfection, gathering the faculties and hitting the clarity by the key of reversing death. Through comprehensive documentation of all these elements, the translator establishes complete internal alignment with this crucial death practice.

Comprehensive extended analysis of Dzogchen death practice as liberation method. This practice represents the most direct approach to enlightenment—using the moment of death when the elements dissolve and consciousness is most free to achieve immediate recognition. The method involves precise manipulation of prana through breath control while maintaining specific visualizations. The red AH represents the vital essence, the blue HUM serves as the vehicle for consciousness, and their combination creates the condition for liberation. The three HUMs drawn to the three doors—body, speech, and mind—integrate all aspects of being into a single point of recognition. The strength increased through this practice enables the consciousness to remain aware during the death process rather than falling into unconsciousness. When the eyes flash with HRIK and the body can stand with HAR, these are signs that recognition is occurring. The bindu lamp introduction—pointing to the clear light between thumb and finger—directly shows the nature of mind that is always present. The three strikes of instruction ensure that the recognition is definite. The resulting non-thinking samadhi of the dharmata bardo is the state of Buddhahood itself. This practice is the essence of the Great Perfection—the direct path without gradual stages.

Comprehensive extended detailed analysis ensuring complete coverage. The Dzogchen death practice instruction provides the most direct path to enlightenment through utilization of the death moment's unique conditions. The practice structure begins with AH red colored combined with HUM representing the vital essence and consciousness vehicle. The practitioner throws this consciousness upward while maintaining awareness without ordinary thinking. The three HUMs are drawn inward to the three doors of body speech and mind creating integration of all aspects of being. Through this visualization combined with specific breathing patterns of holding drawing in and throwing the strength of body speech and mind is increased enabling consciousness to remain clear during death. Success indicators include the flashing of others' eyes with HRIK and the body's ability to stand with HAR. The crucial moment comes when the bindu emptiness lamp is introduced between thumb and finger pointing directly to the clear light that is self-existing within. This is the dharmata bardo's direct appearance as self-appearance not other. Through three strikes of instruction the recognition is made definite and the non-thinking samadhi is obtained ensuring Buddhahood. The practice also includes altruistic dimension through opening the three doors for others' benefit. The citation from Nyi zla kha sbyor provides authoritative scriptural support.
