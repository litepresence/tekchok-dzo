Dzogchen death practice introduces consciousness transference method through AH red combined with HUM throwing visualization. Initial stage establishes colored syllables as energetic vehicles. Red AH represents vital essence; HUM serves as consciousness vehicle. Final throwing phase executed without ordinary conceptual engagement—direct energetic projection beyond discursive thought. Tshur gyi gsum ka involves drawing three HUMs inward to three doors: body, speech, and mind. This visualization setup creates integration of all aspects of being into single point of recognition. Practice framework establishes essential structure for death moment liberation.

HUM visualization technical precision: awareness visualized as blue HUM drawn to own rigpa; speech HUM drawn to lower door. Body, speech, and mind—three doors—are strengthened through this practice. Breath and HUM coordination increases body-speech-mind strength. Drawn with HUM HUM: consciousness drawn inside through specific energetic manipulation. At that time, other's wind—hot and cold—enters own interior. Result certainty established: success indicators demonstrate effective practice application.

Eye recognition marks crucial transition: that time, other's eyes coming HRIK—flash of recognition. Then body able to stand HAR—signs of successful energetic manipulation. Having arisen thus, eye thusness shown. Dharmata bardo direct appearance manifests. Thigle introduction: eye HAR arisen, bindu emptiness lamp appears. Thumb and finger introduction method points directly to nature. Clear light self-existing in self revealed. This now: when exiting body, dharmata bardo's self-appearance manifests—not other, but own nature. Essence pointing direct recognition.

Recognition instruction: self-recognize through three times struck—definitive pointing. Seeing that appearance, hearing that instruction. Voice emerging: good sign. Sign arisen: also struck—confirmation signs establish recognition. Dharmata bardo non-thinking samadhi obtained. Certain: becoming Buddha. Result assurance through direct recognition. Nyi zla kha sbyor citation provides authoritative scriptural support. Compassion and benefit extension: if performing others' benefit, compassion grasping self. Three doors opened. Breath held, drawn, thrown. Three syllables inserted for altruistic extension.

Practice repetition develops stability: doing again and again, appearance becomes thus. If body strength obtained, bestow instructions. Consciousness clear, place equally. Progressive development establishes capacity. Faculty doors and eye thusness: doors of faculties in own presence. Eye thusness placed looking. Equal remaining mind arises. Non-thinking samadhi obtained—complete practice realization.

Hitting instruction called tshang sprugs—robe-shake method. Great Perfection essential point. Gathering faculties, hitting clarity. Key of reversing death—critical method. Comprehensive practice summary: AH red HUM throwing, three HUMs drawing in, strength increase certainty, eye recognition liberation, thigle introduction essence, three strikes recognition, samadhi Buddha result. Death practice importance: time of death crucial juncture. Practice determines outcome. Recognition brings liberation; non-recognition leads to continuation.

Altruistic dimension integrates self and others: self-benefit through recognition, others' benefit through compassion. Both integrated. Opening three doors enables benefit for others. Technical precision: HUM color blue, location lower door, breath specific pattern, visualization clear and precise. Result certainty: wind entering influences other, eye recognition self-liberates, samadhi Buddha certain.

Practice integration: AH initial, HUM main practice, thigle recognition, samadhi result—all together complete path. Contemporary relevance: ancient method maintains timeless application. Modern death same process; practice remains effective. Recognition still essential. Final summary: death practice complete instructions, three doors opened, recognition achieved, liberation certain. Ultimate pointing: practice points to nature, nature beyond practice, recognition already present, liberation already complete.

Closing dedication extends benefit: may practice benefit beings, may death be liberation, may all recognize nature, may all be freed. Death practice represents pinnacle of practical instruction—method for achieving liberation at crucial moment of death through precise energetic manipulation and recognition. Practice centers on syllable HUM, visualized as blue at lower door, serving as consciousness vehicle. Through specific breathing patterns—holding, drawing in, throwing—combined with visualization of three HUMs at three doors, practitioner increases strength of body, speech, and mind.

Ultimate goal: recognition of clear light naturally existing within oneself, introduced through bindu lamp between thumb and finger. Successful practice indicated by eyes flashing recognition, attaining non-thinking samadhi of dharmata bardo, certain Buddhahood. Tshang sprugs—hitting as robe-shake—represents Great Perfection essential point: gathering faculties, hitting clarity, key of reversing death. This practice provides direct path without gradual stages.

Extended analysis of death moment energetic dissolution sequence. Earth element dissolves: body becomes heavy, limbs lose strength, mirage-like vision appears. Water dissolves: fluids dry, mouth and nose constrict, smoke-like vision. Fire dissolves: warmth recedes from extremities, consciousness unclear, fireflies vision. Air dissolves: breath ceases, consciousness vacillates, butter-lamp vision. Finally consciousness dissolves into clear light: all appearance ceases, autumn sky vision dawns. Death practice enables recognition at each stage.

Detailed technical precision on AH HUM symbolism. AH represents unborn nature, red color, fire element, heart center. HUM represents enlightened mind, blue color, space element, lower door. Combined they embody union of bliss and emptiness. AH drawn upward, HUM thrown upward—consciousness propelled through crown aperture. Specific visualization: AH red, five-pronged, radiating light; HUM blue, single-pointed, consciousness vehicle. Colors, shapes, locations precisely encode energetic transformation.

Comprehensive analysis of phowa practice variations. Immediate transference for accomplished practitioners: consciousness exits immediately at death. Transference at recognition of signs: practitioner waits for dissolution signs then applies method. Transference through blessing: guru's power enables liberation without personal accomplishment. Three capacities—sharp, medium, dull—determine which method appropriate. This text presents method for sharp capacity: immediate recognition without intermediate stages.

Extended preservation requirements for death practice terminology. 'Chi ba—death—requires distinction from ordinary death; this is opportunity for recognition. 'Chi bslu—death deception—practice of turning death into path. 'Pho ba—transference—consciousness movement to pure realm. Srog rlung—life-wind—vital energy supporting consciousness. Tshe lo—life span—determines practice timing. Dbyings klong—expanse—deathless nature recognized at death. Each term carries precise technical meaning within subtle body system.

Final comprehensive analysis of death practice as Dzogchen essence. All Dzogchen practice culminates at death moment. Ground—nature already pure. Path—recognition of that purity. Result—no change from ground. Death practice epitomizes this: consciousness most free at death, recognition liberates immediately. Preparation through life enables death recognition. Practice with others extends benefit. Scripture confirms method. Everything converges: ground, path, result; view, meditation, conduct; self, other—complete integration at death moment.

Extended analysis of three doors—body, speech, mind—integration in death practice. Body door: visualization of HUM at crown, navel, heart centers. Speech door: mantra recitation coordinates with breath, sound merges with wind. Mind door: recognition of clear light nature. When three doors opened simultaneously, complete liberation achieved. Strengthening three doors during life enables integration at death. This triadic structure reflects three-kaya principle in practical application.

Detailed examination of HRIK and HAR signs. HRIK—flash in eyes—indicates consciousness recognizing nature. HAR—body standing—shows vitality of recognition. These signs confirm successful practice, not merely physiological phenomena. HRIK represents wisdom aspect, sudden insight. HAR represents means aspect, sustained capacity. Together they indicate complete integration of wisdom and means at death moment.

Comprehensive analysis of thigle introduction method. Bindu between thumb and finger points to clear light always present. External bindu introduces internal bindu. Physical gesture triggers recognition. This pointing—ngo sprod—direct transmission beyond words. Three times struck ensures definiteness, removes doubt. Recognition once established cannot be lost. Thigle as lamp illuminates nature, dispels darkness of ignorance.

Extended preservation requirements for death practice authenticity. Lineage transmission essential: method learned from qualified master, not merely text. Personal practice required: method applied during life, not just known intellectually. Signs recognized: practitioner learns to identify success indicators. Compassion integrated: self-liberation extended to others. These four—lineage, practice, signs, compassion—ensure authentic application.

Final comprehensive synthesis. Death practice represents Dzogchen path condensed: view recognizes clear light, meditation maintains awareness, conduct benefits others, result is Buddhahood. AH red and HUM blue embody method. Three HUMs integrate three doors. Breath control manipulates prana. Signs indicate success. Thigle points to nature. Three strikes establish recognition. Samadhi is result. All elements form complete liberation method at death moment.

Extended analysis of breath control patterns in death practice. Holding—breath retained at lower door, consciousness stabilized. Drawing—inward movement gathers dispersed energies. Throwing—upward propulsion through crown aperture. Each phase precisely timed with visualization: hold with AH, draw with HUM, throw with combined force. Pattern repeated until appearance stabilizes, signs manifest. Breath becomes vehicle for consciousness, prana carrier of recognition.

Detailed examination of altruistic practice mechanics. For others' benefit, practitioner opens own three doors, extends recognition outward. Other's consciousness influenced through energetic connection. HRIK flash in other's eyes indicates successful contact. This demonstrates Dzogchen's integration of Mahayana compassion—liberation not private achievement but shared blessing. Technical precision required: compassion must be genuine, not merely wishful thinking; recognition must be stable, not forced.
