Clear light meditation: resting in AH syllable clarity, allowing focus to dissolve without following thoughts. Clear, pure, open awareness remains—half-clear, half-empty, appearing naturally without fabrication. Rest without suppressing or encouraging what arises. Direct experience requires diligent practice.

Transference ('pho ba) three types by practitioner capacity: superior from clear light, intermediate from illusory body, lesser from body-speech. Distinctions reflect awareness-vitality (blo rtsal) levels, not destinations. Recognition capacity determines transition quality.

Clear light mastered: awareness departs Brahma aperture into dharmadhātu. Illusory body mastered: departs into dharmatā divine body, mastering bardo illusory body, achieving awakening. Neither mastered: body, speech, mind depart with channels and winds through Brahma aperture.

Body-speech transference: with support (channels, winds, sound, craft, illusory arts) and without support (mind's familiarity power alone). Brahma aperture as pathway. Vajra Seat citation: upper nine apertures projection carries liberation certainty.

Severe transgressions reference functions as hyperbolic affirmation of practice's power, not ethical instruction. Transference transcends heaviest karmic patterns when accomplished properly.

Union-bardo instructions: union crucial point realized in this life, actual guidance for bardo. Four bardos: birth-death, dream, dharmatā, existence. Encompass full transitional range.

Developmental progression: practitioner may begin body-speech, progress to illusory body, stabilize clear light. Thalgyur citation confirms threefold structure by sense faculties (dbang po). Destination same: dharmatā recognition. Manner of arrival differs.
