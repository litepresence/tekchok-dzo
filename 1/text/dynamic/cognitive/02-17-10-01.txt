This section presents the completion stage practices of clear light meditation followed by the three types of transference (phowa), establishing the transition from formal meditation to the practices of death and intermediate states. The structural function moves from the experience of clear light—where even the clear AH dissolves into clarity without other thoughts arising—to the threefold classification of transference based on capacity rather than destination.

The register operates in completion stage terminology: clear AH (a gsal ba), clear and lucid appearance (gsal dangs phyed pa 'char ba), transference ('pho ba), clear light ('od gsal), illusory body (sgyu lus), body-speech (lus ngag). The crucial point that transference depends on three capacities of awareness-vitality (blo rtsal gsum) rather than three destinations establishes a significant doctrinal distinction. Some correlate the three transferences with different destinations, but this is considered different.

Translation risks center on the technical distinction between transference types. The description of clear light transference—at death releasing awareness from the Brahma aperture into the dharmadhātu—requires precise anatomical and metaphysical terminology. The illusory body transference—projecting awareness from the illusory body state into the dharmatā divine body, mastering the intermediate state illusory body and becoming enlightened—presents a complex sequence that must maintain its technical integrity.

The final option—body-speech-mind transference for those who have not mastered the first two—establishes the foundational practice accessible to all. The citation from Thalgyur tantra confirms the three types based on sense faculties, with clear light, illusory body, and body-speech-mind as the categories. The structural preservation of these options as developmental rather than merely alternative paths maintains the instructional logic.

This subsection addresses the crucial point of the Brahma aperture as the pathway for transference, citing the Vajra Seat tantra for authority. The structural function establishes the anatomical basis for the practice while acknowledging its profound implications. The verses describe projecting from the nine apertures' upper aspect, with the immediate mental transference carrying the certainty of liberation even for those who have committed the five immediate transgressions.

The register maintains transference terminology: Brahma aperture (tshangs bug), pathway (lam), nine apertures (bu ga dgu), projecting ('pho byed), immediate transgressions (mtshams med lnga), certainty of liberation (grol 'gyur). The authoritative citation establishes the practice's efficacy while the warning about severe transgressions indicates the power of the technique.

Preservation requires maintaining the relationship between anatomical location and soteriological result without reducing the practice to mere mechanism. The reference to killing brahmins and committing the five immediate transgressions serves as a hyperbolic affirmation of the practice's power rather than ethical instruction. This must be preserved without either over-literalizing or dismissing the traditional expression.

This passage details the two types of body-speech transference: with support through channels and wind, and without support through mind's focus alone. The structural function presents these as alternatives based on practitioner capacity, with the citation from Thalgyur tantra establishing the theoretical basis. The first type involves training through wind purification using sound, craft, and illusory arts, harmonizing individual elements internally through body-speech-mind focus.

The register operates in transference technical terminology: with support (rten can), channels and wind (rtsa rlung), dependent arising (rten 'brel), without support (rten med), mind's focus (sems kyi dmigs pa), actual transference (dngos su 'pho ba), non-actual transference (dngos med kyis 'pho ba), wind purification (rlung gi sbyang ba).

Translation risks center on preserving the distinction between the two approaches while acknowledging their shared goal. The description of training through sound, craft, and illusory arts suggests preparatory practices that develop the capacity for transference. The final note on demonstrating mind's habituation strength (sems kyi goms stobs) indicates that even without elaborate preparation, mental familiarity can accomplish the result.

[3345-3353]

This concluding section transitions to the union-bardo instructions, presenting two aspects: the union crucial point realized through practice in this life, and the actual bardo guidance. The structural function introduces the bardo topic while distinguishing between bardo of birth and death, dream bardo, dharmatā bardo, and existence bardo as the four categories relevant to the current context.

The register maintains bardo terminology: union (zung 'jug), bardo guidance (bar do'i gdams pa), bardo of birth and death (skye shi bar do), dream bardo (rmi lam bar do), dharmatā bardo (chos nyid bar do), existence bardo (srid pa bar do). The fourfold classification establishes a comprehensive framework for understanding the intermediate states.

Preservation requires maintaining the relationship between transference and bardo practices as integrated rather than sequential. The mention that while there are many bardos, these four are relevant to current needs indicates practical pedagogy rather than theoretical limitation. The transition to detailed instructions on these bardos will complete the presentation of the completion stage practices.
