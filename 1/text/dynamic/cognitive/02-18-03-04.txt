[4428-4467]
Four dharma aspects and three gates of liberation. Four dharma: external appearances exhausted (phyi rol), internal time exhausted (nang gi dus), secret space exhausted (gsang ba'i nam dka'), unsurpassed (bla na med) - beyond all limitation. Gate of body: three ways of sitting—lion, elephant, rishi—representing three kayas. Gate of speech: silence like sleeping—cutting conceptual chatter. Gate of mind: cutting all mental fabrications. Body postures represent dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya—three bodies in one sitting. Structural note: connects body-speech-mind practice to three kayas.
