The four dharma aspects provide support and foundation for practitioners, establishing complete path structure through fourfold organization. Without familiarity with these essential points, practice does not reach completion; therefore the tradition speaks of four dharma sections. The citation from Palri Tshegpa tantra establishes authority: "Those desiring familiarity with manifest essential points, the essential point divides into four sections." The structural function introduces the fourfold framework organizing complete path. The view register presents four aspects as comprehensive coverage, not stages to progress through. Translation risk: treating four dharma as sequential stages rather than complete mandala of practice; or conflating the four aspects with other fourfold structures (empowerments, wheels, wisdoms, lamps). Preservation requires maintaining the specific four: external appearances exhausted, internal time exhausted, secret space exhausted, unsurpassed base-emptiness—and their specific correlations to empowerments, channels, wisdoms, and lamps.

The three gates of liberation establish practical method: body postures representing Three Kayas, speech as silence cutting conceptual chatter, mind cutting all fabrications. Body gate: three ways of sitting—lion (strength, dharmakāya), elephant (stability, saṃbhogakāya), rishi (suppleness, nirmāṇakāya)—demonstrating how single body contains all three bodies. Speech gate: silence like sleeping, cutting conceptual proliferation and verbal elaboration. Mind gate: cutting all mental fabrications, conceptual constructions, and discursive activity. The structural function connects body-speech-mind practice to Three Kayas in unified framework. The view register presents gates as entry points to recognition, not techniques to master. Translation risk: treating postures as physical exercises, silence as mere absence of speech, mental cutting as repression—missing their function as recognition supports. Preservation priority: the body postures specifically represent dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya—Three Kayas present in single sitting, not sequential achievements. This identity must remain explicit as the organizing principle of the practice.
