[14588]
First: recognition. Structural marker for bardo recognition sequence beginning. View register: bardo phenomenology—first of four progressive moments. Translation: preserve ngos zin (recognition), dang po (first) ordinal. Note: in fruition context, recognition indicates deeper realization than initial pointing-out. Translation risk: treating ngos zin as merely intellectual understanding misses the decisive (nges pa) character. Preservation: the ordinal sequence (first, second, third, fourth) indicates developmental dimension of bardo awareness.
