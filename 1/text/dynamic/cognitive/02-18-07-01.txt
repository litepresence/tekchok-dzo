[4747-4915]
View (lta ba) training in Dzogchen. First: not wanting appearances to arise—when appearances cease, even coarse phenomena don't appear—then spacious awareness appears. Space-like view: recognizing awareness as empty like space. Equality view: seeing subject and object as equal—non-dual. Non-conceptual view: beyond mental fabrication. These views correspond to different stages: space-like view cuts clinging, equality view cuts discrimination, non-conceptual view rests naturally. Structural note: multiple view types correspond to different aspects of Dzogchen realization. Register: highest Dzogchen view terminology (lta ba, mthong ba, etc.).
