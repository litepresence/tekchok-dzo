Structural function: Opening of view training section with the paradox of "not wanting appearances to arise." The structural framing establishes non-conceptual view as foundation while acknowledging that deliberate non-arising is itself a concept. The resolution lies in recognition rather than rejection.

View register: Appearances as self-liberated without deliberate rejection. The key phrase "empty-clear without thought-experience arises from within" indicates that recognition emerges naturally when fixation relaxes, not through aversion to appearance. The sky-space view (nam mkha') serves as primary metaphor—expanse without boundary, awareness without limit.

Translation risk: "Not wanting" (mi 'dod) risks interpretation as aversion or suppression. The Tibetan indicates non-grasping rather than rejection. The instruction to "place empty awareness toward empty sky" could be read as dualistic meditation—subject placing awareness toward object—rather than recognizing awareness-sky non-duality.

Preservation: Multiple canonical citations establish authority: Samten Mikyopa on yogin abiding in sky-space; Sutrapitaka on examining meaning in empty sky; Yum Barma on prajnaparamita meditation as sky-space yoga. These citations anchor the practice in canonical tradition while emphasizing its non-conceptual nature. The result—"expanse and awareness without duality"—is the view's essential point.

Structural function: Wind-rigpa key point section providing practical instruction for maintaining view. The structural movement from view to method follows the standard presentation sequence. Wind as the vehicle of mind receives detailed technical instruction.

View register: Wind (rlung) as subtle energy serving as support for rigpa recognition. When wind becomes gentle and slow, rigpa can be directly seen. The threefold benefit structure: externally extends life, internally causes conceptions to cease, secretly makes rigpa directly visible. This establishes wind practice as simultaneously health, mental calming, and recognition support.

Translation risk: Wind risks reduction to physiological breath rather than subtle energy. The phrase "releasing far outward and holding externally" (phyir rgyang ring po 'phren zhing phyir bzung la gzhag pa) requires technical precision—this is not breath retention but energy balancing.

Preservation: The Talgyur citations establish canonical foundation: "Wind made gentle... body and mind connection severed... not reversing three realms." The repetition of verses emphasizes stability. Wind and rigpa gentle accomplish wisdom; wind and awareness separate, eliminating coming-going—this is rigpa arriving at its own nature. The practical instruction specifies five to six days initially, then door-opening practice, then object-searching for six to seven days, then direct immediate self-liberation.

Structural function: Rigpa key point—coil of joy in expanse. This section provides the precise technique for view stabilization through the "coil of joy" (lu gu rgyud) metaphor. The structural placement after wind instruction indicates progression from coarse to subtle.

View register: Rigpa placed as unmoving coil within the expanse. The metaphor suggests both stability (coiled) and joy (natural radiance). Wind gentle leads to freedom from activity; rigpa coil placed on the letter "a" leads to exhaustion of conceptual source. This is recognition stabilization, not concentration achievement.

Translation risk: "Coil of joy" as metaphor rather than technical term risks losing precision. The Tibetan lu gu rgyud is a specific technical term in Dzogchen phenomenology referring to the way rigpa naturally coheres without fixation. The letter "a" refers to the unborn syllable, not the grapheme.

Preservation: Canonical citations from Talgyur ("Self-face rigpa coil of joy, held in sky through freedom from coming-going") and Tenbu ("Coil of joy within expanse, established separately without separating") establish terminology authority. The process: wind gentle produces freedom from activity in continuum; rigpa coil on "a" exhausts conceptual source; delusion returns to ground; wisdom mother and son meet. The experiential markers are precise—when recognition separates from wind, coming-going ceases; this is rigpa naturally arriving.

Structural function: Direct introduction of rigpa's own face—the culminating view section with direct pointing language. The structural function is recognition-triggering rather than information-providing. The prose builds to the recognition moment.

View register: Rigpa as diamond coil of joy, golden thread hovering in sky—metaphors for recognition's natural coherence and luminous continuity. This is unfabricated buddhahood, primordial Samantabhadra, spontaneously self-arisen. The meeting face-to-face with wisdom of arising prajna establishes recognition as encounter rather than understanding.

Translation risk: The poetic descriptions (golden thread, hovering in sky, five-colored light) risk being read as visualizations to be fabricated rather than phenomenological descriptions of recognition. "Ordinary mind arriving at buddhahood" could be misinterpreted as deluded mind becoming enlightened rather than recognition of natural purity.

Preservation: The technical descriptions are precise: rigpa as unconfused primordial purity (ka dag) spontaneously self-arisen (lhun grub) own-display (rang gdangs). This is not poetic ornament but phenomenological accuracy. The progression: recognition habits reach measure, liberates with coarse matter into light; if not reaching measure, intermediate state or natural manifestation field traversed; six realms of delusion's abyss crossed. The citations from Rangjung and Talgyur seal the recognition with canonical authority.

Structural function: Appearance arising from that—light display progression. The structural function demonstrates how appearances arise when view stabilizes, providing phenomenological roadmap for practitioner recognition. The progression from external to internal to secret to suchness establishes comprehensive framework.

View register: Appearances as rigpa display, not external phenomena. The progression: expanse's five-colored own-display swaying (db ying 'od lnga'i rang gdangs lang ling du snang ba), bindus connecting with coil (thig le phra mos 'brel ba), first white-copper-colored star-like scattering (dkar zang zing skar ma 'phro ba lta bu), then bindus five-colored (thig le kha dog lnga ldan), individual and triple connected (re re ba dang sum sbrel). These describe actual phenomenology, not visualization.

Translation risk: Light and bindu descriptions risk being read as visualizations to construct rather than natural phenomena to recognize. The numerical precision (four appearances) requires contextual explanation—why four, not three or five?

Preservation: The four appearances correspond to: external—moon-sun four times' waxing-waning; internal—body-speech-mind-mind fourfold binding liberation; secret—four empowerments' definite display; suchness—four lamps' appearance definiteness. The sequence is determined: first dharma-nature direct appearance provides basis for remaining three. Without first, no basis for others; with first, self-arisen wisdom found from self; if not experienced, merely words without result; when experienced, experience increases.

Structural function: Detailed exposition of the four appearances' definite number, sequence, and individual characteristics. The structural thoroughness ensures comprehensive understanding of the light display phenomenology.

View register: Experience reaching measure requires stabilization. Without stabilization, experience has no limit, no dharma engagement, no buddhahood cause. When experience stabilizes at measure, rigpa appearance reaching measure manifests. Even when rigpa appearance reaches measure, if it does not transform beyond that, there is no difference from common vehicles hoping for result from apparent characteristics.

Translation risk: "Measure" (tshad) and "reaching measure" (tshad phebs) risk being read as quantitative achievement rather than qualitative recognition. "Appearance dissolving into ground" could be interpreted as nihilistic cessation rather as recognition of ground-display unity.

Preservation: The four appearances correspond to three kayas: first two as nirmanakaya, measure-reaching as sambhogakaya, exhaustion as dharmakaya. These are path-appearances, not result-achievements. When made into path, result arrives at exhausted ka dag expanse—self-appearance's potency kayas dissolve into rigpa nature. This is called "king of vehicles' intention"—the heart essence not even heard of in other vehicles. The point is difficult to realize because it transcends conventional cause-effect frameworks.
