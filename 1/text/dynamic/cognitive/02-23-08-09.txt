Structural function: Liberation through primordial purity presentation for medium faculties. The interval between liberation and dissolution—emanations continue to display. The temporal framework: day of emanation equivalent to one day of meditative concentration, five instants correlated with each day. View register: Dzogchen bardo cosmology with precise temporal mapping. Translation risk: Literalizing the temporal framework misses its pedagogical function—days and instants are not objective measures but recognition intervals. Preservation: The correlation between emanation display and meditative time must remain clear.

Extended recognition of the various liberation modes for medium faculties: liberation into Expanse of Five Lights, Five Bodies, through Five Spheres, Expanse of Mirror, Expanse of Periphery, through upper and lower spheres, into empty periphery. The seven-day framework—five days in appearances of spheres, one day in Dharma-Expanse, one day in Mirror-Like Jnana—establishes progressive recognition. From heart center single body emerges, then bodies without number emanate. Awareness empowered like shooting star, emanation able to accomplish benefit on twenty-sixth day. Recognition: These are not literal timelines but recognition intervals—the time it takes to recognize depends entirely on familiarity and habituation. The "day" in bardo is not twenty-four hours but a period of recognition or non-recognition.

Overall structural recognition: This section presents the bardo liberation process for medium faculties—those who have some practice but not full stability. The detailed temporal framework serves pedagogical function: it gives practitioners a map of what to expect and how to recognize. The recognition required is that these "days" and "instants" are not objective temporal units but intervals of recognition—what appears as "five days" could be a moment of recognition or an eternity of wandering, depending on the mind's capacity. The translator must preserve both the systematic precision of the framework and the understanding that it describes recognition intervals, not objective time.
