Entering awareness into light. When awareness enters light by looking outward at self-appearance, resting in state of knowing appearances as self-appearance. When appearances dissolve like light rays into own heart center—this is entering awareness into light. Through recognizing own face as self-place of primordial purity, ground obtained in that state and directly penetrated—no appearances thereafter. Awareness is own nature while light shines upon those outer self-appearances. Structural note: Dzogchen technique for recognizing rigpa at death.
