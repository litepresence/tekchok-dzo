[10471]
Dzogchen ground introduction. Dang po—first—marks transition to basis exposition. Gzhi rang bzhin gyis rnam par dag pa'i dbyings—expanse of primordially pure ground nature—don dam pa'i bden pa—ultimate truth. Gsang sngags rdo rje'i gnas—Secret Mantra vajra place—dka' ba lhun gyis grub pa'i dkyil 'khor—spontaneously present mandala difficult to access. Ngo bo bstan pa—revealing essence—as two aspects: general sevenfold presentation and detailed supreme ground explanation. Structural function: establish ground as both empty (ka dag) and spontaneously manifest (lhun grub). Translation risk: flattening into mere emptiness or mere appearance—preserve paradox.
