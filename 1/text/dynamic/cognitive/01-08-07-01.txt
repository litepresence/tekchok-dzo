First section establishing non-dual ground of primordial purity and unceasing display. Critical examination of objections: if essence purely primordial purity without display, samsara would not arise from purity—problem; if nature merely display without purity, liberation without recognition follows. Resolution: essence primordially pure so sentient beings do not ultimately exist—display as mere play does not contradict purity. Dream metaphor: horses and oxen appear to dreamer without contradicting sleep emptiness. Yogi perception: through mantra power, appearances manifest as liberation. Child's ball simile: spontaneous reversion without effort. Two truths analysis: conventional aspect shows unceasing display with qualities; ultimate aspect is beyond language. Vow-holder and fully ordained non-contradiction example. Six Expanses citation confirms: essence primordially pure, stains exhausted; nature unceasing display with qualities. Dialogue structure between teacher and bodhisattva clarifies apparent contradictions. Register is highest Dzogchen view—non-dual ground beyond conceptual extremes. Risk: reifying essence-nature as two things loses non-dual import. Preservation: must maintain non-assertive syntax throughout.

Second section: unsurpassed basis particularly explained. Three parts: brief presentation of essential nature; elaborate explanation from aspects of essence and nature; meaning gathering establishing complete view. First part: beginning basis of all—essence primordially pure like unstained conch; nature spontaneously accomplished not established as thing or mark; inside white mandala with subtle self-light as depth-clarity, not appearing to deluded perception because conditions do not exist. Outside: limitless, unobstructed, youth vase body abides as state of reality itself. Because essence is primordially pure: empty of inherent existence, yet subtle awareness with primordial resonance and self-light not restricted by conditions, naturally self-possessed. Because nature is spontaneously accomplished: although abiding as arise-base of all appearances, in its own face outwardly clear, light-body-color with limiting marks not appearing as real. Inside vast expanse of primordial purity, primordial resonance, depth-clarity, subtle self-light, pristine cognition—one in essence. Youth vase body (gzhon nu bum pa) as actual state of reality. Register remains highest Dzogchen description. Risk: literalizing youth vase body as form loses nature-aspect. Preservation: must hold essence-nature-cleanness triad as non-dual.
