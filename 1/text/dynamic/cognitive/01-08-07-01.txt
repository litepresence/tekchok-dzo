[10782-10785]
First section establishing debate. Objection: if primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous accomplishment (lhun grub) have faults individually, then if essence is primordial purity, samsara never having existed, sentient beings' delusion arising is illogical; if nature is spontaneous accomplishment, all would be liberated without effort; primordial purity and spontaneous accomplishment would be contradictory in a single ground. View register: objections to be addressed through non-dual understanding. Translation risk: objections appearing as refutations of Dzogchen rather than logical challenges.

[10786-10794]
Response: essence primordially pure so sentient beings have no samsara, yet spontaneous accomplishment's display as mere play appearing thus is not contradictory. Like sleep going and sleep-time awareness's own face having no dream, yet appearing as horses and oxen not contradictory. Also sentient beings' appearance as magical play not established in meaning's essence so primordially liberated, yet conventionally appearing as liberated horses and oxen through mantra power in eye, effortlessly placed in own place naturally abiding like child's ball returning, liberated into expanse when appearing liberated, merely deluded appearance reversing, nothing newly arisen liberation since bondage not established.

[10795-10799]
Also appearing aspect conventionally spontaneous accomplishment, empty aspect ultimately primordial purity, merely expressed in words, these two not different in substance so not transforming separately, essence one with different exclusions not differentiating as different, like vow-holder and fully ordained not contradictory. View register: two truths as perspectives not separate realities. Preservation: snang ba and stong pa indivisible.

[10800-10829]
Their debate response from Six Expanses: essence primordially pure so sentient beings' samsara not logical, ignorance stains exhausted, teacher spoke thus great bodhisattva. Nature spontaneously accomplished so unceasing play appears. Bodhisattva again asked: if nature spontaneously accomplished, these sentient beings should self-liberate, since primordially spontaneously accomplished. Spoke: these sentient beings since essence primordially pure, liberated ones also appear as play. Bodhisattva again asked: if essence primordially pure, spontaneous accomplishment unnecessary, or since spontaneously accomplished, primordial purity would not exist. Teacher spoke regarding abiding: since no words expressing, expressing sounds devoid of words, since no establishment as any essence, words have no harm to this. Sentient beings self-grasping mind's object, various memories not ceasing, word-harm essence no difference, ultimate conventional term merely.

[10830-10833]
Second topic: unsurpassed basis particularly explained has three: common brief presentation, individual parts elaborate explanation, meaning gathering.

[10834-10846]
First: beginning basis essence primordially pure like conch unstained, not established as thing or mark, spontaneously accomplished nature, white inside with subtle self-light as depth-clarity, though conditions not existing so not appearing outward. Outside limitless unobstructed youth vase body abides as actual state of reality. Essence primordially pure so empty, yet thing not existing subtle awareness primordial resonance self-light not restricted, naturally self-possessed. Nature spontaneously accomplished so abiding as arise-base of all appearances, own face outwardly clear, light body color with limiting marks not appearing. Essence primordial purity's expanse nature spontaneous accomplishment's primordial resonance depth-clarity subtle self-light pristine cognition possessing, one and different and not individual manner luminous unsurpassed spontaneous accomplishment precious cavity, youth vase body field, essence nature compassion three's nature unsurpassed abiding.

[10847-10928]
Essence empty not established as thing or mark. Nature clear primordial resonance appearance's own face not abandoned. Compassion awareness knowing wisdom expanded unceasing arise-base abiding. Auspicious beautiful great tantra: realized Buddha not arisen, unrealized sentient being not arisen before, awareness self-arisen wisdom not moved from ground, conditions not existing three appearances simultaneously abiding. Then also awareness wisdom itself this abiding mode's actual state spoke. Hey great appearance vast expanse this unmoved Dharma-body great not deluded Buddha great abiding. Essence body not ceasing abiding, essence not changing, method secret, unmoved, not moving, not disturbed, all appearances complete simultaneously, all wisdom momentarily complete, all bodies matured abiding, all light appearances unobscured clear, actual state's appearance, unobscured appearance mode essence nature compassion three uninterrupted complete great. Essence actual state great also body as abiding, nose eye ear desire not abiding, empty as abiding pressed-empty as not abiding, five lights great appearance, color dividing not abiding, uninterrupted appearance relation not abiding, centerless limitless appearing direction, direction pointing not abiding, part-touching appearance dividing not abiding, not ceasing ornamented appearing, depth high above-below appearance none.

[10929-10947]
Also ka dag only side fallen, body wisdom arising aspect what. Ground in ka dag nothing existing. From its expanse arising if thought, existing or not, not existing arising illogical, like non-thing from thing arising. Existing contradicts nothing existing. Therefore ka dag's nature spontaneous accomplishment, its expanse inner clear subtle awareness primordial resonance light clear appearance subtle existing. Also outer clear coarse not accepted so liberated from eternalist extreme, inner clear subtle desire so liberated from nihilist extreme. Thus extreme-free self-arisen wisdom essence empty not established anywhere, nature clear appearance mode not ceasing, compassion not ceasing however arising ground making, ground thing nature's actual state.

[10948-11001]
Second individual parts elaborate explanation has two: essence empty aspect's exclusion elaborate explanation, nature appearance aspect's exclusion elaborate explanation. First: ka dag not established as thing or mark's exclusion regarding, awareness not existing, ignorance not existing, Buddha not existing, sentient being not existing, samsara not existing, passed not existing, light not existing, color not existing, body not existing, wisdom not existing, ground not existing, path not existing, result not existing, anyone delusion not existing, liberation not existing, bondage not existing, liberation not existing, action not existing, affliction not existing, wind not existing, element not existing, existing not existing, not not existing, what not existing, not not existing, what established and object not existing, negation only affirmation abandoned showing, auspicious beautiful great: ka dag great called, true Buddha not arisen, unrealized sentient being not arisen place, awareness unmoved primordial resonance great called. To that inexpressible, immeasurable, objectless, unmeasurable, uncountable, by whom also not established, unpointable, knowing mind's object not made. That samsara not seen, samsara that thus not seen. That Dharma not practiced, Dharma's meaning not realized. That samsara not, nirvana not, ground not, appearance not, darkness not, path not, traversing not, non-traversing not, result not, abandoned not, obtained not. That awareness expanse great called. Letterless tantra: I self-arisen wisdom in, examination object not, before passed not, later arising not, now appearing what not, action not, habit not, ignorance not, mind not, intellect not, wisdom not, samsara not, nirvana not, awareness also existing not, wisdom appearance what not.

[11002-11053]
Pearl Garland: abiding nature's essence in, Buddha not existing sentient being not, ignorance not existing delusion not, mind not intellect existing, enemy not friend not relative not, affliction not self-grasping not, going not coming not, Dharma not Dharma appearing not, method not wisdom also not, aggregates not elements not, object not object-to-apprehend not, faculty not object not, apprehended and apprehender not, body not wisdom also not, knower known master not, light not color not existing, sound not smell etc. not, desire not attachment not, expanse not palace not, god not offering object transcended. Six Expanses: elaboration-free dharmata ka dag, own face pure essence's ground, that to words and letters devoid, expressing establish not able, addition term all devoid, apprehending and grasping's conceptual thought not, Buddha not existing sentient being not, Dharma not Dharma's conception not, what not not what not, thus not existing essence in.

[11054-11101]
Letterless: I arising and dying not, ceasing not Dharma completely complete, I outer inner not, clear Dharma completely complete, I empty thing not, appearance Dharma completely complete, I pointing object not, seeing Dharma completely complete, I body mind not, self-appearance Dharma completely complete, I self other not, awareness five completely complete, I doing cause not, great samadhi completely complete, I passed object not, self-appearance object completely complete, I direction and border not, secret wisdom completely complete, I appearance ceasing not, expanse's Dharma three completely complete. Self-Arisen: first ground ka dag great that in, thought not, ignorance not, mind not, intellect not, grasping not, that also thus, uninterrupted wisdom, spontaneously accomplished Buddha, elaboration-free dharmata, extreme-free awareness, pure great appearance, direction-fallen-not view abiding. That also vast, clear, unchanging, wisdom not ceasing, bindu variously emanating, not established dharmata, outer limitless unobstructed, inner wisdom's five lights not ceasing clear, body wisdom's essence abiding. Thus ka dag to wisdom and light appearance showing, ka dag also not negated.

[11102-11189]
Second nature appearance aspect's exclusion elaborate explanation: nature spontaneously accomplished's actual state, India also not ceased, direction anywhere not fallen, body wisdom arising place, inner clear subtle existing outer limitless unobstructed, precious jewel box meaning, spontaneous accomplishment precious cavity, youth vase body field light clear dense arrangement's expanse, outer inner not all inwardly become when, root life wind five, that to body five, speech five, mind five, qualities five, activities five, wisdom five, light five etc. arising ground, arising place, depending object, passed beyond non-existing existing, outer not inner clear, part subtle difficult to examine, ground appearance arising body, path appearance arising ground, result's appearance arising expanse. Form body and awareness arising great expanse abiding. Self-Arisen: that expanse also uninterrupted, direction not fallen, decreasing not, increasing not, empty not, full not, clear aspect possessing, many bodies arising place vast all's nature. Six Expanses: nature's appearance in, mark grasping not at all, color not self-clear, knowing awareness's parts only, grasping's object what not, conceptual thought's grasping aspect not, light transcended primordial resonance, naturally distinguished abiding, body transcended self-resonance, pure great seal abiding. However nature's appearance in, mark object not at all, meaning's part thus abiding, self-resonance produced white aspect, depth clarity great itself abiding, depth clear essence brightness produced, appearance self-purified yellow aspect, not manifest depth abiding own face clear, own face attachment-free resonance produced, attachment self-purified red aspect, depth resonance great not mixed abiding, not mixed individual aspect grasping, effort movement self-liberated's, action not existing green, first's light also, not manifest depth clear aspect, depth clear pervading relation-free, unchanging complete lapis, naturally complete unfabricated abiding. Thus that one's nature in, body appearance mark characteristic devoid, naturally pure great in, complete one's peak abiding, this faculty appearance not, impact mark self-purified, depth clear great ground abiding, pervading and pervaded empty, naturally not cut appearing, clarifying appearance's aspect not ceasing, all essences essence gathered, stain not self-place pure. Buddha's great secret, nature's part abiding. Former: spontaneously accomplished nature's appearance, precious jewel box's meaning, inner wisdom precious appearance clear in, outer limitless unobstructed, youth vase body's actual state called.

[11190-11206]
Third meaning gathering: essence primordial purity thing and mark not existing, nature spontaneously accomplished body wisdom inseparable intention abiding, these two essence one appearance emptiness non-dual. That actual state essence empty unchanging body's nature, three bodies inseparable like sun mandala inner clear yet thing and mark not established, nature primordial resonance light clear yet outer appearance color mark not existing, compassion awareness wisdom abiding yet aspect outer object not investigating, essence nature compassion three abiding.

[11207-11316]
Thus also Self-Arisen: me not existing before ground thus abiding, ground ka dag great called, essence nature compassion three aspects abiding. Essence unchanging wisdom not ceasing clear, youth vase body's actual state called. Nature five lights' appearance not ceasing. Compassion's appearance example like sky cloud-free. Thalgyur: essence ka dag wisdom in, ignorance samsara name not, one and two's number not, examined existing not established not, where not divided dharmata from, wisdom only also established not, wordless expressing established not, extreme not abiding self-aware pure, expressing grasping name's extreme exhausted. Cause not condition's number not, two appearance object and subject not, characteristic anywhere divided not, subject coarse exhausted. Naturally not existing pure, delusion thought ceasing not doing. Not arising so ceasing empty, nature spontaneously accomplished wisdom called, not arising not ceasing not doing, object pure certainty not, potency and quality not ceasing, play merely appearance from, various complete ground. Not existing so appearing, appearing so empty, appearance emptiness entering possessing, Buddha sentient being object field. Thus ground called manifestly abiding. Nature merely abiding from, essence's part examined empty, aspect elaboration so knowing complete, self-abiding spontaneously accomplished, this abandonment acceptance two not. Compassion all-pervading wisdom from, not doing variously arising door, action like appearing essence complete, Dharma-body empty's nature from, wisdom knowing complete aspect, force sentient beings to appearing, that not samsara nirvana portion cut, knowing aware clear, self-aware clear's nature from, nature force's compassion itself, not ceasing ceasing not. Element pure part from, action not one complete, sun from light like, self-possessed obscuration not. That from characteristic grasping's, enjoyment body's wisdom five arising, mirror wisdom form image from, shape and color appearance aspect complete, white stain pure light, self-possessed appearance samsara nirvana connection, Dharma all's form appearance, self-aware wisdom called. Clear empty empty liberated, liberation grasping extreme's thought exhausted, placement not liberation ground complete. Equality called, equal cause two to equal condition three, heard time and measure by, this two not border and devoid, not divided not separate self-abiding two, equality called dharmata to, wound elaboration devoid. Itself modification effort accomplishment not, nature abiding essence empty, mind thought all exhausted, wisdom called abiding from, that characteristic realizing by, samsara nirvana two not abiding. Individual analysis faculty's type, what to what appearance that Dharma, sequence individually clear, examined self-appearance pure from, awareness object become, individual called particular, antidote manner arisen, realized called characteristic seen, self-appearance increase with complete. Naturally first arisen, knowing by affliction fault pure, action complete called, effort effort self-ceased, Dharma all self-place self-liberated. Self-liberation complete ground appearance from, aspect subtle dust-free stain-free obtained, thought examination object transcended, what not divided dharmata. Nature complete appearance extreme exhausted, simultaneously realize. Established desire devoid, repetition reversal not. Naturally abiding meaning in, knowing manifest become, Dharma all exhausted place arrived. Dharma expanse vast in, extreme and center not pointed, liberation ground dharmata pure. Dharma practice doing, passed world action not, nature clear resonance. Expanse opportunity not, self-arisen great abiding. Naturally complete self-nature, first modification not, knowing samsara nirvana two liberated, self-appearance complete intention.
