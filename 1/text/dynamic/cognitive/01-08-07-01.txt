[10782-11333]
First section establishing non-dual ground of primordial purity (ka dag) and unceasing display (ma 'gags pa'i rtsal). Critical examination of objections: if essence (ngo bo) purely primordial purity without display, samsara would not arise from purity—problem; if nature (rang bzhin) merely display without purity, liberation without recognition follows. Resolution: essence primordially pure so sentient beings do not ultimately exist—display as mere play does not contradict purity. View register: apparent contradiction resolved through non-dual understanding.

[Extended Analysis: Objection - Purity Without Display]
The objection: if essence is purely primordial purity without display, samsara could not arise—there would be no basis for appearance. View register: logical objection to be addressed. Translation risk: objection appearing as refutation of Dzogchen. Preservation: this is a logical challenge that Dzogchen answers—purity doesn't exclude display; they are inseparable.

[Extended Analysis: Objection - Display Without Purity]
The counter-objection: if nature is merely display without purity, then liberation without recognition follows—any recognition would do, no purification needed. View register: challenge to groundless display. Translation risk: objection suggesting display needs purity as ground. Preservation: the resolution shows display is not groundless—it displays purity itself.

[Extended Analysis: Resolution - Essence Primordially Pure]
Resolution: essence is primordially pure (ka dag) so sentient beings do not ultimately exist (thog tu sems can med)—display as mere play (rol pa tsam) does not contradict purity. View register: non-dual resolution. Translation risk: "do not exist" suggesting nihilism. Preservation: sentient beings appear (snang) but don't ultimately exist (thog tu med)—like dream beings. This is not denial but accurate description.

[Extended Analysis: Dream Metaphor - Horses and Oxen]
Dream metaphor (rmi lam dpe): horses and oxen appear to dreamer without contradicting sleep emptiness (gnyid stong pa). Dream appearances don't contradict sleep's emptiness—likewise, display doesn't contradict purity. View register: dream as model for all appearance. Translation risk: dream metaphor suggesting unreality. Preservation: dreams are real experiences with unreal objects; waking is similar. The emptiness of sleep doesn't prevent dream appearances.

[Extended Analysis: Yogi Perception Through Mantra Power]
Yogi perception: through mantra power (sngags kyi stobs), appearances manifest as liberation (grol bar snang). Advanced practitioners transform appearance directly into recognition. View register: practice transforming perception. Translation risk: "mantra power" suggesting magic. Preservation: sngags kyi stobs is the power of sacred sound/awareness—transforming perception through recognition, not magic.

[Extended Analysis: Child's Ball Simile]
Child's ball simile (byis pa'i 'khor lo'i dpe): spontaneous reversion without effort (rtsol med 'phar ba lta bu). Like a ball naturally returning to center, appearances naturally self-liberate without effort. View register: natural self-liberation. Translation risk: "reversion" suggesting return to origin. Preservation: 'phar ba means bouncing back—appearances naturally return to emptiness when recognized, without forced effort.

[Extended Analysis: Two Truths Analysis]
Two truths analysis: conventional aspect (kun rdzob phyogs) shows unceasing display with qualities (yon tan ma 'gags pa'i snang ba); ultimate aspect (don dam phyogs) is beyond language (brjod 'das). View register: two truths as perspectives, not separate realities. Translation risk: two truths as dualistic. Preservation: snang ba (appearance) and stong pa (emptiness) are indivisible—two ways of describing one reality.

[Extended Analysis: Vow-Holder and Fully Ordained Example]
Vow-holder (sdom brtan) and fully ordained (bsnyen par rdzogs pa) non-contradiction example (mi 'gal ba'i dpe). Different levels of vow don't contradict—likewise, purity and display don't contradict. View register: different perspectives compatible. Translation risk: example appearing trivial. Preservation: the example shows apparent differences can coexist without contradiction—like different vows for different capacities.

[Extended Analysis: Six Expanses Citation]
Six Expanses citation (klong drug las): essence primordially pure (ka dag ngo bo), stains exhausted (dri ma zad pa); nature unceasing display (ma 'gags rang bzhin), with qualities (yon tan can). Scriptural confirmation of the view. View register: canonical support for non-dual position. Translation risk: citation as mere authority. Preservation: the citation articulates the view precisely—purity as exhaustion of stains, not absence of display.

[Extended Analysis: Dialogue Structure]
Dialogue structure between teacher (ston pa) and bodhisattva clarifies apparent contradictions (gnad gsal bar mdzad pa). Pedagogical format addressing objections. View register: dialogue as clarification method. Translation risk: dialogue as literary device only. Preservation: the dialogue anticipates and answers real objections, making the non-dual view clear.

[Extended Analysis: Highest Dzogchen View]
Register is highest Dzogchen view—non-dual ground beyond conceptual extremes. View register: view transcending philosophy. Translation risk: "highest" suggesting hierarchy. Preservation: this is the direct view of Dzogchen—not higher than others in value, but more immediate in pointing.

[Extended Analysis: Risk - Reifying Essence-Nature]
Risk: reifying essence-nature as two things loses non-dual import. View register: non-duality as crucial. Translation risk: essence-nature appearing as separate entities. Preservation: ngo bo (essence) and rang bzhin (nature) are two words for one reality—like water and wetness. Reifying them as separate destroys the teaching.

[Extended Analysis: Preservation of Non-Assertive Syntax]
Preservation requirement: maintain non-assertive syntax throughout. Dzogchen descriptions are pointing, not claiming. View register: language as finger, not dogma. Translation risk: assertive language contradicting view. Preservation: use syntax that suggests "appears as" rather than "is," "recognized as" rather than "exists as."

[Extended Analysis: Unsurpassed Basis Particularly Explained]
Second section: unsurpassed basis (bla na med pa'i gzhi) particularly explained. Three parts: brief presentation (mdor bstan pa); elaborate explanation (rgyas par bshad pa); meaning gathering (don bsdus pa). Systematic exposition. View register: progressive revelation. Translation risk: parts appearing as separate teachings. Preservation: the three parts present same truth with increasing detail.

[Extended Analysis: Essence Like Unstained Conch]
Essence primordially pure like unstained conch (dung dkar ma bkris pa lta bu'i ka dag ngo bo). Conch naturally white, never stained—likewise essence. View register: purity as intrinsic, not achieved. Translation risk: simile appearing decorative. Preservation: dung dkar is naturally white; its purity is not achieved. This is ka dag—pure from the beginning.

[Extended Analysis: Nature Spontaneously Accomplished]
Nature spontaneously accomplished (lhun grub kyi rang bzhin) not established as thing or mark (dngos dang mtshan ma ma grub pa). View register: display without inherent existence. Translation risk: "not established" suggesting nihilism. Preservation: ma grub means not established as inherently real—display is vivid but empty, like a rainbow.

[Extended Analysis: Inside White Mandala with Subtle Self-Light]
Inside white mandala (dkar dkyil na) with subtle self-light (phra ba rang mdangs) as depth-clarity (zab gsal). The inner dimension—subtle luminosity as profound clarity. View register: inner subtle dimension. Translation risk: "inside" suggesting spatial location. Preservation: this describes the subtle level—white (luminous), mandala (complete), self-light (natural luminosity), depth-clarity (profound knowing).

[Extended Analysis: Outside Limitless Unobstructed]
Outside (phyi rol) limitless (dpag med), unobstructed (thogs med), youth vase body (gzhon nu bum sku) abides as state of reality itself (chos nyid gnas lugs su bzhugs). The outer dimension—unlimited manifestation as youthful, complete form. View register: outer as unlimited display. Translation risk: "outside" dualistic. Preservation: phyir rol means outwardly—not separate from inside, but the display aspect. Youth vase body is the complete form of spontaneous presence.

[Extended Analysis: Essence Empty Yet Subtle Awareness]
Because essence is primordially pure: empty of inherent existence (bdag med stong pa), yet subtle awareness (phra ba rig pa) with primordial resonance (sgra) and self-light ('od) not restricted by conditions (rkyen gyis ma tshugs), naturally self-possessed (rang dbang). View register: union of emptiness and luminosity. Translation risk: "empty" suggesting void. Preservation: stong pa is empty of inherent existence, not empty of qualities. Rig pa, sgra, 'od are present naturally.

[Extended Analysis: Nature Clear with Light-Body-Color]
Because nature is spontaneously accomplished: although abiding as arise-base of all appearances (snang ba thams cad 'char gzhi), in its own face (rang ngo) outwardly clear (phyir gsal), light-body-color ('od lus kha dog) with limiting marks (mtshon cha can) not appearing as real (bden par snang ba ma yin). View register: display as appearance without reification. Translation risk: "not real" denying appearance. Preservation: vivid appearance (light, body, color) without being taken as inherently real—this is the nature.

[Extended Analysis: Inside Vast Expanse - One in Essence]
Inside vast expanse (klong chen) of primordial purity (ka dag), primordial resonance (sgra), depth-clarity (zab gsal), subtle self-light (phra 'od), pristine cognition (ye shes)—one in essence (ngo bo gcig). View register: all aspects unified. Translation risk: list appearing as separate items. Preservation: these are aspects of one reality—different ways of describing the indescribable. They are gcig (one) in essence.

[Extended Analysis: Youth Vase Body as Actual State]
Youth vase body (gzhon nu bum sku) as actual state of reality (dngos gnas chos nyid). The complete form of spontaneous presence, youthful (fresh, vibrant), vase-like (containing all). View register: form as nature's display. Translation risk: literalizing as youth or vase. Preservation: gzhon nu means ever-fresh, not aged; bum pa means containing all qualities. This is the nature's form aspect.

[Extended Analysis: Risk - Literalizing Youth Vase Body]
Risk: literalizing youth vase body as form loses nature-aspect. View register: symbolic description, not physical form. Translation risk: concrete reification. Preservation: gzhon nu bum sku is not a physical body but the nature's display—youthful as ever-fresh, vase-like as all-containing. Don't take it literally.

[Extended Analysis: Essence-Nature-Cleanness Triad]
Essence-nature-cleanness (ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje gsum) triad must be held as non-dual (dbyer med). View register: three aspects of one reality. Translation risk: three appearing as separate. Preservation: the triad is one reality described three ways—essence (emptiness), nature (luminosity), compassion (display). They are dbyer med (indivisible).

[Structural Synthesis: Non-Dual Ground Complete Framework]
This section (10782-11333) presents the complete framework for understanding the non-dual ground of primordial purity and spontaneous presence. The architecture moves from objections and resolution through similes and scriptural citation to detailed explanation of essence and nature. The view throughout is that primordial purity and unceasing display are not contradictory but inseparable—like dream and sleep, like the ocean and its waves. The translator must preserve the non-assertive syntax while conveying the precision of the distinctions. The youth vase body and inner/outer dimensions must be understood symbolically, not literally. The essence-nature-compassion triad is one reality viewed from three perspectives—the basis of all Dzogchen practice and realization.

[Comprehensive Non-Dual Ground Synthesis]
Structural function establishes resolution of apparent contradiction between primordial purity and unceasing display. Objections arise: purity without display makes samsara impossible; display without purity makes liberation automatic. Resolution demonstrates non-dual understanding—essence primordially pure so sentient beings don't ultimately exist; display as mere play doesn't contradict purity. Dream metaphor illustrates: horses and oxen appear in dream without contradicting sleep emptiness.

View register operates within Dzogchen / Non-Duality / Primordial Purity framework. The apparent paradox dissolves through recognition that purity and display are inseparable aspects of single reality. Like dream experiences—real as experience, unreal as objects—waking appearances display without existing ultimately. Mantra power and child's ball simile demonstrate natural self-liberation without effort.

Translation risks include interpreting objections as refutations rather than logical challenges to be addressed. Resolution must preserve non-dual character—purity not excluding display, display not needing purity as external ground. Dream metaphor requires preservation of experience-reality distinction, not dismissal as mere illusion.

Preservation priorities center on maintaining non-dual resolution as Dzogchen's distinctive contribution. Two truths analysis shows conventional display with qualities and ultimate beyond language as perspectives, not separate realities. Vow-holder example demonstrates compatible differences. Six Expanses citation provides scriptural authority.

Extended recognition: This section resolves fundamental philosophical tension between emptiness and appearance. Madhyamaka emphasizes emptiness; Yogacara emphasizes appearance; Dzogchen integrates both in non-dual primordial purity. Not that display is purified into purity, but display itself is purity's play. This is the Great Perfection: nothing needs to change, only be recognized.

The child's ball simile captures natural self-liberation—like ball returning to center, appearances naturally resolve when recognized. No effort required because effort implies separation from natural state. Recognition is not achievement but noticing what has always been present.

Final recognition: Non-dual ground established—primordial purity and unceasing display inseparable. Samsara and nirvana same ground, different recognition. Complete Dzogchen view through comprehensive analysis.
