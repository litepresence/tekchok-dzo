Seven stages of Dzogchen realization. First stage: seeing truth—joy arises, recognizing one's own appearances as self-manifestation. Second stage: pure—beyond stains. Third stage: habituated to luminosity—appearance as luminosity. Fourth stage: seeing wisdom appearances—manifestations of wisdom. Fifth stage: seeing five wisdoms—afflictions naturally purified. Sixth stage: appearing as vajra body—manifestation of vajra form. Seventh stage: beyond affliction—afflictions move far away. Then: unwavering—ultimate stability. Structural note: Dzogchen "seven grounds" progression to full realization.
