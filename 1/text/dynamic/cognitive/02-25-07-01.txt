[16972-17330]
Three kayas and mandala architecture presentation. Structural function: details sambhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya manifestations with their fields and retinues. View register: pure realm cosmology and Buddha-field architecture. Translation: preserve sku gsum, longs sku, sprul sku, chos sku, zhing khams, rigs lnga technical terms. Note: synthesis of creation-phase (bskyed rim) and completion-phase (rdzogs rim) views—drawing from Guhyagarbha and related tantric sources. Translation risk: treating kayas as literal bodies obscures the non-dual relationship between manifestation and emptiness. Preservation: five family (rigs lnga) mandala organization and natural luminosity (rang 'od gsal) as display basis represent key tantric structural elements.
