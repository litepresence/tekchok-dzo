[10211-10765]
Signs of previous training in three kayas. Liberation and confusion in intermediate state and future life—signs of certainty through secret sealing. Three aspects: signs of body trained in three kayas, signs of speech habituated, signs of mind trained. Body training signs: if interrupted in previous life, showing four aspects: sequence of signs, suitability of arising, result if habituated—if not habituated, certainty not obtained. Physical marks: forehead center clockwise-swiving conch or trident-like crease, Om marks, lines—indicating prior Buddha-body training. Structural note: recognizing spiritual progress through physical marks—important for Dzogchen practitioner recognition.
