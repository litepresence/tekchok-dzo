Structural function: Bindu (thig le) comprehensive presentation—essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result. Essence: not different, dwelling as one, without duality—establishing the non-dual nature of bindu as the foundation of all appearance. Definition: bindu as not-change (mi 'gyur), vast expanse (rgya yangs), pervading all (kun tu khyab)—three qualities defining its nature. View register: Dzogchen technical analysis of bindu as energetic-seed principle. Translation risk: Rendering bindu merely as "drop" or "dot" loses its technical meaning as condensed essence of awareness. Preservation: The energetic, luminous nature of bindu must remain clear.

Three divisions of bindu enumerated: (1) body-dwelling channel bindu (lus gnas rtsa thig), (2) nature path bindu (rang bzhin lam thig), (3) complete result bindu (yongs rdzogs 'bras thig). Body-dwelling bindu further divided: conventional cause bindu—white and red two (dkar dmar gnyis); ultimate wisdom bindu—five (ye shes thig le lnga). The wisdom bindu five and ground bindu good, light upper-burden dwelling unmoved in general body channel—establishing the location and function of bindu in the subtle body.

Path bindu described: moved by wisdom wind from within channel, makes four lamps arise, shows appearance of increasing experience. This establishes the dynamic, transformative function of bindu when activated by practice. The movement of bindu through the channels under the influence of wisdom wind generates the visionary experiences of Thogal practice.

Six nature path bindus: (1) reality bindu (de nyid thig le) without fabrication pervading all; (2) Samantabhadra bindu (kun tu bzang po thig le) appearing without good/bad/big/small; (3) expanse bindu (dbyings thig le) clear without outer/inner; (4) pure expanse bindu (dag dbyings thig le) arising without deviation; (5) wisdom bindu (ye shes thig le) dwelling without primordial making; (6) great wisdom bindu (ye shes chen po thig le) appearing directly unobscured. Recognition: These six represent progressively subtle recognitions of bindu nature.

[10826-10899]
Overall structural recognition: This section presents a comprehensive taxonomy of bindu in Dzogchen subtle body theory. The recognition required is that bindu is not merely a physical drop or energetic center but the condensed essence of awareness—the seed from which all manifestation arises. The three divisions (body-dwelling, path, result) establish the progression from potential to actualization. The translator must preserve the technical precision of the classifications while maintaining the understanding that these are subtle body energetics, not gross physical anatomy.
