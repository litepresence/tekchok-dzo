Signs and bardo transitions. Body signs complete: in bardo reality, see truth Buddha. Speech signs: in emanation field, breath-out, take one birth. Mind signs: between two births, like shooting star in sky, three instants as shooting way, self-dissolves into essence. Body-speech-mind signs gathered: great bodhicitta, compassion possessing beings holder—for holding beings in hundred thousand million years. Even with one human body completing meaning, not entering between two births, complete attainment. Structural note: bardo transitions based on training in three kayas.
