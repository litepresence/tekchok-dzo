Signs and bardo transitions—detailing the threefold signs of body, speech, and mind that indicate successful recognition in the bardo. Body signs complete (lus kyi rtags rdzogs): in bardo reality, see truth Buddha (bar do'i dngos la bden pa'i sangs rgyas mthong). When the body's signs are complete, the bardo being directly perceives the Buddha of truth. View register: recognition manifesting as visionary encounter. Speech signs (ngag gi rtags): in emanation field (sprul pa'i zhing), breath-out (dbugs 'byung), take one birth (skye ba gcig). The speech signs indicate entry into the emanation field—the pure land where the next birth will occur. The breath-out marks the transition, followed by taking birth in that field. View register: speech-energy directing manifestation. Translation risk: literal breathing. Preservation: dbugs here is the vital energy moving outward—sign of transition to next existence. Mind signs (sems kyi rtags): between two births (skye ba gnyis bar), like shooting star in sky (nam mkha' la skar ma 'phangs pa lta bu), three instants as shooting way ('phangs lam skad cig gsum), self-dissolves into essence (bdag ngo bo la yal). The mind in transition is like a shooting star—brief, luminous, moving swiftly. In three instants it travels the path and dissolves into essence. View register: mind-transition as instantaneous recognition. Translation risk: "instants" suggesting measurable time. Preservation: skad cig means moment—instantaneous transition. Body-speech-mind signs gathered (lus ngag yid gsum gyi rtags bsdus): great bodhicitta (byang chub sems chen po), compassion possessing beings holder (thugs rje sems can 'dzin)—for holding beings in hundred thousand million years (lo 'bum phrag bye ba na 'dzin). When all three signs are complete, the bodhicitta and compassion are fully manifest—capable of benefiting beings for vast aeons. View register: completion as full capacity for benefit. Translation risk: "holder" suggesting possession. Preservation: 'dzin here means holding or caring for—compassion that holds beings in liberation. Even with one human body completing meaning (mi'i lus gcig gis don rdzogs kyang), not entering between two births (bar ma dor mi 'jug), complete attainment (rdzogs par 'grub). Even one human life can achieve complete attainment without needing to traverse intermediate states. View register: direct attainment possible in one lifetime. Translation risk: "completing" suggesting effort. Preservation: don rdzogs means completion of purpose—achieving liberation directly without intermediate wandering. The structural note indicates these are "bardo transitions based on training in three kayas." The signs manifest based on familiarity with dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya. View register: training creating recognition capacity. Translation risk: training suggesting effortful learning. Preservation: training (sbyang ba) here means familiarization—becoming accustomed to the kayas so they are recognized in bardo. "See truth Buddha" (bden pa'i sangs rgyas mthong) indicates direct vision of the Buddha of truth—dharmakāya manifesting. This is not a metaphor but actual visionary experience in bardo. View register: dharmakāya as visually manifest. Translation risk: "truth" suggesting abstract concept. Preservation: bden pa means real, true—not as opposed to false, but as opposed to deceptive appearance. The dharmakāya is the truth body. The emanation field (sprul pa'i zhing) is the pure land where the next birth occurs—could be a Buddha field or favorable realm. View register: pure lands as actual destinations. Translation risk: pure land as metaphor only. Preservation: in Dzogchen, pure lands are both external locations and mind's display—the emanation field is where consciousness projects next existence. The three instants (skad cig gsum) represent the complete transition—beginning, middle, end—yet occurring instantaneously. View register: thoroughness in instantaneousness. Translation risk: "three" suggesting measurable duration. Preservation: the three are phases of recognition, not periods of time. They happen in the same moment of transition. "Self-dissolves into essence" (bdag ngo bo la yal) indicates the bardo consciousness dissolving into the nature of mind—not reincarnating, but recognizing dharmakāya. View register: dissolution as liberation, not loss. Translation risk: "dissolves" suggesting destruction. Preservation: yal ba means dissolving or merging—like salt dissolving in water, not disappearing but becoming inseparable from essence. The great bodhicitta and compassion indicate the altruistic capacity that manifests when recognition is complete—not personal enlightenment only, but capacity to benefit beings. View register: enlightenment as including compassion. Translation risk: bodhicitta appearing as preliminary practice. Preservation: byang chub sems chen po is the fully manifest mind of enlightenment—compassion and wisdom complete. "Holding beings in hundred thousand million years" indicates the temporal scope of compassionate activity—not limited by one lifetime but continuing for vast aeons. View register: enlightenment transcending temporal limitation. Translation risk: "years" suggesting literal time. Preservation: the number indicates vastness—the enlightened one's compassion is not limited by time or number of beings. The possibility of "not entering between two births" indicates that advanced practitioners can achieve liberation without traversing the bardo—recognizing at death and achieving buddhahood directly. View register: bardo optional for advanced practitioners. Translation risk: "not entering" suggesting escape. Preservation: for those with complete training, there is no bardo—death is immediate recognition of dharmakāya. "Complete attainment" (rdzogs par 'grub) indicates full buddhahood—not partial realization but complete enlightenment. This is possible in one human lifetime through Dzogchen practice. View register: Dzogchen as path of complete and swift attainment. Translation risk: "complete" suggesting finality. Preservation: rdzogs pa means perfect, complete—full manifestation of all qualities, not missing anything.

This section (11182-11321) presents the complete framework of signs indicating successful bardo recognition and transition. The architecture moves from body signs through speech and mind signs, culminating in complete attainment. The view throughout is that these signs are natural manifestations of recognition—when the three kayas are familiar through training, they appear as signs at death and in bardo. The translator must preserve the specific terminology—rtags (signs), yal (dissolving), 'dzin (holding)—while conveying that these are precise indicators of spiritual accomplishment, not mere superstition. The shooting star simile captures the brief, luminous nature of bardo transition; the emanation field indicates the destination; and the complete attainment shows the ultimate goal—benefiting beings for vast aeons without interruption.
