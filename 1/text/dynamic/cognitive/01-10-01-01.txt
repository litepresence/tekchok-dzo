Vajra Essence Path: primordial nature wherein existence arises as spontaneous presence beyond conceptual elaboration. Forms of sentient beings as inconceivable manifestations beyond ordinary conceptual mind. Path of delusion and intention arises according to conceptual thought's self-manifestation. Vajrasattva represents pure awareness of Rigpa, self-arising wisdom of Dharmatā. Vast expanse as ground of being where phenomena naturally abide. Primordial fourfold nature as basis of all manifestation. Magnificent abode as gateway of spontaneous presence. Ground appearance arises effortlessly as natural display of clear light. Timeless moment when sound emerged: beginningless Dharmatā of Samantabhadra. Self appears as other through non-recognition, ground of delusion manifests as apparent existence. Year of Pig: non-recognition fully established as conceptual imputation. Emanated sun: clear perception of coarse object appearances as Nirmāṇakāya. Bird constellation: desire as attachment to five sense objects. Old woman: emergence of non-recognition's awareness as deluded self-apprehension. Uncertain lineage: ground appearances manifest equally as liberation and delusion. Four rugged ones: four conditions giving rise to experience. Five wild ones: five poisons obscuring natural state. Single back support: conceptualizing mind grasping at duality. Single thief: anger stealing peace of natural awareness. Single gatherer: deluded appearances manifest as singular reality through grasping. Mind becomes apprehender of deluded appearance, binding Rigpa in cyclic existence. Manifold afflictions arise as hosts of maras obscuring realization. Delusion arose from primordial purity without ground, hence called existence.
