Vajra Essence Path: primordial nature wherein existence arises as spontaneous presence beyond conceptual elaboration. Forms of sentient beings as inconceivable manifestations beyond ordinary conceptual mind. Path of delusion and intention arises according to conceptual thought's self-manifestation. Vajrasattva represents pure awareness of Rigpa, self-arising wisdom of Dharmatā. Vast expanse as ground of being where phenomena naturally abide. Primordial fourfold nature as basis of all manifestation. Magnificent abode as gateway of spontaneous presence. Ground appearance arises effortlessly as natural display of clear light. Timeless moment when sound emerged: beginningless Dharmatā of Samantabhadra. Self appears as other through non-recognition, ground of delusion manifests as apparent existence. Year of Pig: non-recognition fully established as conceptual imputation. Emanated sun: clear perception of coarse object appearances as Nirmāṇakāya. Bird constellation: desire as attachment to five sense objects. Old woman: emergence of non-recognition's awareness as deluded self-apprehension. Uncertain lineage: ground appearances manifest equally as liberation and delusion. Four rugged ones: four conditions giving rise to experience. Five wild ones: five poisons obscuring natural state. Single back support: conceptualizing mind grasping at duality. Single thief: anger stealing peace of natural awareness. Single gatherer: deluded appearances manifest as singular reality through grasping. Mind becomes apprehender of deluded appearance, binding Rigpa in cyclic existence. Manifold afflictions arise as hosts of maras obscuring realization. Delusion arose from primordial purity without ground, hence called existence.

Land of Vast Expanses: Teacher Light Diffusion, self-arising wisdom manifestation. Two sons imprisoned in cave: story of delusion begins. Five soldiers conquer from stone fortress peak: five poisons.

Flee to temple of Fierce Thought, five men with five hats guard gate: bindu of five lights unmoving. Four mirrors look at demon, recognize own nature as Dharmakāya: four lamps' wisdom. House with eight doors, laugh and lose themselves in spontaneous presence: recognizing spontaneous presence, establishing ground. Teacher Light Diffusion: self-arising wisdom, Buddha nature. Two sons: primordial purity and spontaneous presence united. Imprisoned in cave: spontaneous appearance lacks wisdom, bound by non-recognition. Five men conquering: five poisons disturb Rigpa's self-abiding. Blocked by old woman: Rigpa enters valley of existence, blocked by non-recognition. Captured by four men: four wisdoms purify five afflictions. Four wisdoms liberate, gather, distinguish, move to expanse.

Queens consulting: twenty-one instructions manifest inner meaning. Five men guarding: bindu of five lights unreachable by thought. Four mirrors: four lamps' wisdom revealing self-abiding Rigpa.

Third section: another teaching from spontaneous presence. Land of Great Circumference: single lamp not extinguished within great mire of body and mind. Land of Radiant Light seen by Teacher Mirror Possessor, embodiment of awareness. Prophecy for Radiant Being without distraction, pointing to true nature. Mount Malaya peak: Ocean with Rim, Father Light Protection and Mother Vajra Sow. Two children from union: brother and sister, wisdom and means. Parents' instructions for path. Son to demon land, mirror of self-recognition. Daughter to thirty-three gods' palace, gather flowers of merit. Son refuses: demon Black Halika would imprison in non-recognition. Parents question hesitation. Son replies: Aunt Mushroom Hat dwells there, coemergent ignorance. Requests fire of wisdom. Speaks to parents: land not his, yet shall go for benefit of beings. Requests five servants (five wisdoms), sword anointed with sesame oil (clear light), five mirrors (five Buddha families). Parents rejoice, agree, send supports. Son asks method if captured. Parents reply: Jewel Heap Land of mind dwells four caste people (four lamps). Send as troops: one gather virtue, one iron chains of method, two block gate of delusion. Prophecy complete, son departs with confidence. E Ma Ho, demon Black Halika sees him. Attendants of affliction: flesh-eating human, do not let escape. Five demons capture, Aunt Mushroom Hat puts in iron chains of grasping. Tells attendants he killed her son, do not release. Attendants agree, no power to escape without wisdom. Boy speaks, using skillful means.
