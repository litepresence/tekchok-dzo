[12500-13103]
Structural synthesis: This Vajra Essence section presents complete framework for understanding delusion origin and liberation path through layered symbolic narratives. Architecture moves from primordial nature through delusion process to liberation through recognition. Multiple allegorical cycles—two sons, king's children, old woman's jewel, king Li Gardha's queens, eight-doored castle—each encode same recognition process through different imagery. View throughout: delusion not ultimate, liberation always possible because nature never stained. Translator must preserve symbolic richness while providing recognition key—these represent psychological processes, not external entities. Allegorical method reflects traditional Buddhist pedagogy where complex concepts conveyed through narrative engaging imagination while pointing to non-conceptual recognition. Ultimate message: no matter how lost in delusion, recognition always possible because ground never stained.
