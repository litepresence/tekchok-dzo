[4916-5034]
Meditation (sgom) training in Dzogchen. First: five sense gate direct realization—objects appearing through five senses as own nature. Mind's direct realization: mental phenomena appearing as objects. Awareness direct realization: experiencing bliss and suffering without grasping—non-dual awareness. Four aspects of meditation: gathering mind into dharmakāya, mind resting in selflessness, awareness seeing awareness, no grasping in experience. These correspond to stages: coarse meditation, subtle meditation, non-conceptual meditation, natural meditation. Structural note: meditation training builds on view training. Register: Dzogchen meditation terminology.
