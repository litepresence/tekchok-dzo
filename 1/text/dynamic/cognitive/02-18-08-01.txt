The opening presents the fourfold direct perception that structures the progressive stages of realization. First is the sense faculty direct perception of form and the five sense objects appearing as their own nature without conceptual overlay. Second is the mind's direct perception of mental phenomena operating within the sphere of cause and effect certainty. Third is the self-awareness direct perception experiencing bliss and suffering without grasping or rejection. Fourth is the yogic direct perception entering the sphere of suchness beyond subject-object division. This structural framework establishes the hierarchical progression from conventional to ultimate perception, demonstrating how each level transcends while including the previous. The view register emphasizes non-dual awareness beyond all subject-object division. Translation must preserve the technical terminology of "direct perception" while clearly distinguishing the four types and their interrelationship.

The discussion of ultimate sphere direct perception establishes awareness essence as abiding in the heart center of true nature. The argument from cause and effect compares sun and its rays to demonstrate the inseparability of awareness and its expressions—neither identical nor different. This reasoning supports the confidence in recognition that comes from direct experience rather than inference. The view register positions this as transcendent direct perception beyond worldly perception, accessible only to those who have entered the path of seeing. Translation risk involves rendering the logical terminology of cause and effect reasoning precisely while maintaining readability and preventing overly philosophical interpretations that miss the experiential dimension.

The term "true nature" receives fourfold analytical presentation to establish precise meaning. First distinction: samsara as phenomena versus nirvana as true nature, showing the relationship between confused appearance and natural purity. Second: appearance as phenomena versus emptiness as true nature, demonstrating the unity of apparent and empty. Third: lack of essential point preventing liberation versus existence of essential point ensuring liberation, indicating the necessity of recognizing the crucial points. Fourth: sphere as phenomena versus awareness as true nature, revealing the ultimate identity of space and knowing. This analytical presentation demonstrates the precision of Dzogchen vocabulary and prevents reification of either appearance or emptiness. The view register shows how conventional and ultimate are not contradictory but nested dimensions of a single reality.

The three aspects—base, path, and measure—establish the complete framework for practice organization. Base is determined through three essential points of body, speech, and mind that establish the foundation. Path is cleared through three essential points of inner true nature object, opening gateway, and wind abiding that remove obstacles. Measure is determined through three stages of secret familiarization, ripening signs, and final cessation that mark progress. This enumerative structure provides the scaffolding for all subsequent practice instructions, ensuring systematic progression without skipping essential stages. The numerical correspondence reflects the tradition's concern with complete and balanced development.

The explanation of "three" continues with the spontaneous presence of three bodies in true nature, their own radiances appearing as three distinct manifestations. The inner experience of dharmakāya manifests as aware emptiness—the knowing quality of empty essence. The five lights appearing outward represent self-clear wisdom displaying as saṃbhogakāya. The arising liberation without form manifests as wisdom power with intelligence, the nirmāṇakāya dimension. The structural function connects the numerical framework to actual experience, preventing abstract philosophical understanding divorced from recognition. Translation must preserve the technical vocabulary of "own radiance" and "arising liberation" while conveying their immediate experiential significance.

[4978-4992]
The necessity of direct perception without conceptual addition demonstrates why intellectual analysis alone cannot achieve recognition. The citation from Sancaya establishes that wisdom searching through conceptual analysis does not find the depths of aggregates, just as someone with eyes cannot find the end of space by searching. This supports the emphasis on direct experience over philosophical speculation. The view register distinguishes authentic direct perception from mistaken attempts to conceptualize the inconceivable. Translation risk involves maintaining the distinction between analytical meditation and settling meditation without privileging either or suggesting they are separate paths.

The luminosity appearance is distinguished from conventional visible form—it cannot be destroyed by the four elements because it lacks both coarse and subtle material characteristics. This establishes the indestructible nature of awareness display, which persists through all conditions while remaining unaffected by them. The translation challenge involves rendering "indestructible" in a way that conveys both the technical meaning and its implications for practice—that recognition of this nature provides ultimate security beyond the vulnerability of conditioned phenomena. The view register establishes this as the vajra nature, simultaneously empty and luminous.

[5012-5034]
The appearance section cites Thalgyur: "True nature direct perception appearance, certain emergence from sense faculty gateway, clear in cloudless sky." This poetic imagery supports the direct perception framework by providing accessible metaphors for immediate recognition. The additional citations establish the continuity of this teaching across multiple authoritative sources. The view register maintains the consistency of Dzogchen presentation across different textual traditions, demonstrating this is not an isolated teaching but part of the living transmission. Preservation requires maintaining the citation structure that provides scriptural authority while ensuring the experiential meaning remains primary over textual scholarship.
