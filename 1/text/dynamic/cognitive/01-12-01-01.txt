[13831-13870]
Channel exposition opening. Three mother channels: Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma. Roma etymology: ro (flavor) ma (mother), experiential extraction through desire. Kyangma: straight hollow, dual bindu causation, mo (female) indicating foundation-function. Kundarma: ku (gathering all), darma (pervading all). These three mother-channels as ground of all others. Risk: lateral asymmetry may misread as literal side-placement. Preserve functional distinction, not anatomical fixedness.

[13871-13900]
Anatomical specification of channel pathways. Roma coils from navel rightward; Kyangma emerges from heart-tip through throat network to left eye; Kundarma central with three tips at Brahma's aperture. Right tip enters right ear moving karma-wind; left tip enters left ear causing wisdom-wind to dawn. Nostrils moving with karma-wind supports Avadhuti meditation. Risk: "gate at Brahma's aperture" as conceptual landmark, not surgical target.

[13901-13940]
Four subtle knots in Roma: navel (generation), memory (mother's red bindu), flavors (wind bindu), tip (light bindu). Each knot corresponds to progressively refined drop-size. Generation knot holds father's white causal bindu—body develops upward from this. Developmental sequence from coarse to subtle. Risk: "blood to regenerative fluid" as energetic progression map, not biochemical process.

[13941-13980]
Kyangma's four knots: generation (water-lamp seeds), memory (fire bindu), flavors (five-colored light bindu), tip (emptiness bindu). When gates pure: four lamps manifest; when impure: four elements arise. Purity-impurity correspondence maps directly to practice outcome. Ultimate undefiled wisdom dawns through these gates. Risk: "deity's mandala on mustard seed" as literal visualization instruction. Note for consistency with tantric visualization vocabulary.

[13981-14030]
Kundarma as gathering of channel-nature, ground of samsara and nirvana. Four knots: generation (body-size mustard seed), memory (celestial palace mandala), flavors (wrathful mandala), tip (all lights). Central channel without blood or serum indicates empty wind activity. Right side circulates water, blood, bodhicitta; left side circulates element-essences and wisdom. Risk: anatomical right/left may misalign with Western anatomical orientation. Preserve original lateral specification.

[14031-14080]
Classification section: eight-part structure (names, purifiers, indicators, generation methods, activities, essence, dharmata, training). Channel numbers: 72,000 general, 64 at generation, 16 at memory (making 80), 32 at flavors (making 112), 360 at tip (making 472 with four wheels). Numbers function as structural architecture. Three channels emerge straight like life-trees from four wheels—outer support of body/speech/mind, inner connects vajras, secret ground for three kayas.

[14081-14120]
Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma contain OM, AH, HUM when pure (ground for three kayas), when impure (ground for ordinary body/speech/mind), through perversion (door for three poisons). Etymology: Roma tastes supreme food-flavor when cut, becomes corpse-flavor when left in nature—male right/female left placement. Kyangma pulls dharmas free of thought-experience; hollow when unworked—male left/female right. Kundarma sustains body/speech/mind activity. Risk: "male/female" refers to practitioner type, not biological sex essentialism. Preserve as functional category.

[14121-14160]
Female channel types: deer-channel (bluish, short, beautiful teeth, round face), elephant-trunk type (pale, straight yellow hair, thin, prominent navel), lotus-possessor (black, coarse, unpleasant), line-marked (blue-green, sharp teeth, long eyes/face), conch-possessor (yellow, short, clear brow-space). Each type has specific channel configuration and corresponding liberation method. Risk: racial-typological language requires careful handling—these are energy-pattern descriptors, not ethnic classifications. Preserve as yogic typology.

[14161-14200]
Female-specific illness categories: 101 wisdom-race channels, five races within fetus-consuming worm, ten illness types in menses, five illnesses of engagement, five of vessel-holding, seven of abiding seed—32 total, not found in males. Contextual claim: females surpass males in vessel womb, non-flowing seeds, worm activities. Gender-specific physiological architecture. Risk: modern readers may find this dismissive—preserve as period-specific somatic theory without apologetic gloss.

[14201-14240]
Channel purifiers: Roma proficient purifies bodily activities; Kyangma purifies speech; Kundarma purifies mind. Indicators: Roma indicates bliss as thought-free (memory exhausts through dependent origination wheel); Kyangma indicates clarity non-dual with flavor (singular bindu meaning); Kundarma indicates union without difference (means-bliss and wisdom-emptiness united). Right indicates means, left indicates wisdom, center indicates non-dual.

[14241-14280]
Generation functions: Roma generates body from four elements, father's cause and water, mother's condition fire and wind—separating pure and impure. Kyangma generates speech—if straight, pleasant voice and clear signs; if branched, voice cracks or stammers. Yogis transform through channel oral instructions. Kundarma generates mind—crookedness produces distraction, branches produce sharp mind with forgetfulness, thick-thin produces fluctuation, emptiness produces virtue and wisdom.

[14281-14320]
Activities: Roma pure shows lamp-radiance, impure drips bile. Kyangma pure attracts upward showing self-appearance (experience and increase), impure moves downward discarding bile. Kundarma pure shows ultimate bodhicitta, impure causes relative bodhicitta flow. Males actually release (contact-destruction), females gather and increase (increasing contact). Menses details: nose-channel movement, blood flow, element essential point timing—male/female determination through flow timing. Risk: physiological details as period-specific somatic theory.

[14321-14360]
Essence: Roma bliss (means liberating to dharmata), Kyangma emptiness (wisdom liberating apprehending mind), Kundarma bliss-emptiness non-dual (union liberating from apprehender/apprehended). Dharmata: Roma takes food and separates pure/impure (wide passage large belly, narrow small, crooked vomits); Kyangma bodily heat fluctuation (narrow great heat, wide cold); Kundarma thirst varieties (narrow never thirsty, wide great thirst, crooked various illnesses). Risk: bodily function correlation as energetic correspondence map.

[14361-14400]
Training methods: Roma body-forming (Sambhogakaya), abiding (Nirmana), dissolving (Dharmakaya)—three-kaya mandala. Kyangma speech-abiding samadhi, expression meditation, exhaustion shows dharmatas, sound syllables of secret mantra. Kundarma mind-movement, memory-thought pure dharmata, thoughts self-liberate, objects/conditions liberate to dharmata. Channel-leap time determines death-transference and rebirth. Risk: these are condensed oral instruction summaries—preserve compression.

[14401-14460]
Four wheels establishment: first from water activity (blood, serum, saliva, tears), second from earth activity (muscle, organ meat), third from fire activity (heat element), fourth from wind activity (breath, ascending/descending). Generation transforms male/female; memory transforms life-length; flavors transforms enjoyment; tip transforms pure/impure senses and migrator relationships. Risk: element theory uses pre-modern physics—preserve as systematic correspondence.

[14461-14527]
Four wheels certainty: one and two don't ripen empowerment/path/result; three also doesn't ripen. Connection sequence establishes outer four elements, inner four wisdoms, secret four lamps, supreme four kayas. Body/speech/mind/consciousness four, four purifiers, four result fruits—certainty grounds four wheels. Individual classifications: navel Nirmanakaya wheel, heart Dharmacakra wheel, throat Sambhogakaya wheel, crown great bliss wheel. Risk: wheel-to-kaya mapping as pedagogical correlation, not metaphysical identity. Closing summation repeats "Thus it is" three times—emphatic closure through formulaic assertion.
