[13831-13850]
Channel exposition opens with the three mother channels (rtsa'i gtsa mo gsum): Roma (ro ma), Kyangma (rkyang ma), and Kundarma (kun 'dar ma). These three constitute the ground from which all other channels emerge. Roma's etymology derives from "tasting flavor" (ro) and "mother" (ma), indicating its function of experiential extraction through the bindu of bliss. The Jewel Garland (mu tig phreng ba) establishes these channels as holding bindus, possessing the nature of subtle and flowing, beautified by light rays. Translation must preserve functional distinction rather than anatomical fixedness.

[13851-13870]
Roma's nature extends through detailed analysis. It extracts the essence of all flavors, comparable to salt, generating uncommon experiences through reliance on bindu bliss. Alternatively, it represents activity-action reduced to minimum, experiencing through bindu delusion, difficult to express—hence "ma" (mother). When active, it transforms the relative bindu, embodying the nature of means (thabs). Kyangma represents the straight, hollow channel without branches or leaves, called "single hollow tube" (rkang pa reng bu). Its nature produces both ultimate and relative bindus, ripening and separating ultimate and relative arising. Being singularly hollow, it is unchanging—hence "mo" (female) indicating it as the ground of all.

[13871-13900]
Anatomical specification details channel pathways with precision. Roma coils from the left of the navel, moving through rightward spirals. Kyangma emerges from the heart-tip's left, passes through the throat channel network, exits from within the skull, and enters through the left eye opening. The right side of Roma corresponds to the relative bindu, supporting body maturation, producing bliss, pain, equanimity, and elemental increase-decrease. Four subtle knots exist within Roma: at the navel, memory, flavors, and tip. Each corresponds to progressively refined drop sizes.

[13901-13930]
The generation knot at the navel holds the father's white causal bindu, sized like a mustard seed divided into ten parts. This supports body development upward—hence called "cause" (rgyu). The memory knot holds the mother's red conditional bindu, also mustard seed-sized, serving as support for various transformations—hence "memory" (dran pa). The flavors knot holds the wind bindu, separating pure from impure, discarding impurities like waste fluids while pure essence produces bodily radiance. The tip knot holds the mind-nature light bindu.

[13931-13970]
These four knots constitute the supports of the relative level. Their movement separates body and mind. From the relative cause, essence matures into blood, blood into flesh, flesh into serum, serum into lymph, lymph into marrow, marrow into regenerative fluid, and from regenerative fluid into the relative bindu. Kyangma's four parallel knots produce different bindus: water-lamp seeds at generation, fire bindu at memory, five-colored light bindu at flavors, and emptiness bindu at the tip.

[13971-14010]
When the gates are pure, four lamps manifest; when impure, the four elements arise. Through the purity-impurity correspondence, practice outcomes are determined. Ultimate undefiled wisdom dawns through these gates. Kundarma as the gathering of all channel-nature serves as the ground of both samsara and nirvana. Its four knots hold: body-sized mustard seed at generation, celestial palace mandala at memory, wrathful mandala at flavors, and all lights at the tip. The central channel contains no blood or serum, indicating empty wind activity.

[14011-14050]
The classification system organizes into eight parts: names, purifiers, indicators, generation methods, activities, essence, dharmata, and training methods. Channel numbers total 72,000 generally, with 64 at generation, 16 at memory (making 80), 32 at flavors (making 112), and 360 at the tip (making 472 total with the four wheels). These numbers function as structural architecture rather than anatomical claims.

[14051-14090]
The three mother channels emerge straight like life-trees from the four wheels. Externally they support body, speech, and mind; internally they connect the three vajras; secretly they serve as ground for the three kayas. Roma, Kyangma, and Kundarma contain OM, AH, and HUM when pure—serving as ground for the three kayas. When impure, they serve as ground for ordinary body, speech, and mind. Through perversion, they become doors for the three poisons.

[14091-14130]
Etymological analysis reveals deeper meanings. Roma tastes supreme food-flavor when cut (active), becomes corpse-flavor when left in nature (inactive). Male practitioners have Roma on the right, females on the left. Kyangma pulls dharmas free of thought-experience; when unworked it remains hollow—hence "rkyang" (isolated/straight). Males have Kyangma on the left, females on the right. Kundarma sustains body, speech, and mind activity—located centrally between male and female.

[14131-14170]
Female channel types manifest in five forms, each with distinct characteristics. The deer-channel (ri dwags can) type has bluish color, short body, beautiful teeth, round face, and gazelle-like channel. The elephant-trunk type has pale color, straight yellow hair, thin body, prominent navel, and elephant-trunk-like channel. The lotus-possessor type has black color, coarse features, unpleasant appearance, and lotus-like channel. The line-marked type has blue-green color, sharp teeth, long eyes and face, and painting-like channel. The conch-possessor type has yellow color, short body, clear brow-space, and conch-spiral-like channel.

[14171-14210]
Each female channel type has specific implications for practice. The deer-channel type, with its thick root and fine tip, has excessive desire but cannot release bodhicitta directly. The elephant-trunk type, with upward-facing channel, also cannot release bodhicitta directly. The lotus-possessor type, with wide channel, has great bliss. The line-marked type has channels spreading everywhere. The conch-possessor type, with coiled channel, cannot find desire's flavor. Each requires specific oral instructions.

[14211-14250]
Female-specific illness categories number thirty-two, not found in males. These derive from five wisdom-race channels, five races within fetus-consuming worms, ten illness types in menses, five illnesses of engagement, five of vessel-holding, and seven of abiding seed. Context claims females surpass males in vessel womb capacity, non-flowing seeds, and worm activities. Gender-specific physiological architecture represents period-specific somatic theory.

[14251-14290]
Channel purifiers operate through specific functions. Roma proficiency purifies all bodily activities. Kyangma purifies speech activities. Kundarma purifies mind activities. Indicators reveal deeper truths: Roma indicates bliss as thought-free, with memory exhausting through dependent origination wheel—hence its name. Kyangma indicates clarity non-dual with flavor, resting in singular bindu meaning—hence "isolated." Kundarma indicates union without difference, means-bliss and wisdom-emptiness united, relative and ultimate perceivers fused—hence "all-pervading."

[14291-14330]
Generation functions map directly to the three channels. Roma generates body from four elements: father's cause and water produce the body's foundation; mother's condition and fire separate pure and impure. Kyangma generates speech: if straight, voice is pleasant and signs clear; if branched, voice cracks or stammers. Kundarma generates mind: crookedness produces distraction, branches produce sharp mind with forgetfulness, thick-thin produces fluctuation, emptiness produces virtue and wisdom.

[14331-14370]
Activities of the three channels reveal their functions. Roma's pure aspect shows lamp-radiance; impure aspect drips bile. Kyangma's pure aspect attracts upward showing self-appearance; impure moves downward discarding bile. Kundarma's pure aspect shows ultimate bodhicitta; impure causes relative bodhicitta flow. Male and female differences emerge: males release (contact-destruction), females gather and increase.

[14371-14410]
Menses details reflect channel movement patterns. Nose-channel movement produces blood flow. Element essential point timing determines male/female: upper flow consistently produces males, lower flow consistently produces females, interrupted flow produces neither. Blood's impurity and yellow color indicate few offspring. Black color with impure smell produces many offspring of both sexes. These physiological details represent period-specific somatic theory requiring preservation without apologetic gloss.

[14411-14450]
Essence of each channel reveals liberation pathways. Roma's essence is bliss—means liberating to dharmata. Kyangma's essence is emptiness—wisdom liberating apprehending mind. Kundarma's essence is bliss-emptiness non-dual—union liberating from apprehender/apprehended. Dharmata functions: Roma takes food and separates pure from impure; wide passage produces large belly, narrow produces small, crooked produces vomiting. Kyangma regulates bodily heat; narrow channel produces great heat, wide produces cold. Kundarma governs thirst varieties.

[14451-14527]
Training methods connect channels to three kayas. Roma body-forming corresponds to Sambhogakaya (abiding), Nirmanakaya (abiding), and Dharmakaya (dissolving)—the three-kaya mandala of body. Kyangma speech-abiding corresponds to samadhi, meditation of expression, exhaustion showing dharmatas, sound syllables of secret mantra. Kundarma mind-movement corresponds to memory-thought pure dharmata, thoughts self-liberating, objects/conditions liberating to dharmata. Channel-leap time determines death-transference and rebirth. These are condensed oral instruction summaries.

Structural transition analysis: The exposition on three mother channels completes the foundational anatomical presentation before transitioning to the four wheels system (lines 14221-14527). This transition marks a shift from linear channel architecture to the chakra-based wheel system, integrating the three channels as central axes within each wheel. The four wheels—navel, heart, throat, and crown—establish a vertical hierarchy corresponding to Nirmanakaya, Dharmacakra, Sambhogakaya, and great bliss manifestations.

Extended technical analysis: The four wheels' certainty (nges pa) derives from multiple correlation systems. First, the connection sequence (sbyar bya dang sbyor byed kyi rim pa) establishes certainty through fourfold correspondences: outer four elements, inner four wisdoms, secret four lamps, supreme four kayas. Second, the body-speech-mind-consciousness fourfold purifies through four empowerments into four result fruits, grounding the four wheels as basis. Third, the inverse certainty (ldog phyogs nges pa) determines that since wheels one and two do not ripen empowerments, paths, and final results, and wheel three also does not ripen, the certainty must be fourfold.

Embryological precision: The navel Nirmanakaya wheel serves as the first wheel of water activity, producing blood, serum, saliva, and tears. The wheel's 64 main petals with countless subdivisions organize through five element channels (earth five, water five, fire five, wind five, mind five) plus five ignorance channels and two space-mind channels, totaling 2432 channels when subdivided. The heart Dharmacakra wheel functions through earth activity, producing muscles, organ meat, and physical structure. The throat Sambhogakaya wheel operates through fire activity, generating heat, sense faculties, and color. The crown great bliss wheel functions through wind activity, producing breath, ascending-descending energies, and the root of karma-wind's cyclic existence.

Phenomenological mapping: Each wheel's activity demonstrates specific functional correlations. Generation (skyes byed) transforms male and female characteristics through bodily size, limb coarseness, and strength. Memory (dran pa) transforms life-length through intelligence, sense clarity, and presence or absence of coarse concepts. Flavors (ro rnams) transforms enjoyment through speech quality, voice clarity, and eloquence. Tip (rtsa mo) transforms pure and impure senses and migrator relationships through mental accomplishment, virtue increase, and goal attainment.

Technical progression: The expansive and gathering dynamics ('phen sdu) demonstrate predictable patterns. Expansive (phen pa) produces large body, coarse limbs, great strength; gathering (sdu ba) produces small form, weak strength, fine limbs. Expansive-gathering together produces small form yet strong. Memory's expansive produces clear intelligence, bright senses, absence of coarse thought; gathering produces great conceptuality and forgetfulness. Flavors' expansive produces pleasant speech, clear expression, eloquence; impure expansive produces pleasant speech with great courage yet powerless speech. Tip's expansive produces pure mind and accomplished thought; impure expansive produces achieved mental goodness without virtue increase.

Register recognition: The closing section employs emphatic formulaic assertion through triple repetition of "Thus it is" (zhes so), marking definitive closure to the extensive anatomical exposition. This rhetorical device establishes authoritative certainty regarding the four wheels' structure, function, and significance within the Treasury's comprehensive subtle body system.

Preservation note: The four wheels presentation requires careful attention to technical terminology—wheel names (sprul pa'i 'khor lo, chos kyi 'khor lo, longs spyod kyi 'khor lo, bde chen gyi 'khor lo), numerical correspondences (64, 16, 32, 360 petals), and functional specifications (generation, memory, flavors, tip). The integration of embryological, physiological, contemplative, and soteriological dimensions demands preservation of the text's systematic coherence without reduction to single-domain interpretation.

Risk acknowledgment: The gender-specific channel typology and female illness categories represent period-specific somatic theories that may conflict with modern biological understanding. These should be preserved as historical medical-tantric theory without apologetic revision or essentialist reification. The lateral placements (right/left/center) indicate functional orientations within the subtle body system, not literal anatomical positions—translation must preserve this functional distinction to avoid misreading as crude physicalism.

The eight-part classification structure maintains consistency across channel presentations: names establish identity, purifiers indicate cleansing functions, indicators reveal recognition signs, generation methods show origination processes, activities demonstrate operational functions, essence reveals liberating nature, dharmata shows ultimate characteristics, and training methods provide practical application. This organizational schema demonstrates the Treasury's pedagogical architecture, presenting each anatomical element as a complete system with relative and ultimate dimensions accessible through appropriate practice.

Comprehensive doctrinal integration: The three mother channels exposition establishes the foundational framework upon which the entire Treasury subtle body system rests. Roma, Kyangma, and Kundarma operate not merely as physiological conduits but as the ground of samsaric delusion and nirvanic realization. Through the eightfold analytical structure—names, purifiers, indicators, generation, activities, essence, dharmata, and training—each channel reveals its dual nature: as the basis for ordinary body-speech-mind when unrecognized, and as the ground for three kayas when purified. The numerical correspondences (72,000 general channels, 472 specific channels across four wheels) encode structural relationships rather than anatomical claims. The four subtle knots in each channel—generation, memory, flavors, and tip—demonstrate progressive refinement from coarse elements to ultimate bindu, establishing the embryological and contemplative continuity that characterizes tantric physiology. Female-specific typologies and illness categories, while reflecting historical medical theories, demonstrate the text's recognition of gender-differentiated subtle anatomy. The transition from three channels to four wheels marks a shift from linear to chakra-based architecture, integrating the mother channels as central axes within each wheel's mandala structure. This integration maintains doctrinal coherence across physiological, medical, contemplative, and soteriological domains, presenting the subtle body as a complete phenomenological field where recognition transforms the basis of delusion into the ground of liberation.
