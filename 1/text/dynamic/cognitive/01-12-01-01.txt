Channel exposition three divisions: general presentation of channel nature, detailed explanation of various categories, explanation of practice methods. Pearl Garland states channels possess bindus, having nature of subtle vibration and pulsation, adorned by light rays themselves. Three aspects: right, left, and central. Three principal channels: Roma extracts all tastes like salt generating bliss experience, called ma as mother; Kyangma lacks crookedness or branches, straight and isolated like arrow, called mo as ground of all; Kundarma gathers everything, pervading whole generally. View register: channels as energetic supports for recognition. Translation risk: anatomical literalism losing energetic significance. Preservation: functional characteristics over physical location.

Location specifications. Roma coils from left of navel moving to right. Kyangma emerges from left of heart's tip, exits throat's channel web, enters from within skull, emerges from left eye. Roma from right eye. Kundarma abides straight in center, dividing into three tips at crown's Brahma aperture where body of awareness without thought manifests. Right tip pierces right ear causing karma wind to vibrate. Two subtle branches pierce both nostrils causing karma wind functions to vibrate, wind enters avadhuti serving as basis for wind samadhi. Left tip pierces left ear causing wisdom wind to manifest. Left channel has natural bindu, right has relative bindu. Right relying on relative bindu matures body performing bliss, suffering, equanimity, elemental growth and decline. Four subtle knots within: at navel, dranpa, tastes, and tip.

[13931-13980]
At generation place within channel, father's white bindu cause abides size of mustard seed divided into ten parts. Relying on this body grows upward hence called cause. At dranpa, mother's red bindu condition abides size of mustard seed's tenth part, dranpa abides as support for transforming into various forms. At tastes, wind bindu abides size of mustard seed's tenth part, separates pure from impure, discarding impurities outside while pure essence generates body's radiance and vitality. At tip, mind-nature light bindu abides size of mustard seed's tenth part. These are called supports of relative. When they transfer body and mind separate. From relative cause blood matures, from blood flesh, from flesh serum, from serum lymph, from lymph marrow, from marrow marrow fluid, from marrow fluid channels, from channels relative bindu matures.

[13981-14030]
Kyangma's four knots: at generation, seed of distant water lamp's two small shimmering eyes abide. At dranpa, support of self-arisen wisdom's lamp, blazing fire bindu abides. At tastes, support of pure realm, five-colored bindu with aureole abides. At tip, support of empty bindu, individual light bindus abide in respective colors. Relying on these ultimate unconditioned wisdom manifests, relying on these one attains natural Buddhahood called natural bindu. When gates pure they are four lamps, when impure become four elements. Kundarma is gathering of nature of all channels, vibrates through projection and withdrawal of wind, being ground of samsara and nirvana called ma as mother. Four knots: at generation, support of all kayas abides as body size of mustard seed with clear light face and hands. At dranpa, support of wisdom, palace with four gates, four porticoes, individual body colors and hand implements of deities abides as complete mandala. At tip, mandala of wrathful deities, support of all lights abides. Central channel lacks blood and lymph, empty and open performing wind function.

Detailed categories: general presentation of three principal channels nature, detailed explanation of four chakras distinctions. Talgyur states body keypoint is channels, distinguished by location, arrangement, vibration, being support of chakras and body life-force, name and category, cause and condition, performing actions and characteristics, afflictive actions and wisdom actions, manifest appearances through reliance on actions, distinctions of diseases and elements, abiding as agitation. Through blocking they cease, through pressing they bind, through suppressing they control vital points, through piercing they are known, through projection they are grasped by emptiness, through violence they are captured. Thus through channels keypoints abode of Buddhahood indicated. Explanation has eight parts: names of channels, their purifiers, what they indicate, how they generate, what actions they perform, their essence, their dharmata, instructions on how to train them.

[14081-14130]
Generally 72,000 channels abide in body. Specifically at generation place 64, at dranpa 16 making 80, at tastes 32 making 112, at tip 360 making 472. When four chakras combined this is special summary. At center of four chakras three channels arise straight like life-trees without crookedness. Externally serve as support of three body speech and mind. Internally connect boundaries of three kayas speech and mind. Secretly serve as basis for manifestation of three kayas. Three channels Roma Kyangma Kundarma. Within these three abide Om Ah Hum. When pure serve as ground for maturing three kayas speech and mind. When impure serve as ground for maturing body speech and mind. When perverted open door for manifestation of three poisons.

[14131-14180]
Roma so-called because through blocking it tastes supreme food, naturally abiding like taste of dead unable to perform function. Dwells at right side of male and left side of female. Kyangma so-called because through control gives rise to thought-free dharmata experience, naturally abiding unrelated to others remaining isolated. Dwells at left side of male and right side of female. Kundarma dwells in center of both male and female. Through pressing gives rise to manifest wisdom experience, naturally abiding performs function of sustaining body speech and mind. Because these three channels are mother-ground of all channels called ma. Five female channel types with distinct characteristics: deer types with bluish color short stature good teeth round faces, elephant-trunk types with white complexion thin yellow hair slender bodies full abdomens, lotus types with black color coarse limbs rough faces, striped types with blue-green color tight teeth long eyes, conch types with yellow color small stature thin teeth clear brow space.

[14181-14230]
Deer types have channel thick at root with excessive desire but fine tip unable to emit bodhicitta, instructions on moving channel through bindu keypoints primary. Elephant-trunk types have channel tip facing upward from navel unable to descend with bodhicitta, less desire arises from divided channels, instructions on straightening channel primary. Lotus types have channels like open lotus with rounded mouths unable to descend with bodhicitta, being long bliss is great, instructions on opening channel mouth primary. Striped types have channels like drawn lines happy to dance with great bliss of taste from start, being woven bodhicitta does not emerge, having many branches whatever touched generates, instructions on gathering channel primary. Conch types have channels coil to right like conch unable to descend with bodhicitta, being coiled taste of desire not found, instructions on separating channel primary. Thirty-two different disease types in females not found in males, arising from container being more in females, non-flowing seed, actions of many demons. Kundarma dwelling unchanging in center of both indicates great perfection natural ground for all.

[14231-14280]
Purifiers of three channels: being skilled in Roma's keypoint purifies all body actions, Kyangma purifies speech, Kundarma purifies actions done by mind. What channels indicate: Roma indicates non-conceptual bliss, through relying on that rotating wheel of dependent origination dranpa ceases becoming like aspect of taste hence called Roma. Kyangma indicates single taste through clarity abiding in meaning of single bindu hence called Kyangma. Kundarma indicates non-dual union with skillful means bliss and wisdom emptiness in union, conventional and ultimate in union, being non-dual and free from extremes called pure view. Right indicates skillful means, left indicates wisdom, center indicates non-duality.

[14281-14330]
How channels generate: Roma generates body from beginning through action of four elements. From father's cause and water through maturation and entering channel wheel's action grasps body's ground. From mother's condition through fire and wind's maturation and channel wheel's action body's pure and impure separated generating body. Four chakras abide as eight causes and conditions gathering assembly of eight consciousnesses performing preparation of places for spreading. Kyangma generates speech: if straight without crookedness speech pleasant and signs clear; if subtle branches voice carries far but short or signs unclear and stammering comes. Naturally lacks branches and crookedness. From ten channels going to gag and up and down, from same channel having thick and thin upper and lower sections voice has many peaks and interruptions. If channel has curves speech slurred and shaking comes; if open speech hollow and swallowing sound comes.

[14331-14380]
Kundarma generates mind: if channel has much crookedness mind always distracted cannot focus; if branches mind sharp but forgetful; if thick and thin sections awareness has much fluctuation cannot remain one-pointed doing many activities without stable basis; if channel open whatever thought becomes virtuous endowed with wisdom and intelligence; if lacks thick and thin sections and straight mind stable without fluctuation; if goes to right much thought; if to left always abiding in doubt and indecision; if tip transforms always much suffering and mental discomfort; if channel pierced mind always light and diligent in virtue; if channel wide always great effort and completed endeavors. Body generates channels, channels generate speech, speech generates mind, mind generates dharmata generating yogin hence called generation.

[14381-14430]
Actions channels perform: Roma displays radiance of pure essence lamp, through impurity performs action of dripping urine. Kyangma projects pure essence upward displaying lamp's own appearance causing experience and growth, impurity projected downward causes precious feces to be discarded. Kundarma projects pure essence upward actually displaying ultimate bodhicitta allowing impurity to flow downward causing relative bodhicitta bindu to flow. Male flows called contact destruction of touch through meeting bliss, experiencing bindu falling before time destroys bliss. Females blocked by five types and abiding contact increases called expanding where bliss expands insatiably. Females menstruate arising from channel tip's transformation actual blood flowing. Through elements keypoint if menstruation flows at wrong time disturbed by disease; if flows twice or three times in month womb transforms; if always flows in month's upper part son develops; if in lower part daughter; if interrupted with large and small children do not come; if blood's viscosity and color yellow few children come; if color black with feces odor many sons and daughters develop; if odorless and unfelt hermaphrodite comes.

[14431-14480]
Essence of channels: Roma's essence is bliss possessing special skillful means, through essence of dharmata's purity of apprehended object liberates. Kyangma's essence is emptiness, through wisdom's purity liberates apprehending mind's thought into dharmata. Kundarma's essence is non-dual bliss-emptiness, through non-dual union displays natural flow of wisdom liberated from subject-object. Dharmata of channels: Roma has dharmata of taking food and separating food's pure and impure causing digestion; if passage wide person has large stomach, if narrow small stomach, if crooked always vomiting not taking food with many sudden diseases. Kyangma causes body's heat to rise and fall; if channel narrow body naturally hot, if wide small and always cold. Kundarma displays category of body's thirst and non-thirst as dharmata; if narrow one never thirsty, if wide great thirst, if crooked displays various uncertain actions; if suddenly becoming very thin various diseases of body speech and mind without autonomy arise. Skilled in Roma's keypoint cuts food attachment transforming into samadhi food; Kyangma cuts clothing attachment endowing with warmth; central cuts thirst attachment dreams cease engaging in clear light meaning. These three have great keypoints.

[14481-14527]
Instructions on training channels: body and Roma combined cause body to form as nirmanakaya, abiding as sambhogakaya, dissolving as dharmakaya, mandala of three kayas of body. Kyangma with speech: abiding speech is samadhi, expressed speech is concentration, exhausted speech is dharmata of these, secret mantra's own sound of syllables. Kundarma with mind's movement combined with pure recollection's dharmata causes former and later thoughts to self-cease and self-liberate, combined with self-arisen wisdom objects and conditions liberate into dharmata, recollection and thought self-cease manifesting as dharmata's intention. Pearl Garland states: body is mandala of three kayas, whatever spoken is mantra speech, whatever thought is samadhi. Through piercing channel's maturity channel's own characteristics ascertained. Through seeking location dharmata arising from channels recognized. Through knowing channel's time of transformation death and birth locations recognized. Through immersing in channel's nature wheel of samadhi mind not separated. Through maintaining measured warmth of warming channel one becomes food yogin. Through calculating channel's transformation one becomes clothing yogin. Through relying on keypoint of projecting channel habitual patterns' continuum ceases, channel's keypoint extremely profound.
