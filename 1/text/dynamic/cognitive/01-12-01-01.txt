[13831-13850]
Structural opening establishing three-part framework: general exposition, particular classifications, practical application. The text positions itself as tantric instruction from Pearl Garland source. Naming etymology appears here first—roma derives from ro (flavor) and ma (mother), indicating experiential extraction through desire-based mechanism. The gloss on "flavor" as few activities introduces the central paradox: binding through illusion while remaining inexpressible. View register is clearly Dzogchen-sems (mind class) with strong tantric channel-wind apparatus. Risk: "mother" translation may evoke maternal personification—preserve as nominal suffix indicating ground-function.

[13851-13870]
Kyangma etymology establishes straight hollow as structural descriptor—not bending, not branching. The dual bindu causation (ultimate and relative) marks this channel as pivotal for ripening and separation. Kyangma as "mo" (female) indicates foundation-function, not gender. Kundarma etymology follows: "ku" from gathering all (bindu, channel-bliss, wind-bliss), "darma" from pervading all generally. These three are mother-channels—ground of all other channels. Risk: lateral asymmetry (right/left) maps to relative/absolute in ways that may misread as literal sideplacement. Preserve functional distinction, not anatomical fixedness.

[13871-13900]
Detailed anatomical specification of channel pathways. Roma coils from navel rightward; Kyangma emerges from heart-tip through throat network to left eye; Kundarma central with three tips at Brahma's aperture. The right tip enters right ear moving karma-wind; left tip enters left ear causing wisdom-wind to dawn. Critical: nostrils moving with karma-wind supports Avadhuti meditation—preserves practical application frame. Risk: "gate at Brahma's aperture" may reify as literal skull opening. Note this as conceptual landmark, not surgical target.

[13901-13940]
Four subtle knots in Roma: navel (generation), memory (mother's red bindu), flavors (wind bindu), tip (light bindu). Each knot corresponds to progressively refined drop-size (mustard seed divided, then tenth). Generation knot holds father's white causal bindu—body develops upward from this. Structure shows developmental sequence from coarse to subtle. Risk: "blood to regenerative fluid" chain may read as literal physiological transformation. Preserve as energetic progression map, not biochemical process.

[13941-13980]
Kyangma's four knots: generation (water-lamp seeds like rabbit eyes), memory (fire bindu), flavors (five-colored light bindu), tip (emptiness bindu). When gates pure: four lamps manifest; when impure: four elements arise. This purity-impurity correspondence maps directly to practice outcome. The ultimate undefiled wisdom dawns through these gates. Risk: "deity's mandala on mustard seed" may seem metaphorical but functions as literal visualization instruction. Note for consistency with tantric visualization vocabulary.

[13981-14030]
Kundarma as gathering of channel-nature, ground of samsara and nirvana. Four knots: generation (body-size mustard seed with face and arms), memory (celestial palace mandala), flavors (wrathful mandala), tip (all lights). The central channel without blood or serum indicates empty wind activity. Right side circulates water, blood, bodhicitta; left side circulates element-essences and wisdom. Risk: anatomical right/left may misalign with conventional Western anatomical orientation. Preserve original lateral specification.

[14031-14080]
Classification section begins: eight-part structure (names, purifiers, indicators, generation methods, activities, essence, dharmata, training). Channel numbers: 72,000 general, 64 at generation, 16 at memory (making 80), 32 at flavors (making 112), 360 at tip (making 472 with four wheels). These numbers function as structural architecture—preserves enumeration exactly. Three channels emerge straight like life-trees from four wheels—outer support of body/speech/mind, inner connects vajras, secret ground for three kayas.

[14081-14120]
Roma, Kyangma, Kundarma contain OM, AH, HUM when pure (ground for three kayas), when impure (ground for ordinary body/speech/mind), through perversion (door for three poisons). Etymology section expands: Roma tastes supreme food-flavor when cut, becomes corpse-flavor when left in nature—male right/female left placement. Kyangma pulls dharmas free of thought-experience; hollow when unworked—male left/female right. Kundarma sustains body/speech/mind activity. Risk: "male/female" here refers to practitioner type, not biological sex essentialism. Preserve as functional category.

[14121-14160]
Female channel types enumerated with vivid metaphors: deer-channel (bluish, short, beautiful teeth, round face), elephant-trunk type (pale, straight yellow hair, thin, prominent navel), lotus-possessor (black, coarse, unpleasant), line-marked (blue-green, sharp teeth, long eyes/face), conch-possessor (yellow, short, clear brow-space). Each type has specific channel configuration and corresponding liberation method. Risk: racialtypological language requires careful handling—these are energy-pattern descriptors, not ethnic classifications. Preserve as yogic typology.

[14161-14200]
Female-specific illness categories: 101 wisdom-race channels, five races within fetus-consuming worm, ten illness types in menses, five illnesses of engagement, five of vessel-holding, seven of abiding seed—32 total, not found in males. Note contextual claim: females surpass males in vessel womb, non-flowing seeds, worm activities. This establishes gender-specific physiological architecture. Risk: modern readers may find this dismissive—preserve as period-specific somatic theory without apologetic gloss.

[14201-14240]
Channel purifiers: Roma proficient purifies bodily activities; Kyangma purifies speech; Kundarma purifies mind. Indicators: Roma indicates bliss as thought-free (memory exhausts through dependent origination wheel); Kyangma indicates clarity non-dual with flavor (singular bindu meaning); Kundarma indicates union without difference (means-bliss and wisdom-emptiness united). Right indicates means, left indicates wisdom, center indicates non-dual. Risk: "non-dual beyond extremes" phrase may accumulate philosophical baggage. Preserve bare syntactic claim.

[14241-14280]
Generation functions: Roma generates body from four elements, father's cause and water, mother's condition fire and wind—separating pure and impure. Kyangma generates speech—if straight, pleasant voice and clear signs; if branched, voice cracks or stammers. Yogis transform through channel oral instructions. Kundarma generates mind—crookedness produces distraction, branches produce sharp mind with forgetfulness, thick-thin produces fluctuation, emptiness produces virtue and wisdom. Risk: "empty channel" technical term may read as nihilistic emptiness. Preserve as specific energy configuration.

[14281-14320]
Activities: Roma pure shows lamp-radiance, impure drips bile. Kyangma pure attracts upward showing self-appearance (experience and increase), impure moves downward discarding bile. Kundarma pure shows ultimate bodhicitta, impure causes relative bodhicitta flow. Males actually release (contact-destruction), females gather and increase (increasing contact). Menses details: nose-channel movement, blood flow, element essential point timing—male/female determination through flow timing. Risk: physiological details may appear as folk medicine—preserve as period-specific somatic theory.

[14321-14360]
Essence: Roma bliss (means liberating to dharmata), Kyangma emptiness (wisdom liberating apprehending mind), Kundarma bliss-emptiness non-dual (union liberating from apprehender/apprehended). Dharmata: Roma takes food and separates pure/impure (wide passage large belly, narrow small, crooked vomits); Kyangma bodily heat fluctuation (narrow great heat, wide cold); Kundarma thirst varieties (narrow never thirsty, wide great thirst, crooked various illnesses). Risk: bodily function correlation may read as literal diagnostic system. Preserve as energetic correspondence map.

[14361-14400]
Training methods: Roma body-forming (Sambhogakaya), abiding (Nirmana), dissolving (Dharmakaya)—three-kaya mandala. Kyangma speech-abiding samadhi, expression meditation, exhaustion shows dharmatas, sound syllables of secret mantra. Kundarma mind-movement, memory-thought pure dharmata, thoughts self-liberate, objects/conditions liberate to dharmata. Channel-leap time determines death-transference and rebirth. Risk: these are condensed oral instruction summaries—preserve compression without expanding into practice manual.

[14401-14460]
Four wheels establishment: first from water activity (blood, serum, saliva, tears), second from earth activity (muscle, organ meat), third from fire activity (heat element), fourth from wind activity (breath, ascending/descending). Generation transforms male/female; memory transforms life-length; flavors transforms enjoyment; tip transforms pure/impure senses and migrator relationships. Attraction/gathering/leap distinctions produce body size, strength, mind brightness, speech quality, accomplishment. Risk: element theory uses pre-modern physics—preserve as systematic correspondence without modernization.

[14461-14500]
Four wheels certainty: one and two don't ripen empowerment/path/result; three also doesn't ripen. Connection sequence establishes outer four elements, inner four wisdoms, secret four lamps, supreme four kayas. Body/speech/mind/consciousness four, four purifiers, four result fruits—certainty grounds four wheels. Individual classifications: navel Nirmanakaya wheel (four: general, limb, essential point, correction), heart Dharmacakra wheel, throat Sambhogakaya wheel, crown great bliss wheel. Risk: wheel-to-kaya mapping may oversimplify—preserve as pedagogical correlation, not metaphysical identity.

[14501-14560]
Navel wheel detail: root channel, six petals, four water-channels branching to countless petals. Channel certainty classifications: element, mind, ignorance, mind (lethargy-gathering), small wheel petals thirty-eight with eightfold transformation (2,432 total). Root and limb: nirmana wheel sixty-four petals. Element channels five aspects hold body ground; water channels gather pure essence; fire channels gather fire essence; wind channels gather wind essence; mind channels gather breath/consciousness; ignorance channels show fluid connections; space-mind channels gather pure essence; lethargy-gathering channels six gather objects/ignorance. Risk: numeric enumeration precise—preserve exactly.

[14561-14620]
Outer channel limbs: nirmana wheel transforms outward through right-left petals (great garland-like channels), behind knee depressions (black light-possessing), calf center (gold-color), ankle-joint (extremely subtle great channels). Total channel count: sixty-four great channels at nirmana nature wheel, subordinate channels unimaginable. Gathering channels ten perform agitation/holding; wisdom channels eight hold consciousness portion; remainder karma/affliction channels fifty (karma ten, affliction forty). Risk: these are counts for structural mapping—preserve exact numbers.

[14621-14680]
Affliction channels detail: forty channels (ignorance ten, mind ten, three poisons ten, remainder imputed). Mind channels: three hold objects, four gathering-object mind, remainder thought-possessing. Mind channels ten: two thorough seeking, two definitely establishing, three definitely placing, remainder consciousness. Three poison channels: three generating desire, three attachment-free delusion, four ripening hatred. Gathering channels: two phlegm, two wind, two bile serum, remainder gathering. Risk: this taxonomy uses period categories—preserve without modern psychological reinterpretation.

[14681-14720]
Particular essential points: sixty-eight nirmana channels (root three plus four light channels naturally sixty-four). Five suitable-for-cutting channels: uncut five defects, cut five defects. Twelve leaping channels, seven death channels if bled, seven defect channels if not bled. Five suitable-for-cauterizing: cautery produces defects. Four suitable-for-stirring: stirring produces defects. Remainder no benefit/harm. Risk: "defect" here means energetic imbalance, not moral failure—preserve technical usage.

[14721-14780]
Illness correction methods: navel wheel essential point below knee-joint four fingers (black shin channel, voice-stopping, SU letter), left (small shin face, SUU), four fingers further right (black kidney channel, SHE), left (black serum channel), calf center right (long calf-end, KSH E), left (short calf-end, SHA), buttock-top (elephant-method illness, SHA tail), left (hollow chattering, KSHA), ankle outer-joint right (left calf-end, KHA tail), left (embracing kidney channel, KHAM). Risk: letter-mandala visualization detailed—preserve exact letter sequences without explanation.

[14781-14840]
Cauterizing locations: TI TI (crown-edge), LA LAA (thigh-hollow), SA SAA (kidney-hollow), SHA SHA (black intermediate), NYA AI (shoulder-top), HUM (worm-short), RA RAA (kidney), NGA PA (navel front-back), RAM HA (below/above navel-hole), U E (excrement/urine gates), KSHA (buttock-lung). Method: pressing with thumb, drawing upward with breath, filling with letters, meditating. Risk: this is specific tantric practice—preserve as technical instruction for translator awareness only, not as recommendation.

[14841-14890]
Outcome: food/clothing conceptions cease in two years. Channel pressing combinations: RA HUM (thigh inside, mind won't wander), TA LA (vajra top-bottom, bindu cause-movement ceases), SHA (vajra tip, abandon desire). Gong-seized body: reciting and pressing gathers illness uprooted from root. Letter colors: right/left essential points, hot/cold white/red. Risk: these represent condensed oral transmission—preserve compression, note that implementation requires authentic transmission.

[14891-14927]
Closing summation repeats "Thus it is" three times—emphatic closure through formulaic assertion. Channel essential points across all four wheels complete this exhaustive structural exposition. The text moves from general to particular, from anatomical to functional, from theory to practice. Risk: exhaustive enumeration may exhaust translators—note pacing for English rendering. Preserve formulaic closing without philosophical interpretation.
