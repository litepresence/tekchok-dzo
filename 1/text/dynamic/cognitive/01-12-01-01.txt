Channel exposition three divisions: general presentation of channel nature, detailed explanation of various categories, explanation of practice methods. Pearl Garland citation: rtsa rnams ni thig le ste—channels possess bindus, 'phra dang 'khyug pa'i bdag nyid can—having nature of subtle vibration and pulsation, 'od zer nyid kyis mdzes pa—adorned by light rays themselves. Three aspects: g.yas dang g.yon dang dbus ma—right, left, and central. Three principal channels: Ro ma extracts all tastes like salt—ro len pa—generating bliss experience—thig le'i bde ba la brten nas nyams su myong ba thun mong ma yin pa skye bar byed—called ma as mother. Kyangma lacks crookedness or branches—'khyog dang yal ga med—straight and isolated like arrow—reeng bu—called mo as ground of all. Kundarma gathers everything—kun 'dus pa—pervading whole generally. Structural function: anatomical-energetic framework for subtle body practice. View register: channels as energetic supports for recognition, not physical structures. Translation risk: anatomical literalism losing energetic significance. Preservation: functional characteristics over physical location.

Location specifications. Ro ma coils from left of navel—lte ba'i g.yon nas 'khyil—moving to right—rgyu la. Kyangma emerges from left of heart's tip—snying ga'i rtse mo'i g.yon nas 'thon—exits throat's channel web—mgrin pa rtsa'i drva ba—enters from within skull—thod pa'i nang nas tshur zhugs—emerges from left eye—mig g.yon pa nas sgo dod. Ro ma from right eye—mig g.yas pa nas. Kundarma abides straight in center—dbus na drang por gnas—dividing into three tips at crown's Brahma aperture—dbu ma tshangs pa'i bu ga—where body of awareness without thought manifests—rig pa rtog pa med pa'i sku 'char. Right tip pierces right ear causing karma wind to vibrate—las kyi rlung 'gyu. Two subtle branches pierce both nostrils causing karma wind functions to vibrate, wind enters avadhuti serving as basis for wind samadhi. Left tip pierces left ear causing wisdom wind to manifest—ye shes kyi rlung 'char. Left channel has natural bindu—rang bzhin gyi thig le, right has relative bindu—kun rdzob kyi thig le. Right relying on relative bindu matures body performing bliss, suffering, equanimity, elemental growth and decline. Four subtle knots—mdud pa phra mo bzhi—within: at navel—lte ba, dranpa, tastes—ro rnams, and tip—rtse mo. Structural function: precise subtle body cartography. View register: energetic pathways for consciousness movement.

[13931-13980]
At generation place—skye byed—within channel, father's white bindu—pha'i rgyu thig le dkar po—cause abides size of mustard seed—yungs 'bru—divided into ten parts—bcur bgos pa. Relying on this body grows upward hence called cause—rgyu. At dranpa, mother's red bindu condition—ma'i rkyen thig le dmar po—abides size of mustard seed's tenth part, dranpa abides as support for transforming into various forms. At tastes—ro rnams, wind bindu—rlung gi thig le—abides size of mustard seed's tenth part, separates pure from impure—dangs snyigs 'byed—discarding impurities outside while pure essence generates body's radiance and vitality—bkra dang gzi mdangs bskyed. At tip—rtse mo, mind-nature light bindu—sems kyi rang bzhin 'od kyi thig le—abides size of mustard seed's tenth part. These are called supports of relative—kun rdzob kyi rten. When they transfer—'phos, body and mind separate. From relative cause blood matures—khrag tu smin, from blood flesh—sha, from flesh serum—chu ba, from serum lymph—chu ser, from lymph marrow—tsil bu, from marrow marrow fluid—rkang, from marrow fluid channels—rgyungs pa, from channels relative bindu matures. Structural function: embryological-energetic developmental sequence.

[13981-14030]
Kyangma's four knots—rkyang ma'i mdud pa bzhi: at generation—skye byed, seed of distant water lamp's—rgyang zhag chu'i sgron ma'i sa bon—two small shimmering eyes abide. At dranpa, support of self-arisen wisdom's lamp—shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma'i rten—blazing fire bindu—me'i thig le rab tu 'phro ba—abides. At tastes, support of pure realm—dbyings rnam dag gi rten—five-colored bindu with aureole—'od lnga'i thig le yungs 'bru tsam mu khyud dang bcas pa—abides. At tip, support of empty bindu—thig le stong pa'i rten—individual light bindus—'od kyi thig le so so'i tshon—abide in respective colors. Relying on these ultimate unconditioned wisdom manifests—don dam zag pa med pa'i ye shes mngon du 'char, relying on these one attains natural Buddhahood—rang bzhin du sangs rgya—called natural bindu—rang bzhin gyi thig le. When gates pure they are four lamps—sgron ma bzhi, when impure become four elements—'byung ba bzhi. Kundarma is gathering of nature of all channels—rtsa thams cad kyi rang bzhin 'dus pa, vibrates through projection and withdrawal of wind—rlung gi 'phen sdud kyis 'dar ba, being ground of samsara and nirvana—'khor 'das kyi gzhi—called ma as mother. Four knots: at generation, support of all kayas—sku thams cad kyi rten—abides as body size of mustard seed with clear light face and hands—'od kyi zhal phyag tu gsal ba. At dranpa, support of wisdom—ye shes kyi rten—palace with four gates—sggo bzhi, four porticoes—rta babs bzhi, individual body colors and hand implements of deities—lha so so'i sku mdog dang phyag mtshan—abides as complete mandala. At tip, mandala of wrathful deities—khro bo'i dkyil 'khor, support of all lights—'od thams cad kyi rten—abides. Central channel lacks blood and lymph—khrag dang chu ser med pa, empty and open—stong pa zang thal—performing wind function—rlung gi las. Structural function: central channel as ground of realization.

Detailed categories: general presentation of three principal channels nature, detailed explanation of four chakras distinctions. Talgyur citation: lus kyi gnad ni rtsa yin te—body keypoint is channels, gnas dang bkod pa 'gyu ba—location and arrangement vibration, 'khor lo'i rten dang lus kyi srog—chakras' support and body life-force, ming dang bye brag rgyu dang rkyen—name and category cause and condition, byed pa'i las dang mtshan nyid—performing actions and characteristics, nyon mongs las dang ye shes las—afflictive actions and wisdom actions, las la brten nas mgon snang ba—manifest appearances through reliance on actions, nad dang 'byung ba'i bye brag—disease and element distinctions, 'khrug mar gnas pa'i mtha yis dbye—abiding as agitation divisions. Through blocking—gtems—they cease, through pressing—btsir—they bind, through suppressing—mnan—they control vital points—gnad la gcud, through piercing—gcus—they are known, through projection—'phul—they are grasped by emptiness—stong la drags, through violence—drag—they are captured. Thus through channels keypoints abode of Buddhahood indicated. Explanation has eight parts: names of channels, their purifiers, what they indicate, how they generate, what actions they perform, their essence, their dharmata, instructions on how to train them.

[14081-14130]
Generally 72,000 channels abide in body—rtsa stong phrag bdun cu rtsa gnyis. Specifically at generation place 64, at dranpa 16 making 80, at tastes 32 making 112, at tip 360 making 472. When four chakras combined this is special summary—khyad par du bsdus pa. At center of four chakras three channels arise straight like life-trees—srog shing—without crookedness—'khyog med. Externally serve as support of three body speech and mind—phyir lus ngag yid gsum gyi rten byed. Internally connect boundaries of three kayas speech and mind—nang du sku gsung thugs kyis mtshams sbyor. Secretly serve as basis for manifestation of three kayas—gsang bar sku gsum gyi 'char gzhi byed. Three channels Ro ma Kyangma Kundarma. Within these three abide Om Ah Hum—Om Ah Hum gsum gnas. When pure serve as ground for maturing three kayas speech and mind—dag pas sku gsung thugs gsum du smin pa'i gzhi byed. When impure serve as ground for maturing body speech and mind—ma dag pas lus ngag yid gsum smin pa'i gzhi byed. When perverted—phyin ci log pas—open door for manifestation of three poisons—dug gsum 'char ba'i go 'byed.

[14131-14180]
Ro ma so-called because through blocking it tastes supreme food—gtems pas zas mchog dang 'dra ba'i ro myong bar byed, naturally abiding like taste of dead unable to perform function—shi ba'i ro dang 'dra ste don byed mi nus. Dwells at right side of male and left side of female—skyes pa'i g.yas la bud med kyi g.yon na. Some texts reverse—go zlog—different intention—dgongs pa gzhan. Kyangma so-called because through control—gcud pas—gives rise to thought-free dharmata experience—chos rtog bral gyi nyams skye, naturally abiding unrelated to others remaining isolated—gzhand dang mi 'brel zhing reeng bur gnas. Dwells at left side of male and right side of female—skyes pa'i g.yon bud med kyi g.yas. Kundarma dwells in center of both male and female—skyes pa dang bud med gnyi ga'i dbus. Through pressing—btsir—gives rise to manifest wisdom experience—ye shes gsal ba'i nyams skye, naturally abiding performs function of sustaining body speech and mind—lus ngag yid gsum gyi skyong ba'i las su byed. Because these three channels are mother-ground of all channels—rtsa thams cad kyi gzhi ma—called ma.

[14181-14230]
Five female channel types—bud med rigs can lnga—with distinct characteristics: deer types—ri dgs can—with bluish color—mdog smug, short stature—bongs thung, good teeth—so legs, round faces—byad zlum. Elephant-trunk types—glang sna ma'i rigs—with white complexion—mdangs dkar, thin yellow hair—skra li zhing ser, slender bodies—lus phra, full abdomens—ltem. Lotus types—padma can—with black color—mdog nag, coarse limbs—yan lag rags, rough faces—gdong rtsub. Striped types—ri mo can—with blue-green color—mdog sngon bsangs, tight teeth—so thags dam, long eyes—mig dang byad dkyus ring, yellow hair—skra ser. Conch types—dung can ma—with yellow color—mdog ser, small stature—bongs chung, thin teeth—so srab, clear brow space—smin mtshams gsal.

[14231-14280]
Deer types have channel thick at root with excessive desire but fine tip unable to emit bodhicitta, instructions on moving channel through bindu keypoints—thig le'i gnad lam du byed—primary. Elephant-trunk types have channel tip facing upward from navel—lte ba nas—unable to descend with bodhicitta, less desire arises from divided channels—rtsa byer pa, instructions on straightening channel—rtsa rkyang ba—primary. Lotus types have channels like open lotus—padma kha bye ba—with rounded mouths unable to descend with bodhicitta, being long bliss is great, instructions on opening channel mouth—rtsa kha 'byed pa—primary. Striped types have channels like drawn lines—ri mo bris pa—happy to dance—gar dga' dga'—with great bliss of taste from start, being woven—rtsa spra—bodhicitta does not emerge, having many branches whatever touched generates, instructions on gathering channel—rtsa sdud pa—primary. Conch types have channels coil to right like conch—dung g.yas su 'khyil ba—unable to descend with bodhicitta, being coiled—rtsa 'khyil—taste of desire not found, instructions on separating channel—rtsa gseng ba—primary. Thirty-two different disease types in females not found in males, arising from container being more in females, non-flowing seed, actions of many demons. Kundarma dwelling unchanging in center of both indicates great perfection natural ground for all.

[14281-14330]
Purifiers of three channels—dag byed: being skilled in Ro ma's keypoint—gnad la mkhas—purifies all body actions, Kyangma purifies speech, Kundarma purifies actions done by mind. What channels indicate—mtshon pa: Ro ma indicates non-conceptual bliss—rtog med bde ba, through relying on that rotating wheel of dependent origination—rten 'brel gyi 'khor lo bskor—dranpa ceases becoming like aspect of taste hence called Ro ma. Kyangma indicates single taste—ro gcig pa—through clarity abiding in meaning of single bindu—thig le nyag gcig. Kundarma indicates non-dual union—zung 'jug dbyer med—skillful means bliss and wisdom emptiness in union, conventional and ultimate in union, being non-dual and free from extremes—dbyer med mu mtha' dang bral ba—called pure view—rnam dag gi lta ba. Right indicates skillful means—g.yas pas thabs mtshon, left indicates wisdom—g.yon pas shes rab mtshon, center indicates non-duality—dbus mas dbyer med mtshon.

[14331-14380]
How channels generate—skye tshul: Ro ma generates body from beginning through action of four elements. From father's cause and water through maturation and entering channel wheel's action grasps body's ground. From mother's condition through fire and wind's maturation and channel wheel's action body's pure and impure separated generating body. Four chakras abide as eight causes and conditions gathering assembly of eight consciousnesses performing preparation of places for spreading. Kyangma generates speech: if straight without crookedness speech pleasant and signs clear; if subtle branches voice carries far but short or signs unclear and stammering comes. Naturally lacks branches and crookedness. From ten channels going to gag and up and down, from same channel having thick and thin upper and lower sections voice has many peaks and interruptions. If channel has curves speech slurred and shaking comes; if open speech hollow and swallowing sound comes.

[14381-14430]
Kundarma generates mind: if channel has much crookedness mind always distracted cannot focus; if branches mind sharp but forgetful; if thick and thin sections awareness has much fluctuation cannot remain one-pointed doing many activities without stable basis; if channel open whatever thought becomes virtuous endowed with wisdom and intelligence; if lacks thick and thin sections and straight mind stable without fluctuation; if goes to right much thought; if to left always abiding in doubt and indecision; if tip transforms always much suffering and mental discomfort; if channel pierced mind always light and diligent in virtue; if channel wide always great effort and completed endeavors. Body generates channels, channels generate speech, speech generates mind, mind generates dharmata generating yogin hence called generation.

[14431-14480]
Actions channels perform: Ro ma displays radiance of pure essence lamp—dangs ma'i sgron ma'i mdangs snang, through impurity performs action of dripping urine. Kyangma projects pure essence upward displaying lamp's own appearance causing experience and growth, impurity projected downward causes precious feces to be discarded. Kundarma projects pure essence upward actually displaying ultimate bodhicitta allowing impurity to flow downward causing relative bodhicitta bindu to flow. Male flows called contact destruction of touch through meeting bliss, experiencing bindu falling before time destroys bliss. Females blocked by five types and abiding contact increases called expanding where bliss expands insatiably. Females menstruate arising from channel tip's transformation actual blood flowing. Through elements keypoint if menstruation flows at wrong time disturbed by disease; if flows twice or three times in month womb transforms; if always flows in month's upper part son develops; if in lower part daughter; if interrupted with large and small children do not come; if blood's viscosity and color yellow few children come; if color black with feces odor many sons and daughters develop; if odorless and unfelt hermaphrodite comes.

[14481-14527]
Essence of channels—ngo bo: Ro ma's essence is bliss possessing special skillful means—thabs khyad can, through essence of dharmata's purity of apprehended object liberates. Kyangma's essence is emptiness—stong pa, through wisdom's purity liberates apprehending mind's thought into dharmata. Kundarma's essence is non-dual bliss-emptiness—bde stong dbyer med, through non-dual union displays natural flow of wisdom liberated from subject-object. Dharmata of channels—chos nyid: Ro ma has dharmata of taking food and separating food's pure and impure causing digestion; if passage wide person has large stomach, if narrow small stomach, if crooked always vomiting not taking food with many sudden diseases. Kyangma causes body's heat to rise and fall; if channel narrow body naturally hot, if wide small and always cold. Kundarma displays category of body's thirst and non-thirst as dharmata; if narrow one never thirsty, if wide great thirst, if crooked displays various uncertain actions; if suddenly becoming very thin various diseases of body speech and mind without autonomy arise. Skilled in Ro ma's keypoint cuts food attachment transforming into samadhi food; Kyangma cuts clothing attachment endowing with warmth; central cuts thirst attachment dreams cease engaging in clear light meaning. These three have great keypoints.
