[1] [10722] <ornament> First: If one asserts that the basis is singular like the variety of appearances, there is the fault of that singular basis arising outwardly as variety. For if the ground were truly one, how could it manifest as the ten thousandfold display? The singular cannot become manifold—this is the logical consequence of such assertion.

[2] [10723] <ornament> Second: If one asserts that the basis is multiple like the variety of appearances, there is the fault of that manifold basis failing to account for singular experience. For if the ground were truly many, how could there be unified consciousness? The manifold cannot become singular—this too has logical consequences.
