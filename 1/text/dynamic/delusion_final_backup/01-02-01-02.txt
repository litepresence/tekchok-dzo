[892-894]
[COSMOLOGY-LITERALIZATION] [CONTAINER WORLD REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
The systematic cosmological architecture (mountains, continents, oceans with precise measurements) interpreted as literal geography to be mapped like a physical atlas.

**Why it arises:**
The detailed measurements (sum 'gyur, phyed phyed phri ba) suggest empirical observation. The orderly arrangement mirrors geographical mapping conventions.

**Primary consequence:**
*ril gyis shar* (arising from accumulation) becomes geological process rather than karmic manifestation. The container world (*snod*) is confused with physical space.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners search for Mount Meru on Earth. Cosmology becomes archaeology. The visionary architecture collapses into cartography.

**Cascade effects:**
<mount-meru-physicalization>
<four-continents-nationalism>
<cosmic-tourism>
<directional-superstition>
<measurement-fetishism>

[895-897]
[MOUNT-MERU-PHYSICALIZATION] [CENTRAL AXIS REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
*ri rab* (Mount Meru) interpreted as an actual physical mountain at Earth's center—a colossal geological formation made of precious substances.

**Why it arises:**
The detailed descriptions (lcags las grub pa, gnya' shing 'dzin) read like geological reports. The gold and jewel composition suggests literal mineralogy.

**Primary consequence:**
The axis mundi mutates into a destination. Pilgrimage becomes geographical rather than psychological. The central channel of subtle body is externalized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Expeditions search for Meru's location. Measurements are applied to physical cartography. The symbolic center is confused with geographic center.

[FOUR-CONTINENTS-NATIONALISM] [JAMBUDVIPA IDENTIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
*gling bzhi* (four continents)—especially *'dzam bu'i gling* (Jambudvipa)—interpreted as referring to India or South Asia specifically, with other continents as actual world regions.

**Why it arises:**
Buddhism's Indian origins suggest Jambudvipa = India. The geographical descriptions seem to match ancient worldviews. The triangular shape of Lus 'phags gling resembles India.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual hierarchy becomes national pride. India warps into the "center of the spiritual world." Other regions are spiritually peripheral by geography.

**Secondary consequences:**
Cultural chauvinism masquerades as cosmology. Missionary work becomes continental conquest. Local traditions are delegitimized by "wrong continent" status.

**Cascade effects:**
<directional-superstition>
<cosmic-xenophobia>
<geographic-spiritual-superiority>
<continental-racism>

[901-903]
[DIRECTIONAL-SUPERSTITION] [CARDINAL POINTS SPIRITUALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
The four directions (shar, nub, byang, lho) interpreted as having inherent spiritual significance—East as "spiritual," West as "material," etc.

**Why it arises:**
The detailed descriptions of each continent include moral and karmic characteristics. Shar (East) hosts enlightened beings. This suggests directional power.

**Primary consequence:**
Architecture requires facing specific directions. Travel becomes spiritually dangerous in wrong directions. Feng shui replaces insight.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ritual orientation becomes obsessive. Buildings face East regardless of function. Geographical "auspiciousness" determines residence.

**Cascade effects:**

<astrological-directions>
<spatial-purity>
<alignment-anxiety>

[904-906]
[CONTINENT-SHAPE-DETERMINISM] [MORPHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION]
**Misreading:**
The distinctive shapes (triangle, circle, square, semicircle) interpreted as determining the character of inhabitants rather than being symbolic topologies.

**Why it arises:**
Lus 'phags gling is triangular like a human torso. Ba glang spyod is circular. The shapes seem to encode psychological traits.

**Primary consequence:**
Shape becomes destiny. Triangular people have specific characteristics. Geography determines psychology rather than the reverse.

**Secondary consequences:**
Stereotyping by "continental type." Body types determine spiritual capacity. Morphology replaces merit as destiny-determinant.

**Cascade effects:**
<body-type-spiritual-hierarchy>
<morphological-racism>
<geographic-determinism>

[907-909]
[SATELLITE-CONTINENT-OBSESSION] [SECONDARY GEOGRAPHY FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
The smaller "satellite" continents (rnga yab, g.yo ldan, lam mchog 'gro) interpreted as literal places to visit or be reborn in, with their own spiritual tourism industries.

**Why it arises:**
Their existence suggests more destination options. The descriptions are tantalizingly brief. "Half of half" dimensions suggest accessibility.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual attention fragments. Practitioners aspire to "better" satellite realms. The main continents seem insufficient.

**Secondary consequences:**
Literature proliferates about minor realms. Practitioners seek teachers from specific continents. Rebirth strategies multiply.

**Cascade effects:**
<cosmic-tourism-expansion>
<rebirth-destination-shopping>
<spiritual-colonialism>

[910-912]
[NORTHERN-CONTINENT-UTOPIANISM] [SGRA MI SNYAN IDEALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
*Sgra mi snyan* (northern continent) interpreted as an actual utopia where suffering is minimal and spiritual practice effortless—a place to aspire to.

**Why it arises:**
Descriptions of effortless virtue and spontaneous pleasure. The square shape suggests stability. No mention of major suffering.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners aspire to northern rebirth. Earthly utopian communities claim to replicate it. The challenges of practice seem optional.

**Secondary consequences:**
Disappointment with current location. Spiritual bypassing through "northern consciousness." Practice aversion justified by geography.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-escapism>
<utopian-community-fantasies>
<practice-avoidance>
<northern-identification>

[SAMSAra-LOCATION-REIFICATION] [REALM PLACE CONFUSION]
**Misreading:**
The six realms (*lha*, *mi*, *lha min*, *dmyal ba*, *yi dvags*, *byol song*) interpreted as actual locations in space rather than psychological conditions or perceptual modalities.

**Why it arises:**
They're described with geographical coordinates. Hell is "below," heaven "above." The spatial arrangement suggests physical places.

**Primary consequence:**
Rebirth is understood as travel. Meditation becomes teleportation. Psychological transformation collapses into location change.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Visiting" realms through visualization becomes literal travel aspiration. Astral projection industries emerge. Realm hierarchy is spatialized.

**Cascade effects:**
<realm-tourism>
<astral-projection-obsession>

[916-918]
[HELL-REALM-LITERALIZATION] [DAMYAL BA PHYSICALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
*Dmyal ba* (hell realms) interpreted as actual subterranean locations with fire and ice, navigable like caverns, rather than psychological states of intense suffering.

**Why it arises:**
Specific depth measurements (dpag tshad nyi khri nyi khri). Located under Gang Ti-se. Eight hot and eight cold hells catalogued like caves.

**Primary consequence:**
Fear of literal descent. Moral behavior becomes avoiding "falling down." The psychological intensity of rage/anguish is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Hell becomes geological hazard. Moral panic about "sinking." Spiritual practice is defensive rather than transformative.

**Cascade effects:**
<moral-panic>
<defensive-spirituality>
<hell-anxiety>
<subterranean-obsession>
<geological-morality>

[919-921]
[HUNGRY-GHOST-SPATIALIZATION] [YI DVAGS LOCATION FIXATION]
**Misreading:**
*Yi dvags* (hungry ghosts/pretas) interpreted as literally living underground or invisibly among humans, rather than representing psychological states of insatiable craving.

**Why it arises:**
Root location specified (rgyal po'i khab 'og). Some described as living among gods and humans. Specific spatial coordinates.

**Primary consequence:**
Craving becomes location problem. "Just don't go there." The ubiquitous nature of attachment is ignored.

**Secondary consequences:**
Superstitions about "preta territories." Fear of the invisible. Desire is externalized rather than examined.

**Cascade effects:**
<invisible-world-paranoia>

[922-924]
[ANIMAL-REALM-NATURALIZATION] [DUD 'GRO REIFICATION]
**Misreading:**
*Dud 'gro* (animal realm) interpreted as referring only to non-human animals in forests and oceans, rather than the psychological condition of instinct-driven existence.

**Why it arises:**
Specific mention of ocean locations. Animals catalogued like zoology. The scattering (*kha 'thor*) seems like migration.

**Primary consequence:**
Human exceptionalism. "At least I'm not an animal" comfort. The animalistic aspects of human mind are denied.

**Secondary consequences:**
Speciesism justified by cosmology. Animals as "lower realm" beings. Human cruelty rationalized by "just animals."

**Misreading:**
*Lha min* (asuras/titans) interpreted as a warrior race literally living inside Mount Meru, with whom one can identify or whose battles are literal cosmic conflicts.

**Why it arises:**
Specific location given (ri rab kyi chu mtshams). Descriptions of envy and warfare. The "subterranean palace" sounds habitable.

**Primary consequence:**
Jealousy is spatialized. Envy becomes "asura nature." Spiritual warriors identify with asura aggression. War is cosmologically legitimized.

**Secondary consequences:**
Militaristic spirituality. "Divine jealousy" as virtue. Conflict with "gods" is normalized. Aggression is romanticized.

**Cascade effects:**

**Why it arises:**
Descriptions of palaces (*pho brang*), pleasure gardens (*skyed mos tshal*), wish-fulfilling trees (*dpag bsam gyi shing*). The beauty is seductive.

**Primary consequence:**
Heaven becomes spiritual goal. Practice is for "earning" rebirth there. The trap of divine pleasure is ignored.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual materialism. Merit accumulation for tickets. Disappointment with earthly practice. Addictive pleasure-seeking.

**Cascade effects:**

[931-932]
[GOD-REALM-ATTACHMENT] [LHA REBIRTH ADDICTION]
**Misreading:**
The superior pleasures and longevity of *lha* (gods) interpreted as something to actively pursue through merit, rather than a trap that prevents liberation.

**Why it arises:**
Descriptions of infinite pleasure. Long lifespans. Beautiful bodies. The god realm seems like success.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual practice is instrumentalized for rebirth. Liberation is postponed for pleasure. Attachment masquerades as aspiration.

**Secondary consequences:**
Moralistic accumulation. Fear of falling from heaven. The whole point of Dharma—freedom from all realms—is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<merit-inflation>
<heaven-anxiety>
<pleasure-spirituality>
<rebirth-attachment>
<divine-narcissism>

[933-934]
[SEVEN-MOUNTAIN-HIERARCHY] [RI BDUN CLIMBING METAPHOR]
**Misreading:**
The seven golden mountains (*ri bdun*) surrounding Meru interpreted as literal climbing stages—each higher level representing spiritual advancement.

**Why it arises:**
Sequential arrangement. Higher = better spatial logic. The seven numbers correspond to spiritual "stages."

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual progress is verticalized. "Climbing the mountain" becomes literal. Horizontal integration is neglected.

**Secondary consequences:**
Hierarchy obsession. Status by "altitude." Lower levels are denigrated. The circular equality around the center is missed.

**Misreading:**
The descriptions of celestial palaces (*pho brang*)—made of gold, jewels, precious substances—interpreted as literal architecture rather than symbolic representations of purified mind.

**Why it arises:**
Specific architectural details (gser gyi sa gzhi, bang rim). Named structures like "gser ldan grong khyer." The opulence is catalogued.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual wealth is externalized. Architecture replaces insight. The palace of mind is confused with buildings.

**Secondary consequences:**
Materialistic spirituality. Building projects as practice. Opulent temples justified. Wealth display as virtue signal.

**Why it arises:**
Names emphasize pleasure. Descriptions of beautiful landscapes. Sensory delights are catalogued.

**Primary consequence:**

[WISH-FULFILLING-TREE-DEPENDENCY] [DPAG BSAM SHING EXTERNALIZATION]
**Misreading:**
The wish-fulfilling tree (*dpag bsam gyi shing*) interpreted as an actual tree that grants desires, rather than a symbol of self-sufficient contentment and the mind's creative power.

**Primary consequence:**
External source for satisfaction is sought. Contentment is delegated to objects. The mind's power is projected outward.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual consumerism. "Manifestation" teachings. The real work of transforming mind is replaced by wish-making.
