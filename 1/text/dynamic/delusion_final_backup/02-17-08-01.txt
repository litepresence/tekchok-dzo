[3057-3077] <trekcho-nature-investigation> <khregs-chod-rang-bzhin>

**Misreading:**
The nature (*rang bzhin*) of Trekcho interpreted as object to investigate analytically.

**Why it arises:**
"Nature" suggests quality. "Investigation" implies analysis. Scientific mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Nature-analysis: treating Trekcho as research subject. Natural nature obscured by objectification.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm investigating the nature of Trekcho"
- Missing that nature is not object
- Reifying analysis as path
- Intellectualization

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-nature-investigation> → <objectification> [making object] → <intellectualization> [analyzing] → <natural-nature-miss> [nature not object]

[3077-3095] <essence-nature-compassion-trinity> <ngo-bo-rang-bzhin-thugs-rje>

**Misreading:**
The essence-nature-compassion triad interpreted as theological trinity to conceptualize.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests triad. "Essence" implies substance. Theological thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Trinitarian-theology: intellectually grasping three-aspects. Natural simplicity obscured by complexity.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Essence is empty, nature is luminous, compassion is pervasive"
- Missing that description points beyond
- Reifying three as metaphysical
- Doctrinal debate

**Cascade effects:**
<trinitarian-theology> → <metaphysical-reification> [making real] → <doctrinal-debate> [arguing] → <natural-simplicity-miss> [beyond three]

[3095-3115] <empty-essence-void-fear> <ngo-bo-stong-pa>

**Misreading:**
"Essence is empty" interpreted as terrifying nihilistic void.

**Why it arises:**
"Empty" suggests absence. "Essence" implies core. Void-terror.

**Primary consequence:**
Emptiness-terror: fear of empty essence. Natural emptiness obscured by nihilism.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "There is no essence, just void"
- Missing that emptiness is fullness
- Reifying void as nothingness
- Existential despair

**Cascade effects:**
<empty-essence-terror> → <nihilism-fear> [nothingness] → <existential-despair> [meaningless] → <natural-emptiness-miss> [empty is full]

[3115-3123] <luminous-nature-clarity-attachment> <rang-bzhin-gsal-ba>

**Misreading:**
"Nature is luminous" interpreted as special clarity to achieve or maintain.

**Why it arises:**
"Luminous" suggests light. "Nature" implies quality. State-achievement.

**Primary consequence:**
Clarity-achievement: pursuing luminous state. Natural luminosity obscured by acquisition.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to achieve luminous clarity"
- Missing that luminosity is ever-present
- Reifying clarity as special state
- Light-chasing

**Cascade effects:**
<luminous-nature-attachment> → <clarity-chasing> [seeking light] → <state-acquisition> [getting luminosity] → <natural-luminosity-miss> [always luminous]

[3057-3070] <cutting-through-aggression> <khregs-chod-khros-pa>

**Misreading:**
"Cutting through" interpreted as aggressive destruction of obstacles.

**Why it arises:**
"Cutting" suggests violence. "Through" implies penetration. Aggressive culture.

**Primary consequence:**
Aggressive-cutting: attacking obstacles. Natural gentle cutting obscured by force.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I must destroy my delusions"
- Missing that cutting is gentle recognition
- Reifying practice as battle
- Self-aggression

**Cascade effects:**
<cutting-aggression> → <obstacle-destruction> [fighting] → <self-aggression> [attacking self] → <natural-gentleness-miss> [cutting is kind]

[3070-3085] <thogal-direct-vision-achievement> <thod-rgal-mngon-sum>

**Misreading:**
Thogal (*thod rgal*) interpreted as spectacular visionary achievement to attain.

**Why it arises:**
"Direct" suggests immediate. "Vision" implies special seeing. Spectacle-desire.

**Primary consequence:**
Vision-achievement: pursuing spectacular direct seeing. Natural directness obscured by spectacle-hunting.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I want the Thogal visions"
- Missing that Thogal is natural seeing
- Reifying visions as goal
- Disappointment with ordinary

**Cascade effects:**
<thogal-vision-achievement> → <spectacle-hunting> [chasing visions] → <disappointment-ordinary> [not special] → <natural-directness-miss> [seeing is direct]

[3085-3100] <trekcho-thogal-sequentiality> <khregs-chod-sngon-thod-rgal-phyi>

**Misreading:**
Trekcho first, Thogal second interpreted as mandatory sequence.

**Why it arises:**
"First/second" suggests order. Sequential learning models. Developmental thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Sequence-obsession: waiting to finish Trekcho before Thogal. Natural simultaneity obscured by ordering.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I must complete Trekcho before Thogal"
- Missing that both are simultaneous aspects
- Reifying order as essential
- Sequential delay

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-thogal-sequence> → <completion-waiting> [finishing first] → <sequential-delay> [not ready] → <natural-simultaneity-miss> [always both]

[3100-3123] <basis-display-duality> <gzhi-snang-gnyis>

**Misreading:**
The basis and display (*gzhi snang*) interpreted as fundamental dualism.

**Why it arises:**
"Basis" suggests ground. "Display" implies appearance. Dualistic language.

**Primary consequence:**
Ground-appearance-dualism: separating basis from display. Natural non-duality obscured by distinction.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "The basis is empty, display is illusory"
- Missing that basis is display
- Reifying distinction as real
- Philosophical separation

**Cascade effects:**
<basis-display-duality> → <philosophical-separation> [dividing] → <ground-appearance-hierarchy> [basis better] → <natural-non-duality-miss> [never two]
