[2539-2542] <vehicle-elitism> <sravaka-dismissal>
**Misreading:**
The Sravaka vehicle described as seeking "liberation for oneself alone" interpreted as selfish individualism to be morally condemned, rather than recognizing it as an appropriate path for certain capacities.

**Why it arises:**
Mahayana rhetoric emphasizes compassion for all beings. "Self-liberation" sounds selfish. Moral superiority of bodhisattva path seems obvious.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners develop spiritual arrogance, looking down on Theravada practitioners as "selfish" while lacking actual attainment themselves.

**Secondary consequences:**
The profound Sravaka analysis is dismissed. Foundation practices are skipped. Dzogchen becomes Mahayana chauvinism without substance.

**Cascade effects:**
<sectarian-superiority> → looking down on others
<foundation-neglect> → skipping basics
<moral-posturing> → compassion signaling
<vehicle-contempt> → dismissing valid paths

[2543-2551] <atomistic-reification> <partless-particle-fetish>
**Misreading:**
The Vaibhasika "partless atoms" (*rdul phran cha med*) interpreted as Buddhist physics confirming the ultimate existence of smallest units—substantialism smuggled into analysis.

**Why it arises:**
Atoms sound scientific. "Partless" suggests fundamental reality. Reductionism feels like thorough analysis.

**Primary consequence:**
Dharmas are substantialized into ultimate particles. The emptiness of all phenomena is missed while practitioners believe they've found "what really exists."

**Secondary consequences:**
Abhidharma becomes physics. Meditation focuses on analyzing matter into atoms. The uncompounded nature is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<scientific-materialism> → Buddhist physics
<reductionist-fixation> → analyzing to atoms
<substantialist-dharma> → partless particles as real
<analytical-obsession> → endless decomposition

---

[2552-2558] <conventional-ultimate-dualism> <two-truth-reification>
**Misreading:**
The distinction between conventional truth (*kun rdzob bden pa*) and ultimate truth (*don dam bden pa*) interpreted as establishing two levels of reality—conventional illusion vs. ultimate reality.

**Why it arises:**
"Two truths" suggests two kinds of truth. The terminology invites hierarchical thinking. Western metaphysics debates appearance vs. reality.

**Primary consequence:**
Conventional reality is devalued as "mere appearance." Ultimate truth solidifies into special domain to access. Non-duality is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek "ultimate experience." Daily life is dismissed as conventional. The emptiness of both truths is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<hierarchical-dualism> → ultimate > conventional
<experience-seeking> → wanting ultimate
<appearance-dismissal> → devaluing conventional
<truth-reification> → two realities

---

[2559-2566] <momentary-reification> <instantaneous-substantialism>
**Misreading:**
The Sautrantika "momentary dharmas" (*skad cig ma*) interpreted as establishing the ultimate truth of momentary existence—time-slices as fundamental reality.

**Why it arises:**
"Momentary" sounds precise. Momentariness is a key Buddhist doctrine. Reduction to moments feels like ultimate analysis.

**Primary consequence:**
Time solidifies into discrete moments. Continuity is denied. The emptiness of time itself is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation becomes moment-tracking. Experience is chopped into instants. Natural flow is replaced by analytical fragmentation.

**Cascade effects:**
<temporal-atomism> → moments as real
<continuity-denial> → rejecting flow
<analytical-fragmentation> → chopping experience
<instant-fixation> → momentary obsession

---

[2567-2574] <four-noble-truths-ontologization> <truth-entities>
**Misreading:**
The four noble truths (*bden pa bzhi*) interpreted as describing four ultimate facts about existence—ontological claims about how reality is structured.

**Why it arises:**
"Truths" suggests facts. "Noble" implies profundity. The fourfold structure invites systematic understanding.

**Primary consequence:**
Suffering, origin, cessation, and path are substantialized into cosmic principles. The pedagogical nature of the truths is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Buddhism becomes worldview about four facts. Practice becomes aligning with truth-structure. Direct recognition is replaced by truth-belief.

**Cascade effects:**
<doctrinal-fundamentalism> → believing truths
<ontological-buddhism> → four facts about reality
<truth-fetishism> → worshipping doctrine
<propositional-fixation> → truths as claims

---

[2575-2584] <antidote-accumulation> <medication-model>
**Misreading:**
The specific antidotes (impurity for desire, love for anger, dependent arising for delusion) interpreted as spiritual medications to be applied—technique accumulation for affliction-management.

**Why it arises:**
"Antidote" (*gnyen po*) suggests medicine. Specific remedies appeal to problem-solving minds. Buddhist practice includes many techniques.

**Primary consequence:**
Meditation becomes symptom-treatment. Practitioners accumulate antidotes for every affliction. Recognition is replaced by technique application.

**Secondary consequences:**
Tool-kit spirituality develops. "Which antidote for my anger?" becomes obsessive. The root of afflictions (self-grasping) is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-accumulation> → collecting antidotes
<symptom-management> → treating surface
<medication-obsession> → applying remedies
<affliction-cataloging> → classifying problems

---

[2585-2597] <faculty-hierarchy> <capacity-elitism>
**Misreading:**
The three faculties (dull, medium, sharp) interpreted as establishing spiritual castes—sharp practitioners as superior, dull as defective.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchy feels natural. "Sharp" sounds better than "dull." Comparative psychology uses similar categories.

**Primary consequence:**
Capacity is moralized into superiority. Practitioners compete over "faculty-level." Shame or arrogance develops based on self-assessment.

**Secondary consequences:**
Teachers rank students by faculty. Practitioners fake sharpness. Self-acceptance is lost in favor of capacity-anxiety.

**Cascade effects:**
<spiritual-caste> → faculty as identity
<capacity-shame> → feeling dull
<competitive-faculty> → proving sharpness
<hierarchy-internalization> → superior/inferior

---

[2598-2606] <rhinoceros-romanticism> <solitude-fetish>
**Misreading:**
The Pratyekabuddha as "rhinoceros-like" (*bse ru lta bu*) solitary practitioner interpreted as idealizing isolation—withdrawal from society as spiritually superior.

**Why it arises:**
Solitude sounds pure. Social entanglements seem defiling. Romantic images of hermits appeal.

**Primary consequence:**
Community is devalued. Social engagement is seen as obstacle. Withdrawal becomes spiritual achievement.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners abandon relationships. Social responsibility is rejected. "Alone in the mountains" becomes goal.

**Cascade effects:**
<isolation-obsession> → avoiding people
<social-aversion> → rejecting community
<hermit-romanticism> → cave fantasy
<engagement-denial> → refusing participation

---

[2607-2618] <bodhisattva-vow-burden> <savior-complex>
**Misreading:**
The bodhisattva vow to liberate all beings interpreted as literal obligation creating crushing responsibility—impossible task generating guilt.

**Why it arises:**
"All beings" is vast number. Vow sounds like contract. Empathy creates desire to help.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners develop savior complex or guilt complex. "I must save everyone" becomes crushing burden or grandiose claim.

**Secondary consequences:**
Burnout and despair. Impossibility creates depression. Or: impossible attainments are claimed. Balance is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<savior-complex> → must save all
<vow-guilt> → failing beings
<impossible-burden> → overwhelming responsibility
<grandiose-claim> → pretending success

---

[2619-2632] <six-perfections-accumulation> <paramita-shopping>
**Misreading:**
The six perfections (*pha rol tu phyin pa drug*) interpreted as six qualities to acquire through practice—accumulation project spanning countless lifetimes.

**Why it arises:**
"Perfections" suggests completion. Six items invite checklist. "Transcendent" sounds advanced.

**Primary consequence:**
Perfection becomes acquisition goal. Practitioners try to "get" generosity, morality, etc. The already-perfect nature is forgotten.

**Secondary consequences:**
Lifetimes of accumulation projected. Recognition deferred to future. Present moment availability missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<perfection-accumulation> → getting qualities
<lifetimes-project> → endless practice
<paramita-checklist> → completing six
<acquisition-spirituality> → gathering virtues

---

[2633-2650] <ground-stage-obsession> <bhumi-ladder>
**Misreading:**
The ten grounds (*sa bcu*) and five paths (*lam lnga*) interpreted as mandatory curriculum—practitioner must progress through each sequentially.

**Why it arises:**
Stages suggest development. Progress feels tangible. Educational conditioning assumes sequence.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes stage-obsession. "Which ground am I on?" replaces recognition. Hierarchy develops.

**Secondary consequences:**
Comparison with others. Ranking by apparent stage. Authentic practice lost to progression-anxiety.

**Cascade effects:**
<stage-obsession> → tracking progress
<ground-hierarchy> → higher is better
<progression-anxiety> → am I there yet
<developmental-fixation> → climbing ladder

---

[2651-2660] <tathagatagarbha-essentialism> <buddha-nature-substantialism>
**Misreading:**
The Tathagatagarbha system "Buddha-nature endowed with virtues from beginning" interpreted as confirming essential self—permanent Buddha-core as true identity.

**Why it arises:**
"From the beginning" sounds eternal. "Endowed with virtues" suggests possession. Atman-like language invites self-identification.

**Primary consequence:**
Buddha-nature solidifies into essential self. The emptiness of buddha-nature is missed. Atman-doctrine smuggled in.

**Secondary consequences:**
"I have Buddha-nature" becomes self-identification. Purification of adventitious defilements becomes cleaning the self. Dzogchen becomes Hinduism.

**Cascade effects:**
<buddha-nature-atman> → essential self
<possession-error> → having buddha-nature
<purification-project> → cleaning the self
<essentialism-appropriation> → atman in Buddhist guise

---

[2661-2680] <empowerment-dependence> <external-bestowal>
**Misreading:**
The tenth ground empowerment by Buddhas interpreted as literal transmission requiring external validation—buddhahood impossible without others' blessing.

**Why it arises:**
"Empowerment" suggests power transfer. "Surrounded by Buddhas" sounds like ceremony. Ritual frameworks expect external validation.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition is made dependent on external authority. Practitioners wait for empowerment rather than recognizing nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Guru-dependence intensifies. Self-recognition is distrusted. External ritual replaces direct insight.

**Cascade effects:**
<empowerment-obsession> → seeking blessings
<external-validation> → needing approval
<authority-dependence> → cannot recognize alone
<ritual-substitution> → ceremony over insight

Page 2539-2680 presents the three vehicles (Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva) with their respective paths, grounds, and systems. This is foundational doxography that continues into subsequent pages analyzing result vehicles (tantra) and Dzogchen.



**CONTINUITY NOTE:** Lines 2681+ transition to result vehicle (tantra) analysis. The vehicle framework established here continues but becomes increasingly subtle as Atiyoga is approached.
