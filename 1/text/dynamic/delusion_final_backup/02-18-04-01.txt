[4468-4492] <nirmanakaya-posture-physicalism> <sprul-sku-bzhugs-stangs-materialization>

**Misreading:**
The Nirmanakaya posture (*sprul sku'i bzhugs stangs*)—sitting like a rishi—interpreted as requiring precise physical geometry, creating posture-perfectionism.

**Why it arises:**
"Posture" suggests form. "Rishi" implies specific shape. Physicalism: "Must sit exactly right."

**Primary consequence:**
Posture-perfectionism: forcing body into position. Recognition is replaced by anatomical fixation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Discomfort from forced posture
- "Is my heel position correct?" checking
- Missing that posture supports recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<nirmanakaya-posture-physicalism> → <posture-perfectionism> [form fixation] → <anatomical-anxiety> [correct position] → <support-function-miss> [posture as aid]

[4468-4492] <method-wisdom-dualism> <thabs-shes-rab-separation>

**Misreading:**
The joining of feet representing method and wisdom (*thabs dang shes rab*) interpreted as establishing dualism between compassion and emptiness, creating conceptual practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Method" suggests activity. "Wisdom" implies understanding. Dualistic thinking: "Two things to unite."

**Primary consequence:**
Method-wisdom-dualism: treating compassion/emptiness as separate. Non-duality replaced by unification-project.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm practicing method and wisdom"
- Missing that they were never separate
- Conceptual meditation on union

**Cascade effects:**
<method-wisdom-dualism> → <method-wisdom-separation> [two to unite] → <unification-project> [effort to join] → <never-separate-miss> [already non-dual]

[4468-4492] <grasping-rejecting-wind-suppression> <gzung-'dzin-las-rlung-force>

**Misreading:**
Pressing soles to ground to stop grasping-rejecting winds (*gzung 'dzin las kyi rlung*) interpreted as forceful suppression through muscular effort, creating wind-control obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Pressing" suggests force. "Stop" implies suppression. Control-pattern: "I must hold these winds."

**Primary consequence:**
Wind-suppression: forceful stopping of natural flow. Natural ease replaced by muscular control.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Physical tension in feet/legs
- "Are my winds stopped?" checking
- Missing that release is natural

**Cascade effects:**
<grasping-rejecting-wind-suppression> → <wind-control> [forceful stopping] → <muscular-tension> [holding winds] → <natural-release-miss> [ease as allowing]

[4493-4522] <sambhogakaya-posture-passivity> <longs-sku-nyal-luks-dullness>

**Misreading:**
The Sambhogakaya posture (*longs sku'i bzhugs stangs*)—lying like an elephant—interpreted as permission for laxity and dullness, creating sleep-practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Lying" suggests rest. "Elephant" implies heaviness. Laziness-attractor: "I can just relax."

**Primary consequence:**
Lying-dullness: practice becomes sleepy relaxation. Recognition is obscured by torpor.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Falling asleep during practice
- "Lying down is easier" avoidance
- Missing that posture maintains alertness

**Cascade effects:**
<sambhogakaya-posture-passivity> → <lying-dullness> [sleepy practice] → <torpor-practice> [relaxation over clarity] → <alertness-miss> [posture as wakefulness]

[4493-4522] <five-sense-purification-achievement> <longs-spyod-lnga-dag-pa-goal>

**Misreading:**
"Enjoying/purifying five senses" (*'dod yon lnga dag par byed*) interpreted as achieving special sensory purification, creating sense-enhancement obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Enjoy" suggests pleasure. "Purify" implies improvement. Hedonistic pattern: "I want pure senses."

**Primary consequence:**
Sense-achievement: seeking purified perception. Natural clarity replaced by sensory enhancement.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My senses aren't pure enough"
- Preference for "higher" perceptions
- Missing that purity is natural

**Cascade effects:**
<five-sense-purification-achievement> → <sense-achievement> [seeking purity] → <enhancement-obsession> [improving perception] → <natural-clarity-miss> [purity as nature]

[4523-4546] <dharmakaya-posture-aggression> <chos-sku-seng-ge-force>

**Misreading:**
The Dharmakaya posture (*chos sku'i bzhugs stangs*)—lion posture—interpreted as requiring aggressive/powerful sitting, creating forceful practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Lion" suggests power. "Posture" implies strength. Aggression-attractor: "I must be powerful."

**Primary consequence:**
Lion-aggression: forceful authoritative sitting. Natural confidence replaced by dominance-posturing.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Physical tension from "power"
- "I'm the lion" identity-fixation
- Missing that confidence is natural

**Cascade effects:**
<dharmakaya-posture-aggression> → <lion-aggression> [forceful sitting] → <dominance-posturing> [power display] → <natural-confidence-miss> [confidence as ease]

---

[4523-4546] <three-kaya-progression> <sku-gsum-rim-pa-hierarchy>

**Misreading:**
The three kayas' postures interpreted as progressive stages (Nirmanakaya → Sambhogakaya → Dharmakaya), creating advancement-fixation.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests sequence. Postures imply levels. Hierarchical thinking: "Dharmakaya is highest."

**Primary consequence:**
Kaya-hierarchy: preferring Dharmakaya posture. Natural display replaced by status-seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I should practice Dharmakaya only"
- Looking down on "lower" postures
- Missing that all three are simultaneous

**Cascade effects:**
<three-kaya-progression> → <kaya-hierarchy> [status ranking] → <posture-preference> [discriminating] → <simultaneous-display-miss> [three as one]

[4547-4558] <future-liberation-projection> <ma-'ongs-dus-grol-ba-deferral>

**Misreading:**
The postures as "signs of future liberation" (*ma 'ongs pa'i dus na grol ba'i brda*) interpreted as establishing future-orientation, deferring recognition.

**Why it arises:**
"Future" suggests later time. "Liberation" implies goal. Deferred-achievement: "I will be liberated."

**Primary consequence:**
Future-projection: waiting for later liberation. Immediate recognition is replaced by timeline-anxiety.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "When I'm liberated..." deferral
- Missing that liberation is now
- Practice as preparation for future

**Cascade effects:**
<future-liberation-projection> → <future-projection> [later achievement] → <timeline-anxiety> [when will it happen?] → <immediate-liberation-miss> [liberation as present]

---

[4547-4558] <element-temperature-determinism> <byung-ba-grang-tsha-physiology>

**Misreading:**
Matching posture to body temperature (*grang dro snyoms*) interpreted as rigid physiological determinism, creating body-obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Cold/hot" suggests condition. "Match" implies requirement. Medicalization: "My elements determine my practice."

**Primary consequence:**
Temperature-fixation: choosing posture based on physical condition. Recognition replaced by somatic cartography.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm too cold for Dharmakaya"
- Missing that any posture works
- Element-obsession over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<element-temperature-determinism> → <temperature-fixation> [condition matching] → <somatic-cartography> [element tracking] → <any-posture-miss> [recognition independent]

[4559-4561] <posture-magic> <lta-stangs-magical-effect>

**Misreading:**
The postures (*lta stangs*) interpreted as magical positions that mechanically produce wisdom, creating posture-superstition.

**Why it arises:**
"Posture" suggests position. "Wisdom" implies result. Magical thinking: "Sit like this, get wisdom."

**Primary consequence:**
Posture-magic: treating position as cause-effect. Recognition is replaced by positional fetish.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I did the posture, where's wisdom?"
- Missing that posture supports, doesn't cause
- Superstition over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<posture-magic> → <posture-superstition> [mechanical cause] → <positional-fetish> [form over nature] → <support-function-miss> [posture as condition]

[4562-4565] <snake-coiling-analogy-misunderstanding> <sbrul-gyi-rkang-lag-literalization>

**Misreading:**
The snake coiling analogy (*sbrul gyi rkang lag gcu na mngon pa*) interpreted as establishing that posture "reveals" hidden wisdom, creating revelation-fantasy.

**Why it arises:**
"Coil" suggests hidden. "Reveal" implies discovery. Treasure-fantasy: "Posture reveals my wisdom."

**Primary consequence:**
Revelation-fantasy: expecting posture to unveil hidden treasure. Natural display replaced by discovery-obsession.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Where is my hidden wisdom?"
- Missing that wisdom is openly present
- Seeking what was never hidden

**Cascade effects:**
<snake-coiling-analogy-misunderstanding> → <revelation-fantasy> [hidden treasure] → <discovery-obsession> [seeking unveiling] → <open-presence-miss> [wisdom never hidden]

[4566-4600] <three-posture-limitation> <bzhugs-stangs-gsum-restriction>

**Misreading:**
"Only three postures" (*gsum kho nar nges*) interpreted as rigid limitation, creating anxiety about "correct" posture choice.

**Why it arises:**
"Only" suggests restriction. "Three" implies set. Rule-following: "Must choose from these three."

**Primary consequence:**
Posture-limitation: rigid adherence to three forms. Natural movement replaced by selection-anxiety.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Which of the three should I use?" obsession
- Missing that three are pedagogical
- Form-constraint over naturalness

**Cascade effects:**
<three-posture-limitation> → <posture-limitation> [rigid form] → <selection-anxiety> [which one?] → <pedagogical-function-miss> [three as pointers]

---

[4566-4600] <hundred-thousand-postures-confusion> <brgya-stong-bzhugs-stangs-proliferation>

**Misreading:**
The possibility of hundreds/thousands of postures (*brgya stong*) interpreted as requiring mastery of endless variations, creating posture-proliferation anxiety.

**Why it arises:**
"Hundreds/thousands" suggests vast set. "Postures" implies techniques. Overwhelm: "Too many to learn!"

**Primary consequence:**
Posture-proliferation-anxiety: overwhelmed by options. Recognition is blocked by choice-paralysis.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I can't learn all these postures"
- Missing that three are sufficient
- Technique-accumulation over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<hundred-thousand-postures-confusion> → <posture-proliferation-anxiety> [overwhelmed] → <choice-paralysis> [too many options] → <three-sufficiency-miss> [three as complete]
