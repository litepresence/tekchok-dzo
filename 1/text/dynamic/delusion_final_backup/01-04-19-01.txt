[3994-3999] <temporal-misunderstanding> [THREE TIMES AS PROGRESSION]
**Misreading:**
The three times (before: error not experienced, now: not dwelling, later: error impossible) are interpreted as developmental stages of practice that one progresses through.

**Why it arises:**
Temporal projection. Sequential description invites developmental reading. "Before/now/later" suggests progression.

**Primary consequence:**
Chronologizing realization. The practitioner believes they evolve through these three stages.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring "error impossibility" to future; measuring current stage; missing that all three describe timeless nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through stage model.
<progress-tracking> through temporal measurement.

[3997-4003] <non-dual-confusion> [SAMSAIRA/NIRVANA ONENESS AS MERGER]
**Misreading:**
"Basis of samsara and nirvana is one" is interpreted as establishing that samsara and nirvana are ultimately the same thing or merge into each other.

**Why it arises:**
Unity fetishism. "One" suggests identity. "Non-dual" interpreted as "same" rather than "not two."

**Primary consequence:**
Conflating samsara/nirvana. The practitioner believes samsara "is" nirvana, leading to complacency about confusion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual bypassing; "it's all the same" dismissal; missing that "one basis" means single ground of display, not identity.

**Cascade effects:**
<eternalistic-error> through oneness-fetishism.
<fundamental-delusion> through conflating confusion/liberation.

[4004-4006] <bindu-reification> [BINDU AS ENTITY]
**Misreading:**
"Bindu brought to self-abiding" and "alone, without parts" is interpreted as establishing bindu (thig le) as singular entity or point-like essence.

**Why it arises:**
Atomistic thinking. "Alone, without parts" suggests indivisible unit. Tantric visualization uses bindus.

**Primary consequence:**
Point-entity view. The practitioner believes there is a "bindu" that is the essence of mind.

**Secondary consequences:**
Concentration on point; bindu-visualization obsession; missing that bindu is metaphor for non-conceptual simplicity.

**Cascade effects:**
<essence-grasping> through bindu-reification.
<meditationism-error> through point-concentration.

[4007-4014] <lineage-elitism> [EAR LINEAGE AS EXCLUSIVE]
**Misreading:**
The distinction between ear lineage (snyan rgyud) and explanation lineage is interpreted as establishing ear lineage as superior, esoteric transmission requiring special access.

**Why it arises:**
Esoteric temptation. "Ear lineage" suggests secret transmission. Exclusivity appeals to spiritual ambition.

**Primary consequence:**
Transmission-elitism. The practitioner believes ear lineage is "higher" and seeks secret pointing-out.

**Secondary consequences:**
Guru-shopping for ear lineage; dismissing explanatory teachings; spiritual materialism of exclusive access.

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through transmission-fetishism.
<elitism-error> through lineage-hierarchy.

---

[4010-4014] <faculty-fetishism> [EAR FACULTY AS REQUIREMENT]
**Misreading:**
"Connected to ear faculty" is interpreted as establishing hearing as special sense door for transmission, implying oral instruction is uniquely effective.

**Why it arises:**
Sensory literalism. Faculty language suggests physiological basis. Hearing instruction seems more direct than reading.

**Primary consequence:**
Oral-dependency. The practitioner believes they must receive teachings orally, devaluing written transmission.

**Secondary consequences:**
Access anxiety (can't meet teacher); format-snobbery; missing that "ear" is metaphor for direct reception, not literal hearing.

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through oral-transmission fixation.
<access-anxiety> through meeting-teacher requirement.

---

[4013-4014] <syllable-confusion> [WITH/WITHOUT SYLLABLES AS HIERARCHY]
**Misreading:**
The division into transmission "with syllables" and "without syllables" is interpreted as hierarchy, with syllable-less being "higher" or more advanced.

**Why it arises:**
Progressive thinking. "Without syllables" sounds more refined. Wordless pointing seems "beyond" verbal teaching.

**Primary consequence:**
Syllable-denigration. The practitioner believes wordless transmission is superior, dismissing verbal teachings.

**Secondary consequences:**
Anti-intellectualism; seeking silent pointing; missing that both are pedagogical tools, not levels.

**Cascade effects:**
<elitism-error> through wordless-supremacy.
<anti-intellectualism> through syllable-rejection.

---

[4020-4033] <cycle-hierarchy> [FOUR CYCLES AS STAGES]
**Misreading:**
The four cycles (outer, inner, secret, unsurpassable secret) are interpreted as progressive stages one advances through, with secret cycles as "higher."

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking. "Secret" suggests advanced. Numbered sequence implies progression.

**Primary consequence:**
Cycle-climbing. The practitioner seeks to advance from outer to unsurpassable secret cycles.

**Secondary consequences:**
Premature secret practice; cycle-elitism; missing that cycles describe aspects of single nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<elitism-error> through cycle-hierarchy.
<practice-path-confusion> through premature advancement.

---

[4026-4028] <poison-fetishism> [FIVE POISONS AS PATH]
**Misreading:**
"Five poisons dwell as path-vehicles" is interpreted as license to indulge afflictions, believing they are "already" the path.

**Why it arises:**
Anti-nomian temptation. Freedom from abandoning poisons suggests indulgence. Spiritual libertinism finds confirmation.

**Primary consequence:**
Poison-indulgence. The practitioner acts out afflictions believing they are "practicing" the path.

**Secondary consequences:**
Harmful behavior; "affliction as wisdom" excuse; missing that "dwelling as path" requires recognition, not indulgence.

**Cascade effects:**
<ethical-nihilism> through poison-license.
<extreme-view> through affliction-indulgence.

---

[4029-4033] <tree-metaphor-literalism> [GROWTH METAPHORS AS DEVELOPMENT]
**Misreading:**
The tree metaphors (root, trunk, flower, fruit) are interpreted as establishing developmental stages of spiritual growth one progresses through.

**Why it arises:**
Organic growth model. Tree metaphors suggest natural development. Familiarity with "spiritual growth" tropes.

**Primary consequence:**
Developmental fixation. The practitioner believes they grow from root (beginner) to fruit (enlightenment).

**Secondary consequences:**
Progress-tracking by stage; deferring fruit to future; missing that metaphors describe simultaneous aspects.

**Cascade effects:**
<progress-tracking> through growth-stages.
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through organic model.

---

[4034-4043] <simultaneity-confusion> [POINTING OUT AND REALIZATION AS EVENT]
**Misreading:**
"Pointing out and realization attained simultaneously" is interpreted as promise that pointing-out automatically produces realization in that moment.

**Why it arises:**
Causal expectation. "Simultaneously" suggests immediate effect. Desire for instant enlightenment.

**Primary consequence:**
Pointing-out dependency. The practitioner believes realization happens automatically during pointing-out ceremony.

**Secondary consequences:**
Disappointment when not realized; ritual-pointing obsession; missing that simultaneity describes nature, not event.

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through pointing-out fetishism.
<disappointment-avoidance> through ritual-expectation.
