[4156-4169] <body-conduct-technique> <lus-kyi-spyod-pa-manipulation>
**Misreading:**
The bodily conduct (*lus kyi spyod pa*) instructions interpreted as techniques to perform—specific physical movements, gestures, and postures that mechanically produce spiritual results.

**Why it arises:**
"Conduct" suggests behavior. Specific movements (walking, sitting, gestures) sound like instructions. Physical practice feels tangible. Methods promise results.

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct becomes physical technique. Practitioners try to "do" the movements correctly, believing this constitutes practice. The spontaneous expression is replaced by deliberate performance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Physical performance anxiety
- Comparing "conduct quality" with others
- Missing that conduct is awareness's natural expression
- Creating new persona: "Dzogchen practitioner who moves like..."

**Cascade effects:**
<technique-obsession> → perfecting movements
<performance-anxiety> → doing it right
<physical-fetishism> → body as tool
<recognition-prevention> → doing obscures being

[4170-4183] <body-liberation-physicalism> <lus-ru-shan-actual-separation>
**Misreading:**
"Separating the body into parts" (*lus ru shan 'byed pa*) interpreted as literal anatomical dissection or visualization practice—actually breaking down the body concept.

**Why it arises:**
"Separate" suggests division. "Parts" implies anatomy. Visualization practices do deconstruct body. Analytical meditation is common.

**Primary consequence:**
Liberation becomes physical deconstruction. Practitioners try to "see through" the body analytically. The metaphorical nature is literalized.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anatomical visualization obsession
- Trying to "dissect" body in meditation
- Missing that "separation" means non-attachment, not visualization

**Cascade effects:**
<anatomical-obsession> → body parts
<visualization-technique> → seeing through
<literal-deconstruction> → breaking down
<recognition-prevention> → analysis obscures direct seeing

[4184-4205] <time-bound-practice> <dus-gsum-scheduling>
**Misreading:**
The specific durations (7 days, 11 days, half-month) interpreted as mandatory time requirements—practice must be done for these exact periods to work.

**Why it arises:**
Numbers suggest requirements. "Days" implies schedule. Retreat traditions use time structures. Commitment feels serious.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes time-bound obligation. "I must do 7 days" creates pressure. The timeless nature is replaced by temporal performance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Schedule anxiety: "Did I do enough days?"
- Missing that recognition is instantaneous
- Quantifying practice by time spent

**Cascade effects:**
<time-obsession> → counting days
<duration-anxiety> → not long enough
<quantification-error> → time = progress
<recognition-prevention> → waiting for completion

---

[4206-4214] <nuance-accomplishment> <rnal-du-beb-pa-achievement>
**Misreading:**
"Accomplishing nuance/relaxation" (*rnal du 'bebs pa*) interpreted as skill to develop—learning to relax or be natural as practice goal.

**Why it arises:**
"Accomplish" suggests achievement. "Relaxation" sounds desirable. Effort paradox: trying to relax. Self-improvement culture.

**Primary consequence:**
Nuance becomes accomplishment. Practitioners try to "get relaxed," creating tension. The naturally relaxed is obscured by seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Am I relaxed enough?" anxiety
- Effort toward effortlessness
- Missing that nuance is always already the case

**Cascade effects:**
<relaxation-goal> → trying to relax
<effort-paradox> → striving to be effortless
<achievement-orientation> → getting nuance
<recognition-prevention> → seeking obscures presence

---

[4215-4234] <speech-conduct-externalization> <ngag-ru-shan-separation>
**Misreading:**
Speech conduct (*ngag ru shan 'byed pa*) interpreted as vocal techniques—specific ways of speaking, chanting, or silence as practice methods.

**Why it arises:**
"Speech" suggests vocalization. "Conduct" implies behavior. Mantra recitation is major practice. Sound has spiritual power.

**Primary consequence:**
Speech becomes technique. Practitioners try to "use" speech correctly. Natural expression is replaced by deliberate vocalization.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Vocal performance as practice
- Specific tone/pacing obsessions
- Missing that speech naturally liberates when recognized

**Cascade effects:**
<vocal-technique> → speaking correctly
<mantra-obsession> → sound power
<performance-anxiety> → saying it right
<recognition-prevention> → doing obscures being

---

[4235-4255] <mind-conduct-control> <sems-ru-shan-manipulation>
**Misreading:**
Mind conduct (*sems ru shan 'byed pa*) interpreted as thought-control techniques—managing, directing, or stopping thoughts as practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Mind" suggests thoughts. "Conduct" implies management. Meditation often involves thought-work. Control appeals to ego.

**Primary consequence:**
Mind becomes object to manage. Practitioners try to "do" mind correctly. Natural awareness is replaced by mental manipulation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Thought-control obsession
- "Am I thinking correctly?" anxiety
- Missing that mind liberates through recognition, not control

**Cascade effects:**
<thought-management> → controlling mind
<cognitive-obsession> → monitoring thinking
<control-paradox> → mind controlling mind
<recognition-prevention> → doing obscures seeing

---

[4256-4288] <samsara-escape-fantasy> <khor-ba-spong-pa-flight>
**Misreading:**
The three conducts (body, speech, mind) interpreted as methods to escape samsara—using practice to get out of cyclic existence.

**Why it arises:**
"Liberation" suggests exit. Suffering aversion. Escape fantasy. Hope for transcendence.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice becomes escape mechanism. "I must do these conducts to get free." The non-dual nature is replaced by dualistic flight.

**Secondary consequences:**
- World-rejection
- Practice as ransom payment
- Missing that samsara is nirvana when recognized

**Cascade effects:**
<escape-obsession> → fleeing samsara
<world-rejection> → life denial
<ransom-mentality> → practice to buy freedom
<recognition-prevention> → seeking obscures present completeness

---

[4289-4334] <nirvana-destination> <mya-ngan-las-das-pa-goal>
**Misreading:**
"Buddhahood in the future" (*ma 'ongs pa'i dus na de nyid du sangs rgyar 'gyur*) interpreted as literal future attainment—practice now pays off later.

**Why it arises:**
"Future" suggests goal. Deferred gratification. Hope for reward. Linear time thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Realization postponed to future. "I'll be Buddha later" excuses present inattention. The always-already nature is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Waiting for enlightenment
- Practice as investment for future payoff
- Missing that Buddha-nature is present now

**Cascade effects:**
<future-fixation> → waiting for realization
<investment-mentality> → practicing for reward
<present-neglect> → not now
<recognition-prevention> → later obscures now

---

[4335-4365] <conduct-accumulation> <spyod-pa-curriculum>
**Misreading:**
The three conducts interpreted as comprehensive curriculum—practitioner must master all three domains (body, speech, mind) as graduation requirements.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests completeness. Educational conditioning. Achievement culture. Wanting to "cover all bases."

**Primary consequence:**
Conduct becomes academic subject. "I must complete all three." The singular nature is fragmented into domains.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Checking off conduct-types
- Believing completion of all three is necessary
- Missing that the three describe one nature

**Cascade effects:**
<curriculum-approach> → studying conducts
<completion-quest> → mastering all three
<domain-separation> → body vs speech vs mind
<recognition-prevention> → accumulation obscures singularity

---

[4366-4392] <recognition-event> <ngo-shes-pa-breakthrough>
**Misreading:**
Recognition (*ngo shes pa*) interpreted as special event, insight, or breakthrough that happens in time—"Aha!" moment to wait for.

**Why it arises:**
"Recognition" suggests cognitive achievement. Breakthrough narratives are compelling. "Eureka" moments validate practice.

**Primary consequence:**
Waiting for recognition to "happen." Ordinary awareness is dismissed as "not it yet." The ever-present is obscured by seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Hasn't happened yet" discouragement
- Or: minor insights inflated into "the recognition"
- Missing that recognition is always already the case

**Cascade effects:**
<breakthrough-fetishism> → waiting for event
<experience-inflation> → minor as major
<ordinary-dismissal> → this isn't it
<recognition-prevention> → seeking obscures presence

---

[4393-4400] <disappointment-defense> <just-this-avoidance>
**Misreading:**
The simplicity of "just this" (*de nyid*) defended against as "too simple" or "can't be that easy"—rejecting recognition because it lacks drama.

**Why it arises:**
Simplicity seems inadequate. Wanting profound experience. Spiritual materialism values specialness. "Ordinary" feels insulting.

**Primary consequence:**
Rejecting recognition because it's not dramatic enough. Seeking more spectacular experiences. The obvious is overlooked.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "This can't be it" dismissal
- Endless seeking for something "more"
- Missing the profound in the simple

**Cascade effects:**
<simplicity-rejection> → too ordinary
<spectacle-seeking> → wanting drama
<dismissal-defense> → rejecting the obvious
<recognition-prevention> → complexity obscures simplicity
