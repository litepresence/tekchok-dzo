<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Transition to ground-path-fruition framework organizing remaining presentation. Ground as basis of purification, path as process of purification, fruition as result of purification. Structure applying to all vehicles but fully realized in Atiyoga. Instructional provisionality of threefold pedagogical framework.

[2544-2567]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Ground as primordial purity—basic space of phenomena, empty luminous nature of reality as source of all appearance yet unaffected. Not metaphysical substance or first cause. Primordial meaning never stained by delusion, never improved by practice, never altered by conditions. Declaration of ground's unchanging nature.

[2568-2591]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Ground as spontaneous presence—dynamic aspect of primordial purity. Unobstructed capacity to manifest naturally without effort or creation. All phenomena as self-display of rig pa, not arising from causes and conditions as inherently real. Fivefold manifestation as display of five wisdoms, elements, aggregates.

[2592-2615]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Ground as compassionate energy—unobstructed capacity of awareness to manifest for benefit of beings. Not emotional compassion but fundamental responsiveness. Capacity to appear as whatever needed: peaceful deities for pacification, wrathful for subjugation. Responsive capacity intrinsic to awareness.

[2616-2639]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Basis of purification concept reconciling primordial purity view with experience of delusion and need for practice. Provisionally speaking of delusion obscuring ground and practice purifying; definitively ground never obscured, no purification occurs. Instructional provisionality of purification framework.

[2640-2660]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Threefold nature of ground: essence as emptiness, nature as clarity, compassionate energy as responsiveness. These inseparable—empty essence naturally luminous, luminous nature spontaneously manifests, manifestations empty by nature. Risk of reifying three aspects as separate entities rather than unified recognition.

[2661-2680]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Ground's relationship to samsara and nirvana—both equally expressions of ground, neither staining nor improving it. Samsara as ground not recognized; nirvana as ground recognized. Ground itself unchanged throughout. Definitive declaration of non-dual ground.

[2681-2700]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>upaya-statement
<classification> Path as methods revealing ground's primordial purity. Ground-path-fruition ultimately inseparable yet conventionally distinguished for pedagogical accessibility. Path not leading to different fruition; fruition not other than ground. Upaya acknowledging necessity of method while pointing to non-separation.

[2701-2720]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Fruition as recognition of what was always present. Not achievement of something new but realization of primordial state. Dissolution of obscurations, manifestation of qualities, benefit for beings—all expressions of recognition rather than transformation. Definitive finality of fruition as recognition.

[2721-2740]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Ground-path-fruition applied across vehicles: Shravaka ground as no-self realization, path as four noble truths practice, fruition as arhat liberation; Mahayana ground as emptiness, path as bodhicitta and perfections, fruition as Buddhahood; Vajrayana ground as deity nature, path as generation and perfection stages, fruition as unity. Instructional provisionality of graduated framework.

[2741-2760]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Dzogchen's unique contribution—most direct recognition of ground-path-fruition inseparability. No basis to purify, no one to purify, no purification to perform. All three conceptual impositions on natural state. Definitive declaration transcending framework itself.

[2761-2780]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>negational-clearing
<classification> Clearing reification of ground-path-fruition structure. Not to be taken as metaphysical description but as pointer to natural state beyond frameworks. Structure dissolves in recognition of ground's spontaneous perfection. Negational clearing preventing attachment to conceptual model.

[2781-2800]
<view>dzogchen-rigpa
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Hermeneutical key for remaining presentation—nine vehicles understood through ground-path-fruition lens. Differences between vehicles lie in understanding and working with this structure. Instructional provisionality providing framework for comprehensive understanding.
