[16360-16363] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RESULT NON-RESULT]
<Lama early ones say: result not say, result three bodies attachment's extreme holding free make intended, or three circles sheath final that refute intended, contradiction removal done, meaning result place also, kadag's inner dharmadhatu's essence not intended transformation is, very mistaken not good. Here before accepted as path appearance also is, result also is not contradictory think, first path appearance is, spontaneous presence sheath kadag great that meaning result house like from, there enter and there from open ground kadag outer appearance dawns must. The apparent contradiction between result and non-result is resolved in non-dual view. Risk of contradiction: taking the negations literally rather than as pointing to primordial completion.>

[16378-16392] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – PATH AND FRUITION UNITY]
<Path appearance path fruition's manner path also is, that from open appearance wisdom path manner fruition also is. From Self-Arisen: "Dharmakaya within spontaneous presence's essence kadag that path manner fruition also is." Path three: essence path dharmakaya's manner is, nature path sambhogakaya's manner is, compassion path emanation's manner is. These three one nature's different aspects, dharmakaya spontaneous presence, sambhogakaya light rays appearance, emanation wisdom's compassion's compassion's manifestations three limitless. The unity of path and fruition transcends teleological development. Risk of teleological confusion: treating the path as leading to a future fruition rather than recognizing their non-dual nature.>
