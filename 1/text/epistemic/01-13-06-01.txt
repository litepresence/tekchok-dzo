<Technical analysis reveals sophisticated integration of BARDO NAVIGATION within the broader Dzogchen>

<Practical implications for bardo navigation emphasize the critical importance of recognition during>
<transitional states. The detailed presentation of dissolution stages ('char tshul) and death signs serves not>
<as morbid speculation but as preparation for the moment of opportunity. Practitioners train to recognize the>
<dharmata manifestation when consciousness withdraws, meeting the mother luminosity with the child luminosity>
<of practice. The bardo instructions encode the recognition that all experiences, including death and>
<intermediate states, are manifestations of rig pa's natural display.>
