[1463-1480] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<The three-thousand-world-system cosmology completion with twenty intermediate aeons (*bar bskal nyi shu*) for arising/abiding/destruction presents finalized Abhidharmic framework. The eight kalpa categories (arising, abiding, decline, increase, small kalpas) establish conventional temporal cycling.>

[1481-1500] <sems-side>
<The Dzogchen reframing of kalpa calculation (*bar bskal drug cu drug cu mnyam pa*) from *Thal 'gyur* citation introduces uncommon vehicle perspective. The 180 duration-kalpas (*yun gyi bskal pa*) framework operates at sems-side level, preparing for definitive recognition that all temporal cycling is spontaneous display without substantial existence.>

[1541-1570] <sems-side>
<The *Thal 'gyur* citation establishes Dzogchen's uncommon kalpa calculation (60×60=180 duration-kalpas per great kalpa), distinguishing from common vehicle (*thun mong ma yin pa'i theg pa*) temporal framework. This hermeneutical positioning asserts Dzogchen's definitive meaning (*nges don*) while remaining at sems-side instructional level.>

[1571-1580] <rigpa-side>
<The section conclusion "Container and Contained World Presentation, Second Story" (*snod bcud kyi 'jig rten bstan pa ste rim ghang gnyis pa*) marks transition from cosmology to phenomenology. The *Nyi zla kha sbyor* citation introduces fivefold analysis (realms, aggregates, sense-bases, faculties, object-subject) establishing definitive Dzogchen epistemology.>
