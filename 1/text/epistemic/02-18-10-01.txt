[5125-5125] <awareness-expanse>
<The awareness-in-expanse-between (*dbyings kyi ra bar rig pa bcug pa las*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that awareness in expanse's between, not waver, make (*mi 'gul bar byed de*)—this is the definitive instruction on how recognition rests. The "between" (*ra bar*) does not refer to spatial location but to the recognition that awareness is neither grasping at display nor separate from it. The instruction to "make not waver" (*mi 'gul bar byed*)—this is not effort to stabilize something unstable but recognition of what has never moved. Risk of spatialization: treating "in expanse's between" as literal location rather than recognition-description of non-duality.>

[5125-5130] <pleasure-deriving>
<The pleasure-deriving (*dga' bder shar*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. From practice (*bcos ma'i bsgoms pa las*), pleasure-arising (*dga' bde byung ba ni*)—this describes that pleasure arises from practice but is provisional. The worn-out analysis (*nyams 'gyur ba shas che la rags pa 'khrab pa'am glu gar byed 'dod pa 'byung bas chags zhen du song la*)—indicates that when pleasure is worn-out (*nyams 'gyur*), the pursuit of external things (*rags pa*, *glu gar*) is seen as meaningless. The statement this is pleasure-deriving (*'di ni dga' bder shar*)—also attaining self-power's pleasure (*rang dbang thob pa'i dga' bde*), without artificiality (*zhen med*), distinguishing by intellect after meditating (*bcos nas bsgoms pa dang* shes pa'i khyad yod pa ni*)—this is *upāya* for distinguishing recognition from artificial states. Risk of attainment-mentality: treating "pleasure" as achievement rather than recognition's natural display.>

[5125-5130] <thought-poison>
<The thought-poison (*tshod*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured practice. The instruction that this (*'di la*), poison, inserted (*tshod byed na*)—exhausted, settled (*tshod btsugs nas sbas skungs byed pa'i*), like (*'dra ste*)—this indicates that poison (*tshod*) refers to conceptual thought (*rtog pa*) that obscures recognition; the antidote is to exhaust and settle it. The statement that thought (*don rtog pa'i*) time, without, seeing (*dus med de mthong ba*), self-prime, not-placed (*rang thog tu mi phebs so*)—this establishes that recognition (*mthong ba*) sees thought as primordial (*rang thog*) and never established (*mi phebs so*). Risk of technicism: treating "poison-inserting" as formal technique rather than recognition's capacity to see through delusion.>

[5130-5145] <wind-experience>
<The wind-experience (*rlung nyams*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Self-nature, wind, entering (*rang bzhin gyis rlung du phebs pa'i bsam gtan gyi khyad du shes par bya'o*)—this establishes that recognition enters into wind through self-nature's samadhi (*bsam gtan*). The worn-out experience (*mthar 'gyur gyi nyams ni*) wind experience's appearance (*rlung nyams kyi snang cha ste*)—this indicates that recognition's experience through wind is described as seeing various displays like child (*rin bu me khyer lta bu dang*). Risk of physiological reduction: treating "wind-experience" as subtle-body technique rather than recognition's capacity to manifest through subtle energy.>

[5130-5144] <appearances-experience>
<The appearance's experience (*snang ba'i nyams*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that wisdom-lamp's five-color's display (*ye shes lnga'i kha dog gi snang ba*) seeing (*mthong bas*), samsara's actions all's extreme (*'khor ba'i las kyi mtha' phyed*)—establishes that recognition sees the display as wisdom's five colors without grasping at samsara's extremes. The analysis that expanse's display (*dbyings kyi snang ba*) seeing (*mthong bas*), that's (*de'i*) self-grasping's, object's, extreme (*steng du 'dzin pa rtog pa'i cha'i phyed med pa*), emptiness-exhausted, self-grasping, reversed (*stong chad du 'dzin pa log pas*)—this definitively establishes that recognition sees self-grasping as exhausted by emptiness. Risk of appearance-reification: treating "five-color's display" as visual phenomenon rather than recognition's luminous quality.>

[5144-5155] <samsaras-appearance>
<The samsara's appearance (*'khor ba'i cha*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured path. The analysis: samsara's appearances three, from (*'khor ba'i cha'i sum gnyis las 'das la*), imagination, ground, spontaneously-pure (*kun rtog gzhi gro rang sangs su dag pas*)—this indicates that imagination (*kun rtog*) recognizes ground (*gzhi*) as spontaneously pure (*rang sangs su dag*). The gnad: self-grasping's, object's, appearance (*'dzin cha'i phyed pa snang ba rang mtshan du 'dzin pa log pas*)—recognizing (*gzhi gro*) self-grasping's object as appearance, reversed (*log pas*)—this is the key: appearance appears as self-grasping (*rang mtshan*), but recognition reverses this (*log pas*). Risk of view collapse: mixing definitive "recognizing self-grasping's object" with provisional "imagination, ground, spontaneously-pure"—the former is recognition, latter is delusory view.>

[5145-5158] <child-like>
<The child-like (*lta bu*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for recognition description. The series of seeing child-like (*lta bu dang*) appearing as: fire-maker (*rin bu me khyer*), seeing (*sprin lta bu*), poison (*du ba*), peacock (*smug zil*), flowering (*zla ba shar ba*), star (*skar ma shar ba*), circling (*nam sros pa*), eye-born (*nyi ma shar ba*)—these are recognition-descriptions, not visual objects to create. The analysis: outer (*ltar phyi*), inner expanse (*nang zang thal bar snang ba lta bu dang brgyad de*), clouds arising (*'char nub dang gsal 'grib tu byung bas*), not stable (*mi brtan tshugs mi thub 'gyur 'gro bas mthar 'gyur gyi nyams zhes bya ste*)—this indicates that recognition sees outer and inner display simultaneously, with clouds (*'grib*) obscuring and clearing continuously. Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "child-like displays" as meditation objects rather than recognition's natural manifestation.>

[5147-5158] <five-families>
<The five-families (*rigs rnam pa*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The description: Ye She's (*ye shes mkhar thab kyi rnam pa 'dra ba dang*), Nyi Dzong's (*nyi zla zung sbrel gyi rnam pa 'dra ba dang*), Padma's precious (*pad+ma brtsegs pa'i rnam pa 'dra ba dang*), Offering-precious (*mchod rten brtsegs pa'i rnam pa 'dra ba dang*)—these are not literal deities but recognition-display modes (*rnam pa*) describing awareness's capacity to manifest as five wisdom-families (*ye shes lnga*). The gnad: Padma, emptiness-possessing (*pad+ma stong ldan gyi rnam pa*) seeing (*mthong bas*), arising's, bonds, liberated (*'byung ba lnga'i 'ching byed las 'das pa'o*)—this establishes that when recognition (*mthong ba*) sees emptiness (*stong ldan*), the five arisings naturally liberate without needing to cut bonds (*'ching*). These (*de dag kyang gcig skyes gcig 'gags pas nyams zhes bya'o*)—recognition sees the five families as one arsing (*gcig skyes*), not separate entities (*'gags*). Risk of deity-reification: treating "five families" as external deities rather than recognition-display modes.>

[5155-5158] <afflictions-liberation>
<The affliction's liberation teaching operates from *sems-side* provisional view. The statement that self-grasping, afflictions and (*'dzin gang zag dang*) dharmata, self-nature (*chos kyi bdag med rtog pa zhes bya'o*)—this indicates that self-grasping's afflictions are recognized as dharmata's self-nature (*bdag med*). This is *sems-side* analysis: through philosophical reasoning (*rtog pa*), one recognizes that afflictions lack self-nature. The gnad that not-existing, not-attaining (*ma gtogs pa med pas*)—this indicates that what was recognized as affliction never truly existed to attain. Risk of view collapse: mistaking *sems-side* philosophical recognition for definitive Dzogchen recognition—the former is provisional understanding through reasoning, latter is direct recognition.>
