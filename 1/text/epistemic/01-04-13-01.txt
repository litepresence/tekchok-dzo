[3313-3335] <inexpressibility>
This section presents the inexpressibility (brjod du med pa) of the natural state as a fundamental feature of Dzogchen. From the Dzogchen perspective, the nature of mind cannot be captured in words, concepts, or descriptions—it must be recognized directly.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding inexpressibility. Unlike teachings that can be fully articulated in language, Dzogchen points to what transcends language. Words can point to the natural state but cannot contain it.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that language operates by distinction—this versus that, existence versus non-existence, subject versus object. The natural state transcends all distinctions; therefore, it cannot be expressed in language. It can only be recognized directly.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in inexpressibility is the recognition that while conventionally we use words to teach and communicate, ultimately the truth is beyond words. All teachings are provisional pointers to what cannot be taught.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the natural state is beyond all expression (brjod du med), beyond all thought (bsam du med), and beyond all description (bshad du med). These three inexpressibilities point to the same reality.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to approach the inexpressible. Do not try to understand the natural state conceptually; simply rest in direct recognition. The inexpressible is not a puzzle to be solved but a reality to be experienced.

The section discusses the relationship between inexpressibility and teaching. If the truth is inexpressible, why teach? The teachings are fingers pointing at the moon, not the moon itself. They create conditions for recognition but are not the recognition.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for inexpressibility, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional teachings can be expressed, the ultimate truth transcends expression.

The section thus establishes the inexpressibility of the natural state—the recognition that the truth of Dzogchen cannot be captured in words but must be recognized directly through direct introduction.

[3336-3340] <beyond-mind>
This section presents the Dzogchen view that the natural state is beyond mind (blo 'das)—transcending not only ordinary conceptual mind but even the most refined meditative states. From the Dzogchen perspective, rig pa is not a state of mind but the nature beyond all minds.

The epistemic framework here employs [DEFINITIVE MEANING] in understanding transcendence of mind. Unlike teachings that aim at refined mental states—calm abiding, deep concentration, or even non-conceptual meditation—Dzogchen points to what transcends mind entirely.

The [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that mind (sems) includes all conceptual and even non-conceptual mental activity. Rig pa is not a modification of mind but the awareness within which mind arises and dissolves. It is not a better mind but the nature beyond mind.

The distinction between [ULTIMATE TRUTH] and [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in transcendence of mind is the recognition that while conventionally we work with mind—calming it, refining it, transcending its gross aspects—ultimately we must go beyond mind itself to the awareness that is its nature.

The viewpoint tag [VIEW ASSERTION] establishes the principle: the natural state is beyond mind (blo 'das), beyond intellect (blo), and beyond thought (rtog pa). These three transcendences point to rig pa as distinct from all mental activity.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to go beyond mind. Do not try to achieve special mental states; simply recognize the awareness within which all states arise. This recognition is beyond mind.

The section discusses the relationship between meditation and non-meditation. Meditation uses mind; Dzogchen transcends it. The highest meditation is non-meditation—resting in awareness beyond all mental activity.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for transcendence of mind, recognizing it as the definitive truth. While provisional teachings work with mind, the ultimate reality is beyond it.

The section thus establishes the Dzogchen view of the natural state as beyond mind—not a state to be achieved but the awareness within which all states arise and dissolve.
