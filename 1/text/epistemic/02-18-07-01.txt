[4747-4748] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The definitive clarification of outer and inner objects operates from *rigpa-side* pointing to recognition's non-duality. The explanation: outer is the object where rigpa dawns (*phyi rig pa 'char ba'i yul yin la*), inner is the object where experience increases (*nang nyams 'phel ba'i yul te*); because rigpa and experience are non-dual (*rig pa dang nyams gnyis su med pa las*), it is called "saṃsāra-nirvāṇa mixed" (*'khor 'das 'dres pa zhes bya'o*). This establishes that outer and inner are not separate: the object of recognition (*yul*) is not something other than recognition (*rig pa*) and experience (*nyams*). The warning: placing object on coarse earth-water-fire--air objects (*sa chu me rlung gi dngos po rags pa la yul du gtad pas*) will not liberate (*mi grol te*)—first, appearance does not want to dawn (*dang po snang ba 'char du mi 'dod*); later, when dawning, even knowing as coarse objects (*phyis shar dus gtan kyang dngos po rags pa ltar shes pa*), produces agreement with that (*de dang mthun pa skye bas*), so emptiness-unthinkable experience does not dawn from within (*stong nyid bsam du med pa'i nyams nang nas mi 'char la*). This is crucial: if one grasps at coarse physical objects as the object of gnad, recognition cannot occur because coarse objects are already solidified by dualistic perception. The phrase "emptiness-unthinkable experience" (*stong nyid bsam du med pa'i nyams*) refers to the direct recognition beyond concept (*rtog pa*) of emptiness (*stong nyid*). Risk of object-gnad dualism: treating "object" (*yul*) as something external to recognize rather than awareness's own display. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "outer" and "inner" are pedagogical designations pointing to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated. The "mixing" of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa (*'khor 'das 'dres pa*) is not a mixing of two separate things but the recognition that they were never truly separate.>

[4749-4761] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The definitive teaching on awareness (*rig pa*) and emptiness (*stong pa*) operates from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The opening statement—nam mkha' stong pa la rig pa stong pa gtad pas ("having placed awareness-as-emptiness upon space-as-emptiness")—establishes the non-dual basis where space, emptiness, and awareness are not separate entities. The subsequent analysis of experience-emptiness equal to space (*nyams stong gsal 'phro 'du dang bral ba*) appearing as spontaneous-uncorrected display (*phyal yas pa cig 'char*) marks the definitive mode: awareness never departs from its own self-display. The statement of purpose—dngos po mtshan dang bral ba'i dgos pa yod de ("there exists a purpose of phenomena free from characteristics")—refers to recognition-function, not ontological status. The citation from sems sde (mind class) on yoga's abiding in space indicates that even provisional teachings point toward definitive ground. The *yul nam mkha' dang mthun pa'i nyams stong* ("experience-emptiness consistent with space") phrase establishes that valid experience is inseparable from the empty nature of appearance. Risk of nihilism: interpreting "emptiness" as mere absence rather than the self-luminous expanse of awareness.>

[4762-4764] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-DUAL DISPLAY]
<The threefold unity—appearance-emptiness non-dual view (*dbyings rig gnyis med kyi lta ba*), appearance-awareness undifferentiated view (*dbyings rig 'dres pa'i lta ba*), and appearance-awareness dissolved-into sameness taste view (*dbyings rig 'dres pas 'khor 'das ro mnyam kyi lta ba*)—operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. These are not three stages or optional perspectives but a single recognition described from different angles: (1) the nature of awareness is the display (*dbyings*), not a separate object; (2) awareness never becomes separate from its own display; (3) in that non-separation, samsara and nirvana are already the same taste. The phrase *dbyings* (expanse) refers to awareness's own capacity to display; *rig pa* refers to the knowing quality; they are one nature (*ngo bo gcig*), two aspects (*rnam pa gnyis*). The citation from bstan bu continues this analysis. Risk of dualism: treating "expanse" as empty container and "awareness" as filler, rather than recognizing their inseparability as primordial state.>

[4765-4775] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
<The wind-rig gnad (*rlung rig gi gnad*) presentation operates from *sems*-side pedagogy for practitioners who benefit from structured path. The instruction: relying on object (*yul*) and door (*sgo*) together, when wind is calmed (*rlung dal ba*) then hold awareness in concentration (*rig pa btson du gzung ba*)—this is *upāya* (skillful means), not definitive truth. The explanation that wind becomes calm causes expansion outward and holding inward is a provisional causal description for recognition preparation, not actual causation. The internal movement of concepts ceasing (*nang du rnam par rtog pa nub pa*) when wind is calmed creates conditions for recognition. The secret practice of awareness directly seeing (*gsang bar rig pa mngon sum du mthong ba*) and working in that manner accomplishes that even afflictions do not appear in that nature—all this describes the experiential process, not ontological transformation. The goal—sangs rgya bar byed pa ("to fully awaken")—refers to recognition of what was never obscured, not attainment of new state. Risk of technicism: treating "wind calming" and "holding awareness" as mechanical techniques rather than recognition-facilitating conditions.>

[4776-4789] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The citation from *Thal 'Gyur* and subsequent analysis operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The repeated statement—rlung rig dal bas ye shes 'grub ("by wind-awareness calming, wisdom is accomplished")—appears three times with slight variations in the Tibetan (rab tu 'phang ba las byung bas / ces pa dang*). The crucial analysis: from fully releasing, body and mind connection dissolved, therefore even not reversed in three realms (*khams gsum du yang zlog pa min*). This establishes definitive recognition: when awareness recognizes itself, body-mind duality never existed, so "reversing" it is meaningless. The three realms do not dissolve because they never truly existed as separate from awareness. The final statement—rig pa'i gnad lu gu rgyud dbyings kyi ra bar bzhag nas mi 'gul bar byed pa ste ("having placed the awareness-gnad in the middle of the continuum between vessel-hook-continuum and expanse, make it not waver")—points to direct introduction. The "middle between" (*ra bar*) does not refer to spatial location but to the recognition that awareness is neither grasping at form (*lu*—vessel) nor clinging to continuum (*nu*—thread) but resting as expanse (*dbyings*). Risk of reification: treating "wessel-hook-continuum" as entities rather than metaphoric descriptions of recognition's relationship to appearance.>

[4790-4796] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE EYES]
<The three eyes (*spyan gsum*) description operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structural recognition coordinates. The analysis continues from previous gnad: the wind-rig method enables recognition of three-eyed viewing. These are not literal eyes to visualize but recognition's three modes of seeing: (1) seeing through the dharmata-eye clearing latencies downward; (2) seeing through wisdom-eye looking evenly as same-taste of samsara-nirvana; (3) seeing through prajña-eye looking downward which settles wisdom-appearance. The "looking" directions (upward, even, downward) refer to recognition's orientation toward aspects of itself, not spatial directions. The instruction that "lazy ones need Sambhogakaya posture, diligent ones Nirmanakaya, equanimous ones Dharmakaya posture" (*g.yo ba ni longs sku, brtson 'byor ni sprul sku, btang snyoms ni chos sku'i bzhugs stangs la bzhag*) indicates that different practitioners require different entry-points based on their predominant capacity (*dbang po*). This is not hierarchical division but recognition-variety. Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "three eyes" and "postures" as visual techniques rather than recognition-coordinate descriptions.>

[4790-4801] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The citations establishing awareness as self-knotted (*lu gu rgyud*) operate within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The *Rang ngo rig pa* (Self-Face Awareness) citation—"Self-face awareness like a snake-knot (*rang ngo rig pa lu gu rgyud*), held in sky through free from going-coming (*'gro 'ong bral bas mkha' la bzung*)"—and *Bstan bu* (Display) citation—"Within expanse (*dbyings kyi nang du*), snake-knot (*lu gu rgyud*), arranged (*rnam par gzhag cing*) but not separated (*'bral mi bya*)"—establish the definitive Dzogchen view of awareness as self-arisen and self-coiled, not externally constructed. The commentary elaborates: through slow-wind reliance (*rlung dal ba bsten pas*), the meaning of separation from activity arises in continuum (*bya ba dang bral ba'i don rgyud la skye*); awareness-knot placed in "A" syllable (*rig pa lu gu rgyud ar la gtad pas*) causes conceptual sources to exhaust (*rnam par rtog pa'i khungs zad nas*), delusion returns to ground (*'khrul pa gzhi la log ste*), and mother-child wisdoms meet (*ye shes ma bu phrad pa'o*). The phrase "mother-child wisdoms meeting" (*ye shes ma bu phrad*) refers to the meeting of primordial wisdom (mother) and recognition wisdom (child)—not two things meeting but recognition of their inseparability. The crucial statement: "Awareness separated from wind, without going-coming (*rig pa rlung dang bral nas 'gro 'ong du med pa*), is awareness entering itself (*rig pa la rang byan tshud pa*)." This establishes that recognition is not produced but discovered: awareness has never truly been separate from itself; the apparent separation is wind-agitation (*rlung*), and when wind settles, awareness naturally enters itself. Risk of snake-knot metaphor literalism: treating "snake-knot" as actual entity to unknot rather than metaphorical description of awareness's self-coiled nature.>

[4802-4811] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The detailed instruction for preparation (*khrid*) operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The graduated practice description: (1) If guiding (*khrid du byed na*), rely on body-gnad (*lus kyi gnad bstun pa*) for five-six days (*nyi ma lnga drug tu bya'o*); (2) Then apply gate (*de nas sgo spyad pa la*) for just that amount (*de tsam cig tu bya'o*); (3) Then search field (*de nas yul btsal ba la*) from six to seven days (*nyi ma drug nas bdun byas la*); (4) Then place direct actual on threshold (*de nas mngon sum rang thog tu phab nas*) and take as experience (*nyams su len pa'o*). This produces extreme training (*shin tu 'byongs*) and meditative knowing (*sgom shes pa*). The warning: if by mixing and turning (*gzhan du 'al ma 'ol byas pas*) one sees appearance singularly (*snang ba ra ri cig mthong nas*), and when emerging from guidance without conviction (*yid ches med par khrid thon dus*), doubt arises without any speaking (*ci la zer cha med par pra yas pa dag 'byung nye*), therefore do not go that way (*de lta ma song ba dag tu bya'o*). This indicates that mixing practices without proper foundation leads to unstable experiences. The guidance-instructions: when placing this great guidance (*khrid mo che 'di 'debs dus*), go forth with effort to all predecessors (*sngon 'gro tshad la phebs pa brtson 'grus dang bcas pas*), having purified (*sbyangs pas*), conviction arises in actual basis (*dngos gzhi la yid ches thun mong ma yin pa skye'o*)—not ordinary conviction but extraordinary certainty in recognition itself. When placing actual basis (*dngos gzhibs par btab pas*), special joy arises in direct perception (*mngon sum la spro dga' khyad par can 'byung ngo*). The post-guidance instruction: explaining that cutting off dharma extremes (*rjes rgyab chos mtha' chod par bshad pas*), knowing that one can protect experience-taking (*nyams len bskyang thub pa shes nas*), cutting off all doubts (*tshom dang rtog mtha' chod de*), one should not place mind in other dharmas (*chos gzhan la yid mi smon pa'i dgos pa yod do*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of gradual path essentializing: treating the time-durations (five-six days, six-seven days) as fixed requirements rather than flexible guidelines. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these "phases" are pedagogical scaffolding for those who benefit from structure, but the recognition itself is immediate and beyond gradual progression.>

[4812-4815] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The direct pointing of awareness's self-face (*mngon sum rig pa'i rang ngo sprad pa*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The description: awareness as vajra-snake-knot (*rig pa rdo rje'i lu gu rgyud*), like golden thread hovering in sky (*gser gyi skud pa nam mkha' la lding ba lta bu*), expanse-clear-light-appearance together (*dbyings 'od gsal gyi snang ba dang bcas pa*)—this unconfused buddha (*ma 'khrul pa'i sangs rgyas*), primordial purity spontaneous presence self-radiance (*ka dag lhun grub kyi rang gdangs*). Looking into state (*ngang la bltas pas*), all concept-creators pure (*rtog byed thams cad dag nas*), beyond elaboration like sky (*spros bral nam mkha' 'dra ba'i gdangs*), radiance dawns within (*nang du shar bas*), knowing the meaning of non-dual expanse-rigpa (*dbyings rig gnyis su med pa'i dgongs pa shes rab*), prajna-born wisdom meets face-to-face (*byung gi ye shes dang zhal mjal*). This is not description of attainment but recognition-instruction: the "snake-knot" is awareness's self-coiled nature, never requiring unknotting; the "golden thread in sky" (*gser gyi skud pa nam mkha' la lding ba*) is the subtle self-radiance always present, not something to create; the "meeting face-to-face" (*zhal mjal*) is the collapse of recognizer-recognized separation, not an event of meeting two entities. The phrase "unconfused buddha" (*ma 'khrul pa'i sangs rgyas*) refers to awareness itself, which has never been confused—only apparently so through dualistic perception. The phrase "primordial purity spontaneous presence self-radiance" (*ka dag lhun grub kyi rang gdangs*) indicates the three aspects: (1) primordial purity (*ka dag*)—never corrupted by defilements; (2) spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*)—not created by causes; (3) self-radiance (*rang gdangs*)—self-displaying without external agent. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of visualization misunderstanding: treating "golden thread hovering in sky" as visualization to create rather than metaphorical description of awareness's subtle self-radiance. The Dzogchen view recognizes that this "introduction" (*ngo sprod*) is not information transfer but the pointing that reveals awareness has never been other than what is pointed to. The phrase "knowing the meaning" (*dgongs pa shes rab*) does not mean intellectual understanding but direct recognition (*ngo sprod*).>

[4816-4820] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The opening statement on Samantabhadra and capacity equality (*thog ma'i kun tu bzang po dang skal ba mnyam*) establishes definitive Dzogchen ground: the primordial state (*thog ma*) and individual capacity (*skal ba*) are already equal, not gradually achieved. The instruction that training to capacity (*goms pa tshad du phyin*) causes liberation in light (*rdos bcas 'od du 'grol ba*) operates as *upāya* for practitioners who benefit from path-structure, but the definitive view recognizes that liberation is the recognition of what was never bound. The threefold description—wandering through self-arising fields (*rang bzhin sprul pa'i zhing bgrod*), the six wanderings (*'gro drug*) with confusion (*'khrul pa*) cutting the basis—these are pedagogical descriptions of how samsara manifests from recognition-failure, not ontological states. Risk of determinism: interpreting "capacity equality" as all beings having equal path-progress rather than recognition-availability.>

[4821-4829] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – NON-DUAL GROUND]
<The citation from *rang byung bstan pa* and subsequent analysis operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The rhetorical question—who sees (*su yis mthong ba'i mi*) in this manner—and the statement that Samantabhadra and capacity are equal (*thog ma'i kun tu bzang po dang skal ba nyid ni mnyam pa'o*)—establish that recognition is available to all regardless of apparent difference. The *Thal 'Gyur* citation on vessel-hook-continuum's self-arising (*lu gu rgyud kyi rang bzhin ni*) and concepts all purified (*rnam par rtog pa kun dag pas*) non-delusion basis (*ma 'khrul gzhi*) spontaneously expanding (*yi sangs rgyas*)—this describes the nature of ground: appearance arises from itself, concepts are already pure, and the basis of non-delusion spontaneously expands. The "basis" (*gzhi*) here is not a substrate but recognition's own nature. Risk of temporality: interpreting "spontaneously expanding" as gradual process rather than timeless quality of ground.>

[4831-4840] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE-LIGHT DISPLAY]
<The five-light appearance mode teaching (*'od lnga'i rang gdangs lang ling du snang ba*) operates from definitive *rigpa-side* with *instructional provisionality* for recognition preparation. The description: outer five lights' self-resonance appearing in space, thigle and particles (*thig le phra mo*) connecting to vessel-hook-continuum, the analogy of stars not wandering outward (*thog mar dkar zing skar ma 'phro ba lta bu*), thigle containing five colors (*thig le kha dog lnga ldan*)—these are recognition-descriptions, not visual objects to create. The statement "therefore one sees thigle" (*de nas thig le mthong ba yin no*) indicates that when recognition recognizes itself, the subtle display naturally becomes apparent, not through cultivation. Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "five lights" and "thigle" as visual phenomena to search for rather than self-manifesting qualities of awareness.>

[4841-4844] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – LIGHT-ESSENCE NON-DUALITY]
<The definitive analysis on looking at outer clear light (*phyi'i 'od gsal la bltas pas*) operates from *rigpa-side*. When one looks at outer clear light, inner concepts cease (*nang rnam rtog bral te*), difference-free equal liberation (*ris med mnyam par grol ba*)—this establishes that recognition of one aspect (outer light) reveals the whole nature (inner concepts ceased). The citation from *rang byung*: essence's self-resonance (*ka dag gi rig gdangs*) and spontaneous presence's light-resonance (*lhun grub kyi 'od gdangs gnyis*), outer and inner (*phyi nang*) joined (*zung du 'brel bas*), appearance-emptiness non-separated (*dbyings rig 'du 'bral med pa*), the intention (*dgongs pa*)—this is the definitive view: the two resonances (essence and spontaneous presence) are not separate; outer and inner are joined; appearance and emptiness are non-separated. Risk of substantialism: treating "light-resonance" as some subtle substance rather than descriptive metaphor for awareness's luminous quality.>

[4845-4853] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR APPEARANCES]
<The four-appearance mode teaching (*snang ba bzhi 'char ba'i rim pa la gnyis te*) operates as *instructional provisionality* providing structural recognition framework. The two-part division: (1) meaning condensed (*ngo bo mdor bstan pa*) and (2) spontaneously expanded (*rang bzhin rgyas par bshad pa*). First part: in the four appearances' time (*snang ba bzhi ka'i dus su*), body abides in posture (*lus bzhugs stangs la gnas pa*), eyes gaze in style (*mig gzigs stangs la lta ba*), wind-awareness self-resting equal three points (*rlung rig ngang gis dal ba gsum gnad mthun la*)—this describes the mode of recognition, not a technique. The key point: especially (*khyad par*) appearance and po (*snang ba dang po gnyis su sbyangs pas*), through that (*de'i nas*), not relying on outer effort (*phyi ma gnyis su rtsol ba la ma ltos par*) self-resting causes liberation (*ngang gis 'byongs nas*), therefore it is liberation in clear light (*'od gsal du grol ba yin pas*), so appearance-awareness non-dual (*dbyings rig gnyis su med pa*). Risk of sequentialism: treating "four appearances" as chronological stages rather than simultaneous recognition-descriptions.>

[4854-4857] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – AWARENESS-GNAD]
<The awareness-gnad (*rig pa'i gnad*) instruction operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The point (*gnad*) that awareness should not separate from vajra and vessel-hook-continuum (*rig pa rdo rje lu gu rgyud dang mi 'bral bar bya ba*)—this is the definitive instruction on non-separation: awareness is the nature (*rdo rje* is descriptive metaphor) and vessel-hook-continuum is the display; they are not two. The explanation: awareness (*rig pa*) is essence-nature itself (*ngo bo rang bzhin*), compassion-Three (*thugs rje gsum*) undivided (*dbyer mi phyed pa*), abiding in basis (*gzhi gnas*), and its light-resonance appearance (*de'i gdangs 'od*)—from root and branch (*rtsa dngas pa'i snang ba*) like golden thread connecting to golden knot (*gser gyi skud pa lta bu breng chags la 'khyog mtshams*), connect with thigle (*thig les sbrel ba*). The final statement: Vajra (*rdo rje*) from the side of immovable abiding, all sentient beings (*sangs rgyas sems can kun la*) equal good and bad nature (*ngo bo bzang ngan med par mnyam*) and unchanging (*mi 'gyur ba*)—establishes that the ground is impartial recognition, not a state achieved. Risk of essentialism: treating "vajra" as some essential substance rather than awareness's indestructible quality.>

[4858-4865] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The three similes establishing Dzogchen view operate within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The vessel simile (*lu ni dper na*): like a good water vessel (*chu'i lu ma bzang po*), water increases and decreases without arising (*chu 'phel 'grib med par 'byung ba*), spontaneous presence without effort (*dang 'dra bar*), body and wisdom increase (*sku dang ye shes kyi 'phel*), various path appearances (*sgo sna tshogs su lam snang*) appear without completion (*ma rdzogs kyi bar la*), arising from that (*de las 'char bar byed pa'o*). The hook simile (*gu ni*): within that very one (*de nyid kyi nang du*), dharmata's non-mistaken view and meditation (*chos nyid phyin ci ma log pa'i lta ba dang sgom pa*) are drawn (*'gugs par byed la*). The continuum simile (*rgyud ni*): pervading samsara-nirvana (*'khor 'das la khyab cing*), from those gathered appearances (*snang ba de'i tshogs rnams las*), clarifying (*gsal bar byed pa'o*) bodies (*sku*), thigle dispersion (*thig le 'phro ba*), increase (*mched pa*), gathering (*'du ba*) and so forth. These similes operate as *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) to point toward recognition. Risk of simile reification: treating "vessel," "hook," and "continuum" as actual entities rather than metaphorical descriptions of awareness's nature. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "water increases and decreases without arising" points to awareness's self-display not being truly caused; "non-mistaken view and meditation drawn" points to recognition being drawn into dharmata; "pervading samsara-nirvana" points to awareness's non-dual nature never truly separate from appearances.>

[4866-4877] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The *Thal 'Gyur* citation on fourfold appearance operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The citation: "Slow wind-rigpa accomplishes wisdom (*rlung rig dal bas ye shes 'grub*); from that (*de las*) appearance becomes four (*snang ba bzhir 'gyur te*)—(1) dharmata actual appearance (*chos nyid mngon sum snang ba yis*) destroys intellectual grasping-view (*yid dpyod 'dzin pa'i lta ba bsnubs*); (2) experience-appearance increase upward (*nyams snang gong du 'phel ba yis*) causes delusion-appearance to disappear (*'khrul pa'i snang ba nub par byed*); (3) rigpa measure-reached appearance (*rig pa tshad phebs snang ba yis*) transcends three-kaya realization-path-appearance (*sku gsum rtogs pa'i lam snang 'das*); (4) dharmata exhaustion-appearance (*chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba yis*) cuts three-realm samsara continuum (*khams gsum 'khor ba'i rgyun thag bcad*)." These four appearances are not sequential stages but simultaneous modalities of recognition-deepening: (1) direct appearance (*mngon sum*)—recognition itself; (2) experiential increase (*nyams 'phel*)—recognition's deepening; (3) measure-completion (*tshad phebs*)—recognition's fullness; (4) exhaustion (*zad pa*)—recognition's consummation. The phrase "measure-reached" (*tshad phebs*) indicates that recognition reaches its natural measure without exceeding or falling short. The phrase "exhaustion" (*zad pa*) refers to exhaustion of dualistic perception, not exhaustion of awareness itself. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of fourfold appearance essentializing: treating these "four" as mandatory sequential progression rather than recognition-descriptions. The Dzogchen view recognizes these as awareness's own display (*rang snang*), never departing from primordial purity (*ka dag*), spontaneously self-liberating (*rang grol) without effort (*lhun grub*).>

[4878-4881] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The detailed enumeration of fourfold appearance divisions operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The statement: "The four appearances are definitely (*snang ba bzhir grangs nges pa ni*)" then lists: (1) external (*phyir*) sun-moon four-times increase-decrease (*nam zla dus bzhi'i 'phel zad pa*); (2) internal (*nang du*) body-speech-mind-consciousness four bindings liberation (*lus ngag yid sems bzhi'i bcings pa las dgrol ba*); (3) secret (*gsang bar*) four-empowerments definitive showing (*dbang bzhi'i nges pa ston pa*); (4) suchness (*de kho na nyid du*) four-lamp appearances definitive (*sgron ma bzhi'i snang ba nges pa*), therefore looking at that (*la ltos nas*) four are definite (*bzhir nges so*). This establishes that the "four appearances" manifest on multiple levels: external (cosmic cycles), internal (subtle body), secret (empowerment), and suchness (ultimate). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners who benefit from structural mapping. Risk of fourfold division reification: treating these "four" as rigid categories rather than pedagogical presentation of the same recognition from different angles. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "external sun-moon," "internal four bindings," "secret four empowerments," and "suchness four lamps" all refer to the same recognition displayed through different modes: the cosmic, the energetic, the empowering, and the ultimate. All four point to awareness's self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated nature.>

[4882-4890] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
<The explanation of definite sequence (*go rims nges pa*) operates from *sems*-side pedagogy. The explanation: without seeing first ground dharmata-directly (*dang po'i gzhi chos nyid mngon sum ma mthong na*), the remaining three have no arising-basis (*lhag ma gsum gyi 'char gzhi med pas*), therefore first dharmata-direct-appearance arises as support-base (*rten dang brten pa'i gzhir dang po chos nyid mngon sum gyi snang ba 'char ba'o*). When that itself (*de nyid shar bas*) dawns, seeing all dharmas' meaning (*chos thams cad kyi don mthong bas*), obtaining self-arisen wisdom from self (*rang byung gi ye shes rang las rnyed pa zhes bya'o*)—this indicates that recognition is not attainment of new wisdom but recognition of what has always been self-arisen (*rang byung*). The crucial instruction: that appearance (*de nas mngon pa de*) if not taken as experience (*nyams su ma myong na*), no fruit arises from mere words (*tshig tsam la 'bras bu mi 'byung ba las*), but experiencing the meaning (*don nyams su myong bas*) causes that experience to increase upward (*de'i nyams gong 'phel du byung ba'o*). Therefore, the measure of experience-arisen (*de ltar nyams skyes pa'i tshad*) must be stabilized (*brtan par byed dgos te*): without stabilizing (*ma brtan na*) no confidence enters experience (*nyams la thug pa med pas*), not holding dharma (*chos la zin pa med*), and no warmth arises (*sangs la rgya rgyu mi 'byung ba las*)—when reaching the measure of experience-stabilization (*nyams brtan pa'i tshad la phebs pas*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of sequential stage fetishism: taking the "first...then..." structure as mandatory temporal progression rather than pedagogical presentation of logical dependence. The Dzogchen view recognizes that the "sequence" describes recognition's logical structure, not its temporal unfolding: recognition must first recognize its own nature before "deepening" can occur, but in actual recognition, all four aspects are simultaneously present.>

[4891-4905] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The arising of awareness-measure-reached appearance (*rig pa tshad phebs kyi snang ba byung ba*) marks definitive Dzogchen view. The crucial distinction: even when rigpa-appearance reaches measure (*rig pa'i snang ba tshad la phebs*), if it does not change into something other than that (*kyang de las gzhan du mi 'gyur na*), it is not different from considering three kayas as fruition (*sku gsum 'bras bur 'dod pa dang khyad med la*), and from apparent marks/signs (*dngos snang mtshan ma*) one does not hope for meaning's fruition (*chos la don gyi 'bras bu re ba thun mong ba rnams dang khyad med pa las*)—this indicates that Dzogchen view does not treat three kayas as goals to attain in future but as recognition of what is present. The explanation: appearance-experience (*snang nyams*) dissolves into ground (*gzhi la thim ste*), subtle-coarse appearance-grasping ceases (*phra rags kyi snang 'dzin nub nas*), and through engaging in primordial purity dharma-exhaustion (*ka dag chos zad la spyod pas*), dharmata-exhaustion-appearance arises (*chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba byung ba'o*). This establishes that recognition is not progressive but revelatory: when experience dissolves into its ground, grasping ceases, and one abides in primordial purity (*ka dag*), what arises is dharmata-exhaustion—not dharmata destroyed but recognition that dharmata has never been obscured (*zad pa*). The detailed structure: first two (*de dag kyang dang po gnyis*) are Nirmanakaya (*sprul sku*), measure-reached (*tshad phebs*) is Sambhogakaya (*longs sku*), exhaustion (*zad pa*) is Dharmakaya (*chos sku*). Through making them path-appearance (*chos sku'i snang ba lam du byas pas*), three kayas appear as path-appearance (*sku gsum lam snang du shar bas*), and fruition dharma-exhaustion primordial purity reaches expanse (*'bras bu chos zad ka dag gi dbyings la thug pa'i phyir*). The conclusion: self-appearance's potency-three kayas (*rang snang gi rtsal sku gsum*) dissolve into rigpa's state (*rig pa'i ngang du thim pas*)—this is rigpa-primordial-purity's fruition (*rig pa ka dag gi 'bras bu*). From rigpa's expanse (*rig pa'i dbyings nas*), primordially self-potency-three kayas arise (*gdod kyis rang rtsal sku gsum shar bas*) and perform benefit (*don byed pa*), which is called (*zhes bya ste*) "essence not even heard by name from other vehicles" (*g pa gzhan nas ming yang mi grag pa'i snying po*) and "King of Vehicles' intention" (*g pa rgyal po'i dgongs pa*). This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of fruition deferral: interpreting "measure-reached" (*tshad phebs*) as a goal to achieve rather than recognition's own self-display. The Dzogchen view recognizes that fruition was never separate from ground of recognition: three kayas are not attained but recognized as self-display (*rang snang*).>

<The fourfold extensive explanation (*gnyis pa so so'i rang bzhin rgyas par bshad pa*) of individual natures operates within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The fourfold structure: (1) direct appearance (*chos nyid mngon sum*); (2) experience-increase (*nyams gong 'phel*); (3) rigpa-measure-reached (*rig pa tshad phebs*); (4) dharmata-exhaustion-appearance (*chos nyid zad pa'i snang ba rgyas par bshad pa'o*). The detailed analysis of direct appearance (*dang po la gnyis te*) includes two aspects: (1) general connection-establishment (*mngon sum spyi'i 'brel dgod pa dang*)—recognizing the fundamental connection between appearance and awareness; (2) individual characteristic ascertainment (*rang gi mtshan nyid dngos gzung ba'o*)—recognizing the unique characteristics of each appearance. The four types of direct appearance: (1) *dang po ni spyir mngon sum*—conventional direct appearance (*kun rdzob tha snyad la grags pa'i mngon sum*), which appears as five sense-objects (*dbang po'i mngon sum gzugs sogs yul lnga snang ba'i rang bzhin*); (2) *yid kyi mngon sum*—mental direct appearance (*nyid kyi mngon sum*), which appears as conceptual certainty in conceptual object (*yid kyi mngon sum yul nye bar spyod pa rgyu mtshan nges pa'i rtog yul na snang ba*); (3) *rang rig pa'i mngon sum*—self-awareness direct appearance (*rang rig pa'i mngon sum*), which experiences internal bliss/suffering (*nang du bde sdug la sogs myong ba ces pa'i snang ba*); (4) *rnal 'byor gyi mngon sum*—yogic direct appearance, which directly encounters suchness (*nyid kyi don nye bar mjal ba de kho na nyid*), entering suchness, individual correct rigpa and its appearance-object non-dual (*so so yang dag pa'i rig pa dang de'i snang yul gnyis su med pa*), free from grasping-grasped experience certainty (*'dzin dang bral bar myong ba'i nges pa ste*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of direct appearance classification: treating these "four types" as rigid categories rather than pedagogical presentation. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all four "direct appearances" are conventional designations (*tha snyad*) for what is ultimately single awareness-display (*rang snang*). The phrase "conventional direct appearance" (*kun rdzob tha snyad la grags pa'i mngon sum*) indicates that even "direct appearance" is ultimately conventional when spoken of as "type"—actual recognition transcends all classification. The phrase "self-awareness direct appearance" refers to awareness's self-knowledge (*rang rig*)—not separate knower and known. The phrase "yogic direct appearance" refers to recognition through yoga (union) of samsara-nirvana (*'khor 'das*), not a special achievement beyond ordinary experience. The definitive view transcends even these four: direct appearance is not "seen" (*mthong ba*) but recognized as awareness's own nature (*rang ngo*).>
