[16436-16437] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE KAYAS]
<Spontaneous presence from kayas three: sambhogakaya light's aspect appearance, emanation wisdom compassion's manifestation, both dharmakaya's manner is. Thus kayas three appearance-mode only different, essence not different. Essence one nature three bodies is, nature spontaneous presence three bodies is, compassion capacity three bodies is. Spontaneous presence within three bodies abiding, spontaneous presence light five colors light sambhogakaya, spontaneous presence manifestations emanation body, both dharmakaya's essence is. The three kayas are aspects of one spontaneous presence, not ontologically distinct entities. Risk of ontological multiplicity: treating the kayas as separate existences rather than descriptions of one ground.>

[16456-16470] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMPTY APPEARANCE MANIFESTATION]
<Essence empty appearance clear spontaneous presence from, kayas three appearance-mode clear, five lights wisdom's display, dharmakaya non-conceptual clear light, sambhogakaya five lights ornament wheel, emanation spheres light various forms, all self-appearances not other, natural expression clear light essence. Empty and clear inseparable: empty is not void but the capacity for appearance, clear is not substance but unobstructed manifestation. The ground is empty appearance, not empty then appearance. Risk of substantialism: treating appearance as emerging from or grounded in something substantial rather than recognizing empty-clear as inseparable.>

[16491-16504] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – NATURAL EXPRESSION DISPLAY]
<Thus essence kayas three not established, nature five wisdoms not established, compassion emanations not established. Not established from where arise? From ground's power natural expression. Natural expression not other than ground, ground not other than natural expression. Self-appearances ground's play, play not different from player. The display arises spontaneously without cause, not from something other than itself. Risk of causal attribution: seeking a cause for appearance rather than recognizing spontaneous presence.>

[16564-16575] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – MANDALA COMPONENTS MANIFESTATION]
<Light and color's expanse: center, retinue, individual clusters, body, wisdom, father, mother, body color, hand marks etc. clear. Secret seed essence from, essence nature's appearance. The mandala components (center, retinue, deities) are spontaneous manifestations of the ground, not constructed realities. Risk of cosmological reification: treating these as actual celestial realms rather than the self-display of awareness.>

[16614-16625] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – FIVE FAMILIES PURE REALM]
<Five families' field appearance, nature pure, five lights' appearance self-clear, great enjoyment five wisdoms' aspect engaging, afflictions' pain all free. These also from Jewel Heap: "Self-clear pure sambhogakaya, five lights pure measureless palace, elaboration-free great bliss speech, body five families' retinue, entity not pure dharmas, wisdom five gathered heart from issued." The five families' pure realm is the nature of mind, not a location. Risk of spatial literalism: reading this as geographical place rather than the spontaneous display of wisdom.>

[16672-16683] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMANATION BODY DEFINITION]
<Essence, definitive term, division, enumeration four: essence—various not fixed, essence's abiding manner, attachment free, samadhi mind non-conceptual mode equally abiding. Definitive term: whatever tames thus emanated, emanation; that suitable appearance form perfect, body. The definition points to what spontaneously manifests for beings' benefit, not a functional role. Risk of functional reductionism: reducing emanation to mere utility rather than recognizing its nature as ground's display.>
