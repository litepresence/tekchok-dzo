[10472-10478] <seven-bases-framework>
<Introduction to seven bases (*gzhi bdun*)—Dzogchen's systematic classification of views on the basis (*gzhi*). Line 10472-10473: "basis seven's nature general shown and, supreme's basis particular explain"—framework overview. The seven bases are not competing theories but progressive approximations, culminating in definitive meaning (*nges don*). Line 10474-10476: Three-part structure—brief nature explanation, critique of extreme views, placement in authentic text. The seven bases are:
1. Basis primordially pure (*ka dag*)
2. Basis spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*)
3. Basis not certain (*ma nges*)
4. Basis certain meaning actual basis (*nges don dngos gzhi*)
5. Basis whatever transform able (*ci yang 'gyur*)
6. Basis whatever promise able (*ci yang khas len*)
7. Basis various (*sna tshogs*)

This is *rnal 'byor spyod pa'i dbu ma* (Yogācāra-Svātantrika) style classification—using apparent contradiction to point beyond conceptual fixation.>

[10479-10491] <bases-1-2-ka-dag-lhun-grub>
<First two bases establish Dzogchen's foundational dyad. Basis primordially pure (10490): "elaboration-free drop great's aspect from"—*spros bral thig le chen po'i cha nas*—the great bindu free from elaboration. This is *ka dag* as negation: basis not contaminated by samsara, never was. Basis spontaneous presence (10491): "awareness's nature to quality self-nature primordial dwell sun and ray's manner having and stain not-have"—*rig pa rang byung gi yon tan rang bzhin ye gnas*. Sun-ray metaphor: nature (*ngo bo*) and quality (*yon tan*) inseparable, both primordially present. Risk: Treating ka dag and lhun grub as sequential (first pure, then present) or separate (pure=emptiness, presence=appearance). Dzogchen view: simultaneous, non-dual—emptiness IS appearance, appearance IS emptiness.>

[10492-10496] <bases-3-7-progressive-refinement>
<Bases 3-7 refine view through negation of extremes:
- **Basis not certain** (10492): "awareness's nature to this is one not-established direction all elaboration-free great view"—no single definitive description possible
- **Basis certain** (10493): "awareness's nature change not view certain having"—unchanging nature provides certainty
- **Basis whatever transform able** (10494): "whatever arise view by-means-of whatever transform able"—basis manifests as all possible forms
- **Basis whatever promise able** (10495): "samsara-nirvana's dharma all arise view whatever promise able view"—basis accommodates all phenomena
- **Basis various** (10496): "awareness's nature to appear manner thought not-cease appear view by-means-of various view khra bo called"—myriad display (*khra bo*) of unceasing appearance

The progression: from purity/presence (1-2) → beyond certainty/uncertainty (3-4) → all-accommodating (5-6) → manifold display (7). Not ladder but mandala—each "view" is aspect of single recognition.>

[10497-10508] <critique-of-extreme-views>
<Lines 10497-10498: "this also awareness one to respective's tenet direction one see after placed is, consequence from"—these seven are "views" (*lta ba*) from perspective of philosophical tenets (*grub mtha'*), not direct recognition. "Fall by-means-of establish one's ground-reality" (*bden gshis*)—reifying any view misses the basis. Lines 10500-10508 summarize characteristics:
- Seven manners of abiding (*gnas tshul*)
- Spontaneous presence as various aspect
- Not-certain as move-measure
- Certain as not-move
- Appear measure as whatever transform
- Promise accompany all arising
- Delusion purify as primordial-pure
- Appear manner as khra bor

This is *thad kar* (summation)—the seven bases exhaust all possible conceptual approaches to basis, showing each insufficient. Teaching strategy: lead students through all views to transcend all views.>

[RISK: REIFICATION OF CLASSIFICATION]

<The seven bases present sophisticated trap: readers may treat classification as map of reality rather than pedagogical device. Each basis is conceptual approximation (*don spyi*), not basis itself. The progression from ka dag → lhun grub → ... → sna tshogs suggests hierarchy, but Longchenpa warns: "awareness one to respective's tenet direction one see after placed is"—these are views ABOUT awareness, not awareness itself. The "actual basis" (*dngos gzhi*) is not basis #4 but what all seven attempt to describe. Risk of "shopping" for preferred view—finding one's temperament in basis classification rather than recognizing basis beyond temperament. The seven bases are fingers, not moon. Final line "thus and" indicates continuation—framework established, now application.>

[10509-10518] <six-spaces-basis>
<Citation from *Klong drug pa* (Six Spaces Tantra): "First fall by-means-of establish one's basis" (*thog ma babs kyis grub pa'i gzhi*)—the basis established by primordial descent, not causal origination. Line 10511 "exist one from not-have from"—basis is neither one (*gcig*) nor non-existent (*med*), transcending existence/non-existence dichotomy. Lines 10512-10517: deluded appearance directions (*'khrul par snang ba'i phyogs*) vs. realization certainty (*rtogs pas gtan phab*)—the seven manners of basis appearance from delusion or recognition. This is *gzhi snang*—basis displaying as appearance, neither pure nor impure in itself. Line 10518 "that meaning this like is"—the six bases are not metaphysical claims but phenomenological descriptions of how basis appears to different cognitive conditions.>

[10519-10535] <basis-as-spontaneous-presence>
<Ten characteristics of basis (*gzhi*) as spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*):
1. **Itself-dwelling** (10519): *lhun grub nyid la gnas*—spontaneous presence as mode of being
2. **Various-gathering** (10520): *sna tshogs 'du*—collection of multiplicity in unity
3. **Not-certain** (10521): *nges med*—not fixed, accommodating all possibilities
4. **Move-do-mind** (10522): *g.yo byed sems*—aspect of moving, doing, minding
5. **Certain self-face** (10523): *nges rang ngo*—definite self-recognition aspect
6. **Remember-move-not** (10524): *dran g.yo min*—aspect of memory without movement
7. **Transform-able** (10525): *'gyur rung*—aspect of changeability
8. **Effort-mind** (10526): *rtsol sems*—aspect of effort and conceptual mind
9. **Whatever-nature** (10527-10528): *ci yin rang bzhin*—whatever appears is self-nature
10. **Khra bo** (10529): *khra bo*—variegated, manifold display

Lines 10531-10535: Primordially pure (*ka dag*), stain primordially not-have (*dri ma ye med*), self-face primordially pure—basis is pure from beginning, not purified through practice. This is *ngo bo ka dag* (essence primordially pure), distinct from *rang bzhin lhun grub* (nature spontaneously present).>

[10536-10547] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<Second section: refutation of seven bases with faults (*skyon can*). Line 10537 "blind before elephant say like"—classic Indian parable: multiple blind men touch different parts of elephant, each claims exclusive truth. Seven bases are partial views, not comprehensive. Lines 10538-10539: "awareness's direction one realize's part to cling promise deep placed one accompany after view by-means-of, that refute to meaning seven from"—those attached to partial realization of awareness cling deeply, promising profound meaning, but the seven refute this. Lines 10540-10542: first refute spontaneous presence view (*lhun grub kyi lta ba*). Two arguments against lhun grub:

**Argument 1** (10543-10446): Spontaneous presence as ground-reality (*bden gshis*) implies India never cut off (*rgya gar yang ma gcod*)—samsara would have no beginning. View would fall to any direction (*phyogs gang du yang mi ltung*), i.e., nihilism.

**Argument 2** (10547-10548): If first-from spontaneous accomplishment, then nirvana would depend on conditions (self-face knowing, etc.) rather than being primordially accomplished. This contradicts Dzogchen view of *ye nas lhun grub*.

**Consequence** (10549-10551): If basis is spontaneous presence, either (1) samsara-nirvana cannot arise (unchanging), or (2) everyone liberates effortlessly without practice. Both absurd. This is *dbu ma* (Madhyamaka) style refutation showing extremes untenable.>

<beyond-refutation>
[SYNTHESIS]

<The refutation is pedagogical, not nihilistic. Lines 10536-10551 present *sūtric provisional* critique of reifying any single view of basis—including spontaneous presence. But the critique itself is provisional. The actual Dzogchen view (10519-10535) is that basis transcends all characterizations while accommodating all appearances. The ten characteristics are not definitions but descriptions of how basis manifests to different recognitions. The seven bases framework (previous page) includes all possible views to show all views partial. The Six Spaces Tantra citation establishes scriptural authority for basis beyond causal origination (*thog ma babs*—primordial descent). Risk: Taking refutation as denial of basis itself, rather than denial of reified views of basis. The basis IS spontaneously present AND primordially pure AND not describable by any single characteristic. This is not contradiction but completion.>
