<The twofold division into effort-free primordial liberation (*'bad med ye grol*) and effortful gradual (*'bad bcas rim pas*): first is *gzhi khregs chod* (cutting through ground) for simultaneous (*cig car*) capacities; second is *lam thod rgal* (direct transcendence leap) for gradual (*rim gyis*) capacities using channels/winds essential points (*rtsa rlung gi gnad*). This is Dzogchen's *sde gsum* (three series) taxonomy: *sems sde* (cutting through), *klong sde* (direct transcendence), *man ngag gi sde* (instruction). The three essential points—body, gate, object—are *lam* (path) frameworks, not ontological requirements. Four appearances (*snang ba bzhi*) reaching measure indicates tantric completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) framework applied to Dzogchen.>

[4319-4327] <rigpa-side>
<The concluding verses on indicating tantra: "Body and speech relaxed, separated from suffering; awareness relaxed, five bodies arise." This is *man ngag* (instruction) poetry—not descriptive metaphysics but pointing-out (*ngo sprod*). The five bodies (*sku lnga*) arising from awareness relaxed indicates spontaneous display, not fabricated achievement. The phrase *rang gi rgyud la ma bskyed rdzogs* (in one's own tantra without development-completion) indicates recognition transcends staged practice.>

[4328-4346] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
<Nature tantra (*rang bzhin gyi rgyud*): ground-path-result meaning (*gzh lam 'bras bu'i don*). The etymology as "continuous (*rgyud*) because determined as pervading all and nature producing buddhahood" indicates tantric view of *rgyud* as transformative continuity. The threefold division—ground, essence, potency nature tantras—maps Dzogchen structure onto tantric terminology: ground nature tantra as primordial pure (*ka dag*) awareness essence-nature-compassion (*ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje*), essence nature tantra as wisdom-threefold-essence, potency nature tantra as ripened result of practice. This is hermeneutical translation between systems, not ontological hierarchy.>

[4347-4356] <rigpa-side>
<Essence nature tantra (*snying po rang bzhin gyi rgyud*): wisdom-threefold-essence arising from heart in essence-mode. The four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) arising from ground-nature-tantra's power-basis appearance-eye indicates *thod rgal* (direct transcendence) framework—spontaneous luminosity, not fabricated visualization. The path-four-appearances (*lam snang ba bzhi*) actually seen (*dngos su mthong*) indicates *thod rgal*'s visionary progression as direct perception, not meditation-generated experiences.>

[4358-4392] <rigpa-side>
<The three clarities (*gsal ba gsum*), three confidences (*gdeng gsum*), three irreversibilities (*mi ldog pa gsum*), three appearances (*snang ba gsum*), three emptinesses (*stong pa gsum*)—these taxonomies describe recognition's qualities, not progressive attainments. The phrase *sku dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa'i dgongs pa* (intent of body and wisdom without meeting/parting) indicates *sku gsum* and *ye shes lnga* as non-dual display. The threefold clarification (*gsal ba gsum*)—external objects, awareness-body, space-awareness—demonstrates *thod rgal* visionary recognition of display as display.>

[4381-4392] <rigpa-side>
<The three emptinesses—delusion empty because awareness inexpressible, mind empty because conditionless, light empty because no coming/going—indicate *stong pa* as recognition's nature, not nihilistic void. Ground tantra (*gzhir rgyud*) etymology: all buddhas/beings born from it therefore outermost (*phyi mo*) tantra, or recognized as buddha-tantra, unrecognized as being-tantra. This is hermeneutical, not ontological: same *rig pa* recognized or not.>

[4393-4416] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
<Method tantra (*thabs kyi rgyud*) as part of ground tantra: the meaning itself as indicated-ground. The phrase *gzhir rig pa la ma brten pa'i sangs rgyas sems can gang yang med* (no buddhas/beings not relying on ground-awareness) establishes *rig pa* as universal ground. The need for guru's instruction (*bla ma'i man ngag*) to indicate demonstrates tantric framework: even universal ground requires pointing-out. Liberation upon realization (*rtogs nas grol ba*) as result (*'bras bu*) indicates tantric causal logic, not Dzogchen's primordial liberation.>

[4407-4416] <sems-side>
<Essence tantra (*snying po'i rgyud*) as *rig pa*; flower tantra (*me tog gi rgyud*) as four lamps (*sgron ma bzhi*) seen/recognized; potency tantra (*bcud kyi rgyud*) as practice-ripened result. These are pedagogical entry points, not separate ontological categories. The phrase *lam du 'phang byed* (shooting/throwing as path) indicates tantric gradualism; citations from various tantras establish textual authority for this framework. *Dbyings rig 'du 'bral med pa'i bcud* (potency of space-awareness without meeting/parting) bridges to Dzogchen view.>

[4417-4485] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
<Extensive citations from *Mu tig phreng ba*, *Sangs rgyas kun gyi bcud bsdus*, *Brtson pa don ldan gyi rgyud*, *Rdo rje nam mkha' dang mnyam pa'i rgyud*, *Gser 'od dam pa* establish tantric textual lineage. The citations emphasize: (1) all buddhas' potency condensed, (2) dharmatā direct path as all teachings' essence, (3) ground/essence/flower as nature tantra, (4) reliance on ground/nature/method for easy Buddhahood. These are authoritative grounding (*lung*) for the taxonomy, not philosophical arguments. The unified meaning (*don ngo bo gcig*) beneath five names demonstrates hermeneutical principle: different terms, single recognition.>

[4440-4485] <rigpa-side>
<Citation from *Mu tig phreng ba*: ground as essence-nature-compassion, pervading all, three wisdoms' nature, primordially pure, without meeting/parting, uniquely singular, great secret of buddhas. This describes *gzhi* (ground) as Dzogchen view—primordial purity (*ka dag*) and spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) unified. The phrase *ma bskyed rdzogs pas snying po che* (great essence of unfabricated completion) indicates *dzogchen* proper: beyond *bskyed rdzogs* (development/completion), not within tantric staged framework.>

[4486-4501] <rigpa-side>
<From single ground-awareness-nature arise indicated and indicating method tantras, and from nature ground/essence/potency—five different names but meaning not transcending single essence. The citation from *Mu tig phreng ba*: "From single ground-essence's distinction, method and nature tantras merely imputed, essence single ground, nature empty, not different, unchanging." This is definitive (*nges don*) statement: all taxonomies provisional (*tha snyad*), single *chos nyid* definitive. The analogy of one person with many names illustrates hermeneutical principle: recognition sees through names to nameless.>

[4502-4518] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
<Word tantra (*tshig gi rgyud*) classification: sixfold brief indication of synonyms (*rnam grangs mdor bstan*)—tantras as ocean-deep (*rgya mtsho*), sun-clear (*nyi ma*), lion-overpowering (*seng ge rtsal*), mountain-king-like (*ri rgyal*), wheel-cutting (*'khor lo*), key-opening (*lde mig*), etc. These are metaphorical designations (*mtshan*) for tantric texts by function, not content descriptions. The analogy pattern—mirror showing reflection, precious gem, mother-child connection—establishes pedagogical accessibility (*go bde*) through familiar images. This is *bshad rgyud* (explanation tantra) style: elaborating what *man ngag* condenses.>
