[2833-2855] <four-visions-of-thodgal>
This section presents the four visions (snang ba bzhi) of thodgal practice—the progressive stages through which spontaneous presence manifests. From the Dzogchen perspective, these visions are not achievements to be attained but the natural unfolding of awareness when unobstructed by conceptual mind.

The epistemic framework here employs <definitive-meaning> in understanding the four visions. They represent progressively deeper recognitions of the display of awareness, culminating in the exhaustion of phenomena into primordial purity. These are not psychological experiences but direct perceptions of reality.

The <dzogchen-view> recognizes the four visions as the self-manifestation of the ground's spontaneous presence. They are not created by practice but revealed when obscurations dissolve. The practitioner does not "have" visions but allows them to arise as the natural expression of awareness.

The distinction between <ultimate-truth> and <conventional-truth> in the four visions is the recognition that while visions appear (conventional), they are empty by nature (ultimate). The practitioner recognizes each vision as the play of awareness, neither grasping nor rejecting.

The viewpoint tag <view-assertion> establishes the four visions in order:

1. Direct perception of dharmata (chos nyid mngon sum gyi snang ba): The initial vision where awareness recognizes its own nature as empty and luminous.

2. Increase of experience (nyams gong 'phel): The vision expands and intensifies as recognition deepens, manifesting as bindus, light rays, and pure realms.

3. Maturation of awareness (rig pa tshad phebs): The vision matures into stable recognition, where awareness is fully present in all its dimensions.

4. Exhaustion of phenomena (chos zad): All phenomena dissolve into primordial purity; awareness recognizes itself as the source and substance of all appearance.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to work with each vision. The practitioner neither blocks nor follows the visions but maintains recognition of their nature as awareness's display. Each vision deepens the recognition established in trekcho.

The section discusses the relationship between the four visions and the path. They represent natural stages of recognition, not goals to be achieved. The practitioner progresses through them naturally as obscurations dissolve and recognition stabilizes.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for the four visions, recognizing them as definitive manifestations of awareness. While they appear progressively, their nature is the same—empty yet luminous display of primordial purity.

The section thus presents the four visions as the natural stages of thodgal practice, the progressive manifestation of spontaneous presence as awareness recognizes itself.

[2856-2872] <four-lamps>
This section presents the four lamps (sgron ma bzhi) of thodgal practice—the conditions that allow the four visions to manifest. From the Dzogchen perspective, the four lamps create the optimal conditions for spontaneous presence to appear, though they do not create the visions themselves.

The epistemic framework here employs <definitive-meaning> in understanding the four lamps. They are not causes that produce effects but conditions that allow what is already present to manifest. The visions are the natural expression of awareness; the lamps create the conditions for this expression.

The <dzogchen-view> recognizes the four lamps as skillful means that facilitate recognition. They are not ultimately necessary—awareness is always present—but they are conventionally useful for creating the conditions where recognition can occur.

The distinction between <ultimate-truth> and <conventional-truth> in the four lamps is the recognition that while conventionally we use specific practices, ultimately awareness requires no conditions. The lamps are fingers pointing at the moon, not the moon itself.

The viewpoint tag <view-assertion> establishes the four lamps:

1. The lamp of the hollow crystal tube (tshigs bu shel gyi sgron ma): The channels of the subtle body through which awareness manifests.

2. The lamp of the smooth white channel (rtsa bkra dkar gyi sgron ma): The central channel as the pathway of primordial wisdom.

3. The lamp of the far-reaching water (rgyangs zhings chu yi sgron ma): The eye consciousness as the gateway for visions.

4. The lamp of self-arisen wisdom (ye shes rang byung gi sgron ma): The innate awareness that is the source of all manifestation.

The [MEDITATION INSTRUCTION] component describes how to work with the four lamps. Specific gazes, postures, and practices activate these conditions, allowing the visions to manifest naturally. The practitioner works with the lamps while maintaining recognition that the source is awareness itself.

The section discusses the relationship between the four lamps and the four visions. The lamps create the conditions; the visions are the natural manifestation. Neither can be neglected—the lamps without recognition are empty; recognition without the lamps may not fully manifest.

The epistemic stance maintains [NGES DON] for the four lamps as conditions, while recognizing that the definitive truth is awareness itself. The lamps are provisional means; the recognition is definitive.

The section thus presents the four lamps as the framework for thodgal practice, the conditions that allow the natural manifestation of spontaneous presence.
