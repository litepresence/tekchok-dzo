<classification> Three subsystems progressively—delusion root cut therefore samsara/nirvana view reversed never experienced delusion from primordial. Delusion self-removed therefore non-deluded dharmata recognized. Delusion-basis pierced therefore delusion-samsara continuum severed. Transcended delusion/non-delusion indicating recognition beyond both.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Drop established in self-essential-point system's essence as singularly unique, free from elaborations, without partiality. Nature as non-multiple therefore dharmata universally pervading. Characteristics as introduction therefore confidence completely determined. Man ngag gi sde pointing-out—direct introduction rather than philosophical argument.

<classification> Explanation tantra fourfold cycle classification—outer afflictions without abandonment therefore five poisons as path; inner not material therefore signless dharmata; secret introduction and realization obtained simultaneously; unsurpassed secret not depending on words. Progressive subtlety classifications for different capacities.

<classification> Three nature-characteristic correlations in secret cycles—breath-ceased and Buddhahood simultaneous not dependent on effort. Buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneous not dependent on accumulations. Spontaneous accomplishment framing—recognition's natural qualities not cultivated but self-manifest. Means and wisdom simultaneous indicating non-dual method-view.

<classification> Unsurpassed secret essence—not depending on words therefore wisdom completely self-sufficient. Nature directly seen therefore not abiding in investigative grasping view. Four appearances reaching measure—the four visions of Dzogchen path. Result not dependent on three kayas/five wisdoms because intrinsic perfection precedes result-structuring.

<classification> Progressive reconvergence statistics mapping nine spaces onto three series—sems sde into 5,000 named tantras; klong sde into 3,000; man ngag gi sde into 12,000. Enumerations encode pedagogical completeness. Divisions demonstrating hermeneutical flexibility—same teachings viewed through different recognition modalities.

<classification> Man ngag gi sde reconvergence into three spaces—play unceasing, mind not unliberated, essence without good/bad. Characterizing man ngag approach: pointing directly to spontaneous presence without structured meditation. Statistics culminating in threefold classification of essential-point gathering/seeing/knowing.

<classification> Final reconvergence statistics completing corpus organization—obstacles 1,500, essential points 87, threefold spheres. Classification into teaching and treatise, treatise into tantra/scripture/instruction. Fourfold recitation categories providing progressive access points to same recognition.

<view>tantric-transformative
<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Chapter transition marking shift from Dzogchen doxography to tantric framework. Definition of tantra as awareness and that which establishes it definitively, great secret adding/subtracting impossible, direct certainty. Tantra as transformative continuity producing birth in that family, not merely textual genre.
