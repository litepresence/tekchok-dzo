[2833-2835] <two-truths-introduction>
<classification>
The two truths (bden pa gnyis)—conventional (kun rdzob) and ultimate (don dam)—are presented as the framework for understanding all phenomena. This is the foundational Madhyamaka hermeneutic. The Root Wisdom (Mulamadhyamakakarika) citation establishes this as canonical. The text will develop the two truths in detail: conventional divides into false (log pa) and true (yang dag), while ultimate divides into nominal (rnam grangs pa) and non-nominal (rnam grangs ma yin pa). <dzogchen-view> transcends this framework while using it pedagogically.

[2836-2843] <conventional-truth-definition>
<classification>
Conventional truth is defined as phenomena appearing to confused perception ('khrul snang), possessing functional efficacy (don byed nugs pa) while being empty of inherent existence (ngo bo nyid kyis dben pa). This is the MAYA framework—appearance without substance. The citation from Mayajala Tantra uses the eight examples of illusion to demonstrate that phenomena appear while lacking inherent existence. <conventional-truth> operates without contradiction: things function conventionally while being empty ultimately.

[2844-2861] <false-conventional-analysis>
<classification>
False conventional (log pa'i kun rdzob) refers to ordinary deluded appearances—objects appearing as truly existent to confused perception. The defining characteristic: appearing to function (don byed snang ba) while being empty when analyzed. The eight similes (dream, illusion, city of gandharvas, etc.) establish that appearance does not entail inherent existence. This is not denial of appearance but recognition of its empty nature. <provisional-meaning> establishes the framework; <definitive-meaning> recognizes appearance-emptiness unity.

[2862-2869] <true-conventional-virtue>
<classification>
True conventional (yang dag kun rdzob) refers to virtuous phenomena that function as causes for higher rebirth and liberation—the ten virtuous actions, six perfections, path of seeing and meditation. These are conventionally real and functionally effective while being ultimately empty. The Uttaratantra citation notes that all path-truths are compounded ('dus byas) and therefore conventional. This does not devalue them but contextualizes their status. <conventional-truth> is not inferior to ultimate truth; they are two perspectives on the same phenomena.
</classification>

[2870-2872] <ultimate-truth-preliminary>
<classification>
Ultimate truth (don dam bden pa) is introduced as emptiness (stong pa nyid) in its two forms: nominal ultimate (rnam grangs pa) and non-nominal ultimate (rnam grangs ma yin pa). The former refers to emptiness as conceptual understanding; the latter to emptiness as direct realization beyond concepts. <definitive-meaning> points to the non-nominal ultimate—rigpa beyond all conceptual elaboration (spros bral). The two truths are not separate realities but two ways of describing experience: how it appears conventionally and how it is ultimately.
