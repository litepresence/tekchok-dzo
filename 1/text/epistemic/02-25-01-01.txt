[15635-15661] <liberation-as-original-purity>
*Mu-tig-phreng-ba*: "Liberation place itself is primordial!" Primordial primordial purity, awareness self-recognition, now cause not return, confusion-basis exhausted, result called name becomes! Detailed above ground's section explained, particularly stain-free divided, know!

[CONTEXT] FRUITION TERMINOLOGY: The shift from "ground" (*gzhi*) to "result" (*'bras bu*) is nominal, not ontological. Longchenpa establishes that "result" is merely a name for recognition of what was never other than primordially pure. This reflects the *snying thig* view that path and fruition are non-dual.

Second, three: expanse liberation actual; expanse dwelling nature; expanse dharmatā's intent how coiled! First: faculties sharp-dull-medium three liberation time, result difference not, time three Buddhas all intent exhausted Dharmakāya expression-free that itself one, face-equal difference-free nature thigle essence single Buddha! Also this life spontaneously accomplished or bardo self-appearance recognized, or emanation field breath sent, path-appearance's body and wisdom's appearance outer-clear aspects, spontaneous presence dissolution manner stages expanse into dissolve, crystal-light inside gathered like time, appearance emptiness liberates! Wisdom expanse dissolved, form-body Dharmakāya's expanse parinirvāṇa, entity and sign not, space-like dharmatā taste one—space space into dissolve like!

Risk: Temporalization—reading dissolution as chronological process rather than atemporal recognition.

[15662-15673] <dissolution-analogies>
<That time samsara itself first-last cut called. Thus sky mixed or, outer appearance self-light's rays dharmadhatu dissolved, sun setting rays self gathered; water into water dissolved; butter into butter dissolved likewise. From blazing relic: then essence kadag, from sun rays gather like, self-appearance emanation with, self-essence self-dissolved, difference not division not becomes. As water into water dissolves. The dissolution analogies point to non-dual recognition, not literal merging of substances. Risk of substantialism: treating dissolution as mixing of entities rather than recognition of non-duality.>

[15700-15711] <samantabhadra-fruition>
<Experience nirvana exhaustion time feelings' gate also self self-ceased. Heat and signs self-exhausted nirvana time afflictions self-exhausted emptied made. Exhaustion dharma this practice's person develop and self-perfected. Essence this abiding's person fortunate who sees: this Buddhas all's result Samantabhadra's essence self-abides. Buddhas' result this who habits glorious Vajradhara also becomes. First protector stainless purity light's sheath self-arisen dawned, Buddhas all's activity's self also secret supreme great body obtained, from that not-returning yogi intelligence power possessing fortunate. Result all's measure arrived Samantabhadra equal. Samantabhadra represents the ground's nature, not a person. Risk of personification: treating Samantabhadra as an entity rather than the primordial state.>

[15736-15747] <natural-appearance-without-marks>
<Actual wherever established not, that itself from: nature's appearance, marks holding not at all, color not self-clear, knowing and rigpa's aspects merely, holding's object whatever not, therefore conceptualization's holding aspect not. Light transcended self-resonance, primordially distinction abides. Body transcended self-resonance, pure great mudra abides. The natural appearance transcends all conceptual marks. Risk of conceptualization: attempting to mentally grasp or categorize the transcendent nature.>

[15774-15785] <elements-purification>
<Impure five elements pure five wisdoms' great elements appearance visible relying, pure result divisions arranged. Also wind vajra cross arrangement good, samaya goddess sky coiling unmoved wind dharmadhatu dissolved. Earth jewel five's stupa even balanced manner abiding, hard not earth dharmadhatu dissolved. Water crystal wheel stacked good, karma and afflictions' part free, moist not water dharmadhatu dissolved. Fire lotus net light blazing, unripened ripened made, hot not fire dharmadhatu dissolved. Space pure dharmata expanse vast, primordially pure impure delusion opening space dharmadhatu dissolved. Outer objects, inner body, aggregates elements and sense-bases etc. dharmas all pure, wisdom jewel's essence empty all-arising mandala expanse. The elemental purification is metaphorical, not alchemical transformation. Risk of alchemical literalism: treating these as literal elemental transmutations rather than recognition of wisdom nature.>

[15806-15817] <aggregates-dissolution>
<Earth completely nirvana, feeling aggregate pure. Fire completely nirvana, consciousness aggregate pure. Wind completely nirvana, compositional factors aggregate pure. Second, wisdom dharmadhatu dissolved: five afflictions five wisdoms pure self-resonance five inner dharmadhatu clear light dissolved, deep resonance five color's ground abiding. From Six Expanse: self-resonance moved white part, deep clarity great itself abides. The dissolution of aggregates into dharmadhatu is not annihilation but purification. Risk of annihilationism: mistaking dissolution for destruction rather than recognition of purity.>

[15842-15851] <deep-clarity-ground>
<From that itself: "Primordially self-pure great, perfected peak abides, stone-with marks self-pure, deep clarity great ground abides." From Self-Arisen: "Jewel variously arranged net, balanced." Fourth, clear light dharmadhatu coiling four: dissolving not-dull. The deep clarity is the ground's nature, not a substantial entity. Risk of substantialism: treating clarity as a thing rather than the empty luminosity of awareness.>

[15883-15892] <samadhi-continuity>
<Continuous samadhi gathering-separation not, dharmata inconceivable samadhi change not. Fourth: self-arisen rigpa inner clear spontaneous presence great abiding, jewel sheath change not abides. These also from Self-Arisen: "Jewel vajra seat change not, jewel empty path termination not, intent self-abiding oral instruction shown." The samadhi continuity is natural, not cultivated. Risk of meditationism: treating this as achieved through meditation effort rather than recognition of natural state.>

[15927-15936] <great-perfection-qualities>
<Unchanging completely vast great, subtle holding difficult great, great seeing not great, round shape not great, moving breath not great, clear color black great, not-existing soft great, appearance examining difficult great, empty appearance great. These paradoxical qualities describe what transcends ordinary categories. Risk of attribution error: applying ordinary conceptual attributes to the transcendent ground.>

[15962-15971] <rigpa-wisdom-seed>
<Rigpa wisdom's seed increase-decrease not, rigpa empty-clear wisdom not divided, rigpa holding-free wisdom face-taking extreme free, rigpa concept-free wisdom not-ceased completely clear, rigpa all-clear wisdom not-mixed completely perfected, rigpa all-appearance wisdom clear holding not, rigpa all-clear wisdom clear spontaneous thick. From Self-Arisen: "Jewel measureless palace arrangement good, jewel variously spread lady ornament good." The seed metaphor points to what is already complete, not potential to be developed. Risk of seed potentiality error: treating rigpa as a seed to be nurtured rather than recognizing its primordial completion.>

[16001-16010] <non-learning-path>
<Tamed guide compassion path body and, wisdom and activity outer appearance dawned relying, non-learning path explained. Third, body and wisdom's dawning ground certainly two: dawning ground ascertainment, nature extensively explained. First also dawning ground actual and, that wrong view refutation two: first, abandonment-realization final dharmakaya kadag spontaneous presence jewel sheath that body and wisdom's dawning ground is. The non-learning path is not anti-intellectual but recognition beyond acquisition. Risk of anti-intellectualism: rejecting study and reflection rather than recognizing their provisional nature.>

[16045-16054] <buddhahood-without-grasping>
<Truly Buddha time's kadag that whatsoever not established, body and wisdom's dharma also not, dawning ground also not. Some say: body and wisdom actually abiding, that not, result's dharmakaya and wisdom not obtained, or obtained then declined. Refutation two: reasoning first, Buddha wisdom not, self-benefit and other benefit not arise, what not sky empty difference not. Second, entity-speak some like, dharmakaya that entity and marks established, coarse like existing. The Buddha's wisdom transcends existence and non-existence. Risk of nihilism: interpreting "not established" as utter non-existence rather than freedom from conceptual extremes.>

[16080-16089] <wisdom-negation-and-affirmation>
<That wisdom not, beings' benefit and Buddha's dharma immeasurable certainly not become. From Condensed: "Wisdom not, qualities increase not bodhi and, ocean-like Buddha dharma also not become." These wisdom not said, essence whatsoever not established negation. Wisdom existing said, nature spontaneous presence part described, contradiction not, kadag and spontaneous presence non-dual. Second, nature extensively explained: dharmadhatu kadag's dharmakaya's mode wisdom spontaneous presence subtle nature abiding. The apparent contradiction between wisdom's existence and non-existence is resolved in non-dual understanding. Risk of contradiction: taking the negations and affirmations as logical opposites rather than skillful means.>

[16115-16126] <compassion-wisdom-ground>
<Compassion wisdom two's dawning ground do, object and aspect actual meet not. From Spontaneous Liberation: "That also essence body abiding, dharma and sambhogakaya enjoyment emanation's part, not divided doing not manner, momentum established from, body color etc. mind object not, nature dawning light's manner, white red yellow and green blue, marks appearance not, appearance not knowing's momentum established, compassion dawning various from." Compassion and wisdom are non-dual, not functional complements. Risk of dualistic functionalism: treating compassion and wisdom as separate functions that work together rather than inseparable aspects of the ground.>

[16176-16187] <kadag-seed-abiding>
<Kadag time this actual, who not, part seed's manner abiding. From Six Expanse: "Essence nature and, compassion's appearance pure, childish intellects appearance, essence whatsoever not established, nature appearance aspect clear appearance, compassion's part wisdom two, doer and doing not dawned, dawn appearance intellect level two's for, wisdom activity thus." The seed metaphor describes primordial completion, not potential awaiting development. Risk of potentiality error: treating the seed as potential to be actualized rather than always-already perfect.>

[16219-16230] <appearance-without-proliferation>
<Self-face existence non-existence's proliferation ceased, body and wisdom even not established, other-appearance Buddha's compassion and, tamed's aspiration form body activity with appearance, space bird's offering pillar and jewel and wish-fulfilling tree like desire. From Avatamsaka: "Peace body wish-fulfilling tree like clear becomes, mind-jewel as non-conceptual, liberation in between world benefit always, this proliferation free appearance is." Here also kadag's self-face that like, subtle wisdom dharmadhatu exists from body and wisdom dawns. The freedom from proliferation is not non-existence. Risk of nihilism: interpreting non-establishment as utter void rather than freedom from conceptual extremes.>

[16255-16266] <three-kaya-luminosity>
<Essence nature compassion's self, wisdom body three light clear, sky sun dawn darkness dispels, wisdom five's marks clear, Buddha emanation immeasurable arise. Body two divisions: ground kadag and spontaneous presence non-dual rigpa, path dharmadhatu and wisdom two experience, result dharmakaya aspect two dawned benefit completion. From Spontaneous Liberation: "Dharmakaya form body clear." The three kayas are descriptions of one nature, not hierarchical levels. Risk of hierarchical tripartition: treating the three kayas as graduated stages rather than simultaneous aspects.>

[16299-16310] <buddha-exclusive-dharmas>
<Muni only's non-mixed dharmas, eighteen explained whatever and, aspect all knowing and, dharmakaya called. Marks thirty-two and, signs eighty's self this, great vehicle near enjoyment for, muni's sambhogakaya body intended. Whoever samsara as long as, beings benefit various. The eighteen exclusive dharmas and marks describe recognition, not attainments. Risk of attribution error: treating these as qualities possessed by a Buddha rather than descriptions of non-dual recognition.>
