<classification> Title protocol establishing nges don (definitive meaning) register. "Theg mchog mdzod" situates text within Atiyoga as apex of nine vehicles—asserting direct recognition of awareness-nature over gradualist approaches. Spoken from recognition-register as hermeneutical claim, not comparative evaluation.

<classification> Homage encoding five perfections onto three bodies framework. Fivefold prostration traces Samantabhadra → Five Families → Ocean Teacher → Five Vidyādharas → Three Worlds' Ornament. Pedagogical topology where each "level" is simultaneous aspect of single recognition, not hierarchical lineage. Risk of temporalizing simultaneous aspects as sequential attainment.

<classification> Ground (gzhi) characterization via gdod nas rnam dag (primordially pure) and spros kun zhi ba (cessation of elaborations). Seven horses metaphor indicates lhun grub (spontaneous accomplishment) without causal dependence. Spoken from primordial recognition-register. Risk of reifying "primordial" as temporal origin rather than timeless immediacy.

<classification> Vehicle hierarchy establishing theg pa (vehicle) triad: causal vehicles → secret mantra → Atiyoga. Phrase "de dag nang nas" (among these) frames Dzogchen as rtse mo (pinnacle)—not superiority claim but ngo bo gcig (single nature) recognition. Mngon sum snying po (direct essence) points to immediate de kho na nyid (suchness) without bya rtsol (effort). Polemical distinction clarifies view-register without denigrating lower vehicles.

<classification> Three-kaya (sku gsum) framework classified by ston pa (teacher), gnas (place), and bstan pa (teaching)—Chandragomin-style triad applied to buddhology. Dharmakaya as bdud rtsi (nectar) indicates nature as restorative essence. Gnas phun sum tshogs (perfect place) as chos nyid 'od gsal gyi gzhi uses genitive gyi to assert identity: ground IS luminosity, not possessing it. Declarative assertion of recognition-nature.

<classification> Samantabhadra "abiding in state inseparable from kayas and wisdom" (sku dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa) describes chos sku'i rang bzhin (Dharmakaya nature) as bya rtsol las 'das pa (beyond activity/effort). Nang gsal phra ba'i ye shes (inner clarity subtle awareness) points to gdod ma'i dbyings (primordial expanse)—recognition-state, not location.

Sutra, Vinaya, Abhidharma as theg pa sna tshogs (various vehicles) prepare for 'bras bu rdo rje'i theg pa—recognition-ground preparation, not linear prerequisite.

"Beyond peak" (rtse mo'i 'das pa) indicates transcendence of vehicle-concept itself—theg pa'i rtse mo that is no vehicle. Polemical distinction establishing view beyond comparison.

<classification> Citation from gsang ba rgyal po'i mdzod (Guhyagarbha Tantra) grounding exposition in anuttarayoga textual tradition. "Primordial protector" (gdod ma'i mgon po) manifesting awakening describes ye shes (primordial wisdom) not shes bya (learned knowledge).

<classification> Sky-pervading space containing sentient beings pervaded by Buddha emanations—all activity emerges from this recognition. Some directly through Samantabhadra's emanations, others through other-tantra Buddhas—all ultimately from Samantabhadra showing path and generating bodhicitta. Display-diversity, not historical genealogy. Final declaration of unified recognition-source.
