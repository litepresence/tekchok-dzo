[5640-5653] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION-GATHERING]
<The recognition-gathering teaching (*de las so sor rtog pa'i gru chad du snang ba ni*)—this is *upāya*: when recognition arises, cognition (*sor rtog pa*) gathers (*gru*) completely (*chad du*) recognition's appearance (*snang ba ni*). The gnad that therefore recognition's experience (*nyams*) spontaneously arises (*'phel 'byung ba'o*)—this indicates that recognition-experience is not something caused but arises naturally from dependence. Risk of reification: treating "recognition-gathering" as metaphysical entity rather than recognition-descriptions of experience modes.>

[5650-5662] [NYINGMA TRADITION & LINEAGE HISTORY]
<The Nyingma tradition (*gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*) and treasure lineage (*gter brgyud*) represent two primary transmission streams of *snying thig*—the oral lineage (*snyan brgyud*) and treasure lineage (*gter brgyud*). The gnad that reliance on such masters (*de ltar pa'i thogs kyis zhag gsum*) guarantees liberation without doubt (*'di'am bar do*)—this is *upāya*: when one relies on masters without doubt, the result is certain liberation (*'di'am bar do*). Risk of lineage-reification: treating "reliance" as faith-based dependency rather than transmission facilitation through recognition.>

[5650-5665] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – BODY POSTURE KEY POINTS]
<Dharmakaya's posture seven: body straight like arrow, mind space dissolving, appearance mind not different, empty clear not grasping, rigpa fresh not dull, six consciousnesses naturally clear, experience without separation. These seven are key points of posture, not the recognition itself. Risk of postural reductionism: believing correct posture alone brings liberation rather than recognizing posture supports but does not constitute recognition.>

[5654-5910] [SUPREME GURUS & LINEAGE HISTORY]
<The supreme gurus (*rnal 'byor ma bstan pa*)—these are ultimate authorities. The gnad that such ones have (*rin po che*)—establishes their supreme status (*grub mchog*) and authority (*gnas yod*). The gnad that one (*gcig*) relies (*ltar*)—indicates singular focus. The statement that "those who properly practice" (*dam pa'i slar bzhin pa yin*)—this sets up *upāya* for proper transmission without deviation. The gnad that liberation (*'bras pa*)—this indicates that goal is actual liberation (*'bras pa*), not just correct understanding. Risk of devotion-based attainment: treating "liberation from gurus" as grace-based rather than recognition of one's own nature.>

[5654-5910] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RECOGNITION-CUTTING]
<The cognition-cutting teaching (*de nas so sor rtog pa'i me tog gi tshom bur 'char ba ni*)—this is provisional teaching for detaching from conceptual cognition. The gnad that wisdom's skillful spelling liberates (*de kha dog rab tu spel legs pa las byung ba'o*)—this indicates that wisdom's precise analysis (*rab tu spel*) through clarity (*rab tu*) skill (*legs pa*) liberates (*las byung ba*). Risk of cognition-objectification: treating "cognition" as some separate entity to eliminate rather than recognition of its self-nature.>

[5666-5684] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SAMBHOGAKAYA POSTURE]
<Sambhogakaya posture seven: body cross-legged vajra, channels not pressured, winds balanced, awareness clear not dull, appearances luminous, bliss warmth naturally arising, non-conceptual samadhi. The seven points support recognition but are not recognition itself. Risk of formalism: treating the form as sufficient without the view of recognition.>

[5685-5709] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – DHARMAKĀYA POSTURE AS FEARLESSNESS]
That reversed, outer confused-appearance ceases, inner body-mind heat arises! Both palms earth joining, changing karma-wind reverses! That reversed, outer thigle and thigle-drop dawns, inner day-night without experience arises! Neck mind slightly embrace, grasping karma-wind reverses! That reversed, outer body's appearance seen, inner wind's movement exhausts! Dharmakāya's dwelling also: sound explained: "Lion three powers complete, to any not fear," body vital-point three realms' fear dispels!

[CONTEXT] POSTURE SYMBOLISM: The "lion posture" (*seng ge*) represents the Dharmakāya stance—fearless, unmoving, and all-vanquishing. This triad of postures (elephant for Sambhogakāya, lion for Dharmakāya) mirrors the three-kāya structure in somatic form, a characteristic Nyingma *snying thig* teaching.

Meaning's manner division also: continuous joining vital-point: body dog-joint sitting, expanse and awareness joining makes! Sole feet earth pressing, various conceptions cease! Hand's fingers joints bent, feet two's inner side inserted, karma and afflictions' movement empties! Upper body hollow placed, always dharmatā not separate makes! Root neck placed, dharmatā's meaning not moving support makes! Second, resting wisdom's vital-point: both soles earth placed, knee slightly outer, dog-joint sitting—pervasive karma-wind reverses! That reversed, outer wisdom direction pure appearance seen, inner afflictions' stream bundle ceases! Both palms inner side inserted, grasping karma-wind ceases!

Risk: Formalism—taking postures as ritual forms rather than direct recognition supports.

[5685-5692] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – WIND REVERSAL THROUGH POSTURE]
<That returning outward delusion-vision ceases, inward body-mind warmth arises. Two palms pressed earth, moving action wind returns. That returning outward thigle and particles dawn, inward day-night without experience arises. Chin mind slightly raised, grasping wind returns. That returning outward body's vision sees, inward wind's movement exhausts! The postures reverse the winds, but this is recognition not technique. Risk of technological reductionism: treating this as mechanical wind-control rather than wisdom-display.>

[5693-5716] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – DHARMAKAYA POSTURE THREE UNMOVING]
<Dharmakaya's posture speech explained: three unmoving essence realized, three bindings measure obtained, three confidences liberation shown, four fearlessnesses. Body like three perfected lions' strengths, whoever without fear, body's key point dispels three realms' fear. Continuous sitting key point—body dog's crouch dharmadhatu and rigpa meet. The posture is support for recognition, not recognition itself. Risk of postural obsession: fixating on physical position rather than recognizing mind's nature.>

[5717-5734] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR EMPOWERMENTS FOUR CONFIDENCES]
<Four empowerments' fruit direct becoming arising! Dharmata direct perception body like tortoise-shell vessel—channels slowly abiding. Dzogchen meaning effort-free, body's limbs entered! Pot empowerment elaborate wisdom self-arisen! Increase-above body like diseased person—central wind entered! Secret empowerment non-elaborate wisdom! Measure-arrived body like sinking elephant—mind channels wind obtained! Heart entered prajna wisdom! Four confidences: view confidence, meditation confidence, action confidence, result confidence. The empowerments and confidences are recognition, not ritual transmissions. Risk of ritualism: treating these as ceremonies rather than pointing to natural state.>

[5873-5892] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – FOUR GREAT CONFIDENCES]
<Buddha's qualities heard also obtain hope and thrill not—self-established three bodies complete confidence! Action and afflictions' cause-effect heard also delusion-vision samsara fall fear not—cause-effect transcended confidence! Nirvana's own place seen also liberate hope's joy-thrill not—primordial purity self-complete strong place obtained confidence! Four arising! From Jewel Garland. The four confidences are natural expressions, not attained certainties. Risk: treating confidence as attachment to certainty rather than freedom from doubt.>

[5907-5910] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – TEN GROUNDS SIMULTANEOUS]
<From Self-Arisen: "Ground called elsewhere existing not! Truth-seeing person one to grounds all complete existing!" Introduction-shown person that, first truth-seeing's time joy arisen is first ground Great Joy! That self-vision awareness-ground second ground Stainless obtained! Then habituation third ground Light-Doing! Habituated light's vision seeing fourth ground Light-Radiating! Fifth Difficult-to-Overcome, sixth Manifest, seventh Far-Going, eighth Immovable, ninth Perfect Intellect, tenth Cloud-Dharma! All ten grounds are complete in one moment of truth-seeing. Risk of stage progression: reading these as sequential rather than simultaneous.>
