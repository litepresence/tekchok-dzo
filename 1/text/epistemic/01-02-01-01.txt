[635-650] <thal-fields-continued>
<Eighth Thal field Sound (*thal ba'i sgra*)—south-east left, six worlds passed, protector-benefit completely surrounded, victory-banner umbrella raised, flower-rain and smell, teacher and teaching surrounded by beautiful-form reflection assembly, bliss-play arising. Ninth Thal field Wind (*thal ba'i rlung*)—south-west right, six passed below, moving and hovering in intermediate space, sounds arising from movement, teacher's teaching moved by wind, five-possessing entering three. Tenth Thal field Jewel-Thal (*rin chen thal ba*)—thirteen stacked above, auspicious sun adorned, desire qualities adorned, miraculous letters lines beautiful, teacher's teaching reflection complete, Lda-ldi lotus eyes beautiful. This is maṇḍala-geometry, not astronomy.>

[651-665] <taming-thal-field>
<Taming Thal field (*'dul ba'i thal ba*)—west-north interval's top, six world-systems, offering complete with goddesses, light-filled and sandalwood smell, teacher's teaching portion-equal, sixteen-year beautiful form surrounded by extremely youthful beings. This emphasizes *mnyam pa* (equality) as recognition-quality—pure land where all teachings are equally accessible.>

[666-682] <remaining-thal-fields>
<Dung-ldan Thal deity—below nine worlds, faith-protecting smell intoxicated, turbulent extremely blazing light, teacher and teaching and retinue and enjoyment complete. Star Thal field—six worlds, wheel-stacked nature, five and nine completely stacked, dawn water-spouts adorned, thunder sound lightning red tongues emit, teacher's teaching scripture surrounded, light-arising garland nāga lineage, all directions and intervals illuminating. This completes thirteen-field enumeration (*zhing khams rnam pa bcu gsum*)—symbolic completeness (13 = 12 + 1, or 10 + 3) representing all-pervading recognition.>

<interpenetration-summary>
[INEXHAUSTIBLE DISPLAY]

<"Twenty-five stacked like arranged stars... countless fields in all directions upper-lower pervading"—encapsulates *sdong po bkod pa* (interpenetration) where each contains whole. Not physical microcosm but *chos nyid* (dharmatā) as non-localizable. The stacked lotus (*padma brtsegs ma*) with twenty-five levels is recognition-topology—each level complete, all levels simultaneous.>

[684-756] <sahā-world-cosmology>
<From immeasurable fields, explaining Sahā world's sequence: external elements from wind, connected to space-khams, water upon that, earth above—extent breadth thick equal, countless four and hundred-thousand one, one is that's four portion empty. Continents, Meru, wish-fulfilling tree, jewel, sun-moon gods individually, great ocean surrounded by method, mountain ranges, water ranges, seven jewels definitely surrounded. Internal: formless first, form-khams luminosity, distance in desire-khams too, moon stainless and sun greatly-illuminating, world-systems expanded. Paranirmitavaśavartin etc. upper sequence, then asuras' abodes, four continents' humans sequence, kleśas with self, lower realms abodes sequence arisen.>

[712-756] <muktīkā-citation>
<Citation from *Muktīkā-phreng-ba'i-rgyud* (Pearl Garland Tantra): Sky wind supports, water by 110,000 hundred-thousands, round coiled arisen like milk-cream, earth 120 hundred-thousands. Wind's number hundred-thousand—gathering, contracting, pulling, lifting. Water's pervading, holding, ripening. Earth's rubbing subtle and coarse. Churned down became like—among mountains, mountain king Meru with four terraces, great peaks, play-lakes, seven mountains, continents and surroundings arisen, three-thousand world-systems. Desire, form, formless support three realms. Non-existing anything without and consciousness slight without's formless realm arisen from that. Pure abodes etc. embodied, upper from below drops manner, Akanistha etc. desire, gods and asuras and humans, high from that three abodes, animals, pretas, hells, those beings four births.>

[743-756] <cosmic-degeneration>
<Fortunate eon first humans—form and beauty marks-characteristics possessing, own-light radiance pervading body, desire-food etc. merit food, beings' life 80,000, male and female faculties without. Then from delusion's two causes, desire etc. kleśas gradually coarse became, faculties etc. gates that, merit exhausted reason light etc. decrease. Then sequence earth oil and rice etc. food eat. This describes Buddhist *kalpa* cosmology—progressive degeneration of lifespan and conditions from golden age to present. Not historical geology but recognition-context: understanding samsara's nature as impermanent (*mi rtag pa*) and unsatisfactory (*sdug bsngal*).>

[RISK ASSESSMENT SUMMARY]
<Pages 1-20 establish foundational *gzhi* (ground), *lam* (path), and *'bras bu* (result) topology of Dzogchen view. Primary risks: (1) Reifying Samantabhadra/Vajradhara as temporal beings who achieved enlightenment; (2) Literalizing pure land descriptions as physical cosmography; (3) Treating twelve emanations as historical biography; (4) Misreading five perfections/three kāyas as ontological categories rather than recognition-descriptors; (5) Confusing emanation doctrine with theistic creation theology. Antidote: All descriptions point to *rig pa* (awareness) recognizing itself—*rang snang* (self-appearance) as *chos nyid* (dharmatā).>

[757-760] <rigpa-side>
<Longchenpa establishes the hermeneutical triad distinguishing common (*thun mong*) sūtra-treatise sources, uncommon (*thun mong ma yin pa*) tantra-section measurements, and the unsurpassed vehicle (*bla na med pa'i theg pa*) Vajra-peak (*rdo rje rtse mo*) perspective. This is doxographical positioning, not hierarchical superiority claim—asserting that Dzogchen view recognizes the single nature (*ngo bo gcig*) of all presentations while other vehicles remain at the level of conceptual designation (*rtog pa'i btags pa*).>

[761-765] <sems-side>
<The *Ati-bkod-pa-chen-po* citation from the *sGra-thal-'gyur* cycle anchors cosmology in Dzogchen scriptural authority. The twenty-five stacked three-thousand-world-systems (*stong gsum nyi shu rtsa lnga brtsegs ma*) positioned at the thirteenth level—mathematical center of the array—functions as *sems*-side preparatory framework. The "basis and essence flower-ornamented field" (*gzhi dang snying po me tog gis brgyan pa'i zhing khams*) terminology encodes recognition-topology within visionary cosmology.>

[766-776] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<The four-stage aeon cycle (*bskal pa bzhi*)—arising, abiding, destruction, emptying—derives from Vasubandhu's *Kośa* and operates within causal vehicle temporal framework. The container-contained sequence (*snod bcud kyi rim pa*) with twenty intermediate aeons (*bar gyi bskal pa nyi shu*) presents conventional cosmogony. Risk: Misreading this sequential genesis as literal temporal process rather than recognition-context establishing dependent origination (*rten 'brel*) patterns.>

[777-780] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
<The seed-syllable cosmogony—triangular E (*e gru gsum*) as ground-supporting space and A-UṂ (*a 'um*) as activating wind—employs tantric sonic-energetic framework. The "completely mind-joy" (*rnam par yid dang ba*) space with white-white light quality represents *thig le* topology within visionary generation. Risk: Reifying seed-syllables as causal agents rather than spontaneous display (*lhun grub*) of primordial awareness.>

[781-792] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<The sevenfold wind evolution (*rlung bdun gyi 'byung tshul*) with precise dimensional measurements (108,000 leagues depth, 160,000 leagues width) follows Abhidharmic cosmological model. The vajra-cross (*rdo rje rgya gram*) formation with YAM seed-syllable and four wind-goddesses operates within conventional *cakravāla* framework. Risk: Literalizing cosmic measurements as physical astronomy rather than recognition-mandala architecture.>

[793-806] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<The elemental condensation sequence—golden clouds (*gser gyi snying po can gyi sprin*) → seven-year rain → clear motionless water (*dangs shing mi g.yo rnyog pa med pa'i chu*) → golden earth formation—presents standard Buddhist cosmogony from *Aggañña Sutta* sources. The intermediate aeon (*bar gyi bskal pa*) intervals establish conventional temporal framework for world-system cycling.>

[807-820] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<The separating-wind (*'byed par byed pa'i rlung*) cosmogony with turquoise-colored interstitial space (*gseng byed sa'i nam mkha'*) and four earth-goddesses holding golden vases operates within elemental-transformation framework. The stupa-terrace (*mchod rten gyi bang rim*) analogy for layered element accumulation presents conventional cosmological pedagogy. Risk: Treating elements as substantial entities rather than dependently-originated appearances.>

[821-840] <sems-side>
<The citation from *rDo rje rtse mo 'jig rten bkod pa* establishes Dzogchen scriptural grounding for cosmological presentation. The fivefold elemental action teaching—water ripening, fire clarifying, wind atomizing, space opening, earth stabilizing—transposes external cosmogony into internal recognition framework. This sems-side instruction prepares for definitive view while remaining within conventional elemental language.>

[841-860] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<The world-system container architecture—seven gold mountains (*gser gyi ri bdun*), four continents (*gling bzhi*), wish-fulfilling tree (*dpag bsam gyi shing*), sun-moon orbits—follows classical *Abhidharma* cosmology from Vasubandhu's *Kośa*. The precise measurements (50 leagues for Dharma conch, 8,000 leagues between realms) operate within conventional descriptive framework. Risk: Confusing symbolic cosmology with empirical geography.>

[861-880] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
<The three realms (*khams gsum*) architecture with formless absorptions (*snyoms 'jug bzhi*), form realm seventeen abodes (*gnas bcu bdun*), and desire realm six heavens configures tantric visionary topology. The pure abodes (*gnas gtsang ma*) as exclusive non-returner (*phyir mi 'ong ba*) residences establish soteriological hierarchy within transformative framework.>

[881-891] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<The degenerative cosmology—80,000-year lifespan diminishing through kalpa cycles to ten-year minimum—presents standard Buddhist eschatology from *Cakkavatti Sutta* sources. The five degenerations (*snyigs ma lnga*) of lifespan, views, afflictions, beings, and eon operate within causal vehicle karmic framework. Risk: Literalizing temporal devolution as historical prediction rather than recognition of impermanence (*mi rtag pa*) patterns.>
