[11335-11342] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SIX MODES OF ARISING]
<Citation from *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen) on six modes of base arising. Lines 11336-11338: "that all essence primordially-pure actual-state called, India also not-cut direction where-also not-fall, that below spontaneous-presence jewel casket called exist"—all that called primordially pure actual-state essence; not cut off from India, not falling anywhere; below that exists called spontaneous presence jewel casket. Lines 11339-11346: "that at arise-manner form six exist, gate form two exist, that base spontaneous-presence called, base not-certain called, base various arise called also, that below reverse ground exist, that below base appearance great called exist, that below enjoyment-body appearance exist thus spoke"—at that, arise-manner forms six exist; gate forms two exist; called base spontaneous presence; called base not-certain; called base various arising; below that exists reverse ground; below that exists called great base appearance; below that exists enjoyment-body appearance, thus spoke. **Six modes of base:**
1. Spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*)—jewel casket
2. Not-certain (*ma nges*)—gate form
3. Various arising (*sna tshogs snang*) 
4. Reverse ground (*ldog gzhi*)
5. Great appearance (*snang ba chen po*)
6. Enjoyment-body appearance (*longs sku'i snang ba*)

These are not different bases but one base appearing six ways.>

- Essence (*ngo bo*) → Body (*sku*)
- Nature (*rang bzhin*) → Speech (*gsung*)
- Compassion (*thugs rje*) → Mind (*thugs*)

This correlates with subtle body: four life-winds (*srog rlung*), five wisdom winds (*ye shes rlung*), five lights (*'od lnga*). Not-knowing self-face (*rang ngo ma shes*) is ignorance (*ma rig pa*) depending on awareness (*rig pa*)—the basis of samsara.>

[11365-11369] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE DOORS OF APPEARING]
<Three doors of appearing (*snang sgo gsum*) from spontaneous presence. Line 11365: "extreme free like appearing's door not-ceased by-means-of spontaneous self-face-in clear"—*mtha' grol ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas lhun grub rang ngo na gsal ba*—door of appearing like extreme freedom, not ceased, spontaneously clear in own-face. This is *lhun grub*—spontaneous presence without obstruction. Line 11366: "pure primordial-wisdom's door like appearing's door not-ceased by-means-of entity primordially-pure's appearance sky cloud not-like appearance above see"—pure primordial wisdom door appearing: entity primordially pure appearance like cloudless sky seen above. This is *ka dag*—primordial purity as unobscured clarity. Line 11367-11369: "impure samsara's door like appearing's door not-ceased by-means-of below six-classes's appearance-portion appearance, samsara lower-realms play-to primordially-arise, said manner"—impure samsara door appearing: below, six classes' appearance portion; samsara lower realms play primordially arising. Three doors: (1) extreme free spontaneous clear, (2) pure primordial wisdom, (3) impure samsara. All "not ceased" (*ma 'gags*)—basis accommodates all appearances without obstruction.>

[11370-11372] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THREE KAYA MANIFESTATION]
<Three capacities (*rtsal*) of ground-appearance manifesting as three kayas. Line 11370: "thus spontaneous's appearance's capacity from primordial-wisdom five's field-in enjoyment-body's appearance measure not also directly self-clear"—spontaneous appearance's capacity: from five primordial wisdoms' field, enjoyment body's appearance measureless, directly self-clear. *Saṃbhogakāya* (*longs sku*) from five wisdoms' capacity. Line 11371: "quality's capacity from direction-corner-in nature emanation body's field appearance also infer-to not self-arise"—quality's capacity: from direction-corner, nature emanation body's field appearance, not inferred, self-arisen. *Nirmāṇakāya* (*sprul sku*) from qualities' capacity in all directions. Line 11372: "compassion's capacity from below sentient-being-to appearance also measure not self-to appear"—compassion's capacity: from below to sentient beings, appearance measureless, self-appearing. This is the dynamic of *thugs rje*—compassion as appearance capacity. All three kayas are not created but spontaneously manifest from ground's capacities.>

Ground-appearance (*gzhi snang*) is self-appearing (*rang snang*)—not objective, not shared. Like dream: vivid yet private, momentary yet unreal. Lines 11377-11391: Hierarchical structure: "that also primordially-pure's below spontaneous's appearance, that-of below light-clear five's thig-le and ray-radiance-to appearance ground early great exist, that-of below enjoyment-body's appearance, that-of below nature emanation-body's appearance exist, that-of below six-modes's appearance"—beneath primordial purity: spontaneous appearance; beneath that: five light-clear thigles and ray-radiance appearance, ground early great; beneath that: enjoyment-body appearance; beneath that: nature emanation-body appearance; six-modes appearance. Emanation bodies: "that tame beings-tame emanation-body muni six and, impure emanation body birth aging death tame-by-means-of field appearance exist"—taming beings: six muni emanation bodies; impure emanation body: birth-aging-death taming field appearance. Spontaneous arising-way eight: "that spontaneous arising-way eight that arise's ground, being's bag filling like, that-by-means-of ga'u-of sound expressed, that also bkra-shis mdzes-ldan great's tantra from, alas fatigue confusion not also I-of capacity-from confusion arisen, ground not-change from, nature not-cease arise-from, compassion-by-means-of not-determinate from non-awareness self-arise"—eight spontaneous arising ways; ground like being's bag filling; expressed by ga'u sound; from Bkra shis mdzes ldan great tantra; confusion arisen from capacity, not fatigue; from ground not changing, nature not ceasing to arise, compassion indeterminate, non-awareness self-arisen. This is *gzhi snang* topology: layered manifestation from subtle (primordial purity) to coarse (emanation bodies).>

Similarly: samsara (*non-recognition*) is adventitious to basis (*spontaneous accomplishment state*). Basis, path, awareness do not truly exist (*bden par med*)—they are like clouds. Yet they appear (*snang*). This is *snang stong gnyis med*—appearance and emptiness non-dual. Not-determined (*ma nges*) appearance great dwelling as one: basis accommodates all without determining any.>

[11397-11421] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – EIGHT ASPECTS OF SPONTANEOUS ACCOMPLISHMENT]
<Lines 11397-11421: Eight aspects of spontaneous accomplishment state (*lhun grub kyi gnas lugs*):

1. "jewel casket-of state called, desire-objects-of door not cease"—jewel casket state, desire objects' door not ceasing
2. "not establish-of establish great-as dwell"—non-established establishment great dwelling
3. "compassion like arise-of door not cease"—compassion-like arising door not ceasing  
4. "primordial-wisdom like arise-of enjoyment not cease"—primordial wisdom-like arising enjoyment not ceasing

8. "pure primordial-wisdom-of gate thorough reach"—pure primordial wisdom gate thoroughly reached

Plus: "impure like arise-of compassion not cease"—impure like arising compassion not ceasing. These are eight doors (*sgo brgyad*) of spontaneous arising—clearing obstacles to understanding *lhun grub*. Lines 11408-11421: "desire-objects-of jewel jewel like, that-like my form-to attach, inner youth vase form called extent open, outer spontaneous-accomplishment-of state-as dwell, time that only my appearance outer spread, clear not clear not, shattered not shattered not, scattered not scattered not, distracted not distracted not, move, flicker, variety-as spread happen, then spontaneous-accomplishment-of state great attach"—desire objects like jewel; my form attached like that; inner youth vase form called extent open; outer spontaneous accomplishment state dwelling; time that only my appearance spreading outer; clear/not clear not; shattered/not shattered not; scattered/not scattered not; distracted/not distracted not; move, flicker, variety spreading happening; then great spontaneous accomplishment state attached. Paradoxical formulations: neither clear nor not clear, etc.—transcending dichotomies. This is *phyal ba* (wide open)—unobstructed spontaneity.>

Lines 11682-11710: Citation from *gSang ba snying po* (Secret Essence): "Tame and tame-maker as relate is, Secret-Essence from, Great-compassion-by-means-of relate-by-means-of, Six-realms time abide not-remain appear, Thus"—tame and tame-maker relate; from Secret Essence; by means of great compassion relating; six realms appear not abiding remaining in time. Quality proofs establishing spontaneous presence:

1. Elements five individually clear (*'byung ba lnga so so gsal*)—if non-existent, purpose non-existent
2. Awareness inside not cut off—if elements non-existent
3. Container-contents appearance non-arising—if elements non-existent
4. Light-like appearance existing—that quality
5. Two non-existent, three doors cannot relate to one
6. Beings' body/speech/mind three; Buddha's three bodies: gathering-separating non-existent quality
7. Body-like appearance non-existent: body appearance purpose non-existent; beings' body and conqueror's body existing—that quality
8. Primordial wisdom-like appearance non-existent: defect of samsara transcendence path primordial wisdom appearance non-existent existing

These are *sgrub byed* (proofs) establishing *lhun grub* through absurd consequences of its non-existence. Lines 11697-11710: "Extreme liberate like appear exist-by-means-of Buddha from back not-return arise, That non-existent if non-arise-for also that-of quality, Impure door like appear primordial-arise spontaneous in non-existent if, Beings samsara-in appear awareness-face this-to come purpose non-existent if, That exist-by-means-of six-realms individually-of appear-as arise also that-of quality, Power completely great from, Samsara bad-realms play-in primordial-arise, Thus, Pure primordial-wisdom-of door non-existent if nirvana-of appear come purpose non-existent in, That exist-by-means-of awareness-face-in Buddha-of appear exist that exist-of quality, That also spontaneous in pure impure appear suitable see-of door exist window like exist although, Base in pure impure exist is not, Thus spontaneous-of appear-method eight in quality-of aspect eight count is suitable is, Gem-Treasury from"—Buddha arising not returning back by means of extreme liberate appearance existing; if that non-existent, also that quality of non-arising; if primordial-arise spontaneous in impure door appearance non-existent; if purpose non-existent of coming to awareness-face in beings' samsara appearance; that exist by means of six realms individually appearing as arising—that quality; from completely great power; primordial-arise in samsara bad-realms play; thus; if pure primordial wisdom door non-existent, in non-existent purpose of nirvana appearance coming; that exist by means of awareness-face Buddha appearance existing—that exist quality; although window-like exist, door suitable for seeing pure impure in spontaneous; pure impure not existing in base; thus in eight spontaneous appear-methods, suitable to count eight quality aspects; from Gem Treasury. **Key insight**: spontaneous presence is proven by necessity—without it, nothing could appear or function. Yet base itself neither pure nor impure.>

1. **Elements** ('byung ba): earth, water, fire, wind, space → great elements
2. **Realms** ('jig rten): gods, demigods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts, hells
3. **Afflictions** (nyon mongs): desire, anger, delusion, pride, jealousy
4. **Miraculous arise** (rdzus skyes): from ignorance, mind, aggregates, elements, sense bases, consciousness, faculties
5. **Sense objects** (yul): sound, smell, taste, touch, desirable objects
6. **Action continuum** (las rgyun): karma continuation

All arise dependently—no independent self-nature. This is *rten 'brel* teaching, not Dzogchen view of spontaneous presence.>

1. Wish-fulfilling tree (blessing from Buddha)
2. Egg birth (heat + moisture)
3. Mind birth (wisdom agitation)

1. Cause condition (*rgyu rkyen*): ignorance
2. Object condition (*dmigs rkyen*): delusion object
3. Master condition (*bdag rkyen*): grasping "I" on tree
4. Immediate condition (*de ma thag rkyen*): equal

Consciousness grasps coarsely → afflictions arise.>
