[751-756] <dharmakāya-as-self-abiding-greatness>
Longchenpa defines dharmakāya as "nature spontaneous presence luminosity body self-abiding greatness" (*rang bzhin lhun grub 'od gsal gyi sku rang gnas chen po*). Citation establishes dharmakāya's definitive term (*nges tshig*): unchanging, empty, clear, all deeds complete. Epistemic precision: The compound strings essence (*rang bzhin*), nature (*lhun grub*), and compassion (*'od gsal*) into dharmakāya's definition. "Self-abiding" (*rang gnas*) prevents any movement toward or away—dharmakāya neither comes from elsewhere nor goes elsewhere. It is not "in" the practitioner to be discovered. Risk: Substantialization—reading "unchanging empty clear" as attributes of a metaphysical entity rather than the non-attribute of ground.

[757-762] <own-body-as-beyond-elaboration>
Own-body (*rang lus*) is free from all elaboration extremes—nothing established anywhere. Citation: "No outer no inner no expanse—this is dharmakāya's own-body." Epistemic precision: The negation pattern "no X no Y no Z" operates at apophatic extreme. This is not merely Madhyamaka's absence of svabhāva but Dzogchen's positive assertion of ground-beyond-negation. Risk: View collapse—reading this as standard Madhyamaka emptiness, missing that Dzogchen's "no expanse" (*dbyings su med*) refers to freedom even from dharmadhātu as reified category.

[763-775] <similes-as-pedagogical-indication>
Similes: awareness-luminosity like sun, depth like ocean, unstained by faults like lotus, unchanging like mountain, vast without center-edge like space, possessing all-vanquishing confidence and primordial lion. Citation: "Sun ocean lotus mountain space lion—these are dharmakāya's similes." Epistemic function: Similes indicate without defining. Sun indicates luminous self-illumination; ocean indicates unfathomable depth; lotus indicates purity-within-samsara; mountain indicates unmoving stability; space indicates unobstructed pervasion; lion indicates fearless confidence. Risk: Simile reification—treating sun/ocean/lotus as literally present in dharmakāya rather than as pedagogical pointing devices.

[807-823] <rigpa-side>
<Masterful analysis:
The seven aspects of Dharmakaya fruition—spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) as great primordial liberation (*ye grol chen po*), primordially established (*ye grub*) activity completing all meanings, qualities abiding in oneself without seeking—are not achievements but recognition-descriptions. The verse citation presents the non-action of Dharmakaya: conduct without ceasing, fixation, or attachment; meditation spontaneous, immediate, without wavering; view complete without seeing or having-seen; fruition without fabrication, arising, or production; activity without cultivation, yet cultivation complete; qualities arising as one, two, all. Each line denies conventional action (*byed pa*) while asserting completion (*rdzogs*). This is Dzogchen's paradox: nothing to do, yet everything complete; no practice, yet recognition perfect. The Wylie phrases *byas med, byung med, 'byung ba med* (without fabrication, without arising, without production) negate *samskrta* (conditioned) categories, while *bsgrubs zin* (already established) points to *nisprapanca* (unelaborated) nature. The practitioner does not "accomplish" these—recognition reveals they were never absent.>

[824-865] [STRUCTURAL TRANSITION]
<Masterful analysis:
The structural marker *gnyis pa* (second) transitions from Dharmakaya to Sambhogakaya (*longs sku*), from emptiness-form to enjoyment-form. The fivefold analysis—essence (*ngo bo*), definitive terminology (*nges tshig*), characteristic (*mtshan nyid*), mode of appearance (*snang lugs*), mode of abiding (*gnas lugs*)—replicates scholastic methodology while preparing for Dzogchen transformation. The *Rang Shar* citation describes Sambhogakaya essence: birth existing yet possessing deathless vajra; five lights, bodies unobscured, individually clear; possessing five fathers, five objects, five aggregates; five innate aspects, five wisdoms, five realizations; five bases, five paths, five fruitions. This operates as *upāya*: the apparent multiplicity of Sambhogakaya's qualities serves as recognition-support for practitioners who cognize through differentiation. The Dzogchen integration recognizes that these "fives" are not categories to accumulate but simultaneous dimensions of single awareness-display. The transition from Dharmakaya's non-action to Sambhogakaya's apparent multiplicity marks pedagogical progression: from the simplicity of emptiness to the richness of spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*).>

[934-943] <sambhogakāya-as-unified-display>
Longchenpa establishes Sambhogakāya (*longs sku*) through five aspects unified: some sphere (*yul*), some method (*thabs*), some appearance (*snang ba*), some prajna (*shes rab*)—thus explained as unified Enjoyment Body. Definitive term: perfecting virtues (*yon tan du longs pa*), dwelling in luminosity-purity (*'od gsal dag pa la spyod pa*), both purposes spontaneously complete (*don gnyis lhun gyis rdzogs pa*), wisdom reaching full measure (*ye shes tshad du phyin pa*), mark-simile light-ray appearing body (*mtshan dpe 'od zer snang ba'i sku*). Five "longs" (*longs*) make "complete enjoyment" (*longs spyod rdzogs pa*).

Epistemic precision: The five aspects are not components but simultaneous descriptions. "Sphere" indicates object-pole; "method" indicates subject-pole; "appearance" indicates display; "prajna" indicates recognition; "light-ray body" indicates form. The unification prevents trinitarian reading (three separate kayas) by showing Sambhogakāya as dharmakāya's self-recognition. Risk: Trinitarianism—treating Sambhogakāya as ontologically distinct from Dharmakāya rather than wisdom-display aspect.

[944-958] <five-perfects-as-sambhogakāyas-definition>
Citation from spontaneous presence: "Dharmatā emptiness's mode dwells—perfect; clear unmixed all-pervading—perfect; five wisdoms unseparated dwelling—perfect; all-unequaled individual marks possessed—perfect; method-prajna unseparated dwelling—perfect." Five appearances markless dwelling—enjoyment; without grasping self-clear all-enjoying—enjoyment; completely clear equal-dwelling—enjoyment; naturally naturally dwelling in sphere emanating—enjoyment; two kayas intended ultimate enjoyment—enjoyment.

Epistemic precision: The repetition of "perfect" (*longs*) and "enjoyment" (*spyod*) establishes Sambhogakāya not as location but as activity—dwelling, pervading, enjoying. The "five appearances markless" indicates that form-display is empty-form, not substantial form. Risk: Substantialization—reading "light-ray body" as physically luminous entity rather than wisdom-radiance without material substrate.

[979-985] <sambhogakāyas-five-family-display>
Longchenpa presents five families' (*rigs lnga*) individual mandalas as non-mixed, clear resonance. From Self-Arisen: marks and signs, radiant light rays, father-mother-body's characteristics held, Sambhogakāya body's marks.

[CONTEXT] NYINGMA-SARMA POLEMICS: The five-family (*rigs lnga*) mandala structure distinguishes Nyingma presentation from Sarma (*gsar ma*) tantric systems. While Gelug (*dge lugs*) and Sakya (*sa skya*) emphasize the five Buddha-families as purified aggregates (*phung po lnga*) following *Guhyasamāja* (*gsang 'dus*) exegesis, Longchenpa's *snying thig* tradition treats the five families as spontaneous display (*rang shar*) of awareness without transformation (*sgyur med*). This reflects the fundamental Nyingma distinction between causal (*rgyu*) and result (*'bras bu*) vehicles—the five families are not achieved through purification but recognized as always-already present. The "father-mother-body" (*yab yum gyi sku*) refers to method-wisdom (*thabs shes*) inseparability, distinct from lower tantra's gradual generation-stage (*bskyed rim*) visualization.

Epistemic precision: This is not cosmological geography but direct pointing to awareness-display. Risk: Reification—reading five-family mandalas as metaphysical locations rather than wisdom-aspect recognition.

[986-998] <three-modes-of-sambhogakāya>
Appearance-mode (*snang tshul*): from one nature rigpa, Dharmakāya body sends light-body to ten directions benefiting. Rigpa body unmoving from dharmadhātu, without change or transformation, self-appearance clear light field—two perfections inside-outside. Citation: "One nature two essences, Sambhogakāya's appearance."

[CONTEXT] DOXOGRAPHICAL DISTINCTION: The three-mode (*tshul gsum*) presentation—appearance, abiding, and emanation—derives from *snying thig* tantras, particularly *Rig pa rang shar* and *Sgra thal 'gyur*. This structure contrasts with standard Yogācāra three-kāya theory by asserting Sambhogakāya as Dharmakāya's self-recognition (*rang ngo shes*) rather than intermediate state between empty Dharmakāya and form Nirmāṇakāya. Longchenpa here follows the *man ngag sde* (Instruction Class) view that Sambhogakāya is immediate (*cig car*) display, not developmental (*rim gyis*) achievement.

Abiding-mode (*gnas tshul*): acceptance-rejection free dharmadhātu, non-dual space, five lights' perfected expanse, emanation's flowing great ring. Risks: Temporalization (appearance as process); Nihilism (non-dual as mere absence rather than clarity-emptiness inseparable).
