[578-585] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SECOND CHAPTER OPENING]
<Transition to second major section: explaining definite abode (*gnas nges pa*) where teacher tames. First sub-topic: fields (*zhing khams*) and container-contained (*snod bcud*) sequence. Cosmology: from Vajradhara quality-complete bodhi (*yon tan rdzogs pa'i rang bzhin*), abiding as Saṃbhogakāya from Dharmakāya, five-family kāya manifests immeasurable fields. Center ornamented by Vairocana (*dbus ma rnam par snang mdzad kyis brgyan pa*). Sahā world (*mi mjed 'di*) at thirteenth level of twenty-five stacked appearances upon jewel lotus. "Upper-lower and directions-intervals" (*steng 'og dang phyogs mtshams*) indicates three-dimensional maṇḍala architecture—not physical cosmography but recognition-topology.>

[586-634] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – THALGYUR QUOTATION]
<Extensive quotation from *sGra thal 'gyur* (Sound Unobstructed/Thalgyur) tantra describing thirteen field-types (*zhing khams rnam pa bcu gsum*) arrayed around Sahā: (1) Thal-ba-dbyangs—below this world, immeasurable; (2) Thal-ba-'dzin—six worlds below, wheel-shaped; (3) Thal-ba-skyob—three to right, ornamented by mothers/nurses; (4) Thal-ba-brdal—six worlds above, lotus-blooming; (5) Thal-ba'i be-con—above nineteen worlds, skull-garland; (6) Thal-ba'i rgyun—northeast interval, caitya-shaped; (7) Thal-ba rgyas—at top twenty-one, extremely pervading. "Thal" (*thal*) relates to *thal 'gyur*—unobstructed, penetrating, direct. Each field: name, location relative to Sahā, shape, teaching function.>
