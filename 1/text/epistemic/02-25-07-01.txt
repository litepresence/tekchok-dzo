[17008-17019] <meaning-without-words>
<Meaning actually not aspect appearance, tamed's merit and Buddha's blessings gathering from sound also syllables self-characteristic not. From Tantra Supreme Continuation: "Victorious ones' speech that, echo like letters not. As echo's sound, other's consciousness from arose, concept not and made not, thus Tathagata's speech, other's consciousness from arose, concept not and remember not." The Buddha's speech is not linguistic communication. Risk of linguistic literalism: treating these as descriptions of actual speech rather than pointing to transmission beyond words.>

[17052-17063] <qualities-three-modes>
<End guide emanation body beings guide finally dharmakaya make. From that itself: "Qualities essence all produce, qualities definitive term various accomplish, division aspect three shown: ground abiding qualities, path appearing qualities, end guiding qualities." Fifth activity also: essence, definitive term. The three modes of qualities describe abiding nature, not sequential development. Risk of developmental stages: reading these as progressive levels rather than simultaneous aspects of one ground.>

[17096-17107] <four-activity-types>
<Body speech mind qualities activity inexhaustible ornament wheel field completely perfected great extensively done. Thus also from Lion Perfected Great Perfection Tantra: "Activity essence accomplish, activity definitive term deed do, division aspect four shown: E-maho! Pacifying and enriching, likewise empowering and wrathful explained. Pacifying dharmata dharmadhatu gathers, enriching various essence shows, empowering unripened ripened makes." The four activities are spontaneous manifestations, not intentional interventions. Risk of functionalism: treating these as techniques applied by a Buddha rather than ground's natural display.>

[17227-17238] <dedication-prayer>
<Good explanation great cloud hearing lightning garland possessing, mind sky path word meaning nectar rain fell, all beings nine hopes fulfill virtue assembly harvests increase, victorious one's abundance beings all satisfy existence peace degeneration dispel. Directions all's source and, beings as long as abide, dharma treasure this abide, limitless benefit happiness accomplish. World all and beings all, happy and abundant god realm like, all liberation path abide, together Buddha accomplish. This is dedicatory prayer, upāya for gathering merit, not ontological assertion. Risk of devotionalism: reading this as literal prayer to external power rather than spontaneous expression of recognition.>

[17263-17274] <colophon-verse>
<As night clearing sky, rabbit-holder rays also light spreads, star cluster center mandala filling, flower Kunda gardens expand like. Intelligence sky essence's light hundred, various wisdom clear radiance spreads, vajra essence path good illuminates, fortune intellect's lotus expand does. Method this Supreme Vehicle essence's lotus garden from, various self-liberated yogis, clear light essence's meaning showed. Stainless light rays thousand possessing thus said. This colophon verse is poetic closure, not doctrinal statement. Risk of poetic idealization: taking metaphors as literal descriptions rather than appreciative expression.>

[17307-17318] <final-dedication>
<Very clear intelligence stainless possessing noble path's follower, much heard qualities very vast life one enlightenment desire to, unsurpassed vehicle's gate this near abode treasure this benefit accomplish. Nagas supreme's jewel glory like faith hundred's crown ornament become. Good speech qualities stainless possessing unsurpassed vehicle's peak glory, victorious one's secret treasure very wonder world all difficult arise jewel treasure, fortune possessing appearance become this udumvara flower like wonder, whoever this heard held become existence end's bodhisattva famous great. Dharma white appearance very vast auspicious sun moon's mandala good adorned, directions times victorious one's supreme secret peak auspicious limitless light rays sky equal, victorious source doer very limitless auspicious spread hopes all fulfill, glorious auspicious day maker's auspicious stack times all auspicious. Final dedication concluding the text. Risk of exclusivism: claiming this vehicle as superior rather than recognizing all vehicles as skillful means.>
