<Nature (*rang bzhin*) free of conceptual grasping (*rnam rtog gzung zad pa*), characteristics (*mtshan nyid*) free of dualistic identification (*gnyis med ngos gzung dang bral ba*)—this describes *klong* (space/expanse) as unobstructed openness. The two divisions into words for the distracted (*glen pa yengs la bor ba'i kha gtam*) and words when circumstances strike (*khar phog dus med pa'i kha gtam*) represent pedagogical responsiveness (*'dul bya'i dbang gis*), not doctrinal positions. The phrase *chos nyid khungs nas gdon pa* (extracting dharmatā from source) is pointing-out instruction, not philosophical extraction.>

<The essential points (*gnad*) of channels/winds (*rtsa rlung*)—root essential-point wind abiding, body-essential-point wind, distraction-essential-point self-liberation—are *lam* (path) instructions within *klong sde* framework. The phrase *rang sems brtson du zin pa'i man ngag* (instruction of mind seized by diligence) indicates these are methods for those needing progressive approach. The vast expanse (*dbyings rgya che ba*) perspective as *gang yang ma shong ba med* (nothing not accommodated) is *chos dbyings* (dharmadhātu) inclusivity, not philosophical omniscience.>

<The *rgyud rang gzhung gi man ngag* (tantra self-text instruction) as source of all teachings (*bka' thams cad kyi byung khungs*) establishes Nyingma textual authority. The phrase *chos nyid yid dpyod du gdeng 'tshar ba* (dharmatā intellectually determined) contrasts lower vehicles with this text's direct perception (*mngon sum*). The self-liberation of appearance-conditions (*snang rkyen rang grol*) means conditions are not obstacles to recognition but its very display—this is definitive Dzogchen view.>

[3915-3926] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<Essence (*ngo bo*) without phenomena (*chos med pa*) therefore Buddha-name also non-existent—this undermines even the reification of enlightenment. Nature (*rang bzhin*) as power-display appearing (*rtsal du shar ba*) shows samsara/nirvana as view-appearance. Characteristics without singular certainty (*gcig tu ma nges pa*) means view-meditation (*lta sgom*) is measureless (*tshad med*). The second division: essence as birthless thoroughly pure therefore afflictions self-liberated, nature as unceasing universally appearing therefore acceptance/rejection non-existent.>

[3927-3949] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
<The *gtar ka gegs bsal* (obstacle removal) category uses progressive metaphors for view-meditation-conduct stability. View's heat (*lta ba'i drod*) when moving is like recognizing the thief as the householder recognizes thieves; when obtained, like fire burning wood; when stable, like the army victorious in battle. These are *lam* (path) descriptions for those needing gradual confidence-building, not the recognition itself. The metaphors progressively undermine their own necessity until conduct (*spyod pa*) liberates appearances.>

---

[3950-3955] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<Nature without cause-fruition therefore no self-determination to go elsewhere; characteristics without need for habituation therefore knowing not dependent on other. The phrase *chos nyid gyi gegs bsal bas* (obstacle removed by dharmatā) means obstacles were never other than recognition—*bstan du med pa* (indemonstrable) as essence, *phyogs med* (directionless) as nature, *brtgs na mi rnyed* (unfindable when examined) as characteristics. This is root-rotting (*rtsa rul*) of samsara/nirvana—radical undermining, not philosophical negation.>

[3956-3967] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The *gab pa mngon phyung* (hidden revealed) category presents two modalities: (1) one hidden, two revealed, and (2) two hidden, one revealed. First modality: view-conduct revealed, meditation hidden—its essence is *zung 'jug* (union) without beginning/end therefore samsara/nirvana's beginning/end severed. This is Dzogchen's *thog mtha' chod* (cutting beginning/end)—not temporal but atemporal recognition. Nature as non-differentiated two therefore *thig le* (sphere/drop) without outer/inner; characteristics without reference therefore causeless zang-thal (direct/penetrating).>

---

[3968-3976] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
<Second modality variations: conduct revealed—abiding empty, emptiness pure; view hidden—non-grasping cognition appears directionless, objectless awareness liberated in non-thought. These are pedagogical revealing (*mngon du phyung*) patterns, not ontological truths. The *bshad pa rang gsal* (explanation self-clear) category cuts word-grasping continuum (*tshig zhen rgyun chad*), not establishing philosophical positions (*grub mtha' mi gnas*) but superior establishment (*grub pa khyad par 'phags pa*). This is *man ngag gi sde* method: using explanation to undermine explanation.>

[3977-3988] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SEMS SIDE]
<The *'khrul pa* (delusion) category presents three systems: (1) delusion as basis-reversal (*gzhir zlog pa*), (2) delusion self-removed (*rang sol*) as dharmatā recognition, (3) delusion-basis pierced (*khog sgor*) as delusion-samsara continuum severed. First system's essence: delusion-root ignorance's basis established as three realms' samsara; recognizing it as self liberates ignorance-root. The phrase *rang du ded pas ma rig pa rtsad bcad* (directing to self cuts ignorance) indicates *rig pa* recognizing *ma rig pa* (non-recognition) as its own display—not destroying delusion but recognizing its nature.>

---

[3989-3993] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The three subsystems progressively: (1) delusion root cut therefore samsara/nirvana view reversed—never experienced delusion (*'khrul ma myong*) from primordial; (2) delusion self-removed therefore non-deluded dharmatā recognized—affliction basis emptied, virtue/non-virtue continuum severed; (3) delusion-basis pierced therefore delusion-samsara continuum severed—falling/basis empty, fabrication not found, basis examined. The phrase *'khrul ma 'khrul las 'das* (transcended delusion/non-delusion) indicates recognition beyond both delusion and its correction.>
