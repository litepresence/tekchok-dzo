<Masterful analysis:
The verse citation on Dharmakaya's abiding manner (*chos sku'i bzhugs pa'i tshul*)—"Whoever knows the body-point suitable to that, this makes yogis into Mahāsukha Dharmakaya"—operates as *upāya* within definitive view. The "body-point" (*lus kyi gnad*) refers not to anatomical location but to the crucial recognition of body's nature as dharmakaya. The phrase "suitable to that" (*de dang mthun par*) indicates alignment between physical posture and realization. The pedagogical function: providing somatic access to recognition for practitioners who benefit from body-based pointing. The Dzogchen view recognizes that Dharmakaya was never separate from the body—the "abiding" is not something achieved but recognized. The "yogis" (*rnal 'byor*) are those who unite (*'byor*) with reality's nature, not practitioners of technique.>

<Masterful analysis:
The three-kaya posture practice (*sku gsum gyi bzhugs stangs*) marks transition from *sems*-side methodology to definitive recognition. The three postures—sprul sku frog-posture (*tsog pu*) for future austerity-based liberation, longs sku elephant-posture (*glang po*) for future effortless natural liberation, chos sku lion-posture (*seng ge*) for future authentic fearless liberation—operate initially as *instructional provisionality*. The question arises: how does elemental body's posture become three-kaya posture? The answer reveals Dzogchen integration: three kayas abide in heart (*snying la gnas*) as self-existing clear light (*sku gsum 'od gsal rang la yod pa*)—posture practice makes manifest (*mngon du byed*) the three intentions already present. The three kayas are self-nature (*rang chas su yod pas*), so one's own posture becomes three-kaya posture. The correlations—cold elements with sprul sku requiring temperature balance, hot elements with chos sku, balanced with longs sku—are provisional correlations for practitioners whose recognition operates through elemental harmony. The crucial point: without posture control, wisdom's self-radiance in channels is not evoked; without evocation, wisdom-appearance does not dawn in external space. Posture is essential (*gces so*), not as cause but as recognition-condition.>

<Masterful analysis:
The simile of snake's limbs—present in body but not manifest unless coiled—illustrates posture's function: wisdom appears through posture's crucial point (*gnad*), just as limbs appear through coiling. The question about whether three postures are definite or can be one, two, three, hundred, thousand—points to the definitive view: the number is pedagogical, not ultimate. The Dzogchen integration recognizes that all postures are equally valid recognition-supports; the "three" is *upāya* for structured practice, while definitive recognition transcends posture entirely—available in any position, any circumstance, never dependent on specific arrangement of body.>

[4566-4577] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The threefold classification of beings according to affliction ripening operates within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The opening statement establishes the karmic structure: sentient beings (*'gro ba*) are led into three realms (*khams gsum*) by three afflictions (*nyon mongs pa gsum*), and liberation occurs through the same three doorways—body, speech, and mind (*lus ngag yid gsum*). This presents a precise karmic taxonomy: the three poisons (desire, confusion, anger) ripen as three forms (bird, pig, snake), each emphasizing one of the three doors (speech, mind, body) as predominant. The first elaboration—desire-unpurified (*'dod chags ma dag pa*) ripening into bird-form (*bya'i gzugs su byung ba*) with action and speech predominant (*bya ba dang byed pa ngag gtso che ba*), love of speaking (*smra ba la dga' ba*), focus on speech objects (*brjod bya la gtsor byed*), great desire (*'dod pa che*), and desire-joy (*'dod chags la dga' ba*)—serves diagnostic function. The Sambhogakaya posture (*longs sku'i bzhugs stangs*) is taught specifically for desire-types: when one always maintains this posture, one becomes skilled in dharmata meaning (*chos nyid kyi don la mchog tu mkhas pa*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*), meeting practitioners through their predominant karmic pattern. Risk of determinism: interpreting these correlations as fixed destinies rather than recognition-entry points. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "desire," "confusion," and "anger" are modalities of single awareness; the "postures" are not corrective therapies but pointing-devices revealing that all three poisons are wisdom-display when recognized. The phrase "certainly become buddha" (*sangs rgya bar nges*) refers to recognition, not temporal attainment.>

[4578-4584] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The second elaboration—confusion-unpurified (*gti mug ma dag pa*) ripening into pig-form (*phag tu byung ba*) with mind predominant (*'gro ba'i yid gtso che ba*), many mind-changes (*sems kyi 'gyur ba mang*), mental dullness (*blo 'gyur*), great conceptual thought (*rnam rtog che*), dislike of speech (*brjod pa la mi dga'*), and love of sleep (*gnyid la dga' ba*)—continues the diagnostic framework. The phrase "waking the sleeper" (*bag la nyal slong bar byed pa*) is significant: this affliction-type is characterized by dormant tendency (*bag la nyal*) that requires awakening. The Dharmakaya posture (*chos sku'i bzhugs stangs*) is taught specifically for confusion-types: when one always abides in this posture, one definitely abides in dharmata throughout three times (*chos nyid la dus gsum du gnas par nges so*). The phrase "three times" (*dus gsum*)—past, present, future—indicates that recognition transcends temporal becoming: it is not that one will attain something in future, but that one recognizes what has always been abiding. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners whose confusion manifests as mental dullness and conceptual proliferation. Risk of path-essence confusion: treating "abiding in dharmata" as progressive attainment rather than recognition of primordial abiding. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "confusion" is itself a display of awareness; the Dharmakaya posture is not a method to eliminate confusion but a pointing-device that reveals confusion as self-arisen wisdom.>

[4585-4590] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The third elaboration—anger-unpurified (*zhed sdang ma dag pa*) ripening into snake-form (*sbrul du smin pa*) with body-action predominant (*lus kyi byed pa gtso che ba*), love of body-action (*lus kyi bya ba la dga' ba*), wish to move (*'gro 'dod*), great body-power (*lus stobs che*), coarse body (*lus bong rags*), and love of physical adornment (*lus kyi byi dor la dga' ba*)—completes the threefold taxonomy. The snake-form is characterized by movement and physicality: the being loves to move, has great bodily power, and loves physical adornment (*byi dor*—refining/adorning the body). The Nirmanakaya posture (*sprul pa sku'i bzhugs stangs*) is taught specifically for anger-types: when one always abides in this posture, one certainly awakens (*sangs rgya bar nges so*). The phrase "certainly awakens" (*sangs rgya bar nges*) appears here without the qualification "skilled in dharmata meaning" that appeared for the desire-type. This is significant: for the anger-type, the connection to nirmanakaya (manifestation body) points directly to awakening as activity-display. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners whose anger manifests as physical restlessness and aggression. Risk of essentialism: treating "anger-types" as ontologically separate category rather than recognition-pattern description. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "anger" is a manifestation of awareness's energy (*lung*); the Nirmanakaya posture is not anger-management therapy but revelation that anger-energy is itself the display of wisdom when recognized.>

[4591-4596] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The definitive statements about posture completeness operate from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The declaration—"three postures are certain" (*bzhugs stangs gsum du nges so*)—establishes pedagogical completeness: there are exactly three postures, not more (superfluous) nor fewer (incomplete). The rationale—sentient beings' aspirations (*'gro ba'i smon so*) appearing in body, speech, and mind, and liberation occurring through the bondage of those same three—indicates that the three postures precisely correspond to the three bondage-structures. The phrase "not more" (*de las mang na mi dgos*) addresses the danger of proliferation: adding more postures would miss the precise recognition-coordinate. The phrase "not fewer" (*nyung na ma tshang bas*) addresses the danger of incompleteness: fewer postures would miss some practitioners' predominant patterns. The final line—"at this time, cutting off speech about the speech-point" (*'di'i dus ngag gi gnad smra ba bcad pa ste*)—marks the transition from karmic-structural teaching to direct introduction. The "speech-point" (*ngag gi gnad*) refers to the esoteric transmission that cannot be expressed in words; "cutting off" (*bcad pa*) indicates that the definitive teaching now goes beyond conceptual elaboration. Risk of categorization: treating the three postures as rigid categories rather than skillful-means (*upāya*) that point beyond all categories. The Dzogchen view recognizes that body, speech, and mind are never truly separate; the three postures are recognition-facilitating devices, not ontological divisions. The "cutting off of speech" marks the definitive recognition: awareness is beyond all descriptions, including the threefold classification itself.>

[4597-4600] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The *Thal 'Gyur* (Penetration of Sound) citation on speech training (*ngag bslab pa*)—"Speech is trained (*ngag ni bslab*), abides (*gnas pa*), and la bzla is stabilized (*la bzla brtan par bya*)"—presents graduated *upāya* for practitioners whose predominant pattern is speech/desire (bird-type). The four phases constitute a precise pedagogical progression: (1) Training (*bslab pa*): first reduce speaking, cutting ordinary conversation (*tha mal gyi gtam smra ba bcad pa*), beginning with short sessions (*thun chung ngu*) then extending to longer periods (*de nas ring du bslab*); even when no occasion for speaking, speak only one word (*skabs su smra rgyu med kyang gcig pu smra'o*). (2) Abiding (*gnas pa*): do not reject mantras and virtuous speech (*sngags dang brjod pa la sogs pa dge ba'i brjod pa mi dgag*), yet do not mix even a single syllable with others (*gzhan dang tshig 'bru gcig kyang mi 'dre'o*). (3) Recitation (*la bzla*): all mantra-recitation and expressions cease (*sngags la sogs pa brjod pa thams cad mi bya*). (4) Stabilization (*brtan pa*): without speaking anything, not departing from that state (*ci yang mi brjod pa'i ngang las mi 'da' bar byed pa*), not even using body-gestures (*lus kyi brda tsam yang mi bya*). The phrase "at this time" (*'di'i dus na*) indicates that during this process, one understands the meaning of body-signs (*lus kyi brda don go bar byed*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for gradual path practitioners. Risk of asceticism: interpreting this as value of silence itself rather than recognition-support. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "cutting speech" is not suppression but recognition that speech has never been other than awareness's self-expression.>
