<classification> First: single essence with different perspectives abiding as three kayas in expanse. From Rang Shar: three kayas wisdom appearance, not obstructed to anything, observed object is one, essence appears individually. Also single rig pa's appearance mode. From that: rig pa non-conceptual Dharmakaya essence, rig pa unceasing clarity Sambhogakaya, rig pa appearing variously Nirmanakaya. Perfect, purified.
