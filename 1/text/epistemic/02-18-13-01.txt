<Masterful analysis:
That itself rim-enclosing wall and individual main retinue appearance—Dharmakaya's purification completely pure measure-reached arising. This is rigpa-measure-reached appearance: preliminary times body's actions and doings' connection measure, afterward non-arising sign. That also: though appearing those appearances from preliminary antidotes etc. crucial point, labeled arisen, they are labelers of separation-result and purification-purifier cause-effect, not produced from that arising—wisdom self-existing radiance's stain obscurations purified through power of appearance. The Dzogchen view: these "appearances" are not produced by practice but revealed through recognition. Risk of attainment-mentality: believing "measure-reached" (*tshad phebs*) is a goal achieved through antidotes rather than recognition of ever-present wisdom.

The *Thal 'Gyur* citation: "Rigpa-measure-reached appearance: Sambhogakaya's marks examples clear; uncertain color rainbow from; five families father-mother appearing." And *Bstan bu*: "Likewise body up to: six and ten and five-three; unerringly Sambhogakaya." The individual nature particular explanation: measure-reached definitive terminology generally shown and measure-three particular explained—two. First: rigpa-measure-reached means ground-abiding rigpa manifestly became, path-channel entered, ground-appearance's self-radiance spontaneous present arising-door body-appearance, path-appearance near exhaustion, mandala complete. Measure: first half-body to body's mandala complete. Reached: from that transcended without remainder clearly appearing. These like full moon form—waxing-waning mandala complete, self-face incontrovertible.

Second, measure-three particular explained: outer appearance, inner body measure, secret rigpa measure. First: power-over appearance, pure realm clear-light complete... [continues]. The Dzogchen integration: "measure" is not quantity but recognition's fullness; "reached" is not destination but the realization that there was never anywhere to go.>

[5467-5477] <rigpa-side>
<The gnad-looking teaching (*gzigs stangs las 'grus pa las byung ba'o*) operates from *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. The gnad: (*gzigs*) looking (*stangs las*) establishes (*grus pa*) and (*byung ba*)—this indicates that recognition's "looking" (*gzigs*) is key: seeing recognition's own appearance. The gnad that therefore dharmata's wisdom object gathering recognition (*de nas chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes yul gru tsam du snang ba ni*)—this is provisional describing recognition's relationship to dharmata. The gnad that wisdom's skillful spelling liberates (*de kha dog rab tu spel legs pa las byung ba'o*)—this indicates that wisdom's clarity through precision (*rab tu*) through skill (*spel legs pa*) liberates (*las byung ba*). Risk of gnad-objectification: treating "gnad" as technique rather than recognition-key.>

<The recognition-integration teaching (*de las 'khor lo la sogs pa'i rnam pa sna tshogs su snang ba ni sngon 'gro mthar phyin pa las byung ba'o*) operates as *instructional provisionality* for structured recognition.

[5565-5575] <lineage-blessing-as-self-liberation>
"Our supreme gurus Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava—those relying on such supreme ones, this life or bardo without doubt liberated!"

[CONTEXT] LINEAGE HISTORY: Vimalamitra (*bi ma la*) and Padmasambhava (*pad+ma 'byung gnas*) represent the two primary transmission streams of *snying thig*—the oral lineage (*snyan brgyud*) and treasure lineage (*gter brgyud*). Longchenpa received both streams, integrating them in his *mdzod* corpus. The assertion that reliance on such masters guarantees "this life or bardo" liberation reflects the Nyingma view of lineage blessing (*byin rlabs*) not as external grace but as recognition-support.

Epistemic precision: The phrase "this or bardo" (*'di'am bar do*) establishes the two-fold temporal framework—immediate recognition or recognition during intermediate state. Risk: Devotionalism—misunderstanding reliance on gurus as faith-based dependency rather than recognition-facilitation.

[5576-5589] <appearance-as-path>
Citation from *gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*: "Inner body exhaustion place reached, fingers and so on thus appearing, this relied-upon elements self-cease! Birth and entering's distinction, all dharmas exhausted self-place, anything grasping not, dwelling thus emanation body! This entering force's power, birth's self-power who obtained? That also that relied-upon, again time thus done, appearance's self-sound rustling, manifest reverse confusion appears! This beings' benefit all does! Awareness equal one thus! Three thousand beings' great transference this accomplishes! Thus gradual and instantaneous body this accomplishes! All body exhaustion measure liberated! All fruit certain! Supreme ground great mandala accomplished!"

[CONTEXT] TANTRIC CITATION: The *gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud* (Secret Practice Seed Tantra) belongs to the *rdo rje phreng ba* (Vajra Garland) cycle, cited frequently in Nyingma *snying thig* literature. The "three thousand beings" (*stong phrag gsum*) refers to the cosmic number of sentient beings in traditional cosmology, here liberated through the "great transference" (*'pho ba chen mo*), the Dzogchen practice of consciousness-transference at death.

Epistemic precision: The paradox "appearance's self-sound rustling, manifest reverse confusion appears" (*snang ba'i rang sgra sil skad de mngon du log ste 'khrul par snang*) captures the Dzogchen view that recognition of appearance as self-liberated simultaneously reveals and transcends confusion. Risks: Nihilism—reading "body exhaustion" as literal destruction; Reification—taking "great mandala" as spatial entity.

[5588-5610] <sems-side>
<The recognition-resting teaching (*drangs pa las*) operates from *sems-side* provisional view. The gnad that recognition rests in nature (*rang bzhin*)—this indicates recognition's ground state. The gnad that "without fabrication" (*bcos pa med*)—this establishes that recognition's rest is uncontrived, not a cultivated state. The gnad that "without moving" (*g.yo ba*)—this indicates that recognition is not agitated, stable. The gnad that "without effort" (*'tshul ba*)—this indicates that recognition's rest is effortless, natural. Risk of reification: treating "without fabrication/effort" as states to achieve rather than recognition of primordial quality.>

[5588-5599] <recognition-resting>
<The recognition-resting teaching (*drangs pa las*) operates from *sems-side* provisional view. The gnad that recognition sees (*mthong ba*) and rests (*drangs pa las*)—this establishes direct recognition without intervening conceptualization. The gnad that therefore afflictions (*dngos pa'i*) exhausted (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*)—this is definitive: delusion has never truly existed to eliminate. Risk of cognition-objectification: treating "recognition" as some separate entity to eliminate rather than recognition of its self-nature.>

[5606-5609] [NYINGMA TRADITION & LINEAGE HISTORY]
<The Nyingma tradition (*gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*) and treasure lineage (*gter brgyud*) represent the two primary transmission streams of *snying thig*—the oral lineage (*snyan brgyud*) and the treasure lineage (*gter brgyud*). Longchenpa received both streams, integrating them in his *mdzod* corpus. The gnad that reliance on such masters (*de ltar pa'i thogs kyis zhag gsum*) guarantees liberation without doubt (*'di'am bar do*)—this is *upāya*: when one relies on masters without doubt, the result is certain liberation (*'di'am bar do*). Risk of lineage-reification: treating "reliance" as faith-based dependency rather than transmission facilitation through recognition.>

[5608-5639] <recognition-gathering>
<The recognition-gathering teaching (*de las so sor rtog pa'i gru chad du snang ba ni*)—this is *upāya*: when recognition arises, cognition (*sor rtog pa*) gathers (*gru*) completely (*chad du*) recognition's appearance (*snang ba ni*). The gnad that therefore recognition's experience (*nyams*) spontaneously arises (*'phel 'byung ba'o*)—this indicates that recognition-experience is not something caused but arises naturally from dependence. Risk of reification: treating "recognition-gathering" as metaphysical entity rather than recognition-descriptions of experience modes.>

[5610-5625] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The teaching on reliance (*de ltar pa'i*) operates from *ordinary cognition* (*sems*), not definitive Dzogchen view. The gnad that dependence is (*de ltar*)—this indicates that the teaching provides a provisional framework for those who cannot yet rest in direct recognition. The instruction that one (*gcig*) relies (*ltar*)—on supreme ones (*rin po che*)—indicates the path of faith-based devotion, not wisdom-based recognition. The gnad that no doubt (*'di'am bar do*) arises (*'byung*) from this proper reliance—this indicates that when reliance is correct, liberation (*'di'am bar do*) arises spontaneously without doubt (*'byung*). This is *sems-side* pedagogy for gradual path; risk of devotion-based liberation is that it can create dependency rather than recognition of primordial state.>

[5611-5615] <sems-side>
<The recognition-arising teaching (*rang 'byung ba'o*) operates from *sems-side* provisional view. The gnad that recognition arises (*'byung ba'o*)—this indicates that recognition's experience (*nyams*) emerges spontaneously from its nature. The statement that "arising as experience" (*'byung ba nyams*)—this suggests that recognition's experience (*nyams*) manifests without cause (*rkyen*). The gnad that "from that" (*de nas*)—this establishes causal relationship between recognition's experience and its nature. Risk of practice-reification: treating "arising as experience" as some technique to practice rather than natural manifestation of recognition.>

[5616-5619] <sems-side>
<The recognition-gathering teaching (*rang 'byung ba nyams*) operates from *sems-side* provisional view. The gnad that recognition's experience (*nyams*) is gathered (*'byung ba nyams*)—this indicates that recognition's experience accumulates, not through effort. The statement that "without exertion" (*'brtul kyang brtags tu*)—this indicates effortless accumulation. The gnad that "into self" (*rang ngo ba*)—this indicates that experience returns to recognition's essence (*ngo ba*). Risk of reification: treating "self-return" as some practice technique rather than natural return to primordial state.>

[5626-5637] [NYINGMA LINEAGE TRANSMISSION]
<The two lineages of transmission (*gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud* and *gter brgyud*) are contrasted with their different approaches. The teaching that Nyingma tradition (*gSang ba spyod pa sa bon gyi rgyud*)—those relying on (*de ltar*)—the treasure (*gter*)—this establishes Nyingma as text-based, treasure as mind-based. The citation from Longchenpa's *mdzod*: "Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava" (*bi ma la 'dzin pa* and *pad+ma 'byung gnas*)—these represent the two lineages, not mere historical figures. The gnad that "this or that" (*'di'am bar do*)—this is *upāya*: reliance can be on either without affecting one's own primordial state, suggesting *text-based* versus *mind-based* transmission are equally valid. Risk of substantialism: treating transmission lineages as ontologically distinct rather than pedagogical modalities for different capacities.>

[5638-5639] [SUPREME GURUS & LINEAGE HISTORY]
<The supreme gurus (*rnal 'byor ma bstan pa*)—these are the ultimate authorities. The gnad that such ones have (*rin po che*)—establishes their supreme status (*grub mchog*) and authority (*gnas yod*). The gnad that one (*gcig*) relies (*ltar*)—indicates singular focus. The statement that "those who properly practice" (*dam pa'i slar bzhin pa yin*)—this sets up *upāya* for proper transmission without deviation. The gnad that liberation (*'bras pa*)—this indicates the goal is actual liberation (*'bras pa*), not just correct understanding. The statement that liberation "from such supreme ones" (*de yang rnal 'byor ma bstan pa las 'bras pa*)—this establishes that liberation comes from the lineage, not independently achieved. Risk of devotion-based attainment: treating "liberation from gurus" as grace-based rather than recognition of one's own nature.>

[5646-5588] <rigpa-side>
<The recognition-view teaching (*snang ba gzugs su rdzogs pa'i tshad*) operates from *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The gnad that recognition sees (*mthong ba*)—this establishes direct recognition without intervening conceptualization. The statement that recognition's appearance (*snang ba*) becomes exhausted (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*)—this indicates that when recognition recognizes, delusion (*rdzogs pa'i tshad*) is exhausted (*zad*). The gnad that recognition rests (*drangs pa las*)—this establishes the non-dual state after recognition. The gnad that "not two but one" (*gnyis pa ma yin gcig*)—this indicates the ultimate non-duality (*gnyis pa*) of recognition and display. Risk of view collapse: mixing *rigpa-side* non-dual recognition with *sems-side* dualistic teachings about practice states.>
