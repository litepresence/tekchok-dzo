Here before accepted as path appearance also is, result also is not contradictory think, first path appearance is, spontaneous presence sheath kadag great that meaning result house like from, there enter and there from open ground kadag outer appearance dawns must. The apparent contradiction between result and non-result is resolved in non-dual view. Risk of contradiction: taking the negations literally rather than as pointing to primordial completion.>
