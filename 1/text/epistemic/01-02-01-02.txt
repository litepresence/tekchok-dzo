[892-900] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<The degenerative cosmology—80,000-year lifespan diminishing through kalpa cycles to ten-year minimum—presents standard Buddhist eschatology from *Cakkavatti Sutta* sources. The five degenerations (*snyigs ma lnga*) of lifespan, views, afflictions, beings, and eon operate within causal vehicle karmic framework. Risk: Literalizing temporal devolution as historical prediction rather than recognition of impermanence (*mi rtag pa*) patterns.>

[901-920] <sems-side>
<The Maitreya prophesy and reversal narrative (moral restoration, lifespan extension) employs sems-side teleological framework within Buddhist eschatology. This gradualist restoration model operates at provisional level, preparing practitioners for definitive recognition that transcend such temporal cycling. The "fortunate aeon" (*bskal pa bzang po*) concept remains within conventional auspiciousness framework.>

[921-940] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<The container-contained cosmogony conclusion (hells, preta realms, animal abodes, human continents, god heavens) completes standard Buddhist cosmological enumeration. The eight hot and eight cold hells with specific torture descriptions operate within conventional moral-karmic descriptive framework.>

[941-960] <rigpa-side>
<The cosmological presentation transposes into definitive Dzogchen framing through recognition that all realms are spontaneous display (*lhun grub kyi snang ba*) of primordial awareness. This is not rejection of conventional cosmology but hermeneutical repositioning—samsara's six realms (*'gro ba rigs drug*) and nirvana's pure fields (*zhing khams*) are equally *rang snang* (self-appearance) without ontological hierarchy.>

[961-980] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<The three-thousand-world-system (*stong gsum gyi 'jig rten gyi khams*) completion with central Mount Meru (*ri rab*), surrounding mountain ranges, and cosmic ocean presents finalized Abhidharmic cosmology. The dimensional specifications (160,000 leagues height for Meru, four terraces) follow Vasubandhu's *Kośa* conventions.>

[981-996] <sems-side>
<The Sahā world (*mi mjed kyi 'jig rten*) as thirteenth in the twenty-five stacked array transitions to Dzogchen reframing. The "basis-essence-flower-ornamented" (*gzhi snying po me tog gis brgyan pa*) terminology encodes recognition-topology, preparing for definitive view. Risk: Treating stacked cosmology as literal vertical spatial arrangement rather than multidimensional recognition-mandala.>
