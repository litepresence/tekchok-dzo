[4172-4183] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
<The twofold division into meaning tantra (*don gyi rgyud*) and word tantra (*tshig gi rgyud*): meaning tantra as mind-essence naturally clear light free from conceptual affliction stains, universally abiding; word tantra as that indicated by names-words-letters-sections. This parallels *nges don* (definitive meaning) and *drang don* (provisional meaning) distinction applied to tantric corpus. The phrase *sems nyid rang bzhin gyis 'od gsal ba* (mind-essence naturally clear light) bridges tantric and Dzogchen view—clear light (*'od gsal*) as common terminology with different implications.>

<The tenfold criteria (*ldang tshad*) for development stage (*bskyed rim*) prominence—ground/empowerment/samaya, deity/mantra, maṇḍala/offering, samādhi/conduct, activity/view—establish tantric classification system. The eightfold criteria for completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) prominence—view/result, conduct/meditation, mind/wisdom, experience/instruction. These are taxonomical tools for textual categorization, not practice prescriptions. The *zung 'jug gnyis su med pa* (union nonduality) requiring both sets (18 total) indicates analytic framework for classifying tantras by emphasis, not ontological claims about practice requirements.>

[4211-4271] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
<The twofold division of meaning tantra (*don gyi rgyud*) into method (*thabs*) tantra and nature (*rang bzhin*) tantra establishes tantric hermeneutics. Method tantra's essence: awareness (*rig pa*) and that meaning's practice instructions. The citation from *Mu tig phreng ba* (Pearl Garland) demonstrates tantric view: emptiness (*stong pa*) and clarity (*gsal ba*) as twofold pervasion (*khyab pa*)—emptiness pervading because causeless entityless, clarity pervading because unceasing self-radiance. This is *rgyud* as continuity of realization, not merely textual transmission.>

[4220-4233] <rigpa-side>
<The definition of indicated method tantra (*mtshon bya thabs kyi rgyud*): awareness-emptiness great wisdom pervading all beings—*byang chub kyi sems* (bodhicitta) as *rig pa*'s universal presence. The phrase *rig pa gsal stong ye shes chen pos* (awareness clarity-emptiness great wisdom) bridges tantric and Dzogchen: in tantra, clear light (*'od gsal*) is result of practice; in Dzogchen, it is primordial ground (*gzhi*). The five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) and five elements (*'byung ba lnga*) as spontaneously accomplished (*lhun gyis grub pa*) indicates *lhun grub* framing within tantric context.>

[4272-4280] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
<Indicating method tantra (*mtshon byed thabs kyi rgyud*): instruction pointing out meaning-to-be-indicated for realizing awareness. The definition emphasizes *nyams len gyi gnad dril nas* (condensing practice essential points)—this is skillful means (*thabs*), not the pointed-to itself. The distinction between explanation tantras (*bshad rgyud*) as difficult wordy and instruction tantras (*man ngag gi rgyud*) as clear and easy indicates pedagogical stratification. Dzogchen tantras classified as *man ngag gi rgyud* because direct pointing (*ngo sprod*) rather than philosophical elaboration.>

[4281-4282] <sems-side>
<The twofold division into effort-free primordial liberation (*'bad med ye grol*) and effortful gradual (*'bad bcas rim pas*): first is *gzhi khregs chod* (cutting through ground) for simultaneous (*cig car*) capacities; second is *lam thod rgal* (direct transcendence leap) for gradual (*rim gyis*) capacities using channels/winds essential points (*rtsa rlung gi gnad*). This is Dzogchen's *sde gsum* (three series) taxonomy: *sems sde* (cutting through), *klong sde* (direct transcendence), *man ngag gi sde* (instruction). The three essential points—body, gate, object—are *lam* (path) frameworks, not ontological requirements. Four appearances (*snang ba bzhi*) reaching measure indicates tantric completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) framework applied to Dzogchen.>
