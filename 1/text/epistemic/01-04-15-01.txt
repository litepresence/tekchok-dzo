<The *khra bo* (variegated/manifold) category represents Dzogchen's non-dual transcendence of existence (*yin*) and non-existence (*min*) extremes. The phrase *yin min phyogs gtad dang bral ba* (free from is/is-not directional fixation) signals the *mu bzhi* (four extremes) transcendence that characterizes definitive (*nges don*) Dzogchen view. This is not philosophical agnosticism but *rang byung ye shes* (self-arising wisdom) beyond conceptual construction (*spros pa*).>

[3737-3744] <rigpa-side>
<The threefold division of *khra bo'i sde* (variegated category) maps onto the three Dzogchen textual systems: (1) *yod par smra ba* (proponents of existence) corresponding to *sems sde* (mind series), (2) *med par smra ba* (proponents of non-existence) corresponding to *rang gnad* (self-essential-point), and (3) *yod med man ngag dang mthun par smra ba* (proponents corresponding to instructions on existence/non-existence). This is taxonomical mapping for pedagogical clarity, not ontological taxonomy—each points to the same *chos nyid* (dharmatā) from different entry points.>

[3745-3750] <sems-side>
<First *khra bo* subcategory: essence (*ngo bo*) as self-purified abiding liberation (*rang dag gi gnas pa'i grol ba*)—unforked/undivided (*gang du yang ma phyed*) nature beyond affirmation/negation (*dgag sgrub*). The phrase *th snyad bya rtsol las 'das pa* (beyond conceptual construction and effort/contrivance) indicates this is *lam* (path) description within *sems sde* framework, not *rig pa* recognition itself. The single wheel (*'khor lo gcig*) of existing mind references *sems sde*'s emphasis on *sems nyid* (mind-essence) as immediate accessibility.>

[3751-3754] <rigpa-side>
<Second *khra bo* subcategory: essence as appearance-emptiness self-liberated (*mthong snang rang sar grol*)—mind as dharmatā appearing manifoldly (*chos nyid sna tshogs su shar*). The liberation of non-existent appearances (*med snang*) without virtue/non-virtue (*dge sdig*) indicates *thabs* (means) as non-dual with *shes rab* (wisdom). This corresponds to *klong sde* (space/expanse series) view where appearance (*snang ba*) and emptiness (*stong pa*) are simultaneous (*gcig char*), not sequential.>

[3755-3763] <rigpa-side>
<Third *khra bo* subcategory: essence as emptiness primordially pure (*stong pa ye dag*)—action without cause-fruition dependence (*las rgyu 'bras la mi ltos*). The phrase *byung sar stong pas* (arising-place is empty) indicates *gnas 'gyur gnyis med* (transformation-free nonduality)—samsara/nirvana liberated in direction all (*'khor 'das phyogs yan du grol*). The three essential points (*gnad gsum*) of indescribability, unseeability, and transformation-free abiding correspond to *man ngag gi sde* (instruction series) pointing-out. This is *klong dkar po* (white space/expanse)—pure presence beyond fabrication.>

[3764-3765] <rigpa-side>
<The *klong dkar po* (white space/expanse) category presents Dzogchen view through two modalities: (1) *las rgya che ba brjod med du bshad pa* (explaining great activity as inexpressible) and (2) *lta sgom kha sbyar* (view-meditation combined/joined). The essence (*ngo bo*) as *mthong ba cer grol* (seeing precisely/merely liberated) indicates *lta ba* (view) as immediate recognition without gradation—seeing itself IS liberation, not a cause for future liberation. This is *ye grol* (primordial liberation) versus *bsgrol* (liberating).>
