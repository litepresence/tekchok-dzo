[10548-10551] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<Second section: refutation of seven bases with faults (*skyon can*). Line 10537 "blind before elephant say like"—classic Indian parable: multiple blind men touch different parts of elephant, each claims exclusive truth. Seven bases are partial views, not comprehensive. Lines 10538-10539: "awareness's direction one realize's part to cling promise deep placed one accompany after view by-means-of, that refute to meaning seven from"—those attached to partial realization of awareness cling deeply, promising profound meaning, but the seven refute this. Lines 10540-10542: first refute spontaneous presence view (*lhun grub kyi lta ba*). Two arguments against lhun grub:

**Argument 1** (10543-10446): Spontaneous presence as ground-reality (*bden gshis*) implies India never cut off (*rgya gar yang ma gcod*)—samsara would have no beginning. View would fall to any direction (*phyogs gang du yang mi ltung*), i.e., nihilism.

**Argument 2** (10547-10548): If first-from spontaneous accomplishment, then nirvana would depend on conditions (self-face knowing, etc.) rather than being primordially accomplished. This contradicts Dzogchen view of *ye nas lhun grub*.

**Consequence** (10549-10551): If basis is spontaneous presence, either (1) samsara-nirvana cannot arise (unchanging), or (2) everyone liberates effortlessly without practice. Both absurd. This is *dbu ma* (Madhyamaka) style refutation showing extremes untenable.>

---

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – BEYOND REFUTATION]
[SYNTHESIS]

<The refutation is pedagogical, not nihilistic. Lines 10536-10551 present *sūtric provisional* critique of reifying any single view of basis—including spontaneous presence. But the critique itself is provisional. The actual Dzogchen view (10519-10535) is that basis transcends all characterizations while accommodating all appearances. The ten characteristics are not definitions but descriptions of how basis manifests to different recognitions. The seven bases framework (previous page) includes all possible views to show all views partial. The Six Spaces Tantra citation establishes scriptural authority for basis beyond causal origination (*thog ma babs*—primordial descent). Risk: Taking refutation as denial of basis itself, rather than denial of reified views of basis. The basis IS spontaneously present AND primordially pure AND not describable by any single characteristic. This is not contradiction but completion.>

[10552-10560] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<Critique of "cause-effect primordially spontaneously-accomplished" position. Lines 10552-10553: If cause and effect are both primordially spontaneously accomplished (*rgyu 'bras ye nas lhun grub*), then they exist simultaneously (*dus gcig*). This violates causal temporal sequence—cause must precede effect. Lines 10554-10558: If cause is samsara and effect is nirvana, and they are one (*gcig*), then samsara IS nirvana and nirvana IS samsana. But this means separation (*so so*) is impossible, contradicting distinction between pure (*dag*) and impure (*ma dag*). Lines 10559-10560: "pure impure exist cause clear, those and other also faults many not dwell"—the clear existence of pure/impure causes many other faults in this view. This is classic *dbu ma* (Madhyamaka) reasoning: reifying spontaneous presence as inherent characteristic creates logical contradictions with conventional causality.>

---

[10561-10576] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<Citation from Six Spaces Tantra (10561-10562): spontaneous accomplishment as variety basis (*lhun grub sna tshogs gzhi*) is "truly not correct base" (*yang dag gzhi ma yin*). Lines 10563-10566: If this were the basis, sentient beings would not become liberated through effort (*'bad rtsol*)—liberation would already be accomplished. Line 10567: non-recognition (*ma rtogs*) itself obscures—the very condition preventing liberation is itself spontaneously accomplished, creating paradox. Lines 10568-10569: If awareness exists as cause of liberation, then effect (liberation) is also not accomplished spontaneously—contradicting premise. Lines 10570-10572: Charcoal analogy—just as black charcoal cannot become white through washing (color cannot change), if cause and effect are spontaneously accomplished as different, they cannot transform into each other. Lines 10573-10576: If cause-effect are one, effort is not needed for those sentient beings. Both alternatives (one/separate) lead to absurdity. This is *thal 'gyur* (prasaṅga) reasoning—reducing opponent's position to absurd consequences.>

---

[10577-10598] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<Lines 10577-10578: "Therefore spontaneous-accomplishment called base, meaning understand able not"—the term "spontaneous accomplishment" applied to basis is incomprehensible. Lines 10579-10584: Samantabhadra/bodhisattva dialogue cited—"as you understand like, this knowable dharmas only-from correct essence not"—knowable dharmas lack correct essence. This is *ye shes* (primordial wisdom) view that phenomena are empty of inherent nature. Lines 10585-10593: Second position refuted: "nature not established cause not determined" (*rang bzhin ma grub rgyu nges med*). From Mind Section (*Sems sde*): "not-determined name-of variety from, meaning also label only-by-means-of empty"—varieties of not-determined are merely labels, empty of meaning. Nature as one is not determined cause; whatever label, appears like that. This is *sems tsam* (Yogācāra) influenced view—nature is mentally imputed, not inherently existent. Lines 10594-10598: Final refutation: If one, contradiction; if nature not determined, then samsara-cause and nirvana-basis both unclear; if basis pure then impure not cause—alternation not determined contradicts cause. Complete logical closure showing all positions untenable.>

---

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SYNTHESIS]
[BEYOND REFUTATION]

<The extended refutation (pages 256-257) serves pedagogical purpose, not metaphysical denial. The Seven Spaces Tantra and Mind Section citations establish that basis transcends:
1. Spontaneous presence as inherent characteristic (refuted 10552-10576)
2. Nature as determinable entity (refuted 10585-10598)

But this is *sūtric provisional* critique of *reified* views, not denial of basis itself. The actual Dzogchen view: basis IS spontaneously present (*lhun grub*) AND primordially pure (*ka dag*) AND empty of inherent existence (*ngo bo nyid med*)—these are not contradictory but co-emergent aspects of single recognition. The refutation clears away conceptual fixation so recognition can occur without obstruction. Risk: Taking refutation as nihilistic denial—"nothing exists, nothing can be known." Actual meaning: nothing exists INHERENTLY, everything can be known through direct recognition (*rtogs pa*). The fault lies in reification, not in appearance. Lines 10567 is key: "non-recognition itself-by-means-of obscured cause"—the problem is not spontaneous presence but failure to recognize it. Recognition liberates; non-recognition obscures. Both are spontaneous, but recognition is key.>

[10599-10606] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<Lines 10599-10601: "Also impurity pure-from also impure revert follows, base-to not-determined ground no cause, also samsara-nirvana mutually mix follows"—if impure samsara reverts to pure nirvana and basis is not determined, there is no ground or cause preventing reversion. Samsara and nirvana would mutually mix (*'dres*), losing distinction. Lines 10602-10603: "base not-determined cause anywhere change being cause, accept-if sentient beings effort without liberate"—if basis is undetermined and can change anywhere, sentient beings would liberate without effort. Line 10604: "Buddha impure revert cause suffering-to engage follows"—Buddhas could revert to impurity and engage with suffering. Lines 10605-10606: "base that mind-possessor-as follows not-determined thus one-only assert-as determined cause, those etcetera-of faults many exist"—asserting basis as both not-determined and one-only creates many faults. This is reductio ad absurdum: if basis lacks determinacy, all distinctions collapse.>

---

[10607-10619] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<Citation from Six Spaces Tantra (10607-10608): "not-determined of base said"—but this basis is "truly not-able" (*yang dag mi nus*). Lines 10609-10613: Samantabhadra questions: "I intelligence level this-like understand, effect alternation possess-or, or revert with become, not-determined determined become"—does effect possess alternation? Or does it revert? How can not-determined become determined? Lines 10614-10618: "own not-determined own exist cause, determined be-if action end like, this all knowable not, teacher said that-like"—if own not-determined exists as own cause, and determined is like ended action (past), then this is unknowable. The teacher speaks thus. This is *gnas lugs* (mode of being) critique: not-determined basis makes knowledge impossible.>

---

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – SYNTHESIS]
[BEYOND DICHOTOMIES]

<The extended refutation of three positions (spontaneous presence, not-determined, essence-appearance) serves to clear conceptual fixation. The actual Dzogchen view transcends all these dichotomies:
- Basis IS spontaneously present but not as inherent characteristic
- Basis IS not determined but this is freedom, not ignorance
- Essence IS unchanging but appearance IS changing—without contradiction

The key is *rtogs pa* (recognition), not logical position. All these refutations apply to *reified* views, not to actual basis. Lines 10637 "base that realize-if determined accept cause base-as not possible"—if basis is realized, accepting it as determined is impossible; basis transcends determination/non-determination. This is *nges 'byung* (definite emergence) from conceptual extremes. The refutation is medicine, not food—take it to cure fixation, then discard it. Risk: Endless logical proliferation, missing the pointing. The three pages of refutation (256-258) are exhaustive to satisfy intellectual doubt, but recognition occurs in immediacy beyond argument.>

[10638-10644] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<Lines 10638-10640: "realization-of before realization-base exist and, then cognition-of mind arise cause realization-to base not depend, base-to realization-of mind depend even"—if basis exists before realization, then cognitive mind arising causes realization not to depend on basis, yet basis depends on realization-mind. This is circular: basis requires realization, realization requires basis. Lines 10641-10644: "realization-of before exist must cause pervade, not realize also base be-if base being what know, mind know-if not realize also base being fall, those etcetera-of faults perceive also"—if realization must exist before, this pervades everything. If non-realization is also basis, what is known? If mind knows, non-realization falls to being basis. Many faults perceived. This critiques causal models of awakening: basis cannot precede realization (would be inaccessible), realization cannot precede basis (would be groundless).>

"Self-to revert-of distinction by-means-of, self other two not determined limit free, therefore that also correct not"—through distinction of self-reversion, self and other not determined, free from limits, therefore not correct. This is *gzhan stong* (other-emptiness) influenced: basis empty of other (determinations), not self-empty.

Lines 10664-10667: "also effect cause revert follow, change-of base being cause, earth etcetera matter also awareness become and, awareness also matter become follow"—effect-cause reversion follows; basis as changeable cause means matter becomes awareness and vice versa. Lines 10668-10679: Detailed analysis: if essence not divided changes, or other changes, either essence cannot be basis (10670) or other dharmas change from basis (10671), damaging essence (10672).

[DZOGCHEN VIEW – PRIMORDIAL COMPLETENESS]
[BEYOND CAUSALITY]

<The four positions refuted (spontaneous presence, not-determined, determined, changeable) exhaust conceptual possibilities. The actual Dzogchen view: basis transcends all categories because it is primordially complete (*ye nas rdzogs pa*). The refutations apply to reified views, not to recognition. Key insight from 10677-10679: three-times analysis shows change is conceptually impossible—past/future non-existent, present already gone. Yet change appears. This appearance is *lhun grub*—spontaneous presence—not causally produced, not inherently existent, yet vividly manifest. The basis is not "something" that changes or doesn't change. It is *ngo bo nyid* (suchness) beyond existence/non-existence, change/ permanence, determined/undetermined. Recognition (*rtogs pa*) is not cognitive event in time (refuted 10638-10644) but timeless immediacy. The extensive logical analysis serves to exhaust intellect so recognition can occur without conceptual obstruction. This is *thal 'gyur* (prasaṅga) methodology applied to Dzogchen view.>

<Analysis employing Dzogchen technical vocabulary reveals the sophisticated integration of>
<categorical frameworks within Dzogchen's overarching non-dual perspective. Terms such as>
<chos sku (Dharmakaya), longs sku (Sambhogakaya), and sprul sku (Nirmanakaya) organize>
<apparent pedagogical hierarchy while ultimately demonstrating their dbyer med>
<(inseparability) in single gnosis. The gzhi (ground) as chos nyid (dharmata) encompasses>
<all vehicles without distinction, yet manifests as differentiated teachings according to>
<dbang po (capacity). The rang bzhin (nature) as 'od gsal (luminosity) and ngo bo (essence)>
<as stong pa (emptiness) structure the ground-view without substantializing these>
<designations. The analysis recognizes that conventional descriptors constitute>
<conventional truth (kun rdzob bden pa) pointing toward ultimate truth (don dam bden pa)>
<that is brjod du med pa (ineffable). The gdod ma'i gnas lugs (primordial state) remains>
<unaffected by apparent progression through paths and stages, which serve as>
<recognition-supports rather than causal necessities.>

<Hermeneutical framework for this section requires understanding the pedagogical function>
<of apparent hierarchy and graduated presentation. The [DEFINITIVE MEANING] designation>
<indicates teaching appropriate for practitioners approaching from conventional engagement>
<requiring structured support. However, the Dzogchen view maintains that all such>
<frameworks serve single purpose: recognition of rig pa (awareness) as one's own nature.>
<The apparent distinction between vehicles, gradual and instantaneous approaches, and>
<cause-effect relationships dissolves when viewed from chos nyid perspective. The text>
<anticipates objections through dris lan (question-answer) format, demonstrating>
<sophisticated awareness of potential misunderstandings and scholastic concerns. The rin po>
<che sna bdun (seven treasures) structure—ground, path, view, conduct, result, samaya, and>
<activity—organizes apparent complexity into coherent framework while maintaining ultimate>
<simplicity of recognition without complexity.>

<Integration with treasury structure demonstrates Longchenpa's architectural sophistication>
<in presenting comprehensive Dharma. This page contributes to systematic exposition>
<building upon previous foundations while preparing ground for subsequent teachings of>
<increasing profundity. The epistemic layer traces how conventional discourse encodes>
<recognition-instructions when properly understood through definitive view. The citation>
<strategy—quoting authoritative sources from Sutra and Tantra—establishes textual>
<legitimacy while demonstrating interpretive creativity and synthetic mastery. The>
<framework appears causal while serving recognition-function, establishing transmission>
<continuity while demonstrating non-temporal nature of authentic realization. Each element>
<serves dual function: conventional credibility for those requiring structure and ultimate>
<recognition-support for those with capacity for direct introduction.>

<Dzogchen view on this material recognizes the profound integration of provisional>
<scaffolding and definitive meaning. The rang byung (self-arisen) quality of realization>
<precludes constructed accumulation (tshogs bsags) as causal necessity, while accommodating>
<such practices as recognition-supports for those requiring gradual engagement. The vehicle>
<hierarchy (theg pa dgu) dissolves when recognized as rig pa's self-expression rather than>
<ontological hierarchy. The bum chog (vase empowerment), gsang dbang (secret empowerment),>
<shes rab ye shes (prajna-jnana), and tshig dbang (word empowerment) serve as>
<recognition-gates, not causal transmissions. This sophisticated dialectic—maintaining>
<apparent structure while pointing beyond structure—characterizes authentic Dzogchen>
<presentation throughout the Treasury. Longchenpa's mastery manifests in seamless>
<integration of detailed philosophical exposition with direct recognition-pointing,>
<satisfying both intellectual and experiential requirements.>

<Lines 10680-10683: "change possible not perceive cause base whatever change able that not valid, that itself from, change able called before said cause, own state change able-if this also determined not same"—if change is possible without perceiving cause, basis as whatever-changeable is invalid. From itself, called changeable before—if own state changes, this is not same as determined. Lines 10684-10691: Consequences: effect-cause reversion (*'bras rgyu phyir ldog*), effort not needed for those, again-again reversion, matter-by-awareness impossible transformation. "This also knowable not, said that also that-like"—this too is unknowable, said thus. This extends previous critique: change without perceiver/recognizer leads to infinite regress and transformation impossibilities.>

[10693-10698] [SŪTRIC PROVISIONAL VIEW]
<Fifth position (10693-10694): "awareness-of essence-to direction not everywhere arise cause whatever accept"—awareness essence direction not everywhere arising, accepting whatever. Refutation (10695-10706): "whatever accept that, base that-from dwell accept or not dwell accept"—if whatever is accepted, does it dwell in basis or not? If dwell (like first position), permanent-impermanent both established together (10700), impermanent appears only as dwell. If impermanent established but permanent not, whatever-acceptance is damaged (10702). "Like-that samsara effort without liberate and, liberation those revert follow"—samsara liberates without effort, liberation reverts. Lines 10706-10715: "Second like-if rabbit-horn and barren-woman-of son samsara-nirvana make also accept etcetera limit not fault perceive"—like second position, rabbit horns and barren woman's son make samsara-nirvana, limitless faults. Teacher said before: "this all direction-of projection only, all being establish cause, limit not fault become cause, this also knowable not"—all mere directional projection, establishing all being causes limitless faults, unknowable. This is *kun brtags* (imputation) critique: accepting "whatever" allows absurdities.>
