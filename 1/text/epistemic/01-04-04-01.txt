[2836-2843] <two-truths-unity>
<classification>
All phenomena of samsara and nirvana are of the nature of the two truths. This is the central Madhyamaka framework that Dzogchen employs while transcending. The citation from Root Wisdom establishes this as the Buddha's teaching method—relying on two truths to teach the Dharma. The Sutra of Magical Display (Mayajala) confirms this approach. [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that the two truths are ultimately not two, yet uses this framework pedagogically.

[2844-2853] <false-conventional-appearance>
<classification>
False conventional refers to all phenomena designated by mind—appearances that function conventionally while being empty ultimately. The three characteristics: appearing to confused mind, having functional efficacy, being empty of inherent existence when analyzed. The eight examples (dream, illusion, mirage, etc.) demonstrate appearance-emptiness union. This is not appearance-denial but appearance-contextualization. [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] maintains full functional reality while recognizing lack of inherent existence.

[2854-2861] <appearance-emptiness-unity>
<classification>
The similes establish that phenomena appear (gsal snang) while being empty (stong pa)—not appearing then empty, not empty then appearing, but appearing-emptiness as unity (gsal stong zung 'jug). This is the MAYA doctrine—magical appearance without substantial existence. The eight examples cover various types of illusory appearance: internal (dream), external (mirage), mental (magical display), physical (echo), etc. All demonstrate the same principle.

[2862-2869] <true-conventional-path>
<classification>
True conventional refers to path phenomena—virtuous actions, accumulations, stages of the path. These are conventionally real in producing results (good rebirth, liberation) while being ultimately empty. The ten virtuous actions produce higher rebirth; the six perfections accumulate merit and wisdom; the four stages of path produce realization. All are [CONVENTIONAL TRUTH] in action—functionally effective yet empty. The Uttaratantra citation confirms that all path truths are compounded and therefore conventional.

[2870-2872] <ultimate-truth-emptiness>
<classification>
Ultimate truth is defined as the nature of phenomena (chos nyid)—emptiness of inherent existence. This is recognized through the wisdom of subsequent attainment (rjes thob ye shes) in its peaceful aspect free from conceptual elaboration. The distinction between nominal ultimate (conceptual understanding of emptiness) and non-nominal ultimate (direct realization beyond concepts) will be developed. [DEFINITIVE MEANING] points to the non-nominal ultimate—rigpa beyond all elaboration.
