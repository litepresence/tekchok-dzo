[3037-3039] <svatantrika-prasangika-distinction>
<classification>
The transition from Cittamatra to Madhyamaka is presented, distinguishing Svatantrika (rang rgyud pa) from Prasangika (thal 'gyur pa). The key difference: Svatantrika uses formal syllogistic reasoning (svatantra pramana) to establish emptiness, while Prasangika employs reductio ad absurdum (prasanga) to demonstrate the consequences of opponents' positions without asserting any thesis. Both represent [PROVISIONAL MEANING] approaches to emptiness from the Dzogchen perspective.

[3037-3039] <svasamvedana-deconstruction>
<classification>
The Madhyamaka critique of Cittamatra's self-awareness (so so rang rig): even the self-aware, self-luminous primordial wisdom is naturally empty of essence (rang bzhin gyis ngo bo nyid med pa). The Svātantrika-Prasaṅgika analysis demonstrates that if consciousness existed inherently, it could not be self-aware; if it did not exist, there would be nothing to be aware. The middle way transcends both existence and non-existence. [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes this as the natural state beyond all positions.

[3037-3039] <illusion-ultimate-position>
<classification>
The Svātantrika subschool that holds illusion as ultimate (sgyu ma don dam du 'dod pa) maintains that while conventional phenomena are empty of inherent existence, the appearance-aspect of illusion possesses some form of ultimate existence. This represents a subtle eternalism within Madhyamaka—grasping at the clarity aspect of mind as truly existent. [DZOGCHEN VIEW] recognizes that even the luminous aspect of appearance is empty, beyond both existence and non-existence.
</classification>

[3037-3039] <non-abiding-position>
<classification>
The Prasaṅgika position of "non-abiding" (rab tu mi gnas pa) or "no-position" transcends all philosophical extremes—including the subtle grasping at appearance as ultimate. This is not mere nihilistic negation but the recognition that all positions are conventional designations, ultimately inapplicable to the nature of reality. From [DEFINITIVE MEANING], this points to rigpa beyond all conceptual elaboration (spros bral)—neither existing, nor non-existing, nor both, nor neither.
