<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Internal mind-included dhatus as container-contained appearances. Container as karma-accumulated appearing like objects—external object appearances from mind's delusion, internal mind from display-potential self-nature. External object appearances as mind's habitual patterns like dreams. Internal mind-included dhatus divided into container-holding and mind-arising dhatus. Container dhatus: form realm from great memory, formless from extensive memory, desire from holding memory as separate.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Internal mind display-potential self-arising: rig pa existing, obstructing potential as all-basis ignorance, all-basis consciousness depending on it, mind and five sense doors' cognition arising. Like golden ground with wish-fulfilling tree producing branches, flowers, leaves. Declaration of awareness-display relationship.

<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Six consciousness dhatus—visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, mental, tactile—each perceiving respective object domain. Born from delusion's inward grasping aspect. All conventional phenomena emerging from rig pa ground yet empty of inherent existence. Skandhas with and without conceptualization reflecting gradual vehicle approach. Instructional provisionality of aggregate analysis as doorway to recognition.
