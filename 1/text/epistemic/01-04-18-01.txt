[3888-3892] <rigpa-side>
<Thigle placement> <nadi-practice>
**Analysis:** The four vital points (*gnad bzhi*) of Anuyoga's completion stage practice:

1. **Tsā'i gnad kyi rlung gnas la phab pa** [3888]: Placing wind in the nāḍī's vital point—directing prāṇa into the central channel
2. **De nyid dbyibs phyin pas** [3889]: Through that very gesture perfecting form—physical posture sealing the channels
3. **Rlung gnad lus la phab pas** [3891]: Placing wind-vital-point in body—disconnecting body-mind duality
4. **Rtsā rlung yengs la bor bas** [3892]: Leaving nāḍī-wind to natural distraction—allowing spontaneous liberation

**Technical Terminology:**
- *Tsā/ptsā*: nāḍī (subtle channel)
- *Rlung*: prāṇa/vāyu (wind/energy)
- *Thigle*: bindu (drop/essence)
- *Gnad*: vital point/crucial instruction

**Classification:** This is *rnal 'byor chen po* (mahāyoga) completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) practice, specifically the *snyan rgyud* (aural lineage) transmission.

[3994-4006] <rigpa-side>
<Three kayas> <primordial purity>
**Analysis:** The three aspects of Atiyoga's "basis-of-all purification" (*kun gzhi rnam dag*):

1. **Ma rig pa'i rgyud dag** [3994-3996]: Ignorance's cause purified—not experiencing confusion, karma-affliction basis empty, future confusion impossible
2. **Rang bzhin la dbyer med** [3997-3999]: Nature without distinction—saṃsāra-nirvāṇa single ground, confusion completely pure
3. **Gsum pa'i ngo bo** [4000-4006]: Third essence—falling basis empty, nature beyond calculation, characteristics non-dual

**Key Distinction:** These describe the *ye grol* (primordial liberation) view—the basis has always been pure, confusion never truly existed.

[4007-4020] <rigpa-side>
<Thigle rang gnas> <aural lineage>
**Analysis:** Thigle in self-abiding (*thigle rang gnas*) represents the non-dual essence beyond parts:

**Essence** (*ngo bo*) [4004]: Singular, free from elaboration, without parts
**Nature** (*rang bzhin*) [4005]: Without multiplicity, transcending expression
**Characteristics** (*mtshan nyid*) [4006]: All-pervading dharmatā

**Lineage Distinction** [4007-4020]:
- **Snyan rgyud** (aural): Connected one-to-one, ear faculty connection, decisive confidence
- **Bshad rgyud** (explanation): Transforming three realms, nature clear light, characteristics transcending examination

**Pedagogical Note:** The *snyan rgyud* is "secret" (*gsang ba*) because it cannot be transmitted through books—only direct oral transmission.
