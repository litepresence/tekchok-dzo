[5159-5159] <child-like>
<The child-like (*lta bu*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for recognition description. The series of seeing child-like (*lta bu dang*) appearing as: fire-maker (*rin bu me khyer*), seeing (*sprin lta bu*), poison (*du ba*), peacock (*smug zil*), flowering (*zla ba shar ba*), star (*skar ma shar ba*), circling (*nam sros pa*), eye-born (*nyi ma shar ba*)—these are recognition-descriptions, not visual objects to create. The analysis: outer (*ltar phyi*), inner expanse (*nang zang thal bar snang ba lta bu dang brgyad de*), clouds arising (*'char nub dang gsal 'grib tu byung bas*), not stable (*mi brtan tshugs mi thub 'gyur 'gro bas mthar 'gyur gyi nyams zhes bya ste*)—this indicates that recognition sees outer and inner display simultaneously, with clouds (*'grib*) obscuring and clearing continuously. Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "child-like displays" as meditation objects rather than recognition's natural manifestation.>

[5159-5175] <wind-mind>
<The wind-mind (*rlung sems*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that therefore, wind mind's object (*'di dag byar yod de rlung sems dag dgos pa'i phyir ro*)—this establishes that the wind and mind (*rlung sems*) that appear have purpose (*dgos pa*) of recognition, not independent existence. The appearance's experience (*snang ba'i nyams ni*)—this indicates that appearance's experience is the context for understanding wind-mind relationship. The analysis: awareness's self-resonance, light-clear, essence (*rig pa'i rang gdangs 'od gsal chen po ste*)—this is the definitive description of recognition: self-resonance (*rang gdangs*), luminosity (*'od gsal*), essence (*chen po*). Risk of substantialism: treating "wind-mind" as subtle entities rather than recognition's display modes.>

[5159-5170] <afflictions-liberation>
<The affliction's liberation teaching operates from *sems-side* provisional view. The statement that self-grasping, afflictions and (*'dzin gang zag dang*) dharmata, self-nature (*chos kyi bdag med rtog pa zhes bya'o*)—this indicates that self-grasping's afflictions are recognized as dharmata's self-nature (*bdag med*). This is *sems-side* analysis: through philosophical reasoning (*rtog pa*), one recognizes that afflictions lack self-nature. The gnad that not-existing, not-attaining (*ma gtogs pa med pas*)—this indicates that what was recognized as affliction never truly existed to attain. Risk of view collapse: mistaking *sems-side* philosophical recognition for definitive Dzogchen recognition—the former is provisional understanding through reasoning, latter is direct recognition.>

[5159-5160] <five-families>
<The five-families (*rigs rnam pa*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side* of Dzogchen view. The description: Ye She's (*ye shes mkhar thab kyi rnam pa 'dra ba dang*), Nyi Dzong's (*nyi zla zung sbrel gyi rnam pa 'dra ba dang*), Padma's precious (*pad+ma brtsegs pa'i rnam pa 'dra ba dang*), Offering-precious (*mchod rten brtsegs pa'i rnam pa 'dra ba dang*)—these are not literal deities but recognition-display modes (*rnam pa*) describing awareness's capacity to manifest as five wisdom-families (*ye shes lnga*). The gnad: Padma, emptiness-possessing (*pad+ma stong ldan gyi rnam pa*) seeing (*mthong bas*), arising's, bonds, liberated (*'byung ba lnga'i 'ching byed las 'das pa'o*)—this establishes that when recognition (*mthong ba*) sees emptiness (*stong ldan*), the five arisings naturally liberate without needing to cut bonds (*'ching*). These (*de dag kyang gcig skyes gcig 'gags pas nyams zhes bya'o*)—recognition sees the five families as one arsing (*gcig skyes*), not separate entities (*'gags*). Risk of deity-reification: treating "five families" as external deities rather than recognition-display modes.>

[5160-5170] <sngar-dbang>
<The sngar dbang (*sngar dbang*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side* for practitioners who benefit from structured practice. Also (*de yang snga ma bas khyad par du 'gyur bas gong 'phel zhes bya'o*)—this indicates that distinguishing (*khyad par 'gyur*) from previous (*snga ma*) causes separation (*gong 'phel*). The statement that therefore, recognition, arising (*de ltar rig pas byung ba ni*)—establishes that recognition (*rig pa*) is the cause (*las*) of arising (*byung*). The instruction that sngar dbang, (*sngar dbang rim pas bsten pa las*)—this is provisional method for recognizing arsing. The gnad: arising (*byung ba ni*) is not something created but recognized through appearance's teaching (*gnyis pa snang tshul*). Risk of technicism: treating "sngar dbang" as ritual technique rather than recognition-framework.>

[5170-5185] <appearance-separation>
<The appearance-separation (*snang ba*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for structured path. Also (*mdor na*), appearance's experience (*snang nyams rnams*) wisdom-lamp, five-color's (*ye shes lnga'i kha dog gi snang ba dang*) expanse's appearance, two (*dbyings kyi snang ba gnyis su 'dus pa'o*)—this indicates that recognition's experience includes both wisdom-lamp display and expanse's display appearing together (*gnyis su 'dus*). Separating (*gong 'phel ni*)—this is the provisional instruction to analyze appearance's components. All, excellent-ugly-many (*snang ba de dag je bkra je legs je mang la song ba ste*)—this describes how recognition perceives display as various qualities appearing (*song ba*). Risk of object-reification: treating "five-color's display" as objects rather than recognition's luminous quality.>

[5170-5185] <appearance-dividing>
<The appearance-dividing teaching operates from *instructional provisionality* for structured recognition. Appearance's teaching (*gnyis pa snang tshul gyis*) dividing (*bye brag tu bshad pa la*)—this indicates that appearance is analyzed through teaching into separate components. Wisdom-lamp (*ye shes lnga'i kha dog gi snang ba dang*)—this refers to wisdom's five-color display as light (*'od*). Dibs's (*dbyibs kyi snang ba gnyis las*)—this indicates two modes of appearance: wisdom-lamp and affliction (*dang po ni*). The analysis: Vajra's, completely-pure (*rdo rje'i rigs rnam par dag pas*), fire, long-lata, seeing (*me long lta bu'i ye shes kyi rang 'od kha dog dkar po'i rnam par 'char ba dang*)—this describes how recognition (*mthong ba*) sees (*lta bu*) wisdom's self-resonance (*rang 'od*) as white (*dkar po*), appearing as completely pure (*rnam par dag*) like fire (*me*) and long-lata (*long*). Risk of appearance-reification: treating "fire" and "long-lata" as external objects rather than recognition-metaphors.>

[5175-5190] <awareness-body>
<The awareness-body (*rig pa sku*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The instruction that ground, resting, inward (*gnas skabs su phyir snang 'phel zhing tshad la phebs nas*)—this is *upāya* for recognition to settle into ground (*gzhi*) with inward (*nang du*) placement. The statement that self-resonance, ground, abiding (*rang gdangs gzhi thim la nang du bzlog pas phyir gsal du zad dgos te*)—this establishes that self-resonance abides in ground, abiding (*gzhi thim*), and through inward resting (*nang du bzlog*), clarity-emptiness (*gsal*) exhausts (*zad*). The final statement: spontaneous (*lhun grub ka dag gi dbyings su thim dgos pa'i phyir ro*)—definitively establishes that awareness-body and wisdom-lamp spontaneously rest in expanse. Risk of kāya reification: treating "awareness-body" as metaphysical entity rather than recognition's display mode.>

[5177-5185] <five-families-resting>
<The five-families teaching (*rigs dang rigs kyi khyad par las byung ba'o*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *rigpa-side* for practitioners who benefit from structured understanding. Therefore wisdom's wind (*rlung*) completely (*rnam par dag pa*) sees recognition's appearance (*snang ba*) as looking at it (*me long lta bu'i*)—this indicates that recognition's resting causes wisdom to see its own display directly. The instruction that depending on (*brten nas*), recognition's experience (*nyams*) spontaneously arises (*'phel 'byung ba'o*)—this establishes that recognition-experience is not something caused but arises naturally from dependence. The gnad that ordinary mind's arm extends (*mnyam pa nyid kyi rtsibs shar du snang ba ni*) recognition—this indicates that when recognition rests, ordinary mind's grasping (*rtsibs*) naturally extends toward it. Risk of five-families reification: treating "five families" as external deities rather than recognition-display modes.>

[5185-5195] <demonstration>
<The demonstration (*tshul gyis spyir bstan pa*) teaching operates as *instructional provisionality* for practitioners who benefit from structured teaching. Appearance, from (*snang tshul gyis*), dividing (*bye brag tu bshad pa la*)—this indicates that appearance is analyzed through demonstration (*spyir bstan*) into separate divisions (*bye brag tu*). Suffering (*dang po ni*), samsara's bonds, from (*'khor ba'i bcings pa las*)—liberation-method (*grol tshul dang*), destroying (*sbyar na*)—this describes that liberation-method is applied to samsara's bonds (*bcings*). Risk of method-concretization: treating "liberation-method" as technique rather than recognition of what was never bound.>

[5185-5195] <vision-clarity>
<The vision-clarity teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Therefore (*de nyid rdo rje mi bskyod pa'i gdangs dkar ba la 'tsher bar 'char ba'o*)—this establishes that Vajra (*rdo rje*) not disturbing (*mi bskyod pa*) white (*dkar ba*) self-resonance (*gdangs*) arises (*'char ba*) as clarity. The gnad: that's (*de'i 'og tu*)—delusion (*de bzhin gshegs pa'i rigs rnam par dag pas*), Dharmata's, expanse (*chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes kha dog mthing ga'i rnam par 'char ba dang*)—within delusion (*'og tu*), the five wisdoms appear as Dharmata's expanse (*chos kyi dbyings*). The statement that appearance, completely-destroyed (*rnam par snang mdzad kyi gdangs mthing la gnag par 'char ro*)—this indicates that when delusion is destroyed (*snang mdzad*), appearance's clarity (*gdangs mthing*) destroys (*gnag par*) as black (*'char ro*). Risk of color-reification: treating "white" and "black" as colors rather than recognition-metaphors for clarity and obscurity.>

[5185-5195] <delusion-exhaustion>
<The delusion-exhaustion teaching (*'khrul pa'i snang ba zad du*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. The statement that all (*nye ba*) wisdom's (*nyid do*)—this is *upāya* for practitioners: delusion and wisdom are not separate entities; delusion is exhausted (*zad*). The gnad that therefore cognition gathers (*de nas so sor rtog pa'i gru chad du snang ba ni*)—this indicates that when recognition arises, cognition (*sor rtog pa*) gathers (*gru*) completely (*chad du*) recognition's appearance (*snang ba*). The teaching that arising's precious qualities time (*byung ba'i phra ba 'gag pa'i dus so*)—this is provisional describing how precious qualities (*'gag pa*) manifest over time (*dus so*). Risk of exhaustion-reification: treating "delusion-exhaustion" as gradual achievement rather than recognition of what was never established.>

[5190-5200] <inner-clear-light>
<The inner clear-light (*nang gsal*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The statement that inner clear-light (*nang gsal du rang 'od kyi klong na*) awareness-body (*rig pa sku*) and wisdom-lamp's (*ye shes kyi pho brang*) self-abiding, spontaneity without (*ye bzhugs lhun grub chen por 'pho 'gyur med pa'o*)—this establishes that recognition's inner clear-light is awareness-body and wisdom-lamp abiding together, without arising or cessation (*'pho 'gyur med pa*). The statement that therefore (*des na*)—in this (*'dir*), appearance's experience, main (*snang ba'i nyams gtso ba ste*)—indicates that the main teaching on appearance's experience is the inner clear-light resting. Risk of spatialization: treating "inner clear-light" as some subtle location rather than recognition's self-knowing quality.>

[5193-5200] <cognition-cutting>
<The cognition-cutting teaching (*de nas so sor rtog pa'i me tog gi tshom bur 'char ba ni*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *sems-side*. Therefore cognition (*sor rtog pa*) cutting (*me tog gi*) off (*bur*) appearance (*'char ba ni*)—this is provisional teaching for detaching from conceptual cognition. The gnad that wisdom's skillful spelling liberates (*de kha dog rab tu spel legs pa las byung ba'o*)—this indicates that wisdom's precise analysis (*rab tu spel legs pa*) causes liberation (*las byung ba*). Risk of cognition-objectification: treating "cognition" as some separate entity to eliminate rather than recognition of its self-nature.>

[5195-5210] <grasping-tremor>
<The grasping-tremor (*'dod chags*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Appearance, also (*snang ba de yang*), going (*gyen 'greng dang*), separating (*rtsibs shar dang*), destroyed (*gru chad dang*), pot (*dum bu dang*)—this describes how recognition perceives grasping (*'dod chags*) as causing (*phyir*) various destructive appearances: going away (*gyen 'greng*), separating (*rtsibs shar*), destroying (*gru chad*), like pot breaking (*dum bu*). People's appearance (*snam bu'i snang ba dang*)—this is *upāya* describing how appearance is perceived by ordinary people. The statement that wisdom-lamp (*lnga rdzogs pas*) five-color's, attaining (*ye shes lnga'i kha dog la dbang thob nas*)—establishes that wisdom-lamp attains (*dbang thob nas*) five-color's display. The analysis: grasping (*'dod chags*), trembling (*zhe sdang dang*), fear (*gti mug dang*), suffering (*nga rgyal dang*)—these are the tremors (*sdang*) and sufferings (*nga*) of grasping (*'dod chags*). Risk of emotion-reification: treating "fear" and "suffering" as metaphysical states rather than descriptions of delusory experience.>

Mnyam pa (*mnyam pa nyid kyi kha dog ser po'i snam bu dang*)—this describes the Mnyam pa (Akshobhya) family as red (*ser po*) wisdom. Rin Che's (*rin po che 'byung ldan gyi gdangs rab tu 'tsher ba*)—this indicates that the Amoghasiddhi (*rin po che*) family's self-resonance (*gdangs*) shines (*'tsher ba*) as gold (*gser zhun*). Dust (*sbyangs pa lta bur 'char ro*)—this describes the dust that obscures recognition (*lta bu*). The citation from Padma (*pad+ma'i rigs rnam par dag pa las*)—delusion (*so sor rtog pa'i ye shes kyi kha dog dmar po'i snam bu dang*)—this indicates that delusion's wisdom appears as red (*dmar po*) people (*snam bu*). Risk of substantialism: treating "five families" as metaphysical entities rather than recognition-display modes.>

[5195-5204] <recognition-wisdom>
<The recognition-wisdom teaching (*bya ba grub pa'i re lde'i rnam pa tsam du snang ba ni*) operates as *instructional provisionality* from *rigpa-side*. Arising (*bya ba*) established (*grub pa*) emptiness (*stong ldan gyi*) recognition's appearance (*rnam pa*)—this is provisional teaching that recognition appears as wisdom (*re lde*). The gnad that wisdom's self-resonance completely shines (*ye shes kyi rang gdangs so sor gsal ba las byung ba'o*)—this establishes that wisdom (*ye shes*) is awareness's (*rig pa*) own self-resonance (*rang gdangs*) that shines (*gsal ba*) spontaneously (*las byung ba*). The statement that therefore dharmata's wisdom from space displays (*de nas chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes mkhar thab tu 'char ba ni*)—this indicates that dharmata's wisdom (*chos kyi dbyings ye shes*) appears as space's (*mkhar thab*) display (*'char ba*).

The gnad: (*gzigs*) looking (*stangs las*) establishes (*grus pa*) and (*byung ba*)—this indicates that recognition's "looking" (*gzigs*) is the key: seeing recognition's own appearance. The gnad that therefore dharmata's wisdom object gathering recognition (*de nas chos kyi dbyings kyi ye shes yul gru tsam du snang ba ni*)—this indicates that dharmata's wisdom (*chos kyi dbyings*) object (*yul*) gathering (*gru tsam du*) recognition (*snang ba ni*)—this is provisional describing recognition's relationship to dharmata.

The gnad that therefore action of appearance recognition going liberates (*de las dra bar snang ba ni sngon du 'gro ba tshad du phyin pa las byung ba'o*)—this is the key: when action (*las*) is applied to appearance (*dra bar*), recognition (*snang ba ni*) going into (*sngon 'gro*) recognition (*tshad du phyin pa*) liberates (*las byung ba*). Risk of accumulation-reification: treating "six accumulations" as metaphysical entities rather than recognition-descriptions of experience modes.>

The gnad: recognition sees and rests (*rig pa mig nas drangs pa las*)—this indicates that recognition (*rig pa*) looks into (*mig*) and rests (*drangs pa*) through which it arises (*las byung*). This is not gradual stabilization but direct recognition of awareness's nature. The statement that therefore za 'ogur khyim lta bu ni sngon 'gro dag par byas pa las byung ba'o*—establishes that when recognition rests, appearance (*snang ba*) becomes like looking at (*lta bu*) za 'ogur (hermit) that goes (*sngon 'gro dag*) doing (*byas pa*). Risk of reification: treating "recognition-resting" as technique rather than awareness's own capacity to recognize.>

<The pot-breaking (*phrag dong lnga*) teaching operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. Seeing (*mngon du rgyu ba'i bcings pa las grol te*)—this is the definitive instruction: recognition sees through the bonds (*bcings pa*) that arise from grasping. The statement that bag, not-existing, not-attaining (*bag la nyal tsam ma gtogs pa med pas*)—establishes that recognition's recognition (*mngon du*) is so subtle that grasping (*'dod chags*) falls (*nyal*) without truly existing or being attainable. The gnad that samsara's liberation, definite (*'khor ba'i phyed las 'das pa nyid do*)—this is definitive: samsara never truly existed to liberate from. Risk of visualization-interpretation: treating "pot-breaking" as visual technique rather than recognition-metaphor for delusion's collapse.>

Therefore (*de dag gi phyi rim mthing ga rdo rje'i ra bas kun nas bskor ba ni*)—this establishes that from precious (*rin po che*) ground (*ra*) recognition surrounds (*bskor ba*) awareness (*ye shes*) completely (*kun nas*). Wisdom (*ye shes de dag tha dad pa ma yin par mtshon pa'o*)—these five wisdoms are not separate (*tha dad pa*) but appear as not-existing (*ma yin par*) recognition.

Self-nature (*rang bzhin*) unmodified (*ma bcos pa*) arises (*las byung ba*)—this definitively establishes that recognition's self-nature is uncaused and arises spontaneously. This is not gradual cultivation (*ma bcos pa*) but natural unfolding (*las byung ba*). Risk of self-nature reification: treating "self-nature" as something to cultivate rather than recognition's uncaused quality.>
