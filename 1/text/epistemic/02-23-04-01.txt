<Masterful analysis:
The piercing from one's own heart center into their heart center demonstrates the connection (*'brel pa*) of self-display (*rang gdangs*)—like crystal lights' rays connecting to crystal. This is definitive Dzogchen: the apparent "other" is not separate but connected through awareness's self-radiance. At that time, seeing one's own eye-rays (*mig gi zer thag*)—knowing is captured (*shes pa zin*), and one naturally abides in non-conceptual meditation (*yul gang du'ang mi rtog pa'i bsam gtan*) without thought toward any object. This is not "meditation" as technique but recognition of natural abiding (*rang bzhin gyis gnas pa*). The "eye-rays" are not physical phenomena but the radiance of awareness (*rig pa'i gdangs*) extending without obstruction; "piercing" indicates non-dual recognition, not spatial penetration. The Dzogchen view: there was never any separation between "one's heart" and "their heart"—both are modalities of single awareness-display.>

<Masterful analysis:
The third instruction showing non-reversal (*mi ldog pa'i gdams ngag*)—at that time, five light-rays coiled without touching the five-fold conjunction, like five horse-spokes coiled—presents sophisticated recognition technique. First: rigpa entering light (*rig pa 'od la 'jug pa*)—when looking outward at self-appearance, place in the state of knowing those appearances as self-appearance. As those appearances dissolve through rays into one's own heart center, this is called "light entering rigpa" (*'od rig pa la 'jug pa*). Risk of technicism: treating this as mechanical procedure of "absorbing light" rather than recognition that appearance has never been other than awareness. The instruction: "external lights like armor-plates dissolving into one's own rigpa's heart center, entering the lap like"—this is metaphor, not anatomy. "Dharmata mixing, liberated in primordial purity's ground" (*chos nyid du 'dres pas ka dag gi sa la grol ba*)—the definitive point: dissolution is not process but recognition of non-duality. The appearances (*snang ba*) dissolve not into a location but into their own nature as awareness.>
