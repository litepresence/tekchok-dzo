<The *Thal 'Gyur* (Penetration of Sound) citation on speech training (*ngag bslab pa*)—"Speech is trained (*ngag ni bslab*), abides (*gnas pa*), and la bzla is stabilized (*la bzla brtan par bya*)"—presents graduated *upāya* for practitioners whose predominant pattern is speech/desire (bird-type). The four phases constitute a precise pedagogical progression: (1) Training (*bslab pa*): first reduce speaking, cutting ordinary conversation (*tha mal gyi gtam smra ba bcad pa*), beginning with short sessions (*thun chung ngu*) then extending to longer periods (*de nas ring du bslab*); even when no occasion for speaking, speak only one word (*skabs su smra rgyu med kyang gcig pu smra'o*). (2) Abiding (*gnas pa*): do not reject mantras and virtuous speech (*sngags dang brjod pa la sogs pa dge ba'i brjod pa mi dgag*), yet do not mix even a single syllable with others (*gzhan dang tshig 'bru gcig kyang mi 'dre'o*). (3) Recitation (*la bzla*): all mantra-recitation and expressions cease (*sngags la sogs pa brjod pa thams cad mi bya*). (4) Stabilization (*brtan pa*): without speaking anything, not departing from that state (*ci yang mi brjod pa'i ngang las mi 'da' bar byed pa*), not even using body-gestures (*lus kyi brda tsam yang mi bya*). The phrase "at this time" (*'di'i dus na*) indicates that during this process, one understands the meaning of body-signs (*lus kyi brda don go bar byed*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for gradual path practitioners. Risk of asceticism: interpreting this as value of silence itself rather than recognition-support. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "cutting speech" is not suppression but recognition that speech has never been other than awareness's self-expression.>

[4611-4616] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The *Sa bon gyi rgyud* (Seed Tantra) citation operates from definitive *rigpa-side* pointing to the ultimate nature of speech training. The citation—"Speech (*ngag*), however blocked (*ji ltar lkug pa bzhin*), without any sign-making with anyone (*su dang brda tsam nyid mi bya*), thus, whoever does this, mind's scattering and gathering self-decides (*sems kyi 'phro 'du rang chod do*)"—establishes that speech-training ultimately reveals the self-liberated nature of mind. The phrase "scattering and gathering" (*'phro 'du*) refers to mind's ordinary movement of thought: scattering outward (*'phro*) toward objects and gathering inward (*'du*) as mental engagement. The phrase "self-decides" (*rang chod do*) means that this movement naturally self-resolves, not through suppression but through recognition that movement and stillness are not truly separate. The reference to "however blocked" (*ji ltar lkug pa*) indicates that the method of blocking speech is provisional; the definitive point is that speech's nature has never needed blocking. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*): the recognition that speech, thought, and awareness are one nature (*ngo bo gcig*). Risk of essentializing non-speech: treating "silence" as ultimate state rather than recognizing that speech itself is awareness-display. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "sign-making" (*brda tsam*) refers to all dualistic conceptualization; "without any sign-making" means recognizing beyond all concepts, not literal absence of communication.>

[4617-4625] [TANTRIC TRANSFORMATIVE VIEW]
<The progression from speech-training to body-training to mind-training represents tantric subtle body methodology leading toward Dzogchen recognition. The elaborate description of training effects operates as *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners who benefit from gradual path. The first effect—through cutting speech (*ngag gi smra ba bcad pa*), the unspeakable meaning (*brjod du med pa'i don*) arises in the continuum (*rgyud la skye ste*)—indicates that meaning transcends expression not because speech stops but because recognition realizes the unspeakable nature of all expression. The second effect—through not mixing speech with others (*'gro ba gzhan dang ngag ma 'dres pa*), body is trained (*lus 'byongs pa'i dgos pa yod*)—establishes the necessity of body training: without body-training, buddhas and bodhisattvas cannot bless (*sangs rgyas dang byang chub sems dpa' ... byin gyis brlabs nas*). Body becomes trained as illusory body liberated (*lus sgyu ma'i skur grol*), indicating that the body recognized as illusion-display. The third effect—through cutting expressed-objects (*brjod bya bkag pa*), speech is trained (*ngag 'byongs*), and signs appear: meeting with non-human guides (*rtags su mi ma yin pa rnams dang brda phrad cing*), communication with unseen beings (*gtam zer ba dag 'ong*)—describes tantric accomplishment (*dngos grub*) progression. The fourth effect—through cutting speech-expression (*ngag gi brjod pa bkag pa*), mind is trained (*yid 'byongs*), with signs: previously unseen non-human forms appear (*sngon du mi ma yin gyi gzugs mthong ba*), then clairvoyance (*mngon par shes pa*) dawns piece by piece (*dum bu pa 'char ro*)—completes the threefold training trajectory. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of accomplishment-seeking: treating these "signs" and "accomplishments" as goals rather than recognition-confirmations. The Dzogchen view recognizes that all these "attainments" are self-liberation-display (*rang grol) of awareness, not new acquisitions.>

[4626-4631] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The crucial instruction on cutting body-mind connection (*lus sems kyi 'brel gcod pa*) through speech-gnad operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The mind-gnad instruction: gaze into the expanse of space (*nam mkha'i mthongs su mig lta ba*) without thinking anything (*rtog pa ci yang ma bsam*). This is not spatial gazing but recognition of awareness's own expanse (*dbyings*). The *Thal 'Gyur* citation—"Mind (*sems*) is accomplished (*'grub*) through placing (*gtad pa*) in expanse (*dbyings la*)"—provides definitive pointing: mind's accomplishment is not attainment of new state but recognition of its nature as expanse. The phrase "placing" (*gtad pa*) does not mean fixing or forcing but allowing recognition to settle naturally. The definitive integration: when body and speech are controlled (*gtso bo lus ngag gnyis gcun pas*), mind naturally follows (*sems zhor la 'chun nas*), space-rigpa dawns (*dbyings rig 'char zhing*), and element-bonds sever (*khams su gyi 'ching ba gcod de*). This establishes that all training (body, speech, mind) is ultimately preparation for recognition: when gross activity (body) and verbal activity (speech) settle, mind naturally reveals itself as space-rigpa awareness (*dbyings rig*). The phrase "space-rigpa" (*dbyings rig*) is crucial: it indicates that awareness (*rig pa*) and its display as expanse (*dbyings*) are inseparable. Risk of meditative-absorption misunderstanding: treating "placing mind in expanse" as meditative absorption state rather than direct recognition of awareness's nature. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "element-bonds severing" (*khams su gyi 'ching ba gcod*) refers to recognizing that elements were never truly binding; the severing is recognition of self-liberation, not elimination of something real. The citation from *Sa bon gyi rgyud* continues the definitive pointing.>

[4632-4638] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The citations establishing the threefold training structure operate within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The opening statement—"Training body, speech, and mind (*lus ngag gsum gcun pa*), becoming accustomed to dharmata's appearance (*chos kyi dbyings kyi snang ba la*), thus one becomes accustomed (*'di yis goms par 'gyur ba yin*)"—indicates that through systematic training, one habituates to recognizing awareness's own display. The second citation—"Knowing the gnad of body, speech, and mind (*lus dang ngag dang yid kyi gnad shes shing*) and applying it (*bstun pas*), one liberates from cyclic existence (*'khor las grol*)"—establishes that knowledge (*shes pa*) must be coupled with application (*bstun pa*) for liberation. These citations from tantric sources operate as *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners who benefit from structured path methodology. The phrase "dharmata's appearance" (*chos kyi dbyings kyi snang ba*) indicates that dharmata is not a hidden essence but the very appearance of experience when recognized. Risk of gradual path essentializing: treating the threefold training as necessary stages rather than recognition-facilitating conditions. The Dzogchen view recognizes that body, speech, and mind are not truly separate entities but display-modes of single awareness; the training points to recognizing what has always been present, not attaining something new.>

[4639-4645] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The definitive statement about the second purpose (*don gnyis pa*)—placing on one's own threshold (*rang thog tu dbab pa*) the three gnads (*gnad gsum la brten nas*) for direct recognition (*mngon sum*)—operates from definitive *rigpa-side*. The threefold structure of direct recognition: (1) Binding the three gnads in vajra constraint (*gnad gsum rdo rje'i chings su bsdams pa*); (2) Giving the self-face of direct recognition (*mngon sum rig pa'i rang ngo sprad pa*); (3) Showing the mode of appearance from that (*de las snang ba'i 'char tshul bstan pa*). This establishes that direct recognition requires precise preparation: the "vajra constraint" (*rdo rje'i chings*) refers to the unbreakable nature of the three gnads when properly understood; "self-face" (*rang ngo*) refers to recognition of awareness's own face without mediation; "mode of appearance" (*'char tshul*) refers to how awareness-display naturally manifests from recognition. The subdivision of the first binding into two aspects: showing the general constraint of the three gnads (*gnad gsum spyi'i chings bstan pa*) and placing on one's own individual gnad (*bye brag rang gi gnad thog tu dbab pa*)—indicates that understanding the general principle must be followed by personal application. Risk of methodology reification: treating "vajra constraint" as fixed method rather than metaphorical description of recognition's unshakeable nature. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "direct recognition" (*mngon sum*) refers to recognizing awareness's self-knowledge, not external perception of something.>

[4646-4668] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The detailed explanation of the three gnads—door (*sgo*), object (*yul*), and wind-rig (*rlung rig*)—operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The *Thal 'Gyur* citation establishes: "The three gnads should not be separated from secret instruction" (*gnad gsum man ngag 'bral mi bya*)—they are door, object, and wind-rig gnads. The metaphorical elaboration: door-gnad is like a guard (*so pa*), object-gnad is like a guest (*'gron po*), wind-rig gnad is like a butcher (*jag pa*). The functional description: door-gnad makes seeing happen (*sgo'i gnad kyis mthong bar byed*), object-gnad makes unchanging (*yul gyi gnad kyis mi 'gyur bar byed*), wind-rig gnad places signs onto measure (*rlung rig gi gnad kyis rtags tshad la 'bebs pa*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). The analogy with lethal points (*dper na gnad la zin pa'i mtshon dang 'dra ste*): just as striking a vital point (*lus kyi rtsa rgyus sam don snying la sogs pa'i gnad la phog na*) makes one feel nothing regardless of activity (*ci byas kyang mi 'tshor bar 'chi ba dang 'dra bar*), so the three gnads transform one into dharmata—not gradually but instantly (*chos nyid la 'gyur ba'i sa med*). The necessity of all three: without object-gnad, no basis for support (*yul med na rten sa'i gzhi med*); without door-gnad, losing path of going (*sgo med na 'gro ba'i lam stor*); without wind-rig gnad, awareness does not resolve inward (*rlung rig gi gnad med na shes rig nang du mi chod pa*). Therefore these three are definite (*gnad gsum du nges la*): not more (*de las mang na*)—infinite would lose the gnad (*mtha' yas pas gnad stor la*); not fewer (*nyung na*)—purpose would not be accomplished (*don mi 'grub pa*). Risk of anatomical literalism: treating "door," "object," and "wind-rig" as anatomical structures rather than recognition-coordinates. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these three gnads are not entities but modes of recognition: door refers to how awareness perceives, object refers to what awareness perceives, wind-rig refers to the energetic dimension of awareness.>

[4669-4672] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The second subdivision—placing on one's own individual gnad (*bye brag rang gi gnad thog tu dbab pa*)—operates from definitive *rigpa-side* as direct introduction. This subdivision contains two aspects: determining the general order of the three gnads (*gnad gsum spyi'i rim pa nges pa*) and placing on each individual gnad (*so so'i gnad la thog tu dbab pa*). The phrase "general order" (*spyi'i rim pa*) indicates the sequential recognition process, but the Dzogchen view recognizes that in actual recognition, all three gnads operate simultaneously, not sequentially. The phrase "determining" (*nges pa*) means recognizing definitively that these three are necessary and sufficient, not tentatively considering them. The phrase "placing on each individual gnad" (*so so'i gnad la thog tu dbab pa*) refers to direct application of each gnad in one's own experience: not theoretical understanding but experiential recognition. The opening of this section—"body, speech, and mind unmoving (*lus ngag sems gsum mi 'gul zhing*) and controlling door, object, and wind-rig (*sgo dang yul dang rlung rig gcun pa*)"—establishes the state for applying the gnads: when gross activity of body, speech, and mind settles, the subtle gnads become accessible. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*): the recognition that awareness is not achieved through controlling the gnads but through recognizing that the gnads are awareness's own display. Risk of sequentialization: treating the "general order" as temporal sequence rather than pedagogical presentation. The Dzogchen view recognizes that body, speech, and mind "unmoving" (*mi 'gul*) does not mean physical immobilization but resting in awareness without grasping at activity.>

[4673-4688] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The citations establishing the necessity of oral transmission and subtle body practice operate within *ordinary cognition* (*sems*) pedagogical framework. The *Rang byung rig pa'i tantra* (Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra) citation—"Thus, by thoroughly pressing all body-points etc. (*de ltar lus la sogs pa yi gnad kun rab tu gzir ba yis*), rigpa itself directly (*rig pa nyid dang mngon sum du*)—known from guru's oral transmission (*bla ma'i lung las shes pa yin*)"—establishes that gnad-pressing (*gnad gzir*) is not mere technique but preparation for direct recognition through authentic lineage. The *Thal 'Gyur* elaboration—"Actual basis relied upon in one's continuum (*dngos gzhi rang gi rgyud bsten na*), body-point and speech and mind-point relied upon (*lus kyi gnad dang ngag dang yang sems kyi gnad la brten pa yis*), wind somehow made slow (*rlung ni ci nas dal byas te*), excellently projected (*rab tu 'phang pa*), from this body and mind's connection severed (*lus dang sems kyi 'brel chad de*), not reversing even in three realms (*khams gsum du yang zlog pa min*)"—describes the mechanics of subtle body practice (*rtsa rlung thig le*) within Dzogchen context. This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*) for practitioners who benefit from physical-energetic preparation. Risk of subtle body reification: treating "pressing gnads" and "making wind slow" as manipulations rather than recognition-facilitating conditions. The Dzogchen view recognizes that "body-mind connection severed" does not mean eliminating connection but recognizing that they were never truly separate; "not reversing in three realms" indicates that recognition transcends samsara/nirvana duality.>

[4689-4692] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – RIGPA SIDE]
<The concise definition of the three gnads operates from definitive *rigpa-side* pointing to recognition. The statement—"Door is three-kaya eyes seeing (*sgo ni sku gsum mig gis blta*), object is free from obscurations (*yul ni sgrib byed bral ba'o*), slow wind-rigpa accomplishes wisdom (*rlung rig dal bas ye shes 'grub*)"—provides definitive recognition-coordinates: (1) Door (*sgo*) refers to the three kayas as the three ways awareness sees itself—not external forms to visualize but awareness's own display as trikaya; (2) Object (*yul*) refers to whatever is perceived being free from obscurations (*sgrib byed bral ba*)—not that objects lack veils but that recognition sees all appearances as already free; (3) Slow wind-rigpa (*rlung rig dal ba*) refers to the natural settled state of subtle energy (*rlung*) and awareness (*rig pa*) when not agitated by dualistic grasping, which naturally accomplishes wisdom (*ye shes 'grub*). The phrase "slow" (*dal ba*) indicates natural settling, not forced suppression. This is *declarative finality* (*nges don*). Risk of threefold essentializing: treating "door," "object," and "wind-rig" as separate entities to master rather than recognition-aspects of single awareness. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these three are not sequential: the "door" is awareness seeing, the "object" is what awareness sees (which is itself), and "slow wind" is the natural state of awareness's energy. All three point to the same recognition: awareness is self-arisen, self-displayed, and self-liberated.>

[4693-4695] [ORDINARY COGNITION]
<The detailed instruction on door-gnad—the first of the three gnads—operates within *ordinary cognition* pedagogical framework. The opening statement: ordinary seeing-mode (*tha mal pa'i lta lugs*) does not dawn wisdom (*ye shes mi 'char bas*), therefore train in three-kaya seeing-modes (*sku gsum gyi gzigs stang gsum la bslab*). This establishes that ordinary perception is not wrong but incomplete for recognition; the three-kaya seeing-modes are not new ways to see but recognition of how awareness has always seen. The *Dpal nam mkha' dang mnyam pa'i rgyud* (Glorious Space-Equal Tantra) citation describes three kayas' functions: (1) Dharmakaya seeing-mode (*chos kyi sku yi gzigs stangs*)—pressing the three realms' samsara (*khams gsum 'khor ba spyibs na 'don*), meaning seeing all samsara as already pressed into dharmata; (2) Sambhogakaya (*longs sku*)—samsara's basis not destroyed (*srid pa'i gzhi ma 'jig*), indicating that recognition sees without destroying appearances; (3) Nirmanakaya (*sprul sku*)—liberating into buddha-fields (*sangs rgyas zhing du sgrol*), indicating manifestation-liberation. Additional citations: *Yi ge med pa* (Scripture Without Letters): "Eye is examined in space-element" (*mig ni nam mkha'i khams su brtag*), indicating that the eye itself is examined as space-expanse; *Gsang ba sgra rgyud* (Secret Sound Tantra): three seeing-modes—casting down, turning back, and glancing (*phab dang zlog dang zur gyis ni gzigs stangs rnam pa gsum du grags*). This is *instructional provisionality* (*drang don*). Risk of visualization misunderstanding: treating "three-kaya seeing" as visualizations of forms to see rather than recognition of awareness's own seeing. The Dzogchen view recognizes that these "modes" are not sequential practices but descriptions of how recognition sees: all three kayas are simultaneously present in recognition.>
