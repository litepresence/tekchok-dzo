[14825-14829] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – GRADUAL CERTAINTY]
<That self-appearance known, gradually certainty obtained—seven. Twenty-one kadag liberated, not-yet-dissolved between, emanation spread, kadag dissolved. The enumeration of seven stages and twenty-one moments is instructional provisionality, describing the process of recognition for those who require gradual unfolding. Risk of temporalization: mistaking these numerical markers as ontological realities rather than pedagogical scaffolding for practitioners of varying capacities. The view remains Dzogchen—primordially complete—but the path accommodates gradual recognition.>

[14829-14842] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – MOMENT-MEDITATION EQUIVALENCE]
<Twenty-one moments equal, but meditation's days many-few exist, senses sharp-dull placed. Those days moments joined, senses' appearance-mode and days' enumeration, emanation's division manner different. From Self-Arisen: some white color liberated, some yellow color liberated, some red color liberated, some green color liberated, some blue color liberated, some five colors liberated, some bindu light liberated—that is final liberation manner. The various colors and bindus indicate different recognition modes, not hierarchical stages. Final liberation manner is definitive—each path leads to the same recognition.>

[14843-14848] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – FINAL LIBERATION MODE]
<Final senses' liberation manner thus: final ground obtained—fourteen days taken. That is final ground. The specification of fourteen days for the final ground serves as a temporal marker for the completion of recognition. Risk of elitism: creating hierarchies of practitioners based on time-to-recognition rather than understanding that all recognition is equally primordial.>

[14867-14876] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SPONTANEOUS PRESENCE STABILITY]
<Spontaneous presence three days abiding, final self-appearance seen, stability obtained. Emanation also fifty days benefit can do. Final medium: nineteen days taken, also cluster twelve days, four wisdoms abide. Those beings' senses all Buddha's ground conquered. Those bardos also dream-like. Final natural emanation born, here liberation's class explained. These senses' liberation manner—great importance, should know. The temporal markers (three days, fifty days, nineteen days) describe the duration of recognition stability, not mandatory practice periods. Risk: reading these as required meditation durations rather than descriptions of how recognition unfolds spontaneously.>

[14877-14886] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – BARDO DREAM-LIKE NATURE]
<General meaning four: existence's bardo, karma's projection continuing, precipice broken, fox inserting. Instructions two: instructions' pointing manner briefly shown, bardo's own face extensively explained. First: existence's bardo dream-like appearance, moment instantaneous objects entering, previous moments self-ceased, trace not found. Now direct-clear appearance exists, hurry-scurry wander whatever thought object moment traversing miraculous powers existing time. This gate seeing ones, bardo's self-appearance face found coming. Ten directions emanation fields mind merely done, dharmata truth's blessings there born, bardo without Buddha. The bardo is presented as dream-like and instantaneous, not as an intermediate state. Risk: reifying the bardo as a literal between-state rather than recognizing it as the present moment's opportunity for recognition.>

[14891-14899] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – REFUGE AND REBIRTH PREVENTION]
<Taking refuge and womb gate bad reversing, good selecting. From Golden Rosary: "Delusion existence's portion, self-appearance nature-lessness appearance, self-appearance nature-lessness knowing, emanation mindfulness self-liberated." The instruction to take refuge and select good rebirth is provisional—not because refuge is ultimately needed (it is not, in Dzogchen view) but because practitioners at this stage still operate within cause-effect. Risk of ritualism: mistaking these instructions as ends in themselves rather than expedient means for those not yet recognizing primordial completion.>

[14939-14953] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – INTERMEDIATE STATE VARIATIONS]
<Some god-human birth possible, some lower realms birth possible, some liberation existence called—intermediate existence. Characteristics: bardo however much abiding, upper half previous form, lower half future birth body, clothes, ornaments etc. having, thinking—dream characteristics like. Also god-human birth taken, that form; form realm born, first light body exists, thinking; formless upper birth time formless, appearance not dawning, but sky and wind merely appearance birth. Formless lower realms transferring, upper half's samadhi and wind merely self-emanated samadhi form other not, lower half future birth form dawns. The various descriptions of bardo appearance serve pedagogical purposes for different capacities. Risk: reifying these as literal descriptions of an actual place rather than skillful means pointing to recognition.>

[14971-14985] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – EMOTIONAL PROJECTION MECHANISM]
<Enemy chasing, refuge seen, hiding there mind moment attachment, birth taken. All desire realm birth mind desire-attachment surge arising, object passionate longing especially great arises. Form realm born, coarse appearance hatred, light passionate longing arises. Formless born, appearance whatever passionate longing not, nothing-at-all mind abiding merely, joy arises. Container-contained appearance also moment merely, then latency great force ceases. Here clairvoyance arising cause from what arose: dharmata seed existing, here obstructing body self-power not, dharmata above seen blessings arose. The mechanism of rebirth is presented through emotional projection—desire, hatred, and delusion driving the process. Risk of psychologization: reducing this to mere psychology rather than recognizing the ontological force of emotional latencies.>

[14997-15011] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – BARDO TEMPORAL STRUCTURE]
<Appearance's birth manner twenty this seven days completed, intermediate existence that life seven days passed ceases. Life that not? Also latency force previous appearance awakened, mind's body taken, seven times die, seven times birth appearance dream birth-death like. Seven births also miraculously born, death and birth all moment do. Virtue's power apply, seven seven seven collections done, benefit great. That also birth seven abiding appearance seven dying appearance seven—twenty-one first one, body taking duration extreme. Seven seven forty-nine days, that class karma different, body individual taken. Generally intermediate existence life short extreme seven days, long extreme forty-nine. The temporal structure (7 days, 21 moments, 49 days) is instructional scaffolding, not literal temporal physics. Risk of literalization: treating these numbers as ontological facts rather than pedagogical tools for structuring practice.>

[15033-15047] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – INTERMEDIATE KARMA]
<Intermediate karma called. Also dharmata truth seen, previous manifest karma not visible, seed exists. Here dream's own time like, intermediate karma subtle future addition merely accumulates, future karma's connection also this cause-result fruit one to one continue, samsara makes. Accumulation manner: special appearance one setting one not-born between accumulated, that force previous appearance not clear. Time consciousness previous-later between. Cause previous manifest not but subtle latency and meditation's part from. Here accumulation above dharmata forgotten, blocked from arose. Karma signs: previous karma purified seed part appearance that time, above dharmata very clear, examined; previous seed not purified, consciousness not clear, dull. Consciousness clear-not clear previous virtue-non-virtue's projection arose. Cause two: clear cause previous-latter mindfulness pure arose; not clear dharmata back turned arose. The intermediate karma operates subtly—not manifest but as latent potential. Risk of causal determinism: believing karma absolutely determines outcome rather than recognizing recognition can interrupt the chain.>

[15056-15070] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SENSES AND ELEMENTS INTERACTION]
<Senses complete unobstructed possessing three. Elements wind's action function seed from karma wind unobstructedly lifted, all looking desiring entering, unobstructed possessing; entering existence called—four. These cause from what arose: above four wisdoms' conjunction power arose. Twelve body measure: unpurified karma child about eight years, purified sixteen years body measure, dream form like, self-characteristic not. Cause spontaneous presence's dawning manner eight seen arose. Thirteen birth abode which class: womb-born, egg-born, heat-moisture-born, miraculously-born four—miraculously-born class. The interaction of senses and elements creates the conditions for rebirth. Risk of reductionism: reducing this complex process to mere mechanical causation rather than recognizing the wisdom-display nature of all appearances.>

[15089-15100] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – LOWER REALM BIRTH MECHANISM]
<Lower realms etc. born, unpleasant and poverty etc. forms meeting, thinking. Cause: dharmata attachment or hatred holding arose. Seventeen body and afflictions' connection: form self-power not but dream-like within self-form attachment arises—desire; hatred arises—form; between born—formless born. These causes dharmata truth deviated arose. Eighteen realm which class: desire, form. The mechanism of lower realm birth is presented through emotional deviation from dharmata. Risk of moralism: interpreting this as moral judgment rather than recognition of how confusion operates.>

[15122-15133] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – KARMIC OBSTRUCTION]
<Going desire also obstruction possessing, powerless. Cause: above dharmata truth mind not believing. Twenty examples: grass fire holding like, karma and latency force womb abode holding; mud swamp birth or jewel or wood etc. holding like, samsara self-rigpa's wisdom holding; bird egg holding like, father's samadhi's rtsis intermediate existence's being holding; summer's rotting flesh bees gathering like, father's samadhi's womb gate intermediate existence beings immeasurable gathered, father's bliss taste merely there birth karma possessing, powerless womb enter—mother's excrement path enters. These sun-moon union from, this scripture not accorded, beings' entering. The karmic process binds beings through habitual patterns. Risk of determinism: believing karma is absolute rather than recognizing recognition can liberate.>

[15176-15187] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – CONSCIOUSNESS CLEARNESS]
<That time consciousness' signs this. Whichever karma purified, consciousness itself clear. Those four not-purified not clear. All virtue-non-virtue karma arose. That name enumerations: these should know. Four names possessing self-nature. Existence's meat form and, illusion body smell-eater near circling, existence's intermediate existence heap-junction, formless senses complete possessing. The clarity of consciousness indicates purification; dullness indicates obscuration. Risk of substantialism: treating consciousness as a substantial entity rather than empty luminosity.>

[15239-15250] [DZOGCHEN VIEW – SIX REALMS CYCLING]
<Karma's power: joy-possessing, dispute-possessing, equal-possessing, two-possessing, hunger-possessing, great suffering possessing abodes, whirlpool-like one to one going, beings six called. From Self-Arisen: "Conceptualization samsara only, great crying abode and, extreme hunger abodes and, dull and intoxicated great abode." The six realms are presented as states of mind driven by karma, not as geographical locations. Risk of cosmological literalism: reading these as actual places rather than modes of confused consciousness.>
