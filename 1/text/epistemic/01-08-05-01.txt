<Third section (10755-10757): "primordially-pure spontaneous-accomplishment non-dual's basis own-system posit at actual-meaning, that-at dispute abandon two from, first is essence primordially-pure at spontaneous-accomplishment depth clear exist-by non-dual portion's essence primordially-pure's awareness thing characteristic not-established"—non-dual basis of primordial purity and spontaneous accomplishment, posited in own system as actual meaning; abandoning dispute from two; first, essence primordially pure, spontaneous accomplishment depth clearly existing, non-dual portion, primordially pure awareness thing characteristic not established. This is Longchenpa's own view: *ka dag lhun grub gnyis su med pa'i gzhi*—basis of non-dual primordial purity and spontaneous presence. The seven positions are all refuted as one-sided; actual basis transcends all characterizations while including all. *Rang lugs* (own system) is not eighth position but recognition that basis is beyond positions.>

[10758-10765] <non-dual-basis>
<Lines 10758-10760: Actual Dzogchen view after refutation of seven positions: "nature spontaneous-accomplishment-of clarity subtle inner-clarity-as dwell, appearance-of essence empty-to empty-of nature dwell clear essence awareness being form and primordial-wisdom primordially gather-separate not sun-of essence like dwell, essence primordially pure and nature spontaneous-by-means-of accomplish difference not accept"—nature of spontaneous accomplishment dwells as subtle inner clarity; appearance essence empty, empty nature dwells clear; essence awareness being form, primordial wisdom primordially not gathering-separating, like sun's essence; essence primordially pure, nature spontaneously accomplished, difference not accepted. This is *ngo bo ka dag, rang bzhin lhun grub*—essence primordially pure, nature spontaneously present—non-dual. Citations (10761-10765): *Rang shar* (Self-Arisen): "base-to aspect two-as said, primordially-pure great-of base and, spontaneous-accomplishment variety base-as accept"—basis has two aspects: primordially pure great basis and spontaneous accomplishment variety basis. Not contradictory but complementary.>

[10766-10773] <scriptural-synthesis>
<Lines 10766-10769: Six Spaces Tantra citation: "essence itself-to primordially-pure cause, nature-as spontaneous-accomplishment called"—essence itself primordially pure, called nature as spontaneous accomplishment. Lines 10770-10773: Mu tig phreng ba (Pearl Garland) citation: "essence primordially-pure expression base free, nature spontaneous-accomplishment whatever appear complete"—essence primordially pure, expression base free; nature spontaneous accomplishment, whatever appears complete. These establish *ka dag* and *lhun grub* as scripturally grounded, not philosophical invention. The two aspects are one basis: empty essence (*ngo bo stong pa*) and clear nature (*rang bzhin gsal ba*).>

[10774-10774] <dispute-resolution>
<Lines 10774-10779: "dispute abandon number and own-face two from, first-to dispute-answer two from, dispute, base eight-as follows called answer primordially-pure and spontaneous-accomplishment difference not accept that base seven gather cause that-from reversal not accept cause, base eight-as follows-of fault not, also own-face primordially pure thus said and not contradict"—abandoning dispute from number and own-face; dispute-answer from two; basis as eight aspects called answer; primordially pure and spontaneous accomplishment difference not accepted; seven bases gathered, reversal not accepted; no fault in basis as eight aspects; own-face primordially pure said, not contradictory. Lines 10780-10781: "essence primordially-pure-as accept cause relation is, second own-face primordially-pure and spontaneous-accomplishment difference not dispute and answer two from"—accepting essence as primordially pure is relational; second, own-face primordially pure and spontaneous accomplishment difference—not dispute and answer from two. Lines 10782-10790: Establishing dispute: each has faults; own essence primordially pure, samsara not experienced, confusion not reasonable; nature spontaneous accomplishment, effort without liberation; one substance contradiction. Answer: essence primordially pure, samsara not exist; spontaneous accomplishment power path play, not contradictory. Example (10788-10789): sleep and dream—own-face not exist in sleep, appearance as horse-ox not contradictory. Illusion play only, meaning essence not established, primordially liberated finished. This is *kun rdzob* (conventional) and *don dam* (ultimate) non-contradiction.>

<definitive-meaning>
[ACTUAL BASIS]

<The synthesis resolves seven pages of refutation. The actual basis:
1. **Essence** (*ngo bo*): primordially pure (*ka dag*)—empty, free from elaboration
2. **Nature** (*rang bzhin*): spontaneously present (*lhun grub*)—clear, manifesting
3. **Non-dual**: difference not accepted (*khyad par mi 'dod*)

This is not eighth position but definitive meaning (*nges don*) beyond all positions. The sun metaphor (10759): essence like sun's heart—radiating without gathering-separating. Dream example (10788-10789): sleep (ka dag) and dream (lhun grub) not contradictory, both depend on mind. Scriptural citations from *Rang shar*, *Klong drug pa*, *Mu tig phreng ba* establish authority. The key: ka dag and lhun grub are not separate things but *cha* (aspects) of single basis. Ka dag prevents eternalism; lhun grub prevents nihilism. Together: *spros bral gsal ba*—luminosity free from elaboration. Risk: Reifying ka dag and lhun grub as separate entities—actual meaning is non-dual (*gnyis su med pa*). Recognition sees essence-nature as inseparable (*dbyer med*).>
