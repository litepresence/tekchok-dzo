# Corpus 2: Source
# Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle

## The Foundation of All Understanding

This volume presents the source materials upon which all interpretive
layers rest. Here you will find the Tibetan text in its perfected
form, its Wylie transliteration, and a word-for-word literal rendering
that maps Tibetan grammar onto English with philological precision.

## Why Source Matters

In an age of abundant translation, the source text can seem merely a
relic—something to be moved beyond in the rush to accessibility. But
in the Tibetan tradition, the source language carries authority that
translations, however skilled, cannot fully convey.

The Tibetan Layer (*Tshad ma*) is the ground of validity for this
entire project. All interpretive layers—the Liturgical elegance, the
Commentary's pointing, the Scholar's analysis—flow from this source
and return to it for verification.

For translators, scholars, and serious students, the source materials
are not optional—they are essential.

## Three Layers of Source

**The Tibetan Layer**

The perfected Tibetan Unicode text, edited from original manuscripts
and verified against the Derge and Nyingma editions. This is the
*Tshad ma*—the source of validity—immutable and sacred.

Every character has been preserved. Every line numbered. This is
Longchenpa's words as he wrote them, digitized with fidelity for the
modern era.

**The Wylie Layer**

The *Lam*—the bridge between script and understanding. Extended Wylie
transliteration provides syllable-by-syllable parsing that enables:
- Grammatical analysis without reading Tibetan script
- Database search and computational processing
- Learning support for students of Tibetan
- Precise citation and cross-reference

Generated by pyewts with 99% accuracy, the Wylie Layer renders the
Tibetan into ASCII characters while preserving orthographic structure.

**The Literal Layer**

The *Dpyad kyi bshad pa*—analytical translation. This is not a
reading text. It is a grammatical instrument that maps Tibetan syntax
onto English with 1:1 precision.

The Literal Layer preserves:
- Tibetan word order
- Particle functions (*kyis*, *las*, *la*)
- Compound hyphenation
- Article omission
- Grammatical ambiguity

It sacrifices English fluency to expose Tibetan structure. This is
the scaffold upon which elegant translations are built.

## Collation Format

This corpus presents the three source layers collated line by line:

```
[1]
༄༅།
/theg pa'i mchog/
Supreme-Vehicle

[2]
ཐེག་པའི་མཆོག་རིན་པོ་ཆེའི་མཛོད།
/theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod/
Supreme-Vehicle Jewel-Treasury
```

Each Tibetan line is followed by its Wylie transliteration and Literal
rendering, enabling instant comparison across all three layers.

## For Whom This Corpus is Intended

**Translators**

You are rendering Longchenpa into other languages. This corpus
provides the ground truth for your work. Verify your choices against
the Literal scaffold. Reference the Tibetan for ambiguous passages.
Use the Wylie for searchable citations.

**Scholars**

You are researching Tibetan Buddhism, Nyingma doxography, or Dzogchen
philosophy. This corpus enables:
- Philological precision
- Comparative textual analysis
- Verification of published translations
- Independent scholarly work

**Students of Tibetan**

You are learning to read Tibetan. This corpus provides:
- Authentic text at appropriate difficulty
- Wylie support for character recognition
- Literal layer for grammatical understanding
- Progression from Wylie to Tibetan to meaning

**Practitioners (Secondary Use)**

While the Practitioner Corpus provides the readable liturgical text,
you may reference this corpus to:
- Verify specific translations
- Understand grammatical nuances
- Connect to Tibetan terminology
- Deepen your relationship with the source

## How to Use This Corpus

**For Translation Work:**

1. Read the Tibetan line
2. Parse with Wylie if needed
3. Check Literal for grammatical mapping
4. Compare with your own rendering
5. Resolve ambiguities by returning to Tibetan

**For Scholarly Research:**

Use the Wylie for searchable database queries. Cite the Tibetan for
academic publications. Reference the Literal for grammatical analysis.

**For Language Study:**

Work through the Tibetan line by line, using Wylie when you get stuck
and Literal to check your understanding. Gradually reduce reliance on
Wylie as your recognition improves.

## Editorial Standards

**Tibetan Layer:**
- Source: Derge edition (BDRC "BEST QUALITY / KHENPO REVIEWED")
- Verification: Comparative review with Nyingma edition
- Status: Immutable (locked February 2026)
- Line numbering: 1:1 with all other layers

**Wylie Layer:**
- Generation: pyewts (Python Extended Wylie)
- Accuracy: 99% (mechanically verified)
- Status: Preserved, not edited
- Reference only (Tibetan is truth)

**Literal Layer:**
- Generation: LLM with grammatical constraints
- Verification: 100% line count with Tibetan
- Status: Frozen (locked February 2026)
- Constraint: Zero interpretation, grammar only

## Relationship to Other Corpora

**Source → Practitioner:**
The Liturgical text (Opus 1/2) transforms the Literal scaffold into
elegant English. Every liturgical choice can be traced to this source.

**Source → Scholar:**
The Scholar Corpus (Opus 5/6) analyzes this source material. The
Epistemic and Delusion layers classify and protect readings of this
text.

**Source → Mind:**
The Cognitive layer (Opus 7/8) documents the translator's engagement
with this source material—the pre-verbal recognition before rendering.

## A Note on Imperfection

Even perfect source materials cannot prevent imperfect understanding.
The Tibetan text is authoritative, but your reading of it is always
interpretation. This is why we provide multiple layers—not to replace
the source, but to support your engagement with it.

Return to this corpus when questions arise. Verify claims against the
Tibetan. Use the tools provided. But ultimately, the realization
Longchenpa points to cannot be found in any text.

It is in your own mind.

These words merely point the way.
