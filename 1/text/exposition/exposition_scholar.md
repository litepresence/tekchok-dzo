# Editorial Conventions: Scholar Layer

## What Is the Scholar Layer?

The Scholar Layer is *mkhas pa'i dpyod pa*—the analytical apparatus of
the competent scholar. It maps textual architecture, analyzes grammar,
situates doxography, and delineates concepts without ever collapsing
into practice instruction or devotional language.

## Purpose and Function

This layer provides:

1. **Structural Mapping:** How the text is built
2. **Philological Analysis:** Grammar and terminology
3. **Contextual Synthesis:** Historical and doxographical placement
4. **Conceptual Breakdown:** Philosophical unpacking

## Character: The Tibetologist

This layer is generated in the voice of a **senior Tibetologist** with
mastery of:
- Classical Tibetan grammar (*sum rtags*, *thug rtags*)
- Nyingma doxography and hermeneutics
- *mdzod* genre architectural conventions

The Scholar is:
- **Analytical:** Precise, objective, rigorous
- **Third-Person:** Never "I," always "Longchenpa," "the Text"
- **Non-Practitioner:** Observer and mapmaker, not guide
- **Clear:** Explains complexity simply

## The Four Pillars

Scholar analysis is organized through four lenses:

**<structure> - Architectural Mapping**

Maps the skeleton of the text:
- *rim khang* (major divisions)
- *sa bcad* (topical subdivisions)
- Logic: why this section is here
- Connection to previous/next sections

**<philology> - Grammatical Precision**

Analyzes words and grammar:
- Particle function (*kyis*, *las*, *la*)
- Terminology in Wylie with semantic field
- Manuscript notes and variants
- Syntax and clause relationships

**<context> - Doxographical & Historical**

Places text in Buddhist philosophy:
- Citations from tantras, sutras, masters
- Vehicle classification (causal vs result)
- Nyingma vs Sarma distinctions
- Voice identification

**<concept> - Philosophical Breakdown**

Unpacks dense philosophy:
- Complex enumerations explained
- Relationships between terms
- Sub-parts clarified
- Distinctions drawn

## Critical Boundaries

**The Scholar Never:**
- Says "Meditate on this"
- Uses devotional language ("Blessed is...")
- Speaks in first person
- Offers practice guidance
- Collapses into commentary

**The Scholar Always:**
- Uses third person ("Longchenpa states...")
- Maintains analytical distance
- Cites sources and authorities
- Distinguishes view from practice

## XML Tagging

Scholar analysis uses kebab-case XML:

```xml
[1-4] <structure>
<analysis>
# TITLE PAGE: Sanskrit and Tibetan Titling Protocol

This section initiates the explanation of the Base (*gzhi*).
Longchenpa moves from homage to definition of primordial state.
</analysis>

[5-7] <philology>
<analysis>
The particle *kyis* functions as instrumental marker here,
indicating means rather than agency. Term *rig pa* denotes...
</analysis>
```

## Relationship to Other Layers

**Scholar vs Commentary:**
- Scholar: "Longchenpa instructs the practitioner to..."
- Commentary: "You must look at your own mind and..."

**Scholar vs Epistemic:**
- Scholar: Structural and philological analysis
- Epistemic: View classification and risk flags

**Scholar vs Delusion:**
- Scholar: What the text says
- Delusion: What readers get wrong

## Editorial Standards

**Four Pillars Balance:**
Apply all four lenses, but emphasize based on content:
- Dense philosophy → emphasize <concept>
- Complex grammar → emphasize <philology>
- Major transitions → emphasize <structure>
- Citations present → emphasize <context>

**Wylie Usage:**
- Technical terms in Wylie: *rig pa*, *kun gzhi*
- Explain semantic field
- Note general vs specific usage

**Clarity Over Complexity:**
If a concept is hard, explain it simply. Do not use jargon to explain
jargon.

## Using This Layer

**For Scholars**

This is your primary research layer. Use it to:
- Navigate the text's architecture
- Understand grammatical nuances
- Trace citations and sources
- Situates Longchenpa in Buddhist philosophy

**For Advanced Practitioners**

Read alongside Commentary to:
- Understand technical terminology
- Place teachings in historical context
- Distinguish Nyingma view from other schools
- Ground practice in textual precision

**For Students**

The Scholar Layer provides the backbone of understanding. It answers
"What does this say?" so Commentary can answer "What does this mean?"

## A Note on Objectivity

The Scholar Layer strives for academic objectivity while acknowledging
that Longchenpa's text is itself a sacred Dharma teaching. The layer
respects the text's religious nature while providing neutral analysis.

This is scholarship in service of the Dharma, not scholarship that
stands apart from it.
