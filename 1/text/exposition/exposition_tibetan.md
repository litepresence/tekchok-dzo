# Editorial Conventions: Tibetan Layer

## What Is the Tibetan Layer?

The Tibetan Layer is the *Tshad ma*—the Source of Validity—for this
entire project. It represents the perfected Tibetan Unicode text,
edited and corrected from the Raw extraction, and serves as the
absolute foundation upon which all translations and interpretations
rest.

## Status: Immutable Truth

**This layer is sacred. It is the ground. It does not change.**

Unlike all other layers in this project, the Tibetan Layer is
considered complete and final. It has been reviewed against the best
available source editions and represents the most accurate
reconstruction of Longchenpa's text possible.

## Editorial Standards

**Source Authority**

The Tibetan Layer is based on:
- The Derge edition (primary source)
- Comparative review with Nyingma edition variants
- BDRC "BEST QUALITY / KHENPO REVIEWED" designation
- Verification against oral transmission lineages

**Correction Principles**

Where the Raw Layer contained errors or unclear readings, the Tibetan
Layer applies:
- Orthographic standardization (within Tibetan conventions)
- Correction of obvious OCR errors
- Resolution of unclear passages through contextual analysis
- Preservation of meaningful variants in footnotes

**What Was Changed**

- OCR misrecognitions corrected
- Standardized spacing and punctuation
- Consistent use of standard Tibetan orthography
- Clarification of degraded passages

**What Was Preserved**

- All meaningful textual variants
- Original line structure
- Section divisions
- Editorial character of the source editions

## The Sanctity of the Source

In Tibetan Buddhist textual traditions, the source language carries
special authority. While translations open the Dharma to new audiences,
the Tibetan text remains the touchstone for all understanding.

**Principle:** All interpretive layers (Wylie, Literal, Liturgical,
Commentary) exist in service of the Tibetan Layer, not as replacements
for it.

## File Format

**Naming Convention**

Files follow the pattern: `VV-CC-SS-SS.txt`
- VV: Volume number (01 or 02)
- CC: Chapter number (01-25)
- SS: Section number (01-99)
- SS: Subsection (01-99)

**Line Numbering**

Each line is prefixed with its line number:
```
[1] ༄༅།
[2] ཐེག་པའི་མཆོག་རིན་པོ་ཆེའི་མཛོད།
```

This enables precise cross-referencing across all layers.

## Using This Layer

**For Scholars**

The Tibetan Layer serves as:
- The primary object of philological study
- The reference point for all translations
- The ground for doctrinal discussions
- The source for independent translation work

**For Practitioners**

While many practitioners will read the Liturgical and Commentary
layers, the Tibetan Layer remains:
- The ultimate authority for meaning
- The basis for memorization and recitation
- The sacred text itself

**For Translators**

This is your source. Every interpretive decision must ultimately bow
to the Tibetan Layer.

## Relationship to Other Layers

The Tibetan Layer stands as absolute truth:

Tibetan (Absolute) → Wylie (Bridge) → [All English Layers]

No English layer can override the Tibetan. Where questions arise,
return to this source.

## Verification

This layer was reviewed through:
- Automated OCR verification
- Manual scholarly review
- Comparative analysis across editions
- Oral transmission consultation

We affirm with confidence that this represents the most accurate
digital form of Longchenpa's text available.

## A Note on Authority

In creating this layer, we have followed the traditional Tibetan
editorial principle: *Tshad mar byas*—establishing valid cognition.
The Tibetan Layer is not our interpretation of Longchenpa; it is
Longchenpa's words themselves, preserved and presented with fidelity.
