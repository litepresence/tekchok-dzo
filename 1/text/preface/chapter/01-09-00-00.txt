This extensive chapter reveals **spontaneous presence** (*lhun grub*)—the dynamic display of the ground that manifests as both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Longchenpa explains how the same ground, through recognition or non-recognition, becomes either delusion or liberation.

**The Display:**
- **Spontaneous presence** (*lhun grub*): The ground's self-manifesting luminosity
- **Non-recognition** (*ma rig pa*): When presence is not recognized, it becomes delusion
- **Eight consciousnesses**: How spontaneous presence crystallizes into ordinary mind
- **Twelve links**: Dependent origination as spontaneous presence gone astray

**The Turning Point:**
> "Through the door of spontaneous presence appearance, the turning point of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is shown."

The chapter demonstrates that saṃsāra is not separate from the ground—merely the ground's display unrecognized. Liberation is not an escape but recognition of what has always been present.

**Key Contribution:** Reveals spontaneous presence as the bridge between ground and manifestation—essential for understanding how recognition transforms delusion into wisdom.
