**What Is the Vajra Essence Path?**

- **Essence** (snying po): The heart, the core, what is most essential
- **Path** (lam): The method of realization
- **Meaning**: The direct recognition of the indestructible heart of mind

**Two Aspects of the Path:**

**1. Trekchö (khregs chod) — Cutting Through:**
