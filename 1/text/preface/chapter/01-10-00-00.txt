This chapter presents the **fruition perspective**: the five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) and three kāyas (*sku gsum*) as spontaneously present, not created through practice. Longchenpa demonstrates how afflictions transmute into wisdoms and how deluded aggregates become enlightened bodies.

**The Five Wisdoms:**
1. **Dharmadhātu**: Mirror-like wisdom from anger purified
2. **Mirror-like**: Equality wisdom from pride purified  
3. **Discriminating**: All-accomplishing from desire purified
4. **All-accomplishing**: Dharmadhātu from jealousy purified
5. **Equality**: Discriminating from ignorance purified

**The Three Kāyas:**
Presented as spontaneously present—not produced by causes, not destroyed by conditions.

**Key Contribution:** Establishes that enlightenment is the nature of mind, not something to be achieved.
