Building on Chapter 15's elements, this chapter presents the **awareness-aspect** of reality—the expanse (*dbyings*) and wisdom (*ye shes*). Longchenpa explains how the five elements manifest as the five wisdoms, establishing the **nonduality** of ground and fruition.

**The Five Elements as Five Wisdoms:**
- Earth → All-pervading wisdom
- Water → Mirror-like wisdom  
- Fire → Discriminating wisdom
- Wind → All-accomplishing wisdom
- Space → Dharmadhātu wisdom

**The Three Kāyas:**
Presented as spontaneously present in the expanse—Dharmakāya as thought-free, Saṃbhogakāya as uncensored, Nirmāṇakāya as whatever-appearing.

**Key Contribution:** Demonstrates that expanse and wisdom are inseparable—emptiness and clarity are one.
