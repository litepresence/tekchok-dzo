Having established pure vision, Longchenpa now maps the **cosmic architecture** within which ordinary beings dwell. This chapter presents Buddhist cosmology in full: the thirteen Thal-ba fields surrounding Sahā world, pure realms above, hell realms below.

Detailed descriptions of the eight hot hells, eight cold hells, and lifespans in each realm provide **contrast** to Chapter 1's purity. The chapter establishes the cosmological framework essential for understanding how beings become trapped in cyclic existence.

**The Configuration:**
- Six transcendent realms above and below
- Our Sahā world at center
- Thirteen Thal-ba fields in concentric circles
- Eight hot hells and eight cold hells
- Calculations of cosmic time and world-system formation

**Key Contribution:** Maps the full range of existence from Akanisṭha to Avīci, establishing the complete field within which liberation occurs.
