This brief chapter presents the **Abhidharma foundation**: the five elements, five aggregates, and twelve sense-bases that form the basis of conditioned existence. Longchenpa demonstrates how ordinary experience arises through the interaction of these components.

**The Framework:**
- **Five elements** ('byung ba lnga): Earth, water, fire, wind, space
- **Five aggregates** (phung po lnga): Form, feeling, discrimination, formation, consciousness  
- **Twelve sense-bases** (skye mched bcu gnyis): Six faculties and six objects

**Crucial Distinction:** Longchenpa distinguishes between contaminated (*zag bcas*) and uncontaminated (*zag med*) aggregates, foreshadowing the Dzogchen view that the nature of mind is primordially pure despite temporary defilements.

**Key Contribution:** Establishes the standard Buddhist phenomenology that Dzogchen transcends but does not reject.
