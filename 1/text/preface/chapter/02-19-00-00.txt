This chapter presents **deity visualization practices** (*lha'i rnam pa*)—sophisticated methods bridging generation stage (*bskyed rim*) of lower tantras with completion stage (*rdzogs rim*) of Atiyoga. Longchenpa addresses practitioners "free from elaborations"—those ready to apply recognition in formal practice.

**Core Principle:**
Deities are not external beings to worship but **spontaneous self-display of primordial wisdom** (*ye shes rang snang*). Visualization transforms mechanical generation-stage into **instantaneous arising from rigpa**—not creating but recognizing what has always been present.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Dharma exhaustion** (*chos zad*): Exhaustion of conceptual grasping at Dharma
- **Mind-transcending** (*blo 'das*): Beyond intellect's limitations  
- **Zangthal** (*zang thal*): Direct, straight, unimpeded path
- **Changeless wisdom** ('pho 'gyur med pa'i ye shes): Dharmakāya itself

**Key Contribution:** Provides skillful means for maintaining recognition while accumulating the two accumulations.
