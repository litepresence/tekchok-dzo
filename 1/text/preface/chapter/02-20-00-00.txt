This pivotal chapter presents **Direct Transcendence** (*thögal*)—the swift path of light completing what Trekchö begins. Where Cutting Through dismantles conceptual mind, Direct Recognition dissolves appearance itself into luminous source.

**The Two Practices:**

**Trekchö** (*khregs chod*)—Cutting Through:
- Liberates from saṃsāra through recognition of primordial purity
- Mind-based practice cutting through conceptual mind

**Thögal** (*thod rgal*)—Direct Transcendence:  
- Completes liberation by establishing vajra body of light
- Utilizes channels of light, penetrating what remains obscured

**The Four Visions:**
1. Direct realization of dharmatā
2. Increase of wisdom-experience  
3. Recognition of exhaustion
4. Final cessation into the ground

**Key Contribution:** Provides the direct means to realize the view through light itself—transforming perception into self-liberation.
