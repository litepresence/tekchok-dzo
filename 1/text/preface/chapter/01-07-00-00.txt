Continuing from Chapter 6, this focused chapter details the **samaya vows** specific to the Great Perfection. Longchenpa distinguishes between root samayas (fundamental), branch samayas (supporting), and specific Dzogchen samayas unique to the Great Perfection.

**The Commitments:**
- **Body samaya:** Not to abandon the guru's form
- **Speech samaya:** Not to interrupt the guru's speech  
- **Mind samaya:** Not to lose recognition of the guru's mind as one's own
- **Specific Dzogchen samayas:** Unique to Atiyoga view

Consequences of breaking and methods of restoring samaya establish the **ethical container** within which practice must occur.

**Key Contribution:** Establishes the samaya framework that protects and empowers Dzogchen practice.
