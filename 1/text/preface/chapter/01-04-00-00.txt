## CHAPTER 4: Philosophical Systems

**Tibetan:** རིམ་ཁང་བཞི་པ། (Fourth Lecture Hall)  
**Location:** Volume 1, Sections 01-04-01-01 through 01-04-19-01  
**Tibetan Lines:** 1902-4171  
**Total Liturgical Lines:** ~2,100

The longest and most philosophically dense chapter—this **critical survey** examines all Buddhist and non-Buddhist systems. Longchenpa systematically refutes:

- **Hīnayāna** (Śrāvaka and Pratyekabuddha vehicles)
- **Mind-Only** (Cittamātra) systems  
- **Middle Way** (Mādhyamika) approaches
- **Lower tantras** (Kriyā, Caryā, Yoga)

Each refutation serves as **pedagogy**: by understanding each system's limitations, Dzogchen's unique profundity becomes clear. The chapter culminates in presenting Atiyoga as the supreme vehicle, introducing key concepts: primordial purity (*ka dag*), spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*), and the three aspects of the ground.

**Key Contribution:** Positions Dzogchen within Buddhist intellectual tradition while demonstrating its superiority.
