**Location:** Volume 1, Sections 01-01-01-01 through 01-01-03-01  
**Tibetan Lines:** 1-583  
**Total Liturgical Lines:** ~583

The Treasury opens with a **cosmogonic prologue** establishing the pure vision from which all teachings emerge. Longchenpa presents Samantabhadra—the primordial Buddha embodying the five perfections—and traces emanation through the Three Kāyas to Vajradhara, the sixth teacher manifesting in this world system. The thirty-six activities of enlightenment demonstrate that buddhahood is not passive but dynamically engaged.

This chapter provides the **template** for all subsequent maṇḍala visualizations and guru yoga practices. Enlightenment is established as the reference point; all limitations will be measured against this completeness.
