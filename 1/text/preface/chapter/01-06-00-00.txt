This chapter delves into the **guru-disciple relationship**—the heart of Vajrayāna. Longchenpa explains how to recognize an authentic teacher, the proper way to approach and serve the guru, and the samaya (*dam tshig*) commitments that bind practitioner to path.

**The Three Secrets:**
- **Body:** Maṇḍala of colored powders, five wisdoms represented
- **Speech:** Mantra recitation, vajra speech transmission  
- **Mind:** Recognition of nature, mind-to-mind transmission

Detailed instructions on empowerments emphasize that **transmission** (not merely information) is essential for realization.

**Key Contribution:** Establishes the living lineage context without which Dzogchen remains merely theoretical.
