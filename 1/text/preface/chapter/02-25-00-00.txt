This **final chapter** represents the complete revelation of fruition (*'bras bu*) as spontaneous display of primordial purity (*ka dag*) and spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*). Where Chapter 1 established the pure vision of the ground, this chapter demonstrates how all phenomena complete themselves in the expanse without ever departing from primordial nature.

**The Great Liberation (*grol sa chen po*):**
Not attainment through effort, but the natural, self-liberated state that has been the case from the beginning. The reader arrives at recognition that **nothing needed to be done**, for fruition has never been separate from ground.

**The Complete Dissolution:**
- Elements merge into expanse
- Wisdom merges into expanse  
- Prajñā ascends to space
- Luminosity spirals in expanse
- Awareness settles in its own place

**Key Contribution:** The bookend to Chapter 1—where beginning established pure vision, ending demonstrates that fruition was never elsewhere. **Thus the Treasury is complete.**
