This chapter presents **intermediate state instructions** (*bar do*)—the critical juncture between death and rebirth where liberation is most accessible. Longchenpa explains the three bardos: the bardo of dying, the bardo of dharmatā, and the bardo of becoming.

**The Three Bardos:**
1. **Bardo of dying** ('chi ka'i bar do): Dissolution of elements
2. **Bardo of dharmatā** (chos nyid bar do): Luminosity appears  
3. **Bardo of becoming** (srid pa'i bar do): Mental body wanders

**Recognition in Bardo:**
For practitioners who have trained, the bardo is not frightening but a **natural display of mind's own light**. The visions that terrify ordinary beings are recognized as self-appearances.

**Key Contribution:** Essential instructions for liberation at the moment of death or in the intermediate state.
