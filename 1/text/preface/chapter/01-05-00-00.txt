Transitioning from philosophy to practice, this chapter presents the **tantric framework**. Longchenpa enumerates the twelve Buddhas of the three times, explains the three tantra collections, and introduces the empowerment (*dbang bskur*) system.

**Key Topics:**
- Four empowerments: vase, secret, wisdom-knowledge, word
- Three tantra collections: External, Internal, Secret
- Twelve Buddhas of the three times
- Layered cosmology: world-systems within world-systems

This is the **bridge** between sūtra and tantra, establishing why Vajrayāna is necessary for rapid liberation.

**Key Contribution:** Establishes the tantric context within which Dzogchen completion stage practices operate.
