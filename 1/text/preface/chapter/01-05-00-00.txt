## READING GUIDANCE

**For Practitioners:**
This chapter requires familiarity with the nine vehicles presented in Chapter 4. Pay special attention to:
- The distinction between creation and completion stages (Sections 1-2)
- The purpose of each tantra category (Section 3)
- The progression from lower tantras to Great Perfection (Section 4)
- The importance of empowerment and qualified gurus (Section 7)

**For Scholars:**
Note Longchenpa's systematic hermeneutics:
- The fivefold grounding provides an interpretive framework
- The twenty-eight similes demonstrate pedagogical sophistication
- The detailed enumeration of tantras shows encyclopedic knowledge
- The structure moves from general classification to specific practices

**Critical Points:**
1. Without proper empowerment, tantric practice is ineffective (Section 7)
2. The Great Perfection transcends yet includes all lower vehicles (Section 4)
3. The guru-disciple relationship is paramount throughout
4. The ultimate nature is beyond elaboration yet expressed through skillful means
