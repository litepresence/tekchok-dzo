The most extensive bardo chapter—this **detailed navigation guide** describes the visions and experiences of the intermediate state. Longchenpa maps the progressive appearances: from initial luminosity through the hundred peaceful and wrathful deities to the judgment visions that determine rebirth.

**The Progressive Visions:**
- **First three days**: Luminosity of dharmatā appears
- **Days 4-7**: Peaceful deities manifest from heart centers
- **Days 8-14**: Wrathful deities manifest from brain centers  
- **Days 15-49**: Judgment scenes, karmic winds, seeking rebirth

**Recognition vs. Delusion:**
For trained practitioners, these are **self-appearances of awareness** (*rig pa rang snang*). For ordinary beings, terrifying external threats.

**Key Contribution:** Complete map of the bardo experience—essential for practitioners preparing for death.
