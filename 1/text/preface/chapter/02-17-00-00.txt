This extensive chapter provides the **systematic path** of Dzogchen practice. Longchenpa presents the twelve yogins (progressive stages), conduct, meditation, and view—addressing practitioners of three faculties (sharp, medium, dull) as capacities for recognition, not fixed categories.

**Key Topics:**
- **Twelve yogins**: Progressive stages from beginner to awakening
- **Dream yoga** (*rmi lam*): Recognition in sleep
- **Clear light** ('od gsal): Luminosity practice  
- **Consciousness transference** ('pho ba): At death
- **Bardo navigation**: Intermediate state preparation

This is the **practical manual** for Dzogchen path practice.

**Key Contribution:** Provides the graduated path suitable for practitioners of varying capacities.
