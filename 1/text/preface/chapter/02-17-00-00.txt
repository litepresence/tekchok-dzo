## CHAPTER 17: The Twelve Yogins—Progressive Experience-Taking Through the Definite Path

**Tibetan:** རིམ་ཁང་བཅུ་བདུན་པ། (Seventeenth Lecture Hall)  
**Location:** Volume 1, Sections 02-17-01-01 through 02-17-14-01  
**Tibetan Lines:** 1754-3887  
**Total Liturgical Lines:** ~2,368

This chapter presents one of the most comprehensive guides to **progressive spiritual development** in the entire Treasury. Longchenpa systematically categorizes practitioners into twelve types of "yogins" (rnal 'byor pa)—those who engage in the definitive path of experience-taking. The chapter serves as both a **diagnostic tool** (helping practitioners recognize their current level) and a **roadmap** (showing the progression to liberation).

The structure follows a clear pedagogical logic: the first eight types of yogins **do not achieve liberation** through their methods, while the final four **do achieve liberation**. This critical distinction helps practitioners avoid wasted effort on approaches that, while virtuous, are ultimately insufficient for the Great Perfection.

## SECTION BREAKDOWN

### **Section 1: 02-17-01-01.txt (115 lines)**  
**Topic:** Overview of the Twelve Yogins

This opening section establishes the framework:

**The Three Categories:**
1. **Common distinction** (thun mong gi dbye ba)
2. **Individual meaning explained** (so so'i don bshad pa)
3. **Supreme place definite** (bla na med pa'i gnas nges pa)

**The Twelve Yogins from Rang-shar:**
<list> 1. Characteristic word yogin (mtshan ma tshig gi rnal 'byor)
<list> 2. Sign-mere-holding yogin (rtags tsam 'dzin pa'i rnal 'byor)
<list> 3. Following-enter yogin (rjes su 'jug pa'i rnal 'byor)
<list> 4. Nature-definite yogin (ngang nges pa'i rnal 'byor)
<list> 5. Appearance-mind yogin (snang ba sems kyi rnal 'byor)
<list> 6. Enter-action yogin ('jug pa las kyi rnal 'byor)
<list> 7. Action-cause yogin (byed pa rgyu yi rnal 'byor)
<list> 8. Doer-condition yogin (byed pa rkyen gyi rnal 'byor)
<list> 9. End-arrive-fruit yogin (mthar phyin 'bras bu'i rnal 'byor)
<list> 10. Authentic meaning yogin (yang dag don gyi rnal 'byor)
<list> 11. End-arrive liberation yogin (mthar phyin grol ba'i rnal 'byor)
<list> 12. Done-complete yogin (byas pa rdzogs pa'i rnal 'byor)

**Critical Distinction:**
- **First eight** (1-8): Do not liberate because they rely on externals, fixation, or gradual methods
- **Last four** (9-12): Liberate because they recognize self-nature, authentic meaning, and primordial completion

**Key Teaching:**
> "In the four great yogins, I do not speak ground-purify, I do not speak path-traverse."

This points to the Dzogchen view that **rigpa is spontaneously complete**—no transformation or purification is needed.

### **Section 2: 02-17-02-01.txt (206 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Four Liberating Yogins

This section details the final four yogins who **do achieve liberation**:

**Nine: End-Arrive-Fruit Yogin (mthar phyin 'bras bu'i rnal 'byor):**
- Carries the path of realization
- Does not dwell in ground-path duality
- Sees self that-ness
- Regarded as great authentic liberation

**Ten: Authentic Meaning Yogin (yang dag don gyi rnal 'byor):**
- Obtains self-realization
- In pure bardo-appearance
- Sees authentic self
- Regarded as end-arrive liberated

**Eleven: End-Arrive Liberation Yogin (mthar phyin grol ba'i rnal 'byor):**
- The certainty-obtaining yogin
- In ground itself of certainty-obtaining
- Sees obtain self that-ness
- Regarded as beyond authentic ground

**Twelve: Done-Complete Yogin (byas pa rdzogs pa'i rnal 'byor):**
- The primordially-pure great buddha
- From that gone, beyond speech
- Ground-purify and path-traverse not needed
- Rigpa spontaneously-accomplished, not-transform not-purify

**The Key Distinction:**
The difference lies in **recognition** (ngo shes) versus **gradual attainment** (rim gyis):
- Lower yogins rely on causes, conditions, effort, and gradual progress
- Higher yogins recognize what is spontaneously present

**Three Types of Conduct:**
1. **Characteristic vehicle conduct** (rgyu mtshan nyid kyi theg pa'i spyod pa): Sūtra approach—does not quickly liberate, enters common path only
2. **Mantra general conduct** (gsang sngas spyi'i spyod pa): Tantra approach—exists method but dwells in effort-accomplishment, does not quickly liberate
3. **Great Completion spontaneously-accomplish conduct** (rdzogs pa chen po lhun gyis grub pa'i spyod pa): Dzogchen approach—no acceptance-rejection holding effort, accord conduct, dwells great spontaneously-liberate spontaneously-conduct

### **Sections 5-6: 02-17-05-01.txt (98 lines) & 02-17-06-01.txt (246 lines)**  
**Topic:** Definite Sequence Conduct and Progressive Practice

These sections explain:
- **Beginner's conduct**: Ten dharma activities (writing, offering, giving, hearing, reading, holding, explaining, reciting, contemplating, meditating)
- **Intermediate conduct**: Practicing profound instructions, three empowerments' preliminary, body-speech-mind conduct dividing samsara-nirvana, establishing rigpa
- **Advanced conduct**: Seven of the twenty-one conducts as primary
- **Progressive manner**: From hearing to contemplation to meditation

**The Three Wisdoms:**
- Hearing wisdom: Cuts outer superimposition
- Contemplation wisdom: Cuts inner superimposition
- Meditation wisdom: Cuts secret superimposition

---

### **Section 7: 02-17-07-01.txt (60 lines)**  
**Topic:** Dream Yoga Practices

This section presents **actual dream yoga** (rmi lam):

**Training Methods:**
1. **Harsh-holding**: When fear arises from fierce conditions, think "I sit within a dream"
2. **Emanation**: One-to-many emanation of deity-forms, sentient beings
3. **Transformation**: Male-female, god-naga transformation
4. **Travel**: Go to not-reached places, realms, hear dharma

**Stages of Dream Practice:**
- First: coarse dreams
- Then: subtle dreams
- Then: fade
- Finally: anything not dream—day-night mixed self-clear rigpa concentration

**The Definitive Point:**
Though preliminary dream practice is important, the actual meaning is **not free from intellect truth-grasping**. The definitive practice is recognizing **appearances' nature**—one-pointed meditation without losing effort-force.

### **Sections 8-9: 02-17-08-01.txt (75 lines) & 02-17-09-01.txt (78 lines)**  
**Topic:** Illusory Body and Clear Light

These sections cover:
- **Illusory body** (sgyu lus): Like a dream, like an echo, like a magical illusion
- **Clear light** ('od gsal): Day-night dharmatā-wheel, not beyond
- **Eight examples of illusion**: Dream, echo, magical illusion, mirage, water-moon, water-bubble, optical illusion, echo

---

### **Section 10: 02-17-10-01.txt (51 lines)**  
**Topic:** Transference of Consciousness ('pho ba)

This section explains the **three types of transference**:

1. **Great**: Clear-light transference
   - For those who mastered clear-light
   - Death-time: extract awareness to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmadhātu

2. **Medium**: Illusory-body transference
   - For those who mastered illusory-body
   - Death-time: project awareness to Brahma-aperture, transference to dharmatā meaning deity-form
   - Hold bardo illusory-body, become buddha

3. **Finally**: Body-speech transference
   - For those who didn't master the first two
   - Depend upon body-speech-mind three points channel-wind
   - Transference to Brahma-aperture

**Brahma-Aperture**: The crown aperture (tshangs bug) as the transference path

**Warning**: Forceful transference from upper nine apertures is like "killing a Brahmin"—a grave act with five borderless transgressions.

**Scripture Citations:** Thalgyur, Four Vajra Seats

### **Sections 11-13: 02-17-11-01.txt (266 lines) - 02-17-13-01.txt (155 lines)**  
**Topic:** Bardo Instructions and Union Realization

These sections cover:
- **Four bardos**: Birth-death, dream, dharmatā, existence
- **Union realization**: Practicing this life for bardo readiness
- **Actual bardo instruction**: Recognition of dharmatā at death

---

### **Section 14: 02-17-14-01.txt (78 lines)**  
**Topic:** Concluding Instructions

This final section summarizes the **definitive meaning**:

**Three Examples:**
1. **Royal empowerment**: Like royal caste head empowerment, taking royal throne without change—rigpa taking its own place
2. **King's army**: Like when king sends army to frontier, king-subject circle changes place—five gates consciousness dawn, ground empty, saṃsāra name not
3. **Minister captured**: Like when excellent minister captured by another king—mind consciousness move continuum ceases, dawn-ground rigpa obtains self-power

**Final Teaching:**
> "Effort do arisen like not—primordially thus dwell meaning top nature arrive fruit."

The nature arrives at fruit without effort, primordially dwelling thus.

**From the Six Vastnesses:**
- Obtain existence in mind-itself
- By self-pure hope-fear
- Free from effort-accomplish
- Body three self complete

## THE CHAPTER'S UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION

### **Progressive Pedagogy**

Chapter 17 exemplifies Longchenpa's sophisticated pedagogy:

1. **Diagnostic**: The twelve yogins help practitioners identify their current level
2. **Prognostic**: Shows which approaches lead to liberation and which don't
3. **Therapeutic**: Provides specific remedies for each type
4. **Graduated**: From beginner (ten dharma activities) to advanced (spontaneous conduct)

### **Critique of Gradualism**

The chapter contains a **powerful critique** of gradual spiritual approaches:

- **Not rejection**: The first eight yogins aren't wrong—they're incomplete
- **Not acceptance**: They don't lead to the final goal
- **But recognition**: The last four yogins recognize what is spontaneously present

### **Integration of Methods**

The chapter integrates:
- **Sūtra**: Ethics, study, contemplation
- **Tantra**: Deity yoga, mantras, conduct
- **Dzogchen**: Spontaneous liberation, rigpa recognition

## READING GUIDANCE

### **For Practitioners**

This chapter is **essential for self-assessment**:

**Key Questions:**
1. Which yogin am I? (Be honest!)
2. Am I relying on causes and conditions (first eight) or recognition (last four)?
3. Do my practices lead to liberation or just virtue?

**Practice Applications:**
- **Dream yoga**: Start with harsh-holding, progress to emanation-transformation
- **Conduct**: Adopt the twenty-one animal analogies gradually
- **Transference**: Master clear-light or illusory-body first if possible
- **Bardo**: Prepare now through day-night union practice

**Warning Signs:**
- Attachment to words → become characteristic word yogin
- Attachment to signs → become sign-mere-holding yogin  
- Attachment to faith → become following-enter yogin
- Attachment to meditation experiences → become nature-definite yogin
- Attachment to "all is mind" view → become appearance-mind yogin
- Attachment to action → become enter-action yogin
- Attachment to tantra causes → become action-cause yogin
- Attachment to caste/conduct → become doer-condition yogin

**The Remedy:**
Each of the first eight has a corresponding liberation in the last four. The key is **recognition** (ngo shes) of what is spontaneously present.

### **For Scholars**

Note the systematic structure:
- **Taxonomy**: Twelve types with clear characteristics
- **Evaluation**: Which liberate, which don't
- **Progression**: From effortful to effortless
- **Integration**: Sūtra, tantra, Dzogchen as progressive stages

**Critical Points:**
1. **Not elitism**: The first eight aren't rejected—they're steps toward the last four
2. **Not anti-intellectual**: Words, study, and practice are necessary foundations
3. **Not quietism**: Spontaneous completion doesn't mean inaction
4. **But directness**: The last four point directly to what is always already the case

## CONNECTION TO CHAPTER 18

Chapter 17 established the **progressive path of practice**; Chapter 18 will present the **fruition** of these practices. The progression:

- **Chapter 17**: The path—twelve yogins, twenty-one conducts, dream yoga, transference
- **Chapter 18**: The fruition—recognition, liberation, completion

This mirrors the ground-path-fruition structure:
1. **Ground**: Primordial purity spontaneously present
2. **Path**: Progressive recognition through the twelve yogins
3. **Fruition**: Done-complete yogin, primordially-pure great buddha

**Key Insight**: The chapter shows that **all practices are complete in rigpa**—the progressive path is for those who don't yet recognize this. The last four yogins recognize what the first eight are striving toward.
