# Chapter Title Standardization Report

## Date: February 19, 2026

---

## Summary

After analyzing all four sources (contents.md, volume prefaces, chapter prefaces, and liturgical endings) against the Tibetan originals, I've identified discrepancies and created a standardized naming convention.

---

## Discrepancies Found

### Major Issues (Tibetan-derived titles vs. Simplified titles):

| Chapter | Tibetan Title | Current Variations | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 | བྱུང་ཚུལ་གཏན་ལ་དབབ་པ (The Manner of Arising Established) | "The Perfect Teacher" | **Keep "The Perfect Teacher"** - clearer for readers |
| 3 | ཕུང་ཁམས་ཀྱི་རྣམ་གཞག (Arrangement of Aggregates/Elements) | "Samsaric Phenomena" / "The Detailed Division of Samsaric Phenomena" | **Keep "Samsaric Phenomena"** - matches content focus |
| 9 | ལྷུན་གྲུབ་སྣང་ཚུལ་གྱི་སྒོ་ལས་འཁོར་འདས་ཀྱི་གྱེས་མདོ་བསྟན་པ (Showing Turning Point of Samsara/Nirvana through Spontaneous Presence) | "How Delusion Arises from Ground" / "The Manner of Spontaneous Presence Appearance" | **Change to "Spontaneous Presence Appearance"** - closer to Tibetan |
| 22 | དུས་གསུམ་རྟགས་ཀྱི་རྣམ་གྲངས་ངེས་པ་གཏན་ལ་ཕབ་པ (Certain Establishment of Signs of Three Times) | "Phowa Transference" / "The Certain Establishment..." | **Keep "Phowa Transference"** - clearer subject matter |
| 25 | འབྲས་བུ་ལྷུན་གྲུབ་ཏུ་བསྟན་པ (Showing Spontaneous Fruition) | "Spontaneous Results" / "Spontaneous Fruition" / "The Great Liberation" | **Standardize on "Spontaneous Fruition"** - accurate translation of 'bras bu |

## Changes Required

### 1. contents.md
- **Chapter 9:** Change "How Delusion Arises from Ground" → "Spontaneous Presence Appearance"
- **Chapter 25:** Change "Spontaneous Results" → "Spontaneous Fruition"

### 2. Volume Prefaces
- **Volume 2 (02-00-00-00.txt):** 
  - Chapter 9 reference: Update title
  - Chapter 25 reference: Update title

### 3. Chapter Prefaces
- **Chapter 9 (01-09-00-00.txt):** Update title and content references
- **Chapter 25 (02-25-00-00.txt):** Update title and content references

### 4. Liturgical Text (Optional)
- Consider updating closing lines to match standardized titles where significantly different
- Priority: Chapter 9 and Chapter 25

---

## Rationale

1. **Chapter 1:** "The Perfect Teacher" is pedagogically clearer than literal Tibetan "The Manner of Arising Established"

2. **Chapter 9:** "Spontaneous Presence Appearance" (ལྷུན་གྲུབ་སྣང་ཚུལ) is the actual Tibetan focus, not delusion specifically

3. **Chapter 22:** "Phowa Transference" describes the actual practice content better than the technical Tibetan title about "signs of the three times"

4. **Chapter 25:** "Fruition" (འབྲས་བུ) is more accurate than "Results" and matches standard Dzogchen terminology

1. `/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/contents/contents.md` - Lines 176, 448
2. `/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/text/preface/volume/02-00-00-00.txt` - Chapters 9 and 25 references
3. `/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/text/preface/chapter/01-09-00-00.txt` - Title and overview
4. `/home/opencode/MDZOD/1/text/preface/chapter/02-25-00-00.txt` - Title and overview
