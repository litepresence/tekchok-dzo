# Editorial Conventions: Commentary Layer

## What Is the Commentary Layer?

The Commentary Layer presents heart-instruction (*man ngag*) designed to support recognition of mind's nature. These are not casual reading materials.

**Read with:**
- Appropriate respect for the tradition
- Understanding that practice requires qualified teachers
- Awareness that this is one interpretation among many

**Not as:**
- Authorization to practice without transmission
- Substitute for teacher guidance (especially Chapters 17-25)
- Definitive or official doctrine

---

## What This Layer Does

The Commentary Layer is *ngo sprod kyi bshad pa*—heart-instruction that unpacks Longchenpa's dense autocommentary into immediate recognition. It creates conditions where insight can arise, not through explanation but through resonance.

**Purpose:**
- Resonating from recognition (heart-to-heart, not head-to-head)
- Creating conditions for recognition to arise naturally
- Speaking from realization, not about it
- Inviting through heart-essence (*snying po*) rather than demanding

This is oral lineage transmitted through written text.

## The Voice: Living Lineage Speaking

The Commentary Layer embodies the **living lineage**—not one voice, but many masters speaking from recognition. This creates a "community meeting place" where realized beings speak in rotation, each bringing different qualities to the pointing.

### The 27 Voices

**Core Voices (Always Present):**

1. **Garab Dorje (First Point)** — Stark directness: "See what is."
2. **Patrul (Vagabond)** — Earthy witness: "This old fool..."
3. **Longchenpa (Omniscient)** — Vast bridge: "Between... the vast view..."
4. **Padmasambhava (Lotus-Born)** — Visionary: Poetic, multidimensional
5. **Mipham (Philosopher)** — Diamond precision: Scholarly distinctions
6. **Consort (Dakini)** — Intimate wisdom: Secret, feminine principle
7. **Systematizer** — Structural clarity: Precise architecture
8. **Integrator** — Spacious unity: Dissolves dualities
9. **Wandering Guru** — Radical simplicity: Essential pointing

**Visitor Voices (Rotate Throughout):**
Precision, Spontaneity, Devotee, Ecstatic, Essence Holder, Singing Yogi, Pandita Consort, Lion-Faced, Sky-Dancer, Drolo, Diamond Wrath, Great Wrath, Living Library, Modern Bridge, Minimalist, Translator, Revealer, and others.

### How the Voices Work

**Anonymous Speaking:**
The voices remain unidentified in the text. You will not read "Garab Dorje said..." or "As Patrul teaches..." Instead, the lineage speaks directly:

- *"Three words. See what is. Rest."* (First Point)
- *"This old fool sat in a frozen valley..."* (Vagabond)
- *"Between the searching and the finding..."* (Omniscient)

You recognize voices by pattern, not by name.

**Voice Intensity (0.0-1.0):**
Each block varies in intensity:
- **0.8-1.0:** Full character (maximum distinctiveness)
- **0.4-0.7:** Moderate (recognizable but softer)
- **0.1-0.3:** Subtle (barely perceptible)

**Energetic Quality:**
Voices shift across feminine/masculine/beyond spectrum, creating variety in how the pointing arrives.

**Conversation Flow:**
- Voices stay for 2-3 blocks (developing thought)
- Voices return later (counterpoint)
- Single appearances (strike and depart)
- Longchenpa bridges between approaches
- Occasional wrathful appearance for effect

### The Homogenous Lineage Voice

While 27 distinct voices rotate, the result is a unified **lineage heart commentary voice**. The variety serves singularity: different angles pointing to the same recognition.

This is not cacophony. It is a chorus. Each voice adds depth without contradicting. The rotation itself teaches: realization has many faces, one essence.

## Content Approach

**Line-by-Line Engagement**

Commentary addresses specific line ranges from Tibetan:
```
[24-27] This is the scope declaration. Longchenpa is not just
telling you what this text is—he is showing you how to read it.
Don't skim past this as mere formal introduction. This IS the
teaching...
```

**From Not About**

Not: "Longchenpa teaches that..." (about)
Yes: "This is what you are..." (from)

**Resonating Not Forcing**

Not: "Look at your mind right now—you must see this!" (forcing)
Yes: "This old fool watched his mind for years before seeing..." (resonating)

**Pointing to Recognition**

Every comment aims to catalyze direct insight:
- Stop reading and look
- What is aware of these words?
- That awareness is what Longchenpa points to

## What the Commentary Never Does

- Attributes the voice (no "Garab Dorje said...")
- Uses modern/industrial references (electricity, gasoline)
- Explains academically ("The philosophical position...")
- Uses generic spiritual formulas ("empty yet luminous")
- Employs repetitive parallelism for effect
- Teaches without certainty
- Wanders outside the section's domain
- Commands the reader ("You must," "Stop now!")

## Relationship to Liturgical Text

**Liturgical** = The sacred text itself (majesty and precision)
**Commentary** = The finger pointing to the moon (heart-instruction)

Read Liturgical to receive the transmission.
Read Commentary to understand what you received.
Return to Liturgical with new eyes.

## Editorial Standards

- Distinct voices rotating
- Specific line ranges [XXX-XXX] for every block
- Concrete metaphors 
- Practice obstacle reference
- Metaphyiscal precision is priorty one. 

## Methodology Note

All translation and commentary layers were generated using Kimi K2.5 over three weeks with extensive human prompting and curation by one practitioner.

**Process:**
1. Tibetan text analyzed section by section
2. AI-generated commentary with voice rotation (27 voices)
3. Human verification of voice distinctiveness
4. Quality assessment against multiple criteria
5. Curation and refinement
6. Final selection of blocks for publication

**What the AI Did:**
- Generated preliminary commentary blocks
- Maintained voice rotation across 213 sections
- Produced variety in tone and approach

**What the Human Did:**
- Designed the 27-voice system
- Crafted detailed prompts for voice qualities
- Curated which blocks to keep
- Verified doctrinal accuracy
- Assessed quality and coherence
- Made final editorial judgments

**Result:**
The voices represent stylized channeling of historical masters, not their actual words. The rotation creates a unified lineage heart voice—many faces, one essence. The commentary is AI-generated and human-curated, not traditionally transmitted.

**Use it as:** Support for understanding, one perspective among many, study aid
**Not as:** Historical master's actual words, substitute for teacher guidance, definitive authority
