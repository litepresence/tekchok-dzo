# Editorial Conventions: Tibetan Layer

## What Is the Tibetan Layer?

The Tibetan Layer is the *Tshad ma*—the Source of Validity—for this entire project. It represents the perfected Tibetan Unicode text,edited and corrected from the Raw extraction, and serves as the absolute foundation upon which all translations and interpretations rest.

## The Voice: Longchenpa's Own Words

The Tibetan Layer speaks in **Longchenpa's own voice**—the 14th-century Dzogchen master, author of the *Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle*, speaking directly across seven centuries. This is the *Tshad ma*—the Source of Validity—not a translation, interpretation, or commentary, but the master himself.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Authoritative:** The ground of all understanding in this project
- **Immutable:** Sacred text that has not been altered
- **Direct:** Longchenpa speaks to the reader without intermediary
- **Complete:** The full expression of the master's intent

**Status: Immutable Truth**

**This layer is sacred. It is the ground. It did not change.**

## Editorial Standards

**Source Authority**

The Tibetan Layer is based on:
- BDRC UT22920_005_0001_bo,sa,zh.txt
- BDRC UT22920_005_0002_bo,sa,zh.txt
- BDRC "BEST QUALITY" designation

**What Was Changed**

- Spaces were turned into line breaks
- Each line is prefixed with its line number:

```
[1] ༄༅།
[2] ཐེག་པའི་མཆོག་རིན་པོ་ཆེའི་མཛོད།
```

This enables precise cross-referencing across all translation layers.

**What Was Preserved**

- 100% of the corrected OCR as provided by BDRC

**Character Encoding**

All text is encoded in UTF-8 Tibetan Unicode (U+0F00 through U+0FFF). No proprietary fonts or encodings are used.

## The Sanctity of the Source

In Tibetan Buddhist textual traditions, the source language carries special authority. While translations open the Dharma to new audiences, the Tibetan text remains the touchstone for all understanding.

## Using This Layer

**For Scholars**

The Tibetan Layer serves as:
- The primary object of philological study
- The reference point for all translations
- The ground for doctrinal discussions
- The source for independent translation work

**For Practitioners**

While many practitioners will read the Liturgical and Commentary
layers, the Tibetan Layer remains:
- The ultimate authority for meaning
- The basis for visual memorization
- The sacred text itself

**For Translators**

This is your source. Every interpretion ultimately bows to the Tibetan Layer.

## Relationship to Other Layers

The Tibetan Layer stands as absolute truth:

Tibetan (Absolute) → Wylie (Bridge) → [All English Layers]

No English layer can override the Tibetan. Where questions arise, return to this source.

## A Final Note on Authority

In creating this layer, we have followed the traditional Tibetan editorial principle: *Tshad mar byas*—establishing valid cognition. The Tibetan Layer is not our interpretation of Longchenpa; it is Longchenpa's words themselves, preserved and presented with fidelity.
