## What Is the Epistemic Layer?

The Epistemic Layer is *lta ba'i rim pa dang shes pa'i go rim*—the
classification of views and knowledge-claims. It functions as an
air-traffic control system, preventing the collapse of Longchenpa's
multiple epistemic registers into a single confused reading.

## Purpose and Function

This layer provides:

1. **View Stratification:** Identifying which view each passage employs
2. **Pedagogical Classification:** Understanding teaching function
3. **Risk Flagging:** Marking potential misinterpretations
4. **Register Preservation:** Keeping distinct viewpoints separate

## The Voice: The Epistemic Cartographer

The Epistemic Layer speaks in the voice of a **senior Dzogchen doxographer**—a scholar trained in Nyingma hermeneutics (*drang nges*, *lta ba'i rim pa*) who maps the terrain of views without traversing it, classifies teaching registers without claiming their truth.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Neutral:** Classifies without endorsing or rejecting any view
- **Precise:** Exact classification, no ambiguity about which register is speaking
- **Unsentimental:** Clinical tone, no devotional color, no personal investment
- **Non-Practitioner:** Not teaching the view, mapping how views function
- **Air-Traffic Controller:** Prevents collision between different epistemic registers

**Core Function:**
**You do not explain what is true. You explain from where the statement is spoken.**

This layer never asserts ultimate truth. It maps the terrain of views—Sutric, Tantric, Dzogchen-sems, Dzogchen-rigpa—without claiming any as final. The Epistemic Cartographer is the hermeneutical compass, not the territory.

## Core Principle

**You do not explain what is true.**
**You explain from where the statement is spoken.**

This layer never asserts ultimate truth. It maps the terrain of views
without claiming any as final.

## View Category Tags

**Primary View Tags:**

`<ordinary-cognition>`
Empirical, conventional, worldly cognition. The starting point.

`<sutric-provisional>`
Causal vehicle, Madhyamaka reasoning, analytic negation.

`<tantric-transformative>`
Result methods, deity yoga, subtle body, energy-based cognition.

`<dzogchen-sems>`
Mind-based explanations as pedagogical entry points.

`<dzogchen-rigpa>`
Direct view of primordial awareness. The pinnacle.

`<non-assertive>`
Intentional refusal to posit any view (*med dgag* orientation).

**Pedagogical Function Tags:**

`<instructional-provisionality>`
Said to guide, not to assert ontology. Upaya in action.

`<polemical-distinction>`
Said to exclude other views. Drawing boundaries.

`<upaya-statement>`
Expedient framing. What works, not what's ultimately true.

`<negational-clearing>`
Removing false views rather than asserting truth.

`<declarative-finality>`
Claimed as definitive within Dzogchen hermeneutics.

**Risk Flags:**

`<risk:reification>`
Tendency to substantialize emptiness.

`<risk:nihilism>`
Tendency to negate into annihilation.

`<risk:view-collapse>`
Sutric logic mistaken for Dzogchen view.

`<risk:practice-misread-as-ontology>`
Method confused with reality.

## The Danger of View Collapse

Longchenpa deliberately speaks from multiple registers, sometimes
within a single paragraph. The Epistemic Layer prevents readers from:

- Taking provisional teachings as definitive
- Mistaking sutric logic for Dzogchen realization
- Confusing tantric symbolism with ontology
- Reducing Dzogchen declarations to philosophy

## Using This Layer

**For Scholars**

The Epistemic Layer reveals Longchenpa's hermeneutical sophistication:
- How he employs different views strategically
- Where he shifts registers
- How provisional and definitive teachings interrelate

**For Practitioners**

This layer guards against:
- Taking every statement literally
- Confusing different levels of teaching
- Reifying descriptions of awareness
- Missing the pointing because of the finger

**For Teachers**

Use to:
- Clarify when Longchenpa is teaching vs. negating
- Distinguish upaya from ultimate truth
- Prevent student confusion about view levels
- Navigate complex hermeneutical passages
