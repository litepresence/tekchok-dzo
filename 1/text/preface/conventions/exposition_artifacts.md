## What Is the Artifacts Layer?

The Artifacts Layer documents the technical metadata and processing
artifacts generated during the digitization and editorial pipeline. It
serves as a transparent record of how the source materials were
transformed into the published text.

## Purpose and Function

This layer is not a reading text. It is a technical audit trail that
enables:

- Verification of editorial decisions
- Assessment of OCR accuracy
- Understanding of textual variants
- Research into digitization methodology

## Contents

**OCR Confidence Data**

Each character extracted from the source documents carries a confidence
score indicating the certainty of recognition:

- High confidence (>0.95): Clear, unambiguous characters
- Medium confidence (0.85-0.95): Readable with minor uncertainty
- Low confidence (<0.85): Degraded or unclear characters

**Character Alternatives**

Where OCR engines present multiple possible readings, all alternatives
are recorded with their respective confidence scores. This enables
scholars to evaluate editorial choices.

**Formatting Anomalies**

The Artifacts Layer flags:
- Irregular spacing or alignment
- Damaged or missing text blocks
- Non-standard character forms
- Insertions or marginalia

**Editorial Decisions**

Every conscious editorial choice is documented:
- Selection between variant readings
- Preservation of non-standard orthography
- Handling of unclear passages
- Normalization decisions

## Transparency and Accountability

This layer embodies our commitment to editorial transparency. In
traditional Tibetan publishing, editorial decisions often remain
opaque. The Artifacts Layer makes every choice visible and verifiable.

## Using This Layer

**For Scholars**

This layer enables:
- Verification of readings against source materials
- Assessment of textual reliability
- Research into transmission history
- Critical evaluation of editorial methodology

**For General Readers**

You are unlikely to consult this layer unless you have specific
questions about the source text or editorial process.

**For Future Editors**

The Artifacts Layer provides the foundation for future editorial work,
showing exactly what was preserved and what was transformed.

## Technical Methodology

**OCR Processing**

The digitization pipeline employed:
- High-resolution scanning of source materials
- Automated OCR using Tibetan-optimized engines
- Manual verification of uncertain readings
- Confidence scoring for every character

**Alternative Recording**

Where multiple readings are possible, the Artifacts Layer records:
- Primary reading (highest confidence)
- Alternative readings with scores
- Contextual factors affecting decision
- Final editorial selection

## Relationship to Other Layers

The Artifacts Layer documents the transformation from Raw to Tibetan:

Raw → [Artifacts documents this process] → Tibetan

It does not contain interpretive material but rather meta-data about
the creation of the Tibetan Layer.
