# Editorial Conventions: Literal Layer

## What Is the Literal Layer?

The Literal Layer is a *Dpyad kyi bshad pa*—an analytical translation
that maps Tibetan syntax onto English with 1:1 precision. It serves as
the grammatical scaffold upon which all elegant translations are built.

## Purpose and Function

The Literal Layer provides:

1. **Grammatical Transparency:** Every particle and suffix visible
2. **Syntactic Mapping:** Tibetan word order preserved
3. **Semantic Precision:** No smoothing or interpretation
4. **Translation Scaffold:** Foundation for Liturgical layer

## Approach: The Analytical Scalpel

This is not a reading text. It is a *grammatical instrument* calibrated
for syntactic decomposition.

**Word Order**

Tibetan word order is preserved. English conventions are violated to
maintain fidelity to the source syntax.

**Particles**

Every Tibetan particle is represented:
- *kyis* → "by means of" / "through"
- *las* → "from" / "out of"
- *la* → "to" / "in" / "at"

**Compounds**

Hyphenated to reflect nonduality:
- *snang stong* → "appearance-emptiness"
- *rig pa* → "awareness" (not "rigpa" as proper noun)

**Articles**

Omitted unless Tibetan explicitly marks definiteness:
- No: "the ground," "a practitioner"
- Yes: "ground," "practitioner"

## Grammar in Service of Meaning

The Literal Layer is ugly so that the Liturgical Layer can be
beautiful. It sacrifices English fluency to expose Tibetan structure.

**Example**

Tibetan:
```
gdod nas rnam dag spros kun zhi ba
```

Literal:
```
from-primordial pure elaboration all pacified
```

Liturgical (for comparison):
```
From the primordial pure, where all elaborations cease
```

## Status: Frozen

**The Literal Layer is complete and immutable.**

As of February 10, 2026, this layer has been:
- Generated for all 213 sections
- Verified against Tibetan source
- Locked against further modification

It serves as the unchanging grammatical foundation for the project.

## Using This Layer

**For Translators**

The Literal Layer provides the grammatical skeleton. Use it to:
- Verify syntax of interpretive translations
- Identify grammatical ambiguities
- Map relationships between terms
- Build your own translations

**For Students**

Study the Literal Layer to understand:
- How Tibetan grammar works
- How particles function
- Why word order matters
- How meaning is grammatically constructed

**For Scholars**

The Literal Layer enables:
- Precise grammatical analysis
- Comparative translation study
- Verification of interpretive choices
- Philological research

## Relationship to Liturgical

Literal → Liturgical

The Liturgical Layer transforms Literal's grammatical precision into
elegant, readable English. The Literal Layer exposes the bones; the
Liturgical Layer adds flesh and breath.

## Limitations

This layer is not meant to be read continuously. It is a reference
tool, a grammatical map, a syntactic scaffold. For actual reading, see
the Liturgical Layer.

## Verification

The Literal Layer was verified through:
- 1:1 character preservation checks
- Grammatical accuracy review
- Syllable-by-syllable alignment
- Cross-reference with Wylie parsing

We affirm its accuracy as a grammatical instrument, not as literature.
