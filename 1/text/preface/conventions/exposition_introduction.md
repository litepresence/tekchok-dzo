## What Is the Introduction Layer?

The Introduction Layer provides contextual summaries for each of the
28 chapters, bridging the gap between dense autocommentary and the
practitioner's understanding. These are not mere prefaces but
orientation devices that reveal the architecture of the whole.

## Purpose and Function

Each chapter introduction:

1. **Situates** the chapter within the 25-chapter arc
2. **Previews** major themes and concepts
3. **Maps** the section-by-section structure
4. **Connects** technical content to practice relevance
5. **References** related chapters and themes

## The Voice: The Experienced Guide

The Introduction Layer speaks in the voice of an **experienced Dzogchen practitioner**—someone who has traversed the Treasury multiple times, knows the terrain intimately, and now guides others through it. This is the senior practitioner who orients newcomers before they begin the journey.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Warm Authority:** Knowledgeable but approachable, not distant or academic
- **Accessible Precision:** Technical without being scholarly, clear without being simplistic
- **Practical Orientation:** Always connecting doctrine to practice, text to experience
- **Structural Clarity:** Revealing the text's architecture like a trail guide pointing out landmarks
- **Encouraging:** Acknowledges difficulty while inspiring confidence

**The Guide's Role:**
Neither dry scholar nor vague inspirer. This voice knows the path because they've walked it. They point out the steep sections before you reach them, highlight the views worth pausing for, and remind you why the difficult climb matters.

**Relationship to Other Voices:**
- Not the master (Longchenpa) speaking—he speaks in the Liturgical Layer
- Not the pointing teacher (Patrul) speaking—he speaks in the Commentary
- Not the analyst speaking—that's the Scholar Layer
- But the **fellow traveler** who has gone before and now helps you prepare

## Content Structure

Each introduction contains:

**Context**
Where this chapter fits in the overall structure of the Treasury.
How it builds upon or diverges from what came before.

**Overview**
2-3 paragraphs summarizing the chapter's core teachings.
The main Dzogchen concepts addressed.
The view from the mountaintop before the climb.

**Structure**
Section-by-section preview showing how the chapter unfolds.
The logic of Longchenpa's presentation.
Key transitions and turning points.

**Practice Relevance**
Why this chapter matters for realization.
How these teachings manifest in meditation and daily life.
The bridge between text and experience.

**Key Terms**
Essential terminology introduced or emphasized in this chapter.
Brief definitions to orient the reader.

## Placement in the Corpus

The Introduction Layer appears in:
- **Opus 1/2** (Practitioner Corpus): Before each chapter's liturgical text

It does not appear in:
- Source Corpus (Opus 3/4): Source materials are unadorned
- Scholar Corpus (Opus 5/6): Scholars navigate by different means
- Mind Corpus (Opus 7/8): Cognitive layer stands alone

## Relationship to Commentary

Introduction and Commentary serve different functions:

**Introduction:**
- Pre-reading orientation
- High-level structural overview
- Preparation for engagement
- Chapter-level perspective

**Commentary:**
- Line-by-line engagement
- Detailed unpacking of meaning
- Pointing to recognition
- Section-level depth

Read the Introduction before the chapter to know where you are going.
Read the Commentary during the chapter to understand what you are
seeing.

## Editorial Standards

**Accuracy**
All summaries are grounded in the Tibetan source and verified against
the text itself. No generalizations that cannot be traced to specific
passages.

**Accessibility**
Technical terms are introduced gently. Concepts are explained in
context. The introductions assume intelligence but not expertise.

**Brevity**
Each introduction is concise—long enough to orient, short enough to
not overwhelm. The text itself is the teacher; the introduction is
the pointing finger.

## Using This Layer

**First Reading**
Read the introduction before diving into the chapter. Let it create
the container for what you will receive.

**Subsequent Study**
Return to the introduction to recall the chapter's arc and connections
to other chapters.

**Teaching Preparation**
Use introductions to structure presentations and guide students
through the text's architecture.
