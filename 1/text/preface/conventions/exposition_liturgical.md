# Editorial Conventions: Liturgical Layer

## What Is the Liturgical Layer?

The Liturgical Layer is the *sgrub pa'i gleng gzhi*—the basis for practice. It transforms grammatical analysis into vajra speech: text meant to be read aloud to invoke the state of realization.

## Purpose and Function

This layer provides:

1. **Elegant Readability:** Flowing English that carries the meaning
2. **Metaphysical Precision:** Every word transmits the Dzogchen view
3. **Rhythmic Resonance:** Cadence suitable for recitation
4. **Transmission Power:** Words that catalyze recognition

## The Voice: Vairotsana, the Supreme Lotsawa

The Liturgical Layer speaks in the voice of **Vairotsana** (8th century)—the supreme Lotsawa of Tibet, translator for Padmasambhava and Śāntarakṣita, who rendered the Dharma from Sanskrit into Tibetan with vajra precision.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Majestic:** Words carry vajra authority and sacred power
- **Elegant:** Sophisticated without being ornate, flowing without being loose
- **Precise:** Never sacrificing metaphysical accuracy for style
- **Transmissive:** Direct pointing to the nature of mind through vajra speech
- **Rhythmic:** Cadence suitable for recitation, invoking the state described

**The Supreme Lotsawa:**
Vairotsana (c. 8th century) was Tibet's first great translator, sent by King Trisong Detsen to India to bring back the Dharma. He received teachings directly from Padmasambhava and Shri Singha. His translations established the standard for Tibetan Dharma literature—precise, elegant, and transmission-quality.

**Sacred Function:**
This is not merely translation. It is **transformation of syntax into transmission.** The aim of the Liturgical Layer is generating the Dzogchen state simply by reading with proper attention. Every word vibrates in the subtle body. Every phrase points to rigpa.  It rings. 

## The Balance of Elegance and Precision

**Prime Directive:** Metaphysical precision is non-negotiable. If an elegant word distorts the Dzogchen view, they were discarded for simpler, accurate ones. The View (*lta ba*) is the root; elegance is the flower.  The elegance serves the meaning, never obscures it.

**Example**

Literal:
```
from-primordial pure elaboration all pacified
```

Liturgical:
```
From the primordial pure, where all elaborations cease
```

## Meter and Formatting

The Liturgical Layer integrates meter classification:

**Prose** 
Flowing paragraphs with elevated diction. Natural breath, majestic
resonance.

**Verse** 
Chantable rhythm, solemn beat. Strict 1:1 line mapping with Tibetan.
No rhyme (which creates conceptual closure). Resonant cadence.

**Ornament** 
Headings, markers, symbols. Preserved with minimal translation.

**Mantra** 
Sacred syllables. Transliterated only, never translated.

## Line Numbering

For publication, every 10th line is marked:

```
From the primordial pure, where all elaborations cease || 10 ||
```

This enables precise cross-reference with:
- Tibetan source (eg. line 10)
- Commentary (eg. lines 8-12)

## Strict 1:1 Line Count

**Every Tibetan line = exactly ONE liturgical line.**

No splitting. No combining. The line count matches the Tibetan Layer exactly. This preserves:
- Structural correspondence
- Cross-reference accuracy
- Textual integrity

## Capitalization 

**Some Words Always Capitalized:**
- Buddha, Samantabhadra, Padmasambhava
- Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmāṇakāya
- Ground, View, Path, Fruition
- Proper names and titles

**Some Never Capitalized:**
- rigpa, awareness (unless title)
- mind, consciousness
- ordinary terms

**Some Context-Dependent:**
- buddha (generic) vs Buddha (Śākyamuni)

## Sacred Function

This is not merely translation. The aspiration was **transformation of syntax into transmission.** The Liturgical Layer aim is to be capable of generating the Dzogchen state simply by being read with proper attention. Every word vibrates in the subtle body. Every phrase points to rigpa.
