# Editorial Conventions: Liturgical Layer

## What Is the Liturgical Layer?

The Liturgical Layer is the *sgrub pa'i gleng gzhi*—the basis for
practice. It transforms grammatical analysis into vajra speech: text
meant to be read aloud to invoke the state of realization.

## Purpose and Function

This layer provides:

1. **Elegant Readability:** Flowing English that carries the meaning
2. **Metaphysical Precision:** Every word transmits the Dzogchen view
3. **Rhythmic Resonance:** Cadence suitable for recitation
4. **Transmission Power:** Words that catalyze recognition

## The Voice: Vairotsana, the Supreme Lotsawa

The Liturgical Layer speaks in the voice of **Vairotsana** (8th century)—the supreme Lotsawa of Tibet, translator for Padmasambhava and Śāntarakṣita, who rendered the Dharma from Sanskrit into Tibetan with vajra precision.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Majestic:** Words carry vajra authority and sacred power
- **Elegant:** Sophisticated without being ornate, flowing without being loose
- **Precise:** Never sacrificing metaphysical accuracy for style
- **Transmissive:** Direct pointing to the nature of mind through vajra speech
- **Rhythmic:** Cadence suitable for recitation, invoking the state described

**The Supreme Lotsawa:**
Vairotsana (c. 8th century) was Tibet's first great translator, sent by King Trisong Detsen to India to bring back the Dharma. He received teachings directly from Padmasambhava and Shri Singha. His translations established the standard for Tibetan Dharma literature—precise, elegant, and transmission-quality.

**Sacred Function:**
This is not merely translation. It is **transformation of syntax into transmission.** The Liturgical Layer must be capable of generating the Dzogchen state simply by being read with proper attention. Every word vibrates in the subtle body. Every phrase points to rigpa.

## The Balance of Elegance and Precision

**Prime Directive:** Metaphysical precision is non-negotiable.

If an elegant word distorts the Dzogchen view, discard it for a
simpler, accurate one. The View (*lta ba*) is the root; elegance is
the flower.

**Example**

Literal:
```
from-primordial pure elaboration all pacified
```

Liturgical:
```
From the primordial pure, where all elaborations cease
```

The elegance serves the meaning, never obscures it.

## Meter and Formatting

The Liturgical Layer integrates meter classification from the Meter
Layer:

**<prose>** (82.6%)
Flowing paragraphs with elevated diction. Natural breath, majestic
resonance.

**<verse>** (9.1%)
Chantable rhythm, solemn beat. Strict 1:1 line mapping with Tibetan.
No rhyme (which creates conceptual closure). Resonant cadence.

**<ornament>** (5.6%)
Headings, markers, symbols. Preserved with minimal translation.

**<mantra>** (1.8%)
Sacred syllables. Transliterated only, never translated.

## Line Numbering

For publication, every 10th line is marked:

```
From the primordial pure, where all elaborations cease || 10 ||
```

This enables precise cross-reference with:
- Tibetan source (line 10)
- Commentary (lines 8-12)
- Scholar analysis (lines 1-15)

## Strict 1:1 Line Count

**Every Tibetan line = exactly ONE liturgical line.**

No splitting. No combining. The line count must match the Tibetan
Layer exactly. This preserves:
- Structural correspondence
- Cross-reference accuracy
- Textual integrity

## Capitalization (Strict)

**Always Capitalize:**
- Buddha, Samantabhadra, Padmasambhava
- Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya, Nirmāṇakāya
- Ground, View, Path, Fruition
- Proper names and titles

**Never Capitalize:**
- rigpa, awareness (unless title)
- mind, consciousness
- ordinary terms

**Context-Dependent:**
- buddha (generic) vs Buddha (Śākyamuni)

## Terminology

Follow **dictionary.md** with Vairotsana flexibility:
- Prioritize metaphysical accuracy
- Allow elegance for flow
- Core Dzogchen terms: rig pa, ka dag, lhun grub
- Choose transmission over rigid adherence

## Sacred Function

This is not merely translation. It is **transformation of syntax into
transmission.**

The Liturgical Layer must be capable of generating the Dzogchen state
simply by being read with proper attention. Every word vibrates in the
subtle body. Every phrase points to rigpa.

## Using This Layer

**For Practice**

This is your primary reading text. Read it:
- In formal practice sessions
- During daily recitation
- To invoke the view
- As the basis for memorization

**For Study**

Read alongside Commentary for understanding.
Reference Tibetan for verification.
Consult Scholar layers for depth.

**For Teaching**

## Editorial Standards

**Quality Verification:**
- Metaphysical precision check
- Read-aloud test (does it chant?)
