## What Is the Wylie Layer?

The Wylie Layer serves as the *Lam*—the Bridge—between Tibetan script
and English translation. It provides a precise Extended Wylie
transliteration that enables readers to parse Tibetan syllables even
without knowledge of Tibetan script.

## The Voice: The Mechanical Bridge

The Wylie Layer has **no human voice**—it is mechanically generated by algorithm (pyewts), serving as the *Lam*—the structural bridge—between Tibetan script and English translation. This is not interpretation; it is transliteration.

**Characteristics:**
- **Mechanical:** Generated by pyewts software, not written by humans
- **Structural:** Represents orthography, not pronunciation
- **Transparent:** One-to-one character mapping
- **Reference:** Tool for parsing, not for meaning

**Not a Voice:** Unlike all other layers, the Wylie Layer does not speak with personality, perspective, or purpose. It simply transforms Tibetan Unicode into Extended Wylie notation.

## Purpose and Function

While the Tibetan Layer presents the sacred source, the Wylie Layer
offers:

1. **Structural Clarity:** Syllable boundaries are explicit
2. **Searchability:** Wylie is ASCII-compatible and searchable
3. **Learning Aid:** Students can correlate script with pronunciation
4. **Technical Reference:** For database and computational processing

## Generation Method

The Wylie Layer was generated using **pyewts** (Python Extended Wylie
Transliteration System), which provides:
- 99% accurate mechanical transliteration
- Proper handling of stacked consonants
- Accurate representation of Tibetan orthography
- Consistent output across the entire corpus

## Editorial Status

**This layer is mechanically generated and preserved.**

Unlike interpretive layers, the Wylie Layer is not "written" but
"transliterated." It represents the direct transformation of Tibetan
Unicode characters into their Wylie equivalents according to the
Extended Wylie Transliteration Scheme.

**If the Tibetan and Wylie disagree, the Tibetan is correct.**

## Limitations and Use

**Structural, Not Phonetic**

Wylie transliteration represents Tibetan orthography, not Tibetan
pronunciation. For example:
- Tibetan: སྐྱོངས
- Wylie: skyongs
- Pronunciation: kyong (the 's' is silent)

**Reference Only**

Use the Wylie Layer to:
- Verify syllable boundaries
- Look up terms in dictionaries
- Parse grammatical structures
- Cross-reference with scholarly sources

Do not use Wylie to:
- Determine pronunciation (use oral transmission)
- Translate meaning (use Literal/Liturgical layers)
- Establish doctrinal points (use Tibetan layer)

## File Format

**Naming Convention**

Files follow: `VV-CC-SS-SS.txt`

**Line Structure**

```
[1] /theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod/
[2] /ces bya ba bzhugs/
```

Each line is prefixed with its line number, matching the Tibetan Layer
exactly. The Wylie text follows, enclosed in forward slashes.

## Relationship to Other Layers

Tibetan → Wylie → [All English Layers]

The Wylie Layer serves as a structural guide for the interpretive
layers. Translators may consult it for parsing, but all meaning must
ultimately derive from the Tibetan Layer itself.

## Using This Layer

**For Students of Tibetan**

The Wylie Layer provides a bridge between script you cannot yet read
and the meaning you seek. Use it alongside the Tibetan to build your
recognition of characters and syllables.

**For Scholars**

Wylie enables:
- Precise citation and search
- Database integration
- Computational analysis
- Cross-reference with academic sources

**For Practitioners**

Most practitioners will not need this layer unless they are studying
Tibetan language. For Dharma practice, see the Liturgical and
Commentary layers.

## Technical Notes

**pyewts Library**

The transliteration was performed using pyewts version 1.0+, which
follows the Extended Wylie Transliteration Scheme established by
Turrell Wylie (1959) with contemporary extensions for Unicode Tibetan.

**Verification**

While mechanically generated, the Wylie output was spot-checked
against the Tibetan to ensure proper handling of:
- Complex stacks (e.g., སྒྲོན → sgron)
- Vowel markers (e.g., ཨི → i, ཨུ → u)
- Special characters (e.g., ༀ → oṃ, ཨྃ → aṃ)
