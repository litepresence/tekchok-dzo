# Editorial Conventions: Wylie Layer

## What Is the Wylie Layer?

The Wylie Layer serves as the *Lam*—the Bridge—between Tibetan script and English translation. It provides a precise Extended Wylie transliteration that enables readers to parse Tibetan syllables even without knowledge of Tibetan script.

## The Voice: The Mechanical Bridge

The Wylie Layer was mechanically generated, serving as the *Lam*—the structural bridge—between Tibetan script and English translation. This is not interpretation; it is transliteration.  

**Characteristics:**
- **Mechanical:** Generated by pyewts software
- **Structural:** Represents orthography, not pronunciation
- **Transparent:** One-to-one character mapping
- **Reference:** Tool for parsing, not for meaning

**Not a Voice:** Unlike all other layers, the Wylie Layer does not speak with personality, perspective, or purpose. It simply transforms Tibetan Unicode into Extended Wylie notation.

## Purpose and Function

While the Tibetan Layer presents the sacred source, the Wylie Layer offers:

1. **Structural Clarity:** Syllable boundaries are explicit
2. **Searchability:** Wylie is ASCII-compatible and searchable
3. **Learning Aid:** Students can correlate script with pronunciation
4. **Technical Reference:** For database and computational processing

## Generation Method

The Wylie Layer was generated using **pyewts** (Python Extended Wylie Transliteration System), which provides:
- 99% accurate mechanical transliteration
- Proper handling of stacked consonants
- Accurate representation of Tibetan orthography
- Consistent output across the entire corpus
The Wylie Layer was then lightly polished by Kimi K2.5 in context.  


## Limitations and Use

**Structural, Not Phonetic**

Wylie transliteration represents Tibetan orthography, not Tibetan pronunciation. For example:
- Tibetan: སྐྱོངས
- Wylie: skyongs
- Pronunciation: kyong (the 's' is silent)

**Reference Only**

Use the Wylie Layer to:
- Verify syllable boundaries
- Look up terms in dictionaries
- Parse grammatical structures
- Cross-reference with scholarly sources

Do not use Wylie to:
- Determine pronunciation (use oral transmission)
- Translate meaning (use Literal/Liturgical layers)
- Establish doctrinal points (use Tibetan layer)

## Relationship to Other Layers

Tibetan → Wylie → [All English Layers]

The Wylie Layer serves as a structural guide for the interpretive layers. Translators may consult it for parsing, but all meaning must ultimately derive from the Tibetan Layer itself.

## Using This Layer

**For Students of Tibetan**

The Wylie Layer provides a bridge between script you cannot yet read and the meaning you seek. Use it alongside the Tibetan to build your recognition of characters and syllables.

**For Scholars**

Wylie enables:
- Precise citation and search
- Database integration
- Computational analysis
- Cross-reference with academic sources

**For Practitioners**

Most Western practitioners will not need this layer unless they are studying Tibetan language. For Dharma practice, see the Liturgical and Commentary layers.

## Methodology Note

The Wylie Layer was generated using **pyewts** (Python Extended Wylie Transliteration System), which provides 99% accurate mechanical transliteration. The Wylie Layer was then lightly polished by Kimi K2.5 in context.

**What the AI Did:**
- Contextual polishing of mechanical output
- Consistency verification across 213 sections

**What the Human Did:**
- Software selection and configuration
- Quality verification of sample sections
- Final editorial review

**Result:**
Mechanically generated Wylie transliteration, AI-polished in context, human-reviewed. One transliteration among many possible.

**Use it as:** Reference tool, parsing aid, technical resource
**Not as:** Phonetic guide, definitive transliteration, pronunciation authority
