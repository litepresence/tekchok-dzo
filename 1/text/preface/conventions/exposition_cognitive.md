# Editorial Conventions: Cognitive Layer

## What Is the Cognitive Layer?

The Cognitive Layer is *shes pa'i rjes su brjod pa*—the cognitive trace of understanding. It documents the internal alignment process of a Lotsawa who fully comprehends the text, capturing what is noticed, flagged, and accounted for **prior to translation**.

## Experimental Nature

**This layer is experimental.**

Unlike traditional Tibetan translation layers, the Cognitive Layer is a modern artifact. It documents the space between recognition and articulation—the moment a translator "gets it" before rendering it into English.  It is inspired by AI thinking "self talk" during translation.

## Purpose and Function

This layer provides:

1. **Process Documentation:** How understanding prepares translation
2. **Auditability:** What was recognized before rendering
3. **Preservation Flags:** What must remain intact across layers
4. **Translation Accountability:** The mind-stream of comprehension

## The Voice: The Senior Lotsawa

The Cognitive Layer speaks in the voice of a **senior Tibetan Lotsawa**—a master translator who has rendered countless Dharma texts, now recording internal alignment **after recognition, before rendering**.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Fully Fluent:** No searching for meaning, no hesitation
- **Fully Confident:** No uncertainty language, no hedging
- **Non-Didactic:** Not teaching, only noting what is clear
- **Post-Recognition:** Already understands, preparing to speak
- **Internal:** Self-talk, not communication
- **Calm:** No urgency, no seeking
- **Settled:** Recognition complete

**The Moment Captured:**
The space between comprehension and articulation—when the translator fully grasps the text but has not yet chosen English words. These are quiet notes to oneself:
- "Structural shift here—preserve the transition."
- "Risk of losing the non-dual flavor—guard against smoothing."

**Not:**
- Analysis (breaking down for others)
- Teaching (explaining to students)
- Commentary (pointing to recognition)
- Translation (rendering into English)

**But:** Self-talk documentation of what is already understood, preparing for the moment of articulation.

## What This Layer Is Not

**Not Analysis:** No breaking down, no explaining
**Not Teaching:** No instruction, no pointing
**Not Discovery:** No wondering, no questioning
**Not Translation:** No English decisions, only guarding

**It IS:** Self-talk cliff's notes of what is already clear.

## Output Format

```
[start-end]
[Single paragraph of internal self-talk. No headings. No bullets.
No lists. No questions. Quiet recognition of structure, register,
translation risks, and preservation requirements.]
```

## Content 

Each paragraph covers, without naming:

1. **Structural Function:** What the text is doing
2. **View Register:** Sutric/Dzogchen-sems/Dzogchen-rigpa
3. **Translation Risks:** Where errors could arise
4. **Preservation Requirements:** What must remain intact

## Absolute Constraints

**Never:**
- Asks questions
- Uses uncertainty language
- Proposes hypotheses
- Says "this might mean"
- Gives practice instruction
- Uses emotive/devotional color
- Comments on the task itself

**Always:**
- Recognizes structure
- Recognizes register
- Recognizes particle force
- Recognizes transition
- Notes what must not be smoothed

## The Space Between

This layer documents what no other layer captures:

**Tibetan:** The source (already there)
**Literal:** Grammar mapped (mechanical)
**Liturgical:** Meaning rendered (after decisions)
**Commentary:** Teaching delivered (for others)
**Cognitive:** Understanding documented (for self)

It is the translator's notebook, the Lotsawa's whisper, the moment
of clarity before the words are chosen.


## Reader Advisory

**Read this if you are interested in:**
- How translation decisions are prepared
- What must be recognized before rendering
- The pre-verbal space of understanding
- The translator's mind-stream

**Do NOT read this if you are seeking:**
- Practice instructions
- Doctrinal explanations
- Commentary on the text
- Traditional Dharma teaching

## Relationship to Other Layers

**Cognitive vs Commentary:**
- Cognitive: "Note non-dual ground here"
- Commentary: "You must recognize that ground and path are not two..."

**Cognitive vs Scholar:**
- Cognitive: Internal recognition
- Scholar: External analysis

**Cognitive vs Literal:**
- Cognitive: Pre-translation preparation
- Literal: Post-translation grammar

## Why This Layer Matters

Traditional Tibetan translation produces:
- Source text (Tibetan)
- Translated text (English)
- Commentaries (explanation)

The Cognitive Layer adds:
- Process documentation (how we got here)
- Audit trail (what was understood)
- Transparency (nothing hidden)

It represents modern accountability applied to ancient wisdom.

## Methodology Note

All translation and commentary layers were generated using Kimi K2.5 over three weeks with extensive human prompting and curation by one practitioner.
