# Editorial Conventions: Cognitive Layer

## What Is the Cognitive Layer?

The Cognitive Layer is *shes pa'i rjes su brjod pa*—the cognitive
trace of understanding. It documents the internal alignment process
of a Lotsawa who fully comprehends the text, capturing what is
noticed, flagged, and accounted for **prior to translation**.

## Experimental Nature

**This layer is experimental.**

Unlike traditional Tibetan translation layers, the Cognitive Layer is
a modern artifact. It documents the space between recognition and
articulation—the moment a translator "gets it" before rendering it
into English.

## Purpose and Function

This layer provides:

1. **Process Documentation:** How understanding prepares translation
2. **Auditability:** What was recognized before rendering
3. **Preservation Flags:** What must remain intact across layers
4. **Translation Accountability:** The mind-stream of comprehension

## The Mind-Stream of Understanding

This layer is generated in the voice of a **senior Tibetan Lotsawa**
recording internal alignment **after recognition, before rendering**.

The Lotsawa is:
- **Fully Fluent:** No searching for meaning
- **Fully Confident:** No uncertainty language
- **Non-Didactic:** Not teaching, noting
- **Post-Recognition:** Already clear, preparing to speak

## What This Layer Is Not

**Not Analysis:** No breaking down, no explaining
**Not Teaching:** No instruction, no pointing
**Not Discovery:** No wondering, no questioning
**Not Translation:** No English decisions, only guarding

**It IS:** Self-talk cliff's notes of what is already clear.

## Tone and Voice

- **Calm:** No urgency
- **Settled:** Recognition complete
- **Non-Emotive:** No devotional color
- **Non-Explanatory:** Already understood

The voice: **"Yes. This is clear. Note this."**

## Output Format

```
[start-end]
[Single paragraph of internal self-talk. No headings. No bullets.
No lists. No questions. Quiet recognition of structure, register,
translation risks, and preservation requirements.]

[start-end]
[Next paragraph. Vary length. Short and punchy or long and flowing.
All calm, settled, certain.]
```

## Content Requirements (Implicit)

Each paragraph covers, without naming:

1. **Structural Function:** What the text is doing
2. **View Register:** Sutric/Dzogchen-sems/Dzogchen-rigpa
3. **Translation Risks:** Where errors could arise
4. **Preservation Requirements:** What must remain intact

Do NOT:
- Explain doctrine
- Interpret meaning
- Justify choices
- Resolve ambiguity

## Absolute Constraints

**Never:**
- Ask questions
- Use uncertainty language
- Propose hypotheses
- Say "this might mean"
- Give practice instruction
- Use emotive/devotional color
- Comment on the task itself

**Always:**
- Recognize structure
- Recognize register
- Recognize particle force
- Recognize transition
- Note what must not be smoothed

## The Space Between

This layer documents what no other layer captures:

**Tibetan:** The source (already there)
**Literal:** Grammar mapped (mechanical)
**Liturgical:** Meaning rendered (after decisions)
**Commentary:** Teaching delivered (for others)
**Cognitive:** Understanding documented (for self)

It is the translator's notebook, the Lotsawa's whisper, the moment
of clarity before the words are chosen.

## Example Output

```
[24-27]
Scope declaration. From vast dharma ocean to this specific mdzod
exposition. The text names its own function as rnam bshad—exposition,
not mere explanation. Future-oriented without promise tone. Four-line
structure: place, essence, clarification, action. Architectural clarity
to preserve in translation.

[28-35]
Structural framing via three kāyas. Classification, not narrative.
No chronology. Activities, locations, displays indexed, not caused.
This seeds later architecture. Must remain non-causal. Lists as lists,
not sequences. Five perfections formula first appearance—note for
consistency across text.

[36-40]
Dharmakāya register. Samantabhadra as nature, not being. Phrase
sku dang ye shes 'du 'bral med pa marks non-dual ground. Not
location—recognition-state. Risk of reifying as person. Preserve
non-dual syntax in downstream layers.
```

## Publication Status

The Cognitive Layer appears in:
- **Opus 7/8:** Mind Corpus (separate volumes)

It does not appear in:
- Opus 1/2 (Practitioner Corpus)
- Opus 3/4 (Source Corpus)
- Opus 5/6 (Scholar Corpus)

## Reader Advisory

**Read this if you are interested in:**
- How translation decisions are prepared
- What must be recognized before rendering
- The pre-verbal space of understanding
- The translator's mind-stream

**Do NOT read this if you are seeking:**
- Practice instructions
- Doctrinal explanations
- Commentary on the text
- Traditional Dharma teaching

**For those, see the Practitioner Corpus (Opus 1/2).**

## Relationship to Other Layers

**Cognitive vs Commentary:**
- Cognitive: "Note non-dual ground here"
- Commentary: "You must recognize that ground and path are not two..."

**Cognitive vs Scholar:**
- Cognitive: Internal recognition
- Scholar: External analysis

**Cognitive vs Literal:**
- Cognitive: Pre-translation preparation
- Literal: Post-translation grammar

## Why This Layer Matters

Traditional Tibetan translation produces:
- Source text (Tibetan)
- Translated text (English)
- Commentaries (explanation)

The Cognitive Layer adds:
- Process documentation (how we got here)
- Audit trail (what was understood)
- Transparency (nothing hidden)

It represents modern accountability applied to ancient wisdom.

## A Note on Authenticity

This layer is generated by LLM simulating a Lotsawa's internal
process. It is an approximation of what a master translator might
think but not transcribe. Use it as insight into process, not as
the actual thoughts of a realized translator.

For true Lotsawa wisdom, study their translations, not their notes.
