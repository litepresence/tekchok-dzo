## ⚠️ RESTRICTED TEXT — SOURCE MATERIALS

**This corpus contains source materials for an unauthorized translation.**

The *Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle* (Theg mchog rin po che'i mdzod) by Longchenpa is a restricted text containing advanced Dzogchen teachings. These source materials are provided for verification and study purposes.

**You are accessing:**
- Tibetan Unicode text from BDRC archives
- Wylie transliteration for grammatical analysis
- Literal English rendering for syntactic mapping

**Use responsibly.** Seek qualified teachers for practices requiring transmission.

## Why This Volume Exists

Every translation rests on a foundation. This is that foundation—the ground of verification.

Previous translations of the Treasury have been partial (Davidson, Germano) or circulated privately. None provided complete source materials for independent verification. This corpus fills that gap: complete Tibetan text, Wylie transliteration, and literal grammatical rendering for all 213 sections.

## The Three Source Layers

**Tibetan Layer (*Tshad ma*)**

Unicode Tibetan prepared from:
- Volume 1: UT22920_005_0001_bo,sa,zh.txt (BDRC)
- Volume 2: UT22920_005_0002_bo,sa,zh.txt (BDRC)

These are the Derge edition texts, verified against Nyingma edition variants. Every character preserved. Every line numbered 1:1 with interpretive layers.

This is the ground of validity for the entire project.

**Wylie Layer (*Lam*)**

Extended Wylie transliteration (THL standard) via pyewts:
- 99% accuracy (mechanically verified)
- Enables grammatical analysis without reading Tibetan script
- Allows database search and computational processing
- Provides precise citation and cross-reference

Reference only—Tibetan is the authoritative source.

**Literal Layer (*Dpyad kyi bshad pa*)**

Grammatical instrument mapping Tibetan syntax onto English:
- Tibetan word order preserved
- Particle functions (*kyis*, *las*, *la*) maintained
- Compound hyphenation
- Article omission
- Grammatical ambiguity preserved

This is not a reading text. It sacrifices English fluency to expose Tibetan structure—the scaffold upon which the Liturgical translation was built.

## Collation Format

```
[1]
༄༅།
/theg pa'i mchog/
Supreme-Vehicle

[2]
ཐེག་པའི་མཆོག་རིན་པོ་ཆེའི་མཛོད།
/theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod/

```

Tibetan line → Wylie → Literal. Instant comparison across all three layers.

## Methodology and Transparency

**What This Is:**

Source materials generated and collated over three weeks using:
- BDRC archive texts (UT22920_005_0001/0002)
- pyewts for Wylie transliteration
- Kimi K2.5 (Moonshot AI) for preliminary literal rendering
- Human verification of line count and major grammatical mapping

**What This Means:**

- AI assisted with literal grammatical mapping
- Human judgment verified structure and major alignment
- Wylie generated mechanically with manual spot-checking
- The Tibetan text is authoritative; other layers are tools

**What This Is Not:**

- Not an official BDRC publication
- Not reviewed by institutional scholars
- Not guaranteed error-free (though verification was attempted)
- Not a substitute for studying with qualified teachers

**Source Verification:**
- BDRC Work IDs: UT22920_005_0001, UT22920_005_0002
- Edition: Derge (comparative review with Nyingma variants)
- Line numbering: 1:1 across all layers
- Status: Immutable (locked at publication)

## For Whom This Corpus Is Intended

**Translators**

You are rendering Longchenpa into other languages. This corpus provides ground truth. Verify your choices against the Literal scaffold. Reference the Tibetan for ambiguous passages. Challenge our choices—improve upon them.

**Scholars**

You are researching Tibetan Buddhism, Nyingma doxography, or Dzogchen philosophy. This corpus enables:
- Philological precision
- Comparative textual analysis
- Verification of published translations
- Independent scholarly work grounded in the source

**Students of Tibetan**

You are learning classical Tibetan. This corpus provides:
- Authentic text at appropriate difficulty
- Wylie support for character recognition
- Literal layer for grammatical understanding
- Progression from Wylie to Tibetan to meaning

Start with Wylie when stuck. Check against Literal. Gradually reduce reliance as recognition improves.

**Practitioners (Secondary)**

The Practitioner Corpus provides readable liturgical text. Reference this corpus to:
- Verify specific translations
- Understand grammatical nuances
- Connect to Tibetan terminology
- Deepen relationship with the source

## How to Use This Corpus

**For Translation Work:**

1. Read the Tibetan line
2. Parse with Wylie if script is unclear
3. Check Literal for grammatical mapping
4. Compare with your own rendering
5. Resolve ambiguities by returning to Tibetan

**For Scholarly Research:**

Use Wylie for searchable database queries. Cite Tibetan for academic publications. Reference Literal for grammatical analysis. The variant readings documented here may prove useful for stemmatic work.

**For Language Study:**

Work through Tibetan line by line. Use Wylie when stuck. Build understanding from syntax outward. There is no substitute for wrestling with the original.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS

**Restricted Text:** These are source materials for a restricted text containing advanced Dzogchen teachings. Use responsibly.

**Unauthorized:** This compilation was created without institutional approval or BDRC endorsement.

**AI-Assisted:** The Literal layer was generated with AI assistance (Kimi K2.5). Human verification focused on structural alignment, not perfect grammatical accuracy.

**One Person's Work:** Compiled by one practitioner over three weeks, not by an editorial board or translation committee.

**Not Definitive:** This is one interpretation of the source. Other readings are possible. The Tibetan text remains authoritative.

## What Source Cannot Provide

Even perfect source materials cannot prevent imperfect understanding. The Tibetan text is authoritative, but your reading is always interpretation.

The realization Longchenpa points to cannot be found in any text. It is in your own mind. These words merely point the way.
