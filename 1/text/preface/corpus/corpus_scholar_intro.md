## The Problem This Corpus Addresses

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle has been mistranslated repeatedly—not through malice, but because readers collapse Longchenpa's carefully stratified viewpoints into confusion. They mistake Sutric logic for Dzogchen realization. They reduce Tantric symbolism to ontology. They fail to recognize when Longchenpa is teaching, negating, distinguishing, or revealing.

This corpus provides analytical tools to read Longchenpa more carefully.

## Three Analytical Layers

**The Scholar Layer: Four Pillars**

Analysis through four lenses applied to all 213 sections:

*Structure* — Architectural mapping: major divisions (*rim khang*), topical subdivisions (*sa bcad*), logical progression, connections between sections.

*Philology* — Grammatical precision: particle function (*kyis*, *las*, *la*), terminology in Wylie with semantic field, manuscript notes, syntax and clause relationships.

*Context* — Doxographical placement: citations from tantras and sutras, vehicle classification, Nyingma vs Sarma distinctions, voice identification.

*Concept* — Philosophical unpacking: complex enumerations, relationships between terms, sub-parts, doctrinal precision.

**The Epistemic Layer: View-Stratification**

Longchenpa speaks from multiple epistemic registers—sometimes within a single paragraph. This layer classifies:
- Which view each passage employs (Sutric, Tantric, Dzogchen-sems, Dzogchen-rigpa)
- Pedagogical function (upāya, negation, declaration)
- Risk flags for misinterpretation

This is air-traffic control for hermeneutics.

**The Delusion Layer: Error Cartography**

Maps predictable misinterpretations across 213 sections:
- Specific misreadings named and described
- Cognitive attractors (why errors feel right)
- Consequence mapping (what degrades if adopted)
- Cascade analysis (how errors breed errors)

The Delusion Layer is clinical and stark. Wrong view in Dzogchen blocks liberation.

Comprehensive analysis of each textual unit while maintaining navigability.

## Methodology and Transparency

**What This Is:**

Scholarly analysis generated over three weeks using Kimi K2.5 (Moonshot AI) with extensive human prompting, curation, and refinement by one practitioner with background in computer programming and quantitative analysis.

The AI handled preliminary analysis and consistency maintenance across 213 sections. Human judgment guided:
- Voice and tone calibration
- Doctrinal accuracy checks against traditional sources
- Quality assessment against multiple criteria
- Final curation and refinement

**What This Means:**

- This is one person's interpretation using AI assistance
- Analysis draws on traditional sources (commentaries, doxographies)
- Not reviewed by academic peers or lineage institutions
- Represents a practitioner's understanding, not institutional doctrine

**What This Is Not:**

- Not peer-reviewed academic scholarship
- Not verified by a panel of Tibetologists
- Not authorized by any Buddhist institution
- Not a substitute for studying with qualified teachers

**Scope:**
- 213 sections analyzed
- Four Pillars methodology applied throughout
- 27 error types classified
- View stratification (9 yanas) documented

## For Whom This Corpus Is Intended

**Independent Scholars**

You are researching Tibetan Buddhism without institutional affiliation. This corpus provides:
- One analytical perspective on textual architecture
- Doctrinal mapping (one interpretation among many possible)
- Error classification framework
- Starting point for your own analysis

Verify all claims against the Source Corpus. Challenge interpretations. Improve upon them.

**Advanced Practitioners**

You have foundational Dzogchen training and seek deeper textual understanding. This corpus offers:
- Terminological precision (one rendering of technical terms)
- Historical context (one interpretation of doxography)
- Protection against misinterpretation (common errors mapped)
- Grounding in textual analysis (one approach to the source)

Cross-reference with Commentary for experiential understanding. Neither layer alone is sufficient.

**Students of Dzogchen**

You are studying the view and need analytical support. This corpus answers "What does this say?" so Commentary can answer "What does this mean?"

**Teachers**

You are transmitting these teachings. This corpus provides:
- One perspective on structural points
- Common errors to warn students about
- Doctrinal context (one interpretation)
- Analytical framework for explaining subtle distinctions

You remain responsible for accuracy and authenticity.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL LIMITATIONS

**One Person's Work:** This analysis was produced by one practitioner using AI assistance over three weeks. It does not represent scholarly consensus or institutional authority.

**Not Peer-Reviewed:** No academic board has verified these claims. No lineage holder has authorized this interpretation.

**AI-Assisted:** The analytical framework was generated with Kimi K2.5. Human judgment guided direction and curation, but AI handled much of the detailed analysis.

**Interpretive, Not Definitive:** This is one reading of Longchenpa. Other readings are possible and may be more accurate.

**Restricted Text:** This is analysis of a restricted text containing advanced Dzogchen teachings. Use responsibly.

**No Practice Authorization:** This corpus presents analysis, not instruction. For practice guidance, seek qualified teachers.

## Editorial Standards (As Applied)

**Objectivity:**
Maintains analytical distance. Does not offer practice advice. Observes and maps without prescribing.

**Neutrality:**
Classifies without endorsing. Maps viewpoints without claiming ultimate truth.

**Clinical Precision:**
The Delusion Layer is stark because errors are stark. We do not soften language because consequences are real.

**Transparency:**
Methodology disclosed. AI assistance acknowledged. Limitations stated clearly.

## What This Corpus Cannot Do

This corpus presents scholarly analysis, not Dharma instruction:
- The Epistemic Layer classifies views without endorsing them
- The Delusion Layer maps errors without correcting them (the text does that)
- The Scholar Layer analyzes structure without prescribing practice

For practice guidance, see Commentary. For direct transmission, seek qualified teachers.

This corpus provides one map. The territory is your own mind. You must traverse it yourself.
