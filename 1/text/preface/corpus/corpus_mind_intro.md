## ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL DOCUMENTATION — RESTRICTED SOURCE

**This corpus documents the translation process for an unauthorized rendering of a restricted text.**

The Cognitive Layer presents notes, hesitations, and provisional recognitions from one practitioner's engagement with Longchenpa's text. These are working notes, not finished doctrine.

**This is:**
- One person's translation workbook
- Process transparency documentation
- Experimental genre (translator's notes published)

**This is not:**
- Official process documentation
- Definitive interpretive authority
- Substitute for teacher guidance

Use as insight into one approach. Verify everything against the source.

## What This Corpus Documents

Translation involves a sequence: encounter with source, recognition of meaning, choice of words. Traditional scholarship documents the ends—the Tibetan text and the English rendering. What disappears is the middle: the moment of understanding itself.

This corpus preserves that middle space.

The Cognitive Layer presents one translator's engagement with Longchenpa—not the polished final translation, but the notes, hesitations, recognitions, and decisions that precede it. This is a working notebook: rough, provisional, uncertain in places, occasionally wrong before being corrected.

## The Content of Recognition

Each entry covers:
- **Structural function** — What the text is doing at this point
- **View register** — Which epistemic frame (Sutric, Tantric, Dzogchen-sems, Dzogchen-rigpa)
- **Translation risks** — Where errors could arise, what could be lost
- **Preservation requirements** — What must remain intact across the language boundary

This is not:
- Analysis (breaking down meaning for others)
- Teaching (explaining to students)
- Commentary (pointing to recognition)
- Translation (the finished rendering)

It is self-talk. Notes to oneself before words are chosen.

## Why Document the Process?

**For Transparency:**

In an age of machine translation, documenting process provides accountability. Future readers can trace not just what was translated, but what was recognized before translation, what alternatives were considered, what was preserved and transformed.

**For Process Study:**

How does engagement with source text work? What gets noticed? What gets flagged? What must be preserved? This corpus offers insight into a process usually private—the false starts, second guesses, working through confusion.

**For Methodological Disclosure:**

This project commits to radical transparency about methodology. Every layer is documented, including uncertainty, errors, and the AI-assisted process that generated the translation.

## Methodology: How This Was Created

**Timeline:** 3 weeks
**Tools:** Kimi K2.5 (Moonshot AI)
**Human Input:** One practitioner with programming/quant background
**Process:**
- Tibetan text parsed and sectioned
- AI-generated cognitive notes for each section
- Human curation and refinement
- Selection of which notes to preserve
- Organizational structure applied

**What the AI Did:**
- Generated preliminary notes on structure, view, risks, preservation
- Maintained consistency across 213 sections
- Proposed alternatives and hesitations

**What the Human Did:**
- Directed the AI with detailed prompts
- Curated which notes to keep
- Organized the documentation
- Verified major doctrinal points
- Made final judgments on what to publish

**What This Means:**

These are AI-generated notes curated by one practitioner. They represent one engagement with the text, not the "correct" reading or historical translator cognition. The value lies in transparency about process, not in authoritative interpretation.

## The Voice of Recognition

The Cognitive Layer speaks provisionally:
- Calm but not settled (uncertainty acknowledged)
- Non-didactic (noting, not teaching)
- Internal (self-talk, not communication)
- Draft quality (subject to revision)

You will encounter:
- Provisional statements: "Perhaps..." "Maybe..."
- Uncertainties: "Not sure about this section..."
- Alternatives: "Could also be rendered as..."
- Self-corrections: "Wait, no—let me reconsider..."

The voice does not explain doctrine. It recognizes (tentatively) what is understood and prepares for articulation.

## For Whom This Corpus Is Intended

**Translation Process Researchers:**

You are studying how AI-assisted translation happens. This corpus documents:
- One approach to cognitive process documentation
- How AI-generated notes can be curated
- Transparency methods for machine-assisted work

**Hermeneutics Students:**

You are exploring interpretation theory. This corpus provides:
- Concrete examples of pre-interpretive engagement
- Documentation of uncertainty in translation
- One model of translator workbook publication

**Curious Practitioners:**

You want insight into how this translation was made. This corpus shows:
- The process behind the product
- AI-assisted methodology
- One practitioner's working notes

**Not for:** Those seeking practice instructions, doctrinal explanations, or authoritative teaching. See Practitioner Corpus for the actual text.

## How to Use This Corpus

**For Research:**

Study how process documentation works. Compare these notes with final Liturgical renderings. Analyze what was preserved, transformed, or discarded.

**For Process Study:**

Read alongside Source Corpus. Observe what the documentation noticed in Tibetan and how that informed translation choices. Note the hesitations, alternatives, provisional quality.

**For Transparency:**

This corpus demonstrates methodological openness. The notes are rough, unpolished, sometimes uncertain. This is how AI-assisted translation actually happens—not sanitized final product, but messy process leading to it.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL LIMITATIONS

**AI-Generated:** These are AI-generated notes (Kimi 2.5), not human translator's actual thoughts. They simulate cognitive engagement but are computational outputs.

**One Person's Curation:** One practitioner selected and organized these notes over three weeks. Not comprehensive. Not the only possible documentation.

**Not Historical:** These are contemporary notes, not historical translator cognition. We make no claim to represent what historical Lotsawas thought.

**Experimental Genre:** Publishing translator workbooks is unusual. This may or may not prove valuable.

**Restricted Source:** Documentation of restricted Dzogchen text. Use responsibly.

**Not Authoritative:** These notes are provisional and exploratory. Do not treat them as definitive interpretation.

## Relationship to Other Corpora

**Mind vs Practitioner:**
- Mind: Provisional notes on translation decisions
- Practitioner: Final polished text for transmission

**Mind vs Scholar:**
- Mind: Preliminary engagement (internal, uncertain)
- Scholar: Post-verbal analysis (external, structured)

**Mind vs Source:**
- Mind: Engagement with source at level of recognition
- Source: The source text as object

## What This Cannot Do

No process documentation can:
- Replace your own engagement with the source
- Provide definitive interpretations
- Substitute for qualified teacher guidance
- Guarantee correct understanding

These notes point toward the source. They do not replace it. The recognition Longchenpa points to must be found in your own mind.
