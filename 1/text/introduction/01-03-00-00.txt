This chapter transitions from cosmology to the constituents of individual experience. Longchenpa systematically presents the Abhidharma framework of elements, aggregates, and sense-sources that form the basis of conditioned existence. The first section examines the five elements—earth, water, fire, wind, and space—both as outer physical constituents and as inner mental factors.

The second section details the five aggregates (skandhas), distinguishing between those associated with contaminated worldly beings and those associated with noble beings who have transcended the world. The third section analyzes the twelve sense-sources (ayatanas) and eighteen elements, explaining how objects, faculties, and consciousnesses interact to produce experience.

This presentation follows classical Buddhist phenomenology but sets the stage for the Dzogchen critique that will emerge in later chapters. By thoroughly establishing how ordinary minds construct experience through these aggregates and elements, Longchenpa prepares readers to recognize what must be transcended. The distinction between contaminated and uncontaminated aggregates foreshadows the text's ultimate concern: recognizing the nature of mind that is primordially pure despite the overlay of temporary defilements.
