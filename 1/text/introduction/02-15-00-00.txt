## CHAPTER 15: The Elements' Place—Dependent Arising's Nature

**Tibetan:** རིམ་ཁང་བཅོ་ལྔ་པ། (Fifteenth Lecture Hall)  
**Location:** Volume 1 (Latter Volume), Sections 02-15-01-01 through 02-15-03-01  
**Tibetan Lines:** 1-669 (approximate)  
**Total Liturgical Lines:** ~736

This chapter marks the beginning of the **Latter Volume** (phyi ma) of the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, shifting focus from the cosmological and physiological foundations established in the first fourteen chapters to the **systematic analysis of the five elements** ('byung ba lnga) as the basis for both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Longchenpa here presents one of the most comprehensive Dzogchen treatments of dependent arising (rten 'byung), demonstrating how the same five elements that bind beings in cyclic existence become the very basis for liberation when recognized.

The chapter's title references the "**fifteenth division: showing the elements' place**"—indicating this is a pivotal transition point in the text where the practitioner moves from understanding structure to recognizing the **nondual nature** of all phenomena.

## SECTION BREAKDOWN

### **Section 1: 02-15-01-01.txt (505 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Five Great Arisings—Outer and Inner Elements

This extensive opening section presents the **complete framework of the five elements** from a Dzogchen perspective, distinguishing between:

**Outer-Arising (phyi 'byung):**
- Earth, water, fire, wind, space as external phenomena
- These serve as the **basis** (rten) for inner-arising
- Connected as basis and dependent (rten dang brten par 'brel ba)

**Inner-Arising (nang 'byung):**
- The five elements as they manifest within the body-mind
- Five individual dharma-arisings as bases of pure realms
- The **actuality** (dngos) underlying outer appearances

**The Three Types of Five-Arising:**

1. **Five Great Arising** ('byung chen):
   - Possess luminosity-wisdom ( gsal ba'i ye shes)
   - Five colors: white, red, yellow, green, blue
   - Associated with spontaneous presence's display
   - Clear, warm, bright, cool, spacious

2. **Five Small Arising** ('byung chung):
   - Earth, water, fire, wind, space
   - The ordinary elements of conventional reality
   - Support for mind and awareness

3. **Five Pure Arising** (dag pa'i 'byung lnga):
   - Earth without solidity
   - Water without moisture
   - Fire without heat
   - Wind without movement
   - Space without openness
   - The complete cessation of stains

**The Tenfold Presentation of Outer-Arising:**
1. **Essence**: Outer-arising as play of inner-arising's actuality
2. **Definitive terminology**: Seven aspects of great-arising
3. **Purpose**: Functions of each element in body and world
4. **Characteristics**: Solidity, moisture, warmth, movement, openness
5. **Sequence of functions**: Body formation process
6. **Dharma-nature**: Element-wisdom correspondences
7. **Applied meaning**: Connection with inner awareness
8. **Manner of liberation**: Self-liberation of elements
9. **Divisions**: Five sets of five (25 total)
10. **Completeness**: How saṃsāra-nirvāṇa are complete in body-mind

**Key Realization**: 
> "All saṃsāra and nirvāṇa do not move from the expanse of the five-arising; before the five-arising, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa do not arise."

### **Section 2: 02-15-02-01.txt (211 lines)**

4. **All-pervading wind** (khyab byed): Pervades whole body
5. **Compassionless karma wind** (nyon mongs pa can gyi las rlung): Abides between heart and heart-membrane

## THE CHAPTER'S UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION

### **Nondual Element Theory**

Unlike conventional Buddhist or Hindu element theories, this chapter presents:

1. **Same basis, different recognition**: The five elements are the same for buddhas and beings—the difference is recognition
2. **Outer as projection of inner**: External elements are the "play" of internal actuality
3. **Self-liberation, not transformation**: Elements don't need to be purified—they're primordially pure
4. **Completion in body-mind**: All saṃsāra-nirvāṇa complete in this very form

### **The Body as Microcosm**

The chapter presents the **isomorphism** of body and universe:

| Outer Phenomenon | Body Correspondence | Wisdom Aspect |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Earth | Flesh | Dharmakāya |
| Water | Blood | Mirror-like |
| Fire | Warmth | Discriminating |
| Wind | Breath | All-accomplishing |
| Space | Mind | Dharmadhātu |
| Sun/Moon | Eyes | Method/Wisdom |
| Mountains | Body | View |
| Trees | Channels | Path |

### **Integration with Practice**

For practitioners:
- **Element meditation**: Recognizing elements as wisdom-display
- **Wind practice**: Working with the five root winds in completion stage
- **Completion**: All phenomena complete in awareness-expanse

## READING GUIDANCE

### **For Practitioners**

This chapter provides the **elemental basis** for Dzogchen practice:

**Key Points:**
1. Don't reject the elements—recognize their wisdom-nature
2. The body is not an obstacle but the palace of awakening
3. Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa share the same basis—recognition makes the difference
4. The 25 winds are the basis for both confusion and clarity

**Practice Applications:**
- **Element yoga**: Meditating on elements as wisdom-display
- **Wind work**: Completion stage practices with root and branch winds
- **Recognition**: Seeing all form as the play of the five lights
- **Completion**: Resting in the expanse where elements self-liberate

### **For Scholars**

Note the systematic presentation:
- **Abhidharmic foundation**: Standard five elements framework
- **Dzogchen transformation**: Elements as wisdom-display
- **Tantric integration**: Winds, channels, and bindus
- **Nondual conclusion**: Not rejecting or transforming, but recognizing

**Critical Points:**
1. **Not materialism**: Elements are not ultimately real—they're modes of appearance
2. **Not idealism**: Mind doesn't create elements—they arise co-dependently
3. **Not vitalism**: Winds are not life-force—they're wisdom-movement
4. **Not nihilism**: The emptiness of elements is not nonexistence—it's their freedom from limitation

**Comparative Context:**
- **Abhidharma**: Standard five element theory
- **Kālacakra**: Six elements including wisdom
- **Chinese medicine**: Five elements with different correspondences
- **Western esotericism**: Four/five element systems

Dzogchen's uniqueness: The elements are the **display of primordial purity**, not building blocks of reality.

---

## CONNECTION TO CHAPTER 16

Chapter 15 established the **elements and winds** as the basis; Chapter 16 will present the **expanse and wisdom** (dbyings ye) as the awareness-aspect of these same elements. The progression:

- **Chapter 15**: The elements as basis (gzhi)
- **Chapter 16**: The expanse and wisdom as nature (rang bzhin)

This mirrors the ground-path-fruition structure:
1. **Ground**: Five elements as primordially pure
2. **Path**: Recognizing elements as wisdom-display  
3. **Fruition**: Three kayas complete in expanse

**Key Insight**: The elements are not obstacles to overcome—they're the very **display of awakening** itself. Recognition of this is the essence of Dzogchen practice.
