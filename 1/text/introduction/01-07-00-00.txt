## CHAPTER 7: Samaya Commitments

**Tibetan:** རིམ་ཁང་བདུན་པ། (Seventh Lecture Hall)  
**Location:** Volume 1, Sections 01-07-01-01 through 01-07-05-01  
**Tibetan Lines:** 9704-10476  
**Total Liturgical Lines:** ~773

Following the comprehensive presentation of empowerments in Chapter 6, this chapter focuses exclusively on **samaya** (dam tshig)—the sacred commitments that bind the practitioner to the path of Secret Mantra. Longchenpa explains that receiving empowerment without maintaining samaya is like receiving seeds without planting them; the potential for awakening exists but cannot actualize without the proper conditions.

The chapter presents a **hierarchy of samayas** ranging from conventional commitments (rules to be kept) to the supreme samaya of Great Perfection (nature beyond keeping). This progression mirrors the Dzogchen path itself: beginning with discipline, maturing into recognition, culminating in spontaneous presence.

## SECTION BREAKDOWN

### **Section 1: 01-07-01-01.txt (195 lines)**  
**Topic:** Definition and Classification of Samaya

The chapter opens with the fundamental definition and classification of samaya commitments.

**Definition of Samaya:**
<tantra> "Samaya is the binding pledge—the vajra cross, difficult to traverse, certain in aim."

**The Essential Nature:**
<tantra> "Generally, that which is called samaya is the mind itself, unbroken, free from all deception and guile."

**Two-Fold Classification:**
- **Root Samaya** (rtsa ba'i dam tshig): The three—Body, Speech, and Mind
- **Branch Samaya** (yan lag gi dam tshig): Twenty-five specific commitments

**Seven Categories of Samaya:**
<list> 1. **View Samaya** (lta ba'i dam tshig): Maintaining the correct view
<list> 2. **Conduct Samaya** (spyod pa'i dam tshig): Proper tantric conduct
<list> 3. **Practice Samaya** (sgrub pa'i dam tshig): Commitments regarding practice
<list> 4. **Common Samaya** (thun mong gi dam tshig): General commitments
<list> 5. **Body-Speech-Mind Samaya** (sku gsung thugs kyi dam tshig): Specific to three doors
<list> 6. **Branch Enumeration Samaya** (yan lag gi dam tshig): The twenty-five branches
<list> 7. **Crucial Certain Samaya** (gces par nges pa'i dam tshig): Essential definitive commitments

**The Teacher-Student Relationship:**

**Four Types of Teachers:**
<list> 1. **General Teacher** (spyi'i bla ma): Honored by all as teacher
<list> 2. **Drawing Teacher** (dbugs 'byin pa'i bla ma): Who draws one to connect with Dharma
<list> 3. **Empowerment Teacher** (dbang bskur ba'i bla ma): Who bestows samaya and vows
<list> 4. **Instruction Teacher** (man ngag gi bla ma): Who gives instruction and transmission

**Four Types of Vajra Siblings:**
<list> 1. **General Siblings** (spyi'i mched grogs): All who have entered the teachings
<list> 2. **Close Siblings** (nye ba'i mched grogs): Those of one Dharma-family
<list> 3. **Mixed Siblings** ('dres pa'i mched grogs): Those gathered by one Guru
<list> 4. **Extremely Mixed Siblings** (shin tu 'dres pa'i mched grogs): Those who received empowerment together in one maṇḍala

**Consequences of Samaya Decline:**
- **Body decline**: Leads to vajra hell
- **Speech decline**: Leads to darkness and muteness
- **Mind decline**: Leads to madness and uninterrupted suffering

**Methods of Repair:**
- Extensive scripture reading
- Gaṇacakra offerings
- Lamp rituals
- Offerings to the guru

### **Section 4: 01-07-04-01.txt (385 lines)**  
**Topic:** Mind Samaya and Supreme Samaya—THE MAJOR SECTION

This extensive section presents the **nine mind samayas** and culminates in the **supreme samaya of Great Perfection**.

**Outer Mind Samaya:**
- Abandoning harmful intent toward all beings
- Abandoning harmful intent toward the Guru
- Abandoning harmful intent toward vajra siblings

**Inner Mind Samaya:**
- Abandoning wrong views about established tenets
- Abandoning wrong meditation
- Abandoning wrong conduct

**Secret Mind Samaya:**
- Not holding the Guru as ordinary
- Recognizing the Guru as the nature of all Buddhas
- Understanding that harm to Guru is heavier than any other sin

**The Four Degrees of Samaya Damage:**

**1. Contradiction** ('gal ba):
- Repairable same day
- Minor breach through momentary anger or distraction

**2. Degenerated** (nyams pa):
- Repairable within one month
- Moderate breach through ongoing negligence

**3. Crossed** (bzhar ba):
- Repairable within one year
- Serious breach through deliberate violation

**4. Loose** (lhod pa):
- Requires 2-3 years of intensive practice
- Complete abandonment of samaya

**Repair Methods for Each Degree:**
- Confession to the Guru
- Gaṇacakra offerings
- Recitation of hundred-syllable mantra
- Deity practice and self-visualization

**Supreme Samaya of Great Perfection:**

The section culminates in the **non-dual samaya** beyond conventional rules:

**Trekchö (khregs chod) — Primordial Purity:**
- Recognizing all appearances as illusory like mirage-water
- Seeing through the nature of mind directly
- **Samaya**: To recognize that which cannot be kept or broken

**Thögel (thod rgal) — Spontaneous Presence:**
- Recognizing self-arisen wisdom's qualities
- The natural display of luminosity
- **Samaya**: To remain in what is spontaneously accomplished

**The Ultimate Samaya:**
<tantra> "The supreme samaya is primordially guarded, spontaneously accomplished, self-liberated."

**Beyond Keeping and Breaking:**
- Conventional samaya: Rules to be maintained
- Supreme samaya: Nature to be recognized
- The Dzogchen practitioner ultimately transcends conventional samaya while never breaking it

A brief transitional passage pointing toward Chapter 8's presentation of the primordial **Ground** (gzhi), indicating that samaya commitments ultimately rest upon recognizing the nature of reality itself.

## READING GUIDANCE

**For Practitioners:**
This chapter is **essential for all Vajrayāna practitioners**, as samaya maintenance is the basis upon which all tantric accomplishments depend.

**Key understandings:**
1. **Samaya is not punishment**: The hell descriptions are accurate karmic mechanics, not threats
2. **The Guru is paramount**: Harm to Guru is worse than harm to all other beings combined
3. **Hierarchy of severity**: Sibling < Lineage Guru < Root Guru (7x < 100x < 10,000x)
4. **Repair is always possible**: Even complete breakage can be repaired through sincere practice

**Practice implications:**
- Maintain awareness of samaya in daily conduct
- Respect the Guru as the embodiment of all Buddhas
- Protect the vajra sangha as spiritual family
- Ultimately, rest in the supreme samaya beyond keeping

**Warning:** The terrifying descriptions of hell-realms and karma multiplication are not meant to create guilt or fear but to inspire **careful attention** to conduct. The Vajrayāna path is powerful and therefore requires strong container.

**For Scholars:**
Note the sophisticated structure:
- **Progressive presentation**: Outer → Inner → Secret → Supreme
- **Numerical organization**: 3 roots, 25 branches, 7 categories, 4 degrees
- **Soteriological arc**: From discipline to recognition
- **Integration**: Conventional ethics transcended but not abandoned

**Critical Points:**
1. **Conventional vs. Supreme**: The relationship between keeping rules and recognizing nature
2. **Guru devotion**: Theological basis for Guru yoga
3. **Karma mechanics**: Multiplication effects in samaya context
4. **Tantric ethics**: Different from sūtra ethics—more intense, more immediate consequences

**Scripture Citations:**
- **Tantra of Supreme Samaya** (dam tshig mchog gi rgyud)
- **Self-Arisen** (rang shar)
- **Various Great Perfection tantras**: Listed above

## CONNECTION TO CHAPTER 8

Chapter 7 established **samaya** (dam tshig) as the path; Chapter 8 will present the **Ground** (gzhi) as the basis. These two chapters form a critical pair:
- **Chapter 7**: How to maintain connection (samaya)
- **Chapter 8**: What we are connected to (the Ground)

**The progression:**
1. First understand **empowerment** (Chapter 6)—the door opens
2. Then understand **samaya** (Chapter 7)—stay connected
3. Then understand the **Ground** (Chapter 8)—what is realized

The supreme samaya at the end of Chapter 7 already points to Chapter 8: the samaya beyond keeping and breaking is precisely the recognition of the **primordial Ground** that is spontaneously pure from the beginning.

**For Dzogchen practitioners:** The samaya of Trekchö and Thögel are the doorway into the direct recognition of the Ground presented in Chapter 8. Understanding samaya as "primordially guarded" prepares the mind for understanding the Ground as "primordially pure."
