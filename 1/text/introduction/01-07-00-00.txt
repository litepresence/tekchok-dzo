## CHAPTER 7: Samaya Commitments

**Tibetan:** རིམ་ཁང་བདུན་པ། (Seventh Lecture Hall)
**Location:** Volume 1, Sections 01-07-01-01 through 01-07-05-01
**Tibetan Lines:** 9704-10476

Following the detailed presentation of empowerments in Chapter 6, this chapter focuses exclusively on samaya (damtsik)—the sacred commitments that bind the practitioner to the path of Secret Mantra. Longchenpa explains that receiving empowerment without maintaining samaya is like receiving seeds without planting them; the potential for awakening exists but cannot actualize without the proper conditions.

The five sections systematically present the root and branch samayas. The root samayas concern the vajra body, speech, and mind of the guru—commitments not to abandon the physical, verbal, or mental dimensions of enlightenment as embodied by the master. The branch samayas expand to twenty-five specific commitments covering view, conduct, practice, common pledges, and the particular samayas of body, speech, and mind.

Longchenpa explains the methods for repairing broken samayas through confession, restitution, and receiving empowerment again. He emphasizes that samaya is not mere rule-keeping but the energetic foundation that allows the blessings of the lineage to flow. When samaya is maintained, the practitioner and guru become indivisible; when broken, the connection is severed. This chapter is essential for all Vajrayāna practitioners, as samaya maintenance is the basis upon which all tantric accomplishments depend.
