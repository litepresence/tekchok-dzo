### The Purpose of This Chapter

You have journeyed through the vast architecture of the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle—from the perfect Teacher to the primordial Ground, through the elaborate presentations of delusion's arising, the subtle body's channels and winds, the four lamps of visionary experience, and the recognition of awareness itself. You have traversed the path of Trekchö and Thögal, practiced the bardo instructions, and trained in the transference of consciousness. Now you arrive at a crucial turning point: the destination toward which all these practices lead—the natural emanation body fields where those of refined faculties take birth and swiftly attain Buddhahood.

This chapter addresses a specific class of practitioners: those "of final faculties" (*dbang po tha ma'i tha ma*)—beings whose capacities are most refined, or those of lesser capacity who nevertheless failed to recognize the truth when the dharma-nature bardo arose before them. For these practitioners, the becoming bardo (*srid pa'i bar do*) presents itself like a dream, and through the power of recognition and the blessings of previous practice, they can direct their consciousness toward the pure fields of spontaneous emanation.

### What You Will Encounter Here

**The Structure of Liberation:** Longchenpa organizes this chapter into a systematic presentation that moves from recognition to destination, from practice to result. The chapter contains one extensive section (02-24-01-01) that unfolds across ten pages of profound instruction.

**The Recognition of the Bardo State:** The chapter begins with the critical moment of recognition—when the path appears within the becoming bardo, the practitioner thinks, "I have died." This moment of lucidity, cultivated through daytime and nighttime practices, becomes the doorway to liberation. The practitioner recalls the guru and the instructions received, thinks, "Now I shall go unto the field of natural emanation," and through the exhaustion of self-grasping propensities, arises miraculously upon a lotus in that pure field.

**The Two Natures:** Longchenpa distinguishes between the "nature of abiding" (*gnas pa'i rang bzhin*)—the fields that exist primordially as the spontaneous display of ground-appearance—and the "nature of enumeration" (*bgrangs pa'i rang bzhin*)—the progressive grounds traversed through the perfections. This distinction clarifies that these fields are not merely rewards for practice but the natural expression of awareness itself.

**The Five Emanation Body Fields:** The chapter provides an elaborate description of the five emanation body fields corresponding to the five Buddha families:

- **Eastern Manifest Joy** (*mngon par dga' ba*): The field of Vajra Unshakable, white in color, where bodhisattvas are miraculously born and move through the sky
- **Southern Glorious Possessing** (*dpal dang ldan pa*): The field of Jewel Source, golden in color, possessing immeasurable excellence
- **Western Lotus Piled** (*padma brtsegs pa*): The field of Infinite Light, red in color, radiant with the light of wisdom
- **Northern Action Fully Completed** (*las rab rdzogs pa*): The field of Meaning Accomplished, green in color, where all action is spontaneously accomplished
- **Central Wrathful Field** (*khro bo'i zhing*): The great charnel-ground of Blazing Mountain, where even those who bewilder and fear can find liberation through merely seeing

**The Characteristics of Pure Fields:** Longchenpa describes these fields with exquisite detail—the celestial palaces made of crystal, gold, and precious gems; the healing waters possessing eight limbs; the birds with sweet voices proclaiming Dharma; the bodhisattvas bound by only one birth; the absence of disease, hunger, and the three poisons. These are not merely poetic descriptions but precise instructions on what to recognize and where to direct the mind.

**The Preliminary Practices:** The chapter includes practical instructions for preparing for this transition: habituating oneself during the daytime to direct perception of self-appearance, habituating the five lights within the heart at nighttime, training in transference during the intervals, and at the moment of death, establishing clear focus and projecting consciousness with the syllable HIG.

**The Ultimate Liberation:** The chapter concludes by establishing the ultimate place of liberation—the twofold purity, the non-dual space and wisdom of the Dharma Body, the primordially pure jewel secret recess. Even as it describes the magnificent emanation body fields in elaborate detail, it points beyond them to the ground from which they arise and to which they ultimately return.

### Why This Chapter Matters

This chapter represents the culmination of the path presented in the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle. Having established the ground of primordial purity, explained how delusion arises, and detailed the practices of the path, Longchenpa now reveals the fruition—not as an abstract philosophical concept, but as a concrete, experiential destination with precise characteristics and accessible entry points.

For practitioners, this chapter serves multiple functions:

1. **It provides a destination for the mind**—a clear, positive vision of the result of practice that counters nihilism and despair
2. **It demonstrates the continuity of practice**—showing how the habits cultivated in this life (direct perception of self-appearance, recognition of the five lights) become the means of liberation in the next
3. **It reveals the natural purity of result**—emphasizing that these fields are not created by effort but are the spontaneous expression of awareness's own nature
4. **It accommodates different capacities**—describing how both those of refined faculties and those who initially miss recognition can find liberation through these fields

### How to Read This Chapter

As you read, recognize that Longchenpa is describing your own mind's potential—not as a distant fantasy, but as the natural expression of awareness when freed from adventitious stains. The elaborate descriptions of celestial palaces, jewel trees, and divine assemblies are not mere mythology; they are skillful means pointing to the intrinsic purity of experience when the limitations of ordinary perception are transcended.

The verses cited from the Sun-Moon Conjunction Tantra and the Self-Arising Awareness Great Tantra are not decorative flourishes but precise transmissions of how recognition occurs and where it leads. The detailed enumeration of the fields' characteristics—their colors, their inhabitants, their qualities—serves to familiarize the mind with what to expect and how to navigate.

Most importantly, this chapter bridges the gap between the profound view of primordial purity and the practical needs of practitioners still working within a framework of path and result. It demonstrates that Dzogchen is not a nihilistic denial of appearances but a recognition of their ultimate purity—a purity that is not different from the magnificent displays described here.

### Connection to What Follows

Having established the natural emanation body fields as the destination for those of final faculties, Longchenpa will next turn (in Chapter 25) to the final presentation of the spontaneous results—the ultimate fruit of the Great Perfection. There he will establish how the ground, path, and fruition are ultimately inseparable, how the twofold purity is already accomplished, and how all Buddhas and sentient beings are unified in the single sphere of primordial awareness.

This chapter, therefore, serves as the bridge between the detailed path instructions that have dominated the text thus far and the ultimate presentation of result that will complete the Treasury. It shows that even the most elaborate displays of the path lead inexorably to the simplicity of the ground recognized as fruition.

### A Word to the Practitioner

Do not read this chapter as a travel brochure for some distant paradise. These fields are the natural expression of your own awareness when the obscurations of grasping and fixation are exhausted. The "final faculties" are not some special endowment reserved for the elect; they are your own capacity for recognition, refined through practice and blessing. The recognition that "I have died" is available in every moment when the fixations of self and world dissolve. The lotus upon which you arise is the seat of your own innate wisdom.

As you study these descriptions, let them familiarize your mind with the purity that is always present, obscured only by the habits of deluded perception. And remember that the ultimate destination is not these magnificent fields themselves, but the recognition from which they arise—the primordially pure jewel secret recess that is your own true nature.
