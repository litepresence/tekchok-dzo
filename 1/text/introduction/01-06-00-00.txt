This chapter provides the most detailed treatment in the text of tantric empowerments (wang), the initiatory transmissions that ripen the student's continuum and prepare them for the path of Secret Mantra. Following the general presentation of vehicles in Chapter 5, Longchenpa now explains the specific empowerments that establish the practitioner in Vajrayāna practice.

The chapter covers the four major types of empowerment—vase (bum), secret (gsang), wisdom-awareness (shes rab ye shes), and word (tshig)—detailing their purposes, the maṇḍalas in which they are conferred, and the capacities they awaken in the disciple. Extensive attention is given to the samaya commitments (damtsik) that accompany empowerment, explaining how these sacred vows function to protect the practice and maintain the connection with the lineage.

The later sections examine the guru-disciple relationship, the qualities to seek in an authentic master, and the characteristics of qualified students. Drawing from the Rigpa Rangshar and other tantras, Longchenpa warns against false teachers and emphasizes the necessity of proper examination before entering into the vajra commitment. For practitioners, this chapter is essential reading on the foundational practices of Vajrayāna—the empowerments that make all subsequent creation and completion stage practices possible.
