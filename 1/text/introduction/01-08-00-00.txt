Following the comprehensive presentation of mistaken philosophical views in Chapter 4 and the methods of liberation in Chapters 5-7, this chapter turns to the heart of Dzogchen metaphysics: the nature of the basis (gshi) itself. Longchenpa systematically examines seven distinct views on the basis held by various proponents within the Great Perfection tradition, demonstrating how each represents a partial understanding that fails to capture the complete non-dual reality.

The seven views—primordial purity (ka dag), spontaneous presence (lhun grub), uncertainty (ma nges pa), certainty (nges pa), changeability (bsgyur rung), acceptance of anything whatsoever (ci yang rung), and multiplicity (sna tshogs)—are each presented with their scriptural sources, logical foundations, and ultimate limitations. Longchenpa shows how these views, while capturing genuine aspects of the basis, fall into extremes when reified as the sole truth. The chapter culminates in establishing the definitive view: the non-dual basis where primordial purity and spontaneous presence are inseparable, like the sun and its rays.

This chapter is essential for practitioners of Dzogchen as it directly addresses the subtle errors that can arise even within the tradition itself. Longchenpa's detailed refutations reveal how fixation on any single aspect—whether emptiness or appearance, permanence or impermanence—creates conceptual obstructions to recognition. The metaphor of blind men describing an elephant illustrates how partial views, while containing truth, miss the complete picture. The chapter concludes by establishing the actual state: a basis that is empty yet naturally manifest, beyond all extremes yet appearing as everything—a realization that forms the foundation for all subsequent practice.
