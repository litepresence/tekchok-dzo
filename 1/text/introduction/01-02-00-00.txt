Having established the pure realms and enlightened manifestation in Chapter 1, Longchenpa now turns to the cosmic architecture within which ordinary beings dwell. This chapter describes the thirteen Thal-ba fields arranged around our own Sahā world, explaining their locations, characteristics, and the types of teachings each realm supports.

The detailed cosmology presented here draws from the Sound Thalgyur Tantra and describes realms arranged in stacked configurations like jeweled umbrellas, each with its own teacher, retinue, and duration of teachings. We learn about the upper realms—including those of gods intoxicated by sandalwood nectar and flowers—and the lower realms with their distinctive characteristics.

This chapter serves as a bridge between the pure vision of enlightenment and the confused experience of ordinary beings. By mapping the full range of possible existences, Longchenpa prepares the ground for understanding how beings become trapped in cyclic existence and how they might find liberation. The cosmological framework established here will be essential for understanding the subtle body systems and elemental compositions described in subsequent chapters.
