This chapter marks a significant shift from the philosophical analysis of Chapter 4 into the practical domain of Vajrayāna practice. Having established the deficiencies of philosophical views alone, Longchenpa now presents the Secret Mantra path as the swift method for realizing the nature of mind.

The first three sections explain the fivefold classification of tantras—by root meaning, yoga meaning, purpose meaning, great meaning, and word meaning—establishing the hermeneutical framework for interpreting esoteric teachings. Section four, the longest in the chapter, presents a comprehensive overview of the nine vehicles, explaining the creation stage (kyerim) and completion stage (dzogrim) practices, empowerments (wang), samaya commitments (damtsik), and the specific characteristics that distinguish each vehicle from the others.

The fifth section returns to the Great Perfection, showing how Atiyoga transcends all lower vehicles while including their essential points. Throughout this chapter, Longchenpa emphasizes the necessity of proper transmission and the dangers of practicing without authentic empowerment. For practitioners, this chapter serves as both a map of the tantric path and a warning against the common errors of confusing lower vehicles with the Great Perfection, or mistaking intellectual understanding for realization.
