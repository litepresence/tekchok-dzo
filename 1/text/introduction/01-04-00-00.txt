This extensive chapter—the longest in Volume 1—presents a comprehensive doxography of philosophical systems, both non-Buddhist and Buddhist, that represent various ways the basis can be misunderstood. Longchenpa analyzes eternalist and nihilist views, Hindu systems (Sāṃkhya, Vaiśeṣika), Jainism, and the four major Buddhist philosophical schools.

The presentation begins with "mistaken vehicles"—non-Buddhist systems that hold erroneous views about self and cosmology. It then proceeds through the four Buddhist tenet systems: Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, and Madhyamaka, explaining each school's positions on selflessness, emptiness, and the two truths. The chapter culminates in the presentation of Dzogchen as the definitive view that transcends all limitations.

Readers should approach this chapter as both a philosophical education and a meditative preparation. Understanding these systems is not merely academic; each represents a potential way the mind can grasp at views and miss the direct recognition of nature. The thorough presentation of lower views makes the brilliance of Dzogchen's simple pointing-out instructions all the more apparent. This chapter rewards careful study, as the distinctions drawn here will be presupposed in the more advanced teachings of subsequent chapters.
