## CHAPTER 21: Bardo Practice

**Opening Phrase:** འཛམ་བུའི་གླིང་འདིར་བྱུང་ཚུལ་ནི།  
"How Jambudvīpa manifests—the manner of this world's arising..."

This concise yet profound chapter presents the **Bardo Practice** (bar do sgrub pa)—the methods for navigating the intermediate state between death and rebirth. Following the completion stage practices of Chapter 20 (Thögel), Longchenpa now addresses the critical transition that all beings must face: the dissolution of the physical body and the journey through the bardos. This chapter is **essential for practitioners** as it provides the practical instructions for either achieving liberation during the death process or, at minimum, securing a favorable rebirth.

The chapter operates on the Dzogchen principle that **death is not an end but the greatest opportunity for recognition**. The moment of death—when the winds dissolve, the elements disintegrate, and the consciousness separates from the body—offers a direct glimpse of the Ground. For those who have practiced Thögel in life, the bardo displays the same visions and lights; for those who have not, it offers one final chance to recognize the nature of mind before falling into the delusion of the next life.

## SECTION BREAKDOWN

### **Section 0: 01-21-00-01.txt (~155 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Four Knowledge-Holders and Their Fruition

This opening section presents the **four types of knowledge-holders** (rig 'dzin rnam bzhi)—the classification of realized practitioners based on their level of accomplishment and the timing of their liberation.

**The Four Knowledge-Holders:**

**1. Ripened Knowledge-Holder** (smin rig 'dzin):
- **Characteristics**: Mind ripened as the deity's body through practice, but the physical body not yet transformed
- **Result**: Liberated in the Bardo (bar do grol)  
- **Process**: When the winds dissolve at death, the practitioner recognizes the deity as their own nature and attains liberation in the intermediate state
- **Significance**: Common among dedicated practitioners who complete the path but do not attain the rainbow body in this life

**2. Knowledge-Holder with Power Over Life** (tshe dbang rig 'dzin):
- **Characteristics**: Mastery over the lifespan through control of the winds and bindus
- **Result**: Liberated in that very life (tshe 'di grol)
- **Process**: Through completion stage practices, the practitioner purifies the elements and channels, attaining liberation without entering the bardo
- **Significance**: Higher accomplishment than the ripened holder; death is transcended

**3. Mahāmudrā Knowledge-Holder** (phyag chen rig 'dzin):
- **Characteristics**: Body and mind both ripened as the deity; complete integration
- **Result**: The great seal of emptiness and bliss fully realized
- **Process**: Through the union of generation and completion stages, appearance and emptiness are inseparable
- **Significance**: Represents complete stabilization of recognition; the deity is not separate from oneself

**4. Spontaneously Accomplished Knowledge-Holder** (lhun grub rig 'dzin):
- **Characteristics**: Beyond effort; all qualities naturally manifest
- **Result**: Completing benefit for self and others spontaneously
- **Process**: No distinction between meditation and post-meditation; continuous enlightened activity
- **Significance**: The supreme accomplishment; the practitioner becomes a vidyādhara in the full sense

**The Path to These Attainments:**

<tantra> "Through these sixteen as before; know the qualities."

The section outlines how practitioners progress through:
<list> **Empowerment**: Receiving the ripening transmissions
<list> **Application**: Practicing the generation and completion stages
<list> **Seeing**: Recognizing the nature directly
<list> **Meditation**: Stabilizing that recognition

**The Fruition:**
- If practice is uninterrupted, life control is obtained in that very life
- The result is complete liberation or beneficial rebirth
- The knowledge-holder continues to benefit beings according to capacity

**Bardo Liberation Explained:**

For the ripened knowledge-holder who enters the bardo:
<list> **Recognition**: The deities of the bardo are recognized as self-display
<list> **Non-fear**: The terrifying appearances are seen as the play of awareness
<list> **Liberation**: Without grasping, the bardo itself is the pure land
<list> **Or**: If full liberation is not attained, a favorable rebirth is secured

### **Section 1: 01-21-01-01.txt (~55 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Three Kāyas, Buddha Fields, and Signs of Accomplishment

This concluding section presents the **fruition in terms of the three bodies** and the **signs that indicate accomplishment**.

**The Three Kāyas as Fruition:**

**1. Dharmakāya (chos sku):**
- **Nature**: The empty essence, primordially pure
- **Manifestation**: The clear light at the moment of death
- **Recognition**: Seeing through the dissolution of elements to the nature

**2. Saṃbhogakāya (longs sku):**
- **Nature**: The spontaneous presence, luminous clarity
- **Manifestation**: The mandala of deities in the bardo
- **Recognition**: The five wisdom Buddhas appearing as one's own nature

**3. Nirmāṇakāya (sprul sku):**
- **Nature**: Compassionate manifestation for the benefit of beings
- **Manifestation**: Emanations into various realms
- **Recognition**: Taking rebirth deliberately to benefit others

**The Buddha Fields (zhing khams):**

The section describes how accomplished practitioners:
<list> **Recognize**: The bardo visions as the pure lands
<list> **Choose**: Rebirth in favorable realms
<list> **Benefit**: Continue to help beings according to aspiration

**Clairvoyance and Higher Knowledges:**

The fruition includes the development of:
<list> **Divine sight** (lha'i mig): Seeing beyond ordinary perception
<list> **Divine hearing** (lha'i rna ba): Hearing beyond ordinary range
<list> **Knowledge of others' minds**: Understanding beings' dispositions
<list> **Recollection of past lives**: Knowledge of previous existences
<list> **Knowledge of death and rebirth**: Understanding the passage through bardos

**Signs of Accomplishment:**

The practitioner who has accomplished the bardo practice displays:
<list> **Physical signs**: Radiant appearance, special marks, control over elements
<list> **Dream signs**: Clear dreams of pure lands, deities, and liberation
<list> **Meditation signs**: Stable recognition, spontaneous compassion
<list> **Death signs**: Peaceful passing, rainbows, relics (ringsel)

**The Ultimate Fruition:**

<tantra> "Ripened: if uninterrupted, obtaining life control in that life, obtaining result."

The chapter concludes by emphasizing that:
<list> **Practice must be continuous**: Interruption breaks the momentum
<list> **Life control is possible**: The lifespan can be extended or transcended
<list> **Result is certain**: For those who practice authentically, liberation is assured
<list> **Benefit for others**: The accomplished practitioner naturally benefits beings

**Closing Integration:**

The bardo practices of this chapter integrate seamlessly with:
<list> **Chapter 20**: Thögel practice prepares the practitioner for bardo visions
<list> **Chapter 22**: Phowa (transference) offers an alternative path if bardo recognition fails
<list> **The entire path**: From preliminary practices through completion stage to death and beyond

## READING GUIDANCE

**For Practitioners:**
This chapter addresses **the great matter of death and liberation**. Essential understandings:

**1. Death Is an Opportunity:**
- Not an end but a doorway
- The greatest chance for recognition
- For the prepared, liberation is certain

**2. Preparation Is Essential:**
- Bardo practice must be done NOW, not at death
- The recognition cultivated in life manifests at death
- Thögel practice directly prepares for bardo visions

**3. The Four Knowledge-Holders Show the Path:**
- Ripened: Practice well, be liberated in bardo
- Life control: Practice deeply, transcend death entirely
- Mahāmudrā: Integrate completely, no separation
- Spontaneous: Effortless perfection, continuous benefit

**4. The Goal Is Life Control:**
- Ideally, liberated in this very life
- If not, liberated in bardo
- At minimum, favorable rebirth to continue practice

**Practice Instructions:**

**During Life:**
<list> Practice Thögel to recognize the visions
<list> Stabilize recognition so it appears at death
<list> Purify obscurations through deity yoga
<list> Accumulate merit and wisdom

**At Death:**
<list> Maintain recognition during dissolution
<list> See the clear light as Dharmakāya
<list> Recognize the bardo mandala as self-display
<list> Do not fear, do not grasp, rest in nature

**For the Dying:**
<list> Read this text or similar instructions
<list> Remind the dying person of their practice
<list> Guide them through the dissolution stages
<list> Encourage recognition of the clear light

**Common Errors:**

**1. Waiting Until Death:**
- **Error**: Thinking bardo practice is for the dying moment only
- **Antidote**: Practice NOW; death practice is preparation

**2. Fear of Death:**
- **Error**: Viewing death as terrifying, to be avoided
- **Antidote**: Recognize death as the greatest opportunity

**3. Grasping at Rebirth:**
- **Error**: Seeking favorable rebirth for worldly reasons
- **Antidote**: Rebirth chosen only to benefit beings

**4. Neglecting the Path:**
- **Error**: Thinking bardo practice replaces lifetime practice
- **Antidote**: Bardo practice IS the fruition of lifetime practice

**For Scholars:**
Note the sophisticated integration:
- **Sūtra**: The six higher knowledges (abhijñā) from classical Buddhism
- **Tantra**: The four knowledge-holders from Vajrayāna
- **Dzogchen**: Liberation in bardo through recognition of self-display
- **Unique synthesis**: The bardo as opportunity, not just transition

**Critical Points:**
<list> **Bardo as opportunity**: Not just a passage but a chance for awakening
<list> **Preparation essential**: Can't start practicing at death
<list> **Four types show gradations**: Not all practitioners achieve the same result
<list> **Integration with Thögel**: Bardo visions are the same as Thögel visions

**Philosophical Framework:**
<list> **Conventional**: The bardo appears as a real transition
<list> **Ultimate**: The bardo is the display of awareness, empty
<list> **Unity**: Recognize the empty nature while navigating the appearance

**Scripture Citations:**
<list> **Self-Arisen** (rang shar): Bardo as self-display

## CONNECTION TO SURROUNDING CHAPTERS

**Backward Connections:**
<list> **Chapter 20**: Thögel practice—prepares the practitioner for bardo visions
<list> **Chapters 14-19**: Ground, path, and method—all lead to this fruition
<list> **Preparation**: Lifetime practice enables bardo liberation

**Forward Connections:**
<list> **Chapter 22**: Phowa (transference)—alternative if bardo recognition fails
<list> **Chapters 23-25**: Culminating practices—all presuppose bardo understanding
<list> **Completion**: The full path from beginning to end of life

**The Chapter's Strategic Position:**
Chapter 21 addresses **the completion of the path at death**:
<list> **Chapters 1-19**: Preparation and practice in life
<list> **Chapter 20**: Advanced completion stage (Thögel)
<list> **Chapter 21**: Death and bardo liberation
<list> **Chapter 22**: Transference (phowa) as alternative

This creates a complete path:
- **Life**: Practice, recognition, stabilization
- **Death**: Dissolution, clear light, bardo
- **Beyond**: Liberation or favorable rebirth

**The Great Matter:**
<tantra> "Death is certain; the time of death is uncertain. Since death is the great matter, practice Dharma."

This chapter addresses **the great matter directly**. It does not shy away from death but presents it as the culmination of the path. For the Dzogchen practitioner, death is not defeat but the final examination—either one recognizes and is liberated, or one takes rebirth to continue. The four knowledge-holders show that the path leads somewhere, that practice has result, that liberation is possible.

The knowledge-holder who achieves liberation in the bardo demonstrates that **recognition transcends the physical body**. When the winds dissolve and the elements separate, when the consciousness is no longer bound to form, recognition remains. This is the proof of the Dzogchen view—that the nature is not dependent on the aggregates, that rigpa is not the mind, that liberation is real.
