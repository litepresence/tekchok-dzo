## CHAPTER OVERVIEW

This sublime chapter — the Twenty-First Lecture Hall — unfolds the **Bardo Practice** (*bar do sgrub pa*): the sovereign methods for navigating the intermediate state between death and rebirth, wherein consciousness, released from its corporeal vessel, traverses the luminous corridors of dissolution and re-arising. Following the completion-stage practices of Chapter Twenty (Thögel), Longchenpa now addresses the critical transition that all embodied beings must ultimately face — the dissolution of the physical form and the journey through the bardos — which stands as **essential instruction for every practitioner** committed to liberation in this very lifetime or beyond.

The chapter operates upon the fundamental Dzogchen principle that **death is not terminus but threshold** — the supreme opportunity for recognition of the Ground. At the moment of death — when the winds dissolve into the central channel, when the elements disintegrate into their essential natures, and when consciousness separates from its physical supports — a direct glimpse of the Primordial State becomes accessible. For those who have cultivated Thögel in life, the bardo displays the same visions, lights, and deities that appeared during practice; for those who have not prepared, it offers one final, precious chance to recognize the nature of mind before falling once more into the delusion of cyclic existence.

The Bardo Practice presents what no other tradition offers with such precision: **a complete cartography of the death passage** — from the initial dissolution of the elements through the clear light of Dharmakāya to the emergence of the Saṃbhogakāya mandala and, ultimately, to the choice of rebirth or complete liberation. This is the **Great Matter** — the culmination toward which all preliminary practices, all generation and completion stage meditations, all trekchö and thögel cultivation, have been directed.

## SECTION BREAKDOWN

<ornament></ornament>

### **Section 0: 01-21-00-01.txt (~155 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Four Knowledge-Holders and Their Fruition

This opening section presents the **Four Knowledge-Holders** (*rig 'dzin rnam bzhi*) — the classification of realized practitioners based upon their level of accomplishment, the maturity of their recognition, and the timing of their ultimate liberation. These four categories demonstrate that the path leads to definite results and that liberation is neither arbitrary nor uniform but follows the natural progression of practice and realization.

**The Four Knowledge-Holders:**

<list>**1. Ripened Knowledge-Holder** (*smin rig 'dzin*):
- **Characteristics:** The practitioner's mind has fully ripened as the deity's body through dedicated practice of generation and completion stages; however, the physical body has not yet been completely transformed into light.
- **Result:** Liberated in the Bardo (*bar do grol*) — awakening achieved during the intermediate state after death.
- **Process:** When the winds dissolve at death and the bardo visions arise, the practitioner recognizes the mandala of peaceful and wrathful deities as self-display, thereby attaining liberation without entering rebirth.
- **Significance:** This represents the common attainment for dedicated practitioners who complete the path with diligence but do not attain the rainbow body (*ja' lus*) during this lifetime.</list>

<list>**2. Knowledge-Holder with Power Over Life** (*tshe dbang rig 'dzin*):
- **Characteristics:** Complete mastery over the lifespan through perfect control of the winds (*rlung*) and bindus (*thig le*) within the subtle body.
- **Result:** Liberated in that very life (*tshe 'di grol*) — transcendence of death without entering the bardo state.
- **Process:** Through advanced completion-stage practices, the practitioner purifies the elements and channels completely, dissolving the physical body into light or extending life indefinitely at will.
- **Significance:** Higher accomplishment than the ripened holder; death itself is transcended through recognition stabilized in the continuum.</list>

<list>**3. Mahāmudrā Knowledge-Holder** (*phyag chen rig 'dzin*):
- **Characteristics:** Both body and mind fully ripened as the deity; complete integration of appearance and emptiness without separation.
- **Result:** The Great Seal (*phyag rgya chen po*) of emptiness and bliss fully realized — the union of clarity and emptiness stabilized as continuous presence.
- **Process:** Through the non-dual practice of generation and completion stages, all appearances are recognized as the play of the deity, and emptiness is not separate from form.
- **Significance:** Represents complete stabilization of recognition; the deity is not separate from oneself, and all phenomena are the mandala.</list>

<list>**4. Spontaneously Accomplished Knowledge-Holder** (*lhun grub rig 'dzin*):
- **Characteristics:** Beyond all effort and contrivance; all enlightened qualities manifest naturally without deliberate cultivation.
- **Result:** Completing benefit for self and others spontaneously and continuously; enlightened activity flows unimpeded.
- **Process:** No distinction exists between meditation and post-meditation; all activities are sacred gesture, all speech is mantra, all thought is wisdom.
- **Significance:** The supreme accomplishment; the practitioner becomes a true vidyādhara in the complete sense, benefiting beings effortlessly throughout all realms.</list>

**The Path to These Attainments:**

<tantra>"Through these sixteen as before; know the qualities."</tantra>

The section delineates how practitioners progress through the stages of maturation:

<list>**Empowerment:** Receiving the ripening transmissions that plant the seeds of enlightenment in the mental continuum.</list>
<list>**Application:** Diligently practicing the generation stage (visualizing the deity) and completion stage (dissolving into emptiness and radiating as appearance).</list>
<list>**Seeing:** Directly recognizing the nature of mind — the inseparability of awareness and emptiness.</list>
<list>**Meditation:** Stabilizing that recognition until it becomes uninterrupted, natural presence.</list>

**The Fruition:**

<list>If practice remains uninterrupted, life control is obtained in that very life.</list>
<list>The result is either complete liberation beyond rebirth or, if beneficial for beings, deliberate rebirth as an emanation.</list>
<list>The knowledge-holder continues to benefit sentient beings according to their capacity and aspiration.</list>

**Bardo Liberation Explained:**

For the ripened knowledge-holder who enters the bardo, liberation occurs through:

<list>**Recognition:** The deities of the bardo — the Forty-Two Peaceful and Fifty-Eight Wrathful — are recognized as one's own self-display, not external entities to fear.</list>
<list>**Non-fear:** The terrifying appearances, sounds, and lights are seen as the natural play of awareness; no grasping or aversion arises.</list>
<list>**Liberation:** Without fixation or grasping, the bardo itself is recognized as the pure land — the natural state beyond coming and going.</list>
<list>**Or:** If full liberation is not attained at that moment, a favorable rebirth is secured through the power of recognition and aspiration.</list>

### **Section 1: 01-21-01-01.txt (~55 lines)**  
**Topic:** The Three Kāyas, Buddha Fields, and Signs of Accomplishment

This concluding section presents the **fruition in terms of the Three Bodies** (*sku gsum*) and the **signs that indicate accomplishment** — the outer, inner, and secret marks of realization that become evident as the practitioner approaches liberation.

**The Three Kāyas as Fruition:**

<list>**1. Dharmakāya** (*chos sku*):
- **Nature:** The empty essence, primordially pure (*ka dag*), unborn and unceasing, beyond all conceptual fabrication.
- **Manifestation:** The clear light (*'od gsal*) that dawns at the moment of death when the eighty innate conceptions have dissolved.
- **Recognition:** Seeing through the dissolution of the four elements and the stages of appearance, increase, and attainment to the naked nature of mind itself.</list>

<list>**2. Saṃbhogakāya** (*longs sku*):
- **Nature:** The spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*), luminous clarity, the natural display of the five wisdoms.
- **Manifestation:** The mandala of the five Buddha families — the hundred peaceful and wrathful deities — appearing in the bardo of Dharmatā.
- **Recognition:** The five wisdom Buddhas appearing as one's own nature, the five colors as the natural lights of awareness, the sounds as self-resounding mantra.</list>

<list>**3. Nirmāṇakāya** (*sprul sku*):
- **Nature:** Compassionate manifestation (*thugs rje*) for the benefit of beings, appearing according to their needs and capacities.
- **Manifestation:** Emanations into various realms, taking rebirth deliberately to guide beings, or appearing in pure visions to devoted practitioners.
- **Recognition:** Taking rebirth consciously and deliberately, choosing the circumstances that will most benefit others, without falling into the grip of karma and afflictions.</list>

**The Buddha Fields** (*zhing khams*):

The section describes how accomplished practitioners navigate the pure realms:

<list>**Recognize:** The bardo visions are none other than the pure lands — Akanishtha, Sukhāvatī, Abhirati, and countless others — appearing naturally to the purified mind.</list>
<list>**Choose:** Rather than falling helplessly into rebirth driven by karma, the practitioner deliberately selects rebirth in favorable realms or among favorable families to continue benefiting beings.</list>
<list>**Benefit:** The knowledge-holder continues to manifest in ways that guide sentient beings according to their aspirations, needs, and karmic connections.</list>

**Clairvoyance and Higher Knowledges:**

The fruition includes the natural development of the six or seven higher knowledges (*mngon shes*):

<list>**Divine Sight** (*lha'i mig*): The supernormal ability to see beyond ordinary perception — perceiving distant objects, subtle forms, other realms, and the karma and destinies of beings.</list>
<list>**Divine Hearing** (*lha'i rna ba*): The capacity to hear sounds and speech beyond ordinary range, including the teachings of Buddhas in other realms.</list>
<list>**Knowledge of Others' Minds** (*gzhan sems shes pa*): Direct understanding of other beings' thoughts, intentions, dispositions, and spiritual capacities.</list>
<list>**Recollection of Past Lives** (*sngon gnas rjes su dran pa*): Complete knowledge of previous existences, one's own and others', understanding the continuity of consciousness and the workings of karma.</list>
<list>**Knowledge of Death and Rebirth** (*'chi 'pho skye shes pa*): Understanding the passage through the bardos, knowing when and where beings will die and where they will be reborn.</list>
<list>**Knowledge of the Exhaustion of Defilements** (*zas shes pa): Direct realization that all afflictions and obscurations have been purified.</list>

**Signs of Accomplishment:**

The practitioner who has authentically accomplished the bardo practice displays unmistakable signs:

<list>**Physical Signs:** Radiant appearance, special marks (*mtshan*) indicating realization, control over the elements (ability to walk through fire or water without harm), and at death, the manifestation of rainbows, relics (*ring bsrel*), or dissolution of the body into light.</list>
<list>**Dream Signs:** Clear dreams of pure lands, direct encounters with deities who bestow teachings and blessings, and the ability to recognize the dream state as dream while within it.</list>
<list>**Meditation Signs:** Stable recognition that does not waver even during intense activity or emotional arousal, spontaneous compassion that arises without deliberate cultivation, and the natural cessation of ordinary conceptual thought.</list>
<list>**Death Signs:** Peaceful passing with clear recognition, the body remaining in meditation posture for days after death, extraordinary weather phenomena (rainbows, earthquakes, unseasonable flowers), and the manifestation of sacred relics.</list>

**The Ultimate Fruition:**

<tantra>"Ripened: if uninterrupted, obtaining life control in that life, obtaining result."</tantra>

The chapter concludes by emphasizing essential points:

<list>**Practice must be continuous:** Interruption breaks the momentum of realization; the path requires unbroken engagement until fruition is achieved.</list>
<list>**Life control is possible:** Through mastery of the subtle body, the lifespan can be extended or transcended entirely at the practitioner's will.</list>
<list>**Result is certain:** For those who practice authentically with correct understanding, liberation is not merely possible but assured.</list>
<list>**Benefit for others:** The accomplished practitioner naturally, effortlessly benefits beings — this is not contrived but the spontaneous expression of awakened nature.</list>

**Closing Integration:**

The bardo practices of this chapter integrate seamlessly with the broader path:

<list>**Chapter 20:** Thögel practice prepares the practitioner for the bardo visions by revealing them during life; what appears in thögel is exactly what appears at death.</list>
<list>**Chapter 22:** Phowa (transference of consciousness) offers an alternative path if bardo recognition fails — the practitioner can transfer consciousness to a pure land rather than navigating the bardo.</list>
<list>**The Entire Path:** From preliminary practices through generation stage, completion stage, trekchö, and thögel — all lead to this culmination: recognition at death or in the bardo.</list>

## KEY TECHNICAL TERMS INTRODUCED

<ornament></ornament>

### **The Four Knowledge-Holders** (*rig 'dzin rnam bzhi*)

These four categories represent the graduated fruitions of Vajrayāna practice, demonstrating that realization occurs in stages and that the timing of liberation depends upon the depth and stability of recognition cultivated during life.

- **Ripened** (*smin pa*): The practitioner's mind has ripened as the deity, but the physical body has not yet dissolved into light — liberation is achieved in the bardo.
- **Life Control** (*tshe dbang*): Complete mastery over the lifespan through control of the subtle winds and essences — liberation achieved in this very life without entering the bardo.
- **Mahāmudrā** (*phyag rgya chen po*): The Great Seal — body and mind fully integrated as the deity, appearance and emptiness inseparable, meditation and post-meditation non-dual.
- **Spontaneous Accomplishment** (*lhun grub*): Effortless, natural perfection — all enlightened qualities manifest without deliberate cultivation, benefit for self and others flows continuously.

### **The Bardos** (*bar do*)

The intermediate states through which consciousness passes:

- **Bardo of Living** (*skye gnas bar do*): This very life — the interval between birth and death, the precious opportunity to practice.
- **Bardo of Dying** ('*chi ka bar do*): The process of death itself — the dissolution of the elements, the stages of appearance, increase, and attainment, culminating in the clear light.
- **Bardo of Dharmatā** (*chos nyid bar do*): The nature as it is — the display of the clear light, the mandala of peaceful and wrathful deities, lasting (subjectively) for several days.
- **Bardo of Becoming** (*srid pa bar do*): The intermediate state of seeking rebirth — consciousness without a physical body, driven by karma and habit, lasting up to forty-nine days.

### **Fruition Terms**

- **Liberation in Bardo** (*bar do grol*): Achieving awakening during the intermediate state between death and rebirth — the result of the ripened knowledge-holder.
- **Liberation in This Life** (*tshe 'di grol*): Achieving awakening during the present lifetime without entering the bardo — the result of the knowledge-holder with life control.
- **Life Control** (*tshe dbang*): The power to extend the lifespan indefinitely or to transcend death entirely through mastery of the subtle body.
- **Rainbow Body** (*'ja' lus*): The body dissolving into light at death, leaving only hair and nails — the sign of complete realization of the Great Perfection.
- **Relics** (*ring bsrel*): Sacred pearl-like remains that manifest after the death of highly realized masters, indicating purification of the elements and stabilization of recognition.

### **The Three Kāyas as Fruition**

The three bodies of awakening manifest as the result of practice:

- **Dharmakāya:** Recognition of the empty essence at the moment of death — the clear light nature.
- **Saṃbhogakāya:** Recognition of the luminous mandala in the bardo of Dharmatā — the spontaneous display.
- **Nirmāṇakāya:** Deliberate rebirth to benefit beings — compassionate manifestation.

### **Accomplishment Signs**

The higher knowledges and marks of realization:

- **Divine Sight** (*lha'i mig*): Supernormal vision — seeing beyond ordinary limitations.
- **Divine Hearing** (*lha'i rna ba*): Supernormal hearing — perceiving sounds across realms.

## READING GUIDANCE

<ornament></ornament>

**For Practitioners:**

This chapter addresses **the great matter of death and liberation**. The following essential understandings should guide your study and practice:

<list>**1. Death Is Supreme Opportunity:**
Death is not an end but a doorway — the greatest chance for recognition of the nature of mind. For those who have prepared through practice, liberation at death is not merely possible but certain.</list>

<list>**2. Preparation Is Essential:**
Bardo practice must be undertaken NOW, not postponed until the moment of death. The recognition cultivated during life naturally manifests at death. Thögel practice directly prepares for the bardo visions by revealing them during life.</list>

<list>**3. The Four Knowledge-Holders Show the Graduated Path:**
- Ripened: Practice well, be liberated in bardo.
- Life control: Practice deeply, transcend death entirely.
- Mahāmudrā: Integrate completely — no separation between meditation and daily life.
- Spontaneous: Effortless perfection, continuous benefit for all beings.</list>

<list>**4. The Goal Is Life Control:**
Ideally, strive for liberation in this very life. If that is not achieved, aim for liberation in the bardo. At minimum, secure favorable rebirth to continue practice without losing the connection to the teachings.</list>

### **Practice Instructions:**

**During Life:**

<list>Practice Thögel assiduously to recognize the visions that will appear at death.</list>
<list>Stabilize recognition so that it remains present regardless of circumstances — this stability will appear naturally at death.</list>
<list>Purify obscurations through deity yoga, mantra recitation, and meditation on emptiness.</list>
<list>Accumulate merit through virtuous actions and wisdom through study and contemplation.</list>

**At Death:**

<list>Maintain recognition during the dissolution of the elements — do not panic, do not grasp.</list>
<list>Recognize the clear light that dawns after the black attainment as the Dharmakāya — your own true nature.</list>
<list>Recognize the bardo mandala of deities as your own self-display, not external entities.</list>
<list>Do not fear, do not grasp, do not judge — simply rest in the nature as it is.</list>

**For the Dying:**

<list>Read this text or similar bardo instructions to the dying person.</list>
<list>Remind them of their practice, their yidam, their guru — reawaken their recognition.</list>
<list>Guide them through the dissolution stages: earth into water, water into fire, fire into air, air into consciousness, consciousness into the clear light.</list>
<list>Encourage recognition of the clear light as their own nature — not to be feared but embraced.</list>

## COMMON PITFALLS

<ornament></ornament>

**1. Waiting Until Death:**
- **Error:** Thinking that bardo practice is something to be done at the moment of death only.
- **Antidote:** Practice NOW; bardo practice is the preparation that enables recognition then. Without preparation, there will be no recognition.

**2. Fear of Death:**
- **Error:** Viewing death as terrifying, to be avoided, or as defeat.
- **Antidote:** Recognize death as the greatest opportunity for liberation — the moment when the nature of mind is most accessible. Cultivate joy and confidence, not fear.

**3. Grasping at Rebirth:**
- **Error:** Seeking favorable rebirth for worldly reasons — comfort, status, pleasure.
- **Antidote:** Any rebirth should be chosen only to benefit beings. The bodhisattva does not seek ease but opportunity to serve; even a difficult rebirth is acceptable if it enables greater benefit.

**4. Neglecting the Path:**
- **Error:** Thinking that bardo practice replaces or supersedes lifetime practice.
- **Antidote:** Bardo practice IS the fruition of lifetime practice. Without the foundation of recognition cultivated during life, there will be no recognition at death. The bardo instructions are the capstone, not the foundation.

**5. Intellectual Understanding Without Direct Experience:**
- **Error:** Believing that knowing about the bardo stages intellectually is sufficient.
- **Antidote:** Direct recognition must be stabilized through practice. Intellectual knowledge dissolves under the intense pressure of death; only direct experience remains.

**6. Attachment to Accomplishment:**
- **Error:** Practicing with the motivation to attain rainbow body, relics, or recognition for egoistic reasons.
- **Antidote:** Practice with pure motivation — for the benefit of all beings. Attachment to signs of accomplishment becomes an obstacle itself.

## FOR SCHOLARS

<ornament></ornament>

Note the sophisticated integration of traditions within this chapter:

<list>**Sūtra:** The six higher knowledges (*abhijñā*) from classical Buddhism are incorporated as natural fruits of the path.</list>
<list>**Tantra:** The four knowledge-holders from Vajrayāna provide a graduated map of realization.</list>
<list>**Dzogchen:** Liberation in bardo through recognition of self-display — the unique Great Perfection approach.</list>
<list>**Unique Synthesis:** The bardo is presented not merely as a dangerous passage to be survived but as an opportunity for awakening — a distinctly Dzogchen perspective.</list>

**Critical Points:**

<list>**Bardo as Opportunity:** Not just a passage between lives but a chance for awakening that equals or exceeds this life.</list>
<list>**Preparation Essential:** The instructions cannot be effectively applied without prior practice and stabilization of recognition.</list>
<list>**Four Types Show Gradations:** Not all practitioners achieve the same result — the path respects individual capacity and effort.</list>
<list>**Integration with Thögel:** Bardo visions are identical to Thögel visions; those who have practiced Thögel are already familiar with what will appear at death.</list>

**Philosophical Framework:**

<list>**Conventional:** The bardo appears as a real transition with stages, deities, lights, and sounds — a genuine experience for the unprepared.</list>
<list>**Ultimate:** The bardo is the display of awareness, empty of inherent existence, not separate from the nature of mind itself.</list>
<list>**Unity:** Recognize the empty nature while navigating the appearance — neither denying the experience nor grasping at it as real.</list>

**Scripture Citations Referenced:**

<list>**Self-Arisen** (*rang shar*): The nature of mind that manifests as the bardo deities.</list>
<list>**Great Liberation through Hearing** (*bar do thos grol*): The classical bardo instructions, of which this chapter is a part.</list>
<list>**Thalgyur** (*thal 'gyur*): Root tantra of the Great Perfection, describing the nature of the bardos.</list>
<list>**Tantra of the Natural Liberation of Grasping** (*'dzin pa rang grol gyi rgyud*): On liberation through recognizing the nature of grasping.</list>

## CONNECTION TO SURROUNDING CHAPTERS

<ornament></ornament>

**Backward Connections:**

<list>**Chapter 20:** Thögel practice — prepares the practitioner for the bardo visions by revealing them during life. What appears in thögel is exactly what appears at death: the lights, deities, and mandalas.</list>
<list>**Chapters 14–19:** Ground, path, and method — all the preliminary and main practices lead to this fruition. Without the foundation, the bardo instructions cannot bear fruit.</list>
<list>**Preparation:** Lifetime practice of generation stage, completion stage, and Great Perfection meditation enables bardo liberation.</list>

**Forward Connections:**

<list>**Chapter 22:** Phowa (transference of consciousness) — offers an alternative path if bardo recognition fails. The practitioner can transfer consciousness to a pure land rather than navigating the bardo state.</list>
<list>**Chapters 23–25:** Culminating practices — all presuppose understanding of the bardo. The path is not complete without addressing death.</list>
<list>**Completion:** The full path from beginning to end of life — birth, practice, death, and beyond.</list>

**The Chapter's Strategic Position:**

Chapter 21 addresses **the completion of the path at death**:

<list>**Chapters 1–19:** Preparation and practice in life — building the foundation of virtue, wisdom, and recognition.</list>
<list>**Chapter 20:** Advanced completion stage (Thögel) — the highest practices of the Great Perfection.</list>
<list>**Chapter 21:** Death and bardo liberation — the moment of truth when recognition must manifest.</list>
<list>**Chapter 22:** Transference (phowa) — the safety net if recognition fails at death.</list>

This creates a complete path:

- **Life:** Practice, recognition, stabilization — building the capacity for liberation.
- **Death:** Dissolution, clear light, bardo — the opportunity for awakening.
- **Beyond:** Liberation or favorable rebirth — the fruition of the path.

**The Great Matter:**

<tantra>"Death is certain; the time of death is uncertain. Since death is the great matter, practice Dharma."</tantra>

This chapter addresses **the great matter directly**. It does not shy away from death but presents it as the culmination of the path. For the Dzogchen practitioner, death is not defeat but the final examination — either one recognizes and is liberated, or one takes rebirth to continue. The four knowledge-holders demonstrate that the path leads somewhere, that practice has result, that liberation is not merely a concept but a real possibility.

The knowledge-holder who achieves liberation in the bardo demonstrates that **recognition transcends the physical body**. When the winds dissolve and the elements separate, when consciousness is no longer bound to form, recognition remains. This is the proof of the Dzogchen view — that the nature is not dependent on the aggregates, that Rigpa is not the mind, that liberation is not a philosophical position but a living reality.

The rainbow body, the relics, the signs of accomplishment — these are not mere curiosities but **evidence that the path works**, that realization transforms matter itself, that the teachings of the Buddha are not empty promises but living truths. When the practitioner sees the clear light at death and recognizes it as their own nature, when the bardo mandala appears and is known as self-display, when rebirth is chosen deliberately to benefit beings — this is the fruition. This is what all the practice has been for.
