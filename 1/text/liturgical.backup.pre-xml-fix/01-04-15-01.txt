[3721] First:
[3722] Arisen, various, causeless, arisen appearance, signless, appeared—
[3723] That also, from the arisen-place, empty, appeared, liberated, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, nameless.
[3724] That also, is-not, extremes, definitive, reasoning-by, great-perfection, extremes, beyond, view, established.
[3725] Second:
[3726] Arisen primordial-wisdom is, knowing, other-on, not, relying.
[3727] Liberated mind is, cause-conditions, applied.
[3728] Arisen-liberated, non-dual, abiding, result, primordially, liberated.
[3729] That also, similar-appearances, self-pure, definitive, reasoning-by, great-perfection, appearance-from, liberated, desired.
[3730] Third:

[3731] Free from the extremes of is and is-not, beyond directional fixation,
[3732] Self-nature without reliance, causeless, primordially pure—
[3733] Beyond fabrication and correction, through primordial liberation the great expanse beyond extremes is set forth.
[3734] The great primordial wisdom of self-purified abiding, liberated from the beginning, is called "the exhaustion of self-basis."
[3735] This too, through the reasoning that engages deluded mind, is intended as self-liberation.
[3736] The essence is the nature of khra-bo (the variegated space).
[3737] Speaking of manifold existence:
[3738] Free from negation, directionless, self-arising everywhere—
[3739] In spontaneous play, beyond affirmation and negation, this is intended.
[3740] These divide into three:
<list> [3741] Assertion of existence corresponds to the Mind School, the khra-bo category;
<list> [3742] Assertion of non-existence corresponds to the Self-Essential Point, the khra-bo category;
<list> [3743] Assertion of both existence and non-existence corresponds to Supreme Instruction, the khra-bo category.
[3744] The first:
[3745] The essence of self-purified abiding, nowhere divided, not established as affirmation or negation, transcends conceptual construction.
[3746] Without duality in characteristic, it does not depart from the single wheel of mind's existence.
[3747] Through that very activity, unceasingly radiant—
[3748] It is called "the liberation of appearance and mind without duality."
[3749] This too, through the reasoning of thought-free self-nature, intends the primordial liberation of all phenomena, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa liberated from their own ground.
[3750] The second:
[3751] Through the self-nature of appearance-emptiness liberated from its own ground, dharmatā of mind is radiantly displayed in manifold forms.
[3752] Through liberation of non-appearance from its own ground, action is freed from virtue and non-virtue.
[3753] This too, through the reasoning of transformation into emptiness, establishes non-appearance as self-purified.
[3754] The third:
[3755] Through self-emptiness, primordially pure, not relying on action's cause and effect—
[3756] Through fabrication, it arises;
[3757] Through arising as emptiness, it liberates saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in all directions.
[3758] Through appearance and concept as ground, the reasoning of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's non-establishment appears.
[3759] Through inexpressibility, the essential point beyond thought;
[3760] Through being beyond comparison, the essential point beyond meditation;
[3761] Through liberation from the two of abiding and transformation, the essential point of mind free from transformation—
[3762] Through these three, the manifestation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's true form is intended.
[3763] The essence of white space, through the self-liberation of appearance and conditions, without fabrication, pure cause, not to be established in any mode of abiding.

[3764] Divided—
[3764] From action's vast expanse, the White Space of ineffable teaching,
[3765] From the union of view and meditation, the two White Spaces:
