[5269] "Arrive" means there is no place beyond that—complete manifestation.
[5270] These are like the form of the full moon,
[5271] The mandala complete through the waxing and waning, without fabrication upon self-essence.
[5272] Second, the explanation of the three measures in particular has three parts:
[5273] Outer visions,
[5274] Inner body measure,
[5275] Secret awareness measure.
[5276] The first is controlling the visions and the completion of the realms in luminous clarity.
[5277] 
[5278] 
[5279] 
[5280] 
[5281] 
[5282] 
[5283] 
[5284] 
[5285] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5286] The measure of completion having thus arrived—
[5287] Direct objective visions cease,
[5288] The vision of earth and stones melts away,
[5289] Self-knowing enters into everything,
[5290] Inert things move when directed,
[5291] The measure of wind's movement is grasped,
[5292] The body's dust-particles become visible.
[5293] Whatever appears becomes complete as form-bodies,
[5294] From that fathers and mothers embrace,
[5295] The five and five fathers and mothers unite,
[5296] All within the round periphery—
[5297] The yogin's body also luminous,
[5298] Appearing to go, come, and sit.
[5299] All is awareness arriving at its measure.
[5300] Second:
[5301] Purifying the dust of the body, from the heart center, white A, five light-rays coil like the sun's reflection in the heart-window, piercing into the light-star-window within the intermediate space.
[5302] Rising through the crown, wisdom wind abides, appearing naturally uplifted.
[5303] From the urna, five light-rays, one fathom, shine clearly.
[5304] Upon the five fingers of the hand, five lights garland and coil.
[5305] Through the doors of the body's pores and so forth, outer and inner parts smaller than the scope of dust-particles, each containing numberless lands and realms, measureless Buddhas and beings appear—these are all visions of the spontaneously accomplished eight doors dawning here, appearing to self-vision without excess or lack.
[5306] In the crown-palace, the wrathful mandala; in the heart, the peaceful mandala.
[5307] In all parts of the body, natural emanations,
[5308] Emanations taming beings,
[5309] Various emanations appear, doing the benefit of self-vision beings in Buddha-fields.
[5310] Through the door of compassion, the six clairvoyances and
[5311] The wisdom knowing all dharmas dawn.
[5312] Through the door of pure wisdom, the pure Buddha-fields complete as self-vision Sambhogakaya.
[5313] The mind's defilements purified, obtaining the separation from dust and doubt,
[5314] The latencies of ground and grounds self-purify. From the Thal 'gyur:
[5315] 
[5316] The body arriving at measure also becomes thus:
[5317] Free from the dust of individual bodies,
[5318] The light-star-window of intermediate space appears.
[5319] Then light-rays in the shape of hooks,
[5320] Subtle and coiling, hold the vision.
[5321] The body's dust naturally ceasing,
[5322] The copper-shining stainless light-body.
[5323] The A mark in the center,
[5324] And the urna's light-ray, one fathom measure.
[5325] The crown-uspa lifted by wind, appearing.
[5326] From the peaceful body's fingers,
[5327] Light-garlands coil in form.
[5328] Activity of silent mind,
[5329] From the skull palace of the head,
[5330] Herukas manifestly arise.
[5331] At this time, the self-body arrives at measure—
[5332] The copper-shining three bodies coil as one.
[5333] Third, the secret awareness measure:
[5334] Although the subtle and coarse moving mind is purified,
[5335] There exists merely the all-ground consciousness mind,
[5336] Dawn of awareness qualities, clairvoyance and unobstructed eye.
[5337] From that itself:
[5338] At this time the mind is clear,
[5339] Together with the six clairvoyances,
[5340] Far and concealed
[5341] Dharmas become known in a moment.
[5342] Measureless Buddha-realms and
[5343] Likewise bodies appear to mind.
[5344] Defilements exhaust in empty mind,
[5345] Nature unmoving obtains empty-luminosity.
[5346] Unmixed equal-complete pervades the expanse,
[5347] Through manifest clarity, not separate from the many.
[5348] Without parts, without elaboration.
[5349] That also: in the two upper visions, purifying the manifest defilements of affliction-mind and mind-consciousness,
[5350] At the time of obtaining this, through the purity of the first seven of the eight collections,
[5351] Free from subtle and coarse defilements,
[5352] The body-mind connection cut,
[5353] Outer visions' objects appear to awareness.
[5354] The investigating agent consciousness part, acting as self-condition through the power of all-ground consciousness,
[5355] Like a shooting star moving in the sky, the momentary investigating agent self-dawning, self-freeing, pure without looking to separate antidotes.
[5356] 
[5357] 
[5358] At the time of the two upper visions, wind is thrown outward and not held inward,
[5359] Arising through the ability to purify conceptuality not abiding in two moments,
[5360] The body copper-shining,
[5361] The all-ground consciousness part clear-vivid like fire-sparks of concept-free object-awareness emitting.
[5362] Seeing the two aspects of outer extending vision and inner self-vision, body and mind separate and cut,
[5363] Accomplishing the great mandala, the supreme ground of not returning outward to the three realms.
[5364] Again from the Thal 'gyur:
[5365] At all times of such vision,
[5366] The cutting of body-mind connection,
[5367] From the contaminated exhausted body also,
[5368] The mind with clear characteristics arising outward,
[5369] Like a shooting star emitting,
[5370] Clearly seen in the realm of space.
[5371] At the first times of that itself,
[5372] From separation from wind also,
[5373] Through the action of pure wind, effortful,
[5374] Arising from throwing outward from the body.
[5375] From the part of the two see-agents also,
[5376] The body luminous and pure,
[5377] The mind like fire-sparks emitting,
[5378] Not abiding as one, self-clear basis,
[5379] Arising in the manner of two vision aspects.
[5380] Through this, having cut body-mind connection,
[5381] There is no returning to the three realms.
[5382] At this time, the see-agent also, like a shooting star or fire-sparks, the all-ground consciousness part,
[5383] Together with the compassion-wisdom part of awareness,
[5384] Arise as the wisdom part seeing the two outer and inner objects.
[5385] At this time there is no intentionally setting gaze manner etc. through antidote,
[5386] For one never passes beyond the wheel of dharmata.
[5387] This is called "completion of practice measure."
[5388] Fourth, the dharmata-exhausting vision has two parts:
[5389] Brief showing of exhaustion manner, and
[5390] Extensive explanation of nature.
[5391] First:
[5392] From the vision like the full moon of previous measure-arrival,
[5393] The manner of self-resonance dissolving into the expanse,
[5394] Like the moon waning from that,
[5395] Again that body fading until reaching the bindu, certain vision to the first mind.
[5396] That applies in sequence to the manner of purifying the four visions through the fourfold sequence of container-contents' arising, abiding, destruction, and emptiness.
[5397] 
[5398] Similar to the increase and decrease of the four—birth, aging, sickness, and death—
[5399] The outer container's arising manner dissolves, and
[5400] The inner contents' beings' life measure rising and
[5401] Waning downward—the sign of exhaustion.
[5402] If these do not exhaust, the self is not free from the three realms.
[5403] Thus, through the exhaustion of the outer container world,
[5404] Support-ground not existing,
[5405] The vital point of no ground of return.
[5406] Through the exhaustion of inner contents' beings, the birth continuum cut,
[5407] Now awareness itself is separate from death.
[5408] Then, whatever essence vision may have, there is no establishment,
[5409] Difficult to express as "this is" or "this is not,"
[5410] Therefore called "dharmata exhaustion"—the meaningful result.
[5411] The result: difficult for a person to express "this is" or "this is not," for it is inconceivable.
[5412] Moreover, dharma exhaustion: at the time of measure-arrival, the dharmas of outer objects, inner body, together with dust, exhausted—here, the dharmas included by the all-ground consciousness mind exhausted,
[5413] And purifying the root non-awareness that abides as the dharmata of the three doors of the all-ground part.
[5414] Depending upon the dharmas of delusion,
[5415] That luminosity of vision without arising or destruction, abiding as ultimate dharmata,
[5416] Through the exhaustion of those two dharmatas, is called "dharmata exhaustion."
[5417] Vision: when that previous spontaneously accomplished vision, existing, dissolves inward, part by part going,
[5418] The primordially pure vision, like a cloudless sky, momentarily abiding naturally pure, is called "vision"—
[5419] Not like vision as entity and characteristic.
[5420] At this time, there is no reference even to mere dharmas—dharmata exhaustion.
[5421] The dharma-possessor object and
[5422] The dharmata's emptiness, the holding part, included by the object-possessor,
[5423] The time of return of the three realms' mind, mental-events, together with all-ground.
[5424] The manner of exhaustion:
[5425] Gradual and
[5426] Instantaneous, from the two.
[5427] Gradual exhaustion is at the time of the four visions arriving at measure.
[5428] Instantaneous exhaustion is through habituating having seen dharmata manifestly at first.
[5429] There is also exhaustion without the arising of visions of increasing experience and so forth—
[5430] This is called "supreme instantaneous mind."
[5431] Moreover, merely through each act of respect for the guru, greater than others, possessed of the potential of previously purified action—such an exhaustion manner merely exists.
[5432] Second, the extensive explanation of nature has five parts:
[5433] Essence,
[5434] Definition,
[5435] Nature,
[5436] Dharmata,
[5437] Boundary.
[5438] The essence of dharmata exhaustion:
[5439] Outer lights-five vision, together with bodies, exhausted;
[5440] Inner dust, together with concepts and aggregates, exhausted;
[5441] Experience vision objects exhausted,
[5442] Awareness abiding in a manner like the sky, the primordially pure vision.
[5443] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5444] The vision of dharmata exhaustion—
[5445] Experience vision emptying,
[5446] Body exhausted, sense objects also exhausted,
[5447] Free from concepts, aggregates, and delusion,
[5448] Separate from words of expressive basis.
[5449] Definition:
[5450] "Dharma" means the dharmas of body, speech, and mind aggregates, together with afflictions.
[5451] "Itself" is together with the part of meditating the luminosity vision of the purifying path.
[5452] "Exhaust" is "empty,"
[5453] Mind's meditation, together with object-vision, self-reversing, not existing—
[5454] Called "non-observation."
[5455] From that itself:
[5456] Thus the certain definition of dharmata—
[5457] To the gathering of dharma-knowing aggregates,
[5458] Doing actions and holding characteristics,
[5459] Making self-vision empty,
[5460] Holding individual families.
[5461] "Itself" is to the unfabricated,
[5462] Pervading the real through natural abiding,
[5463] To the unfabricated, original, continuous,
[5464] Exhausting the numbers of sounds, words, and names.
[5465] Nature:
[5466] Outer and inner vision-mind exhausted, activity merely upon primordially pure self-resonance like the resonance of blue-grey sky.
[5467] From the Rtsal rdzogs:
[5468] At this time, the characteristic of exhaustion—
[5469] Like the sky, free from action.
[5470] Dharmata has two parts:
[5471] The dharmata of vision:
[5472] Through the exhaustion of outer and inner dust, channels and winds exhaust.
[5473] Through that exhaustion, the subtle defilements, the seed-parts of latencies depending upon mind, with the characteristic of arising from all, also exhaust.
[5474] 
[5475] 
[5476] 
[5477] Abiding in the samadhi of continuity, not passing beyond the wheel of dharmata,
[5478] Controlling the great eye and clairvoyance, obtaining the power as regent of the dharma king of the three realms.
[5479] The all-ground subtle knowable obscurations very cut—except for being cut by merely a white silk curtain, there are no obscurations.
[5480] This is called "the result of path dharmas exhaustion."
[5481] Having cleared that, separation from all Buddha-obscurations, entering the primordially pure dharmakaya of the inner expanse, the very peace.
[5482] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5483] The dharmata of self-Buddha cessation:
[5484] Elements ceasing, dust ceases,
[5485] Dust and particles ultimately cease,
[5486] Not even a mere part abides.
[5487] Afflictions ceasing, delusion and
[5488] Concept-free attachment not abiding,
[5489] Latencies and all-arising
[5490] Not even dust-parts abide.
[5491] Thus through subtle and coarse cessation,
[5492] The five aggregates also gradually subtle at the end,
[5493] The body of four elements exhausted,
[5494] All is wisdom, Sambhogakaya.
[5495] Concept-free samadhi self-abiding,
[5496] Having exceeded the aggregates of fabrication,
[5497] "Dharma" does not abide in words.
[5498] The empty dharmata:
[5499] Through the exhaustion of coarse channels and winds, mind and mental-events exhaust.
[5500] The vision aspect of body and wisdom, like the measure-arrived full moon, also setting into the inner expanse, abiding in primordially pure vision,
[5501] This is expressed as "the dharmakaya vision, the core result dharmata, self-vision."
[5502] Again from the previous:
[5503] The dharmata of cause and result:
[5504] Coarse conceptuality source ceasing,
[5505] Memory self-pure from the continuum also,
[5506] Dependent-arising wind itself fully pure,
[5507] The dharmata arising from cause.
[5508] To the primordially pure nature,
[5509] The numbers of one and many exhaust,
[5510] Body and wisdom non-existent,
[5511] Arriving at the ground of exhausted dharmas—
[5512] Considered to be the result dharmata.
[5513] Moreover, delusion regarding these three later words.
[5514] 
[5515] 
[5516] Nyingtigpas who think that in the result primordially pure there is no body and wisdom having arisen—
[5517] That is a great error.
[5518] They have not understood the intention of that being said regarding the part like the resonance body and wisdom of outer vision, crystal light returning inward.
[5519] If in meaning there is nothing in the inner expanse, it contradicts spontaneous accomplishment;
[5520] Being unconditioned, it contradicts going to complete non-existence in the future;
[5521] It contradicts the arising of benefit for beings from the basis of dawn of body and wisdom from the expanse;
[5522] It contradicts Samantabhadra, having arrived at the end of pure basis expanse, showing the compassion and action of showing the path to beings and Buddhas—such faults exist in great number.
[5523] Such faults are not suitable to accept.
[5524] Fifth, the boundary:
[5525] At the time of beginning exhaustion from the measure-arrived curtain, there merely exists the clarity of five lights in the fingers of one's own four hands and feet,
[5526] The occasion from which there is outward entry into the inner expanse and
[5527] The boundary of inward return to outer vision.
[5528] Moreover, although that body form does not actually arise extensively as benefit for beings at this time,
[5529] Focusing awareness upon the light of the fingers,
[5530] Outer visions and
[5531] The luminosity of one's own body increasingly dissolve and go into the inner expanse,
[5532] From merely the pure blue of direct objective vision,
[5533] Like light-body fading and crystal light dissolving inward,
[5534] The self-resonance of body and vision also reverses,
[5535] Awareness abiding merely upon the depth resonance of body and wisdom within the shell of inner clear spontaneously accomplished jewel,
[5536] Like a shadow abiding in the self-lucidity of a crystal mirror, without even a mere part of vision in the blue of outer vision,
[5537] Awareness buddha-fied into dharmakaya, coiled.
[5538] If returning inward to outer vision, the sign that that body does not accomplish the equal of Buddha action,
[5539] Moreover, through control of birth and entry, awareness focusing compassion upon beings, that primordially pure vision without anything, self-reversing.
[5540] This vision of delusion-vision appears like a mirror's reflection,
[5541] And that self-body also, like the moon in water, self-appears as wisdom illusory body through copper-shining, free from elemental harm, obtaining the vajra body—
[5542] Called "arising as the great transfer body for the benefit of beings."
[5543] Others' impure eyes see merely dust together, not the copper-shining—
[5544] Like the great master Vimala and
[5545] Padma.
[5546] Then, having obtained control over birth and entry,
[5547] Although buddha-fied in a moment, there is delay,
[5548] Yet doing the benefit of beings until samsara is not empty, possessing self-power.
[5549] Control over birth:
[5550] At the occasion of entering the inner expanse, entering awareness into three thousand beings, obtaining the great power to free all simultaneously,
[5551] Even insects cease into light.
[5552] Having obtained control over birth, emanating whatever is desired, spontaneously accomplishing the benefit of beings.
[5553] Control over entry:
[5554] Although entering awareness into inert things, making them move and emit sound,
[5555] Through the dharma sound arising from lotus, wishing tree, jewel, and so forth, ripening all beings,
[5556] Making rain of food and clothes.
[5557] Moreover, having obtained these two controls over birth and entry following exhaustion at the occasion not-there of entering the inner expanse,
[5558] If not returning inward for beings' benefit, having made three thousand beings in the bardo free instantaneously, entering the expanse;
[5559] If doing, through control over birth, returning inward, gradually making three thousand free,
[5560] Doing whatever benefit for beings through many births and entries for kalpas numbering the dust of fields.
[5561] Through earth treasures,
[5562] Jewels,
[5563] Dharma classifications, and so forth—although benefit may be accomplished after a long time, there is not even a moment's passing in that means,
[5564] For compassion wonder arises from others and activity vision enters.
[5565] Those relying upon our holy gurus Vimala and Padmakara, such very sublime ones, are certain to be liberated without doubt in this life or the bardo.
[5566] This manner from the Guhyasamaja Seed Tantra:
[5567] When arriving at the ground of inner body exhaustion,
[5568] Fingers and so forth appear thus.
[5569] Focusing this, elements naturally cease.
[5570] Through the difference of birth and entry,
[5571] Upon the self-ground of all dharmas exhausted,
[5572] Without holding anything whatsoever,
[5573] One abides—this is the emanation body.
[5574] Through this, the power of entry's force,
[5575] Who has obtained self-power over birth,
[5576] Also focusing upon that,
[5577] Again at times doing thus,
[5578] The self-sound of vision rustling,
[5579] Manifestly reverses, appearing as delusion.
[5580] Through this, doing all benefit for beings,
[5581] For awareness is equal and one,
[5582] The great transfer of three thousand
[5583] Beings is accomplished by this.
[5584] Thus through gradual and instantaneous,
[5585] The body is accomplished by this.
[5586] All that is free from body-exhaustion measure.
[5587] All this, certain result,
[5588] Accomplishes the great mandala, supreme ground.
[5589] Thus the dawning of the four visions is called "the sequence of path-arising"—
[5590] Like the rungs of a ladder.
[5591] That also: from the part of abiding in the path, the dawn-agent does not cease;
[5592] From the part of obtaining the path, nothing whatsoever is unestablished.
[5593] Thus, through the four visions arriving at measure, buddha-fying without contaminated vision in this itself,
[5594] Especially sublime from the common vehicles,
[5595] Having met this dharma, one should make effort to practice with diligence.
[5596] Upon that itself:
[5597] For a person desiring to accomplish Buddhahood,
[5598] If possessing this means, it is thus.
[5599] For other conduct is pride itself,
[5600] Not seeing entity.
[5601] Therefore this is all rare words—
[5602] Always look to this jewel treasure.
[5603] Fourth meaning: the four instructions of extreme reliance are the back-support or closely-arisen support of the above.
[5604] 
[5605] 
[5606] That also: establishing basis through three unmoving in speech,
[5607] Holding measure through three vows,
[5608] Striking nails through three obtains,
[5609] Showing measure of freedom through four confidences.
[5610] From the Thal 'gyur:
[5611] Upon that, one should have faith in extreme reliance.
[5612] Through establishing basis in three unmoving,
[5613] Wind-mind arrives at the vital point.
[5614] Through holding measure with three abidings,
[5615] Reversing dreams and body, speech, and mind,
[5616] Certain holding of signs and measure.
[5617] Through striking nails with three obtains,
[5618] Contaminated aggregates not visible.
[5619] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[5620] Measure is the yoga of four confidences.
[5621] First, sealing the basis of nirvana through establishing basis with three unmoving:
[5622] Pressing the vital with three body-unmoving,
[5623] Clearing the path with three speech-unmoving,
[5624] Coiling wrapped in the gorge with three mind-unmoving.
[5625] First, to the three body-unmoving:
[5626] Bringing vital channels through pervading posture-unmoving,
[5627] Straightening the path through dawn-agent gaze-unmoving,
[5628] Blocking wind's going and coming through bind-draw unmoving.
[5629] First:
[5630] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[5631] The body's vitals are these three:
[5632] The lion manner and elephant manner,
[5633] Know like a rishi.
[5634] Regarding the emanation body posture:
[5635] Sound explanation and
[5636] Meaning division, from the two.
[5637] First:
[5638] Body straight makes channels straight,
[5639] Stretching made unmoving, wind arises continuously,
