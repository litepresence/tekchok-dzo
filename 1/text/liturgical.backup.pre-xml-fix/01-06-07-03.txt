[8725] Third: Mixing with mind, one becomes self-natured as mind.
[8726] Merging with the body relies upon the yantra of the body.
[8727] Speech is three syllables.
[8728] Mind is the extending and gathering of the wind.
[8729] Thus, having transferred that, taking it with a mirror at the end, with the ring-thumb it should fall into the student's mouth—this makes absolute and relative inseparable.
[8730] Also from before:
[8731] The student must drink at the mouth,
[8732] Not dying, must take with the tongue.
[8733] Thus it is.
[8734] Fifteenth: Thus, having transferred, holding the measure of experience of great bliss free of grasped objects arising in the student:
[8735] Pressing the two branches of the Rigveda channel, experience arises free of identifying the birthless; whatever is spoken is not known—like the experience of a mute's dream,
[8736] From that itself:
[8737] Regarding this, speaking is not known,
[8738] Like a mute's dream.
[8739] Thus it is.
[8740] Sixteenth: The key of dependent origination for not seeing that Mudrā:
[8741] The right eye of a black dog,
[8742] The left eye of a black jackal,
[8743] The right of an owl,
[8744] The left of a bat,
[8745] The right wing-tip of a crow—well joined, wrapped in a golden pill and placed in the Mudrā's mouth,
[8746] Holding the Ḍamaru and so forth in the hand, that itself sees while the body is not seen.
[8747] Also from before:
[8748] If the Mudrā is seen, Siddhi is not;
[8749] Therefore rely on non-seeing.
[8750] Thus it is.
[8751] Seventeenth: If it is not the time of Empowerment, or if bliss is not relied upon elsewhere, sending to one's own land and so forth by giving gifts—having pleased with articles of gold and so forth,
[8752] One must go to one's own place.
[8753] By these, the third Empowerment's difficult points are explained—this is the meaning of the very great secret.
[8754] Second meaning: the arrangement of the unelaborate Maṇḍala Empowerment: bestowing Empowerment by relying upon the Maṇḍala and Vase with the syllable wheel and verses.
[8755] This is the unelaborate secret Empowerment:
[8756] Introducing through the bliss of pressing the pure letter of speech's basis and the channel.
[8757] This has four: outer, inner, secret, and perfect:
[8758] The unelaborate outer: purifying through the letters of the Three Kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[8759] The inner: all Dharmas are unborn and so forth—the basis of the Vase is definite.
[8760] The secret: whatever things are natureless and so forth—appearing as liberated, indicating the absence of borders.
[8761] The perfect: all Dharmas are empty and selfless and so forth—the precious Empowerment of words to recite for special understanding.
[8762] These also from the Thalgyur:
[8763] Unelaborate, possessing faith, enter to ripen the outer;
[8764] The supreme Empowerment of non-elaboration,
[8765] Relying upon the Maṇḍala and Vase,
[8766] Bestow Empowerment with verses.
[8767] Thus it is.
[8768] Third: The very unelaborate Empowerment: bestowing Empowerment introducing the nature of primordial purity, self-knowing awareness empty like space, through the symbolic Empowerment dividing the border of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa.
[8769] This also has four from outer, inner, secret, and perfect:
