[685] From threefold expansion:
[686] Completion is this:
[687] From Self-Arisen,
[688] In three kayas' pure appearance,
[689] One complete, two complete, all complete—
[690] Wisdom-appearing, unceasing and clear,
[691] Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating,
[692] In concept-free awareness, pure,
[693] Five light-rays, unceasing and clear,
[694] In non-grasping great self-liberation,
[695] Outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.
[696] In action-released awareness,
[697] Actor and acted, all dharmas complete in single moment.
[698] In mind-separated awareness,
[699] All appearance variety complete in single moment.
[700] In self-appearance's great clear purity,
[701] Deluded appearances complete in single moment.
[702] In great self-liberated self-appearance,
[703] Other-arisen dharmas complete in single moment.
[704] Such is three kayas' completion manner.
[705] Thus it is said.
[706] Awakening is being without dualistic-grasping aspect—
[707] From that same nature:
[708] Without action, delusion awakens,
[709] Without concept, afflictions awaken,
[710] Without grasping, self-arising awakens,
[711] Without clinging, conceptual thought awakens,
[712] Without attachment, ignorance awakens.
[713] Such is three kayas' awakening manner.
[714] Thus it is said.
[715] By expansion is meant this:
[716] Qualities, primordially spontaneously accomplished, are expansive—
[717] From Self-Arisen,
[718] In concept-free awareness,
[719] Five lights clear, wisdom expansive,
[720] In actor-acted-separated awareness,
[721] Without perceived object, three kayas expand,
[722] In object-free appearing awareness,
[723] Without grasping mind, five lights expand,
[724] In awareness, great wisdom,
[725] Meaning-possessing self-appearance, fruit expands.
[726] Such is three kayas' expansion manner.
[727] Thus it is said.
[728] Second: place expansive explanation.
[729] Dharmakaya,
[730] Sambhogakaya,
[731] Nirmanakaya—three places' expansive explanations.
[732] The first also has:
[733] Essence,
[734] Definition,
[735] Self-body,
[736] Metaphor,
[737] Sign,
[738] Appearance,
[739] Place,
[740] Characteristic,
[741] Object,
[742] Intent—ten in total.
[743] Essence is this:
[744] Empty-clarity, cessation without inherent existence—
[745] From that same nature:
[746] Unchanging, cessation without, three-pervading—
[747] Dharmakaya essence.
[748] Thus it is said.
[749] Definition is this:
[750] Expanse, primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmata, clear-light kaya being—essence primordially pure, unchanging, without delusion—
[751] Naturally spontaneous, clear-light kaya, great self-abiding—
[752] From that same nature:
[753] Fearless, empty, and clear,
[754] All actions complete—
[755] This is dharmakaya's definition.
[756] Thus it is said.
[757] Self-body is this:
[758] Freed from all elaboration extremes, without anywhere accomplishment—
[759] From Self-Arisen:
[760] Without outer, without inner, without within expanse—
[761] This is dharmakaya's self-body.
[762] Thus it is said.
[763] Metaphor is this:
[764] Like sun through clear-light awareness;
[765] Like ocean through depth;
[766] Like lotus, unstained by defects;
[767] Like mountain, unchanging;
[768] Like space, vast without boundary or center;
[769] Like lion, possessing from primordial the confidence surpassing all—
[770] From that same nature:
[771] Sun, ocean, lotus,
[772] Mountain, space, lion—three:
[773] These are dharmakaya's metaphors.
[774] Thus it is said.
[775] Transcending going and coming is the sign—
[776] From Self-Arisen:
[777] Without going, without coming, without abiding—
[778] This is dharmakaya's self-sign.
[779] Thus it is said.
[780] Appearance is like sky-expanse's empty-clarity—
[781] From that same nature:
[782] Unceasing, clear tone, empty by essence—
[783] This is dharmakaya's appearance.
[784] Thus it is said.
[785] Place is great pure memory-thought—
[786] From that:
[787] Without limit, without object, without grasping—
[788] This is dharmakaya's place.
[789] Thus it is said.
[790] Characteristic is this:
[791] Essence, nature, compassion—three inseparable—
[792] From that same nature:
[793] Essence, nature, compassion—three:
[794] This is dharmakaya's characteristic.
[795] Thus it is said.
[796] Object is self-clear awareness, empty without extremity cut,
[797] Five lights adorned within, spontaneously accomplished self-tone,
[798] In expanse-awareness great inseparability, aspects individually unmixed—
[799] From Self-Arisen:
[800] Clear, luminous, unmixed—three:
[801] This is dharmakaya's object.
[802] Thus it is said.
[803] Intent is this:
[804] View unsevered by direction or side,
[805] Meditation not established as entity or sign,
[806] Conduct transcending both apprehending and grasping—
[807] Spontaneously accomplished, primordially liberated—great fruition,
[808] Primordially established, all meanings complete—enlightened activity.
[809] Unsought, self-abiding excellence-qualities indeed—
[810] Moreover from that same nature:
[811] Free from cessation, free from fixation, free from attachment—
[812] This is dharmakaya's conduct.
[813] Crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering—
[814] This is dharmakaya's meditation.
[815] Unseen, seeing-complete—view perfected—
[816] This is dharmakaya's view.
[817] Unmade, unarisen, free from arising—
[818] This is dharmakaya's fruition.
[819] Nothing to accomplish, accomplished-complete—accomplishment perfected—
[820] This is dharmakaya's enlightened activity.
[821] One arisen, two arisen, all arise—
[822] These are dharmakaya's excellence-qualities.
[823] Thus it is spoken.
[824] Second: Sambhogakaya's basis—five expansive explanations:
[825] Essence,
[826] Definitive meaning,
[827] Characteristics,
[828] Appearance mode,
[829] Abiding mode—thus.
[830] First: Essence—from Rangshar:
[831] Birth exists, yet death-free, possessing vajra,
[832] Five lights, five kayas, unmixed, individually clear,
[833] Possessing five fathers, five fields, five clusters,
[834] Possessing five primordials, five knowledges, five realizations,
[835] Possessing five bases, five paths, five fruitions,
[836] Possessing five abodes, five fields, five essences—
[837] This is sambhogakaya's complete essence.
[838] Thus it is spoken.
[839] Though expressed as birth from expanse's self-appearance arising aspect,
[840] In meaning, birth lacks self-characteristic, thus death-free—for death-lord demon is conquered.
[841] From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges—
[842] Arisen wisdom transcends all arising,
[843] Realizing wisdom transforms within meaning,
[844] In vast kayas, outer-inner aspects clear.
[845] Thus it is spoken.
[846] Five lights: dark blue, white, yellow, red, green.
[847] Five kayas:
[848] Essence-expanse kaya,
[849] Unchanging vajra-kaya,
[850] Dharmakaya,
[851] Sambhogakaya,
[852] Nirmanakaya—five.
[853] Five fathers:
[854] Vairochana, Akshobhya, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi.
[855] 
[856] 
[857] 
[858] 
[859] 
[860] 
[861] 
[862] 
[863] 
[864] 
[865] 
[866] Buddha-Lochana,
[867] Mamaki,
[868] Pandaravasini,
[869] Samayatara—five.
[870] Five clusters: surrounded by five—Akshobhya and others—periphery ornamented by five lights' enclosure.
[871] Five primordials:
[872] Five paths, primordially complete,
[873] Five kayas, primordially established,
[874] Rigpa, primordially arisen,
[875] Five lights, primordially resonant,
[876] Defilements, primordially liberated.
[877] Five knowledges:
[878] From realization's extent,
[879] Know as five kayas,
[880] Know as five wisdoms,
[881] Know as five lights,
[882] Know as self-appearance,
[883] Know as duality-free great liberation.
[884] Five realizations:
[885] Realize field as expanse,
[886] Realize beings as kayas,
[887] Realize appearance as light,
[888] Realize arise-liberation category-free,
[889] Realize wisdom as rigpa.
[890] Five bases:
[891] Light-clear basis: rigpa,
[892] Phenomena basis: kunzhi,
[893] Delusion basis: sems,
[894] Path basis: lamp,
[895] Thought basis: wisdom.
[896] Five common paths:
[897] Accumulation path,
[898] Application path,
[899] Seeing path,
[900] Meditation path,
[901] No-more-learning path—five.
[902] Five uncommon paths:
[903] Dharmata path: expanse,
[904] Rigpa path: knowledge,
[905] Light-clear path: two lamps,
[906] Trekcho path: arise-liberation,
[907] Thogal path: expanse-rigpa.
[908] Five fruitions:
[909] Wisdom fruition: liberated in rig,
[910] Light fruition: delusion-appearance ceases,
[911] Realization fruition: delusion-thought clears,
[912] Self-appearance fruition: brought to exhaustion,
[913] Final fruition: dissolves into expanse.
[914] Five abodes:
[915] Thigle abode: tsitta,
[916] Wisdom abode: crown,
[917] Lamp abode: eyes,
[918] Expanse-appearance abode: sky,
[919] Liberation-place abode: primordial purity.
[920] Five fields:
[921] Rigpa's field: expanse,
[922] Lamp's field: sky,
[923] Wisdom's field: bardo,
[924] Light's field: self-appearance,
[925] Sambhogakaya's field: cluster.
[926] Five essences:
[927] Rigpa's essence: primordial purity,
[928] Wisdom's essence: spontaneous accomplishment,
[929] Light's essence: five aspects,
[930] Wisdom's essence: realization,
[931] Lamp's essence: empty-clarity.
[932] Thus in five aspects appearing, some are sambhogakaya's essence.
[933] 
[934] Some are the field,
[935] Some are the method,
[936] Some are the appearance,
[937] Some are wisdom itself—thus Sambhogakaya is explained as one unified essence.
[938] Second, the etymology:
[939] Complete with qualities,
[940] Engaging in pure light-clarity,
[941] Both benefits spontaneously complete,
[942] Wisdom arrived at its full measure,
[943] With marks, signs, radiating light-rays body—the term "five" denotes Sambhogakaya.
[944] From Self-Arisen:
[945] Abiding in empty dharmata state—complete.
[946] Clear, unmixed, all-pervading—complete.
[947] In five wisdoms, gathering-separating not—complete.
[948] Unequal to all, individual marks endowed—complete.
[949] Method-wisdom, gathering-separating not, abiding—complete.
[950] Five appearances themselves, marks not abiding—engage.
[951] Without grasping, self-clear, playing in all—engage.
[952] Crystal-clear, lucid, all-equal abiding—engage.
[953] Vivid, soft, field-abiding, emanations distributing—engage.

[956] Vivid, soft, field-abiding, emanations distributing—engage.
[957] Two kayas benefit intent, play arrived at extent—engage.
[958] Grasping-free ground abiding, ten-directions emanations enacted—engage.
[959] All arising, producing, engaging arrived at extent—engage.
[960] Outer, inner, secret actions transcended—complete.
[961] Suddenly appearing reference-free benefit—complete.
[962] Not fallen toward any direction, without coming or going—complete.
[963] State-arisen, not made—complete.
[964] All actions transcended—complete.
[965] Emptiness-wisdom self-endowed.

[967] Wisdom unceased, method-playing.
[968] Clear without thought, grasping non-existent.
[969] Ornaments, forms, marks, characteristics held.
[970] Grasping-free, self-clear, essence-abiding—kaya.
[971] Individual colors, marks, characteristics held—kaya.
[972] Vajra-meaning itself, benefit-endowed—kaya.
[973] Meaning-signs themselves, marks-endowed—kaya.
[974] Without outer-inner, all-clear—kaya.
[975] Essence unchanging, color clear—kaya.
[976] Nature compassion, directions-arising—kaya.
[977] Thus it is spoken.
[978] Third, the characteristics:
[979] Five families' mandalas, unmixed, clear in tone:
[980] From Self-Arisen:
[981] Individual colors unmixed, marks held,
[982] Marks and exemplary features excellent, light-rays blazing,
[983] Father, mother, kaya-form held—
[984] These are Sambhogakaya's characteristics.
[985] Thus it is spoken.
[986] Fourth, appearance manner:
[987] From rigpa's single nature,
[988] From expanse-kaya, light-kaya radiates to directions performing benefit;
[989] Rigpa-kaya, unmoving from expanse, without change or transformation—two completions in self-appearance light-clarity field, the inner-outer appearance manner.
[990] From that same nature:
[991] In one nature, two essences—
[992] This is Sambhogakaya's appearance.
[993] Thus it is spoken.
[994] Fifth, abiding manner: expanse without acceptance or rejection,
[995] Space without duality,
[996] Five complete lights' vast expanse,
[997] Abiding in emanations-radiating great continuity.
[998] From Self-Arisen:
[999] Correctly produced, without reference,
[1000] Without entering or liberation mind,
[1001] How could grasping and engaging exist?
[1002] Beyond attachment and fixation words,
[1003] Beyond object-abandoning and abandoner-two,
[1004] Beyond field, mind, intellect.
[1005] In reference-free field,
[1006] Self-appearance cuts through words—appearance.
[1007] Grasping-free, liberated in its own place,
[1008] Emanations enacted in ten directions.
[1009] In reference-pure field appearance,
[1010] Wisdom arises in one cut.
[1011] In reference-free field appearance,
[1012] Marks liberate in their own place.
[1013] From that, emanations widely arise.
[1014] Thus it is spoken.
[1015] Third: extensively explained, Nirmanakaya ground—five aspects:
[1016] Essence,
[1017] Etymology,
[1018] Characteristic,
[1019] Division,
[1020] Examination method.
