[4684] These too, from the Pearl Garland:
<tantra> [4685] Ah! Thus all tantras—
<tantra> [4686] Supreme wonder, great!
<tantra> [4687] Thus all meanings explained.
<tantra> [4688] The tantra sequence:
<tantra> [4689] The two great root tantras explain all phenomena as one essence.
<tantra> [4690] The two explanatory mother and child tantras explain as leaves spreading.
<tantra> [4691] The two limb tantras explain like planets and stars arising from oceans.
<tantra> [4692] The two scripture-logic clear tantras explain like flowers opening.
<tantra> [4693] The four upadesha tantras explain as ripening results.
<tantra> [4694] The three intention-self-abiding tantras explain as seeing the peak.
<tantra> [4695] The two entering-self-liberation tantras explain as mindful basis and heart.
<tantra> [4696] The expert ritual tantras explain like a dog that does the messenger's work.
[4697] Thus it is spoken.
[4698] The Reason for Establishing Eight Sections:
[4699] If the two root tantras are lacking:
[4700] Like a trunk with rotten roots—branches cannot arise.
[4701] If the two explanatory mother and child tantras are lacking:
[4702] Like no leaves from that—no flowers arise.
[4703] If the two limb tantras are lacking:
[4704] Like climbing a cliff without limbs—one falls.
[4705] If the two entering-self-liberation tantras are lacking:
[4706] Like a corpse without a heart—cannot benefit others.
[4707] If the two scripture-logic clear tantras are lacking:
<list> [4708] Like no flowers on the stem—results do not arise.
<list> [4709] Like no flowers exist, results do not ripen in time—like so.
[4710] If the four upadesha tantras are lacking:
[4711] If no results, agriculture is meaningless—like so.
[4712] If the three intention-self-abiding tantras are lacking:
[4713] Like a person without eyes not knowing the way, unable to enter a city.
[4714] If the expert ritual tantra is lacking:
[4715] Like a watchdog gone, wealth lost to thieves.
[4716] Thus, lacking those eight: the condition of the teachings is incomplete.
[4717] If they exist, complete: appropriate and certain in eight.
[4718] If more than that: not needed.
[4719] The Name and Meaning of the Eight Sections Explained:
[4720] Root: penetrated like roots—intends gathering into rigpa.
[4721] Explanation: spreading like leaves—intends merging words and meanings.
[4722] Branch: coiled like a trunk—intends non-duality of space and awareness.
[4723] Scripture-logic:
[4724] Clear like a flower—intends holding and showing the lamp's self-face.
[4725] Upadesha: ripening like results—intends making three kāyas into paths.
[4726] Intention self-abiding: liberation path seeing—intends making results into paths.
[4727] Entering self-liberation: mindfulness-awareness path cultivated, courageous ones—intends showing the lamp's very self-face.
[4728] Expert ritual: complete upadesha scripture—intends protecting the holy teachings and abiding long.
[4729] Examining their letters: called "root"—dharma's root gathered into rigpa.
[4730] Rigpa's root: emptiness, nature, grasped and freed.
[4731] Holding that tantra: rigpa meets its own face.
[4732] Worn: samādhi abides in itself.
[4733] Read: expressed meanings appear in mind.
[4734] Explained: supreme and common siddhis obtained.
[4735] Meditated: samsara expelled.
[4736] Listening, exercising the wisdom of the state.
[4737] Upadesha elaboration, word-upadesha cast into words—meaning does not reach immediately.
[4738] Essence-gathered meaning-upadesha, without depending on words—buddhahood.

[4750] Clarity:
[4751] Knowledge clear—abides nowhere.
[4752] Faculty clear—distinguishes dharma and non-dharma.
[4753] Five faculties placed in themselves—the six aggregates merely tremble.
[4754] Holding those—transcend the three realms.
[4755] Entering emptiness, entering appearances—appearance-mind mouth-joined.
[4756] Entering appearance-emptiness—object and mind non-dual.
[4757] Self-liberated—uncontrived.
[4758] Expert:
[4759] Expert in time and crucial points: merely thinking accomplishes destruction.
[4760] Expert in action and completion: merely examining mind accomplishes without need for mantra and samādhi—steals life-force.
[4761] Expert in time mantra and samādhi: deity approaches, siddhis arise.
[4762] Expert in time approach-accomplish action-application: accomplishes self-wished benefits.
[4763] Expert in substance and offering: increases prosperity, accomplishes actions.
[4764] Thus established, from those:
[4765] For those liking mental elaboration—all shown.
[4766] For middling ones, those gathered into eight sections—accomplished by eight tantras.
[4767] For excellent ones, those transformed—tantra's meaning condensed.
[4768] Method divided: two.
[4769] Nature divided: three, five sufficient.
[4770] Excellent ones: meaning and word tantra two shown.
