[15778] First, the distinction between Wisdom Wind and Karma Wind:
[15779] Though the movement from the channels is essentially one,
[15780] How do Karma and Jñana diverge individually?
[15781] Or if they are different movements, they would be two natures—
[15782] If one, they cannot be two;
[15783] Yet as mere movement they are one.
[15784] Therefore it is not tenable that either Saṃsāra or Nirvāṇa arises from merely one.
[15785] The answer: Though essentially one as mere movement, from the movement of channels twisting or not twisting,
[15786] When it becomes Wisdom Wind, the action is bliss-power,
[15787] Emptiness and
[15788] Clarity-emptiness; therefore it is called Wisdom Wind.
[15789] From the twisting or not of channel locations, when it becomes Karma Wind,
[15790] The action produces various discursive thoughts and various non-virtuous connections,
[15791] Unclear and
[15792] Dull and
[15793] Agitated and
[15794] Torpid and
[15795] Coiled, etc.—these defective winds arise.
[15796] For example, the single son of a cowherd, when angered, transforms into a tiger;
[15797] When not angered, becomes a human again—
[15798] Similarly, though the wind of movement from the resonance of Awareness and the channels of the body is essentially one,
[15799] From whether the channels twist or not,
[15800] Consciousness becomes suitable work—Jñana—and
[15801] From unsuitability becomes Karma or defilements.
[15802] Thus arising from circumstances, there is no defect.
[15803] Second, the explanation of their individual actions has two parts:
[15804] Jñana and
[15805] Karma Wind actions.
[15806] First, the actions of Wisdom Wind are fourfold Jñana:
[15807] From the aspect of the wind abiding, it performs the work of Ground-Abiding Jñana;
[15808] Through this action, however it appears,
[15809] It cannot change otherwise from atop the actual state.
[15810] From the aspect of appearance, it performs Characteristic-Holding Jñana;
[15811] Through this action, each family, Body, Jñana, light, and color shine clearly—passing beyond is impossible.
[15812] Though thus clear, as there is no attachment to that, it is called Jñana.
[15813] From the aspect of arising, it performs Knowables-Gathering Jñana;
[15814] Through this action, benefit for self and other is accomplished without obstruction.
[15815] Though doing this, action and doer are not within one's own continuum.
[15816] From the aspect of movement, it performs Consciousness-Gathering Jñana;
[15817] Through this action, various differences of worldly and transcended knowledge arise.
[15818] Though these arise, there is no grasping of self and self-possession.
[15819] Thus these four certainties are at the time of cause;
[15820] At the time of Path, they become the Ultimate Four Elements;
[15821] At the time of Fruition, they ripen as the essence of the Four Bodies.
[15822] Thus referring to Ground, Path, and Fruition, twelve arise—
[15823] This is the certain cause for the arising of the Twelve Buddha Activities.
[15824] Second, the four actions of Karma Wind's work:
[15825] Moving from the right produces male;
[15826] Moving from the left produces female;
[15827] Going outside causes entry into various appearances; filling inside causes various thought-groups to spread.
[15828] The certainty of right and left timing ripening as male and female is due to father and mother's power.
[15829] By nature, moving from the right performs the work of transfer and
[15830] Brings the end of karma near;
[15831] When moving from the left, it performs the work of grasping.
[15832] Going outside and filling inside is the power of going and coming:
[15833] Going outside performs happy work;
[15834] Coming inside makes unhappy.
[15835] These two also arise as day and night from the essential point of the Wheel's spreading and gathering.
[15836] That also: from the aspect of going outside, day-appearance arises;
[15837] From the aspect of filling inside, night-appearance arises.
[15838] Thus, the four actions of the two being counted as two-two becomes eight.
[15839] Those also, when counted by parts, are located as twenty-four.
[15840] From Karma Wind's differences, the twelve are the twelve actions of change:
[15841] They perform the work of body's increase and decrease.
[15842] Through that: outside, twelve years;
[15843] Inside, twelve months;
[15844] Secretly, twelve times arise.
[15845] Then Karma Wind performs various Saṃsāra works.
[15846] Third, the measure of change:
[15847] Thus, once the body has ripened and age has come to its prime, for one day-night period,
[15848] The measure of change of each of the Four Element winds:
[15849] Earth Wind: five thousand four hundred;
[15850] Water and
[15851] Fire and
[15852] Wind winds: also five thousand four hundred each, gathered together—
[15853] Twenty-one thousand six hundred is the certain measure of change for one prime age.
[15854] Youth not complete with teeth-two is due to elements not being fully developed.
[15855] When calculating life span during the time of wind element predisposition sleep,
[15856] Long wind transfer brings life to its end;
[15857] Short does not bring it.
[15858] Fierce: possesses merit and enjoyment;
[15859] Attached: certainly disease and suffering.
[15860] Slow: Saṃsāra disease few;
[15861] Slow: body weapons gather, virtuous mind does not arise.
[15862] Pressed: constant non-virtue and harm, decrease located;
[15863] Agitated: mind-agitated and beings not kind.
[15864] Also, aged ones not complete with fifty-eight:
[15865] Element rank damaged.
[15866] If very agitated, this makes life time quick;
[15867] Dull: suffering and sorrow and lamentation engage;
[15868] Swirl: mind not reaching actual state, non-virtuous engage;
[15869] Slow: life end extends and constant bliss;
[15870] Khyig: constant enemy and dispute cause does not arise;
[15871] Khyog: constant action happy and life short;
[15872] Gyur: enjoyment great and disease certain;
[15873] Rgal: body and speech work not accomplished;
[15874] Increase: pacify-increase work quickly accomplished.
[15875] Thus body enemy flourishes and constant suffering.
[15876] Gap: shows good and bad.
[15877] From prime age, if three hundred are not complete, life time is made in one year;
[15878] If fifty not complete, two years;
[15879] If thirty-two not complete, three years;
[15880] If twenty-one not complete, four years;
[15881] If one-eighth not complete, seven months;
[15882] If one-sixth not complete, five months;
[15883] If one-fourth not complete, one month; if one-tenth not complete, twenty-nine days;
[15884] If twenty not complete, eighteen;
[15885] If thirty not complete, ten;
[15886] If forty not complete, seven;
[15887] If sixty not complete, five days.
[15888] Thus regarding wind calculation application:
[15889] Worldly and
[15890] Transcended—two.
[15891] Worldly life and merit and
[15892] Bliss-suffering, etc.
[15893] Regarding transcended:
[15894] From change measure and transfer time—two.
[15895] Change measure:
[15896] Day aspect changes into twelve; night aspect changes into sixteen.
[15897] Day is the individual action of elements, riding horses of various bliss-suffering and virtuous-non-virtuous thought-groups.
[15898] Night also is similar to that,
[15899] Making Wisdom Wind increase.
[15900] Transfer time has already been explained.
[15901] Third topic: the detailed classification of Abiding Bindus.
[15902] <tantra>From the Thalgyur:
[15903] "Wishing to demonstrate the dharma-nature of bindus,
[15904] First from the ultimate and the relative,
[15905] Temporarily, regarding relative bindus,
[15906] Relying upon these, those desiring buddhahood
[15907] Should seek a consort of complete characteristics—
[15908] Gods and antigods, Brahmā,
[15909] Or if outcaste tīrthika,
[15910] Seeing those of complete characteristics,
[15911] Having definitely begun the application of attraction,
[15912] The object of reliance and the channels,
[15913] Accomplish the bodies of the objects of meditation.
[15914] Then the relative bindu itself:
[15915] Drop and hold and reverse,
[15916] Strike to the channels and mix with wind,
[15917] Emptiness, object of reliance, mind follow-cut.
[15918] Body and mind itself: reverse understanding.
[15919] Relying upon the ultimate bindu,
[15920] Obtain the objects of Dharmakāya Emptiness.
[15921] Bindu, lamp of empty Emptiness,
[15922] Inserted, train Awareness' potentials.
[15923] Day-night without difference: familiarization training—
[15924] This itself appears as effort-free.
[15925] That is the measure of mastery."
[15926] Thus it is taught.
[15927] The Near Path of Secret Mantra relies upon the essential points of channel, bindu, and wind.
[15928] Here there are two systems: the effort-possessing elaborated system and
[15929] The effort-free system free from elaboration.
[15930] Through elaboration-artifice, using coarse channels and winds with effort to make path—
[15931] Temporarily making relative bindu into yoga:
[15932] Seeking the consort, attracting, serving,
[15933] Seeking the channels, holding, performing the application,
[15934] Main part: dropping the bindu, holding, reversing,
[15935] Bestowing potential, mixing with wind, meditating as dharma-nature,
[15936] Afterward examining experience,
[15937] Training in the experience of reversing body-mind, etc.—
[15938] These were elaborated in detail above at the occasion of the Third Empowerment.
[15939] That also: at the time of Karma Wind, holding bindu;
[15940] At the time of Jñana, reversing bindu and bestowing potential is the correct essential point.
[15941] The yogi without elaboration
[15942] Makes the Clear Light bindu directly into path
[15943] By determining sitting posture and gazing posture.
[15944] At the time of first action, inserting the lamp of empty bindu and meditating,
[15945] One engages in Clear Light appearance, day-night mixed.
[15946] That also: the relative bindu dwells in the Rasanā,
[15947] Making that into path is the method of Union Father-Mother;
[15948] In the left, the essential bindu dwells as merely the tone of pure subtle natural expression in the self-tone of light.
[15949] This is the meaning of transforming the essence of mouth-pair bliss into Emptiness.
[15950] In the center dwells the Dharmakāya bindu: elaboration-free Clear Light, pure, self-arising Jñana—
[15951] The blazing lamp as basis.
[15952] This itself is extensively explained below.
[15953] <verse>That also, from the Pearl Garland: "From the channels are bindus—subtle and trembling by nature, beautified by light rays themselves."</verse>
[15954] <verse>"That also has three parts: right, left, and center. Right is relative bindu—possessing the essence of Great Bliss, source of gathered bliss, great secret of all Buddhas, nature indicated by method."</verse>
[15955] <verse>"Possessing the nature of ultimate Dharmakāya, single bindu of empty-luminosity, dwells in center, essence clear; emanation-withdrawal, beyond speech and thought objects; gradually free from thought; existence-nonexistence, beyond both limits; eternal-nihilism: no dwelling in extremes; without thought, spontaneously accomplished; without expression, empty by nature—ultimate thing-bindu."</verse>
[15956] <verse>"In the left, essential bindu dwells, bliss-union spread in two, not firmly dwelling, by mouth-pair itself obtaining bliss; cause of Mahāmudra itself, path of Great Bliss Great Jñana, Secret Mantra, all-lord Maṇḍala, great method saving Saṃsāra, secret wisdom-tone blazing light—that is Great Bliss essence." Thus.</verse>
[15957] Thus both aspects: effort-possessing coarse purification and
[15958] Effort-free self-placed—both are taught in this Vehicle.
[15959] Especially for those of supreme intelligence,
[15960] Pressing body-speech essential points, mind spontaneously freeing,
[15961] Jñana actually appearing, making the Three Bodies into path—
[15962] The bindu essential point supreme, unsurpassable, is taught.
[15963] Therefore this is the essential point surpassing all Vehicles.
[15964] From the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle's Dharma Price:
[15965] Detailed explanation of Certain Essential Points—the Twelfth Lecture Hall.
[15966] Thus having demonstrated the body of predispositions with distinctions,
[15967] Now the presentation of the supports of Jñana, the Four Lamps, with distinctions:
[15968] Brief presentation of the Four Lamps' essence and
[15969] Extensive explanation of their nature.
[15970] First:
[15971] At the time when the body first develops, depending upon water, previously developing within the knot of the generative channel,
[15972] The Lamp of the Eye and the Elemental Eye develop first.
[15973] From the Elemental Eye, the manner of body of Four Elements was explained earlier.
[15974] From the Lamp of the Eye arises the appearance of Jñana: light, bindu, body, etc.—
[15975] The ultimate, transcendental basis in the center of the A-fruit of the two eyes—
[15976] Two like deer horns, base subtle, tips large, develop:
[15977] This is called the Far-Cast Water Lamp.
[15978] Relying upon that, the Empty Bindu Lamp,
[15979] The Self-Arising Prajñā Lamp,
[15980] The Pure Expanse Lamp—four arise.
[15981] <verse>From the Pearl Garland: "The path of beings is the Arising Gateway; that itself: right two, left two, center—abiding as blazing lamps. Empty Bindu Lamp and Pure Expanse Lamp and Self-Arising Prajñā and Far-Cast Water Lamp—appearing to the seen objects."</verse>
[15982] <verse>From Self-Arisen: "These Four Lamps: Empty Bindu Lamp, Awareness Expanses Lamp, Self-Arising Prajñā Lamp, Far-Cast Water Lamps—dwell in all sentient beings." Thus.</verse>
[15983] That also: through the purity of the ultimate Four Elements, they ripen as Four Lamps.
[15984] Thus both aspects: effort-possessing coarse purification and
[15985] Effort-free self-placed—both are taught in this Vehicle.
[15986] Especially for those of supreme intelligence,
[15987] Pressing body-speech essential points, mind spontaneously freeing,
[15988] Jñana actually appearing, making the Three Bodies into path—
[15989] The bindu essential point supreme, unsurpassable, is taught.
[15990] Therefore this is the essential point surpassing all Vehicles.

[15997] First:
[15998] At the time when the body first develops, depending upon water, previously developing within the knot of the generative channel,
[15999] The Lamp of the Eye and the Elemental Eye develop first.
[16000] From the Elemental Eye, the manner of body of Four Elements was explained earlier.
[16001] From the Lamp of the Eye arises the appearance of Jñana: light, bindu, body, etc.—
[16002] The ultimate, transcendental basis in the center of the A-fruit of the two eyes—
[16003] Two like deer horns, base subtle, tips large, develop:
[16004] This is called the Far-Cast Water Lamp.
[16005] Relying upon that, the Empty Bindu Lamp,
[16006] The Self-Arising Prajñā Lamp,
[16007] The Pure Expanse Lamp—four arise.
[16008] <verse>From the Pearl Garland: "The path of beings is the Arising Gateway; that itself: right two, left two, center—abiding as blazing lamps. Empty Bindu Lamp and Pure Expanse Lamp and Self-Arising Prajñā and Far-Cast Water Lamp—appearing to the seen objects."</verse>
