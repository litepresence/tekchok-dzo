[1463] From ten onward, some abandon the killing of life, and at that time the life span increases by twenty years.
[1464] Likewise, abandoning the taking of what is not given, forty years,
[1465] Abandoning misconduct, one hundred years,
[1466] Abandoning divisive speech, two hundred years,
[1467] Abandoning idle speech, five hundred years,
[1468] Abandoning harsh speech, one thousand years,
[1469] Abandoning covetousness, two thousand years,
[1470] Abandoning harmful intent, ten thousand years,
[1471] Abandoning wrong view, twenty thousand years,
[1472] Abandoning ignorant attachment to desire, forty thousand years,
[1473] Abandoning wrong practice of dharma, eighty thousand years become the norm.
[1474] As life increases, so too form and enjoyment increase,
[1475] Spreading forth in prosperity.
[1476] Then again, eighteen sections of decrease and increase—each called an intermediate gap.
[1477] Third, the upward increase of one:
[1478] From similar calculation, custom prevails after the completion of the intermediate gap.
[1479] 
[1480] Called without beginning, long enduring, passing to countless ages, suddenly decreasing.
[1481] Between these, from the light of beings' merit arise:
[1482] Virtue,
[1483] Buddha,
[1484] Dharma,
[1485] Sangha,
[1486] Where countless completely white dharma enumerations dwell,
[1487] From non-merit arise:
[1488] Suffering, wrong paths,
[1489] Perverted teachers,
[1490] Enumerations of philosophical views,
[1491] Actions, afflictions, and so forth,
[1492] The six classes of beings,
[1493] The four modes of birth,
[1494] Individual objects of light,
[1495] Enjoyment,
[1496] Engaging various pleasures and pains through light.
[1497] Then twenty intermediate eons of destruction:
[1498] From complete abiding, the light of change arises,
[1499] That also: nineteen intermediate eons destroy the essence,
[1500] One destroys the vessel—twenty pass.
[1501] The manner of beings' destruction:
[1502] Beginning from the hell realms, no new births arise in this world-forest,
[1503] Those transferred from old lives in hell, preta, and animal realms depart from this land,
[1504] Empty, new ones are not born—the lower realms are destroyed.
[1505] That also: certain births to new lower realms by misdeeds performed exist here, going to other lands' lower realms, empty, not born here.
[1506] Then humans are destroyed: gradually decreasing life span, dying by disease in an eon when life is ten years,
[1507] Passing through three small eons of harm by weapons and famine,
[1508] One human obtains concentration, two others without being taught by anyone on this Jambu continent,
[1509] From that arising, speaking of extreme bliss, this joy arisen from seclusion,
[1510] Effortlessly heard by all, equipoise accomplished, born as a light god,
[1511] Thus Jambu continent becomes empty,
[1512] The Body-Elevated continent and Cow-Enjoyment also become likewise.
[1513] Sound-Not-Heard becomes the abode of the Thirty-Three.
[1514] 
[1515] From the Four Great Kings to Great Brahmā, the pattern is likewise.
[1516] The vessel is destroyed: one sun arises, extremely hot in the sky, burning grass and trees.
[1517] Two arise, drying rivers, streams, and ponds.
[1518] Three arise, drying great rivers and streams.
[1519] Four arise, drying the never-warm lake.
[1520] Five arise, drying the great ocean.
[1521] Six arise, drying the great land with snow-mountains.
[1522] Seven arise, burning all hundred ten-million spontaneously-arisen seven mountains and so forth,
[1523] From swirling blazing flames,
[1524] Below reaching the gold ground of the hell realm,
[1525] Above thoroughly blazing between the world of Brahmā.
[1526] Seven times burned by all thorough blazing, not even ash remains.
[1527] Seven suns and seven blazes, seven fires.
[1528] Then below, the base of clear pure water is disturbed and scattered, pervading seven times the extent of the second concentration,
[1529] Destroyed with measureless palaces like salt dissolved in water.
[1530] That water seven times.
[1531] Then below, a wind vajra-cross arises, all scattered, destroyed below the third concentration, becoming one sky.
[1532] Thus after the destruction of form's abiding, one nature sky remains empty.
[1533] That also: in the common vehicle likewise, twenty-eight tens of intermediate eons are regarded as one great eon.
[1534] The pure: birth, aging, sickness, and death—four that join inner form's destruction and emptiness.
[1535] From result-transmission,
[1536] Meaning: destruction and form,
[1537] Abiding itself and emptiness,
[1538] Birth, aging, sickness, and death,
[1539] Existence's illusion-wheel itself.
[1540] Thus said, joined together.
[1541] That also: from first measureless to the end ten, twenty with the first final gap,
[1542] Upward birth, downward decrease, not decreasing beyond ten—only that much,
[1543] Disease, weapons, and famine—each a small eon exists.
[1544] 
[1545] Such is the final end.
[1546] From that point, all vessels and essences are utterly destroyed.
[1547] These as well—the three abodes of destruction and emptiness—
[1548] In this uncommon vehicle, the intermediate eons are counted as equal: sixty by sixty, comprising the first great eon of one hundred eighty duration-measures.
[1549] The duration-eon of one hundred eighty is termed the "intermediate eon, the second."
[1550] The intermediate eon of one hundred eighty is considered the "single great eon."
[1551] These also arise from the very nature of transformation.
[1552] This transformation of time unfolds as follows:
<tantra> [1553] From the primordial measureless beginning,
<tantra> [1554] Through the ten terminal intervals,
<tantra> [1555] There is ascent and descent, birth and diminishment.
<tantra> [1556] Disease, famine, weapons, and strife—
<tantra> [1557] Three lesser eons bridge the intervals.
<tantra> [1558] The sixty are exhausted by fire,
<tantra> [1559] Seven by fire, seven by water.
<tantra> [1560] Thus fourteen are completed,
<tantra> [1561] And the remainder is dissolved by wind.
<tantra> [1562] Thus the sixty abide,
<tantra> [1563] And the duration of destruction is of similar measure.
<tantra> [1564] The interval of sixty abides as emptiness.
<tantra> [1565] Thus from one hundred eighty,
<tantra> [1566] The first duration-eon is established.
<tantra> [1567] Thus one hundred eighty
<tantra> [1568] Constitute the second intermediate eon.
<tantra> [1569] Thus that which is joined together is
<tantra> [1570] The single great eon.
<tantra> [1571] Thus it is taught.
[1572] These detailed explanations with their definitive meanings are
[1573] As extensively taught in the extensive tantra of the wish-fulfilling tree.
[1574] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[1575] The presentation of the world of vessels and essences, in two volumes.
[1576] Thus having instructed and shown the sequence of vessels and essences,
[1577] Now, regarding the enumeration of phenomena and aggregates existing in the elements of those three vajra-states:
[1578] From the tantra of the union of sun and moon:
[1579] The elements, the aggregates,
[1580] The sense-sources, the powers,
[1581] The objects and the awarenesses possessed of duration—
