[11182] From that:
[11183] Effort-possessing person,
[11184] Body signs complete,
[11185] In bardo reality,
[11186] See truth, buddha.
[11187] Body possessing speech signs,
[11188] This in emanation field,
[11189] Breath-out, take one birth.
[11190] Who possesses mind signs,
[11191] This between two births
[11192] Of life formation,
[11193] Like shooting star in sky,
[11194] In three instants as shooting way,
[11195] With emanation also,
[11196] Self-dissolves into essence.
[11197] If body, speech, mind signs gather,
[11198] This great bodhicitta,
[11199] Compassion possessing beings' holder,
[11200] This for holding beings,
[11201] In hundred thousand million years,
[11202] Even with one human body,
[11203] Completing this meaning,
[11204] Not entering between two births,
[11205] Complete attainment.
[11206] Also whoever fortunate,
[11207] Possessing body and mind signs,
[11208] Thus possessing, in ten years,
[11209] Dissolves elements to self-place,
[11210] Appearance not appearing,
[11211] Delivers to pure reality ground.
[11212] Who body, speech, mind signs,
[11213] Thus to fortunate person,
[11214] To whoever fortunate gathering,
[11215] Even in two years from this,
[11216] Dissolves this elements to self,
[11217] Without doubt this changes.
[11218] 
[11219] 
[11220] 
[11221] 
[11222] 
[11223] 
[11224] 
[11225] 
[11226] 
[11227] 
[11228] 
[11229] 
[11230] 
[11231] 
[11232] 
[11233] Outer-inner certain signs exist as liberate measure thus. Liberate not pervaded by merely existing signs. Because liberate pervaded by existing signs, this special is important.
[11234] From Blazing Relics:
[11235] All body, speech, mind signs,
[11236] Some arisen person,
[11237] Not completely liberated—
[11238] Worldly common siddhi and
[11239] Gradually sravaka pratyekabuddha,
[11240] All these grounds,
[11241] This entered that ground,
[11242] Without pure great result.
[11243] Who possesses body, speech,
[11244] Signs complete person,
[11245] Even in equal great ground,
[11246] All these go, dakini.
[11247] Thus said signs only exist without certainty. Now without any outer-inner liberate signs, gone without meditation, action not harm, meditation not needed. Later do not place skull on head. Though saying view-meditation complete, seeing reality original meaning, know demon enters deceiving other and self both by sending lie.
[11248] From that:
[11249] Thus not possessing signs,
[11250] Entering confidence in own-appearance,
[11251] Who claims acceptance that,
[11252] Examination view and
[11253] Likewise examination meditation—
[11254] All these liberate,
[11255] This not able,
[11256] Long in samsara,
[11257] This person also dwells.
[11258] That also: instruct with special diligence to leap-over meditation yogin because these signs arise without deception, certain liberation.
[11259] From that:
[11260] Therefore expanse-awareness familiar important.
[11261] Who familiar with expanse and awareness,
[11262] Those signs explained above,
[11263] Impossible to not arise.
[11264] Do diligence as well spoken.
[11265] General meaning third: conclusion of signs certain of liberation and confusion in bardo and next life—two aspects.
[11266] 
[11267] 
[11268] 
[11269] 
[11270] 
[11271] 
[11272] 
[11273] 
[11274] Signs of yogin liberating and obtaining enlightenment, and showing signs of six beings taking birth through confusion.
[11275] Of the first, two aspects:
[11276] Brief showing of signs,
[11277] Extensive explanation.
[11278] Of the first:
[11279] Even meditating reality direct meaning, if diligence inferior, measure not reached. At time of separating solid-awareness with stone, signs of liberating from defilements without taking existence—complete buddhahood by great appearance of self-relics, sound, and light.
[11280] That also: Great Perfection's system has two buddha ways—complete buddha by appearing signs is nirvana with remainder, stone with residue; perfectly complete buddha by excellent diligence, pure stone with, is nirvana without aggregates' remainder.
[11281] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror Tantra:
[11282] Nirvana that also two:
[11283] Perfectly complete buddha and
[11284] Complete buddha.
[11285] Of that, perfectly complete buddha is
[11286] Buddhahood without aggregates' remainder.
[11287] To complete buddha person,
[11288] Light and
[11289] Sound and
[11290] Relics and
[11291] Kaya and
[11292] Earth move etcetera arise, said.
[11293] From Blazing Relics:
[11294] Excellent wisdom-power person,
[11295] Elements dissolve to self-place
[11296] From confusion appearance this,
[11297] To essence result,
[11298] Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
[11299] Result becomes self-ground.
[11300] Thus outer signs,
[11301] What from nirvana,
[11302] To that kaya and relics and
[11303] Likewise light and sound and
[11304] Earth moves.
[11305] Second, extensive explanation—five:
[11306] Kaya, relics, light, sound, and earth move.
[11307] Of the first, essence, division, cause, place, and result.
[11308]

[11312] 
[11313] 
[11314] 
[11315] 
[11316] 
[11317] 
[11318] Essence: appearing as deity forms—single kaya, half-kaya, father-mother, mass, great mandala; according to that direction, stupa, wheel, vajra, jewel, lotus, cross, sword, etcetera.
[11319] From not reaching creation-completion, letters, hand-symbols, half-kaya, self-single appear; from complete, father-mother, mass, mandala appear.
[11320] Division: peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya two.
