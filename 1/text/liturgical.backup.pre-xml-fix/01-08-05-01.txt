[10758] The natural expression of spontaneous presence, clarity of subtle inner clarity, dwells.
[10759] The essence of appearance is empty, the nature of emptiness dwells clear—the heart of awareness is form and pristine cognition, primordially without gathering or separation, dwelling like the heart of the sun.
[10760] The essence being primordially pure and the nature being spontaneously accomplished are held to be non-dual.
[10761] From the Rangshar:
<tantra> [10762] "The basis is spoken of as having two aspects:
<tantra> [10763] The basis of great primordial purity, and
<tantra> [10764] The basis of variegated spontaneous presence."
<tantra> [10765] Thus it is said.
[10766] From the Klong drug pa:
<tantra> [10767] "The essence itself is primordially pure;
<tantra> [10768] The nature is spontaneously accomplished."
<tantra> [10769] Thus it is said.
[10770] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
<tantra> [10771] "The essence is primordially pure, free from the basis of expression;
<tantra> [10772] The nature is spontaneously present, complete in whatever appears."
<tantra> [10773] Thus it is.
