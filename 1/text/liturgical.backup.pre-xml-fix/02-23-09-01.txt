[14823] First, concerning self-appearance dawning gradually, there are seven instants.
[14824] Seven instants for resting in that very nature as self-appearance dawns, abiding in the recognition of what simply is.
[14825] Seven instants for recognizing that as self-appearance and thereby attaining certainty progressively.
[14826] Thus twenty-one instants bring liberation into primordial purity.
[14827] Before dissolving, one emanates manifestations.
[14828] These dissolve into primordial purity.
[14829] Though these twenty-one instants are equal, the days of meditative absorption vary according to faculties sharp or dull.
[14830] Those days correspond to instants.
[14831] The manner of appearance according to faculties, the enumeration of days.
[14832] And the manner of emanation differ.
[14833] From the Self-Arising Tantra.
[14834] Some liberate through white light.
[14835] Some liberate through yellow light.
[14836] Some liberate through red light.
[14837] Some liberate through green light.
[14838] Some liberate through blue light.
[14839] Some liberate through all five lights.
[14840] Some liberate through bindu radiance.
[14841] This is the manner of final liberation.
[14842] Thus it is said.
[14843] The manner of final faculty liberation is as follows.
[14844] For the final ground established, fourteen days are required.
[14845] Six days for bindus above and below.
[14846] Five for wisdom.
[14847] Three days for spontaneous presence, after which one sees one's own appearance and becomes a Buddha.
[14848] Emanations can accomplish benefit even after forty days.
[14849] The peak of the final stage requires.
[14850] Fifteen days.
[14851] Likewise for bindus and wisdom as before.
[14852] Abiding one day in spontaneous presence, one sees one's own appearance and attains stability.
[14853] Emanations can accomplish benefit even after forty-three days.
[14854] The supreme final stage requires.
[14855] Sixteen days.
[14856] Likewise for bindus and wisdom as before.
[14857] Abiding five days in spontaneous presence, one sees one's own appearance and attains stability.
[14858] Emanations can accomplish benefit from the forty-sixth day.
[14859] The transcendent final stage requires seventeen days.
[14860] Likewise for bindus and wisdom as before.
[14861] Abiding six days in spontaneous presence, one sees one's own appearance and attains stability.
[14862] Emanations can accomplish benefit even after forty-seven days.
[14863] The sublime final stage.
[14864] Requires eighteen days.
[14865] Six days for bindus.
[14866] Eight days for wisdom.
[14867] Abiding three days in spontaneous presence, one sees one's own appearance and attains stability.
[14868] Emanations can accomplish benefit even after fifty days.
[14869] The intermediate final stage.
[14870] Requires nineteen days.
[14871] Twelve days for bindus.
[14872] Four days for wisdom.
[14873] All those sentient beings with such faculties attain the stage of Buddhahood.
[14874] These intermediate states are like dreams.
[14875] The final of finals, born as spontaneous presence nature, is taught within the category of liberation here.
[14876] These are the ways faculties liberate, extremely important points to be known.
[14877] The fourth general meaning concerns the intermediate state of existence, where the momentum of karma connects like a rope yoked to a hollow cavity, like inserting a fox.
[14878] This has two aspects: a brief indication of pointing-out instruction and an extensive explanation of the intermediate state's own face.
[14879] First.
[14880] The intermediate state of existence, like the appearance in dreams, enters objects instantaneously without obstruction, with previous instants self-ceasing and dissolving, unrecognizable.
[14881] Presently having clear direct appearance with various buzzing and humming, one has miraculous powers to instantly reach whatever object is conceived.
[14882] Therefore those who have seen this door recognize the intermediate state's self-appearance.
[14883] Merely contemplating the pure lands of the ten directions' emanations, through the blessings of dharmatā's truth, one is born there and becomes a Buddha without intermediate state.
[14884] For this there are previous pointing-out instructions.
[14885] Presently focusing awareness at the eye or Brahma aperture as a sphere of light, projecting like a shooting star.
[14886] At that time, the instruction is to remember that land and project awareness spontaneously toward east and other directions.
[14887] Those beings who have not seen this door, though trained in Dharma, hold illusory bodies.
[14888] Train in emptiness without true existence.
[14889] Through contemplating pure lands, liberation is possible, as explained in individual practice texts.
[14890] Those without familiarity with Dharma make aspirations for pure lands.
[14891] Take refuge.
[14892] Turn away from inferior womb entrances.
[14893] And select the excellent.
[14894] From the Golden Rosary.
[14895] Though confusion appears as existence's aspect.
[14896] Self-appearance appears as natureless appearance.
[14897] Knowing self-appearance as natureless.
[14898] Through remembering emanations, one's own continuum is liberated.
[14899] Thus it is said.
[14900] Second, the extensive explanation has twenty topics.
[14901] The manner of circling.
[14902] Definitions.
[14903] Characteristics.
[14904] Clairvoyance.
[14905] Miraculous powers.
[14906] Lifespan.
[14907] Color.
[14908] The manner of head direction.
[14909] The difference between accumulating and not accumulating karma.
[14910] The signs of karma.
[14911] The enumerations of names.
[14912] The measure of the body.
[14913] Recognizing the birthplace.
[14914] The difference in conduct.
[14915] The measure of light.
[14916] The difference in karmic connections.
[14917] The connection between the future body and afflictions.
[14918] The difference of which realm is included.
[14919] The signs of entering the future womb.
[14920] And the indication through examples.
[14921] First, the difference in the manner of circling.
[14922] For those who have not seen this door or have seen but lack faith and practice, the intermediate state of dharmatā is brief.
[14923] Not recognizing self-appearance, they circle repeatedly in the intermediate state of existence.
[14924] Though without flesh and blood form, through habitual patterns of self-grasping in the body, appearances arise like dream bodies with complete faculties and flawless flesh forms.
[14925] Having the flesh form of previous existence.
[14926] Possessing complete faculties without obstruction.
[14927] Seen by gods and those with pure divine eyes of similar class.
[14928] Unsurpassable, these are called scent-eaters.
[14929] Thus explained with categories.
[14930] If flesh forms and faculties truly exist, having taken a body, this contradicts being in the intermediate state.
[14931] Therefore separated from the body of the arising ground's dissolution, this has the name mental existence and.
[14932] Relying on the seed aspect of the four elements, approaching entry into a body, it has the second name of illusory body.
[14933] Not having established a ground, karma moves it universally, causing circling.
[14934] Second, the definition.
[14935] It is called intermediate because it is the appearance between the ceasing of dharmatā's appearance.
[14936] And before actually taking the body of the six classes.
[14937] This is understood as the middle of those two connected together.
[14938] Existence means some are born as emanation bodies.
[14939] Some are born as gods or humans.
[14940] Some are born in lower realms.
[14941] Some call existence through liberation.
[14942] This is called intermediate existence.
[14943] Third, characteristics.
[14944] During however long the intermediate state abides, the former half retains previous characteristics.
[14945] The latter half takes on the body of wherever one will be born, with clothing and ornaments and so forth, like dream characteristics.
[14946] If born as god or human, that is the characteristic.
[14947] If born in form realm, first one has a body of light.
[14948] In formless, when rising to birth, without form, characteristics do not appear.
[14949] Yet birth occurs from the appearance of merely space and air.
[14950] When transferring from formless to lower realms, the former half is one's self-emanated absorption of merely air.
[14951] The latter half appears as the characteristic of wherever one will be born.
[14952] Titans and.
[14953] The three lower realms appear in that characteristic.
[14954] If born in uninterrupted hell, through falling and dissolution, there is no intermediate state.
[14955] Similarly, upward falling and dissolution.
[14956] Through overpowering transference, wherever the birthplace dissolves, the intermediate state is not seen.
[14957] Others make the intermediate state their path.
[14958] Fourth, clairvoyance.
[14959] The latent aspect of previous intermediate state clairvoyance exists here, and through its power, the dimensions and.
[14960] Height and.
[14961] Measure and.
[14962] Formation and dissolution and so forth of the container and contents of the previous world, and.
[14963] The characteristics of the container and contents of wherever one will be born are all instantly known like reflections appearing in a mirror.
[14964] Thus wherever one desires and aspires to be born in the future, one is born there.
[14965] Seeing the god and human realms, through attachment one is born there.
[14966] Titans and.
[14967] Animals' forests and beautiful lake islands, seeing these, one is born there.
[14968] The places of hell and hungry ghosts, seeing radiant fire light as beautiful and attractive, thinking to go there, one is born there.
[14969] In short, wherever one will be born appears beautiful and delightful.
[14970] Seeing as refuge when pursued by enemies, concealing the mind with momentary attachment, one takes birth.
[14971] Moreover, all births through desire arise from the manifestation of mind's desire and attachment.
[14972] Great yearning and longing for objects arise.
[14973] If born in form realm, one is angry at coarse appearances and longs for light.
[14974] If born in formless, without longing for any appearance whatsoever, one becomes attached to merely abiding in the mind of nothing whatsoever.
[14975] That appearance of container and contents also lasts but an instant.
[14976] Then through the power of strong habitual patterns, it ceases.
[14977] Here, from what cause does clairvoyance arise.
[14978] The seed of dharmatā exists, and here the obscuring body without flesh is absent.
[14979] And through the blessings of previously seeing dharmatā, it arises.
[14980] Fifth, miraculous powers.
[14981] With clear faculties and complete body appearance, like flying in dreams and so forth.
[14982] Traveling in space, consciousness enters wherever it is directed.
[14983] Entering even small places like keyholes and horse-ear cavities.
[14984] Entering even large things like horses, elephants, mountains, rocks, and space.
[14985] One becomes a sentient being of indefinite large and small form.
[14986] Going everywhere unimpededly through earth, water, fire, wind, mountains, rocks, and so forth.
[14987] Unharmed by the harm of the four elements.
[14988] Having the power to enter any element whatsoever.
[14989] This is the crucial point of sentient beings entering inside rocks and so forth and inside eggs.
[14990] At this time, unobstructed to anywhere except Vajra Seat and mother's womb.
[14991] Except by those of similar class and those with divine eyes, they are not seen.
[14992] But they see all the classes of sentient beings' places.
[14993] The continuum of these miraculous powers arises from the aspect of previously seeing Saṃbhogakāya's miraculous powers.
[14994] These arise for but an instant, then again cease and dissolve as other appearances arise.
[14995] When others arise, previous ones are forgotten and not seen, like not remembering previous dreams in the same dream hollow.
[14996] Sixth, lifespan.
[14997] These twenty aspects of appearance's manner of arising complete in seven days.
[14998] Because that intermediate state life ends after seven days.
[14999] Does that life not extend further.
[149100] Again through the power of habitual patterns, awakening the previous appearance, taking the mental body, one dies seven times.
[149101] Seven times one is born, appearing like the birth and death of dreams.
[149102] The seven births are miraculous birth.
[149103] All deaths and births occur instantaneously.
[149104] If virtuous power is applied, making seven periods of seven days is greatly beneficial.
[149105] That too appears as seven births abiding, seven deaths appearing, making twenty-one is.
[149106] The maximum limit of taking a body.
[149107] Seven groups of seven make forty-nine days.
[149108] Within that, through different karmas, individual bodies are taken.
[149109] Generally, the minimum intermediate state lifespan is seven days.
[149110] The maximum is forty-nine.
[149111] The medium is between those.
[149112] That too, like untimely death in the desire realm.
[149113] There too, untimely death through karma is possible.
[149114] Though it is taught that through karma's ripening, longer than that is possible, this refers to the intermediate state's power.
[149115] The cause of appearance in birth and death is.
[149116] From remembering the previous death, at the same day-night division above as when one died, this too dies.
[149117] Through remembering birth, birth occurs instantly.
[149118] Seventh, color.
[149119] It appears as the sign of the body of wherever one will be born.
[149120] If born as god or human, white.
[149121] If born as titan or animal, yellow.
[149122] If born as hungry ghost, like smoke.
[149123] If born in hell, like black wool or.
[149124] Like scattered black wool.
[149125] The continuum of this arises from previously seeing Saṃbhogakāya's colors and hand emblems.
[149126] Eighth, the difference in head direction.
[149127] If born as god or human, upward.
[149128] Titans and animals, horizontal.
[149129] Hungry ghosts and hell beings, downward.
[149130] Ninth, accumulating and not accumulating.
[149131] Coarse manifestation is not accumulated.
[149132] Subtle latent is accumulated through mental power, depending on.
[149133] This is called intermediate karma.
[149134] Moreover, through seeing dharmatā's truth, previous manifestation karma is not seen yet exists as seed.
[149135] Here, like dream time, subtle intermediate karma merely adds to the future, like.
[149136] Future karmic connection is also cause-consistent result, transferring one to another, causing circling.
[149137] The manner of accumulation is.
[149138] One appearance ceases and before another arises, it is accumulated, causing previous appearance to become unclear.
[149139] The time is between previous and subsequent consciousness.
[149140] The cause is from previous non-manifestation, subtle latent, and meditative absorption aspect.
[149141] Here accumulation arises from confusion and amazement regarding dharmatā above.
[149142] Tenth, the signs of karma.
[149143] At that time when appearance of pure karmic seed is seen, through the previous dharmatā it becomes extremely clear and examined.
[149144] Through previous impure seed, consciousness is unclear and dull.
[149145] Clear or unclear consciousness arises from previous virtue or non-virtue.
[149146] The cause is twofold: clear from previous subsequent remembrance of purity.
[149147] Unclear from turning the back toward dharmatā.
[149148] Previously designating the aspect of seeing gods as subsequent remembrance, not seeing characteristic subsequent remembrance, here is confusion.
[149149] Eleventh, enumerations of names.
[149150] Having the nature of four names gathered from the four elements' seed aspect.
[149151] Earth's function gathered is one, having the nature of existence flesh form.
[149152] Water's function causes the seed to become an illusory-like body.
[149153] At this time eating as scent-eaters and circling near previous karma is two, making scent-eater near-circler, the second name of intermediate existence with five aggregates connecting.
[149154] Fire's function causes the seed to become merely mental existence form.
[149155] Though without flesh and blood, existing in the seed aspect, ripening in that form, possessing complete faculties and limbs is.
[149156] Possessing complete faculties without obstruction is three.
[149157] Wind's function causes the seed to be lifted without obstruction by karmic wind, seeing all with desire to enter, unobstructed or.
[149158] Called entering existence is four.
[149159] From what cause do these arise.
[149160] They arise from the power of the four wisdoms' connection above.
[149161] Twelfth, the measure of the body.
[149162] For those with impure karma, like a child of eight years.
[149163] For the pure, the body measure of one sixteen years old, though not truly existing as illusory dream form.
[149164] The cause arises from seeing spontaneous presence's eightfold manner of arising.
[149165] Thirteenth, included in which birthplace.
[149166] Womb birth.
[149167] Egg birth.
[149168] Warmth-moisture birth.
[149169] Miraculous birth, among these.
[149170] Belongs to miraculous birth.
[149171] Whatever is appropriate, having miraculous powers and light, similar to gods.
[149172] Every seven days experiencing birth and death suffering, similar to hell beings.
[149173] Hell beings and gods and.
[149174] Intermediate existence of existence is miraculously born.
[149175] Thus it is said.
[149176] The cause arises from previously seeing emanation aspects.
[149177] Fourteenth, conduct.
[149178] Through the power of dharmatā truth's force dissolving, previous habitual patterns of attachment arise, doing as before, here too is conduct.
[149179] The cause arises from confusion and amazement regarding self-appearance at the time of dharmatā.
[149180] Fifteenth, light.
[149181] For those with pure karma born in higher states, white light shines one league.
[149182] For impure born in lower realms, merely yellow and black dark self-clarity.
[149183] The cause of these arises from dharmatā's self-light.
[149184] Sixteenth, karmic connection.
[149185] If born in excellent states with Dharma in the future, here one meets virtuous aspects.
[149186] If born with wealth.
[149187] Retinue and enjoyments in the future, here one meets desirable aspects.
[149188] If born with incomplete faculties and negative.
[149189] In lower realms and so forth.
[149190] Undesirable and.
[149191] Poverty and so forth aspects are met.
[149192] The cause arises from holding attachment or aversion toward dharmatā.
[149193] Seventeenth, connection between body and afflictions.
[149194] Though form is without flesh, within the dream-like cavity, if attachment to one's form arises, desire and.
[149195] If anger arises, form and.
[149196] If intermediate arises, born in formless.
[149197] The cause of these arises from deviating from dharmatā truth.
[149198] Eighteenth, included in which realm.
[149199] Desire.
[149200] Form.
[149201] Formless, among these three.
[149202] Though the four-name aggregates exist as illusory mental body.
[149203] Not having taken the future aggregates, form is without flesh, therefore.
[149204] Other than form, feeling.
[149205] Perception.
[149206] Formation.
[149207] Consciousness abiding as latent aggregates, this belongs to the formless realm.
[149208] The cause of formlessness arises from previously seeing dharmatā as illusory-like.
[149209] Nineteenth, signs of entering the future womb.
[149210] After completing one or two to seven weeks of experiencing intermediate existence, when first entering future existence.
[149211] If entering divine birthplace, at this time consciousness sees abiding inside a divine mansion's upper story or jewel house.
[149212] If entering titan womb.
[149213] Abiding inside a fire-wheel or.
[149214] In the center of falling rain, this comes.
[149215] If entering human womb, feeling extremely cold is merely human body.
[149216] If feeling abiding in a dark center, pure human body.
[149217] Abiding in the noise of gathered people, body of precious jewels.
[149218] If entering animal womb, abiding inside the head or cave or termite mound.
[149219] If entering hungry ghost womb, abiding pressing ant holes.
[149220] Hell beings directly abide in the intermediate state of existence through succession.
[149221] After these arise and womb is entered.
[149222] Though wishing to go, with obstruction, one is powerless.
[149223] The cause arises from lack of faith in dharmatā truth above.
[149224] Twentieth, examples.
[149225] Like grass holding fire, through karma and habitual patterns' power, holding womb abode and.
[149226] Like mud holding life forms or jewels or trees and so forth, in circling, self-knowing wisdom holds and.
[149227] Like bird flock holding birds, the remains of parents' union hold intermediate sentient beings.
[149228] Like bees gathering on summer decaying flesh.
[149229] Countless intermediates pour into the womb door of parents' union.
[149230] Merely experiencing the taste of parents' bliss, the karma to be born there, without self-power, womb develops and thickens, entering mother's birth path.
[149231] From those, through sun-moon conjunction.
[149232] This scripture is inconsistent.
[149233] Sentient beings' entry.
[149234] Called intermediate existence of existence.
[149235] The path-head of circling's place.
[149236] Like a water wheel, circling.
[149237] Separated from flesh and blood body.
[149238] Having illusory mental form.
[149239] Second name separated from dissolution.
[149240] Previous consciousness's appearance ceased.
[149241] Future not yet arisen.
[149242] Class uncertain anywhere.
[149243] Whatever ceases, whatever appears, at that time.
[149244] The intermediate state abiding for an instant.
[149245] Later assuming the characteristics of whatever will be born.
[149246] Having completely assumed the characteristics of what will arise.
[149247] Becomes the appearance aspect of individual six classes.
[149248] The container of the desire realm and.
[149249] Contents are self-known and clear.
[149250] Oneself, wherever will be born's container and contents.
[149251] At that very time is clear.
[149252] Those with desire see container and contents clearly.
[149253] With complete faculties and limbs.
[149254] Unobstructed to all things.
[149255] Entering unobstructed through mountains, rocks, and so forth.
[149256] For others, lifespan becomes seven days.
[149257] Seven groups of seven days.
[149258] That is the measure of that life.
[149259] Gods and humans are white color.
[149260] Titans and animals yellow.
[149261] Hungry ghost light like smoke.
[149262] Hell beings like stumps or.
[149263] Like scattered black wool.
[149264] Animals also like bloody pus.
[149265] Titans like falling rain.
[149266] At that time, head direction is as follows.
[149267] Gods and humans look upward.
[149268] Titans and animals horizontal.
[149269] Hungry ghosts and hell beings look downward.
[149270] These are due to birth power.
[149271] Intermediate existence karma of existence.
[149272] Accumulating and not accumulating, these signs.
[149273] Without ripening habitual patterns.
[149274] Through intermediate power, cause-consistent.
[149275] Habitual patterns are accumulated by this.
[149276] At that time, these are consciousness signs.
[149277] Whatever karma is pure.
[149278] That consciousness itself is clear.
[149279] Those impure are unclear.
[149280] All arise from virtue and non-virtue.
[149281] That itself, enumerations of names.
[149282] These should all be known.
[149283] Having the nature of four gathered names.
[149284] Existence's flesh form and.
[149285] Illusory body scent-eater near-circler.
[149286] Intermediate existence of existence aggregates connecting.
[149287] Formless with complete faculties.
[149288] Entering all without obstruction.
[149289] Thus the intermediate body's measure.
[149290] Child of eight years or.
[149291] Ten years body measure.
[149292] Abiding as illusory dream form.
[149293] Birthplace itself among four.
[149294] Miraculously born.
[149295] Gods and hell beings intermediate state.
[149296] All these arise miraculously.
[149297] Conduct itself is as follows.
[149298] Previous attachment spreads to karma.
[149299] Following that.
[149300] That conduct follows the mind.
[149301] That itself, the measures of light.
[149302] Previous attachment coarse arising.
[149303] This light one league.
[149304] Color white clear and bright.
[149305] This is god and human birthplace.
[149306] For those with habitual patterns, clarity not seen.
[149307] Whatever karma is good or bad.
[149308] Good virtue and pleasure meet.
[149309] Negative sentient beings with habitual patterns.
[149310] Undesirable enter the womb.
[149311] Connection with future body.
[149312] Spontaneous anger arising cause.
[149313] Similarly desire conditions.
[149314] Future appearance manner.
[149315] Realms among three.
[149316] Four-name aggregates not ceased.
[149317] Future not taken, not established.
[149318] From four-name gathered aggregates.
