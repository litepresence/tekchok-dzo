[7099] First, the time and signs for empowerment with elaboration:
[7100] From showing the crucial point of timing for sequentially entering Empowerment,
[7101] The Empowerment with elaboration:
<verse> [7102] Rat, dragon, horse, and pig—
<verse> [7103] Especially in these four years,
<verse> [7104] The Empowerment ritual is accomplished.
<verse> [7105] In the four first months,
<verse> [7106] Accomplished for producing complete result at the complete time.
<verse> [7107] From the first day of the waxing moon,
<verse> [7108] Until the time of the full moon.
<verse> [7109] The time for conferral is midday or midnight.
<verse> [7110] According to the particular body of the yogi,
<verse> [7111] Apply to the individual element-year;
<verse> [7112] The Empowerment ritual becomes auspicious.
<verse> [7113] At this time, the student possessing Samaya,
<verse> [7114] Bodies of harmonious elements—
<verse> [7115] Number without measure,
<verse> [7116] One hundred, fifty, and so forth,
<verse> [7117] If harmonious with elements, without contradiction.
<verse> [7118] If entering the ritual,
<verse> [7119] Without possessing the lamp flame,
<verse> [7120] Perform the ritual of repairing Samaya;
<verse> [7121] Without defilement, siddhi—
<verse> [7122] Should be taken again and again.
<verse> [7123] Death without meaning, obstacles arise;
<verse> [7124] At complete Empowerment, forcefully exert the recitation.
<verse> [7125] At that time, among gathered relatives,
<verse> [7126] If disease arises in the body,
<verse> [7127] Perform prostration and circumambulation;
<verse> [7128] If chaos arises in speech to anyone,
<verse> [7129] Contemplate and recite the hundred syllables;
<verse> [7130] If mind is hungry or memory fades,
[7131] Enter the generation and completion stages.
<verse> [7132] If signs of improvement arise,
<verse> [7133] From the beginning, exert the Empowerment ritual.
<verse> [7134] If the substance of accomplishment increases,
<verse> [7135] Having obtained supreme siddhi,
<verse> [7136] Become faithful to the meaning of equality.
<verse> [7137] Having entered the Empowerments,
<verse> [7138] If good signs are always seen,
<verse> [7139] Common siddhi is accomplished thereby.
<verse> [7140] Even possessing experience and knowledge,
<verse> [7141] Through this also, engage in bliss and happiness.
<verse> [7142] To the Guru supreme,
<verse> [7143] Whoever is born with good faith,
<verse> [7144] Through this also, apply to the supreme mudrā.
<verse> [7145] If self sees body and speech blissful,
[7146] This is the pure Buddha field.
<verse> [7147] Thus the time of Empowerment with elaboration
<verse> [7148] And signs are well explained.
<verse> [7149] Thus it is spoken.
[7150] Second, the time and signs of empowerment without elaboration:
<verse> [7151] Also from that source:
<verse> [7152] Now, without elaboration,
<verse> [7153] Time and signs should be clearly shown.
<verse> [7154] In this, there is no distinction of year;
<verse> [7155] Whoever knows.
<verse> [7156] In this time, summer and winter are good;
<verse> [7157] Date on the waxing fortnight;
<verse> [7158] Empowerment time at dawn when sounds become clear.
<verse> [7159] In this, five or six faithful ones,
<verse> [7160] If more than seven, purpose is not accomplished.
<verse> [7161] Thus, son possessing faith,
<verse> [7162] To mind-deed virtuous,
<verse> [7163] To speech possessing Guru's praise,
<verse> [7164] At the time of Empowerment for such,
<verse> [7165] If body is not blissful,
<verse> [7166] Make confession of bodily sins afterwards;
<verse> [7167] Thus for speech and mind also,
<verse> [7168] Begin the deed of sin confession.
<verse> [7169] The time and signs
<verse> [7170] Of empowerment without elaboration are thus explained.
<verse> [7171] Thus it is spoken.
[7172] Third, the time and signs of empowerment extremely without elaboration also:
<verse> [7173] From that source:
<verse> [7174] Now, extremely without elaboration,
<verse> [7175] The supreme secret Empowerment,
<verse> [7176] Its time and signs should be explained.
<verse> [7177] That also, not a distinction of year;
<verse> [7178] Accomplished by doing what is self-suitable.
<verse> [7179] Outer time, the time of seed entering,
<verse> [7180] For supporting the seed of awakening,
<verse> [7181] If empowered at this time,
<verse> [7182] Explained as increasing the self-arisen seed.
<verse> [7183] At the time of gathering grain and fruit,
<verse> [7184] If the extremely without elaboration empowerment,
<verse> [7185] For completing the fruit of wisdom,
<verse> [7186] Definitely go to the ground of the Three Kayas.
<verse> [7187] Inner time at the waxing moon's increase,
<verse> [7188] Avoiding the waning of date-numbers,
<verse> [7189] For stabilizing experience,
<verse> [7190] Experience and blessing increase upward.
<verse> [7191] Empowerment time at the risen sun-tip,
<verse> [7192] For the purpose of self-arisen wisdom arising.
<verse> [7193] Or at the exhaustion junction of the waning,
<verse> [7194] Do the meaning of exhausting conceptions.
<verse> [7195] One or two fortunate ones,
<verse> [7196] If more than three, purpose is not accomplished.
<verse> [7197] At this time, holding individual directions:
<verse> [7198] At the time of body, in the sky,
<verse> [7199] Clouds, mist, rain,
<verse> [7200] And sounds of wind and so forth;
<verse> [7201] Harsh lands, enemies, thieves,
<verse> [7202] If unpleasant forms arise,
<verse> [7203] Great sins of body;
<verse> [7204] Having made empowerment afterwards,
<verse> [7205] Without Guru's instruction shown,
<verse> [7206] To the Sugata's form,
<verse> [7207] Or to one's own Guru's dwelling,
<verse> [7208] Six hundred thousand circumambulations,
<verse> [7209] Or one hundred thousand prostrations should be done.
<verse> [7210] At that time, the particular sign:
<verse> [7211] Beginning present, end and middle,
<verse> [7212] From definite sign-forms,
<verse> [7213] Body's conduct is purified,
<verse> [7214] Afterwards exertion is not needed.
<verse> [7215] If the end arises,
<verse> [7216] Body's completion is not finished;
<verse> [7217] Afterwards begin conduct again,
<verse> [7218] Even again if sins not purified,
<verse> [7219] Meditate one thousand deity forms.
<verse> [7220] Then the Guru's instruction
<verse> [7221] Should be trained in stages.
<verse> [7222] At the time of speech also thus,
<verse> [7223] The yogi possessing should know.
<verse> [7224] If arising in the middle without beginning or end,
<verse> [7225] One hundred thousand hundred syllables,
<verse> [7226] Should be recited with effort.
<verse> [7227] If arising at the end,
[7228] The secret mantra tantra one's age number,
<verse> [7229] One hundred and eight should be recited.
<verse> [7230] At times without beginning, end, or middle,
<verse> [7231] Reading tantra and reciting mantra,
<verse> [7232] And various praises of Guru and yidam deities,
<verse> [7233] Sounds of A-li KA-li letters,
<verse> [7234] Individually recited separately,
<verse> [7235] And hūṃ, phaṭ, and oṃ,
[7236] Various connected recitations,
<verse> [7237] For seven months should be exerted.
<verse> [7238] Then the instruction place should be done.
<verse> [7239] Yidam deity's samādhi,
<verse> [7240] For three days should be meditated.
<verse> [7241] If arising in the middle,
<verse> [7242] From mantra's light rays emanating and gathering,
<verse> [7243] For seven days should be exerted.
<verse> [7244] If arising at the end, letter's
<verse> [7245] Emanating and gathering should be meditated,
<verse> [7246] For ten days should be exerted.
<verse> [7247] If arising at beginning, middle, and end,
<verse> [7248] Completion stage meditation,
<verse> [7249] Or meditation arising from speech,
<verse> [7250] For six months should be exerted.
<verse> [7251] If also body, speech, and mind's
<verse> [7252] Conduct at individual times,
<verse> [7253] Sky pure blue without clouds,
<verse> [7254] Without wind and hail sounds,
<verse> [7255] Gentle and soft arising,
<verse> [7256] Sins need not be purified.
<verse> [7257] If present at the beginning,
<verse> [7258] And also purified at each end,
<verse> [7259] Through this sins are purified,
<verse> [7260] Confession ritual need not be done.
<verse> [7261] Thus body, speech, and mind's
<verse> [7262] Individual recognition should be examined by the wise;
<verse> [7263] Through that, extremely without elaboration,
<verse> [7264] Empowerment's time and also
<verse> [7265] Examination of signs is explained.
<verse> [7266] Briefly, signs of obtaining empowerment:
<verse> [7267] At the time of scattering the wisdom flower,
<verse> [7268] Body shakes and forcefully jumps;
<verse> [7269] If arising in body, obtained by body.
<verse> [7270] Speech various sounds and voices,
<verse> [7271] Emitting and speaking dharmas,
<verse> [7272] And speaking wondrous words—
<verse> [7273] Thus also obtained by speech.
<verse> [7274] Mind samādhi descending,
<verse> [7275] Distracted and memory lost—
<verse> [7276] By mind empowerment is obtained.
<verse> [7277] If obtained by body,
<verse> [7278] Nirmāṇakāya is obtained thereby.
<verse> [7279] Thus for speech, Saṃbhogakāya;
<verse> [7280] Mind goes to Dharmakāya's field.
<verse> [7281] Extremely without elaboration time and signs explained.
<verse> [7282] Thus it is spoken.
[7283] Fourth, the time and signs of completely without elaboration also:
<verse> [7284] From that source:
<verse> [7285] Completely without elaboration,
<verse> [7286] Time and signs should be definitely shown.
<verse> [7287] Outer time, fruit ripening,
<verse> [7288] Or time of gathering grains,
<verse> [7289] Entrusted for liberating as fruit self-appearance.
<verse> [7290] Inner time, the first day of waxing moon,
<verse> [7291] Or entrusted to the exhaustion junction,
<verse> [7292] Having realized the single bindu,
<verse> [7293] For exhausting actions and latencies.
<verse> [7294] Even if more than one fortunate one,
<verse> [7295] By the yogi purpose is not accomplished.
<verse> [7296] Son pleasing to the faithful mind,
<verse> [7297] Having fortune, empower to one.
<verse> [7298] Both to perfect Buddha,
<verse> [7299] Will definitely become without doubt.
<verse> [7300] Empowerment time at risen sun-tip,
<verse> [7301] Through individual words definitely clear,
<verse> [7302] Seeing the pure nature ground.
<verse> [7303] Whatever sign arises here,
<verse> [7304] No ritual of purifying sins.
<verse> [7305] For directly purifying above,
<verse> [7306] If cloudless clear sky,
<verse> [7307] Move in Dharmakāya's field.
<verse> [7308] If various light rays shine,
<verse> [7309] This is in Saṃbhogakāya's field.
<verse> [7310] If various sounds resound,
<verse> [7311] Nirmāṇakāya's field, breathe out.
<verse> [7312] If possessing fortune,
[7313] At this time, skilled in body key points,
<verse> [7314] And unmoving from that,
<verse> [7315] In seven years reaches exhaustion ground.
<verse> [7316] If speech's expression is lost,
<verse> [7317] This one in twenty-one months,
<verse> [7318] Reaches the ground of nature's exhaustion.
<verse> [7319] If skilled in mind and winds empty,
<verse> [7320] In seven months this fortunate one,
<verse> [7321] All appearances become exhausted.
<verse> [7322] If to supreme intelligence,
<verse> [7323] Beginning with elaboration,
<verse> [7324] Without interruption gradually,
<verse> [7325] The manner of completing empowerments—
<verse> [7326] To those who become supreme,
<verse> [7327] This is extremely rare,
<verse> [7328] Days and months and years,
<verse> [7329] Matching with one's own experience,
<verse> [7330] Complete the four empowerments.
<verse> [7331] If four empowerments not complete,
<verse> [7332] The extremely without elaboration empowerment,
<verse> [7333] The deep portion's realized object,
<verse> [7334] Through conferring this, empowerment is obtained.
<verse> [7335] Having well examined student's characteristics,
<verse> [7336] Two and three and so forth,
<verse> [7337] Match with student's prosperity measure;
<verse> [7338] Through one's own experience at the end,
<verse> [7339] At special time, supreme is explained.
<verse> [7340] For entering power into the son.
<verse> [7341] Thus it is spoken.
[7342] Fifth, the procedure for performing the feast offering:
<verse> [7343] From the Magical Display:
<verse> [7344] Great compassion, great feast offering.
<verse> [7345] Thus it is spoken.
<verse> [7346] And from the Empowerment King Tantra:
<verse> [7347] To the Guru ripened by empowerment,
<verse> [7348] Supreme offering of gold and silver,
<verse> [7349] One's own body equally offered,
<verse> [7350] Buddha result easily,
<verse> [7351] Having breathed out from saṃsāra,
<verse> [7352] Definitely obtained without doubt.
<verse> [7353] Thus it is spoken.
<verse> [7354] And from the Jeweled Empowerment Tantra:
<verse> [7355] Result easy and effortless,
<verse> [7356] Mind-generation, awakening completed,
<verse> [7357] For fulfilling needs and desires, Guru—
<verse> [7358] Like the wish-fulfilling cow.
<verse> [7359] Thus it is spoken.
[7360] And after empowerment, through making offerings and feast celebration,
[7361] Here also one obtains the perfection of one's desired purpose,
[7362] And in future time obtains perfect power, glory, and good qualities,
[7363] And afterwards manifests and awakens in ornamentally arrayed Buddha fields.
<verse> [7364] Thus also from the Vast Empowerment:
<verse> [7365] Desired purposes are perfected,
<verse> [7366] Glory, fame, wisdom,
<verse> [7367] Power and goodness bestowed,
<verse> [7368] Buddha fields well-arrayed,
<verse> [7369] Manifestly perfected awakening.
<verse> [7370] Thus it is spoken.
[7371] And at other times, gathering immeasurable accumulations,
[7372] At this time gathered increases a hundred thousand-fold.
[7373] Through its power, all purposes of thought are accomplished here,
[7374] And food, wealth, and so forth, special gathering definitely accomplished without difficulty.
[7375] From completing the two accumulations, the two kayas are accomplished.
<verse> [7376] From the Jeweled Empowerment Array:
<verse> [7377] The fortunate one who relies on empowerment,
<verse> [7378] Completing the two accumulations, the result,
<verse> [7379] Definitely obtains the meaning of the supreme two.
<verse> [7380] Thus it is spoken.
[7381] At this time, having offered various foods, drink, wealth, and so forth to the root Guru,
[7382] The merit of offering hundreds at other times and offering here—this offering here has greater merit.
[7383] At this time, giving to one woman and giving to one man—the merit of these two,
[7384] And elsewhere making great feast offering to a hundred thousand ḍākinīs—the merit of these two,
[7385] The one given at this time is superior.
[7386] And at this time, for the Guru, all Buddhas of the ten directions gathered with one-pointed compassion,
[7387] Performing the activity of empowerment, turning the supreme wheel, and entering the great liberation city—
[4387] thus grace is superior.
[7388] And for women and men also, with heroes and heroines and supports arranged in empowerment rows,
[7389] Abiding with compassion and Samaya, blessing is bestowed,
[7390] Therefore the two times—empowerment time and feast celebration time—are shown to increase a hundred thousand-fold more than others.
<verse> [7391] Thus also:
<verse> [7392] From the Essence of Empowerment Classifications:
<verse> [7393] Through great feast offering worship,
<verse> [7394] To Guru and Guru's retinue,
<verse> [7395] To all including the mother,
<verse> [7396] Whoever makes feast offering,
<verse> [7397] Even if pleasing all Buddhas
<verse> [4397] For immeasurable hundred thousand aeons,
<verse> [4398] Cannot equal this merit.
<verse> [7399] If touching the Guru's body pores
<verse> [7400] With sandalwood,
<verse> [7401] Here merit is limitless.
<verse> [7402] Thus one's own vajra siblings,
<verse> [7403] One, two, and three,
<verse> [7404] Or countless hundreds and thousands,
<verse> [7405] Whoever makes feast gathering,
<verse> [7406] If at non-empowerment time,
<verse> [7407] Worshipping one's own Guru,
<verse> [7408] Having done countless hundreds,
<verse> [7409] The merit of one done here
<verse> [7410] Cannot be measured by mind.
<verse> [7411] Through great food and drink feast,
<verse> [7412] If yogis are pleased,
<verse> [7413] All goodness is accomplished,
<verse> [7414] And liberated from faults.
<verse> [7415] If vajra sister,
<verse> [7416] Or Guru's student,
<verse> [7417] To the assembly of ḍākinīs,
<verse> [7418] If pleased with feast gathering,
<verse> [7419] To the eight mamos or Vārāhī,
<verse> [7420] Nine hundred feast offerings
<verse> [7421] Done at improper time,
<verse> [7422] At this time to one ḍākinī,
<verse> [7423] Food or drink,
<verse> [7424] Or if giving even a little water,
<verse> [7425] This merit is not equal.
<verse> [7426] Therefore to the ḍākinī city,
<verse> [7427] Go and please the ḍākinīs.
<verse> [7428] Father and mother yogis,
<verse> [7429] Equal and mixed, having worshipped,
<verse> [7430] Here such siddhi,
<verse> [7431] Arises possessing supreme wonder.
<verse> [7432] For desired purpose in this world,
<verse> [7433] And for future wisdom field conduct,
<verse> [7434] Sky-going siddhi,
<verse> [7435] Whoever does various lords,
<verse> [7436] With retinue in space,
<verse> [7437] Able to move as conduct.
<verse> [7438] Thus it is spoken.
[7439] And if the feast celebration is done extensively,
[7440] In this very life siddhi of any kind is obtained, for it is the time of special gathering.
[7441] Explanation of the signs of siddhi:
<verse> [7442] From that source:
<verse> [7443] From previously done feast offering,
<verse> [7444] Eight types of siddhi causes,
<verse> [7445] Yoginīs are explained to obtain.
<verse> [7446] And what are they:
<verse> [7447] Glory, fame, prosperity,
<verse> [7448] Gathering, siblings, obtaining,
<verse> [7449] Worldly empowerment, Buddha accomplishment.
<verse> [7450] Glory is retinue increase,
<verse> [7451] And possessing sons and power.
<verse> [7452] Fame is loving sentient beings,
<verse> [7453] Seeing brings joy and service,
<verse> [7454] Praise and speak pleasant words.
<verse> [7455] Prosperity is wealth and food,
<verse> [7456] And grain and desired purpose accomplished,
<verse> [7457] Fruits and crops ripen and expand,
<verse> [7458] Used without being exhausted.
<verse> [7459] Gathering has four types:
<verse> [7460] Humans, non-humans,
<verse> [7461] Wealth and food gathering.
<verse> [7462] Humans are birth-gatherings, women—
<verse> [7463] First gathering from that,

<verse> [7466] And listening to Dharma.

<verse> [7489] Whatever exists in this land,
<verse> [7490] Pleasant and supreme-tasted,
<verse> [7491] Many gathering first,

<verse> [7493] Fruits with essence,
<verse> [7494] Various medicinal preparations,
<verse> [7495] Wondrous foods,
<verse> [7496] Gather to the fortunate one.
<verse> [7497] Whatever types of wealth desired,
<verse> [7498] By mere thought gathering.
<verse> [7499] Clothes, bedding, seats, and so forth,
<verse> [7500] Whatever thought in one's mind,
<verse> [7501] Accomplished for the fortunate one.
<verse> [7502] Wheel-turning king's merit,
<verse> [7503] Obtaining fame without harm.
<verse> [7504] Obtaining siddhi, swift feet,
<verse> [7505] Earth-going and sky-going,
<verse> [7506] Eye-medicine, power over life,

<verse> [7510] Dharma and prosperity perfected.
<verse> [7511] Possessing merit and completing accumulations,
<verse> [7512] Having died, obtains higher realms.

<verse> [7523] Definitely obtaining worldly empowerment,
<verse> [7524] Here is vidyādhara siddhi:
<verse> [7525] Transforming harm to benefit,
<verse> [7526] And empowering others' powers,
<verse> [7527] Able to transform fire to water,
<verse> [7528] Thus water also to fire,
<verse> [7529] Earth and wind also thus.
<verse> [7530] Transforming men and women,
<verse> [7531] Humans and animals and so forth,
<verse> [7532] Individual reflections transforming,

<verse> [7537] Expelling and separating activities accomplished.
<verse> [7538] Thus it is spoken.
[7539] These are established as previously accomplished definite lineages.
<verse> [7540] From that source:
<verse> [7541] If this history is explained,
<verse> [7542] Formerly in central India's Odma Grove,
<verse> [7543] Lord of Gatherings Black Feet,
<verse> [7544] The completely without elaboration empowerment,
<verse> [7545] Especially conferred by me,
<verse> [7546] Six hundred thousand loads of grain,
<verse> [7547] And eating and chewing and tasting,
<verse> [7548] And drinking gathering having done,
<verse> [7549] Five hundred yogis and yoginīs,
<verse> [7550] Great feast celebration done.
<verse> [7551] At that time, one yoginī
<verse> [7552] Said this to that Lord of Gatherings:
<verse> [7553] E ma, one son, fortunate one,
<verse> [7554] Through this feast gathering pleasing,
<verse> [7555] Siddhi will definitely be accomplished for you;
<verse> [7556] I too obtained gathering siddhi.
<verse> [7557] Having spoken, went to the sky.
<verse> [7558] Then at that very time,
<verse> [7559] One hundred thousand elephant riders,
<verse> [7560] With mamos' retinue,
<verse> [7561] Went to the east in the sky.
<verse> [7562] Then after three days passed,

<verse> [7564] Retinue and cattle, dogs, and so forth,
<verse> [7565] Feet not touching the ground a cubit,
<verse> [7566] Going thus.
<verse> [7567] Then that Lord of Gatherings',
<verse> [7568] All substance and prosperity,
<verse> [7569] Again requested empowerment,
<verse> [7570] Having done one feast gathering,
<verse> [7571] By merely doing that,
<verse> [7572] With retinue in the sky,
<verse> [7573] With sound went away.
<verse> [7574] Now in the eastern direction of Jambudvīpa,

<verse> [7576] In the sky, ḍākinīs
<verse> [7577] Seven hundred thousand with retinue,
<verse> [7578] Accomplishing activities of yogis
<verse> [7579] Perfected in gathering prosperity.
<verse> [7580] Thus wondrous siddhi,

<verse> [7582] Therefore with joy sing songs,
<verse> [7583] And also with joy dance,
<verse> [7584] Various blissful conduct do,
<verse> [7585] Thus doing, feast is accomplished.
<verse> [7586] Thus it is spoken.
[7587] And through how much empowerment and its feast celebration are those eight siddhis accomplished:
<verse> [7588] Here showing its number:
<verse> [7589] Also from that source:
<verse> [7590] Thus the fortunate one,
<verse> [7591] Empowerment one's age number,
<verse> [7592] Or one hundred eight or thousand and so forth,
<verse> [7593] Buddha result will be accomplished.
<verse> [7594] Dharma, prosperity, Nirmāṇakāya,
<verse> [7595] Simultaneously obtained definitely.
<verse> [7596] Those obtained arise from empowerment.
<verse> [7597] Through twenty-one empowerments with fame,

<verse> [7599] Glory is well accomplished by thirty.
<verse> [7600] Prosperities by forty.
<verse> [7601] Obtaining one hundred eight.
<verse> [7602] Siblings by one hundred twenty-one.
<verse> [7603] World-transforming by two hundred.
<verse> [7604] Buddhas by thousand accomplished.
<verse> [7605] Therefore in empowerment ritual,
<verse> [7606] Without feast, purpose not accomplished.
<verse> [7607] If great feast celebration done well,
<verse> [7608] By yogi purpose well accomplished.
<verse> [7609] Thus it is spoken.
[7610] Thus through feast celebration goodness is accomplished.
<verse> [7611] Also from the Great Array:
<verse> [7612] Having obtained empowerment from the Guru,
<verse> [7613] Various foods,
<verse> [7614] Processed cloth and medicinal scents,

<verse> [7632] Prosperity possessed and accumulations completed,
<verse> [7633] Perfect Buddha's qualities obtained.
<verse> [7634] Thus it is spoken.
[7635] Second topic: the actual path of empowerment has three parts:
[7636] Where to confer: the arrangement of the maṇḍala;
[7637] How to confer: the nature of empowerment;
[7638] Thus conferred: the classification of empowerment.
[7639] First has three parts:
[7640] Essence is the definite principal and retinue of self-arisen wisdom including path and result.
[7641] Etymology: from the Sanskrit word maṇḍala,
[7642] In Tibetan, maṇḍala; whatever phenomenon with retinue beautifully surrounding the principal is called maṇḍala.
[7643] Classification is three:
[7644] Ground spontaneously present root maṇḍala;
[7645] Path reflection method maṇḍala;
[7646] Result completely pure nature maṇḍala.
<verse> [7647] Thus also:
<verse> [7648] From Self-Arisen:
<verse> [7649] Maṇḍala is held to be three types:
<verse> [7650] Nature maṇḍala great,
<verse> [7651] Root maṇḍala great,
<verse> [7652] Reflection maṇḍala three shown.
<verse> [7653] Thus it is spoken.
[7654] First is:
[7655] Self-arisen wisdom abiding in all beings,
[7656] Light maṇḍala three abiding.
<verse> [7657] From that source:
<verse> [7658] Great root maṇḍala is:
<verse> [7659] Each abiding in each heart center,
<verse> [7660] And this maṇḍala thus:
<verse> [7661] Self-arisen awareness is the center,
<verse> [7662] Five lights' appearance is the retinue.
<verse> [7663] Great root maṇḍala one,
<verse> [7664] In each white conch shell,
<verse> [7665] Pure bindu is the center,
<verse> [7666] Light-threads with rays is the retinue manner.
<verse> [7667] Great root maṇḍala two,
<verse> [7668] In pure empty expanse center,
<verse> [7669] Vajra body of channels,
<verse> [7670] Space lamp is the retinue.
<verse> [7671] Great root maṇḍala three,
<verse> [7672] And so forth maṇḍalas,
<verse> [7673] Body's maṇḍala changeless expanse,

<verse> [7675] Mind's maṇḍala unthought certainty.
<verse> [7676] Body, speech, and mind's maṇḍalas,

[7683] Second is:
[7684] The symbolic maṇḍala of drawn symbols of empowerment indication,
[7685] Thread and heap maṇḍalas, relying on symbolic maṇḍala,
[7686] Generation and completion meditation with support object,
[7687] Samādhi maṇḍala path's qualities arising basis becomes meaning maṇḍala.
[7688] Showing definite symbolic meaning maṇḍala:
<verse> [7689] Also from that source:

<verse> [7691] When doing supreme empowerment,
<verse> [7692] Maṇḍala is spoken as two types:
