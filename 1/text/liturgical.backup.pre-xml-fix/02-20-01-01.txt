[8083] Samsara cycles namelessly in delusion; yet the distinctive excellence of this life-force bringing liberation through light is exceptional.
[8084] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [8085] Since this reveals the natural realm,
<tantra> [8086] Without entering the circle of conditions,
<tantra> [8087] As primordial purity and spontaneous presence,
<tantra> [8088] From the sphere of objects and consciousness,
<tantra> [8089] Liberated at the very basis of each distinct essence.
[8090] Thus it is said.
[8091] Yet if one asks what difference exists between liberation through Trekchö and not reaching the full measure of appearance while being liberated from the aggregates,
[8092] there is a vast distinction.
[8093] Through Trekchö one is liberated, yet from atomic particles without remainder,
[8094] transformation into light is impossible.
[8095] Without going into light, the vajra body is not established;
[8096] through the temporary illusory body, the final result is not traversed.
[8097] Without obtaining the body of light, the great transference body is not attained,
[8098] and therefore the great benefit for others through that support is not accomplished.
[8099] Thus from the aspect of entering light and atomic particles,
[8100] the great transference cannot perform benefit, while the eye of wisdom and clairvoyance,
[8101] the accomplishment of miraculous powers—there exists distinction of magnitude.
[8102] Second:
[8103] Although rigpa is spoken of as luminosity from the beginning, through Trekchö's estimation of emptiness, its own light is not seen.
[8104] Through Thögal's application of crucial points, when dharmatā's essence-luminosity is internally captured,
[8105] the individual's own-resonance luminosity appears externally as practical display—this is superior.
[8106] From the Rangshar:
<verse> [8107] This King of Rigpa, self-appearance,
<verse> [8108] Exists in all yet is unrecognized.
[8109] Thus it is said.
[8110] Third:
[8111] The pristine wisdom of rigpa not seen in Trekchö, covered by expansion, determined as only one without seeing—
[8112] in Thögal, through the opening of pristine wisdom's vision, dharmatā's sun-rays appearing clear:
[8113] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [8114] Through dharmatā's direct appearance,
<tantra> [8115] The view of intellectual grasping is consumed.
[8116] Thus it is said.
[8117] Fourth:
[8118] In Trekchö, relying upon coarse nāḍī and prāṇa,
[8119] in Thögal, capturing the pure light-nāḍī and actualizing the four lamps on the Path—
[8120] From that very source:
<tantra> [8121] Moreover through nāḍī and illusory wheel,
<tantra> [8122] The five wisdoms of natural appearance,
<tantra> [8123] Are seen by the water-bubble eye.
[8124] Thus it is said.
[8125] Fifth:
[8126] In Trekchö, seeking clarity through the six sense-doors not purified, through the mind's phenomena; in Thögal, through the pure luminosity-door opened by wisdom-prāṇa, the four lamps' appearance dawns—this is superior.
[8127] From that very source:
<tantra> [8128] However it arises from the door,
<tantra> [8129] Through entering-prāṇa's force,
<tantra> [8130] From the four lamps, four activities arise.
[8131] Thus it is said.
[8132] Sixth:
[8133] In Trekchö, seeking clarity through the door of rigpa's self-clarity without seeing;
[8134] in Thögal, through the wisdom-door of external-internal spontaneous presence,
[8135] the appearance of dharmadhātu and wisdom without separation or dispersion is directly examined—this distinctive excellence is superior.
[8136] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [8137] To the pure dharmadhātu lamp,
<tantra> [8138] Bindus, bodies, and illusory appearances,
<tantra> [8139] Natural expression and essence-nature,
<tantra> [8140] Non-dual without separation or dispersion, appear.
[8141] Thus it is said.
[8142] Seventh:
[8143] In Trekchö, having caused external objects and internal mind's delusion to appear, through resting in the state without rejection or acceptance, those are not quickly liberated.
[8144] In Thögal, from the moment of applying crucial points,
[8145] external-internal illusory appearances together with deluded apprehension are self-liberated;
[8146] not depending upon purification resting in the state without abandoning,
[8147] wisdom's increasing appearance waxes like the moon's waxing fortnight,
[8148] the four appearances reaching full measure and quickly liberated.
[8149] From that source:
<verse> [8150] The manner of appearance is not delusion,
<verse> [8151] In the nature of pure causal conditions,
<verse> [8152] Entities and non-entities self-purified,
<verse> [8153] The five doors' object-grasping purified,
<verse> [8154] The coarse elements purified,
<verse> [8155] Pristine wisdom purified, increasing appearance shown,
<verse> [8156] From that, exhausted dharmatā.
[8157] Thus it is said.
[8158] Although these distinctions, analyzed in detail, are inconceivable,
[8159] I speak merely a brief outline.
[8160] In summary: through directly seeing rigpa's actual meaning and its visible presence,
[8161] delusion reverses in a single moment; through the body of investigation,
[8162] having made delusory appearance the Path, seeking the result of non-delusion—through this distinctive excellence, those possessing the eye of wisdom should understand.
[8163] Since this Dharma possesses such crucial points, it is called the supreme pinnacle of all.
[8164] Second: The presentation of Thögal possessing distinctive excellence has three parts:
<list> [8165] The general presentation of the three crucial points of dharmatā's wheel;
<list> [8166] The detailed explanation of the day-night luminosity wheel's manner of engagement;
<list> [8167] The extensive presentation of the vast expanse wisdom wheel.
[8168] First has four parts:
<list> [8169] The body's three crucial points of posture;
<list> [8170] The door's three crucial points of gaze;
<list> [8171] The dharmadhātu's three crucial points of guidance;
<list> [8172] The object's three crucial points of appearance.
[8173] First:
[8174] Whichever of the body's three postures one assumes,
[8175] there is purpose in resting the nāḍī-prāṇa in ease with relaxed abdomen;
[8176] if deliberately constrained, prāṇa and so forth become inverted and scattered, causing nāḍī constriction and excessive tension.
[8177] Therefore, together with the gaze, this distinctive Dharma of crucial points—drawing out slowly through the mouth from prāṇa dwelling extremely gently—is most important.
[8178] This, the common manner of exhaling and inhaling through the nose, filling the four wheels internally, generating clarity-luminosity samādhi,
[8179] in that manner: inverted prāṇa,
[8180] scattered prāṇa,
[8181] whirling prāṇa,
[8182] the four obscurations of sluggishness arising, various delusory appearances not dawning.
[8183] Here, purification of prāṇa does not increase the Path,
[8184] yet filling with the four wheels internally, although discursive thought's expansion is momentarily stopped, it cannot ultimately be stopped;
[8185] therefore, karmic prāṇa self-ceases and is released through the mouth.
[8186] Through the nose, entering solely the taste-channel,
[8187] then entering internally through the root of all four wheels,
[8188] discursive thought's various movements making the mind race—having blocked this here,
[8189] connecting mouth and throat,
[8190] through the throat's nāḍī like a grass-stalk's hollow, the mind's racing horse internally self-ceases and is released;
[8191] therefore, drawing prāṇa slowly out through the mouth and dwelling however long,
[8192] horse and rider separate individually,
[8193] the person dissolving into the heart's internal rigpa, accomplishing non-conceptual samādhi in spontaneous flow—this is the crucial point.
[8194] Occasionally, prāṇa with rushing sound and force violently expelled,
[8195] the obscuration of prāṇa-gathering, unpleasant mind,
[8196] afflictive discursive thought's movement,
[8197] heart-center's pain—all are cleared.
[8198] At those times, violent expulsion is the supreme crucial point.
[8199] Moreover, not knowing this prāṇa-crucial point, even if meditated, appearance's increase and signs reaching measure will certainly not arise.
[8200] Second, the door-gaze's three crucial points:
[8201] Whichever of the three gazes one performs, without constraining through effort,
[8202] relaxing internally in natural flow,
[8203] eyes unmoving, pressing the gaze is that crucial point.
[8204] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [8205] Distant-set without movement is the crucial point;
<tantra> [8206] At this time, apply the three gazes.
[8207] Thus it is said.
[8208] Third, regarding the dharmadhātu-guidance's three crucial points:
[8209] Slowly with eyes' corners, up and down, into dharmadhātu appearance's sharp edge, eyes unmoving, recognition unmoved, awareness resting in clarity-emptiness single-pointedly—this is the crucial point.
[8210] From that very source:
<tantra> [8211] Dharmadhātu's crucial point is guidance;
[8212] thus it is said, and:
[8213] From the Rtsal Dzog:
<verse> [8214] In dharmadhātu, mindfulness awakened, sky-space,
<verse> [8215] Appearing as five masses, garuḍa of gold soaring,
<verse> [8216] Without grasping attachment, without conceptual extremes, hovering.
<verse> [8217] In self-appearance without directional falling, sky-space,
<verse> [8218] Luminous-emptiness free from elaboration, garuḍa soaring,
<verse> [8219] Without grasping appearance, in that state hovering.
<verse> [8220] In signs free from elaboration, sky-space,
<verse> [8221] Free from grasping and apprehending, dharmakāya's garuḍa soaring,
<verse> [8222] Dharmatā's self-appearance in bindu's state hovering.
[8223] Thus it is said.
[8224] Fourth:
[8225] Through focusing upon external space-object cloudless sky, rigpa clears and opens, appearance quickly increasing;
[8226] through focusing upon internal dharmadhātu lamp, luminosity mother-child connect;
[8227] through focusing upon secret object rigpa's self-clarity, the meaning of primordial purity and exhausted phenomena self-clarifies in its own place—there exists this crucial point.
[8228] From the Rangshar:
<verse> [8229] In the sky-empty maṇḍala of space,
<verse> [8230] The uncontrived four lamps,
<verse> [8231] Unceasing through meaning's nature, clear.
<verse> [8232] Rigpa, dharmadhātu's lamp,
<verse> [8233] In sky-empty vast expanse's center,
<verse> [8234] Dharmadhātu's nature, light-body,
<verse> [8235] Unceasing, unceased, clearly appearing.
<verse> [8236] Five wisdoms complete, heart-mind's body,
<verse> [8237] Arising in garuḍa-fashion.
<verse> [8238] That too: going and coming,
<verse> [8239] Movement and trembling.
<verse> [8240] Rigpa, dharmadhātu's lamp,
<verse> [8241] Placed within, rigpa unmoved,
<verse> [8242] Unchanging realization excellently explained.
<verse> [8243] Self-arisen wisdom's lamp,
<verse> [8244] Cutting all superimpositions,
<verse> [8245] Empty bindu's lamp,
<verse> [8246] Without effort, arisen,
<verse> [8247] Distant ropes, water's lamp,
<verse> [8248] Gazing there unmoving,
<verse> [8249] Perfection of meditation's measure thus spoken.
[8250] Thus it is said, and:
[8251] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [8252] This itself, the object's crucial point is thus:
<tantra> [8253] In cloudless external object-emptiness,
<tantra> [8254] The yogin dwells in sky's bird-path;
<tantra> [8255] Not separating from this is dharmatā.
[8256] Thus it is said, and:
<tantra> [8257] Moreover:
<tantra> [8258] The characteristics of appearance's object are:
<tantra> [8259] In blue-green limitless sky,
<tantra> [8260] Light and color and form,
<tantra> [8261] Five wisdoms' self-appearance shown.
<tantra> [8262] To the pure dharmadhātu lamp,
<tantra> [8263] Bindus, bodies, and illusory appearances,
<tantra> [8264] Natural expression and essence-nature,
<tantra> [8265] Non-dual without separation or dispersion, appear.
[8266] Thus it is said.
[8267] At this time, although subtle discursive thought sha-ra-ra arises from prāṇa moving within the nāḍī,
[8268] there is no harm to directly perceived meaning;
[8269] that very discursive thought, unable to establish itself by itself, liberates and vanishes—
[8270] like a bird of prey catching and releasing,
[8271] though attention scatters elsewhere, without distraction like continuous garuḍa-thread,
[8272] karmic traces are not accumulated,
<verse> [8273] Luminosity's meditation is not destroyed;
<verse> [8274] Rigpa's potency placed in arising,
<verse> [8275] Wisdom spontaneously born, opening opportunity.
[8276] Moreover, through gaze-posture constraining, coarse discursive thought greatly blocked self-ceases;
[8277] subtle, small, fine discursive thought all self-liberated—
[8278] From the Thalgyur:
<verse> [8279] From single intent, no movement,
<verse> [8280] Appearance's appearance clear on appearance's peak,
<verse> [8281] From face and mirror-like,
<verse> [8282] Liberation is that and that itself liberated.
<verse> [8283] Knowing movement empty-vanished,
<verse> [8284] Seeing-knowing rigpa not different.
<verse> [8285] That itself liberated at its own peak.
<verse> [8286] Through single knowing, all liberated;
<verse> [8287] Two and three's numbers reach exhaustion.
<verse> [8288] Conceptualizing and grasping's object not appearing;
<verse> [8289] Movement and grasping primordially empty.
<verse> [8290] Empty intent clear-perfected,
<verse> [8291] Multiple numbers reach exhaustion.
[8292] Thus it is said.
[8293] At this time, the intent of View, Meditation, and Conduct three is gathered into single expanse:
[8294] From Vajrasattva's heart-mirror:
<verse> [8295] Without nihilistic extreme-falling, possessing View's measure;
<verse> [8296] Without conceptuality in clarity, possessing Meditation's measure;
<verse> [8297] Without contrivance in self-arising, possessing Conduct's measure;
<verse> [8298] Great bliss without outflow, this non-entity enlightenment,
<verse> [8299] Like water-moon, not held by grasping;
<verse> [8300] Like lord's treasure, self-arising desires.
[8301] Thus it is said.
[8302] Moreover, if dharmadhātu-rigpa's appearance has not dawned, through gazing evenly at the eye's corner,
[8303] at the time of seeing, looking unmovingly at the center of sky's maṇḍala of darkness and light is the crucial point.
[8304] From the Yige Medpa:
<verse> [8305] Rigpa resting-naturally, crucial instruction itself,
<verse> [8306] This is secret heart-essence;
<verse> [8307] Eyes should be firmly settled,
<verse> [8308] That too, examine without separation or dispersion.
<verse> [8309] From eye's corner, dharmadhātu arises;
<verse> [8310] Light, subtle, coiling arises.
<verse> [8311] That essence, garuḍa-fashion,
<verse> [8312] Subtle, trembling, and moving.
<verse> [8313] Eyes rest in sky's element;
<verse> [8314] Buddha-body's bindu appears.
<verse> [8315] From that, finding intent's warmth,
<verse> [8316] Rigpa's body is garuḍa-fashion,
<verse> [8317] Together with body, appearance.
[8318] Thus it is said.
[8319] At this juncture, the three certainty-pledges of luminosity's determining are:
<list> [8320] The manner of mind's stains purifying in essence-intent;
<list> [8321] The manner of resting evenly in state without movement;
<list> [8322] The manner of signs-measure time-certain arising from that.
[8323] First has three parts:
<list> [8324] Essence-intent itself;
<list> [8325] Mind and traces' illustrative examples;
<list> [8326] The main pledge of separation from that.
[8327] First:
[8328] From Samantabhadra's mind-mirror:
<verse> [8329] Unwavering sky, thus rigpa clear,
<verse> [8330] Clear without distraction, depth unfathomable state;
<verse> [8331] Luminous-emptiness vast, great bliss dharmadhātu, engage.
<verse> [8332] Single-pointed clarity, ultimate dharmadhātu's state;
<verse> [8333] Unmixed perfection, spontaneously accomplished ground abide.
[8334] Thus it is said.
[8335] In rigpa's essence, four wisdoms arising as self-potency show realization's superior seeing of natural state.
[8336] The four wisdoms:
[8337] From the Rangshar:
<verse> [8338] Moreover upon rigpa's essence,
<verse> [8339] Wisdom possessing four aspects,
<verse> [8340] These four wisdoms thus:
<verse> [8341] Liberating wisdom, liberating all,
<verse> [8342] Liberating everything completely;
<verse> [8343] Afflictions purified, liberated into pure field,
<verse> [8344] Without concept, without birth, liberated into state,
<verse> [8345] Ignorance into rigpa's expanse liberated,
<verse> [8346] Wisdom conceptuality into state liberated;
<verse> [8347] Therefore, liberating wisdom.
<verse> [8348] Stirring wisdom, moving
<verse> [8349] Five bodies pure, into dharmadhātu moving,
<verse> [8350] Five lights, grasping-free, into dharmadhātu moving,
<verse> [8351] Rigpa pristine wisdom, into dharmadhātu moving,
<verse> [8352] Lamps sky-space, into dharmadhātu moving;
<verse> [8353] Therefore, stirring wisdom.
<verse> [8354] Gathering wisdom, gathering
<verse> [8355] Elements five lights, internally gathering,
<verse> [8356] Sky-space lamps, internally gathering,
<verse> [8357] Five bodies' rigpa's state, internally gathering,
<verse> [8358] Rigpa without concept, internally gathering;
<verse> [8359] Therefore, gathering wisdom,
<verse> [8360] Gathering elements five lights internally,
<verse> [8361] Gathering sky-space lamps internally,
<verse> [8362] Gathering five bodies rigpa's state internally,
<verse> [8363] Gathering rigpa without concept internally;
<verse> [8364] Therefore, gathering wisdom.
<verse> [8365] Distinguishing wisdom, distinguishing
<verse> [8366] Ignorance and rigpa, distinguishing two,
<verse> [8367] Afflictions and pristine wisdom, distinguishing two,
<verse> [8368] Pure and impure, distinguishing two,
<verse> [8369] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, distinguishing two,
<verse> [8370] Realized and unrealized, distinguishing two,
<verse> [8371] Good and bad, distinguishing two;
<verse> [8372] Therefore, distinguishing wisdom.
[8373] Thus it is said.
[8374] Second, at that time, mind and traces' intent-purifications purifying:
[8375] The illustrative example of that:
[8376] From Vajrasattva's heart-mirror:
<verse> [8377] Emaho, Vajradhara, listen!
<verse> [8378] Unmatured discursive thought, saṃsāra,
<verse> [8379] Like iron inserted in gold,
<verse> [8380] Not liberated, liberation's time not arising.
<verse> [8381] Ignorance iron-inserted, not liberated;
<verse> [8382] Ignorance like water, afflictions gather.
<verse> [8383] Anger-fire like kalpa's fire-mass;
<verse> [8384] Attachment, whatever, like drinking brine-water;
<verse> [8385] Delusion-darkness like empty house darkness;
<verse> [8386] Pride-arrogance like pressing down mountains;
<verse> [8387] Jealousy ill-will like narrow dark valleys;
<verse> [8388] Five afflictions, wisdom's obscuration making;
<verse> [8389] Mind like bitch-thief;
<verse> [8390] Consciousness like forest monkey;
<verse> [8391] Mind like impure swamp;
<verse> [8392] All-basis like sentient-being pig;
<verse> [8393] Knowing like bird-feather wind-carried;
<verse> [8394] Grasping-apprehending like man woman;
<verse> [8395] Karmic varieties like bird-swarm circling;
<verse> [8396] Suffering varieties like water's ripples;
<verse> [8397] Affliction-result, endurance method lacking;
<verse> [8398] Saṃsāra's suffering, grasping-apprehending thorn-needle this,
<verse> [8399] By doing not released, by leaving released becomes;
<verse> [8400] Abandoning done phenomena, ease accomplished;
<verse> [8401] Abandoning all thought, supreme wisdom unmoved;
<verse> [8402] Secret mantra king, afflictions into wisdom transformed;
<verse> [8403] Like empty house lamp-kindled,
<verse> [8404] Wisdom-lamp, ignorance into rigpa transformed.
[8405] Thus it is said.
[8406] Third, the manner of separation from that has three parts:
<list> [8407] Direct perception's own-time separation itself;
<list> [8408] Establishing separation's validity;
<list> [8409] Speaking other designations.
[8410] First:
[8411] Through looking at external appearance-luminosity,
[8412] without delusion, internal self-clarity's meditation self-clear at that time,
[8413] mind and wisdom momentarily parting back-to-back, all-basis eight-collections together with wisdom covered,
[8414] saṃsāra's phenomena not clear.
[8415] The perfected past self-established spontaneously—
[8416] From Samantabhadra's mind-mirror:
<verse> [8417] Rigpa separated from mind, Buddha himself;
<verse> [8418] Wisdom separated from intellect, intent itself;
<verse> [8419] Hidden recess separated from light-rays, pure appearance itself.
[8420] Thus it is said, and:
[8421] From the Rangshar:
<verse> [8422] Rigpa separated from mind, Buddha himself;
<verse> [8423] Intellect separated from Vajrasattva, I;
<verse> [8424] Clarifier-appearance, without concept, knows;
<verse> [8425] Without concept, wisdom's equality,
<verse> [8426] Self by self liberated, great.
[8427] Thus it is said.
[8428] Second, validity:
[8429] Through resting unmoved in appearance's state, saṃsāra's phenomena self-liberated into self-vanishing, like water unmoved, sediment self-vanishing—
[8430] through the example of wish-fulfilling jewel and pure water, showing intent depth unfathomable:
[8431] From the former source:
<verse> [8432] Self-arisen nectar-drop this,
<verse> [8433] Like wish-fulfilling jewel, pure water;
<verse> [8434] If sediment-having left, sediment clears;
<verse> [8435] Thus this heart-essence instruction,
<verse> [8436] Applied, afflictions' stain not transformed.
<verse> [8437] Solitary ease, appearance as companion dawning;
<verse> [8438] Unborn dharmadhātu, pristine wisdom luminosity,
<verse> [8439] Exists in all, yet by all not seen;
<verse> [8440] Unfathomable by calculation, like sky-dharmadhātu;
<verse> [8441] Clear and shining, like sun's light;
<verse> [8442] Unchanging, like king-mountain Meru;
<verse> [8443] Deep and hard to fathom, like ocean's depths;
<verse> [8444] Unstained, like swamp's lotus;
<verse> [8445] Without apprehending, like water-moon;
<verse> [8446] Appearing as whatever, like sky's miracle;
<verse> [8447] Clear and perfect, like rainbows;
[8448] Thus it is said.
[8449] Third, speaking other designations:
[8450] Dharmadhātu-rigpa and so forth, all intents, root-rigpa's single expanse equalized, determined—
[8451] moreover from that very source:
<verse> [8452] All meaning, unborn dharmadhātu, transfer;
<verse> [8453] Path's lamp Bodhi, recognize;
<verse> [8454] All phenomena, expression-free state, gather;
<verse> [8455] All tantras, letter-free great tantra, into self-rigpa's great tantra, transfer;
<verse> [8456] All scriptures, untaught root-great scripture, transfer;
<verse> [8457] All instructions, expression-basis-free, transfer;
<verse> [8458] All sādhanas, doing-acting-free, transfer;
<verse> [8459] All conduct, uncontrived supreme great, transfer;
<verse> [8460] All meditation, clear grasping-free great, transfer;
<verse> [8461] All views, spontaneous, unattached to anything, transfer;
<verse> [8462] All results, wisdom single-decision great, transfer;
<verse> [8463] All those, into non-dwelling single expanse, gather;
<verse> [8464] All saṃsāra's activities, abandon;
<verse> [8465] To pristine wisdom's appearance, constantly familiarize;
<verse> [8466] Pristine wisdom arising's time, recognize;
<verse> [8467] All ground's phenomena, essence-nature-compassion three, know;
<verse> [8468] All Path's phenomena, five bodies five wisdoms, know;
<verse> [8469] All result's phenomena, three bodies irreversible, know;
<verse> [8470] All essence's phenomena, empty, know;
<verse> [8471] All nature's phenomena, clear, know;
<verse> [8472] All compassion's phenomena, pervading all sentient beings, know;
<verse> [8473] All pristine wisdom's phenomena, unmixed, know;
<verse> [8474] All light's phenomena, grasping-free, know;
<verse> [8475] All ray's phenomena, emanation-retraction free, know;
<verse> [8476] All rigpa's phenomena, free from self-concept, know;
<verse> [8477] Thus all phenomena, not thinking, not contriving, transfer—thus it is said.
[8478] Second, the manner of resting evenly unmoving in state has two parts:
<list> [8479] Brief presentation of resting in essence-state;
<list> [8480] Extensive explanation of resting in natural appearance.
[8481] First:
[8482] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [8483] Meditation's characteristic, appearance's manner,
<tantra> [8484] Characteristic empty-luminous rigpa,
<tantra> [8485] Nature wherever unmixed,
<tantra> [8486] Grasping and apprehending's extremes exhausted,
<tantra> [8487] Dharmatā's own face pure.
[8488] Thus it is said.
[8489] Second, extensive explanation of resting in natural appearance:
[8490] From the Klong Drugpa:
<tantra> [8491] Past three bodies, gaze upon;
<tantra> [8492] Future three bodies, back-support;
<tantra> [8493] Present three bodies, enjoy—
<tantra> [8494] This is Buddhas' result made present;
<tantra> [8495] Three times equality, primordially abiding, thus called.
<tantra> [8496] Past five wisdoms, as basis made;
<tantra> [8497] Future five wisdoms, peak directed;
<tantra> [8498] Present five wisdoms, made Path—
<tantra> [8499] Clarity to clarity's light gathering, thus called;
<tantra> [8500] Three times equality, rigpa's yoga.
<tantra> [8501] Past rigpa, confidence made;
<tantra> [8502] Future rigpa, measure taken;
<tantra> [8503] Present rigpa, made Path—
<tantra> [8504] Mother catching child, thus called;
<tantra> [8505] Three times equality, rigpa's yoga.
<tantra> [8506] Past bindus, portion taken;
<tantra> [8507] Future bindus, mind directed;
<tantra> [8508] Present bindus, all gathered one—
<tantra> [8509] Single alone, root cut, thus called;
<tantra> [8510] Three times equality, gathered yoga, thus called.
<tantra> [8511] Past dharmadhātu and boundary joined;
<tantra> [8512] Future dharmadhātu and expanse grown;
<tantra> [8513] Present dharmadhātu and ground one-abiding—
<tantra> [8514] Rigpa entered dharmadhātu, thus called;
<tantra> [8515] Three times equality, primordially connected, thus called.
<tantra> [8516] Past lamps, gaze upon;
<tantra> [8517] Future lamps, hand-grasped;
<tantra> [8518] Present lamps, clarity applied—
<tantra> [8519] Empty dharma-source lamp, self-pure view;
<tantra> [8520] Three times equality, primordially appearing.
<tantra> [8521] Past lights, Path-directed;
<tantra> [8522] Future lights, mind-placed;
<tantra> [8523] Present lights, mind-set—
<tantra> [8524] All appearance to self-expanse reached, thus called;
<tantra> [8525] Three times equality, primordially without separation or dispersion, thus it is said.
[8526] Third, the manner of signs-measure time-certain arising from that has three parts:
<list> [8527] Luminosity three bodies' signs;
<list> [8528] Samādhi spontaneously accomplished's measure;
<list> [8529] Unmoving even-resting's time.
[8530] First:
[8531] Moreover from that very source:
<verse> [8532] Through samādhi first resting-naturally,
<verse> [8533] Three bodies gradually accustomed,
<verse> [8534] Entity-nature's yogin,
<verse> [8535] Through this meaning, supreme nearness becomes.
<verse> [8536] Three bodies accustomed samādhi experienced,
<verse> [8537] Simultaneous arising is not;
<verse> [8538] All this gradually, mind's object.
<verse> [8539] At first, samādhi nirmāṇakāya obtained,
<verse> [8540] At that time, to self-knowing,
<verse> [8541] Previously unseen phenomena,
<verse> [8542] Without thinking, to mind arise.
<verse> [8543] Self-instruction's conventional words,
<verse> [8544] Without grasping, to mind radiate;
<verse> [8545] To person possessing fortune,
<verse> [8546] Dharma's taste, mind expanding,
<verse> [8547] Body too, six-seven days,
<verse> [8548] Existing things not felt,
<verse> [8549] Earth's surface transcending,
<verse> [8550] To intermediate space going experience,
<verse> [8551] Self's activity sphere arising.
<verse> [8552] Rigpa uncontrived, castle-placed,
<verse> [8553] Self thus obtains nirmāṇakāya.
<verse> [8554] That transcended, rigpa unmoved,
<verse> [8555] Saṃbhogakāya body too,
<verse> [8556] Self-knowing's continuum,
<verse> [8557] Self-appearance effort all-free,
<verse> [8558] Experience thus arising.
<verse> [8559] Previously unseen light-appearance too,
<verse> [8560] Mass by mass, who sees,
<verse> [8561] This too saṃbhogakāya trained;
<verse> [8562] Fortunate person, yogin, possessing family,
<verse> [8563] Knowing self-clear, experience each clear.
<verse> [8564] Self-clear mind gradual familiarity,
<verse> [8565] Internal clear, wavering-mind externally not moving,
<verse> [8566] Entity's after-mind not following,
<verse> [8567] World's activities mind not appearing.
<verse> [8568] Through this, saṃbhogakāya obtained.
<verse> [8569] Then rigpa to sky,
<verse> [8570] Resting-naturally great gaze,
<verse> [8571] Without distraction evenly resting,
<verse> [8572] Again dharmakāya's samādhi appears.
<verse> [8573] That time, knowing depth-clear,
<verse> [8574] Garuḍa-fashion directly engaging,
<verse> [8575] Appearance-increase's measure is.
<verse> [8576] Knowing sharp, quick,
<verse> [8577] Previously unseen Buddha seen,
<verse> [8578] This, that time, people,
<verse> [8579] Hundred-thousand million to mind appear.
<verse> [8580] Body's previously done,
<verse> [8581] Knowing-without knowing's crafts and,
<verse> [8582] Illusion-magic and letters and,
<verse> [8583] Signs and sounds and dependent-arising and,
<verse> [8584] How previously unseen,
<verse> [8585] All this experience and,
<verse> [8586] Earth and water and fire and wind's
<verse> [8587] Sound too through this self-power obtained;
<verse> [8588] In short, six clairvoyances too,
<verse> [8589] Fortunate person, this obtains,
<verse> [8590] Self and other benefits,
<verse> [8591] Person this accomplishes.
[8592] Thus it is said.
[8593] Second, samādhi spontaneously accomplished's measure:
[8594] Moreover from that very source:
<verse> [8595] Three bodies self-arisen intent,
<verse> [8596] In short, thus experience-measure found.
<verse> [8597] Nirmāṇakāya body's yogin engaging,
<verse> [8598] Previously non-existent great compassion,
<verse> [8599] Self-continuum supreme arising,
<verse> [8600] This time, nirmāṇakāya's samādhi obtained.
<verse> [8601] Clear without concept, knowing's experience,
<verse> [8602] Saṃbhogakāya's samādhi called.
<verse> [8603] Outflow-free emptiness bindu's body,
<verse> [8604] Effort-free self-arisen time,
<verse> [8605] Dharmakāya's samādhi,
<verse> [8606] Yogin possessing this obtains.
[8607] Thus it is said.
[8608] Third, unmoving even-resting's time has two parts:
<list> [8609] Luminosity direct-appearance's time;
<list> [8610] Instruction arising-place application time.
[8611] First:
[8612] Moreover from that very source:
<verse> [8613] All appearance self-power transformed,
<verse> [8614] Rigpa directly shown time,
<verse> [8615] Intent true-seeing's time called.
<verse> [8616] All appearance self-direction arisen,
<verse> [8617] Experience's seed increasing time,
<verse> [8618] Rigpa itself to balance reached time called.
<verse> [8619] Person arising's strength exhausted,
<verse> [8620] Knowing all inward-looking time,
<verse> [8621] Rigpa's arising-place applying time.
<verse> [8622] Dharmatā condition-free, all appearance blissfully vast time,
<verse> [8623] Dharmatā mother-child equal time called.
<verse> [8624] Buddhas' truth-light, self-body filling expanding,
<verse> [8625] Body manifestly enlightened time,
<verse> [8626] Stability self-obtained's time called.
[8627] Thus it is said.
[8628] Second, instruction arising-place applying time:
[8629] From the Rangshar:
<verse> [8630] Continuum-knowing-rigpa arising time,
<verse> [8631] Body recognize;
<verse> [8632] Realization continuum-born time, rigpa's object recognize;
<verse> [8633] Samādhi power-transformed time, lamps pure, recognize;
<verse> [8634] Strength distinctive born time, samādhi path-clear, recognize;
<verse> [8635] Rigpa's body seen time, desire-free, know;
<verse> [8636] Wisdom distinctive continuum-born time, māra's deception recognize;
<verse> [8637] No-difficulty conduct vast-expanse time, wisdom's entering-direction recognize;
<verse> [8638] Emptiness object-pervading time, light recognize;
<verse> [8639] Lamp object-appearing time, dharmadhātu and object recognize—thus it is said.
[8640] From the Senge Tsal Dzog:
<verse> [8641] Appearance mass by mass time,
<verse> [8642] Scholar should well examine;
<verse> [8643] Extremely subtle and trembling time,
<verse> [8644] Through familiarity well abide.
<verse> [8645] Trembling and subtle and trembling time,
<verse> [8646] Through seeing well grasp;
<verse> [8647] Round and subtle and coiling time,
<verse> [8648] Scholar unmoved samādhi stabilize.
<verse> [8649] Flickering and fire-like and body-appearing time,
<verse> [8650] Through familiarity appearance expand, grasp;
<verse> [8651] Perfectly all-appearing time,
<verse> [8652] Scholar appearance gather explained.
<verse> [8653] Attachment and clinging-free time,
<verse> [8654] Scholar grasping-method should know.
<verse> [8655] Secret mantra familiarization's characteristic.
[8656] Thus it is said.
[8657] Second, day-night luminosity wheel has three parts:
<list> [8658] Dharmadhātu-luminosity's arising-basis recognition;
<list> [8659] From that, lamps' practice shown;
<list> [8660] Day-night wheel-revolution's meditation manner determined.
[8661] First:
[8662] Although spoken before, here extensively summarized, clearly shown in five:
<list> [8663] Dharmadhātu's abiding manner;
<list> [8664] Lamps' location manner;
<list> [8665] Dharmadhātu-rigpa arising manner;
<list> [8666] Practice engagement manner;
<list> [8667] Distinctive certainty manner.
[8668] First:
[8669] Dharmadhātu's luminosity, Sugata's essence, exists without distinction in all sentient beings.
[8670] From the Norbu Phradak:
<verse> [8671] Like sesame or mustard seed,
<verse> [8672] Oil itself primordially spontaneously complete,
<verse> [8673] Sentient being body-appearance,
<verse> [8674] Thus Tathāgata's seed,
<verse> [8675] Harmonious light and self-complete
<verse> [8676] Abiding, Path-entering door-pure,
<verse> [8677] Arising variously, benefit engaging.
<verse> [8678] Sky-space everywhere pervading sentient beings,
<verse> [8679] Rigpa's meaning also that much.
[8680] Thus it is said.
[8681] Where it exists:
[8682] From that very source:
<verse> [8683] Emaho, rigpa's abiding nature,
<verse> [8684] Self's heart-center abides;
<verse> [8685] Father-mother two's aspect-holding,
<verse> [8686] Method-wisdom manner abides.
<verse> [8687] Father's aspect-holding, method's body;
<verse> [8688] Mother's aspect-holding, wisdom's body;
<verse> [8689] Light and rays manner abides.
<verse> [8690] Dharmadhātu and rigpa excellently adorned,
<verse> [8691] Spontaneously perfected great bindu abides.
[8692] Thus it is said.
[8693] Moreover, how body and wisdom abide as dharmadhātu-rigpa's light-expanse,
[8694] location certainty is what and what:
[8695] From the Rtsal Dzog:
<verse> [8696] Each-own mind-jewel within,
<verse> [8697] Colorful light-blazing, vase-fashion,
<verse> [8698] Inside pristine wisdom fire-light blazing,
<verse> [8699] Measureless various pristine wisdoms appearing.
<verse> [8700] Body's essence each-each,
<verse> [8701] Speech's emanation countless,
<verse> [8702] Mind's intent unsurpassable one.
<verse> [8703] Thus it is said, and:
<verse> [8704] All-basis dharma-source great treasury,
<verse> [8705] Rigpa's pristine wisdom as mass abides;
<verse> [8706] Appearance grasping-free object's treasury,
<verse> [8707] Rigpa's pristine wisdom dharmadhātu abides.
<verse> [8708] Secret-gathering jewel eight-cornered treasury,
<verse> [8709] Rigpa's pristine wisdom as mass abides;
<verse> [8710] Appearance grasping-free object's treasury,
<verse> [8711] Rigpa's pristine wisdom dharmadhātu abides.
<verse> [8712] Secret-gathering jewel eight-cornered treasury,
<verse> [8713] Rigpa's pristine wisdom father-mother fashion,
<verse> [8714] Life-gathering jewel four-cornered treasury,
<verse> [8715] Rigpa's pristine wisdom bindu abides.
<verse> [8716] Meaning-coiled bhāṇḍa's measureless palace treasury,
<verse> [8717] Rigpa's pristine wisdom wrathful body abides.
<verse> [8718] Unceasing clear two-doors treasury,
<verse> [8719] Dharmadhātu and garuḍa-fashion abides.
<verse> [8720] Emptiness signless sky-space treasury,
<verse> [8721] Rigpa's pristine wisdom light abides;
<verse> [8722] That is shown as secret treasury.
[8723] Thus it is said.
[8724] Moreover, rigpa's essence that basis-heart abiding, time, dharmadhātu five lights within exists, like peacock's egg.
[8725] Path dharmadhātu dawning time, sky-space's rainbow-light;
[8726] completion time, like chick freed from egg-shell.
[8727] From the Rtsal Dzog:
<verse> [8728] Basis-abiding rigpa,
<verse> [8729] In pristine wisdom dharmadhātu, three bodies complete;
<verse> [8730] Like peacock's egg example,
<verse> [8731] Internal light pristine wisdom clearly shown.
<verse> [8732] Path-dawning rigpa,
<verse> [8733] Like rainbow example shown;
<verse> [8734] Completion-directed rigpa,
<verse> [8735] Like peacock chick eggs,
<verse> [8736] Breaking, emerging, benefit-engaging.
[8737] Thus it is said.
[8738] Moreover, that pristine wisdom unmatured time, opening for all;
[8739] appearing time, light;
<verse> [8740] Familiar time, body-appearance;
<verse> [8741] From that, expression-free dharmadhātu,
<verse> [8742] Luminosity unobstructed touch arises;
<verse> [8743] Appearing time, light-appears,
<verse> [8744] Perfection time, self-appearance.
<verse> [8745] Familiar time, body transforms,
<verse> [8746] Wisdom-method connected,
<verse> [8747] Ultimate maṇḍala five seen.
[8748] Thus it is said.
[8749] Thus abiding body and rigpa and dharmadhātu and wisdom's characteristics:
[8750] Moreover from that very source:
<verse> [8751] Body's characteristics thus:
<verse> [8752] Unchanging and clear and,
<verse> [8753] Empty and concept-free.
<verse> [8754] Rigpa's characteristics thus:
<verse> [8755] Subtle and spreading and,
<verse> [8756] Garuḍa-fashion and moving.
<verse> [8757] Dharmadhātu's characteristics thus:
<verse> [8758] Vast and spontaneously thick, empty limitless,
<verse> [8759] Clear and warm and cool and,
<verse> [8760] Soft and trembling nature-holding.
<verse> [8761] Pervading and boundary and encircling.
<verse> [8762] Pristine wisdom's characteristics thus:
<verse> [8763] Arising and arisen and self-clear and,
<verse> [8764] Pristine and knowing and realized.
<verse> [8765] Clear and shining and vast-extent,
<verse> [8766] Appearance and darkness and opening,
<verse> [8767] Empty and clear pristine wisdom supreme.
<verse> [8768] Secret mantra's characteristics thus considered.
[8769] Thus it is said.
[8770] Second, lamps' location manner:
[8771] For gods, one cubit;
[8772] for demigods, four inches;
[8773] for humans, one joint;
[8774] for animals, self-clear;
[8775] for hungry ghosts, sesame-size;
[8776] for hell-beings, horse-hoof size.
[8777] For Buddhas, immeasurable;
[8778] for bodhisattvas, arrow-length.
[8779] For nirmāṇakāya, one fathom.
[8780] Self-light pristine wisdom's appearance existing:
[8781] Moreover from that very source:
<verse> [8782] Pristine wisdom abiding-nature great-small and,
<verse> [8783] Six appearances' directions from,
<verse> [8784] Well-explained thus:
<verse> [8785] Tuṣita gods, one cubit abides;
<verse> [8786] Contention gods, four inches abides;
<verse> [8787] Equal gods, one joint;
<verse> [8788] Two-possessing gods, self-clear;
<verse> [8789] Hunger-possessing, sesame-size;
<verse> [8790] Suffering-possessing, horse-hoof size;
<verse> [8791] Thus and thus, abiding explained.
<verse> [8792] Buddhas, immeasurable;
<verse> [8793] Bodhisattvas, arrow-length;
<verse> [8794] Nirmāṇakāya body, one fathom abides.
<verse> [8795] Buddha bodhisattvas and,
<verse> [8796] Nirmāṇakāya body and gods,
<verse> [8797] Directly object-appearing.
<verse> [8798] Those below, five objects,
<verse> [8799] Not shown, not seen.
[8800] Thus it is said.
[8801] Moreover, that intermediate space self-appearance Buddha-bodhisattva-god three lamps' appearance great is due to vast object;
[8802] others five, self-body's object, therefore small.
[8803] Third, dharmadhātu-rigpa's arising manner has two:
<list> [8804] Dharmadhātu is internal existing five lights, pristine wisdom's self-resonance external object blue vast great light;
<list> [8805] from that expanding five possessing great pristine wisdom's light, two object-appearance self-arisen.
[8806] Rigpa is vajra garuḍa-fashion appearance portion body together with—
[8807] From the Rtsal Dzog:
<tantra> [8808] All Buddhas' heart-center,
<tantra> [8809] Dharmadhātu-rigpa two not transcending.
[8810] Thus it is said, and:
[8811] From the Vajra Garuḍa itself:
<verse> [8812] Portion body inconceivable,
<verse> [8813] Self-arisen dharmadhātu's lamp,
<verse> [8814] Self-appearance light inconceivable.
<verse> [8815] Empty bindu's lamp,
<verse> [8816] Ray-possessing bindu inconceivable.
<verse> [8817] Five pristine wisdoms' essence,
<verse> [8818] Indicating words inconceivable.
<verse> [8819] Condition-free object's appearance,
<verse> [8820] Unceasing arising inconceivable.
[8821] Thus it is said.
[8822] Fourth, practice engagement manner has two:
<list> [8823] Constraining through crucial points;
<list> [8824] From that, arising experience-appearance.
[8825] First also: general resting method and,
<list> [8826] distinctive extracting method, two from:
[8827] First:
[8828] Resting in the lap, applying thumb-finger covering to red-clear pure light round appearance, engage in practice.
[8829] Short sessions, many numbers make,
[8830] thumb-finger's effort released, slowly gazing,
[8831] again covering appearance seen is dharmatā's direct-appearance, thus called.
[8832] From that very source:
<verse> [8833] Self's thumb and finger,
<verse> [8834] Empty bindu's lamp cover;
<verse> [8835] From that covering, whatever arises,
<verse> [8836] Dharmatā's direct-appearance.
[8837] Thus it is said.
