[16436] The First:
[16437] In Dharmatā, from the perspective of that upon which one looks, since the essence of any is not established, it is free from the extremes of elaboration;
[16438] Since it transcends the grasping of entity identity, it is without arising, ceasing, transference, or transformation;
[16439] Since the ultimate is directly manifest, Dharmatā is inconceivable.
[16440] The Second:
[16441] The Dharmakāya pervading all of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, possessing twofold purity—pure through the purification of adventitious stains—is That.
<tantra> [16442] From Hevajra:
<tantra> [16443] "Sentient beings are truly Buddhas,
<tantra> [16444] Yet obscured by adventitious stains.
<tantra> [16445] When these are cleared away, they are truly Buddhas."
<tantra> [16446] Thus it is spoken.
[16447] From Uttaratantra:
<verse> [16448] "The Perfect Buddha's Body is emanating,
<verse> [16449] Suchness is without distinction,
<verse> [16450] Because of possessing the Lineage, all sentient beings
<verse> [16451] Always possess the Essence of Buddhahood."
<verse> [16452] Thus the portion of direct manifestation is spoken.
[16453] The Third:
[16454] Each vehicle demonstrates Rigpa,
[16455] Emptiness,
[16456] And qualities and so forth.
[16457] Here in the Great Perfection, if divided through miraculous display:
[16458] Dharmakāya's Dharmakāya fields—inconceivable;
[16459] Abode—Dharmatā transcending the mind's grasping;
[16460] Samādhi—great Immovable;
[16461] Retinue—various self-nature, non-dual;
[16462] Teaching—indescribable Dharmatā;
[16463] Time—Dharmatā without transformation at any time.
[16464] Dharmakāya's Saṃbhogakāya fields—free from dust, without stain;
[16465] Abode—memory, mind's thought self-dissolved;
[16466] Samādhi—cessation of mind and mental factors' arisings, wisdom self-abiding;
[16467] Retinue—empty, self-appearance's agent;
[16468] Teaching—pure, complete perception;
[16469] Time—without investigation, great primordial equality.
[16470] Dharmakāya's Nirmāṇakāya:
[16471] Fields—emptiness, unbroken space;
[16472] Abode—arising-basis of all, great self-clarity of depth;
[16473] Samādhi—unceasing, self-clear;
[16474] Retinue—pure appearance without class-distinction;
[16475] Teaching—unfabricated self-nature;
[16476] Time—essence directly manifest.
[16477] These too are designated from Dharmakāya's aspect of primordial purity self-abiding.
<tantra> [16478] From Ratnaketu:
<tantra> [16479] "Through self-pure Dharmakāya,
<tantra> [16480] Self-pure without elaboration, in celestial palace,
<tantra> [16481] In appearance-retinue nondual with oneself,
<tantra> [16482] Through markless Speech,
<tantra> [16483] Elaboration-free words
<tantra> [16484] Are emitted from nonabiding self-dissolved Mind.
<tantra> [16485] Without speaking, without having spoken,
<tantra> [16486] Shown in the state of Great Equality."
<tantra> [16487] Thus it is.
[16488] These too are merely designated as aspects;
[16489] In meaning, since established nowhere, they abide in Great Perfection free from extremes.
<tantra> [16490] From that very text:
<tantra> [16491] "This abode of 'this,'
<tantra> [16492] The named designated field with its marks,
<tantra> [16493] Whatever form appears nowhere,
<tantra> [16494] Nonexistent emptiness from Dharmodaya,
<tantra> [16495] In the great secret Expanse,
<tantra> [16496] Abiding from the primordial beginning,
<tantra> [16497] Ungrasped, in the manner of abiding,
<tantra> [16498] Great Play arose primordially.
<tantra> [16499] Here none abide.
<tantra> [16500] None make an abode.
<tantra> [16501] Here there is no perfection.
<tantra> [16502] Devoid of dwelling and coming.
<tantra> [16503] Thus, the place of great primordial emptiness,
<tantra> [16504] From nonexistence, the Expanse's field,
<tantra> [16505] Here there is neither outer nor inner.
<tantra> [16506] Above and below, no looking.
<tantra> [16507] In directions and intermediate points, none ever
<tantra> [16508] Has anything to grasp here."
<tantra> [16509] Thus it is.
[16510] The Fourth: Extensive explanation of enumerations:
[16511] From Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities, and Activities—five:
[16512] Dharmakāya's Body—empty-clarity, markless;
[16513] Speech—indescribable, transcending words and speech;
[16514] Mind—without memory, thought, or elaboration;
[16515] Qualities—never regressing, without transformation;
[16516] Activities—spontaneous presence, abiding as basis of unceasing manifestation-manner.
<tantra> [16517] From Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16518] "Dharmakāya: Body and Speech,
<tantra> [16519] Mind and Qualities and Activities.
<tantra> [16520] Body: emptiness and clarity,
<tantra> [16521] And markless self-nature.
<tantra> [16522] Speech: separated from words, speech, and names,
<tantra> [16523] Without speaking and discussing.
<tantra> [16524] Mind: without thought and change,
<tantra> [16525] Transcending spreading and investigating.
<tantra> [16526] Qualities: never coming or regressing,
<tantra> [16527] Pervading Expanse and jñāna,
<tantra> [16528] And self-nature unfabricated.
<tantra> [16529] Activities: unarisen, unborn,
<tantra> [16530] Arising potency, without ceasing,
<tantra> [16531] Without making, without having made."
<tantra> [16532] Thus it is.
[16533] Saṃbhogakāya extensively explained also comprises
[16534] Essence,
[16535] Definitive terminology,
[16536] Divisions,
[16537] And enumerations—four aspects.
[16538] Essence's defining characteristic: completely perfect in great self-clarity,
[16539] Essence's abiding manner: unchanging in nature, Kāya of marks and signs, families clearly manifest yet unmoving.
[16540] Saṃbhogakāya's definitive terminology: engaging in appearance as Saṃbhogakāya, in that itself wisdom unceasingly engaging.
[16541] Kāya: great self-clear display-arrangement.
[16542] Saṃbhogakāya's divisions are four:
<list> [16543] Great element Essence-Kāya;
<list> [16544] All-pervading abiding manner Kāya;
<list> [16545] Appearance path Kāya;
<list> [16546] Those to be trained's appearance manner Kāya.
[16547] The first:
[16548] Self-arisen from Dharmakāya's manifestation-basis, perfected as the fivefold luminosity-Kāya:
[16549] Appearance-basis great elements' nature: clear warmth,
[16550] Coolness,
[16551] Spaciousness,
[16552] Possessing all-pervading identity.
[16553] The second:
[16554] For all Buddhas and sentient beings, the aspect of pervasion by light and light-mansion directly manifest.
<tantra> [16555] From Self-Arisen:
<tantra> [16556] "Abiding as light's heart-essence for all,
<tantra> [16557] Thought-free completely pure Dharmadhātu,
<tantra> [16558] The single without rival,
<tantra> [16559] Maṇḍala, retinue, palace,
<tantra> [16560] And awareness, emptiness, and clarity."
<tantra> [16561] Thus it is spoken.
[16562] The third:
[16563] The Saṃbhogakāya of appearance-basis Dharmatā, appearing to sentient beings in the bardo as path, here guiding those to be trained—self-arisen from Dharmakāya's inner Expanse,
[16564] Within the expanse of light and color,
[16565] Maṇḍala,
[16566] Retinue,
[16567] Individual assemblies,
[16568] Kāya,
[16569] Wisdom,
[16570] Father,
[16571] Mother,
[16572] Kāya-colors,
[16573] Hand-symbols, and so forth clearly manifest.
<tantra> [16574] From secret seed-cause,
<tantra> [16575] To nature-appearance,
<tantra> [16576] Nature-Kāya manifests;
<tantra> [16577] Like oneself and reflection.
<tantra> [16578] Three Kāyas: luminosity, emptiness,
<tantra> [16579] Not permanent, without entity,
<tantra> [16580] Not severed: luminosity-Kāya,
<tantra> [16581] Without distinction, without outer-inner."
<tantra> [16582] Thus it is spoken.
[16583] The fourth:
[16584] To those to be trained by Saṃbhogakāya, individually appearing according to family and maṇḍala,
[16585] Divided through emanation, empowered by those to be trained.
[16586] Saṃbhogakāya's Dharmakāya Vairocana, great ocean,
[16587] That abiding manner: externally viewed, internally clear;
[16588] Internally viewed, externally clear;
[16589] Through thorough openness, without front or back;
[16590] From wherever viewed, like showing face—appearance: face in ten directions, completely open.
[16591] That field: completely adorned ornament-arrangement,
[16592] At the palm's lotus-top, reigning over twenty-five world-systems.
[16593] Field: completely pure dense array,
[16594] Retinue: not other than oneself,
[16595] Teaching: self-arisen wisdom self-appearing,
[16596] Time: realization directly manifest.
[16597] This, regarding self-appearance primordially as emanation,
[16598] Regarding those to be trained's luminosity, is posited as Saṃbhogakāya through perfection of marks and signs.
[16599] Saṃbhogakāya's Saṃbhogakāya: appearing as five families' principal five.
[16600] That defining characteristic: essence different, nature single.
[16601] Fields: individual families' maṇḍalas, immeasurable;
[16602] Field: great Akaniṣṭha, retinues of individual five families;
[16603] Teaching: engaging in five wisdoms of knowing;
[16604] Time: appearance of training flourishing.
[16605] Saṃbhogakāya's Nirmāṇakāya:
[16606] Five families' Buddhas and individual principal retinues.
[16607] That defining characteristic: without nature in appearance,
[16608] Without conception in clarity.
[16609] That field: gods and goddesses, inconceivable, pure appearance of enjoyment.
[16610] Field: Trāyastriṃśa, basis of wisdom-display;
[16611] Retinue: Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, immeasurable;
[16612] Time: awareness self-appearing time.
[16613] Yet not yakṣa-realm Trāyastriṃśa,
[16614] But five families' field-appearance,
[16615] Naturally pure,
[16616] Five lights' appearance self-clear,
[16617] Engaging in great enjoyment of five wisdoms' aspects,
[16618] Free from all affliction-pain.
<tantra> [16619] From Jewel Heap:
<tantra> [16620] "Through self-clear pure Saṃbhogakāya,
<tantra> [16621] In five lights' pure celestial palace,
<tantra> [16622] Through elaboration-free bliss Speech,
<tantra> [16623] To five-Kāya families' retinues,
<tantra> [16624] Non-entity pure Dharmas
<tantra> [16625] Are emitted from five-wisdom-gathered Mind,
<tantra> [16626] Completely pure light-rays spread from tongue.
<tantra> [16627] Even to self-arisen six syllables,
<tantra> [16628] Unspoken, shown as great self-arisen."
<tantra> [16629] Thus it is spoken.
[16630] Saṃbhogakāya means:
[16631] Through essence, not demonstrating Dharmas as word—thus "unspoken."
[16632] The six syllables' self-sound heard by those to be trained:
[16633] Like dream-words, appearing as spoken.
<tantra> [16634] From Six Expanses:
<tantra> [16635] "Without speaking from one's own mouth,
<tantra> [16636] In dream-like defining characteristic,
<tantra> [16637] To retinue's Bodhisattvas,
<tantra> [16638] Wisdom's analytical thought appears in mind."
<tantra> [16639] Thus it is spoken.
[16640] The fourth: extensively explained enumerations from Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities, and Activities:
[16641] Saṃbhogakāya's Body:
[16642] Empty-clarity, like a rainbow.
[16643] Speech:

[16649] Speech: self-arisen, appearing as self-sound of syllables.
[16650] Mind: becomes the ocean-treasure of clairvoyance and samādhi.
[16651] Activities:

<tantra> [16653] From Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16654] "Saṃbhogakāya too: Body, Speech, Mind,
<tantra> [16655] Qualities, Activities—five.
<tantra> [16656] Body: appearing, without nature,
<tantra> [16657] Clarity and clear-maker pervaded by families.

<tantra> [16667] Bodhisattvas too,
<tantra> [16668] Self-arisen from tongue-tip, emanated,
<tantra> [16669] To retinue, shown by own essence."

[16672] Essence,
[16673] Definitive terminology,
[16674] Divisions,
[16675] And enumerations—four.
[16676] Essence:
[16677] Various, without determination.
[16678] That essence's abiding manner:
[16679] Liberated from attachment and fixation,
[16680] Samādhi: abiding evenly in the state of Mind without thought.
[16681] Definitive terminology:
[16682] Since emanated for whomever, whatever is to be trained, therefore "emanation;"
[16683] That very form complete with excellent marks, therefore "Kāya."
[16684] Divisions: common and uncommon approaches—two:
[16685] Common vehicle's renowned three:
<tantra> [16686] From Sūtrālaṃkāra:
<tantra> [16687] "Craft, birth, and great enlightenment,
<tantra> [16688] Supreme enlightenment's emanation—
<tantra> [16689] This Buddha's Nirmāṇakāya
<tantra> [16690] Is the great method of complete liberation."
<tantra> [16691] Thus it is spoken.
[16692] Craft:
[16693] Paintings and so forth.
[16694] Birth:
[16695] Buddha emanating as forms for common beings: horses, great fish, and so forth.
[16696] Supreme enlightenment's emanation:
[16697] The twelve deeds:
<tantra> [16698] From Uttaratantra:
<tantra> [16699] "Without moving from Dharmakāya,
<tantra> [16700] Through emanation's various self-nature,
<tantra> [16701] Birth, manifest birth,
<tantra> [16702] Transference from Tuṣita abode,
<tantra> [16703] Entry into womb and birth,
<tantra> [16704] Skill in craft's abodes,
<tantra> [16705] Enjoyment with queen's retinue,
<tantra> [16706] Practice of difficult austerities, renunciation,
<tantra> [16707] Going to enlightenment's heart,
<tantra> [16708] Defeating māra hosts and perfecting,
<tantra> [16709] Supreme enlightenment and turning Dharma-wheel,
<tantra> [16710] Together with all gods,
<tantra> [16711] Constantly showing Parinirvāṇa,
<tantra> [16712] In impure fields,
<tantra> [16713] Showing abiding as long as existence."
<tantra> [16714] Thus it is spoken.
[16715] In this uncommon vehicle:
[16716] Impure Nirmāṇakāya,
[16717] Nirmāṇakāya training beings,
[16718] And self-nature Nirmāṇakāya—three.
