[8972-8989]
Structural function: Establishes the fundamental view that awareness in all states—deluded or not, wandering or passed, sleeping or awake—has no good-bad distinction. The structural enumeration demonstrates the view's universality across all conditions without exception.

View register: Rigpa's immutable nature across all states. When awareness is not meditated, during meditation, during wandering, at passing time—none have good-bad distinction. This is not nihilism but recognition: the essence does not transform. Appearance-ways show dream-like joy and suffering, but these are not the essence.

Translation risk: No good-bad distinction risks being read as amorality rather than transcendence of evaluation. The phrase wandering wrongly in suffering when the jewel is lost requires contextual understanding—suffering is real as appearance, empty as essence.

Preservation: The jewel metaphor is central: precious jewel nectar of awareness lost in beginningless time, causing suffering through wrong wandering, not found by searching because never truly lost. Self-arisen, realized by self. The Rangshar citation establishes canonical authority. The paradox: losing without knowing, finding with joy—yet both moments without distinction in single nature.

Structural function: Elaborates the jewel metaphor's implications for practice. The structural progression from external metaphor to internal recognition follows the standard movement from coarse to subtle.

View register: Self-arising within self-awareness nature. Though lost within self-awareness, found from its own nature. Within the single mandala of self-awareness, no going elsewhere. The king's treasury metaphor: jewel lost in treasury causes suffering; found causes joy—yet both remain in same treasury unmoved. Samsara and nirvana appearing from awareness nature are similar.

Translation risk: The treasury metaphor risks being read as psychological rather than ontological. Single mandala could be interpreted as solipsism rather than non-dual recognition.

Preservation: This is the secret word of supreme wish-fulfilling self-nature determining the vast expanse of dharma-nature. The key point: awareness never moves, never changes, yet appears to wander and return. The recognition that wandering and returning are the same unmoved nature is the view.

Structural function: Transition from view to practice through lamp placement preparation. The structural threefold division into retreat characteristics, lamp placement method, and appearance arising establishes practice framework.

View register: Lamp placement as direct continuation of view recognition. Prerequisites include abandoning this-life activities, pleasing authentic guru, dwelling in secluded place with three unmoving aspects, completing guru yoga. The Talgyur citation establishes the method: faithful one abandoning samsara mind, making offerings, abandoning samsara connections, dwelling alone in secluded place.

Translation risk: Abandoning this-life activities risks extreme interpretation. The Tibetan context emphasizes mental non-attachment rather than physical renunciation alone.

Preservation: The retreat characteristics establish optimal conditions: darkness-surrounded room, three unmoving aspects, guru yoga completion. These are supports for recognition, not requirements. The lamp placement has two aspects: placing on the letter a, and entering into clarity. The essential point: view and practice are continuous, not sequential.
