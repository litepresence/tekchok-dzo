Structural function: This section establishes the three-kāya posture system, presenting the nirmāṇakāya posture as the foundation for physical practice. The structural arrangement provides detailed technical specifications: feet position for method-wisdom connection, soles pressing for controlling the active winds, knee-chest contact for settling the bodily elements, straight spine for preventing channel constriction, crossed hands for merging space and awareness, and extended neck for releasing the wind realm. This systematic presentation serves as the practical manual for kāya-specific meditation postures.

[4482-4522]
Translation risk: The technical terminology for the three-kāya postures requires precise rendering to maintain their specific energetic and realization functions. The term "essential point" refers to specific junctions where physical alignment influences subtle energy; this technical usage differs from general usage and requires careful preservation. The etymological explanation of nirmāṇakāya—body that accomplishes various actions, purifies and matures—establishes the functional definition of the term that underlies its physical expression.

[4523-4555]
Structural function: This section presents the saṃbhogakāya posture, establishing the elephant-lying position as the support for enjoyment-body realization. The structural arrangement parallels the nirmāṇakāya presentation: physical specifications followed by essential points and scriptural authority. The specifications include lying with chin tucked, knee-chest contact, toe extension, hand palm grounding, and raised chin. This systematic presentation enables practitioners to adopt the posture with precise alignment for optimal energetic effect.

[4556-4585]
View register: The perspective here presents the saṃbhogakāya posture as the physical support for direct experience of dharmatā. The posture enables the practitioner to remain continuously in the direct perception of reality through the sense power of the eyes. The view that this posture establishes the body as the site of enjoyment—purifying the five sense pleasures and introducing them into the unborn path—captures the non-dual relationship between physical posture and realization. The golden sky citation establishes the textual foundation for this posture as the supreme body essential point.

[4586-4600]
Preservation note: The detailed technical specifications for each posture serve as practical meditation instructions and require precise preservation. The connections between specific physical alignments and their energetic effects—controlling active winds, settling elements, preventing channel constriction—constitute technical knowledge that enables the postures to function as supports for realization. The scriptural citations from the Golden Sky establish the authoritative basis for these postures within the tradition.

[4600-4616]
Structural function: This section presents the dharmakāya posture, establishing the lion-entering-its-lair position as the support for truth-body realization. The structural arrangement follows the established pattern: physical specifications, essential points, and scriptural authority. The specifications include soles grounding, relaxed upright body, hand fingers pressing the ground, chest space open, and neck supported. This completes the presentation of the three-kāya posture system.

[4600-4647]
View register: The perspective here presents the dharmakāya posture as the physical expression of liberation from all confused fear. The posture of the lion—unafraid, majestic, sovereign—embodies the view of complete freedom from cyclic existence. The open chest and supported neck establish the conditions for rapid appearance of meditative experiences, while the finger grounding and relaxed body control the active and wisdom winds. This posture expresses the view that transcends all form while remaining in form.

[4600-4681]
Translation risk: The distinction between the three postures and their specific functions requires precise rendering. Each posture connects to specific kāya manifestation: nirmāṇakāya appears in the world, saṃbhogakāya in pure realms, dharmakāya beyond all form. The technical explanations of the posture names—what they accomplish, how they purify, where they abide—establish the functional definitions that guide proper adoption and use. These technical distinctions require careful preservation to maintain their practical utility.

[4600-4711]
Structural function: This section establishes the interrelationship between the three postures and their prognostic significance. The structural arrangement presents each posture as a "sign" indicating future liberation: the nirmāṇakāya ṛṣi posture signifying liberation through austerity in future times, the saṃbhogakāya elephant posture signifying effortless spontaneous liberation, the dharmakāya lion posture signifying genuine fearless liberation. This establishes the postures not merely as meditation supports but as indicators of realization trajectory.

[4600-4741]
View register: The perspective here presents the three postures as the natural expression of the three kāyas already present within the practitioner. The view that the three kāyas abide in the heart while posture brings them forth establishes the non-dual relationship between physical expression and innate realization. This perspective dissolves the duality between practice and result: the postures are not merely causes of future kāyas but expressions of kāyas already present. The recognition that one's own posture becomes the three-kāya posture captures this essential view.

[4600-4771]
Preservation note: The connection between bodily elements and appropriate postures—cold constitution suiting nirmāṇakāya, hot constitution dharmakāya, balanced saṃbhogakāya—establishes individualized practice recommendations based on elemental constitution. This traditional medical-physiological framework requires preservation for its practical application. The concluding emphasis on posture as essential for the arising of wisdom appearance establishes the foundational importance of physical alignment in meditation practice.

[4600-4801]
Structural function: This section addresses the question of why only three postures are definitively established, presenting the three postures as the complete system for liberation from the three poisons and the three doors. The structural arrangement establishes the correspondence: three poisons (desire, hatred, ignorance) bind beings to three realms, three postures liberate them; three poisons mature into body, speech, and mind, three postures purify them. This systematic correspondence demonstrates the completeness of the threefold system.

[4600-4831]
View register: The perspective here presents the three postures as the complete method for liberation from cyclic existence. The view that three are definitively established while more are unnecessary and fewer are incomplete establishes the sufficiency of this system. The correspondence between the three poisons, the three doors, and the three postures demonstrates the systematic nature of the path. This view establishes confidence in the completeness of the method without requiring additional elaboration.

[4600-4861]
Translation risk: The presentation of the three poisons maturing into specific body types—with desire maturing into bird-body with emphasis on speech, ignorance into pig-body with emphasis on mind, hatred into snake-body with emphasis on physical action—represents traditional Buddhist physiological psychology. This framework establishes the basis for individualized posture recommendations: bird-nature practitioners benefit from saṃbhogakāya posture, pig-nature from dharmakāya, snake-nature from nirmāṇakāya. These correspondences require precise preservation for their practical application in matching practice to constitution.

[4600-4901]
Structural function: This section concludes the three-kāya posture presentation with the definitive statement that three are definitively established and no more are needed. The structural arrangement reinforces the completeness of the system: the three poisons bind to three realms, three postures liberate; three doors express bondage, three postures express freedom. This systematic presentation establishes confidence in the method and provides clear guidance for practice selection based on individual characteristics.

[4600-4951]
View register: The perspective here presents the definitive nature of the threefold system as the complete expression of liberation from cyclic existence. The view that the three postures exhaust the possibilities for liberation establishes their sufficiency. The recognition that the three doors of body, speech, and mind are purified through the three postures demonstrates the comprehensive scope of the practice. This view enables practitioners to engage with the system confidently, knowing that the appropriate posture for their constitution provides complete support for realization.
