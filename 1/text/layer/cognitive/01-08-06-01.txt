Eighth ground dispute response. Objection: ka dag and lhun grub non-duality leads to eighth ground consequence. Response: one recognizes non-dual (dbyer med), therefore no wish to turn away from seven aspects. No fault. One's own face primordially pure—no contradiction. Recognizing essence as primordially pure establishes connection.

Second dispute: primordial purity and spontaneous presence non-dual in one's own face. New objection targeting non-duality itself.
