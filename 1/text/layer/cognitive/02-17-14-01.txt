Royal caste empowerment analogy. First simile: spyi bo nas dbang bskur—head empowerment conferring royal status. Rig pa rang sa zin—rigpa taking its own place—as parallel to king taking throne. Key point: chos nyid las mi 'gyur—unchanging from dharmatā. The analogy establishes self-recognition as enthronement without alteration of nature. Translation risk: literal rendering may suggest achievement rather than recognition of primordial status. Preserve the taking-place metaphor as self-existing, not accomplished.

Three royal analogies sequential. Second: king's army to frontier, king-subject circle changes without fixed location. Sgo lnga'i rnam shes—five gate consciousnesses—dawning while ground empty. Samsara nameless because ground empty of inherent existence. Third: minister captured by foreign king, original king must listen to other's commands. Yi kyi rnam par shes pa—mental consciousness continuum—ceasing. Rig pa obtains rang dbang—self-power/autonomy. Structure traces progressive release from conditioned consciousness to self-existing awareness.

Fruit irreversibility. 'Bras bu rgyur mi ldog—fruit non-returning to cause—like sandalwood fruit. Rtsol bas byas pa—effort-made arisen—negated. Ye nas de ltar gnas—primordially thus abiding. Tha snyad—mere designation—applied to 'bras bu. This is crucial Dzogchen point: fruition is recognition, not production. Translation must preserve the negative formulation: not like effort-result, rather primordial thusness arriving at what was already the case.

Each dawns from sems nyid—mind itself—and purifies rang sar—at its own place. Structure demonstrates all aggregates, elements, and afflictions as self-purifying when recognized as sems nyid display.
