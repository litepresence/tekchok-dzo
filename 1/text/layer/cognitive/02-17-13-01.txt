Threefold view recognition progresses from outer to inner to secret. Outer recognition perceives phenomena lacking self-nature through the vajra eye of discriminating wisdom. Inner recognition perceives dharmatā lacking self-nature through the eye of pristine awareness. Secret recognition perceives the non-duality of expanse and rigpa. This structure moves from conventional appearance to ultimate recognition, addressing progressively subtler dimensions of fixation.

[24158-24169]
Outer view examines phenomena as appearance without inherent existence. The eight similes of illusion—dream, magical illusion, mirage, echo, reflection, city of gandharvas, optical illusion, and water-moon—dissolve reification that generates cyclic existence. No doubt remains about returning to the three realms when the empty nature of phenomena is fully recognized. This confidence emerges naturally from seeing through the apparent solidity of experience.

[24170-24189]
Inner view recognizes dharmatā through the wisdom eye. The nature of mind is unborn and self-arisen; self-awareness lacks even the mind that grasps. This recognition transcends effort and achievement, existing beyond the duality of doing and done. The Self-Arisen citations describe this as great meditation—rigpa that does not fall into any partiality, beyond acceptance and rejection, affirmation and denial.

[24190-24213]
Secret view recognizes expanse and rigpa as non-dual. This transcends the subject-object duality that structures outer and inner views. The liberating function is described as "cutting the continuum of the city"—interrupting the cyclic flow of existence from womb to womb, preventing return to the three realms. From this recognition, buddhahood can be achieved in this very lifetime without further rebirth.

[24214-24241]
Scriptural citations from Sun-Moon Union and Self-Arisen establish authoritative basis for these recognitions. Graduated capacities determine results: the superior practitioner achieves without passing through the two births (ordinary birth and bardo birth), the intermediate practitioner achieves in the bardo state, and the lesser practitioner achieves at exhalation of the final breath. These distinctions reflect preparation levels rather than fundamental differences in potential.

The mountain peak settling method (ri bo cog gzhag) demonstrates how comprehensive view encompasses all vehicle intentions. From the summit, all valleys are simultaneously visible; from below the summit, the summit itself remains unseen. Dzogchen operates as the summit of all paths—the nine yānas are recognized within its system, while other systems cannot fully comprehend its intention. This is not superiority in a competitive sense but completeness of perspective.

[24268-24277]
The view encompasses all nine yānas, recognizing their intentions as aspects of its own complete understanding. The three realms are completely liberated into great purity—nothing exists outside recognition, no realm remains to be purified. This is not achieved through effort but recognized as always already the case. The practitioner who recognizes this finds nothing unliberated, no bondage to escape, no liberation to achieve.

[24277-24293]
The intention of view manifests as great liberation of the three realms. For the recognizing yogin, nothing remains unliberated—all has transcended the duality of bondage and liberation from the very beginning. This fruition is recognition of what always was, not attainment of something new. The Six Expanses citations describe appearances as baseless self-arisen great expanse display—like dreams, illusions, and sky. Equal purity pervades all phenomena.

[24277-24319]
Six Expanses passages elaborate this recognition: mind without arising or feeling, appearance without superior contemplation, consciousness without going or coming; mind without grasping, appearance as pure unceasing display, great play as samadhi; mind without fixation, self-arisen great appearance, non-ceasing non-conceptual intention; mind without affliction, appearance free of self-concept, great settling intention; mind without eternalism or nihilism, appearance free of good and bad, intention free of acceptance and rejection; mind without adopting or rejecting, appearance as directionless self-liberation, vast pervasion intention.

[24277-24344]
Result of view manifests as afflictions settled in their place without abandonment or transformation. This spontaneous liberation operates like clouds clearing in the sky or silt settling in water—the natural resolution of disturbance without deliberate intervention. Three temporal dimensions describe this: initially confusion is not experienced as substantial, presently confusion is not abided in as a state, finally confusion becomes impossible as a basis has been thoroughly recognized.

[24277-24369]
The person who has abandoned dharmas has not rejected phenomena but transcended fixation upon them. This completes the fourfold structure: view, essential point, intention, and result. View transforms experience directly rather than merely providing philosophical understanding. The Dzogchen practitioner does not accumulate new knowledge but recognizes the nature of what already is—afflictions as wisdom, confusion as clarity, cyclic existence as transcendence.

[24277-24394]
The final sections describe fruition through recognition. Virtue and vice, acceptance and rejection, effort and achievement—all dissolve into the single sphere of awareness. The practitioner who recognizes this does not become something other than what they were but realizes what they always were. This recognition is not an event in time but the timeless nature of awareness itself, suddenly and completely revealed.
