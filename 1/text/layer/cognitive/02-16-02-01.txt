This section establishes the essence of Nirmāṇakāya through activity-based definition rather than being-based definition, completing the triadic structure of the three kayas. Where Dharmakāya is established through being and Saṃbhogakāya through display, Nirmāṇakāya shifts to activity-register, marking the completion of the kaya exposition. The structural function is to demonstrate how form-body activity flows naturally from the prior establishment of truth-body and enjoyment-body. The eightfold etymology, each introduced by yang and concluding with sprul pa'i sku'o, establishes comprehensive semantic coverage without hierarchical ranking: appearing harmoniously to world-realm beings, being capable of benefit-activity, performing all activities, liberating countless beings, remaining briefly in a single realm, compassion arising without direction, being fierce and wrathful, being peaceful and certain, being seen as beautiful by beings. The preservation requirement is to recognize each definition's distinct contribution to the semantic field rather than flattening the structure into mere enumeration.

[1035-1041]
The characteristic section establishes benefit-accomplishment as the defining function of emanation-kāya. Through the verse citation sprul pa sku yi mtshan nyid ni, bya ba rdzogs par bya ba byed, rnam pa gnyis su 'dod pa'o, the twofold structure is confirmed: completing activities and performing activities. The structural logic maintains internal coherence with the essence-definition while adding the specific function that distinguishes emanation from the other two kayas. The preservation concern involves maintaining the technical precision of "benefit" terminology without collapsing it into general compassionate activity.

[1042-1062]
The division section maps the two types of emanation-kāya onto self-benefit and other-benefit, though the terminology avoids explicit subject-object dualism. Bya ba rdzogs pa'i sprul sku and bya ba byed pa'i sprul sku correspond to the completion of one's own activities and the performance of activities for others. The self-benefit exposition presents the subtle-body completion process through the gateway of spontaneous presence in self-appearance, either during this life or in the intermediate state. The structural insight that rang snang gi 'khor ba stongs dgos establishes the necessity of dissolving deluded appearance—the appearance of saṃsāra in self-appearance must be emptied. The preservation requirement is to maintain the technical specificity of sgo rdzogs as dimensional completion, not merely "gateway" in the ordinary sense.

[1063-1070]
The completion of self-benefit emanation establishes the sequence: first self-liberation through recognizing own-face, then emanation unfolds. The verse citation from Rangshar provides authoritative grounding: bya ba rdzogs pa'i sprul sku ni, rang gi rgyud 'grol mngon sangs rgyas, de nas sprul pa 'gyed pa'o. The emanation-unfolding method is described through the subtle-body geography of the intermediate state—when the eightfold gate of spontaneous presence is complete, recognition of own-face liberates, and from the impure gate of saṃsāra, one enters as light-radiation into the appropriate wombs, appearing to teach and liberate. The structural function is to establish the precise mechanics of post-liberation activity without falling into eternalist or nihilist extremes. The dream metaphor illustrates how all appearances remain within self-appearance alone.

[1071-1100]
The activity-performing emanation-kāya exposition maps emanation activity onto comprehensive pedagogical responsiveness through four individual correct knowledges: knowing all languages individually, knowing faculties and latent tendencies, teaching in harmony with thoughts, and adapting to vehicles great and small, diverse and secret mantra. The structural density establishes how form-body activity manifests as complete pedagogical accommodation. The diversity of teaching methods includes generation and completion phases, singular and multiple approaches, mind and pristine awareness, ālaya and ālaya-as-dharmakāya. The extensive verse quotation from Rangshar establishes teaching diversity while maintaining single intent: thams cad skad ni shes pa ste through la lar dbyings dang ye shes ston. The preservation requirement is to recognize the single-wisdom multiple-expression structure rather than reading the variety as contradiction.

[1101-1148]
The detailed exposition of teaching methods continues with specific pedagogical approaches: demonstrating awareness as empty, demonstrating non-aware emptiness, demonstrating awareness as material, demonstrating awareness alone, demonstrating ālaya as dharmakāya, demonstrating virtue and non-virtue as nonexistent, demonstrating with meditation, demonstrating without meditation. The structural function is to establish comprehensive pedagogical responsiveness while maintaining single wisdom-source. The closing verses establish the rarity and secrecy of the Dzogchen teaching: the highest unexcelled secret mantra is not spoken to everyone, and when spoken, even śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas within the lower vehicle hear the unsurpassed vehicle proclaimed. The structural authority of the text is established through this exclusivity claim, marking the teaching as distinct from general vehicles.

[1149-1157]
The rarity assertion marks the teaching as distinct from general vehicles through the lineage of mind-treasure and oral instruction. The Snyingthig teaching is established as extremely rare—arising only through the great path of existence, not otherwise. The comparison to precious gems establishes fourfold value: rarity of arising, freedom from defilement, possession of power, becoming ornament of the world. The structural pattern maintains source authority through citation of Uttaratantra while establishing the teaching's distinctiveness. The closing affirmation establishes the instruction to treasure the teaching as one would a wish-fulfilling jewel.

[1158-1176]
The examination method section presents six criteria for recognizing authentic emanation: at the time of passing away, gaze not wandering elsewhere; on the crown of the head, one hair curl swirling to the right; at the heart, vajra-form present; birth in royal caste or high family; conduct in harmony with whatever is appropriate; whatever is spoken, following that. Additional criteria include not establishing one's own desires, effort and grasping naturally absent, and opening the door of whatever beings desire. The structural function is to establish recognition-criteria for authentic emanation. The final note that these signs indicate emanation but do not definitively establish authenticity requires careful translation to preserve the epistemic nuance. The closing returns to recognition-practice connection: pure bodhicitta, taming one's own continuum.

[1177-1181]
The transition to five-kāya enumeration establishes the systematic correspondence structure. The five aspects—essence, etymology, appearance, division, and application—mirror the three-kāya exposition structure while adding specificity through numerical correspondence. This section functions as architectural announcement, preparing the reader for comprehensive fivefold mapping. The structural continuity from three kayas to five kayas maintains the systematic exposition while increasing granularity. The preservation requirement is to recognize the integrative logic that binds five into seamless display rather than reading the enumeration as merely additive.
