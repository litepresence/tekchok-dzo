[3354-3389]
Structural function: This section establishes the foundational training for bardo recognition through the union of daytime practice and dream-state familiarity. The text presents a graduated approach where practitioners first stabilize recognition of the illusory body and clear light during waking hours, then extend this recognition into the dream state. This methodological progression serves as the preliminary groundwork for the actual bardo instructions that follow. The arrangement reflects the standard Dzogchen pedagogical structure: establishing the view through daily practice before addressing the intermediate state.

[3389-3432]
Structural function: The second major section addresses the actual bardo instructions proper, presenting the dissolution sequence of elements at death. This follows the standard progression from preliminary training to direct application. The text describes the sequential dissolution of earth into water, water into fire, fire into wind, wind into space, and finally space into clear light, culminating in the recognition of the four wisdoms. This structural arrangement mirrors the universal Buddhist presentation of the death process while incorporating Dzogchen-specific recognitions of the clear light mother-and-child union.

[3432-3516]
Structural function: The third major section turns to the Sugata intention meditation, presenting the ocean-settling method as the culmination of meditation practice. This section establishes the framework for continuous practice without distinction between day and night. The structural progression moves from the metaphorical basis (ocean eye water essence), through the method (unblinking gaze), to the result (six sense-fields liberated into vastness). This arrangement serves as the practical application manual for the view previously established.

[3517-3574]
Structural function: This section presents the result of the Sugata intention meditation: the arising of dharmatā as the ground-settled view. The structural arrangement presents the fruition as the spontaneous liberation of afflictions into pristine wisdom. This represents the completion phase of the meditation framework, demonstrating how the practice matures into recognition. The multiple quotations from the Six Expanses establish the textual foundation for this spontaneous liberation view.

[3575-3599]
Structural function: The fourth major section addresses the view of cutting the continuum of the city, establishing the recognition of one's own view as the foundation for continuous practice. This section presents four subdivisions: the view itself, its essential point instruction, its intention, and its result. This fourfold structure provides a comprehensive framework for view recognition that can be applied throughout all activities. The progression from view to result establishes the complete path within this single recognition.

[3599-3616]
View register: The perspective here presents the threefold recognition: outer phenomena as appearance without self-nature (seen through the vajra eye), inner dharmatā as absence of self-nature (seen through the wisdom eye), and secret rigpa as non-duality of expanse and rigpa. This threefold schema encompasses the complete Dzogchen view—from the conventional appearance of phenomena to the ultimate recognition of non-dual awareness. The metaphor of the mountain peak view captures the comprehensive scope: from the summit, all lower valleys are visible simultaneously, while from below, the summit remains unseen.

[3599-3693]
Translation risk: The term "secret rigpa" here refers to the non-dual recognition of expanse and awareness, not to any hidden or esoteric teaching. This technical usage requires precise rendering to avoid misinterpretation as referring to concealed instruction. The threefold liberation outcomes—superior practitioners achieving buddhahood in this life, intermediate in the bardo, last as natural emanation bodies—represent a standard soteriological framework in Dzogchen literature. These categories establish a graduated path while maintaining the view that all are equally expressions of natural liberation.

[3599-3765]
Structural function: This section presents the essential point instruction of the mountain peak settling method, demonstrating how the comprehensive view enables simultaneous recognition of all vehicle intentions. The structural arrangement establishes the practitioner as one who sees all from the peak while others cannot see this perspective. This metaphor captures the Dzogchen self-understanding as the summit of all paths. The subsequent presentation of the great liberation of the three realms establishes the scope of this recognition.

[3599-3852]
View register: The perspective here presents the spontaneous liberation of afflictions without abandonment or transformation. This "afflictions settled in their place" view represents the Dzogchen approach to emotional transformation—not through suppression or transformation, but through recognition of their empty nature. The multiple quotations from the Six Expanses enumerate how various afflictions and perceptions self-liberate when recognized as mind's display. This establishes the non-dual ethics of the tradition where conventional distinctions dissolve into natural purity.

[3599-3901]
Preservation note: The catalog of self-liberating phenomena—desire, hatred, ignorance, and the various sense objects—follows traditional Buddhist enumerative structures. These lists serve as meditation supports and recognition frameworks, requiring preservation of their comprehensive scope. The concluding identification of this as "the person who has abandoned dharmas" refers not to nihilistic rejection but to the transcendence of fixation that characterizes complete recognition.
