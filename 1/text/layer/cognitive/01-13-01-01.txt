[16025-16273]
The exposition on the Four Lamps (sgron ma bzhi) establishes the culminating subtle body phenomenology of the Treasury system, presenting the wisdom-vision that transcends ordinary perception through four distinct yet interrelated modes of empty-luminous appearance. This section operates at the pinnacle of the Treasury's contemplative technology, providing the practical coordinates for recognizing the pure appearance that underlies all experience.

Structural analysis of lines 16025-16273 reveals a comprehensive exposition establishing the Four Lamps' distinctions, interrelationships, and progressive recognition. The opening frame distinguishes karma-wind's pure part from wisdom-wind's portion, with the far-casting noose (rgyang zhags) as support. When wisdom-wind acts upon elements, virtue arises. Four arise from support: mountains, houses, and other great appearances manifesting as the subtle part of wind's essence—this demonstrates how ordinary perception contains the seeds of transcendent vision.

Critical philosophical distinction (lines 16038-16042): The Four Lamps are distinguished from saṃsāra's deluded appearance ('khor ba'i 'khrul snang) and deluded mind ('khrul sems). They represent the transcended part holding ('das pa'i cha 'dzin pa). This vital point (gnad 'di gal po che) marks the crucial dividing line between ordinary cognition and wisdom recognition. The text explicitly warns: from this point forward, if one knows the distinction between these two, one should recognize it as the author's vital point. This represents the hermeneutical key for the entire Four Lamps presentation.

Technical exposition of the Four Lamps:

1. Bindu Empty Lamp (thig le stong pa'i sgron ma): Round bindu possessing five light-rims ('od lnga'i mu khyud can), arising from karma-wind's pure part. This lamp represents the bindu's empty nature—while appearing as light, it lacks inherent existence. Round light five-rim-possessing indicates the mandalic structure of bindu appearance.

2. Wisdom Self-Arising Lamp (shes rab rang byung gi sgron ma): Arising from the Space Completely-Pure Lamp, possessing three aspects—wisdom essence (ngo bo), potential (rtsal), and tone (gdangs). Essence: when applied to the Bindu Empty Lamp through the vital-point of far-casting gaze, inner awareness experiences pure self-clearly. Potential: outward-clear object-knowledge sharp and quick, words and meanings filling the expanse. Tone: vajra-chain appearance like gold cord hung. These three—essence, potential, and tone—constitute the complete wisdom self-arising when not separated.

3. Space Completely-Pure Lamp (dbyings rnam dag gi sgron ma): Possessing outer and inner aspects. Outer sky cloud-free holds; inner space lamp pure. The distinction between outer and inner space represents a crucial technical point. Outer sky appears cloudless, but lamp-person connection is not established—mere empty space lacks the vital connection to the practitioner. Inner sky's blue tone arises outward, called outer space—this opens the basis ground, but from space itself is not actual space. Actual space is dark-blue (mthing ga), inner space. Thus appearance arises—outer/inner space distinction like rainbow-light's load in a house, clarifying the unclear, merely transferring understanding.

Technical precision on space distinction: Some incorrectly identify mere cloudless outer sky as the Space Lamp. This is extremely improper because sky's connection to the person is not established, while the lamp follows the person's existence or non-existence. Here, inner sky's blue tone arising outward is called outer space. That opens sky's understanding, the basis ground mere from space, actual space not. This demonstrates the Treasury's critique of superficial interpretations that mistake external appearances for the actual inner luminosity.

The etymological analysis continues: Light five clear also mind's self-essence clear-light self-tone arises. From that itself, object's stains and intellect discriminating wisdom's stains, wrong-thought mind's stains—completely pure. The lamp: when that appearance is seen, from the aspect of dispelling action and latency's darkness, it is called lamp. This establishes the soteriological function of the lamps—not merely perceptual phenomena but active agents of purification.

The generation process (lines 16084-16089): The first of Four Lamps gathers as essence in the four wheels. Initially, wind propels upward to mother's womb—hence called "far" (rgyang), showing from far the cause-conditional essence entering mother's womb center. Mindfulness, wind-mind, cause-conditional together four gather. Bound by noose—hence called noose (zhags). In flavors, six bliss tastes increase, essence-eye expand—hence called water. At the tip, sense-faculties' action distinctions and five wisdoms' distinctions realize, dharmata sense-faculties' object actually dawns—hence called lamp, dispelling saṃsāra's darkness.

Detailed etymological analysis of Bindu Empty Lamp (lines 16090-16104): When compared to relative causal bindu: "Thig" means posture essence lowering; "le" means speech HUM etc. secretly holding, wisdom identifying; "stong pa" means empty bindu reversing potential bestowing, wind mixing, bliss-emptiness meditating; "sgron ma" means by that meaning dispelling darkness. When compared to ultimate wisdom bindu: bindu means gaze's posture, wisdom threefold unchanging; "le" means appearance light rim round; "stong pa" means that appearance not established as thing and characteristic, four-elements harm not; self-appearance, shown yet other not see; clear-light elaboration-extreme free, ignorance darkness clear. Lamp: dispelling saṃsāra's darkness.

The comprehensive system: Lamp four path appearance four sign measure determine. The four signs: bindu empty lamp, wisdom self-arising lamp, sphere completely-pure lamp, far-casting water lamp. The nine aspects for each: essence, definition, classification, characteristic, abode, arising manner, arising door, appearance, simile, definite measure. This establishes the complete analytical framework for each lamp, demonstrating the Treasury's systematic approach to contemplative phenomenology.

Structural function: This section introduces the Four Lamps as the culmination of subtle body practice, distinguishing them from ordinary perception through the vital recognition of empty-luminous appearance. The progression from karma-wind's pure part through the four lamps demonstrates the transformation of ordinary perception into wisdom vision. The detailed etymological analysis—breaking down each term into its constituent wisdom-qualities—provides the hermeneutical method for recognizing primordial wisdom in direct experience.

Preservation note: Technical terminology requires careful handling—Four Lamps (sgron ma bzhi), far-casting noose (rgyang zhags), bindu (thig le), wisdom self-arising (shes rab rang byung), space completely-pure (dbyings rnam dag). The three aspects of wisdom (ngo bo, rtsal, gdangs) represent the standard triadic structure of Dzogchen phenomenology. The distinction between outer and inner space marks a critical technical point that determines correct practice.

Risk acknowledgment: The Four Lamps presentation involves subtle distinctions between ordinary perception and wisdom vision that may be conflated in translation. The text's explicit warning about recognizing the vital point between saṃsāra's deluded appearance and the transcended part indicates the precision required. The spatial metaphors (inner/outer space) should not be interpreted as literal physical locations but as phenomenological coordinates within the subtle body system.

The Four Lamps exposition establishes the Treasury as a complete presentation of the Great Perfection's subtle body technology, moving from coarse anatomical structures through energetic channels to the finest phenomenology of empty-luminous appearance. Each lamp represents a specific mode of recognition, with the four together constituting the complete field of primordial wisdom's self-manifestation.

Extended analysis of sgron ma bzhi technical implementation in practice. The four lamps manifest progressively as practitioner stabilizes recognition. Initially, distance-snare appears as subtle visionary capacity—distant objects perceived with unusual clarity. Bindu empty lamp emerges as round light forms with five-color rims, appearing in visual field during meditation. Wisdom self-arising lamp manifests as spontaneous knowing without conceptual process. Space completely-pure lamp dawns as perception of inner space as luminous clarity. Each lamp marks advancement in subtle body transformation.

Detailed examination of karma-wind and wisdom-wind distinction. Karma-wind carries karmic imprints producing ordinary perception. When purified through practice, wisdom-wind emerges revealing pure appearance. Distance-snare arises from this purification process—wind's subtle aspect producing visionary capacity. Four elements purified produce four lamps: earth produces solidity of vision, water fluidity, fire luminosity, air movement. This elemental alchemy transforms ordinary perception into wisdom vision through systematic purification.

Comprehensive analysis of nang gsum phyi gsum—inner three outer three—structure. Outer corresponds to conventional perception; inner to visionary appearance; secret to emptiness-luminosity union; innermost unconcealed to spontaneous perfection. Four lamps operate across these dimensions: distance-snare in outer, bindu in inner, wisdom in secret, space in innermost. Progressive recognition through these stages marks path of thögal direct transcendence.

Extended preservation requirements for subtle body terminology. Rlung—wind, prana, vital energy—requires distinction from ordinary breath. Rtsa—channel, nadi—subtle energetic pathways distinct from physical nerves. Thig le—bindu, drop—energetic essence distinct from physical substance. Gdangs—tone, luminosity—appearance aspect of awareness. Rtsal—potential, dynamic capacity—function aspect. Ngo bo—essence, nature—being aspect. These three—essence, nature, capacity—constitute fundamental triad of Dzogchen phenomenology.

[17101-16273]
Final comprehensive analysis of Four Lamps as complete path. Distance-snare establishes visionary foundation; bindu empty lamp provides focal point; wisdom self-arising lamp enables recognition; space completely-pure lamp completes integration. Together they constitute thögal practice leading to rainbow body. Each lamp contains all four through fractal structure: distance-snare has bindu within, bindu has wisdom, wisdom has space, space contains all. This holographic structure demonstrates Dzogchen's non-dual topology.
