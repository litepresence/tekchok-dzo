[685-704]
Structural opening through the threefold completion framework: rdzogs, sangs, rgyas pa. The text establishes its own architectural logic before unfolding kaya exposition. This is not a casual introduction but a formal scoping declaration. The progression from gzhi shar through sku gsum dag pa'i snang ba establishes the ground-display-recognition structure that will organize the entire section. Each term here seeds technical vocabulary that will recur throughout the chapter. The verse quotations from rang shar establish the self-arising register immediately, signaling this is Dzogchen exposition, not graduated path. Translation must preserve the formal weight of this structural announcement. The threefold structure establishes a rhythm that will carry through the entire kaya presentation.

[705-713]
Awakening section presents sixfold clearing through absence: bya ba med pas, rtog pa med pas, 'dzin pa med pas, zhen pa med pas, chags pa med pas. The pattern is consistent—each obscuration dissolves through recognition of its non-existence. The structural repetition serves rhythmic function, not mere enumeration. The view register remains non-assertive throughout; this is description of what is already the case, not prescription of what should be cultivated. The verse citation establishes sangs as clearing through absence, a technical Dzogchen usage distinct from ordinary "purification." Risk: translating med pas as "without" flattens the recognition-dynamic into mere negation. Preservation requires maintaining the liberative force of each absence-statement.

[714-727]
Expansion section mirrors the completion structure but shifts register to yon tan, establishing qualities as spontaneously present rather than achieved. The fivefold pattern—'od lnga gsal bas ye shes rgyas through don ldan rang snang 'bras bu rgyas—maps onto the five wisdoms implicitly. The verse quotations maintain the rang shar citation pattern, grounding the exposition in revealed source-text. Structural function: establishing that kayas are not produced but recognized as already-complete. The phrase sku gsum rgyas lugs de bzhin no functions as refrain, creating textual rhythm. Risk: rgyas as expansion must not be read as quantitative increase but as qualitative fullness-disclosure.

[728-748]
Transition to dharmakāya exposition through gnas rgyas par bshad pa. The ten-aspect structure—ngo bo, nges tshig, rang lus, mtshon dpe, rtags, snang ba, gnas, mtshan nyid, yul, dgongs pa—establishes systematic philosophical definition. This is analytical register, distinct from the preceding verse-based presentation. The text now moves from poetic to taxonomic mode without abandoning Dzogchen view. Risk: over-systematization in translation could obscure the non-dual ground. The ngo bo definition through stong gsal 'gag med rang dangs preserves the inseparability of emptiness-clarity-noncessation. The threefold compound requires recognition of each element's distinct contribution to the unified definition.

[749-762]
Etymological exposition of dharmakāya through nges tshig. The definition weaves multiple semantic threads: dbyings ye dag lhun gyis grub pa'i chos nyid 'od gsal ba'i sku yin pas ngo bo ka dag mi 'gyur ba 'khrul med kyi chos. The compound structure requires careful parsing—each element qualifies the next in nested fashion. The verse citation from rang shar maintains source authority. Rang lus exposition through spros pa'i mtha' thams cad dang bral bas establishes freedom from elaboration as the defining characteristic. This is not mere absence of concepts but freedom from all limiting extremes. Risk: spros pa'i mtha' as elaboration-extremes must be preserved in its technical philosophical sense.

[763-789]
Metaphor section establishes six comparisons: nyi ma, rgya mtsho, padma, ri bo, nam mkha', seng ge. Each maps a specific quality of dharmakāya onto natural phenomena through rig pa 'od gsal ba. The structural pattern is consistent: quality identified, metaphor named, verse citation from rang shar confirming the correspondence. The rtags exposition through 'gro 'ong las 'das pa establishes transcendence of movement as the sign of dharmakāya. Snang ba through stong gsal nam mkha'i dbyings lta bu preserves the sky-as-clarity metaphor that pervades Dzogchen literature. Risk: the metaphorical correspondences must not be read as decorative but as ontological mappings that preserve specific qualities.

[790-823]
Characteristic, object, and intent sections complete the dharmakāya exposition. Mtshan nyid through ngo bo rang bzhin thugs rje gsum dbyer med pa establishes the threefold unity that defines dharmakāya as distinct from mere emptiness. Yul exposition through stong pa phyang ma chad pas rig pa rang gsal preserves the subtle point that dharmakāya is not nihilistic void but self-lucid awareness. The dgongs pa section presents the view-meditation-conduct-fruition-activity framework in concentrated form, each line a complete statement of one aspect. The structural density here requires recognition of each element's independent weight. The verse quotations maintain the consistent rang shar source pattern.

[824-858]
saṃbhogakāya exposition begins through five-aspect structure: ngo bo, nges tshig, mtshan nyid, snang lugs, gnas lugs. The shift from dharmakāya's ten aspects to five marks the transition from absolute to relative display. Ngo bo presents extensive enumeration through lnga pattern: yab lnga, yul lnga, tshom bu lnga, ye lnga, shes lnga, rtogs pa lnga, gzhi lnga, lam lnga, 'bras bu lnga, gnas lnga, yul lnga, ngo bo lnga. This is complete fivefold mapping, establishing the tantric correspondence structure. Risk: translation must preserve the enumerative precision without collapsing the distinctions. Each fivefold category requires recognition of its distinct function within the systematic presentation.

[859-933]
Detailed exposition of each fivefold category. The father-mother correspondence establishes the yab-yum dyad as central organizing principle. Yab lnga—rnam snang, mi bskyod, rin 'byung, 'od dpag med, don grub—maps onto the five dhyani Buddhas. Yum lnga—nam mkha' dbyings phyug ma, sangs rgyas spyan, ma ma ki, gos dkar mo, dam tshig sgrol ma—maps onto the five consorts. Tshom bu lnga as mi bskyod la sogs pa lnga la lnga lnga bs kor ba'i mtha' 'od lnga'i mu khyud kyis mdzes pa preserves the mandala architecture. The ye lnga, shes lnga, rtogs pa lnga establish recognition-gradations within spontaneous presence. The gzhi lnga, lam lnga, 'bras bu lnga map the path-framework onto fivefold structure. The gnas lnga locate the kayas in subtle body geography: thig le'i gnas, ye shes kyi gnas, sgron ma'i gnas, dbyings snang gi gnas, grol sa'i gnas. Technical precision essential throughout.

[934-977]
Etymology and characteristic sections. The nges tshig exposition through yon tan du longs pa, 'od gsal dag pa la spyod pa, don gnyis lhun gyis rdzogs pa, ye shes tshad du phyin pa, mtshan dpe 'od zer snang ba'i sku establishes five semantic grounds for the term longs spyod rdzogs pa'i sku. The verse section presents extensive self-qualification through longs and spyod as separate semantic elements. The structural pattern is consistent: each semantic element is elaborated through multiple verse lines establishing its specific contribution. Mtshan nyid through rigs lnga so so'i dkyil 'khor ma 'dres gdangs gsal ba establishes the distinct-display quality of saṃbhogakāya. Risk: translation must preserve the differentiation that defines saṃbhogakāya against dharmakāya's unity.

[978-1014]
Appearance and abiding manner sections. Snang lugs through rang bzhin rig pa gcig las establishes the single-nature dual-appearance structure. The verse citation rigs gnyis nang dang phyi snang ba'i tshul preserves the inner-outer distinction within non-dual ground. Gnas lugs presents four characteristics: spang blang med pa'i dbyings, gnyis su med pa'i mkha', 'od lnga rdzogs pa'i klong, sprul pa 'phro ba'i ring bzhin chen po. The extensive verse quotation establishes the emanation-radiating continuity. This section marks the transition from saṃbhogakāya's static display to dynamic manifestation. Risk: the gnas lugs as abiding-manner must be preserved as description of spontaneous presence, not location in space.

[1015-1020]
Nirmāṇakāya introduction. The five-aspect structure—ngo bo, nges tshig, mtshan nyid, dbye ba, brtag thabs—mirrors saṃbhogakāya's framework but shifts to activity-oriented exposition. The structural function is completing the three-kaya presentation through the emanation dimension. The source contains significant gaps indicated by placeholder markers and verse fragments. These gaps require preservation in translation notation. The transition from saṃbhogakāya's display-mode to Nirmāṇakāya's activity-mode marks the completion of the kaya-triad exposition. Risk: the fragmented nature of the source must not be smoothed over; preservation requires marking lacunae explicitly.
