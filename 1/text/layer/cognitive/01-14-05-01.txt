[18610-18640]
Thal gyur citation opens the five wisdoms exposition. Appearing wisdom manifests from the five elements—earth, water, fire, wind, and space—while remaining essentially empty. Dharmadhatu wisdom cuts through the five sensory attachments. Bhagavan remains without contact, beyond grasping. This citation establishes the authoritative framework through root tantra. The structural function is to introduce the five-wisdom system with scriptural authority. Register: tantric technical precision. Structural function: establish authoritative source.

[18641-18700]
Five wisdoms detailed exposition follows systematic presentation. First, appearing wisdom manifests as the elemental display. Second, dharmadhatu wisdom cuts the gdar sha of three realms, ceasing five door objects. Third, mirror-like wisdom knows all without fixation, like a clear mirror. Fourth, discriminating wisdom knows distinctions in equality, like knowing medicines. Fifth, all-accomplishing wisdom benefits beings without concept, like a wish-fulfilling jewel. Each wisdom carries specific function, metaphor, and result. They are distinct yet unified, not interchangeable. Structural function: systematic curriculum presentation.

[18701-18760]
Individual wisdom characteristics demonstrate differentiated unity. Dharmadhatu wisdom establishes spaciousness—empty yet not nihilistic, appearance continuing yet not reified. Mirror-like wisdom establishes meditation—knowing without grasping, like mirror reflections appearing while mirror remains unchanged. Equality wisdom establishes experience—all phenomena equal in nature, good and bad same taste, pleasant and painful equal flavor. Discriminating wisdom establishes knowledge—knowing distinctions without confusion, phenomena distinctly known, nature equally empty. All-accomplishing wisdom establishes activity—benefiting beings without concept, effortless, spontaneous, continuous. Five together constitute complete path. Structural function: differentiated unity.

[18761-18820]
Tathagatagarbha exposition establishes Buddha-nature universality. Ground as sugatagarbha represents spontaneously present Buddha, great gnosis pervading all beings without addition or subtraction. Common scripture—Tathagatagarbha Sutra—establishes universality. Uncommon—Rangtog—offers tantric perspective. Definitive—Vajrasattva mirror tantra—provides highest authority. Scriptural hierarchy demonstrates hermeneutical inclusivity, not contradiction. Same meaning, different expressions, pedagogical skillfulness. All establish: all beings are Buddha. Structural function: hermeneutical inclusivity.

[18821-18880]
Buddha-nature remains hidden yet present. Like sesame oil pervading seed, like sugar in sugarcane, like gold in ore—present throughout yet not visible to ordinary perception. Covered by adventitious defilements, not absent. Example: sun behind clouds, not nonexistent, just hidden. Recognition reveals nature present, obscuration temporary. This concealment mechanism explains why Buddha-nature requires recognition rather than development. Structural function: concealment as temporary condition.

[18881-18940]
Four aspects of individual meaning divide into brief presentation and extensive explanation. Brief: ground as sugatagarbha, spontaneously present Buddha. Extensive: through three scripture types—common, uncommon, definitive—each establishing same point through different authority. This hermeneutical completeness ensures no perspective excluded. Brief presentation establishes essence; extensive explanation develops full implications. Structural function: hermeneutical completeness.

[18941-19000]
Detailed Tathagatagarbha Sutra citation confirms universality. All beings have Tathagatagarbha as it is. Rgyud bla ma citation: Buddha body pervades, suchness undifferentiated, gotra presence—all beings always possess Buddha-nature. Scriptural confirmation establishes definitive basis. The citations are not decorative but constitutive of the argument. Structural function: scriptural confirmation of universality.

[19001-19060]
Rangtog citation offers tantric perspective. Beings are Buddha, covered by adventitious stains. Doha citation: scholars explaining treatises fail to recognize Buddha in karma. This tantric authority complements sutra sources. The uncommon perspective emphasizes recognition over gradual development. All perspectives converge on same conclusion through different routes. Structural function: tantric authority complement.

[19061-19120]
Definitive Vajrasattva citation establishes highest authority. Tathagatagarbha pervades all world-beings like oil in sesame. Present in every being without exception. Supreme tantra source—Vajrasattva mirror tantra—provides definitive grounding. This hierarchy of sources—common, uncommon, definitive—demonstrates comprehensive authority coverage without privileging single perspective. Structural function: highest authority establishment.

[19121-19180]
Objection and response address natural doubt. If Buddha-nature present, why not visible? Response: body-appearance with light and adornments obscured—outside ordinary perception's range. Yet present now: example sun behind body-clouds. Inner introduction to essence occurs through signs: bindu, emptiness, lamp shown—confidence arises. Speech obscured by speech, mind obscured by mind—hence not seen by ordinary means. Structural function: address doubt through explanation.

[19181-19240]
Bardo recognition potential demonstrates practical application. Diligent persons meditating four visions to measure find them present now as they are. Bardo self-appearance pure as it is will temporarily appear after death. This establishes continuity between present practice and future recognition. The present condition contains the seed of future liberation. Structural function: bardo application continuity.

[19241-19300]
Present condition like garuda's folded wings—complete yet concealed. Covered by habitual tendency's expansion, not absent. Seng ge rtsal rdzogs citation: pure wisdom appearance dwells in beings' own body. Too vast to appear to limited perception. Example: womb and egg shell conceal maturation. When self-power completes, spontaneous emergence occurs. Development metaphor describes unveiling, not creation. Structural function: developmental metaphor.

[19301-19302]
Bardo recognition certainty establishes liberation mechanism. Discarding conceptual body, self-appearance meets object immediately. Naturally abiding self-knowing sees essence without concept. Pure wisdom appearance and Buddha truth seen. This recognition is not intellectual but direct, immediate, non-conceptual. The mechanics operate spontaneously when conditions align. Structural function: liberation mechanism.

[19302-19361]
Third topic: object wisdom. Forms and five objects self-liberated. Four visions' dharmata obtained increasing. Object-side wisdom demonstrates that liberation occurs through recognition of appearance, not rejection. Forms self-liberated, sounds self-liberated—all objects as dharmata's display. Not rejection but recognition. Not negation but transformation. Structural function: appearance integration.

[19302-19421]
Object wisdom detailed through advanced signs. Heat, peak, signs—true two united, concept's end exhausted. Actionless, characteristic-empty. Expression basis ceases, extreme not abiding. Flows exhausted, therefore without dust. Memory's source ceases, essence clear. Clear awareness object's extreme not conceptualized. Sound-free, true word-free, all supports exhausted. These signs indicate progress toward recognition. Structural function: advanced signs as progress indicators.

[19302-19481]
Four individual meanings complete. Brief and extensive both shown. Ground as Buddha-nature universally present. Five wisdoms systematically expounded. Object wisdom: appearances self-liberated. All topics covered comprehensively. Brief presentation establishes framework; extensive explanation develops details. Integration of all elements demonstrates systematic completeness. Structural function: section completion.

[19302-19541]
Five wisdoms as complete curriculum. Not partial teaching: full tantric path. Through recognition of five: complete liberation. Not sequential but simultaneous. Not gradual but instantaneous. Five together: complete path. Not separate: integrated whole. Wholeness emphasis prevents fragmentation of unified teaching. Structural function: wholeness emphasis.

[19302-19601]
Integration with three kayas establishes structural correspondence. dharmakāya: dharmadhatu wisdom. saṃbhogakāya: mirror-like and discriminating. nirmāṇakāya: all-accomplishing and appearing. This correlation demonstrates systematic integration across categories. Wisdoms and kayas mutually illuminate, creating coherent framework. Structural function: kaya correlation.

[19302-19661]
Integration with four kayas extends systematic coverage. Three plus svabhavikakaya: essence of all five. Not separate from three: their unity. Complete kaya system demonstrates comprehensive architecture. The four-kaya system accommodates additional dimension of essence body. Structural function: complete kaya system.

[19302-19721]
Five wisdoms and five elements establish elemental correspondence. Earth: dharmadhatu. Water: mirror-like. Fire: discriminating. Wind: all-accomplishing. Space: appearing. This correspondence integrates wisdom system with elemental cosmology. Elements serve as metaphors and correspondences, not reductions. Structural function: elemental correlation.

[19302-19781]
Five wisdoms and five Buddha families establish familial correspondence. Vairocana: dharmadhatu. Akshobhya: mirror-like. Amitabha: discriminating. Ratnasambhava: all-accomplishing. Amoghasiddhi: appearing. Buddha families provide additional organizational framework. Correspondences multiply without contradiction. Structural function: Buddha correlation.

[19302-19841]
Practical recognition instructions transform theory into practice. Not merely intellectual: direct recognition. Through meditation: wisdoms manifest. Through familiarity: stable recognition. Through stability: liberation. The progression moves from initial recognition to full actualization. Practice application demonstrates viability of theoretical framework. Structural function: practice application.

[19302-19901]
