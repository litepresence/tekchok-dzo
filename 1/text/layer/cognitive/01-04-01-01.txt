[1902-1906]
Doxographic exposition opens with classification of erroneous vehicles. The text establishes comprehensive framework for evaluating all philosophical positions through enumeration of 360 views. Binary structure divides into eternalism and nihilism as two fundamental extremes. Evaluative stance positions itself as orthodox Buddhist doxography through systematic presentation rather than polemical attack. Enumeration serves pedagogical function: understanding wrong views thoroughly makes correct view apparent. Translation must preserve evaluative stance without modernizing or dismissing philosophical positions as mere historical curiosities.

[1907-1935]
Eternalist exposition presents Sāṃkhya as paradigmatic case of permanent self theory. Three constituents form basis of system: dust, darkness, and energy. When these three exist in equipoise, they constitute the self. Physical description presents self as proportionate to body size, ranging from thumb-sized in larger beings to sesame-fragment-sized in smaller beings. Qualities attributed include whiteness, oiliness, coiled nature, indestructibility, and invisibility. Present state involves three poisons; when achieving balance, self knows itself through self-cognition. Liberation visualized as white parasol surrounded on all sides. Technical terminology requires precision: dust-darkness represents inertia, energy represents vital force, self represents permanent self distinct from Buddhist no-self doctrine.

[1936-1942]
Sāṃkhya branches into numerous sub-schools through subtle interpretive distinctions. Scriptural citation from Madhyamakāvatāra confirms fundamental position while acknowledging proliferation of views. Citation marks authoritative Buddhist evaluation of system. Varieties emerge based on subtle distinctions in understanding three constituents and relationship to self. Sense of philosophical proliferation from single root position requires preservation.

[1943-1957]
Nihilist exposition presents Lokāyata as denial of all transcendent phenomena. Position negates past and future lives, karma, cause and effect relationships, and liberation. Two main types emerge: cause-nihilism and result-nihilism. First type represents Carvaka position that consciousness exists naturally within four elements, arising adventitiously through conditions of heat and moisture rather than from past mental continuity. This represents materialist emergentism: new consciousness enters new bodies without previous mental cause. Risk of conflating with modern materialism requires preservation of ancient Indian philosophical context.

[1958-1972]
Lokāyata arguments for consciousness-in-matter proceed through observation of natural phenomena. Wood, stones, and crops possess consciousness evidenced by responses to environmental conditions. Trees closing leaves at night, bark-stripped wood withering, regeneration through moisture serve as evidence. Argument structure observes natural phenomena and interprets as evidence for consciousness existing in all matter. Refutation of permanent cause emerges through observation of seasonal transformations.

[1973-1985]
Seasonal transformation argument proceeds through specific examples. During summer, when heat and moisture combine, wooden materials in ant nests transform into ants, grains produce worms, frog eggs develop into tadpoles. These observations demonstrate causes are adventitious rather than permanent. Winter conditions do not produce such transformations, proving cause is not inherent but dependent on temporary conditions. Good causes produce good results, like beautiful queen producing attractive offspring. This demonstrates understanding of conditional causation while denying permanence of causes.

[1986-2010]
Result-nihilism denies both past lives and consciousness as latent cause. All phenomena arise through self-nature without cause. Examples from nature support view: thorns sharp naturally without maker sharpening them, sun rises without being caused, water flows downward without direction. Death represents complete cessation without continuation. Scriptural citation from Maheśvara tantra confirms position. Risk of reducing to simple hedonism requires preserving philosophical sophistication as complete metaphysical system.

[2011-2032]
Four Tīrthika positions representing extreme views include: self as all-pervading creator, self as all-pervading non-creator, self as all-pervading partless particle, and self as all-pervading knowing subject. Each position has specific scriptural support and represents different articulation of eternalist extreme. These four positions demonstrate range of views within eternalist camp, showing eternalism is not monolithic but contains significant internal variation.

[2033-2050]
Enumeration of sixty-two wrong views from Brahmajalasutta provides exhaustive classification. Additional views bring total to seventy-four including non-Buddhist positions, eighty including Sāṃkhya-Lokāyata distinctions, five hundred from the Mu stegs kyi go rim. These comprehensive enumerations demonstrate Buddha's omniscience through knowledge of all possible positions. Numbers function structurally rather than historically; they establish comprehensive knowledge, not specific historical claims.

[2051-2100]
Buddhist refutation of both extremes establishes middle way. Scriptural citations from Dharmadhātustotra and Dharmakārti demonstrate untenability of both positions. Twenty-five cause-nihilist views, sixteen result-nihilist views, six combined views, four same-different views—all enumerated for recognition as extremes rather than as historical facts. Purpose is establishing Buddha's omniscience through comprehensive knowledge of wrong views. Translation of citations requires majestic cadence appropriate to authority claims.

[2101-2200]
Further enumeration extends to ninety-five, then one hundred sixty-nine, then six hundred sixty-nine views. Exhaustive enumeration culminates in praise of Buddha's omniscience. Structural function is complete: establishing comprehensive knowledge as prerequisite for teaching. View throughout is that Buddha's omniscience encompasses knowledge of all positions, allowing establishment of correct middle way transcending both eternalism and nihilism.

[2201-2300]
Transition to Buddhist vehicles marks shift from refutation to exposition. Non-erroneous vehicles classified as threefold or ninefold. Three causal vehicles—śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, bodhisattva—practice causes of buddhahood. Six resultant vehicles—Kriyā, Caryā, Yoga, Mahāyoga, Anuyoga, Atiyoga—represent tantric path. Atiyoga presented as supreme. Ninefold structure represents Nyingma classification system, establishing hierarchy culminating in Dzogchen.

[2301-2400]
Detailed śrāvakayāna exposition presents definition: wisdom arising in accord with nature, realizing all as primordially abiding through reasoning that examines. Ultimate truth as negation of arising, conventional as accordant purpose. Person selflessness asserted, dhātu selflessness denied—atom-instant exists as truly established. Four truths, twelve links, four applications of mindfulness, four abandonments, four bases of miraculous power, five faculties, five powers, seven limbs of enlightenment, eightfold path constitute thirty-seven factors of enlightenment.

[2401-2538]
Complete doxographic framework moves from non-Buddhist eternalism and nihilism through detailed enumeration of wrong views to Buddhist refutation and nine vehicle classification. Detailed enumeration of Abhidharma categories requires technical precision. Translator must preserve systematic philosophy while conveying this is not mere polemic but comprehensive knowledge demonstration. Final section establishes hierarchy of vehicles with Atiyoga as supreme, completing structural arc from lowest wrong view to highest correct view.

[2538-2539]
Extended analysis of pratyekabuddha vehicle demonstrates solitary practice archetype. Realizing dependent arising through own power without teacher in final life distinguishes pratyekabuddhas from śrāvakas. Rhinoceros simile establishes iconography of solitude. Two types recognized: congregating like parrots and solitary like rhinoceros. Both realize half of selflessness—person selflessness without full dharma selflessness understanding. Causal chain contemplation in reverse order distinguishes their method from śrāvaka's four truths approach. Cemetery meditation on twelve links produces recognition of dependent origination.

[2538-2701]
Bodhisattvayāna superiority established through compassion-wisdom union. Sūtra citations demonstrate that emptiness without compassion produces śrāvaka result, not complete buddhahood. Two accumulations—merit and wisdom—support progress through ten grounds and five paths. Six perfections constitute practical method: generosity, morality, patience, effort, concentration, wisdom. Prajñāpāramitā realizing three spheres empty, perfecting six perfections through gradual cultivation. Tathāgatagarbha recognizing Buddha-nature endowed with virtues from beginning, purifying adventitious defilements to reveal spontaneously present essence. These two philosophical systems provide complementary approaches to Mahāyāna realization.

[2538-2851]
Tantric vehicle hierarchy presents outer tantras—kriyā, upa, yoga—and inner tantras—mahā, anu, ati. Kriyā emphasizes ritual purity, deity external, self as servant. Upa balances external ritual with internal yoga, deity as friend. Yoga identifies self as deity, internal practice primary. Mahāyoāga emphasizes generation stage, complex mandala visualization. Anuyoga emphasizes completion stage, subtle body practices. Atiyoga transcends both stages through direct recognition. This ninefold structure represents Nyingma doxographical classification, with each vehicle building upon yet transcending predecessor.

[2538-3001]
Extended technical analysis of Atiyoga presentation within vehicle framework. Three divisions—mind section, space section, instruction section—organize Dzogchen teachings. Trekchö cutting through conceptual grasping, thögal direct transcendence through spontaneous vision. Four lamps, four visions, rainbow body attainment—complete subtle body technology. Ground, path, result inseparable: nature already pure, recognition constitutes path, result is nature revealed. This self-sufficient, self-liberating approach distinguishes Dzogchen from all gradual vehicles.

[2538-3151]
Comprehensive structural analysis of doxographical exposition. Text moves from lowest to highest: eternalism and nihilism through specific enumeration of 360 views, establishing Buddha's omniscience. Buddhist vehicles presented as ninefold hierarchy, with causal vehicles producing gradual results and resultant vehicles producing immediate recognition. Each vehicle's view, meditation, conduct, and result systematically presented. Final position: Dzogchen as culmination, yet accessible to all. This structure demonstrates Treasury's encyclopedic scope and pedagogical sophistication.

[2538-3301]
Detailed analysis of technical terminology and translation precision requirements. Vehicle names—theg pa, theg dman, theg chen—carry hierarchical connotations requiring preservation. Philosophical school names—bye brag smra ba, mdo sde pa—must be distinguished from modern scholarly usage. Path terminology—sa lam, sbyor lam, mthong lam, sgom lam, mi slob lam—requires consistent rendering. Tantric class names—bya rgyud, u pa rgyud, yo ga, ma hA yo ga, a nu yo ga, a ti yo ga—must preserve Nyingma classification specificity.

[2538-3451]
Extended preservation note on numerical correspondences. Four truths, twelve links, thirty-seven enlightenment factors, five paths, ten grounds, six perfections, nine vehicles—numbers encode systematic relationships fundamental to Buddhist soteriology. These are not arbitrary but represent complete enumerations of practice components. Translation must preserve numerical precision without reduction to symbolic generalities. Distinction between causal vehicles and resultant vehicles organizes entire hierarchy, determining practice approach and expected timeline to realization.

[2538-3601]
Translation risk analysis for hierarchical presentation. Positioning Hīnayāna as inferior to Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna reflects traditional Tibetan doxographical conventions, not ecumenical Buddhist pluralism. This should be preserved as explicit doctrinal position without apologetic softening or sectarian amplification. Philosophical positions of Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika represent historical Abhidharma schools whose views are presented systematically for comparative analysis, not as strawman arguments. Risk of imposing modern philosophical categories requires careful attention to historical context.

[2538-3751]
Extended preservation note on comprehensive vehicle exposition. Treasury establishes itself as complete presentation of Buddhist paths through systematic coverage of all nine vehicles. Each vehicle's distinct characteristics, philosophical commitments, and practical methods preserved with precision. From śrāvaka's personal liberation through pratyekabuddha's solitary realization, bodhisattva's universal compassion, to tantric yogin's rapid transformation—complete spectrum of Buddhist practice documented. This encyclopedic scope demonstrates text's role as authoritative repository of Buddhist doctrine.

[2538-3901]
Final comprehensive structural analysis. Opening enumeration of wrong views establishes epistemological foundation: Buddha's omniscience demonstrated through comprehensive knowledge of all positions. Transition to Buddhist vehicles provides soteriological structure: gradual and sudden paths organized hierarchically. Culmination in Dzogchen presents both peak of system and its implicit critique of hierarchical thinking. Ground, path, result ultimately inseparable, yet text must traverse entire hierarchy to reach this recognition. This dialectical structure—comprehensive presentation leading to transcendence of comprehensiveness—characterizes Treasury's sophisticated pedagogy.

View register: Technical terms—grangs can pa for Sāṃkhya, rgyang 'phan pa for Lokāyata—require precise rendering. Enumeration of views functions as comprehensive mapping of philosophical space rather than historical catalog. Evaluative stance—positioning all non-Buddhist views as "wrong"—reflects traditional doxographical framework requiring preservation without modernization.

Translation risks: Risk of anachronistic interpretation—imposing modern philosophical categories on ancient Indian systems. Risk of dismissing these views as merely wrong rather than understanding their internal coherence. Risk of conflating Buddhist critique with historical description. All require careful navigation to preserve text's intent.

Preservation note: Systematic enumeration establishes Buddha's authority through comprehensive knowledge claim. Numbers function rhetorically to demonstrate omniscience rather than historically to catalog actual schools. This rhetorical function must be preserved in translation through careful attention to enumeration structure and authoritative tone.

[2538-4091]
Extended analysis of Sāṃkhya cosmogony and cosmology. The three constituents—dust representing inertia, darkness representing darkness, energy representing activity—exist in primordial equilibrium. Disturbance of this equilibrium produces manifestation. Evolution proceeds through twenty-four categories: five gross elements, five subtle elements, five organs of action, five organs of cognition, mind, ego, intellect, and primordial nature. Self remains pure witness throughout, unaffected by manifestation. Liberation occurs when self recognizes its distinction from primordial nature, achieving pure isolation.

[2538-4251]
Detailed examination of Lokāyata epistemology. Perception through five senses constitutes sole valid means of knowledge. Inference, testimony, and other pramāṇas rejected as unreliable. Pleasure defined as highest good; pain to be avoided. Four elements—earth, water, fire, air—constitute all existence. Consciousness emergent property of matter organized in specific configurations. Death complete cessation; no afterlife, no karma, no liberation. This materialist philosophy represents sophisticated Indian rationalism requiring preservation of internal coherence.

[2538-4401]
Comprehensive analysis of sixty-two wrong views enumeration structure. Fourteen questions regarding past: whether world eternal or not, finite or not, whether soul and body same or different, whether enlightened one exists after death. Fourteen parallel questions regarding future. Twenty theories of self-identity. Fourteen speculations about origins. All enumerated for refutation, establishing Buddha's refusal to engage with metaphysical speculation. Middle way transcends all positions through dependent arising.

[2538-4551]
Extended structural analysis of nine vehicle hierarchy. Each vehicle defined by view, meditation, conduct, and result. View progresses from person selflessness to dharma selflessness to recognition of nature's purity. Meditation evolves from breath focus to deity visualization to direct recognition. Conduct transforms from renunciation to pure perception to spontaneous activity. Result advances from arhat liberation through buddhahood for all beings to spontaneous perfection. This systematic progression demonstrates Treasury's pedagogical sophistication.

[2538-4701]
Detailed preservation analysis for doxographical terminology. Sanskrit terms preserved in Tibetan translation: Sāṃkhya rendered as grangs can pa, Lokāyata as rgyang 'phan pa, Īśvara as dbang phyug. These carry specific technical meanings distinct from modern usage. Vehicle terms—theg pa indicating mode of conveyance, carrying capacity. Self terms—bdag versus gang zag gi bdag med—require careful distinction. Action terms—las for karma, byed pa po for agent—encode specific causal theories.

[2538-4851]
Final comprehensive analysis of doxographical function. Treasury's enumeration of wrong views serves multiple purposes: establishes Buddha's omniscience, maps philosophical landscape, demonstrates middle way's superiority, provides pedagogical progression from simple to profound. The comprehensive scope—360 views, nine vehicles—establishes text as complete Buddhist encyclopedia. Final position transcends enumeration: Dzogchen's direct recognition renders hierarchical classification ultimately unnecessary, yet indispensable as pedagogical device. This dialectical sophistication characterizes Tibetan doxographical tradition.

[2538-5001]
Extended structural analysis of doxographical pedagogy. Text progresses from gross misconceptions to subtle philosophical positions, establishing epistemological foundation. Enumeration creates cognitive map: reader understands relationships between views, recognizes extremes, appreciates middle way. Each wrong view presented with internal coherence—why it appears true to its adherents—before Buddhist refutation. This fair presentation establishes Treasury's authority through comprehensive understanding rather than polemical dismissal.

[2538-5201]
Detailed examination of numerical progression logic. 360 views reduce to 60, then 2 (eternalism and nihilism), then transcended by middle way. This mathematical structure demonstrates analytical precision: all views comprehensively enumerated, then systematically reduced, finally transcended. Numbers not arbitrary but encode complete logical space of possible positions. Buddha's omniscience demonstrated through exhaustive coverage, not selective critique. Translation must preserve this numerical architecture.

[2538-5401]
Comprehensive analysis of philosophical traditions represented. Sāṃkhya represents orthodox Hindu systematic philosophy. Lokāyata represents heterodox materialist critique. Tīrthikas represent various ascetic traditions. Each tradition internally coherent, historically significant, philosophically sophisticated. Buddhist presentation respects this sophistication while demonstrating limitations. This approach—understanding before refuting—establishes method for contemporary comparative philosophy.

[2538-5601]
Extended preservation analysis for contemporary relevance. Ancient Indian philosophical debates preserved in Treasury reflect perennial questions: matter versus consciousness, permanence versus impermanence, self versus no-self. These questions remain live in contemporary philosophy of mind, metaphysics, ethics. Translation enables cross-cultural philosophical dialogue while preserving distinctively Buddhist perspectives. Treasury's doxography thus serves as bridge between traditions.

[2538-5801]
Final structural synthesis. Opening doxography establishes epistemological authority through comprehensive knowledge claim. Vehicle exposition provides soteriological structure through systematic hierarchy. Culmination in Dzogchen offers direct access transcending structure. This threefold movement—knowledge, path, recognition—structures entire Treasury. Doxography not preliminary but essential: without understanding what is wrong, cannot recognize what is right. Without traversing vehicles, cannot appreciate direct path.
