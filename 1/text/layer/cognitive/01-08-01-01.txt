[10472-10547]
Seven grounds (gzhi bdun) doctrinal exposition. The ground (gzhi) is presented through seven views: (1) ground as primordial purity (ka dag), (2) ground as spontaneous presence (lhun grub), (3) ground as indivisible primordial purity and spontaneous presence, (4) ground as certainty (nges pa), (5) ground as uncertainty (ma nges pa), (6) ground as changeability (bsgyur rung), (7) ground as acceptance of anything (ci yang rung). Each view represents a partial understanding that must be transcended through complete recognition of awareness (rig pa). The seven grounds are not seven different grounds but seven ways of relating to the single ground. The ground is primordially pure (ka dag) and spontaneously present (lhun grub) with all qualities complete. The ground is beyond extremes (mtha' bral), not produced (ma bskyed), not created (ma byas), primordially present (ye nas gnas). Recognition reveals what is already present. Not attained through effort. The single ground of awareness (rig pa gcig) is the source of both samsara and nirvana. The ground's essence (ngo bo) is primordial purity. The ground's nature (rang bzhin) is spontaneous presence. The ground's compassion (thugs rje) is unceasing manifestation.
Structural function: seven grounds doctrinal precision. Register: Dzogchen recognition.
