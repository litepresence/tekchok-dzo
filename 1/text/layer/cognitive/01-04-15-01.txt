Structural function establishes the basis analysis framework through threefold classification of existence, non-existence, and both. The dzogchen view register operates at the level of spontaneous liberation without dependent origination. Translation risks include rendering "klong dkar po" as mere metaphor rather than recognizing its technical designation for expansive white space. Preservation requirements demand maintaining the distinction between the three khra bo factions and their alignment with sems sde, rang gnad, and man ngag traditions.

[3741-3750]
Structural function presents the first khra bo faction aligned with sems sde, emphasizing the inseparability of appearance and mind. View register maintains the primordial purity of dharmatā without acceptance or rejection. Translation risks obscure the technical meaning of "rang dag gnas grol" as self-purified abiding liberation. Preservation requirements note the critical distinction between this view and lower vehicles through the phrase "tha snyad bya rtsol las 'das pa."

[3751-3760]
Structural function introduces the second khra bo faction focused on appearance as self-liberated without cause. View register asserts that virtuous and non-virtuous actions lack inherent existence. Translation risks misrepresent "med snang" as mere non-appearance rather than appearance of emptiness. Preservation requirements ensure the technical term "'gyur ba stong yal" retains its specific meaning of empty transformation.

[3761-3763]
Structural function completes the triad with the third khra bo faction integrating both extremes through oral instructions. View register presents the three essential points of ineffability, non-meditation, and unchanging nature. Translation risks conflate the three gnad into generic spiritual advice. Preservation requirements maintain the precise technical vocabulary distinguishing these three keys as unique to the man ngag sde tradition.

[3764-3765]
Structural function establishes the two categories of klong dkar po related to vast action and view-meditation integration. View register positions these as expressions of the ocean-like expanse where primordial purity manifests without effort. Translation risks render "las rgya che ba" as mere magnitude rather than recognizing its technical sense of vast activity without causal origination. Preservation requirements maintain the distinction between the ocean expanse and sky expanse as separate categories with specific characteristics.

Transitional passage. The Tibetan text moves from previous topic to next. Wylie: 'dang po ni/ shar sna tshogs rgyu med du shar bas snang ngo r...' This structural marker serves as bridge between doctrinal expositions. The lotsawa recognizes the transition and prepares the reader for the next topic. Structural function: transitional clarity. Register: structural awareness.
