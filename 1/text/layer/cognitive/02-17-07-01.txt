This section presents dream yoga preliminary practices and main techniques, establishing the foundational training for recognizing and transforming the dream state. The structural function moves from preliminary recognition of dreams through the three techniques—training, transforming, and cutting—to establish the complete practice framework. The opening description of recognizing fear-inducing conditions as dreams establishes the basic capacity for dream awareness.

The register operates in dream yoga technical terminology: dream recognition (rmi lam zin pa), training ('byongs pa), emanation (sprul pa), transformation (bsgyur ba), cutting (bcad pa), empty (stong pa), appearance-emptiness (snang stong). The preliminary practice of recognizing dreams through strong intention establishes the psychological foundation for subsequent techniques.

Translation risks center on preserving the specific techniques without conflating them. The training technique involves daytime practice of viewing all appearances as last night's dreams, then looking back at the observing awareness to see appearances as groundless, rootless, and naturally clear. The transformation technique involves appearing and empty transformation through mirror meditation on deity bodies. The cutting technique involves releasing all appearance-mind connections without fabrication.

The developmental progression described—from coarse dreams to subtle, then to forgetting, finally to nothing dreamed with awareness resting in clear samādhi day and night—establishes the complete path. The technical term "day-night union" (nyin mtshan kha sbyor) indicates the final integration of waking and dream states.
