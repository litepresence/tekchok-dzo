[9223-9227]
The opening establishes the essence of mountain-top universal intention as awareness nature of Great Perfection, luminosity without transfer, space-wisdom non-dual. This serves as the structural foundation for the entire twelve-part presentation that follows. The view register positions Dzogchen as the ultimate expression beyond all gradual approaches. Translation risk lies in rendering "space-wisdom non-dual" in a way that preserves the distinctiveness of each term while conveying their inseparability.

[9228-9234]
The first facet of view for supreme faculty introduces wisdom light spontaneously arising as self-wisdom recognition without form. This describes the immediate, non-conceptual recognition of awareness nature. The intention facet presents unmoving clarity like planets appearing on the ocean surface—an image of stable, luminous presence. Translation must preserve the astronomical metaphor while conveying the sense of spontaneous, effortless arising.

[9235-9241]
Middle faculty view recognizes self-awareness as unborn—this marks a distinct recognition threshold from the supreme faculty's spontaneous wisdom light. The intention appears free from conceptual portions like flags on the ocean, suggesting relative stability with occasional disturbance. The conduct becomes unblocked and spontaneous like a madman, moving without obstruction through all appearances. The translation challenge involves rendering "madman" without pejorative connotation while preserving the sense of unconventional freedom.

[9242-9248]
Last faculty view recognizes appearances as illusion or emanation—this represents the entry-level recognition that all phenomena lack inherent existence. The intention demonstrates self-appearance essence, wisdom arising like a lion chick free from the womb and egg, suggesting birth without confinement. Translation must convey both the imagery and its significance: wisdom emerging without the usual developmental constraints.

[9249-9255]
Second intention, wisdom general anointing, establishes recognition of awareness power as naturally perfect from the beginning. The structural function marks a transition from the mountain-top intention to the empowerment phase. The view register emphasizes recognition of what has always been complete rather than achieving something new. Preservation requires maintaining the "anointing" terminology that connects to tantric consecration frameworks.

[9256-9261]
Supreme faculty recognition of empowerment as unborn fruit self-place—this represents the highest recognition where empowerment and result are not separate. The intention remains unmoved in great bliss equal to space through wisdom method pressing the thigle. Translation risk involves the technical vocabulary of "pressing the thigle" which must be rendered with precision for practitioners while remaining accessible to scholars.

[9262-9270]
Middle faculty view recognizes appearances as awareness power—a recognition that phenomena are not separate from perceiving awareness. The intention rests unmoved in clarity like sun and moon united, an image of balanced, stable luminosity. Conduct rests in true nature yoga mode. The result obtains the suchness without birth and death. The structural progression moves from recognition through stability to result.

[9271-9277]
Last faculty view recognizes empowerment qualities expanding—the recognition that empowerment is not a one-time event but ongoing unfolding. The intention relies on deity form with signs for meditation. Conduct moves in true nature display. Result obtains buddhahood through the doorway of qualities. Translation must preserve the distinction between the three faculties while showing their progressive refinement.

[9278-9286]
Third intention, thigle seeing liberation, establishes the bardo wisdom self-arising awareness recognizing self-appearance as self-awareness, achieving buddhahood. The structural function transitions to advanced thigle practices. View register emphasizes self-recognition in the intermediate state. Translation risk lies in rendering "thigle" consistently while acknowledging its multiple dimensions—bindu, sphere, essential point.

[9287-9293]
Supreme faculty view sees wisdom power qualities appearing like a shooting star moving in space, recognizing liberation in three moments. This describes the instantaneous recognition and liberation characteristic of highest capacity. The intention dwells clear and pervasive like the sun risen in space—an image of all-pervading, unobstructed luminosity. Conduct enjoys the wisdom body pure. Result becomes Buddha on the ground of primordial purity in three moments.

[9294-9302]
Middle faculty view recognizes true nature bliss inexhaustible great appearing excellently arising. The intention sees each moment's distinct object, producing excellent recognitions, seeing each dharma body appearance. This describes a more gradual process of recognition through sustained practice. Translation must preserve the enumerative quality while conveying the progressive refinement of recognition.

[9303-9313]
Last faculty view recognizes the pure wisdom appearance with the thought "did that come from me or me from that?"—this represents initial uncertainty before recognition. The intention rests without seeing in those appearances. Conduct possesses doubt and hesitation. Result obtains the breath-release in the nature-emanation body field. The structural presentation shows how even limited recognition leads to result.

[9314-9326]
Fourth intention, sun moon measure equal, establishes recognition of appearance-emptiness exhausting equal. The view register emphasizes the union of apparent opposites. Structural function transitions to equal measure practices. Translation risk lies in rendering "measure equal"—a technical term indicating the balancing of all dualistic extremes.

[9327-9341]
Middle faculty view recognizes method wisdom as non-dual. Intention rests in the nature of method wisdom like sun moon appearing in space. Conduct moves in great bliss secret thigle white-red. Result obtains the buddhahood in the womb of the five families' practice. The progression through faculties demonstrates how the same essential recognition manifests at different depths.

[9342-9371]
Fifth intention, ocean expanse liberation, establishes dwelling in naturally clear equal true nature, innate concentration. The structural function completes the five intentions. View register emphasizes natural perfection without modification. Translation must preserve the ocean imagery while conveying the sense of vast, unbounded awareness.

[9372-9384]
Summary verse integrates all five intentions, showing how each supports different aspects of practice: mountain-top intention for highest view without high or low, wisdom anointing for abiding in true nature, thigle seeing for awareness liberation from space-appearance, sun moon equal for intention in the expanse of exhausted phenomena, ocean expanse for delivering awareness to the ground of primordial purity.

[9385-9403]
Final structural note establishes the completion of the twenty-fifth chapter, transitioning to the extensive explanation of how to practice through direct introduction. The view register maintains Dzogchen as the pinnacle vehicle. Translation risk involves the chapter colophon formulas which must be rendered consistently with other chapters while preserving their distinct contributions to the whole.
