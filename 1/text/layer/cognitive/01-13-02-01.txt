Water lamp exposition opens with its essence: through holding parts of both samsara and nirvana, the power-support of the agent seeing pure and deluded appearances is the clarity of light-essence. The Blazing Jewel Lamp of Beautiful Gold Flower Tantra establishes the far-casting water lamp (rgyang zhags chu'i sgron ma) through the essence that gathers both appearances, because the agent-holding part has not ceased. This represents the view holding both parts of samsara-nirvana agreement. Translation preserves functional terminology without modernizing the epistemological framework.

[16301-16330]
Etymological analysis of "far-casting" (rgyang) reveals multiple layers. Form-reflections of light-luminous clarity and deluded appearances (earth and stone) abide and are held at far distances. Through casting samsara's deluded appearances with deluded-thought far outward, it is called "far." If not realized, nirvana also casts far. When seeing self-appearance, binding impure appearances to the snare. The snare (zhags) binds like a rope: not examined, it appears as a collection binding the agent; examined, it shows individual hairs that cannot bind.

[16331-16360]
The rope simile extends to the nature of bondage itself. Neither bound nor existent as bound, neither freed nor untied—primordial spontaneously-complete Buddha-dharma emanates various forms. Into vast self-appearance, non-entry through binding also represents the noose. Through non-attachment to appearances, inward samadhi bliss moistens and fulfills—hence called "water" (chu). Water also refers to the gathering of water-essence. To power-consciousness, form-appearance is clear; light-appearance increases and arises upward—hence "lamp" (sgron). Space-awareness's appearance producing ground is "ma" (mother); pure-essence power-form eye-seeing support also called "ma."

[16361-16390]
The Blazing Lamp Tantra provides authoritative citation: "Distance holds the far continuum, holds form-as-appearance, gathers color and so forth, awareness body from far distance, see agent hold. From samsara thought side, throw distance outward called. Not-realize side, throw nirvana distance. Form and desire-object five bind noose. To power-of appearance, hold memory thought self-as. Distance hold noose called. To sky cloud-free, awareness selfless body appear."

[16391-16420]
Threefold division emerges: element-essence self-gather far-noose water-lamp, pristine-awareness gather far-noose, power gather far-noose. The element-essence type shows expanding and gathering aspects. The pristine-awareness type shows clear holding of light-clarity self-appearance. The power type shows holding of appearance, appearance-object, and self-knowing eye consciousness.

[16421-16450]
Detailed characteristics: object-appearance refers to objects appearing externally like mountains; appearance-object refers to objects with their own characteristics like cliffs; appearance-knowledge is free of conceptual thought and verbal name-forms; appearance-object refers to objects established as solid things. The general characteristic is that form-appearance produces capable holding of object-appearance. The three self-characteristics map to different functions.

[16451-16482]
Further tantra citation elaborates: "This essence, through seeing agent non-ceasing, objects hold; power-of pure-essence eye's gate produces; lotus eye located; self-characteristic power holds; from elements projecting, gathering, holding, expanding appear; from pristine-awareness seeing, abiding, higher holding; power object and object-possessor and objectless self-holding."

[16482-16483]
Location is specified as the eye's A-fruit (a 'bras). When body first forms, the lamp-eye and element-eye first form within the great channel knot at the navel's triangular center. From the parents' causal conditional essences, the eye's fruit forms. The pathway extends from navel to heart, heart to spine, shoulder blades to inner ear, skull membrane to eye's A-fruit center. Two channels without blood or serum, like goat horns, filled with light channels inside, insert as water-lamp's gateway.

[16482-16521]
These two channels' inner light channels constitute the actual far-casting water lamp. From within emerges Rigpa's thought-free body, vajra chain, and stacked light spheres with five colors, nine arrangements—containing aspects of four lamps. This channel is the water lamp's aspect; the bindu is the empty lamp's aspect; five lights are the expanse's aspect; non-realized knowledge is wisdom's lamp aspect. The Pearl Garland states: "Thought-free Rigpa vajra chain, great bliss Brahma's gate appears."

[16482-16561]
Generation occurs from the navel. When first entering the mother's womb, body forms from essence. The great channel knot at the navel's triangular center produces eye-fruit from parents' causal conditional essences. White and black mix together. The gateway is the eye's A-fruit essence's straight center. Tantra states: "Arising gate is both eyes themselves; from this channel all appears."

[16482-16591]
Simile compares to hook: "Like holding-hook takes what appears from nose, samsara and nirvana's two noses this holds." Measures include: element-essence far-noose measure completes expanding and gathering; pristine-awareness measure sees vajra chain; essence-gathering measure distinguishes form-appearance particulars. Tantra states: "Lamp appearing-purpose, object form-appearance, Rigpa also, vajra chain appearance measure."

[16482-16621]
Empty bindu lamp has twelve aspects: essence, etymology, divisions, characteristics, location, gateway, nature, object-appearance, measure, actual lamp, practice method, and simile. Practice methods involve settling the empty lamp through contemplation, then experiencing light-clarity appearance mixed day-night. Relative bindu resides at Roma; path practice is union-father-mother's method.

[16482-16651]
Left side contains natural bindu, subtle essence melody, abiding as light's self-melody—mouth-union's bliss-emptiness transformation meaning. Center contains dharmakāya bindu, free of elaboration, light-clarity purity, self-arisen wisdom blazing lamp basis. This itself explained extensively below. Pearl Garland citation: "From channels bindus, subtle and flowing nature, beautified by light rays. Also three parts: right, left, and center."

[16482-16681]
Right relative bindu is great bliss condition, source of gathered bliss, all buddhas' great secret, means-indicating nature. Center dharmakāya nature, empty-clarity singular bindu, center-located self-nature clear, radiating-withdrawing beyond thought-speech, gradually free of conceptual thought, existence-nonexistence extremes cleared, eternalism-nihilism extremes non-abiding, non-conceptual spontaneously complete, inexpressible naturally empty—ultimate bindu.

[16482-16711]
Left natural bindu abides, bliss-union both-pervading, not strongly established, mouth-union itself obtains bliss. Mahamudra's cause, great bliss wisdom's path, all secret mantras' self-mandala, great method saving from samsara, secret wisdom-blazing light—this is great bliss essence. Thus effort-possessing coarse training and effort-free self-settled both are taught in this vehicle.

[16482-16741]
Particularly for supreme intelligence, body-speech vital-points pressed, mind side freed, wisdom actually appears—three kayas path bindu unsurpassable vital-point taught. Thus this vehicle surpasses all vehicles. From The Precious Treasury of Vehicle Dharma, the twelfth section on certain vital-points.

[16482-16771]
Thus having shown latency-body formation with divisions, now wisdom-support four lamps' distinctions with parts are spoken. Four lamps' essence brief show, nature extensive explain. Body first forming time: water-supported, first-formed generation-doing channel knot inside, lamp-eye and element-eye first form. From element-eye, four elements' body formation previously explained.

[16482-16801]
From lamp-eye, wisdom-appearance light, bindu, body etc., ultimate transcendence basis, eye two A-fruit center, goat-horn-like base subtle tip large two form, called far-casting water lamp. Relying on this, empty bindu lamp, wisdom self-arisen lamp, expanse pure lamp—four arise. Pearl Garland: "Beings' path arise gateway, right two left two center, lamp blaze manner located, empty bindu lamp, pure expanse lamp, wisdom self-arisen, far-casting water lamp, see object appear."

[16482-16831]
Self-Arisen citation: "Four lamps thus—empty bindu lamp, awareness expanse lamp, wisdom self-arisen lamp, far-casting water lamps—all sentient beings located." Thus four ultimate elements pure, four lamps ripen. This knowing is extremely important.
