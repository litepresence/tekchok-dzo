The text establishes five categories of inconceivable yogins as foundational vessel-bearing practitioners for Great Perfection teachings. These five classifications—great potency completion, prophecy obtained, great breath emitting, body-mind half, and karma-obeying action—encompass the previously mentioned four liberating categories while providing a more refined typology. This fivefold framework maps the complete spectrum from worldly beings to accomplished practitioners within a single comprehensive structure, demonstrating how all beings have place within the Great Perfection view while capacities remain distinctly recognized. The structural function serves to organize practitioners by their degree of realization and capacity for receiving profound instruction.

The detailed exposition of the five yogin categories unfolds systematically. All beings of the three realms constitute karma-obeying-action yogins, operating within conventional causality. Those who have seen truth and ceased deluded appearances represent body-mind-half yogins, having transcended ordinary dualistic perception. Practitioners who have gained certainty regarding spontaneous presence manifold appearances are prophecy-obtained yogins, recognized for their stabilized recognition. Beings of the final faculties in the tenth stage residing in pure lands who emit great breath constitute great-breath-emitting yogins, indicating advanced bodhisattva realization. Those free from all effort and striving within primordial purity and unchanging great nature represent great-potency-complete yogins, the fully accomplished masters. This classification demonstrates the universal scope of Great Perfection while maintaining clear distinctions among capacities and attainments.

The text establishes eight general qualifications for receiving Great Perfection teachings, presenting the baseline vessel requirements. These include reverence for the teacher as source of liberation, capacity for generosity without attachment, profound faith in the teachings, wisdom capable of penetrating meaning, diligence in sustained practice, moral restraint regarding non-virtuous conduct, renunciation toward cyclic existence, and specific karmic affinity for the supreme secret Great Perfection. Additionally, particular requirements include holding view, meditation, and conduct as taught in the Talgyur tradition, demonstrating unwavering faith and diligence, respectful service to the teacher, observance of sacred vows, and stability in unchanging practice. These qualifications ensure the practitioner can receive, maintain, and actualize the profound instructions without distortion or spiritual materialism.

The Norbu Drupchen Gyud presents detailed criteria through the Buddha's response to retinue inquiries about suitable vessels. The three families traditionally suitable for secret mantra definitive meaning teachings are identified: royal caste demonstrating leadership qualities, priestly caste showing learning and contemplative capacity, and great merchant caste exhibiting practical wisdom and resourcefulness. Alternatively, exceptional individuals regardless of birth caste may qualify. Physical characteristics indicating capacity include coarse limbs suggesting groundedness, complexion ranging from teeth and nails to clear white indicating purity, redness at the eye corners showing vital energy, hair coiled to the right indicating spiritual wind patterns, dark lips suggesting depth, minimal physical pride indicating humility, ordinary external conduct demonstrating integration, and spontaneous powerful speech indicating authentic expression. These signs indicate natural capacity for receiving the secret oral instructions of Great Perfection. The text explicitly states that even those of low-caste birth bearing these marks may receive these teachings, which should be transmitted completely without remainder, using whatever materials are available, regardless of social status.

Two manners of accomplishment are presented as authentic approaches to practice. The beggar's manner involves abandoning one's native land and familiar connections, traveling to foreign regions where one remains unknown to others regarding name, qualities, knowledge or lack thereof. The practitioner adopts ordinary disguise, sustains themselves through alms, and practices in caves, villages, hermitages, or travelers' shelters without external signs of spiritual attainment. During this practice, not boasting of one's virtues indicates absence of pretension and spiritual pride. Similarly, not inquiring about others' teachers or teachings indicates complete confidence in one's own oral instructions without doubt or comparison. This approach eliminates social supports for ego and forces reliance on direct recognition.

[22416-22437]
The deer's manner of accomplishment represents complete solitude and single-pointed focus. The practitioner goes to extremely isolated mountain areas, rocky caves, thick forests, peaks, snow bases, or great empty valleys, abandoning the three activities of body, speech, and mind. Body activities such as marketplace trading, building construction, or physical movement are completely abandoned. Speech utterances of any kind are abandoned. Mind's proliferating thoughts and conceptual differentiations contrary to one's oral instructions are abandoned. Practicing single-pointedly without distraction upon the supreme oral instruction alone, the body relaxes so channels relax, channels relaxing so wind-mind becomes naturally relaxed, wind-mind relaxing so conceptual thought gradually ceases, giving rise to non-conceptual absorption. This progressive relaxation leads to natural meditative stability without force or contrivance.

[22438-22453]
Four yogins of progressive practice are enumerated from the Norbu Drupchen, establishing a framework for continuous engagement with the path through specific domains. These are the conduct-progressive-yogin who maintains consistent application in activity, the meditation-progressive-yogin who sustains meditative absorption, the view-progressive-yogin who maintains recognition of the nature of reality, and the fruition-progressive-yogin who abides in the result without seeking. These categories establish distinct modalities of maintaining uninterrupted connection with the essential points of the teachings throughout all circumstances of experience.

[22454-22476]
The Rinpoche Pungpa Gyud presents the detailed schema of twenty meanings to be practiced within the four progressive yogins. This comprehensive framework includes four masters' methods establishing the foundation, four natures of meaning defining the essential characteristics, four object-cognitions that cut the continuum of appearing birth through direct recognition, four placement methods through oral instructions that spontaneously liberate phenomena of appearance-existence, four points of natural liberation that empower control over afflictions without suppression, four examples establishing certainty through showing one's own face beyond doubt, and four great confidences of unchanging view that ascertain wisdom measures. These twenty total meanings provide the complete path structure for progressive practice. Those who familiarize themselves with these touch the sphere of nature-perfected Great Perfection without contacting the ground of fabrication or contrivance, naturally attaining the great seal of secret mantra through recognition rather than construction.
