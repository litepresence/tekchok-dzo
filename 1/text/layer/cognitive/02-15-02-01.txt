Life-holding wind fivefold subdivision with precise locations and functions. Root-holding anchors to channels, protecting provides defense, radiating extends outward, impure processes contaminants, shaking creates movement. View register: wisdom-energetic patterns, not physiology. Translation risk: wind names without technical specificity. Preservation: fivefold structure as systematic subtle body anatomy, winds abide at crown and heart establishing universal template.

[488-501]
Fire-equal wind fivefold subdivision operating in non-dual correspondence: fire-equal one with life-holding, two with rigpa, three with lamp, four with bindu, five with prajna. View register: winds as wisdom-energetic matrices. Translation risk: "fire-equal" misread as comparative rather than technical identity. Preservation: wind-wisdom non-dual correspondences as functional mappings, not poetic associations.

[502-526]
Color-radiance producing wind and all-pervading wind complete the system. Color-radiance winds: consciousness-producing, mind-arising, radiance-possessing, consuming, agitating. All-pervading winds: wisdom-pervading, lamp-pervading, awareness-pervading, memory-pervading, body-holding. View register: appearance-making as wisdom function. Translation risk: "color-radiance" and "radiance" conflated. Preservation: object-correspondences establish perceptual dimension of wind function.

[527-540]
Compassionless karma wind fivefold completion: moving, liberating, reversing, accelerating, instantaneous. Pervasions: aggregates, moments, bardo, thought, three times. View register: karma as movement pattern, not moral judgment. Translation risk: "compassionless" as ethical deficiency. Preservation: technical designation for non-discriminating kinetic function operating across all domains.

[541-567]
Etymological explanations connect wind system to broader framework. Life-holding: holding wisdom-life; color-radiance: possessing five wisdom-lights; fire-equal: abiding without separation from wisdom-appearance; karma: liberating into wisdom's expanse. View register: etymology as recognition support. Translation risk: "because of" implying causation. Preservation: precise etymological derivations support recognition of wind nature.

[568-590]
Two knowings establish wisdom framework: knowing-all regarding dharmata internally clear, knowing-all-aspects regarding dharmachan externally clear. View register: natural rigpa capacities. Translation risk: epistemological categories rather than wisdom functions. Preservation: two knowings as dharmakāya and saṃbhogakāya perspectives, integrated yet distinct.

[591-620]
Synthesis demonstrates winds as wisdom display abiding inexpanse without departure. Five winds arise from expanse as display, never separate, never truly arising or ceasing. View register: winds as ultimately non-arising display. Translation risk: "arising from expanse" as causal generation. Preservation: Kunsal citation establishes three-kaya presence through wind-wisdom integration—body, speech, mind each have specific abiding manner.

[621-650]
Pure original rigpa abides in secret cavity's spontaneously light-clear palace as essence-nature-compassion threefold. Essence as kaya unclear, external-appearance never ceases. Nature as five-light basis, life-wind four limbs as speech essence. Compassion as rigpa essence, two knowings spontaneously complete. Kaya and wisdom without separation abide without transition. View register: all elements naturally integrated wisdom display.

[651-668]
Five winds as life-wind essence, compassion-rigpa wisdom aspect. Pure becomes Buddha wisdom, impure becomes sentient thought-accumulation. Radiating limb winds four as compassion capacity like sun-rays: upward-going prajna horse, downward-clearing light-ray, fire-equal ripening power, all-pervading completing power. Though merely life-wind's aspect, not radiating into expanse, essence abiding in non-ceasing manifestation basis.

[681-668]
Kunsal citation establishes three-kaya integration: body like clear-empty water bubble, speech as limb winds four like fire sparks in rigpa's expanse, mind as life-wind own nature like wisdom fire spark without partiality, essence of essence as five wisdoms. View register: three kayas naturally integrated, not sequential. Translation risk: three-kaya as progressive achievement. Preservation: simultaneous natural presence.

[711-668]
Wisdom incorruptible by conceptual thought: cannot be modified or labeled, like earth and sky. Clear and minute like five iron sparks. Essence of expanse dharmakāya, rigpa holds all basis. View register: wisdom naturally pure, not purity achieved. Translation risk: "cannot be modified" as impassivity. Preservation: dharmakāya-as-expanse-essence, rigpa-as-holder as technical description.

[741-668]
Chos kyi dbyings citation: dharmadhatu like empty-pervasive sky. dharmakāya in jewel cavity—original pure ye-gdangs. Rigpa light house in light appearance—common basis rigpa's expanse. Connection with five winds establishes meaning. View register: dharmadhatu as natural abiding. Translation risk: "common basis" as shared ground. Preservation: ye-gdangs distinct from gdangs, five-wind connection as systematic description.

[771-668]
Fire-five: pervading external-internal, illuminating external-internal, equally abiding, conceptual activity, completing activity. Located in lung, eyes and limbs, flesh-skin gap, soles, palms. View register: fires as wisdom display, not metabolic heat. Translation risk: fire as physiological temperature. Preservation: fire-wind correspondence as wisdom clarity and movement pairing.

[801-668]
Five earths: universally appearing, unchanging vajra, all-arising jewel, appearance-showing infinite, completing practice. View register: earths as wisdom display's substantial aspect. Translation risk: earth as material solidity. Preservation: earth-wisdom correspondences—abiding with rigpa, lamp, bindu, wisdom, prajna.

[831-668]
Five waters: unchanging, peaceful clear, qualities-arising extensive, non-grasping, non-holding completing. Located in channels, bones, blood, lymph, eyes. View register: waters as wisdom display's fluid aspect. Translation risk: water as physiological fluids. Preservation: five-water structure as wisdom fluidity with precise subtle body locations.

[861-668]
Five spaces: universally pervasive, objectless clear gdangs, unmixed pure, meaning-indicating, pure field liberating. Correspond to rigpa, five lights, pure expanse lamp, signs wisdom, twenty-one pointing certainties. View register: space as wisdom display's open dimension. Translation risk: space as mere emptiness. Preservation: space-wisdom correspondences and twenty-one pointing certainties as recognition framework.

[891-668]
Synthesis: five elements' rigpa aspects gathered are great elements, support is minor elements. Completes dependent arising nature presentation. View register: all elements as wisdom display naturally complete. Translation risk: synthesis as summary. Preservation: great-minor element distinction as technical description.
