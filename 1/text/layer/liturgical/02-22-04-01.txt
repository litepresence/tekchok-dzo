[31748] <ornament> To nirvāṇa possessing the method,
[31749] <ornament> That contaminated remainder,
[31750] <ornament> Aggregates' trace burned and purified—
[31751] <ornament> To that kāya, two:
[31752] <list> The Peaceful Kāya and the Wrathful Kāya.
[31753] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[31754] <verse> Kāya forms, two exist,
[31755] <verse> Peaceful and wrathful, thus spoken.
[31756] <verse> The wrathful thus-gone || 11330 ||
[31757] <verse> The peaceful cannot empower emanation.
[31758] <tantra> From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[31759] <verse> Kāya also two:
[31760] <verse> The Peaceful Kāya and the Wrathful Kāya.
[31761] <prose> Continuum: two from essence-cause—all beings, primordially abiding as clear-light kāya; from existing relics, here creation-completion clearly shows the manifest cause, arising from gathered pure elements.
[31762] <prose> Latency exists, not-yet-ripened nature;
[31763] <prose> Manifest ripened, appearing as relics.
[31764] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[31765] <verse> Beings, primordially,
[31766] <verse> Dwelling in their own great ground, || 11340 ||
[31767] <verse> By the distinction of ripened and not-yet-ripened,
[31768] <verse> Manifest and latency.
[31769] <prose> Place: greatly arising from head or spine, though also from elsewhere. Here the clear-light-familiar arising-kāya is shown as arising from those two.
[31770] <tantra> From the Blazing Relics:
[31771] <verse> Likewise kāya from head,
[31772] <verse> Or from the joints of the spine.
[31773] <prose> Result: the rank of obtaining liberation.
[31774] <prose> That peaceful and wrathful both arising, consciousness dissolves into sky. At the time of primordially-pure sky own-tone arising, one liberates without the reality-bardo, attaining buddhahood, included within this-life liberation, because that is the future part separate from this support.
[31775] <prose> If the peaceful kāya arises, this appearance ceases, immediately dissolves, liberating in samādhi's five days.
[31776] <prose> Samādhi days are called "concentration-ground portion"—yogins have long and short differences. || 11350 ||
[31777] <prose> If the wrathful kāya arises, from the eye arises Vajrasattva's nose-rope, sound-light-ray three arise as own-appearance, liberating in five instant-parts.
[31778] <tantra> Thus from the Blazing Relics:
[31779] <verse> If both arise,
[31780] <verse> This one without bardo,
[31781] <verse> Essence primordially-pure great,
[31782] <verse> This one becomes possessing confidence.
[31783] <verse> Five days see truth,
[31784] <verse> That also dissolves into Buddha.
[31785] <verse> If wrathful kāya arises,
[31786] <verse> This in reality-bardo, || 11360 ||
[31787] <verse> In five instant-parts,
[31788] <verse> Liberates, O Ḍākinī.
[31789] <tantra> From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[31790] <verse> If peaceful kāya arises, immediately upon this appearance ceasing, obtains stability, cannot emit emanation-kāya.
[31791] <verse> If wrathful kāya arises, obtains stability in that, in twenty-one days can emit emanation-kāya.
[31792] <prose> That peaceful kāya arising delivers the clear-light path, liberating through transparent-penetration into the primordially-pure ground—own-appearance emanation not arising from bardo. Primordial purity separates that emanation-appearance; it is not the ground for own-appearance emanation arising.
[31793] <prose> Furthermore, however, other-appearance is the ground for Saṃbhogakāya-Nirmāṇakāya arising; other-benefit activity arises depending on that, though know that primordial purity lacks the actual emanation-appearance portion.
[31794] <prose> That wrathful kāya arising, knowing sound-light-ray three as own-appearance—at liberation time, spontaneously-accomplished ground-appearance arises, remaining for a moment.
[31795] <prose> Through remaining for a moment in the arising of spontaneously-accomplished ground-appearance,
[31796] <prose> Upon completing twenty-one days of samādhi, || 11370 ||
[31797] <prose> Through the gate of impure own-appearance, saṃsāra appears as the six classes of beings.
[31798] <prose> Through the gate of purity, the emanation-kāya emanates, taming whatever and benefiting.
[31799] <prose> Like illusion benefiting illusion,
[31800] <prose> Own-appearance benefits through own-appearance.
[31801] <prose> What need for liberation before emanating emanations?
[31802] <prose> For if self is not liberated, since self-benefit is not complete, there is no occasion for other-benefit to arise.
[31803] <prose> That emanation is only like a shooting star's swift passage,
[31804] <prose> Explained as uncertain regarding long or short duration.
[31805] <prose> Confusing able and unable to emit emanations,
[31806] <prose> Many focus their minds on whether Buddhas can or cannot benefit others. || 11380 ||
[31807] <prose> This is a great error.
[31808] <prose> Wherein, buddhas that do not benefit are not desired in the Great Vehicle and are impossible in reality.
[31809] <prose> Those liberated in primordial purity without transparent-penetration, where spontaneously-accomplished doors of the bardo arise without delay, have no emanations,
[31810] <prose> For the impure field of emanation does not appear at that time.
[31811] <tantra> From the spontaneously-accomplished door appearing, the impure appears.
[31812] <prose> If emanation does not benefit there,
[31813] <prose> Moreover, since the appearance of saṃsāra has not set, to complete the incomplete Buddha-activity of own-appearance, emanation appears to unfold.
[31814] <prose> Having benefited through that, emptying saṃsāra, again that emanation-appearance goes to the ground of primordial purity, dissolving within the eight spontaneously-accomplished doors.
[31815] <prose> That primordially-pure ground, beyond appearing and not-appearing, is without actual difference of individual three kāyas from merely the ground of arising of the three kāyas.
[31816] <tantra> From that, know the way other-benefit arises again in ground-appearance. || 11390 ||
[31817] <prose> This place is the supreme difficulty, the great secret vajra seal.
[31818] <prose> Thus, if from now on one arises who can speak without error, know it to be through my power.
[31819] <prose> Second, the extensive explanation of relics has three parts:
[31820] <list> Brief showing by common division,
[31821] <list> Extensive explanation by special division,
[31822] <list> Concluding meaning by distinction of relics and ringsels.
[31823] <ornament> Of the first:
[31824] <prose> Generally, all beings are Buddhas primordially, dwelling as the five wisdom-natures individually and not-individually, five relics not-yet-ripened as latency existing for holding that kāya-race and life. The yogin trains the clear-light essence-path, ripening manifestly.
[31825] <prose> Five ringsels and so forth arising, liberating race separately.
[31826] <tantra> From the Blazing Relics: || 11400 ||
[31827] <verse> To supreme person, nirvāṇa,
[31828] <verse> All Buddhas' relics arise.
[31829] <verse> From Buddha-race distinction,
[31830] <verse> Relics' race five-five arise.
[31831] <verse> Ringsel thus-gone relics,
[31832] <verse> Likewise called ringsel,
[31833] <verse> Is vajra-race relics.
[31834] <verse> Ringsel jewel,
[31835] <verse> Ringsel lotus,
[31836] <verse> Likewise called ringsel, || 11410 ||
[31837] <verse> Is action-race relics.
[31838] <prose> Consequently, that also: from five relics' races to the person, whatever arises—one or all complete—to the five-race mass appearance, relics' race is the sign of liberating as that Buddha.
[31839] <tantra> From that:
[31840] <verse> Method-possessing nirvāṇa,
[31841] <verse> Body—all this arises.
[31842] <verse> If individual race relics arise,
[31843] <verse> Also in reality-bardo,
[31844] <verse> See Buddha of individual race,
[31845] <verse> Liberate.
[31846] <tantra> From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror: || 11420 ||
[31847] <verse> Relics also five:
[31848] <verse> Dark-blue color, Vairocana field, complete Buddha;
[31849] <verse> White color, Vajrasattva;
[31850] <verse> Yellow color, Ratnasambhava;
[31851] <verse> Red color, Amitābha;
[31852] <verse> Green color, Amoghasiddhi;
[31853] <verse> Various colors, reached ground of spontaneously-accomplishing five kāyas.
[31854] <prose> Second, special division—color of five relics' races, measure of big-small, distinction of place, from what cause arises—four.
[31855] <prose> First, color: five possessing portions of five races. That also peaceful relics' color and wrathful relics' color arise as two portions.
[31856] <prose> Peaceful color, spoken in the Blazing Relics: || 11430 ||
[31857] <verse> Ringsel white,
[31858] <verse> Ringsel blue-black,
[31859] <verse> Ringsel yellow,
[31860] <verse> Ringsel red,
[31861] <verse> Ringsel green.
[31862] <prose> In the Self-Arisen, wrathful relics' color spoken:
[31863] <prose> That race shown thus:
[31864] <verse> Ringsel white luster,
[31865] <verse> Ringsel blue-black,
[31866] <verse> Ringsel possessing heat, yellow, || 11440 ||
[31867] <verse> Ringsel dark-blue,
[31868] <verse> Ringsel red-green-black—
[31869] <verse> Likewise color division.
[31870] <verse> From the Blazing Relic,
[31871] <prose> To the supreme being who attained nirvāṇa,
[31872] <verse> All buddhas' relics also arise;
[31873] <verse> From the distinction of the Buddha families,
[31874] <verse> The relic races arise as five-by-five.
[31875] <verse> Śarīraṃ is the bliss-gone relic;
[31876] <verse> Likewise parīraṃ is called || 11450 ||
[31877] <verse> The vajra family's relic.
[31878] <verse> Curīraṃ is the jewel;
[31879] <verse> Berīraṃ is the lotus;
[31880] <verse> Likewise ñarīraṃ is called
[31881] <verse> The karma family's relic.
[31882] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[31883] <verse> That also, for the person from whom relic races five
[31884] <prose> One or all complete whatever arises, to the five-family mass appearance,
[31885] <prose> The relic race's buddhahood liberation is the sign.
[31886] <verse> From that itself: || 11460 ||
[31887] <verse> "The method-possessor who attained nirvāṇa,
[31888] <verse> In the body all these arise;
[31889] <verse> Individual family relics arising,
[31890] <verse> In the dharmatā intermediate state also,
[31891] <verse> Individual individual family's Buddha's
[31892] <verse> Kāya seeing and liberating."
[31893] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[31894] <tantra> From the Vajrasattva Heart Mirror:
[31895] <prose> Regarding relics also five:
[31896] <prose> Dark-blue color is Vairocana's field perfectly completely awakened. || 11470 ||
[31897] <verse> White color is Vajrasattva's.
[31898] <prose> Yellow color is Ratnasambhava's.
[31899] <prose> Red color is Amitābha's.
[31900] <verse> Green color is Amoghasiddhi's.
[31901] <prose> Variegated color is the spontaneously accomplished five-kāya ground arrived at.
[31902] <break> <verse> Second, regarding the distinction of divisions—the relic races' colors,
[31903] <break> <prose> Big-small measure,
[31904] <prose> Place distinction,
[31905] <prose> Cause from what arises—four.
