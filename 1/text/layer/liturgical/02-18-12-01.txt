[25668] <prose> First, behold the cessation of outer vision:
[25669] <prose> Within each Sphere, half-bodies dawn—
[25670] <prose> Thus manifest through the complete purification of Emanation;
[25671] <prose> Then single bodies self-arise, born of direct perception of dharmatā.
[25672] <ornament> Third: The Vision of Awareness Arriving at Its Measure.
[25673] <ornament> Regarding the manner of this vision and the explanation of its nature—
[25674] <prose> These bodies transform as five Fathers, five Mothers,

[25686] <prose> For wisdom's self-existing resonance appears through force of purification. || 5260 ||
[25687] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur:
[25688] <prose> The Vision of Awareness Arriving at Its Measure—
[25689] <prose> Enjoyment Body's marks and examples clearly manifest
[25690] <tantra> From rainbow lights of indeterminate hue;
[25691] <prose> The five families appear as Fathers and Mothers.
[25692] <break> <tantra> From the Bstan bu:
[25693] <break> <tantra> From such bodies to their utmost limit,
[25694] <prose> Six, ten, and five-three—
