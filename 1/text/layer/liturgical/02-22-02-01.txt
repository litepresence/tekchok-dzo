[31192] <prose> First, the essential nature: vast and expansive, the great identity of clarity, self-illuminating.
[31193] <prose>
[31194] <prose> The definitive terms are these:
[31195] <prose> It is called the "center";
[31196] <prose> It is called the "expanse." || 10770 ||
[31197] <prose> The nature of Dharmatā, the very substance of things, is vast and without limit.
[31198] <prose>
[31199] <prose> Divided, there is the outer expanse—space;
[31200] <prose> The inner expanse—the lamp;
[31201] <prose> The secret expanse—light and bindu;
[31202] <prose> The unsurpassed expanse—the great display of self-liberated delusory appearance.
[31203] <prose>
[31204] <prose> Moreover, in progressive order:
[31205] <prose> Awareness,
[31206] <prose> Wisdom, || 10780 ||
[31207] <prose> The Three Kāyas,
[31208] <prose> Are the domain of Fruition.
[31209] <prose>
[31210] <prose> The characteristic is this: since it opens to the vast, has the capacity to appear, and pervades,
[31211] <prose> It appears as the domain of clarity—like a mirror of clear depth.
[31212] <prose>
[31213] <prose> In brief, Dharmatā is not a thing in itself;
[31214] <prose> It is that which brings forth the power to clarify the domain through which Dharmatā appears.
[31215] <prose>
[31216] <prose> The result is this: depending upon understanding without error the domain of Dharmatā, || 10790 ||
[31217] <prose> Seeing the essential nature of Dharmatā itself, making the unchanging direct perception the Path—one awakens to Buddhahood.
[31218] <prose>
[31219] <prose> Through familiarity with such an expanse, external wondrous signs manifest as visionary experience:
[31220] <tantra> From the Blazing Reliquary:
[31221] <verse> "One who becomes familiar with the expanse—
[31222] <prose> Their breath, inner and outer movement exhausted,
[31223] <prose> Goes like a bird through space,
[31224] <prose> And like a fish through water;
[31225] <prose> The one endowed with fortune proceeds thus.
[31226] <prose> Together with lands and Mount Meru, || 10800 ||
[31227] <prose> And objects not seen before—
[31228] <tantra> From a single seat they behold them,
[31229] <prose> And likewise the Buddha-fields—
[31230] <prose> Those not seen before—
[31231] <prose> All these become visible at once.
[31232] <prose> One possessing such signs and marks,
[31233] <tantra> From this point, in sixteen months,
[31234] <prose> Shall also behold the Dharmadhātu."
[31235] <prose> Thus it is said.
[31236] <prose> || 10810 ||
[31237] <prose> The internal visionary signs are these:
[31238] <tantra> From the heart-mirror of Vajrasattva, these prior signs arise for that person:
[31239] <prose> When sitting alone, experiencing bliss;
[31240] <prose> The body light as a cotton leaf;
[31241] <prose> No desire to be with others;
[31242] <prose> Feeling as if flying through space;
[31243] <prose> The perception of joy when appearances cease;
[31244] <prose> No attachment to body or life;
[31245] <prose> Mind not engaging with any appearance;
[31246] <prose> Awareness clear without sinking; || 10820 ||
[31247] <prose> Cognition naturally relaxed;
[31248] <prose> Happiness when with others;
[31249] <prose> Afflictions unable to arise through any circumstance;
[31250] <prose> Even when afflictions arise, not grasping them as thoughts;
[31251] <prose> No attachment arising to beautiful forms.
