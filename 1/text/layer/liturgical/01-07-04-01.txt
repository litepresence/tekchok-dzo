[10086] <ornament> First: Outer's outer—harmful mind abandoning is.
[10087] <tantra> From the Essence Meaning Aspect-Taken Tantra:
[10088] <tantra> "Whoever mantra-holder vajra holder,
[10089] <tantra> Being other or self also suffice—

[10095] <tantra> "Supremely mantra in entered to,
[10096] <tantra> Harm-doing mind done if,
[10097] <tantra> Above's suffering experience becomes."
[10098] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10099] <prose> Outer's inner: guru and vajra siblings harmful mind abandoning is.
[10100] <tantra> From the Sky-Iron Fire Blazing Tantra: || 10100 ||
[10101] <tantra> "If being common to,
[10102] <tantra> Object become harm's mind arise if—

[10114] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10115] <prose> Outer's secret: self-other's established-view wrong-view arise abandoning is.
[10116] <tantra> From the Great Arrangement:
[10117] <tantra> "Self or other's hidden one's
[10118] <tantra> Dharma disparage, wrong one's path—
[10119] <tantra> Root's samaya from exceed after,

[10122] <tantra> Self's established-view wrong-view arise,
[10123] <tantra> Hell itself from liberate chance not."
[10124] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10125] <prose> Mind inner outer: conduct, and
[10126] <prose> Inner: meditate, and
[10127] <prose> Secret: wrong view abandoning is.
[10128] <tantra> From the Crystal House Stacked Tantra:
[10129] <break> <tantra> "View and meditate and conduct wrong—
[10130] <break> <tantra> This path wrong great is. || 10130 ||
[10131] <tantra> Being all's suffering whatever,

[10133] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10134] <prose> Secret three outer: view meditate conduct,
[10135] <prose> Inner: yi-dam's deity,
[10136] <prose> Secret: guru and vajra siblings day-night in mind done is.
[10137] <tantra> From the Lotus Klong Tantra:
[10138] <tantra> "Who mind's karma wander, and
[10139] <tantra> Mind done dharmas to,
[10140] <tantra> Mind not-done degenerate, and || 10140 ||
[10141] <tantra> Past and ceased one's karma's end,
[10142] <tantra> Uninterrupted suffering experience one."
[10143] <tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
[10144] <tantra> From the Co-Arisen Near-Taken Tantra:
[10145] <tantra> "Actual-accomplish supreme desire,
[10146] <tantra> Yi-dam abandon not-do, and
[10147] <tantra> Guru abandon if actual-accomplish destroyed.
[10148] <break> <tantra> Other where accomplish also not-find.
[10149] <break> <tantra> Therefore Dharma for promise taken, and
[10150] <tantra> Guru's before samaya pledged one's || 10150 ||
[10151] <tantra> Mind thought one's virtue's karma—
[10152] <tantra> That self abandon if actual-accomplish degenerates."
[10153] <tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
[10154] <tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
[10155] <tantra> From the Tantra of the Supreme Trunk of Samaya Arrangements:
[10156] <tantra> "Promises must not be transgressed;
[10157] <tantra> The guru's commitments must not be broken.
[10158] <tantra> The guru's activities must not be wrong;
[10159] <tantra> One's body, speech, and mind—all
[10160] <tantra> Must not stray from Dharma. || 10160 ||
[10161] <tantra> Acting for the benefit of all beings,
[10162] <tantra> Always respecting the guru,
[10163] <tantra> Not transgressing supreme samaya.
[10164] <tantra> Holding vajra and bell,
[10165] <tantra> Holding substances suitable for mantra.
[10166] <tantra> Generally, from root samaya:
[10167] <tantra> What should be secret and entrusted,
[10168] <tantra> Secret promises and pledges—
[10169] <tantra> If wrong conduct with speech or mind,
[10170] <tantra> This too will increase the uninterrupted continuum. || 10170 ||
[10171] <tantra> Distinctive Dharma arising from empowerment
[10172] <tantra> Must not be revealed to others; join with mind.
[10173] <tantra> The guru's mind—if harmed
[10174] <tantra> By body, speech, or mind—
[10175] <tantra> Wrong deeds must not be done.
[10176] <tantra> Similarly, toward vajra siblings
[10177] <tantra> Harm and injury must not be done."
[10178] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10179] <prose> Thus, guarding the twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, and mind distinctions is the distinctive Dharma here.
[10180] <tantra> Furthermore, from the Consequence: || 10180 ||
[10181] <tantra> "Furthermore, samaya and discipline explained:
[10182] <tantra> The guru is the ground of Buddha worship,
[10183] <tantra> Dharma and Sangha, yi-dam deity,
[10184] <tantra> Vajra sky-goers—to these
[10185] <tantra> Gathering and worship must not cease.
[10186] <tantra> Seeing a guru with proper characteristics,
[10187] <tantra> Praise and worship should be complete.
[10188] <tantra> Do not disparage women, do not be angry.
[10189] <tantra> Do not disparage aggregates; rely on yi-dam.
[10190] <tantra> Mandala, mantra, and deity, || 10190 ||
[10191] <tantra> Mudra reliance is indeed proper.
[10192] <tantra> Do not break the faithful gathering,
[10193] <tantra> Do not disturb the virtuous mind.
[10194] <tantra> The discipline-possessed should dwell in samaya.
[10195] <tantra> Furthermore, the training sequence:
[10196] <tantra> Complete bodily conduct,
[10197] <tantra> Speech must be strictly restrained.
[10198] <tantra> Mind dwells, examines, and analyzes.
[10199] <tantra> Enter sequence, do karma sequence.
[10200] <tantra> Always hand and pill karma, || 10200 ||

[10203] <tantra> Beautifully conduct the wheel.
[10204] <tantra> Take the chief of supreme attainments,
[10205] <tantra> Do with the wheel of six place-ornaments.
[10206] <tantra> All these, without transgression or degeneration, must be earnestly done.
[10207] <tantra> If these are exceeded, faults are measureless."
[10208] <tantra> From the Tantra of the Jewel-Stacked Wheel:
[10209] <tantra> "If body samaya is transgressed,
[10210] <tantra> One is separated from the word called Buddha-body. || 10210 ||
[10211] <tantra> Thus, all beings of the three realms—
[10212] <tantra> Compared to cutting life at one time,
[10213] <tantra> By defeat, sin is limitless.
[10214] <tantra> Similarly, if speech ceases,
[10215] <tantra> Buddha-speech's word does not dwell.
[10216] <tantra> Of all beings of the three realms,
[10217] <tantra> The tongue faculty at one time
[10218] <tantra> Cut—by this sin is limitless.
[10219] <tantra> If mind degenerates,
[10220] <tantra> Filling the three realms with meditators, || 10220 ||
[10221] <tantra> Virtuous monks dwelling in virtue,
[10222] <tantra> At one time disturbing mind, expelling mind—
[10223] <tantra> By this, sin increases more."
[10224] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10225] <prose> Especially, degenerate fall from relying on the guru is heavy.
[10226] <tantra> From the Glorious Sky-Not-Exhausted Tantra:
[10227] <tantra> "If without bad mind,
[10228] <tantra> By degenerate mindfulness in dream,
[10229] <tantra> Or non-virtues becoming careless,
[10230] <tantra> Confess aimed at the guru. || 10230 ||
[10231] <tantra> Bodily fault by body,
[10232] <tantra> Thus speech and mind also.
[10233] <tantra> If not confessed immediately,
[10234] <tantra> By this too, experience uninterrupted suffering."
[10235] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10236] <tantra> Moreover, the guru is the nature of all Buddhas,
[10237] <tantra> Teaching to liberate from saṃsāra by supreme Dharma at this time; therefore the object is fierce.
[10238] <tantra> Accomplish as spoken,
[10239] <tantra> Abandoning non-faith,
[10240] <tantra> Wrong mind, || 10240 ||
[10241] <tantra> Harm,
[10242] <tantra> And speaking, etc.
[10243] <tantra> From the mouth of the great master Joy Vajra:
[10244] <tantra> "The supreme guru commanded:
[10245] <tantra> If knowing the flaw of faults,
[10246] <tantra> Do as spoken.
[10247] <tantra> Thus, toward the guru's activity,
[10248] <tantra> Even if body's suffering becomes supreme,
[10249] <tantra> By one's own ability, make effort to do.
[10250] <tantra> The guru's mind, even for a moment, || 10250 ||
[10251] <tantra> Must not be disturbed.
[10252] <tantra> Toward the guru's food and wealth,
[10253] <tantra> As one cherishes one's own life,
[10254] <tantra> The yogi must always act.
[10255] <tantra> If in the guru's realm,
[10256] <tantra> Teaching Dharma, empowerment, consecration,
[10257] <tantra> And all meditations to be done,
[10258] <tantra> Must not be done without subsequent permission.
[10259] <tantra> Briefly, by body, speech, and mind,
[10260] <tantra> Whatever deed's aspect is done, || 10260 ||
[10261] <tantra> Without asking the guru, without permission,
[10262] <tantra> Even a little must not be done.
[10263] <tantra> Furthermore, whatever virtuous karma,
[10264] <tantra> Begin by asking the guru.
[10265] <tantra> In all yogic conduct,
[10266] <tantra> Must not separate from the supreme guru.
[10267] <tantra> Whenever eating food of the three times,
[10268] <tantra> With first portions cut in three parts,
[10269] <tantra> Must offer to the supreme guru.
[10270] <tantra> By wealth and rare jewels, || 10270 ||
[10271] <tantra> To the guru, vajra holder,
[10272] <tantra> Without desire, offer portions.
[10273] <tantra> With first portions of whatever and whatever,
[10274] <tantra> Dedicate and offer to the supreme guru.
[10275] <tantra> Briefly, all of one's mind,
[10276] <tantra> Pure aspect, without pretense,
[10277] <tantra> Aim toward the guru's portion.
[10278] <tantra> All good qualities will be accomplished."
[10279] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10280] <prose> Purpose is from the Consequence: || 10280 ||
