[22490] <ornament> First:
[22491] <prose> The conduct of the cause-characteristics vehicle.
[22492] <prose> Though entering the common path, merely engaging in conduct without swift liberation through that conduct alone.
[22493] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[22494] <verse> The conduct of non-clinging grasping,
[22495] <verse> Is the conduct of the characteristics vehicle;
[22496] <verse> Bound by great attachment through meaning, || 2070 ||
[22497] <verse> Without method, how could liberation come?
[22498] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22499] <ornament> Second:
[22500] <prose> The general conduct of Secret Mantra: though method exists, dwelling in effort and accomplishment, swift liberation does not come.
[22501] <prose> Also from that same source:
[22502] <verse> The conduct without negation or affirmation,
[22503] <verse> Is the outer-inner conduct of Secret Mantra;
[22504] <verse> Not desiring to stop afflictions,
[22505] <verse> Not desiring to accomplish primordial wisdom.
[22506] <verse> The conduct of word-meaning connection, || 2080 ||
[22507] <verse> Not non-attachment through meaning,
[22508] <verse> Distinction superior through existing method,
[22509] <verse> Great method grasping-conduct thus.
[22510] <verse> That conduct's yoga also,
[22511] <verse> Is not the conduct of true nature.
[22512] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22513] <ornament> Third:
[22514] <prose> The spontaneously accomplished conduct of Great Perfection.
[22515] <prose> In the nature, without acceptance or rejection, grasping or effort, abiding in accordance with that, transcending like space directions and divisions, abiding as great primordial liberation and primordial conduct.
[22516] <prose> Also from the Self-Arisen: || 2090 ||
[22517] <verse> Conduct without attachment to clinging,
[22518] <verse> Is the Ati conduct of Great Perfection;
[22519] <verse> Without doing to be done, without done, without ground of arising,
[22520] <verse> Without going, without coming, without dwelling,
[22521] <verse> Without clinging, without attachment.
[22522] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22523] <ornament> Second, extensively explaining the certain conduct of Great Secret—two aspects:
[22524] <prose> Extensively explaining the nature of twenty-one conducts,
[22525] <prose> And the sequence of performing vajra song and dance.
[22526] <ornament> First, from the Sun-Mouth-Joining Tantra: || 2100 ||
[22527] <verse> Through conduct like the bee,
[22528] <verse> Savor the taste of all dharmas.
[22529] <verse> Through conduct like the deer,
[22530] <verse> Abandon objects that become causes of delusion.
[22531] <verse> Through conduct like the mute,
[22532] <verse> Completely abandon the words of delusion.
[22533] <verse> Through conduct like the peacock,
[22534] <verse> Cut doubts regarding secret mantra.
[22535] <verse> Through conduct like the madman,
[22536] <verse> Abandon objects of singular dwelling. || 2110 ||
[22537] <verse> Through conduct like the lion,
[22538] <verse> Abandon fearful mind, go to charnel grounds.
[22539] <verse> Through conduct like the dog and pig,
[22540] <verse> Abandon concepts of pure and impure.
[22541] <verse> Through conduct like the owl,
[22542] <verse> Practice immediate mind-thought.
[22543] <verse> Through conduct like the child,
[22544] <verse> Abandon long attachment to delusion.
[22545] <verse> Through conduct like the elephant,
[22546] <verse> Guide with words agreeable to the world. || 2120 ||
[22547] <verse> Through conduct like the great elephant,
[22548] <verse> Turn from the depths of saṃsāra's battles.
[22549] <verse> Through conduct like the deer,
[22550] <verse> Abandon concepts of child and enemy.
[22551] <verse> Through conduct like the doe,
[22552] <verse> Determine the time for contentment with desires.
[22553] <verse> Through conduct like the she-bear,
[22554] <verse> Do not spread the seeds of saṃsāra.
[22555] <verse> Through conduct like the brahmin,
[22556] <verse> Abandon others' enjoyments as food. || 2130 ||
[22557] <verse> Through conduct like the heroine,
[22558] <verse> Distinguish the boundaries of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[22559] <verse> Through conduct like the fish,
[22560] <verse> Place the support of mindfulness in its own place.
[22561] <verse> Through conduct like the space-vajra,
[22562] <verse> Practice open presence toward all phenomena.
[22563] <verse> Through conduct like the intermediate-space wind,
[22564] <verse> Abandon the thought of grasping and holding.
[22565] <verse> Through conduct like the garuḍa,
[22566] <verse> Cut precipices with waves. || 2140 ||
[22567] <verse> Through conduct like the mountain,
[22568] <verse> Practice upward the unchanging self-purity.
[22569] <verse> Through conduct like the great vajra,
[22570] <verse> Practice without turning back appearance.
[22571] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22572] <prose> Though there are twenty-two enumerations, the two deer-like conducts are combined into one by division, thus explained as twenty-one.
[22573] <ornament> Second, the sequence of performing vajra song and dance—three aspects:
[22574] <prose> The time of song and dance,
[22575] <prose> Song and dance itself,
[22576] <prose> The benefits of song and dance. || 2150 ||
[22577] <ornament> First:
[22578] <prose> The time of conduct distinguishing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundaries, and
[22579] <prose> Feast gathering, and
[22580] <prose> Empowerment, and
[22581] <prose> The time of maṇḍala accomplishment, and
[22582] <prose> The time of elevating samādhi higher—these five, when pure, are hidden from ordinary perception, thus performed:
[22583] <tantra> From that same source:
[22584] <verse> Whatever yogin is fortunate,
[22585] <verse> When wandering in charnel grounds,
[22586] <verse> Again and again perform the vajra song, || 2160 ||
[22587] <verse> Companion of non-conceptual samādhi abiding.
[22588] <verse> Going before all conduct,
[22589] <verse> Therefore perform the vajra song itself.
[22590] <verse> Entering feast, empowerment, and maṇḍala,
[22591] <verse> At that time, strive in song.
[22592] <verse> When depending on the non-conceptual tantra,
[22593] <verse> This very one should be performed at that occasion.
[22594] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22595] <prose> Especially explained as supreme for settling the mind and clearing dullness:
[22596] <tantra> From that source: || 2170 ||
[22597] <verse> Whoever arrives at samādhi,
[22598] <verse> Through this one arrives at settling;
[22599] <verse> If the yogin becomes dull,
[22600] <verse> Through this, if excited, samādhi is good.
[22601] <verse> Self-aware great bliss strikes with expanse,
[22602] <verse> Joined with mahāmudrā itself.
[22603] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22604] <ornament> Second, song and dance itself—body ritual, mind meditation, and speech action, three aspects:
[22605] <prose> Body ritual: implements and dance, two aspects.
[22606] <prose> That also: when entering feast and maṇḍala, and when elevating samādhi, || 2180 ||
[22607] <prose> From whichever peaceful or wrathful implements:
[22608] <prose> Peaceful: adorned with silk and jewel ornaments, clothes rustling,
[22609] <prose> Peaceful crown ornament, and
[22610] <prose> Holding vajra and bell.
[22611] <prose> Wrathful implements:
[22612] <prose> Six bone ornaments, great ash smearing,
[22613] <prose> Corpse stripes,
[22614] <prose> Bandha, and
[22615] <prose> Holding phurba.
[22616] <prose> Dance: arranging the deity's mudrā. || 2190 ||
[22617] <prose> Speech: reciting mantra and essence.
[22618] <prose> Mind: meditating the deity's body.
[22619] <prose> Especially when distinguishing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundaries,
[22620] <prose> Body naked, abiding ordinarily,
[22621] <prose> Performing various mudrās and various dances,
[22622] <prose> Speech and mind also likewise.
[22623] <prose> In forests, lake-groves, and so forth, when elevating experience higher,
[22624] <prose> From yogin's body implements:
[22625] <prose> Ḍāmaru, and
[22626] <prose> Bell, and || 2200 ||
[22627] <prose> Flute, and so forth, blowing, adorned with flower head-ornaments, and so forth,
[22628] <prose> Mind meditating the deity's body, and
[22629] <prose> Training directly in rigpa face-introduction, and
[22630] <prose> Abiding in self-abiding samādhi, these three elevated,
[22631] <prose> From foot dance and right-extend left-draw,
[22632] <prose> To left-extend right-bend, and so forth, transforming,
[22633] <prose> Speech action: long and short vowels and consonants,
[22634] <prose> Spoken with pleasant sound, crooked,
[22635] <prose> Drawing nose-breath of Oṃ, Ā, Hūṃ, He, Lye, and so forth,
[22636] <prose> Performing the unsurpassable supreme secret vajra words: || 2210 ||
[22637] <prose> E ma ki ri ki ri,
[22638] <prose> Maṣṭa bāli bāli,
[22639] <prose> Sa mi ta pu ru pu ru,
[22640] <prose> Ku ta li ma su ma su,
[22641] <prose> I kā ra su li bha ta ye,
[22642] <prose> Tsa ki ra bhu li sa la ye,
[22643] <prose> Sa mun ta tsar ya su bha yai,
[22644] <prose> Bhe ta sa bha ya ku le yai,
[22645] <prose> Sa kā ri dhu kā na,
[22646] <prose> Ma ta rai bai ta na, || 2220 ||
[22647] <prose> Ba ra li hi sā na,
[22648] <prose> Ma khar ta ki la nāṃ,
[22649] <prose> Saṃ bha ra ta me ka tsaṅ taṃ pa,
[22650] <prose> Sur ya ta ra e pa śa na pa,
[22651] <prose> Ra na bhi ti sa bhu ra lā pa,
[22652] <prose> Ma smin sa gu li ta ya pa,
[22653] <prose> Gu ra gu rā sa ga kha ra na lī,
[22654] <prose> Na ra na rā i thar pa ṭā la,
[22655] <prose> Sir na sir ṇe bhe sa ras pa laṃ,
[22656] <prose> Bhun rda bhun rda tshi ṣa sa ke laṃ, || 2230 ||
[22657] <prose> Sa sā,
[22658] <prose> Ri rī,
[22659] <prose> Li lī,
[22660] <prose> Ā āī,
[22661] <prose> Mi mī,
[22662] <prose> Ra rā rā.
[22663] <prose> Thus from the Sun-Mouth-Joining, taking the dharmatā song, the intent of Samantabhadra father-mother:
[22664] <verse> Because unborn, not ceasing,
[22665] <verse> Pervading all without going or coming,
[22666] <verse> Great bliss, supreme dharma, unmoving, || 2240 ||
[22667] <verse> Equal to space, liberation without stain.
[22668] <verse> Without root, without support,
[22669] <verse> Without dwelling, without taking, great dharma,
[22670] <verse> Primordially liberated, spontaneously equal, vast and great,
[22671] <verse> Without binding, without complete untying.
[22672] <verse> Pervading-vast mansion, primordially existent essence,
[22673] <verse> Pervading without decline, completely transcending.
[22674] <verse> Vast and great, O space expanse,
[22675] <verse> Great dharma blazing, sun-moon maṇḍala.
[22676] <verse> Spontaneously accomplished, directly apparent, || 2250 ||
[22677] <verse> Vajra mountain, great lotus,
[22678] <verse> Sun lion, primordial wisdom song,
[22679] <verse> Great sound, music without equal,
[22680] <verse> Enjoying in the limit of space,
[22681] <verse> Buddha Buddha all equal,
[22682] <verse> Samantabhadra, vast dharma peak.
[22683] <verse> In the expanse-depth of the good space-expanse,
[22684] <verse> Clear expanse, spontaneously complete, primordially complete and great.
[22685] <prose> Thus the meaning.
[22686] <prose> Taking from the pervading-vast vast state of mind itself. || 2260 ||
[22687] <ornament> Third, the benefits of song and dance:
[22688] <tantra> From the Sun-Mouth-Joining:
[22689] <verse> That also is the chief method of yoga,
[22690] <verse> Through soundless vajra song,
[22691] <verse> Satisfying the minds of all Buddhas,
[22692] <verse> Companion of yogins' experience,
[22693] <verse> Capturing the minds of ḍākinīs,
[22694] <verse> Turning the attachment of the six lineages of saṃsāra,
[22695] <verse> The ground of gathering for the fortunate,
[22696] <verse> Self-settling the mind-streams of all, || 2270 ||
[22697] <verse> Striking the clear aspects of self-aware bliss,
[22698] <verse> Making the army of singular awareness,
[22699] <verse> Clearing the faults of mind-possessors,
[22700] <verse> Purifying the obscurations of body-possessors,
[22701] <verse> Giving empowerment, samaya, and bliss,
[22702] <verse> Suppressing ignorance through purity,
[22703] <verse> The ground of rest for all vehicles,
[22704] <verse> The juncture of view and meditation connection,
[22705] <verse> The field for taming all essences,
[22706] <verse> The ground of self-arisen Akṣobhya appearance, || 2280 ||
[22707] <verse> Also holding the body of Vajrasattva.
[22708] <prose> Thus and:
[22709] <tantra> From the Vajra Secret Song:
[22710] <verse> To close the gates of lower realms through need,
[22711] <verse> Is the activity of Buddha itself.
[22712] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22713] <ornament> Third, conduct of definite sequence seizing the time—three aspects:
[22714] <prose> Conduct of those beginning the practice, and
[22715] <prose> Conduct distinguishing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundaries, and
[22716] <prose> Conduct raised upon the path of vows and conduct. || 2290 ||
[22717] <ornament> First: The ten of writing letters, worship, and so forth.
[22718] <tantra> From the Middle Extremes:
[22719] <verse> Writing letters, worship, giving, and
[22720] <verse> Hearing, reading, holding, and
[22721] <verse> Explaining, recitation, doing, and
[22722] <verse> Contemplating that, meditating—
[22723] <verse> These ten dharma-actions,
[22724] <verse> Merit's heap is immeasurable.
[22725] <prose> Thus progressively train.
[22726] <ornament> Second: Taking profound instructions into experience and as preliminary to the third empowerment, through body, speech, and mind conduct, distinguishing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, actualizing the conduct of settling rigpa. || 2300 ||
[22727] <ornament> Third: From the twenty-one explained, here mainly the first seven are practiced.
[22728] <prose> That also: first, gathering all dharma gates, directly orienting the tantra, seeking meaning in one direction of experience.
[22729] <prose> Like the bee seeking its house,
[22730] <prose> Hearing distinguishes dharma from non-dharma,
[22731] <prose> Contemplating realizes that meaning, suppressing afflictions,
[22732] <prose> Meditating places realization instantly, extracting afflictions from the root.
[22733] <tantra> From the Sun-Mouth-Joining:
[22734] <verse> Wisdom of hearing cuts outer superimposition, and
[22735] <verse> Wisdom of contemplating cuts inner superimposition, and
[22736] <verse> Wisdom of meditating cuts secret superimposition. || 2310 ||
[22737] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22738] <prose> As companion to that, without doubt, like entering the peacock house before cutting superimposition, without confusion coming,
[22739] <prose> Cutting hearing and contemplating superimposition finished, taking into experience instructions of self-confident recognition.
[22740] <prose> As companion to that, not in the domain of all, conduct like the deer:
[22741] <prose> That yogin, fearing falling into saṃsāra, through shame, not going among people, dwelling alone in the mountains, taking into experience—like the deer hunted, hiding alone through shame.
[22742] <prose> As companion to that, conduct like the mute:
[22743] <prose> Ceasing speech, speaking with no one.
[22744] <prose> Thus doing, rigid memory, conduct like the madman:
[22745] <prose> Body, speech, and mind conduct without planetary attachment, arising spontaneously like a madman.
[22746] <prose> At this time, without pure or impure, conduct like dog and pig arises: || 2320 ||
[22747] <prose> Enjoying food and clothes without choosing whatever.
[22748] <prose> Thus when the six are complete, not overwhelmed by others' manner, suppressing outward, conduct like the lion arises:
[22749] <prose> As the lion has no fear or anxiety toward anything,
[22750] <prose> So this yogin, free from harm of all appearances, humans and non-humans, power to transform whatever arises.
[22751] <prose> When these conducts are given personal names, it is called the conduct of transforming appearance.
[22752] <prose> That also: able to transform others' power, and
[22753] <prose> Able to restore killing, and
[22754] <prose> Accomplishing miracles, and
[22755] <prose> Dharmatā experience blazing, like alcohol intoxication, free from fear in any direction,
[22756] <prose> Power to transform the four elements arises. || 2330 ||
[22757] <ornament> Second, that instruction: the method of direct placement of appearance, seeing whatever appears directly upon appearance, mind itself directly placed.
[22758] <prose> Like snow falling on rock-salt,
[22759] <prose> Upon appearance-top, that itself self-instant spontaneously goes.
[22760] <prose> That also: arising appearance,
[22761] <prose> Ceasing appearance,
[22762] <prose> Coming and going appearance, and so forth—training in phenomena as different pieces, liberating grasping attachment, appearance although true, empty as reflection, and
[22763] <prose> Water-moon, and
[22764] <prose> Sound-echo, and
[22765] <prose> Emanation, and
[22766] <prose> Illusion, and || 2340 ||
[22767] <prose> Mirage, and
[22768] <prose> Optical illusion, and
[22769] <prose> Dream horse completely pure,
[22770] <prose> Training in dharmatā unborn, the general form of dharmas, realizing like space, primordially peaceful.
[22771] <tantra> From the Six Vastnesses:
[22772] <verse> In the mind-itself where arising exists,
[22773] <verse> Through six realms appearance self-dawning,
[22774] <verse> Grasping different forms,
[22775] <verse> Appearance matures, completing as form.
[22776] <verse> In the mind-itself where ceasing exists, || 2350 ||
[22777] <verse> Through impermanent cause self-dawning,
[22778] <verse> In appearance without nature,
[22779] <verse> Completing like example dream.
[22780] <verse> In the mind-itself where elaboration exists,
[22781] <verse> Through various appearance self-dawning,
[22782] <verse> In individual appearance of five gates,
[22783] <verse> Completing from ground grasping self-ground.
[22784] <verse> In the mind-itself where showing exists,
[22785] <verse> Through sound words names self-dawning,
[22786] <verse> Concepts minds self-pure, || 2360 ||
[22787] <verse> Guru instruction secret complete.
[22788] <verse> In the mind-itself where seeing exists,
[22789] <verse> Through many arisen conditions self-dawning,
[22790] <verse> In manifest appearance objects,
[22791] <verse> Completing as unmixed self-clear.
[22792] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22793] <ornament> Third, from that the aim of appearance-existence ground rising dawns:
[22794] <prose> Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dharmas all, though not trained, spontaneously dawn upon the mind-top instantly, without obstruction whatever,
[22795] <tantra> Also from that same source:
[22796] <verse> Again in the mind-itself without existence, || 2370 ||
[22797] <verse> Appearance free from hope and fear,
[22798] <verse> Called confidence-possessing primordial placement aim,
[22799] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[22800] <verse> In the mind-itself without appearance aspect,
[22801] <verse> Singular, minute, fine appearance,
[22802] <verse> Called great elaboration-free aim,
[22803] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[22804] <verse> Thus aim within aim,
[22805] <verse> Mind also definitely established by,
[22806] <verse> Yogin obtains power over mind, || 2380 ||
[22807] <verse> Liberated from defilement binding.
[22808] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22809] <ornament> Fourth, at that time, the fruit transforming aggregates and afflictions ground:
[22810] <tantra> From the Pearl Garland:
[22811] <verse> Aggregates, elements, and sense-fields,
[22812] <verse> Liberate into family and family lord.
[22813] <prose> Thus and:
[22814] <verse> Because conditions liberate through conditions,
[22815] <verse> I do not rely upon object dharmas.
[22816] <verse> In objects liberating through objects, || 2390 ||
[22817] <verse> I do not rely upon the two of grasping and holding.
[22818] <verse> In cause itself liberating through cause,
[22819] <verse> I do not rely upon the two of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[22820] <verse> In dharmas liberating through dharmas,
[22821] <verse> I do not rely upon concept words.
[22822] <verse> In mind-itself liberating through mind,
[22823] <verse> I do not rely upon indicating mind.
[22824] <prose> Thus and:
[22825] <tantra> From the Six Vastnesses:
[22826] <verse> In the mind-itself of six-aggregates appearance, || 2400 ||
[22827] <verse> Thought-assemblies self-place pure.
[22828] <verse> In the mind-itself of sound word appearance,
[22829] <verse> Concept names self-place pure.
[22830] <verse> In the mind-itself of coarse appearance,
[22831] <verse> Four elements' conditions self-place pure.
[22832] <verse> In the mind-itself of grasping-holding appearance,
[22833] <verse> Binding self-grasp pure.
[22834] <verse> In the mind-itself of existence appearance,
[22835] <verse> Phenomena self-place pure.
[22836] <verse> In the mind-itself of non-existence appearance, || 2410 ||
[22837] <verse> Emptinesses self-place pure.
[22838] <verse> In the mind-itself of existence and non-existence,
[22839] <verse> Established extremes self-place pure.
[22840] <verse> In the mind-itself of dharma appearance,
[22841] <verse> Self characteristic pure.
[22842] <verse> In the mind-itself of non-dharma appearance,
[22843] <verse> Delusions self-place pure.
[22844] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22845] <ornament> Second topic: yogin progressively doing meditation—four aspects:
[22846] <prose> Day-night mouth-joining meditation, || 2420 ||
[22847] <prose> Its instruction: ocean relax method,
[22848] <prose> Its aim: appearance-existence ground-place dharmatā,
[22849] <prose> Its fruit: afflictions self-vanquished.
[22850] <ornament> First, three aspects:
[22851] <tantra> From the Sun-Mouth-Joining:
[22852] <prose> Meditation is three: deity and so forth mind meditation, and
[22853] <prose> Mahāyāna samādhi, and
[22854] <prose> The intent of all Buddhas of the three times.
[22855] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22856] <tantra> From the Thalgyur: || 2430 ||
[22857] <verse> What arises from descended nature,
[22858] <verse> Is called pure samādhi.
[22859] <verse> Channels, winds, and bindus, and
[22860] <verse> Body piths, eyes, and emptiness,
[22861] <verse> Are considered meditation.
[22862] <verse> Letters, lights, colors, and
[22863] <verse> Various emanating gathering,
[22864] <verse> In samādhi explanation,
[22865] <verse> Non-fabricated self-place natural state,
[22866] <verse> How that is unchanging, || 2440 ||
[22867] <verse> Is the intent of all Buddhas.
[22868] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22869] <ornament> Regarding that, first, deity and mother's meditation: twenty-one mind-holdings.
[22870] <tantra> From that same source:
[22871] <verse> Through twenty-one mind-holding training stages,
[22872] <verse> First: placing in the ground, and
[22873] <verse> Second: separating body-mind, and
[22874] <verse> Third: seeing dharmatā.
[22875] <verse> At this time, body, speech, and mind piths,
[22876] <verse> Yogins possessing should settle. || 2450 ||
[22877] <verse> Moving wind horse and,
[22878] <verse> Mixed, throwing and gathering by,
[22879] <verse> Skillfully relying upon three piths,
[22880] <verse> Mind's thought continuum ceases.
[22881] <prose> Thus spoken meaning, taking into experience in three aspects.
[22882] <prose> First seven-set places self-mind in ground dwelling;
[22883] <prose> Second separates body-mind grasping attachment;
[22884] <prose> Third shows seeing dharmatā.
[22885] <ornament> First, the seven-set characteristic: holding mind on white A is:
[22886] <prose> Ground mind suitable, sitting on comfortable cushion, body in cross-legged posture, || 2460 ||
[22887] <prose> Meditating one white A shining at nose-tip,
[22888] <prose> When wind goes out, A also goes out;
[22889] <prose> When drawing in, A also comes in—think thus, mix with wind, meditate.
[22890] <prose> That also: if heat disease exists in body, think that A cold touch;
[22891] <prose> For cold disease, think hot touch, train day and night,
[22892] <prose> Experience of mind free from emanating and gathering, uncommon, arises.
[22893] <prose> Body pith, wind pith—all equal.
[22894] <prose> If dull in that, holding mind on letter Pha: breath one, awareness distractedly put,
[22895] <prose> Saying Phaṭ fiercely, awareness thought-free ha-de-ba one comes, until thought not arisen, hold mind, also Phaṭ, train day and night, thought-free emptiness-clear self-resonance meditation arises.
[22896] <prose> Also holding mind on wrathful pleasure laughter: || 2470 ||
[22897] <prose> Saying Ha fiercely short, like before, place mind, thought-free clear resonance experience arises.
[22898] <prose> Holding mind on asura quarrel dispute:
[22899] <prose> Sitting at mountain-peak or rock-top, and so forth,
[22900] <prose> Body hunched, head first, slowly rolling,
[22901] <prose> Slowly moving the body.
[22902] <prose> Thus doing three or four days,
[22903] <prose> Forcefully rolling by element force, moving,
[22904] <prose> Outer appearance red blood turbid, and
[22905] <prose> Yellow flickering, and
[22906] <prose> Green wavering, and || 2480 ||
[22907] <prose> Dissolving, and
[22908] <prose> Blue-clear becoming after,
[22909] <prose> Outer appearance self-ceasing, seeing nothing established as any essence,
[22910] <prose> Experience of seeing-appearance self-liberated arises.
[22911] <prose> At this time, rely upon food suitable for wind.
[22912] <prose> Place mind on letter Raṃ at navel.
[22913] <prose> Holding mind on Hūṃ expelling thought: Hūṃ with long vowel, mixed with wind, hold mind not distracted elsewhere from that nature,
[22914] <prose> Occasionally saying short Hūṃ, experience of thought purified into dharmatā arises.
[22915] <prose> Likewise, meditating Raṃ at navel, accorded with wind and body pith, and
[22916] <prose> Meditating deity's body, || 2490 ||
[22917] <prose> Placing mind on subtle body creating from nose-tip and pore gates, experience of great clear pure awareness arises.
[22918] <ornament> Second, seven-set forehead pith separating body-mind grasping attachment:
[22919] <prose> Wind and body pith as before,
[22920] <prose> Holding mind on white-red mixed bindu at eyebrow-center, pea-lobe size.
[22921] <prose> Through that, wind experience arises.
[22922] <prose> In body center, three channels straight like stick, skeleton nose two nose-holes exist, hold wind from there,
[22923] <prose> Shooting like arrow, demons, obstacles, sins, obscurations purified.
[22924] <prose> Drawing in like hook, entering central mother-nose,
[22925] <prose> Three channels, four wheels, filled with wisdom wind, holding mind there, rigpa emptiness-clear experience arises.
[22926] <prose> From nose-tip, white wind, arrow, from mile to krośa distance, draw two, out go, in come, hold mind, thought-free clear experience arises. || 2500 ||
[22927] <prose> Body given, five lights fence, rainbow-like, clear, not blur, not scatter, not dissipate, not distract, hold mind, light-clear pure experience arises.
[22928] <prose> Shooting wind-mind into sky-space from,
[22929] <prose> Letter or light sphere or sun-moon maṇḍala, increasingly high, increasingly high, finally sinking into expanse, invisible state, holding mind by that means, emptiness without thought-face experience arises.
[22930] <prose> Placing mind on ear, holding simultaneously, sound samādhi experience arises.
[22931] <prose> Holding mind on subtle deity body inside heart, light-clear pure experience arises, and intermediate light clear matures, deity body ring-sel rainbow lights arise.
[22932] <ornament> Third seven-set showing seeing dharmatā:
[22933] <prose> Holding mind on gradual emptiness:
[22934] <prose> First, cool body parts with many,
[22935] <prose> Analyze with many names, and so forth,
[22936] <prose> Even head alone, cool with many names, || 2510 ||
[22937] <prose> When that name examined for meaning, meaning becomes atom, seek where that name abides,
[22938] <prose> When not found, anything mind non-moving, emptiness depth displaying, search without anger, memory, thought, simultaneously place, experience of emptiness non-dual arises.
[22939] <prose> Apply to all appearances as body is.
[22940] <prose> Holding mind on instantaneous emptiness:
[22941] <prose> Whatever appears, intensely viewed, think emptiness clear clear clear gone,
[22942] <prose> Train in all form appearance, sound appearance, and so forth, experience like mirror struck with Ha arises.
[22943] <prose> Holding mind on impermanence: training appearance without fixation,
[22944] <prose> Whatever appears without fixation, various appearance not true, boundaryless, impermanent, think, train,
[22945] <prose> Liberation experience of planetary fixation separation arises.
[22946] <prose> Whatever appears of five elements, awareness just-big, non-distracted placing, || 2520 ||
[22947] <prose> Liberation experience arises there, like dream.
[22948] <prose> Holding mind on non-thought: whatever appears, awareness whatever becomes, moment continuum partless, thought-free, primordially abiding, recognize that, gather, reach, train, thought-free self-abide great meditation arises.
[22949] <ornament> Holding mind on union:
[22950] <prose> When two appear, grasping two arises, view that self greatly, self-purify, non-dual great experience arises, and
[22951] <prose> Through father-mother bliss path doing, also bliss-emptiness non-dual experience arises.
[22952] <prose> Doing intermediate space path:
[22953] <prose> Meditate rigpa dissolving dissolving into intermediate space, and
[22954] <prose> All appearance-mind in sky expanse, quiescent, whatever supportless, meditate, and
[22955] <prose> Meditate sky and all dharmas equal,
[22956] <prose> Experience of extreme-free great emptiness arises. || 2530 ||
[22957] <prose> That meaning also from the Sun-Mouth-Joining:
[22958] <prose> Placing mind on letter A:
[22959] <verse> Phenomena attachment self-place reverses.
[22960] <verse> Placing mind on created deity,
[22961] <verse> Purifies body's stains.
[22962] <verse> Through vajra song of speech,
[22963] <verse> That satisfies the mind.
[22964] <verse> Placing mind on letter Hūṃ,
[22965] <verse> That purifies speech stains.
[22966] <verse> Who holds mind on Raṃ, || 2540 ||
[22967] <verse> That purifies all phenomena.
[22968] <verse> Who abides on letter Ha,
[22969] <verse> Ceases all ignorance.
[22970] <verse> Whoever abides mind on Phaṭ,
[22971] <verse> That abandons body-speech harm.
[22972] <verse> Whoever meditates bindu at eyebrow-center,
[22973] <verse> Through this becomes familiar with wind.
[22974] <verse> Holding mind on stick's essence,
[22975] <verse> That blocks sense doors.
[22976] <verse> Who familiarizes mind at nose-tip, || 2550 ||
[22977] <verse> Elements arising self-place gather.
[22978] <verse> Whoever meditates body support self-light,
[22979] <verse> Through this becomes familiar with bardo ground.
[22980] <verse> Who shoots mind to sky,
[22981] <verse> Through this becomes familiar with emptiness.
[22982] <verse> Whoever holds mind at ear,
[22983] <verse> Through this enjoys sounds as wished.
[22984] <verse> Whoever holds mind at heart,
[22985] <verse> Through this thoughts self-place purify.
[22986] <verse> Whoever abides in emptiness, || 2560 ||
[22987] <verse> Through this phenomena attachment ceases.
[22988] <verse> Whoever meditates emptiness sudden,
[22989] <verse> All memories instantly empty.
[22990] <verse> Whoever trains impermanence mind,
[22991] <verse> Through this turns saṃsāra attachment.
[22992] <verse> Whoever holds mind on five elements,
[22993] <verse> Through that body signs arise.
[22994] <verse> Whoever meditates non-conceptual wisdom,
[22995] <verse> Through this marks attachment ceases.
[22996] <verse> Whoever meditates union bliss, || 2570 ||
[22997] <verse> Through this does desires as path.
[22998] <verse> Whoever does intermediate space path,
[22999] <verse> Through this also obtains power over mind.
[23000] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23001] <prose> Incidental to these, methods of holding mind on appearance objects—form, sound, smell, taste, touch, five—also:
[23002] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[23003] <verse> Eye form, sound, smell, taste, and touch,
[23004] <verse> The five desire objects are trained.
[23005] <verse> Forms: colors, shapes,
[23006] <verse> Craft and various arts, || 2580 ||
[23007] <verse> Optical illusions, and so forth, various.
[23008] <verse> Sounds: lute, vase-drum,
[23009] <verse> String instruments, clay drum, flute, and
[23010] <verse> Pheng, har, and so forth.
[23011] <verse> Smells: fragrance and incense,
[23012] <verse> Mind-suitable, profound dependent connection.
[23013] <verse> Tastes: possessing six molasses,
[23014] <verse> Grape wine, various mixtures,
[23015] <verse> Dependent connection limb joining.
[23016] <verse> Touch: sitting on expert's throne, || 2590 ||
[23017] <verse> Text-folded joined element, and
[23018] <verse> Some tree leaves,
[23019] <verse> Merely touching dharmatā,
[23020] <verse> Mind abides without separation.
[23021] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23022] <prose> Especially, the sequence of four protections as yoga is also explained from that source.
[23023] <tantra> From that source:
[23024] <verse> The sequence of training three kāyas,
[23025] <verse> Taking element qualities as chief,
[23026] <verse> Especially training in sounds of earth, water, fire, and wind, || 2600 ||
[23027] <verse> Certainly accomplish through training.
[23028] <verse> Explaining water sound:
[23029] <verse> Holds the song-sound of ḍākinīs,
[23030] <verse> If constantly familiarized with this,
[23031] <verse> Nirmāṇakāya is certainly accomplished.
[23032] <verse> Earth sound: cool and heavy,
[23033] <verse> Possessing sound of great Brahmā,
[23034] <verse> If constantly hearing and training in this,
[23035] <verse> Saṃbhogakāya is certainly accomplished.
[23036] <verse> Training in fire sound: || 2610 ||
[23037] <verse> Shows the speech-sound of great Viṣṇu,
[23038] <verse> Whoever uses this for hearing,
[23039] <verse> Certainly obtains dharmakāya qualities.
[23040] <verse> Wind sound: piercing and resounding,
[23041] <verse> Speech of joining the garuḍa king,
[23042] <verse> If knowing to constantly recite this,
[23043] <verse> Train commonly in three kāyas.
[23044] <verse> Thus the meaning of four element sounds,
[23045] <verse> Definitely apply to outer time:
[23046] <verse> Winter, spring, summer, autumn seasons, || 2620 ||
[23047] <verse> Water and earth, fire and wind,
[23048] <verse> Connect definitely to time in sequence,
[23049] <verse> If yogin accords with body,
[23050] <verse> Accomplishment comes, no doubt.
[23051] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23052] <prose> Thus summarizing the meaning of deity and human mind-holdings:
[23053] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[23054] <verse> Deity and human mind-holding,
[23055] <verse> Restraining nose-mouth breath,
[23056] <verse> Thought-free mind unmoved, || 2630 ||
[23057] <verse> Is the nature of singular-pointed awareness,
[23058] <verse> Spoken as without instantaneous thought.
[23059] <verse> Cannot indicate great true meaning.
[23060] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23061] <ornament> Second, regarding bodhisattva samādhi—two aspects:
[23062] <prose> Divisions themselves, and
[23063] <prose> Incidental arising.
[23064] <ornament> First, two aspects:
[23065] <prose> Brief presentation:
[23066] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen: || 2640 ||
[23067] <verse> Bodhisattva samādhi,
[23068] <verse> Is held by mind,
[23069] <verse> Arisen by nature or force,
[23070] <verse> Through familiarity becomes expanse, and
[23071] <verse> Abandons food concept.
[23072] <verse> Practiced by ground-dwellers,
[23073] <verse> Thought-free by nature.
[23074] <verse> That also cannot indicate great meaning.
[23075] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23076] <prose> That also: the meaning of awareness is clear light, not merely non-conceptual abiding, — therefore cannot indicate great meaning. || 2650 ||
[23077] <ornament> Extensive explanation—three aspects:
[23078] <prose> Natural force samādhi:
[23079] <prose> Arising spontaneously as non-conceptual by nature, merely settling body and speech.
[23080] <prose> Continuum-support object samādhi:
[23081] <prose> Meditating antidote to afflictions coarse and subtle without nature as view, merely suppressing afflictions.
[23082] <prose> Ground-dwelling samādhi:
[23083] <prose> Samādhi of ground's actual basis, merely purifying own-ground propensities.
[23084] <tantra> Also from the Sun-Mouth-Joining:
[23085] <verse> Mahāyāna samādhi,
[23086] <verse> Through natural force samādhi, || 2660 ||
[23087] <verse> Unfabricated body and speech settle.
[23088] <verse> Through continuum-support samādhi,
[23089] <verse> Instantaneous affliction heads are suppressed.
[23090] <verse> Through ground-dwelling samādhi,
[23091] <verse> Own-continuum sustenance is done.
[23092] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23093] <ornament> Second, showing samādhi arising from clear light—two aspects:
[23094] <prose> Natural, and
[23095] <prose> Fabricated samādhi.
[23096] <ornament> First, natural samādhi: || 2670 ||
[23097] <prose> Arising in all sentient beings when awareness distracts to propensities, from quivering and dwelling, and
[23098] <prose> Exists in sharpshooter's eye, and
[23099] <prose> In hare and bird sleeping eyes, and so forth.
[23100] <prose> Briefly: exists at all times when consciousness-mind distracts to propensities.
[23101] <ornament> Second, fabricated samādhi:
[23102] <prose> All samādhi, samādhi of non-conceptual and conceptual deity creation-completion, and so forth, fabricated by mind, intended by mind.
[23103] <prose> Here, established as three according to need:
[23104] <prose> That also: for yogins, immediately harmed by food and clothes,
[23105] <prose> In depth, harmed by dream and propensities circulating in three realms,
[23106] <prose> As antidotes to those: cutting food attachment samādhi session, || 2680 ||
[23107] <prose> Cutting clothes attachment samādhi session,
[23108] <prose> Cutting dream and propensities attachment samādhi session—train in these three.
[23109] <prose> That also: here, explaining view cutting continuum, progressively practicing yogin—four aspects.
[23110] <prose> View city continuum-cut,
[23111] <prose> Its instruction: mountain all-placement method,
[23112] <prose> Its aim: three realms complete liberation,
[23113] <prose> Its fruit: afflictions ground-purified.
[23114] <ornament> First, two aspects:
