[24582] <ornament> First, regarding bodily conduct that requires settling with necessity:
[24583] <tantra> From the Single Son of Buddha:
[24584] <prose> The body—running and lying down,
[24585] <prose> Rising and moving the limbs,
[24586] <prose> Circumambulating and making prostrations, || 4160 ||
[24587] <prose> Turning the limbs and bowing the head,
[24588] <prose> Whatever actions one remembers—
[24589] <prose> Dance and mudra transformations,
[24590] <prose> Whatever activities one engages in visualization:
[24591] <prose> Thus, whoever performs these,
[24592] <prose> Through naturally cutting the body's attachment,
[24593] <prose> Completely splitting open the body's attachment:
[24594] <prose> By this, one becomes the transformative body.
[24595] <prose> Thus it is said.
[24596] <tantra> From Thalgyur: || 4170 ||
[24597] <prose> The body—going and abiding,
[24598] <prose> Gathering and various illusory displays,
[24599] <prose> Extending and withdrawing the limbs,
[24600] <prose> Demonstrating various activities:
[24601] <prose> With mindful consciousness taking hold,
[24602] <prose> The bodily conduct of the six realms—
[24603] <prose> Mind takes hold, the body performs.
[24604] <prose> Thus, whoever is able to conduct,
[24605] <prose> Through whatever is contemplated, later the continuum ceases.
[24606] <prose> For this, there are two types of purpose: || 4180 ||
[24607] <break> <prose> Examine through the division of common and supreme.
[24608] <break> <prose> Thus it is.
[24609] <prose> Moreover, through whatever is done here alone, in future times one will become enlightened right here,
[24610] <tantra> From the Great Array Chapter Thirty-Two:
[24611] <prose> Whoever desires to split open attachment,
[24612] <prose> Through reversing the body's activities,
[24613] <prose> Through whatever conduct is performed now,
[24614] <prose> Later it will not be thus—
[24615] <prose> Through that reversal, even for the body,
[24616] <prose> Without abiding, throughout the three realms, || 4190 ||
[24617] <prose> The body too does not enter.
[24618] <prose> Thus it is.
[24619] <prose> Moreover, at first when the body forms, speech and mind both depend upon it and form,
[24620] <prose> Therefore at first bodily conduct must be performed.
[24621] <prose> Through performing bodily conduct, later when bodily karma is exhausted, one lacks enthusiasm for activity, and there is the purpose of purifying bodily misdeeds.
[24622] <tantra> From the Ornament Wheel:
[24623] <prose> Whoever splits open the body's attachment,
[24624] <prose> By this, cyclic existence's habitual patterns are cultivated.
[24625] <prose> Thus it is.
[24626] <prose> Through splitting open bodily attachment for seven days, || 4200 ||
[24627] <prose> Or eleven,
[24628] <prose> Or half a month,
[24629] <prose> External bodily attachment self-reverses,
[24630] <prose> Internal body becomes endowed with peaceful discipline,
[24631] <prose> Secret illusory body is certainly liberated into clear light.
[24632] <prose> These are gathered into two: oral transmission and scriptures.
[24633] <prose> These are gathered into what is called mind sections.
[24634] <prose> The sections of space gathered into three spaces:
[24635] <prose> Space of meditation without meditation,
[24636] <prose> Space of nature without searching, || 4210 ||
[24637] <prose> Space of no difference in characteristics—these three.
[24638] <break> <prose> These are gathered into three thousand named tantras.
[24639] <break> <prose> These are gathered into eleven thousand chapters.
[24640] <prose> These are gathered into twenty-two hundred thousand ślokas.
[24641] <prose> These are gathered into eight hundred thousand recitations.
[24642] <prose> These are gathered into two thousand distinctions.
[24643] <prose> These are gathered into nine hundred proclamations.
[24644] <prose> These are gathered into two thousand essential points.
[24645] <prose> These are gathered into fifty essence spheres.
[24646] <prose> These are gathered into fabricated liberation and || 4220 ||
[24647] <prose> posited liberation,
[24648] <prose> liberated-as-is—these three aspects gathered.
[24649] <prose> These are gathered into space sections.
[24650] <prose> All pith instruction sections are gathered into three spaces:
[24651] <prose> Space of play without cessation,
[24652] <prose> Space of mind without liberation,
[24653] <prose> Space of essence without good or bad.
[24654] <prose> These are gathered into twelve thousand two named tantras.
[24655] <prose> These are gathered into twenty-four thousand chapters.
[24656] <prose> These are gathered into twenty-one hundred thousand ślokas. || 4230 ||
[24657] <prose> These are gathered into eleven thousand recitations.
[24658] <prose> These are gathered into four thousand distinctions.
[24659] <prose> These are gathered into two thousand five hundred proclamations.
[24660] <break> <prose> These are gathered into eighty-seven essence spheres.
[24661] <break> <prose> These are gathered into three aspects: essential points gathered,
[24662] <prose> essential points seen,
[24663] <prose> essential points known.
[24664] <prose> These are gathered into two: oral transmission and scriptures.
[24665] <prose> Though scriptures are many,
[24666] <prose> tantras, || 4240 ||
[24667] <prose> scriptures,
[24668] <prose> and pith instruction scriptures—these three gathered.
[24669] <prose> Though pith instruction scriptures are extremely many,
[24670] <prose> refutation,
[24671] <prose> accomplishment,
[24672] <prose> intention,
[24673] <prose> and recitation-focused scriptures—four gathered.
[24674] <ornament> Regarding recitation:
[24675] <prose> recitation of intentional-meaning pith instructions,
[24676] <prose> recitation of abiding-nature essence, || 4250 ||
[24677] <prose> recitation of philosophical system words,
[24678] <prose> recitation of non-dual saṃsāra-nirvāṇa—four gathered.
[24679] <prose> All of these are gathered into three: spreading essential points,
[24680] <prose> taming proclamations,
[24681] <prose> direct introduction,
[24682] <prose> and establishing directly in one's own essential point.
[24683] <prose> Gathering all of these, the great crucial general Dharma framework is well explained.
[24684] <tantra> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[24685] <prose> The detailed classification of philosophical systems: the fourth chapter.
[24686] <prose> || 4260 ||
[24687] <prose> Thus having established the general framework of dharmas,
[24688] <prose> now explaining the unsurpassed vehicle in particular:
[24689] <prose> through the nature of tantra sections as knowables,
[24690] <prose> and the two determinations arising from that.
[24691] <break> <ornament> Regarding the nature of tantra sections, three aspects:
[24692] <prose> Brief showing of tantra framework,
[24693] <break> <prose> Detailed explanation of its nature,
[24694] <prose> Determination of explanation method branches.
[24695] <prose> The first has six aspects:
[24696] <tantra> Tantra essence, || 4270 ||
[24697] <prose> Definitive term,
[24698] <prose> Divisions,
[24699] <prose> Reading measure,
[24700] <prose> Example,
[24701] <prose> and Proof.
[24702] <prose> First, the essence of tantra:
[24703] <prose> Awareness and the ground establishing it—the great secret place unable to be added to or subtracted from, decisive.
[24704] <prose> Definitive term:
[24705] <prose> Showing family, — therefore tantra,
[24706] <prose> That which causes birth in whatever family, — therefore continuum. || 4280 ||
[24707] <prose> Decisive and unbroken continuity, — therefore tantra.
[24708] <prose> Divisions: nature-meaning tantra
[24709] <prose> and indicating-word tantra, two aspects.
[24710] <prose> Meaning tantra is:
[24711] <prose> Mind-itself luminosity by nature, free from conceptualization stains,
[24712] <prose> Abiding permanently in all, — therefore tantra,
[24713] <prose> Buddha family, — therefore tantra,
[24714] <prose> Possessing Buddha characteristics, — therefore posited as tantra.
[24715] <prose> Word tantra is:
[24716] <prose> That very thing indicated by name-word-letter nature, divided into chapters, etc., || 4290 ||
[24717] <prose> Generation stage primarily method,
[24718] <break> <prose> Perfection stage primarily wisdom,
[24719] <break> <prose> Both equally non-dual union,
[24720] <prose> Showing transcendence of all—Great Perfection essential point revealers.
[24721] <prose> Reading measure: generation stage chief, ten aspects:
[24722] <break> <prose> First, basis empowerment and samaya two,
[24723] <break> <prose> Deity and mantra two,
[24724] <prose> Mandala and offering two,
[24725] <prose> Concentration and conduct two,
[24726] <prose> Activity and view two, these ten complete, generation stage chief tantra. || 4300 ||
[24727] <prose> Perfection stage reading measure:
[24728] <prose> View and result two,
[24729] <prose> Conduct and meditation two,
[24730] <prose> Mind and wisdom two,
[24731] <prose> Experience and instruction two—these eight complete, perfection stage chief reading measure.
[24732] <prose> Non-dual union:
[24733] <prose> Both of these must be complete, eighteen.
[24734] <prose> Great Perfection complete:
[24735] <prose> Generation and perfection two, perfection stage,
[24736] <prose> Perfection stage: lesser elaboration showing channels-winds-bindus, || 4310 ||
[24737] <prose> Great showing clear light wisdom stage two,
[24738] <prose> Great: its reading measure, entering door, empowerment and samaya two,
[24739] <prose> Path and recitation two,
[24740] <prose> Result and five complete.
[24741] <prose> Example: like warp threads,
[24742] <prose> Depending on many cause threads, woven into cloth,
[24743] <prose> Depending on different words, revealing single meaning.
[24744] <prose> Proof: tantra abiding in oneself, showing indicator,
[24745] <prose> Therefore proven as tantra.
[24746] <prose> || 4320 ||
[24747] <prose> Moreover, depending on word-essential points, meaning-place without error decisively established, realizing, — therefore posited as tantra.
[24748] <prose> Second, detailed explanation of its nature, two aspects:
[24749] <prose> Detailed explanation of meaning tantra and word tantra.
[24750] <prose> The first, two aspects:
[24751] <prose> Method tantra
[24752] <break> <prose> and nature tantra.
[24753] <break> <ornament> First:
[24754] <prose> Awareness and pith instructions applying its meaning.
[24755] <prose> Divisions: indicated-method tantra
[24756] <prose> and indicating-method tantra, two aspects. || 4330 ||
[24757] <prose> First, essence:
[24758] <prose> Awareness pervading all beings, bodhicitta.
[24759] <prose> Definitive term: that very thing, indicated-meaning and realization-basis and liberation-method,
[24760] <prose> Therefore called indicated-method tantra.
[24761] <prose> Divisions:
[24762] <prose> emptiness
[24763] <prose> and clarity, two aspects.
[24764] <prose> Emptiness: awareness-essence empty of thing and mark dharmas in all, free from elaboration extremes, primordially abiding.
[24765] <prose> Clarity:
[24766] <break> <prose> || 4340 ||
[24767] <break> <prose> That clarity, not entirely empty, self-light five wisdoms' clear appearance,
[24768] <prose> Warmth and coolness and lightness,
[24769] <prose> Vast nature chief five elements primordially spontaneously complete,
[24770] <prose> Compassion's resonance unceasingly arising, awareness primordially pervading.
[24771] <prose> Moreover, awareness clarity-emptiness great wisdom pervading all beings,
[24772] <prose> Called indicated-method tantra.
[24773] <tantra> From the Pearl Garland:
[24774] <prose> All Buddhas' method tantra,
[24775] <prose> single ground essence distinction,
[24776] <prose> Indicated and indicating. || 4350 ||
[24777] <prose> Indicated tantra single pervader,
[24778] <prose> All connected as its following.
[24779] <prose> Pervasion has two aspects:
[24780] <prose> Emptiness pervasion and clarity pervasion.
[24781] <prose> Emptiness single cause without thing,
[24782] <prose> Transcending all things' dharmas.
[24783] <prose> Actual non-appearance single pervader,
[24784] <prose> All become basis single essence.
[24785] <prose> Pervader itself gathering.
[24786] <prose> Unborn mindfulness exhausted by || 4360 ||
[24787] <prose> essence distinction.
[24788] <prose> Empty and appearing, appearing and empty.
[24789] <prose> Actual and non-actual both.
[24790] <prose> Exhausted, — therefore primordially empty abiding.
[24791] <prose> Free from causes and conditions, empty object.
[24792] <prose> Pervading vast non-actual essence empty.
[24793] <prose> Stainless and unmixed complete.
[24794] <prose> Without concept empty nature.
[24795] <prose> Emptiness pervading, — therefore tantra.
[24796] <prose> Clear, nature not ceased. || 4370 ||
[24797] <prose> Illuminating appearance and pervader.
[24798] <prose> Clear and warmth and coolness.
[24799] <prose> Vast and moving essence holder.
[24800] <prose> Pervasion and self-resonance self-clear.
[24801] <prose> Liberating ripening seed.
[24802] <tantra> From emptiness reverse, — therefore clarity pervades.
[24803] <prose> Sudden and self-liberation.
[24804] <prose> Self-arisen clarity connected with body.
[24805] <prose> Stainless and individually clear.
[24806] <prose> Without grasping clear object appearing. || 4380 ||
[24807] <prose>
[24808] <prose> Looking far with clarity pervasion,
[24809] <prose> Binding the clear expanse of space.
[24810] <prose> Not cut off, pervading sphere.
[24811] <prose> Pervading essential points essential.
[24812] <prose> Signs of seeing completely liberated.
[24813] <break> <prose> Moving and pervading essential points.
[24814] <break> <prose> Spheres connected with body.
[24815] <prose> Pervading signs pervading essential points.
[24816] <prose> Reversing through pervasion. || 4390 ||
[24817] <prose> Here, seeing awareness like a chain,
[24818] <prose> Awareness' nature without good or bad, without change,
[24819] <prose> All from that state without other destination, — therefore called basis,
[24820] <prose> Other wandering impossible.
[24821] <prose> Moreover, awareness bound by wind essential point liberated sign,
[24822] <prose> Coming and going, existing,
[24823] <prose> Depending on bindu liberated sign, subtle bindu sphere existing,
[24824] <prose> Awareness depending on channel essential point liberated sign, chain subtle and curved connection existing.
[24825] <prose> These three, awareness not actual,
[24826] <prose> First instant distinction parted. || 4400 ||
