[1463] <tantra> From ten onward, some abandon the killing of life, and at that time the life span increases by twenty years.
[1464] <prose> Likewise, abandoning the taking of what is not given, forty years,
[1465] <prose> Abandoning misconduct, one hundred years,
[1466] <prose> Abandoning divisive speech, two hundred years,
[1467] <prose> Abandoning idle speech, five hundred years,
[1468] <prose> Abandoning harsh speech, one thousand years,
[1469] <prose> Abandoning covetousness, two thousand years,
[1470] <break> <prose> Abandoning harmful intent, ten thousand years, || 1470 ||
[1471] <break> <prose> Abandoning wrong view, twenty thousand years,
[1472] <prose> Abandoning ignorant attachment to desire, forty thousand years,
[1473] <prose> Abandoning wrong practice of dharma, eighty thousand years become the norm.
[1474] <prose> As life increases, so too form and enjoyment increase,
[1475] <prose> Spreading forth in prosperity.
[1476] <prose> Then again, eighteen sections of decrease and increase—each called an intermediate gap.
[1477] <prose> Third, the upward increase of one:
[1478] <tantra> From similar calculation, custom prevails after the completion of the intermediate gap.
[1479] <prose>
[1480] <prose> Called without beginning, long enduring, passing to countless ages, suddenly decreasing. || 1480 ||
[1481] <prose> Between these, from the light of beings' merit arise:
[1482] <prose> Virtue,
[1483] <prose> Buddha,
[1484] <prose> Dharma,
[1485] <prose> Sangha,
[1486] <prose> Where countless completely white dharma enumerations dwell,
[1487] <tantra> From non-merit arise:
[1488] <prose> Suffering, wrong paths,
[1489] <prose> Perverted teachers,
[1490] <prose> Enumerations of philosophical views, || 1490 ||
[1491] <prose> Actions, afflictions, and so forth,
[1492] <prose> The six classes of beings,
[1493] <prose> The four modes of birth,
[1494] <prose> Individual objects of light,
[1495] <prose> Enjoyment,
[1496] <prose> Engaging various pleasures and pains through light.
[1497] <prose> Then twenty intermediate eons of destruction:
[1498] <break> <tantra> From complete abiding, the light of change arises,
[1499] <break> <prose> That also: nineteen intermediate eons destroy the essence,
[1500] <prose> One destroys the vessel—twenty pass. || 1500 ||
[1501] <prose> The manner of beings' destruction:
[1502] <prose> Beginning from the hell realms, no new births arise in this world-forest,
[1503] <prose> Those transferred from old lives in hell, preta, and animal realms depart from this land,
[1504] <prose> Empty, new ones are not born—the lower realms are destroyed.
[1505] <prose> That also: certain births to new lower realms by misdeeds performed exist here, going to other lands' lower realms, empty, not born here.
[1506] <prose> Then humans are destroyed: gradually decreasing life span, dying by disease in an eon when life is ten years,
[1507] <prose> Passing through three small eons of harm by weapons and famine,
[1508] <prose> One human obtains concentration, two others without being taught by anyone on this Jambu continent,
[1509] <tantra> From that arising, speaking of extreme bliss, this joy arisen from seclusion,
[1510] <prose> Effortlessly heard by all, equipoise accomplished, born as a light god, || 1510 ||
[1511] <prose> Thus Jambu continent becomes empty,
[1512] <prose> The Body-Elevated continent and Cow-Enjoyment also become likewise.
[1513] <prose> Sound-Not-Heard becomes the abode of the Thirty-Three.
[1514] <prose>
[1515] <tantra> From the Four Great Kings to Great Brahmā, the pattern is likewise.
[1516] <prose> The vessel is destroyed: one sun arises, extremely hot in the sky, burning grass and trees.
[1517] <prose> Two arise, drying rivers, streams, and ponds.
[1518] <prose> Three arise, drying great rivers and streams.
[1519] <prose> Four arise, drying the never-warm lake.
[1520] <prose> Five arise, drying the great ocean. || 1520 ||
[1521] <prose> Six arise, drying the great land with snow-mountains.
[1522] <prose> Seven arise, burning all hundred ten-million spontaneously-arisen seven mountains and so forth,
[1523] <tantra> From swirling blazing flames,
[1524] <break> <prose> Below reaching the gold ground of the hell realm,
[1525] <break> <prose> Above thoroughly blazing between the world of Brahmā.
[1526] <prose> Seven times burned by all thorough blazing, not even ash remains.
[1527] <break> <prose> Seven suns and seven blazes, seven fires.
[1528] <break> <prose> Then below, the base of clear pure water is disturbed and scattered, pervading seven times the extent of the second concentration,
[1529] <prose> Destroyed with measureless palaces like salt dissolved in water.
[1530] <prose> That water seven times. || 1530 ||
[1531] <prose> Then below, a wind vajra-cross arises, all scattered, destroyed below the third concentration, becoming one sky.
[1532] <prose> Thus after the destruction of form's abiding, one nature sky remains empty.
[1533] <prose> That also: in the common vehicle likewise, twenty-eight tens of intermediate eons are regarded as one great eon.
[1534] <prose> The pure: birth, aging, sickness, and death—four that join inner form's destruction and emptiness.
[1535] <break> <tantra> From result-transmission,
[1536] <break> <prose> Meaning: destruction and form,
[1537] <prose> Abiding itself and emptiness,
[1538] <prose> Birth, aging, sickness, and death,
[1539] <prose> Existence's illusion-wheel itself.
[1540] <prose> Thus said, joined together. || 1540 ||
[1541] <prose> That also: from first measureless to the end ten, twenty with the first final gap,
[1542] <prose> Upward birth, downward decrease, not decreasing beyond ten—only that much,
[1543] <prose> Disease, weapons, and famine—each a small eon exists.
[1544] <prose>
[1545] <prose> Such is the final end.
[1546] <tantra> From that point, all vessels and essences are utterly destroyed.
[1547] <prose> These as well—the three abodes of destruction and emptiness—
[1548] <prose> In this uncommon vehicle, the intermediate eons are counted as equal: sixty by sixty, comprising the first great eon of one hundred eighty duration-measures.
[1549] <prose> The duration-eon of one hundred eighty is termed the "intermediate eon, the second."
[1550] <prose> The intermediate eon of one hundred eighty is considered the "single great eon." || 1550 ||
[1551] <prose> These also arise from the very nature of transformation.
[1552] <prose> This transformation of time unfolds as follows:
[1553] <tantra> From the primordial measureless beginning,
[1554] <tantra> Through the ten terminal intervals,
[1555] <tantra> There is ascent and descent, birth and diminishment.
[1556] <tantra> Disease, famine, weapons, and strife—
[1557] <tantra> Three lesser eons bridge the intervals.
[1558] <tantra> The sixty are exhausted by fire,
[1559] <tantra> Seven by fire, seven by water.
[1560] <tantra> Thus fourteen are completed, || 1560 ||
[1561] <tantra> And the remainder is dissolved by wind.
[1562] <tantra> Thus the sixty abide,
[1563] <tantra> And the duration of destruction is of similar measure.
[1564] <tantra> The interval of sixty abides as emptiness.
[1565] <tantra> Thus from one hundred eighty,
[1566] <tantra> The first duration-eon is established.
[1567] <tantra> Thus one hundred eighty
[1568] <tantra> Constitute the second intermediate eon.
[1569] <tantra> Thus that which is joined together is
[1570] <tantra> The single great eon. || 1570 ||
[1571] <tantra> Thus it is taught.
[1572] <prose> These detailed explanations with their definitive meanings are
[1573] <tantra> As extensively taught in the extensive Tantra of the wish-fulfilling tree.
[1574] <tantra> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[1575] <prose> The presentation of the world of vessels and essences, in two volumes.
[1576] <prose> Thus having instructed and shown the sequence of vessels and essences,
[1577] <ornament> Now, regarding the enumeration of phenomena and aggregates existing in the elements of those three vajra-states:
[1578] <tantra> From the Tantra of the union of sun and moon:
[1579] <prose> The elements, the aggregates,
[1580] <prose> The sense-sources, the powers, || 1580 ||
[1581] <prose> The objects and the awarenesses possessed of duration—
