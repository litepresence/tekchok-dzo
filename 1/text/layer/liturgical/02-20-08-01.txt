[29649] <prose> First, the essence of the mountain's general meaning intention is awareness of the nature of Great Perfection, luminosity without transfer or change, space and wisdom non-dual.
[29650] <prose> When realizing that by sense-faculty,
[29651] <prose> When space-awareness appears as field, view, intention, conduct, and fruit arise as four-fours for the best, middle, and last of the three sense-faculties of the person—thus twelve portions.
[29652] <tantra> From the Power-Perfect:
[29653] <tantra> At the time when the mountain's general meaning intention arises,
[29654] <tantra> Reach the end of the Great Perfection View.
[29655] <tantra> For the best, middle, and last of the three sense-faculties, three views arise.
[29656] <tantra> For the best sense-faculty, the view of wisdom-appearance spontaneously arising || 9230 ||
[29657] <tantra> Is realizing awareness of self's wisdom without realization together with body.
[29658] <tantra> At that time, intention is unmoving in clarity, like planets and stars arising on the ocean.
[29659] <tantra> Conduct is ceaseless power-arising conduct, like casting a sky-spear.
[29660] <tantra> Fruit is seeing the appearance of birthless self-arising.
[29661] <prose> The view of the middle sense-faculty
[29662] <prose> Realizes only self's awareness without birth.
[29663] <prose> Intention is free from conceptual portions, like flags attaching to the ocean.
[29664] <prose> Conduct is unblocked spontaneous conduct, like a mad-one.
[29665] <prose> Conduct without obstruction in any appearance.
[29666] <prose> Fruit: || 9240 ||
[29667] <prose> Endowed with intention of self-place, conquering signs.
[29668] <prose> The view of the last sense-faculty realizes this very appearance as like illusion or emanation.
[29669] <prose> Consequently, intention: demonstrating essence of self-appearance, understanding wisdom arising in the intermediate, like a lion-chick free from the womb-egg.
[29670] <prose> See interior wisdom obscured.
[29671] <prose> Conduct:
[29672] <prose> Endowed with conduct grasping saṃsāra-nirvāṇa two.
[29673] <prose> Fruit:
[29674] <prose> Having abandoned body, breath reaches the nature-emanation body's field. Thus it is spoken.
[29675] <prose> Second, the essence of wisdom's general filling intention:
[29676] <prose> Realizing awareness's power-empowerment perfected from the beginning. || 9250 ||
[29677] <prose> Different manners of realizing by three sense-faculties:
[29678] <tantra> From that same source:
[29679] <tantra> At the time when wisdom's general filling intention arises,
[29680] <tantra> Also, by the best, middle, and last of the three sense-faculties of the person, three view manners arise.
[29681] <tantra> The best sense-faculty realizes only by demonstrating birthless fruit as self-nature through empowerment.
[29682] <tantra> Intention:
[29683] <tantra> Through wisdom practice, spreading to bindu, unmoving from sky-equal great bliss intention.
[29684] <tantra> Conduct:
[29685] <tantra> Conduct without pure-impure in white-red awakening mind.
[29686] <tantra> Fruit: || 9260 ||
[29687] <tantra> Seeing suchness of Buddha-family ground.
[29688] <prose> The view of the middle sense-faculty
[29689] <prose> Realizes only appearance becoming awareness's power.
[29690] <prose> Intention:
[29691] <prose> Abides undistracted in clarity, like sun-moon pair relating.
[29692] <prose> Conduct:
[29693] <prose> Conducting in true dharmatā yogin manner.
[29694] <prose> Fruit:
[29695] <prose> Obtaining birth-deathless suchness.
[29696] <prose> The view of the last sense-faculty || 9270 ||
[29697] <prose> Realizes empowerment qualities all expanding and arising.
[29698] <prose> Intention:
[29699] <prose> Meditating relying on god-body with signs.

[29701] <prose> Conducting in dharmatā's display.
[29702] <prose> Fruit:
[29703] <prose> Obtaining Buddha through the gate of qualities. Thus it is spoken.
[29704] <prose> Third, the essence of bindu range-penetration intention:
[29705] <prose> Buddhahood through penetrating self-appearance's range by self-arising awareness wisdom of the intermediate, self-realizing.
[29706] <prose> Different by distinction of person's sense-faculty. || 9280 ||
[29707] <tantra> From that:
[29708] <tantra> At the time when bindu range-penetration intention arises,
[29709] <tantra> Also, for the best, middle, and last of three sense-faculties, three view-signs arise.
[29710] <tantra> The view of the best sense-faculty:
[29711] <tantra> Like a meteor moving in the sky,
[29712] <tantra> Arising as wisdom-power quality,
[29713] <tantra> Realizes liberation in three moments.
[29714] <tantra> Intention:
[29715] <tantra> Abides pervasive to all open clarity, like sun arising in space-between.
[29716] <tantra> Conduct: || 9290 ||
[29717] <tantra> Enjoys in pure complete wisdom-body.
[29718] <tantra> Fruit: Thus-come at primordially pure ground in three moments.
[29719] <prose> The view of the middle sense-faculty:
[29720] <prose> Realizes appearance of great leakless dharmatā bliss arising by gap.
[29721] <prose> Intention:
[29722] <prose> Seeing each special field of view in each moment,
[29723] <prose> Each special realization arises,
[29724] <prose> And seeing each dharmakāya appearance,
[29725] <prose> Abides in intention of heart's pure suchness.
[29726] <prose> Conduct: || 9300 ||
[29727] <prose> Conducts non-dual with self-heart's light-ray.
[29728] <prose> Fruit:
[29729] <prose> Seeing self-awareness's appearance as birthless dharmakāya.
[29730] <prose> The view of the last sense-faculty:
[29731] <prose> In pure wisdom appearance,
[29732] <prose> Did I arise from that,
[29733] <prose> Or did that arise from me—realizes thus thinking.
[29734] <prose> Intention:
[29735] <prose> Abides without seeing agent in that very appearance.
[29736] <prose> Conduct: || 9310 ||
[29737] <prose> Endowed with doubt and indecision conduct.
[29738] <prose> Fruit:
[29739] <prose> Obtaining fruit of breathing into nature-emanation body's field. Thus it is spoken.
[29740] <prose> Fourth, the essence of sun-moon equal gap intention:
[29741] <prose> Realizing appearance-emptiness as equality without ceasing.
[29742] <break> <prose> Separated individually by sense-faculty.
[29743] <break> <tantra> From the Power-Perfect:
[29744] <tantra> At the time when sun-moon equal gap intention penetrates expanse,
[29745] <tantra> For the best, middle, and last of three sense-faculties, three view-signs arise.
[29746] <tantra> The view of the best sense-faculty: || 9320 ||
[29747] <tantra> Realizes wisdom as open.
[29748] <tantra> Intention: not separate from wisdom river's channel without ceasing.
[29749] <tantra> Conduct:

[29751] <tantra> Fruit:
[29752] <tantra> Obtaining fruit of method and wisdom two practice and release two, four aspects without gathering or separation.
[29753] <prose> Also, three view-signs of the middle sense-faculty:
[29754] <prose> Realizes view without method and wisdom two.
[29755] <prose> Intention: abides in manner like sun-moon arising in space-between, nature of method and wisdom.

[29761] <prose> Intention:
[29762] <prose> Abides in clear samādhi manner, remembering god's nature heart-essence.
[29763] <prose> Conduct:
[29764] <prose> Conducts to five medicines, five nectars.
[29765] <prose> Fruit:
[29766] <prose> Seizing tutelary deity's illusory body in intermediate, || 9340 ||
[29767] <prose> Obtaining fruit of pure appearance. Thus it is spoken.
[29768] <prose> Fifth, the essence of ocean expanse-penetration intention:
[29769] <prose> Abiding in force-samādhi of nature as dharmatā equal-clear state.
[29770] <prose> Separated by individual sense-faculty.
[29771] <tantra> From the Power-Perfect:
[29772] <tantra> At the time of ocean expanse-penetration intention,
[29773] <tantra> Also, three view-signs arise for three sense-faculties.
[29774] <tantra> The view of the best sense-faculty:
[29775] <tantra> Realizes whatever appears by great wisdom's activity as self-appearance itself.
[29776] <tantra> Intention: || 9350 ||
[29777] <tantra> Like being intoxicated by alcohol with small attachment to appearance.
[29778] <tantra> Conduct:
[29779] <prose> Conducting in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[29780] <prose> Fruit: obtaining fruit of wisdom arising as one-cut not abiding in appearance.
[29781] <prose> Three view-signs of the middle sense-faculty:
[29782] <prose> Realizing view as clear-open wisdom-body.
[29783] <prose> Intention:
[29784] <prose> Endowed with fierce, short duration like waterfall.
[29785] <prose> Conduct:
[29786] <prose> Endowed with conduct-object like awareness-vision, not all's conduct-object. || 9360 ||
[29787] <prose> Fruit:
[29788] <prose> Obtaining certainty of reaching end to empty wisdom's heart-essence.
[29789] <prose> Three view-signs of the last sense-faculty:
[29790] <prose> View:
[29791] <prose> Desiring to abandon delusory appearance by gap.
[29792] <prose> Intention:
[29793] <prose> Abiding in god and human mind-holding.
[29794] <prose> Conduct:
[29795] <prose> Endowed with fabricated two-grasping conduct.
[29796] <prose> Fruit: || 9370 ||
[29797] <prose> Obtaining god and human status. Thus it is spoken.
[29798] <prose> Third, summarizing meaning by aspect:
[29799] <prose> These five intentions bind all secret heart-essence yogins.
[29800] <prose> Arising of yogin's experience:
[29801] <prose> By mountain general meaning, transcending view of Great Perfection without high-low, slack-tight equality.
[29802] <prose> By wisdom's general filling, grasp ground as self-abiding dharmatā in that manner.
[29803] <break> <prose> By bindu range-penetration, examine awareness's liberation manner from space-appearance.
[29804] <break> <prose> By sun-moon equal gap, deliver intention to Dharma-ceasing expanse.
[29805] <prose> By ocean expanse-penetration, stably hold ground at primordially pure ground of space-awareness.
[29806] <ornament> Also, first: like lion's play conquering fear of delusory appearance destruction, washed high by view. || 9380 ||
[29807] <ornament> Second: Like king-awareness empowerment obtaining self-power dharmatā.
[29808] <ornament> Third: Like peacock chick emerging from egg, reaching pure space.
[29809] <ornament> Fourth: Like equal sun-moon without two, expanding greatly all-equal vastness.
[29810] <ornament> Fifth: establishing supreme secret bindu meaning gathered in intention like sun arising from mountain neck, self-appearance clear as wisdom.
[29811] <tantra> From the Lion Power-Perfect:
[29812] <tantra> The intention of mountain's general meaning
[29813] <tantra> Is like lion's play.
[29814] <tantra> The intention of wisdom's general filling
[29815] <tantra> Is like empowerment from king's head.
[29816] <tantra> The intention of bindu's range-penetration is like peacock chick emerging from egg. || 9390 ||
[29817] <tantra> The intention of sun-moon equal gap is like entering equality without sun and moon two.
[29818] <tantra> The intention of ocean's expanse-penetration
[29819] <tantra> Is like sun arising from mountain's neck. Thus it is spoken.
[29820] <prose> Thus, dividing each of the five aspirations into three sense-faculties makes fifteen. Dividing each of these into view, intention, conduct, and fruit fours makes sixty Dharma enumerations—purifying sixty enumerations of eon's increase-decrease, sentient beings' affliction, and view.
[29821] <prose> Demonstrated as pure complete nature of wisdom experience, spoken by Vajra-Holder.
[29822] <tantra> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[29823] <prose> The twentieth chapter establishing the essential point of taking experience of spontaneous leap-over wisdom.
[29824] <prose> Thus having demonstrated all methods of taking experience through guidance method,
[29825] <break> <prose> Now extensively explaining the sequence of how to take experience through introduction has two aspects:
[29826] <break> <prose> Establishing all Dharmas by general introduction sequence, || 9400 ||
[29827] <prose> And extensively explaining mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction.
[29828] <prose> First, the preparation preceding introduction:
[29829] <tantra> From two actual introductions,
