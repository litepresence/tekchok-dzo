[23780] <ornament> First, training capacity with two instructions:
[23781] <prose> The points of illusory body and clear light during daytime, and
[23782] <prose> Becoming familiar with the manner of bardo arising,
[23783] <prose> Mastery in dreams is the definite measure of liberation in bardo.
[23784] <prose> If that is also summarized in one point:
[23785] <prose> Do not especially abandon existence.
[23786] <prose> Do not especially establish non-existence. || 3360 ||
[23787] <prose> Do not attach obviously to existence.
[23788] <prose> Do not perform sad thinking toward non-existence.
[23789] <prose> Whatever grasping-thought toward doing, good-bad, appearance-manner, and—
[23790] <prose> Do not cut the trace of the past.
[23791] <prose> Do not welcome the before of the future.
[23792] <prose> Without depending upon present propensities with antidote in the continuum,
[23793] <prose> Neither stretched nor relaxed,
[23794] <prose> Neither puffed nor slumped,
[23795] <prose> Neither hesitant nor rushing—
[23796] <prose> Through practicing in traceless mind-touch appearance, || 3370 ||
[23797] <prose> Liberating appearance through appearance-moment.
[23798] <break> <prose> Liberating grasping of things.
[23799] <break> <prose> That also: liberating through appearance-moment.
[23800] <prose> Like a bird leaving no trace.
[23801] <prose> Liberating movement through movement-moment.
[23802] <prose> Self-dissolving without trace.
[23803] <prose> That also: like hail dissolving in space.
[23804] <prose> Liberating appearance and consciousness as non-dual.
[23805] <prose> Without outer-inner divisions.
[23806] <prose> That also: like water dissolving in water. || 3380 ||
[23807] <prose> Thus realizing, cutting latency attachment, and
[23808] <tantra> From Klongchenpa's Six Vastnesses:
[23809] <prose> Whatever person does not cut the trace of the past,
[23810] <prose> Does not raise hope for the future,
[23811] <prose> If placing present consciousness in its place,
[23812] <prose> Mixing without before-after distinction,
[23813] <prose> Called the essence of one-gathered, the yogi realizes the equality of three times.
[23814] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23815] <ornament> Second, the actual bardo instruction:
[23816] <prose> Earth, water, fire, wind, and space gradually dissolving, and || 3390 ||
[23817] <prose> When space dissolves into clear light,
[23818] <prose> Upward Ha and downward A gathering at the heart, bliss-clear without thought—clear light.
[23819] <prose> Increase, and
[23820] <prose> Attainment, and
[23821] <prose> Four wisdoms: near-attainment, moment one, and
[23822] <prose> Two and three and
[23823] <prose> Arising as four, and
[23824] <prose> Yogins familiar with clear light before recognize that, clear light mother-child mixing, and
[23825] <prose> In a moment, upward transparent in the primordially pure dharmakāya dharmadhātu.
[23826] <prose> For those not recognizing there, in the existence bardo, medium senses arise, deity illusory-body appears, liberated. || 3400 ||
[23827] <prose> Finally continuing the good, and
[23828] <prose> Certainty of liberation meeting supreme dharma in the future.
[23829] <tantra> From the Magical Net:
[23830] <prose> Though not obtaining liberation in this birth,
[23831] <prose> Obtain liberation in the existence of another birth.
[23832] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23833] <prose> Also in the common path, those with faith in that-ness are explained as liberated in the future.
[23834] <tantra> From the Four-Eight:
[23835] <prose> If knowing that here,
[23836] <prose> Though not obtaining nirvāṇa, || 3410 ||
[23837] <prose> Without effort in another birth,
[23838] <prose> Like law, certainty of obtaining becomes.
[23839] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23840] <prose> With elaboration of those, Mahāyāna samādhi explained complete.
[23841] <ornament> Third, from two Sugata intentions:
[23842] <prose> Briefly teaching is:
[23843] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[23844] <prose> Sugata intention is:
[23845] <prose> Know within the sky expanse.
[23846] <prose> Also become familiar with that. || 3420 ||
[23847] <prose> Spontaneously arise wisdom appearance.
[23848] <prose> Correct path also thus.
[23849] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23850] <prose> Extensively explaining is:
[23851] <prose> Upon the sun-moon union.
[23852] <prose> Two Sugata intentions:
[23853] <break> <verse> Sensations cease by unmodified placement.
[23854] <break> <verse> Obtain warmth measure by unmeditated looking.
[23855] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23856] <prose> That also: dharmatā mother appearance, without hope or fear of spreading or gathering, great samādhi without post-meditation boundary, river-continuum yoga without gaps. || 3430 ||
[23857] <prose> Is becoming one in space without end or middle, without distraction or non-distraction, sky-nature.
[23858] <prose> At this time called daytime-nighttime union meditation:
[23859] <prose> Daytime: the portion of transcendence.
[23860] <prose> Nighttime: the portion of saṃsāra.
[23861] <prose> By arising without distinguishing daytime-nighttime difference,
[23862] <prose> Daytime meditation: no cause for clear experience.
[23863] <prose> Gradually gone: nighttime unclear not exist.
[23864] <prose> Two meanings: that instruction, ocean relax method.
[23865] <prose> Call ocean the essence of eye-water.
[23866] <prose> Called ocean relax by placing that unmoved. || 3440 ||
[23867] <prose> That also: do not meditate, do not meditate.
[23868] <prose> The point is gazing without blinking eye beyond meditation.
[23869] <prose> By doing thus, like the ocean unstained though grasping-objects nonexistent, appear-objects exist, spread relax, all whatever appear, reflection, planet-ocean example.
[23870] <prose> Though appear appearance face, outer appearance arise measure yogi eye path.
[23871] <prose> By unstained, grasping-object nonexistent, consciousness not losing appearance moment.
[23872] <prose> Outer appearance not staining consciousness.
[23873] <prose> Inner consciousness not grasping appearance.
[23874] <prose> Called spontaneous meditation six-aggregate, liberating grasping-object grasping-nonexistent, cutting relating appearance consciousness.
[23875] <prose> This actual meditation, and
[23876] <tantra> From two: cutting error places. || 3450 ||
[23877] <prose> Actual: gathering wind-mind point, putting consciousness self-place, is.
[23878] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[23879] <verse> Upon mind-settling called meditation,
[23880] <verse> Is cutting outer-inner movement.
[23881] <verse> Grasping and grasping cease.
[23882] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23883] <tantra> From Letter Nonexistent:

[23885] <prose> Mind unmodified appearance unchanged.
[23886] <prose> Show intention dwelling dharmatā sky. || 3460 ||
[23887] <prose> Abandoning all thought dharmakāya wisdom, and
[23888] <prose> Is meditation intention without doing.
[23889] <prose> If not holding focus direction,
[23890] <prose> Like planet arising in ocean,
[23891] <prose> Clear aspect without grasping not ceasing.
[23892] <prose> Intention dwelling manner thus.
[23893] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23894] <prose> Complete dharmatā relax intention that time.
[23895] <tantra> From Klongchenpa's Six Vastnesses:
[23896] <verse> Upon mind-itself pure existing, || 3470 ||
[23897] <verse> As self-pure all objects of five doors,
[23898] <verse> Like clear water undefiled.
[23899] <verse> Complete self-place all appearance.
[23900] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23901] <ornament> Second, cutting error places is:
[23902] <prose> If that also: going memory-non by ceasing six-aggregates.
[23903] <prose> Error place: going one direction shamatha.
[23904] <prose> Error place: going spread scattering.
[23905] <prose> Error place: not finding self-essence depth clear.
[23906] <prose> Error place: holding peg one-pointed. || 3480 ||
[23907] <prose> Know others from meditation: self-dwell without grasping, vast-liberated, self-clear awareness, briefly.
[23908] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[23909] <verse> Is meditation dwelling head,

[23914] <verse> Itself without existence loses outward.
[23915] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[23916] <prose> That also: appearance not staining consciousness. || 3490 ||
[23917] <prose> Consciousness not practicing appearance.
[23918] <prose> Without peg-holding one-pointed, clear half-essence nature.
[23919] <prose> Is self-arisen wisdom meditation: pervading pervading great self-liberated, vast vast clear.
[23920] <tantra> From that source:
[23921] <verse> Is appearance-manner meditation characteristic,
[23922] <verse> Upon awareness empty-clear characteristic,
[23923] <verse> Not mixing where nature,

[23926] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 3500 ||
[23927] <ornament> Is fault of non-meditation incidental:
[23928] <tantra> From that source:
[23929] <verse> Is itself fault of non-meditation,
[23930] <verse> By manifest appearance saṃsāra characteristic,

[23941] <prose> Therefore, strive in meditation.
[23942] <ornament> Third is dharmatā aim of appearance-existence ground rising:
[23943] <prose> Whatever appears made path before, investigating appearance, establishing ground,
[23944] <prose> Through liberating self-relax, reaching elaboration limit occasion this.
[23945] <prose> Reason: able to dwell upon that unmoving, dwell-manner upon thing ground.
[23946] <tantra> From Klongchenpa's Six Vastnesses: || 3520 ||
