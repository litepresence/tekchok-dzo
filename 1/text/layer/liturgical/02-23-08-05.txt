[35068] <ornament> The third, wherein that also sets:
[35069] <prose> Through recognizing self-face in the seeing of primordial purity's appearances, the Ground is established.
[35070] <prose> Those of sharp acumen are liberated in an instant among them,
[35071] <prose> while those of lesser acumen dwell long in the Realm, meditating for many days.
[35072] <prose> Like the swiftness of an arrow's flight,
[35073] <prose> like something slow,
[35074] <prose> like something extremely slow—such are their progressive departures.
[35075] <prose> The moment of consummate capacity's completion, within that:
[35076] <prose> Combined with six others' meditation days, recognition should be understood. || 14650 ||
[35077] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[35078] <verse> Some are liberated in three moments,
[35079] <verse> Some through the mirror sphere,
[35080] <verse> Some through father and mother,
[35081] <verse> Some through flickering and radiant light,
[35082] <verse> Arising in their own truth, thus liberated,
[35083] <verse> Some through compassionate radiance,
[35084] <verse> Some through two spheres,
[35085] <verse> Some through whatever appears, by Body liberated.
[35086] <verse> Such are the supreme liberation methods. || 14660 ||
[35087] <tantra> It is said, and:
[35088] <prose> Moreover, the consummation of supreme capacity:
[35089] <prose> In three moments becoming Buddha, from there Emanations naturally arise.
[35090] <prose> Also, in one moment:
[35091] <prose> The sphere-appearance ceases,
[35092] <prose> In one moment spontaneous presence's appearance ceases,
[35093] <prose> In one moment primordial purity's truth is seen.
[35094] <prose> Moreover, the Emanations are not separate from the ground of primordial purity.
[35095] <prose> Obtaining the suchness of all empowerments upon the Path,
[35096] <prose> Like a shooting star traversing space, || 14670 ||
[35097] <prose> That star, emitting radiance, likewise displays Emanations and accomplishes beings' benefit.
[35098] <prose> The benefit can be accomplished in three days.
[35099] <prose> The peak of supreme capacity:
[35100] <prose> Dwells in the intermediate state one day.
[35101] <prose> That also, seeing self-appearance in the appearance of the Four Jñanas conjunction,
[35102] <tantra> From one's eyes arising the two fires of jñana,
[35103] <prose> That shower of weapons all cease from,
[35104] <prose> Appearance arises without cessation,
[35105] <prose> There, awakening to self-knowing,
[35106] <prose> Seeing self-object, || 14680 ||
[35107] <prose> Finding certainty in spontaneous presence's ground,
[35108] <prose> Again, it should be known like a shooting star.
[35109] <prose> The supreme of supreme capacity:
[35110] <prose> In two days becomes Buddha,
[35111] <prose> That also, dwelling one day in sphere-appearance,
[35112] <tantra> From one's heart-center, the sun of jñana arises,
[35113] <tantra> From that, light rays spread to the ten directions.
[35114] <tantra> From that, upon each light ray's tip, one Tathāgata Body arises.
[35115] <prose> By that, all appearance objects are seen as Body's nature.
[35116] <prose> Then, finding certainty in spontaneous presence's appearance, Emanations can accomplish benefit in seven days. || 14690 ||
[35117] <prose> That also is like a shooting star.
[35118] <prose> The summit of supreme:
[35119] <prose> Dwells three days in the intermediate state.
[35120] <prose> That also, dwelling one day in the sphere,
[35121] <prose> In that, finding certainty, from jñana's appearance a portion of self-appearance arises.
[35122] <prose> That also dwells two days.
[35123] <prose> The first day, light is seen.
[35124] <prose> The second day, Body is seen.
[35125] <prose> That Body is seen as vast and coarse.
[35126] <prose> Having faith in that, finding certainty in spontaneous presence's ground. || 14700 ||
[35127] <prose> That also should be known like a shooting star.
[35128] <prose> Emanations also can accomplish benefit in eleven days.
[35129] <prose> The supreme of supreme:
[35130] <prose> Dwells four days in the intermediate state.
[35131] <prose> That also, seeing five spheres clearly arrayed before oneself,
[35132] <prose> In that, awakening to self-propensities, dwells one day in the eastern sphere.
[35133] <prose> Likewise dwells one day in each of the four directional spheres.
[35134] <prose> Then, finding certainty in spontaneous presence, becomes Buddha.
[35135] <prose> Emanations can accomplish benefit in fourteen days.
[35136] <prose> The middling of supreme capacity: || 14710 ||
[35137] <prose> Sees after some days.
[35138] <prose> Sees after five days.
[35139] <prose> That is as follows:
[35140] <prose> Four days dwell in the sphere.
[35141] <prose> One day dwell in jñana's appearance.
[35142] <prose> That also, from one's heart-center, light rays arise like horse-drums,
[35143] <prose> That also stands upright in space's expanse.
[35144] <prose> There, holding one's eyes unwavering and gazing,
[35145] <prose> Seeing that one great sphere clearly arrayed in space's center,
[35146] <prose> Faith arises intensely in that. || 14720 ||
[35147] <prose> Arising the knowing "This is mine,"
[35148] <prose> This is called the instruction "Confidence placing the child in the mother's lap."
[35149] <prose> Then, into that, self-awareness gradually dissolving,
[35150] <prose> This is called the instruction "Irreversible arrow of great scope."
[35151] <prose> Emanations also can accomplish benefit in twenty-one days.
[35152] <prose> The least of supreme capacity:
[35153] <prose> Takes six days.
[35154] <prose> That also, taking four days in the sphere,
[35155] <prose> Taking one day in jñana's appearance and Dharmadhātu,
[35156] <prose> Likewise taking one day in mirror-like, || 14730 ||
[35157] <prose> Then from one's two eyes, two clear jñana mirrors arise intensely,
[35158] <tantra> From that, immeasurable appearances spread forth.
[35159] <prose> One sees above oneself as one sphere.
[35160] <prose> One sees before oneself also as one great sphere.
[35161] <prose> Then, obtaining certainty, becomes Buddha.
[35162] <prose> Emanations can accomplish benefit in twenty-five days, it is said.
[35163] <prose> Also, in three moments, each capacity's days differ, liberating in primordial purity's appearance,
[35164] <prose> Obtaining irreversible certainty.
[35165] <prose> When dissolution is incomplete, Emanations separate;
[35166] <prose> However many days Emanations separate, that long dwelling in the Realm, || 14740 ||
[35167] <break> <prose> Then Emanations also, like rays gathering at sunset,
[35168] <break> <prose> Gather into Awareness and dissolve into primordial purity's ground.
[35169] <prose> If analyzed with subtle prajñā, there is one great essential point to be understood here.
[35170] <prose> Second, the liberation method of seven middling capacities is five moments.
[35171] <tantra> From the Blazing Body Relic:
[35172] <verse> In the intermediate state of Dharmatā,
[35173] <verse> Liberation occurs in a moment.
[35174] <prose> Thus explained, so:
[35175] <prose> In the first moment, self-appearance individually arises.
