[25695] <verse> "Arrive" means there is no place beyond that—complete manifestation.
[25696] <prose> These are like the form of the full moon, || 5270 ||
[25697] <prose> The mandala complete through the waxing and waning, without fabrication upon self-essence.
[25698] <prose> Second, the explanation of the three measures in particular has three parts:
[25699] <prose> Outer visions,
[25700] <prose> Inner body measure,
[25701] <prose> Secret awareness measure.
[25702] <prose> The first is controlling the visions and the completion of the realms in luminous clarity.
[25703] <prose>
[25704] <prose>
[25705] <prose>
[25706] <prose> || 5280 ||
[25707] <prose>
[25708] <prose>
[25709] <prose>
[25710] <prose>
[25711] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur:
[25712] <prose> The measure of completion having thus arrived—
[25713] <prose> Direct objective visions cease,
[25714] <prose> The vision of earth and stones melts away,
[25715] <prose> Self-knowing enters into everything,
[25716] <prose> Inert things move when directed, || 5290 ||
[25717] <prose> The measure of wind's movement is grasped,
[25718] <prose> The body's dust-particles become visible.
[25719] <prose> Whatever appears becomes complete as form-bodies,
[25720] <tantra> From that fathers and mothers embrace,
[25721] <prose> The five and five fathers and mothers unite,
[25722] <prose> All within the round periphery—
[25723] <prose> The yogin's body also luminous,
[25724] <prose> Appearing to go, come, and sit.
[25725] <prose> All is awareness arriving at its measure.
[25726] <ornament> Second: || 5300 ||
[25727] <prose> Purifying the dust of the body, from the heart center, white A. Five light-rays coil like the sun's reflection in the heart-window, piercing into the light-star-window within the intermediate space.
[25728] <prose> Rising through the crown, wisdom wind abides, appearing naturally uplifted.
[25729] <tantra> From the urna, five light-rays, one fathom, shine clearly.
[25730] <prose> Upon the five fingers of the hand, five lights garland and coil.
[25731] <prose> Through the doors of the body's pores and so forth, outer and inner parts smaller than the scope of dust-particles, each containing numberless lands and realms. Measureless Buddhas and beings appear. These are all visions of the spontaneously accomplished eight doors dawning here, appearing to self-vision without excess or lack.
[25732] <prose> In the crown-palace, the wrathful mandala; in the heart, the peaceful mandala.
[25733] <prose> In all parts of the body, natural emanations,
[25734] <prose> Emanations taming beings,
[25735] <prose> Various emanations appear, doing the benefit of self-vision beings in Buddha-fields.
[25736] <prose> Through the door of compassion, the six clairvoyances and || 5310 ||
[25737] <prose> The wisdom knowing all dharmas dawn.
[25738] <prose> Through the door of pure wisdom, the pure Buddha-fields complete as self-vision Sambhogakāya.
[25739] <prose> The mind's defilements purified, obtaining the separation from dust and doubt,
[25740] <prose> The latencies of ground and grounds self-purify. From the Thal 'gyur:
[25741] <prose>
[25742] <prose> The body arriving at measure also becomes thus:
[25743] <prose> Free from the dust of individual bodies,
[25744] <prose> The light-star-window of intermediate space appears.
[25745] <prose> Then light-rays in the shape of hooks,
[25746] <prose> Subtle and coiling, hold the vision. || 5320 ||
[25747] <prose> The body's dust naturally ceasing,
[25748] <prose> The transparent stainless light-body.
[25749] <prose> The A mark in the center,
[25750] <prose> And the urna's light-ray, one fathom measure.
[25751] <prose> The crown-uspa lifted by wind, appearing.
[25752] <tantra> From the peaceful body's fingers,
[25753] <prose> Light-garlands coil in form.
[25754] <prose> Activity of silent mind,
[25755] <tantra> From the skull palace of the head,
[25756] <prose> Herukas manifestly arise. || 5330 ||
[25757] <prose> At this time, the self-body arrives at measure—
[25758] <prose> The transparent three bodies coil as one.
[25759] <prose> Third, the secret awareness measure:
[25760] <prose> Although the subtle and coarse moving mind is purified,
[25761] <prose> There exists merely the Kunzhi consciousness mind,
[25762] <prose> Dawn of awareness qualities, clairvoyance and unobstructed eye.
[25763] <tantra> From that itself:
[25764] <prose> At this time the mind is clear,
[25765] <prose> Together with the six clairvoyances,
[25766] <prose> Far and concealed || 5340 ||
[25767] <prose> Dharmas become known in a moment.
[25768] <prose> Measureless Buddha-realms and
[25769] <prose> Likewise bodies appear to mind.
[25770] <prose> Defilements exhaust in empty mind,
[25771] <prose> Nature unmoving obtains empty-luminosity.
[25772] <prose> Unmixed equal-complete pervades the expanse,
[25773] <prose> Through manifest clarity, not separate from the many.
[25774] <prose> Without parts, without elaboration.
[25775] <prose> That also: in the two upper visions, purifying the manifest defilements of affliction-mind and mind-consciousness,
[25776] <prose> At the time of obtaining this, through the purity of the first seven of the eight collections, || 5350 ||
[25777] <prose> Free from subtle and coarse defilements,
[25778] <prose> The body-mind connection cut,
[25779] <prose> Outer visions' objects appear to awareness.
[25780] <prose> The investigating agent consciousness part, acting as self-condition through the power of Kunzhi consciousness,
[25781] <prose> Like a shooting star moving in the sky, the momentary investigating agent self-dawning, self-freeing, pure without looking to separate antidotes.
[25782] <prose>
[25783] <prose>
[25784] <prose> At the time of the two upper visions, wind is thrown outward and not held inward,
[25785] <prose> Arising through the ability to purify conceptuality not abiding in two moments,
[25786] <prose> The body transparent, || 5360 ||
[25787] <prose> The Kunzhi consciousness part clear-vivid like fire-sparks of concept-free object-awareness emitting.
[25788] <prose> Seeing the two aspects of outer extending vision and inner self-vision, body and mind separate and cut,
[25789] <prose> Accomplishing the great mandala, the supreme ground of not returning outward to the three realms.
[25790] <prose> Again from the Thal 'gyur:
[25791] <prose> At all times of such vision,
[25792] <prose> The cutting of body-mind connection,
[25793] <tantra> From the contaminated exhausted body also,
[25794] <prose> The mind with clear characteristics arising outward,
[25795] <prose> Like a shooting star emitting,
[25796] <prose> Clearly seen in the realm of space. || 5370 ||
[25797] <prose> At the first times of that itself,
[25798] <tantra> From separation from wind also,
[25799] <prose> Through the action of pure wind, effortful,
[25800] <prose> Arising from throwing outward from the body.
[25801] <tantra> From the part of the two see-agents also,
[25802] <prose> The body luminous and pure,
[25803] <prose> The mind like fire-sparks emitting,
[25804] <prose> Not abiding as one, self-clear ground,
[25805] <prose> Arising in the manner of two vision aspects.
[25806] <prose> Through this, having cut body-mind connection, || 5380 ||
[25807] <prose> There is no returning to the three realms.
[25808] <prose> At this time, the see-agent also, like a shooting star or fire-sparks, the Kunzhi consciousness part,
[25809] <prose> Together with the compassion-wisdom part of awareness,
[25810] <prose> Arise as the wisdom part seeing the two outer and inner objects.
[25811] <prose> At this time there is no intentionally setting gaze manner etc. through antidote,
[25812] <prose> For one never passes beyond the wheel of dharmatā.
[25813] <prose> This is called "completion of practice measure."
[25814] <prose> Fourth, the dharmatā-exhausting vision has two parts:
[25815] <prose> Brief showing of exhaustion manner, and
[25816] <prose> Extensive explanation of nature. || 5390 ||
[25817] <ornament> First:
[25818] <tantra> From the vision like the full moon of previous measure-arrival,
[25819] <prose> The manner of self-resonance dissolving into the expanse,
[25820] <prose> Like the moon waning from that,
[25821] <prose> Again that body fading until reaching the bindu, certain vision to the first mind.
[25822] <prose> That applies in sequence to the manner of purifying the four visions through the fourfold sequence of container-contents' arising, abiding, destruction, and emptiness.
[25823] <prose>
[25824] <prose> Similar to the increase and decrease of the four—birth, aging, sickness, and death—
[25825] <prose> The outer container's arising manner dissolves, and
[25826] <prose> The inner contents' beings' life measure rising and || 5400 ||
[25827] <prose> Waning downward—the sign of exhaustion.
[25828] <prose> If these do not exhaust, the self is not free from the three realms.
[25829] <prose> Thus, through the exhaustion of the outer container world,
[25830] <prose> Support-ground not existing,
[25831] <prose> The vital point of no ground of return.
[25832] <prose> Through the exhaustion of inner contents' beings, the birth continuum cut,
[25833] <prose> Now awareness itself is separate from death.
[25834] <prose> Then, whatever essence vision may have, there is no establishment,
[25835] <prose> Difficult to express as "this is" or "this is not,"
[25836] <prose> Therefore called "dharmatā exhaustion"—the meaningful result. || 5410 ||
[25837] <prose> The result: difficult for a person to express "this is" or "this is not," for it is inconceivable.
[25838] <prose> Moreover, dharma exhaustion: at the time of measure-arrival, the dharmas of outer objects, inner body, together with dust, exhausted—here, the dharmas included by the Kunzhi consciousness mind exhausted,
[25839] <prose> And purifying the root non-awareness that abides as the dharmatā of the three doors of the Kunzhi part.
[25840] <prose> Depending upon the dharmas of delusion,
[25841] <prose> That luminosity of vision without arising or destruction, abiding as ultimate dharmatā,
[25842] <prose> Through the exhaustion of those two dharmatas, is called "dharmatā exhaustion."
[25843] <prose> Vision: when that previous spontaneously accomplished vision, existing, dissolves inward, part by part going,
[25844] <prose> The primordially pure vision, like a cloudless sky, momentarily abiding naturally pure, is called "vision"—
[25845] <prose> Not like vision as entity and characteristic.
[25846] <prose> At this time, there is no reference even to mere dharmas—dharmatā exhaustion. || 5420 ||
[25847] <prose> The dharma-possessor object and
[25848] <prose> The dharmatā's emptiness, the holding part, included by the object-possessor,
[25849] <prose> The time of return of the three realms' mind, mental-events, together with Kunzhi.
[25850] <prose> The manner of exhaustion:
[25851] <prose> Gradual and
[25852] <prose> Instantaneous, from the two.
[25853] <prose> Gradual exhaustion is at the time of the four visions arriving at measure.
[25854] <prose> Instantaneous exhaustion is through habituating having seen dharmatā manifestly at first.
[25855] <prose> There is also exhaustion without the arising of visions of increasing experience and so forth—
[25856] <prose> This is called "supreme instantaneous mind." || 5430 ||
[25857] <prose> Moreover, merely through each act of respect for the guru, greater than others, possessed of the potential of previously purified action—such an exhaustion manner merely exists.
[25858] <prose> Second, the extensive explanation of nature has five parts:
[25859] <prose> Essence,
[25860] <break> <prose> Definition,
[25861] <break> <prose> Nature,
[25862] <break> <prose> dharmatā,
[25863] <break> <prose> Boundary.
[25864] <prose> The essence of dharmatā exhaustion:
[25865] <prose> Outer lights-five vision, together with bodies, exhausted;
[25866] <prose> Inner dust, together with concepts and aggregates, exhausted; || 5440 ||
[25867] <prose> Experience vision objects exhausted,
[25868] <prose> Awareness abiding in a manner like the sky, the primordially pure vision.
[25869] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur:
[25870] <prose> The vision of dharmatā exhaustion—
[25871] <prose> Experience vision emptying,
[25872] <prose> Body exhausted, sense objects also exhausted,
[25873] <prose> Free from concepts, aggregates, and delusion,
[25874] <prose> Separate from words of expressive ground.
[25875] <prose> Definition:
[25876] <verse> "Dharma" means the dharmas of body, speech, and mind aggregates, together with afflictions. || 5450 ||
[25877] <verse> "Itself" is together with the part of meditating the luminosity vision of the purifying path.
[25878] <verse> "Exhaust" is "empty,"
[25879] <prose> Mind's meditation, together with object-vision, self-reversing, not existing—
[25880] <prose> Called "non-observation."
[25881] <tantra> From that itself:
[25882] <prose> Thus the certain definition of dharmatā—
[25883] <break> <prose> To the gathering of dharma-knowing aggregates,
[25884] <break> <prose> Doing actions and holding characteristics,
[25885] <prose> Making self-vision empty,
[25886] <prose> Holding individual families. || 5460 ||
[25887] <verse> "Itself" is to the unfabricated,
[25888] <prose> Pervading the real through natural abiding,
[25889] <prose> To the unfabricated, original, continuous,
[25890] <prose> Exhausting the numbers of sounds, words, and names.
[25891] <prose> Nature:
[25892] <prose> Outer and inner vision-mind exhausted, activity merely upon primordially pure self-resonance like the resonance of blue-grey sky.
[25893] <tantra> From the Rtsal rdzogs:
[25894] <prose> At this time, the characteristic of exhaustion—
[25895] <prose> Like the sky, free from action.
[25896] <prose> dharmatā has two parts: || 5470 ||
[25897] <prose> The dharmatā of vision:
[25898] <prose> Through the exhaustion of outer and inner dust, channels and winds exhaust.
[25899] <prose> Through that exhaustion, the subtle defilements, the seed-parts of latencies depending upon mind, with the characteristic of arising from all, also exhaust.
[25900] <prose>
[25901] <prose>
[25902] <prose>
[25903] <prose> Abiding in the samadhi of continuity, not passing beyond the wheel of dharmatā,
[25904] <prose> Controlling the great eye and clairvoyance, obtaining the power as regent of the dharma king of the three realms.
[25905] <prose> Thus, the Kunzhi subtle knowable obscurations very cut—except for being cut by merely a white silk curtain, there are no obscurations.
[25906] <prose> This is called "the result of path dharmas exhaustion." || 5480 ||
[25907] <prose> Having cleared that, separation from all Buddha-obscurations, entering the primordially pure Dharmakāya of the inner expanse, the very peace.
[25908] <tantra> From the Thal 'gyur:
[25909] <prose> The dharmatā of self-Buddha cessation:
[25910] <break> <prose> Elements ceasing, dust ceases,
[25911] <break> <prose> Dust and particles ultimately cease,
[25912] <prose> Not even a mere part abides.
[25913] <prose> Afflictions ceasing, delusion and
[25914] <prose> Concept-free attachment not abiding,
[25915] <prose> Latencies and all-arising
[25916] <prose> Not even dust-parts abide. || 5490 ||
[25917] <prose> Thus through subtle and coarse cessation,
[25918] <prose> The five aggregates also gradually subtle at the end,
[25919] <prose> The body of four elements exhausted,
[25920] <prose> All is wisdom, Sambhogakāya.
[25921] <prose> Concept-free samadhi self-abiding,
[25922] <prose> Having exceeded the aggregates of fabrication,
[25923] <verse> "Dharma" does not abide in words.
[25924] <prose> The empty dharmatā:
[25925] <prose> Through the exhaustion of coarse channels and winds, mind and mental-events exhaust.
[25926] <prose> The vision aspect of body and wisdom, like the measure-arrived full moon, also setting into the inner expanse, abiding in primordially pure vision, || 5500 ||
[25927] <prose> This is expressed as "the Dharmakāya vision, the core result dharmatā, self-vision."
[25928] <prose> Again from the previous:
[25929] <prose> The dharmatā of cause and result:
[25930] <prose> Coarse conceptuality source ceasing,
[25931] <prose> Memory self-pure from the continuum also,
[25932] <prose> Dependent-arising wind itself fully pure,
[25933] <prose> The dharmatā arising from cause.
[25934] <prose> To the primordially pure nature,
[25935] <prose> The numbers of one and many exhaust,
[25936] <prose> Body and wisdom non-existent, || 5510 ||
[25937] <prose> Arriving at the ground of exhausted dharmas—
[25938] <prose> Considered to be the result dharmatā.
[25939] <ornament> Moreover, delusion regarding these three later words.
[25940] <prose>
[25941] <prose>
[25942] <prose> Nyingtigpas who think that in the result primordially pure there is no body and wisdom having arisen—
[25943] <prose> That is a great error.
[25944] <prose> They have not understood the intention of that being said regarding the part like the resonance body and wisdom of outer vision, crystal light returning inward.
[25945] <prose> If in meaning there is nothing in the inner expanse, it contradicts spontaneous accomplishment;
[25946] <prose> Being unconditioned, it contradicts going to complete non-existence in the future; || 5520 ||
[25947] <prose> It contradicts the arising of benefit for beings from the ground of dawn of body and wisdom from the expanse;
[25948] <prose> It contradicts Samantabhadra, having arrived at the end of pure ground expanse, showing the compassion and action of showing the path to beings and Buddhas—such faults exist in great number.
[25949] <prose> Such faults are not suitable to accept.
[25950] <prose> Fifth, the boundary:
[25951] <prose> At the time of beginning exhaustion from the measure-arrived curtain, there merely exists the clarity of five lights in the fingers of one's own four hands and feet,
[25952] <prose> The occasion from which there is outward entry into the inner expanse and
[25953] <prose> The boundary of inward return to outer vision.
[25954] <prose> Moreover, although that body form does not actually arise extensively as benefit for beings at this time,
[25955] <prose> Focusing awareness upon the light of the fingers,
[25956] <prose> Outer visions and || 5530 ||
[25957] <prose> The luminosity of one's own body increasingly dissolve and go into the inner expanse,
[25958] <tantra> From merely the pure blue of direct objective vision,
[25959] <prose> Like light-body fading and crystal light dissolving inward,
[25960] <prose> The self-resonance of body and vision also reverses,
[25961] <prose> Awareness abiding merely upon the depth resonance of body and wisdom within the shell of inner clear spontaneously accomplished jewel,
[25962] <prose> Like a shadow abiding in the self-lucidity of a crystal mirror, without even a mere part of vision in the blue of outer vision,
[25963] <prose> Awareness Buddha-fied into Dharmakāya, coiled.
[25964] <prose> If returning inward to outer vision, the sign that that body does not accomplish the equal of Buddha action,
[25965] <prose> Moreover, through control of birth and entry, awareness focusing compassion upon beings, that primordially pure vision without anything, self-reversing.
[25966] <prose> This vision of delusion-vision appears like a mirror's reflection, || 5540 ||
[25967] <prose> And that self-body also, like the moon in water, self-appears as wisdom illusory body through transparent, free from elemental harm, obtaining the vajra body—
[25968] <prose> Called "arising as the great transfer body for the benefit of beings."
[25969] <prose> Others' impure eyes see merely dust together, not the transparent—
[25970] <prose> Like the great master Vimala and
[25971] <prose> Padma.
[25972] <prose> Then, having obtained control over birth and entry,
[25973] <prose> Although Buddha-fied in a moment, there is delay,
[25974] <prose> Yet doing the benefit of beings until saṃsāra is not empty, possessing self-power.
[25975] <prose> Control over birth:
[25976] <prose> At the occasion of entering the inner expanse, entering awareness into three thousand beings, obtaining the great power to free all simultaneously, || 5550 ||
[25977] <prose> Even insects cease into light.
[25978] <prose> Having obtained control over birth, emanating whatever is desired, spontaneously accomplishing the benefit of beings.
[25979] <prose> Control over entry:
[25980] <prose> Although entering awareness into inert things, making them move and emit sound,
[25981] <prose> Through the dharma sound arising from lotus, wishing tree, jewel, and so forth, ripening all beings,
[25982] <prose> Making rain of food and clothes.
[25983] <prose> Moreover, having obtained these two controls over birth and entry following exhaustion at the occasion not-there of entering the inner expanse,
[25984] <prose> If not returning inward for beings' benefit, having made three thousand beings in the bardo free instantaneously, entering the expanse;
[25985] <prose> If doing, through control over birth, returning inward, gradually making three thousand free,
[25986] <prose> Doing whatever benefit for beings through many births and entries for kalpas numbering the dust of fields. || 5560 ||
[25987] <prose> Through earth treasures,
[25988] <prose> Jewels,
[25989] <prose> Dharma classifications, and so forth—although benefit may be accomplished after a long time, there is not even a moment's passing in that means,
[25990] <prose> For compassion wonder arises from others and activity vision enters.
[25991] <prose> Those relying upon our holy gurus Vimala and Padmakara, such very sublime ones, are certain to be liberated without doubt in this life or the bardo.
[25992] <tantra> This manner from the Guhyasamaja Seed Tantra:
[25993] <prose> When arriving at the ground of inner body exhaustion,
[25994] <prose> Fingers and so forth appear thus.
[25995] <prose> Focusing this, elements naturally cease.
[25996] <prose> Through the difference of birth and entry, || 5570 ||
[25997] <prose> Upon the self-ground of all dharmas exhausted,
[25998] <prose> Without holding anything whatsoever,
[25999] <prose> One abides—this is the emanation body.
[26000] <prose> Through this, the power of entry's force,
[26001] <prose> Who has obtained self-power over birth,
[26002] <prose> Also focusing upon that,
[26003] <prose> Again at times doing thus,
[26004] <prose> The self-sound of vision rustling,
[26005] <prose> Manifestly reverses, appearing as delusion.
[26006] <prose> Through this, doing all benefit for beings, || 5580 ||
[26007] <prose> For awareness is equal and one,
[26008] <prose> The great transfer of three thousand
[26009] <prose> Beings is accomplished by this.
[26010] <prose> Thus through gradual and instantaneous,
[26011] <prose> The body is accomplished by this.
[26012] <prose> All that is free from body-exhaustion measure.
[26013] <prose> All this, certain result,
[26014] <prose> Accomplishes the great mandala, supreme ground.
[26015] <prose> Thus the dawning of the four visions is called "the sequence of path-arising"—
[26016] <prose> Like the rungs of a ladder. || 5590 ||
