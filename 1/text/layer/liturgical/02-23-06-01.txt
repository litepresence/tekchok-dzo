[34127] <prose> At first, when the light rays expand, they extend outward.
[34128] <break> <prose> When they dissolve, they withdraw inward and enter.
[34129] <prose> The oral instruction is that these lights resemble silk.
[34130] <prose> They dissolve into the heart center of the self-knowing mother, like a child entering the lap.
[34131] <prose> Through blending into Dharmatā, liberation upon the ground of primordial purity occurs.
[34132] <prose> These can also be correlated with definitive scripture.
[34133] <tantra> From the Sun and Moon Union.
[34134] <prose> This is called the dissolution of the person's clear light into the wisdom of union.
[34135] <prose> Furthermore, these appearances arise as the spontaneous presence of Buddha-body.
[34136] <prose> Those Buddha-bodies are neither large. || 13710 ||
[34137] <prose> Nor are they small.
[34138] <prose> They are equal in size with ornaments.
[34139] <prose> With colors.
[34140] <prose> With postures.
[34141] <prose> With thrones and seats.
[34142] <prose> And with their respective mudrās.
[34143] <prose> All those Buddha-bodies are pervaded by pairs of fivefold ones.
[34144] <prose> Each set of five is surrounded by a halo of light.
[34145] <prose> With the families holding the father aspect.
[34146] <prose> And the families holding the mother aspect. || 13720 ||
[34147] <prose> With heroes.
[34148] <prose> With heroines.
[34149] <prose> All maṇḍalas are complete and present as one.
[34150] <prose> At that time, from one's own heart center, extremely subtle light arises.
[34151] <prose> It connects to the hearts of all the Buddha-bodies and illuminates.
[34152] <prose> One's own awareness cognizes this.
[34153] <prose> One naturally abides in non-conceptual samādhi.
[34154] <prose> This is called the entry of awareness into light.
[34155] <prose> All those appearances become extremely radiant.
[34156] <prose> Upon that light thread from the heart, countless tiny bindus arise. || 13730 ||
[34157] <prose> Moreover, then again, from one's own heart center, a light ray thread arises like a twisted thread.
[34158] <prose> Then the appearance arises that all those Buddha-bodies are dissolving into one's own body.
[34159] <prose> This is called the entry of light into awareness.
[34160] <prose> At this time, practitioners should remember the supreme method like a child entering the mother's lap.
[34161] <prose> The third, the appearance of the preparation of the Four Wisdoms, is called the dissolution into the wisdom of union.
[34162] <tantra> From both the manner of appearance and the manner of remembering the instruction.
[34163] <prose> The appearance is that again from the heart center — about four finger-widths above — a very subtle light appears, slightly less clear than before, a thread of four swirling colors, extremely subtle like a horse's ear hair.
[34164] <prose> It appears to pierce upward into the sky.
[34165] <prose> When gazed upon with the eye of wisdom.
[34166] <tantra> From that subtle appearance, it expands greatly, becoming distinct and extensive. || 13740 ||
[34167] <prose> While the essence of that initial subtlety does not change, the form expands greatly.
[34168] <prose> A deep blue silk cloth, of a size within the range of one's own sense faculty.
[34169] <prose> Appears in front, not mixed with other colors.
[34170] <prose> This is the appearance of the Dharmadhātu wisdom.
[34171] <prose> Above that, the essence of the Dharmadhātu wisdom's own nature, a bindu ray that is white.
[34172] <prose> Red.
[34173] <prose> Yellow.
[34174] <prose> And deep blue, possessing four.
[34175] <prose> The size is like an inverted mirror, with five lights extremely clear.
[34176] <prose> Radiating with the light rays of wisdom. || 13750 ||
[34177] <prose> The essence possesses the self-perfected dynamic power of the five wisdoms.
[34178] <prose> That bindu is naturally a bindu endowed with five lights.
[34179] <prose> As small as a mustard seed, adorned with five bindus in the four directions and center.
[34180] <prose> This is the own nature of the Dharmadhātu wisdom.
[34181] <prose> That essence is also included within knowable phenomena with specific and general characteristics.
[34182] <prose> And experienced phenomena that are made manifest.
[34183] <prose> The dhātu is also the outer dhātu of empty sky, not existing as a substance.
[34184] <prose> And the inner dhātu of pure luminosity appearing directly.
[34185] <prose> Wisdom is the primordially existing meaning that becomes manifest at that time and is known.
[34186] <prose> Therefore it is the wisdom that holds characteristics. || 13760 ||
[34187] <prose> Colors.
[34188] <prose> Buddha-bodies.
[34189] <prose> And does not abandon the characteristics of the Dharmatā of each.
[34190] <prose> Then above that, without touching or mixing with that, a deep white silk cloth of mirror-like wisdom appears.
[34191] <prose> Equal in size to the sense faculty's range, radiating and distinct from others.
[34192] <prose> Upon which a bindu of five clear lights appears, like an inverted mirror.
[34193] <prose> Possessing five rays of white, deep blue, and so forth.
[34194] <prose> Radiating with the light rays of wisdom in the four directions and center.
[34195] <prose> The dynamic power of the five wisdoms being perfected, naturally adorned with five bindus as small as mustard seeds.
[34196] <tantra> From the mirror-like wisdom. || 13770 ||
[34197] <prose> A mirror makes forms appear.
[34198] <prose> Whatever reflection appears in it.
[34199] <prose> Is not the actual awareness itself.
[34200] <prose> Therefore the mirror is an example because it makes its own reflection appear.
[34201] <prose> When the reflection, one's own radiance, exists, knowing one's own face is wisdom.
[34202] <prose> Hence, then above that, a yellow light-ray silk cloth, equal in size to the sense faculty's range, yellow and distinct from others.
[34203] <prose> Upon which again a bindu of five self-luminous lights.
[34204] <prose> The size of an inverted mirror, with white.
[34205] <prose> Deep blue.
[34206] <prose> Yellow. || 13780 ||
[34207] <prose> And red rays radiating.
[34208] <prose> Radiating greatly with the light rays of wisdom's own essence.
[34209] <prose> In the four directions and center of that bindu, the dynamic power of wisdom naturally adorned with five bindus as small as mustard seeds appears as before.
[34210] <prose> This is the appearance as the deep light rays of the wisdom of equality.
[34211] <prose> The equal cause of equality.
[34212] <prose> The equal condition.
[34213] <prose> The equal time.
[34214] <tantra> From these four equalities.
[34215] <prose> The equal cause is the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[34216] <prose> The equal condition is familiarity with Dharmatā. || 13790 ||
[34217] <prose> The equal time is the direct manifestation of realization.
[34218] <prose> Equality is one's own awareness.
[34219] <prose> Equality is designated as "self" because it is beyond alteration.
[34220] <prose> Dharmatā cannot be found to be altered by anything, nor can it be found to be superimposed by conceptual words.
[34221] <prose> Wisdom is.
[34222] <prose> That primordially abiding as equal becomes known at this time.
[34223] <prose> Thus the characteristics are fully established.
[34224] <prose> Then above that, without touching or mixing, upon a red silk cloth, equal in size to the sense faculty's range, with extremely clear light.
[34225] <prose> The essence of discriminating wisdom, a bindu of five lights extremely clear, like an inverted mirror, radiating with five-colored rays.
[34226] <prose> Radiating greatly with the light rays of wisdom. || 13800 ||
[34227] <prose> Moreover, in the four directions and center of that, naturally adorned with five bindus as small as mustard seeds, appears as before.
[34228] <break> <prose> That discriminating is the twenty-one sense faculties of superior, medium, and inferior.
[34229] <break> <prose> Condensed from that, nine.
[34230] <prose> Condensed from that, superior, medium, and inferior, three.
[34231] <prose> Extremely condensed from that, self-manifest awareness and.
[34232] <prose> The intellect of focused objects, realizing with both.
[34233] <prose> The intellect of focused objects realizes through the post-meditation path.
[34234] <prose> Self-manifest awareness directly realizes the equipoise path.
[34235] <prose> Thus through both direct perception and inference.
[34236] <prose> The primordially existing meaning becomes fully characterized and known now. || 13810 ||
[34237] <prose> Hence, the wisdom of all-accomplishing action completes primordial purity from the seed aspect where the dynamic power was not perfected.
[34238] <prose> That exists merely as the resonance aspect where the two lights gather.
[34239] <prose> All the appearances of the five wisdoms are explained in the context of universal clarity.
[34240] <prose> Here, since primordial purity is not yet liberated, it is posited as preparation.
[34241] <prose> For crude minds to desire the absence of all-accomplishing appearance is completely unreasonable.
[34242] <prose> If things were unseen because the dynamic power was unperfected, everything would be unseen.
[34243] <prose> Because all dynamic power is not perfected until the time of ultimate completion.
[34244] <prose> Therefore at this stage, one's own ground's appearance is preparation.
[34245] <prose> Not being liberation, one should understand "unperfected dynamic power" and accept the preparation of the four wisdoms.
[34246] <prose> Then upon seeing the aspect of the jewel-like appearance of spontaneous presence. || 13820 ||
[34247] <prose> Until the actual result is unperfected, it appears as the qualities of the four wisdoms.
[34248] <prose> The aspect of the fifth wisdom, all-accomplishing, does not appear as its own face.
[34249] <prose> But appears as the aspect of the five wisdoms due to the power of the seed potential.
[34250] <prose> This is because the seed of the five wisdoms pervades all of them.
[34251] <prose> Upon the four silk cloths of the four wisdoms are four bindus, and above them five small bindus arranged like drops on a maṇḍala.
[34252] <prose> Consequently, above those appears a round light like a peacock umbrella wheel, the appearance of the dhātu of the five wisdoms.
[34253] <prose> With a deep blue center and five-colored periphery, it appears as a circle.
[34254] <prose> This is the seed of the arising of spontaneous presence that emerges at this time.
[34255] <prose> These are called the path of the heart-essence of Vajrasattva.
[34256] <prose> The second, the manner of remembering the instruction. || 13830 ||
[34257] <prose> Wherein, all these appearances are known as self-manifest without altering awareness, and one rests evenly there like the drawing out.
[34258] <prose> Depending on the mother's oral instruction like a golden hook drawing out heart blood, one liberates by resolving one's own appearance in the bardo.
[34259] <prose> These also are from the Sun and Moon Union.
[34260] <prose> Again, from one's own heart center, an extremely subtle light thread arises.
[34261] <prose> It appears to pierce upward into the sky above.
[34262] <prose> When gazed upon with one's own eye without distraction.
[34263] <prose> Those appearances become extremely extensive, distinct from others.
[34264] <prose> That is upon a deep blue silk cloth.
[34265] <prose> A bindu endowed with rays, like an inverted mirror.
[34266] <prose> Extremely clear and radiant. || 13840 ||
[34267] <prose> Naturally adorned with five bindus upon it.
[34268] <prose> Also above that, upon a white silk cloth, an extremely clear bindu appears as before.
[34269] <prose> Upon a yellow silk cloth, a bindu also appears as before.
[34270] <prose> Upon a red silk cloth above that, a bindu appears as before.
[34271] <prose> Above that, an extremely clear round light appears like an umbrella.
[34272] <prose> These are also aspects of the five wisdoms.
[34273] <prose> The dynamic power of all-accomplishing wisdom being unperfected, it is unseen.
[34274] <prose> This is called the appearance of the preparation of the four wisdoms.
[34275] <prose> It is called the path of the heart-essence of Vajrasattva.
[34276] <prose> At that time, one should remember the supreme method like an unchanging golden hook. || 13850 ||
[34277] <prose> The fourth, the jewel-like appearance of spontaneous presence, has six aspects.
[34278] <prose> The manner of spontaneous presence arising, the manner of recollection arising.
[34279] <prose> The manner of clairvoyance arising.
[34280] <prose> The manner of retention obtaining.
[34281] <prose> The manner of samādhi arising.
[34282] <prose> And the manner of spontaneous presence dissolving.
[34283] <prose> The first is.
[34284] <prose> At the moment when wisdom dissolves into spontaneous presence, the previous appearances and one's own awareness gather into the upper light path, and from within that the appearance of arising emerges.
[34285] <prose> The eight modes of arising appear.
[34286] <prose> Arising like compassion, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are unceasing. || 13860 ||
[34287] <prose> Arising like light, all appearances are inwardly luminous.
[34288] <prose> Arising like Buddha-body, awareness does not lose the external.
[34289] <prose> Arising like wisdom, all appearances are totally open.
[34290] <prose> Arising like non-duality, one's own awareness abides one-pointedly.
[34291] <prose> Arising like liberation from extremes, it does not abide in any extreme.
[34292] <prose> Arising like the gate of impure saṃsāra, the source of existence is unceasing.
[34293] <prose> Arising like the gate of pure wisdom, Dharmatā connects mother and child.
[34294] <prose> These appearances also appear vertically.
[34295] <prose> Above is the appearance of primordial purity, like sky free of clouds.
[34296] <prose> Below that is the extensive and majestic maṇḍala of the Saṃbhogakāya wrathful ones. || 13870 ||
[34297] <prose> Below that is the peaceful Saṃbhogakāya appearance, clear light with excellent arrangement.
[34298] <prose> At the sides are the Nirmāṇakāya pure realms, pleasing and beautiful to behold.
[34299] <prose> Below are the deluded appearances of the six realms with the Tamer and the Teaching.
[34300] <prose> All of these, when appearing like self-manifest reflections.
[34301] <prose> Not knowing their own face, appear as other.
[34302] <prose> These also are the previous ground appearance arising at this time.
[34303] <tantra> From the Jewel Heap.
[34304] <tantra> From the mode of arising like compassion.
[34305] <prose> And so forth, as previously shown.
[34306] <prose> At this time, like the Great Measure's arrow being shot outward without obstruction and not returning. || 13880 ||
[34307] <prose> The inner dhātu is realized as totally open in an instant.
[34308] <prose> One should remember the instruction of not returning to the body.
[34309] <tantra> From the Sun and Moon Union.
[34310] <prose> Then one's own awareness dissolves into the upper light.
[34311] <prose> One experiences the eight modes of arising.
[34312] <prose> At that time, the lower Saṃbhogakāya wrathful appearances are also seen.
[34313] <prose> What are the eight modes of arising?
[34314] <prose> Arising like compassion, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are unceasing.
[34315] <prose> Arising like light, all appearances are inwardly clear.
[34316] <prose> Arising like Buddha-body, the external face of knowables is not lost. || 13890 ||
[34317] <prose> Arising like wisdom, all appearances are totally open.
[34318] <prose> Arising like non-duality, one's own awareness abides one-pointedly.
[34319] <prose> Arising like liberation from extremes, it does not abide in any extreme.
[34320] <prose> Arising like the gate of impure saṃsāra, the source of existence is unceasing.
[34321] <prose> Arising like the gate of pure wisdom, Dharmatā connects mother and child.
[34322] <prose> Consequently, at that time, one should remember the supreme method like the arrow of Great Measure that does not return.
[34323] <prose> At this time, the moment when awareness has dissolved into spontaneous presence, one goes to and abides in the palace of the precious king of non-returning.
[34324] <prose> Not emerging from the gate is the crucial essential instruction.
[34325] <prose> This is also to recognize the nature of the clear light appearance with its lasso and radiance, and from that not returning to the ordinary, becoming familiar with direct transcendence at that time.
[34326] <tantra> From the Thalgyur itself. || 13900 ||
[34327] <prose> Furthermore, the Dharmatā of awareness is explained.
[34328] <prose> Gazing at the lasso.
[34329] <prose> The wavering recollection of conceptual thought ceases.
[34330] <prose> Like birds flying in space.
[34331] <prose> There is no going from the Dharmadhātu.
[34332] <prose> Without other, pure awareness-appearance.
[34333] <prose> The causes and conditions of deluded appearance are exhausted.
[34334] <prose> Thus it is said.
[34335] <prose> In the bardo, the previous lasso with bindu is ripened into Buddha-body, so the essential point is that the lasso itself becomes unseen.
[34336] <prose> The second, the manner of recollection arising. || 13910 ||
[34337] <prose> Thus, through the teacher's compassion and one's own special accumulations, the habituation of engaging in and training in the holy Dharma arises here.
[34338] <prose> Obtaining empowerment, one sees the river of empowerment flowing.
[34339] <prose> Through generation stage meditation, one recollects the deity.
[34340] <prose> Through completion stage meditation, the path and.
[34341] <prose> Instructions and.
[34342] <prose> Samādhi and.
[34343] <prose> View are recollected.
[34344] <prose> Through recollecting pure aspiration prayers, the inferior faculties recollect the Nirmāṇakāya nature and are given breath.
[34345] <prose> At this stage of spontaneous presence, through special merit of previous knowledge, the self-manifest arising is.
[34346] <prose> The ground empowerment. || 13920 ||
[34347] <prose> Furthermore, first, all the Tathāgatas confer empowerment from the upper sky, and offering goddesses beyond measure rain down flower petals.
[34348] <prose> The great appearance of auspicious songs and dances arises.
[34349] <prose> At this time, for those with supreme devotion to their own teacher, the teacher is recollected and immediately appears in the sky.
[34350] <prose> Introducing the essential instruction, liberation becomes impossible not to occur.
[34351] <prose> For those with faith in the yidam deity, seeing the deity's face makes the habitual body unseen.
[34352] <prose> When the yidam deity's illusory body is taken.
[34353] <prose> Prophecies also arise.
[34354] <prose> These two recollections are drawn together as one.
[34355] <prose> Because the teacher is supreme among deities.
[34356] <tantra> From the Joyful Arising Wheel. || 13930 ||
[34357] <prose> O great Vajra-holding teacher.
[34358] <prose> O supreme deity, please pay heed.
[34359] <prose> Thus it is said.
[34360] <prose> Through the power of introduction on the five paths, one recollects that very nature.
[34361] <prose> Empowerment over the bardo Dharmatā Buddha-body, wisdom, light, colors, and so forth is gained.
[34362] <prose> Wherein, through recollecting the birthplace, the inferior faculties are born in the Nirmāṇakāya realm and breathe out.
[34363] <prose> Through recollecting samādhi, one naturally abides in samādhi for five days.
[34364] <prose> Through recollecting the teacher's essential instruction, one recognizes self-appearance and acts in Dharmatā.
[34365] <prose> Through recollecting the view, the previously seen direct view of Dharmatā.
[34366] <prose> Recognizing it now at this time without doubt is like meeting a previously familiar person. || 13940 ||
[34367] <prose> That is also the transformation of deluded appearance into direct perception on the spot.
[34368] <prose> Delusion becomes clear light, and when awareness without grasping or fixation shines within, the eye of non-conceptual Dharmatā sees.
[34369] <prose> Being carried to the ground of primordial purity without view or meditation, all grasping at appearance reaches the place of exhaustion, from this intention it arises.
[34370] <tantra> From the Thalgyur.
[34371] <prose> Furthermore, the Dharmatā appearance is explained.
[34372] <prose> Impure is delusion.
[34373] <prose> The sense doors unaltered.
[34374] <prose> Resting evenly is the essential point.
[34375] <break> <prose> Transformation from that is the oral instruction.
[34376] <break> <prose> In appearance without grasping. || 13950 ||
[34377] <prose> Mind without fixation arises.
[34378] <prose> Seen with the eye without analysis.
[34379] <prose> Drawn from the path of Dharmatā.
[34380] <prose> Carried to the ground without view or meditation.
[34381] <prose> Without action, free from effort, guided to the result.
[34382] <prose> Here appearance and extreme do not abide.
[34383] <prose> Thus it is said.
[34384] <break> <prose> At this time, six recollections.
[34385] <prose> Six clairvoyances.
[34386] <break> <prose> The form of non-forgetting. || 13960 ||
[34387] <prose> Therefore, continuous samādhi, and fourteen, are shown to be empowered by the power of knowing one's own face.
[34388] <prose> Although these recollections are spoken of after clairvoyance in the tantra.
[34389] <prose> Here they are explained earlier according to the order of arising in the continuum.
[34390] <tantra> From the Great Commentary on the Sun and Moon Union, the Jewel Golden Garland.
[34391] <prose> Subsequent recollection arises through the power of previous special actions, these arise before those clairvoyances.
[34392] <prose> The definitive scripture for recollection is.
[34393] <tantra> From the Sun and Moon Union.
[34394] <prose> At that time, six recollections also arise.
[34395] <prose> Through recollecting the deity, one sees the yidam deity's face in that very state.
[34396] <prose> Through recollecting the paths, one gains empowerment over the bardo Dharmatā. || 13970 ||
[34397] <prose> Wherein, through recollecting the birthplace, the inferior faculties breathe out in the Nirmāṇakāya realm of natural manifestation.
[34398] <prose> Through recollecting samādhi, one abides in samādhi for five days.
[34399] <prose> Through recollecting the teacher's essential instruction, one recognizes self-appearance and acts non-dually with it.
[34400] <prose> Through recollecting the view, it is like recognizing a previously familiar person upon merely meeting them.
[34401] <prose> The third, the manner of clairvoyance arising, has six aspects.
[34402] <prose> Clairvoyance of the faculties.
[34403] <prose> Clairvoyance of the workable mind.
[34404] <prose> Clairvoyance of power over wisdom.
[34405] <prose> Clairvoyance of pure vision of wisdom.
[34406] <prose> Clairvoyance of seeing Dharmatā without error. || 13980 ||
[34407] <prose> Clairvoyance of seeing the Buddha's cognition without error.
[34408] <break> <prose> These are each divided by parts into six, making thirty-six.
[34409] <prose> First, the six clairvoyances of the faculties begin with the clairvoyance of the eye arising.
[34410] <break> <tantra> From the pure water-bubble eye.
[34411] <prose> Seeing phenomena as totally open without opening or closing the eye.
[34412] <break> <prose> With the pure flesh eye, seeing coarse hidden phenomena up to five yojanas away.
[34413] <prose> With the completely pure flesh eye, seeing the four continents and Mount Meru as one.
[34414] <prose> With extremely pure vision, seeing two and three.
[34415] <break> <prose> With extremely thoroughly pure vision, seeing up to ten thousand and a hundred thousand.
[34416] <prose> With supremely thoroughly pure vision, seeing ten million and countless numbers without error. || 13990 ||
[34417] <prose> Then with the wisdom eye, seeing a hundred Nirmāṇakāya realms simultaneously.
[34418] <prose> With pure vision, seeing eight hundred thousand Nirmāṇakāya realms.
[34419] <prose> With extremely pure vision, seeing a hundred thousand Nirmāṇakāya realms.
[34420] <prose> With extremely thoroughly pure vision, seeing nine million.
[34421] <prose> With supremely thoroughly pure vision, seeing ninety-one.
[34422] <prose> Then with the all-knowing eye, seeing a hundred Saṃbhogakāya realms simultaneously.

[34478] <break> <prose> Nose.
[34479] <prose> Tongue.

[34482] <prose> Progressively, six for the eye.
[34483] <break> <prose> Three for the ear.
[34484] <break> <prose> And two each for the remaining four, making seventeen.
[34485] <prose> Counting four sets of four makes sixty-eight, which is the clairvoyance of the faculties.
[34486] <prose> Included within six subdivisions. || 14060 ||
[34487] <prose> The second, six clairvoyances of the workable mind are.
[34488] <prose> The pure vision of the mind that previously purified attachment.
[34489] <prose> The vision that exhausts subsequently arising delusion.
[34490] <prose> The vision of perfect knowledge of those to be trained.
[34491] <prose> The vision that makes the unseen into the path.
[34492] <prose> The vision of perfectly completing all beings.
[34493] <break> <prose> And the pure vision of the mind liberated from mistaken faculties.
[34494] <break> <prose> At this stage, if there were no body or mind, it would be unreasonable for the clairvoyances of the faculties and mind to arise.
[34495] <prose> Therefore it is said that the obscurations of the clairvoyances of body and mind are purified at this time by the power of appearance.
[34496] <prose> Like the five afflictions becoming the ground of wisdom. || 14070 ||
[34497] <break> <tantra> From the power of purifying afflictions, wisdom self-luminous.
[34498] <break> <prose> Afflictions cannot become wisdom themselves.
[34499] <prose> Because virtue and non-virtue are cause and result, this is absolutely impossible.
[34500] <prose> However, one should understand this as it is designated.
[34501] <prose> If one has wisdom, there is a crucial essential point here.
[34502] <prose> Wherein, first, through the pure vision of the mind that previously purified attachment, recollecting a hundred past lives.

[34511] <prose> Through the mind's vision of perfect knowledge of those to be trained.
[34512] <break> <prose> Seeing the characteristics of the bodies of countless beings assembled over a hundred thousand lives.
[34513] <break> <prose> With pure vision, speech and.
[34514] <prose> With extremely pure vision, mind.
[34515] <prose> With thoroughly pure vision, seeing all three simultaneously.
[34516] <prose> Through the mind's vision that makes the unseen into the path. || 14090 ||
[34517] <prose> Knowing in an instant the number of subtle atoms in a great trichiliocosm.
[34518] <prose> With pure vision, knowing the number of beings abiding in those atoms, how their awareness changes.
[34519] <prose> With extremely pure vision, knowing the natures of container and contained.
[34520] <prose> With thoroughly pure vision, seeing the meaning of emptiness, the Dharmatā.
[34521] <prose> Through the mind's vision of perfectly completing all beings.
[34522] <prose> Furthermore, seeing in an instant how much wind moved when the body was taken in past lives.
[34523] <prose> With pure vision, seeing the number of non-virtuous minds that arose at that time.
[34524] <prose> With extremely pure vision, seeing the number of virtuous ones.
[34525] <prose> With thoroughly pure vision, seeing the numbers of both virtue and non-virtue simultaneously.
[34526] <prose> Through the mind's vision liberated from mistaken faculties. || 14100 ||
[34527] <prose> Seeing the characteristics of the places where one took birth in the past.
[34528] <break> <prose> With pure vision, seeing the past birthplaces of others.
[34529] <break> <prose> With extremely pure vision, knowing the conduct of body, speech, and mind at those times.
[34530] <prose> With thoroughly pure vision, knowing simultaneously the characteristics of past birthplaces of both, and what was done with the three doors.
[34531] <prose> Thus the six clairvoyances of the mind, divided into four each, make twenty-four aspects.
[34532] <prose> The third, six clairvoyances of power over wisdom.
[34533] <break> <prose> The vision of wisdom free from intellect and.
[34534] <break> <prose> Free from words.
[34535] <prose> Free from conceptualization.

[34549] <prose> With pure vision, seeing the sharp and dull faculties of persons practicing them.
[34550] <prose> With extremely pure vision, knowing their liberations.
[34551] <prose> With thoroughly pure vision, knowing the similar phenomena of faculties.
[34552] <break> <prose> Through the vision of wisdom beyond analysis, seeing all general meanings.
[34553] <prose> With pure vision, seeing one's own meaning and.
[34554] <break> <prose> With extremely pure vision, seeing both general and specific characteristics as insight.
[34555] <prose> With thoroughly pure vision, seeing meaning beyond words and letters.
[34556] <prose> Through the vision of wisdom that severs birth, seeing the causes of saṃsāric phenomena. || 14130 ||
[34557] <prose> With pure vision, seeing the characteristics of the conditions, the afflictions.

[34559] <prose> With thoroughly pure vision, seeing liberation from them.
[34560] <break> <prose> Through the vision of wisdom free from characteristics, recognizing the measure of the mind's changes.
[34561] <break> <prose> With pure vision, seeing the characteristics of the mind itself as just looking.
[34562] <prose> With extremely pure vision, seeing the changes of the minds of other beings.
[34563] <prose> With thoroughly pure vision, knowing simultaneously the changes of other beings' minds in the three times.
[34564] <prose> Conceptual thought and.
[34565] <prose> Non-conceptual and.
[34566] <prose> Differences of intention. || 14140 ||
[34567] <prose> Thus the six clairvoyances of wisdom, divided into four sets, make twenty-four.
[34568] <break> <prose> The fourth, six clairvoyances of pure vision of wisdom.
[34569] <break> <prose> Through the clairvoyance of the Dharmadhātu wisdom becoming manifest, knowing simultaneously the birthplaces of future beings.
[34570] <prose> Through mirror-like, knowing the past.
[34571] <prose> Through equality, knowing the present.
[34572] <prose> Through discrimination, knowing the transmigrations of future beings.
[34573] <prose> Through all-accomplishing, knowing the past.
[34574] <prose> Through the pure vision of non-abiding wisdom, knowing the transmigrations of present beings.
[34575] <prose> The fifth, when the six clairvoyances of seeing Dharmatā without error arise, self-benefit is completed and one engages in the activity of benefiting others.
[34576] <prose> Through the clairvoyance of realizing all phenomena free from elaboration, seeing the hell realms simultaneously and being able to emanate countless millions there. || 14150 ||
[34577] <prose> Through realizing signless Dharmatā, seeing the hungry ghost realms, lifespans, and.
[34578] <break> <prose> Suffering and.
[34579] <break> <prose> Actions and results, compassion arises and one can emanate three countless ones.
[34580] <prose> Through realizing all phenomena as naturally clear light, seeing the animal realms, and.
[34581] <prose> Suffering and.
[34582] <prose> Lifespans and.
[34583] <prose> Actions and results, compassion arises and one can emanate five countless millions.
[34584] <prose> Through realizing all phenomena as equality, seeing the human realms and so forth, compassion arises and one can emanate hundreds of hundreds of millions.
[34585] <prose> Through realizing all phenomena as empty of self or what belongs to self, seeing the asura realms and characteristics, one can emanate ninety thousand and ninety hundred.
[34586] <prose> Through realizing all phenomena as free from words, knowing the god realms, lifespans, and times of falling, one can emanate nine hundred thousand and nine hundred. || 14160 ||
[34587] <prose> Thus the other's benefit knowledge self-arising through different classes of beings.
[34588] <prose> Twenty-one hells and.
[34589] <prose> Four hungry ghosts and.
[34590] <prose> Two animals and.

[34597] <prose> Conduct and.
[34598] <prose> Perceptions and.
[34599] <prose> Characteristics.
[34600] <prose> Through these six clairvoyances seeing and knowing faculties and powers.
[34601] <prose> Thus the six contaminated clairvoyances of seeing the faculties' mode.
[34602] <prose> And the thirty of seeing others through the six faculties are uncontaminated.
[34603] <prose> Here, depending on the object, contaminated and uncontaminated are spoken of.
[34604] <prose> The object as the ground, deluded appearance is contaminated.
[34605] <prose> Dharmatā free from elaboration, unmistaken, is uncontaminated.
[34606] <prose> Understanding the meeting of these two, thus it is spoken. || 14180 ||
[34607] <prose> The wisdom of noble ones, equal and uncontaminated, realizing the nature.
[34608] <prose> And ordinary beings' contaminated should be understood.
[34609] <prose> The sixth, the Buddha's cognition, extremely pure uncontaminated clairvoyance without error.
[34610] <prose> Thus completing the thirty.
[34611] <prose> Abiding expands as samādhi, seeing and abiding in the nature of phenomena without error.

[34623] <prose> Hidden within, the three Buddha-bodies, bound by one's own continuum's fixation.
[34624] <prose> Previously bound by the obscurations of knowables, all are known, thus the great clairvoyance.
[34625] <prose> Thus for the first of the six clairvoyances, sixty-eight.
