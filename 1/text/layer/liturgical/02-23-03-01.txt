[32948] <verse> First:
[32949] <tantra> From that itself:
[32950] <verse> In space's realm, reflections
[32951] <verse> Become impermanent and dissolve.
[32952] <verse> Without moon-form, that is death.
[32953] <verse> When limbs break in four, in four months.
[32954] <verse> When head breaks above, in three months.
[32955] <verse> When upper-lower separate, in two months.
[32956] <verse> When rolled into a ball, in one month. || 12530 ||
[32957] <verse> Know that time.
[32958] <verse> The connection-cord of sky-earth:
[32959] <verse> If it becomes cut,
[32960] <verse> Cannot exceed nineteen days.
[32961] <verse> From the sides of Mount Meru,
[32962] <verse> From White Lioness not descending,
[32963] <verse> In sixteen days, cannot but befall.
[32964] <verse> If between mountain and plain,
[32965] <verse> Wish-fulfilling tree trunk breaks,
[32966] <break> <verse> These too should be examined by the wise. || 12540 ||
[32967] <break> <prose>
[32968] <prose>
[32969] <prose>
[32970] <prose>
[32971] <verse> When ocean's water vapor dissolves,
[32972] <verse> This too is divided by the wise in sequence.
[32973] <verse> In earth's villages and cities,
[32974] <verse> If the monk's smoke itself breaks,
[32975] <verse> In nine days he will thus perish.
[32976] <break> <verse> On the peak of Mount Meru, || 12550 ||
[32977] <break> <verse> If the unchanging sun sets,
[32978] <verse> In three days he will also die.
[32979] <verse> Completely abandon rites,
[32980] <verse> Examine the meaning of self-awareness essence.
[32981] <verse> From inside the hollow of Meru,
[32982] <verse> If the Ḍākinī's sound breaks,
[32983] <verse> In thirteen or five days.
[32984] <verse> If from the wish-fulfilling tree,
[32985] <verse> The Lord of Death's demon rises,
[32986] <verse> In seven days he cannot but perish. || 12560 ||
[32987] <verse> That will not become benefit—
[32988] <verse> Habituation to emptiness is precious.
[32989] <tantra> Thus.
[32990] <verse> Second, the common:
[32991] <tantra> Also from that itself:
[32992] <verse> If the luster of limb nails is gone,
[32993] <verse> In nine months he cannot but perish.
[32994] <verse> If the vapor of the birth-being's eyes dissolves,
[32995] <verse> In five months likewise.
[32996] <verse> If the Lord of Death Yama himself rises, || 12570 ||
[32997] <verse> In twenty-one days he dies.
[32998] <verse> Nothing can benefit that.
[32999] <verse> If the ankle of the foot protrudes outward,
[33000] <verse> In one month likewise.
[33001] <verse> If examining another's body,
[33002] <verse> When the birth-being is struck by disease,
[33003] <verse> Tartar accumulates at the tooth root,
[33004] <verse> In nine days he will also die.
[33005] <verse> In various five days likewise,
[33006] <verse> In that way also death. || 12580 ||
[33007] <verse> Limbs repeatedly move and contract,
[33008] <verse> That is in seven days.
[33009] <verse> When eyes look with sticking grains,
[33010] <verse> In three days tro-ta.
[33011] <verse> If the eye joints are greatly disturbed,
[33012] <verse> That is in half a month.
[33013] <verse> If the cheek channels break,
[33014] <verse> In nineteen days likewise.
[33015] <verse> The birth-being does life formation,
[33016] <verse> If breath is also agitated in gasping, || 12590 ||
[33017] <verse> That is in six months.
[33018] <verse> If the nose ma-si-ka breaks,
[33019] <verse> In seven days he will perish.
[33020] <verse> If the eye ba-ra-na breaks,
[33021] <verse> In five days he will also perish.
[33022] <verse> If the left cheek flesh falls,
[33023] <verse> In one day he will likewise perish.
[33024] <verse> If upper and lower teeth become closed,
[33025] <verse> In three days he cannot but perish.
[33026] <verse> If black drops arise on the tongue, || 12600 ||
[33027] <verse> In two days he will also perish.
[33028] <verse> If ears stick to the head,
[33029] <verse> That is at midnight of that night.
[33030] <verse> If the chest protruding nose collapses,
[33031] <verse> In half a month he cannot but perish.
[33032] <verse> If there is no root for falling asleep,
[33033] <verse> That is also in half a month.
[33034] <tantra> Thus.
[33035] <verse> Third, showing the method of reversal.
[33036] <prose> || 12610 ||
[33037] <prose>
[33038] <prose>
[33039] <prose>
[33040] <prose> Gathering accumulations in special lands,
[33041] <prose> And doing the wheel of elemental dependent origination,
[33042] <prose> Through the three—deceiving demons with ransoms—explained to reverse even from exhausted life.
[33043] <tantra> From that itself:
[33044] <verse> When signs arise in the body thus,
[33045] <verse> The rite of deceiving death is explained.
[33046] <verse> Beginning the karma of reversing the birth-being, || 12620 ||
[33047] <verse> With one's own Master and virtue assembly,
[33048] <verse> Gathering accumulations in special lands,
[33049] <verse> Pleasing with gifts and feasts,
[33050] <verse> Begin these rites.
[33051] <verse> For equal portions of elemental sounds,
[33052] <verse> On the palm tree's leaf,
[33053] <verse> The wheel of the five elements,
[33054] <verse> With four calculations, center and rim,
[33055] <verse> Wheels of earth, water, fire, wind, and space,
[33056] <verse> Make five wheels, || 12630 ||
[33057] <verse> Divided by colors according to elements.
[33058] <verse> In the center wall and five,
[33059] <verse> Five letters of each self,
[33060] <verse> Surrounded by the group of Ali at the rim.
[33061] <verse> Having written wheels thus,
[33062] <verse> Worship, praise, and confess impurity,
[33063] <verse> Make prayers according to each individual's desire.
[33064] <verse> Thinking of the elemental god in the center,
[33065] <verse> Recite and insert the number of letters.
[33066] <break> <verse> Then in a fitted clay vessel, || 12640 ||
[33067] <break> <verse> Inserting all those wheels,
[33068] <verse> Bind crosswise with five colored threads.
[33069] <verse> Wood, water, fire, and earth,
[33070] <verse> In the mouth-vapor of disagreeing races,
[33071] <verse> Mix all that with dough-food,
[33072] <verse> Make a form of one cubit in the mixture.
[33073] <verse> Letters on the five faculties,
[33074] <verse> Write on paper and put inside unfolded.
[33075] <verse> By that restore weak elements.
[33076] <verse> If seized by demons, || 12650 ||
[33077] <verse> Dough-food the extent of the birth-being's age,
[33078] <verse> Change the color itself,
[33079] <verse> With cloth-pieces of one's own stains,
[33080] <verse> Also elemental substances like that,
[33081] <verse> Mix with food and form.
[33082] <verse> With wool-colors, silk, and feathers,
[33083] <break> <verse> Adorn those forms.
[33084] <break> <verse> Also tormas agreeing with those,
[33085] <verse> Those too are like that.
[33086] <verse> In the last of that form, the dough-food, || 12660 ||
[33087] <verse> Surround by the yogin's number of years.
[33088] <verse> Having blessed, recite these words:
[33089] <verse> "Take, take, O powerful ones,
[33090] <verse> Craving, attachment, grasping,
[33091] <verse> Remembering, seizing, thinking, and touching.
[33092] <prose>
[33093] <prose>
[33094] <prose>
[33095] <prose>
[33096] <verse> Release, peace, and liberate"—recite these words three times. From that, send to river's channel. In reversing from death, no doubt in naraka—<tantra> thus. || 12670 ||
[33097] <verse> Fourth, showing death-time's appearance: individual appearances of channel-wind disturbed at individual elements' dissolving times; Sign of earth dissolving in earth: body heavy, not able to rise; Sign of water dissolving in water: water flows outward from mouth and nose, then dries; Sign of fire dissolving in fire: heat lost from body's four edges, luster and complexion gathered; Sign of wind dissolving in wind: breath gasps not arising, body's strength lost.
[33098] <tantra> From Sun-Moon Union:
[33099] <verse> Earth dissolving in earth,
[33100] <verse> Likewise water, fire, and wind,
[33101] <verse> Each one dissolving in itself—
[33102] <verse> Thus come in the birth-being's body.
[33103] <verse> By earth dissolving in itself,
[33104] <verse> Body heavy, food not taken,
[33105] <verse> All strength of rising and going exhausted.
[33106] <verse> At time of water dissolving in water, || 12680 ||
[33107] <verse> Water of mouth and nose drips.
[33108] <verse> Likewise by fire dissolving in fire,
[33109] <verse> Mouth and nose greatly dry,
[33110] <verse> Heat of body's edges lost.
[33111] <verse> Likewise by wind dissolving in wind,
[33112] <verse> Breath coarse-coarse, limbs move,
[33113] <verse> Eye also turns upward—<tantra> thus.
[33114] <verse> Fifth, three in instruction of giving: putting space-awareness self-place in excellent habituated; middle purifying transfer; last relying on other conditions.
[33115] <verse> First: yogins dying alone, without gather-separate in clear-light's appearance, at that time also not depending on other, by clear self-appearance, putting without distraction from that nature. Body key-posture of three which-any, or cross-legged, or by lion's sleep-method, dying in awareness space-awareness placed nature, in that moment liberating as upward penetrate-through, without dharmatā intermediate state.
[33116] <tantra> Also from that itself: || 12690 ||
[33117] <verse> At that time, the fortune-possessing birth-being,
[33118] <verse> If appearance itself self-clear,
[33119] <verse> Thus vidya not-remaining in self-place—<tantra> thus.
[33120] <prose>
[33121] <prose>
[33122] <prose>
[33123] <prose>
[33124] <verse> By lion's sleep-method of aggregates: placing awareness itself in eye, doing mind little interval-space as path. If space and awareness not changing, that person without intermediate state, no doubt in Buddha; dying one's breath also becomes slow—<tantra> thus.
[33125] <prose> Space-awareness habituated ones: at death-time, in snow, cave, person, etc., dying without mind-distracted conditions is important. <tantra> Also by peaceful god:
[33126] <verse> Whoever stays near, || 12700 ||
[33127] <verse> Also not doing grief,
[33128] <verse> By this no one becomes distracted
[33129] <verse> In Buddha remembering, etc.—
[33130] <tantra> Like thus said.
[33131] <verse> Second, doing transfer's key as shown before. That also, at time of life-wind entering consciousness-wind, lifting place from heart, being time, awareness from heart, thinking self's Master's body color-filled, throwing by seven or twenty-one HIG sounds to Brahma-opening, liberating as moment-by penetrate-through in primordially-pure ground.
[33132] <tantra> From Sun-Moon Union:
[33133] <verse> Though four winds cease by sequence,
[33134] <verse> At time moved by one great wind—
[33135] <tantra> From thus:
[33136] <verse> Consciousness riding wind, purifying in wind, || 12710 ||
[33137] <verse> Also precious to send above;
[33138] <verse> Precious to gather and throw awareness;
[33139] <verse> That also throwing by HIG,
[33140] <verse> That meeting to Master's mouth—<tantra> thus.
[33141] <prose> At time of awareness's Jñana wind entering consciousness, here transferring, instructions hit clear here. <tantra> From that itself:
[33142] <verse> At that time, Master's instructions,
[33143] <verse> Familiarize in self's continuum;
[33144] <verse> Also hit clear by these meanings—<tantra> thus.
[33145] <prose> Transfer entering place and place at breath transfer-time, and instruction of space-awareness entering body and Jñana, are two; also in space-awareness, not relying on other conditions of habituated, and relying—explained as two. That is the place of instruction's form becoming three.
[33146] <verse> Third, relying on other conditions: at that time, by one without stain in Master or Vajra brother existence samaya, hitting clear. || 12720 ||
[33147] <prose>
[33148] <prose>
[33149] <prose>
[33150] <prose>
[33151] <prose> That also resembling now's clear-light send-ma, like intermediate-state's clear-light early-ma; for reason of joining those two middle, showing appearance like space-awareness send-ma:
[33152] <verse> "Exclamation! Son of the race, this present clear-light is actual self-arisen Jñana; in this nature, put mind without fabricating, and you are Buddha in upward penetrate-through. Also look at this appearance not changing; this present clear-light becomes mixed with dharmatā Mother's clear-light, all appearances arising in Buddha-field. At that time, do recognize as self-appearance. At that time, you are Buddha in primordially-pure ground."
[33153] <prose> Moreover, if not recognized there, at time of clear-light dissolving in spontaneous presence, body and Jñana's appearance arises. From that, Jñana four preparation's appearance arises. From that, spontaneous presence's hundred doors arise—by you, do recognize as self-appearance. After recognizing self-face, recite three times "you are well gone to primordially-pure ground"; self also putting equally moment in that appearance, and also giving clear in that. Liberated certain by that.
[33154] <break> <tantra> From Sun-Moon Union:
[33155] <break> <verse> If space-awareness not clear,
[33156] <verse> In dharmatā bliss intermediate state, || 12730 ||
[33157] <verse> For grasping awareness's appearance,
[33158] <verse> Do in mind lights shown before;
[33159] <verse> By that obtain true appearance.
[33160] <verse> If those not clear,
[33161] <verse> At self's Master remaining,
[33162] <verse> Also hit clear above instruction;
[33163] <verse> If Master not exist, Vajra brother,
[33164] <verse> Also do hit clear of knowing—<tantra> thus.
[33165] <prose> Like that, hitting instruction continue to dying, or showing benefit to other by three jewel-form instructions at death-time for others of not-agreeing Dharma awareness. That also: at that time of outer breath cut, inner breath not cut, do remain in manifest dharmatā meaning for moment's interval by self. From that, other person separating from breath, that gap's mouth-nose three and self's mouth-nose three joined, wind going upward in three pieces.
[33166] <prose> || 12740 ||
[33167] <prose>
[33168] <prose>
[33169] <prose>
[33170] <prose> Here gathering in three from: there, first piece think white AOM and throw; second with red AH throw; last throw without thinking anything. Here all three think as HUM, that consciousness blue-green HUM pull to self's awareness. Also in speech thus HUM cause, forcefully pull to shoe-sole. At that time, producing body-speech-mind three strength of self, pulling inside shoe-sole shoe-sole, that one's wind warm pierce certainly arises to self's inside.
[33171] <prose> At that time, coming by HRIQ between that other person's eyes; from that, body also comes able to rise suddenly. Like that becoming, show eye's thusness dharmatā manifest appearance. When eye becomes suddenly, putting like introducing drop-empty lamp by thumb-finger: clear-light existing in self, that is this; this self at time of coming out from body, dharmatā intermediate state arising as self-possessive, this is self-appearance, not other—do recognize self-face, thus hitting three times. When saying "see that appearance" or "understand that instruction," if voice comes, good; even if sign arises, it is hit.
