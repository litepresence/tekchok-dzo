[25511] <prose> First is: bind body speech main-point, wind mind relax from latency;
[25512] <prose> inner samādhi pervades luminous-clear empty state,
[25513] <prose> and spacious knowing, grasp-hold not-existing, pleasure happiness vast, arise spread-desire, though not-existing attachment grasp, even hair-tip, arise from arriving at nature meditation main-point.
[25514] <prose> Fabricated meditation: pleasure happiness arise, great experience change, coarse throb or song dance desire arise, cause attachment grasp to go.
[25515] <prose> This: though dawn pleasure happiness, also self-power obtain pleasure happiness, grasp not-existing, knowing difference existing, fabricated meditate.
[25516] <prose> Know difference of meditation arriving at nature wind. || 5090 ||
[25517] <prose> End change experience: wind experience vision part is:
[25518] <verse> —Like firefly,
[25519] <verse> —like cloud,
[25520] <verse> —like smoke,
[25521] <verse> —like haze,
[25522] <verse> —like moon dawn,
[25523] <verse> —like star dawn,
[25524] <verse> —like sky brightening, blue vision existing,
[25525] <verse> —like sun dawn, outer inner unimpeded vision—
[25526] <verse> eight. || 5100 ||
[25527] <prose> Become clear dim and dawn cease cause: not firm, cannot stand, change go—called end change experience, cause is wind moving experience.
[25528] <prose> These do existing, need purify wind mind.
[25529] <prose> Vision experience is: great awareness self-resonance luminous-clear.
[25530] <prose> Occasion: outer vision increases, from arriving at measure; self-resonance dissolves into base, reverse inner, only outer clear need; cause need dissolve into spontaneous-completion pure dhātu.
[25531] <prose> Inner clear: in self-light expanse, awareness body wisdom palace, originally abide spontaneous-completion great, not-existing change.
[25532] <prose> Therefore here: vision experience is chief.
[25533] <prose> Knowing experience: is intellect, change, cannot stand measure, all-conceptual conventional appearance possessor, remember doer difference, near-side concept gather cause.
[25534] <prose> Do measure this: similar to bird doing hide cover, place measure in cloud.
[25535] <prose> Time not existing to realize meaning, see self-point not arrive.
[25536] <prose> Wherein, this: vision experience, see wisdom five color vision, transcend half end of samsāra action, grasp field vision. || 5110 ||
[25537] <prose> See dhātu vision: that above, not existing grasp concept part half, grasp empty extreme wrong cause, transcend two-thirds samsāra part.
[25538] <prose> Self-purify all-concept base ground, grasp part half, grasp vision self-characteristic wrong cause,
[25539] <prose> called person and dharmas grasp-hold self not-existing concept.
[25540] <prose> Briefly: all vision experiences—wisdom five color vision, and dhātu vision, two gather.
[25541] <prose> Above increase is: go those visions more beautiful, more good, more many.
[25542] <prose> General show this purify manner, and particular explain vision manner—two from:
[25543] <prose> First is: apply samsāra liberate manner from binding;
[25544] <prose> that vision: up-stand, and wing dawn,
[25545] <prose> and boat-part, and part, and cloth vision—five complete, from obtaining power of wisdom five color.
[25546] <prose> Liberate from binding: five manifest move—desire, aversion, delusion, pride, jealousy. || 5120 ||
[25547] <prose> Cause not existing other than latency only, itself transcend samsāra half.
[25548] <prose> Then: net form, and net half, and eye many line, and like eye spot form, and see like canopy tent house—
[25549] <prose> transcend from self made by form and so forth aggregate five collection.
[25550] <prose> Transcend world self three two, pure blessing of dharmatā view.
