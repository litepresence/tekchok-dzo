[23431] <prose> First—when fear arises from fierce conditions such as water, fire, dog, enemy, etc.—think that one sits within a dream—this is called harsh-holding, holding certainly.
[23432] <prose> Then, all that was dreamed in whatever manner comes.
[23433] <prose> At the time of holding, emanation.
[23434] <prose> By made emanation, one-to-many—the deity-form of daytime mind, sentient beings, many different appearances—emanate.
[23435] <prose> See like emanation within dream.
[23436] <prose> Then mutual god-naga transformation. || 3010 ||
[23437] <prose> Transform male-female.
[23438] <prose> What is certain is arising within dream—trained during the day without distraction from aspiration—transform one-to-many, many-to-one.
[23439] <prose> Then travel there within dream, hear dharma, etc.—mind makes before not-reached places, realms, etc.
[23440] <prose> If these fierce aspirations are made—quickly mastered.
[23441] <prose> Yet some actual dream meditation is explained.
[23442] <prose> Here it is suitable as preliminary—because not free from intellect truth-grasping—merely held dream, emanation-transformation is not the dharmatā meaning.
[23443] <prose> Before most, this exists not explained—a very important point said suppression explanation, dream point oral-instruction, and.
[23444] <prose> Is certainty taken from self-experience.
[23445] <prose> Second, the actual—three:
[23446] <prose> dharmatā-meaning point, || 3020 ||
[23447] <prose> Means, and—
[23448] <prose> Focus point,
[23449] <prose> Channel-wind binding point.
[23450] <tantra> From three: train, transform, cut.
[23451] <prose> Meditate all three—very difficult, and—
[23452] <prose> Yet also said whichever one is enough—easy, two medium.
[23453] <prose> When guiding to do practice, train all in this—meditate all time.
[23454] <prose> First train dream—day appearances all—last night's dreamed dream—clear aspiration—make emanate-transform, and.
[23455] <prose> Train outer truth-without time—training-rigpa look—arise-arise base-without, root-free nature—naked, clearly meditate.
[23456] <prose> All fixation-without, truth-without, base-without, recognition-without—recognize appearances' nature—one-pointed—meditate without losing effort-force—appearances only—actually illusion-dream arise—karma, latency, deluded-appearance, deluded-grasping all cease. || 3030 ||
[23457] <prose> And arise without distraction from that state within dream.
[23458] <prose> Day-night dharmatā-wheel—not beyond.
[23459] <break> <prose> Dream-transform from appearance-emptiness two.
[23460] <break> <prose> Appearance-transform point—depend made upon showing deity-form in mirror, and.
[23461] <prose> Transform all appearances to deity's mandala, and—
[23462] <prose> Transform to Buddha's realm, and—
[23463] <prose> Do by fierce aspiration transforming illusion's eight-examples.
[23464] <prose> Transform emptiness—like smoke clearing, cloud gathering in sky.
[23465] <prose> Moment-emptiness deluded-appearance—wide flat flat meditate.
[23466] <prose> Become that thus within dream. || 3040 ||
[23467] <prose> Upon this itself, how appear time—dream cut.
[23468] <prose> Not establish rigpa-hold top intermediate-space.
[23469] <prose> Not hold appearance form-reflection top here-rig.
[23470] <prose> Not confused by thought of connection between appearance-mind two.
[23471] <prose> On the two pure stages, birth is spoken.
[23472] <prose> The inner warmth is at the sixth.
[23473] <prose> Empty awareness-entity is realized as pure.
[23474] <prose> Whatever mind not do—vast release inner-clear self-clear rigpa.
[23475] <prose> Made thus—first dream coarse.
[23476] <prose> Then subtle. || 3050 ||
[23477] <prose> Then fade.
[23478] <prose> Gone increasingly few, finally anything not dream—practice meaning day-night mixed self-clear rigpa concentration—meditation called day-night union.
[23479] <prose> Upon second means-focus point:
[23480] <prose> Stir, and—
[23481] <prose> Squeeze.
[23482] <tantra> From three: throw point.
