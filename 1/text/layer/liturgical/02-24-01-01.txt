[35701] <prose> Those of final faculties—beings most refined—or those lesser who yet failed to recognize truth when dharma-nature bardo arose before them:
[35702] <prose> When the path appears within the becoming bardo, dreamlike,
[35703] <prose> Recognition dawns: "I have died."
[35704] <prose> Remembering their wavering in that bardo state,
[35705] <prose> They recall the guru and instructions received—
[35706] <prose> Resolving, "Now I go unto the field of natural emanation"— || 15280 ||
[35707] <prose> Through blessing of dharma-nature truth previously realized,
[35708] <prose> And through absence of self-grasping stain, propensities exhaust;
[35709] <prose> Miraculously born upon a lotus in that field in a moment, exhaling.
[35710] <tantra> From the Sun-Moon Conjunction Tantra:
[35711] <verse> "By remembering the birthplace, those of final faculties exhale into the three natural emanation body fields."
[35712] <prose> Furthermore:
[35713] <verse> "O Teacher, Vajra Mind—
[35714] <prose> When those of final faculties behold this,
[35715] <prose> Does bardo itself appear,
[35716] <prose> The Teacher declares: It appears— || 15290 ||
[35717] <verse> Self-grasping propensities exhausted,
[35718] <prose> Exhaled into natural emanation,
[35719] <prose> Without bardo, Buddha attained.
[35720] <prose> Thus it is said.
[35721] <prose> The preliminary instruction for this is:
[35722] <prose> Habituate daytime to direct perception of self-appearance;
[35723] <prose> At nighttime, habituate five lights within the heart, then sleep looking toward the emanation field.
[35724] <prose> Train power through transference during intervals.
[35725] <prose> When wisdom-consciousness riding wind projects from heart—or from eyes to chief heart-center—into emanation field through this crucial point,
[35726] <prose> You cut through bardo's dangerous precipice, transferring from one excellent dwelling to another, faultless. || 15300 ||
[35727] <prose> At death's moment, when wind goes out ungathered, establish clear focus and project with HIG—
[35728] <tantra> From the Sun-Moon Conjunction:
[35729] <verse> "Manner of entering pure fields:
[35730] <prose> Dwelling-transference, dwelling-entry—
[35731] <prose> Train consciousness riding wind.
[35732] <prose> That going above is precious;
[35733] <prose> Gathering, projecting awareness precious—
[35734] <prose> This is projection with HIG."
[35735] <prose> Thus.
[35736] <prose> Through practicing thus, some are born directly into the pure field itself. || 15310 ||
[35737] <prose> Though path arises from hundred-path bardo, recognition of becoming bardo comes;
[35738] <prose> At that time, merely remembering that field, one is born through dharma-nature's blessing—
[35739] <prose> No hidden instruction exists.
[35740] <ornament> Regarding the manner of exhaling into natural emanation:
[35741] <verse> "Nature" has two aspects:
[35742] <break> <prose> The nature of abiding, and
[35743] <break> <prose> The nature of enumeration.
[35744] <prose> Abiding nature thus:
[35745] <tantra> From primordial time this abides as path-appearance;
[35746] <prose> Four directions of Sambhogakaya gate, spontaneous ground-appearance. || 15320 ||
[35747] <prose> Though eleven exist—ten fields with great charnel-ground burning mountain at center—
[35748] <prose> Here five are recognized: great exhaling of liberation.
[35749] <prose> Enumeration nature:
[35750] <prose> By means of the ten perfections, one reaches the eleventh universal light ground—the special ground of Buddha-appearance.
[35751] <prose> Here one hears the Buddha's speech, — yet
[35752] <prose> The bodhisattvas are obscured by knowable obscurations and do not see the body;
[35753] <prose> When they see that body, knowable obscurations are exhausted and they are considered Buddhas.
[35754] <prose> This itself is also named the Dharma Body of accumulated merit.
[35755] <tantra> Therefore, from the Six Spheres Tantra:
[35756] <break> <verse> "The merit-accumulated Dharma Body || 15330 ||
[35757] <break> <prose> And omniscient wisdom—
[35758] <prose> Similar, similar indeed, O treasure!"
[35759] <prose> Thus.
[35760] <verse> "Emanation" thus:
[35761] <prose> Four fields with center—five—emanation fields of five Buddha families.
[35762] <prose> Eastern field called Manifest Joy:
[35763] <prose> Teacher Vajra Unshakable with retinue of bodhisattvas, boys and girls, white, miraculously born;
[35764] <prose> They move through sky,
[35765] <prose> Celestial palace possessing immeasurable excellence,
[35766] <prose> Various emanation birds proclaiming sweet voices, || 15340 ||
[35767] <prose> Scent of excellent fragrance, jewel trees infinite adorning—

[35779] <prose> Sky before center of all these: great charnel-ground Burning Mountain—
[35780] <prose> Emanation wrathful field. Merely seeing this profound Dharma's door, those of final faculties exhale into their classes;
[35781] <tantra> From there, in five hundred years, unique Buddhahood obtained, no bardo.
[35782] <tantra> From Great Arrangement of Ati:
[35783] <verse> "Five hundredfold degenerate age's end,
[35784] <prose> Secret essence appears in human realm;
[35785] <prose> Capable persons holding it subsequently—
[35786] <prose> To whom appears this essence? || 15360 ||
[35787] <prose> They traverse unchanging ground.
[35788] <prose> If through degenerate times, short life, diseases,
[35789] <prose> Confidence in essential meaning unarisen,
[35790] <prose> Yet seeing this itself, great exhaling occurs—
[35791] <prose> Eleventh universal light, that emanation field,
[35792] <prose> Miraculously born, pure, womb-confinement separated.
[35793] <prose> Eastern Manifest Joy, unchanging vajra field,

[35806] <break> <prose> No wind, bile, phlegm diseases, no combinations; || 15380 ||
[35807] <prose> Water eight-limbed, hundred tastes—
[35808] <prose> Drinking pleases; body softens.
[35809] <prose> Earth, water, fire, wind arise, benefit and harm separated;
[35810] <prose> Hunger, thirst, heat, cold dispelled.
[35811] <prose> Desire, aversion, delusion, afflictions—
[35812] <prose> No birth-cause arises; mind relaxed.
[35813] <prose> Looking, smiling, holding, embracing—no attachment;
