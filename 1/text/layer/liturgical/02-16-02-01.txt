[1021] <prose> First, Nirmāṇakāya essence: from expanse-kaya and rigpa, radiating as light-kaya and so forth, performing others' benefit.
[1022] <prose> The etymology:
[1023] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[1024] <break> <prose> Know these emanation-kaya etymologies:
[1025] <break> <prose> Because appearing suitable to world-realms beings—emanation kaya.
[1026] <prose> Because able to perform emanation-kaya benefit—emanation kaya.
[1027] <prose> Because performing all actions—emanation kaya.
[1028] <prose> Because able to liberate numberless beings into expanse—emanation kaya.
[1029] <prose> Because brief in time in one field realm—emanation kaya.
[1030] <prose> Because compassion arising without direction—emanation kaya. || 1030 ||
[1031] <prose> Because wrathful and fierce—emanation kaya.
[1032] <prose> Because peaceful and certain—emanation kaya.
[1033] <prose> Because beings see as beautiful—emanation kaya.
[1034] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[1035] <prose> Third, the characteristics:
[1036] <prose> Performing disciples' two benefits completion:
[1037] <tantra> From that same nature:
[1038] <verse> Emanation-kaya characteristics:
[1039] <prose> Actions completion performing,
[1040] <prose> Two aspects considered. || 1040 ||
[1041] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[1042] <prose> Fourth, divisions: generally explained as nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation, and so forth;
[1043] <prose> On this occasion, depending upon two benefits' completion establishment,
[1044] <prose> Completed actions emanation-kaya
[1045] <prose> And performing actions emanation-kaya—these two held.
[1046] <prose> Moreover, completed actions emanation-kaya, self-benefit spontaneously established:
[1047] <prose> In this life or intermediate state, completing spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate,
[1048] <prose> Through three connections emanation, benefit performed for those arising as impurity-gate six realms self-appearance,
[1049] <prose> Merely in self-appearance, thoroughly purifying six families, expanse peaceful.
[1050] <prose> saṃsāra's self-appearance must emptied, || 1050 ||
[1051] <prose> For delusion-appearance must emptied.
[1052] <prose> In common as well:
[1053] <verse> "May saṃsāra's three lower realms be exhausted and emptied,"
[1054] <tantra> Thus it is said, and
[1055] <prose> For all beings' liberation mind producing sake.
[1056] <prose> Particularly in intermediate state: able or unable emanations release, opening emanations thus Buddha-becoming—all actions,
[1057] <prose> When six realms' stations appear below in spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate,
[1058] <prose> There, through Dharma teaching and so forth, benefit performed for that emptiness-appearing self-appearance,
[1059] <prose> By that cause, all saṃsāra-appearing becomes empty,
[1060] <prose> When dissolving into pure nirvāṇa expanse through spontaneous accomplishment gate, || 1060 ||
[1061] <prose> It is called "Buddha entering nirvāṇa."
[1062] <prose> This is crucially important to all wisdom-possessors.
[1063] <prose> Furthermore, that emptiness-appearing for self-benefit establishing, being self-arisen emanation that liberates self into expanse, is called completed actions emanation-kaya.
[1064] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[1065] <verse> Completed actions emanation-kaya:
[1066] <prose> Liberating one's own continuum, manifestly awakened,
[1067] <tantra> From that, distributing emanations.
[1068] <prose> Outer-inner actions complete—
[1069] <prose> Considered as completed actions emanation-kaya.
[1070] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 1070 ||
[1071] <prose> Emanations distributing manner:
[1072] <prose> When seeing spontaneously accomplished intermediate state's eight gates completion,
[1073] <prose> Liberated by knowing self-face,
[1074] <prose> In impure saṃsāra's gate,
[1075] <prose> Oneself, from Sambhogakāya father-mother union's secret space, radiating light rays, entering individually into each station's pure father-mother womb, appearing to be born—through Dharma teaching, showing liberation.
[1076] <prose> This is like dream emanations opening example,
[1077] <prose> Summarized merely as self-appearance.
[1078] <prose> When channels and elements nearly pure, in this life also six realms appear inside thigle;
[1079] <prose> These bound by three inner crucial points binding, reaching exhaustion ground, not depending on emanations distributing.
[1080] <prose> This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, is my power. || 1080 ||
[1081] <prose> Second, performing actions emanation-kaya:
[1082] <prose> To ground-abiders, Sambhogakāya;
[1083] <prose> To impure, supreme emanation-kaya;
[1084] <prose> To very impure, emanating into suitable beings according to individual stations, performing individual beings' benefit.
[1085] <tantra> From that same nature:
[1086] <verse> Performing actions emanation-kaya:
[1087] <prose> Showing to each whatever tames them,
[1088] <prose> Appearing suitable to others—
[1089] <prose> That is like above.
[1090] <ornament> Not deluded regarding others' benefit, || 1090 ||
[1091] <prose> Able to transform into anything.
[1092] <prose> Appearing suitable to others,
[1093] <prose> Overwhelming beings.
[1094] <prose> Afflictions naturally non-existent,
[1095] <prose> Latencies appearing like body.
[1096] <prose> To time-arrived beings,
[1097] <prose> Showing great correct benefit.
[1098] <prose> To whatever beings are tamed,
[1099] <prose> Appearing suitable to that.
[1100] <tantra> Thus it is said. || 1100 ||
[1101] <prose> That emanation-kaya also performs benefit through four individual correct knowledges:
[1102] <prose> Teaching Dharma in each being's own language through all languages' individual correct knowledge;
[1103] <prose> Also knowing faculties and latencies, showing suitable to that thought;
[1104] <prose> Also great vehicle
[1105] <prose> And small,
[1106] <prose> And various,
[1107] <prose> And secret mantra: generation and completion;
[1108] <prose> Individual and
[1109] <prose> Mind and
[1110] <prose> Wisdom and || 1110 ||
[1111] <prose> All-ground and
[1112] <prose> All-ground Dharmakāya showing and so forth, though showing many,
[1113] <prose> Dzogpa Chenpo's nature appears to some fortunate ones at times and occasions, not universally.
[1114] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[1115] <verse> All languages knowing,
[1116] <prose> In whatever language, that showing.
[1117] <prose> Harmonious gathering through harmony,
[1118] <prose> Sometimes through words' gate showing,
[1119] <prose> Sometimes through dependent arising's gate showing,
[1120] <prose> Sometimes through blessing-engagement's gate showing, || 1120 ||
[1121] <prose> Sometimes through generation's gate showing,
[1122] <prose> Sometimes through both's gate showing,
[1123] <prose> Sometimes through five awakenings showing,
[1124] <prose> Sometimes through three concentrations showing,
[1125] <prose> Sometimes expanse and wisdom showing,
[1126] <prose> Dzogchen meaning is not contradictory.
[1127] <prose> Appears to some fortunate individuals.
[1128] <prose> That showing manner is thus:
[1129] <prose> Sometimes rigpa-emptiness showing,
[1130] <prose> Sometimes no-rigpa emptiness showing, || 1130 ||
[1131] <prose> Sometimes rigpa matter showing,
[1132] <prose> Sometimes rigpa alone showing,
[1133] <prose> Sometimes Kunzhi Dharmakāya showing,
[1134] <prose> Sometimes virtue-lacking sin-lacking showing,
[1135] <prose> Sometimes meditation-possessor showing,
[1136] <prose> Sometimes no-meditation showing.
[1137] <prose> Thus showing emanation-kaya
[1138] <prose> Secret mantra supreme's
[1139] <prose> Meaning from some not spoken.
[1140] <prose> Not spoken, speaking does not occur. || 1140 ||
[1141] <prose> Though occasionally becomes spoken,
[1142] <prose> Arhats, pratyekabuddhas, sutras,
[1143] <prose> Hinayana—name also non-existent inside,
[1144] <prose> Supreme vehicle proclaims.
[1145] <prose> Therefore hidden from other dull intellects.
[1146] <prose> That person possessing those,
[1147] <prose> Performing actions emanation-kaya is considered.
[1148] <tantra> Thus.
[1149] <prose> Also though Dzogpa Chenpo possible to arise,
[1150] <tantra> From mind-expanse and pith instruction's very secret cycle down, || 1150 ||
[1151] <prose> This Nyingtik supreme from universal possibility does not arise, thus extremely rare dharma section—know thus.
[1152] <prose> Therefore like jewel, hold as cherished ornament;
[1153] <tantra> From Uttaratantra:
[1154] <verse> Rare arising, stainless,
[1155] <prose> Powerful, and world's
[1156] <prose> Ornament becoming, thus jewel itself.
[1157] <tantra> As spoken thus.
[1158] <prose> Fifth, emanation-kaya's examination method:
[1159] <prose> Teaching dharma with benefit-happiness to common world beings and
[1160] <prose> Through Buddha's emanation, two benefits appear somewhat similar; || 1160 ||
[1161] <prose> That certain examination:
[1162] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[1163] <prose> Know emanation examining method like this:
[1164] <prose> Even when descending, gaze not wandering elsewhere,
[1165] <prose> In crown ushnisha, one hair cluster curling right,
[1166] <prose> In heart center, vajra form,
[1167] <prose> Royal caste or high caste birth.
[1168] <prose> Conducting conduct suitable to whatever,
[1169] <prose> Following in that whatever spoken,
[1170] <prose> Not establishing own preferred desires, || 1170 ||
[1171] <prose> Deed, effort, grasping naturally non-existent,
[1172] <prose> Clearing whatever beings desire doubt.
[1173] <prose> Know that one possessing those is emanation-kaya—thus spoken.
[1174] <prose> Although these marks exist showing that as emanation,
[1175] <prose> Whether others suitable emanations or not uncertain;
[1176] <prose> With pure mind produced, strive to tame own continuum.
[1177] <ornament> Second: Individually explained, five kayas' enumeration—essence,
[1178] <break> <list> Etymology,
[1179] <break> <list> Appearance,
[1180] <list> Division, || 1180 ||
[1181] <list> And meaning application—five aspects.
