[21447] <prose> First, Nirmāṇakāya essence: from expanse-kaya and rigpa, radiating as light-kaya and so forth, performing others' benefit.
[21448] <prose> The etymology:
[21449] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[21450] <break> <prose> Know these emanation-kaya etymologies:
[21451] <break> <prose> Because appearing suitable to world-realms beings—emanation kaya.
[21452] <prose> Because able to perform emanation-kaya benefit—emanation kaya.
[21453] <prose> Because performing all actions—emanation kaya.
[21454] <prose> Because able to liberate numberless beings into expanse—emanation kaya.
[21455] <prose> Because brief in time in one field realm—emanation kaya.
[21456] <prose> Because compassion arising without direction—emanation kaya. || 1030 ||
[21457] <prose> Because wrathful and fierce—emanation kaya.
[21458] <prose> Because peaceful and certain—emanation kaya.
[21459] <prose> Because beings see as beautiful—emanation kaya.
[21460] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21461] <prose> Third, the characteristics:
[21462] <prose> Performing disciples' two benefits completion:
[21463] <tantra> From that same nature:
[21464] <verse> Emanation-kaya characteristics:
[21465] <prose> Actions completion performing,
[21466] <prose> Two aspects considered. || 1040 ||
[21467] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21468] <prose> Fourth, divisions: generally explained as nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation, and so forth;
[21469] <prose> On this occasion, depending upon two benefits' completion establishment,
[21470] <prose> Completed actions emanation-kaya
[21471] <prose> And performing actions emanation-kaya—these two held.
[21472] <prose> Moreover, completed actions emanation-kaya, self-benefit spontaneously established:
[21473] <prose> In this life or intermediate state, completing spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate,
[21474] <prose> Through three connections emanation, benefit performed for those arising as impurity-gate six realms self-appearance,
[21475] <prose> Merely in self-appearance, thoroughly purifying six families, expanse peaceful.
[21476] <prose> saṃsāra's self-appearance must emptied, || 1050 ||
[21477] <prose> For delusion-appearance must emptied.
[21478] <prose> In common as well:
[21479] <verse> "May saṃsāra's three lower realms be exhausted and emptied,"
[21480] <tantra> Thus it is said, and
[21481] <prose> For all beings' liberation mind producing sake.
[21482] <prose> Particularly in intermediate state: able or unable emanations release, opening emanations thus Buddha-becoming—all actions,
[21483] <prose> When six realms' stations appear below in spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate,
[21484] <prose> There, through Dharma teaching and so forth, benefit performed for that emptiness-appearing self-appearance,
[21485] <prose> By that cause, all saṃsāra-appearing becomes empty,
[21486] <prose> When dissolving into pure nirvāṇa expanse through spontaneous accomplishment gate, || 1060 ||
[21487] <prose> It is called "Buddha entering nirvāṇa."
[21488] <prose> This is crucially important to all wisdom-possessors.
[21489] <prose> Furthermore, that emptiness-appearing for self-benefit establishing, being self-arisen emanation that liberates self into expanse, is called completed actions emanation-kaya.
[21490] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[21491] <verse> Completed actions emanation-kaya:
[21492] <prose> Liberating one's own continuum, manifestly awakened,
[21493] <tantra> From that, distributing emanations.
[21494] <prose> Outer-inner actions complete—
[21495] <prose> Considered as completed actions emanation-kaya.
[21496] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 1070 ||
[21497] <prose> Emanations distributing manner:
[21498] <prose> When seeing spontaneously accomplished intermediate state's eight gates completion,
[21499] <prose> Liberated by knowing self-face,
[21500] <prose> In impure saṃsāra's gate,
[21501] <prose> Oneself, from Sambhogakāya father-mother union's secret space, radiating light rays, entering individually into each station's pure father-mother womb, appearing to be born—through Dharma teaching, showing liberation.
[21502] <prose> This is like dream emanations opening example,
[21503] <prose> Summarized merely as self-appearance.
[21504] <prose> When channels and elements nearly pure, in this life also six realms appear inside thigle;
[21505] <prose> These bound by three inner crucial points binding, reaching exhaustion ground, not depending on emanations distributing.
[21506] <prose> This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, is my power. || 1080 ||
[21507] <prose> Second, performing actions emanation-kaya:
[21508] <prose> To ground-abiders, Sambhogakāya;
[21509] <prose> To impure, supreme emanation-kaya;
[21510] <prose> To very impure, emanating into suitable beings according to individual stations, performing individual beings' benefit.
[21511] <tantra> From that same nature:
[21512] <verse> Performing actions emanation-kaya:
[21513] <prose> Showing to each whatever tames them,
[21514] <prose> Appearing suitable to others—
[21515] <prose> That is like above.
[21516] <ornament> Not deluded regarding others' benefit, || 1090 ||
[21517] <prose> Able to transform into anything.
[21518] <prose> Appearing suitable to others,
[21519] <prose> Overwhelming beings.
[21520] <prose> Afflictions naturally non-existent,
[21521] <prose> Latencies appearing like body.
[21522] <prose> To time-arrived beings,
[21523] <prose> Showing great correct benefit.
[21524] <prose> To whatever beings are tamed,
[21525] <prose> Appearing suitable to that.
[21526] <tantra> Thus it is said. || 1100 ||
[21527] <prose> That emanation-kaya also performs benefit through four individual correct knowledges:
[21528] <prose> Teaching Dharma in each being's own language through all languages' individual correct knowledge;
[21529] <prose> Also knowing faculties and latencies, showing suitable to that thought;
[21530] <prose> Also great vehicle
[21531] <prose> And small,
[21532] <prose> And various,
[21533] <prose> And secret mantra: generation and completion;
[21534] <prose> Individual and
[21535] <prose> Mind and
[21536] <prose> Wisdom and || 1110 ||
[21537] <prose> All-ground and
[21538] <prose> All-ground Dharmakāya showing and so forth, though showing many,
[21539] <prose> Dzogpa Chenpo's nature appears to some fortunate ones at times and occasions, not universally.
[21540] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[21541] <verse> All languages knowing,
[21542] <prose> In whatever language, that showing.
[21543] <prose> Harmonious gathering through harmony,
[21544] <prose> Sometimes through words' gate showing,
[21545] <prose> Sometimes through dependent arising's gate showing,
[21546] <prose> Sometimes through blessing-engagement's gate showing, || 1120 ||
[21547] <prose> Sometimes through generation's gate showing,
[21548] <prose> Sometimes through both's gate showing,
[21549] <prose> Sometimes through five awakenings showing,
[21550] <prose> Sometimes through three concentrations showing,
[21551] <prose> Sometimes expanse and wisdom showing,
[21552] <prose> Dzogchen meaning is not contradictory.
[21553] <prose> Appears to some fortunate individuals.
[21554] <prose> That showing manner is thus:
[21555] <prose> Sometimes rigpa-emptiness showing,
[21556] <prose> Sometimes no-rigpa emptiness showing, || 1130 ||
[21557] <prose> Sometimes rigpa matter showing,
[21558] <prose> Sometimes rigpa alone showing,
[21559] <prose> Sometimes Kunzhi Dharmakāya showing,
[21560] <prose> Sometimes virtue-lacking sin-lacking showing,
[21561] <prose> Sometimes meditation-possessor showing,
[21562] <prose> Sometimes no-meditation showing.
[21563] <prose> Thus showing emanation-kaya
[21564] <prose> Secret mantra supreme's
[21565] <prose> Meaning from some not spoken.
[21566] <prose> Not spoken, speaking does not occur. || 1140 ||
[21567] <prose> Though occasionally becomes spoken,
[21568] <prose> Arhats, pratyekabuddhas, sutras,
[21569] <prose> Hinayana—name also non-existent inside,
[21570] <prose> Supreme vehicle proclaims.
[21571] <prose> Therefore hidden from other dull intellects.
[21572] <prose> That person possessing those,
[21573] <prose> Performing actions emanation-kaya is considered.
[21574] <tantra> Thus.
[21575] <prose> Also though Dzogpa Chenpo possible to arise,
[21576] <tantra> From mind-expanse and pith instruction's very secret cycle down, || 1150 ||
[21577] <prose> This Nyingtik supreme from universal possibility does not arise, thus extremely rare dharma section—know thus.
[21578] <prose> Therefore like jewel, hold as cherished ornament;
[21579] <tantra> From Uttaratantra:
[21580] <verse> Rare arising, stainless,
[21581] <prose> Powerful, and world's
[21582] <prose> Ornament becoming, thus jewel itself.
[21583] <tantra> As spoken thus.
[21584] <prose> Fifth, emanation-kaya's examination method:
[21585] <prose> Teaching dharma with benefit-happiness to common world beings and
[21586] <prose> Through Buddha's emanation, two benefits appear somewhat similar; || 1160 ||
[21587] <prose> That certain examination:
[21588] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[21589] <prose> Know emanation examining method like this:
[21590] <prose> Even when descending, gaze not wandering elsewhere,
[21591] <prose> In crown ushnisha, one hair cluster curling right,
[21592] <prose> In heart center, vajra form,
[21593] <prose> Royal caste or high caste birth.
[21594] <prose> Conducting conduct suitable to whatever,
[21595] <prose> Following in that whatever spoken,
[21596] <prose> Not establishing own preferred desires, || 1170 ||
[21597] <prose> Deed, effort, grasping naturally non-existent,
[21598] <prose> Clearing whatever beings desire doubt.
[21599] <prose> Know that one possessing those is emanation-kaya—thus spoken.
[21600] <prose> Although these marks exist showing that as emanation,
[21601] <prose> Whether others suitable emanations or not uncertain;
[21602] <prose> With pure mind produced, strive to tame own continuum.
[21603] <ornament> Second: Individually explained, five kayas' enumeration—essence,
[21604] <break> <list> Etymology,
[21605] <break> <list> Appearance,
[21606] <list> Division, || 1180 ||
[21607] <list> And meaning application—five aspects.
