[37196] <ornament> The fourth: extensively explained enumerations from body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities: || 16770 ||
[37197] <prose> Body appearing to beings as appropriate, — yet each's own aspect's marks and signs perfected;
[37198] <prose> Speech: well-connected sixty limbs' sound arrangement;
[37199] <prose> Mind: knowing extent of things as they are and as they appear;
[37200] <prose> Qualities: perfected knowing of powers and so forth's dharmas without remainder;
[37201] <prose> Activities: turning the wheel of five perfections' nature—external, internal, and secret Dharma-wheels.
[37202] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[37203] <tantra> "Emanation-kāya too: body, speech, mind,
[37204] <tantra> Qualities, activities—five aspects.
[37205] <tantra> Body: marks and signs,
[37206] <tantra> Whichever body arises for those to be trained. || 16780 ||
[37207] <break> <tantra> Speech: well-connected words,
[37208] <tantra> Brahma's Expanse: six limbs.
[37209] <break> <tantra> Mind: through knower-known wisdom,
[37210] <tantra> Abides intending self-other benefit.
[37211] <tantra> Qualities: perfected knowing,
[37212] <tantra> Activities: external, internal, secret,
[37213] <tantra> Deeds completely perfected,
[37214] <tantra> Abide as five perfections."
[37215] <break> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37216] <break> <prose> These too: external five perfections: || 16790 ||
[37217] <prose> Perfect field: Vulture Peak;
[37218] <prose> Perfect teacher: Śākyamuni;
[37219] <prose> Perfect Dharma: various vehicles;
[37220] <prose> Perfect retinue: common and uncommon;
[37221] <prose> Perfect time: hundred-year lifespan.
[37222] <prose> Internal five perfections:
[37223] <prose> Perfect field: Akaniṣṭha;
[37224] <prose> Perfect teacher: Vajradhara;
[37225] <prose> Perfect retinue: ḍākinīs, accomplished ones, bodhisattvas;
[37226] <prose> Perfect Dharma: secret mantra external-internal dharmas; || 16800 ||
[37227] <prose> Perfect time: self-condition, karma, and fortune gathering.
[37228] <prose> Secret five perfections:
[37229] <prose> Perfect field: blazing fire charnel ground;
[37230] <prose> Perfect teacher: glorious powerful youth hero;
[37231] <prose> Perfect retinue: ḍākinīs and so forth;
[37232] <prose> Perfect Dharma:
[37233] <prose> Natural Great Perfection,
[37234] <tantra> Secret unsurpassed Tantra, seven essences;
[37235] <prose> Perfect time: taught when conditions are completely pure.
[37236] <prose> Thus shown: all emanation-kāya teachers possess external, internal, and secret five perfections. || 16810 ||
[37237] <ornament> The second: detailed explanation of wisdoms' fields comprises three aspects:
[37238] <list> Essence;
[37239] <list> Definitive terminology;
[37240] <prose> Essence: self-knowing nature, free from elaboration.
[37241] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[37242] <tantra> "From thought-free Dharmatā self-clarity,
[37243] <tantra> Unobservable wisdom-appearance arises."
[37244] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37245] <prose> Definitive terminology, from that text:
[37246] <verse> "First-arisen wisdom, || 16820 ||
[37247] <break> <prose> Through knowing, afflictions' flaws are purified."
[37248] <break> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37249] <prose> Divisions: three—
[37250] <list> Dharma-kāya ground-abiding wisdom;
[37251] <list> Saṃbhoga-kāya self-mark-grasping wisdom;
[37252] <list> Emanation-kāya all-pervasive wisdom.
[37253] <ornament> The first: from essence, nature, and compassion three—
[37254] <prose> Essence: primordially pure wisdom, awareness empty-clarity, stainless, ultimate—Dharma-kāya, free from elaboration-extremes, twofold-pure expanse's nature,
[37255] <prose> Abiding as manifestation-ground of three-kāyas' non-duality.
[37256] <prose> Nature: spontaneous presence wisdom, depth-clear light's manifestation-ground abiding, fields and celestial palaces and light-rays and so forth appearing, fulfilling those to be trained's hopes. || 16830 ||
[37257] <prose> All-pervasive compassion wisdom: in its own time, though elaborations completely subside, without convention of entering objects, abiding as all-knowing wisdom's manifestation-ground—without moving from great spontaneous presence of Expanse and wisdom, performing beings' two benefits without movement or effortful striving, making seeds.
[37258] <tantra> From Six Expanses:
[37259] <tantra> "Through essence primordially pure wisdom,
[37260] <break> <tantra> Non-recognition's stain separated from awareness;
[37261] <break> <tantra> Through nature spontaneous presence wisdom,
[37262] <tantra> Liberated from delusion's word-harm;
[37263] <tantra> Through all-pervasive compassion wisdom,
[37264] <tantra> All appears connected in single Expanse."
[37265] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37266] <prose> In Dharma-kāya's emptiness aspect, if there were no ground-abiding wisdom's manifestation-ground or seed-like manifestation, above: Buddhas awakening from delusion would be severed; || 16840 ||
[37267] <prose> Below: sentient beings revolving in delusion would be severed—
[37268] <prose> Thus those to be trained and trainers would be impossible.
[37269] <break> <prose> Yet from ground-abiding wisdom, external manifestation appears,
[37270] <break> <prose> And for saṃsāra's duration, benefit for sentient beings arises from spontaneous presence compassion's depth-clear perfected knowing-family.
[37271] <break> <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[37272] <break> <tantra> "From Dharma-kāya emptiness' nature,
[37273] <tantra> Wisdom's perfected knowing aspect,
[37274] <tantra> Spontaneously appears to sentient beings;
[37275] <tantra> Without this, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa would be severed.
[37276] <tantra> Knowing knows and is clear; || 16850 ||
[37277] <tantra> From self-knowing self-clarity's identity,
[37278] <tantra> Spontaneous presence compassion-nature itself,
[37279] <tantra> Unceasing, without cessation."
[37280] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37281] <ornament> The second: saṃbhoga-kāya's five wisdoms—
[37282] <prose> Individual mark-grasping:
[37283] <prose> For Vairocana: Dharmadhātu wisdom chief,
[37284] <prose> Other four as retinue;
[37285] <prose> For Akṣobhya: mirror-like wisdom chief,
[37286] <break> <prose> For Ratnasambhava: equality, || 16860 ||
[37287] <break> <prose> For Amitābha: discriminating,
[37288] <prose> For Amoghasiddhi: all-accomplishing wisdom chief,
[37289] <prose> Other four each as retinue—thus twenty-five wisdoms, and from these, immeasurable.
[37290] <prose> Summarized as five:
[37291] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[37292] <tantra> "Wisdom divisions thus:
[37293] <tantra> From twenty-five's essence,
[37294] <tantra> Summarized as five aspects."
[37295] <break> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37296] <break> <prose> How they gather: || 16870 ||
[37297] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[37298] <tantra> "Saṃbhoga-kāya's mark-grasping wisdom:
[37299] <tantra> Through pure objects, mirror-like—
[37300] <tantra> saṃsāra-nirvāṇa reflections clear.
[37301] <tantra> Through directionlessness, equality;
[37302] <break> <tantra> Showing faculties' objects, discriminating;
[37303] <break> <tantra> Without effort, all-accomplishing;
[37304] <tantra> Without distinction: Dharmadhātu."
[37305] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37306] <prose> These extensively explained previously; not elaborated again. || 16880 ||
[37307] <ornament> The third: emanation-kāya's two wisdoms—
[37308] <prose> Pervading all knowables,
[37309] <prose> Knowing all included in appearance as extent,
[37310] <prose> Knowing all included in emptiness as nature,
[37311] <prose> Knowing all conventional phenomena without mixture, and guiding immeasurable collections of those to be trained's faculties, dispositions, and latencies,
[37312] <prose> Knowing ultimate Dharmatā, assembling phenomena of emptiness,
[37313] <prose> Marklessness,
[37314] <prose> And luminosity.
[37315] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[37316] <tantra> "Emanation-kāya's knowables: || 16890 ||
[37317] <tantra> Through knowing nature of things,
[37318] <tantra> Knowing phenomena's pattern in itself;
[37319] <tantra> Through knowing extent,
[37320] <tantra> Knowing those to be trained's thoughts;
[37321] <tantra> Thus from compassion's manifestation manner,
[37322] <tantra> To various beings' migrations,
[37323] <tantra> Trainer-kāya too is merely that."
[37324] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37325] <tantra> Those wisdoms, meaning: by gathering the three kāyas clearly within,
[37326] <tantra> In such Buddha's dharma-kāya place, || 16900 ||
[37327] <tantra> The three wisdoms present in ground:
[37328] <tantra> Essence-wisdom: pristine,
[37329] <tantra> Self-originated wisdom,
[37330] <tantra> Compassion's wisdom aspects complete without interruption of marks—
[37331] <tantra> Through awareness-clarity's aspect, knowing arises as ground-appearance.
[37332] <tantra> In saṃbhoga-kāya place, five distinct wisdoms:
[37333] <tantra> Dharma-expanse,
[37334] <tantra> Like mirror,
[37335] <tantra> Equality,
[37336] <tantra> Individualizing, || 16910 ||
[37337] <tantra> Accomplishing-wisdom: appearing as objects and object-holders, not as such but as self-clarity.
[37338] <tantra> In emanation-kāya time, two wisdoms:
[37339] <tantra> Like and such knowing-wisdom.
[37340] <tantra> Those two also not as actions and actors, but knowing as spontaneously accomplished.
[37341] <tantra> Thus the three wisdoms' self-nature knowing:
[37342] <tantra> For emanation-kāya, appearing as knowable object's aspects, empty-appearing duality knowing,
[37343] <tantra> Dharmic meaning's aspects and
[37344] <tantra> Dharma peacefulness aspects, all-knowing wisdom,
[37345] <tantra> Saṃbhoga-kāya's direct appearance, clear light wisdom's knowable aspects clearly knowing,
[37346] <tantra> All-knowing wisdom and || 16920 ||
[37347] <tantra> Dharma-kāya's inner-clarity essence ground-abiding wisdom's appearance.
[37348] <tantra>
[37349] <tantra> In pristine expanse, self-known clearly, dwelling in pure aspect:
[37350] <tantra> From lamp's appearance,
[37351] <tantra> To perfect Buddha,
[37352] <tantra> Three wisdom-aspects:
[37353] <tantra> All-aspect knowing,
[37354] <tantra> All-knowing wisdom and
[37355] <tantra> Ground-abiding wisdom.
[37356] <tantra> Emanation-kāya's wisdom-aspects two: || 16930 ||
[37357] <tantra> Knowing suchness,
[37358] <tantra> Knowing suchness's meanings.
[37359] <tantra> Saṃbhoga-kāya's wisdom:
[37360] <tantra> Clear light self-appearance, knowing clearly,
[37361] <tantra> Dharma-wisdom ground-abiding,
[37362] <tantra> Awareness aspect illuminating,
[37363] <tantra> Without conceptual elaboration,
[37364] <tantra> Like space, spontaneous compassion.
[37365] <tantra> Clear and knowing, awareness present,
[37366] <tantra> Without mixing aspects, abiding. || 16940 ||
[37367] <break> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37368] <break> <tantra> The third: summary of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities, two aspects: explaining essence and elaborating expanded nature.
[37369] <tantra> First:
[37370] <tantra> Thus, Buddha's dharma gathering all:
[37371] <tantra> Indestructible body, jewel-ornament's maṇḍala appearing with form-body's marks and signs,
[37372] <tantra> Dharma-kāya all-peaceful pristine nature,
[37373] <tantra> Speech indestructible, jewel-ornament's dharma-aspects infinite inconceivable maṇḍala,
[37374] <tantra> Mind indestructible, jewel-ornament's inconceivable non-conceptual nature,
[37375] <tantra> Direct knowing, inconceivable ocean's heart,
[37376] <tantra> Indestructible qualities: jewel-ornament, || 16950 ||
[37377] <tantra> Ten powers,
[37378] <tantra> Four fearlessnesses,
[37379] <tantra> Great compassion,
[37380] <tantra> Remembering close placement,
[37381] <tantra> Indestructible activities: jewel-ornament, reaching world's limit, spontaneously accomplishing all beings' two purposes.
[37382] <tantra> This much, know that Buddha's dharma-aspects are complete.
[37383] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37384] <tantra>
[37385] <tantra> Second:
[37386] <tantra> Body, || 16960 ||
[37387] <tantra> Speech,
[37388] <tantra> Mind.
[37389] <break> <tantra> The three aspects: activities, functions, and wisdom.
[37390] <break> <tantra> Such qualities and activities arise.
[37391] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37392] <tantra> Of the second, explaining expanded nature:
[37393] <tantra> Body has three: nirmāṇakāya, sambhogakāya, dharmakāya.
[37394] <tantra> Speech has three: nirmāṇakāya's speech, sambhogakāya's speech, dharmakāya's speech.
[37395] <tantra> Mind has three: nirmāṇakāya's mind, sambhogakāya's mind, dharmakāya's mind.
[37396] <tantra> Activities: from body-speech-mind arising, three thousand world-systems' activities accomplished. || 16970 ||
[37397] <tantra> This is the completion of all aspects.
