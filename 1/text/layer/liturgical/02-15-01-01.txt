[20427] <prose>
[20428] <break> <prose> The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, Latter Volume.
[20429] <break> <prose>
[20430] <break> <prose>
[20431] <break> <prose> Thus having shown the distinction of alaya-ground and Dharmakāya, and so forth,
[20432] <prose> Now, regarding the explanation of dependent arising's nature, there are two:
[20433] <prose> The common distinction,
[20434] <prose> And the extensive explanation of individual natures.
[20435] <ornament> First:
[20436] <prose> Outer-arising and inner-arising—two types. || 10 ||
[20437] <prose> From the Self-Arisen:
[20438] <prose> The two types of arising are shown.
[20439] <prose> Outer-arising and inner-arising.
[20440] <prose> Thus it is said.
[20441] <prose> Outer-arising—earth, water, and so forth—these exist as the ground for inner-arising; connected as basis and dependent, — therefore established as twofold.
[20442] <prose> Without depending upon these two, no beings nor buddhas exist.
[20443] <prose> All beings move within the confused expanse of the five-arising,
[20444] <prose> Possessing the self-nature of the great arising.
[20445] <prose> All buddhas dwell in the expanse of the five pure-arisings: earth without solidity, and so forth,
[20446] <prose> Moving in the complete cessation of the five great arising's stains. || 20 ||
[20447] <prose> Furthermore, the five great arising possess luminosity-wisdom and five colors;
[20448] <prose> The five small arisings are earth, water, fire, wind, and space.
[20449] <prose> The five pure arisings are:
[20450] <prose> Clear,
[20451] <prose> Warm,
[20452] <prose> Bright,
[20453] <prose> Cool,
[20454] <prose> Spacious,
[20455] <prose> Holding the self-nature of movement.
[20456] <prose> From the five confused arisings, the five luminous arrive in the expanse, meeting the inner expanse, || 30 ||
[20457] <prose> Like the purity of the great arising of spontaneous presence's appearance.
[20458] <prose> Regarding the small arising, also arising-form,
[20459] <prose> And actual arising—two.
[20460] <prose> Arising-form is the five appearing now externally: earth, water, fire, wind, and space.
[20461] <prose> Actual arising is the five qualities of the body—thin, and so forth—becoming the five inner-arising bases.
[20462] <prose> Inner-arising:
[20463] <prose> The five individual dharma-arisings, bases of pure realms.
[20464] <prose> Therefore all saṃsāra and nirvāṇa do not move from the expanse of the five-arising;
[20465] <prose> Before the five-arising, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa do not arise.
[20466] <prose> From the Self-Arisen: || 40 ||
[20467] <prose> Kye Ho! Secret Lord, listen!
[20468] <prose> The characteristics of the five-arising:
[20469] <prose> I show—you must understand.
[20470] <prose> The great arising, Bhagavan,
[20471] <prose> Exist as the nature of all beings.
[20472] <prose> All beings of the three realms
[20473] <prose> Move in the expanse of the five-arising.
[20474] <prose> Before the time when the five-arising did not exist,
[20475] <prose> Neither buddhas nor beings—even names did not exist.
[20476] <prose> The five-arising themselves are the mother-expanse. || 50 ||
[20477] <prose> Not established from the five-arising,
[20478] <prose> Not even one birth-going being exists.
[20479] <prose> The five-arisings of beings dwelling therein
[20480] <prose> Are shown as twofold.
[20481] <prose> Thus it is said.
[20482] <ornament> Second: Regarding the extensive explanation of individual natures, there are two:
[20483] <prose> The extensive explanation of outer-arising,
[20484] <prose> And the extensive explanation of inner-arising.
[20485] <prose> First among these:
[20486] <prose> Essence, || 60 ||
[20487] <break> <prose> Definitive terminology,
[20488] <break> <prose> Purpose,
[20489] <prose> Characteristics,
[20490] <prose> Sequence of functions,
[20491] <prose> Dharma-nature,
[20492] <prose> Applied meaning,
[20493] <prose> Manner of liberation,
[20494] <prose> Divisions,
[20495] <prose> And the tenfold manner of completeness.
[20496] <prose> First, the essence: || 70 ||
[20497] <prose> Outer-arising appearing as form is the play of inner-arising's actuality;
[20498] <prose> Therefore, gathered within the inner domain, these are the five-arising.
[20499] <prose> From the Self-Arisen:
[20500] <prose> The outer-arising are thus:
[20501] <prose> Earth and water and fire,
[20502] <prose> And likewise wind and space.
[20503] <prose> Thus it is said.
[20504] <prose> The five forms of outer-arising become the appearing container-support for beings;
[20505] <prose> The five actualities of inner-arising become the support for mind and awareness.
[20506] <prose> From the Thal 'gyur: || 80 ||
[20507] <prose> The assertion regarding arising is thus:
[20508] <prose> From the particularities of general-common karma,
[20509] <prose> By individual karma-supports of beings,
[20510] <prose> Relying upon the outer-arising,
[20511] <prose> Karma, sustenance, and faculties,
[20512] <prose> Entourage and birth—complete.
[20513] <prose> Thus.
[20514] <prose> Second, the definitive terminology:
[20515] <prose> From the Self-Arisen:
[20516] <prose> The definitive terminology of arising is thus: || 90 ||
[20517] <prose> Not made by fabrication, spontaneously complete;
[20518] <prose> By that which produces, they are arising;
[20519] <prose> Pervading all migrators, they are great-arising;
[20520] <prose> By simultaneous birth, they are great-arising;
[20521] <prose> Existing in themselves, they are great-arising;
[20522] <prose> Without change, they are great-arising;
[20523] <prose> Appearing harmoniously, they are great-arising.
[20524] <prose> The definitive terminology of great-arising—thus.
[20525] <prose> Thus.
[20526] <prose> Third, the purpose: || 100 ||
[20527] <prose> From the Thal 'gyur:
[20528] <prose> The inquiry into arising's purpose is thus:
[20529] <prose> Water gathers the clear essence
[20530] <prose> And separates the impurities—this is its function.
[20531] <prose> As it acts within each individual body,
[20532] <prose> Its purpose is known as heat and cold.
[20533] <prose> Earth holds the foundation
[20534] <prose> And performs establishing and cohering functions.
[20535] <prose> By ripening, it produces roots and so forth;
[20536] <prose> Its purpose is known as the relative thigle. || 110 ||
[20537] <prose> Fire increases the arising
[20538] <prose> And performs ripening and clarifying functions.
[20539] <prose> By blazing and spreading, it produces eyes and so forth;
[20540] <prose> Its purpose is made known as warmth.
[20541] <prose> Wind scatters and lifts
[20542] <prose> And performs moving and quivering functions.
[20543] <prose> By moving and trembling, it holds the body;
[20544] <prose> Its purpose is known as the abode of mind.
[20545] <prose> The four arising—the great mandala of self—
[20546] <prose> Become the cause for accomplishing body and so forth, || 120 ||
[20547] <prose> Abide in the middle and perform the holding function,
[20548] <prose> And in the end perform all destruction functions.
[20549] <prose> Through one cause, the great arising
[20550] <prose> Appear as the master performing the various.
[20551] <prose> Thus, regarding intention, self and other,
[20552] <prose> Skilled in the meaning of completed action.
[20553] <prose> Thus.
[20554] <prose> Fourth, the characteristics—from among five:
[20555] <prose> Earth-characteristic: solidity.
[20556] <prose> Water-characteristic: moisture. || 130 ||
[20557] <prose> Fire-characteristic: warmth.
[20558] <prose> Wind-characteristic: movement.
[20559] <prose> Space-characteristic: openness and spaciousness.
[20560] <prose> Fifth, the sequence of functions:
[20561] <prose> From the Thal 'gyur:
[20562] <prose> The sequence of inner-arising's functions:
[20563] <prose> Earth makes the body's ground;
[20564] <prose> By producing, flesh ripening is asserted.
[20565] <prose> Water gathers the entire body;
[20566] <prose> By producing, blood ripening is asserted. || 140 ||
[20567] <prose> Fire ripens the entire body;
[20568] <prose> By producing, warmth ripening is asserted.
[20569] <prose> Wind lifts the entire body;
[20570] <prose> By producing, breath ripening is made.
[20571] <prose> Thus.
[20572] <prose> Sixth, the dharma-nature:
[20573] <prose> Though generally empty, here the dharma-nature that holds its own characteristic, made authoritative as dharma-nature:
[20574] <prose> From the Self-Arisen:
[20575] <prose> The dharma-nature of the five-arising:
[20576] <prose> Arising's cause is earth. || 150 ||
[20577] <prose> Arising's wisdom is fire.
[20578] <prose> Arising's emanation is wind.
[20579] <prose> Arising's master is water.
[20580] <prose> Arising's dharma-nature is space.
[20581] <prose> Thus.
[20582] <prose> Seventh, the application of meaning—from two:
[20583] <prose> The application of meaning to the five-arising's essence:
[20584] <prose> From That Very:
[20585] <prose> The application of meaning to arising is thus:
[20586] <prose> Within Dharmakāya nature, primordially pure, || 160 ||
[20587] <prose> By essence without change, arising-earth also is.
[20588] <prose> By awareness-wisdom engaging meaning, arising-fire also is.
[20589] <prose> By awareness-wisdom, unmoved, gone into expanse, arising-wind also is.
[20590] <prose> By awareness-wisdom gathering three cavities as one, arising-water also is.
[20591] <prose> By wisdom dissolving into nondual empty-luminous manner, arising-space is.
[20592] <prose> Thus.
[20593] <prose> The application of meaning connecting the five-arising's individual meanings with inner awareness:
[20594] <prose> From the Norbu 'phrul bkod:
[20595] <prose> The five outer-arising are the common dharma of self-continuum;
[20596] <prose> By connecting all outer-appearing arising with self-awareness itself, they are the common dharma. || 170 ||
[20597] <prose> The divisions are thus:
[20598] <prose> Earth-characteristic, making solidity, also—
[20599] <prose> Connects with awareness-wisdom free from birth and destruction.
[20600] <prose> Wind-characteristic, making lifting,
[20601] <prose> Connects with awareness-wisdom without obstruction.
[20602] <prose> Fire-characteristic, making burning,
[20603] <prose> Connects with awareness-wisdom gone under afflictions' authority.
[20604] <prose> Water-characteristic, making moistening,
[20605] <prose> Connects with awareness-wisdom entering all objects.
[20606] <prose> Space-characteristic, vastness, || 180 ||
[20607] <prose> Connects with awareness-characteristic without break in continuity—thus it is said.
[20608] <prose> Eighth, the manner of the five-arising's liberation:
[20609] <prose> From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[20610] <prose> Space itself, by pervading emptiness,
[20611] <prose> Space itself liberates as entity.
[20612] <prose> Wind, by appearing without graspable object,
[20613] <prose> Liberates into entity-gathering's function.
[20614] <prose> Fire, by consuming what ripens,
[20615] <prose> Liberates by moving and separating clear from impure.
[20616] <prose> Earth, when making the producer lift, || 190 ||
[20617] <prose> Liberates into limitless empty non-entity.
[20618] <prose> Water, by moistening what gathers,
[20619] <prose> Liberates into burning-ripening's function.
[20620] <prose> Thus.
[20621] <prose> Explaining divisions:
[20622] <prose> Each of the five-arising—earth of earth, and so forth—five sets of five;
[20623] <prose> Enumeration of portions: twenty-five.
[20624] <prose> Again from That Very:
[20625] <prose> Space's wind toward entity,
[20626] <prose> Space's fire makes gathering, || 200 ||
[20627] <prose> Space's water makes burning,
[20628] <prose> Space's earth opens opportunity,
[20629] <prose> Space's space appears.
[20630] <prose> Wind's wind toward stability,
[20631] <prose> Wind's space: great sound-potential,
[20632] <prose> Wind's water: great quickness and speed,
[20633] <prose> Wind's fire: great projection and gathering,
[20634] <prose> Wind's earth: clear form-reflection.
[20635] <prose> Water's water: sound-echo,
[20636] <prose> Water's space: without obstruction, || 210 ||
[20637] <break> <prose> Water's wind: flows attachment-free,
[20638] <break> <prose> Water's fire: makes gathering,
[20639] <prose> Water's earth: makes pervading.
[20640] <prose> Fire's earth: makes producing,
[20641] <break> <prose> Fire's space: burns entity,
[20642] <break> <prose> Fire's wind: makes blazing,
[20643] <prose> Fire's water: makes destroying,
[20644] <prose> Fire's earth: holds.
[20645] <prose> Earth's earth: pervades migrators,
[20646] <prose> Earth's space: the mahayana, || 220 ||
[20647] <prose> Earth's wind: makes snow-empty,
[20648] <prose> Earth's water: produces entity,
[20649] <prose> Earth's fire: dries.
[20650] <prose> Thus.
[20651] <prose> By training in these distinctions, distinguished qualities; each accomplished. In that commentary it is explained—
[20652] <prose> Therefore, from the Sound Thal 'gyur also, it is stated that by training in the elements' sound-meaning, common attainments are obtained.
[20653] <prose> By that sound-meaning's particularities,
[20654] <prose> Definite showing of general forms.
[20655] <prose> By training in form, body becomes exhausted.
[20656] <prose> By sound, languages are known. || 230 ||
[20657] <prose> By smell, taking essence is accomplished.
[20658] <prose> By taste, entity becomes nectar.
[20659] <prose> Thus it is said; and
[20660] <tantra> From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra:
[20661] <prose> Earth, water, fire, wind—
[20662] <prose> The four elements' sounds and meanings,
[20663] <prose> By becoming familiar,
[20664] <prose> The six races' self-sounds
[20665] <prose> Arising clairvoyance accomplishes.
[20666] <prose> Thus. || 240 ||
[20667] <prose> These are the outer-arising—all beings' support and abode.
[20668] <prose> Tenth, regarding that and also other topics—the manner of showing how saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dharmas are complete in the yogi's body-mind—threefold:
[20669] <prose> Generally showing the partial-similarity completeness manner,
[20670] <prose> Explaining in particular the body-mind completeness manner,
[20671] <prose> Making understood through the play of great definite symbols.
[20672] <ornament> First:
[20673] <prose> In this dharma of gathered body-mind of migrators, all primordially self-arise with complete parts—
[20674] <prose> Father and mother as method and wisdom's portion;
[20675] <prose> Karma-projecting wind as Dharmakāya-awakening's portion;
[20676] <prose> Five elements' seeds as five families' sound-potential's portion; || 250 ||
[20677] <prose> Two equipoise essences as path's two accumulations' method-wisdom union's portion;
[20678] <prose> Womb-abiding as base-expanse-abiding's portion;
[20679] <prose> Body forming in seven seven-day sets as seven pure elements' seven paths' completing's portion;
[20680] <prose> Ten womb months as ten grounds' completing's portion;
[20681] <prose> Three-kaya buddhahood as path-completing's portion;
[20682] <prose> Birth as Nirmanakaya;
[20683] <prose> Body-abiding engaging fields as Sambhogakaya;
[20684] <prose> Death as Dharmakāya emptiness's portion arising;
[20685] <prose> The manner in which migrators, primordially traversing base-path-result, are liberated.
[20686] <prose> From the Mu tig phreng ba: || 260 ||
[20687] <prose> The Bhagavan spoke:
[20688] <prose> Not liberated by effort,
[20689] <prose> Abiding liberated from primordial.
[20690] <break> <prose> From method and wisdom's union, Father and mother are themselves the cause.
[20691] <break> <prose> Projecting wind's moving portion—
[20692] <prose> Self-aware awakening, great bliss.
[20693] <prose> Five-arising cause's seed
[20694] <prose> Arises, appearing from emptiness-field.
[20695] <prose> Two's bliss equipoise
[20696] <prose> Is wisdom itself arisen from method. || 270 ||
[20697] <prose> Womb-belly entering
[20698] <prose> Is self-awareness arising from base.
[20699] <prose> Seven seven-sets' realization measure.
[20700] <prose> Ten months' grounds traversing.
[20701] <prose> Birth itself is kaya-arising.
[20702] <prose> Producing body is base-appearing field.
[20703] <prose> Body-abiding is the base.
[20704] <prose> Aging is delusion's confusion-awakening.
[20705] <prose> Sickness itself is realization-confidence.
[20706] <prose> By death, liberation into dharmatā-emptiness. || 280 ||
[20707] <prose> Thus all appearing beings
[20708] <prose> Are primordially liberated without effort.
[20709] <prose> Thus.
[20710] <prose> Connecting with delusion-reversing particular manner:
[20711] <prose> Birth is awareness moving from expanse's portion.
[20712] <prose> Body is the base.
[20713] <prose> Outer-appearing portion is base-appearing spontaneous completion.
[20714] <prose> Sickness is realization meeting face-to-face.
[20715] <prose> Aging is truth-clinging's confusion-awakening.
[20716] <prose> Death, when knowing self-face, shows final arrival at primordial purity's ground in inner expanse's portion. || 290 ||
[20717] <prose> By these arising primordially, instruction introduction and
[20718] <prose> Empowerment,
[20719] <prose> Liberation through meditation—suitable.
[20720] <prose> If complete in partial similarity, not able to liberate through instruction;
[20721] <prose> By clearly showing that partial similarity exists, Buddha's dharma it is called.
[20722] <prose> Existing in base-path's primordial measure,
[20723] <break> <prose> What becomes shown as symbol-meaning by Buddha's speaking also arrives at this essence.
[20724] <break> <prose> Second, explaining body-mind completeness manner in particular—threefold:
[20725] <prose> Body,
[20726] <prose> Mind, || 300 ||
[20727] <prose> Awareness completeness manner.
[20728] <ornament> First:
[20729] <prose> In this four-arising gathered aggregate, outer container-world's portion and
[20730] <prose> Inner essence-migrants' portions—all complete.
[20731] <prose> From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[20732] <prose> Earth, water, fire, wind,
[20733] <prose> Space, sun, and moon,
[20734] <prose> Born males and females' forms,
[20735] <prose> Planets, stars, and clouds,
[20736] <prose> Trees, mountains, and rocks, || 310 ||
[20737] <prose> Roots, trunks, and branches,
[20738] <prose> Leaves, flowers, and fruits,
[20739] <break> <prose> Smells, tastes, sounds, and touches.
[20740] <break> <prose> Music, canopies,
[20741] <prose> Banners, and upper-canopies,
[20742] <prose> Those appearing surrounding dharmas—
[20743] <prose> Are complete in the yogi's own body.
[20744] <prose> Thus.
[20745] <prose> Explaining these portions extensively:
[20746] <prose> Earth's portion: flesh; || 320 ||
[20747] <break> <prose> Water's portion: blood;
[20748] <break> <prose> Fire's portion: warmth;
[20749] <prose> Wind's portion: breath;
[20750] <prose> Space's portion: mind;
[20751] <prose> Sun-moon's portion: two eyes;
[20752] <prose> Male's portion: birth;
[20753] <prose> Female's portion: death;
[20754] <prose> Planet's portion: desire's gate-house and two nostrils;
[20755] <prose> Star's portion: teeth;
[20756] <prose> Cloud's portion: hair; || 330 ||
[20757] <prose> Tree's portion: channels;
[20758] <prose> Mountain's portion: whole similar body;
[20759] <prose> Rock's portion: bones;
[20760] <prose> Tree-root's portion: heart;
[20761] <break> <prose> Branch's portion: limbs;
[20762] <break> <prose> Flower's portion: five faculties of eye and so forth;
[20763] <prose> Fruit's portion: accomplished as body's happiness-suffering;
[20764] <prose> Sound's portion: voice;
[20765] <prose> Form's portion: body;
[20766] <prose> Smell's portion: pores; || 340 ||
[20767] <prose> Taste's portion: skin;
[20768] <prose> Touch's portion: sickness;
[20769] <prose> Music's portion: channels and internal organs;
[20770] <prose> Canopy's portion: urine;
[20771] <prose> Parasol's portion: legs;
[20772] <prose> Banner's portion: name;
[20773] <prose> Upper-canopy's portion: breath.
[20774] <prose> Also, from the Mu tig phreng ba, thus stated:
[20775] <prose> Earth is flesh, entity itself;
[20776] <prose> Water is blood, gathering itself; || 350 ||
[20777] <prose> Fire is warmth, ripening all body;
[20778] <prose> Wind is breath, karma's container;
[20779] <prose> Space is mind, body's potential;
[20780] <prose> Sun-moon is eye, making clear;
[20781] <prose> Male is birth itself;
[20782] <prose> Female appears as death;
[20783] <prose> Planet is in mouth, star is teeth;
[20784] <prose> Cloud is in hair, tree is channels;
[20785] <prose> Mountain is in body, rock is bones;
[20786] <prose> Root is in heart, trunk is legs; || 360 ||
[20787] <prose> Branches are in limbs;
[20788] <prose> Flower itself is five faculties;
[20789] <prose> Fruit is accomplished in body;
[20790] <prose> Smell is pores, taste is skin;
[20791] <prose> Sound is in voice, touch is sickness;
[20792] <prose> Music is internal organs, canopy is water;
[20793] <prose> Parasol is legs, banner is name;
[20794] <prose> Upper-canopy is breath.
[20795] <prose> These are complete in the yogi's body.
[20796] <prose> Thus. || 370 ||
[20797] <prose> Second, in mind all saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dharmas, base and path, are completely present.
[20798] <prose> Again from That Very:
[20799] <prose> All white transcendence dharmas
[20800] <prose> Are completely present in body-mind;
[20801] <prose> Because saṃsāra dharmas are empty of transcendence,
[20802] <prose> Mandala, deity, offering,
[20803] <prose> Mantra, mudra, concentration,
[20804] <prose> Empowerment, samaya,
[20805] <prose> Instruction-giving, experience,
[20806] <prose> Likewise development stage, || 380 ||
[20807] <prose> Hearing, contemplating, meditating,
[20808] <prose> View, conduct, meditation,
[20809] <prose> Giving, ethics, patience,
[20810] <prose> Effort, concentration, wisdom,
[20811] <prose> Power, aspiration, wisdom,
[20812] <prose> Likewise method's perfection,
[20813] <prose> Ten virtues' conduct, and so forth,
[20814] <prose> Method and wisdom themselves,
[20815] <prose> Thus, from and so forth,
[20816] <prose> Those transcendence-indicating dharmas || 390 ||
[20817] <prose> Abide completely in body-mind,
[20818] <prose> Up to thus stated.
[20819] <prose> Third, awareness completeness manner:
[20820] <prose> Again from that:
[20821] <prose> In whatever self-appearing awareness's face,
[20822] <prose> All however-appearing dharmas are complete.
[20823] <prose> Thus stated; and
[20824] <prose> Thus in awareness itself:
[20825] <prose> Sun and moon: method and wisdom;
[20826] <prose> Male: base, female: path; || 400 ||
[20827] <prose> Planet: realization measure, star: dharma;
[20828] <prose> Cloud: compassion pervading all;
[20829] <prose> Tree: dharmatā-expanding path;
[20830] <prose> Mountain: view without change;
[20831] <prose> Rock: Dharmakāya free from birth and destruction;
[20832] <prose> Root: all dharmas' one cause;
[20833] <prose> Branch: awakening's branch itself;
[20834] <prose> Trunk: one taste in emptiness;
[20835] <prose> Leaf: pervading dharmadhatu;
[20836] <prose> Flower: wisdom's lamp itself; || 410 ||
[20837] <prose> Fruit: three kayas self-complete.
[20838] <prose> Sound: dharmatā-field's sound;
[20839] <prose> Smell: Buddha-speech's fame;
[20840] <prose> Taste: experience's bliss taste;
[20841] <prose> Touch: great concentration;
[20842] <prose> Music: five's complete mandala;
[20843] <prose> Canopy: clear color's potential;
[20844] <prose> Parasol: protecting wisdom;
[20845] <prose> Upper-canopy: instruction's great essential point;
[20846] <prose> Banner: manifest realization's Buddha; || 420 ||
[20847] <prose> All dharmas in mind-itself's face
[20848] <prose> Abide in primordial spontaneous completion's manner.
[20849] <prose> Therefore, mind and entity dharmas
[20850] <prose> Are all merely imputed.
[20851] <prose> Thus.
[20852] <prose> Second meaning: inner-arising extensive explanation—two:
[20853] <prose> Common divisions and
[20854] <prose> Individual divisions' nature.
[20855] <ornament> First:
[20856] <prose> Inner-arising: essence's five-arising inwardly rely upon body's five coarse arising; || 430 ||
[20857] <prose> Wind and
[20858] <prose> Fire and
[20859] <prose> Earth and
[20860] <prose> Water and
[20861] <prose> Space—five, each abiding as five, twenty-five limbs.
[20862] <prose> Thus, definite suitability: definite as five, depending on five different functions;
[20863] <prose> From the Self-Arisen:
[20864] <prose> The five great arising are complete in one's own body.
[20865] <prose> That also: five winds make wisdom-potential;
[20866] <prose> Five fires make wisdom-potency; || 440 ||
[20867] <prose> Five earths make wisdom-essence;
[20868] <prose> Five waters make wisdom-object;
[20869] <prose> Five spaces make wisdom-abode. Thus.
[20870] <prose> Second, five:
[20871] <prose> Wind and
[20872] <prose> Fire and
[20873] <prose> Earth and
[20874] <prose> Water and
[20875] <prose> Space nature extensive explanation.
[20876] <prose> First among these, from two: || 450 ||
[20877] <prose> Root division extensive explanation and
[20878] <prose> Branch division extensive explanation.
[20879] <prose> Root division:
[20880] <prose> From the Self-Arisen:
[20881] <prose> What are the five wind types?
[20882] <prose> Life-holding wind and
[20883] <prose> Color-radiance producing wind and
[20884] <prose> Fire-equal wind and
[20885] <prose> All-pervading wind and
[20886] <prose> Compassionless karma wind—five. || 460 ||
[20887] <prose> Those winds abide in all beings' bodies' head and tail. Thus.
[20888] <prose> That also: life-holding wind abides in life-channel;
[20889] <prose> Color-radiance producing abides in chest;
[20890] <prose> Fire-equal abides in navel;
[20891] <prose> All-pervading abides, pervading whole body;
[20892] <prose> Karma wind abides between heart and heart-membrane.
[20893] <prose> Their functions also:
[20894] <prose> Life-abiding and
[20895] <prose> Radiance-producing and
[20896] <prose> Food-digesting, || 470 ||
[20897] <prose> Going-sitting, and
[20898] <prose> Life-transference function performing—thus in sequence.
[20899] <prose> Second, branch division:
