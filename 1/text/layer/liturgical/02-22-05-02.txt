[32162] <list> The eighth: those of inferior grounds.
[32163] <list> Seeing and
[32164] <list> Reducing and
[32165] <list> Realizing accomplishment,
[32166] <list> The Śrāvaka grounds || 11740 ||
[32167] <list> The Pratyekabuddha grounds—the eight inferior grounds.
[32168] <list> The Pratyekabuddha grounds—the eight inferior grounds.
[32169] <list> Stream-enterer,
[32170] <list> Once-returner,
[32171] <list> Non-returner,
[32172] <list> And Arhat grounds—four in all.
[32173] <prose> After death, if in six days it trembles in the south, it is the Bodhisattva ground.
[32174] <list> Perfect Joy,
[32175] <list> Stainless,
[32176] <list> Luminous, || 11750 ||
[32177] <list> Radiant,
[32178] <list> Difficult to Cultivate,
[32179] <list> Manifestly Arrived,
[32180] <list> Gone Afar,
[32181] <list> Immovable,
[32182] <list> Excellent Wisdom,
[32183] <list> And Dharma Cloud—the ten causal grounds.
[32184] <break> <list> Universal Light, the resultant ground—eleven in all.
[32185] <break> <prose> After death, if in nine days it trembles from above with some sound, one obtains the Vidyādhara ground.
[32186] <list> Maturation ground, || 11760 ||
[32187] <list> Power over life ground,
[32188] <list> Great Seal ground,
[32189] <list> And spontaneous accomplishment ground—four in all.
[32190] <prose> Moreover, since these persons do not swiftly attain the result, having first obtained their respective grounds, they must dwell for long periods training to bring them to perfection—thus it is proclaimed:
[32191] <prose> Having first obtained the beginning of those respective grounds, one must dwell for long periods training until they are brought to complete perfection—thus it is proclaimed.
[32192] <prose> From the Blazing Relics Tantra:
[32193] <tantra> "When earth trembles at the time"
[32194] <tantra> "A being separates from breath,"
[32195] <list> The Śrāvaka grounds
[32196] <tantra> "Likewise, should it tremble in three days," || 11770 ||
[32197] <tantra> "The self-same ground gives rise to motion—"
[32198] <list> The Pratyekabuddha grounds—the eight inferior grounds.
[32199] <tantra> "When in six days it comes to be,"
[32200] <tantra> "This is the Bodhisattva ground,"
[32201] <tantra> "Entering therein, O Ḍākinī."
[32202] <tantra> "If in nine days it should come"
[32203] <tantra> "That earth does tremble and transform,"
[32204] <tantra> "This one has power to freely roam"
[32205] <tantra> "The ground of the Vidyādhara."
[32206] <tantra> "Yet to one endowed with trembling grounds" || 11780 ||
[32207] <tantra> "Buddhahood fruit does not appear;"
[32208] <tantra> "Thus in grounds and paths alike"
[32209] <tantra> "Long cultivation must one dwell."
[32210] <prose> So it is.
[32211] <prose> Moreover, those of scant learning nowadays, failing to understand that the vehicles entry-paths are distinct, apply all grounds of the causal vehicles path and stages only to the nature of causes.
[32212] <prose> Those of scant learning nowadays, taking only the characteristics of causes, compare all the grounds and paths to this.
[32213] <prose> This resembles calculating for all travelers the days required to reach Lhasa based only on the days needed by burden-bearers—yet not all can be indicated thus.
[32214] <prose> All cannot be indicated thus.
[32215] <prose> Just as horsemen, swift-footed ones, birds, and others cover in a few days what takes the heavily-burdened long periods, so too slower ones take more time—these are not certain.
[32216] <prose> Swift-footed ones, || 11790 ||
[32217] <prose> Birds and others, because they carry heavy burdens, complete the journey in but a few days—
[32218] <prose> Yet the slow require long periods, for the duration is not certain.
[32219] <prose> Likewise, the methods and wisdom-activities of each path should be understood by the wise and discerning.
[32220] <ornament> The second topic concerns the signs of birth-taking by the six realms confusion.
[32221] <prose> This has two aspects: the general arrangement and
[32222] <prose> the presentation of actual signs.
[32223] <ornament> First:
[32224] <prose> For all sentient beings there are
[32225] <prose> two paths to go,
[32226] <prose> two results—making four in all. || 11800 ||
[32227] <prose> Without the intermediate state of dharmatā and the intermediate state of existence, no path is possible.
[32228] <prose> Without the intermediate state of existence, no path is possible.
[32229] <prose> Without the two—the buddha-return and the being-return—there is no destination.
[32230] <prose> To proceed toward buddhahood, there are five paths:
[32231] <list> the path of accumulation,
[32232] <list> the path of application,
[32233] <list> the path of seeing,
[32234] <list> the path of meditation,
[32235] <list> and the path of completion.
[32236] <prose> The path of confusion leading to birth as a sentient being also has five continua: || 11810 ||
[32237] <list> the path of dreams,
[32238] <list> the path of latent tendencies,
[32239] <list> the path of the limits of karma,
[32240] <list> the path of the uncertain confusion-mandala,
[32241] <list> and the path where cause and result are each uncertain.
[32242] <prose> Regarding results, the distinctive buddha-fruits are twofold:
[32243] <list> Manifest,
[32244] <prose> The results of birth as a sentient being are six: hell,
[32245] <list> hungry ghost,
[32246] <list> animal, || 11820 ||
[32247] <list> human,
[32248] <list> god,
[32249] <list> and asura—beyond these, no destination exists.
[32250] <ornament> Second, regarding actual signs, from among six:
