[11736] <list> The eighth: those of inferior grounds.
[11737] <list> Seeing and
[11738] <list> Reducing and
[11739] <list> Realizing accomplishment,
[11740] <list> The Śrāvaka grounds || 11740 ||
[11741] <list> The Pratyekabuddha grounds—the eight inferior grounds.
[11742] <list> The Pratyekabuddha grounds—the eight inferior grounds.
[11743] <list> Stream-enterer,
[11744] <list> Once-returner,
[11745] <list> Non-returner,
[11746] <list> And Arhat grounds—four in all.
[11747] <prose> After death, if in six days it trembles in the south, it is the Bodhisattva ground.
[11748] <list> Perfect Joy,
[11749] <list> Stainless,
[11750] <list> Luminous, || 11750 ||
[11751] <list> Radiant,
[11752] <list> Difficult to Cultivate,
[11753] <list> Manifestly Arrived,
[11754] <list> Gone Afar,
[11755] <list> Immovable,
[11756] <list> Excellent Wisdom,
[11757] <list> And Dharma Cloud—the ten causal grounds.
[11758] <break> <list> Universal Light, the resultant ground—eleven in all.
[11759] <break> <prose> After death, if in nine days it trembles from above with some sound, one obtains the Vidyādhara ground.
[11760] <list> Maturation ground, || 11760 ||
[11761] <list> Power over life ground,
[11762] <list> Great Seal ground,
[11763] <list> And spontaneous accomplishment ground—four in all.
[11764] <prose> Moreover, since these persons do not swiftly attain the result, having first obtained their respective grounds, they must dwell for long periods training to bring them to perfection—thus it is proclaimed:
[11765] <prose> Having first obtained the beginning of those respective grounds, one must dwell for long periods training until they are brought to complete perfection—thus it is proclaimed.
[11766] <prose> From the Blazing Relics Tantra:
[11767] <tantra> "When earth trembles at the time"
[11768] <tantra> "A being separates from breath,"
[11769] <list> The Śrāvaka grounds
[11770] <tantra> "Likewise, should it tremble in three days," || 11770 ||
[11771] <tantra> "The self-same ground gives rise to motion—"
[11772] <list> The Pratyekabuddha grounds—the eight inferior grounds.
[11773] <tantra> "When in six days it comes to be,"
[11774] <tantra> "This is the Bodhisattva ground,"
[11775] <tantra> "Entering therein, O Ḍākinī."
[11776] <tantra> "If in nine days it should come"
[11777] <tantra> "That earth does tremble and transform,"
[11778] <tantra> "This one has power to freely roam"
[11779] <tantra> "The ground of the Vidyādhara."
[11780] <tantra> "Yet to one endowed with trembling grounds" || 11780 ||
[11781] <tantra> "Buddhahood fruit does not appear;"
[11782] <tantra> "Thus in grounds and paths alike"
[11783] <tantra> "Long cultivation must one dwell."
[11784] <prose> So it is.
[11785] <prose> Moreover, those of scant learning nowadays, failing to understand that the vehicles entry-paths are distinct, apply all grounds of the causal vehicles path and stages only to the nature of causes.
[11786] <prose> Those of scant learning nowadays, taking only the characteristics of causes, compare all the grounds and paths to this.
[11787] <prose> This resembles calculating for all travelers the days required to reach Lhasa based only on the days needed by burden-bearers—yet not all can be indicated thus.
[11788] <prose> All cannot be indicated thus.
[11789] <prose> Just as horsemen, swift-footed ones, birds, and others cover in a few days what takes the heavily-burdened long periods, so too slower ones take more time—these are not certain.
[11790] <prose> Swift-footed ones, || 11790 ||
[11791] <prose> Birds and others, because they carry heavy burdens, complete the journey in but a few days—
[11792] <prose> Yet the slow require long periods, for the duration is not certain.
[11793] <prose> Likewise, the methods and wisdom-activities of each path should be understood by the wise and discerning.
[11794] <ornament> The second topic concerns the signs of birth-taking by the six realms confusion.
[11795] <prose> This has two aspects: the general arrangement and
[11796] <prose> the presentation of actual signs.
[11797] <ornament> First:
[11798] <prose> For all sentient beings there are
[11799] <prose> two paths to go,
[11800] <prose> two results—making four in all. || 11800 ||
[11801] <prose> Without the intermediate state of dharmatā and the intermediate state of existence, no path is possible.
[11802] <prose> Without the intermediate state of existence, no path is possible.
[11803] <prose> Without the two—the buddha-return and the being-return—there is no destination.
[11804] <prose> To proceed toward buddhahood, there are five paths:
[11805] <list> the path of accumulation,
[11806] <list> the path of application,
[11807] <list> the path of seeing,
[11808] <list> the path of meditation,
[11809] <list> and the path of completion.
[11810] <prose> The path of confusion leading to birth as a sentient being also has five continua: || 11810 ||
[11811] <list> the path of dreams,
[11812] <list> the path of latent tendencies,
[11813] <list> the path of the limits of karma,
[11814] <list> the path of the uncertain confusion-mandala,
[11815] <list> and the path where cause and result are each uncertain.
[11816] <prose> Regarding results, the distinctive buddha-fruits are twofold:
[11817] <list> Manifest,
[11818] <prose> The results of birth as a sentient being are six: hell,
[11819] <list> hungry ghost,
[11820] <list> animal, || 11820 ||
[11821] <list> human,
[11822] <list> god,
[11823] <list> and asura—beyond these, no destination exists.
[11824] <ornament> Second, regarding actual signs, from among six:
