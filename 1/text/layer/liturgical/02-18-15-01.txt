[26072] <prose> Sitting with the body generally hunched closes the channel-mouth of consciousness entry.
[26073] <prose>
[26074] <prose>
[26075] <prose>
[26076] <prose> Stretching the body parts makes the body consciousness naturally slow. || 5650 ||
[26077] <prose> Joining knee and chest draws ability of wisdom from the body's elements.
[26078] <prose> Crossing the hands at armpit or atop the knee ends the limits of action and latency.
[26079] <prose> Second, the vital of resting wisdom:
[26080] <prose> If conceptuality emits and bliss does not arise, do thus:
[26081] <prose> Joining knee and chest, sitting hunched,
[26082] <prose> There is need to reverse the emitting action-wind.
[26083] <prose> Through that reversal, outer various bodies appear,
[26084] <prose> Mind abides inward.
[26085] <break> <prose> Pressing the foot-soles to the earth reverses life-effort action-wind.
[26086] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, heat arises in the outer body, || 5660 ||
[26087] <prose> Experience of unborn dharmatā arises inward.
[26088] <prose> Embracing and stretching the nape with the hands
[26089] <break> <prose> Reverses navel action-wind.
[26090] <prose> Through that reversal, many conceptualities cease inward,
[26091] <break> <prose> Increasing fully pure wisdom vision outward.
[26092] <prose> Such vitals are:
[26093] <prose> Body vital is ability,
[26094] <prose> Channel vital is to wind,
[26095] <prose> Wind vital is to mind.
[26096] <ornament> Regarding Sambhogakāya posture also: || 5670 ||
[26097] <prose> Sound explanation:
[26098] <verse> "Great elephant" expresses from the part of power and great vehicle, for that body vital lifts special wisdom.
[26099] <prose> Dividing meaning, from the two:
[26100] <prose> The vital of setting continuity:
[26101] <prose> Sleeping face-covered makes power to overcome the three existences.
[26102] <prose> Joining knee and chest makes ground for delusion to dawn as wisdom.
[26103] <prose> Extending the big toe outward to earth harms moving action-wind.
[26104] <prose> Pressing hand fingers to earth
[26105] <prose> Supports dharmatā manifestly dawning.
[26106] <prose> Raising the nape a little makes conceptuality dawn as wisdom. || 5680 ||
[26107] <prose> Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[26108] <prose> Face-covering overcomes the existence of attachment-holding of three doors.
[26109] <prose> Placing four hands and feet to earth,
[26110] <break> <prose> Pushing outward with the placed foot big-toe reverses conceptuality action-wind.
[26111] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, outer delusion vision ceases,
[26112] <prose> Heat arises in body and mind inward.
[26113] <break> <prose> Pressing both hand-palms to earth reverses moving action-wind.
[26114] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, outer bindus and small bindus dawn,
[26115] <prose> Experience without day and night arises inward.
[26116] <break> <prose> Bending the nape a little reverses grasping action-wind. || 5690 ||
[26117] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, seeing outer body-vision,
[26118] <prose> Exhausts wind's movement inward.
[26119] <ornament> Regarding Dharmakāya posture also:
[26120] <prose> Sound explanation:
[26121] <prose> Like one with complete lion's three abilities not fearing anything,
[26122] <prose> That body vital clears the fears of the three realms.
[26123] <ornament> Regarding dividing the manner of meaning:
[26124] <prose> The vital of establishing continuity:
[26125] <prose> Sitting in dog-curl makes expanse and awareness meet.
[26126] <break> <prose> Pressing foot-soles to earth ceases various conceptualities. || 5700 ||
[26127] <break> <prose> Consequently, bending all hand-finger joints and placing inside the two feet empties the movement of action and affliction.
[26128] <prose> Resting the upper body in a gap makes always not separate from dharmatā.
[26129] <prose> Carrying channels to the nape makes support without place to stick from dharmatā's meaning.
[26130] <prose> Second, to the vital of resting wisdom:
[26131] <prose> Placing both foot-soles to earth, pushing the knee a little outward, sitting in dog-curl
[26132] <break> <prose> Reverses pervading action-wind.
[26133] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[26134] <prose> The continuum of affliction ceases cut inward.
[26135] <break> <prose> Placing both hand-palms inward ceases grasping action-wind.
[26136] <break> <prose> Through that ceasing, seeing outer wisdom vision, || 5710 ||
[26137] <prose> The continuum of object-possessor grasping conceptuality ceases inward.
[26138] <prose> Resting the upper body in a gap and stretching the nape
[26139] <break> <prose> Reverses emitting action-wind.
[26140] <break> <prose> Through that reversal, seeing outer pure wisdom-part vision,
[26141] <prose> The continuum of affliction ceases inward.
[26142] <prose> Moreover, pressing the Dharmakāya posture completes Buddha-wisdom in this itself.
[26143] <prose> Through pressing Sambhogakāya, in this itself one sees the three realms of Buddha-fields.
[26144] <prose> Through pressing Nirmāṇakāya, in this itself there is need to accomplish unobstructed benefit for beings.
[26145] <prose> Second, the three unmoving of dawn-agent gaze manner:
[26146] <tantra> From the Mu tig phreng ba: || 5720 ||
[26147] <verse> "The door is that itself unmoving."
[26148] <prose> Looking as Nirmāṇakāya gaze manner, enjoying the vision of awareness-compassion.
[26149] <prose> That also: relying on relaxed eye, impossible to separate from samadhi.
[26150] <prose> Placing mind a little downward holds the view separate from emptiness-thought.
[26151] <prose> Looking equally, impossible to come under affliction's power.
[26152] <prose> Looking as Sambhogakāya gaze manner, manifestly seeing the vision of awareness-nature.
[26153] <prose> Without moving body, looking equally with both eyes to the right,
[26154] <prose> All delusion ceases in one time.
[26155] <break> <prose> Looking from the corner, impossible to separate from dharmatā.
[26156] <break> <prose> Looking to the left strikes the nail of expanse and awareness. || 5730 ||
[26157] <prose> Pressing that itself a little to the corner ceases the nadi's going and coming.
[26158] <prose> Looking as Dharmakāya gaze manner, seeing the essence of awareness.
[26159] <prose> Reversing both eyes equally upward a little cuts the continuum of birth-places of the three lower realms.
[26160] <prose> Pressing between the eyebrows—no place for awareness to wander.
[26161] <prose> Focusing upon the sky space—no place to separate from expanse-awareness.
[26162] <prose> Eye relaxation is the same for all.
[26163] <prose> Third, the three unmoving of bind-draw:
[26164] <prose> Binding body limbs ceases the continuum of the delusion-wheel of six realms.
[26165] <prose> Bending all finger joints destroys body action.
[26166] <prose> Pressing the nape channel on occasion makes basis for light vision to dawn in self-manner. || 5740 ||
[26167] <prose> Leaving body bind at fingers makes the three realms nameless.
[26168] <prose> Second, the three unmoving of speech:
[26169] <prose> Not mixing speech with anyone empties common action of six realms.
[26170] <prose>
[26171] <prose> Cutting the return-mixing of words, words dawn as self-arisen wisdom.
[26172] <prose> Blocking even merely one's own expression, certain abiding in the manner of all dharmas inexpressible.
[26173] <prose> Third, the three unmoving of mind:
[26174] <prose> Not separating from the inert of focus, always abiding in Buddha's intention.
[26175] <prose> Having entered awareness into the expanse-manner, no place to wander from entity-manner.
[26176] <prose> Not separating always from that itself, certain arrival of four visions at measure. || 5750 ||
[26177] <prose> That also is called "reversing from moving, moving, moving"—
[26178] <prose> The vital that frees from those.
[26179] <prose> Second, holding measure with three abidings has three parts:
[26180] <prose> Through three body abidings, separation from action;
[26181] <prose> Through three wind abidings, holding measure of non-arising;
[26182] <prose> Through three vision abidings, faith of non-returning.
[26183] <prose> First three:
[26184] <prose> Abiding not abiding in body action, impossible to increase saṃsāra's delusion.
[26185] <prose> Abiding limb emitting and gathering, delusion-wheel continuum ceases.
[26186] <prose> Placing action at the ground, certain separation from accumulated action-ripening. || 5760 ||
[26187] <prose> Second three:
[26188] <prose> Abiding wind not going outward, no harm from different condition-vision.
[26189] <prose> Abiding eye opening inward, no support for different conceptuality.
[26190] <prose> Abiding without outer-inner going and coming, empty ground of holding saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as two.
[26191] <prose> Third, three vision abidings:
[26192] <prose> Abiding without movement in light, recognition of not returning to three realms.
[26193] <prose> Abiding without movement in awareness, exhaustion of action and ripening end.
[26194] <prose> Abiding without shaking in body, body's contaminations naturally exhaust.
[26195] <prose> At this time, body four signs arriving at measure:
[26196] <prose> Arises through obtaining certainty at the ground of four powers. || 5770 ||
[26197] <prose> Speech four measures arriving:
[26198] <prose> Arises through obtaining certainty on the path of four powers.
[26199] <prose> Mind four measures arriving:
[26200] <prose> Arises through the four powers' result becoming manifest.
[26201] <prose> That also: at the time of dharmatā manifesting, the body like a tortoise put into a shell bowl,
[26202] <prose> Arises through the body's channels abiding relaxed.
[26203] <prose> That is the Great Perfection's meaning, free from action-effort, entering the body limbs.
[26204] <prose> Through the pure action of vase-empowerment,
[26205] <prose> Elaboration-together wisdom certainly arises self-arisen.
[26206] <prose> At the time of upper increase, the body going like a person tormented by sickness, arises through wind entering the central channel, || 5780 ||
[26207] <prose> The Great Perfection's meaning without negation-establishment entering the general.
[26208] <prose> Through the pure action of secret empowerment,
[26209] <prose> Elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[26210] <prose> At measure-arrival, the body like an elephant sinking in mud,
[26211] <prose> Arises through mind hitting channels and winds.
[26212] <prose> The Great Perfection's meaning without accepting-rejecting entering the heart.
[26213] <prose> Arising through body action purified by wisdom-yeshe empowerment,
[26214] <prose> Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[26215] <prose> At exhaustion, the body going like dew on a dakini's ear,
[26216] <prose> Arises through mind entering the luminosity-net. || 5790 ||
[26217] <prose> The Great Perfection's self-free equal meaning entering the body-eye, through word-empowerment body action purified,
[26218] <prose> Very elaboration-free wisdom arises self-arisen.
[26219] <prose> Those are shown nearby by examples—
[26220] <prose> The signs of body's delusions naturally ceasing in meaning.
[26221] <prose> The sign-measure letters are intended for the general manner of meaning;
[26222] <prose> Vimal said these are placed very upon meaning.
[26223] <prose> Speech ground also like the four visions and sequence:
[26224] <prose> Speech going like a mute manner, arises through consciousness entering inner channels.
[26225] <prose> This is the Great Perfection's expressive ground, self-pure, entering speech-symbols,
[26226] <prose> Cutting elaboration outward, clear in the manner of inner wisdom. || 5800 ||
[26227] <prose> Speech going like a crazy person's self-words bursting forth:
[26228] <prose> Arises through purifying the self-essence of Great Perfection expressive words.
[26229] <prose> Through entering the resonance of pure certain freedom of Great Perfection expressive words,
[26230] <prose> Cutting elaboration-free meaning inward.
[26231] <prose> Speech going like an earthen jar child emerging from a rock gap,
[26232] <prose> Arises through compassion gathering into wisdom-yeshe power.
[26233] <prose> Through entering the transformation of speech with meaning exceeding Great Perfection's speak-think,
[26234] <prose> Cutting the end of holding words as very elaboration-free.
[26235] <prose> Speech arising like the manner of split rock,
[26236] <prose> Arises through letters abiding in channels entering wind bindus. || 5810 ||
[26237] <prose> Through entering the sound of speech with inexpressible Great Perfection meaning,
[26238] <prose> Arises through leaving, exceeding the object of speech, very elaboration-free.
[26239] <prose> Expression arises as inexpressible meaning to example.
[26240] <prose> Mind's four signs also, to be known through the four visions and sequence:
[26241] <prose> Mind going like caught on a dakini's ear,
[26242] <prose> Arises through mixing awareness with luminosity.
[26243] <prose> Great perfection hold-free self-free, entering mind's vision,
[26244] <prose> Arises through completing elaboration-together empowerment.
[26245] <prose> Mind going like a person hit by poison thorns,
[26246] <prose> Arises through freeing into the expanse of unborn mind. || 5820 ||
[26247] <prose> Great perfection unborn self-place free, entering mind's arising place,
[26248] <prose> Through completing empowerment of primordially non-existent elaboration.
[26249] <prose> Mind going without return ground like a person recovered from fever,
[26250] <prose> Arises through catching fully pure mind wind.
[26251] <prose> Great perfection primordially free without return ground, entering mind's abiding place,
[26252] <prose> Through very elaboration-free self-vision self-freeing.
[26253] <prose> Mind going like dying immediately after an arrow hits a person's heart,
[26254] <prose> Arises through habituation becoming special.
[26255] <prose> Great perfection momentary quick-doing measure, entering mind's life:
[26256] <prose> Power of all very elaboration near-ceasing and non-existing. || 5830 ||
[26257] <prose> This also is faith through example, cutting meaning's connection.
[26258] <prose> Moreover, body's ground, arising as the doer of freeing the binding of four elements—
[26259] <prose> Now the vital point: impossible for elements to return to self-continuum.
[26260] <prose> Speech four: express ground,
[26261] <prose> Express condition,
[26262] <prose> Express object,
[26263] <prose> Express agent—free from the binding of four,
[26264] <prose> Now impossible to speak words in self-continuum.
[26265] <prose> Mind four:
[26266] <prose> Memory, || 5840 ||
[26267] <prose> No memory,
[26268] <prose> Non-arising,
[26269] <prose> Mind-exceeding—free from the binding of four,
[26270] <prose> Now impossible to enter the wheel of memory-thought object.
[26271] <prose> Thus, signs dawning in body,
[26272] <prose> Known in essence-speech,
[26273] <prose> Confidence correcting mind,
[26274] <prose> Measure caught by dream,
[26275] <prose> Through diligence sequence:
[26276] <prose> Great: completely ceasing dreams, || 5850 ||
[26277] <prose> Arising through great habituation, no benefit or harm by action and latency.
[26278] <prose> Middle: arising through certain habituation of knowing dream as dream,
[26279] <prose> No conceptuality of good or bad latency.
[26280] <prose> Low: becoming well-abiding in dream through single taste of pure latency, need to avoid cause-effect action of abandoning antidotes.
[26281] <prose> Thus the three abidings:
[26282] <tantra> From the Mu tig phreng:
[26283] <prose> Abiding is the pure expanse,
[26284] <prose> Thus abiding is awareness essence,
[26285] <prose> Abiding are all visions.
[26286] <prose> Third, striking nails with three obtains: || 5860 ||
[26287] <prose> Through obtaining power over outer vision, freeing vision-conditions into field-realms.
[26288] <prose> Through obtaining power over inner illusory body, freeing dust together into luminosity.
[26289] <prose> Through obtaining power over secret awareness, exhausting wind-mind delusion—
[26290] <prose> Called "near to obtaining power over the meaningful result."
[26291] <prose> Again from that itself:
[26292] <prose> Through awareness dawning, cause-conditions cease;
[26293] <prose> Through luminosity dawning, subtle-coarse cease;
[26294] <prose> Through expanse-awareness dawning, object-mind cease.
[26295] <prose> Fourth, holding measure of freedom through four confidences:
[26296] <prose> Confidence without fear or dread, although seeing or hearing the suffering of hot and cold hells; || 5870 ||
[26297] <prose>
[26298] <prose>
[26299] <prose> Confidence of spontaneous three-kaya completion, without hope or excitement of obtaining, although hearing Buddha qualities;
[26300] <prose> Confidence of repeating cause-result, without fear of falling into saṃsāra of delusion-vision, although hearing cause-result of action and affliction;
[26301] <prose> Four confidences arise: confidence of obtaining the certain ground of primordially-pure self-completion, without joy of hope for freedom, although seeing nirvāṇa's self-place.
[26302] <tantra> From the Rinpoche spungs pa tantra:
[26303] <prose> Through four great confidences of unchanging view,
[26304] <prose> Also holding the measure of non-returning wisdom.
[26305] <prose> Thus, in addition to the four extreme reliances:
[26306] <prose> Concluding gathering through sixteen visions: || 5880 ||
[26307] <prose> Vision,
[26308] <prose> Increase,
[26309] <prose> Obtain,
[26310] <prose> Near obtain—four sets, each entering the four visions,
[26311] <prose> Completing the sixteen-ground vision:
[26312] <prose> dharmatā manifest vision: increase is eye;
[26313] <break> <prose> Near increase: eye's that itself;
[26314] <break> <prose> Obtain: seeing nadi;
[26315] <prose> Near obtain: obtaining habituation to that.
[26316] <prose> Experience increase vision: increase is light; || 5890 ||
[26317] <prose> Near increase: bindu;
[26318] <prose> Obtain: bindu clear as five colors;
[26319] <prose> Near obtain: various rays emitting from moving and shifting.
[26320] <prose> Measure-arrive vision: increase is body;
[26321] <prose> Near increase: vision as father-mother;
[26322] <prose> Obtain: possessing five and five heaps;
[26323] <prose> Near obtain: mandala complete.
[26324] <prose> Exhaust vision: increase not abiding in body and wisdom;
[26325] <prose> Near increase: empty without focus;
[26326] <prose> Obtain: inexpressible; || 5900 ||
[26327] <prose> Near obtain: dharmatā not established anywhere, like non-existence—sixteen.
[26328] <prose> Thus, a person certain in sixteen visions, having obtained the time of ripening self-continuum into wisdom,
[26329] <prose> Is called "certain in sixteen visions by protector Vajradhara."
[26330] <prose> Thus, the sixteen sequences designated at the ground of cause and result, complete here in freeing as light-body and
[26331] <break> <prose> Freeing in the bardo.
[26332] <break> <prose>
[26333] <tantra> From the Rig pa rang shar:
[26334] <verse> "Ground" does not exist separately elsewhere.
[26335] <prose> In one person seeing truth, all grounds are complete.
[26336] <prose> That also: that person to whom introduction is shown— || 5910 ||
