[34704] <ornament> First:
[34705] <prose> Although natural expression appears as light,
[34706] <break> <prose> Recognizing that one's own face is awareness-resonance inseparable from the single expanse, the primordially pure clarity-emptiness crystal-clear nature—this decisive cutting is introduction to the ultimate liberation ground, directly revealing naked View. || 14280 ||
[34707] <break> <ornament> Second:
[34708] <prose> Within that very nature, without deliberate placement or abandonment, decisively cutting through natural meditative stability, neither distracted nor grasping—this is meditation.
[34709] <ornament> Third:
[34710] <prose> At that time, awareness naturally lucent, beyond meditation object and meditator, liberated as it arises, having confidence in self-liberation without rejecting good or bad conceptual constructs, to be repeated—
[34711] <prose> the first crucial point of vital importance is thus.
[34712] <prose> Although the natural realm appears variously, beyond mere appearance,
[34713] <prose> Gathering self-lucid naked pristine cognition into unified vastness, reciting it as self-lucid self-arisen pristine cognition and meditating thus,
[34714] <prose> even grasping at that is liberated.
[34715] <prose> Furthermore, there is nothing else:
[34716] <prose> This is the quintessential instruction for liberating light-appearance into Dharma-nature, || 14290 ||
[34717] <prose> Introducing the nature of awareness instantly naked, outwardly looking yet inwardly lucid—
[34718] <prose> Looking at appearances, they are infinite, — yet.
[34719] <prose> Looking at awareness, not even one exists, naturally lucent self-arisen;
[34720] <break> <prose> the pith instruction of striking liberation ground directly.
[34721] <break> <prose> The second crucial point of vital importance is thus.
[34722] <ornament> Regarding compassion's vital point:
[34723] <prose> When awareness as means to guide manifold outward disciples radiates in various forms inwardly,
[34724] <prose> Do not cut the trail of outward radiation;
[34725] <break> <prose> Do not examine your own face;
[34726] <break> <prose> Without inward rejection, leave whatever arises resting just there; || 14300 ||
[34727] <prose> By recognizing that uninterrupted knowing nakedly naturally lucent,
[34728] <prose> Liberation ground is directly revealed;
[34729] <prose> Wherein, by recognizing this very instantaneous naturally resolved awareness, continuously naked without transition, together with bardo consciousness manifesting unceasingly,
[34730] <prose> Primordially pure compassionate awareness is recognized and liberated—
[34731] <prose> the third crucial point of vital importance is thus.
[34732] <prose> These three are secret heart-nectar, supremely refined essence, utterly secret,
[34733] <prose> Greatly decisive in oral transmission,
[34734] <tantra> Greatly binding in Sutra and Tantra,
[34735] <prose> Vitally important in profound crucial points,
[34736] <break> <prose> The quintessential instruction of heart-sons supreme, sealing secrecy from others. || 14310 ||
[34737] <break> <tantra> This is self-attained from the Vajra Realm of the Tantra;
[34738] <break> <prose> Although self-realizing many such points, explaining to others they will not understand;
[34739] <break> <prose> Showing, they will not realize;
[34740] <prose> Returning and dissolving into oneself, like rivers flowing into the ocean then dissolving therein.
[34741] <prose> Aligning the three vital points with scripture:
[34742] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[34743] <prose> Furthermore, the entity of Dharma-nature,
[34744] <break> <prose> Established as entity from self-nature itself,
[34745] <break> <prose> Since manner of appearance is uncertainly one,
[34746] <prose> Paths of entry are also different. || 14320 ||
[34747] <prose> Through face, knowing, and liberation sight,
[34748] <prose> Entry, seeing, and familiarity,
[34749] <prose> Knowing the face is one's own face;
[34750] <prose> Confidence is the heart ground.
[34751] <prose> Decisive cutting enters into confidence;
[34752] <prose> Thus through these three, the certain deed:
[34753] <prose> Entity complete, cause ceases.
[34754] <prose> Furthermore, explaining Dharma-nature's nature:
[34755] <prose> Here, since not one but uncertain,
[34756] <prose> However imputed, thus appearing; || 14330 ||
[34757] <tantra> From various naming bases,
[34758] <prose> Words and terms manifoldly proliferate;
[34759] <tantra> From uncertain various names,
[34760] <prose> Meanings too are empty of mere imputation;
[34761] <prose> Since emptiness is nowhere established,
[34762] <prose> Naturally pure thus appears.
[34763] <prose> Furthermore, explaining Dharma-nature compassion:
[34764] <prose> Since disciples' objects are manifold,
[34765] <prose> Guiding Bodies are also just so;
[34766] <tantra> From dispositions and faculties' displays, || 14340 ||
[34767] <prose> saṃsāra and nirvāṇa cognitions differ;
[34768] <prose> When that itself is placed as respective objects,
[34769] <prose> The uncorrected meaning-intention.
[34770] <prose> Thus it is.
[34771] <prose> Second, fixing attention through crucial points of the three times:
[34772] <tantra> From the two—the realm of three times and the pith instruction of method—
[34773] <ornament> Regarding crucial points there are three:
[34774] <prose> The crucial point of knowing entry,
[34775] <prose> The crucial point of one's own face liberation,
[34776] <prose> The crucial point of recognizing face completion. || 14350 ||
[34777] <ornament> First:
[34778] <prose> When awareness enters outward into luminosity-appearance, knowing resonance as self-appearance; and.
[34779] <prose> When light-appearance enters inward into awareness, knowing that nature inseparable from primordially pure ground, unmoving.
[34780] <ornament> Second:
[34781] <prose> At the time of applying the four pristine cognitions, knowing the crucial instruction of recognizing one's own face through liberation of outer, inner, and secret abiding in one's own face,
[34782] <break> <prose> Also, aggregates' self-grasping cleared, body liberated into luminosity, abiding in Dharma-nature own face,
[34783] <break> <prose> Liberated from elements' coarse subtle solidity,
[34784] <prose> Appearance abides in luminosity, great bliss,
[34785] <prose> Awareness, liberated from afflictions coarse subtle, dissolves into mother abiding.
[34786] <prose> Also, outer delusion purified, awareness meets Dharma-nature mother and knows, conditions manifoldly appearing as objects, things coarse subtle liberated, mother-child non-dual liberation. || 14360 ||
[34787] <prose> How is liberation?
[34788] <prose> Earth element's characteristic self-purified, body freed from flesh-bondage;
[34789] <break> <prose> Water purified, blood;
[34790] <break> <prose> Fire purified, warmth;
[34791] <prose> Wind purified, freed from breath-bondage—
[34792] <prose> Without conceptual horse,
[34793] <prose> Flesh and blood self-continuum grasping liberated;
[34794] <prose> Inner awareness without affliction stain, five pristine cognitions self-appear;
[34795] <prose> Without knowable stain, phenomena and Dharma-nature non-dual,
[34796] <prose> Knowing one's own face thus abiding, || 14370 ||
[34797] <prose> Now awareness cannot produce afflictions,
[34798] <prose> Liberated from saṃsāra karmic ripening;
[34799] <prose> Since afflictions cannot abide in awareness own face,
[34800] <prose> Secret awareness Dharma-nature, neither existent nor non-existent, neither eternal nor nihilistic, thing nor emptiness—falling into neither extreme,
[34801] <prose> Outer phenomena object and subject,
[34802] <prose> Inner phenomena variously grasping conceptual discrimination,
[34803] <prose> Secret phenomena awareness itself—without even slightest grasping, knowing one's own face.
[34804] <prose> Third, the crucial point of recognizing face completion:
[34805] <prose> Bodhicitta cannot actually descend.
[34806] <prose> Awareness arriving at the spontaneous precious jewel's own object, abiding inseparable from primordial purity and spontaneous presence, recognizing that, || 14380 ||
[34807] <prose> All samsaric phenomena purified at that time, decisively cutting prior delusion never experienced,
[34808] <prose> Now obtaining the Body of no-return delusion impossible, awareness itself without turning back,
[34809] <prose> saṃsāra's delusory appearance,
[34810] <prose> nirvāṇa's pure appearance dissolving into Expanse, when neither existence nor non-existence, eternal nor nihilistic established anywhere, alternating saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, ground liberation attained—at the time of spontaneous dissolution, recognize.
[34811] <prose> This is awareness own face's vital importance.
[34812] <ornament> Second, regarding method's pith instruction, from two:
[34813] <prose> The previous pith instruction's crucial points familiarized and introduced in this life, recognizing outwardly inwardly as previously known, at that time liberated without doubt;
[34814] <break> <prose> Hence, this time's pith instruction: sharp awareness transcending ground from the start, like a shooting star racing through space, recognizing own face instantly and liberated;
[34815] <break> <prose> Dull awareness not recognizing various appearances' distinctions, through the power of previously practiced profundity,
[34816] <prose> Lion-cub freed from womb-enclosure, purifying solidity, liberated in whichever of twenty-one faculties' five or more instants. || 14390 ||
[34817] <prose> These from Sun Moon Union:
[34818] <prose> This time has three:
[34819] <prose> Time of entry,
[34820] <prose> Time of liberation,
[34821] <prose> Time of completion.
[34822] <prose> Time of entry has two:
[34823] <break> <prose> Awareness entering outward into light,
[34824] <break> <prose> Light entering inward into awareness.
[34825] <prose> Liberation has three:
[34826] <prose> Awareness freed from elements through separation from conditions; || 14400 ||
[34827] <prose> Awareness without stain,
[34828] <prose> Liberated from afflictions;
[34829] <prose> Awareness itself not falling into any extreme, liberated from outer and inner phenomena.
[34830] <prose> Completion is shown as awareness itself, all phenomena's appearance, liberated simultaneously.
[34831] <prose> Methods are two:
[34832] <prose> Previous pith instruction's crucial point,
[34833] <prose> This time's sharp and dull awareness distinction, thus.
[34834] <prose> Third, gathering meaning through self-appearance faculties' liberation mode, threefold:
[34835] <prose> Faculties' divisions generally shown,
[34836] <prose> Liberation-delusion stages specifically explained, || 14410 ||
[34837] <prose> Individual faculties' liberation mode extensively spoken.
[34838] <ornament> First: Faculties sharp, dull, medium, combined lowest,
[34839] <prose> medium,
[34840] <prose> excellent,
[34841] <prose> peak,
[34842] <prose> supreme,
[34843] <prose> utmost,
[34844] <prose> complete—seven each, making twenty-one,
[34845] <prose> Each pristine cognition appearance mode,
[34846] <prose> Each delusion ground of aspect, || 14420 ||
[34847] <prose> Each realization measure,
[34848] <prose> Each knowledge examination mode,
[34849] <prose> Each self-appearance liberation mode—separately arising,
[34850] <prose> Thus faculties explained as twenty-one,
[34851] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[34852] <break> <verse> Listen, devoted assembly!
[34853] <break> <verse> To dispel sentient beings' ignorance,
[34854] <verse> Since twenty-one appearance modes exist,
[34855] <break> <verse> These I teach—attend with care.
[34856] <break> <prose> Faculties shown through three aspects: || 14430 ||
[34857] <list> Excellent,
[34858] <list> Medium,
[34859] <list> Excellent has seven:
[34860] <list> Excellent lowest,
[34861] <list> Excellent medium,
[34862] <list> Excellent excellent,
[34863] <list> Excellent supreme,
[34864] <list> Excellent utmost,
[34865] <list> Excellent peak,
[34866] <list> Excellent complete. || 14440 ||
[34867] <prose> These are excellent's divisions.
[34868] <prose> These too have view-reversal each,
[34869] <prose> Pristine cognition appearance arising mode each,
[34870] <prose> Realization measure each,
[34871] <prose> Understanding time each,
[34872] <prose> Knowledge examination mode each arising, stability obtained in respective appearance.
[34873] <prose> Medium also has seven:
[34874] <list> Medium lowest,
[34875] <list> Medium medium,
[34876] <list> Medium excellent, || 14450 ||
[34877] <list> Medium supreme,
[34878] <list> Medium utmost,
[34879] <list> Medium peak,
[34880] <list> Medium complete;
[34881] <prose> Each also pristine cognition arising measure arises.
[34882] <prose> These are medium's.
[34883] <prose> Lowest also seven:
[34884] <list> Lowest lowest,
[34885] <list> Lowest medium,
[34886] <list> Lowest excellent, || 14460 ||
[34887] <list> Lowest supreme,
[34888] <list> Lowest utmost,
[34889] <list> Lowest peak,
[34890] <list> Lowest complete, thus.
[34891] <prose> Second, specifically explaining liberation-delusion stages:
[34892] <tantra> From Sun Moon Union:
[34893] <prose> Some obtain stability distinctly in the twenty-one faculties;
[34894] <prose> Therefore, those not comprehending their own knowledge, again without guru's oral transmission, become bewildered at that appearance,
[34895] <prose> Astonished,
[34896] <prose> Frightened, || 14470 ||
[34897] <prose> Terrified,
[34898] <prose> Losing recognition, and so forth—
[34899] <prose> Again grasping saṃsāra's near appropriation,
[34900] <prose> Also twenty-one faculties distinctly deluded exist.
[34901] <prose> Thus the three faculties:
[34902] <prose> Excellent liberate in three instants;
[34903] <prose> Medium may obtain stability in five days;
[34904] <prose> Twenty-one instants obtain stability.
[34905] <prose> Lowest, expiring into natural Emanation-Body pure land, without bardo attain buddhahood, thus.
[34906] <break> <prose> Here three: || 14480 ||
[34907] <break> <list> Twenty-one faculties delusion mode,
[34908] <list> Liberation mode,
[34909] <list> Dispelling delusion regarding distinction mode.
[34910] <ornament> First:
[34911] <prose> Those not seeing this teaching's door through previous guru's great secret certain oral transmission, and.
[34912] <prose> Those seen yet lacking confidence,
[34913] <prose> Laziness,
[34914] <prose> Distracted—lowest of lowest faculties, not obtaining power over Dharma-nature bardo self-appearance, greatly bewildered,
[34915] <prose> Not finding certainty, greatly appearing,
[34916] <verse> "From what ancestry did this arise?" thinking, || 14490 ||
[34917] <break> <prose> Face not meeting, innermost frightened, thinking,
[34918] <break> <prose> Not previously practicing even an instant directly, "What is this appearance? Is it faculty delusion?" recognition perversely arising, and so forth—
[34919] <prose> Not recognizing self-appearance, again grasping saṃsāra's near appropriation existence-bardo,
[34920] <prose> Twenty-one faculties delusion exist.
[34921] <prose> How deluded?
[34922] <prose> When seeing great appearance,
[34923] <prose> Lowest lowest, outwardly grasping all as object-aspect, deluded;
[34924] <prose> Lowest medium, attachment's fault deluded;
[34925] <prose> Lowest excellent, self-grasping immediately as condition, deluded;
[34926] <prose> Lowest supreme, grasping self-characteristic as mark, deluded; || 14500 ||
[34927] <prose> Lowest utmost, not knowing anywhere, deluded by bewildered ignorance;
[34928] <prose> Lowest peak, "What is this?" thinking, doubt entering, deluded;
[34929] <prose> Lowest complete, grasping that itself as object's portion self, deluded;
[34930] <prose> Medium lowest, seeing lucidity as empty of thing, deluded;
[34931] <prose> Medium medium, grasping thing attachment-grasping as heart essence, deluded;
[34932] <prose> Medium excellent, distracted in object, not knowing anywhere, deluded by child-seeing-appearance ignorance;
[34933] <prose> Medium supreme, making knowledge grasping condition, deluded;
[34934] <prose> Medium utmost, examined as grasped object, deluded;
[34935] <prose> Medium peak, grasping "Such appearance arose to me" as hope-fear, deluded;
[34936] <prose> Medium complete, placing in certainty, not knowing self-appearance, deluded; || 14510 ||
[34937] <prose> Excellent lowest, grasping as beautiful, deluded;
[34938] <prose> Excellent medium, grasping attachment to beauty, deluded;
[34939] <prose> Excellent excellent, not grasping anywhere yet distracted, without recognition, deluded;
[34940] <prose> Excellent supreme, appearance's object making cause-self one grasping, deluded;
[34941] <prose> Excellent utmost, not knowing instantaneous change aspect, deluded;
[34942] <prose> Excellent peak, grasping signs and marks as formed, deluded;
[34943] <prose> Excellent complete, not knowing anywhere, deluded by appearance force or bewilderment.
[34944] <prose> All delusion modes, twenty-one included here,
[34945] <prose> Not deluding in bardo is extremely precious.
[34946] <ornament> Also regarding this, now outer ordinary appearance and. || 14520 ||
[34947] <prose> Luminosity portion self-appearance, instant by instant nakedly each recognizing—extremely precious.
[34948] <prose> Also from Self-Arisen:
[34949] <break> <verse> Listen, nearby assembly!
[34950] <break> <verse> Sentient beings in bardo delude thus:
[34951] <verse> Some delude from aspect,
[34952] <verse> Some delude from experience,
[34953] <verse> Some delude from immediacy,
[34954] <verse> Some delude from fixation,
[34955] <break> <verse> Some delude from "what is this?" thinking,
[34956] <break> <verse> Some delude from thought-construct, || 14530 ||
[34957] <verse> Some delude from object; some delude from no-object;
[34958] <verse> Some delude from heart essence,
[34959] <verse> Some delude from ignorance,
[34960] <verse> Some delude from conditions,
[34961] <verse> Some delude from examination,
[34962] <verse> Some delude from self,
[34963] <verse> Some delude from not recognizing face,
[34964] <verse> Some delude from grasping,
[34965] <verse> Some delude from no-grasping,
[34966] <verse> Some delude from recognition, || 14540 ||
[34967] <verse> Some delude from cause,
[34968] <verse> Some delude from instant,
[34969] <verse> Some delude from signs,
[34970] <verse> Some delude from force.
[34971] <prose> Since bardo sentient beings' minds are twenty-one,
[34972] <prose> One delusion mode completes appearance,
[34973] <prose> Thus for each delusion mode, appearance arises;
[34974] <prose> Thus extensively shown, bardo delusion modes, thus.
[34975] <prose> Second, liberation mode does not transcend twenty-one faculty stages,
[34976] <prose> Not transcending excellent, medium, lowest three. || 14550 ||
[34977] <prose> Here excellent three instants,
[34978] <prose> Medium five,
[34979] <prose> Lowest seven to twenty-one liberated.
[34980] <prose> Their lowest cannot liberate from birth in natural Emanation pure land.
[34981] <prose> Excellent complete liberates in primordial purity in three instants.
[34982] <tantra> From Blazing Relic Body:
[34983] <verse> Shooting stars through space,
[34984] <verse> Racing mode, three instants,
[34985] <verse> Even with Emanation itself,
[34986] <verse> Into own-entity self-dissolved. || 14560 ||
[34987] <prose> Thus.
[34988] <prose> Excellent remaining six actions complete in three instants, complete.
[34989] <prose> Faculty distinction: instant duration long-short exists,
[34990] <prose> Some take from one to six days of meditative stability.
[34991] <prose> Completion does not depend on days from three liberation instants.
[34992] <prose> This arises from realization's potency.
[34993] <prose> Liberation instant: when knowledge arises at appearance, abiding there, object-known duration counted as one instant, three instants liberated.
[34994] <prose> Medium and.
[34995] <prose> Lowest instants longer than that,
[34996] <prose> Calculating action-complete instant, now explained. || 14570 ||
[34997] <prose> Third, dispelling delusion regarding distinction:
[34998] <prose> Delusion and.
[34999] <prose> Its dispelling, from two:
[35000] <ornament> Delusion regarding portion: many tantras and pith instructions, some three instants,
[35001] <list> Five,
[35002] <list> Some three days,
[35003] <list> Twenty-one and so forth explained, not distinguishing meditative stability days and
[35004] <prose> Liberation instants, grasping two as one, explained.
[35005] <prose> Dispelling from two:
[35006] <prose> Reasoning: || 14580 ||
[35007] <prose> If those two were one, excellent peak subject would be liberated in one instant,
[35008] <prose> Because liberated in one day of meditative stability;
[35009] <prose> If accepting, excellent three instants liberated is clear.
[35010] <prose> Likewise excellent lowest would be liberated in six instants,
[35011] <prose> Because liberated in six days.
[35012] <prose> If accepting, excellent whichever, three instants liberated is clear.
[35013] <prose> Also liberating in interval passage time's primordial purity, — yet three instants certain,
