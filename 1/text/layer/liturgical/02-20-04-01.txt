[29398] <prose> At first, when losing, the two awarenesses of the time of delusion have no good-bad distinction.
[29399] <prose> Awareness not meditated and
[29400] <prose> At the time of meditating, without distinction,
[29401] <prose> At the time of wandering and
[29402] <prose> At the time of passing, awareness has no good-bad.
[29403] <prose> At the time of going to sleep and
[29404] <prose> At the time of waking and
[29405] <prose> At the time of coming and going, awareness has no good-bad distinction—it is like this.
[29406] <prose> However, there is only dream joy and suffering of good-bad appearance manner. || 8980 ||
[29407] <prose> Depending on that, one meditates the path.
[29408] <prose> It is not that the essence goes to the good—
[29409] <prose> For awareness has no transfer or change.
[29410] <prose> Thus also, from the Self-Arisen:
[29411] <tantra> Emaho!
[29412] <tantra> This precious jewel nectar,
[29413] <tantra> At the time of beginningless time,
[29414] <tantra> I lost the precious jewel.
[29415] <tantra> At that time, wandering wrongly in suffering.
[29416] <tantra> That precious jewel nectar, || 8990 ||
[29417] <tantra> Has no place to be found by searching.
[29418] <tantra> Self-arisen from self, realized by self.
[29419] <tantra> That precious jewel nectar,
[29420] <tantra> Not feeling loss, feeling finding.
[29421] <tantra> By losing, things are without characteristics.
[29422] <tantra> Possessing the glow of joy by finding.
[29423] <tantra> The time of finding and the time of losing,
[29424] <tantra> Realized in one state without distinction.
[29425] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29426] <prose> Moreover, that losing in the state of self-awareness, though finding from the state of self, || 9000 ||
[29427] <prose> From self-awareness's one wheel,
[29428] <prose> Does not enter elsewhere.
[29429] <prose> Losing the jewel in the king's treasury, doing suffering by the jewel's absence.
[29430] <prose> Though joy and bliss expand by finding from the treasury, both do not move from one treasury—it is like this.
[29431] <prose> saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, the two appearing from the state of awareness, are also like this.
[29432] <prose> This is the secret word of determining the self-essential-point of supreme wish-fulfillment, realizing the vast expanse of dharmatā.
[29433] <list> Second: demonstrating lamp-experience from that has three aspects:
[29434] <list> Preliminary characteristics of place,
[29435] <list> Actual lamp-pressing method,
[29436] <list> From that, the manner of appearance-arising. || 9010 ||
[29437] <list> First:
[29438] <prose> Abandoning all actions of this life,
[29439] <prose> Making the holy Lama pleased,
[29440] <prose> Sitting with the three immovables in a room decorated by darkness in a very secluded place,
[29441] <prose> Perfecting Lama yoga, meditating, placing requests from the heart.
[29442] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[29443] <tantra> Lamp-pressing is thus:
[29444] <tantra> By the faithful one, mind free from saṃsāra,
[29445] <tantra> Do Lama offering and giving,
[29446] <tantra> Abandoning all samsaric connections, || 9020 ||
[29447] <tantra> In a secluded direction or charnel ground,
[29448] <tantra> One must abide alone, abandoning companions.
[29449] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29450] <list> Second:
[29451] <prose> Placing on AH, and
[29452] <prose> Entering clearly—two:
