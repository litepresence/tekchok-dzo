[31953] <prose> Depth clear five lights exist, sun show time very shining, clear.
[31954] <tantra> From Blazing Relics:
[31955] <prose> Alas listen dakini,
[31956] <prose> Ringsel called white luster, || 11530 ||
[31957] <prose> Oily gathered, color clear,

[31967] <prose> Arise, dakini.
[31968] <prose> Ringsel color yellow,
[31969] <prose> Equal poppy seed, from blood,
[31970] <tantra> From that liver top arises.
[31971] <prose> Ringsel red luster,
[31972] <prose> Measure big-small equal poppy seed,
[31973] <prose> This gathered elements gathered,

[31980] <prose> All these round gathered shape,
[31981] <prose> All depth clear five colors.
[31982] <prose> Peaceful relics liberate to race ground of certain own-appearance,
[31983] <prose> Wrathful relics—
[31984] <prose> Dharma-kaya,
[31985] <prose> Sambhogakāya,
[31986] <prose> Nirmāṇakāya, || 11560 ||
[31987] <prose> Evident-awakening meaningful kaya,
[31988] <prose> Obtain unchangeable vajra kaya.
[31989] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[31990] <prose> Ringsel obtains unborn,
[31991] <prose> Ringsel meaningful,
[31992] <prose> Ringsel obtains Sambhogakāya,
[31993] <prose> Ringsel obtains Nirmāṇakāya,
[31994] <prose> Ringsel vajra.
[31995] <prose> Third, concluding meaning by distinction of relics and ringsels:
[31996] <prose> Ringsel called like relics, || 11570 ||
[31997] <prose> Round shape, whatever five color dwells.
[31998] <prose> Ringsel cause pure white red, flesh bone heat breath pure gathered arise,
[31999] <prose>
[32000] <prose>
[32001] <prose> Relics arise from very pure of pure.
[32002] <prose> Produce place and arise place—arise from between body joints and flesh skin, produce; ripen place—because exist in all bone and flesh and skin, thus from all those arise.
[32003] <prose> That flesh and skin and bone from arise, and blood and serum pure from arise, and heat from arise, and breath from arise—four races, color white and red-yellow and red and green-dark-blue five arise.
[32004] <prose> This result: breathing out as nature emanation.
[32005] <prose> That also: if arises to heart-essence meditation fortunate, that is; other all uncertain—some higher-realm birth, some lower-realm birth etcetera, common beings, bird and dog etcetera, evil, good friend examination scholar also arise.
[32006] <prose> Relics not breaking by elements' harm, not breaking even struck by iron hammer; ringsel fears—even ashes burned also break, ringsel not arising. Important to not burn too much when burning corpse hoping for ringsel. || 11580 ||
[32007] <prose> That also from Blazing Relics:
[32008] <prose> This and also like,
[32009] <prose> Ringsel tiny is,
[32010] <prose> Equal sesame seed dust particle,
[32011] <prose> This elements can break,
[32012] <prose> This emanation field.
[32013] <prose> Ringsel between joints or
[32014] <prose> Or between flesh and skin,
[32015] <prose> All these from produce arise.
[32016] <prose> That people common and || 11590 ||
[32017] <prose> Buddha ringsel—
[32018] <prose> Very pure not-pure, five light exist not,
[32019] <prose> Know by bodhi-tree and leaf.
[32020] <prose> Third, light—four aspects:
[32021] <prose> Essence, cause, division, and liberate measure result.
[32022] <prose> Light essence is
[32023] <prose>
[32024] <prose>

[32041] <prose>
[32042] <prose>
[32043] <prose>
[32044] <prose>
[32045] <prose> Self-clear five colors.
[32046] <prose> Continuum: from beyond two gathering of pure elements and familiar awareness own-tone, arises at time. || 11620 ||
[32047] <prose> Division: by occasion—upward-stand, wing-arise, rim three; or like ladder sky-piercing insert, reaching sky center appearing as light house.
[32048] <prose> Result: if rim arises, liberate in first bardo; if upward-stand sky-pierce like arises, liberate without reality bardo by primordially-pure transparent-penetrate; if wing-arise, liberate at last bardo life.
[32049] <prose> If light ladder like inserts around died body or house or crematorium, liberates in wisdom four union in samadhi seven days; if light house like arises, liberates in five days upon mass appearance.
[32050] <tantra> From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[32051] <prose> Light two:
[32052] <prose> Light arising as house way,
[32053] <prose> Light upward-stand ladder way.
[32054] <prose> That light house like obtains stability from five days, complete Buddha.
[32055] <prose> That light ladder like complete Buddha in seven days.
[32056] <tantra> From Blazing Relics: || 11630 ||
[32057] <prose> Light form three:
[32058] <prose> With rim around,
[32059] <tantra> From whatever trace arises,
[32060] <prose> This in first bardo,
[32061] <prose> Obtain certain result.
[32062] <prose> If upward stand,
[32063] <prose> This bardo not appearing,
[32064] <prose> Buddha in instant.
[32065] <prose> If light appears from wing,
[32066] <prose> This in last bardo, || 11640 ||
[32067] <prose> Obtain complete awakening.
[32068] <prose> That spontaneously-accomplished appearance emanation spreads, from that state emanation out-emanates to world ten directions also for beings' benefit—own-appearance reflection beings six and other-appearance self-character beings two fields, two emanations doing benefit.

[32084] <prose>
[32085] <prose>
[32086] <prose> || 11660 ||
[32087] <tantra> From that:
[32088] <prose> Thus in light mandala,
[32089] <prose> Whoever person gains enlightenment,
[32090] <prose> This by fortunate great mind,
[32091] <prose> By emanation to ten directions,
[32092] <prose> Does beings' benefit by nature—
[32093] <prose> This does, dakini.
[32094] <prose> Fourth, sound—four aspects:
[32095] <prose> Essence, division, cause, and result measure.
[32096] <prose> Sound essence: resounding in ear faculty. || 11670 ||
[32097] <prose> Division: though exist pleasant, unpleasant, middle etcetera, here slow continuity long peaceful drum-sound and fierce short wrathful thunder-sound two—called hum and thug.
[32098] <prose> Cause: general cause from condition of two clashing in sky gap, here arises from cause of obtaining stability.
[32099] <prose> Result: obtaining Sambhogakāya and from that emanation spreading.
[32100] <prose> That slow continuity long hum obtains stability from peaceful kaya in samadhi seven days; hum thug stack fierce short liberates to wrathful kaya.
[32101] <prose> That two also exist in five races.
[32102] <prose> Examining sign of liberating in whatever five race: if resounds east of yogin died place or corpse direction, vajra race; south, jewel race; west, lotus race; north, action race; if arises up, accomplishes Buddha of thus-gone race.
[32103] <tantra> From Blazing Relics:
[32104] <prose> Where died place house,
[32105] <prose> East direction near,
[32106] <prose> Sound very resounds, || 11680 ||
[32107] <prose> This becomes vajra race.
[32108] <prose> Likewise south direction,
[32109] <prose> Sound appears jewel race.
[32110] <prose> West lotus likewise.
[32111] <prose> North becomes action race.
[32112] <prose> Likewise up thus-gone.
[32113] <prose> Sound nature this-like:
[32114] <prose> Hum thug stack and
[32115] <prose> Continuity long gentle long sound,
[32116] <prose> By peaceful wrathful distinction. || 11690 ||
[32117] <prose> Thus possessing sound,
[32118] <prose> This Sambhogakāya,
[32119] <prose> Able kaya result.
[32120] <break> <prose> That all equal Sambhogakāya measure.
[32121] <break> <prose> Thus also Sambhogakāya,
[32122] <prose> Able to emit emanation kaya,
[32123] <prose> By method of able accord enter,
[32124] <prose> This ground final-reach.

[32142] <tantra> From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[32143] <prose> Sound also two:
[32144] <prose> If hum arises, complete Buddha in seven days;
[32145] <prose> If thug arises, complete Buddha in fourteen days.
[32146] <prose> Fifth, movement—four aspects: || 11720 ||
[32147] <prose> Essence, cause, division, and result.
[32148] <prose> Essence: vessel under ground supporting and lifting beings.
[32149] <prose> Cause: that person's power moves wind, moving.
[32150] <prose> Division: four—very moving, greatly moving, all very moving.
[32151] <prose> Result: common person, bodhisattva race etcetera, and though not seeing this door, death in preliminary training, or some conceptual object, or common labelled liberation labelled person doing faith and diligence in path, life transfer signs.
[32152] <prose> That breath separate immediately, if moves center, obtains sravaka noble ground white form seeing, dwells purifying later seven; that race and eighth and seeing and diminish and done realize and sravaka and pratyekabuddha ground—eight inferior grounds.
[32153] <prose> Death three days, if moves east, obtains pratyekabuddha ground. This—stream-enterer, once-returner, never-returner, arhat ground—four.
[32154] <prose> Death six days, if moves south, bodhisattva ground. This—great joy, stainless, light-maker, light-radiant, difficult-training, manifest, far-gone, immovable, excellent wisdom, dharma-cloud—ten cause grounds, all-light result ground—eleven.
[32155] <prose> Death nine days, if moves up with little sound, obtains awareness-holder ground. This—maturation ground and
