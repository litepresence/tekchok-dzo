[21111] <prose> From threefold expansion:
[21112] <prose> Completion is this:
[21113] <tantra> From Self-Arisen,
[21114] <prose> In Three Kayas' pure appearance,
[21115] <verse> One complete, two complete, all complete—
[21116] <prose> Wisdom-appearing, unceasing and clear; || 690 ||
[21117] <prose> Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating;
[21118] <prose> In concept-free awareness, pure;
[21119] <prose> Five light-rays, unceasing and clear;
[21120] <prose> In non-grasping great self-liberation,
[21121] <prose> Outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.
[21122] <prose> In action-released awareness,
[21123] <prose> Actor and acted, all dharmas complete in single moment.
[21124] <prose> In mind-separated awareness,
[21125] <prose> All appearance variety complete in single moment.
[21126] <prose> In self-appearance's great clear purity, || 700 ||

[21128] <prose> In great self-liberated self-appearance,
[21129] <prose> Other-arisen dharmas complete in single moment.
[21130] <prose> Such is Three Kayas' completion manner.
[21131] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21132] <prose> Awakening is being without dualistic-grasping aspect—
[21133] <tantra> From that same nature:
[21134] <verse> Without action, delusion awakens;
[21135] <prose> Without concept, afflictions awakens;
[21136] <prose> Without grasping, self-arising awakens; || 710 ||
[21137] <prose> Without clinging, conceptual thought awakens;
[21138] <prose> Without attachment, ignorance awakens.
[21139] <prose> Such is Three Kayas' awakening manner.
[21140] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21141] <prose> By expansion is meant this:
[21142] <prose> Qualities, primordially spontaneously accomplished, are expansive—
[21143] <tantra> From Self-Arisen,
[21144] <verse> In concept-free awareness,
[21145] <prose> Five lights clear, wisdom expansive;
[21146] <prose> In actor-acted-separated awareness, || 720 ||
[21147] <prose> Without perceived object, Three Kayas expand;
[21148] <prose> In object-free appearing awareness,
[21149] <prose> Without grasping mind, five lights expand;
[21150] <prose> In awareness, great wisdom,
[21151] <prose> Meaning-possessing self-appearance, fruit expands.
[21152] <prose> Such is Three Kayas' expansion manner.
[21153] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21154] <ornament> Second: Place expansive explanation.
[21155] <list> Dharmakāya,

[21167] <list> Object,
[21168] <list> Intent—ten in total.
[21169] <prose> Essence is this:
[21170] <prose> Empty-clarity, cessation without inherent existence—
[21171] <tantra> From that same nature:
[21172] <verse> Unchanging, cessation without, three-pervading—
[21173] <prose> Dharmakāya essence.
[21174] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21175] <prose> Definition is this:
[21176] <prose> Expanse, primordially pure, spontaneously accomplished dharmatā, clear-light Kaya being—essence primordially pure, unchanging, without delusion— || 750 ||
[21177] <prose> Naturally spontaneous, clear-light Kaya, great self-abiding—
[21178] <tantra> From that same nature:
[21179] <verse> Fearless, empty, and clear,

[21187] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's self-body.
[21188] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21189] <prose> Metaphor is this:

[21192] <prose> Like lotus, unstained by defects;
[21193] <prose> Like mountain, unchanging;
[21194] <prose> Like space, vast without boundary or center;

[21196] <tantra> From that same nature: || 770 ||
[21197] <verse> Sun, ocean, lotus,
[21198] <prose> Mountain, space, lion—three:
[21199] <prose> These are Dharmakāya's metaphors.
[21200] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21201] <prose> Transcending going and coming is the sign—
[21202] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[21203] <verse> Without going, without coming, without abiding—
[21204] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's self-sign.
[21205] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21206] <prose> Appearance is like sky-expanse's empty-clarity— || 780 ||
[21207] <tantra> From that same nature:
[21208] <verse> Unceasing, clear tone, empty by essence—
[21209] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's appearance.
[21210] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21211] <prose> Place is great pure memory-thought—
[21212] <tantra> From that:
[21213] <verse> Without limit, without object, without grasping—
[21214] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's place.
[21215] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21216] <prose> Characteristic is this: || 790 ||
[21217] <prose> Essence, nature, compassion—three inseparable—
[21218] <tantra> From that same nature:
[21219] <verse> Essence, nature, compassion—three:
[21220] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's characteristic.
[21221] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21222] <prose> Object is self-clear awareness, empty without extremity cut,
[21223] <prose> Five lights adorned within, spontaneously accomplished self-tone,
[21224] <prose> In expanse-awareness great inseparability, aspects individually unmixed—
[21225] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[21226] <verse> Clear, luminous, unmixed—three: || 800 ||
[21227] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's object.
[21228] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21229] <prose> Intent is this:
[21230] <prose> View unsevered by direction or side,
[21231] <prose> Meditation not established as entity or sign,
[21232] <prose> Conduct transcending both apprehending and grasping—
[21233] <prose> Spontaneously accomplished, primordially liberated—great fruition,
[21234] <prose> Primordially established, all meanings complete—enlightened activity.
[21235] <prose> Unsought, self-abiding excellence-qualities indeed—
[21236] <prose> Moreover from that same nature: || 810 ||
[21237] <verse> Free from cessation, free from fixation, free from attachment—
[21238] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's conduct.
[21239] <verse> Crystal-clear, lucidly nonwavering—
[21240] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's meditation.
[21241] <verse> Unseen, seeing-complete—view perfected—

[21243] <verse> Unmade, unarisen, free from arising—
[21244] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's fruition.
[21245] <verse> Nothing to accomplish, accomplished-complete—accomplishment perfected—
[21246] <prose> This is Dharmakāya's enlightened activity. || 820 ||
[21247] <verse> One arisen, two arisen, all arise—
[21248] <prose> These are Dharmakāya's excellence-qualities.
[21249] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21250] <ornament> Second: Sambhogakāya's basis—five expansive explanations:

[21253] <break> <list> Characteristics,
[21254] <list> Appearance mode,

[21256] <ornament> First: Essence—from Self-Arisen: || 830 ||

[21262] <prose> Possessing five abodes, five fields, five essences—
[21263] <prose> This is Sambhogakāya's complete essence.
[21264] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21265] <prose> Though expressed as birth from expanse's self-appearance arising aspect,
[21266] <prose> In meaning, birth lacks self-characteristic, thus death-free—for death-lord demon is conquered. || 840 ||
[21267] <tantra> From interior-free, precious jewel treasury emerges—
[21268] <prose> Arisen wisdom transcends all arising,
[21269] <prose> Realizing wisdom transforms within meaning,
[21270] <prose> In vast kayas, outer-inner aspects clear.

[21306] <list> Realize wisdom as rigpa. || 880 ||
[21307] <prose> Five bases:
[21308] <list> Light-clear basis: rigpa,
[21309] <list> Phenomena basis: Kunzhi,
[21310] <list> Delusion basis: mind,
[21311] <list> Path basis: lamp,

[21327] <list> Light fruition: delusion-appearance ceases,
[21328] <list> Realization fruition: delusion-thought clears,
[21329] <list> Self-appearance fruition: brought to exhaustion,
[21330] <list> Final fruition: dissolves into expanse.
[21331] <prose> Five abodes:
[21332] <list> Thigle abode: heart,
[21333] <list> Wisdom abode: crown,
[21334] <break> <list> Lamp abode: eyes,
[21335] <break> <list> Expanse-appearance abode: sky,

[21347] <break> <list> Wisdom's essence: realization,

[21349] <prose> Thus in five aspects appearing, some are Sambhogakāya's essence,
[21350] <prose> Some are the field,
[21351] <prose> Some are the method,
[21352] <prose> Some are the appearance,
[21353] <prose> Some are wisdom itself—thus Sambhogakāya is explained as one unified essence.
[21354] <break> <prose> Second, the etymology:
[21355] <break> <prose> Complete with qualities,
[21356] <prose> Engaging in pure light-clarity, || 930 ||
[21357] <prose> Both benefits spontaneously complete,
[21358] <prose> Wisdom arrived at its full measure,

[21401] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21402] <prose> Fourth, appearance manner:
[21403] <tantra> From rigpa's single nature,
[21404] <tantra> From expanse-kaya, light-kaya radiates to directions performing benefit;
[21405] <prose> Rigpa-kaya, unmoving from expanse, without change or transformation—two completions in self-appearance light-clarity field, the inner-outer appearance manner.
[21406] <tantra> From that same nature: || 980 ||
[21407] <verse> In one nature, two essences—
