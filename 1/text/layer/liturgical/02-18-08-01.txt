[25342] <prose> First, regarding the direct perception of Dharmatā: as experience increases, awareness arrives at its measure, and the vision exhausting Dharmatā is extensively explained.
[25343] <prose> Two aspects: the general place of direct connection, and identifying self-characteristics.
[25344] <prose> First, general direct perception—conventionally termed the famous direct, and ultimately the direct meeting the dhātu—two divisions.
[25345] <prose> First: sense-power direct perception—form and so forth, five objects, the nature of vision; and mind direct perception—enjoyment of near objects, certain cause, conceptuality's object within vision; and self-awareness direct perception—within pleasure, pain, and so forth, experience called vision; and the yogin's direct perception itself—near meeting with meaning, entering the actual point, particular correct awareness and that object of vision in a non-dual state, the certainty of experience free from grasping and holding.
[25346] <tantra> From Clear-Meaning: || 4920 ||
[25347] <verse> Gathering mind from all,
[25348] <verse> Inner self unmoving,
[25349] <verse> Though abiding, eye forms—
[25350] <verse> Seeing mind is sense-born.
[25351] <verse> Thus explained, like so.
[25352] <prose> Ultimate direct perception meeting the dhātu—determining that the essence of awareness, Dharmatā, exists in the heart;
[25353] <prose> That self-resonance, from the heart connecting cause to the eye, like sun and light-ray, certain cause and effect, meeting with faith through reasoning.
[25354] <prose> That reason: from the two, worldly and transcendent, this is the transcendent direct perception.
[25355] <prose> Transcendent: the chief mind knowing objects, certain cause of mind,
[25356] <prose> And the chief seeing the seal of main-point, awareness direct perception—from these two, || 4930 ||
[25357] <prose> This is called awareness direct perception.
[25358] <prose> Second: identifying self-characteristics, called the direct vision of Dharmatā.
[25359] <prose> Applying the word Dharmatā in proximity, four divisions:
[25360] <list> —Saṃsāra dharmas,
[25361] <list> Called this Dharmatā, Nirvāṇa Dharmatā;
[25362] <list> —Vision dharmas,
[25363] <list> Called this Dharmatā as empty;
[25364] <list> —Dharmas not liberating from non-existing main-point,
[25365] <list> Famous as Dharmatā, this Dharmatā certainly liberating through existence;
[25366] <list> —Dhātu dharmas, || 4940 ||
[25367] <list> Famous as awareness Dharmatā, desiring both as non-dual.
[25368] <prose> Direct perception: actually seeing existence in the activity field of sense-power; that also: not relying upon intellect—
[25369] <prose> Intellect's wisdom, whatever is sought, time not existing to find;
[25370] <prose> The seeker possesses no eye,
[25371] <prose> The cause possesses no luminous-clear form.
[25372] <tantra> From Collection:
[25373] <verse> Investigate with wisdom, aggregates' bottom not found.
[25374] <verse> Thus it was said.
[25375] <prose> This luminous-clear vision, famous as a term, not possessing form—subtle particles and coarse entities, this self-characteristic not existing as cause, the four elements' harm, destroy, crush not possible as cause;
[25376] <prose> Possessing form: possible to destroy and crush existing, that cause is form's characteristic. || 4950 ||
[25377] <prose> Three enumerations: outer body, speech, and mind three, establishing base with three main-points.
[25378] <list> —Inner: the main-point of Dharmatā field;
[25379] <list> —Dawning cause: the main-point of gate;
[25380] <list> —Wind abiding: three main-points clearing the path,
[25381] <list> —Secret: sequence of habituation's measure,
[25382] <list> —Ripening: sequence of signs,
[25383] <list> —Ultimate end: sequence of exhaustion,
[25384] <list> And taking measure with three,
[25385] <prose> Supreme vision.
[25386] <prose> Ripening: point; completion: body and three fruits completing cause; || 4960 ||
[25387] <prose> Three group: four determinations, — therefore called three.
[25388] <prose> Or: Dharmatā's three-bodies spontaneously complete existing, three self-resonance visions, outer dawning number;
[25389] <list> —Dharmakāya self-resonance: inner experience of awareness-emptiness;
[25390] <list> —Saṃbhogakāya self-resonance: outer clarity of five lights, wisdom self-clear;
[25391] <list> —Nirmāṇakāya self-resonance: dawning liberation, equal limitless discriminating-awareness potency with three,
[25392] <prose> Therefore called three, relying thus.
[25393] <prose> That also: base three establishing base, main-point of entity without existing difference,
[25394] <prose> And path three clearing obstacles, path without existing near or far,
[25395] <prose> And measure three delivering to measure, without existing similar, different, or random,
[25396] <prose> And fruit three delivering to exhaustion's end, without existing yes-no doubt, || 4970 ||
[25397] <prose> Therefore called direct perception.
[25398] <prose> Ordinary time: seeing three—pleasure, displeasure, equanimity, three dawning—pleasure, pain, middle;
[25399] <prose> Time of taking guru's instruction as experience: direct seeing three—dhātu, awareness, dharmas.
[25400] <prose> Dharmatā direct perception: main-point without existing intellect's word additions;
[25401] <prose> Time of habituation: main-point of self-ceasing delusion vision, seeing three-bodies' light point;
[25402] <prose> Time of arriving at measure: direct seeing three—clear, empty, pleasure; main-point: Dharmatā's self-exhaustion.
[25403] <prose> Thus: three enumeration place, relying upon other, fruit determined as simultaneously liberating.
[25404] <prose> Vision: whatever dawns, Dharmatā dawns; field: whatever dawns, dhātu dawns; manner: whatever dawns, light, light-house, and awareness hanging-cord dawn.
[25405] <prose> Buddha: with stone not-seeing, fruit: taking that vision as experience.
[25406] <prose> Thus: essence of Dharmatā direct perception vision—dhātu awareness luminous-clear vision. || 4980 ||
[25407] <tantra> From Letterless:
[25408] <verse> Direct perception: Buddhas without birth,
[25409] <verse> See vision pure without field.
[25410] <verse> Thus said, and:
[25411] <tantra> From Illusion:
[25412] <verse> Jewel, wish-fulfilling, desire-glory—
[25413] <verse> All Buddhas' direct perception.
[25414] <verse> Thus it was said.
[25415] <prose> Definitive-meaning: seeing three-bodies' vision.
[25416] <tantra> From Jewel Heap Tantra: || 4990 ||
[25417] <verse> Direct perception called seeing;
[25418] <verse> Three called three-bodies;
[25419] <verse> Certain arrival at field realm.
[25420] <verse> Thus it was said.
[25421] <prose> Purpose: liberating without error or obscuration, this main-point.
[25422] <tantra> That same, from:
[25423] <verse> Dharmatā direct perception without main-point—
[25424] <verse> Similar to going to precipice without eye.
[25425] <verse> Thus it was said.
[25426] <prose> Main-point from Thalgyur: || 5000 ||
[25427] <verse> Main-point: arrow not moving;
[25428] <verse> Apply three gaze manners this time.
[25429] <verse> Thus said, and:
[25430] <tantra> From Letterless:
[25431] <verse> Make fully place eye;
[25432] <verse> Dhātu emerges from eye corner itself;
[25433] <verse> Gaze eye at sky element.
[25434] <verse> Thus it was said.
[25435] <prose> Vision is:
[25436] <break> <tantra> From Thalgyur: || 5010 ||
[25437] <break> <verse> Dharmatā direct perception is;
[25438] <verse> Certain emergence from sense-power gate;
[25439] <verse> Clear in sky without clouds.
[25440] <verse> Thus said, and:
[25441] <verse> Also channel and delusion-wheel:
[25442] <verse> Five wisdoms abide in nature,
[25443] <verse> See bubble by eye.
[25444] <verse> Thus said, and:
[25445] <tantra> From Self-Dawn:
[25446] <verse> Body of light possessing five wisdoms, || 5020 ||
[25447] <verse> Fully clear in hanging-cord,
[25448] <verse> That also: go and come,
[25449] <verse> Move and shake.
[25450] <verse> Thus said, and:
[25451] <tantra> From Lion Power Complete:
[25452] <verse> That entity of self-vision awareness
[25453] <verse> Abides in wisdom hanging-cord.
[25454] <verse> Thus said, and:
[25455] <tantra> From Jewel Display:
[25456] <verse> Said: arrow, water lamp—fully perfect Buddha, || 5030 ||
[25457] <verse> Awareness hanging-cord body fully clear.
[25458] <prose> Manner of taking experience: first, short sessions in great number;
[25459] <prose> Second, extend session, extend duration; third, without day or night, take experience,
[25460] <prose> Make not move, place awareness in dhātu fence.
