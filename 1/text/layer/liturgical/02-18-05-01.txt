[25027] <ornament> First, speech training:
[25028] <prose> Train in short sessions to speak less, cutting ordinary speech;
[25029] <prose> Then train long;
[25030] <prose> Occasionally, though no cause for speech, speak alone.
[25031] <break> <prose> Abiding: mantra and utterance, etc., virtuous utterance—not denying;
[25032] <break> <prose> Not mixing even one syllable with others.
[25033] <prose> At this time, the body's sign makes meaning understood.
[25034] <prose> Swallowing: not doing all mantra etc. utterance;
[25035] <prose> Firm: not transgressing from the state of not uttering anything—
[25036] <prose> Not even body sign. || 4610 ||
[25037] <tantra> From the Seed Tantra:
[25038] <verse> Speech like a mute,
[25039] <verse> Not making sign with anyone,
[25040] <verse> Thus, whoever does this—
[25041] <verse> Mind's projecting and gathering self-cut.
[25042] <tantra> Thus it was said.
[25043] <prose> Cutting speech's speaking, inexpressible meaning arises in mind.
[25044] <prose> Not mixed with other sentient beings' speech—body purified purpose exists.
[25045] <prose> By body purified, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and sky-goer Ḍākinīs
[25046] <prose> Bless, liberating body into illusory body. || 4620 ||
[25047] <prose> Then, object blocked, speech purified—
[25048] <prose> Sign meeting non-humans, conversation comes.
[25049] <prose> Speech utterance blocked, mind purified—
[25050] <prose> That sign: first seeing non-human form,
[25051] <prose> Then clairvoyance arises.
[25052] <prose> Thus, speech's main point: instruction on cutting body-mind connection.
[25053] <prose> Mind's main point: not thinking any thought from eye gazing at sky expanse.
[25054] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[25055] <verse> Mind placed in dhātu, accomplished.
[25056] <tantra> Thus it was said. || 4630 ||
[25057] <prose> Thus, chief body and speech bound, mind secondarily caught—dhātu-awareness dawning, elements' binding cut. From the Seed Tantra:
[25058] <verse> Thus binding body, speech, and three—
[25059] <verse> In dharmadhātu's vision,
[25060] <verse> This becomes habituation.
[25061] <tantra> Thus it was said, and:
[25062] <verse> Body and speech and mind's main-point—
[25063] <verse> Know and rely, liberate from saṃsāra.
[25064] <tantra> Thus it was said.
[25065] <ornament> Second meaning: three main-points relying, direct self-point delivery, three are:
[25066] <list> Bind three main-points in vajra seal; || 4640 ||
[25067] <list> Introduce awareness's own face directly;
[25068] <list> Show vision's dawning manner from that.
[25069] <prose> First, two are:
[25070] <list> Show general seal of three main-points,
[25071] <list> Deliver particular self's main-point to point.
[25072] <prose> First: three main-points—gate, field, and wind-awareness.
[25073] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[25074] <verse> Three main-points—do not separate from instruction;
[25075] <verse> That also: gate and field itself,
[25076] <verse> Wind and awareness main-point itself seal. || 4650 ||
[25077] <tantra> Thus said.
[25078] <prose> Example: like weapon hitting vital point—
[25079] <prose> Channels or heart-meaning etcetera main-point hit,
[25080] <prose> Whatever done, not feeling, dying similar.
[25081] <prose> Three main-points also: dharmatā no ground for change.
[25082] <prose> Gate main-point: cause to see;
[25083] <prose> Field main-point: cause not to change;
[25084] <prose> Wind-awareness main-point: deliver to sign-measure.
[25085] <prose> That also: gate main-point like threshold;
[25086] <prose> Field main-point like escort; || 4660 ||
[25087] <prose> Wind-awareness main-point like bandit.
[25088] <prose> Arrow hit, person cannot change power, captured;
[25089] <prose> Enemy comes, cannot enter bandit's hand—
[25090] <prose> Impossible not to hit dharmatā direct main-point.
[25091] <prose> That also: field not existing, no basis ground;
[25092] <prose> Gate not existing, beings' path lost;
[25093] <prose> Wind-awareness main-point not existing, knowing-awareness does not penetrate inside—
[25094] <prose> Therefore three main-points determined.
[25095] <prose> More than that: limitless, lose main-point;
[25096] <prose> Few: meaning not accomplished—therefore three determined. || 4670 ||
[25097] <ornament> Second: Deliver particular self's main-point to point:
[25098] <prose> Determine general sequence of three main-points, deliver individual main-points to point. First: body, speech, mind three not moving, gate and field and wind-awareness bound.
[25099] <prose> Seeing differentiated by lineage scripture:
[25100] <tantra> From the Self-Arising Awareness Tantra,
[25101] <verse> Thus body, etcetera—
[25102] <verse> By fully pressing all main-points,
[25103] <verse> Awareness itself and directly,
[25104] <verse> From guru's instruction, know.
[25105] <tantra> Thus said, and:
[25106] <tantra> From Thalgyur: || 4680 ||
[25107] <verse> Relying upon actual main, self mind,
[25108] <verse> Body main-point and speech and also,
[25109] <verse> Relying upon mind main-point,
[25110] <verse> Making wind somehow slow,
[25111] <verse> Arising from fully projecting,
[25112] <verse> Body and mind connection cut that,
[25113] <verse> Not reversing even in three realms.
[25114] <tantra> Thus said, and:
[25115] <verse> Gate: look with three-bodies' eye;
[25116] <verse> Field: separate from obscuration-doer; || 4690 ||
[25117] <verse> Wind-awareness: accomplish wisdom by slowness.
[25118] <tantra> Thus it was said.
[25119] <ornament> Second: From three main-points—gate,
[25120] <list> Field,
[25121] <list> And wind-awareness.
