[36786] <prose> The first is path-appearance, for the great treasury of spontaneous presence's primordial purity—meaningful fruition like a house— || 16360 ||
[36787] <prose> One enters there and emerges again; from primordial purity one must manifest as external display.
[36788] <prose> The manner of arising is manifestation from essence abiding as kāya.
[36789] <prose> Path-appearance has two types:
[36790] <list> The path of making oneself a Buddha, preceding fruition;
[36791] <list> Hence, the path of guiding those to be trained, having made oneself a Buddha, kāyas manifesting for benefit.
[36792] <prose> Thus here it is considered the path-appearance of no-more-learning—the meaning wherein two are non-contradictory and connected: three kāyas as path-appearance and as fruition.
[36793] <ornament> The meaning wherein result is two, contradictory, — yet relationship is established.
[36794] <prose> The liberated Dharma-kāya's three kāyas manifesting externally as path from the inner Expanse—these emanations of kāyas and wisdoms—
[36795] <prose> Dharma-kāya as wisdom-mind,
[36796] <prose> Saṃbhoga-kāya as that very kāya, || 16370 ||
[36797] <prose> Emanation-kāya appearing as deeds—for benefit arises.
[36798] <prose> Moreover, the inner clear manifestation-ground of kāyas and wisdoms without gathering or separation, and Vajrasattva's Dharmatā,
[36799] <prose> And from that, the externally clear three kāyas' path-appearance self-manifesting, though similar in awareness's state,
[36800] <prose> External and internal distinction is distinguished;
[36801] <prose> Therefore, <tantra> From the aspect of self-appearance, saṃbhoga and emanation manifest in the appearance-perception of those to be trained for their benefit.
[36802] <prose> Though a single awareness-display,
[36803] <prose> Self-appearance is not seen by those to be trained,
[36804] <prose> Yet that which manifests from it is seen—thus distinguishing between the two similars.
[36805] <tantra> From Lion's Perfect Power:
[36806] <tantra> "Vajrasattva's Dharmatā and || 16380 ||
[36807] <tantra> Self-appearance's pure maṇḍala—two,
[36808] <tantra> Similar in ground, — yet greatly divergent."
[36809] <tantra> Thus it is explained.
[36810] <prose> Thus inner Expanse and
[36811] <prose> External clear path-appearance aspect, without division,
[36812] <prose> If three kāyas are considered self-appearance's fruition,
[36813] <prose> Emanation-kāya appears to those to be trained like a reflection,
[36814] <prose> So liberation-ground's primordially pure Dharma-kāya would appear to those to be trained,
[36815] <prose> For three kāyas are of single essence.
[36816] <prose> Dharma-kāya would appear as radiance-gathering and color, || 16390 ||
[36817] <prose> For saṃbhoga and emanation of the same essence as you appear.
[36818] <prose> Or else, emanation-kāya would not appear to those to be trained,
[36819] <prose> For Dharma-kāya does not appear.
[36820] <break> <prose> Therefore, though three kāyas are known as single essence,
[36821] <break> <prose> That single-essence variety is not to be adopted;
[36822] <prose> Emanation-kāya is compassion-aspect,
[36823] <prose> Yet its emanated appearance is merely reflected emanation,
[36824] <prose> Not true emanation-kāya,
[36825] <prose> For it is not compassion.
[36826] <break> <prose> This distinction of philosophical systems is extremely subtle; intelligent ones should investigate and understand. || 16400 ||
[36827] <break> <prose> These are crucial essential points.
[36828] <prose> The second, explanation of the topic at hand, comprises three aspects:
[36829] <list> General presentation of three kāyas' fields;
[36830] <list> Detailed explanation of wisdoms' fields;
[36831] <list> Summary of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities' five fields' meaning.
[36832] <ornament> The first: from Dharma-kāya,
[36833] <prose> Saṃbhoga-kāya,
[36834] <prose> Emanation-kāya—
