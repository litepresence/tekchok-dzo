[25461] <prose> Second: extend the session, extending duration;
[25462] <prose> Third: without day or night, take experience,
[25463] <prose> Place awareness in dhātu's fence, make unmoving.
[25464] <tantra> From Blazing Lamp:
[25465] <verse> Dhātu makes awareness's self-field;
[25466] <verse> Vajra itself is hanging-cord; || 5040 ||
[25467] <verse> Make place this inside.
[25468] <verse> Thus it was said.
[25469] <prose> Fruit is:
[25470] <prose> When outer dhātu-vision, eye unmoving, self time;
[25471] <prose> Inner: awareness abiding in base, cause resonance to dissolve from self, circling;
[25472] <prose> Separated from lung wind horse cause;
[25473] <prose> Wisdom sky dissolves into dhātu sky, cause equal limitless liberation;
[25474] <prose> Pure awareness, unmoving in dhātu, abides in nature of luminous-clear intent, heart-in mode.
[25475] <prose> That yogin: called capturing original Dharmatā luminous-clear, from Saṃsāra name empty,
[25476] <prose> Three-realms corpse cut is. || 5050 ||
[25477] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[25478] <verse> That Dharmatā direct main-point:
[25479] <verse> Know by seeing only,
[25480] <verse> And realize by that knowing,
[25481] <verse> Become liberated by realizing only.
[25482] <verse> Liberate called: not untie.
[25483] <verse> Sky in sky,
[25484] <verse> Dissolve nature not-aim cause,
[25485] <verse> Equal limitless, not possessing part.
[25486] <verse> Capacity-possess find direct: || 5060 ||
[25487] <verse> Three-realms Saṃsāra name empty cause,
[25488] <verse> Three-realms corpse cut.
[25489] <verse> Thus it was said.
[25490] <prose> Second: from two—experience increasing above vision:
[25491] <prose> Briefly show:
[25492] <prose> Above, above purify dhātu awareness cause;
[25493] <prose> Outer: like non-dual abiding of awareness hanging-cord in dhātu-vision;
[25494] <prose> Inner: non-dual abiding of awareness dhātu, self-resonance in pure empty dhātu,
[25495] <prose> Cause luminous-clear mother-son mix; experience vision increases various.
[25496] <tantra> From Thalgyur: || 5070 ||
[25497] <verse> Experience vision increasing above is:
[25498] <verse> From wisdom color outer emerge,
[25499] <verse> Up-stand and wing dawn,
[25500] <verse> Various points, body itself,
[25501] <verse> Clear in coarse vision field.
[25502] <verse> Thus it was said.
[25503] <prose> Extensively explain: two are experience called experience increasing above—
[25504] <list> —Knowing experience,
[25505] <list> And vision experience.
[25506] <prose> Knowing experience: worldly knowing experience, samādhi-obtained pleasure happiness, mind desiring song, dance, and so forth, heart desire; || 5080 ||
[25507] <prose> Transcend knowing experience—empty, clear, extreme separate, realize measure with discriminating-awareness potency.
[25508] <prose> This same: from habituation of first, middle, end—
[25509] <list> —Knowing pleasure happiness experience,
[25510] <list> End change experience, and vision experience, three arise.
