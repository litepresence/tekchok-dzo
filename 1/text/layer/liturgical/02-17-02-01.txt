[22287] <prose> First:
[22288] <tantra> From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[22289] <verse> Even the inconceivable yogin
[22290] <verse> Is included within the five types.
[22291] <verse> Moreover, that is shown like this:
[22292] <verse> Great potency complete, great prophecy obtained,
[22293] <verse> Great breath emitted, and body half—
[22294] <verse> These are the karma-obeying-action yogins.
[22295] <verse> Thus it is said.
[22296] <prose> The four later yogins are also explained as included within these five. || 1870 ||
[22297] <tantra> From that itself:
[22298] <verse> Moreover, the five yogins are complete.
[22299] <verse> Thus it is said.
[22300] <prose> Explaining the five yogins individually:
[22301] <tantra> From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[22302] <verse> All beings of the three realms
[22303] <verse> Are karma-obeying-action yogins.
[22304] <verse> That person who sees the truth,
[22305] <verse> Whose delusion-appearance has ceased—
[22306] <verse> That is the body-mind half-yogin. || 1880 ||
[22307] <verse> In spontaneous presence of various appearances,
[22308] <verse> Obtaining certainty
[22309] <verse> Is the prophecy-obtained yogin.
[22310] <verse> That final of final sense-power,
[22311] <verse> Dwelling in the emanation realms of the ten directions—
[22312] <verse> That tathāgata
[22313] <verse> Is the great-breath-emitting yogin.
[22314] <verse> In great primordial purity, unchanging,
[22315] <verse> That which is free from all action and effort
[22316] <verse> Is the great-potency-complete yogin. || 1890 ||
[22317] <verse> Thus it is said.
[22318] <prose> Second, explaining the vessel-possessing individual:
[22319] <prose> Generally, the vessel suitable for being taught the Great Perfection dharma is, as shown before:
[22320] <prose> Respecting the guru, great generosity and giving,
[22321] <prose> Great faith, wisdom, and effort,
[22322] <prose> Shying away from non-virtue, wearied with saṃsāra.
[22323] <prose> Particularly, for the supreme secret Great Perfection: possessing the fortune of faithful conduct—one possessing the eight is shown.
[22324] <verse> Particularly, completely giving the teaching of this dharma,
[22325] <prose> The person who holds it, becoming the life-pillar of the victory-banner-peak teaching,
[22326] <tantra> From the Thalgyur: || 1900 ||
[22327] <prose> Holding view and meditation,
[22328] <verse> Possessing excellent faith and effort,
[22329] <verse> Capable of giving, respecting the guru,
[22330] <verse> Observant of vows, shying from non-virtue,
[22331] <verse> Holding extremely unchanging stability,
[22332] <verse> Or long-natured, force slow,
[22333] <verse> Possessing relaxed dullness of relaxed dullness,
[22334] <verse> Few thoughts, slow nature,
[22335] <verse> Free from body and speech action, and
[22336] <verse> Possessing wisdom—such a one holds. || 1910 ||
[22337] <verse> Thus it is said.
[22338] <tantra> From the Norbu Trakö Chenpo'i Gyü (Jewel-Arrayed Great Tantra):
[22339] <verse> Kye ma! Listen, god caste!
[22340] <verse> I teach well—retain this in mind.
[22341] <verse> This great appearance maṇḍala
[22342] <verse> Is not to be shown to all.
[22343] <verse> Capable of secrecy, show to some.
[22344] <verse> This secret-mantra, supreme secret,
[22345] <verse> Thus is the caste of the teaching.
[22346] <verse> Capable of seeking the secret, || 1920 ||
[22347] <verse> Respecting the secret meaning,
[22348] <verse> Great wisdom and intelligence,
[22349] <verse> Possessed of samaya vows—show to these.
[22350] <verse> Then by the particular assembly,
[22351] <verse> Vajradhara was also asked:
[22352] <verse> Kye kye! Bhagavān Vajradhara!
[22353] <verse> This Great Completion instruction, secret meaning,
[22354] <verse> Is not self-appearing shown.
[22355] <break> <verse> The cuckoo of definite prophecy supreme—
[22356] <verse> Of this person who is taught, || 1930 ||
[22357] <break> <verse> Great caste and conduct,
[22358] <verse> We ask the three: color and characteristics.
[22359] <verse> Then Bhagavān Vajradhara,
[22360] <verse> Arising from samādhi,
[22361] <verse> Commanded to the particular assembly:
[22362] <verse> Kye ma! Particular assembly, listen!
[22363] <verse> I shall teach—listen well!
[22364] <verse> The distinction of castes is like this:
[22365] <verse> Royal caste and brahmin caste,
[22366] <verse> Likewise great merchant caste, || 1940 ||
[22367] <verse> And to greatly special persons,
[22368] <verse> The secret-mantra definite meaning is taught.
[22369] <break> <verse> Or, examine color without caste—
[22370] <break> <verse> Whatever of the two, man or woman,
[22371] <verse> Possessing this color
[22372] <verse> Is said to be a vessel of Great Completion.
[22373] <verse> From coarse limbs and color,
[22374] <verse> Good teeth, white, conch-like,
[22375] <verse> Slightly red eye-pupils, and
[22376] <verse> Great hair characteristics also: || 1950 ||
[22377] <break> <verse> Coiling to the right, dark color.
[22378] <break> <verse> Small respect for the body, and
[22379] <break> <verse> Ordinary outer conduct.
[22380] <break> <verse> Spontaneous words spoken, and
[22381] <verse> Or all kinds of words—
[22382] <verse> However said by one,
[22383] <verse> That person also speaks thus.
[22384] <verse> The Great Completion instruction is said to be taught.
[22385] <verse> When those are complete in one,
[22386] <verse> Whether butcher caste or prostitute caste, || 1960 ||
[22387] <verse> Sweeper caste is also suitable,
[22388] <verse> Whatever low-caste, whoever they may be—
[22389] <verse> Give this secret instruction essence.
[22390] <verse> When the cause is small, means lacking,
[22391] <verse> Also prepare self-means,
[22392] <verse> Completely give without remainder.
[22393] <verse> This secret essence, three instructions,
[22394] <verse> The methods of examining caste and color—
[22395] <verse> After I am parinirvāṇa,
[22396] <verse> This secret instruction, again the essence, || 1970 ||
[22397] <verse> Thus the definite king is taught.
[22398] <verse> To those persons who are taught,
[22399] <verse> The above instruction should be taught.
[22400] <verse> Thus it was spoken.
[22401] <prose> Second meaning: how to practice, definite in two accomplishment manners:
[22402] <prose> The beggar manner of accomplishment, and
[22403] <prose> The deer manner of accomplishment.
[22404] <prose> First:
[22405] <tantra> From abandoning one's own land,
[22406] <verse> Going to other lands and regions, || 1980 ||
[22407] <verse> Making anyone not recognize one's name, good or bad,
[22408] <verse> What is known or not known, and so forth,
[22409] <verse> Hiding as ordinary,
[22410] <verse> Sustaining food and clothing by begging,
[22411] <verse> Going a little far from cave-villages,
[22412] <verse> Or to solitude,
[22413] <verse> Accomplishing without signs in inns, and so forth.
[22414] <prose> At this time: not desiring to show one's quality or name is the sign of not desiring fame, and
[22415] <prose> Not making inquiries or hints about others' gurus, dharmas, and so forth is the sign of confidence in one's own instruction, without doubt.
[22416] <verse> Thus also: || 1990 ||
[22417] <tantra> From the Instruction Precious Wheel:
[22418] <verse> In the direction abandoning enemy and friend,
[22419] <verse> Accomplish in the manner of a beggar.
[22420] <verse> Thus it is said.
[22421] <prose> Second, deer-like accomplishment: going to great empty valleys, abandoning three actions, and accomplishing in very solitary mountainside rocks with bird-shelters, or forest groves, or
[22422] <prose> Mountain peaks, or
[22423] <prose> Snow slopes, or
[22424] <prose> Going to great empty valleys, abandoning three actions, and accomplishing.
[22425] <prose> Regarding that also: body actions stretching to the sky, moving,
[22426] <verse> Prostrations, and so forth, and || 2000 ||
[22427] <verse> All whatever speech expressions, and
[22428] <verse> Mind's emanation-gathering, different thoughts—all that contradicts self-instruction, abandon.
[22429] <verse> One-pointedly, without distraction, only the supreme instruction should be accomplished.
[22430] <prose> Purpose: body relaxed, channels tight;
[22431] <prose> Channels relaxed, wind-mind nature relaxed;
[22432] <prose> Wind-mind relaxed, thought-force ceases, and
[22433] <prose> Non-thought samādhi arises in the mind.
[22434] <prose> Speech relaxed, inexpressible meaning arises in the mind.
[22435] <prose> For not speaking, the inexpressible nature dwells.
[22436] <prose> Mind's memory abandoning emanation-gathering, samādhi arises as self-nature. || 2010 ||
[22437] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[22438] <verse> By possessing faith, mind free from saṃsāra,
[22439] <verse> Guru should be worshipped and giving done.
[22440] <verse> Abandoning all connections with saṃsāra,
[22441] <verse> Abandoning friends, should dwell alone.
[22442] <verse> Thus it is said.
[22443] <prose> Third: showing the actual meaning of practice—four:
[22444] <prose> The yogin who progressively conducts conduct,
[22445] <prose> The yogin who progressively meditates,
[22446] <prose> The yogin who progressively views, || 2020 ||
[22447] <prose> The yogin who progressively obtains the fruition.
[22448] <tantra> From the Jewel-Arrayed:
[22449] <verse> The yogin of progressive conduct,
[22450] <verse> The yogin of progressive meditation,
[22451] <verse> The yogin of progressive view,
[22452] <verse> The yogin of progressive fruition.
[22453] <verse> Thus it is said.
[22454] <prose> Thus showing practice in the four: twenty meanings.
[22455] <tantra> From the Jewel-Heap Tantra:
[22456] <prose> That progressive distinction is like this: || 2030 ||
[22457] <verse> Practice in one's own system,
[22458] <verse> By the manner of four owners,
[22459] <verse> Also hold the four meanings' essence,
[22460] <verse> By the four, that domain, kinds of rigpa,
[22461] <verse> Cut the birth-continuum of appearance like this,
[22462] <verse> By four placement-method instructions,
[22463] <verse> Self-release appearance-existence dharmas,
[22464] <verse> By the four pure liberation piths,
[22465] <verse> Transform afflictions by self-power,
[22466] <verse> That self-measure arrives. || 2040 ||
[22467] <verse> Four examples show self-confidence,
[22468] <verse> By four, great confidence of unchanging view,
[22469] <verse> Also hold the measure of irreversible wisdom.
[22470] <verse> Whoever familiarizes with this,
[22471] <verse> In the nature of Great Completion,
[22472] <verse> By this, the untouchable, unstained samaya,
[22473] <verse> Whatever appears becomes like this,
[22474] <verse> All wisdom is grasped at the core,
[22475] <verse> Obtains the secret great Mahāmudrā.
[22476] <prose> From the progressive practice of distinguishing parts of the spoken meaning. || 2050 ||
