[26354] <verse> Tenth: Attainment of the Dharma-Cloud-Like Ground.
[26355] <prose> That is obtaining without abandoning this very shell of truth-vision.
[26356] <prose> Those persons who abandon the shell obtain thus. || 5930 ||
[26357] <prose> Delusion-vision ceasing, dawning as heap-vision—this is the eleventh: Attainment of the Universal Light Ground.
[26358] <prose> Then, not attaching even to that vision, unstained by all outer-inner dharmas—
[26359] <verse> Twelfth: Attainment of the Non-Attaching Lotus-Possessing Ground.
[26360] <prose> Then, from the self-heart, wisdom-ray lines dawning, from sky-space, five light-heaps abiding in wheel-manner—
[26361] <verse> Thirteenth: Attainment of the Great Collection Wheel of Letters Ground.
[26362] <prose> Then, abiding in wisdom-vision is the fourteenth: Attainment of the Great Samadhi Ground.
[26363] <prose> Then, certainty obtained at spontaneously-accomplished ground is the fifteenth: Attainment of the Vajra-Holder Ground.
[26364] <prose> Then, wisdom naturally dawning at primordially-pure ground, without anything above that, is
[26365] <break> <verse> Sixteenth: Attainment of the Wisdom-Guru Ground.
[26366] <break> <prose> Those are applied through similar aspects of vision-manner; they are not the actual ten bodhisattva grounds. || 5940 ||
[26367] <prose> Those grounds also: divisions from the vision-aspect of one ground—awareness-luminosity without purifying or traversing.
[26368] <prose> In meaning, it is one awareness-ground.
[26369] <prose> For obtaining Buddha Vajradhara, specific causal grounds are not needed,
[26370] <prose> for they are applied thus to different entry-doors of path-essentials.
[26371] <prose> The manner of obtaining each ground through cause-result sequence, like common ones, and
[26372] <prose> mantra outer-inner generation-completion effort-accomplishment grounds obtained without needing purification.
[26373] <tantra> From that itself:
[26374] <tantra> "Therefore, although inconceivable beings exist, there is not more than one wisdom-essence.
[26375] <tantra> 'Ground' and 'path' do not exist separately.
[26376] <tantra> Know that there is no need to purify or traverse ground and path." || 5950 ||
[26377] <tantra> From the Kun byed:
[26378] <verse> "Awareness spontaneously complete, not transformed, not purified."
[26379] <prose> Thus it is.
[26380] <ornament> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[26381] <ornament> Showing the Summary of the Luminous Vajra Essence Path—the Eighteenth Chapter.
[26382] <prose> Thus, having shown the actual path,
[26383] <prose> now, regarding the path's distinction: for those of supreme faculties, the supreme means of liberating without meditation—bringing certainty to the secret instruction of Trekchö—has three parts:
[26384] <list> 1. Cutting the path through bringing self-essence to the point,
[26385] <list> 2. Binding the summary through cutting connection-words at the point,
[26386] <list> 3. Clearing obstacles through cutting confidence-liberation at the point. || 5960 ||
[26387] <prose> The first has three:
[26388] <prose> Bringing certainty to the essence, sky-like, beyond accepting, rejecting, action, and effort, in the nature of Great Perfection.
