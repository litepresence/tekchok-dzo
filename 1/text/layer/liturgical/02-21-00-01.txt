[9538] <prose> Though there are many forms of showing examples, among examples, that which becomes supreme is called the precious crystal.
[9539] <prose> Through showing by means of the crystal, naturally completely pure, clear without outside or inside,
[9540] <prose> Recognize the dharmakāya. || 9540 ||
[9541] <prose> Relying on the inner light of the crystal,
[9542] <prose> From the wind possessing four limbs that becomes the life of prajñā,
[9543] <prose> Recognize the manner of clarity as the body of prajñā.
[9544] <prose> Relying on the light of outer clarity,

[9546] <prose> Through showing by means of the crystal support, recognize the nature of ground-abiding wisdom.
[9547] <prose> Recognize the wisdom holding the characteristic of inner clarity.
[9548] <prose> Recognize the wisdom of all-knowing through outer clarity.
[9549] <prose> Recognize the wisdom of all-knowing through dissolving inside.
[9550] <prose> Through showing the various appearances of the crystal, || 9550 ||
[9551] <prose> Recognize the manner of appearing.
[9552] <prose> Through showing the nature of the crystal itself, recognize the single abiding nature.
[9553] <prose> Through the crystal possessing its own light, recognize as Rigpa wisdom.
[9554] <prose> These also, when summarized from the definite aspect of showing examples:
[9555] <tantra> From the Tantra of Arranged Lamps:
[9556] <verse> Through intention signs and ear-continuum lineage,
[9557] <verse> The valid cognition of secret mantra meaning arises.
[9558] <verse> Relying on the example, recognize the meaning.
[9559] <verse> Relying on signs, confidence is born.
[9560] <verse> Through deciding the essence of meaning, || 9560 ||
[9561] <verse> The three wisdoms established in the ground,
[9562] <verse> Abiding in the manner of a seed,
[9563] <verse> Through prajñā arising from conditions,
[9564] <verse> Through ripening in the manner of fruit,
[9565] <verse> The darkness of non-recognition is cleared.
[9566] <verse> Through the self-purification of obstacles to the knowable,
[9567] <verse> The fruit not sought is seen by oneself.
[9568] <tantra> The meaning thus spoken should be introduced in sequence.
[9569] <prose> To that, first the general ground of self-arisen nature body
[9570] <prose> Should be introduced. || 9570 ||
[9571] <prose> In that, nature, nature, and compassion abide as three.
[9572] <prose> That single bindu possessing the essence of empty Rigpa,
[9573] <prose> The teacher holds a single clear mirror,
[9574] <prose> Shows the student,
[9575] <prose> And speaks these words:
[9576] <verse> "This mirror of Samantabhadra's clear appearance,
[9577] <verse> "Through appropriate examples, makes one recognize the nature.
[9578] <verse> "That meaning of recognition is the introduction to clear appearance.
[9579] <verse> "First, the introduction to Samantabhadra's abiding nature.
[9580] <verse> "rigpa abiding in direct penetration is like crystal. || 9580 ||
[9581] <verse> "rigpa, thought-free and clear, is like crystal.
[9582] <verse> "rigpa abiding in spontaneous presence is like crystal.
[9583] <verse> "rigpa, unceasing and direction-free, is like crystal."
[9584] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[9585] <prose> Though five lights are clear to outer eye,
[9586] <prose> Possessing nature of clear from within,
[9587] <prose> Nature:
[9588] <prose> White light also abides not separate from that, demonstrating compassion.
[9589] <prose> Though crystal essence demonstrates primordially pure and three,
[9590] <prose> By non-separation, understand through that example how single bindu meaning abides within. || 9590 ||
[9591] <prose> Then demonstrating delusion-base:
[9592] <prose> Extend crystal to sun-ray,
[9593] <prose> Demonstrate outer two interior lights,
[9594] <prose> Condition of cause: ignorance of one self-nature at time of base-appear arising from base.
[9595] <prose> Field possessing five colors,
[9596] <prose> Demonstrate mind searching all for that subtle white.
[9597] <prose> That beginning move arises together with light,
[9598] <prose> Arises as knowable's obscuration: co-arising ignorance.
[9599] <prose> By wisdom's sense-power transcending from All-Good base, separate distinction in one moment,
[9600] <prose> Complete Buddha in one moment, || 9600 ||
[9601] <prose> Is before Buddha as great-grandfather without common of all Buddhas.
[9602] <prose> By this liberation manner,
[9603] <prose> Should know all first Buddha's arising manner and arising manner.
[9604] <verse> First Buddha without cause,
[9605] <verse> Buddha without beginning or end,
[9606] <verse> One wisdom eye without stain.
[9607] <tantra> Thus spoken from Manjushri.
[9608] <prose> Demonstrating All-Good's liberation base.
[9609] <prose> Also, having known base-appear arising from base and liberating, speaks that immeasurable Buddhas not deluded in saṃsāra now also arise from space.
[9610] <prose> That base-appear, sentient beings not knowing as self-appear, || 9610 ||
[9611] <prose> Arises as affliction-obscuration of all-imagined ignorance.
[9612] <tantra> Thus,
[9613] <prose> Delusion various arises by awareness rise-sleep habit-continuum.
[9614] <prose> That also like placing hopes on various colored crystal cloth,
[9615] <prose> Or placing each white light on each white color etc.
[9616] <prose> There, awareness-wisdom and concept-collection net.
[9617] <prose> Entering body's interior,
[9618] <prose> Manner of four-holding awareness abiding in heart center,
[9619] <prose> Give introduction to manner pervading all sentient beings.
[9620] <prose> That is also introduction of nature's delusion manner. || 9620 ||
[9621] <verse> Delusion arising from condition like crystal light.
[9622] <verse> Various things appearing like crystal light.
[9623] <verse> Appearing yet essence unchanging like crystal.
[9624] <verse> Without exhaust, without increase, like crystal light.
[9625] <tantra> Make all thus spoken understood, well apply sign meaning.
[9626] <prose> Sign meaning of liberating deluded sentient beings:
[9627] <tantra> From Lamp Blaze:
[9628] <verse> Base itself, wisdom making fruit ripen.
[9629] <verse> By ripening in wisdom-body,
[9630] <verse> That essence-itself Dharmakaya || 9630 ||
[9631] <verse> Ripens in wisdom Dharmakaya.
[9632] <tantra> From thus speaking.
[9633] <prose> From heart center, wisdom three-stack lung wind and wisdom's two tones meeting,
[9634] <prose> Power becoming mind,
[9635] <prose> Example of abiding unmoving dissolving in base manner.
[9636] <prose> Example of white mind, interior light emanating outer.
[9637] <prose> Called sixth mind.
[9638] <prose> Example of five lights wisdom.
[9639] <prose> Awareness holding base.
[9640] <prose> That example introduction of mind and wisdom two is suitable. || 9640 ||
[9641] <prose> Intermediate introduction: sound, light, ray three,
[9642] <prose> And Vajra-Mind heart-interval nadi path introduction etc. appropriate all, produce certain knowing in crystal.
[9643] <prose> Yogin applying essence and knowing, making confidence, should be diligent in experience.
[9644] <ornament> Liberation manner as fruit:
[9645] <prose> Though above interior-clear primordially pure liberation base is clear as self-arise essence-itself body,
[9646] <prose> Called outer-clear,
[9647] <prose> Give introduction to mixing five lights and white two.
[9648] <prose> This has great essential point if wisdom exists.
[9649] <prose> Path wisdom or
[9650] <prose> Desiring wisdom without extremely not abiding middle, || 9650 ||
[9651] <prose> Or desiring wisdom without in our great perfect primordially pure,
[9652] <prose> Though delusion pure from root,
[9653] <prose> Arising without ceasing two bodies.
[9654] <prose> Wisdom must exist in space,
[9655] <prose> That mixing of five lights and white is mirror wisdom.
[9656] <prose> Example of white arising separately, Nirmanakaya emanating from Sambhogakaya.
[9657] <prose> Those are introduction of Buddha-hood as all-knowing in two-possessing purity.
[9658] <prose> Called "who superior passed from Buddha nirvāṇa":
[9659] <prose> Nirmanakaya and Sambhogakaya dissolving into Dharmakaya,
[9660] <prose> By being free from crystal sun's condition, || 9660 ||
[9661] <prose> Abiding undeluded having seized stable ground at beginning's primordially pure base,
[9662] <prose> Though liberated like that, essence not separate,
[9663] <prose> By distinction of aware and not-aware,
[9664] <prose> Called all-knowing: all abiding only in wisdom-body.
[9665] <prose> Mainly possessing two wisdoms.
[9666] <prose> Existing as interior-clear, that essence delivering to cease ground and first human's common-base self-arise essence-itself body are not separate.
[9667] <prose> However, like sun obscured by cloud,
[9668] <prose> From portion of realization becoming manifest by liberating from all obscurations, knowing self-essence like liberation,
[9669] <prose> Beginning base and
[9670] <prose> End liberation ground two—very great distinction. || 9670 ||
[9671] <prose> Great essential point.
[9672] <verse> Wisdom swirling in space like crystal light.
[9673] <verse> Dharmakaya arising clear-pure like crystal itself.
[9674] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[9675] <prose> That Dharmakaya of knowing self-essence, self itself abiding in self-bed,
[9676] <prose> If desiring to hold stable ground of undeluded Dharmakaya now also,
[9677] <break> <prose> Great essential point is keeping undistracted, clear, snap in manner of great open naked self-clear,
[9678] <break> <tantra> From glorious holy guru protector of beings' mouth:
[9679] <verse> Dharmakaya of knowing self-essence is self-bed itself,
[9680] <verse> All who desire to hold stable undeluded ground, || 9680 ||
[9681] <verse> Essential point is doing not-wrong, not-deluded, not-distracted,
[9682] <verse> Let wisdom-possessing know intention like ocean.
[9683] <tantra> Thus well spoken.
[9684] <prose> At time of all this introduction, relaxing freshly, self also producing uncommon new confidence, should demonstrate to others.
[9685] <break> <tantra> Also from World Sun Dharma-Lord Guru's mouth:
[9686] <break> <tantra> Should carefully give introductions in sequence.
[9687] <ornament> Ha-le!
[9688] <ornament> Ho-le!
[9689] <prose> Without portion of what exists.
[9690] <break> <prose> Not introduction. || 9690 ||
[9691] <break> <prose> Not introduced, do not.
[9692] <prose> Do not declare non-Dharma action.
[9693] <prose> Do not follow for delusion.
[9694] <prose> Do not do bad non-Dharma actions taking guru etc.'s name.
[9695] <tantra> Thus making instruction: need to make name and meaning together.
[9696] <prose> Respectfully place in mind thus all who have entered this Dharma in future times.
[9697] <ornament> Second meaning: extensively demonstrating mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction has two aspects:
[9698] <prose> Mind's introduction of delusion reversing manner from root awareness,
[9699] <prose> And self-appear wisdom's introduction of awareness with self-appear.

[9709] <list> Establishing secret space by inner mind's essential point,
[9710] <list> Establishing supreme awareness itself by secret space's essential point. || 9710 ||
[9711] <break> <prose> First, demonstrating deluded baseless appearance field,
[9712] <break> <prose> From two: demonstrating self-mind empty of appearance-holding.
