[29963] <prose> Through the example showing the three bodies and five wisdoms, the wisdom of Vajrasattva is clear.
[29964] <prose> Though there are many forms of showing examples, among examples, that which becomes supreme is called the precious crystal.
[29965] <prose> Through showing by means of the crystal, naturally completely pure, clear without outside or inside,
[29966] <prose> Recognize the dharmakāya. || 9540 ||
[29967] <prose> Relying on the inner light of the crystal,

[29974] <prose> Recognize the wisdom of all-knowing through outer clarity.
[29975] <prose> Recognize the wisdom of all-knowing through dissolving inside.

[29977] <prose> Recognize the manner of appearing.
[29978] <prose> Through showing the nature of the crystal itself, recognize the single abiding nature.
[29979] <prose> Through the crystal possessing its own light, recognize as Rigpa wisdom.
[29980] <prose> These also, when summarized from the definite aspect of showing examples:
[29981] <tantra> From the Tantra of Arranged Lamps:
[29982] <verse> Through intention signs and ear-continuum lineage,
[29983] <verse> The valid cognition of secret mantra meaning arises.
[29984] <verse> Relying on the example, recognize the meaning.
[29985] <verse> Relying on signs, confidence is born.
[29986] <verse> Through deciding the essence of meaning, || 9560 ||
[29987] <verse> The three wisdoms established in the ground,
[29988] <verse> Abiding in the manner of a seed,
[29989] <verse> Through prajñā arising from conditions,
[29990] <verse> Through ripening in the manner of fruit,
[29991] <verse> The darkness of non-recognition is cleared.
[29992] <verse> Through the self-purification of obstacles to the knowable,
[29993] <verse> The fruit not sought is seen by oneself.
[29994] <tantra> The meaning thus spoken should be introduced in sequence.
[29995] <prose> To that, first the general ground of self-arisen nature body
[29996] <prose> Should be introduced. || 9570 ||
[29997] <prose> In that, nature, nature, and compassion abide as three.
[29998] <prose> That single bindu possessing the essence of empty Rigpa,
[29999] <prose> The teacher holds a single clear mirror,
[30000] <prose> Shows the student,
[30001] <prose> And speaks these words:
[30002] <verse> "This mirror of Samantabhadra's clear appearance,
[30003] <verse> "Through appropriate examples, makes one recognize the nature.
[30004] <verse> "That meaning of recognition is the introduction to clear appearance.
[30005] <verse> "First, the introduction to Samantabhadra's abiding nature.
[30006] <verse> "rigpa abiding in direct penetration is like crystal. || 9580 ||
[30007] <verse> "rigpa, thought-free and clear, is like crystal.
[30008] <verse> "rigpa abiding in spontaneous presence is like crystal.
[30009] <verse> "rigpa, unceasing and direction-free, is like crystal."
[30010] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[30011] <prose> Though five lights are clear to outer eye,
[30012] <prose> Possessing nature of clear from within,
[30013] <prose> Nature:
[30014] <prose> White light also abides not separate from that, demonstrating compassion.
[30015] <prose> Though crystal essence demonstrates primordially pure and three,
[30016] <prose> By non-separation, understand through that example how single bindu meaning abides within. || 9590 ||
[30017] <prose> Then demonstrating delusion-base:
[30018] <prose> Extend crystal to sun-ray,
[30019] <prose> Demonstrate outer two interior lights,
[30020] <prose> Condition of cause: ignorance of one self-nature at time of base-appear arising from base.
[30021] <prose> Field possessing five colors,
[30022] <prose> Demonstrate mind searching all for that subtle white.
[30023] <prose> That beginning move arises together with light,
[30024] <prose> Arises as knowable's obscuration: co-arising ignorance.
[30025] <prose> By wisdom's sense-power transcending from All-Good base, separate distinction in one moment,
[30026] <prose> Complete Buddha in one moment, || 9600 ||
[30027] <prose> Is before Buddha as great-grandfather without common of all Buddhas.
[30028] <prose> By this liberation manner,
[30029] <prose> Should know all first Buddha's arising manner and arising manner.
[30030] <verse> First Buddha without cause,
[30031] <verse> Buddha without beginning or end,
[30032] <verse> One wisdom eye without stain.
[30033] <tantra> Thus spoken from Manjushri.
[30034] <prose> Demonstrating All-Good's liberation base.
[30035] <prose> Also, having known base-appear arising from base and liberating, speaks that immeasurable Buddhas not deluded in saṃsāra now also arise from space.
[30036] <prose> That base-appear, sentient beings not knowing as self-appear, || 9610 ||
[30037] <prose> Arises as affliction-obscuration of all-imagined ignorance.
[30038] <tantra> Thus,
[30039] <prose> Delusion various arises by awareness rise-sleep habit-continuum.
[30040] <prose> That also like placing hopes on various colored crystal cloth,
[30041] <prose> Or placing each white light on each white color etc.
[30042] <prose> There, awareness-wisdom and concept-collection net.
[30043] <prose> Entering body's interior,
[30044] <prose> Manner of four-holding awareness abiding in heart center,
[30045] <prose> Give introduction to manner pervading all sentient beings.
[30046] <prose> That is also introduction of nature's delusion manner. || 9620 ||
[30047] <verse> Delusion arising from condition like crystal light.
[30048] <verse> Various things appearing like crystal light.
[30049] <verse> Appearing yet essence unchanging like crystal.
[30050] <verse> Without exhaust, without increase, like crystal light.
[30051] <tantra> Make all thus spoken understood, well apply sign meaning.
[30052] <prose> Sign meaning of liberating deluded sentient beings:
[30053] <tantra> From Lamp Blaze:
[30054] <verse> Base itself, wisdom making fruit ripen.
[30055] <verse> By ripening in wisdom-body,
[30056] <verse> That essence-itself Dharmakaya || 9630 ||
[30057] <verse> Ripens in wisdom Dharmakaya.
[30058] <tantra> From thus speaking.
[30059] <prose> From heart center, wisdom three-stack lung wind and wisdom's two tones meeting,
[30060] <prose> Power becoming mind,
[30061] <prose> Example of abiding unmoving dissolving in base manner.
[30062] <prose> Example of white mind, interior light emanating outer.
[30063] <prose> Called sixth mind.
[30064] <prose> Example of five lights wisdom.
[30065] <prose> Awareness holding base.
[30066] <prose> That example introduction of mind and wisdom two is suitable. || 9640 ||
[30067] <prose> Intermediate introduction: sound, light, ray three,
[30068] <prose> And Vajra-Mind heart-interval nadi path introduction etc. appropriate all, produce certain knowing in crystal.
[30069] <prose> Yogin applying essence and knowing, making confidence, should be diligent in experience.
[30070] <ornament> Liberation manner as fruit:
[30071] <prose> Though above interior-clear primordially pure liberation base is clear as self-arise essence-itself body,
[30072] <prose> Called outer-clear,
[30073] <prose> Give introduction to mixing five lights and white two.
[30074] <prose> This has great essential point if wisdom exists.
[30075] <prose> Path wisdom or
[30076] <prose> Desiring wisdom without extremely not abiding middle, || 9650 ||
[30077] <prose> Or desiring wisdom without in our great perfect primordially pure,
[30078] <prose> Though delusion pure from root,
[30079] <prose> Arising without ceasing two bodies.
[30080] <prose> Wisdom must exist in space,
[30081] <prose> That mixing of five lights and white is mirror wisdom.
[30082] <prose> Example of white arising separately, Nirmanakaya emanating from Sambhogakaya.
[30083] <prose> Those are introduction of Buddha-hood as all-knowing in two-possessing purity.
[30084] <prose> Called "who superior passed from Buddha nirvāṇa":
[30085] <prose> Nirmanakaya and Sambhogakaya dissolving into Dharmakaya,
[30086] <prose> By being free from crystal sun's condition, || 9660 ||
[30087] <prose> Abiding undeluded having seized stable ground at beginning's primordially pure base,
[30088] <prose> Though liberated like that, essence not separate,
[30089] <prose> By distinction of aware and not-aware,
[30090] <prose> Called all-knowing: all abiding only in wisdom-body.
[30091] <prose> Mainly possessing two wisdoms.
[30092] <prose> Existing as interior-clear, that essence delivering to cease ground and first human's common-base self-arise essence-itself body are not separate.
[30093] <prose> However, like sun obscured by cloud,
[30094] <prose> From portion of realization becoming manifest by liberating from all obscurations, knowing self-essence like liberation,
[30095] <prose> Beginning base and
[30096] <prose> End liberation ground two—very great distinction. || 9670 ||
[30097] <prose> Great essential point.
[30098] <verse> Wisdom swirling in space like crystal light.
[30099] <verse> Dharmakaya arising clear-pure like crystal itself.
[30100] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[30101] <prose> That Dharmakaya of knowing self-essence, self itself abiding in self-bed,
[30102] <prose> If desiring to hold stable ground of undeluded Dharmakaya now also,
[30103] <break> <prose> Great essential point is keeping undistracted, clear, snap in manner of great open naked self-clear,
[30104] <break> <tantra> From glorious holy guru protector of beings' mouth:
[30105] <verse> Dharmakaya of knowing self-essence is self-bed itself,
[30106] <verse> All who desire to hold stable undeluded ground, || 9680 ||
[30107] <verse> Essential point is doing not-wrong, not-deluded, not-distracted,
[30108] <verse> Let wisdom-possessing know intention like ocean.
[30109] <tantra> Thus well spoken.
[30110] <prose> At time of all this introduction, relaxing freshly, self also producing uncommon new confidence, should demonstrate to others.
[30111] <break> <tantra> Also from World Sun Dharma-Lord Guru's mouth:
[30112] <break> <tantra> Should carefully give introductions in sequence.
[30113] <ornament> Ha-le!

[30122] <prose> Respectfully place in mind thus all who have entered this Dharma in future times.
[30123] <ornament> Second meaning: extensively demonstrating mind and wisdom's indicative examples through determining that distinction has two aspects:
[30124] <prose> Mind's introduction of delusion reversing manner from root awareness,
[30125] <prose> And self-appear wisdom's introduction of awareness with self-appear.
[30126] <ornament> First: || 9700 ||

[30135] <list> Establishing secret space by inner mind's essential point,
[30136] <list> Establishing supreme awareness itself by secret space's essential point. || 9710 ||
[30137] <break> <prose> First, demonstrating deluded baseless appearance field,
[30138] <break> <prose> From two: demonstrating self-mind empty of appearance-holding.
