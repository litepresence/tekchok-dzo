[33730] <prose> First, the first of the five outer elements dissolves:
[33731] <prose> The five inner earth elements dissolve into the five outer earth elements, whereby the body's power is lost and memory declines.
[33732] <break> <prose> The five water elements dissolve into water, whereby the body's fluids drip, and in that silk-like moment the mouth and nose become dry while the eyes roll upward.
[33733] <break> <prose> The five fire elements dissolve into fire, whereby the body's heat rises, memory ceases, and the lamp is no longer seen.
[33734] <prose> The five wind elements dissolve into wind, whereby the body's luster fades and breath becomes rough, ceasing in that silk-like moment.
[33735] <prose> Then the manner of the inner elements dissolving is thus:
[33736] <prose> The five space elements dissolve into the sphere of awareness; at that time, the face is grasped. || 13310 ||
[33737] <prose> Then, the manner of the extremely clear five inner elements dissolving into the five secret elements:
[33738] <prose> The subtle aspect of the five elements dissolves into the life-force,
[33739] <prose> And the five life-forces enter into the awareness at the heart center:
[33740] <prose> The light-channel and
[33741] <prose> The hollow space within it and
[33742] <prose> The bindu and
[33743] <prose> The five lights—one's own body as awareness possessing the mansion of light—dissolve.
[33744] <prose> Then, those five secret elements first abiding as the life-wind, the great perfectly complete elements, the ground-appear as self-resounding awareness, the heart-center possessing self-nature as light-power, awareness possessing the mansion of light,
[33745] <prose> Possessing objects of limitless light,
[33746] <prose> Dissolve together with the appearance of the four lamps, || 13320 ||
[33747] <prose> The Dharmakāya bardo self-resounding outwardly clear appearing aspect alone is made,
[33748] <prose> Outer and inner dharmas impure, separated from the aspect of saṃsāra,
[33749] <prose> Awareness reverts from the ground,
[33750] <prose> Arriving at the original primordially pure self-sphere.
[33751] <prose> Special among these: at the time of the inner elements dissolving into the outer elements,
[33752] <prose> When earth dissolves into earth: the power of emptiness emerges, wisdom latent.
[33753] <prose> The clear wisdom latent in the power of awareness, wisdom unable to appear as the Path.
[33754] <prose> When water dissolves into water: wisdom moistens, latent in the state of awareness, water flows from mouth and nose.
[33755] <prose> Wherein, that also, awareness wisdom clear and dim not, although power unable to appear outwardly, awareness latent.
[33756] <prose> When fire dissolves into fire: although primordially self-awareness abides as the essence of wisdom, || 13330 ||
[33757] <prose> At that time, wind enters inward, power unable to appear outwardly.
[33758] <prose> When wind dissolves into wind: awareness power complete, not abiding in objects.
[33759] <prose> When the body's power is lost: because wisdom qualities are latent.
[33760] <prose> Moreover, when space dissolves into space, awareness dissolves into the bardo: the time of wisdom grasping its own ground.
[33761] <prose> Self-appear awareness to appearance,
[33762] <prose> Free from binding with lump and binding-agent, because near.
[33763] <prose> That body, inner ground-appear spontaneous aspect, at that time this is called the bardo.
[33764] <prose> The five elements dissolve where the lump with binding-agent,
[33765] <prose> And awareness abiding in its own clear self-ground, because it is the interval.
[33766] <prose> Therefore, when abiding in the body, relying on the heart's inner power, that Dharma-nature self-resounding, arises from the path of the eye from the body, emerging. || 13340 ||
[33767] <prose> Although called by the symbol "Dharmakāya bardo,"
[33768] <prose> Together with awareness self-resounding, from other arises nothing at all, and
[33769] <prose> That same inner dissolving-setting time, primordially pure self-ground grasping alone, from other does not exist.
[33770] <prose> These inner elements are slightly difficult: explained separately.
[33771] <prose> The remainder scripture itself knows, — therefore here not explained separately.
[33772] <prose> That also,
[33773] <tantra> From Awareness Self-Arisen:
[33774] <prose> Ho! Friends, beings, great cavity transference:
[33775] <prose> Outer elements dissolve into inner elements,
[33776] <prose> Inner elements dissolve into secret elements, || 13350 ||
[33777] <prose> Secret elements dissolve into perfectly complete elements, entering the great Path; at that time, know thus.
[33778] <prose> Then, as signs of the inner five elements dissolving outward, know thus:
[33779] <prose> Earth dissolves into earth,
[33780] <prose> Water dissolves into water,
[33781] <prose> Fire dissolves into fire,
[33782] <prose> Wind dissolves into wind,
[33783] <prose> Space dissolves into space.
[33784] <prose> That also, earth dissolving into earth has two aspects:
[33785] <prose> Outer earth dissolving into inner earth, and
[33786] <prose> Inner earth dissolving into outer earth. || 13360 ||
[33787] <prose> The time of outer earth dissolving into inner earth is:
[33788] <prose> The first time.
[33789] <break> <prose> The inner five elements dissolving outward
[33790] <break> <prose> Time is: inner earth dissolving into outer earth sign, the body's power is lost.
[33791] <prose> That also is thus:
[33792] <prose> The sign of earth dissolving where all appears: outer consciousness dulls.
[33793] <prose> The sign of unchanging vajra earth dissolving: the body's power is lost.
[33794] <prose> The sign of all-arising precious earth dissolving: declining in capacity, unable to rise.
[33795] <prose> The sign of appearance-revealing Samantabhadra earth dissolving: losing perfectly complete power, intention unclear.
[33796] <break> <prose> The sign of accomplishment-completing earth dissolving: the lamp's appearance ceases. || 13370 ||
[33797] <break> <prose> The sign of inner water dissolving into outer water: water unable to be held.
[33798] <prose> That also is thus:
[33799] <break> <prose> The sign of unchanging water dissolving: water dripping from mouth and nose.
[33800] <break> <prose> Thus, the sign of peaceful clear pure water dissolving: unable to hold water from the secret place.
[33801] <prose> The sign of quality-arising spreading water dissolving: eyes rolling upward.
[33802] <prose> The sign of attachment-free water dissolving: mouth and nose dry.
[33803] <prose> The sign of grasping-free perfectly complete water dissolving: ears unable to hear sound.
[33804] <prose> The sign of inner fire dissolving into outer fire: the body's heat is lost.
[33805] <prose> That also, know thus:
[33806] <prose> The sign of all-pervading outer-inner fire dissolving: inner heat lost, consciousness unclear. || 13380 ||
[33807] <prose> The sign of outer-inner equal fire dissolving: secret heat lost.
[33808] <prose> The sign of outer-inner activity realizing fire dissolving:
[33809] <prose> Perfectly complete heat lost.
[33810] <prose> The sign of outer-inner activity accomplishing fire dissolving: the empty lamp is not seen.
[33811] <prose> The sign of inner wind dissolving into outer wind: the body's power is lost.
[33812] <prose> That also, know thus:
[33813] <prose> The sign of luster-and-radiance-generating wind dissolving: body's luster lost.
[33814] <prose> The sign of fire-equal abiding wind dissolving: water dripping from the body.
[33815] <prose> The sign of life-holding wind dissolving: breath unable to be held.
[33816] <prose> The sign of all-pervading wind dissolving: body's luster and memory lost. || 13390 ||
[33817] <prose> The sign of compassion-free karma wind dissolving: outer breath ceases.
[33818] <prose> That is called the outer element.
[33819] <prose> Space dissolving into space:
[33820] <prose> The space pervading all universally dissolves into the pure lamp.
[33821] <prose> The objectless clear space dissolves into awareness.
[33822] <prose> The unmixed pure space dissolves into the Expanse.
[33823] <prose> The meaning-indicating space dissolves into Prajña.
[33824] <prose> The space liberating into the pure realm dissolves into the twenty-one meanings.
[33825] <prose> That is called the inner element.
[33826] <prose> The root-holding life dissolves into the bindu. || 13400 ||
[33827] <prose> The protecting life coalesces into space.
[33828] <prose> The extremely subtle life coalesces into the body.
[33829] <prose> The impure life dissolves into space.
[33830] <prose> The vibratory life dissolves into the Expanse.
[33831] <prose> That is called the secret element.
[33832] <prose> The pure-impure distinguishing wind dissolves into the sphere.
[33833] <prose> The heat-generating wind dissolves into light.
[33834] <prose> The clarifying-transforming wind dissolves into Sku.
[33835] <prose> The settling wind dissolves into Ye-shes.
[33836] <prose> The exhorting wind dissolves into compassion. || 13410 ||
[33837] <prose> The consciousness-moving wind dissolves into emptiness.
[33838] <prose> The mind-releasing wind dissolves into non-dual.
[33839] <prose> The radiance-possessing wind dissolves into limit-free.
[33840] <prose> The burning wind dissolves into great bliss.
[33841] <prose> The agitated wind dissolves into clarity.
[33842] <prose> The ground-pervading wind dissolves into space-clarity.
[33843] <prose> The instant-pervading wind dissolves into depth-clarity.
[33844] <prose> The terrifying-pervading wind dissolves into objects.
[33845] <prose> The memory-pervading wind dissolves into the bardo.
[33846] <prose> The grasping body-all-pervading wind dissolves into self-appear. || 13420 ||
[33847] <prose> The moving wind moves awareness in space.
[33848] <prose> The liberating wind separates from outer-inner dharmas.
[33849] <prose> The reversing wind reverses self-awareness into the ground.
[33850] <prose> The hastening wind sees the object of awareness.
[33851] <prose> The instantaneous wind brings one to the place of primordial purity in three instants.
[33852] <prose> That is the perfectly complete element.
[33853] <prose> Those persons not under the power of conditions thus engage the life-force.
[33854] <prose> Those not thus engaging the life-force:
[33855] <prose> Are called the transference method of Bodhisattvas,
[33856] <prose> Reborn possessing bliss in the birth realm. || 13430 ||
[33857] <prose> To those exhausted of karma, not thus, know thus, it is taught.
[33858] <prose> Thus, through twenty-five winds, the five elements dissolve into the Expanse,
[33859] <prose> saṃsāra and nirvāṇa liberated,
[33860] <prose> Performing the action of liberating nirvāṇa into primordial purity,
[33861] <prose> By what is called "wind," all actions are performed—
[33862] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[33863] <prose> These are great essential points to be known.
[33864] <prose> These are called the bardo of death.
[33865] <prose> Moreover, third topic: extensive explanation of the Dharmakāya bardo instructions on trusting self-appear, meeting previous acquaintances, or entering the lap, in three parts:
[33866] <list> First: demonstrating abandonment through the manner of awareness dissolving into luminosity, || 13440 ||
[33867] <list> Second: extensive explanation through the manner of luminosity self-appear arising,
[33868] <list> Third: summary of meaning through the manner of self-appear sense-power liberation.
[33869] <ornament> First:
[33870] <prose> The five winds dissolving into the Expanse,
[33871] <prose> The heart center's three-tiered ye-shes sound entering the throat separated from the horse, power dissolving into self, mind and mind-originated all-basis together with saṃsāra's dharmas all latent,
[33872] <prose> At that time when saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's back is turned, awareness, white silk from the channel-path, emerges from the water-lamp into the pure space of the Expanse, arising as self-appear,
[33873] <tantra> From first liberation until completion through eight dissolution manners:
[33874] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[33875] <prose> To truth-seeing beings, know thus:
[33876] <prose> Sons of family, at the time of passing beyond sorrow, || 13450 ||
[33877] <prose> The body's pair lost, ye-shes appearance rising from the ground,
[33878] <prose> Ye-shes moving in space,
[33879] <prose> Awareness emerging from the path of the eye, moving in space,
[33880] <prose> That also, know thus:
[33881] <tantra> From the center of the heart, awareness dissolves into the bindu,
[33882] <prose> Bindu dissolves into lamp,
[33883] <prose> Lamp dissolves into light,
[33884] <prose> Light dissolves into Sku,
[33885] <prose> Sku dissolves into sphere,
[33886] <prose> Sphere dissolves into four ye-shes, || 13460 ||
[33887] <prose> Ye-shes dissolves into spontaneous presence,
[33888] <prose> Spontaneous presence dissolves into great primordial purity, grasping the ground.
[33889] <prose> Thus appears the liberation manner and dissolution manner of truth-seeing persons.
[33890] <prose> Consequently, that also, these pure ye-shes appearances do not appear to those who, in an instant from the body, transmigrate to existence and other grounds,
[33891] <prose> To others, although briefly appearing, duration short, like a swift dream, without essence, fading away, unrecognized.
[33892] <prose> Even for truth-seeing ones, if accustomed to direct perception, appearance duration long, having only the abundance of liberation-appearance,
[33893] <prose> Although directly seen, if not particularly cultivated in that, that state's realm portion without that capacity, like a shooting star, completing in but a moment, as taught,
[33894] <prose> Therefore, now, familiarity with thogel concentration is essential.
[33895] <tantra> From Sun Moon Union:
[33896] <prose> Possessing the essence of empty clarity, || 13470 ||
[33897] <prose> Possessing the essence of clear awareness,
[33898] <prose> Possessing the mansion of awareness light,
[33899] <prose> Familiarity with the four lamps is essential.
[33900] <prose> Thus.
[33901] <prose> Second, extensive explanation of luminosity self-appear arising manner in five parts:
[33902] <list> First: ground-appear luminosity appearance,
[33903] <list> Second: union sphere appearance,
[33904] <list> Third: four ye-shes joining appearance,
[33905] <list> Fourth: precious spontaneous presence appearance,
[33906] <list> Extensive explanation of essential pith instructions liberating into those. || 13480 ||
[33907] <ornament> First:
[33908] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[33909] <prose> Here the Dharmakāya bardo is explained.
[33910] <tantra> From death, at the time of falling,
[33911] <prose> Consciousness dissolves into pure space,
[33912] <prose> When space dissolves into luminosity,
[33913] <prose> All subtle and coarse appearances cease,
[33914] <prose> The light-body possessing all senses,
[33915] <prose> Transforms according to karma and latent tendencies.
[33916] <prose> At this time, at the time of light-appearance fragments, || 13490 ||
[33917] <prose> The wise grasp the spreading appearance,
[33918] <prose> Moving with wind, spreading,
[33919] <prose> Five-by-five colored lights and rays,
[33920] <prose> Uncertain, appearing as rainbow patterns.
[33921] <prose> Thus,
[33922] <prose> Awareness not abiding, emerging, appearing in space,
[33923] <prose> Within the expanse of awareness, five ye-shes winds existing, spreading, luminosity appearance appearing as rainbow patterns, filling space,
[33924] <prose> Five ye-shes individually clear, unmixed self-resoundings,
[33925] <break> <prose> Consequently, mirror-like ye-shes, primordially pure of stain, self-resounding white clearly appearing, also not mixed with the other four, clear in its own place:
[33926] <break> <prose> At the bardo time, in the eastern direction, by oneself— || 13500 ||
[33927] <prose> At the time of capacity, one's own forward direction is one's own place,
[33928] <tantra> From that, rays self-pure and
[33929] <prose> Intertwined and
[33930] <prose> Direct and
[33931] <prose> Spreading like sun-rays from the eastern direction, and
[33932] <prose> The entity of equality ye-shes, spontaneous presence qualities complete without ceasing, yellow self-resounding,
[33933] <prose> At the bardo time, clear in the southern self-place, rays as above spreading, and
[33934] <prose> At the time of appearance increase, all those forward self-places,
[33935] <prose> Discriminating ye-shes, four powers arising without ceasing,
[33936] <prose> Red self-resounding from which rays as above spread, and || 13510 ||
[33937] <prose> Accomplishing-action ye-shes, activity power primordially complete, green self-resounding,
[33938] <tantra> From the northern self-place, rays as above spread, and
[33939] <prose> Dharmadhatu ye-shes, spontaneously accomplished Dharmakāya primordially complete, deep-blue self-resounding,
[33940] <tantra> From the central self-place, rays as above spread.
[33941] <prose> At the time of capacity, all from forward self-place arising, appearance spreading,
[33942] <tantra> From that, right, left, back, and above-below two, know.
[33943] <prose> Those five ye-shes self-resoundings also arise as the distinctive five Skus,
[33944] <tantra> From those Skus, ye-shes light-rays spreading, one from another four finger-widths apart, not touching, white and
[33945] <prose> Yellow and
[33946] <prose> Red and || 13520 ||
[33947] <prose> Green and
[33948] <prose> Deep-blue nature brilliantly shining, spreading in the ten directions:
[33949] <prose> Root subtle, tips vast, spontaneously thick, all appearances
[33950] <prose> Subtle and
[33951] <prose> Moving and
[33952] <prose> Trembling and
[33953] <prose> Flickering and
[33954] <prose> Shining,
[33955] <prose> The five lights' Expanse extremely vast, limitless, immeasurable, inconceivable,
[33956] <prose> Height high, tips vast, as the source of all mandalas, self-appear. || 13530 ||
[33957] <prose> When seeing this appearance,
[33958] <prose> Consciousness abiding in natural absorption,
[33959] <prose> The essential pith instruction of recognizing spreading appearance as self-appear is supreme, and one should abide in that state.
[33960] <prose> If recognized here, liberated in three instants to the place of primordial purity:
[33961] <prose> First instant: recognition,
[33962] <prose> Second instant: liberation upon recognition,
[33963] <prose> Third instant: liberated, dissolving into primordial purity, after that no appearance whatsoever.
[33964] <prose> Those also, if scripture elaborates, beautiful to the wise,
[33965] <prose> And explained to open the eye of intelligence for the foolish.
[33966] <break> <tantra> From Sun Moon Union: || 13540 ||
[33967] <prose> Hey! Great thought-free Sage, listen!
[33968] <break> <prose> Naturally pure appearance is thus:
[33969] <prose> The consciousness of beings dissolving into luminosity is called
[33970] <prose> Breath outer-inner travel severed immediately,
[33971] <prose> One's own senses
[33972] <tantra> From portion appearing as thing, the consciousness thinking "fire exists" arises.
[33973] <prose> This body of lump-with-binding-agent not appearing,
[33974] <prose> Clearly as the light-body.
[33975] <prose> At that time, as much as becoming the sphere of sense activity,
[33976] <prose> Appearing as the mandala of five light-rays. || 13550 ||
[33977] <prose> That also, those appearances, seen from outside, inside clear; seen from inside, outside clear.
[33978] <prose> Without outer-inner, all-pervading transparent,
[33979] <prose> Like a mirage,
[33980] <prose> Like fire,
[33981] <prose> Pressed, seeming to sink,
[33982] <prose> Lifted, seeming to leap,
[33983] <prose> Extremely captivating,
[33984] <prose> Clearly as colors, self-clear without individual mixing,
[33985] <prose> Equal portion, clarity portion not ceasing,
[33986] <prose> Truly seen, extremely subtle and || 13560 ||
[33987] <prose> Moving and
[33988] <prose> Trembling like and
[33989] <prose> Flickering like and
[33990] <prose> Brilliantly shining, majestically spontaneous.
[33991] <prose> Extremely vast,
[33992] <prose> Without reckoning or object not entered,
[33993] <prose> Height high, tips vast, thus called,
[33994] <prose> Abiding as the source of all mandalas.
[33995] <prose> That also, colors are five:
[33996] <prose> White clear in self-place, rays spreading, and || 13570 ||
[33997] <prose> Likewise yellow clear in self-place, rays spreading, and
[33998] <break> <prose> Red clear in self-place, rays spreading, and
[33999] <break> <prose> Green itself clear in self-place, rays spreading, and
[34000] <prose> Likewise deep-blue itself clear in self-place, rays spreading,
[34001] <prose> Those also, not touching in contact, individually self-clear as colors,
[34002] <prose> Extremely spontaneously thick abiding, thus taught.
[34003] <prose> Some persons not delighting in scripture are known as foolish, without intelligence.
[34004] <prose> The wise are especially made by scripture.
[34005] <prose> Second, extensive explanation of union sphere appearance:
[34006] <tantra> From Thalgyur: || 13580 ||
[34007] <tantra> From entering and maturing wind,
[34008] <prose> Four directions, directions, above-below accomplished.
[34009] <prose> There, gathered directional light,
[34010] <prose> Five families Sku also clearly appear.
[34011] <prose> Deep-blue, white, yellow, red, green,
[34012] <prose> Appearing together with individual consorts.
[34013] <prose> If spreading and grasping known in this,
[34014] <prose> The qualities of the Buddhas complete,
[34015] <prose> Not entering the three realms.
[34016] <prose> That characteristic thus: || 13590 ||
[34017] <prose> Coarse elements free from dependency,
[34018] <tantra> From light, bindu-pair blazing,
[34019] <prose> Five bindus connected, Skus filling,
[34020] <tantra> From half-Sku, forms complete.
[34021] <tantra> From form-half-Sku, five-by-five pairs,
[34022] <prose> Individual spheres complete,
[34023] <prose> Five-possessing, ten-possessing, hundred-possessing,
[34024] <prose> Spheres thousand, hundred-thousand,
[34025] <prose> Naturally pure in thought-scope,
[34026] <prose> Inexpressible, numberless. || 13600 ||
[34027] <prose> If self and other known in this,
[34028] <prose> Obtaining the Three Skus condensed as one,
[34029] <tantra> From this obtaining, no turning back.
[34030] <prose> Arisen from clarity-bestowal.
[34031] <prose> Thus,
[34032] <prose> In this, cause from what spreading,
[34033] <tantra> From bindu, sphere appearance, essential pith instruction of non-reversal, demonstrated in three parts:
[34034] <prose> The cause is the former ye-shes wind entering objects, by that power, that same luminosity appearance here spreading as union sphere appearance.
[34035] <prose> The meaning of union: that awareness self-light spontaneously spreading, and
[34036] <prose> Dharmakāya mother's five luminosities, Sambhogakāya realm-appearance primordially existing as path-appearance, two meeting at the time at awareness's face, recognition, inseparably entering as one. || 13610 ||
[34037] <prose> At that time, released from the binding of all-basis appropriation,
[34038] <prose> Dharmakāya eye seeing Dharmakāya appearance as self-system, entering that, and
[34039] <prose> Sambhogakāya ye-shes eye seeing awareness-son appearance, self-face inseparably entering, and
[34040] <prose> Former cultivated Prajña arising there, Prajña eye joining those two inseparably,
[34041] <prose> Mother-son inseparably abiding, ye-shes union dissolving, thus called.
