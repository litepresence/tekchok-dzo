[24026] <prose> First, the seven verbal views held by individual intellectual analysis: || 3600 ||
[24027] <prose> The view of action-free primordial liberation,
[24028] <prose> The view of effort-free primordial liberation,
[24029] <prose> The view distinguished as progressive stages of mind leading upward,
[24030] <prose> The view transcending virtue and vice,
[24031] <prose> The view of great non-doing and non-arising,
[24032] <prose> The view of great unmodified self-purity, and
[24033] <prose> The view of great self-arisen self-liberation—these seven.
[24034] <prose> The view of meaning is the view of vidya in its own immediacy.
[24035] <prose> Regarding this:
[24036] <tantra> From the same source: || 3610 ||
[24037] <verse> Regarding that, views are of two types:
[24038] <verse> Verbal view and view of meaning.
[24039] <verse> From the sequence of seven verbal views,
[24040] <verse> Individual mental preferences are made:
[24041] <verse> Action-free, without effort,
[24042] <verse> Progressive distinction of self and other,
[24043] <verse> Free from killing, virtue and vice,
[24044] <verse> Without doing, without ground of arising,
[24045] <verse> Unmodified, appearances self-pure,
[24046] <verse> Afflictions self-placed, liberated. || 3620 ||
[24047] <verse> Meaning is the direct dharmatā,
[24048] <verse> Not by prajñā,
[24049] <verse> Viewed as the very domain of sense-powers.
[24050] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24051] <prose> Verbal views are the summary of general mind-vast Great Perfection views.
[24052] <prose> Second, the enumerated views are the nine individual progressive views.
[24053] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[24054] <prose> Enumerations of expressed words and names:
[24055] <prose> Outer, inner, secret,
[24056] <verse> And unsurpassed view—these four. || 3630 ||
[24057] <verse> Outer is view of phenomena,
[24058] <verse> Eight progressive mental preferences,
[24059] <verse> Held as intellectual apprehension.
[24060] <verse> Viewing inner dharmatā,
[24061] <verse> Essence and nature seen as illusory.
[24062] <verse> Viewing secret self-awareness,
[24063] <break> <verse> Seeing linked-chain connection.
[24064] <break> <verse> Suchness goes to expanse-vidya.
[24065] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24066] <prose> Third, regarding the view of nature: the view of abiding is that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are primordially liberated; || 3640 ||
[24067] <prose> The view of pure-seeing transcends cause, effect, action, and effort;
[24068] <prose> The view of nature is that appearance-existence is primordially liberated appearance;
[24069] <prose> The view without fabrication is the great vastness of liberation from extremes.
[24070] <prose> Regarding this:
[24071] <verse> Moreover, dharmatā wheel is explained.
[24072] <verse> The view of abiding realizes all dharmas,
[24073] <verse> Nature pure, dividing saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
[24074] <verse> Without doing, losing arising.
[24075] <verse> Authentic path pervaded by emptiness,
[24076] <verse> Great emptiness of complete arising, || 3650 ||
[24077] <verse> Complete without action, without arising,
[24078] <verse> Saṃsāra pure, transcended.
[24079] <verse> Moreover, the view of pure-seeing:
[24080] <verse> Phenomena non-existent, great self-pure completeness,
[24081] <verse> No need for deity worship,
[24082] <verse> No mantra recitation, no austerity,
[24083] <verse> What are incense, lamps, deity offerings?
[24084] <verse> No accumulation, no torma offering,
[24085] <verse> No giving, no fire offering, no worshipper.
[24086] <verse> Six pāramitās without extremes, || 3660 ||
[24087] <verse> Thus no ground-root whatsoever.
[24088] <verse> Killing, stealing, sexual misconduct,
[24089] <verse> Without view, without meditation, without conduct.
[24090] <verse> Without seeing, without examination—what is meditation desire?
[24091] <verse> What is mind's desire for emptiness and clarity?
[24092] <verse> Likewise, dharmas and Buddha are without dharmas.
[24093] <prose> Moreover, explaining the view of nature:
[24094] <verse> Earth, water, fire, wind elements manifest Buddha,
[24095] <verse> Unfabricated, great self-liberation itself.
[24096] <verse> Desire, hatred, delusion are the ground of enlightenment, || 3670 ||
[24097] <verse> Confidence in realizing thought-action conduct.
[24098] <verse> Saṃsāra not abandoned is Buddha's intention,
[24099] <verse> Body, speech, and mind complete the three bodies.
[24100] <verse> Mind and ignorance-delusion are dharmatā-ground,
[24101] <verse> Action imprints and fixation clinging are view-essence.
[24102] <prose> Moreover, the view without fabrication:
[24103] <verse> Buddha who has not arisen from dharmas,
[24104] <verse> Fruition complete, not produced by causes,
[24105] <verse> Taking body, not destroyed by conditions.
[24106] <verse> Six extremes not arisen from scriptures, || 3680 ||
[24107] <verse> Not relying on tantras, by oral instructions,
[24108] <verse> Cutting the root of nirvāṇa,
[24109] <verse> Ripening the fruition of saṃsāra.
[24110] <verse> Unauthentic, impure ground,
[24111] <verse> Six afflictions without ground,
[24112] <verse> Emptying the seed of enlightenment,
[24113] <verse> Ripening the forms of three lower realms,
[24114] <verse> The three bodies also hand-taken.
[24115] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24116] <prose> Finally, this is the view of self-knowing spontaneous Great Perfection, || 3690 ||
[24117] <prose> Definitively establishing the view of the nature of liberation-delusion duality.
[24118] <prose> It is renowned as the view of expression-objects.
[24119] <prose> Third, the ground-juncture:
[24120] <prose> The general ground-juncture of view connects to one's own realization, entering the expanse in due time,
[24121] <prose> Particularly, at the time of the word-meaning view ground-juncture, through intellectual analysis,
[24122] <prose> Transcending that, distinguished.
[24123] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[24124] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[24125] <prose> The ground-juncture of word-meaning view:
[24126] <prose> Words are the cause of expression. || 3700 ||
[24127] <verse> That which expresses and emanates,
[24128] <verse> From that, intellect contemplates.
[24129] <verse> Three pure direct measures,
[24130] <verse> Engaging linked-chain directly.
[24131] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24132] <prose> Second, recognizing one's own view:
[24133] <prose> The view of Great Perfection action-free spontaneous perfection,
[24134] <prose> Divided, there are three.
