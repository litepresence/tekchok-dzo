[22180] <ornament> Now, regarding the explanation of the progressive manner of taking experience through the definite path:
[22181] <prose> Those with object-mind enter definitely through the supreme method that leads above, and
[22182] <prose> Those with the mind of rigpa's self-appearance take direct experience through the well-said pith instructions that are definite, traversing in this very life to the great liberation city through the secret supreme method.
[22183] <prose> The common approach: from the progressive entry of the definite mind, it is shown beginning with
[22184] <prose> The meaning of the first ground, in which there are three kinds of ties:
[22185] <prose> Who performs the experience-taking: the distinction of the yogin, and
[22186] <prose> How the experience-taking manner is made definite, and || 1760 ||
[22187] <prose> The actual meaning of experience-taking is shown.
[22188] <prose> First, among these three:
[22189] <prose> The common distinction,
[22190] <prose> The explanation of individual meanings,
[22191] <prose> The definite supreme place.
[22192] <ornament> First:
[22193] <tantra> From the Rang-shar:
[22194] <tantra> Kye kye! Close assembly, listen!
[22195] <tantra> The characteristic word yogin, and
[22196] <tantra> The sign-mere-holding yogin, and || 1770 ||
[22197] <tantra> The following yogin itself, and
[22198] <tantra> The nature-definite yogin, and
[22199] <tantra> The appearance-mind yogin, and
[22200] <tantra> The enter-action yogin, and
[22201] <tantra> The action-cause yogin, and
[22202] <tantra> The doer-condition yogin, and
[22203] <tantra> The end-arrive-fruit yogin, and
[22204] <tantra> The authentic-meaning yogin, and
[22205] <tantra> The end-arrive-liberation yogin, and
[22206] <tantra> The done-complete yogin. || 1780 ||
[22207] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[22208] <ornament> Second: Regarding the explanation of individual meanings, from among the twelve yogins,
[22209] <prose> The first eight do not liberate, and
[22210] <prose> The manner of liberation of the later four is definitely shown.
[22211] <prose> Also from that itself:
[22212] <tantra> The characteristic word yogin:
[22213] <tantra> Attachs to words and engages with words,
[22214] <tantra> Relying upon not-knowing words.
[22215] <tantra> I do not speak that itself as liberated.
[22216] <tantra> The sign-relying yogin: || 1790 ||
[22217] <tantra> From relying upon signs of self itself,
[22218] <tantra> Doing conduct that flatters others,
[22219] <tantra> Binding self with thoughts of self.
[22220] <tantra> I do not speak that also as liberated.
[22221] <tantra> The following-enter yogin:
[22222] <tantra> Dwells in whatever ground of faith,
[22223] <tantra> Doing conduct of faith,
[22224] <break> <tantra> Placing hope in the first ground.
[22225] <break> <prose> I do not speak that itself as liberated.
[22226] <tantra> The nature-definite yogin: || 1800 ||
[22227] <tantra> Meditates one-pointedly, variously not-thinking,
[22228] <tantra> Possesses the nature of not-thinking.
[22229] <tantra> I do not speak that also as liberated.
[22230] <tantra> The appearance-mind yogin:
[22231] <tantra> All arisen from my mind,
[22232] <tantra> Realizing mind-itself, what is there to do?
[22233] <tantra> Thus expressing all,
[22234] <tantra> I do not speak as liberated.
[22235] <tantra> The enter-action yogin:
[22236] <tantra> Regards accomplishing the action of meaning itself, || 1810 ||
[22237] <tantra> Those bound by great action,
[22238] <tantra> Do action-generating the first mind,
[22239] <tantra> From that grasping action all,
[22240] <tantra> Accomplishing all doing.
[22241] <tantra> I do not speak that also as liberated.
[22242] <tantra> The action-cause yogin:
[22243] <tantra> Raises the path of tantra itself,
[22244] <tantra> Hoping in cause, relying upon cause,
[22245] <tantra> Manifestly showing cause itself.
[22246] <tantra> I do not speak that also as liberated. || 1820 ||
[22247] <tantra> The doer-condition yogin:
[22248] <tantra> Seeks authentic meaning through conduct,
[22249] <tantra> Holds the not-same side of caste,
[22250] <tantra> I do not speak that also as liberated.
[22251] <tantra> The end-arrive-fruit yogin:
[22252] <tantra> Carries the path of realization,
[22253] <tantra> Does not dwell in ground-path,
[22254] <tantra> From seeing self that-ness,
[22255] <tantra> Is regarded as great authentic liberation.
[22256] <tantra> The authentic meaning yogin: || 1830 ||
[22257] <tantra> Also obtains self-realization,
[22258] <tantra> In pure bardo-appearance,
[22259] <tantra> From seeing authentic self,
[22260] <tantra> Is regarded as end-arrive liberated.
[22261] <tantra> The end-arrive liberation yogin:
[22262] <tantra> The certainty-obtaining yogin,
[22263] <tantra> In the ground itself of certainty-obtaining,
[22264] <tantra> From seeing obtain self that-ness,
[22265] <tantra> Is regarded as beyond authentic ground.
[22266] <tantra> The done-complete yogin: || 1840 ||
[22267] <tantra> Is the primordially-pure great Buddha;
[22268] <tantra> From that gone, I do not speak.
[22269] <tantra> In the four great yogins,
[22270] <tantra> I do not speak ground-purify,
[22271] <tantra> I do not speak path-traverse.
[22272] <prose> Thus.
[22273] <prose> That also: by different manner of path-meditation,
[22274] <prose> Here direct light-clear doing, below newly-enter, although ground-path purify-traverse not-need speak
[22275] <prose> Self path: with gate-three defilement and with-attachment aggregate, and
[22276] <prose> Moving thought, and || 1850 ||
[22277] <prose> By needing to purify coarse wind-mind mind,
[22278] <prose> When those are pure: below ground-path incidentally complete, signs dawn.
[22279] <prose> Above complete by below incidentally complete become—aim in one great-completion.
[22280] <prose> Purify-traverse not-need speak.
[22281] <tantra> Ground one: rigpa spontaneously-accomplished,
[22282] <tantra> In all-doing,
[22283] <tantra> Rigpa spontaneously-complete, not-transform not-purify.
[22284] <tantra> Thus like.
[22285] <ornament> Third: In the definite supreme place, generally showing the distinction of the yogin, and
[22286] <tantra> From two in individual explanation of vessel-possess. || 1860 ||
