[30637] <prose> Liberation and confusion in the intermediate state and future life, and the signs of certainty, are concluded through secret sealing.
[30638] <prose> First has three aspects.
[30639] <prose> Signs of how previously the body trained in the three kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[30640] <prose> Signs of how speech habituated.
[30641] <prose> Signs of how mind trained.
[30642] <prose> First.
[30643] <prose> In previous life, training through the body in the three kayas of body, speech, and mind, if interrupted, now showing those signs has four aspects.
[30644] <prose> The sequence of signs.
[30645] <prose> The suitability of arising.
[30646] <prose> The result if habituated. || 10220 ||
[30647] <prose> If not habituated, certainty is not obtained.
[30648] <prose> First.
[30649] <tantra> From the Glorious Infinite Space Blazing Relics Tantra.
[30650] <prose> As the completely enlightened Buddhas.
[30651] <prose> Body signs and speech signs.
[30652] <prose> Similarly mind vajra signs.
[30653] <prose> As previously dawned.
[30654] <prose> Here too upon all sentient beings' bodies.
[30655] <prose> These will all appear.
[30656] <prose> To whom these appear. || 10230 ||
[30657] <prose> Fortunate ones who trained previously.
[30658] <tantra> From not ripening previously.
[30659] <prose> Now at this time definite result.
[30660] <prose> For whomever accomplishes.
[30661] <break> <prose> Body signs and similarly speech.
[30662] <break> <prose> Mind and so forth, these signs arise.
[30663] <prose> Thus it is said.
[30664] <prose> Signs of having trained in previous life in Buddha's body, for a man or woman, at the forehead center, clockwise-swirling conch or trident-like crease standing upward and.
[30665] <prose> Om marks and.
[30666] <prose> Lines or. || 10240 ||
[30667] <prose> Self-protruding.
[30668] <prose> Signs of training in speech, for a man at the right of the throat and.
[30669] <prose> For a woman at the left, eight-petaled lotus or.
[30670] <prose> Clockwise-swirling conch or.
[30671] <prose> Banner-like or.
[30672] <prose> Hook and.
[30673] <prose> Sword and.
[30674] <prose> Marks of Ah syllable, lines or.
[30675] <prose> Self-protruding.
[30676] <prose> Signs of training in mind, at the heart, vajra and. || 10250 ||
[30677] <prose> Wheel and.
[30678] <prose> Trident's flesh mark or.
[30679] <prose> Jewel shape or.
[30680] <break> <prose> Syllable form with Hum.
[30681] <break> <prose> Second, the suitability of how these signs arise.
[30682] <prose> In all beings, from the ground, the three kayas of body, speech, and mind exist in oneself, now appearing through previous training.
[30683] <tantra> From that itself.
[30684] <prose> Even butchers, prostitutes, unfortunate ones.
[30685] <tantra> From the ground, three kayas of body, speech, and mind exist.
[30686] <prose> Therefore through previous habituation. || 10260 ||
[30687] <prose> For those who entered interruption above.
[30688] <prose> The above three kayas of body, speech, and mind signs.
[30689] <prose> These arise in all.
[30690] <prose> Thus it is said.
[30691] <prose> Third, how results are obtained if habituated.
[30692] <prose> Through these signs, if effort is made in this life, quickly liberated in three kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[30693] <prose> Body signs exist, training in body now, in two lives obtaining vajra body.
[30694] <prose> Through speech obtaining speech vajra, in two lives accomplishing.
[30695] <prose> Through habituation in mind, accomplishing in three.
[30696] <prose> The knowledge that establishes certainty of results of signs and habituation. || 10270 ||
[30697] <tantra> From the Blazing Relics Tantra.
[30698] <prose> Whoever trains in Sugata body.
[30699] <prose> At that one's forehead expanse.
[30700] <prose> Conch swirling clockwise or.
[30701] <prose> Or trident crease standing upward.
[30702] <prose> Similarly also syllable Om.
[30703] <prose> Lines or self-protruding.
[30704] <prose> To whom these signs arise.
[30705] <prose> Previously trained in Buddha body.
[30706] <prose> This yogin who trained. || 10280 ||
[30707] <prose> Inseparable from Buddha body.
[30708] <prose> With confidence at the time.
[30709] <prose> Life two will be obtained.
[30710] <prose> Without interruption entering this.
[30711] <prose> Diligent in meditation itself.
[30712] <prose> This is extremely precious.
[30713] <prose> In all Buddhas' speech.
[30714] <prose> Whoever trained previously.
[30715] <prose> To the fortunate one endowed with fortune.
[30716] <prose> At that one's throat right and left. || 10290 ||
[30717] <prose> Eight-petaled lotus or.
[30718] <prose> Or conch swirling clockwise.
[30719] <prose> Similarly unfurled banner or.
[30720] <prose> Hook or sword and.
[30721] <prose> Marked by syllable Ah.
[30722] <prose> Lines or protruding.
[30723] <prose> To whomever exists, that person.
[30724] <prose> In all Buddhas' speech too.
[30725] <prose> Through this one trained previously.
[30726] <prose> In two lives in one speech. || 10300 ||
[30727] <prose> Definite result will be obtained.
[30728] <prose> This too precious without interruption.
[30729] <prose> If speech meditation is practiced without interruption.
[30730] <prose> Definitely will be obtained without doubt.
[30731] <prose> In Buddhas' mind too.
[30732] <prose> Whoever habituated previously.
[30733] <prose> These signs appear on this body.
[30734] <prose> At whose heart place.
[30735] <prose> Trident vajra standing upward and.
[30736] <prose> Similarly wheel with four spokes or. || 10310 ||
[30737] <prose> Third stage flesh mark or.
[30738] <prose> Jewel shape itself or.
[30739] <break> <prose> Hum syllable mark.
[30740] <break> <prose> To whom arises, that person.
[30741] <prose> In Buddha's mind too.
[30742] <prose> This one habituated, endowed with fortune.
[30743] <prose> Through this, if diligent in meditation.
[30744] <prose> Without interruption, in three lives.
[30745] <prose> In Buddha mind's mandala.
[30746] <prose> No doubt will become Buddha. || 10320 ||
[30747] <prose> Thus it is said.
[30748] <prose> Fourth, though these signs exist, if Dharma is not taken into practice.
[30749] <prose> Beginningless habitual patterns are long heavy.
[30750] <prose> Present non-virtue arises near.
[30751] <prose> Karmic momentum is forceful.
[30752] <prose> Merely from previous signs.
[30753] <prose> Not protecting from that, in the future.
[30754] <prose> Through mixed previous virtue and present various karma.
[30755] <prose> Body sign possessors in form realm.
[30756] <prose> Speech particularly in Brahma class and. || 10330 ||
[30757] <prose> Mind sign possessors born as titans.
[30758] <tantra> From that itself.
[30759] <tantra> From interruption here.
[30760] <prose> Result itself is not obtained.
[30761] <tantra> From mind, disturbed abode arises.
[30762] <tantra> From body similarly form realm gods.
[30763] <tantra> From speech in Brahma's abode.
[30764] <prose> Thus it is said.
[30765] <prose> Second, how signs appear now through how speech habituated, also has three aspects.
[30766] <prose> If signs arise, making effort in yoga in three kayas of body, speech, and mind. || 10340 ||
[30767] <prose> Liberation obtained in two lives.
[30768] <prose> Otherwise not obtained.
[30769] <prose> The nature of signs and that.
[30770] <tantra> From that itself.
[30771] <prose> Thus in sentient beings too.
[30772] <prose> Previously in Buddha three kayas.
[30773] <prose> As signs of training and habituation.
[30774] <prose> Thus arise, O Dakini.
[30775] <prose> In all Buddhas' body.
[30776] <prose> Whoever habituated previously. || 10350 ||
[30777] <prose> Words spoken are forceful and.
[30778] <prose> Without changing from ceasing.
[30779] <prose> This becomes, endowed with fortune.
[30780] <prose> In one time of sun.
[30781] <prose> Thousand verses or.
[30782] <prose> Or four hundred verse meanings.
[30783] <prose> Appear in the mind.
[30784] <prose> Whatever is spoken benefits others.
[30785] <prose> This one previously in body too.
[30786] <prose> Habituated, O Dakini. || 10360 ||
[30787] <prose> In all Buddhas' mind too.
[30788] <prose> Whoever habituated in speech.
[30789] <prose> Voice like Brahma's melody.
[30790] <prose> Pleasant to all ears.
[30791] <prose> Even thousand verses.
[30792] <prose> In one day understood in mind and.
[30793] <prose> All sentient beings like servants.
[30794] <prose> This one circling.
[30795] <prose> Previously in Buddha speech too.
[30796] <prose> This one habituated, O Dakini. || 10370 ||
[30797] <prose> In Buddhas' mind too.
[30798] <prose> Person who habituated previously.
[30799] <prose> Understanding one word spoken by others.
[30800] <prose> That meaning in that manner.
[30801] <prose> Exactly as it is understood and.
[30802] <prose> In self-spoken words.
[30803] <prose> Without changing, others follow.
[30804] <prose> This one in Buddhas too.
[30805] <prose> Previously habituated, O Dakini.
[30806] <prose> Thus in three kayas of body, speech, and mind. || 10380 ||
[30807] <prose> Person who habituated.
[30808] <prose> In two lives becomes Buddha.
[30809] <prose> Thus it is said.
[30810] <prose> Third, how mind signs appearing now through training, if habituated, liberation in mind's expanse in three lives is shown.
[30811] <prose> Also from that itself.
[30812] <prose> In whatever person's mind these signs exist.
[30813] <prose> In Buddha three kayas of body, speech, and mind too.
[30814] <prose> This one habituated, I show.
[30815] <prose> Unlearned meditation self-descending and.
[30816] <prose> Mind naturally obtains spaciousness. || 10390 ||
[30817] <prose> This one previously habituated in body.
[30818] <prose> Through thought, dharmas appear in mind and.
[30819] <prose> Previously unseen objects seen and.
[30820] <break> <prose> Previously unheard Dharma words.
[30821] <break> <prose> Naturally knowing.
[30822] <prose> This one previously in Buddha's.
[30823] <prose> Speech habituated, O Dakini.
[30824] <prose> Always abiding alone and.
[30825] <prose> Without fearful mind toward anything and.
[30826] <prose> Person wandering mountains and forests. || 10400 ||
[30827] <prose> This one previously in mind too.
[30828] <prose> Habituated, O Dakini.
[30829] <prose> Thus the endowed person.
[30830] <prose> Without interruption practicing truth.
[30831] <prose> In three lives without doubt.
[30832] <prose> In Buddhahood no doubt.
[30833] <prose> Thus it is said.
[30834] <prose> These signs naturally existing in body, speech, and mind from the beginning, through previous life habituation, were clarified.
[30835] <prose> Not reaching the end of that itself.
[30836] <prose> Becoming interruption, appearing in this life. || 10410 ||
[30837] <prose> If not effortful here, called uncertain.
[30838] <prose> Through different karmic powers, entering other existence.
[30839] <prose> These signs appearing through thought examination in most beings, birds, deer, dogs, horses, and so forth, also arise through previous training in white three kayas of body, speech, and mind.
[30840] <prose> Through black karma, born in lower realm existences.
[30841] <prose> After future, dependent on present actions.
[30842] <prose> Therefore practicing supreme truth Dharma is extremely important.
[30843] <prose> Also from that.
[30844] <prose> Thus in class and non-class.
[30845] <prose> Through previous habituation's force.
[30846] <prose> These signs arise on body. || 10420 ||
[30847] <prose> Birds, deer, dogs, and so forth.
[30848] <prose> In animal forms grasped.
[30849] <prose> These signs arise.
[30850] <prose> Previously trained, then interrupted.
[30851] <prose> Thus it is said.
[30852] <prose> Second, explanation of signs of presently entering the path has two aspects.
[30853] <prose> Common general signs to be known and.
[30854] <prose> Uncommon supreme secret path signs to manifest.
[30855] <prose> First has three aspects.
[30856] <prose> Signs of confusion self-miring itself. || 10430 ||
[30857] <prose> Signs of uncertainty when pointing-out instruction key points have not directly arrived.
[30858] <prose> Signs of demon interruption when Rigpa is not directly established.
[30859] <prose> First.
[30860] <prose> These arise even in people who have not taken into practice and birds, deer, and so forth.
[30861] <prose> Changing, meaningless, called signs of cause.
[30862] <prose> Second.
[30863] <prose> When common vehicle path is taken into practice and this preliminary training and object-oriented mind, view, meditation, conduct, and result are taken into practice, signs may arise.
[30864] <prose> Therefore explained to know mistaken and non-mistaken branches.
[30865] <tantra> From one hundred sixteen.
[30866] <prose> First, fifty signs arising uncertainly in body, speech, and mind. || 10440 ||

[30981] <tantra> As explained in the Blazing Relics Tantra commentary.
[30982] <prose> Third, signs of interruption.
[30983] <prose> Knowing body transforming variously and.
[30984] <prose> Light arising from body and.
[30985] <prose> Sound arising wherever one goes and.
[30986] <prose> Power entering others and. || 10560 ||
[30987] <prose> Gathering assemblies and.
[30988] <prose> Remembering adding words to speech and.
[30989] <prose> These are mostly signs of interruption arising for that person.
[30990] <prose> Therefore sitting in water mandala, hanging chin tree stick sixteen finger-widths long.
[30991] <prose> Body anointed with sandalwood oil, coarsely meditating outer and inner things, will be cleared.
[30992] <prose> That power to transform from demonic blessing, if examined, appears as second reflection.
[30993] <break> <prose> Washing body with consecrated water, reciting Phat, meditating on emptiness like space, clears it.
[30994] <break> <prose> Moreover, for whatever yogin, without realizing dharmatā, thinking one has realized.
[30995] <prose> Joyful demon enters.
[30996] <prose> Realizing all as empty, entering partiality, thinking karma and ripening will not harm and. || 10570 ||

[31000] <prose> Sometimes subtle clairvoyance arising, with conceit existing and.
[31001] <prose> All these, knowing as demonic interruption, abiding in generation-completion or gathering great accumulations and making aspirations and.
[31002] <prose> Meditating on emptiness causes liberation.
[31003] <tantra> From Self-Arising Rigpa.
[31004] <prose> Playing with words, depth not realized, appearing like crazy ones.
