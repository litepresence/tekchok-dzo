[35016] <ornament> Third, regarding liberation: This is the criterion for release. || 14590 ||
[35017] <prose> The scriptural citation:
[35018] <tantra> From the Wisdom Lamp:
[35019] <verse> Momentary recognition divides in half,
[35020] <verse> Meditation days comprise the abiding portion.
[35021] <verse> Through the distinction of endowed and non-endowed,
[35022] <verse> Mixed and similar, — yet unmixed—possessing such.
[35023] <verse> Thus it is clearly shown.
[35024] <prose> Here, according to our own tradition, the classification of aspects of momentary recognition is pervaded by recognition of one's own face,
[35025] <prose> Yet meditation days are not pervaded by realization,
[35026] <prose> For even without realization, one may abide in natural contemplation. || 14600 ||
[35027] <prose> This is like the end of spontaneous presence.
[35028] <prose> Moreover, momentary recognition is not pervaded by meditation,
[35029] <prose> For in the moment of realization, one is liberated into primordial purity.
[35030] <prose> There exists a limit connected with meditation, from the peak of the supreme to the final.
[35031] <prose> Meditation days are not pervaded by momentary recognition, like the final delusion of the final.
[35032] <prose> There exists a limit unconnected with momentary recognition,
[35033] <prose> Like the middle and the middle of the final.
[35034] <prose> Therefore, momentary recognition and
[35035] <prose> Meditation days—dividing these is most crucial.
[35036] <ornament> Regarding meditation days, some hold them as present days, — yet this is utterly unsuitable, || 14610 ||
[35037] <prose> Unworthy of refutation by scripture and reasoning,
[35038] <prose> For they are not even worth the effort of refutation.
[35039] <tantra> From the Definitive Distinction:
[35040] <break> <verse> Erroneous paths are limitless,
[35041] <break> <verse> These here are not to be engaged.
[35042] <verse> Thus it is taught.
[35043] <break> <prose> Erroneous conceptions may resemble, — yet refute delusion.
[35044] <break> <prose> What is utterly unsuitable is the web of all elaborations, already made into a realm of shame for the wise—what is to be done here?
[35045] <prose> Those proclaiming the Victor's words become fools themselves, like the Victor—such delusion should be turned back to its own side.
[35046] <prose> Here, meditation days are calculated as the duration of contemplative stability, || 14620 ||
[35047] <prose> And in the intermediate state as well, the duration of contemplative stability is taught as meditation days.
[35048] <prose> Third, the extensive explanation of the manner of faculties' liberation, having three divisions:
[35049] <list> Superior faculties,
[35050] <list> Middling,
[35051] <list> Inferior in sequence.
[35052] <prose> The first has seven aspects:
[35053] <prose> Perfection of the supreme,
[35054] <break> <prose> Liberated without connection to meditation days in three moments,
[35055] <break> <prose> Others, more or less connected with meditation days, are liberated in three moments.
[35056] <prose> Hence, like a shooting star racing through space, entering self-appearance as primordial purity, through the radiance of emanation's own light, emptying the saṃsāra of sentient beings in the realm of spontaneous presence's self-appearance, one is liberated. || 14630 ||
[35057] <prose> Moreover, from that own place of primordial purity, emanation does not diverge,
[35058] <prose> For this is the ground transcending coarse Appearance of Body and pristine cognition.
[35059] <prose> Emanation diverging below, performing the actual benefit of sentient beings, arises from the ground-appearance of spontaneous presence shining forth from primordial purity.
[35060] <prose> Diverging from the Path, through holding the body of great transference and
[35061] <prose> Traversing natural emanation, one benefits sentient beings of other continuums from oneself.
[35062] <prose> The manner of emanation diverging in the intermediate state appears to perform that benefit through the door of spontaneous presence from self-appearance as saṃsāra—
[35063] <prose> Know this as similar to having benefited sentient beings in a dream, without actual benefit arising for others beyond mere self-appearance.
[35064] <prose> This ground is a unique philosophical tenet of the special Great Perfection, making it somewhat difficult to realize.
[35065] <prose> When making three moments, in the first, the sphere-appearance together with the four pristine cognitions and their connections ceases.
