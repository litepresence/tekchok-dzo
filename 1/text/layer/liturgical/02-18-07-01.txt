[25173] <prose> Outer: gaze at cloud-separate sky;
[25174] <prose> When dust and rain removed, Press direct main-point, expert, Make inner lamp the path. Thus it was said. That also: outer awareness dawning field; Inner: experience increasing field. Awareness and experience, from two not existing, Called saṃsāra-nirvāṇa mixed. That also: earth, water, fire, wind—entity coarse— Gaze at field, not liberate. First: not desire vision dawn; Later dawn: definite, coarse entity like, Knowing also compatible with that arises, Emptiness thought not-existing—experience not dawning within.
[25175] <prose> Gaze awareness at sky empty—
[25176] <prose> Field compatible with sky, experience empty, || 4750 ||
[25177] <prose> Clear, separate from radiating-gathering, vast, dawns.
[25178] <prose> Purpose exists: entity separate from characteristic.
[25179] <tantra> From Mind Section:
[25180] <prose> Yogin abides in sky's bird-path.
[25181] <prose> Thus said, and:
[25182] <tantra> From Collection:
[25183] <prose> Make gaze at sky-only for that meaning.
[25184] <prose> Thus said, and:
[25185] <tantra> From Middle Mother:
[25186] <prose> Transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation || 4760 ||
[25187] <prose> Is making sky-yogin, said, etc.—scriptures immeasurable.
[25188] <prose> That also: field outer-inner mixed,
[25189] <prose> Called equal limitless view;
[25190] <prose> Called dhatu-awareness non-dual view;
[25191] <prose> Called dhatu-awareness mixed, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa taste equal view.
[25192] <prose> This same, from Instruction-Child also:
[25193] <prose> Dhatu and awareness gaze manner,
[25194] <prose> Sky-like, separate from obscuration-doer.
[25195] <prose> Thus spoken.
[25196] <prose> Third, wind-awareness main-point: || 4770 ||
[25197] <prose> When field and gate two meet,
[25198] <prose> Rely on slow wind, called capturing awareness.
[25199] <prose> That also: somehow slow wind,
[25200] <prose> Shoot outer far, hold outer, place—main-point.
[25201] <prose> That also: wind and slow cause—
[25202] <prose> Outer: become yogin's life-extending helper;
[25203] <prose> Inner: make cause for conceptuality to cease;
[25204] <prose> Secret: do action of awareness direct seeing;
[25205] <prose> Actual: make Buddha, not seeing contaminated.
[25206] <prose> That thus, also from Thalgyur: || 4780 ||
[25207] <prose> Make wind somehow slow,
[25208] <prose> Arising from fully projecting,
[25209] <prose> Body and mind connection cut that,
[25210] <prose> Not reversing even in three realms.
[25211] <prose> Thus said, and:
[25212] <prose> Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom,
[25213] <prose> Arising from fully projecting,
[25214] <prose> Body and mind connection cut that,
[25215] <prose> Not reversing even in three realms. Thus said, and: Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom. Thus it was said. Awareness main-point: hanging-cord, place in dhatu fence, make not move.
[25216] <tantra> From that same: || 4790 ||
[25217] <prose> Self-face awareness hanging-cord,
[25218] <prose> Capturing sky, separate from going-coming.
[25219] <prose> Thus said, and:
[25220] <tantra> From Instruction-Child:
[25221] <prose> Hanging-cord inside dhatu,
[25222] <prose> Arrange place, do not separate.
[25223] <prose> Thus it was said.
[25224] <prose> That also: relying on slow wind,
[25225] <prose> Action separate meaning arises in mind;
[25226] <prose> Gaze awareness hanging-cord at forehead, || 4800 ||
[25227] <prose> Conceptuality source exhausted from;
[25228] <prose> Delusion returns to base, wisdom mother-son meet.
[25229] <prose> Awareness, separate from wind, going-coming not existing—
[25230] <prose> Self-arisen awareness enters.
[25231] <prose> That also: if guide, rely on body main-point,
[25232] <prose> Do five-six days;
[25233] <prose> Then practice gate, only that much;
[25234] <prose> Then seek field, do six-seven days;
[25235] <prose> Then deliver direct to self-point, take experience.
[25236] <prose> That: very purified, meditation knowing arises; || 4810 ||
[25237] <prose> Other: wrong not-wrong cause, see flickering vision,
[25238] <prose> No faith—when guide finishes, what to say? Nothing.
[25239] <prose> Various divinations arise near,
[25240] <prose> Therefore make pure those not gone thus.
[25241] <prose> That: general, when apply great guide, Preliminary measure arrives, Purify with diligence, Actual main: faith, not ordinary, arises. Actual main: hit point-delivery, Direct delight, special arises. Subsequent support: explain dharma end-cut, Knowing capable of maintaining experience practice, Doubt and conceptuality end, Purpose exists: mind not desiring other dharma. Second: introduce awareness self-face directly: Awareness—vajra hanging-cord, golden thread hovering in sky like, With dhatu luminous-clear vision— This, not-deluded Buddha, pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance. Look at state: all concept-doers pure, Elaboration-free, sky-like resonance dawns within— Dhatu-awareness non-dual intent, Meet face of transcendent discriminating-awareness arising wisdom.
[25242] <prose> First Samantabhadra, equal capacity.
[25243] <prose> When this habituation arrives at measure—
[25244] <prose> Liberating with stone into light;
[25245] <prose> If not arrived, traverse bardo
[25246] <prose> Or nature-emanation field; || 4820 ||
[25247] <prose> Cut six-realms' delusion precipice.
[25248] <prose> Thus introduce, and:
[25249] <tantra> From Self-Arising Instruction:
[25250] <prose> Thus, whoever sees—this person,
[25251] <prose> First Samantabhadra,
[25252] <prose> Capacity itself is equal.
[25253] <prose> Thus said, and:
[25254] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[25255] <prose> Hanging-cord nature is:
[25256] <prose> By all conceptuality pure, || 4830 ||
[25257] <prose> Base-Buddha, not deluded.
[25258] <prose> Thus it was said.
[25259] <ornament> Third: Show vision's dawning manner from that:
[25260] <prose> Dhatu light five self-resonance luster dawning,
[25261] <prose> Bind tiny point to hanging-cord,
[25262] <tantra> From first white-pure star-scatter like,
[25263] <prose> Point possessing five colors,
[25264] <prose> Each one,
[25265] <prose> Three-bind interval vision until that.
[25266] <tantra> From previous: || 4840 ||
[25267] <break> <prose> Then see point.
[25268] <break> <prose> Thus it was said.
[25269] <prose> That also: look at outer luminous-clear,
[25270] <prose> Inner conceptuality separate,
[25271] <prose> Equal limitless liberating;
[25272] <prose> Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance,
[25273] <prose> And spontaneous-completion light-resonance,
[25274] <prose> Two—outer-inner pair connect;
[25275] <prose> Called dhatu-awareness not-existing gathering-separate intent.
[25276] <ornament> Third: Vision four dawning sequence, two are: || 4850 ||
[25277] <prose> Briefly show essence,
[25278] <prose> Extensively explain nature.
[25279] <ornament> First: When all four visions,
[25280] <prose> Body abiding in posture,
[25281] <prose> Eye gazing at gaze manner,
[25282] <prose> Wind-awareness mode slow,
[25283] <prose> Hence, three main-points harmonize. Particularly: first two visions purify, Later two not relying on effort, Mode purify, Liberate into luminous-clear, Therefore called dhatu-awareness non-dual. These main-points: arise from not doing— Separate awareness vajra hanging-cord—main-point. Explain that meaning: Awareness—essence, nature, compassion—three not-differentiable, Base-abide and that resonance, From light channel pure vision, Like golden thread coil, Curve interval point bind. Vajra: all buddhas and sentient beings, Essence not existing good-bad, Equal, unchanging, Place in abiding part.
[25284] <prose> Lu: like good water channel,
[25285] <prose> Water emerges without increase or decrease.
[25286] <prose> Body and wisdom increase-opening, || 4860 ||
[25287] <prose> Various path-visions until complete,
[25288] <tantra> From that, dawning cause.
[25289] <prose> Gu: inside that,
[25290] <prose> Pull not-mistaken dharmatā view and meditation.
[25291] <prose> Rgyud: pervading saṃsāra-nirvāṇa,
[25292] <tantra> From those vision collections,
[25293] <prose> Body and
[25294] <prose> Point radiating and
[25295] <prose> Arising and
[25296] <prose> Gathering etcetera, clear cause. || 4870 ||
[25297] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[25298] <prose> Slow wind-awareness accomplishes wisdom;
[25299] <tantra> From that, vision becomes four:
[25300] <prose> By dharmatā direct vision,
[25301] <prose> Suppress intellect-grasping view;
[25302] <prose> By experience-vision increasing above,
[25303] <prose> Cause delusion vision to cease;
[25304] <prose> By awareness measure-arriving vision,
[25305] <prose> Transcend three-bodies realizing path-vision;
[25306] <prose> By dharmatā exhausting vision, || 4880 ||
[25307] <prose> Cut three-realms' saṃsāra stream.
[25308] <prose> Thus it was said.
[25309] <prose> That also: vision four number determined—
[25310] <prose> Outer: sun-moon time four, increase decrease;
[25311] <prose> Inner: body, speech, mind four, liberating from binding;
[25312] <prose> Secret: showing empowerment four determination;
[25313] <prose> Actual: four determined relying on lamp four vision determination.
[25314] <prose> Sequence determined:
[25315] <prose> First, base dharmatā direct not see,
[25316] <prose> Remaining three dawning base not existing— Basis and supported base, First: dharmatā direct vision dawning. That same dawn: seeing dharmas all meaning, Called self-arisen wisdom self-found. Then: direct that, if not experience experience, Word only, fruit not arise; Meaning experience: that experience increase above arise. Thus: need make firm arisen experience measure; If not firm, experience no end, Not possessing dharmas, Buddha not arising cause; Arrive at firm experience measure cause. || 4890 ||
[25317] <prose> Awareness measure-arriving vision arises.
[25318] <prose> Though awareness vision arrives at measure,
[25319] <prose> If not changing from that to other,
[25320] <prose> Not different from desiring three-bodies' fruit,
[25321] <prose> Not different from ordinary hoping for meaning-fruit
[25322] <tantra> From actual vision-mark dharmas.
[25323] <prose> Vision-experience dissolves into base;
[25324] <prose> Subtle-coarse vision-holding ceases;
[25325] <prose> Experience dharmatā exhaustion,
[25326] <prose> dharmatā-exhausting vision arises. || 4900 ||
[25327] <prose> Those also: first two—Nirmāṇakāya;
[25328] <prose> Measure-arriving—Sambhogakāya;
[25329] <prose> Exhausting—Dharmakāya vision.
[25330] <prose> Making path of three-bodies' path-vision dawn,
[25331] <prose> Arrive at fruit dharmatā-exhausting pure dhatu—cause.
[25332] <prose> Self-vision potency dissolves
[25333] <prose> Into three-bodies' awareness mode;
[25334] <prose> Awareness pure fruit,
[25335] <prose> Originally from awareness dhatu,
[25336] <prose> Self-potency three-bodies dawn, || 4910 ||
[25337] <prose> Called functioning fruit.
[25338] <prose> Vehicle other: name also not hear essence;
[25339] <prose> Vehicle king: called intent.
[25340] <prose> This main-point: difficult to realize, is one.
[25341] <ornament> Second: Extensively explain individual nature, four are:
