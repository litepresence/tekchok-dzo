[23598] <prose> Again from that:
[23599] <prose> How in young girl's dream.

[23611] <prose> Thus training illusory-body daytime-nighttime.
[23612] <prose> True-attachment to deluded-appearance not exist, and.
[23613] <prose> Seeing body also as transparent, shadow-form-like appearance, truth-not-exist.
[23614] <prose> Shadow not exist upon body, and.
[23615] <prose> Holding bardo illusory-body, becoming final-existence person.
[23616] <prose> Like holy precious lama Gyalwa Zhangton and scholar Nyibum. || 3190 ||
[23617] <prose> Those also from Thalgyur:
[23618] <prose> Train illusory-body dream.
[23619] <prose> By that mastery, body itself also.
[23620] <prose> Become like shadow-form.
