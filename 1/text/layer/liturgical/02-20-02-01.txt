[29257] <list> First:
[29258] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[29259] <tantra> To dharmatā's self-appearance sky,
[29260] <tantra> Awareness wisdom not distracted,
[29261] <tantra> In non-grasping state settled,
[29262] <tantra> Pure wisdom's self-appearance seen.
[29263] <break> <tantra> Non-recognition delusion-appearances reversed.
[29264] <break> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29265] <tantra> Upon the never-setting victory banner,
[29266] <tantra> The unchanging lamp clear, || 8840 ||
[29267] <tantra> To thought-free wisdom,
[29268] <tantra> The five lights without waxing or waning clear.
[29269] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29270] <tantra> Upon the wish-fulfilling jewel nectar,
[29271] <tantra> Through contrived practice never obtained.
[29272] <tantra> To the expanse-lamp appearance,
[29273] <break> <tantra> Without distraction, clear, without grasping, examine.
[29274] <break> <tantra> Thus without distraction from meaning,
[29275] <tantra> The wish-fulfilling jewel lamp it is.
[29276] <break> <tantra> Without contrivance or settlement, supreme attainment, || 8850 ||
[29277] <break> <tantra> Without grasping, self-liberated in its own place.
[29278] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29279] <list> Second:
[29280] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[29281] <tantra> Body's crucial point is through resonance,
[29282] <tantra> Through wisdom's settling postures pure.
[29283] <tantra> Thigle accumulated and churned—accomplished.
[29284] <tantra> Light expands and gathers.
[29285] <tantra> Through related binding, wind's crucial point.
[29286] <tantra> Entering's action distinguished by extreme. || 8860 ||
[29287] <tantra> Its transformation causes wind exhaustion.
[29288] <tantra> Delusion's harmony related.
[29289] <tantra> Awareness's crucial point is releasing and
[29290] <tantra> Drawing upward, released to space.
[29291] <tantra> Expanse's crucial point is gathering and
[29292] <tantra> Drawing, elements' pervasion related.
[29293] <tantra> Appearance's crucial point is increase and exhaustion,
[29294] <tantra> Various self-liberated.
[29295] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29296] <prose> Moreover, when seeing the body at that time, the crucial point is to view that resonance of complete perfection without change. || 8870 ||
[29297] <prose> At the time of wisdom citadels and so forth, the settling posture is without change.
[29298] <prose> If thigle does not increase, draw inward to the center of the eyes, binding the light-nerve.
[29299] <prose> If light-pra expands, direct to the area between the eyebrows.
[29300] <prose> If thoughts disperse, bind the wind and draw.
[29301] <prose> Awareness's crucial point: release the chain to space.
[29302] <prose> Expanse's crucial point: gather to the center, and from the corner of the eyes, guide and view.
[29303] <prose> These are the crucial points.
[29304] <list> Second: when practicing in that manner, the crucial point of expanse-awareness progressively experienced is
[29305] <prose> From first practice to final completion:
[29306] <tantra> From the Lion Complete Potency: || 8880 ||
[29307] <tantra> This awareness's self-appearance entity,
[29308] <tantra> Abides as wisdom's chain.
[29309] <tantra> Like birds flying swiftly born,
[29310] <tantra> In but an instant, pervades all.
[29311] <tantra> If string strikes that,
[29312] <tantra> It becomes merely swift as a deer.
[29313] <tantra> Then without distraction from meaning,
[29314] <tantra> Merely circling to the essence like a bee.
[29315] <tantra> Then viewing self-appearance,
[29316] <tantra> Like a mirage, it abides. || 8890 ||
[29317] <tantra> Then without distraction from meaning,
[29318] <tantra> Merely as flickering or flashing it becomes.
[29319] <tantra> Without distraction from its meaning,
[29320] <tantra> It becomes like quivering and fire.
[29321] <tantra> Therefore, when viewed intently,
[29322] <tantra> Non-coming, non-going, light-appearance seen.
[29323] <tantra> When steadied upon its meaning,
[29324] <tantra> The empty thigle lamp seen.
[29325] <tantra> When truly viewed upon that,
[29326] <tantra> The thigle body seen endowed. || 8900 ||
[29327] <tantra> Without distraction from its meaning,
[29328] <tantra> Delusion-appearance seen as enjoyment body.
[29329] <tantra> All those body's appearances,
[29330] <tantra> Are like illusions, rainbows.
[29331] <tantra> When steadied intently upon that,
[29332] <tantra> Day and night without distinction:
[29333] <break> <tantra> Like the eyes of a wolf,
[29334] <break> <tantra> Without day or night,
[29335] <tantra> Self-appearance mandala is likewise.
[29336] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 8910 ||
[29337] <prose> Moreover, all empty-form rainbow-light thigle bodies and so forth
[29338] <prose> Are commonly said to exist in outer space,
[29339] <prose> And grasped as existing there.
[29340] <prose> Mistaken understanding is not so.
[29341] <prose> All that exist in inner body's clear light-nerve
[29342] <prose> Are seen as empty-forms through the eye's clear light-nerve drawn inward.
[29343] <prose> Moreover, the heart's resonance-nerve pervading everywhere spreading
[29344] <prose> Is the time of ground-appearance arising now.
[29345] <prose> Knowing one's own face, settling gently upon self-resonance,
[29346] <prose> Proceeding increasingly pure, || 8920 ||
[29347] <prose> When wind and mind pure, through spontaneous presence's appearance, seeing whatever within the body, potency-ground dissolves, entering inward,
[29348] <prose> Reaching measure, going to exhaustion,
[29349] <prose> Then at setting, ground-appearance dissolving into ground, liberated in primordial purity.
[29350] <prose> All those appearances appear as increase, — yet increase is without self-nature.
[29351] <prose> Inward self-reversal—there is no waning.
[29352] <prose> Here, what tantras and oral instructions say exists in outer space
[29353] <prose> Is provisionally spoken: because of the portion seen when directing the eye to conditioned outer space, and because it seems to exist there.
[29354] <prose> In nature, if existing outside, others could also see it.
[29355] <prose> Knowing it does not exist outside,
[29356] <prose> That others do not see one's own empty-form is because obscured by the body. || 8930 ||
[29357] <prose> One's own seeing is like seeing the sun shining inside through the window of inwardly arising clear light-nerve.
[29358] <prose> The proof is that when eyes closed, seeing empty-forms also knows it exists inside.
[29359] <prose> Therefore, body and so forth's appearances, though not in outer objects, seem to exist,
[29360] <prose> Like a form reflected when looking in a mirror.
[29361] <prose> In the mirror of inner clear light-nerve,
[29362] <prose> The heart's awareness like-form resonance-appearance
[29363] <prose> Though not in objects, is seen inwardly through the quality of pure observed light-nerve.
[29364] <prose> Outer and inner two aspects confused—appearance only is delusion. Most ordinary beings accept this.
[29365] <prose> When the manner is understood thus, it is called born from the expanse of Great Perfection, person of wisdom.
[29366] <prose> The yogin of various self-liberation, like myself. || 8940 ||
[29367] <prose> The manner of these, when conjoined with confident scripture,
[29368] <tantra> From the Lion Complete Potency Great Tantra:
[29369] <tantra> All those body's appearances,
[29370] <tantra> Are not objects' appearances.
[29371] <tantra> For example, by a young maiden,
[29372] <tantra> Upon the mirror's clear characteristic,
[29373] <tantra> Her own face-appearance seen—
[29374] <tantra> To dharmatā's object-sky,
[29375] <tantra> Awareness's appearance arises as body.
[29376] <tantra> Seeing one's own actual state || 8950 ||
[29377] <tantra> Is not existing in objects.
[29378] <tantra> Through pure observation, directly clear.
[29379] <tantra> With one's own mandala and retinue,
[29380] <tantra> Though wisdom's meaning is objectless,
[29381] <tantra> It appears as objects for sentient beings.
[29382] <tantra> Great realization in seen objects,
[29383] <tantra> Great bliss in understood objects.
[29384] <tantra> Great experience in seen appearance.
[29385] <break> <tantra> Self-awareness alone, supreme companion.
[29386] <break> <tantra> Because in appearance's objects it does not exist, || 8960 ||
[29387] <tantra> From vajra chain itself,
[29388] <tantra> The body's portions inconceivable.
[29389] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29390] <prose> This has meaning to be understood—the wise should realize.
[29391] <prose> In nature, easy to realize, called "body appearance"—there is no contradiction.
[29392] <prose> For the deluded, who see expanse-awareness and lamps appearing in outer space, it is explained for ease of understanding.
[29393] <prose> Inner meaning is as before.
[29394] <list> Fifth: the manner of determining particular distinctions,
[29395] <prose> Through the crucial point of awareness's unchangeability,
