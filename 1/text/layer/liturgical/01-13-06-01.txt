[17072] <prose> First, the essential nature:
[17073] <prose> The intention of all lamps as the object of knowledge—Dharmatā empty-luminous, self-abiding, together with the dynamic of knowledge.
[17074] <prose> Method: ground-hook;
[17075] <prose> Bindu;
[17076] <prose> By placing the three dimensions unmoving,
[17077] <prose> Within, self-awareness crystal-clear split, the intention of self-abiding together with the interval of knowledge filling the expanse.
[17078] <tantra> From the Blazing Lamp:
[17079] <tantra> "Self-arisen wisdom lamp—
[17080] <tantra> Thus, of all lamps, || 17080 ||
[17081] <tantra> Since abiding as the object of knowledge,
[17082] <tantra> By this exactly, in all parts,
[17083] <tantra> By this discriminating wisdom exactly,
[17084] <tantra> Abiding in the manner of non-discrimination.
[17085] <tantra> As the nature producing subtle parts,
[17086] <tantra> Abiding primordially from the beginning.
[17087] <tantra> Thus it is spoken."
[17088] <prose> Second, the definitive meaning:
[17089] <prose> Within self-abiding effortless intention, when knowing the time of outer-appearance self-appearance completely obvious,
[17090] <prose> Knowing dharmas all universally empty and selfless, || 17090 ||
[17091] <prose> Knowing the measures of one's own primordial wisdom—this is called knowledge.
[17092] <tantra> "Excellent, by all difficult to realize intention, not sought, found from self, becoming the extremely superior summit"—thus.
[17093] <tantra> "Primordially existing jewel found at self, called self";
[17094] <tantra> Self-arisen, ceaselessly arising, called arisen;
[17095] <tantra> Knowing dharmas clearly, called lamp.
[17096] <tantra> Self-appearance pervading at self-face by awareness, not by knowledge, called not.
[17097] <tantra> Again, from that exactly:
[17098] <tantra> By knowledge, entity and non-entity,
[17099] <tantra> Completely entering into all appearances,
[17100] <tantra> And knowing the universal meanings, || 17100 ||
[17101] <tantra> Obtaining the confidence of not-sought, not-placed,
[17102] <tantra> Knowing the measures of one's own primordial wisdom,
[17103] <tantra> Dharmakāya of pure nature,
[17104] <tantra> By self-awareness not finding the three,
[17105] <tantra> Clearly appearing surpassing all excellence.
[17106] <tantra> Since no basis for examination by others,
[17107] <tantra> Object of primordially pure self-arisen,
[17108] <tantra> Not object of other, called self.
[17109] <tantra> By doing, this meaning not found;
[17110] <tantra> Since hope not existing for whom, || 17110 ||
[17111] <tantra> Called primordially self-appearance arisen.
[17112] <tantra> By lamp, all Dharmatā,
[17113] <tantra> Making appear as non-dual,
[17114] <tantra> Ma pervading self-face, thus.
[17115] <tantra> Thus spoken, and
[17116] <tantra> From the Pearl-Garland:
[17117] <tantra> "For example, like a fire-lamp,
[17118] <tantra> By knowledge, dharmas simultaneously realized;
[17119] <tantra> Excellent, becoming the summit of all;
[17120] <tantra> Self free from other-dependent dharmas; || 17120 ||
[17121] <tantra> Arisen, unblocked, spontaneously appearing."
[17122] <tantra> Thus spoken.
[17123] <prose> Third, divided there are five:
[17124] <list> Ground-abiding self-arisen wisdom;
[17125] <list> Inner-abiding awareness of knowledge—abiding as arising-ground and support.
[17126] <list> One-pointed-grasping-appearance wisdom;
[17127] <list> Expansive awareness non-dual union's own time self-clear, stainless, pure, conveying intention to Dharmatā.
[17128] <list> Memory ceaseless wisdom;
[17129] <list> Arising without characteristic below, — yet
[17130] <list> Liberating self-face to Dharmatā as one. || 17130 ||
[17131] <list> Analytical wisdom;
[17132] <list> Dharmas and dharmatās, self and universal aspects,
[17133] <list> Characteristics, etc., appearing without confusion, knowing.
[17134] <list> Three-engaging wisdom;
[17135] <list> In this bardo of nature, by hearing, establishing definitively;
[17136] <list> By thinking, determining;
[17137] <list> By meditation, tasting, certainly liberating from saṃsāra—
[17138] <list> Making realize word-meaning.
[17139] <tantra> Again, from that exactly:
[17140] <tantra> Divisions are five types: || 17140 ||
[17141] <tantra> By ground-abiding self-arisen wisdom,
[17142] <tantra> Making supports of body, etc., dharmas;
[17143] <tantra> By one-pointed-grasping-awareness,
[17144] <tantra> Grasping support of expanse and awareness;
[17145] <tantra> By memory-ceaseless wisdom,
[17146] <tantra> Gathering objects, one-pointed knowledge;
[17147] <tantra> By analytical wisdom,
[17148] <tantra> Discriminating universal and self characteristics;
[17149] <tantra> By three-engaging wisdom,
[17150] <tantra> Establishing definitively in nature's bardo. || 17150 ||
[17151] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[17152] <prose> Fourth, the characteristic:
[17153] <prose> Knowing dharmas gathered by appearing objects and dharmas gathered by knowing awareness as without nature—this is the characteristic.
[17154] <tantra> From that exactly:
[17155] <tantra> "All dharmas appearing and not-appearing,
[17156] <tantra> Who knows as without nature—
[17157] <tantra> This is the characteristic."
[17158] <tantra> Thus spoken, and
[17159] <tantra> From the Condensed:
[17160] <tantra> "Dhārmās completely transformed as without nature— || 17160 ||
[17161] <tantra> This is called supreme Prajñāpāramitā."
[17162] <tantra> Thus spoken exactly.
[17163] <prose> Fifth, the gate of manifestation:
[17164] <prose> Five faculties—since the gate is that by power-awareness objects are measured as wisdom.
[17165] <prose> Particularly, from the nose, memory wisdom's horse wind moving—this exactly.
[17166] <prose> Fire wind wisdom's spark-like appearance at night, squeezing—know thus.
[17167] <tantra> Again, from that exactly:
[17168] <tantra> "Manifestation gate five faculties;
[17169] <tantra> Particularly, from nose making manifest.
[17170] <tantra> That sign at night time, || 17170 ||
[17171] <tantra> Groaning and fierce squeezing,
[17172] <tantra> Extremely fierce body remaining,
[17173] <tantra> Red blazing light rays,
[17174] <tantra> Spreading like sparks—
[17175] <tantra> By that measure and that sign,
[17176] <tantra> Know the gate of manifestation."
[17177] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[17178] <prose> Sixth, the field:
[17179] <prose> Citta on four channels of great distinction, grasped by wisdom's clarity-wind, not dispersing outward, internally self-abiding, only unclear,
[17180] <prose> By karma-wind outward-force moved, objects awareness-appeared. || 17180 ||
[17181] <prose> That also, abiding in name-ground-gathered clarity,
[17182] <prose> Element,
[17183] <prose> Knowledge,
[17184] <prose> Fourfold clarity of wisdom-awareness.
[17185] <tantra> From that exactly:
[17186] <tantra> "From four producing channels,
[17187] <tantra> Moving, shaking, dispersing,
[17188] <tantra> Fire spark rising characteristic,
[17189] <tantra> Five
[17190] <break> <tantra> Wisdom, || 17190 ||
[17191] <break> <tantra> Karma,
[17192] <break> <tantra> From,
[17193] <break> <tantra> With wind,
[17194] <tantra> Knowledge clear-clear, aware-aware;
[17195] <tantra> Wisdoms' nature as
[17196] <tantra> Flavor not-raw, all trembling,
[17197] <tantra> Crystal tube hollow inside,
[17198] <tantra> Clear, great wisdom abiding.
[17199] <tantra> Name-four-gathered clarity,
[17200] <tantra> As nature discriminating all, || 17200 ||
[17201] <tantra> Primordially abiding in body-parts,
[17202] <tantra> Occasionally grasped by wind,
[17203] <tantra> Knowledge memoryless, dull, — yet
[17204] <tantra> Wisdom powers expanded-contracted,
[17205] <tantra> Clear part none, becoming dull.
[17206] <tantra> When one's own wisdom-power moved,
[17207] <tantra> Even dharmas not heard before,
[17208] <tantra> Arise in mind, clearly appear.
[17209] <tantra> Clear and unclear powers,
[17210] <tantra> Arise from wind's movement alone, || 17210 ||
[17211] <tantra> Abiding in body-center channel-inside."
[17212] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[17213] <prose> Seventh, the measure:
[17214] <prose> Ground-abiding wisdom's measure: abiding in heat-measure of equal-intention.
[17215] <prose> One-pointed-grasping wisdom's measure:
[17216] <prose> Expansive awareness mixed, obtaining self-power.
[17217] <prose> Memory-ceaseless wisdom's measure:
[17218] <prose> Liberating-arising without characteristic, gathering-dispersing exhausted, abiding in effortless spontaneous intention, conditions not moving awareness.
[17219] <prose> Analytical wisdom's measure:
[17220] <prose> Dualistic dharmas discriminated separately, establishing definitively. || 17220 ||
[17221] <prose> Three-engaging wisdom's measure:
[17222] <prose> Realizing word-meaning, abiding in meaning's self-face.
[17223] <tantra> Thus, from the Blazing Lamp:
[17224] <tantra> "Ground-abiding wisdom self-arisen measure:
[17225] <tantra> From equal-intention experience-arisen,
[17226] <tantra> Obtained confidence of stable knowledge.
[17227] <tantra> That itself, without change,
[17228] <tantra> Always abiding in continuum, thus
[17229] <tantra> By this, ground-abiding wisdom completed.
[17230] <tantra> This body also light, || 17230 ||
[17231] <tantra> Knowledges clear.
[17232] <tantra> One-pointed-grasping wisdom measure:
[17233] <tantra> Resting-experience enjoyed signs,
[17234] <tantra> Body-center five colors' light,
[17235] <tantra> Without effort appearing outward,
[17236] <tantra> By this knowledge self-place completed.
[17237] <tantra> Body also not touching ground,
[17238] <tantra> By this knowing where placed,
[17239] <tantra> Material objects also able to melt.
[17240] <tantra> Self-power trained measure. || 17240 ||
[17241] <tantra> Memory-ceaseless wisdom measure:
[17242] <tantra> Knowledge not entering other,
[17243] <tantra> Alone abiding, happy,
[17244] <tantra> Always in secluded place,
[17245] <tantra> Not desiring to be with people,
[17246] <tantra> Knowledge becomes one-pointed.
[17247] <tantra> Even others' spoken words,
[17248] <tantra> Free from grasping as pair,
[17249] <tantra> View unchanging, confidence,
[17250] <tantra> Thinking going through space, || 17250 ||
[17251] <break> <tantra> Mind placed there, ceases there,
[17252] <tantra> Others' conditions also,
[17253] <break> <tantra> How could this be changed?
[17254] <tantra> Carefree knowledge vast,
[17255] <tantra> Person born to this,
[17256] <tantra> Memory-ceaseless wisdom completed.
[17257] <tantra> Analytical wisdom measure:
[17258] <tantra> Ālaya and Dharmakāya also,
[17259] <tantra> Thus discriminated, thus signs,
[17260] <tantra> Body attachment mind free, || 17260 ||
[17261] <tantra> Awareness placed where placed,
[17262] <tantra> Body becomes material,
[17263] <tantra> Mind and wisdom discriminated,
[17264] <tantra> Moving channels' gates also cease.
[17265] <break> <tantra> Element clear-obscure discriminated,
[17266] <break> <tantra> Coarse appearance self-liberated,
[17267] <tantra> Happy like a weasel,
[17268] <tantra> Thus saṃsāra-nirvāṇa discriminated,
[17269] <tantra> Delusion thoughts impossible.
[17270] <tantra> Even if arisen, without benefit-harm, || 17270 ||
[17271] <tantra> By such self-knowledge,
[17272] <tantra> Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa established definitively—
[17273] <tantra> Analytical thought wisdom.
[17274] <tantra> Three-engaging wisdom measure:
[17275] <tantra> All dharmas one word spoken,
[17276] <tantra> Knowing that scripture,
[17277] <tantra> Hearing wisdom measure completed.
[17278] <tantra> By knowledge, what is thought,
[17279] <tantra> That pair pleasantly arisen in continuum,
[17280] <tantra> By thinking likewise trained, || 17280 ||
[17281] <tantra> Arisen, conditions not harming,
[17282] <tantra> Deluded thought attachment self-liberated—
[17283] <tantra> By this, meditation wisdom found."
[17284] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[17285] <prose> Eighth, the harmonious example:
[17286] <prose> One for whom viewed objects appear and are realized, all afflictions burned—like fire blazing in tinder.
[17287] <tantra> From the Blazing Lamp:
[17288] <tantra> "For example, in dry tinder,
[17289] <tantra> Even meeting subtle fire spark,
[17290] <tantra> All tinder blazing, burned by fire, || 17290 ||
[17291] <tantra> By wisdom, habitual tendencies burned—
[17292] <tantra> All this wisdom lamp."
[17293] <break> <tantra> Thus spoken, and
[17294] <break> <tantra> From the Condensed:
[17295] <tantra> "By wisdom, knowing dharmas' nature completely,
[17296] <tantra> Truly transcending the three realms."
[17297] <tantra> Thus spoken exactly.
[17298] <ornament> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[17299] <ornament> The presentation of the Four Lamps' sequence—thirteenth chapter.
[17300] <prose> Thus, having explained in detail the body-support and other gathered dharmas, || 17300 ||
[17301] <prose> Now, establishing definitively the nature of knowledge depending on that—three:
[17302] <list> Ālaya and Dharmakāya distinction;
[17303] <list> Mind and wisdom distinction;
[17304] <list> Explanation of other distinctive dharmas.
[17305] <prose> First, two:
[17306] <prose> Brief presentation and
[17307] <prose> Detailed explanation.
[17308] <prose> First:
[17309] <prose> Looking at sentient beings' ground and Buddhas' ground, the essential nature of awareness—primordially pure, stainless,
[17310] <prose> Obscured by defilement with ignorance and thought-gatherings, becoming ground of all delusion-appearance, delusion-grasping— || 17310 ||
[17311] <prose> From the aspect of Ālaya and Dharmakāya as two types, know.
[17312] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[17313] <tantra> "Ālaya and Dharmakāya's crucial point."
[17314] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[17315] <prose> There, Ālaya—made distinct by ignorance, support of all mind and mental-events' beginning,
[17316] <prose> Intermediate abiding,
[17317] <prose> Final home,
[17318] <prose> Become vessel of habitual tendencies—like a pond;
[17319] <prose> Dharmakāya—
[17320] <prose> Made distinct by reversed ignorance, || 17320 ||
[17321] <prose> Transcended objects of mind and mental-events,
[17322] <prose> Pure from all karma and habitual tendencies.
[17323] <prose> Ālaya—
[17324] <prose> Like lower garment ground, become ground of downward appearance,
[17325] <prose> Various objects appearing as objects,
[17326] <prose> As subjects, six ignorance, three realms, appearing as container-contained, and its body,
[17327] <prose> Happiness-suffering,
[17328] <prose> Mind's delusion aspects, many contained;
[17329] <prose> Dharmakāya—
[17330] <prose> All that non-existing, || 17330 ||
[17331] <prose> Not abiding together with mind, etc.
[17332] <tantra> From Rangshar:
[17333] <tantra> "To Ālaya concept-grasping,
[17334] <tantra> Various deluded knowledge deceived;
[17335] <tantra> Ālaya ignorance entity,
[17336] <tantra> Called Ālaya to that.
[17337] <tantra> Thus spoken, and
[17338] <tantra> Again:
[17339] <tantra> "Sentient beings' ground and Buddhas' ground,
[17340] <tantra> Distinction by one difference determined. || 17340 ||
[17341] <tantra> Thus spoken, and
[17342] <tantra> From the Pearl-Garland:
[17343] <tantra> "Since Ālaya is accumulation,
[17344] <tantra> Dharmakāya exhaustion of outflows;
[17345] <tantra> Empty and clear, clear and pervasive,
[17346] <tantra> Uncontrived by thought, memory clear;
[17347] <tantra> Free from elaboration,
[17348] <tantra> Pervading like space, empty;
[17349] <tantra> Self-pure, free from all demonstrations,
[17350] <tantra> Ālaya with causes and conditions, || 17350 ||
[17351] <tantra> Habitual tendencies, etc., like a pond;
[17352] <tantra> Dharmakāya free from habitual tendencies,
[17353] <tantra> From mind, mental-events, gatherings,
[17354] <tantra> Embodied Ālaya appearing as many;
[17355] <tantra> Dharmakāya free from mind, etc.,
[17356] <tantra> Form-appearances many, bodies non-existing."
[17357] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[17358] <prose> That also, Ālaya—
[17359] <prose>
[17360] <prose> || 17360 ||
