[3341] <prose> First, the ground, which is the cause of clarity, is explained:
[3342] <prose> The mind itself is the ultimate, free from elaboration, and is distinguished as the Great One through being without effort.
[3343] <prose> The essence of that is thus: The ground, mind, and gold with its color—just as these two are non-dual, so it is.
[3344] <prose> Relying upon the various names of the analyzed ground, one establishes definite situations clearly.
[3345] <prose> The ground is the object to be accomplished, and through accomplishing it, one realizes the characteristics of mind as near at hand.
[3346] <prose> That is also distinguished by the concentrations of ground-abiding and the self-liberation.
[3347] <prose> The clarification of the path is thus:
[3348] <prose> Through abiding in the path of manifest realization, the pindārtha is established.
[3349] <prose> Through accomplishment, one accomplishes.
[3350] <prose> This is called the path of concentration transformation. || 3350 ||
[3351] <prose> The path of entering liberation in sequence is explained:
[3352] <prose> Through relying on the stages of arising of the harmonious yoga path,
[3353] <prose> One enters into the body of great yoga,
[3354] <prose> Wishing for self-liberated realization.
[3355] <prose> The clarification of the result is thus:
[3356] <prose> The ripened mind's result appears variously and liberates variously.
[3357] <prose> This is called self-arisen primordial wisdom.
[3358] <prose> The ripened result of reality cannot be established through effort.
[3359] <prose> This is called the all-knowing primordial wisdom of all Buddha aspects.
[3360] <prose> Also, this is explained: Relying on the ground to be accomplished, through accomplishing it, the path-accomplisher becomes manifest. Thus it is called the great realization yoga. || 3360 ||
[3361] <prose> The result: Through self-accomplishment, this is called the pure primordial wisdom of Buddha's mind.
[3362] <prose> The tradition of wishing for the main accomplishment is explained:
[3363] <prose> Divided: Through body accomplishment, carrying the maṇḍala wheel of Mañjuśrī to the path.
[3364] <prose> Through speech accomplishment, making one a Buddha of the lotus family.
[3365] <prose> Through mind accomplishment, making one a Buddha of the Heruka vajra family.
[3366] <prose> Through quality accomplishment, making one a Buddha of the jewel family.
[3367] <prose> Through activity accomplishment, accomplishing one as Buddha of the karma family.
[3368] <prose> The essence of these is thus:
[3369] <prose> Accomplishing each deity through the three concentrations without duality.
[3370] <break> <prose> The etymology is explained: || 3370 ||
[3371] <break> <prose> Relying on accomplishment, manifesting the accomplishment of one hero's maṇḍala wheel.
[3372] <prose> The purpose is explained:
[3373] <prose> Through accomplishing the path, one makes the result manifest.
[3374] <prose> The result is explained:
[3375] <prose> One becomes the Buddha of each family.
[3376] <prose> Wishing for the various to become paths:
[3377] <prose> The scattered.
[3378] <prose> Many traditions relying on subtle and net.
[3379] <tantra> Tantra and Upadeśa—these two gathered.
[3380] <tantra> The Tantra: With generation stage as main. || 3380 ||
[3381] <prose> With completion stage as main.
[3382] <prose> With union as main.
[3383] <prose> And wishing those incomplete.
[3384] <prose> Partial pieces, wishing, and so forth—many.
[3385] <tantra> From the two upadeśas, it is explained:
[3386] <prose> Accomplishing through svātma upadeśa with mind as main and branches.
[3387] <prose> Accomplishing through maṇḍala upadeśa with entry into maṇḍala.
[3388] <prose> Also this pindārtha is explained.
[3389] <prose> Relying on the divisions of manifest realization deity.
[3390] <prose> The essence of these: Only conventionally, in the time of correct convention, looking at the outer container world as the celestial palace. || 3390 ||
[3391] <prose> Looking at the maṇḍala of supported sentient beings as deities and goddesses.
[3392] <prose> Seeing all beings as forms of deities and goddesses,
[3393] <prose> There exists the purpose of not taking the life of commitment deities,
[3394] <prose> Of not doing non-virtues such as lying, and so forth.
[3395] <prose> Not intentionally creating mental objects.
[3396] <prose> Not establishing anything as ultimate essence.
[3397] <prose> Not going to true freedom.
[3398] <prose> Realizing indivisible union.
[3399] <prose> Surpassing the outer.
[3400] <prose> In ultimate truth, no deity exists, no entities or signs. || 3400 ||
[3401] <prose> Only conventionally purifying aggregates and elements, dwelling in the maṇḍala of deities and goddesses.
[3402] <prose> The five aggregates.
[3403] <prose> The five elements.
[3404] <prose> The five objects.
[3405] <prose> The five faculties.
[3406] <prose> Purifying the five afflictions, and so forth.
[3407] <prose> The meaning is purified upon the pure expanse of ground nature.
[3408] <prose> The object of purification: Aggregates, elements, and grasping, and so forth.
[3409] <prose> Through the stages of means, purifying generation and completion.
[3410] <prose> The purified result: Body and primordial wisdom, not even establishing—realizing. || 3410 ||
[3411] <prose> These also are thus:
[3412] <tantra> From self-arisen awareness.
[3413] <tantra> "Alas, the secret lord is definitely held."
[3414] <tantra> "The established view of Mahā is thus."
[3415] <tantra> "The door of entry is the three concentrations."
[3416] <tantra> "The view of realization: Whatever appears, realize as deity."
[3417] <tantra> "The root samaya: Body, speech, mind."
[3418] <tantra> "The result: Means and wisdom, not separate."
[3419] <tantra> "The three concentrations are thus."
[3420] <tantra> "The concentration of suchness:" || 3420 ||
[3421] <tantra> "Free from thought, crystal clarity."
[3422] <tantra> "All-illuminating concentration:"
[3423] <tantra> "Meditating without distraction, clearly."
[3424] <tantra> "Likewise, the concentration of cause:"
[3425] <break> <tantra> "Meditating on the three-stacked being from Hūṃ."
[3426] <break> <tantra> "The self, samaya, being."
[3427] <tantra> "Endowed with the four perfections."
[3428] <tantra> "The concentration of syllable and letter being:"
[3429] <tantra> "Endowed with the three clear aspects."
[3430] <tantra> "The two primordial wisdom beings:" || 3430 ||
[3431] <break> <tantra> "Peaceful and wrathful."
[3432] <break> <prose> The cause concentration is thus:
[3433] <tantra> "Yaṃ and raṃ and khaṃ."
[3434] <tantra> "Ra and sū and kaṃ."
[3435] <tantra> "Paṃ and sa and ma."
[3436] <break> <tantra> "Hūṃ and phaṭ, and so forth."
[3437] <break> <tantra> "Syllable letters, light rays—inconceivable."
[3438] <tantra> "Emanating, endowed with pride."
[3439] <tantra> "The deity of aspects and emptiness."
[3440] <tantra> "That is the three concentrations." || 3440 ||
[3441] <tantra> "The three samayas are thus:"
[3442] <tantra> "Abandoning the killing of life through the body door."
[3443] <tantra> "Stealing and sexual misconduct."
[3444] <tantra> "Abandoning lies and slander through the speech door."
[3445] <tantra> "Abandoning harsh speech and idle talk."
[3446] <tantra> "Abandoning covetousness and harmful intent through the mind door."
[3447] <tantra> "Completely abandoning wrong view."
[3448] <tantra> "Realizing means and wisdom as non-separate."
[3449] <tantra> "Thus the established view of Mahāyoga is wished."
[3450] <prose> Thus. || 3450 ||
[3451] <prose> Eighth: The scripture Anuyoga vehicle is explained.
[3452] <prose> Expanse and primordial wisdom non-dual, free from elaboration, not abiding in any extreme.
[3453] <prose> Accomplishing through the main door of completion stage wisdom.
[3454] <prose> Divided:
[3455] <prose> Scripture and sūtra—two.
[3456] <prose> The scripture is relying on scripture.
[3457] <prose> Wishing for the arising of mind and mental factors.
[3458] <prose> Expressing the scripture.
[3459] <prose> Not wishing for words and conventions as ground.
[3460] <prose> The sūtra is explained: || 3460 ||
[3461] <prose> Therefore, speaking purely of the five base paths on the illusory path beyond fierce primordial wisdom, lightning wheel.
[3462] <prose> Speaking of the liberation sphere of primordial wisdom through kīla, ṭhal-byin, indicating meaning in charnel ground, cuckoo play.
[3463] <prose> Speaking of the expanse through the great glorious mudrā, correct, surpassing, all-gathering awareness sūtra.
[3464] <prose> Speaking non-dually of expanse and primordial wisdom through Anu's own text, the sūtra of manifest realization, the gathering of all Buddhas' minds.
[3465] <prose> Surpassing the characteristics of mind and primordial wisdom.
[3466] <prose> The great pure letter sūtra of mind scripture.
[3467] <prose> Expanse and primordial wisdom—instantaneous.
[3468] <prose> Gradual.
[3469] <prose> Progressive.
[3470] <prose> Speaking of liberation sphere—five. || 3470 ||
[3471] <prose> Thus: The great seal free from intellect, expanse and primordial wisdom, bliss-emptiness—the bodhicitta vehicle.
[3472] <prose> That also from self-arisen awareness.
[3473] <tantra> "Hearken, Vajra-holder!"
[3474] <tantra> "The great Anuyoga vehicle of extensive scripture:"
[3475] <tantra> "Twofold aspect: expanse and primordial wisdom."
[3476] <tantra> "Desiring vajra of non-dual non-separation."
[3477] <tantra> "Entry through gate: instantaneous with gradual—thus."
[3478] <tantra> "View of realization: non-dual non-separation—thus."
[3479] <tantra> "What is instantaneous entry?"
[3480] <tantra> "Deities ungenerated, essence recalled, through perfection." || 3480 ||
[3481] <tantra> "What is gradual entry?"
[3482] <tantra> "Expanse and primordial wisdom gradually entered, and then"
[3483] <tantra> "By vajra-holder on ground, result obtained."
[3484] <tantra> "The protecting samaya is thus:"
[3485] <tantra> "Secret mantra meaning-teacher always honor shall."
[3486] <tantra> "Secret mantra teacher-of master-to"
[3487] <tantra> "Whatever accumulated-by offering proffer."
[3488] <tantra> "Master and thus such-one-gone"
[3489] <tantra> "Distinction-without one-of essence shown."
[3490] <tantra> "Briefly: expanse and primordial wisdom—thus." || 3490 ||
[3491] <break> <tantra> "Great Anuyoga established view."
[3492] <break> <prose> Thus it is taught.
[3493] <prose> Moreover, through the vehicle of Anu, the result of becoming Buddha in a single birth,
[3494] <prose> Of definitely becoming Buddha in the intermediate state,
[3495] <prose> And even of finally becoming Buddha through birth—all these are wished for.
[3496] <ornament> Furthermore, regarding the ground of liberation, which is expanse and primordial wisdom:
[3497] <prose> Created dharmas,
[3498] <prose> Striving accomplishment,
[3499] <prose> And the dwelling in the expanse of separation—emptiness beyond thought, without transfer, wherein self-arising primordial wisdom has arisen—
[3500] <prose> Through realizing all dharmas as the great self-liberation of the ground-establishment, || 3500 ||
[3501] <prose> This is called the expanse and primordial wisdom of effortless self-liberation.
[3502] <ornament> Regarding the path of various appearances, which is the expanse and primordial wisdom:
[3503] <prose> Through all various appearances having arisen as directionless play,
[3504] <prose> And through the various being liberated without cessation in the spontaneously complete expanse that merely holds direction,
[3505] <prose> Through primordial wisdom of pure illusion and directionlessness having arisen, all dharmas are realized without acceptance and rejection, without refutation and establishment,
[3506] <prose> And without desire.
[3507] <prose> This is called the expanse and primordial wisdom of spontaneously complete perfection.
[3508] <ornament> Regarding the result of the great self-liberation beyond action and separation, which is the expanse and primordial wisdom:
[3509] <prose> Through non-dwelling in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, through effortlessness, through singularity without repetition, and through the expanse of separation from the ground,
[3510] <prose> Through wisdom arising beyond view and meditation of limitlessness, || 3510 ||
[3511] <prose> All dharmas are realized as equal in pleasure and pain.
[3512] <prose> This is called the sphere and wisdom of dharma-nature beyond action.
[3513] <prose> Those who gradually enter into the expanse and primordial wisdom:
[3514] <list> Through abiding,
[3515] <list> Through emptiness,
[3516] <list> Understand bliss as the entering.
[3517] <prose> This is called the union without superior or inferior, without acceptance or rejection.
[3518] <prose> Through instantaneous entering into sphere and wisdom, understanding the self-arising dharma-nature as free from view and separation, dharmas exhausted—this is called the cause-free instantaneous liberation.
[3519] <prose> Through entering into liberation-attachment, understanding all that is and that which is not, not abandoning all,
[3520] <prose> This is called the liberation where nothing is obtained. || 3520 ||
[3521] <prose> Through entering into breakthrough, liberation without need for action or effort—
[3522] <prose> This is called Anuyoga: the arising breakthrough that sees dharma-nature.
[3523] <prose> That sphere and wisdom are non-different; thus there is the view of non-dual equality.
[3524] <prose> Without coming or going in sphere and wisdom,
[3525] <prose> This is the view of not becoming other than abiding.
[3526] <prose> Without extent or falling to either side in sphere and wisdom,
[3527] <prose> This is the view of abiding from the primordial beginning.
[3528] <prose> This is called the view without reference point, without reliance on single words, without base or separation.
[3529] <prose> The sphere of meaning is the ground.
[3530] <prose> Primordial wisdom is the path; beings who traverse the path are liberated through effort. || 3530 ||
[3531] <prose> The expanse is the cause, and primordial wisdom is the result.
[3532] <prose> Through these pristine sense faculties, liberation is attained without reference to outer action, cause, and result—thus surpassing the lower vehicles.
[3533] <prose> This is difficult to realize; therefore it is extensively explained.
[3534] <prose> Ninth: The Instruction of Great Perfection is explained.
[3535] <prose> In self-arising wisdom, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not established.
[3536] <prose> This is wished for as beyond wisdom, liberation, acceptance, and rejection.
[3537] <prose> This itself is not established anywhere.
[3538] <prose> All-liberating wisdom does not cease.
[3539] <prose> Limitlessness beyond view and meditation, wherein primordial wisdom has arisen.
[3540] <prose> All dharmas are realized as equal in pleasure and pain. || 3540 ||
[3541] <prose> This is called the expanse and primordial wisdom of dharma-nature beyond action.
[3542] <prose> Those who also gradually enter into the expanse and primordial wisdom:
[3543] <list> Abiding,
[3544] <list> Emptiness,
[3545] <list> Understanding the entering through seized bliss.
[3546] <prose> This is called the union without superior or inferior, without acceptance or rejection.
[3547] <prose> Through instantaneous entering into the expanse and primordial wisdom, the self-arising dharma-nature is understood as without view and without separation, dharmas exhausted—this is called the instantaneous liberation without cause.
[3548] <prose> Through entering into liberation-attachment, all that is and that which is not is understood, not abandoning all.
[3549] <prose> This is called the liberation-attachment without any cause of obtaining.
[3550] <prose> Through entering into breakthrough, liberation is attained without need for action or effort, through seeing appearances. || 3550 ||
[3551] <prose> This is called Anuyoga: the arising breakthrough that sees dharma-nature.
[3552] <prose> That also: Because the two—expanse and primordial wisdom—are non-different, thus there is the view of non-dual equality.
[3553] <prose> Without coming or going in expanse and primordial wisdom,
[3554] <prose> This is the view of not becoming other than abiding.
[3555] <prose> Without extent or falling to sides in the two—expanse and primordial wisdom—
[3556] <prose> This is the view of abiding from the primordial beginning.
[3557] <prose> Not understood from mere words of reference, without reliance on any single thing, this is called the view without reference point, without basis or separation.
[3558] <prose> The expanse of meaning is the ground.
[3559] <prose> Primordial wisdom is the path; beings who traverse the path are liberated through effort.
[3560] <prose> The expanse is the cause, and primordial wisdom is the result. || 3560 ||
[3561] <prose> Furthermore, upon these very sharp pristine faculties, liberation is attained without reference to outer action, cause, and result—thus it is distinguished and transcends the lower vehicles.
[3562] <prose> This is extensively explained because it is difficult to realize.
[3563] <prose> The ninth is the Instruction of the Great Perfection.
[3564] <prose> In self-arising primordial wisdom, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not established.
[3565] <prose> This is wished for as beyond primordial liberation, acceptance, and rejection.
[3566] <prose> This very one is not established anywhere.
[3567] <prose> All-liberating primordial wisdom does not cease.
[3568] <prose> Expanse and wisdom: two aspects.
[3569] <prose> Non-gathering and non-separation: held as vajra.
[3570] <prose> Door of entry: sudden and gradual. || 3570 ||
[3571] <prose> View of realization: without gathering or separation.
[3572] <prose> What is sudden entry?
[3573] <prose> Deities not produced, essence remembered, complete.
[3574] <prose> What is gradual entry?
[3575] <prose> Expanse and wisdom sequentially entered,
[3576] <prose> Vajra-holder obtains result in the stage.
[3577] <prose> Protecting samaya is thus:
[3578] <prose> Secret mantra meaning-showers always honor.
[3579] <prose> To the secret mantra-teaching guru,
[3580] <prose> Whatever is possessed, offer worship. || 3580 ||
[3581] <prose> Guru and Thus-Gone,
[3582] <prose> Without distinction, one essence shown.
[3583] <prose> Summary: expanse and wisdom.
[3584] <prose> Great scripture Anuyoga's philosophical system.
[3585] <prose> Thus it is.
[3586] <prose> Moreover, Anuyoga's vehicle holds result-producing in one birth as Buddha,
[3587] <prose> Intermediate state as Buddha definite,
[3588] <prose> Finally, through successive births becoming Buddha.
[3589] <ornament> Moreover, regarding liberation-ground's basis, expanse and wisdom,
[3590] <prose> Fabricated phenomena, || 3590 ||
[3591] <prose> Effort and accomplishment,
[3592] <prose> Without transference, emptiness without conception, expanse abiding, self-arisen wisdom dawning,
[3593] <prose> All phenomena basis-posited, self-liberated, great realization,
[3594] <prose> Called effortless self-liberation's expanse and wisdom.
[3595] <prose> Variegated appearances, path's expanse and wisdom,
[3596] <prose> All appearing variegatedly, play without direction, dawning.
[3597] <tantra> From Ati's great array:
[3598] <tantra> "Those-with-mind: mind's category."
[3599] <tantra> "Those-with-sky: space's category."
[3600] <break> <tantra> "Those-without-striving: instruction." || 3600 ||
[3601] <break> <tantra> Thus.
[3602] <prose> Mind Section.
[3603] <prose> Space Section.
[3604] <prose> Instruction Section—three thus.
[3605] <prose> Furthermore: Because there is no dharma other than self-mind elsewhere, this is the various Mind Section.
[3606] <prose> These are merely intended to stop what has changed into other than self-arising mind-primordial wisdom.
[3607] <prose> Because there is no other destination from the space of Samantabhadrī, the all-good-one of dharma-nature, this is the Space Section of speech.
[3608] <prose> These are merely needed to stop other-arising from the space of the expressible dharma-nature.
[3609] <prose> Setting the essential nature at the essential point directly is the Instruction Section.
[3610] <prose> Because these are not the essential point, they are merely intended to stop straying widely elsewhere from the meaning; thus they reach the summit of all. || 3610 ||
[3611] <prose> These do not transgress from the three desires.
[3612] <prose> Through the meaning, answering that the ground, path, result, and liberation are Great Perfection, it is thus called.
[3613] <ornament> Regarding that Mind Section:
[3614] <prose> It is called Great Perfection that speaks of the ground become like a spear.
[3615] <prose> Divided:
[3616] <prose> Great Perfection that speaks of various minds existing, and
[3617] <prose> Great Perfection that speaks of mind's aspect existing—these two.
[3618] <prose> What is meant by "mind exists":
[3619] <prose> Mind-only is meaning that exists, and
[3620] <prose> Non-existence is stopped. || 3620 ||
[3621] <prose> Meaning is thus not established as mind-only.
[3622] <prose> Meaning-only is also not established upon mind.
[3623] <prose> Various minds exist, — yet are not looked upon.
[3624] <prose> Because mind is not established in cause and characteristic, "various minds" is not called; even if called, it is not established.
[3625] <prose> The non-existence of external meaning is called; even conventionally, intellectually examined, it is not established.
[3626] <prose> Because that is various, nothing obstructs.
[3627] <prose> Because mind exists, the various is also not established.
[3628] <prose> This is called Great Perfection beyond acceptance and rejection.
[3629] <prose> Because appearances appear as various, — yet do not depart from the wheel of the single mind, they are understood as various.
[3630] <prose> This is called understanding mind itself as various. || 3630 ||
[3631] <prose> Second mind's aspect exist speaking mind's category.
[3632] <prose> That also: The essence is the direction of appearance.
[3633] <prose> The direction of mind is appearance.
[3634] <prose> Whatever appears is mind.
[3635] <prose> Because mind itself has arisen in self-arising primordial wisdom, the play of mind's aspect is without cessation; this is called self-arising.
[3636] <prose> That divides into six:
[3637] <list> The mind's direction desiring the arising-place of the result-mind;
[3638] <list> The mind's direction beyond deviation and obscuration;
[3639] <list> The mind's direction of confused compounded reasoning;
[3640] <list> The mind's direction of self-arising primordial wisdom without falling to extremes; || 3640 ||
[3641] <list> The mind's direction of direction-holding and self-established objects;
[3642] <list> The mind's direction of distinguishing established tenets free from intellect.
[3643] <ornament> The first:
[3644] <prose> Because there is no place of change in dharma-nature, there is no change in mind. Phenomena are self-liberated. Wishing them to be made, they did not arise. Spontaneously complete, called unconditioned, the ground of the three realms is established. Saṃsāra is without beginning,
[3645] <prose> Spontaneously present,
[3646] <prose> And finally birthless spontaneously-complete ground-establishment is called.
[3647] <prose> That also: Because it is primordially established, there is no repetition.
[3648] <prose> Because it is self-established, there is no antidote.
[3649] <prose> Without effort, without various extremes, spontaneously complete—this is called the wished-for.
[3650] <ornament> Second: || 3650 ||
[3651] <prose> Dharmas deviated from the ground examined by the intellect of eight stages are called.
[3652] <prose> Relying on spontaneously-complete falling to the direction of non-existence,
[3653] <prose> Including the extremes of direction-holding existence, one is deviated.
[3654] <prose> One is deviated into causeless non-existence and self-arising non-existence.
[3655] <prose> This essence, established in mere words of desire, is separate from intellect.
[3656] <prose> Self-arising is unmade by the essential point applied to causes and conditions.
[3657] <prose> Unmade, causeless, primordially pure, separate from obscurations—this is called dharma-nature, the wished-for.
[3658] <prose> That also: Because there is no place departed from dharma-nature within deviation,
[3659] <prose> The ground is beyond result from causelessness.
[3660] <prose> Beyond the path of obscuration, through actions of virtue and vice, whatever stains are without—this is called the ground. || 3660 ||
[3661] <ornament> Third:
[3662] <prose> Through definitely knowing the aspect of mind, the source of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is pressed. This is called.
[3663] <prose> The ground in its natural state is without arrangement.
[3664] <ornament> From that self-nature, wherein self-arising mind-primordial wisdom has arisen everywhere in all directions, there is birthlessness.
[3665] <prose> Actions of virtue and vice are without—this is known.
[3666] <prose> Thus, because appearances appear as various from the birthless mind,
[3667] <prose> The play is without cessation; saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's dharmas are known without accepting.
[3668] <prose> Thus, the characteristic of the play-ground is non-dual; through reasoning, the essence is known as non-different.
[3669] <prose> Thus, the non-dual dharma is not intellectually analyzed.
[3670] <prose> Because the essence itself is self-liberated through reasoning, all is not beyond dharma-nature. || 3670 ||
[3671] <prose> That also: Because the ground is mind itself unaltered through reasoning, it is considered deluded.
[3672] <ornament> Fourth:
[3673] <prose> The play of self-arising primordial wisdom pervades all saṃsāra and nirvāṇa at once, without falling to extremes.
[3674] <prose> Appearances are imputed; spontaneously arisen, without cessation; lower realms are not established.
[3675] <break> <prose> The essence of appearances is different, — yet from direction-tilted self-nature, reasoning has not departed; self-nature is pure.
[3676] <break> <prose> Saṃsāra is emptied.
[3677] <prose> The pervasion does not depart from the view of Great Perfection.
[3678] <prose> That also: Because existence and non-existence, appearance and emptiness are not fallen into directions,
[3679] <prose> This is the wished-for dharma-nature beyond action, pleasure, and pain.
[3680] <ornament> Fifth: || 3680 ||
[3681] <prose> Without seeing the mind's direction, appearances are not divided into saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[3682] <prose> Whatever direction-holding at the object-ground of all objects is not abandoned.
[3683] <prose> The view dwells in the expanse without action or effort.
[3684] <prose> Whatever is and is not appears as various appearances.
[3685] <prose> Because appearances are vast and directionless, self-liberated beyond action and conduct. This is the wished-for self-liberation.
[3686] <ornament> Sixth:
[3687] <prose> Without intellect, objects do not become.
[3688] <prose> Appearances are self-arisen; concepts are self-liberated.
[3689] <prose> The essence of appearances is not established as truth or falsity.
[3690] <prose> Dwelling in limitlessness beyond existence and non-existence, truth and falsity are not established as whatever; this is the wished-for. || 3690 ||
[3691] <break> <prose> Thus, in the Mind Section there are 210,000.
[3692] <break> <prose> There are three spaces.
[3693] <prose> The expanse beyond the expressible dharma-nature is explained:
[3694] <prose> There is no view without the expanse.
[3695] <prose> There is no conduct without the expanse.
[3696] <prose> There are six hundred sections and three hundred divisions.
[3697] <prose> Three emanations:
[3698] <list> The emanation striking the top of the ground of abiding;
[3699] <list> The emanation self-liberated from appearance itself;
[3700] <list> The emanation without dharma-nature equal and non-different. || 3700 ||
[3701] <prose> There are fifty nails without penetrating the dharma-nature.
[3702] <break> <prose> One hundred eleven breaths are applied to the object-mind.
[3703] <break> <prose> One hundred thousand two essential points distinguishing appearance-mind in a single moment.
[3704] <prose> One hundred thousand five applications of view to sphere.
[3705] <prose> One hundred thousand one essential points cutting conceptualization where meditation exists—those named continuums abide in one thousand and three.
[3706] <prose> The grasping of the mind's direction,
[3707] <prose> The grasping of the mind's category,
[3708] <prose> And the grasping of mind's essential point—these three are gathered.
[3709] <ornament> Second: Regarding the result as primordial liberation, the essence of the Great Perfection Space Section is:
[3710] <prose> Without existence having arisen as various, the result is primordially pure; this is the wished-for. || 3710 ||
[3711] <prose> This divides into four:
[3712] <list> Space Black speaking of causelessness;
[3713] <list> Variegated Space speaking of the various;
[3714] <list> White Space speaking of mind;
[3715] <list> The category of Vast Space applied to cause and result.
[3716] <prose> The essence of Black Space is explained:
[3717] <prose> Unchanging, self-perfect, arisen as directionless, not relying on the nature of phenomena.
[3718] <prose> Divided: The category of Black Space of activity,
[3719] <prose> The category of Black Space of compassion,
[3720] <prose> And the category of Black Space of emanation—from these three. || 3720 ||
