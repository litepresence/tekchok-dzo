[36755] <prose> First, there are three aspects:
[36756] <prose> The general presentation of the manner of attainment, || 16330 ||
[36757] <prose> The detailed explanation that it is the result,
[36758] <prose> The explanation of the path as appearance and the avoidance of contradiction.
[36759] <ornament> First:
[36760] <tantra> From the arising-ground of essence, though appearing as the Three Bodies,
[36761] <prose> The demonstration of attainment by the power of purifying stains of the three gates to be purified—
[36762] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[36763] <prose> Furthermore, the sequence of the result:
[36764] <prose> The Dharmakāya is attained by the action of mind, and
[36765] <prose> The Saṃbhogakāya is attained by the aspect of speech;
[36766] <prose> The Emanation Body is by the body. || 16340 ||
[36767] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[36768] <prose> These are called the cause-effect to be purified.
[36769] <prose> By nature it is spontaneous presence; therefore understand that it is impossible to attain by producing through cause and condition.
[36770] <ornament> Second:
[36771] <tantra> From the Pearl-Garland:
[36772] <prose> The result—Three Bodies, five wisdoms—
[36773] <prose> Thus it is spoken, and
[36774] <tantra> From Vajrasattva's mind-mirror:
[36775] <prose> All dharmatā of the result, the Three Bodies irreversible—know this.
[36776] <ornament> Third: || 16350 ||
[36777] <ornament> If asked regarding contradiction with explaining the Three Bodies as path-appearance:
[36778] <prose> Former lamas say,
[36779] <prose> Saying "it is not the result"
[36780] <prose> Refers to freeing from the extreme of attachment to the Three Bodies as result, or
[36781] <prose> Refers to refuting those who consider the three cycles' womb as ultimate; thus avoiding contradiction,
[36782] <prose> Yet placing it as result in meaning
[36783] <prose> Is the display of not considering the essence of primordial purity's inner expanse; therefore very mistaken—not good.
[36784] <prose> Here, as accepted before, path-appearance is also,
[36785] <prose> And it is also the result—without contradiction.
