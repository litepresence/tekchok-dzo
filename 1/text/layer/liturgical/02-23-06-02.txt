[34626] <prose> Second and Third have twenty-four each. || 14200 ||
[34627] <prose> The remaining three have six each, thus divided into portions making one hundred thirty-four.
[34628] <prose> Those also gathered into six groups of six.
[34629] <list> The thirty-six's fifth—the six faculties with outflows,
[34630] <list> The first group's six faculties seeing beyond—thirty without outflows,
[34631] <list> The last, utterly without outflows, should be known.
[34632] <prose> Those from the <tantra> Sun-Moon Union:
[34633] <prose> Thus arising in that manner, the six clairvoyances arise for that class:
[34634] <verse> knowledge of previous realms,
[34635] <verse> death and transmigration,
[34636] <verse> knowledge of birth, || 14210 ||
[34637] <verse> knowledge of others' minds,
[34638] <verse> knowledge of all hidden appearances,
[34639] <verse> seeing and knowing the six realms,
[34640] <verse> clairvoyance of purified faculties—
[34641] <prose> six arise, thus.
[34642] <verse> The fourth: attainment of retentive powers,
[34643] <verse> Previously heard Dharma all appearing simultaneously,
[34644] <verse> Innumerable Dharma categories never before heard also arising,
[34645] <verse> Therefore called the dharmatā bardo,
[34646] <verse> From that itself: at that time, retentive powers of non-forgetting. || 14220 ||
[34647] <verse> Arise in one's own continuum,
[34648] <verse> All previous Dharma appearing simultaneously in the continuum,
[34649] <verse> Likewise, never-before-heard Dharma also arising,
[34650] <verse> Therefore called the dharmatā bardo, thus.
[34651] <verse> The fifth: manner of meditative absorption's arising—
[34652] <verse> At that time, mind's engagement exhausted in the manner of dharmatā's purity,
[34653] <verse> Abiding non-conceptually.
[34654] <verse> The manner of exhaustion:
[34655] <verse> Where exhausted, exhausted in one's own continuum; <verse> How exhausted? The appearance-rain of the above qualities <verse> Exhausted in the manner of dharmatā's purity. <verse> What is that appearance at that time? <verse> The appearance of dharmatā's exhaustion arising, <verse> Bad conceptuality—previous clinging
[34656] <verse> Subsequent grasping, || 14230 ||
[34657] <verse> Good clairvoyance,
[34658] <verse> Recollection, and so forth—
[34659] <verse> Do not arise at all,
[34660] <verse> Like the state of pure space.
[34661] <tantra> From the Sun-Moon Union:
[34662] <verse> Continuous meditative absorption's continuum.
[34663] <verse> Arising as its own nature,
[34664] <verse> Bad conceptuality does not arise at all,
[34665] <verse> Thus.
[34666] <prose> At this point, the liberation and delusion modes of the twenty-one faculties should be known. || 14240 ||
[34667] <prose> As the text is somewhat extensive, shown separately below.
[34668] <verse> The sixth: spontaneous presence's dissolution manner—
[34669] <verse> Previously arisen now gathering within:
[34670] <verse> Dissolution modes eight arising simultaneously.
[34671] <break> <verse> Compassion dissolving into compassion,
[34672] <break> <verse> Like the sun's rays gathering at sunset;
[34673] <break> <verse> The appearance-rain of the six families.
[34674] <break> <verse> Light dissolving into light,
[34675] <verse> Like a rainbow dissolving in space—
[34676] <verse> No trace of light and color signs, || 14250 ||
[34677] <verse> The expanse free from grasping at emptiness,
[34678] <verse> Of single taste;
[34679] <verse> Body dissolving into Body,
[34680] <verse> Like a vase body,
[34681] <verse> Knowables luminous within,
[34682] <verse> No accomplished sign-marked face and hands,
[34683] <verse> Completely pure;
[34684] <verse> Pristine cognition dissolving into pristine cognition,
[34685] <break> <verse> Like a child entering the mother's lap—
[34686] <break> <verse> dharmatā mother and child without duality merged, || 14260 ||
[34687] <verse> No grasping;
[34688] <verse> Non-duality dissolving into non-duality,
[34689] <verse> Like a river dissolving into a river—
[34690] <verse> Liberated from the beginning,
[34691] <verse> Of single taste as Dharmakāya,
[34692] <prose>
[34693] <prose>
[34694] <prose>
[34695] <prose>
[34696] <prose> || 14270 ||
[34697] <prose>
[34698] <prose>
[34699] <prose>
[34700] <prose>
[34701] <prose>
[34702] <break> <prose>
[34703] <break> <prose>
