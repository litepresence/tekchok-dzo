[32251] <ornament> First, the sign of birth in hell:
[32252] <break> <list> At the time of death, the sky gathers with black clouds,
[32253] <break> <prose> And one proceeds as if darkness were spreading.
[32254] <prose> When rain,
[32255] <prose> Mist,
[32256] <prose> Great wind, || 11830 ||
[32257] <prose> Hail, and.
[32258] <prose> Dust-whirlwinds swirl, one takes birth among the eight hot hells,
[32259] <prose> The eight cold hells,
[32260] <prose> The intermittent hells,
[32261] <prose> The neighboring hells,
[32262] <prose> The sentient-being hell Avīci, and.
[32263] <prose> The seven vajra hells.
[32264] <prose> The latter two, although included in the category of the eight hot hells, are distinguished separately due to their long lifespans and great suffering.
[32265] <prose> Moreover, by the karma of immediate actions and so forth; all who take birth in the last of the hot hells dwell for one intermediate kalpa; while those who have abandoned the Dharma remain for billions of hundreds of thousands of kalpas longer—hence it is called the Unbearable Sentient-Being Hell; As proclaimed in the Noble Sūtra of the Transcendence of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines:
[32266] <prose> Through the ripening of the karma of abandoning Dharma, || 11840 ||
[32267] <prose> One takes birth in the great unbearable sentient-being hell,
[32268] <prose> Experiencing unbearable suffering.
[32269] <prose> Even when the great fire-gathering kalpa arises there,
[32270] <prose> One takes birth where the great sentient-being hell exists
[32271] <prose> In the eastern worlds—thus it is proclaimed.
[32272] <prose> To extend throughout the ten directions, limitless and boundless.
[32273] <tantra> Therefore, having entered the gate of Secret Mantra, breaking great samaya with the vajra guru produces long lifespans and great suffering. From the Supreme Samaya Arrangement, the Tree Tantra:
[32274] <tantra> Whoever toward the vajra guru.
[32275] <verse> Bears evil mind, derides,
[32276] <verse> Great samaya-breaking— || 11850 ||
[32277] <break> <verse> As long as from the great ocean.
[32278] <break> <verse> The water is exhausted drop by drop,
[32279] <verse> Strand by strand of hair,
[32280] <verse> That water poured out exhausted—
[32281] <verse> For that many ocean-kalpas.
[32282] <verse> One will dwell,
[32283] <verse> Known as the vajra hell.
[32284] <verse> Thus it is spoken.
[32285] <prose> Second, the sign of birth as a hungry ghost:
[32286] <list> At the time of death, the sky becomes unclear, rays fade like the western sunset; || 11860 ||
[32287] <prose> Sun and moon "die";
[32288] <prose> Yellow clouds obscure, sun and moon invisible;
[32289] <prose> Rain falls with cold traces;
[32290] <prose> Or in the evening, rain falls—
[32291] <prose> These are for hungry ghosts with outer obscuration,
[32292] <prose> Inner obscuration,
[32293] <prose> Sudden obscuration,
[32294] <prose> Distinctive obscuration,
[32295] <prose> Inverted obscuration, and.
[32296] <prose> Karma and karmic-category obscuration— || 11870 ||
[32297] <prose> In these, one takes birth.
[32298] <prose> Third, the sign of animals:
[32299] <list> At the time of life-transference, the sky is gloomy with warmth without oiliness, black clouds gather,
[32300] <prose> Or fog banks obscure,
[32301] <prose> Smoke-form valleys appear blue-gray and one proceeds,
[32302] <prose> Gloomy, joyless sky appearing—one takes birth among creeping creatures with many legs,
[32303] <prose> Without legs,
[32304] <prose> Four-legged,
[32305] <prose> Winged, and.
[32306] <prose> Clawed, and so forth. || 11880 ||
[32307] <prose> Fourth, the sign of birth as a demigod:
[32308] <list> At the time of death, strong wind rises from all directions,
[32309] <prose> Black clouds like terrifying creatures appear,
[32310] <prose> Clouds greatly disturbed, fierce thunder, lightning garlands flash, roaring sounds—
[32311] <prose> Sun and moon's light cloud-obscured,
[32312] <prose> Demigods with five projections,
[32313] <prose> Six faces,
[32314] <prose> Long arms,
[32315] <prose> Great belly-serpent, and.
[32316] <prose> Sky-going long-haired—five take birth. || 11890 ||
[32317] <prose> Fifth, the sign of birth as a god:
[32318] <list> At the time of separating from breath,
[32319] <prose> The sky is clear, sun and moon clear, without yellow wind, directions beautiful, greatly joyful—
[32320] <prose> This is for desire realm gods of six races,
[32321] <prose> Pure realm five,
[32322] <prose> Clear light fifteen, and.
[32323] <prose> Formless four—sign of taking birth-place.
[32324] <prose> Sixth, the sign of birth as a human:
[32325] <list> At the time of death, the sky extremely clear and pure, without yellow dust,
[32326] <prose> Soft white clouds like stretched silk, || 11900 ||
[32327] <prose> Sun and moon with rainbow light—
[32328] <prose> In sequence:
[32329] <prose> Merely human body,
[32330] <prose> Pure,
[32331] <prose> Jewel birth-place—sign of birth.
[32332] <prose> These are the general arrangements.
[32333] <prose> When examined specifically,
[32334] <prose> Bad—wind and.
[32335] <prose> Hail etcetera, sent by angry non-humans, or.
[32336] <prose> Other evil persons dying—these signs may also be possible. || 11910 ||
[32337] <break> <prose> Good—rainbow light and clear sky etcetera, may also be possible for excellent persons transferring to fields, achieving samādhi, life-transference, and so forth.
[32338] <break> <prose> Achieving samādhi,
[32339] <prose> Life-transference, and so forth—
[32340] <prose> Here, possessing the power for signs to arise in one's own mind,
[32341] <prose> While alive, good mind and conduct; at death, good signs of that race—
[32342] <prose> While alive, bad, even if good signs—other's signs arising,
[32343] <prose> In the world called "meeting the rainbow seeker."
[32344] <tantra> From that one's following, learning might arise; therefore these are explained for turning back.
[32345] <tantra> As proclaimed in the Blazing Relics Signs Tantra:
[32346] <verse> Thus for all sentient beings, || 11920 ||
[32347] <verse> When the life-formations are enacted,
[32348] <verse> By the sky's own characteristic.
[32349] <verse> All these exercise in birth-places.
[32350] <verse> Whoever dies, at that time
[32351] <verse> The sky turns gloomy-black, darkness black,
[32352] <verse> Likewise rain and steam and wind,
[32353] <verse> Hail and dust-whirlwinds arise—
[32354] <verse> To whoever these befall,
[32355] <break> <verse> Without intermediate state,
[32356] <break> <verse> They become in hell's birth-place, || 11930 ||
[32357] <verse> O Ḍākinī.
[32358] <verse> Sky like mist, light yellow,
[32359] <verse> Sun and moon die,
[32360] <verse> Without wind and dust,
[32361] <verse> Yellow mist, sun not visible,
[32362] <verse> Rain or traces, or at twilight.
[32363] <verse> These will fall—thus to whoever.
[32364] <verse> These befall, in hungry ghost.
[32365] <verse> Birth-place they are born, O Ḍākinī.
[32366] <verse> Sky gloomy without wind, || 11940 ||
[32367] <verse> Clouds black without gaps,
[32368] <verse> Or mist appears,
[32369] <verse> Gloomy joyless—whoever.
[32370] <verse> Does the life-formation,
[32371] <verse> This is the animal place.
[32372] <verse> Greatly fierce, disturbed by wind,
[32373] <verse> Clouds black-massed, fearful forms,
[32374] <verse> Greatly disturbed with coming-going,
[32375] <verse> Thunder and lightning's tongue protrude,
[32376] <verse> Sun and moon unable to be seen— || 11950 ||
[32377] <verse> Thus to whoever these befall,
[32378] <verse> This is the asura birth-place.
[32379] <verse> Sky clear and pure,
[32380] <verse> Sun and moon's appearance clear,
[32381] <verse> Wind and dust unable to rise,
[32382] <verse> This is the god's birth-place.
[32383] <verse> Also in clear pure sky,
[32384] <verse> Undivided clouds like white silk,
[32385] <verse> Greatly thin, thread-like appear,
[32386] <verse> Or sun and moon with light-housed— || 11960 ||
[32387] <verse> Thus to whoever these befall,
[32388] <verse> This human birth-place is obtained.
[32389] <verse> Thus whoever possesses signs,
[32390] <verse> Is certainly of the six races;
[32391] <verse> Formations without such signs.
[32392] <verse> Are signless and uncertain.
[32393] <verse> Thus all those signs.
[32394] <verse> Come from two to three days,
[32395] <verse> These are signs of birth there.
[32396] <verse> In that birth-place—thus proclaimed. || 11970 ||
[32397] <prose> Even those who die without signs—where they take birth is known by their own karma.
[32398] <prose> Yet at the time of death, the appearance of hell-fire,
[32399] <prose> The appearance of hunger, thirst, and fear,
[32400] <prose> Consciousness becoming gloomy, or thinking one dwells among animals,
[32401] <prose> Or not seeing lands of humans before,
[32402] <prose> Or the experience inside Meru or inside the ocean,
[32403] <prose> Or appearances of seeing inside divine mansions or pleasure groves,
[32404] <prose> Or seeing appearances like white clarity—these are explained in the sūtras as inner signs certain for individual six realms.
[32405] <prose> Also from the tantra sections:
[32406] <prose> Warmth from the soles of the feet, || 11980 ||
[32407] <prose> Teeth,
[32408] <prose> Navel, and.
[32409] <prose> Throat,
[32410] <prose> Between the eyebrows,
[32411] <prose> And dissolving from the crown are said to be signs of taking birthplaces of the six realms.
[32412] <prose> Also, though signs that have arisen appear in agreement with one's own mind, they should be known as certain signs of individual birthplaces.
[32413] <tantra> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[32414] <verse> Thus concludes the twenty-second chapter: The Certain Establishment of the Arrangement of Signs of the Three Times.
[32415] <verse> Thus having shown the sequence of signs, the method of liberation in this life for those of excellent faculties, effort, and places of the general instruction,
[32416] <verse> Now, for establishing extensively the Dharma arrangement of completely perfect buddhahood in the bardo for those of medium faculties, there are two: || 11990 ||
[32417] <verse> The general establishment of the intermediate state and.
[32418] <verse> The extensive explanation of individual natures.
[32419] <verse> First, regarding the essence of the intermediate state:
[32420] <verse> Definition,
[32421] <verse> Division,
[32422] <verse> Appearance pattern,
[32423] <verse> And ground boundary—five aspects.
[32424] <prose> Thus have been extensively shown the arrangement of signs of the three times.
[32425] <break> <verse> Definition,
[32426] <break> <verse> Division, || 12000 ||
[32427] <verse> Appearance pattern,
[32428] <verse> And ground boundary—four aspects.
