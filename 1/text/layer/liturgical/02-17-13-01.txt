[24135] <prose> First, viewing outer phenomena, one sees phenomena as without self-nature.
[24136] <prose> Moreover, viewing phenomena in parts with the vajra-eye, one sees appearance as the eight similes of illusion, || 3710 ||
[24137] <prose> Realizing that delusion is not truly established, without doubt of returning to the three realms—mind at ease.
[24138] <prose> Viewing particular phenomena with the eye of prajñā,
[24139] <prose> Realizing conventional appearance as groundless, great primordial purity—
[24140] <prose> Mind at ease, obtaining rigpa without action imprints or latencies.
[24141] <tantra> From the Sun-Moon Union:
[24142] <prose> The outer view is like this:
[24143] <prose> Regarding objects that appear as referents,
[24144] <verse> Whoever becomes familiar with them as without self-nature,
[24145] <verse> By this, appearance and emptiness are non-dual.
[24146] <verse> The six collections unobstructed, relaxed. || 3720 ||
[24147] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24148] <tantra> From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[24149] <prose> Regarding phenomena appearing as characteristics,
[24150] <verse> Sense-power of the eye not ceasing,
[24151] <verse> This is the excellent view of mind.
[24152] <verse> Self's own rigpa clear,
[24153] <verse> Miracle of outer appearance,
[24154] <verse> From the essence of concept-free clarity,
[24155] <verse> Knowing as great self-arisen—
[24156] <verse> This is the view of viewing phenomena. || 3730 ||
[24157] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24158] <break>
[24159] <prose> Second, viewing inner dharmatā, one sees the absence of self-nature with the eye of wisdom,
[24160] <prose> Realizing that there is no mind of grasping even in self-awareness,
[24161] <prose> Mind at ease in the nature of exhausted dharmas.
[24162] <tantra> From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[24163] <prose> Dharmatā, rigpa, without arising,
[24164] <verse> Concepts and characteristics naturally absent,
[24165] <verse> Rigpa without negation or affirmation—
[24166] <verse> Where is there clinging conduct? || 3740 ||
[24167] <verse> Thinking of dharmatā
[24168] <verse> Should be known as the nature without doing.
[24169] <verse> Rigpa free from action and actor,
[24170] <verse> Not falling in any direction—
[24171] <verse> This is called great meditation.
[24172] <verse> Moreover, that which realizes is like this:
[24173] <verse> By the prajñā of single concept,
[24174] <verse> Mind becomes depth-confident, and
[24175] <verse> If dharmatā without arising is realized,
[24176] <verse> Great wisdom will arise. || 3750 ||
[24177] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24178] <break>
[24179] <prose> Third, viewing secret rigpa, one sees non-duality of expanse and rigpa,
[24180] <prose> Definitively deciding that Buddha is not obtained by intellectual words.
[24181] <prose> Seeing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as primordially pure, exhausted dharmas—mind at ease.
[24182] <tantra> From the Sun-Moon Union:
[24183] <prose> Whoever sees expanse and rigpa,
[24184] <verse> By this, becomes familiar with the Buddha ground.
[24185] <verse> Beyond this, no other method,
[24186] <verse> Surpassing distinctions of mind-grasping. || 3760 ||
[24187] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24188] <tantra> From the Seng-ge Tsal Dzog:
[24189] <prose> The ultimate view of all Buddhas
[24190] <verse> Does not transcend the two: expanse and rigpa.
[24191] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24192] <prose> Having named such views, it is called the view of cutting the continuum of the city—
[24193] <prose> Cutting the continuum of the womb-city, not returning to the three realms, becoming Buddha in this very life.
[24194] <tantra> From the Sun-Moon Union:
[24195] <verse> For the best, the two births are not needed;
[24196] <verse> The intermediate, in between the two births. || 3770 ||
[24197] <verse> The last, having exhaled the breath,
[24198] <verse> The emanator liberates their own continuum.
[24199] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24200] <break>
[24201] <prose> Second, regarding the essential point instruction for placing mountains:
[24202] <prose> All determined by view, uncorrupted, appearance in immediacy,
[24203] <verse> Rigpa placed in immediacy of rigpa,
[24204] <prose> The intentions of all vehicles gather there, seeing the meaning of all in that nature,
[24205] <prose> Others do not see this meaning.
[24206] <prose> For example, just as from the peak of the mountain king, lower valleys are seen simultaneously, || 3780 ||
[24207] <prose> But from the valley the mountain peak is not seen,
[24208] <prose> So from the aspect of Great Perfection primordial liberation, spontaneously accomplished,
[24209] <prose> One realizes the preferences of the nine vehicles in one's own system;
[24210] <prose> Other vehicles do not realize this intention,
[24211] <prose> Completing the great liberation of the three realms.
[24212] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[24213] <verse> To mind that exists as view,
[24214] <verse> Appearance-existence self-arisen as one,
[24215] <verse> The three realms liberated in their own place.
[24216] <verse> This is the great self-placed Ati. || 3790 ||
[24217] <verse> To mind that exists as placed,
[24218] <verse> Appearance self-placed, arising as ground,
[24219] <verse> In the view of the great equal placement,
[24220] <verse> Without seeking, it is perfected.
[24221] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24222] <break>
[24223] <prose> Third, the intention of the complete liberation of the three realms:
[24224] <verse> Thus viewed by the yogin who realizes,
[24225] <prose> There is nothing unliberated; transcending the very ground of bondage and liberation—
[24226] <prose> Great self-appearance without ground, seeing the nature of dream-illusion or sky. || 3800 ||
[24227] <prose> This completes the intention of Klong-chen Equal to Space.
[24228] <tantra> From the Six Expanses:
[24229] <verse> To mind without arising and ceasing,
[24230] <verse> Unthought clear seeing appearing,
[24231] <verse> The intention of exhausted going and coming—
[24232] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[24233] <verse> To mind without grasping,
[24234] <verse> Unceasing pure appearance,
[24235] <verse> Great playful samādhi—
[24236] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach. || 3810 ||
[24237] <verse> To mind without holding,
[24238] <verse> Self-arisen great appearance,
[24239] <verse> Unceasing non-conceptual intention—
[24240] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[24241] <verse> To mind without affliction,
[24242] <verse> Appearance free of self-concept,
[24243] <verse> The intention of great self-placement—
[24244] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[24245] <verse> To mind without eternalism or nihilism,
[24246] <verse> Appearance free of good and bad, || 3820 ||
[24247] <verse> The intention free of acceptance and rejection—
[24248] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[24249] <verse> To mind without adopting or rejecting,
[24250] <verse> Directionless self-liberated appearance,
[24251] <verse> The intention of great universal pervasion—
[24252] <verse> Samantabhadra I teach.
[24253] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24254] <break>
[24255] <prose> Fourth, the result of afflictions pure in their place:
[24256] <prose> At that time, without abandoning afflictions, not dwelling in them, || 3830 ||
[24257] <prose> Pure in place, like clouds dissolving in sky or sediment settling in water.
[24258] <prose> First, delusion not experienced;
[24259] <prose> Now, not dwelling in delusion;
[24260] <prose> Finally, delusion impossible—arriving at the ground.
[24261] <prose> This is called the person who has cast off dharmas.
[24262] <tantra> From the same text:
[24263] <verse> To mind of dharmatā-appearance,
[24264] <verse> Bliss and ego-grasping self-purified.
[24265] <verse> To mind of self-appearance,
[24266] <verse> Clinging thoughts self-purified. || 3840 ||
[24267] <verse> To mind of no-self appearance,
[24268] <verse> Parts and aspects self-purified.
[24269] <verse> To mind of contaminated appearance,
[24270] <verse> Arisen elements self-purified.
[24271] <verse> To mind of uncontaminated appearance,
[24272] <verse> Deluded conditions, stains self-purified.
[24273] <verse> Thus it is said.
[24274] <break>
[24275] <prose> This is the result of demonstrating the view.
[24276] <prose> The fourth meaning: the yoga of continuous conduct regarding the result has four aspects: || 3850 ||
[24277] <list> The result of naturally pure; the essential point instruction of placing rigpa; the intention of three realms pure as ground; the result of afflictions self-liberated.
