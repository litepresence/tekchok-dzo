[29505] <prose> From the first pure red,
[29506] <verse> Perfect empowerment, round, complete self-clear. || 9080 ||
[29507] <verse> From two pure fingers, becomes three.
[29508] <verse> Then by pressing again and again,
[29509] <verse> The colors of the five wisdoms—
[29510] <verse> White, red, green, blue, and yellow—
[29511] <verse> Appear in the field through effort.
[29512] <verse> Then also outer, without effort,
[29513] <verse> Going and coming by wind's portion,
[29514] <verse> From mirror-pure shapes,
[29515] <verse> Appear as portions of two and three.
[29516] <verse> From constant familiarity with that itself, || 9090 ||
[29517] <verse> Also by the five-color light,
[29518] <verse> From mere slice, edge-cut appears,
[29519] <verse> See measure from mere field-edge.
[29520] <verse> From finding familiarity's measure from that,
[29521] <verse> With body to bindu center,
[29522] <verse> Abide while in pure half-body,
[29523] <verse> To that with five-five pairs,
[29524] <verse> Connect with very clear bindu,
[29525] <verse> Possessing father-mother body-appearance,
[29526] <verse> Pure field from delusion-appearance ceasing. || 9100 ||
[29527] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29528] <prose> At the time of all these, the formerly demonstrated measures and sign-manners all arise.
[29529] <prose> Wisdom-perfect appearance, space, and
[29530] <prose> Dharmatā pure appearance, awareness, and
[29531] <prose> Bindu-ripen appearance, from body reaching measure as mandala,
[29532] <prose> Again conducting dharmatā cease-appearance.
[29533] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[29534] <verse> Wisdom-perfect appearance and
[29535] <verse> From dharmatā's first appearance,
[29536] <verse> From three appearances perfecting, become ceasing. || 9110 ||
[29537] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29538] <verse> At this time, body-speech-mind measures.
[29539] <verse> When seeing individual appearances,
[29540] <verse> Signs complete by ripening in self,
[29541] <verse> Ceasing measures all manifestly appear.
[29542] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29543] <prose> Thus by taking experience, those with supreme effort: three years.
[29544] <prose> Middle ones: five years.
[29545] <prose> Last ones: seven years, eleven months,
[29546] <prose> Six days: seeing dharmatā cease-appearance, liberating into light-body. || 9120 ||
[29547] <tantra> From that same source:
[29548] <verse> By great and small effort in this,
[29549] <verse> By days, months, and years,
[29550] <verse> Certainly accomplish at individual times.
[29551] <verse> From times without much moving,
[29552] <verse> Reach individual measures.
[29553] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29554] <prose> This is the great essential point of secret experience-taking.
[29555] <ornament> Third: Determining the day-night wheel manner has four aspects:
[29556] <list> Gathering sense-faculties to the essential point of the continuum, closing memory's door. || 9130 ||
[29557] <list> Putting knowable objects in the vase at dawn, wisdom clear directly.
[29558] <list> At morning, demonstrating clear wisdom, all arisen feelings pure in self-place.
[29559] <list> Striking with vast appearance by day,
[29560] <list> Suppressing all signs.
[29561] <prose> Though these were explained formerly,
[29562] <prose> Here also explained as thögal companion, summarizing: taking experience,
[29563] <prose> There is distinction slightly different from former.
[29564] <prose> Daytime, looking at the manifest by elephant-gaze,
[29565] <prose> Releasing to self-ceasing delusion-appearances, suppressing signs.
[29566] <prose> Nighttime, placing cognition on the bindu-empty lamp. || 9140 ||
[29567] <prose> When that bindu expands, cognition also expands clear portion.
[29568] <prose> When decreasing, cognition goes increasingly subtle. In the state of going to referenceless end, equipoise without thought of emanating or gathering references.
[29569] <prose> As sleep approaches, placing mind in the state of dissolving empty bindu at the forehead center,
[29570] <prose> Seize the essence of sleep-luminosity.
[29571] <prose> At midnight, holding mind to the luminosity within the heart and sleeping,
[29572] <prose> Dreams liberate into luminosity, the continuum of habits ceasing.
[29573] <prose> Then at dawn, by lion's gaze casting consciousness to a white AH in the bow-span of sky,
[29574] <prose> The meaning free of clear-empty elaboration arises from within.
[29575] <prose> Meditate abiding in that state for as long as possible.
[29576] <tantra> From the Six Expanses: || 9150 ||
[29577] <verse> Pressing the bodily posture,
[29578] <verse> Cast consciousness to the range of sky.
[29579] <verse> Likewise, eyes to the space between,
[29580] <verse> By elephant gaze
[29581] <verse> Place in great spreading without memory.
[29582] <verse> Thus cast awareness to sky.
[29583] <verse> Without separating from this,
[29584] <verse> The yogin who meditates continuously
[29585] <verse> Expands appearances by day.
[29586] <verse> At nighttime, in one's own dwelling, || 9160 ||
[29587] <verse> To hold the measure of four equal times,
[29588] <verse> Gathering sense doors oneself,
[29589] <verse> To the lamp of empty bindu,
[29590] <verse> The endowed yogin places mind.
[29591] <verse> When that bindu expands,
[29592] <verse> Place consciousness expanding as well.
[29593] <verse> When bindu becomes subtle,
[29594] <verse> Bindu increasingly subtle,
[29595] <verse> Place consciousness increasingly subtle.
[29596] <verse> By essential point of sleep and dream, || 9170 ||
[29597] <verse> Extract root of former attachment habits.
[29598] <verse> Thus in all times of night,
[29599] <verse> The fortunate endowed yogin acts.
[29600] <break> <verse> By this, reach self-expansion of appearances.
[29601] <break> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29602] <prose> Thus by taking experience in the day-night wheel continuum,
[29603] <prose> Delusory appearances self-cease, liberating into luminosity.
[29604] <tantra> From that same source:
[29605] <verse> By body, field, and awareness,
[29606] <verse> Hold all measures of pure self-appearance. || 9180 ||
[29607] <verse> Having grasped the measure of self-appearance thus,
[29608] <verse> Appearances of six classes' delusion cease.
[29609] <verse> At the time of ceasing that,
[29610] <verse> Awareness reaches the measure.
[29611] <verse> When thus reaching the measure,
[29612] <verse> One's own body also does not appear.
[29613] <break> <verse> The flesh-blood body produced by elements
[29614] <break> <verse> Because elements are pure in their own place,
[29615] <verse> Because this appears as field,
[29616] <verse> The mind-body grasped by delusion || 9190 ||
[29617] <verse> Because elements dissolve in their own place,
[29618] <verse> This also dissolves, not appearing in its own place.
[29619] <verse> The light-body grasped by awareness
[29620] <verse> Is like the water-moon mandala.
[29621] <verse> At this time, near dharmatā cessation,
[29622] <verse> Whoever becomes familiar with this, Buddha-field.
[29623] <break> <verse> Then, having exhausted the three bodies' limits,
[29624] <break> <verse> Obtain the action-free perfect body.
[29625] <verse> At this time, all limits of body
[29626] <verse> Are near to freedom. || 9200 ||
[29627] <verse> The yogin familiar with the base
[29628] <verse> Also empties one's own place.
[29629] <verse> The yogin familiar with the path
[29630] <verse> Exhausts coarse elemental stains.
[29631] <verse> Whoever is familiar with the fruit
[29632] <verse> Reaches the non-return ground by this.
[29633] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29634] <prose> Moreover, the distinction between light-body and samādhi-body: the light-body, awareness's self-light without stain, is beyond the range of sentient beings' sight, visible only to Buddha-eye,
[29635] <prose> While the samādhi god-body should be understood as having the distinction of appearing to those with god-eye among sentient beings possessing very clear, pervasive particles of the four elements produced by ripening habit-continuum.
[29636] <break> <ornament> Third: Extensively explaining the wisdom wheel of profound expanse has three aspects: || 9210 ||
[29637] <break> <list> Briefly demonstrating the essence,
[29638] <list> Extensively explaining the nature,
[29639] <list> Summarizing the meaning by aspect.
[29640] <ornament> First:
[29641] <tantra> From the Lion Power-Perfect:
[29642] <verse> Also, what are the five intentions?
[29643] <verse> By intention of mountain's general meaning, transcend through view.
[29644] <verse> By intention of wisdom's general filling, grasp the ground.
[29645] <verse> By intention of bindu's range-penetration, examine the manner of appearance arising.
[29646] <verse> By intention of sun-moon equal gap, deliver to meaning's end. || 9220 ||
[29647] <verse> By intention of ocean expanse-penetration, deliver awareness to space. Thus it is spoken.
[29648] <ornament> Second, from five:
