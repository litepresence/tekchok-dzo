[24348] <prose> Now, again, for those free from elaborations, the excellent path of rigpa's self-appearance—the secret great Vajra Essence—is shown in two aspects:
[24349] <prose> The manner of being definitely superior through surpassing common vehicles,
[24350] <prose> And the explanation of the path itself that possesses distinctions.
[24351] <ornament> First:
[24352] <prose> Through seven pith instructions, this path surpasses all others.
[24353] <list> Other paths, though possessing great wisdom, quickly realize yet liberate only partially; those of lesser wisdom do not liberate. This path, through the pith of direct perception, depends not on effort great or small, nor on sense-powers sharp or dull—thus this is the first pith.
[24354] <list> Others rely on intellectual confidence in self-dharmatā, casting emptiness meditation like a dark stone. This path, not relying on mind's intellectual assessment, directly exists as direct perception—thus not relying on intellect is the pith.
[24355] <list> Others rely progressively on words that express, hoping to primordially realize meaning. This path, not relying on a single letter, directly sees meaning—thus words do not make Buddha, which is the pith.
[24356] <list> Others make the meaning of self-natural-state into a mind-object, relying on time to distinguish ground, path, and fruit. This path, directly becoming self-clear, does not rely on mind-made thought's ground and path—thus buddhahood without reliance is the pith. || 3930 ||
[24357] <list> Others, relying before and after on cause and effect, seek enlightenment elsewhere. This path, not relying on good or bad actions of cause and effect, self-dawns enlightenment—thus effort and acceptance-rejection do not exist, which is the pith.
[24358] <list> Others rely on channels, winds, and bindus, spreading in youth to accomplish enlightenment; aging, their power exhausts, and they do not liberate. This path, through self-arising clear light's sun and moon dawning from within, possesses effort—thus aging, old or young, does not exist, which is the razor's pith.
[24359] <list> Others rely on regarding the final fruit as the three bodies. This path, the three bodies dawning as path-appearance, final clear light primordially-pure vastness spontaneously-accomplishing rigpa's definite establishment—this is the pith.
[24360] <prose> Thus, through the greatness of these seven, from Śrāvaka vehicle through the nine progressive stages of outer and inner Secret Mantra, this path surpasses all.
[24361] <ornament> Oh, but if this is also Ati,
[24362] <prose> Does it surpass Ati as well?
[24363] <prose> Regarding Ati also: from the three sections of Mind, Vast Expanse, and Instruction,
[24364] <list> The Mind section establishes confidence in the wide ground-free expanse; rigpa is directly seen. Mind breathes once, self-clear, dwelling thus.
[24365] <list> Unchanging, nine changes dawn as the final aim—thus regarding meaning, direct seeing-not through intellect only.
[24366] <prose> The Instruction section also: || 3940 ||
[24367] <list> Outer, inner, and secret circles of three rely on the bardo time.
[24368] <list> This path possesses the pith of liberating as the light-body—thus this surpasses through distinction.
[24369] <prose> Briefly, the piths are inconceivable; though surpassing, names cannot capture them, so elaboration ceases here.
[24370] <prose> Regarding channels and winds: common paths rely on coarse conventional channels and winds, doing body training and so forth with much effort, creating many obstacles and deviations.
[24371] <prose> This path, abandoning the coarse, through three unmoving piths binds only that, not making it the path—
[24372] <prose> Ultimate wisdom's channels and winds, beyond grasping and effort, are made the path, training the body to purity of light.
[24373] <prose> Not relying on common delusion-illusions, obstacle-clearing, and so forth—
[24374] <list> Obstacles are delusion; delusion is suffering.
[24375] <list> That delusion's channels and winds are made the path—elements arising from making delusion the path.
[24376] <prose> This path, making ultimate non-delusion the path, has no obstacles or deviations. || 3950 ||
[24377] <prose> Deviations also: those relying on mind-made intellect, not seeing meaning, deviate into paths of equality-duality and forms of experience-realization, making knowing-experience chief—thus not crossing the ridge of deviation-obstacle.
[24378] <prose> This path, directly seen through sense-powers, has no deviation or deviation-place—meaning definitely directly arrived at.
[24379] <prose> Deviating is arising on the path where meaning seeks to go—this path does not have that.
[24380] <prose> Delusion-place does not exist here: not establishing path-measure on raw-ri knowing-experience, instant change-return—
[24381] <prose> For clear light's self-resonance, appearance-experience without deception, is certainty-grasped.
[24382] <prose> Unlike the six applications and so forth:
[24383] <list> Wind-resonance and
[24384] <list> Rigpa-resonance have distinction—jewel-light and
[24385] <list> Lamp-light have distinction.
[24386] <prose> Delusion-appearance, rigpa's impure energy-resonance made the path, does not liberate; || 3960 ||
[24387] <prose> Pure appearance, clear light's actual resonance made the path, liberates.
[24388] <prose> These distinctions are illustrated:
[24389] <tantra> From the Definite Explanation:
[24390] <tantra> "In the light of jewel and lamp,
[24391] <tantra> The jewel-mind directly flows;
[24392] <tantra> Although no distinction in wrong knowing,
[24393] <tantra> How great the distinction in meaning-doing!"
[24394] <prose> Thus spoke the Victor.
[24395] <prose> Thus, distinction-great seven with countless small distinctions—superior.
[24396] <tantra> From the Thalgyur: || 3970 ||
[24397] <tantra> "Through the pith of dharmatā directly,
[24398] <tantra> Good and bad in action are not realized;
[24399] <tantra> Through the heart-essence's definite summary,
[24400] <tantra> Sense-powers sharp and dull are not;
[24401] <tantra> Intellect and word's extremes exhausted,
[24402] <tantra> Not wisdom—sense-powers see;
[24403] <tantra> Dharmatā not seen through words,
[24404] <tantra> Common vehicle's meaning not accomplished;
[24405] <tantra> The three bodies path-appearance,
[24406] <tantra> Seeing this, the three realms do not reverse; || 3980 ||
[24407] <tantra> All dharmas equal, taste one,
[24408] <tantra> Ground and fruit without reference."
[24409] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[24410] <prose> Second: explaining the path itself possessing distinctions has two aspects:
[24411] <list> The presentation of empowerments that ripen the unripened,
[24412] <list> And the presentation of instructions that liberate the ripened.
[24413] <prose> First: empowerments and their companion samaya—two.
[24414] <prose> Although extensively explained before, here, since the connection is important, summarized:
[24415] <prose> Those persons whose minds have reversed from saṃsāra, free from attachment to this world, desiring to obtain the meaning of Dharma simultaneously—
[24416] <prose> First, to a guru possessing characteristics, empowerment should be completely received. || 3990 ||
[24417] <prose> Before that, through elaboration-possessing outer empowerment, relying on maṇḍala and vase,
[24418] <prose> Body-empowerment, the body obtaining power as the yidam's body—
[24419] <prose> Outer container, palace clear,
[24420] <prose> Inner body, deity's body Mahāmudra clear—arise.
[24421] <prose> That is the pith-instruction's key point: freeing the yogin from body, illusion, and bindu.
[24422] <prose> Then, inner elaboration-free empowerment, relying on maṇḍala and vase, empowerment to speech—
[24423] <prose> Speech yidam's recitation clear,
[24424] <prose> Inner inexpressible meaning's experience arising.
[24425] <prose> Relying on the letter A's expression, it arises.
[24426] <prose> Then, secret very-elaboration empowerment, relying on signs and dependent-connection, empowerment to mind— || 4000 ||
[24427] <prose> Mind, phenomena's nature, arrives at the top;
[24428] <prose> Mind, clear light's great meaning, experienced.
[24429] <prose> Then, secret supreme: body-posture and
[24430] <prose> Gaze-reliance, empowerment to body, speech, and mind three—
[24431] <prose> Body-posture's pith reliance: liberating into the three bodies' postures;
[24432] <prose> Speech, relying on speaking-ceased, sound's power exhausted,
[24433] <break> <prose> Inexpressible meaning understood;
[24434] <break> <prose> Mind, relying on sign's pith, blessing-energized,
[24435] <prose> Clear light emptiness: what essence is not established—
[24436] <prose> This is aimed at ripening the mantra-path. || 4010 ||
[24437] <prose> Thus: body's ripening complete, arising-stage instant clear;
[24438] <prose> Speech's ripening complete, uncommon power arising;
[24439] <prose> Mind's ripening complete, completion-stage's signs and measures arrived at.
[24440] <prose> Body, speech, mind, and sems' ripening complete,
[24441] <prose> Dharmatā-direct path's experience completely perfect.
[24442] <prose> Second: that companion, samaya's sequence—
[24443] <prose> That ripening-complete support, relying on samaya continuum:
[24444] <prose> Generally, samaya's root is root-guru—
[24445] <prose> Through desiring meaning's siddhi,
[24446] <prose> Guru pleased, siddhi arises. || 4020 ||
[24447] <tantra> From the Dakinī Net-Thousand Tantra:
[24448] <tantra> "Those desiring siddhi, to the guru
[24449] <tantra> Should worship until the end of time."
[24450] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[24451] <prose> That also does not transcend body, speech, and mind three.
[24452] <prose> Body's conduct and so forth, pleasing the guru:
[24453] <list> Preparing the seat,
[24454] <list> Offering maṇḍala,
[24455] <list> Washing service,
[24456] <list> Water-washing, || 4030 ||
[24457] <list> Gaze-prostration,
[24458] <list> Sight-prostration, and so forth should be done.
[24459] <prose> Gaze-prostration: when the guru gazes at oneself, prostrating;
[24460] <prose> Sight-prostration: when one sees one's guru.
[24461] <prose> Speech's expression, pleasing the guru:
[24462] <list> Not the guru's faults,
[24463] <list> Focusing on qualities,
[24464] <list> Distinction-words should be expressed.
[24465] <prose> Yidam-knowledge, pleasing:
[24466] <list> Following the guru's activities, || 4040 ||
[24467] <list> Guru pleased, intent on others' entry,
[24468] <list> And others, by any means, made to enter with faith in the guru.
[24469] <prose> Guru's speech-utterance expertise:
[24470] <list> Words without excess or lack, able to express to others;
[24471] <list> Guru's heart-intent, as it is, taking into experience—does not transcend this.
[24472] <tantra> From the Great Samaya Tantra:
[24473] <tantra> "As to the guru's action,
[24474] <tantra> With body, speech, and mind pure,
[24475] <tantra> The respectful person to supreme guru
[24476] <tantra> Becomes the vajra-holder." || 4050 ||
[24477] <tantra> And also:
[24478] <tantra> "Those possessing faith, desiring siddhi,
[24479] <tantra> From pleasing the guru it arises;
[24480] <tantra> If the guru is not pleased,
[24481] <tantra> Continually wandering saṃsāra's edge."
[24482] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[24483] <prose> That also: empowerment time, quality-offering and
[24484] <prose> Feast-doing, and so forth, pleasing the guru;
[24485] <prose> Vajra siblings and
[24486] <prose> Other beings also should be delighted. || 4060 ||
[24487] <prose> Thus done, becoming Secret Mantra's samaya,
[24488] <prose> Blessing-entering support becomes special.
[24489] <tantra> "Great compassion, great feast."
[24490] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[24491] <prose> Thus, empowerment-received samaya's sequence, as shown before, should be kept.
[24492] <prose> Second: the presentation of instructions that liberate that ripening—two aspects:
[24493] <list> Instruction-general's link-establishment,
[24494] <list> And practice experience-taking.
[24495] <prose> First: all introduction-instruction hitting-manners summarized, three:
[24496] <list> Hitting in the guiding manner, || 4070 ||
[24497] <list> Hitting in the introduction manner,
[24498] <list> Hitting completely for the guest-challenge.
[24499] <prose> Within the first, the latter two gather:
[24500] <list> Hitting introduction instantaneously: Direct-Cut, Thögal;
[24501] <list> Hitting completely: bardo instructions.
[24502] <prose> Second: practice experience-taking—
[24503] <list> Preliminaries and
[24504] <list> Actual experience-taking progressive.
[24505] <prose> First has two aspects:
[24506] <ornament> Preliminaries' reasoning; || 4080 ||
[24507] <prose> Preliminaries actual.
[24508] <prose> First, three from:
[24509] <prose> Preliminaries: for example, like preparing fear when going a terrifying path before, so the mind goes easily on the path—
[24510] <prose> Making the actual without fear or anxiety.
[24511] <prose> Preliminaries: for example, like a tooth-gap village, ditch-fear guarding done, becoming strong, opportunity not found by whatever—
[24512] <prose> Thus doing the actual, inner mind ease, no hardship—like preliminaries.
[24513] <prose> Preliminaries and actual, two definite;
[24514] <prose> Preliminaries: like good fear-deliverer;
[24515] <prose> Actual: like possessing substance, final arrival.
[24516] <prose> That also: without preliminaries, though actual distinction-pith exists, || 4090 ||
[24517] <prose> Like unable to go a terrifying path without deliverer;
[24518] <prose> Without actual-meaning's pith, though preliminary instruction used, fruit does not arise—
[24519] <prose> Thus those two, pair-related, meaning accomplished: like world's farming, male-female pair-union accomplishing.
[24520] <prose> Second: preliminaries actual—
[24521] <list> Who goes before,
[24522] <list> How preliminaries are,
[24523] <list> Example: what like,
[24524] <list> Preliminaries' purpose,
[24525] <list> Supreme distinction: five.
[24526] <prose> First: what goes before? World-transcending preliminaries go before—method aiming at nirvāṇa. || 4100 ||
[24527] <prose> That also: three gates' grasping not liberated, not transcending saṃsāra—
[24528] <prose> Body, speech, mind three bound, liberation: definitely exiting existence—supreme transcending preliminaries.
[24529] <prose> Second: how are preliminaries?
[24530] <prose> Before: eons countless, accumulated body, speech, mind's sin liberating—thus called "before."
[24531] <prose> When: before existence-attachment time, body-dwelling, million beings' actions and imprints purifying—thus called "before."
[24532] <prose> Speech's sounds impure purifying—also called "before."
[24533] <prose> Mind-dweller, body-within dwelling, four million insects' mind-movements impure purifying—thus called "before."
[24534] <prose> Goes: actual before, or first, that instruction needing to learn—thus "goes."
[24535] <prose> Before-going, actual-meaning effort-not arising, nirvāṇa-going—thus also called "goes."
[24536] <prose> Third: example—like a merit-possessing king, though urged by others, whatever doing, before not going, powerless to not go; || 4110 ||
[24537] <prose> Like a good horse, before going, equipment-adorned, urged, goes—
[24538] <prose> Actual's before-going.
[24539] <prose> Fourth: purpose—
[24540] <prose> Actual trainable easily, arising confidence, without obstacles.
[24541] <prose> Fifth: distinction, three:
[24542] <list> Three bodies' guiding: training in four elements' yoga;
[24543] <list> Rigpa's guiding: training in saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundary-dividing conduct;
[24544] <list> Mind's guiding: training in body, speech, mind three's natural-state.
[24545] <prose> First:
[24546] <tantra> From the Thalgyur: || 4120 ||
[24547] <tantra> "The three bodies' training progressive itself,
[24548] <tantra> Arising's quality chiefly making,
[24549] <tantra> Supreme earth, water, fire, wind
[24550] <tantra> Sound-trained, definitely accomplish."
[24551] <prose> Thus the four sounds' yoga-doing progressive spoke.
[24552] <prose> Second: from that itself—
[24553] <tantra> "Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundary not divided,
[24554] <tantra> Three realms, body, speech, mind,
[24555] <tantra> Connection cut, not becoming—
[24556] <tantra> Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundary dividing explained." || 4130 ||
[24557] <ornament> Thus it is said, and:
[24558] <tantra> From the Demonstration Child:
[24559] <tantra> "Thus also, in secret meaning,
[24560] <tantra> Desiring to enter, supreme vessel,
[24561] <break> <tantra> Before, body, speech, mind's
[24562] <break> <tantra> Manifest grasping, reversing for,
[24563] <tantra> Before, conduct should begin."
[24564] <ornament> Thus it is said, and:
[24565] <tantra> From the Lamp Blaze:
[24566] <tantra> "Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundary divided, || 4140 ||
[24567] <tantra> Body, speech settled."
[24568] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[24569] <prose> This: three from—
[24570] <prose> First, training in the four elements' yoga that guides the three bodies.
[24571] <prose> From the Thalgyur: "The progressive training of the three bodies itself,
[24572] <prose> Making chief the arising's qualities,
[24573] <prose> Supreme earth, water, fire, wind—
[24574] <prose> Trained in sound, definitely accomplish."
[24575] <prose> Thus spoke the manner of doing yoga with the four sounds.
[24576] <prose> Second: from that itself— || 4150 ||
[24577] <prose> "If saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's boundary is not divided,
[24578] <prose> The three realms with body, speech, and mind
[24579] <prose> Connection not cut, not becoming—
[24580] <prose> Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa boundary dividing is explained."
[24581] <prose> Thus it is said.
