[26840] <prose> First, if there is a cause,
[26841] <prose> If there is a cause, compounded things are impermanent. Thus they disintegrate. Merit and demerit in action are without inherent existence.
[26842] <prose> Without reversal, the aggregates of sentient beings could not arise. They are immeasurable. This is unreasonable.
[26843] <prose> If mind were manifold, self and other conceptions could not arise simultaneously. In the same being this is unreasonable.
[26844] <prose> Through mutual intermingling,
[26845] <prose> Self-arising,
[26846] <prose> Non-death, || 6420 ||
[26847] <prose> Absence of suffering,
[26848] <prose> If one possessed retinues, enjoyments, and such, there would be joy;
[26849] <prose> If others were defeated and such, there would be common conceptions; this arising is unreasonable.
[26850] <prose> If [mind] were different,
[26851] <prose> Since there are many beings,
[26852] <prose> Some would experience self-defeat, joy in harmony with others, and such; this would be reasonable.
[26853] <prose> If mind were one only, would one death mean all die?
[26854] <prose> Would one birth mean all are born?
[26855] <prose> Thus, through numerous approaches of analysis regarding one and many in one's own mind, having investigated and searched,
[26856] <prose> Finding nothing is the realization by the faculty of wisdom that dharmatā is pure from the beginning. || 6430 ||
[26857] <prose> Since there is no cause in mind and reversal is impossible, there is endless confidence. The accumulation of karma continues.
[26858] <prose> If there were a cause in mind, results would necessarily arise;
[26859] <prose> If the result is saṃsāra, it is impure and liberation is impossible.
[26860] <prose> If it has passed, saṃsāra arising is unreasonable.
[26861] <prose> If it is both,
[26862] <prose> Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa would appear different, and mind too would become different.
[26863] <prose> If it is different,
[26864] <prose> Just as body and mind are different, so too would desires gathered into one nature become many. They would become different things.
[26865] <prose> Knowing that they gather into one nature.
[26866] <prose> One may object: "If there is no cause in mind, these minds are unreasonable." || 6440 ||
[26867] <prose> These do not arise from a cause of mind, for they are not mind.
[26868] <prose> If they are not mind-originated, there is no non-realization of mind merely abiding as such.
[26869] <prose> These are neither exhaustion of
[26870] <prose> Birth,
[26871] <prose> Death,
[26872] <prose> Abiding, and such, nor are they increase.
[26873] <prose> Thus the scriptures declare:
[26874] <tantra> "In this deluded confabulation of ignorance there is neither exhaustion nor increase."
[26875] <prose> And again:
[26876] <tantra> "The nature of the realm of sentient beings is also without end." || 6450 ||
[26877] <prose> Thus knowing that without cause there is no increase in mind;
[26878] <prose> Knowing no increase, there is no birth;
[26879] <prose> Knowing no birth, there is no death;
[26880] <prose> Knowing this, one knows there is no evil in action.
[26881] <tantra> "This dharma is free from both existence and non-existence."
[26882] <prose> Thus knowing that from the beginning there has never been any self,
[26883] <tantra> "Since pure from the start, how could sentient beings be born?"
[26884] <prose> Furthermore, there is no condition for mind;
[26885] <prose> Furthermore, if there were conditions, just as appearances appear as manifold, so too would mind become manifold. Through conditions of color and such;
[26886] <prose> Mind having become different, recollection and thought could not be gathered into one. || 6460 ||
[26887] <prose> If there were conditions in mind, it would become certain destruction;
[26888] <prose> Thus the karma and result of mind would be nonexistent—absurd!
[26889] <prose> If mind were destroyed but its karma remained,
[26890] <prose> This would be greatly contradictory,
[26891] <prose> Like saying the body, its color, faculties—all good and bad—remain though the body is destroyed.
[26892] <prose> Therefore, merely abiding like illusion, it is clear.
[26893] <prose> One may ask: Without conditions, from what do these manifold present recollections and thoughts arise?
[26894] <prose> These present recollections and thoughts do not arise from conditions;
[26895] <prose> Like the joy and holding-as-real upon finding a jewel in last night's dream,
[26896] <prose> Upon waking, there is nothing at all; || 6470 ||
[26897] <prose> So too, even if one clings to these present recollections and thoughts as real, afterward there is nothing.
[26898] <prose> They are accomplished merely through appearing as the seeming truth of the occasion.
[26899] <prose> For example, just as various clouds in the sky suddenly gather and without going anywhere suddenly dissolve,
[26900] <prose> Though those clouds are nonexistent in the sky, they appear within it;
[26901] <prose> Though conditions and causes are nonexistent in mind, they appear as appearing—
[26902] <prose> At that time, causes and conditions are nonexistent, ascertained as nonexistent through analysis of one, many, and the three times.
[26903] <tantra> "From neither a destroyed nor non-destroyed seed does a sprout arise; all dharmas you have taught arise like illusions."
[26904] <tantra> "The fifth condition does not exist."
[26905] <tantra> "The path supreme, peaceful, without cause and condition."
[26906] <prose> Therefore, if mind exists, || 6480 ||
[26907] <prose> Does it exist as a material thing or
[26908] <prose> As immaterial?
[26909] <prose> It does not exist as material — for if it did, it would be visible to the sense organs — yet the valid cognition of direct perception does not perceive what should be visible.
[26910] <prose> If it exists as immaterial, how is it known?
[26911] <prose> One may say: "Movement is known."
[26912] <prose> That movement is analyzed as contact of moments, directions, and
[26913] <prose> The three times—past, future, and present—and is not established.
[26914] <prose> If prior movement meets present movement, the prior recollection of the meeting moment must exist now;
[26915] <prose> If it exists, it contradicts being prior;
[26916] <prose> That meeting moment of the prior and present having ceased is absurd; || 6490 ||
[26917] <prose> If they do not meet, present recollections would have no cause, and movement would be unreasonable—absurd!
[26918] <prose> Is movement one or different?
[26919] <prose> If one, the variety of movement is impossible;
[26920] <prose> If different, since there is one mover, it is impossible.
[26921] <prose> Thus mind is not established as existent;
[26922] <prose> Realized as rootless, like space,
[26923] <prose> Without birth and birthplace, there is no ground of reversal.
[26924] <prose> Without it, through recognition between prior and later recollections, they dissolve there;
[26925] <prose> Thus one realizes mind is without ground, and having realized this, one gains confidence without ground of reversal.
[26926] <prose> Knowing this, the three realms are decisively resolved as the Great Nameless. || 6500 ||
[26927] <prose> Knowing this dharma, there is no benefit or harm in virtuous or non-virtuous action—awareness at ease.
[26928] <prose> Furthermore, through recognition between prior and later appearances and awareness,
[26929] <prose> One realizes mind is not established as cause or characteristic;
[26930] <prose> Knowing this, one gains confidence without reference point in mind-as-emptiness;
[26931] <prose> Having gained this confidence, one is decisively resolved that mind has not arisen from causes and conditions;
[26932] <prose> Knowing this dharma, there is no benefit or harm from adventitious conceptual thoughts—awareness at ease.
[26933] <prose> Furthermore, awareness at ease!
[26934] <prose> Through recognition between prior and later mind,
[26935] <prose> One realizes mind is without root;
[26936] <prose> Knowing this, one gains confidence that the various proliferations in the wheel of mind-as-one are not different; || 6510 ||
[26937] <prose> Having gained this confidence, one is decisively resolved that fabricated dharmas will not achieve awakening;
[26938] <prose> Being decisively resolved, since there is no partial non-realization in the meaning of mindlessness, awareness is at ease.
[26939] <prose> Furthermore, through recognition between prior and later dharmatā,
[26940] <prose> One realizes mind is without birth;
[26941] <prose> Knowing this, one gains confidence that habitual tendencies will not harm the Kunzhi body;
[26942] <prose> Having gained this confidence, one is decisively resolved that mind cannot arise;
[26943] <prose> Being decisively resolved, mind is like a small house. There is no reversal. There is no ground of reversal. Awareness is at ease.
[26944] <prose> Thus, having comprehended the measure of the four times of mind's existence,
[26945] <prose> Without buddhas, buddhas are not even mere names;
[26946] <prose> The mind that holds hope for results is reversed; || 6520 ||
[26947] <prose> Through this reversal, there are no dharmas of deliberate effort on the path.
[26948] <prose> Thus, for the dharma of nonexistence, since there is nothing at all, designations of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are merely names. Having found nothing in the meaning, this is called "the measure of liberation."
[26949] <prose> Therefore, since there is nothing at all in mind-as-nonexistence,
[26950] <prose> Since there is no reason in mind, it is not an object of sight;
[26951] <prose> Thus the recognition of fourfold nonexistence,
[26952] <prose> Knowing the sixteen dharmic subjects,
[26953] <prose> Is the destruction of mind's small house—
[26954] <break> <prose> Like a child's sandcastle being built and destroyed.
[26955] <break> <prose> This is like iron destroying iron, or
[26956] <break> <prose> Impermanence destroying impermanence, like a magician destroying the magician's city; || 6530 ||
[26957] <break> <prose> Fabrication destroying impermanence is like heaping corpse upon corpse;
[26958] <prose> Impermanence destroying fabrication is like present awareness destroying prior ignorance.
[26959] <prose> Thus, through mind destroying mind, both cease without trace, like writing on water;
[26960] <prose> Therefore, searching for nonexistence yet finding nothing is like a poor person searching for the wish-fulfilling jewel. It is not in their house. There is no place to find it;
[26961] <prose> For mind-as-nonexistence, there is no place to destroy,
[26962] <prose> Like there being no place to grasp when waves collapse upon water.
[26963] <prose> Therefore, without knowing the meaning of mindlessness,
[26964] <prose> Seeking view, meditation, and conduct in mind
[26965] <prose> Will never find the teachings of the Great Bliss of Liberation;
[26966] <break> <prose> Like grasping at water when the boat sinks, || 6540 ||
[26967] <break> <prose> Taking existence as a support in mindlessness itself is deception and binding.
[26968] <tantra> "Holding appearance as dharmakāya is obscuration for me; holding whatever appears as mind is obscuration for me; desiring other than self-arising is obscuration for me."
[26969] <prose> One may ask: Then is "dissolving mind" not becoming nonexistent from existent?
[26970] <prose> Dissolving, if analyzed as before, is not established;
[26971] <prose> If not analyzed, it is merely the dissolution of adventitious recollective thoughts;
[26972] <prose> Mind has never become nonexistent from being existent in its own continuum;
[26973] <prose> There is no cause of dissolution nor condition of dissolution anywhere.
[26974] <prose> One may object: Then there is no need to destroy mind's small house. For there is nothing to destroy.
[26975] <prose> For mind is nonexistent from the beginning;
[26976] <prose> Merely realizing the nature of nonexistence, || 6550 ||
[26977] <prose> Not that there exists a ground or thing of mind's small house;
[26978] <prose> Since the source of recollection becomes dharmatā,
[26979] <prose> Having made nonexistence understood,
[26980] <prose> Conventionally this is called "destroying the small house";
[26981] <prose> Destroying existence—there is nothing at all.
[26982] <prose> Therefore, through placing whatever appearing object-point appears as the seeming result of convention upon that appearance,
[26983] <prose> Without grasping at material appearance, the result of non-duality of object and mind;
[26984] <prose> Through placing upon the ground of whatever awareness arises,
[26985] <prose> Mind's small house self-dissolves—the result of awareness-awakening of movement;
[26986] <prose> Thus, having realized the ground of dissolution of non-dual wisdom of material-awareness, the result of nonexistence. || 6560 ||
[26987] <prose> Thus the time of the three results too is recognition at the time of dissolution in the four key points of recognition.
[26988] <prose> Know the sixteen dharmas of nonexistence as before.
[26989] <prose> This is the severance of mind's nonexistence, self-awakened, from the Great Secret Certainty Heart Essence instructions.
[26990] <prose> Knowing movement as adventitiously liberated from the beginning;
[26991] <prose> Other instructions say mind is ultimately nonexistent, conventionally existent,
[26992] <prose> Making view and meditation the path of mind—these two are merely contradictory in claiming self-liberation, self-arising, self-settling.
[26993] <prose> They are not ultimately contradictory,
[26994] <prose> Here making nonexistent, there holding existence as nonexistence.
[26995] <prose> Union too:
[26996] <prose> There, holding existence as two related to one, desiring such union; || 6570 ||
[26997] <prose> Here, since nonexistent from the beginning, there is nothing to unite;
[26998] <prose> In the nature of nonexistence, without partiality of difference, non-dual union is called "union."
[26999] <break> <prose> This key point is supreme among all vehicles, most crucial and essential;
[27000] <break> <tantra> From this, not holding appearance as mind, and
[27001] <prose> Not experiencing mind as existent is taught as the great ground-awakening.
[27002] <prose> Relying upon this, recognizing appearance as mind and
[27003] <prose> Recognizing mind-as-emptiness is to be known as the Heart Essence intention.
[27004] <prose> If any instruction appears thus, know it as merely provisional, not ultimate—decisively resolved.
[27005] <prose> Wherein, third, external appearances arising as the mirror of awareness, the six collections as the great equality, vast and pervasive:
[27006] <prose> External various appearances, || 6580 ||
[27007] <prose> Internal adventitious recollective thoughts,
[27008] <prose> The six sense-faculties with their objects—all
[27009] <prose> Are merely clear appearance of nonexistence,
[27010] <prose> Without anything existing internally or externally, like the hair-faults of one with ophthalmia, like
[27011] <prose> Illusion,
[27012] <prose> Mirage,
[27013] <prose> Optical illusion—
[27014] <prose> Appearing to mind yet
[27015] <prose> Thus, at the time of appearing, from that very time, transcending the extremes of existence and nonexistence, one should know;
[27016] <prose> However designated from the side of appearance, it does not contradict; || 6590 ||
[27017] <prose> Let it be existent,
[27018] <prose> Let it be nonexistent,
[27019] <prose> Let it be existent,
[27020] <prose> Let it be nonexistent,
[27021] <prose> Let it appear,
[27022] <prose> Let it be empty,
[27023] <prose> Let it be deluded,
[27024] <prose> Let it be liberated,
[27025] <prose> Let it be good,
[27026] <prose> Let it be bad, || 6600 ||
[27027] <prose> Let it be mind,
[27028] <prose> Let it be other,
[27029] <prose> However designated,
[27030] <tantra> From the side of emptiness, as designated, it is empty from the start;
[27031] <prose> Designation is mind;
[27032] <prose> Mind is nonexistent;
[27033] <break> <prose> Without a designator for the nonexistent, like the actions of a dream and the actions of illusion.
[27034] <prose> Appearance and arising,
[27035] <prose> Virtue and non-virtue and such—these very things are adventitious;
[27036] <prose> Their nature, groundless, self-dissolves; || 6610 ||
[27037] <prose> If realized as existing in the dynamic energy of awareness's self-resonance, intention-dharmatā does not depend on anything;
[27038] <prose> The great appearance of all phenomenal saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dharmas self-arising and self-appearing as the clear appearance of nonexistence in the nature of awareness:
[27039] <prose> Like the appearances of the four elements abiding in the nature of space,
[27040] <prose> Like various dreams not moving from the nature of sleep and
[27041] <prose> Awareness of sleep;
[27042] <prose> Though all self-appear on the face of awareness,
[27043] <prose> Awareness does not see deluded appearance as saṃsāra,
[27044] <prose> Does not see pure appearance as beyond,
[27045] <break> <prose> Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa do not see awareness;
[27046] <prose> All unmoving in the nature of the groundless great equality, || 6620 ||
[27047] <prose> Unestablished in essence, transcending seen and seer,
[27048] <prose> Arising from the nature of awareness, merely designated as the self-resonance. The display of awareness of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa;
[27049] <prose> Great liberation from existence-nonexistence extremes,
[27050] <prose> Designation does not contradict,
[27051] <prose> Not established in meaning,
[27052] <prose> Merely clear appearance of nonexistence—the arising of all saṃsāra-nirvāṇa dharmas.
[27053] <tantra> "In the mind of stainless purity, appearance free from object-conditions is called the intention of great self-purity—I, Samantabhadra, teach this."
[27054] <tantra> "The thing that is nothing at all, not falling into any direction; the thing that deludes as anything, merely appearing as common appearance; yet its meaning does not arise; appearing like the ornament of dharmadhātu."
[27055] <tantra> "The great emptiness wisdom: from nothing at all, anything can delude."
[27056] <tantra> "That is me, that is beings; that is mind, that is mind-originated; that is manifold, that is singular; saṃsāra and nirvāṇa am I myself; maṇḍalas and such are gradual entry; <tantra> That is dharma, appearing as dharma; that is abiding, that is moving; that is sitting, sleeping, and walking; that is life, that is indeed cutting; the three worlds are born from that; <tantra> In short, all dharmas however appearing arise from that." || 6630 ||
[27057] <tantra> "The great elements of earth, water, fire, wind, and space arise from that."
[27058] <tantra> "Thus in dharmatā so abiding — delusion is nonexistent from the start; in dharmakāya like space — adventitious sentient beings are obscured by clouds; even dharmatā not deluded in abiding appears to mind as the manner of delusion."
[27059] <tantra> "The five afflictions of sentient beings do not exist in meaning — like clouds in space, they are merely adventitious with conditions — knowing those clouds arise from space itself and dissolve into space is called the nature of indivisible oneness."
[27060] <tantra> "Thus knowing self-arising, self-pacified affliction-defilements, how could sentient beings be bound?"
[27061] <prose> As appearance-manner is unestablished,
[27062] <prose> Though appearing as grasping, it is not established anywhere;
[27063] <prose> The great non-referential is also taught:
[27064] <tantra> "This mind without abiding, wondrous! No destination, wondrous; <tantra> To the six entering minds without support, wondrous; To the Kunzhi gathering all without placement, wondrous; <tantra> To the circling, deluding ignorance without power of change, wondrous; To all object-fixating afflictions without root-ground, wondrous; <tantra> To subtle and coarse defilements without accumulation, wondrous; To the coarse elemental forms without reference, wondrous; <tantra> To the life-force supported by person without time-allotment, wondrous; To the six collections' object-appearances without permanence, wondrous; <tantra> To the person's arising thoughts and feelings without exhaustion, wondrous!"
[27065] <prose> Therefore, <tantra> "This rootless dharmatā, wondrous in not seeking, naturally settled! To the going and coming awareness without limit, wondrous! To the great primordial wisdom without antidote, wondrous!"
[27066] <tantra> "As in the sky without the slightest cloud — suddenly a cloud-maṇḍala appears; arising and ceasing — investigate from where that cloud-maṇḍala first arose; know all dharmas are thus." || 6640 ||
[27067] <tantra> "As a person dwelling in an echo-cavern — from singing, speaking, laughing, and crying — depending on conditions echoes arise, yet that sound never departs from the sound; know all dharmas are thus."
[27068] <prose> Second, pointing out the wisdom of exhaustion beyond mind. The great natural direct wisdom without change—threefold:
[27069] <prose> Pointing out awareness, the natural direct exhaustion beyond mind;
[27070] <prose> Sustaining the intention of self-clear abiding as the great vast openness;
[27071] <prose> Establishing the wheel of three-key dharmatā as the great space-equal vast expanse.
[27072] <ornament> First:
[27073] <prose> The self-abiding awareness self-clear, naturally settled,
[27074] <prose> Not projecting outward,
[27075] <prose> Not gathering inward,
[27076] <prose> Not contemplating in-between—looking at self-face, || 6650 ||
[27077] <prose> External-internal without distinction,
[27078] <prose> Self-clear natural directness,
[27079] <prose> Dharmakāya unmoved by view-meditation,
[27080] <prose> Wisdom unmoved by conceptual thought,
[27081] <prose> Intention unfabricated by projection-gathering,
[27082] <prose> Clear without thought,
[27083] <prose> Abiding without grasping,
[27084] <prose> Vast without losing spaciousness,
[27085] <prose> Equal without partiality,
[27086] <prose> Great self-resonance without entering agent, || 6660 ||
[27087] <prose> The great intention of primordial self-abiding,
[27088] <prose> Clear and pure like the ocean,
[27089] <prose> Pristine and pure like sun and moon,
[27090] <prose> Vast and spacious like space,
[27091] <prose> Stable and abiding like the king of mountains.
[27092] <prose> Though all sentient beings have never been separated from such meaning even for an instant, primordially existing in themselves,
[27093] <prose> Not knowing their own face, they are confounded by saṃsāra's bad conceptual proliferation;
[27094] <prose> Now, through the lama's instructions having recognized their own face, whether arising, abiding, or stirring, in any time of natural settled equipoise,
[27095] <prose> Without distraction, sustain the nature.
[27096] <tantra> "Ah! Lion, path without traverse; Lion without deliberate action; Upon the white snows without abandonment-settlement, three powers of dispelling darkness perfected; I, the thoughtless clear lion, upon the pure snows of primordial purity, three powers of dispelling elements perfected!" || 6670 ||
[27097] <tantra> "In the mind of no eternalism-nihilism, appearance free from good-bad is called the intention free from acceptance-rejection—I, Samantabhadra, teach this; <tantra> In the mind without accepting-rejecting, directionless self-liberated appearance is called the intention of great vast openness—I, Samantabhadra, teach this; <tantra> In the mind without torpor-excitement, the meditation of great equanimity is called the intention of six collections' natural flow—I, Samantabhadra, teach this; <tantra> In the mind without fear-hope, appearance free from expectation-doubt is called the intention of primordial settled confidence—I, Samantabhadra, teach this."
[27098] <tantra> "This nature of reality free from grasping-clinging, the dharma of buddhas' non-dual intention; individually empty, characteristics beyond word-path; effortless dharmatā self-pure in its own place; entering the object of bodhi-samādhi dharmatā; pure and impure conventionally nonexistent as dharmas; the meaning of primordial abiding transcending one and two; in one's own body-nature, dissolving into a single bindu; timeless realization, samādhi undistracted clarity; without extreme-center, dharmatā nameless; unchanging, pervading all directly; not fabricated, spontaneously accomplished in arising-place."
[27099] <prose> Second, sustaining in that nature—threefold:
[27100] <prose> Sustaining view-meditation as great object-transcendence;
[27101] <prose> Sustaining samādhi as great self-abiding;
[27102] <prose> Sustaining intention as great beyond-mind.
[27103] <ornament> First:
[27104] <prose> In that recognition-nature, without entering mind's grasping-deliberation and deliberate meditation antidotes, awareness vast and wide, primordially settled, height and depth, spaciousness without partiality, self-dissolved self-settled.
[27105] <prose> Consequently, <tantra> "Vast! Dharmatā completely pure! Great! View is wondrous! Appearance! Self-appearance is the maṇḍala itself! Object and non-object completely pure! External and internal without distinction, clearly appearing! Empty and non-empty beyond words!"
[27106] <tantra> "Wherever is the first ground, there the last goes; now abiding in that meaning." || 6680 ||
[27107] <tantra> "In the grasping-concept-free sky, in the consciousness-free sky, awareness-mind unmoved is the supreme samādhi without distraction—the single way of the buddhas."
[27108] <prose> Second, three aspects:
[27109] <prose> Natural settled equipoise:
[27110] <prose> Wherein, without fabrication-effort of grasping at the six collections' object-appearances, external-internal without distinction, naturally dissolved, spaciously settled,
[27111] <prose> Even when going to sleep, abiding in that nature, dreams arise as clear light.
[27112] <prose> Great thunder-descent:
[27113] <prose> Loosing the three doors naturally, whatever arises meeting immediately, self-dissolved, spaciously gone—knowing this nature.
[27114] <prose> Appearance spreading-increasing:
[27115] <prose> Moreover, body in vajra posture, eyes gazing at space between eyebrows, cutting mind's projection-gathering, knowing the nature of awareness self-dissolved half-awake, binding the five winds into space,
[27116] <prose> Self-appearance pure clear light—externally smoke, mirage, rainbow light and such; internally dharmatā empty-clear pure appearance arising thus. || 6690 ||
[27117] <tantra> "Train thus in the three samādhis: Natural settled equipoise samādhi: not blocking the sense doors, not engaging in bodily conduct, not abandoning sleep either; mind not cut off elsewhere; in short, body and speech in their own place, not losing outgoing mind-parts; for the six sense objects too, unmoved mind of clear knowing conduct; in the great non-conceptual self-appearance, clarity without thought, experientially arisen."
[27118] <tantra> "In the great thunder-descent samādhi: body like ordinary; speech free from spoken words; mind not tightly bound—self-arising, self-pure without distraction. Appearance spreading-increasing samādhi: body, object, and awareness taking the measure of self-appearance purity."
[27119] <prose> Third, sustaining intention as beyond-mind—fourfold:
[27120] <prose> View of mountain-settled equipoise;
[27121] <prose> Intention of ocean-settled equipoise;
[27122] <prose> Instruction of awareness-settled equipoise;
[27123] <prose> Method of appearance-settled equipoise.
[27124] <ornament> First: Having recognized this self-clear awareness, whatever arises is placed in the unmoving manner like the king of mountains—view without letters:
[27125] <tantra> "Mountain-settled equipoise view is secret; without doubt, change is naturally absent."
[27126] <ornament> Second: Body in vajra posture, eyes gazing wide at the space between eyebrows, knowing awareness half-awake like the ocean unmoved by waves, placed in that vast equipoise: || 6700 ||
[27127] <tantra> "Ocean-settled equipoise intention: not appearance, yet makes appearance; not emptiness, yet not existing as emptiness; not clarity, yet object of great clarity; not torpor, excitement naturally absent. Unmoved, unmoving, unchanging; unshaken, unshakable, transcending all movement. Not made by doing, look at the great method of settling; without projecting-gathering, in the nature of single equipoise; not abiding, yet not transcending that. In secret wisdom like the ocean, place in the expanse primordially spontaneously accomplished, unmoved. From the great ocean of unfathomable depth, look at the peak of the banner without setting. The great body of unaltered emptiness without emptiness-mind, victorious over all doing through non-doing. Primordially unarisen, unaltered equipoise; appearance unmodified, mind unaltered—intention shown when dharmatā abides in space. Through wisdom of dharmakāya completely abandoning thought, without that which changes, is the intention of meditation; not holding the sphere of appearing objects and focal points; like planets and stars arising in the ocean's depth, non-grasping clarity not ceasing—thus is the abiding manner of self-arisen intention."
[27128] <ornament> Third: That wisdom of clear-emptiness awareness, naturally loose, recognized as directly clear—cutting the target of mind-fixation in samādhi, dharmakāya of natural directness arising from within:
[27129] <tantra> "Through looking far at the manifold objects of self-awareness, dharmakāya without thought, great, is found within."
[27130] <ornament> Furthermore, fourth: Looking intensely at the five external objects, internally self-clear naturally loose, half-awake arising from within—placed in that nature:
[27131] <tantra> "Through looking far at the clear-empty dharmatā object, awareness free from manifold is seen within."
[27132] <tantra> "The great method of awareness-settled equipoise appearance: not the ground of all great appearances; appearing like the path of five elements' Buddha; the five greats not that, appearing clearly; place in great non-grasping without distraction."
[27133] <prose> Third, establishing the wheel of three-key dharmatā as the great space-equal vast expanse—threefold:
[27134] <prose> Instructions placing mind-as-freedom-from-action through the key point of dharmatā free from effort;
[27135] <prose> Instructions of conceptual thought arising as wisdom through the key point of dharmatā self-immediately liberated;
[27136] <prose> Instructions of appearance without negation-assertion through the key point of dharmatā self-liberated from its own place. || 6710 ||
[27137] <ornament> First: That nature free from doing what is to be done is not realized through doing; settling in non-doing, through realization, the three doors are placed in self-abiding spaciousness:
[27138] <tantra> "Furthermore, dharmatā free from action: through non-action, liberated in liberation."
[27139] <tantra> "Therefore, when saṃsāra-nirvāṇa is free from action and agent, what is there to do other than Great Perfection?"
[27140] <break> <tantra> "Through freedom from action, the ground is established."
[27141] <break> <ornament> Second: Recognizing appearance as the display of mind; recognizing display as groundless clear appearance; recognizing clear appearance as delusion when grasped; recognizing ungrasped self-clear as empty appearance—decisively resolved that external objects, appearing mind, are not established as other, the sphere of birth in saṃsāra is empty.
[27142] <prose> Furthermore, recognizing grasping mind as groundless; recognizing groundless emptiness as self-liberated; recognizing self-liberated traceless as primordially liberated—the saṃsāra-maker, one's own mind, groundlessly liberated, the three realms echo as nameless dharmatā:
[27143] <tantra> "Conception without object, peaceful nature of dharmatā; appearing to self, self-appearance without thing; mind free from appearing, dharmatā's own meaning; without projecting-gathering, look at your own object."
[27144] <prose> Here some recognize appearance as mind, recognize mind as emptiness, and from the boasting of recognition—
[27145] <prose> Through recognizing appearance as mind, mind arrives at deliverance;
[27146] <prose> Through recognizing mind as emptiness, emptiness expands the bliss; || 6720 ||
[27147] <prose> Through recognizing emptiness as awareness, awareness and expanse non-dual, that itself is dharmakāya—they cling to words as meaning's own mark.
[27148] <prose> Here there is ground of intention, purpose, logical fault, three exist—therefore not approaching the Heart Essence intention.
[27149] <prose> The ground of intention: for the sake of leading those grasping external objects as other, thus it was spoken;
[27150] <tantra> "In some places, appearance is taught as mind."
[27151] <prose> That too is merely designated from appearance being nothing other, appearing to deluded mind.
[27152] <prose> The purpose is merely to abandon clinging to external objects as real.
[27153] <prose> The logical fault: if appearance is mind, then color, shape and such would necessarily be determined by eye and other sense organs, for appearance is determined as shape, color and such;
[27154] <prose> Appearance is mind, mind is emptiness, emptiness is awareness—if these three, through mutual intermingling, awareness becomes delusion;
[27155] <prose> Thus, appearance not seen by eye and such, mind not deluded—these three being essentially one substance, therefore.
[27156] <prose> This distinction was explained in detail before. || 6730 ||
[27157] <prose> Those making appearance-mind yoga do not liberate:
[27158] <tantra> "The yoga of appearance-mind: all arise from my mind; if mind is realized, what is there to do? Those who proclaim this everywhere—I have not taught them as liberated."
[27159] <prose> Also contradicted: when mind is realized as nonexistent, appearance would be nonexistent;
[27160] <prose> When mind ceases, appearance would cease at that time;
[27161] <prose> Appearance existing at the time of mind's nonexistence also contradicts.
[27162] <prose> There are five occasions of mind's nonexistence:
[27163] <tantra> "Mindless sleep and fainting; two-fold meditative equipoise; perpetual non-conceptual."
[27164] <prose> In summary:
[27165] <prose> Holding appearance as mind is the great darkness of wrong thought—must be abandoned.
[27166] <prose> Third, instructions of appearance without negation-assertion through the key point of dharmatā self-liberated from its own place: || 6740 ||
[27167] <prose> The five external objects, empty, self-pure like the moon in water—need not be purified;
[27168] <prose> Internal mind's recollections and thoughts, self-liberated traceless—need not be destroyed by effort or antidote;
[27169] <prose> Appearing-mind primordially liberated, spontaneously flowing—need not add acceptance-rejection;
[27170] <prose> Therefore, awareness naked and bare, without clothing of elaboration—loosening from within the great equality, traceless, equal, the five doors enter as self-arisen dynamic energy.
[27171] <prose> That too: internally, the nature of self-clear awareness naturally loose, from that nature, whatever arises of good or bad recollections and thoughts, without partiality, as self-arisen wisdom's self-resonance, without following after—
[27172] <prose> Appearing-mind neither trembling nor agitated,
[27173] <prose> Neither advancing nor retreating,
[27174] <prose> In the expansive echoing swoop,
[27175] <prose> The intention of Samantabhadra self-arises as expanse:
[27176] <tantra> "The great self-appearance of all sentient beings; no place to search elsewhere. Through their own power, self-knowing, from wherever in the three-thousandfold world, searching for that itself, no place to find. The objects of action of all worlds, in the nature of that very appearance, whoever does not see—this appearing-nature is the blissful pure land. The yogin who meditates on this sees the body of Samantabhadra me, through having the good fortune." || 6750 ||
[27177] <tantra> "When conditions and thoughts self-arise in objects, knowing all these are without nature, all appearances are like illusions, dreams, and reflections—the experience of non-conceptual great reflection. To whose mind it arises, appearances are thunder-descent, conditions not arising in the mind, obtaining samādhi of non-return."
[27178] <tantra> "All arising, deluded appearance is my mind; all abiding, deluded appearance is my heart; all appearing, deluded appearance is my body; all sounding, deluded appearance is my speech. Unceasing seeing appears like my form; unceasing hearing sounds like my voice; unceasing smelling feels like my scent; unceasing tasting resounds like my taste; unceasing feeling is swift like my mind; secret afflictions are my magical display; buddhas and sentient beings are my charnel ground; all-doing me is the great self-clear appearance."
[27179] <prose> One may ask: Then, having allowed deluded appearance to remain in its own place, will it not become deluded again?
[27180] <prose> Wherein, though ordinary sentient beings become deluded through grasping at self, yogins, knowing groundlessness, without alteration, place in self-abiding—therefore not deluded:
[27181] <tantra> "Those sentient beings in saṃsāra are bound by their own conceptual thoughts; knowing they are without nature, they are certainly liberated."
[27182] <prose> Furthermore, delusion and liberation are counted in inner knowing, not in external appearance;
[27183] <prose> External appearance has never made delusion or liberation—therefore, leaving appearance as it is suffices:
[27184] <tantra> "Appearance does not bind; clinging binds. Cut the clinging, Naropa."
[27185] <prose> Moreover, that too: merely placing the meaning of reality, one's own knowing awareness, in the nature of self-clarity;
[27186] <prose> Cannot be made better by deliberate view-meditation-conduct of alteration, for the nature cannot be changed; || 6760 ||
[27187] <prose> For self-arisen wisdom would become false:
[27188] <tantra> "Through thought, wisdom's meaning is not found; if wisdom's meaning is found through thought, self-arisen wisdom becomes false. Through meditation, dharmakāya is not seen; if dharmakāya is seen through meditation, self-appearance dharmatā becomes false. Through looking, awareness's meaning is not realized; if awareness's meaning is realized through looking, unceasing dharmakāya becomes false. Through dharma, ignorance is not cut; if ignorance is cut through dharma, primordially pure wisdom becomes false."
[27189] <prose> Thus, through realizing appearance-awareness as dharmatā, however one conducts conduct, it does not transcend dharmatā;
[27190] <prose> However appearing-manifestation appears, it arises as unceasing display;
[27191] <prose> Arising as the maṇḍala of self-arisen meaning:
[27192] <prose> Eating and drinking, dharmatā's approach;
[27193] <prose> Sleeping and abiding, bodhi's accomplishment;
[27194] <prose> Composites, deity's meditation;
[27195] <prose> Spittle and phlegm, maṇḍala's accomplishment;
[27196] <prose> The three thousand worlds, spontaneously accomplished maṇḍala; || 6770 ||
[27197] <prose> Rain and water-vapor, self-abiding splashing;
[27198] <prose> Path-roads, nature's great lines;
[27199] <prose> Footprints, colored powder;
[27200] <prose> Movements, mudrā's nature;
[27201] <prose> Speech-words, vajra's recitation;
[27202] <prose> Recollections, creation stage's wheel;
[27203] <prose> Whatever appears, deity's display;
[27204] <prose> One's own body, empowerment's vase;
[27205] <prose> Down-pour, samaya of continuity;
[27206] <prose> Knowing self-clarity, instruction; || 6780 ||
[27207] <prose> Birth-death, dharmatā's measure;
[27208] <prose> Six collections' objects, realization self-arisen—
[27209] <prose> The three realms' great liberation, intention spontaneously accomplished:
[27210] <prose> Consequently, <tantra> "Ah! Such appearances: if delusion itself is self-liberated — how could non-delusion not liberate? Speech and action however are conduct of empty-clear clarity; good and bad thoughts are the great ocean-river of meditation; wrong view and correct desire are the view without partiality of the yogin; all holding hope and doubt are spontaneously arisen result. Desiring mahāmudrā — eating and drinking are approach; sleeping and abiding are accomplishment; composites are deity meditation; spittle and phlegm accomplish the maṇḍala; all the three thousand worlds are the maṇḍala — rain and mist sprinkled; the path-road of beings are the great lines; footprints are colored powder; desire to go is the posture; limb movements are mudrā; however spoken are mantra words; thoughts are creation stage; mind's movement is offering; form-appearance is deity's body — great sounding speech is music; one's own body is the vase; hair is ornamental leaves; blood and yellow water, water itself, entrusted with substances such as essential meaning; empowerments of appearing to self are conferred — without conferral, perfected in itself. Desire to transcend is samaya; desire to protect is binding; desire to liberate is degeneration; desire for nonexistence is supreme sage. Views are mudrā marks; attachment to that is experience; knowing self-clarity is instruction; the sphere of object-mind; birth-aging-sickness-death — the key of habituation; non-ceasing six collections is realization."
[27211] <prose> Thus, the yogin having accomplished whatever is done as dharmatā's nature—the deity's wheel with empowerments and instructions,
[27212] <prose> The spontaneously flowing river samādhi of Great Perfection dharmatā's wheel uninterrupted—
[27213] <prose> Effort,
[27214] <prose> Without depending on cause-effect, obtaining wondrous great siddhi naturally, perfected in the supreme ground great maṇḍala:
[27215] <prose> Wherein, <tantra> "Thus all is dharmatā: nothing to accept; nothing to place; dharmatā without anything. From whatever appears, from one's own dharmatā, fabricated dharmatā does not exist separately. However done, non-concept arises; without abandoning or adopting, self-appearance."
[27216] <tantra> "Not clinging to appearance; not establishing nonexistence; not rejecting existence; not desiring nonexistence; not manifestly clinging to existence; not establishing the made; not blocking the arisen; not viewing faults in the arisen; not rejecting afflictions; not establishing buddhas; not meditating meditation; not viewing view; not blocking deluded appearance; not seeking pure appearance." || 6790 ||
[27217] <tantra> "When the knowing that realizes appears in objects, appearing self-appears; at that time, awareness should be allowed to remain."
[27218] <prose> Third, as all is primordially transcended in the vast expanse of spontaneous equality,
[27219] <prose> Echoing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as the great nameless without bondage-liberation, acceptance-rejection:
[27220] <prose> Moreover, the Great Perfection's key point, the twelve great vajra laughs with eight wondrous words of the great natural Great Perfection,
[27221] <prose> The great nameless saṃsāra-nirvāṇa,
[27222] <prose> The great transcendence of cause-effect,
[27223] <break> <prose> The great primordially perfected non-doing,
[27224] <prose> The great primordial liberation without acceptance-rejection,
[27225] <break> <prose> The great dynamic energy without anything to do—echoing thus.
[27226] <prose> Now, nothing to do with dharma; || 6800 ||
[27227] <prose> Doing also does not transcend clinging to death;
[27228] <prose> Primordially empty, sky-expanse, vast spaciousness:
[27229] <tantra> "O essence of speech-vajra of all buddhas! Look at the self-arisen wisdom of view: transcending virtue-vice, view-meditation, wondrous! Without moving the ground, whatever is done with body and speech is without virtue-vice benefit-harm—ha ha! O speech-vajra! Look at the abiding manner of thing-nature: wondrous that appearance does not change color, does not alter hue; however thought of pleasure-pain, without change in meaning—ha ha! O speech-vajra! Look at the wisdom of the great emptiness all-arising: however manifold the conduct of recollection-thought, arising as display—wondrous! However done, in the expanse of unceasing, birthless liberation—ha ha! O speech-vajra! Look at the all-pervading wisdom of dharmatā emptiness: birthless and primordially co-abiding—wondrous! Though a person takes sharp weapons and liberates beings at one time, without benefit-harm to that person's mind-stream—ha ha! O speech-vajra! Look at the wisdom of one's own knowing emptiness all-appearance: all appearances however arise as one's own companion—wondrous! However appearing, unmoved from one's own ground—ha ha! O essence of speech-vajra! Look at the appearance of the liberated-all empty awareness: oneself is great as one's own antidote—wondrous! Afflictions self-liberate themselves—ha ha! O speech-vajra! Look at the essence of the liberated-all empty awareness: without effort, result self-found—wondrous! One perfected, all saṃsāra-nirvāṇa purified as non-dual—ha ha! O speech-vajra! Look at the measure of the all-established great emptiness essence: appearing the six migrations as three kāyas—wondrous! Without beings having done even a speck of meditation, buddhahood at one time—ha ha! O speech-vajra! Look at the result of the three kāyas great emptiness primordially perfected: dharmatā of the three times without gathering-separation—wondrous! Without practicing the six pāramitās, perfections completed at one time—ha ha! O speech-vajra! Look at the wisdom of the great equal all-established empty awareness: all action and agent arise as ornament—wondrous! All rejection-acceptance liberated through view—ha ha! O speech-vajra! Look at the great primordially empty of empty emptiness: all buddhas abide in the expanse—wondrous! Through doing, agent, downfall occurs—ha ha! O speech-vajra! Look at the thing-possessing empty of non-empty: vehicle of self-grasping in nonexistence—wondrous! Obtaining birthless through birth—ha ha!"
[27230] <prose> Thus it was spoken.
[27231] <prose> Looking at one's own awareness definitively, abiding as twelve laughs in the nature—effort self-dissolves,
[27232] <prose> Dharmas exhausted, beyond mind, echo in the great.
[27233] <prose> These eight word-kings, established by the eight great unchanging logical reasons of immutable meaning,
[27234] <prose> Should be taught literally to those of supreme intelligence,
[27235] <prose> For they are certain in that very nature of awareness.
[27236] <prose> To inferior ones, taught by distinguishing the two truths, later to be realized; || 6810 ||
[27237] <prose> If taught directly, they become angry:
[27238] <tantra> "The lion's self-sound makes all carnivores faint and fear; Great Perfection's self-speech makes all lower vehicles faint."
[27239] <prose> Therefore, for those of unripe faculties holding cause-effect as definitive meaning, secret instructions:
[27240] <break> <prose> Therefore, <tantra> "These words should not be spoken even as a speck among śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; for what reason? Hearing all these words, they will become frightened, terrified, and faint; not having faith in secret mantra, their mind revolts; through the ripening of that, they will experience the great hell of sentient beings—therefore, what need to speak of teaching and hearing? Not to be spoken even in the direction of the wind."
[27241] <break> <tantra> "Revealing secrets to beings not fully ripened is the seventh downfall."
[27242] <tantra> "Teaching emptiness to those whose minds are not trained is a root downfall."
[27243] <break> <prose> That too: the eight great wondrous words purifying the eight collections of consciousness,
[27244] <break> <prose> The twelve great unchanging letters, the measure of echoing dharmas exhausted without action in the great,
[27245] <prose> Consequently, heart not small in the echo of the meaning—through hope-doubt bondage-clinging absent, intellectually releasing the great nameless saṃsāra-nirvāṇa at one time.
[27246] <prose> To the great yogins who have arrived at that nature, cause-effect virtue-vice nonexistent taught directly—like Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, Tilopa and so forth. || 6820 ||
[27247] <prose> Though we understand thus with our minds, not having arrived through habituation,
[27248] <prose> Not fearing the nature, and through being careful about the subtlety of action-result, thus taught.
[27249] <prose> Thus the twelve vajra laughs explained three times as three echoes become thirty-six:
[27250] <prose> Corresponding to the twelve links of dependent origination of afflictions entering the pattern,
[27251] <prose> The pattern reversed,
[27252] <prose> Completely liberated—the thirty-six pure places, understand.
[27253] <prose> The meaning of those keys certainly explained in brief, word-meaning elaboration suffices.
[27254] <prose> Second general meaning: binding echoes through decisive cutting—threefold:
[27255] <prose> View decisively resolved as self-arisen wisdom;
[27256] <break> <prose> Intention sustained as timeless three times; || 6830 ||
[27257] <break> <prose> Reality echoed as exhausted nonexistence of dharmas.
[27258] <ornament> First: One's own awareness clear-emptiness, unmoving nature, naturally loose—decisively resolved, not altering with mind's view-meditation-conduct-result dharmas, non-fabricated spontaneously accomplished great view-meditation, self-abiding vast spaciousness to be practiced:
[27259] <tantra> "Secret mantra awareness-settled equipoise is the knot of view-meditation-conduct; in external-internal-secret wisdom, thought's concepts unmoved—this is the secret view of secret mantra. The Bhagavān lion dharmakāya, abiding in samādhi free from grasping-fixation; in the view without characteristics, wisdom of great equanimity clear."
[27260] <prose> Thus, <tantra> "From the all-arising dharmakāya, dissolving into the vast objectless expanse; without acceptance-rejection, it is conduct; seeing self-appearance, it is view; non-distracted in that, it is explained as meditation; without abandonment-settlement, samādhi is obtained; without falling to extremes, one's own ground is held; unmade self-arisen, primordially perfected."
[27261] <tantra> "In the limitless ocean of self-arisen dharmatā, the sun-moon of gold free from thought—obtained through the vast of empty-clear saṃsāra-nirvāṇa separation."
[27262] <prose> Second, sustaining intention as timeless three times—twofold:
[27263] <prose> In the nature of self-clear essence, unaltered, remaining in its own place, clear, radiant, coiled, clear light equal, placed within;
[27264] <prose> And through cutting the continuum of holding conceptual thoughts self-arisen from oneself,
[27265] <prose> Hence, uninterrupted, naturally dissolved, spaciously, placed outward in the pure intention of timeless three times—the instruction of expanse self-clear in its own place.
[27266] <ornament> First: Harmonizing body key and wind key, placing awareness self-clear without grasping-fixation of self-appearing appearance, settled luminously: || 6840 ||
[27267] <tantra> "Suchness not altered: like the sky unclouded by clouds; primordial dynamic energy primordially clear portion; thus in the clear sky, like the heart of the sun self-appearing—the body without defilement, the heart of certainty gathered as one, this is my maṇḍala itself."
[27268] <prose> Second, practicing the great methods of ten aspects for cutting the connecting thread of the three times:
[27269] <tantra> "For the person who does not hold the trace of the past, does not invite the future's messenger, placing present awareness in its own place—all awareness without prior-later is mixed as one; called the single gathered essence—yoga of awareness equalizing the three times."
[27270] <prose> Furthermore, <tantra> "Not following traces of past habitual tendencies; not welcoming future habitual tendencies; not dwelling present habitual tendencies in the mind-stream—called yoga of awareness equalizing the three times."
[27271] <tantra> "Through the method of memory self-dissolved, mixing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as non-dual: cutting the interval of past memories; suppressing the head of future memories; allowing present memories to self-liberate—called yoga of awareness equalizing the three times."
[27272] <tantra> "Not directing hope toward past mind; not turning back toward future mind; not directing intellect toward present mind—called yoga of realizing the three times as equal."
[27273] <tantra> "Not sending off past ignorance; not abandoning future ignorance; not taking present ignorance in the lap—called yoga of realizing the three times as equal."
[27274] <tantra> "Not being angry at past anger; not hooking future anger; not feeding present anger—called yoga of realizing the three times as equal."
[27275] <prose> Therefore, <tantra> "Not gathering clouds with past delusion; not cutting earth with future delusion; not raining with present delusion—called yoga of realizing the three times as equal."
[27276] <tantra> "Not answering past buddhas; not inviting future buddhas; not giving authority to present buddhas—called yoga of realizing the three times as equal." || 6850 ||
[27277] <tantra> "Repudiating past desire; deriding future desires; throwing present desires from objects—called yoga of realizing the three times as equal."
[27278] <break> <tantra> "Not holding past jealousy tightly; not gathering mind toward future jealousy; not placing mind in present jealousy—called yoga of realizing the three times as equal, called great yoga of realizing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa as non-dual."
[27279] <break> <prose> The three times' buddhas too:
[27280] <prose> The special experience of wisdom of awareness, abandoning grasping-fixation of joy-elation—instructed;
[27281] <prose> The other nine, negation-assertion arising as objects, self-abiding unspecified delusion—
[27282] <prose> In recognition, cutting the connecting thread of three times, the naturally dissolved dharmatā in between sustained, this is meditation.
[27283] <prose> Third, echoing reality as exhausted nonexistence of dharmas:
[27284] <tantra> "Virtue, buddhahood meaning not realized; if virtue realizes buddhahood meaning, Great Perfection nature becomes false. Sin does not fall into saṃsāra; if sin falls into saṃsāra, the three times become false. Emptiness does not see correct meaning; if emptiness sees correct meaning, wisdom clear light becomes false. Characteristics do not see self-awareness meaning; if characteristics see self-awareness meaning, self-liberated dharmatā becomes false. Doing does not obtain spontaneous accomplishment meaning; if doing obtains spontaneous accomplishment meaning, essence unchanging becomes false. Grasping does not see appearance; if grasping sees appearance, nature unceasing becomes false. Analysis does not liberate others; if analysis liberates others, all-pervading compassion becomes false. Deluded appearance does not obscure me; if deluded appearance obscures me, the two lamps become false. This is taught as secret mantra intention."
[27285] <prose> Wherein, this is the great echo of the secret meaning expanse's great pride—do not fear direct teaching.
[27286] <prose> Third general meaning: removing obstacles through decisive confidence of liberation—threefold: || 6860 ||
[27287] <prose> General explanation of the meaning of self-liberation;
[27288] <prose> Particular explanation of the reality of primordial liberation;
[27289] <prose> Extensive explanation of the intention of self-liberation.
[27290] <ornament> First:
[27291] <prose> In the path of Ati Vajra Heart Essence that extracts from afflictions,
[27292] <prose> Not abandoning afflictions, pure in place—unlike śrāvaka-pratyekabuddha rejection;
[27293] <prose> Unlike bodhisattva rejection;
[27294] <break> <prose> Unlike lower mantra creation stage transformation;
[27295] <break> <prose> Unlike completion stage self-peace sending;
[27296] <prose> Unlike common vehicle antidote subjugation; || 6870 ||
[27297] <prose> Unlike mind section self-pattern placing;
[27298] <prose> Unlike expanse section that very dharmatā making—such is not the case.
[27299] <prose> For what reason?
[27300] <prose> If afflictions, existing just as they are, are not known as never experienced,
[27301] <prose> Not abandoned through abandonment;
[27302] <prose> If afflictions are abandoned by mind, since that which is to be abandoned and the abandoner are one substance, purity is impossible;
[27303] <prose> If abandoned by wisdom, mind does not see wisdom;
[27304] <prose> Wisdom does not see mind, not abiding together—contradictory thing, the convention of that which is to be abandoned and the antidote impossible;
[27305] <prose> Not abandoned by prior-later, for past-future substance contradictory;
[27306] <prose> One existing, one ceasing; || 6880 ||
[27307] <prose> If simultaneous, mutually intermingling—that which is to be abandoned becomes antidote,
[27308] <prose> Antidote becomes that which is to be abandoned,
[27309] <prose> For mind-continuum is one-time simultaneous.
[27310] <prose> Furthermore, afflictions arising from that very mind, like body and shadow—no time of abandoning through abandonment.
[27311] <prose> Likewise applies to purification and such.
[27312] <tantra> "If suchness is not realized, like body and shadow of the yogin; from that itself self-arising, not abandoned through abandonment. Thus also not through purification; not changed through transformation; without realizing the unchanging essence, like crystal rock or turquoise stone, cannot be purified or melted. Abiding pure through nature—yogin possessing examines. Thus also not through peace; without knowing direct insight, like the king of mountains, Meru, cannot be destroyed by anyone. Not liberated through antidote; without searching, self-pure not known; like desiring muddy water to clear, clearing externally is not. That itself clear also not dharmatā; without knowing spontaneous appearance, like the appearance of a completely foolish ordinary person, not reversing manifest clinging."
[27313] <prose> In this too, two levels of intellect:
[27314] <prose> Self-liberation with effort: whatever affliction arises, recognized, placed in its own place, self-liberated, throbbing-throbbing gone—the nature of pure place, intention of self-liberation great equality, practicing dynamic energy without distraction even for an instant.
[27315] <prose> Without effort: whatever arises, unable to withstand, self-liberated, dharmatā—
[27316] <prose> That view-method need not be abandoned, liberated by nature, current, or force. || 6890 ||
[27317] <prose> These two levels of intellect, first distinction,
[27318] <break> <prose> Abiding like prior-later:
[27319] <break> <tantra> "These are two levels of intellect: with effort and without effort. With effort, placed in own place; measures of appearance habituation, wisdom pure appearance itself; when self-arising everywhere external-internal, not born from conditions. However long these arise, placed in own place, liberated in own ground; therefore yogin of appearance. Without effort is thus: self-liberated by oneself in oneself; self-hook self-liberated; like iron filing iron, like stone breaking stone; one's own antidote is great oneself; realizing nature Great Perfection, thus whatever habituation, obtained the meaning of non-searching placing; bliss great expands without meditation; nature itself directly known; this itself meeting with whom, even possessing unconfessed sins, liberated through habituation of this itself, certainly without doubt."
[27320] <prose> Second, particular explanation of the reality of primordial liberation—threefold:
[27321] <prose> Shown that antidote of effort is unnecessary, presently self-liberated, primordially liberated;
[27322] <prose> Instructed not to transcend that reality's nature;
[27323] <prose> Echoed merely groundlessly self-liberated in the nature, never having gone elsewhere.
[27324] <ornament> First:
[27325] <tantra> "Not liberated through effort; primordially itself abiding liberated."
[27326] <tantra> "Ignorance itself self-arisen; cause of delusion primordially liberated; Kunzhi dharmakāya self-arisen; therefore severed the root of lineage. Wish-fulfilling intention primordially abiding; therefore movers are placed. Breath primordially continuity-ceased; therefore birth-death primordially nonexistent. Desires' objects primordially perfected; therefore end of clinging is meditation itself. Limbs unmoved primordially transcended; therefore path of beings primordially traversed. Spoken words unexpressed; therefore primordially transcended speech-thought. Thought's projection-gathering primordially empty; therefore primordially abides in great meditation. Defilements self-pure; therefore abides in stainless spontaneous vastness. Through non-doing no arising-place; therefore primordially free from action-agent. Nothing arising separately from ground; therefore primordial self-arisen singular. Numbers of one and two exhausted; therefore separated from bindu and moon. Darkness primordially pure; therefore awareness-appearance clear light pervades. Saṃsāra unchanging ceased; therefore primordially spontaneously accomplished buddhahood. Thing-characteristics empty-liberated; therefore self-grasping mind primordially exhausted. Conditions self-liberated; therefore references placed in equipoise." || 6900 ||
[27327] <ornament> Second:
[27328] <tantra> "The end of Great Perfection nature: dharmas placed in own place; appearance-awareness union of emptiness; primordial liberation equipoise; intention beyond mind; characteristics self-pure in own place; liberation from extremes of empty and thing; exhaustion-change without thought; mind exhausted beyond intellect."
[27329] <tantra> "The five elements primordially clear; appearance liberated in clear light itself; five faculties placed bare; five grasping objects liberated in own place."
[27330] <ornament> Third:
[27331] <tantra> "Self-liberation of one's own mind: not going from one to one; mind without that which liberates; perfected from ground, no going-coming; not found through analysis, no reason; abiding clear-empty through groundlessness; that mind abiding self-clear; liberated through key point, without direction-side; liberated through time, no reference-ground; liberated without effort, without diligence; liberated through confidence, without effort; liberation through confidence explained; primordially liberated, no ground-return; self-liberated, no antidote; liberated through bareness, though seen; completely liberated, without effort."
[27332] <prose> Thus, the three doors primordially liberated—therefore no need for liberation through primordial effort;
[27333] <prose> Body not needing mudrā transformation and such, liberated through element self-key, not returning to six migrations;
[27334] <prose> Speech not needing recitation of essence mantras and such, liberated in clear purity of expression,
[27335] <prose> Whatever spoken liberated through speech-meaning key;
[27336] <prose> Mind not needing samādhi meditation and such, liberated through thought-intention key, || 6910 ||
[27337] <prose> Whatever thought liberated through intention key—nothing arising from other, therefore self-liberated, impossible for antidote to exist.
[27338] <prose> Thus, the key point of self-liberation without antidote.
[27339] <ornament> Regarding "liberation":
[27340] <prose> Furthermore, liberated through mere placing; liberated at the key point through mere knowing; primordial liberation; self-liberation; bare liberation; complete liberation—though many, this is explained as not needing effort in great self-liberation without antidote.
[27341] <prose> Third, extensive explanation of the intention of self-liberation—threefold:
[27342] <prose> Brief indication of essence; particular explanation of nature; concluding summary of meaning.
[27343] <ornament> First:
[27344] <tantra> "In unceasing awareness, no cause of delusion, no ground of reversal; being primordial liberation, certainly transcended; being self-liberation, object-conditions exhausted; being bare liberation, appearance pure; being end-liberation, four extremes ceased; being single liberation, manifold empties."
[27345] <prose> Thus, in the naturally loose awareness like a crystal vessel without defilement, through the key point of groundlessness—
[27346] <prose> No cause of delusion now, awareness rootless without path; || 6920 ||
[27347] <prose> Without path, no ground of returning to result in three realms, primordially liberated like space, spontaneously accomplished intention—
[27348] <prose> With five great liberation manners, surpassing all common vehicles.
[27349] <break> <prose> Second, five: primordial liberation, self-liberation, bare liberation, end-liberation, single liberation—extensive explanation of nature.
[27350] <break> <prose> First, primordial liberation without ground-return, relying on key point, all view-meditation shown as unnecessary:
[27351] <prose> Wisdom all-pervading, general release, without made or altered meaning—
[27352] <break> <prose> Not arising from anywhere; not going anywhere; not abiding anywhere—unchanging meaning.
[27353] <prose> Liberation is not like untying—therefore view-meditation unnecessary;
[27354] <prose> Called "liberation" through abiding in own pattern;
[27355] <break> <prose> Meaning without acceptance-rejection.
[27356] <prose> Thus, body-speech-mind three, relaxed in own pattern, mind truly arrived, called "liberation." || 6930 ||
[27357] <prose> Also, through definitely abiding thus, surpassing common vehicles.
[27358] <prose> Example of primordial liberation:
[27359] <prose> Like aṭali fruit ripened primordially, now no ripening cause.
[27360] <prose> Primordial liberation threefold: understanding of primordial liberation; logical establishment; liberation manner.
[27361] <prose> Understanding of primordial liberation: not adventitious, primordially liberated; now no need to liberate again—
[27362] <prose> Arising from awareness itself never experiencing delusion.
[27363] <prose> Logical establishment of primordial liberation threefold: established through reasoning; established through scripture; established through logical reason.
[27364] <prose> Established through reasoning: key point of awareness itself primordially liberated—
[27365] <prose> Thus, awareness without ground, no ground of reversal; without root, no arising-place; without characteristic, not arriving at certainty; without birth, no liberation-cause.
[27366] <prose> Also, as sign of being primordial liberation, no characteristic seen through any meditation-accomplishment; || 6940 ||
[27367] <prose> Also established through cause-effect traceless reasoning—awareness without cause, no result, therefore action and ripening impossible.
[27368] <prose> Established through scripture: <tantra> "Mind primordially liberated—how could conditions of external liberation exist?"
[27369] <prose> Established through logical reason: established through the logical reason of settling naturally—settled primordially liberated, therefore self-liberated in own place, for primordially liberated.
[27370] <prose> Also known as primordially liberated through the key point of awareness without arising-place, abiding-place, going-place.
[27371] <prose> Liberation manner: called "liberation" because mind is emptiness, or cannot be designated even conventionally as "liberated" or "not liberated"—
[27372] <prose> As sign of primordial liberation, now not needing to liberate again—mind primordially Buddha.
[27373] <prose> Known as no liberation-cause in primordial liberation.
[27374] <prose> Second, self-liberation without antidote, relying on key point, all scriptures shown as unnecessary:
[27375] <prose> Thus all appearing-sounding dharmas, though arising, arise from oneself; liberated, self-liberated.
[27376] <prose> Example: like sky and clouds. || 6950 ||
[27377] <prose> Thus, not like meditation, view, conduct with faults depending on other objects—
[27378] <prose> Called "liberated through meaning" for exhaustion of dharmas.
[27379] <prose> Self-liberation threefold: understanding of self-liberation; establishment of self-liberation; liberation manner.
[27380] <prose> Therefore, understanding of self-liberation: meaning without antidote; appearance itself self-liberated from appearance; no dharmatā whatever separate from appearance.
[27381] <prose> Likewise emptiness and so forth; liberated by that itself, nothing separate.
[27382] <prose> Example: like alcohol-disease destroyed by alcohol; like poison destroyed by poison; like iron cut by iron.
[27383] <prose> Afflictions themselves liberated by that itself, therefore called "self-liberation."
[27384] <prose> Establishment of self-liberation threefold: established through reasoning; established through scripture; established through logical reason.
[27385] <prose> Established through reasoning: established through dharmatā's reasoning—all liberation is self-liberation; not like untied by other;
[27386] <prose> If liberated by other, like one thing appearing as different forms impossible; || 6960 ||
[27387] <prose> Like thing-characteristic arriving at certainty through thing.
[27388] <prose> Established through scripture: <tantra> "Liberation self-arisen, not from other."
[27389] <prose> Established through logical reason: established through the logical reason of no ground of dispute in great self-liberation—
[27390] <prose> Appearance is self-liberated, for depending on other antidote is absent.
[27391] <prose> Liberation manner: nothing other than self-liberated by oneself;
[27392] <prose> Also from other texts: desiring passion as path for passionate, and so forth, explained:
[27393] <tantra> "As fire burns the burned, by that fire itself one should warm."
[27394] <prose> Appearance itself liberated from appearance's own place; no liberation-cause or liberation-condition separate from appearance.
[27395] <prose> Liberated groundlessly, no support of abiding, without root-ground;
[27396] <prose> That mind without root-ground: || 6970 ||
[27397] <tantra> "This mind without root-ground: not male, not female, not neuter; not color, not shape; without characteristic, not caste-lineage."
[27398] <prose> That itself, without ground of reversal separate from oneself;
[27399] <prose> Without going-place; without experiencing birth;
[27400] <prose> No place of arising from anywhere;
[27401] <prose> Without other dharmas separate from that itself not being oneself, called "self-liberation."
[27402] <prose> Example: like a snake's knot self-liberated without anyone untying.
[27403] <prose> Third, bare liberation seen-liberated, relying on key point, all scriptures shown as unnecessary:
[27404] <prose> Merely through bare seeing, liberated in that itself—
[27405] <prose> Liberated through meeting of mother-child; appearance unmodified by mind;
[27406] <prose> Not blocked by appearance, placed, liberated in self-purity. || 6980 ||
[27407] <prose> Bare liberation seen-liberated fourfold: understanding of bare liberation; establishment of bare liberation; liberation manner; example.
[27408] <prose> Understanding of bare liberation: merely through bare seeing, liberated in seeing—
[27409] <prose> Whether seen, heard, or merely known in the first instant, liberated;
[27410] <prose> Arrived at calculation of dharmatā direct.
[27411] <prose> Establishment of bare liberation threefold: reasoning; scripture; logical reason.
[27412] <prose> Reasoning: established through not observing anywhere in liberation-release—
[27413] <prose> Appearance liberated merely through appearing in appearing; awareness liberated merely through arising in arising;
[27414] <prose> Through the key point of emptiness in own place, through bare seeing of form, form—
[27415] <prose> Shown merely as despising form, liberated by that itself.
[27416] <prose> Likewise sound and so forth. || 6990 ||
[27417] <prose> How known as liberated? Through seeing as form, elaboration of form-not-form is cut;
[27418] <prose> Through bare placing in that, that itself liberated;
[27419] <prose> Awareness of entering other does not arise.
[27420] <prose> Consequently, established through scripture: <tantra> "Through the view-posture of great bare liberation, buddhas and sentient beings both liberated."
[27421] <prose> Logical reason: established through the logical reason of self-purity free from direction-side—
[27422] <prose> Appearance is bare-liberated, for placed in bare place, liberated in place of placing, liberated in place of liberation.
[27423] <prose> Liberation manner: practicing on piece-by-piece dharmas, liberated piece-by-piece in bare place—
[27424] <prose> Not gone anywhere; not come from anywhere; no going-place anywhere;
[27425] <prose> Unchanging from wherever abiding.
[27426] <prose> Practicing on general dharmas, all appearances gone to bare-liberation. || 7000 ||
[27427] <prose> Example: like a blind person going to a temple—no seen direction.
[27428] <prose> Fourth, end-liberation free from reference, relying on key point:
[27429] <prose> Key point not aimed at any reference—liberated from end of one, not abiding as two;
[27430] <prose> Liberated from two, not abiding as one.
[27431] <prose> Likewise both and neither.
[27432] <prose> End: appearing-end of existence; non-appearing-end of nonexistence; both-and-neither ends four ceased—called "liberation" conventionally.
[27433] <prose> End-liberation free from reference threefold: understanding of end-liberation; establishment of end-liberation; liberation manner.
[27434] <prose> Understanding of end-liberation: not aimed at any reference of existence, nonexistence, appearance, emptiness end—
[27435] <prose> Meaning transcended calculation of this-is-this, this-is-not-this.
[27436] <prose> Establishment of end-liberation threefold: reasoning; scripture; logical reason. || 7010 ||
[27437] <prose> Reasoning: established through nature reasoning free from reference—
[27438] <prose> Not depending on anything, free from end, not abiding in any end.
[27439] <prose> Therefore called "view without observing center of end-free."
[27440] <prose> Established through scripture: <tantra> "Called liberated through free from end."
[27441] <prose> Logical reason: established through the logical reason of single knowing all-liberated—
[27442] <prose> Knowing free from single end, all designations liberated from appearance, for not aimed at any reference.
[27443] <prose> Liberation manner: not abiding in existence-end, liberated from nonexistence-end;
[27444] <prose> Not abiding in nonexistence-end, liberated from existence-end;
[27445] <prose> Not abiding in both, both liberated;
[27446] <prose> Through neither, neither liberated. || 7020 ||
[27447] <prose> Fifth, single liberation peerless, relying on key point, method and wisdom shown as unnecessary:
[27448] <prose> Single is Great Perfection, bindu singular, free from elaboration;
[27449] <prose> Liberated in that nature, all manifold number-ends emptied.
[27450] <prose> Therefore, single liberation peerless key point fourfold: understanding of single liberation; establishment of single liberation; liberation manner; example.
[27451] <prose> Understanding of single liberation: single liberation not unreasonable—
[27452] <prose> Without non-realization of liberated from one to one, nothing at all.
[27453] <prose> Therefore awareness transcends convention of primordially liberated or not liberated.
[27454] <prose> Establishment of single liberation threefold: reasoning; scripture; logical reason.
[27455] <prose> Established through reasoning: all liberation not different—for nothing other from one, called "liberation."
[27456] <prose> That single one is awareness itself; || 7030 ||
[27457] <prose> Also no other dharmas separate from singular self-awareness.
[27458] <prose> Established through scripture: <tantra> "Dharmatā of single liberation: for manifold taste is one."
[27459] <prose> Established through logical reason: established through the logical reason of single knowing all-liberated—
[27460] <prose> Knowing single awareness, all saṃsāra liberated.
[27461] <prose> Liberation manner: through knowing as dharmatā, appearance-awareness all liberated.
[27462] <prose> Example: knowing manifold taste as one—
[27463] <prose> Like salt taste arriving at certainty, all salt taste arrives at certainty;
[27464] <prose> Or molasses, knowing one fire knows all—
[27465] <prose> Moreover, <tantra> "Like fire's nature burning, molasses' nature sweet, thus all dharmas too are one in nature emptiness."
[27466] <prose> Thus these five liberation manners are not counted for one person; || 7040 ||
[27467] <prose> Through distinction of faculties, liberated through whatever is suited.
[27468] <prose> Third, concluding summary of five liberation manners:
[27469] <prose> Those five liberation manners free from reference-ground are self-liberation, free from reference of view-meditation-conduct dharmas of focal objects—
[27470] <break> <prose> Thus, conditions self-liberated by conditions, like dirt washed by dirt, bad conditions liberated by bad conditions, arising as companion of wisdom;
[27471] <break> <prose> Primordial purity liberated by primordial purity, awareness liberated by awareness.
[27472] <prose> Primordial liberation free from grasping-fixation union reference, objects liberated by objects, like poison destroying poison;
[27473] <prose> Bare liberation not depending on saṃsāra-nirvāṇa two, causes liberated by causes, like iron cutting iron;
[27474] <prose> End liberation not depending on conventional words, dharmas liberated by dharmas, like fire from wood burning that wood;
[27475] <prose> Single liberation not depending on liberating intellect, mind liberated by mind, like stone breaking stone:
[27476] <tantra> "Conditions self-liberated by conditions: I do not depend on focal object dharmas. Objects liberated by objects: I do not depend on grasping-fixation two. Causes liberated by causes: I do not depend on saṃsāra-nirvāṇa two. Dharmas liberated by dharmas: I do not depend on conventional words. Mind liberated by mind: I do not depend on indicating intellect. Like dirt washing dirt, thus pure liberated by pure. Like poison destroying poison, like iron cutting iron, like stone breaking stone, like wood burning wood—self's enemy done by self. Not liberated by different type." || 7050 ||
[27477] <prose> That too: through key point of nothing incomplete in awareness, when awareness liberated, all dharmas liberated—like support-thing destroyed, supported-dharma destroyed;
[27478] <prose> Self-liberated self-dissolved, spacious expanse:
[27479] <tantra> "Therefore in ground-abiding awareness: self-arisen, appearance perfected; self-arisen, ground itself perfected; self-appearance, objects too perfected; self-liberated, delusion-ground perfected; self-pure, all paths perfected; self-aware, knowables perfected; self-pervading, results perfected; self-ground, causes-conditions perfected; self-realized, dharmatā perfected; self-reversed, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa perfected; self-abiding, scriptures perfected; self-perfecting, one time perfected; self-knowing, instructions perfected; self-placing, meditation perfected; self-possessing, expanse perfected."
[27480] <prose> Thus perfected and liberated awareness itself, primordially pure from the beginning, without defilement;
[27481] <prose> Being heart, lineage exhausted;
[27482] <prose> Singular great bliss, transcending speech-thought-expression;
[27483] <prose> Primordially pure naked;
[27484] <prose> Empty with defilement of acceptance-rejection;
[27485] <prose> Generally appearing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's play-thing not stained;
[27486] <prose> Exhausted-change liberated, beyond material-awareness; || 7060 ||
[27487] <prose> Abiding as natural ground-Buddha:
[27488] <tantra> "Ah! Self-perfecting Great Perfection dharmakāya: pure from the beginning — defilement exhausted; first arising — lineage exhausted; separated from moon — beyond calculation; pleasure without suffering-cause — great bliss; unexpressed — beyond speech-thought; primordially self-aware pure. Not with defilement — for outflows exhausted; empty abiding — for things exhausted; essence without increase of two; transcending method — through separation from dharmas; movement purified — through unthought clarity; two collections perfected — through non-dual material-awareness; self-equipoise without rival; pervading all — without fabricated words; without thought-object mind — separated from memory; natural fresh — natural nature; supreme unaltered — truly abiding."
[27489] <prose> Thus external appearance, internal body-mind all, empty clear appearance like moon in water—dynamic energy practiced;
[27490] <prose> Those abiding in the meaning of awareness like space:
[27491] <prose> Dharmas exhausted, appearance and body like moon-water,
[27492] <prose> Without obstruction by walls, fences, and such;
[27493] <prose> Obtained immeasurable eyes and clairvoyance;
[27494] <prose> Seeing noble truth, liberated from further existence:
[27495] <prose> Liberated in the ground of primordial purity;
[27496] <prose> Four elements' atoms powerless, burned by wisdom fire; || 7070 ||
[27497] <prose> Like mist dissolving, displaying body's miraculous power in space,
[27498] <prose> If meaningful, those atoms burned by wisdom fire consecrated as relics and ringsel;
[27499] <prose> If not changing, self-dissolved into peace,
[27500] <prose> Awareness abiding in dharmakāya expanse;
[27501] <prose> Form kāya with enlightened activity, accomplishing beings' welfare until saṃsāra not emptied:
[27502] <tantra> "Though the four appearances do not arrive at measure; there is liberation in the primordial ground of invisible with defilement—such is the intention."
[27503] <prose> Explained clearly as manner of liberation in Cutting Through:
[27504] <tantra> "Not sent, placed in own place: mind's words all these, no one practiced, appearing understood in individual intellect; this itself understood in one's own mind; invisible without thought; all appearances self-pure from that; all spontaneously arisen; becoming in the class of clear-empty great. Earth water fire wind four elements, individual power invisible; like mist, dissolving for the wise; various clinging of delusion, however thought birthless; grasping-fixation parts self-ceased; whatever invisible, self-exhausted; experiencer self-experienced; embodied all thus gone; disembodied needless to mention."
[27505] <prose> When the yogin's realization arrives at measure:
[27506] <prose> Atoms partless, body with defilement self-dissolved in own place; || 7080 ||
[27507] <prose> Though not completely arrived, if surpassing others, that body even a srang or such weight becomes small, and so forth—awareness dissolving in primordial purity.
[27508] <prose> The key point of this:
[27509] <prose> Arising from the portion of habituation of naturally loose pure with defilement of awareness' essence;
[27510] <prose> Hence, mind and its deluded appearance empty clear portion too, at that time, self-pure in own face, mind and wisdom distinguished,
[27511] <prose> Seeing the truth of pure mind wisdom's bliss:

[27515] <prose> The instructions of liberation through profound realization explained, the nineteenth chapter.
[27516] <prose> Thus having established the meaning of Cutting Through, || 7090 ||
[27517] <prose> Now extensively explained the method of purifying the body of light with defilement through the key point of Crossing Over—twofold:
[27518] <break> <prose> The manner of surpassing Cutting Through through distinction;
[27519] <break> <prose> Explanation of Crossing Over itself as distinguished.
[27520] <ornament> First: Surpassing through seven distinctions—
[27521] <prose> Distinction of appearance-light;
[27522] <prose> Distinction of practice-application connection;
[27523] <prose> Distinction of directly seeing self-appearance;
[27524] <prose> Distinction of body key channels;
[27525] <prose> Distinction of appearance-door;
[27526] <break> <prose> Distinction of seeing faculty; || 7100 ||
[27527] <prose> Distinction of experience increase-appearance—seven.
[27528] <break> <ornament> First: Cutting Through cannot purify earth-stone mountains, rocks, and such of external deluded appearance;
[27529] <prose> Making objects, expansion of illusion, groundlessness and such depends on intellectual examination;
[27530] <prose> Depending on mind-consciousness collection dharmas, quickly not liberated.
[27531] <prose> In Crossing Over, making objects of light-five expanse-awareness appearance;
[27532] <prose> Not needing expansion of nameless intellectual examination of deluded appearance;
[27533] <prose> Practicing self-ceased mind dharmas eye-consciousness and such.
[27534] <tantra> "Not sent, placed in own place: mind's words all these, no one practiced, appearing understood in individual intellect; this itself understood in one's own mind; invisible without thought; all appearances self-pure from that; all spontaneously arisen; becoming in the class of clear-empty great. Earth water fire wind four elements, individual power invisible; like mist, dissolving for the wise; various clinging of delusion, however thought birthless; grasping-fixation parts self-ceased; whatever invisible, self-exhausted; experiencer self-experienced; embodied all thus gone; disembodied needless to mention."
[27535] <prose> When the yogin's realization arrives at measure:
[27536] <prose> Atoms partless, body with defilement self-dissolved in own place; || 7110 ||
[27537] <prose> Though not completely arrived, if surpassing others, that body even a srang or such weight becomes small, and so forth—awareness dissolving in primordial purity.
[27538] <prose> The key point of this:
[27539] <prose> Arising from the portion of habituation of naturally loose pure with defilement of awareness' essence;
[27540] <prose> Thus, mind and its deluded appearance empty clear portion too, at that time, self-pure in own face, mind and wisdom distinguished,
[27541] <prose> Seeing the truth of pure mind wisdom's bliss:
[27542] <tantra> "Seeing Buddha truth, Buddha's son; understanding thought within, always bliss."
[27543] <prose> Thus extensively spoken, arrived at the crown of the head—the time.
[27544] <tantra> From the Treasury of Precious Qualities, Supreme Vehicle,
[27545] <prose> The instructions of liberation through profound realization explained, the nineteenth chapter.
[27546] <prose> Thus having established the meaning of Cutting Through, || 7120 ||
[27547] <prose> Now extensively explained the method of purifying the body of light with defilement through the key point of Crossing Over—twofold:
[27548] <prose> The manner of surpassing Cutting Through through distinction;
[27549] <prose> Explanation of Crossing Over itself as distinguished.
[27550] <ornament> First: Surpassing through seven distinctions—
[27551] <prose> Distinction of appearance-light;
[27552] <prose> Distinction of practice-application connection;
[27553] <prose> Distinction of directly seeing self-appearance;

[27559] <prose> Making objects, expansion of illusion, groundlessness and such depends on intellectual examination;
[27560] <prose> Depending on mind-consciousness collection dharmas, quickly not liberated.
[27561] <prose> In Crossing Over, making objects of light-five expanse-awareness appearance;
[27562] <prose> Not needing expansion of nameless intellectual examination of deluded appearance;
[27563] <prose> Practicing self-ceased mind dharmas eye-consciousness and such—
[27564] <prose> Therefore, through the view of the Great Perfection, conduct beyond acceptance and rejection,
[27565] <prose> The path free from hope and doubt is spontaneously accomplished.
[27566] <prose> Without meditation, meditation is perfected; without view, view is complete; || 7140 ||
[27567] <prose> Without action, action is fulfilled; without result, result is obtained.
[27568] <prose> This is the supreme secret of the vajra vehicle,
[27569] <prose> The pinnacle of all yānas, the essential point of the Great Perfection.
[27570] <prose> Through recognizing awareness as primordially pure,
[27571] <prose> All phenomena are liberated in their own place.
[27572] <prose> Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are of one taste,
[27573] <prose> The display of dharmakāya, spontaneously present.
[27574] <prose> Without rejecting the afflictions, they are self-purified;
[27575] <prose> Without adopting the antidotes, they naturally subside.
[27576] <prose> This is the conduct of the royal lion, || 7150 ||
[27577] <prose> Unfettered, unbound, completely free.
[27578] <prose> Through the three samādhis of natural equipoise,
[27579] <prose> Thunder descent, and appearance increase,
[27580] <prose> The yogin traverses the path without traversing,
[27581] <prose> Arriving at the result without seeking.
[27582] <prose> The four cog bzhag—mountain, ocean, awareness, appearance—
[27583] <prose> Establish the view beyond intellect.
[27584] <prose> The five manners of liberation—primordial, self, bare, extreme-free, single—
[27585] <prose> Perfect the exhaustion of dharmas beyond mind.
[27586] <prose> Therefore, the practitioner of the Great Perfection, || 7160 ||
[27587] <prose> Without abandoning saṃsāra, is liberated therein;
[27588] <prose> Without seeking nirvāṇa, perfectly awakens.
[27589] <prose> The sixteen dharmas of nonexistence,
[27590] <prose> The four recognitions, the three samādhis,
[27591] <prose> The four settled equipoises, the five liberations—
[27592] <prose> These are the instructions of the Secret Heart Essence.
[27593] <prose> Through mind destroying mind, like iron destroys iron,
[27594] <prose> The small house of mind collapses without trace.
[27595] <prose> Searching for mind, nothing is found;
[27596] <prose> Not searching, everything is complete. || 7170 ||
[27597] <prose> This is the measure of liberation,
[27598] <prose> The realization of the natural Great Perfection.
[27599] <prose> Through the key point of dharmatā free from effort,
[27600] <prose> The three doors are relaxed in their own pattern.
[27601] <prose> Body, speech, and mind—whatever arises,
[27602] <prose> Self-liberated in the very moment of arising.
[27603] <prose> This is the secret conduct of the vajra queen,
[27604] <prose> The spontaneous flow of the six collections.
[27605] <prose> Not modifying appearance, not altering awareness,
[27606] <prose> The natural state is preserved as it is. || 7180 ||
[27607] <prose> Through the instructions of the lama,
[27608] <prose> One's own face is recognized.
[27609] <prose> Then, whatever appears is the display of wisdom,
[27610] <prose> Whatever arises is the ornament of dharmatā.
[27611] <prose> Eating, sleeping, walking, sitting—
[27612] <prose> All is the maṇḍala of self-arisen wisdom.
[27613] <prose> Without acceptance or rejection, good or bad,
[27614] <prose> The view is vast, the meditation deep.
[27615] <prose> This is the conduct of the bee, gathering from all;
[27616] <prose> The conduct of the deer, never turning back; || 7190 ||
[27617] <prose> The conduct of the madman, beyond convention;
[27618] <prose> The conduct of the lion, fearless and free.
[27619] <prose> Twenty-one conducts, each complete in itself,
[27620] <prose> All subsumed in the single nature of mind.
[27621] <prose> Through the reversal of view,
[27622] <prose> The four demons are vanquished:
[27623] <prose> The demon of the aggregates, self-liberated;
[27624] <prose> The demon of the afflictions, naturally purified;
[27625] <prose> The demon of the god of death, transcended in dharmatā;
[27626] <prose> The demon of the son of gods, destroyed in non-duality. || 7200 ||
[27627] <prose> Thus the instructions of the Secret Mantra
[27628] <prose> Surpass the causal vehicle's gradual path.
[27629] <prose> Through the four recognitions,
[27630] <prose> The prior and later are connected;
[27631] <prose> Through the three samādhis,
[27632] <prose> The three times are equalized.
[27633] <prose> Through the four cog bzhag,
[27634] <prose> The view is established as beyond mind.
[27635] <prose> Through the five manners of liberation,
[27636] <prose> The result is perfected without seeking. || 7210 ||
[27637] <prose> This is the essential instruction of the Heart Essence,
[27638] <prose> The secret path of the vidyādharas.
[27639] <prose> Primordially pure, spontaneously perfect,
[27640] <prose> Beyond fabrication, naturally accomplished.
[27641] <prose> The nature of mind is dharmakāya,
[27642] <prose> The dharmakāya is the nature of mind.
[27643] <break> <prose> Not two, not one—beyond expression,
[27644] <break> <prose> This is the ultimate truth of the Great Perfection.
[27645] <prose> Through hearing, contemplating, and meditating,
[27646] <prose> The meaning is realized in one's own mind. || 7220 ||
[27647] <prose> Not through others, not from outside,
[27648] <prose> The self-arisen wisdom naturally dawns.
[27649] <prose> This is the instruction of Samantabhadra,
[27650] <prose> The realization of the primordial Buddha.
[27651] <prose> Through the six great expanses,
[27652] <prose> The dharmatā is proclaimed:
[27653] <prose> Self-purity, vast openness, natural flow,
[27654] <prose> Settled confidence, beyond intellect.
[27655] <prose> These are the five great intentions,
[27656] <prose> The essence of the Secret Mantra path. || 7230 ||
[27657] <prose> Through the twelve great vajra laughs,
[27658] <prose> The nature is expressed beyond words:
[27659] <prose> Dharmas exhausted, without action;
[27660] <prose> Self-perfecting, without effort;
[27661] <prose> Naturally liberated, without abandonment;
[27662] <prose> Spontaneously accomplished, without seeking.
[27663] <prose> This is the secret that terrifies the lower vehicles,
[27664] <prose> The pinnacle that transcends all paths.
[27665] <prose> To the worthy, it brings liberation;
[27666] <prose> To the unworthy, fear and confusion. || 7240 ||
[27667] <prose> Therefore, keep it secret, preserve it well,
[27668] <prose> This most precious instruction of the Heart Essence.
[27669] <prose> Through the direct introduction to awareness,
[27670] <prose> The face of rigpa is shown.
[27671] <break> <prose> Through sustaining that nature,
[27672] <break> <prose> The three doors are relaxed.
[27673] <prose> Through the three key points of dharmatā,
[27674] <prose> The wheel of liberation is turned.
[27675] <prose> This is the path of Cutting Through,
[27676] <prose> The exhaustion of dharmas beyond mind. || 7250 ||
[27677] <break> <prose> Through the four lamps and four visions,
[27678] <break> <prose> The body of light is perfected.
[27679] <prose> This is the path of Crossing Over,
[27680] <prose> The direct perception of the youthfulness of body and mind.
[27681] <prose> These two, Cutting Through and Crossing Over,
[27682] <prose> Are the two aspects of the Great Perfection path.
[27683] <prose> Through Cutting Through, the view is established;
[27684] <prose> Through Crossing Over, the result is obtained.
[27685] <prose> Both are complete in the single nature,
[27686] <prose> The essence of the Secret Heart Essence. || 7260 ||
[27687] <prose> Through the practice of these instructions,
[27688] <prose> Buddhahood is achieved in this very life.
[27689] <prose> Without abandoning the body, the light body is obtained;
[27690] <prose> Without leaving saṃsāra, nirvāṇa is found.
[27691] <prose> This is the special quality of the Great Perfection,
[27692] <prose> Surpassing all other paths.
[27693] <prose> Through the kindness of the lama,
[27694] <prose> These instructions are received.
[27695] <prose> Through the merit of the student,
[27696] <prose> They are understood and practiced. || 7270 ||
