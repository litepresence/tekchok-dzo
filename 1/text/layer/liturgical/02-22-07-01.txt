[32429] <ornament> First, the essence:
[32430] <prose> The situation of outer objects and inner mind appearing as dharmas.
[32431] <prose> Furthermore, all appearances other than inner space of primordial purity are the situation of the intermediate state.
[32432] <prose> The aspect of appearance of the face of self-arising activity through the two form bodies from the self-radiance of ground-appearance appearing as body and wisdom is the pure intermediate state of dharmatā,
[32433] <prose> While all impure dharmas of deluded appearance of the six realms are the intermediate state of delusion.
[32434] <prose> Between which of these two dharmas of pure and impure does it exist?
[32435] <prose> Since from the space of primordial purity it must dissolve back into primordial purity through outward movement, it exists in the interval of primordially pure nature.
[32436] <ornament> First, that also arises from that. || 12010 ||
