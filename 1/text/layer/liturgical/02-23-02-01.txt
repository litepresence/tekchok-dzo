[32671] <prose> First, three aspects:
[32672] <prose> Contemplating the difficulty of obtaining, train in Dharma without leisure-freedom intermission.
[32673] <prose> The training procedure is explained.
[32674] <prose> Contemplating the cause of certain decay, always produce definite-emerge and weariness.
[32675] <prose> Contemplating the simile of certain death, meditate on profound meaning of emptiness when the time comes.
[32676] <prose> The first: || 12250 ||
[32677] <verse> Difficult to be born: born in the place of Dharma exercise from karma-ground of Jambu-continent.
[32678] <verse> Difficult to obtain: obtaining leisure with endowments.
[32679] <verse> Difficult to meet: meeting Master Virtuous Friend.
[32680] <verse> Difficult to enter: entering the door of holy Dharma jewel.
[32681] <verse> Difficult to know: knowing unsurpassed instruction exactly not wrong.
[32682] <verse> Difficult to abandon: abandoning saṃsāra's suffering ocean, the time to go to liberation's Buddha-continent—
[32683] <verse> now if not accomplished producing effort and courage, later such favorable conditions complete are not possible.
[32684] <verse> Therefore appropriate to meditate day and night in profound meaning without opportunity for leisure-freedom.
[32685] <tantra> From the presence of Arya Nagarjuna:
[32686] <tantra> Remaining in favorable land, || 12260 ||
[32687] <tantra> Relying on holy birth-beings,
[32688] <tantra> Virtue arisen from before-training good prayers by self,
[32689] <tantra> You possess the four great wheels—thus.
[32690] <tantra> From the presence of Arya Shantideva:
[32691] <tantra> This leisure endowment is greatly difficult to obtain;
[32692] <tantra> For the birth-being who has obtained purpose accomplishment,
[32693] <tantra> If effort is not made in this,
[32694] <tantra> Where will proper obtainment be later?
[32695] <tantra> Having obtained such leisure,
[32696] <tantra> If effort is not made now, || 12270 ||
[32697] <tantra> Go to negative path as corpse of the dead;
[32698] <tantra> In billions of hundred-thousand kalpas,
[32699] <tantra> Not even hearing the sound of happy path,
[32700] <tantra> What need to mention obtaining happy path?—thus said.
[32701] <prose> Moreover, that too: all this present pleasure-pain and appearance become from before karma; later appearance is produced by present karma.
[32702] <prose> Those who did evil karma before ripen here as incomplete faculties, crooked limbs, etc., ugly forms, poor, become under others' power.
[32703] <prose> Those who gathered good karma before, here clear faculties, beautiful forms, pleasing to the mind when seen.
[32704] <prose> Possessing retinue, enjoyment, prosperity, always possessing autonomy and so forth.
[32705] <prose> Where to be born next also depends on present thought-conduct virtuous or non-virtuous.
[32706] <prose> Thus, those possessing the gathered accumulations, practicing giving, ethics and so forth, are born in happy path higher realm's world, high with retinue and prosperity. || 12280 ||
[32707] <prose> Those abiding in patience, kindness and so forth, possessing beautiful forms.
[32708] <prose> Having made helper, protector-shelter, born in central land.
[32709] <prose> Honored by all, born without harm by others.
[32710] <prose> Those before who venerated Master and practiced Dharma.
[32711] <prose> Now meet true Master Virtuous Friend and practice Dharma.
[32712] <prose> Born in good land possessing all desires.
[32713] <prose> Those before who venerated Three Jewels, offering.
[32714] <prose> Here also well renounced.
[32715] <prose> Completed ordination, abiding in pure conduct until life's end.
[32716] <prose> Practicing holy vehicle Dharma. || 12290 ||
[32717] <prose> Those before trained in hearing, contemplation, meditation.
[32718] <prose> Here also great wisdom, Dharma's limitless door, through hearing, contemplation and meditation accomplish self and others' two benefits and so forth, immeasurable qualities.
[32719] <prose> Those before who did evil, non-virtuous karma, here also born in various lower paths.
[32720] <prose> Even obtaining higher realm, incomplete faculties and so forth, poor, born with little merit.
[32721] <prose> Here also practicing non-virtue, later too born in suffering class.
[32722] <prose> In brief, previous life whatever done, known through present body-mind's pleasure-pain and aspects.
[32723] <prose> Where born next depends on present thought-conduct.
[32724] <prose> From the Sutra Section Trunk Arrangement:
[32725] <prose> <tantra>Before, what done, look at present body;</tantra>
[32726] <prose> <tantra>Where going next, look at present mind—thus.</tantra> || 12300 ||
[32727] <prose> Thus thinking, now abandon non-virtue, accomplish virtue, always abide mind in holy Dharma.
[32728] <prose> For Dharma alone benefits; other than Dharma, nothing reaches benefit.
[32729] <prose> From the Sutra Asked by the Girl Jewel:
[32730] <prose> <tantra>Here father, mother, relatives,</tantra>
[32731] <prose> <tantra>Retinue and relatives do not become refuge;</tantra>
[32732] <prose> <tantra>Sons and daughters likewise not protectors.</tantra>
[32733] <prose> <tantra>Except these quality-possessors,</tantra>
[32734] <prose> <tantra>No others become world's protector-shelter—thus.</tantra>
[32735] <prose> From the Sutra of Instruction to the King:
[32736] <prose> <tantra>As time's danger, king becoming to go,</tantra> || 12310 ||
[32737] <prose> <tantra>Enjoyment, friend, relative, dear do not accompany;</tantra>
[32738] <prose> <tantra>Birth-beings wherever from wherever go,</tantra>
[32739] <prose> <tantra>Karma follows as shadow accompanies—thus.</tantra>
[32740] <prose> Second, producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on cause of certain decay:
[32741] <prose> Thus, having obtained such difficult leisure, — yet being aggregate of gathered four elements, certain to decay as compounded,
[32742] <prose> like bubble-burst aggregate, this when no decay-opportunity exists, now in this unperished support, by self do holy liberation Dharma.
[32743] <prose> Need to think from heart: what does this life's appearance do, like dream magical-illusion?
[32744] <prose> From the Ratnagotra Tantra:
[32745] <tantra> In coarse element forms,
[32746] <tantra> Alas, no ground to sit; || 12320 ||
[32747] <tantra> To birth-being's stable life breath,
[32748] <tantra> Alas, time does not strike;
[32749] <tantra> In group six's object appearance,
[32750] <tantra> Alas, nothing permanent;
[32751] <tantra> In birth-being's remember-thought arise-feel,
[32752] <tantra> Alas, nothing exhausts;
[32753] <tantra> In suffering arisen from body,
[32754] <tantra> Alas, nothing pure—thus.
[32755] <prose> Thus though impermanent, grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused.
[32756] <prose> Thinking from heart: self must not become like that; by self benefit given to others? || 12330 ||
[32757] <prose> Enemies conquered?
[32758] <prose> Lands obtained?
[32759] <prose> Whatever done, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind.
[32760] <prose> Thus though impermanent,
[32761] <prose> grasping as permanent and true, birth-beings attached to this life's appearance are confused.
[32762] <prose> Thinking from heart: self must not become like that.
[32763] <prose> By self benefit given to others?
[32764] <prose> Enemies conquered?
[32765] <prose> Lands obtained?
[32766] <prose> Whatever done, all without essence and deceiving, look only at self's inner mind. || 12340 ||
[32767] <tantra> From the presence of Glorious Atisha:
[32768] <tantra> Exclamation! Looking far at world's conducts,
[32769] <tantra> All doing is purposeless, cause of suffering;
[32770] <tantra> Whatever is thought, benefit not reached—
[32771] <tantra> Habituate looking at self's mind,
[32772] <tantra> Like thus requested.
[32773] <prose> Even if liberated at the ground-ground, one may revert,
[32774] <prose> For that basis, though confusion may arise, is posited from the aspect of delusion.
[32775] <prose> Because it is the ground of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[32776] <prose> The liberation-place itself is the first, it is said. || 12350 ||
