[21095] <prose> The first aspect:
[21096] <prose> Though essence is one, the Three Kayas abide in the expanse through different aspects. || 670 ||
[21097] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[21098] <verse> Three Kayas, wisdom-appearance,
[21099] <prose> Without obstruction to anything;
[21100] <prose> Perceived objects being one,
[21101] <prose> Essence appearing individually.
[21102] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21103] <prose> This is the manner of awareness-itself's appearance.
[21104] <tantra> From that same nature:
[21105] <verse> Thought-free awareness, Dharmakāya's essence;
[21106] <prose> Uncensored clear awareness, Sambhogakāya; || 680 ||
[21107] <prose> Whatever-appearing awareness, Nirmāṇakāya.
[21108] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[21109] <prose> In this, complete;
[21110] <prose> Awakened.
