[31608] <tantra> From that:
[31609] <prose> Effort-possessing person,
[31610] <prose> Body signs complete,
[31611] <prose> In bardo reality,
[31612] <prose> See truth, Buddha.

[31618] <prose> Of life formation,
[31619] <prose> Like shooting star in sky,
[31620] <prose> In three instants as shooting way,
[31621] <prose> With emanation also,
[31622] <prose> Self-dissolves into essence.
[31623] <prose> If body, speech, mind signs gather,
[31624] <prose> This great bodhicitta,
[31625] <prose> Compassion possessing beings' holder,
[31626] <prose> This for holding beings, || 11200 ||
[31627] <prose> In hundred thousand million years,
[31628] <prose> Even with one human body,
[31629] <prose> Completing this meaning,
[31630] <prose> Not entering between two births,
[31631] <prose> Complete attainment.
[31632] <prose> Also whoever fortunate,
[31633] <prose> Possessing body and mind signs,
[31634] <prose> Thus possessing, in ten years,
[31635] <prose> Dissolves elements to self-place,
[31636] <prose> Appearance not appearing, || 11210 ||
[31637] <prose> Delivers to pure reality ground.
[31638] <prose> Who body, speech, mind signs,
[31639] <prose> Thus to fortunate person,
[31640] <prose> To whoever fortunate gathering,
[31641] <prose> Even in two years from this,
[31642] <prose> Dissolves this elements to self,
[31643] <prose> Without doubt this changes.

[31658] <prose>
[31659] <prose> Outer-inner certain signs exist as liberate measure thus. Liberate not pervaded by merely existing signs. Because liberate pervaded by existing signs, this special is important.
[31660] <tantra> From Blazing Relics:
[31661] <prose> All body, speech, mind signs,
[31662] <prose> Some arisen person,
[31663] <prose> Not completely liberated—
[31664] <prose> Worldly common siddhi and
[31665] <prose> Gradually sravaka pratyekabuddha,
[31666] <prose> All these grounds, || 11240 ||
[31667] <prose> This entered that ground,
[31668] <prose> Without pure great result.
[31669] <prose> Who possesses body, speech,
[31670] <prose> Signs complete person,
[31671] <prose> Even in equal great ground,
[31672] <prose> All these go, dakini.
[31673] <prose> Thus said signs only exist without certainty. Now without any outer-inner liberate signs, gone without meditation, action not harm, meditation not needed. Later do not place skull on head. Though saying view-meditation complete, seeing reality original meaning, know demon enters deceiving other and self both by sending lie.
[31674] <tantra> From that:
[31675] <prose> Thus not possessing signs,
[31676] <prose> Entering confidence in own-appearance, || 11250 ||
[31677] <prose> Who claims acceptance that,
[31678] <prose> Examination view and

[31685] <tantra> From that:
[31686] <prose> Therefore expanse-awareness familiar important. || 11260 ||
[31687] <prose> Who familiar with expanse and awareness,

[31689] <prose> Impossible to not arise.
[31690] <prose> Do diligence as well spoken.
[31691] <ornament> General meaning third: conclusion of signs certain of liberation and confusion in bardo and next life—two aspects.

[31700] <prose> Signs of yogin liberating and obtaining enlightenment, and showing signs of six beings taking birth through confusion.
[31701] <prose> Of the first, two aspects:
[31702] <prose> Brief showing of signs,
[31703] <prose> Extensive explanation.
[31704] <ornament> Of the first:
[31705] <prose> Even meditating reality direct meaning, if diligence inferior, measure not reached. At time of separating solid-awareness with stone, signs of liberating from defilements without taking existence—complete buddhahood by great appearance of self-relics, sound, and light.
[31706] <prose> That also: Great Perfection's system has two Buddha ways—complete Buddha by appearing signs is nirvāṇa with remainder, stone with residue; perfectly complete Buddha by excellent diligence, pure stone with, is nirvāṇa without aggregates' remainder. || 11280 ||
[31707] <tantra> From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror Tantra:

[31709] <prose> Perfectly complete Buddha and
[31710] <prose> Complete Buddha.
[31711] <prose> Of that, perfectly complete Buddha is
[31712] <prose> Buddhahood without aggregates' remainder.
[31713] <prose> To complete Buddha person,
[31714] <prose> Light and
[31715] <prose> Sound and
[31716] <prose> Relics and || 11290 ||
[31717] <prose> Kaya and
[31718] <prose> Earth move etcetera arise, said.
[31719] <tantra> From Blazing Relics:
[31720] <prose> Excellent wisdom-power person,
[31721] <prose> Elements dissolve to self-place
[31722] <tantra> From confusion appearance this,
[31723] <prose> To essence result,
[31724] <prose> Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
[31725] <prose> Result becomes self-ground.
[31726] <prose> Thus outer signs, || 11300 ||
[31727] <prose> What from nirvāṇa,
[31728] <prose> To that kaya and relics and
[31729] <prose> Likewise light and sound and
[31730] <prose> Earth moves.
[31731] <prose> Second, extensive explanation—five:
[31732] <prose> Kaya, relics, light, sound, and earth move.
[31733] <prose> Of the first, essence, division, cause, place, and result.

[31744] <prose> Essence: appearing as deity forms—single kaya, half-kaya, father-mother, mass, great mandala; according to that direction, stupa, wheel, vajra, jewel, lotus, cross, sword, etcetera.
[31745] <tantra> From not reaching creation-completion, letters, hand-symbols, half-kaya, self-single appear; from complete, father-mother, mass, mandala appear.
[31746] <prose> Division: peaceful kaya and wrathful kaya two. || 11320 ||
