[29453] <ornament> First:
[29454] <prose> Sitting cross-legged, placing upon red-clear, clear, round light-appearance by thumb-and-finger pressing, taking as experience.
[29455] <prose> Making sessions short, the number many.
[29456] <prose> Releasing thumb-and-finger effort, looking slowly. || 9030 ||
[29457] <prose> Seeing appearance by pressing again is called dharmatā directly manifest appearance.
[29458] <tantra> From that same source:
[29459] <tantra> By one's own thumb and finger,
[29460] <tantra> Press the bindu-empty lamp.
[29461] <tantra> What arises from that pressing
[29462] <tantra> Is dharmatā's directly manifest appearance.
[29463] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29464] <prose> Entering clearly:
[29465] <prose> Then from five-light appearance, first like smoke,
[29466] <prose> Like dull illusion, || 9040 ||
[29467] <prose> Like hovering clouds,
[29468] <prose> Like emanating fire sparks,
[29469] <prose> Sun and moon,
[29470] <prose> Like star forms,
[29471] <prose> Like intermediate-space rainbow,
[29472] <prose> White clear light,
[29473] <prose> Yellow clear,
[29474] <prose> Red clear,
[29475] <prose> Green clear,
[29476] <prose> Blue, || 9050 ||
[29477] <prose> Various,
[29478] <prose> Net pattern,
[29479] <prose> Arising rays,
[29480] <prose> Round gatherings,
[29481] <prose> Bindus,
[29482] <prose> Stupas,
[29483] <prose> God-bodies,
[29484] <list> At the time of self-appearing various sentient-being forms here and there, far and near,
[29485] <prose> By entering clearly, five-wind arise-appearance arises measurelessly.
[29486] <tantra> From the Thalgyur: || 9060 ||
[29487] <tantra> From that, wisdom-expanding experience,
[29488] <tantra> Also of color and shape,
[29489] <tantra> Pervading all outer and inner clearly,
[29490] <tantra> Certainly expanding from above to above.
[29491] <tantra> At this time, body-speech bliss signs.
[29492] <tantra> Join with appearance measure and manner.
[29493] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[29494] <prose> Third, the manner of appearance-arising from that:
