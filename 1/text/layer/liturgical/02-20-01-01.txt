[28509] <prose> Samsara cycles namelessly.
[28510] <prose> Through that life, the excellence of liberation through light has entered.
[28511] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[28512] <tantra> Since this reveals the natural realm,
[28513] <tantra> Without entering the circle of conditions,
[28514] <tantra> Unobstructed and directly emerged,
[28515] <tantra> From the appearance aspect of objects and awareness,
[28516] <tantra> Liberated directly at each one's own ground. || 8090 ||
[28517] <prose> Thus it is said.
[28518] <prose> If one asks: What difference exists between being liberated from the aggregates through Trekchö without reaching the full measure of appearance, even when Trekchö is manifested?
[28519] <prose> It is very great.
[28520] <prose> Even when manifested through Trekchö, going into light from atomic particles without parts is impossible.
[28521] <prose> Without going into light, the vajra body is not established;
[28522] <prose> Through the occasional illusion body, the final result is not traversed.
[28523] <prose> Without obtaining the body of light, the great transference body is not attained,
[28524] <prose> And therefore the vast benefit for others through that support is not accomplished.
[28525] <prose> Thus from the aspect of entering light and atomic particles,
[28526] <prose> the great transference cannot perform benefit, while the eye of wisdom and clairvoyance, || 8100 ||
[28527] <prose> the accomplishment of miraculous powers—there exists distinction of magnitude.
[28528] <list> Second:
[28529] <prose> Although rigpa is spoken of as luminosity from the beginning, through Trekchö's estimation of emptiness, its own light is not seen.
[28530] <prose> Through Thögal's application of crucial points, when dharmatā's essence-luminosity is internally captured,
[28531] <prose> the individual's own-resonance luminosity appears externally as practical display—this is superior.
[28532] <tantra> From the Rangshar:
[28533] <tantra> This King of Rigpa, self-appearance,
[28534] <tantra> Exists in all yet is unrecognized.
[28535] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28536] <list> Third: || 8110 ||
[28537] <prose> The pristine wisdom of rigpa not seen in Trekchö, covered by expansion, determined as only one without seeing—
[28538] <prose> in Thögal, through the opening of pristine wisdom's vision, dharmatā's sun-rays appearing clear:
[28539] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[28540] <tantra> Through dharmatā's direct appearance,
[28541] <tantra> The view of intellectual grasping is consumed.
[28542] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28543] <list> Fourth:
[28544] <prose> In Trekchö, relying upon coarse nāḍī and prāṇa,
[28545] <prose> in Thögal, capturing the pure light-nāḍī and actualizing the four lamps on the Path—
[28546] <tantra> From that very source: || 8120 ||
[28547] <tantra> Moreover through nāḍī and illusory wheel,
[28548] <tantra> The five wisdoms of natural appearance,
[28549] <tantra> Are seen by the water-bubble eye.
[28550] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28551] <list> Fifth:
[28552] <prose> In Trekchö, seeking clarity through the six sense-doors not purified, through the mind's phenomena; in Thögal, through the pure luminosity-door opened by wisdom-prāṇa, the four lamps' appearance dawns—this is superior.
[28553] <tantra> From that very source:
[28554] <tantra> However it arises from the door,
[28555] <tantra> Through entering-prāṇa's force,
[28556] <tantra> From the four lamps, four activities arise. || 8130 ||
[28557] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28558] <list> Sixth:
[28559] <prose> In Trekchö, seeking clarity through the door of rigpa's self-clarity without seeing;
[28560] <prose> in Thögal, through the wisdom-door of external-internal spontaneous presence,
[28561] <prose> the appearance of dharmadhātu and wisdom without separation or dispersion is directly examined—this distinctive excellence is superior.
[28562] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[28563] <tantra> To the pure dharmadhātu lamp,
[28564] <tantra> Bindus, bodies, and illusory appearances,
[28565] <break> <tantra> Natural expression and essence-nature,
[28566] <break> <tantra> Non-dual without separation or dispersion, appear. || 8140 ||
[28567] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28568] <list> Seventh:
[28569] <prose> In Trekchö, having caused external objects and internal mind's delusion to appear, through resting in the state without rejection or acceptance, those are not quickly liberated.
[28570] <prose> In Thögal, from the moment of applying crucial points,
[28571] <prose> external-internal illusory appearances together with deluded apprehension are self-liberated;
[28572] <prose> not depending upon purification resting in the state without abandoning,
[28573] <prose> wisdom's increasing appearance waxes like the moon's waxing fortnight,
[28574] <prose> the four appearances reaching full measure and quickly liberated.
[28575] <tantra> From that source:
[28576] <tantra> The manner of appearance is not delusion, || 8150 ||
[28577] <tantra> In the nature of pure causal conditions,
[28578] <tantra> Entities and non-entities self-purified,
[28579] <tantra> The five doors' object-grasping purified,
[28580] <tantra> The coarse elements purified,
[28581] <tantra> Pristine wisdom purified, increasing appearance shown,
[28582] <tantra> From that, exhausted dharmatā.
[28583] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28584] <prose> Although these distinctions, analyzed in detail, are inconceivable,
[28585] <prose> I speak merely a brief outline.
[28586] <prose> In summary: through directly seeing rigpa's actual meaning and its visible presence, || 8160 ||
[28587] <prose> delusion reverses in a single moment; through the body of investigation,
[28588] <prose> having made delusory appearance the Path, seeking the result of non-delusion—through this distinctive excellence, those possessing the eye of wisdom should understand.
[28589] <prose> Since this Dharma possesses such crucial points, it is called the supreme pinnacle of all.
[28590] <list> Second: The presentation of Thögal possessing distinctive excellence has three parts:
[28591] <list> The general presentation of the three crucial points of dharmatā's wheel;
[28592] <list> The detailed explanation of the day-night luminosity wheel's manner of engagement;
[28593] <list> The extensive presentation of the vast expanse wisdom wheel.
[28594] <list> First has four parts:
[28595] <list> The body's three crucial points of posture;
[28596] <list> The door's three crucial points of gaze; || 8170 ||
[28597] <list> The dharmadhātu's three crucial points of guidance;
[28598] <list> The object's three crucial points of appearance.
[28599] <list> First:
[28600] <prose> Whichever of the body's three postures one assumes,
[28601] <prose> there is purpose in resting the nāḍī-prāṇa in ease with relaxed abdomen;
[28602] <prose> if deliberately constrained, prāṇa and so forth become inverted and scattered, causing nāḍī constriction and excessive tension.
[28603] <prose> Therefore, together with the gaze, this distinctive Dharma of crucial points—drawing out slowly through the mouth from prāṇa dwelling extremely gently—is most important.
[28604] <prose> This, the common manner of exhaling and inhaling through the nose, filling the four wheels internally, generating clarity-luminosity samādhi,
[28605] <prose> in that manner: inverted prāṇa,
[28606] <prose> scattered prāṇa, || 8180 ||
[28607] <prose> whirling prāṇa,
[28608] <prose> the four obscurations of sluggishness arising, various delusory appearances not dawning.
[28609] <prose> Here, purification of prāṇa does not increase the Path,
[28610] <prose> yet filling with the four wheels internally, although discursive thought's expansion is momentarily stopped, it cannot ultimately be stopped;
[28611] <prose> therefore, karmic prāṇa self-ceases and is released through the mouth.
[28612] <prose> Through the nose, entering solely the taste-channel,
[28613] <prose> then entering internally through the root of all four wheels,
[28614] <prose> discursive thought's various movements making the mind race—having blocked this here,
[28615] <prose> connecting mouth and throat,
[28616] <prose> through the throat's nāḍī like a grass-stalk's hollow, the mind's racing horse internally self-ceases and is released; || 8190 ||
[28617] <prose> therefore, drawing prāṇa slowly out through the mouth and dwelling however long,
[28618] <prose> horse and rider separate individually,
[28619] <prose> the person dissolving into the heart's internal rigpa, accomplishing non-conceptual samādhi in spontaneous flow—this is the crucial point.
[28620] <prose> Occasionally, prāṇa with rushing sound and force violently expelled,
[28621] <prose> the obscuration of prāṇa-gathering, unpleasant mind,
[28622] <prose> afflictive discursive thought's movement,
[28623] <prose> heart-center's pain—all are cleared.
[28624] <prose> At those times, violent expulsion is the supreme crucial point.
[28625] <prose> Moreover, not knowing this prāṇa-crucial point, even if meditated, appearance's increase and signs reaching measure will certainly not arise.
[28626] <list> Second, the door-gaze's three crucial points: || 8200 ||
[28627] <prose> Whichever of the three gazes one performs, without constraining through effort,
[28628] <prose> relaxing internally in natural flow,
[28629] <prose> eyes unmoving, pressing the gaze is that crucial point.
[28630] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[28631] <tantra> Distant-set without movement is the crucial point;
[28632] <tantra> At this time, apply the three gazes.
[28633] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28634] <list> Third, regarding the dharmadhātu-guidance's three crucial points:
[28635] <prose> Slowly with eyes' corners, up and down, into dharmadhātu appearance's sharp edge, eyes unmoving, recognition unmoved, awareness resting in clarity-emptiness single-pointedly—this is the crucial point.
[28636] <tantra> From that very source: || 8210 ||
[28637] <tantra> Dharmadhātu's crucial point is guidance;
[28638] <tantra> thus it is spoken, and:
[28639] <tantra> From the Rtsal Dzog:
[28640] <tantra> In dharmadhātu, mindfulness awakened, sky-space,
[28641] <tantra> Appearing as five masses, garuḍa of gold soaring,
[28642] <tantra> Without grasping attachment, without conceptual extremes, hovering.
[28643] <tantra> In self-appearance without directional falling, sky-space,
[28644] <tantra> Luminous-emptiness free from elaboration, garuḍa soaring,
[28645] <tantra> Without grasping appearance, in that state hovering.
[28646] <tantra> In signs free from elaboration, sky-space, || 8220 ||
[28647] <tantra> Free from grasping and apprehending, dharmakāya's garuḍa soaring,
[28648] <tantra> Dharmatā's self-appearance in bindu's state hovering.
[28649] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28650] <list> Fourth:
[28651] <prose> Through focusing upon external space-object cloudless sky, rigpa clears and opens, appearance quickly increasing;
[28652] <prose> through focusing upon internal dharmadhātu lamp, luminosity mother-child connect;
[28653] <prose> through focusing upon secret object rigpa's self-clarity, the meaning of primordial purity and exhausted phenomena self-clarifies in its own place—there exists this crucial point.
[28654] <tantra> From the Rangshar:
[28655] <tantra> In the sky-empty maṇḍala of space,
[28656] <tantra> The uncontrived four lamps, || 8230 ||
[28657] <tantra> Unceasing through meaning's nature, clear.
[28658] <tantra> Rigpa, dharmadhātu's lamp,
[28659] <tantra> In sky-empty vast expanse's center,
[28660] <tantra> Dharmadhātu's nature, light-body,
[28661] <tantra> Unceasing, unceased, clearly appearing.
[28662] <tantra> Five wisdoms complete, heart-mind's body,
[28663] <tantra> Arising in garuḍa-fashion.
[28664] <tantra> That too: going and coming,
[28665] <tantra> Movement and trembling.
[28666] <tantra> Rigpa, dharmadhātu's lamp, || 8240 ||
[28667] <tantra> Placed within, rigpa unmoved,
[28668] <tantra> Unchanging realization excellently explained.
[28669] <tantra> Self-arisen wisdom's lamp,
[28670] <tantra> Cutting all superimpositions,
[28671] <tantra> Empty bindu's lamp,
[28672] <tantra> Without effort, arisen,
[28673] <tantra> Distant ropes, water's lamp,
[28674] <tantra> Gazing there unmoving,
[28675] <tantra> Perfection of meditation's measure thus spoken.
[28676] <tantra> Thus it is spoken, and: || 8250 ||
[28677] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[28678] <tantra> This itself, the object's crucial point is thus:
[28679] <tantra> In cloudless external object-emptiness,
[28680] <tantra> The yogin dwells in sky's bird-path;
[28681] <tantra> Not separating from this is dharmatā.
[28682] <tantra> Thus it is spoken, and:
[28683] <tantra> Moreover:
[28684] <tantra> The characteristics of appearance's object are:
[28685] <tantra> In blue-green limitless sky,
[28686] <tantra> Light and color and form, || 8260 ||
[28687] <tantra> Five wisdoms' self-appearance shown.
[28688] <tantra> To the pure dharmadhātu lamp,
[28689] <break> <tantra> Bindus, bodies, and illusory appearances,
[28690] <break> <tantra> Natural expression and essence-nature,
[28691] <tantra> Non-dual without separation or dispersion, appear.
[28692] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28693] <prose> At this time, although subtle discursive thought sha-ra-ra arises from prāṇa moving within the nāḍī,
[28694] <prose> there is no harm to directly perceived meaning;
[28695] <prose> that very discursive thought, unable to establish itself by itself, liberates and vanishes—
[28696] <prose> like a bird of prey catching and releasing, || 8270 ||
[28697] <prose> though attention scatters elsewhere, without distraction like continuous garuḍa-thread,
[28698] <break> <tantra> karmic traces are not accumulated,
[28699] <tantra> Luminosity's meditation is not destroyed;
[28700] <break> <tantra> Rigpa's potency placed in arising,
[28701] <tantra> Wisdom spontaneously born, opening opportunity.
[28702] <prose> Moreover, through gaze-posture constraining, coarse discursive thought greatly blocked self-ceases;
[28703] <prose> subtle, small, fine discursive thought all self-liberated—
[28704] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[28705] <tantra> From single intent, no movement,
[28706] <tantra> Appearance's appearance clear on appearance's peak, || 8280 ||
[28707] <tantra> From face and mirror-like,
[28708] <tantra> Liberation is that and that itself liberated.
[28709] <tantra> Knowing movement empty-vanished,
[28710] <tantra> Seeing-knowing rigpa not different.
[28711] <tantra> That itself liberated at its own peak.
[28712] <tantra> Through single knowing, all liberated;
[28713] <tantra> Two and three's numbers reach exhaustion.
[28714] <tantra> Conceptualizing and grasping's object not appearing;
[28715] <tantra> Movement and grasping primordially empty.
[28716] <tantra> Empty intent clear-perfected, || 8290 ||
[28717] <tantra> Multiple numbers reach exhaustion.
[28718] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28719] <prose> At this time, the intent of View, Meditation, and Conduct three is gathered into single expanse:
[28720] <tantra> From Vajrasattva's heart-mirror:
[28721] <tantra> Without nihilistic extreme-falling, possessing View's measure;
[28722] <tantra> Without conceptuality in clarity, possessing Meditation's measure;
[28723] <tantra> Without contrivance in self-arising, possessing Conduct's measure;
[28724] <tantra> Great bliss without outflow, this non-entity enlightenment,
[28725] <tantra> Like water-moon, not held by grasping;
[28726] <tantra> Like lord's treasure, self-arising desires. || 8300 ||
[28727] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28728] <prose> Moreover, if dharmadhātu-rigpa's appearance has not dawned, through gazing evenly at the eye's corner,
[28729] <prose> at the time of seeing, looking unmovingly at the center of sky's maṇḍala of darkness and light is the crucial point.
[28730] <tantra> From the Yige Medpa:
[28731] <tantra> Rigpa resting-naturally, crucial instruction itself,
[28732] <tantra> This is secret heart-essence;
[28733] <tantra> Eyes should be firmly settled,
[28734] <break> <tantra> That too, examine without separation or dispersion.
[28735] <break> <tantra> From eye's corner, dharmadhātu arises;
[28736] <tantra> Light, subtle, coiling arises. || 8310 ||
[28737] <tantra> That essence, garuḍa-fashion,
[28738] <tantra> Subtle, trembling, and moving.
[28739] <break> <tantra> Eyes rest in sky's element;
[28740] <break> <tantra> Buddha-body's bindu appears.
[28741] <tantra> From that, finding intent's warmth,
[28742] <tantra> Rigpa's body is garuḍa-fashion,
[28743] <tantra> Together with body, appearance.
[28744] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28745] <prose> At this juncture, the three certainty-pledges of luminosity's determining are:
[28746] <list> The manner of mind's stains purifying in essence-intent; || 8320 ||
[28747] <list> The manner of resting evenly in state without movement;
[28748] <list> The manner of signs-measure time-certain arising from that.
[28749] <list> First has three parts:
[28750] <list> Essence-intent itself;
[28751] <list> Mind and traces' illustrative examples;
[28752] <list> The main pledge of separation from that.
[28753] <list> First:
[28754] <tantra> From Samantabhadra's mind-mirror:
[28755] <tantra> Unwavering sky, thus rigpa clear,
[28756] <tantra> Clear without distraction, depth unfathomable state; || 8330 ||
[28757] <tantra> Luminous-emptiness vast, great bliss dharmadhātu, engage.
[28758] <tantra> Single-pointed clarity, ultimate dharmadhātu's state;
[28759] <tantra> Unmixed perfection, spontaneously accomplished ground abide.
[28760] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28761] <prose> In rigpa's essence, four wisdoms arising as self-potency show realization's superior seeing of natural state.
[28762] <list> The four wisdoms:
[28763] <tantra> From the Rangshar:
[28764] <tantra> Moreover upon rigpa's essence,
[28765] <tantra> Wisdom possessing four aspects,
[28766] <tantra> These four wisdoms thus: || 8340 ||
[28767] <tantra> Liberating wisdom, liberating all,
[28768] <tantra> Liberating everything completely;
[28769] <tantra> Afflictions purified, liberated into pure field,
[28770] <tantra> Without concept, without birth, liberated into state,
[28771] <tantra> Ignorance into rigpa's expanse liberated,
[28772] <tantra> Wisdom conceptuality into state liberated;
[28773] <tantra> Therefore, liberating wisdom.
[28774] <tantra> Stirring wisdom, moving
[28775] <tantra> Five bodies pure, into dharmadhātu moving,
[28776] <tantra> Five lights, grasping-free, into dharmadhātu moving, || 8350 ||
[28777] <tantra> Rigpa pristine wisdom, into dharmadhātu moving,
[28778] <tantra> Lamps sky-space, into dharmadhātu moving;
[28779] <tantra> Therefore, stirring wisdom.
[28780] <tantra> Gathering wisdom, gathering
[28781] <tantra> Elements five lights, internally gathering,
[28782] <tantra> Sky-space lamps, internally gathering,
[28783] <tantra> Five bodies' rigpa's state, internally gathering,
[28784] <tantra> Rigpa without concept, internally gathering;
[28785] <tantra> Therefore, gathering wisdom,
[28786] <tantra> Gathering elements five lights internally, || 8360 ||
[28787] <tantra> Gathering sky-space lamps internally,
[28788] <tantra> Gathering five bodies rigpa's state internally,
[28789] <tantra> Gathering rigpa without concept internally;
[28790] <tantra> Therefore, gathering wisdom.
[28791] <tantra> Distinguishing wisdom, distinguishing
[28792] <tantra> Ignorance and rigpa, distinguishing two,
[28793] <tantra> Afflictions and pristine wisdom, distinguishing two,
[28794] <tantra> Pure and impure, distinguishing two,
[28795] <tantra> Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, distinguishing two,
[28796] <tantra> Realized and unrealized, distinguishing two, || 8370 ||
[28797] <tantra> Good and bad, distinguishing two;
[28798] <tantra> Therefore, distinguishing wisdom.
[28799] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28800] <prose> Second, at that time, mind and traces' intent-purifications purifying:
[28801] <prose> The illustrative example of that:
[28802] <tantra> From Vajrasattva's heart-mirror:
[28803] <tantra> Emaho, Vajradhara, listen!
[28804] <tantra> Unmatured discursive thought, saṃsāra,
[28805] <tantra> Like iron inserted in gold,
[28806] <tantra> Not liberated, liberation's time not arising. || 8380 ||
[28807] <tantra> Ignorance iron-inserted, not liberated;
[28808] <tantra> Ignorance like water, afflictions gather.
[28809] <tantra> Anger-fire like kalpa's fire-mass;
[28810] <tantra> Attachment, whatever, like drinking brine-water;
[28811] <tantra> Delusion-darkness like empty house darkness;
[28812] <tantra> Pride-arrogance like pressing down mountains;
[28813] <tantra> Jealousy ill-will like narrow dark valleys;
[28814] <tantra> Five afflictions, wisdom's obscuration making;
[28815] <tantra> Mind like bitch-thief;
[28816] <tantra> Consciousness like forest monkey; || 8390 ||
[28817] <tantra> Mind like impure swamp;
[28818] <tantra> All-basis like sentient-being pig;
[28819] <tantra> Knowing like bird-feather wind-carried;
[28820] <tantra> Grasping-apprehending like man woman;
[28821] <tantra> Karmic varieties like bird-swarm circling;
[28822] <tantra> Suffering varieties like water's ripples;
[28823] <tantra> Affliction-result, endurance method lacking;
[28824] <tantra> Saṃsāra's suffering, grasping-apprehending thorn-needle this,
[28825] <tantra> By doing not released, by leaving released becomes;
[28826] <tantra> Abandoning done phenomena, ease accomplished; || 8400 ||
[28827] <tantra> Abandoning all thought, supreme wisdom unmoved;
[28828] <tantra> Secret mantra king, afflictions into wisdom transformed;
[28829] <tantra> Like empty house lamp-kindled,
[28830] <tantra> Wisdom-lamp, ignorance into rigpa transformed.
[28831] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[28832] <list> Third, the manner of separation from that has three parts:
[28833] <list> Direct perception's own-time separation itself;
[28834] <list> Establishing separation's validity;
[28835] <list> Speaking other designations.
[28836] <list> First: || 8410 ||
[28837] <prose> Through looking at external appearance-luminosity,
[28838] <prose> without delusion, internal self-clarity's meditation self-clear at that time,
[28839] <prose> mind and wisdom momentarily parting back-to-back, all-basis eight-collections together with wisdom covered,
