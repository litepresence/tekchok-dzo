[36862] <ornament> The First:
[36863] <prose> In Dharmatā, from the perspective of that upon which one looks, since the essence of any is not established, it is free from the extremes of elaboration;
[36864] <prose> Since it transcends the grasping of entity identity, it is without arising, ceasing, transference, or transformation;
[36865] <break> <prose> Since the ultimate is directly manifest, Dharmatā is inconceivable.
[36866] <break> <ornament> The Second: || 16440 ||
[36867] <prose> Hence, the Dharmakāya pervading all of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, possessing twofold purity—pure through the purification of adventitious stains—is That.
[36868] <tantra> From Hevajra:
[36869] <tantra> "Sentient beings are truly Buddhas,
[36870] <tantra> Yet obscured by adventitious stains.
[36871] <tantra> When these are cleared away, they are truly Buddhas."
[36872] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[36873] <tantra> From Uttaratantra:
[36874] <verse> "The Perfect Buddha's Body is emanating,
[36875] <verse> Suchness is without distinction,
[36876] <verse> Because of possessing the Lineage, all sentient beings || 16450 ||
[36877] <verse> Always possess the Essence of Buddhahood."
[36878] <verse> Thus the portion of direct manifestation is spoken.
[36879] <ornament> The Third:
[36880] <prose> Each vehicle demonstrates Rigpa,
[36881] <prose> Emptiness,
[36882] <prose> And qualities and so forth.
[36883] <prose> Here in the Great Perfection, if divided through miraculous display:
[36884] <prose> Dharmakāya's Dharmakāya fields—inconceivable;
[36885] <prose> Abode—Dharmatā transcending the mind's grasping;
[36886] <prose> Samādhi—great Immovable; || 16460 ||
[36887] <prose> Retinue—various self-nature, non-dual;
[36888] <prose> Teaching—indescribable Dharmatā;
[36889] <prose> Time—Dharmatā without transformation at any time.
[36890] <prose> Dharmakāya's Saṃbhogakāya fields—free from dust, without stain;
[36891] <prose> Abode—memory, mind's thought self-dissolved;
[36892] <prose> Samādhi—cessation of mind and mental factors' arisings, wisdom self-abiding;
[36893] <prose> Retinue—empty, self-appearance's agent;
[36894] <prose> Teaching—pure, complete perception;
[36895] <prose> Time—without investigation, great primordial equality.
[36896] <prose> Dharmakāya's Nirmāṇakāya: || 16470 ||
[36897] <prose> Fields—emptiness, unbroken space;
[36898] <prose> Abode—arising-ground of all, great self-clarity of depth;
[36899] <prose> Samādhi—unceasing, self-clear;
[36900] <prose> Retinue—pure appearance without class-distinction;
[36901] <prose> Teaching—unfabricated self-nature;
[36902] <prose> Time—essence directly manifest.
[36903] <prose> These too are designated from Dharmakāya's aspect of primordial purity self-abiding.
[36904] <tantra> From Ratnaketu:
[36905] <break> <tantra> "Through self-pure Dharmakāya,
[36906] <break> <tantra> Self-pure without elaboration, in celestial palace, || 16480 ||
[36907] <tantra> In appearance-retinue nondual with oneself,
[36908] <tantra> Through markless Speech,
[36909] <tantra> Elaboration-free words
[36910] <tantra> Are emitted from nonabiding self-dissolved Mind.
[36911] <tantra> Without speaking, without having spoken,
[36912] <tantra> Shown in the state of Great Equality."
[36913] <tantra> Thus it is.
[36914] <prose> These too are merely designated as aspects;
[36915] <prose> In meaning, since established nowhere, they abide in Great Perfection free from extremes.
[36916] <tantra> From that very text: || 16490 ||
[36917] <tantra> "This abode of 'this,'
[36918] <tantra> The named designated field with its marks,
[36919] <tantra> Whatever form appears nowhere,
[36920] <tantra> Nonexistent emptiness from Dharmodaya,
[36921] <tantra> In the great secret Expanse,
[36922] <tantra> Abiding from the primordial beginning,
[36923] <tantra> Ungrasped, in the manner of abiding,
[36924] <tantra> Great Play arose primordially.
[36925] <tantra> Here none abide.
[36926] <tantra> None make an abode. || 16500 ||
[36927] <tantra> Here there is no perfection.
[36928] <tantra> Devoid of dwelling and coming.
[36929] <tantra> Thus, the place of great primordial emptiness,
[36930] <tantra> From nonexistence, the Expanse's field,
[36931] <tantra> Here there is neither outer nor inner.
[36932] <tantra> Above and below, no looking.
[36933] <tantra> In directions and intermediate points, none ever
[36934] <tantra> Has anything to grasp here."
[36935] <tantra> Thus it is.
[36936] <ornament> The Fourth: Extensive explanation of enumerations: || 16510 ||
[36937] <tantra> From Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities, and Activities—five:
[36938] <prose> Dharmakāya's Body—empty-clarity, markless;
[36939] <prose> Speech—indescribable, transcending words and speech;

[36941] <prose> Qualities—never regressing, without transformation;
[36942] <prose> Activities—spontaneous presence, abiding as ground of unceasing manifestation-manner.
[36943] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[36944] <tantra> "Dharmakāya: Body and Speech,
[36945] <tantra> Mind and Qualities and Activities.
[36946] <tantra> Body: emptiness and clarity, || 16520 ||

[36956] <tantra> Arising potency, without ceasing, || 16530 ||
[36957] <tantra> Without making, without having made."
[36958] <tantra> Thus it is.
[36959] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya extensively explained also comprises
[36960] <prose> Essence,
[36961] <break> <prose> Definitive terminology,
[36962] <break> <prose> Divisions,
[36963] <prose> And enumerations—four aspects.
[36964] <prose> Essence's defining characteristic: completely perfect in great self-clarity,
[36965] <prose> Essence's abiding manner: unchanging in nature, Kāya of marks and signs, families clearly manifest yet unmoving.
[36966] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya's definitive terminology: engaging in appearance as Saṃbhogakāya, in that itself wisdom unceasingly engaging. || 16540 ||
[36967] <prose> Kāya: great self-clear display-arrangement.
[36968] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya's divisions are four:
[36969] <list> Great element Essence-Kāya;
[36970] <list> All-pervading abiding manner Kāya;
[36971] <list> Appearance path Kāya;
[36972] <list> Those to be trained's appearance manner Kāya.
[36973] <ornament> The first:

[36975] <prose> appearance-ground great elements' nature: clear warmth,
[36976] <prose> Coolness, || 16550 ||
[36977] <prose> Spaciousness,

[36979] <ornament> The second:
[36980] <prose> For all Buddhas and sentient beings, the aspect of pervasion by light and light-mansion directly manifest.
[36981] <tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[36982] <tantra> "Abiding as light's heart-essence for all,
[36983] <tantra> Thought-free completely pure Dharmadhātu,
[36984] <break> <tantra> The single without rival,
[36985] <break> <tantra> Maṇḍala, retinue, palace,
[36986] <tantra> And awareness, emptiness, and clarity." || 16560 ||
[36987] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[36988] <ornament> The third:
[36989] <prose> The Saṃbhogakāya of appearance-ground Dharmatā, appearing to sentient beings in the bardo as path, here guiding those to be trained—self-arisen from Dharmakāya's inner Expanse,
[36990] <prose> Within the expanse of light and color,
[36991] <prose> Maṇḍala,
[36992] <prose> Retinue,
[36993] <prose> Individual assemblies,
[36994] <break> <prose> Kāya,

[36997] <prose> Mother,
[36998] <prose> Kāya-colors,
[36999] <prose> Hand-symbols, and so forth clearly manifest.
[37000] <tantra> From secret seed-cause,
[37001] <tantra> To nature-appearance,
[37002] <tantra> Nature-Kāya manifests;
[37003] <tantra> Like oneself and reflection.
[37004] <tantra> Three Kāyas: luminosity, emptiness,
[37005] <tantra> Not permanent, without entity,
[37006] <tantra> Not severed: luminosity-Kāya, || 16580 ||
[37007] <tantra> Without distinction, without outer-inner."
[37008] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37009] <ornament> The fourth:
[37010] <prose> To those to be trained by Saṃbhogakāya, individually appearing according to family and maṇḍala,
[37011] <prose> Divided through emanation, empowered by those to be trained.
[37012] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya's Dharmakāya Vairocana, great ocean,
[37013] <prose> That abiding manner: externally viewed, internally clear;
[37014] <prose> Internally viewed, externally clear;
[37015] <prose> Through thorough openness, without front or back;
[37016] <tantra> From wherever viewed, like showing face—appearance: face in ten directions, completely open. || 16590 ||
[37017] <prose> That field: completely adorned ornament-arrangement,

[37019] <prose> Field: completely pure dense array,
[37020] <prose> Retinue: not other than oneself,
[37021] <prose> Teaching: self-arisen wisdom self-appearing,
[37022] <prose> Time: realization directly manifest.
[37023] <ornament> This, regarding self-appearance primordially as emanation,
[37024] <ornament> Regarding those to be trained's luminosity, is posited as Saṃbhogakāya through perfection of marks and signs.
[37025] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya's Saṃbhogakāya: appearing as five families' principal five.

[37053] <tantra> Even to self-arisen six syllables,

[37055] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[37056] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya means: || 16630 ||
[37057] <prose> Through essence, not demonstrating Dharmas as word—thus "unspoken."
[37058] <prose> The six syllables' self-sound heard by those to be trained:
[37059] <prose> Like dream-words, appearing as spoken.
[37060] <tantra> From Six Expanses:
[37061] <tantra> "Without speaking from one's own mouth,
[37062] <tantra> In dream-like defining characteristic,
[37063] <tantra> To retinue's Bodhisattvas,

[37101] <prose> And enumerations—four.
[37102] <prose> Essence:

[37104] <prose> That essence's abiding manner:

[37106] <prose> Samādhi: abiding evenly in the state of Mind without thought. || 16680 ||
[37107] <prose> Definitive terminology:
[37108] <prose> Since emanated for whomever, whatever is to be trained, — therefore "emanation;"
[37109] <prose> That very form complete with excellent marks, — therefore "Kāya."
[37110] <prose> Divisions: common and uncommon approaches—two:
[37111] <prose> Common vehicle's renowned three:
[37112] <tantra> From Sūtrālaṃkāra:
