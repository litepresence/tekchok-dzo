[25122] <ornament> First:
[25123] <prose> Wisdom does not dawn with ordinary gaze manner; train in three bodies' gaze manners.
[25124] <tantra> From the Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra:
[25125] <verse> By dharmakāya gaze manner,
[25126] <verse> Press and extract three-realms' saṃsāra; || 4700 ||
[25127] <verse> Saṃbhogakāya does not destroy saṃsāra's ground;
[25128] <break> <verse> Nirmāṇakāya liberates into buddha-field.
[25129] <break> <tantra> Thus said, and:
[25130] <tantra> From the Letterless:
[25131] <verse> Gaze eye at sky element.
[25132] <break> <tantra> Thus said, and:
[25133] <break> <tantra> From the Secret Sound Tantra:
[25134] <verse> Lower, reverse, corner—three;
[25135] <verse> Gaze manner types three, famous.
[25136] <tantra> Thus it was said. || 4710 ||
[25137] <prose> That also: Nirmāṇakāya, lower, Buddha, looking at disciples;
[25138] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya, corner look, Buddha, looking at field-realm;
[25139] <prose> Dharmakāya, reverse, Buddha, looking at base.
[25140] <prose> Yogin with bad eye faculty:
[25141] <prose> Harmonizing with Nirmāṇakāya gaze manner, eye not dim purpose exists.
[25142] <prose> Eye possessing fault:
[25143] <prose> Harmonizing with Saṃbhogakāya, eye clear purpose exists.
[25144] <prose> Eye faculty good:
[25145] <prose> Harmonizing with Dharmakāya mode, swift vision arrives at measure purpose exists. Not moving from those, determined to realize within three-eyes. Dharmakāya: dharmatā eye existing in speech.
[25146] <prose> By that blessing, wisdom actually seeing— || 4720 ||
[25147] <prose> This same, certain.
[25148] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya: wisdom eye existing in body;
[25149] <prose> By that blessing, seeing self-clear, knowledge expands.
[25150] <prose> Nirmāṇakāya: discriminating-awareness eye existing in heart;
[25151] <prose> By that blessing, seeing separate from sound word,
[25152] <prose> Hearing, contemplation, meditation—all dharmatā's meaning dawns within.
[25153] <prose> That also: three-eyes gaze,
[25154] <prose> Dharmatā eye reversing up, removing latency down—main-point.
[25155] <prose> Equal gaze at wisdom's corner,
[25156] <prose> Equal mixing saṃsāra-nirvāṇa taste—main-point. || 4730 ||
[25157] <prose> Look with discriminating-awareness lowered,
[25158] <prose> Actually deliver wisdom vision—main-point.
[25159] <prose> What is three gaze manners' determination?
[25160] <prose> Lazy one: Saṃbhogakāya;
[25161] <prose> Diligent one: Nirmāṇakāya;
[25162] <prose> Equanimity one: Dharmakāya gaze manner—auspicious;
[25163] <prose> Therefore three determined.
[25164] <ornament> Definitive meaning: gaze at dharmatā,
[25165] <prose> Gaze pure, obscuration exhausted;
[25166] <prose> Mode: liberating from saṃsāra. || 4740 ||
[25167] <ornament> Second, field's main-point:
[25168] <prose> Outer dhātu's field: empty sky, separate from clouds.
[25169] <prose> Inner dhātu's field: gaze at eyebrow-center treasure-spot,
[25170] <prose> Dhātu-vision blue, and from that arise five self-resonances.
[25171] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[25172] <verse> Dhātu: outer and inner;
