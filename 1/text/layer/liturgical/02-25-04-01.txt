[36835] <ornament> First: Extensively explained Dharma-kāya field has essence,
[36836] <prose> Divisions, || 16410 ||
[36837] <prose> Enumerations,
[36838] <prose> Extensive explanation—four.
[36839] <prose> Dharma-kāya's essence: self-arisen wisdom, empty-clarity, free from elaboration;
[36840] <prose> Abiding manner,
[36841] <prose> Defining characteristic,
[36842] <prose> Nature,
[36843] <prose> Compassion,
[36844] <prose> Appearance manner—five.
[36845] <prose> Essence's abiding manner: unstained by any flaw, nature pure from beginning.
[36846] <prose> That essence's defining characteristic: emptiness possessing awareness-essence. || 16420 ||
[36847] <prose> That essence's nature: non-mixed with anything.
[36848] <prose> That essence's compassion: without opening, closing, or division-making.
[36849] <prose> That essence's appearance manner: non-dual.
[36850] <prose> Definitive terminology:
[36851] <prose> Maturation from labeled enumeration dharmas into kāya—thus without entity,
[36852] <prose> Defining characteristic nowhere determined,
[36853] <prose> Emptiness nowhere established—therefore called "Dharma-kāya."
[36854] <prose> Dharma means:
[36855] <prose> Buddha-ground's stainless dharmas connected with awareness;
[36856] <prose> Kāya means: || 16430 ||
[36857] <prose> Marks and signs without face or hands, merely referring to unchanging awareness-essence.
[36858] <prose> Divisions:
[36859] <prose> Dharma-kāya connected with entity-defining characteristics;
[36860] <prose> Dharma-kāya connected with abiding-all-pervading manner;
[36861] <prose> Dharma-kāya connected with divisions-appearance manner—three.
