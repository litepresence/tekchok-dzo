[1182] <ornament> First, regarding essence:
[1183] <prose> The blazing majesty of complete marks and exemplary features, primordially perfected.
[1184] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[1185] <verse> Possessing essence, marks and exemplary features,
[1186] <verse> Nature holding unique characteristics.
[1187] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1188] <ornament> Second, regarding etymology:
[1189] <prose> The term "kāya of five families" designates appearances as the kāyas of five distinct families.
[1190] <tantra> From that same source: || 1190 ||
[1191] <verse> Within the great wisdom-appearance,
[1192] <verse> The etymology of family is thus explained.
[1193] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1194] <ornament> Third, regarding appearance:
[1195] <prose> Manifesting as father-mother kāyas and pristine cognition.
[1196] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[1197] <verse> The appearance of five kāyas and wisdom:
[1198] <verse> Manifesting in the manner of father-mother pair,
[1199] <verse> The aspect held by father: the kāya of skillful means,
[1200] <verse> The aspect held by mother: the kāya of wisdom. || 1200 ||
[1201] <verse> Thus method and wisdom appear as two.
[1202] <verse> Moreover, method is without cessation,
[1203] <verse> Wisdom is without transformation.
[1204] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1205] <ornament> Fourth, regarding divisions—two aspects:
[1206] <prose> Division into five families:
[1207] <tantra> From that same source:
[1208] <verse> That appears as five families:
[1209] <verse> The family of the Tathāgatas,
[1210] <verse> The vajra family and jewel family, || 1210 ||
[1211] <verse> The lotus family and karma family—
[1212] <verse> These are considered as five families.
[1213] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1214] <ornament> Division into five kāyas:
[1215] <prose> Also from that source:
[1216] <verse> Five aspects of word-meaning regarding kāya,
[1217] <verse> Explained in this manner:
[1218] <verse> Vairocana and Vajrasattva,
[1219] <verse> Likewise Ratnasaṃbhava,
[1220] <verse> Amitābha and Amoghasiddhi. || 1220 ||
[1221] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1222] <ornament> Fifth, regarding meaning application—two aspects:
[1223] <prose> First, meaning application of five families:
[1224] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[1225] <prose> In the meaning of rigpa, explained as Tathāgata family by the Tathāgatas;
[1226] <prose> In the meaning of reasoning, explained as vajra family through absence of birth and death;
[1227] <prose> In the meaning of rigpa, explained as jewel family through the arising of multiplicity;
[1228] <prose> In the meaning of rigpa, explained as lotus family through being flawless and pure;
[1229] <prose> In the nature of rigpa, explained as karma family through completion of activities.
[1230] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 1230 ||
[1231] <ornament> Second, meaning application of kāyas:
[1232] <prose> Also from that source: because rigpa's appearance never ceases, it is Vairocana;
[1233] <prose> Because rigpa realizes self and other, it is Vajrasattva;
[1234] <prose> Because rigpa knows all at once, it is Ratnasaṃbhava;
[1235] <prose> Because one's own appearance is seen, it is Amitābha;
[1236] <prose> Because rigpa realizes the unborn, it is Amoghasiddhi.
[1237] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1238] <ornament> Second topic: detailed classification of resonance-light, two aspects:
[1239] <prose> General presentation of abiding nature,
[1240] <prose> And particular explanation of the manner of appearance. || 1240 ||
[1241] <ornament> First:
[1242] <prose> The five lights of the sovereign, primordially spontaneously accomplished in the great expanse,
[1243] <prose> The manner in which they exist within sentient beings now:
[1244] <prose> Within the heart, like a precious jeweled casket,
[1245] <prose> At the center of the clear depths within the channels of light,
[1246] <prose> The resonance of five lights, the pristine wisdom of rigpa, abides.
[1247] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[1248] <verse> That great wisdom-appearance,
[1249] <verse> Abides at the center of the heart's maṇḍala.
[1250] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 1250 ||
[1251] <ornament> Second, particular explanation of appearance manner—three aspects:
[1252] <prose> The manner of appearance to those not trained upon the path,
[1253] <prose> The manner of appearance to those trained upon the path,
[1254] <prose> The manner of appearance in the bardo.
[1255] <ornament> First:
[1256] <prose> Although light abides self-existing within oneself, for six realms of beings not recognizing their own face,
[1257] <prose> The lamp's own light exists subtly within all sentient beings.
[1258] <tantra> From that same source:
[1259] <verse> For all unrealized sentient beings,
[1260] <verse> In humans it exists as demonstrable; || 1260 ||
[1261] <verse> In gods it exists as visible;
[1262] <verse> In asuras it exists as subtle;
[1263] <verse> In animals it exists merely as their own abiding;
[1264] <verse> In pretas it exists as scattered;
[1265] <verse> In hell realms it exists as sesame seed size.
[1266] <verse> Thus six lights abide.
[1267] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1268] <ornament> That light exists as mere resonance within the heart.
[1269] <prose> As nature, the light of ripening propensities exists in gods as radiance and so forth,
[1270] <prose> Yet that is the light of virtuous contaminated ripening, || 1270 ||
[1271] <prose> Not the core's own light.
[1272] <ornament> Second, the manner of appearance to those trained upon the path—nine aspects of light:
[1273] <prose> Place,
[1274] <prose> Path,
[1275] <prose> Object,
[1276] <prose> Body,
[1277] <prose> Eye,
[1278] <prose> Essence,
[1279] <prose> Exemplary demonstration,
[1280] <prose> Time, || 1280 ||
[1281] <prose> And the place of liberation.
[1282] <prose> Place: within the heart center, the spontaneously accomplished five lights as thigle of five colors, the maṇḍala of five kāyas as father-mother clusters;
[1283] <prose> The purity of five elements,
[1284] <prose> Five aggregates,
[1285] <prose> Five kāyas,
[1286] <prose> Five families,
[1287] <prose> Five wisdoms,
[1288] <prose> And five grounds;
[1289] <prose> From the four appearances,
[1290] <prose> Seen when the measure is completed. || 1290 ||
[1291] <prose> Path: arising from radiance.
[1292] <prose> Object: empty space.
[1293] <prose> Body of light:
[1294] <prose> The upper appearance of five kāyas and four wisdoms.
[1295] <prose> Eye:
[1296] <prose> Moved to the expanse through recognizing one's own face by the self-arisen wisdom lamp.
[1297] <prose> Essence:
[1298] <prose> All-luminous, non-ceasing wisdom.
[1299] <prose> Exemplary demonstration: like crystal,
[1300] <prose> Although the five lights are not clear in the ground's own abiding, they exist as the ground of arising. || 1300 ||
[1301] <prose> Time:
[1302] <prose> When trained, can appear in this very life;
[1303] <prose> The time of the bardo's natural arising.
[1304] <prose> Place of liberation: having seized the outer light into the inner primordially pure precious secret casket,
[1305] <prose> Like gathering crystal light within, without clear luminosity, abiding as the ground of arising.
[1306] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[1307] <verse> Light, kāya, and wisdom,
[1308] <verse> Mother, element, and aggregate,
[1309] <verse> Ground, and family are explained.
[1310] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 1310 ||
[1311] <verse> All sentient beings thus,
[1312] <verse> Abide within their own bodies.
[1313] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1314] <prose> Manner of appearance regarding these appearances:
[1315] <verse> That great wisdom-appearance,
[1316] <verse> Abides at the center of the heart.
[1317] <verse> Path arises from the ocean,
[1318] <verse> Object is empty space.
[1319] <verse> Body is kāya and wisdom.
[1320] <verse> Eye is the wisdom lamp. || 1320 ||
[1321] <verse> Essence is the all-luminous mirror.
[1322] <verse> Exemplary demonstration: the stainless crystal kāya,
[1323] <verse> Time is the dharmatā bardo.
[1324] <verse> Completed in the precious casket.
[1325] <prose> Thus manner of appearance regarding these.
[1326] <prose> Seeing these appearances, this is called the manner of appearance of single-cutting purity in this bardo.
[1327] <prose> Also at that time, liberation from the bondage of the five aggregates when the measure is completed,
[1328] <prose> And the resonance appearing outward from within, the great appearance of five lights filling the upper space,
[1329] <tantra> From that same source:
[1330] <verse> Appearance of pure single-cutting, || 1330 ||
[1331] <verse> In the pure wisdom space,
[1332] <verse> Five lights unchanging luminosity,
[1333] <verse> That also in five groups,
[1334] <verse> Arising as father-mother manner.
[1335] <verse> Their colors thus:
[1336] <verse> Blue-green, Vairocana kāya,
[1337] <verse> Wisdom of dharmadhātu,
[1338] <verse> Mother is Space Sovereign,
[1339] <verse> Element is empty space.
[1340] <verse> Aggregate is form aggregate. || 1340 ||
[1341] <verse> Ground is action-completed ground.
[1342] <verse> Explained as Tathāgata family.
[1343] <verse> White, Vajrasattva kāya,
[1344] <verse> Mirror-like wisdom,
[1345] <verse> Mother is considered Mānakī,
[1346] <verse> Element is great water.
[1347] <verse> Aggregate is perception aggregate.
[1348] <verse> Ground is action-relinquished ground.
[1349] <verse> Explained as vajra family.
[1350] <verse> Yellow, Ratnasaṃbhava kāya, || 1350 ||
[1351] <verse> Wisdom of sameness,
[1352] <verse> Mother is considered Buddha-Eye,
[1353] <verse> Element is great producing ground.
[1354] <verse> Aggregate is formation aggregate.
[1355] <verse> Ground is various-arising ground.
[1356] <verse> Explained as jewel family.
[1357] <verse> Red, Amitābha kāya,
[1358] <verse> Discriminating wisdom,
[1359] <verse> Mother is great White-Clad,
[1360] <verse> Element is consuming fire. || 1360 ||
[1361] <verse> Aggregate is consciousness aggregate.
[1362] <verse> Ground is demonstrating ground.
[1363] <verse> Explained as lotus family.
[1364] <verse> Green, Amoghasiddhi kāya,
[1365] <verse> Action-accomplished wisdom,
[1366] <verse> Mother is considered Samayatārā,
[1367] <verse> Element is uplifting wind.
[1368] <verse> Aggregate is feeling aggregate.
[1369] <verse> Ground is action-finished ground.
[1370] <verse> Explained as karma family. || 1370 ||
[1371] <verse> Thus pure appearance.
[1372] <verse> All sentient beings thus,
[1373] <verse> Abide within their own bodies.
[1374] <verse> Thus also arising in the bardo.
[1375] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1376] <ornament> Third, the manner of appearance in the bardo:
[1377] <prose> In the dharmatā bardo, the appearance of five lights' wisdom arises;
[1378] <prose> For those with the final twenty-one faculties, when the dharmatā bardo sets,
[1379] <prose> Entering the existence bardo, depending upon the impure light existing in oneself,
[1380] <prose> The resonance of six families arises individually there. || 1380 ||
[1381] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[1382] <verse> Six impure delusion lights,
[1383] <verse> For those with the final, final faculties.
[1384] <verse> White arising and yellow arising,
[1385] <verse> Red arising and green,
[1386] <verse> Likewise arising as blue-green,
[1387] <verse> Considered arising as swirling,
[1388] <verse> That is impure delusion light.
[1389] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1390] <prose> Thus gathering these lights: for unrealized beings, impure delusion light; || 1390 ||
[1391] <prose> For realized ones, wisdom light—these two gathered.
[1392] <tantra> From that same source:
[1393] <verse> Divisions of light beyond thought,
[1394] <verse> Briefly taught, keep in mind.
[1395] <verse> Pure light of wisdom,
[1396] <verse> And impure delusion light.
[1397] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1398] <prose> Because light exists in the expanse, clear as kāya and wisdom;
[1399] <prose> Even now in delusion-time, all sentient beings abide in that nature, not beyond the five-colored appearance of the five elements.
[1400] <prose> Know that the Buddha's exhaustive sense-fields, radiating light-rays and measureless kāyas, also arise from that. || 1400 ||
[1401] <tantra> From that same source:
[1402] <verse> All within its expanse,
[1403] <verse> Explained and demonstrated by me.
[1404] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1405] <ornament> Third topic: detailed classification of dependent wisdom—three aspects:
[1406] <prose> Essence,
[1407] <prose> Divisions,
[1408] <prose> Explanation of definitive etymology.
[1409] <ornament> First, essence:
[1410] <prose> Uncompounded awareness from the beginning; || 1410 ||
[1411] <prose> Arising from the nature of empty dharmatā, the expanse of primordially pure rigpa,
[1412] <tantra> From the Great Self-Arisen Tantra:
[1413] <verse> Kyema, secret sovereign, definitely attend!
[1414] <verse> Non-dharmic self-arisen wisdom,
[1415] <verse> Arises from within all dharmas.
[1416] <verse> From that, wisdom arises.
[1417] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1418] <ornament> Second, divisions:
[1419] <prose> Those five wisdoms, when with stains, gathered by sentient beings' continuum, are called the wisdom of spontaneously accomplished nature;
[1420] <prose> When stains are purified, at the time of Buddhahood, called the resultant wisdom of manifest realization. || 1420 ||
[1421] <tantra> From that same source:
[1422] <verse> Explanation of great wisdom thus:
[1423] <verse> Manifest realization Buddha,
[1424] <verse> And nature spontaneously accomplished Buddha.
[1425] <verse> Primordially nature spontaneously accomplished,
[1426] <verse> Then manifest realization.
[1427] <verse> Thus wisdom etymology.
[1428] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1429] <ornament> Third, explanation of definitive etymology—two aspects:
[1430] <prose> Common detailed classification, || 1430 ||
[1431] <prose> And particular explanation of definitive etymology.
[1432] <ornament> First:
[1433] <tantra> From that same source:
[1434] <verse> Dharmadhātu wisdom without thought,
[1435] <verse> Mirror-like wisdom non-ceasing clear,
[1436] <verse> Sameness wisdom complete unmixed,
[1437] <verse> Discriminating wisdom realized as before,
[1438] <verse> Action-accomplished wisdom completes dharmas.
[1439] <verse> Thus considered as five types.
[1440] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 1440 ||
[1441] <ornament> Second:
[1442] <prose> Also from that source, application of word-meaning thus:
[1443] <verse> Dharmadhātu wisdom:
[1444] <verse> The object of great emptiness,
[1445] <verse> And appearance of clear light,
[1446] <verse> Three objects of awareness-wisdom,
[1447] <verse> Those three gathered called expanse.
[1448] <verse> Also two aspects thereof:
[1449] <verse> Pure wisdom expanse,
[1450] <verse> And impure sentient beings' expanse. || 1450 ||
[1451] <verse> Pure wisdom expanse:
[1452] <verse> Expanse of rigpa without division of empty-clear,
[1453] <verse> The palace of unchanging dharmakāya.
[1454] <verse> Impure sentient beings' outer expanse:
[1455] <verse> Empty, without rigpa, uncompounded,
[1456] <verse> From that, appearance of earth and stone.
[1457] <verse> Object of sentient beings.
[1458] <verse> That is dharmadhātu wisdom.
[1459] <verse> Mirror-like wisdom:
[1460] <verse> Like example in mirror maṇḍala, || 1460 ||
[1461] <verse> Whatever demonstrated comes by condition,
[1462] <verse> Likewise to stainless rigpa,
[1463] <verse> Afflictions become by condition power.
[1464] <verse> Rigpa liberated from that,
[1465] <verse> Know through introduction within.
[1466] <verse> Manner of liberation from signs:
[1467] <verse> Various appearances, awareness objects,
[1468] <verse> Doubts appearing to mind,
[1469] <verse> Completed in rigpa's nature.
[1470] <verse> Mind and phenomena dharmas, || 1470 ||
[1471] <verse> Completed in awareness-wisdom nature.
[1472] <verse> Also definitive etymology thus:
[1473] <verse> Fire engaging various objects,
[1474] <verse> Long reflecting, gazing there,
[1475] <verse> Mirror-like wisdom thus.
[1476] <verse> Sameness wisdom meaning application:
[1477] <verse> In the essence equal of dharmas,
[1478] <verse> Not falling into any direction.
[1479] <verse> Sameness lord of all Buddhas,
[1480] <verse> All dharmas completed at one time. || 1480 ||
[1481] <verse> Sameness definitive etymology thus:
[1482] <verse> Dharmatā without partiality thus equal,
[1483] <verse> Possessing meaning of rigpa thus,
[1484] <verse> Sameness wisdom thus.
[1485] <verse> Discriminating wisdom:
[1486] <verse> Realized as awareness free from doing,
[1487] <verse> Also many manners of realization,
[1488] <verse> Shown in words arising below.
[1489] <verse> Also definitive etymology thus:
[1490] <verse> Because twenty-one faculties, || 1490 ||
[1491] <verse> Discriminating thus called.
[1492] <verse> Discriminating wisdom thus.
[1493] <verse> Action-accomplished wisdom:
[1494] <verse> Whatever appears completed in rigpa nature,
[1495] <verse> Completed in manner without doing, without thought,
[1496] <verse> That yogin of action-relinquished,
[1497] <verse> Truly accomplished through spacious ground.
[1498] <verse> Thus great wisdom meaning,
[1499] <verse> Truly liberated through realization.
[1500] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 1500 ||
[1501] <prose> If confused by adding one by one to fire, lightning, awareness, and knowledge from tantra,
[1502] <prose> From sūtra:
[1503] <prose> "Ka is the door of all dharmas because unborn," etc., meaning applied to each word,
[1504] <prose> Also in other new tantras, thus arising from letter sound explanation,
[1505] <prose> Also that fault exists there.
[1506] <prose> If thinking there is distinction between mantra and free translation,
[1507] <prose> From sūtra and treatise:
[1508] <prose> Brief teaching, extensive explanation, meaning summary—the three also have that fault.
[1509] <prose> Great Perfection tantras are upadeśa tantras,
[1510] <prose> Spoken for easy understanding, each letter also easy to understand; || 1510 ||
[1511] <prose> Great paṇḍitas with mastery of various languages came,
[1512] <prose> They made sounds of letters difficult to understand in the expanse,
[1513] <prose> Translated clearly without confusion, and
[1514] <prose> Translators surpassing others are the kindness of favor.
[1515] <prose> Thus each of the five wisdoms individually divided becomes twenty-five; detailed classification with parts already explained before, not expanded here again.
[1516] <ornament> Fourth topic: detailed classification of activity—three aspects:
[1517] <prose> Brief presentation of the essence of four activities,
[1518] <prose> Extensive explanation of the manner of natural completion,
[1519] <prose> Summary of meaning through the manner of self-appearance arising.
[1520] <ornament> First: Essence, definitive etymology, divisions, mudrā, deity assembly, essence, maṇḍala—seven aspects. || 1520 ||
[1521] <prose> Essence of activity: spontaneously completed meaning of two,
[1522] <prose> Abiding as wisdom essence.
[1523] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[1524] <verse> Wisdom of all activity,
[1525] <verse> Does all actions.
[1526] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1527] <prose> Also from that source:
[1528] <verse> Activity called Buddha itself,
[1529] <verse> Action is wisdom experience.
[1530] <verse> Activity itself thus spoken, || 1530 ||
[1531] <verse> Arisen from me and completed in me,
[1532] <verse> In the completed ground thus.
[1533] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1534] <prose> Divisions: four.
[1535] <tantra> From that source:
[1536] <verse> Pacifying and enriching,
[1537] <verse> Likewise power and fierce.
[1538] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1539] <prose> Maṇḍala: not drawn, primordially adorned, self-complete, exists in oneself.
[1540] <prose> Mudrā: not transformed, complete enlightenment from ground, five bodies appearing. || 1540 ||
[1541] <prose> Deity assembly: not produced, primordially complete peaceful-wrathful, abide in oneself.
[1542] <prose> Mantra essence: channel-center letter wheel and that essence, four lamps, object dawns.
[1543] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[1544] <verse> Maṇḍala of all activity,
[1545] <verse> Not sought, exists in oneself.
[1546] <verse> Mudrā of all activity,
[1547] <verse> Not transformed, complete in four.
[1548] <verse> Deity assembly of all activity,
[1549] <verse> Complete in one's own body.
[1550] <verse> Essence of all activity, || 1550 ||
[1551] <verse> Called great lamp wisdom.
[1552] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1553] <ornament> Second: Extensive explanation of progressive manner of natural completion—two aspects:
[1554] <prose> Manner of completion in original ground,
[1555] <prose> And manner of completion in beings' time.
[1556] <ornament> First, two aspects:
[1557] <prose> General presentation:
[1558] <prose> In original primordially pure ground, inner wisdom's five lights clear in expanse depth as blue-green, all expanse,
[1559] <prose> Because four lights of activity abide as arising basis, countless,
[1560] <prose> White, yellow, red, green four blaze as activity. || 1560 ||
[1561] <tantra> From that source:
[1562] <verse> Meaning of four activities,
[1563] <verse> Completed in blue-green itself.
[1564] <verse> Four activities complete in ground,
[1565] <verse> Therefore color blue-green explained.
[1566] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1567] <verse> Meaning of four kinds of activity,
[1568] <verse> Complete in the ground.
[1569] <verse> Also thus taught:
[1570] <verse> White red various lights, || 1570 ||
[1571] <verse> Complete descended in ground.
[1572] <verse> White peaceful maṇḍala possessing,
[1573] <verse> Yellow light of enriching,
[1574] <verse> Red considered power light,
[1575] <verse> Green spoken as fierce light,
[1576] <verse> Blue-green light of completed activity.
[1577] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[1578] <ornament> Second, particular explanation—four aspects:
[1579] <prose> Pacifying, enriching, magnetizing, and fierce—
[1580] <verse> The meaning of four activities, || 1580 ||
[1581] <verse> Completed in the blue-green itself.
