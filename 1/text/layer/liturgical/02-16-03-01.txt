[21608] <ornament> First, regarding essence:
[21609] <prose> The blazing majesty of complete marks and exemplary features, primordially perfected.
[21610] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[21611] <verse> Possessing essence, marks and exemplary features,
[21612] <verse> Nature holding unique characteristics.
[21613] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21614] <ornament> Second, regarding etymology:
[21615] <prose> The term "kāya of five families" designates appearances as the kāyas of five distinct families.
[21616] <tantra> From that same source: || 1190 ||
[21617] <verse> Within the great wisdom-appearance,
[21618] <verse> The etymology of family is thus explained.
[21619] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21620] <ornament> Third, regarding appearance:
[21621] <prose> Manifesting as father-mother kāyas and pristine cognition.
[21622] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[21623] <verse> The appearance of five kāyas and wisdom:
[21624] <verse> Manifesting in the manner of father-mother pair,
[21625] <verse> The aspect held by father: the kāya of skillful means,
[21626] <verse> The aspect held by mother: the kāya of wisdom. || 1200 ||
[21627] <verse> Thus method and wisdom appear as two.
[21628] <verse> Moreover, method is without cessation,
[21629] <verse> Wisdom is without transformation.
[21630] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21631] <ornament> Fourth, regarding divisions—two aspects:
[21632] <prose> Division into five families:
[21633] <tantra> From that same source:
[21634] <verse> That appears as five families:
[21635] <verse> The family of the Tathāgatas,
[21636] <verse> The vajra family and jewel family, || 1210 ||
[21637] <verse> The lotus family and karma family—
[21638] <verse> These are considered as five families.
[21639] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21640] <ornament> Division into five kāyas:
[21641] <prose> Also from that source:
[21642] <verse> Five aspects of word-meaning regarding kāya,
[21643] <verse> Explained in this manner:
[21644] <verse> Vairocana and Vajrasattva,
[21645] <verse> Likewise Ratnasaṃbhava,
[21646] <verse> Amitābha and Amoghasiddhi. || 1220 ||
[21647] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21648] <ornament> Fifth, regarding meaning application—two aspects:
[21649] <prose> First, meaning application of five families:
[21650] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[21651] <prose> In the meaning of rigpa, explained as Tathāgata family by the Tathāgatas;
[21652] <prose> In the meaning of reasoning, explained as vajra family through absence of birth and death;
[21653] <prose> In the meaning of rigpa, explained as jewel family through the arising of multiplicity;
[21654] <prose> In the meaning of rigpa, explained as lotus family through being flawless and pure;
[21655] <prose> In the nature of rigpa, explained as karma family through completion of activities.
[21656] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 1230 ||
[21657] <ornament> Second, meaning application of kāyas:
[21658] <prose> Also from that source: because rigpa's appearance never ceases, it is Vairocana;
[21659] <prose> Because rigpa realizes self and other, it is Vajrasattva;
[21660] <prose> Because rigpa knows all at once, it is Ratnasaṃbhava;
[21661] <prose> Because one's own appearance is seen, it is Amitābha;
[21662] <prose> Because rigpa realizes the unborn, it is Amoghasiddhi.
[21663] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21664] <ornament> Second topic: detailed classification of resonance-light, two aspects:
[21665] <prose> General presentation of abiding nature,
[21666] <prose> And particular explanation of the manner of appearance. || 1240 ||
[21667] <ornament> First:
[21668] <prose> The five lights of the sovereign, primordially spontaneously accomplished in the great expanse,
[21669] <prose> The manner in which they exist within sentient beings now:
[21670] <prose> Within the heart, like a precious jeweled casket,
[21671] <prose> At the center of the clear depths within the channels of light,
[21672] <prose> The resonance of five lights, the pristine wisdom of rigpa, abides.
[21673] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[21674] <verse> That great wisdom-appearance,
[21675] <verse> Abides at the center of the heart's maṇḍala.
[21676] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 1250 ||
[21677] <ornament> Second, particular explanation of appearance manner—three aspects:
[21678] <prose> The manner of appearance to those not trained upon the path,
[21679] <prose> The manner of appearance to those trained upon the path,
[21680] <prose> The manner of appearance in the bardo.
[21681] <ornament> First:
[21682] <prose> Although light abides self-existing within oneself, for six realms of beings not recognizing their own face,
[21683] <prose> The lamp's own light exists subtly within all sentient beings.
[21684] <tantra> From that same source:
[21685] <verse> For all unrealized sentient beings,
[21686] <verse> In humans it exists as demonstrable; || 1260 ||
[21687] <verse> In gods it exists as visible;
[21688] <verse> In asuras it exists as subtle;
[21689] <verse> In animals it exists merely as their own abiding;
[21690] <verse> In pretas it exists as scattered;
[21691] <verse> In hell realms it exists as sesame seed size.
[21692] <verse> Thus six lights abide.
[21693] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21694] <ornament> That light exists as mere resonance within the heart.
[21695] <prose> As nature, the light of ripening propensities exists in gods as radiance and so forth,
[21696] <prose> Yet that is the light of virtuous contaminated ripening, || 1270 ||
[21697] <prose> Not the core's own light.
[21698] <ornament> Second, the manner of appearance to those trained upon the path—nine aspects of light:
[21699] <prose> Place,
[21700] <prose> Path,
[21701] <prose> Object,
[21702] <prose> Body,
[21703] <prose> Eye,
[21704] <prose> Essence,
[21705] <prose> Exemplary demonstration,
[21706] <prose> Time, || 1280 ||
[21707] <prose> And the place of liberation.
[21708] <prose> Place: within the heart center, the spontaneously accomplished five lights as thigle of five colors, the maṇḍala of five kāyas as father-mother clusters;
[21709] <prose> The purity of five elements,
[21710] <prose> Five aggregates,
[21711] <prose> Five kāyas,
[21712] <prose> Five families,
[21713] <prose> Five wisdoms,
[21714] <prose> And five grounds;
[21715] <prose> From the four appearances,
[21716] <prose> Seen when the measure is completed. || 1290 ||
[21717] <prose> Path: arising from radiance.
[21718] <prose> Object: empty space.
[21719] <prose> Body of light:
[21720] <prose> The upper appearance of five kāyas and four wisdoms.
[21721] <prose> Eye:
[21722] <prose> Moved to the expanse through recognizing one's own face by the self-arisen wisdom lamp.
[21723] <prose> Essence:
[21724] <prose> All-luminous, non-ceasing wisdom.
[21725] <prose> Exemplary demonstration: like crystal,
[21726] <prose> Although the five lights are not clear in the ground's own abiding, they exist as the ground of arising. || 1300 ||
[21727] <prose> Time:
[21728] <prose> When trained, can appear in this very life;
[21729] <prose> The time of the bardo's natural arising.
[21730] <prose> Place of liberation: having seized the outer light into the inner primordially pure precious secret casket,
[21731] <prose> Like gathering crystal light within, without clear luminosity, abiding as the ground of arising.
[21732] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[21733] <verse> Light, kāya, and wisdom,
[21734] <verse> Mother, element, and aggregate,
[21735] <verse> Ground, and family are explained.
[21736] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 1310 ||
[21737] <verse> All sentient beings thus,
[21738] <verse> Abide within their own bodies.
[21739] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21740] <prose> Manner of appearance regarding these appearances:
[21741] <verse> That great wisdom-appearance,
[21742] <verse> Abides at the center of the heart.
[21743] <verse> Path arises from the ocean,
[21744] <verse> Object is empty space.
[21745] <verse> Body is kāya and wisdom.
[21746] <verse> Eye is the wisdom lamp. || 1320 ||
[21747] <verse> Essence is the all-luminous mirror.
[21748] <verse> Exemplary demonstration: the stainless crystal kāya,
[21749] <verse> Time is the dharmatā bardo.
[21750] <verse> Completed in the precious casket.
[21751] <prose> Thus manner of appearance regarding these.
[21752] <prose> Seeing these appearances, this is called the manner of appearance of single-cutting purity in this bardo.
[21753] <prose> Also at that time, liberation from the bondage of the five aggregates when the measure is completed,
[21754] <prose> And the resonance appearing outward from within, the great appearance of five lights filling the upper space,
[21755] <tantra> From that same source:
[21756] <verse> Appearance of pure single-cutting, || 1330 ||
[21757] <verse> In the pure wisdom space,
[21758] <verse> Five lights unchanging luminosity,
[21759] <verse> That also in five groups,
[21760] <verse> Arising as father-mother manner.
[21761] <verse> Their colors thus:
[21762] <verse> Blue-green, Vairocana kāya,
[21763] <verse> Wisdom of dharmadhātu,
[21764] <verse> Mother is Space Sovereign,
[21765] <verse> Element is empty space.
[21766] <verse> Aggregate is form aggregate. || 1340 ||
[21767] <verse> Ground is action-completed ground.
[21768] <verse> Explained as Tathāgata family.
[21769] <verse> White, Vajrasattva kāya,
[21770] <verse> Mirror-like wisdom,
[21771] <verse> Mother is considered Mānakī,
[21772] <verse> Element is great water.
[21773] <verse> Aggregate is perception aggregate.
[21774] <verse> Ground is action-relinquished ground.
[21775] <verse> Explained as vajra family.
[21776] <verse> Yellow, Ratnasaṃbhava kāya, || 1350 ||
[21777] <verse> Wisdom of sameness,
[21778] <verse> Mother is considered Buddha-Eye,
[21779] <verse> Element is great producing ground.
[21780] <verse> Aggregate is formation aggregate.
[21781] <verse> Ground is various-arising ground.
[21782] <verse> Explained as jewel family.
[21783] <verse> Red, Amitābha kāya,
[21784] <verse> Discriminating wisdom,
[21785] <verse> Mother is great White-Clad,
[21786] <verse> Element is consuming fire. || 1360 ||
[21787] <verse> Aggregate is consciousness aggregate.
[21788] <verse> Ground is demonstrating ground.
[21789] <verse> Explained as lotus family.
[21790] <verse> Green, Amoghasiddhi kāya,
[21791] <verse> Action-accomplished wisdom,
[21792] <verse> Mother is considered Samayatārā,
[21793] <verse> Element is uplifting wind.
[21794] <verse> Aggregate is feeling aggregate.
[21795] <verse> Ground is action-finished ground.
[21796] <verse> Explained as karma family. || 1370 ||
[21797] <verse> Thus pure appearance.
[21798] <verse> All sentient beings thus,
[21799] <verse> Abide within their own bodies.
[21800] <verse> Thus also arising in the bardo.
[21801] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21802] <ornament> Third, the manner of appearance in the bardo:
[21803] <prose> In the dharmatā bardo, the appearance of five lights' wisdom arises;
[21804] <prose> For those with the final twenty-one faculties, when the dharmatā bardo sets,
[21805] <prose> Entering the existence bardo, depending upon the impure light existing in oneself,
[21806] <prose> The resonance of six families arises individually there. || 1380 ||
[21807] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[21808] <verse> Six impure delusion lights,
[21809] <verse> For those with the final, final faculties.
[21810] <verse> White arising and yellow arising,
[21811] <verse> Red arising and green,
[21812] <verse> Likewise arising as blue-green,
[21813] <verse> Considered arising as swirling,
[21814] <verse> That is impure delusion light.
[21815] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21816] <prose> Thus gathering these lights: for unrealized beings, impure delusion light; || 1390 ||
[21817] <prose> For realized ones, wisdom light—these two gathered.
[21818] <tantra> From that same source:
[21819] <verse> Divisions of light beyond thought,
[21820] <verse> Briefly taught, keep in mind.
[21821] <verse> Pure light of wisdom,
[21822] <verse> And impure delusion light.
[21823] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21824] <prose> Because light exists in the expanse, clear as kāya and wisdom;
[21825] <prose> Even now in delusion-time, all sentient beings abide in that nature, not beyond the five-colored appearance of the five elements.
[21826] <prose> Know that the Buddha's exhaustive sense-fields, radiating light-rays and measureless kāyas, also arise from that. || 1400 ||
[21827] <tantra> From that same source:
[21828] <verse> All within its expanse,
[21829] <verse> Explained and demonstrated by me.
[21830] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21831] <ornament> Third topic: detailed classification of dependent wisdom—three aspects:
[21832] <prose> Essence,
[21833] <prose> Divisions,
[21834] <prose> Explanation of definitive etymology.
[21835] <ornament> First, essence:
[21836] <prose> Uncompounded awareness from the beginning; || 1410 ||
[21837] <prose> Arising from the nature of empty dharmatā, the expanse of primordially pure rigpa,
[21838] <tantra> From the Great Self-Arisen Tantra:
[21839] <verse> Kyema, secret sovereign, definitely attend!
[21840] <verse> Non-dharmic self-arisen wisdom,
[21841] <verse> Arises from within all dharmas.
[21842] <verse> From that, wisdom arises.
[21843] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21844] <ornament> Second, divisions:
[21845] <prose> Those five wisdoms, when with stains, gathered by sentient beings' continuum, are called the wisdom of spontaneously accomplished nature;
[21846] <prose> When stains are purified, at the time of Buddhahood, called the resultant wisdom of manifest realization. || 1420 ||
[21847] <tantra> From that same source:
[21848] <verse> Explanation of great wisdom thus:
[21849] <verse> Manifest realization Buddha,
[21850] <verse> And nature spontaneously accomplished Buddha.
[21851] <verse> Primordially nature spontaneously accomplished,
[21852] <verse> Then manifest realization.
[21853] <verse> Thus wisdom etymology.
[21854] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21855] <ornament> Third, explanation of definitive etymology—two aspects:
[21856] <prose> Common detailed classification, || 1430 ||
[21857] <prose> And particular explanation of definitive etymology.
[21858] <ornament> First:
[21859] <tantra> From that same source:
[21860] <verse> Dharmadhātu wisdom without thought,
[21861] <verse> Mirror-like wisdom non-ceasing clear,
[21862] <verse> Sameness wisdom complete unmixed,
[21863] <verse> Discriminating wisdom realized as before,
[21864] <verse> Action-accomplished wisdom completes dharmas.
[21865] <verse> Thus considered as five types.
[21866] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 1440 ||
[21867] <ornament> Second:
[21868] <prose> Also from that source, application of word-meaning thus:
[21869] <verse> Dharmadhātu wisdom:
[21870] <verse> The object of great emptiness,
[21871] <verse> And appearance of clear light,
[21872] <verse> Three objects of awareness-wisdom,
[21873] <verse> Those three gathered called expanse.
[21874] <verse> Also two aspects thereof:
[21875] <verse> Pure wisdom expanse,
[21876] <verse> And impure sentient beings' expanse. || 1450 ||
[21877] <verse> Pure wisdom expanse:
[21878] <verse> Expanse of rigpa without division of empty-clear,
[21879] <verse> The palace of unchanging dharmakāya.
[21880] <verse> Impure sentient beings' outer expanse:
[21881] <verse> Empty, without rigpa, uncompounded,
[21882] <verse> From that, appearance of earth and stone.
[21883] <verse> Object of sentient beings.
[21884] <verse> That is dharmadhātu wisdom.
[21885] <verse> Mirror-like wisdom:
[21886] <verse> Like example in mirror maṇḍala, || 1460 ||
[21887] <verse> Whatever demonstrated comes by condition,
[21888] <verse> Likewise to stainless rigpa,
[21889] <verse> Afflictions become by condition power.
[21890] <verse> Rigpa liberated from that,
[21891] <verse> Know through introduction within.
[21892] <verse> Manner of liberation from signs:
[21893] <verse> Various appearances, awareness objects,
[21894] <verse> Doubts appearing to mind,
[21895] <verse> Completed in rigpa's nature.
[21896] <verse> Mind and phenomena dharmas, || 1470 ||
[21897] <verse> Completed in awareness-wisdom nature.
[21898] <verse> Also definitive etymology thus:
[21899] <verse> Fire engaging various objects,
[21900] <verse> Long reflecting, gazing there,
[21901] <verse> Mirror-like wisdom thus.
[21902] <verse> Sameness wisdom meaning application:
[21903] <verse> In the essence equal of dharmas,
[21904] <verse> Not falling into any direction.
[21905] <verse> Sameness lord of all Buddhas,
[21906] <verse> All dharmas completed at one time. || 1480 ||
[21907] <verse> Sameness definitive etymology thus:
[21908] <verse> Dharmatā without partiality thus equal,
[21909] <verse> Possessing meaning of rigpa thus,
[21910] <verse> Sameness wisdom thus.
[21911] <verse> Discriminating wisdom:
[21912] <verse> Realized as awareness free from doing,
[21913] <verse> Also many manners of realization,
[21914] <verse> Shown in words arising below.
[21915] <verse> Also definitive etymology thus:
[21916] <verse> Because twenty-one faculties, || 1490 ||
[21917] <verse> Discriminating thus called.
[21918] <verse> Discriminating wisdom thus.
[21919] <verse> Action-accomplished wisdom:
[21920] <verse> Whatever appears completed in rigpa nature,
[21921] <verse> Completed in manner without doing, without thought,
[21922] <verse> That yogin of action-relinquished,
[21923] <verse> Truly accomplished through spacious ground.
[21924] <verse> Thus great wisdom meaning,
[21925] <verse> Truly liberated through realization.
[21926] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 1500 ||
[21927] <prose> If confused by adding one by one to fire, lightning, awareness, and knowledge from tantra,
[21928] <prose> From sūtra:
[21929] <prose> "Ka is the door of all dharmas because unborn," etc., meaning applied to each word,
[21930] <prose> Also in other new tantras, thus arising from letter sound explanation,
[21931] <prose> Also that fault exists there.
[21932] <prose> If thinking there is distinction between mantra and free translation,
[21933] <prose> From sūtra and treatise:
[21934] <prose> Brief teaching, extensive explanation, meaning summary—the three also have that fault.
[21935] <prose> Great Perfection tantras are upadeśa tantras,
[21936] <prose> Spoken for easy understanding, each letter also easy to understand; || 1510 ||
[21937] <prose> Great paṇḍitas with mastery of various languages came,
[21938] <prose> They made sounds of letters difficult to understand in the expanse,
[21939] <prose> Translated clearly without confusion, and
[21940] <prose> Translators surpassing others are the kindness of favor.
[21941] <prose> Thus each of the five wisdoms individually divided becomes twenty-five; detailed classification with parts already explained before, not expanded here again.
[21942] <ornament> Fourth topic: detailed classification of activity—three aspects:
[21943] <prose> Brief presentation of the essence of four activities,
[21944] <prose> Extensive explanation of the manner of natural completion,
[21945] <prose> Summary of meaning through the manner of self-appearance arising.
[21946] <ornament> First: Essence, definitive etymology, divisions, mudrā, deity assembly, essence, maṇḍala—seven aspects. || 1520 ||
[21947] <prose> Essence of activity: spontaneously completed meaning of two,
[21948] <prose> Abiding as wisdom essence.
[21949] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[21950] <verse> Wisdom of all activity,
[21951] <verse> Does all actions.
[21952] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21953] <prose> Also from that source:
[21954] <verse> Activity called Buddha itself,
[21955] <verse> Action is wisdom experience.
[21956] <verse> Activity itself thus spoken, || 1530 ||
[21957] <verse> Arisen from me and completed in me,
[21958] <verse> In the completed ground thus.
[21959] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21960] <prose> Divisions: four.
[21961] <tantra> From that source:
[21962] <verse> Pacifying and enriching,
[21963] <verse> Likewise power and fierce.
[21964] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21965] <prose> Maṇḍala: not drawn, primordially adorned, self-complete, exists in oneself.
[21966] <prose> Mudrā: not transformed, complete enlightenment from ground, five bodies appearing. || 1540 ||
[21967] <prose> Deity assembly: not produced, primordially complete peaceful-wrathful, abide in oneself.
[21968] <prose> Mantra essence: channel-center letter wheel and that essence, four lamps, object dawns.
[21969] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[21970] <verse> Maṇḍala of all activity,
[21971] <verse> Not sought, exists in oneself.
[21972] <verse> Mudrā of all activity,
[21973] <verse> Not transformed, complete in four.
[21974] <verse> Deity assembly of all activity,
[21975] <verse> Complete in one's own body.
[21976] <verse> Essence of all activity, || 1550 ||
[21977] <verse> Called great lamp wisdom.
[21978] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[21979] <ornament> Second: Extensive explanation of progressive manner of natural completion—two aspects:
[21980] <prose> Manner of completion in original ground,
[21981] <prose> And manner of completion in beings' time.
[21982] <ornament> First, two aspects:
[21983] <prose> General presentation:
[21984] <prose> In original primordially pure ground, inner wisdom's five lights clear in expanse depth as blue-green, all expanse,
[21985] <prose> Because four lights of activity abide as arising basis, countless,
[21986] <prose> White, yellow, red, green four blaze as activity. || 1560 ||
