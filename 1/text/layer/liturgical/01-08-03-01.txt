[10699] <prose> First, if one asserts like this: permanent and impermanent existents are established together,
[10700] <prose> Because impermanent things appear and dwell merely as appearances. || 10700 ||
[10701] <prose> If one says impermanent things are established while permanent existents are not established,
[10702] <prose> Then the ability to accept anything whatsoever is damaged.
[10703] <prose> Likewise, it follows that saṃsāra is liberated without recognition,
[10704] <prose> And that those who are liberated would revert to non-recognition.
[10705] <prose> Because one accepts anything whatsoever without recognizing one's own face.
[10706] <prose> Second, if one asserts like this: even rabbit horns and the son of a barren woman could create saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—one perceives faults that are limitless and endless.
[10707] <tantra> From that,
[10708] <prose> Those who possess such assertions
[10709] <prose> The Teacher himself spoke of before:
[10710] <tantra> "All these are merely projections of not recognizing one's own face, || 10710 ||
[10711] <tantra> Because all are established as existing entities through delusion.
[10712] <tantra> Since faults of non-recognition are endless,
[10713] <tantra> Are not these knowable dharmas?
[10714] <tantra> What the Teacher spoke previously is the same."
[10715] <prose> Thus it is.
[10716] <prose> The sixth position is also expressed:
[10717] <prose> Because the essence arises everywhere, one holds that variegated appearances of multiplicity arise through not recognizing own face.
[10718] <prose> Second, the refutation of that:
[10719] <prose> Does one hold that multiplicity is outer appearance due to non-recognition,
[10720] <prose> Or does one hold it is inner consciousness failing to recognize itself, || 10720 ||
[10721] <prose> Or does one hold it is the gathering of those two through delusion?
