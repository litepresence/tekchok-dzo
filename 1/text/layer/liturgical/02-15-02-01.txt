[20900] <tantra> From each of the five winds also abiding as five:
[20901] <prose> First, the five life-holding winds from the Self-Arisen:
[20902] <prose> In life-holding wind also five:
[20903] <prose> Root-holding life and
[20904] <prose> Protecting life and
[20905] <prose> Spreading life and
[20906] <prose> Impure life and || 480 ||
[20907] <prose> Shattering life—five. Thus.
[20908] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[20909] <prose> Awareness-potential producing and
[20910] <prose> Bindhu-potential producing and
[20911] <prose> Light-potential producing and
[20912] <prose> Non-awareness root holding and
[20913] <prose> Existing in life-channel in mind-helper making manner.
[20914] <prose> Life-wind potential relies upon and abides in awareness-potential.
[20915] <prose> Second, the five fire-equal winds:
[20916] <prose> Again from that: || 490 ||
[20917] <prose> In fire-abiding wind also five:
[20918] <prose> Clear-impure separating wind and
[20919] <prose> Warmth-producing wind and
[20920] <prose> Clear-change wind and
[20921] <prose> Distinctions-gathering wind and
[20922] <prose> Praise-making wind—five. Thus.
[20923] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[20924] <prose> Nondual with awareness,
[20925] <prose> Nondual with lamp,
[20926] <prose> Nondual with bindhu, || 500 ||
[20927] <prose> Abide nondual with wisdom.
[20928] <prose> Third, the five color-radiance producing winds—also from That Source:
[20929] <prose> In color-radiance producing wind also five: consciousness-producing wind and
[20930] <prose> Mind-arising wind and
[20931] <prose> Radiance-possessing wind and
[20932] <prose> Burning wind and
[20933] <prose> Wildness wind—five. Thus.
[20934] <prose> Those also according to sequence: wisdom-object,
[20935] <prose> Appearing-object,
[20936] <prose> Lamp-object, || 510 ||
[20937] <prose> Non-awareness object,
[20938] <prose> Mind-object horse making.
[20939] <prose> Fourth, the five all-pervading winds:
[20940] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[20941] <prose> In all-pervading wind also five:
[20942] <prose> Base-pervading and
[20943] <prose> Immediate-pervading and
[20944] <prose> Hatred-fear pervading and
[20945] <prose> Memory-pervading and
[20946] <prose> All body-pervading by holding—five. Thus. || 520 ||
[20947] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[20948] <prose> Wisdom-appearing,
[20949] <prose> Lamp-appearing,
[20950] <prose> Knowing-appearing,
[20951] <prose> Thinking-appearing,
[20952] <prose> Mind-appearing potency making.
[20953] <prose> Fifth, the five compassionless karma winds:
[20954] <prose> Again from That Source:
[20955] <prose> In compassionless aeon-karma wind also five:
[20956] <prose> Movement-making wind and || 530 ||
[20957] <prose> Liberation-making wind and
[20958] <prose> Reversal-making wind and
[20959] <prose> Swiftness-making wind and
[20960] <prose> Moments wind—five. Thus.
[20961] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[20962] <prose> Aggregates-pervading,
[20963] <prose> Moments-pervading,
[20964] <prose> Bardo-pervading,
[20965] <prose> Concepts-pervading,
[20966] <prose> Three-pervading—moments, actions, completion. || 540 ||
[20967] <prose> Thus, twenty-five also gather into five roots.
[20968] <prose> These terms' explanation:
[20969] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[20970] <prose> Because of true-ground movement-making,
[20971] <prose> Move-making wind it is called.
[20972] <prose> Because of pure wisdom's life-holding,
[20973] <prose> Life-holding wind it is called.
[20974] <prose> Because of five wisdom-lights' self-nature existing,
[20975] <prose> Color-radiance producing wind it is called.
[20976] <prose> Because of wisdom's true expanse liberation ability, || 550 ||
[20977] <break> <prose> Compassionless aeon-karma wind it is called.
[20978] <break> <prose> Because of wisdom-appearing's non-gathering non-separating abiding,
[20979] <prose> Fire-equal wind it is called. Thus.
[20980] <prose> Thus, in the five essence winds, relying on awareness-wisdom, now abiding in heart,
[20981] <prose> That is wisdom's self-sound-potential clearing as five lights' essential point.
[20982] <prose> When awareness separates from wind, wisdom-expanse gathering,
[20983] <prose> Outer-inner's non-manifest also arrives at pure wind-mind's essential point.
[20984] <prose> The two-knowing:
[20985] <prose> Depending on dharmatā's inner-clear essence, all-knowing;
[20986] <prose> Depending on dharmapossessor's outer-clear aspect, all-aspect-knowing appearing as wisdom. || 560 ||
[20987] <prose> Five winds: from root life-wind's portion, compassion, awareness-wisdom—if pure, Buddha-wisdom;
[20988] <prose> If impure, become beings' realization-aggregate arising-base.
[20989] <prose> Four branch winds emanating from that, from compassion-potency, like sun's rays:
[20990] <prose> Upward-going wisdom-horse and
[20991] <prose> Downward-clearing wisdom-ray, potential-light, and
[20992] <prose> Fire-equal ripening-possessing power, and
[20993] <prose> Completing-pervasion possessing power—four.
[20994] <prose> Although these also exist only in life-wind's portion,
[20995] <prose> In expanse, not emanated;
[20996] <prose> Abiding only as emanation's non-ceasing base's essence. || 570 ||
[20997] <prose> Essence-branch clear as light.
[20998] <prose> Thus stated, also from the Kun gsal:
[20999] <prose> That kaya's abiding manner:
[21000] <prose> Like empty-luminous bubble's form-reflection.
[21001] <prose> That speech's abiding nature:
[21002] <prose> Like fire-sparks' rays, four branch winds
[21003] <prose> Clear in awareness-expanse.
[21004] <prose> That mind's clear nature:
[21005] <prose> Life-wind's self-essence,
[21006] <prose> Like wisdom fire-sparks without falling-direction, || 580 ||
[21007] <prose> Abide as essence-of-essence's five wisdoms.
[21008] <prose> Thus.
[21009] <prose> That also is wisdom not deceived by any concept.
[21010] <prose> Altering and transforming—
[21011] <prose> Not able to be grasped by face or designated by mark,
[21012] <prose> Like earth and sky,
[21013] <prose> Clear and subtle, like sparks of fire behind the five lights,
[21014] <prose> The expanse's heart essence, Dharmakāya,
[21015] <prose> Abiding as awareness itself, holding all's ground.
[21016] <prose> Its abiding palace is || 590 ||
[21017] <tantra> From that very source:
[21018] <prose> Dharmadhatu, empty and all-pervading like space—
[21019] <prose> Thus it is said.
[21020] <prose> When that Dharmakāya abides within the precious interior,
[21021] <prose> It is called dharmatā's pure original tone,
[21022] <prose> The house possessing awareness-light,
[21023] <prose> Abiding in light's display.
[21024] <prose> This is called the primordial common ground, awareness-expanse,
[21025] <prose> The meaning of establishing connection with the five winds.
[21026] <prose> Second, the five fires' extensive explanation, from Self-Arisen: || 600 ||
[21027] <prose> There are five fires:
[21028] <prose> Outer-inner all-pervading fire,
[21029] <prose> Outer-inner all-illuminating fire,
[21030] <prose> Outer-inner all-equalizing fire,
[21031] <prose> Outer-inner action's concept fire,
[21032] <prose> Outer-inner action's accomplishing fire—thus five.
[21033] <prose> These also, in sequence,
[21034] <prose> Reside in lungs,
[21035] <prose> Eyes and five limbs, making six,
[21036] <prose> Flesh gaps, || 610 ||
[21037] <prose> Two soles of feet,
[21038] <prose> And two palms of hands, producing warmth.
[21039] <prose> Third, the five earths as well:
[21040] <tantra> From that same source:
[21041] <prose> There are five earths:
[21042] <prose> All-illuminating earth,
[21043] <prose> Unchanging vajra earth,
[21044] <prose> Precious earth from which all arise,
[21045] <prose> All-pervading earth showing appearances,
[21046] <prose> Perfected accomplishment earth—thus five. || 620 ||
[21047] <prose> These also, in sequence,
[21048] <break> <prose> Together with awareness,
[21049] <prose> Together with lamp,
[21050] <prose> Together with thigle,
[21051] <prose> Together with wisdom,
[21052] <break> <prose> Together with discriminating awareness, they abide in reliance.
[21053] <prose> Fourth, the five waters also from Self-Arisen:
[21054] <prose> The five water kinds are:
[21055] <prose> Unchanging water,
[21056] <prose> Peaceful, clear, pure water, || 630 ||
[21057] <prose> Extensively arising qualities' water,
[21058] <prose> Attachment-free water,
[21059] <prose> Completion-without-grasping water—thus five.
[21060] <prose> These also, according to sequence,
[21061] <prose> Together with all channels—
[21062] <prose> Together with all bones,
[21063] <prose> Together with all blood,
[21064] <prose> Together with all lymph,
[21065] <prose> Abiding within two eyes, moistening without essence-holding.
[21066] <prose> Fifth, the five spaces: || 640 ||
[21067] <prose> Again, from Self-Arisen it is taught:
[21068] <prose> The five spaces are:
[21069] <prose> All-common-pervading space,
[21070] <prose> Object-free clear-tone space,
[21071] <prose> Pure unmixed space,
[21072] <prose> Meaning-indicating space,
[21073] <prose> Pure-field liberating space—thus.
[21074] <prose> These also, in sequence,
[21075] <prose> Together with actual awareness,
[21076] <prose> Together with five lights, || 650 ||
[21077] <prose> Together with pure-expanse lamp,
[21078] <prose> Together with signs' wisdom,
[21079] <prose> Together with twenty-one pointing-out instructions, example-meaning certain confidence.
[21080] <prose> Thus, five elements' awareness summarized attributes are the great elements,
[21081] <prose> While their ground is the small elements.
[21082] <tantra> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[21083] <prose> The fifteenth division: Showing the Elements' Place.
[21084] <prose> Thus, having established elements' nature as basis,
[21085] <prose> Now, the supported's fourfold purity: expanse and wisdom:
[21086] <prose> Basis: kayas, || 660 ||
[21087] <prose> Tone: light,
[21088] <prose> Supported: wisdom,
[21089] <prose> Activities: enlightened actions.
[21090] <prose> First, basis-kayas' extensive division has two parts:
[21091] <prose> Three kayas' expanse general presentation, and
[21092] <prose> Five kayas' enumeration particular explanation.
[21093] <prose> The first has: kayas' definition brief presentation, and
[21094] <prose> Place extensive explanation.
