[4468] <ornament> First, the Nirmāṇakāya posture:
[4469] <prose> Like a seer hunched in meditation—
[4470] <prose> Two ankles pressed together: the crucial point producing the union of method and wisdom; || 4470 ||
[4471] <prose> Two soles touching the earth: the crucial point suppressing the action winds of grasping;
[4472] <prose> Knees pressed: the crucial point dropping the body's elements into the central channel;
[4473] <prose> Body held straight: the crucial point keeping channels uncompressed, wind naturally slow;
[4474] <prose> Hands crossed: the crucial point mixing expanse and awareness;
[4475] <prose> Neck held straight: the crucial point projecting wind to its object, self-purifying.
[4476] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[4477] <verse> Emanation-kāya's posture:
[4478] <verse> Relying upon the seer's hunch,
[4479] <verse> Dharmatā appearances self-emanate,
[4480] <verse> The Dharma eye beholds— || 4480 ||
[4481] <tantra> Thus.
[4482] <ornament> Definitive terminology:
[4483] <prose> "Emanation" signifies the body's arising and various actions emanated and purified;
[4484] <prose> That purification ripens into the illusory kāya;
[4485] <prose> Posture relies upon the ground of the tantra;
[4486] <prose> Relying upon that posture, not returning to the three realms—
[4487] <tantra> From Golden Garuda:
[4488] <verse> Purifying the body's aggregates,
[4489] <verse> Emanation-kāya's posture;
[4490] <verse> Whoever knows this crucial point, || 4490 ||
[4491] <verse> Liberates from that, becoming Buddha.
[4492] <tantra> Thus.
[4493] <ornament> Saṃbhogakāya's posture:
[4494] <prose> Like an elephant reclining—
[4495] <prose> Hunched sleeping: the crucial point pressing the body's aggregate dharmas;
[4496] <prose> Knees pressed: the crucial point dropping the elemental heat;
[4497] <prose> Toes stretched outward: the crucial point holding the action wind;
[4498] <prose> Fingertips upon the ground: the crucial point drawing awareness into the expanse;
[4499] <prose> Neck raised upward: the crucial point keeping awareness and expanse inseparable.
[4500] <tantra> From Thalgyur: || 4500 ||
[4501] <verse> Saṃbhogakāya's posture:
[4502] <verse> Relying upon the elephant's sleep,
[4503] <verse> Dharmatā is enjoyed,
[4504] <verse> The lotus eye beholds—
[4505] <tantra> Thus.
[4506] <ornament> Definitive terminology:
[4507] <prose> "Enjoyment" signifies the five desire-objects purified,
[4508] <prose> Leading into the unborn path of dharmatā;
[4509] <prose> Dharmatā's direct crucial point engaged by the eye faculty.
[4510] <prose> "Complete" signifies the method liberating the body's aggregate dharmas into light-clarity. || 4510 ||
[4511] <prose> "Kāya" signifies ripening those, liberated from saṃsāra.
[4512] <prose> Relying upon that crucial point, the person always enjoying dharmatā directly,
[4513] <prose> Is called Saṃbhogakāya.
[4514] <prose> "Posture" signifies abiding in samādhi.
[4515] <prose> "Stance" signifies the crucial point transcending the three realms.
[4516] <tantra> From Golden Garuda:
[4517] <verse> Enjoying from dharmatā's expanse,
[4518] <verse> Relying upon Saṃbhogakāya's posture,
[4519] <verse> This engages the three kāya fields,
[4520] <verse> Therefore the supreme crucial point of body, || 4520 ||
[4521] <verse> The yogin supreme, the chief.
[4522] <tantra> Thus.
[4523] <ornament> Dharmakāya's posture:
[4524] <prose> Like a lion entering its den—
[4525] <prose> Two soles upon the ground: the crucial point equalizing elemental heat;
[4526] <prose> Body flexible in sitting: the crucial point suppressing action wind through wisdom wind's projection;
[4527] <prose> Fingers bent upon the ground: the crucial point reversing the action wind;
[4528] <prose> Chest hollow placed: the crucial point vision quickly dawning;
[4529] <prose> Neck strength relaxed: the crucial point keeping expanse and awareness never separate.
[4530] <tantra> From Thalgyur: || 4530 ||
[4531] <verse> Dharmakāya's posture, the lion:
[4532] <verse> Delusion's fears all abandoned,
[4533] <verse> The vajra eye beholds—
[4534] <tantra> Thus.
[4535] <ornament> Definitive terminology:
[4536] <prose> "Dharma" signifies liberating from the body's aggregates;
[4537] <prose> "Kāya" signifies those completely pure, the illusory kāya always abiding.
[4538] <prose> "Posture" signifies not departing from samādhi's abiding.
[4539] <prose> "Stance" signifies liberating from saṃsāra.
[4540] <tantra> From Golden Garuda: || 4540 ||
[4541] <verse> Dharmakāya's posture manner:
[4542] <verse> Whoever knows the body's crucial point,
[4543] <verse> Compatible with that,
[4544] <verse> Makes the yogin pure in dharmakāya bliss.
[4545] <tantra> Thus.
[4546] <prose> Performing the three kāyas' postures, not transgressing the three kāyas' intent.
[4547] <prose> The Nirmāṇakāya hunched: sign of future liberation through asceticism;
[4548] <prose> The Saṃbhogakāya elephant: sign of future spontaneous effortless liberation;
[4549] <prose> The Dharmakāya lion: sign of future genuine fearless liberation.
[4550] <prose> Why does the elemental body's gaze transform into the three kāyas' gaze? || 4550 ||
[4551] <prose> The three kāyas, luminous-clear, dwell in the heart's innate presence;
[4552] <prose> Making gaze thus manifests the three intents abiding within.
[4553] <prose> Since the three kāyas exist as one's own constituents, one's own gaze becomes the three kāyas' gaze.
[4554] <prose> When cold elemental body harmonizes with Nirmāṇakāya: balanced warmth;
[4555] <prose> When hot: with Dharmakāya;
[4556] <prose> When balanced: with Saṃbhogakāya—auspicious.
[4557] <prose> Particularly, vision increases swiftly.
[4558] <prose> If posture not bent, awareness's self-resonance in the body's channels does not arise;
[4559] <prose> Without raising, awareness-vision does not dawn in outer sky—therefore gaze is precious.
[4560] <prose> Ordinary abiding cannot manifest awareness. || 4560 ||
[4561] <prose> When dawn comes, ordinary abiding cannot increase; moreover decreases—therefore gaze is precious.
[4562] <prose> As the snake's limbs, though in body, not manifest—bend them, they appear;
[4563] <prose> So awareness dawns from the gaze's crucial point.
[4564] <prose> Are postures limited to three?
[4565] <prose> If one, two, three, or hundreds-thousands arise—what then?
[4566] <prose> Sentient beings led by three afflictions into three realms—liberated from that, — therefore three determined.
[4567] <prose> Three afflictions ripening into body, speech, and mind—therefore three determined.
[4568] <prose> First from saṃsāra's karma wheel:
[4569] <prose> Desire impure ripening into form—bird form emerges,
[4570] <prose> Action and doer, speech chief, becoming; || 4570 ||
[4571] <prose> When ripening into body, delight in speech,
[4572] <prose> Object chief, desire great,
[4573] <prose> Delight in desire comes.
[4574] <prose> Taking that into pure path,
[4575] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya posture shown.
[4576] <prose> Such beings always performing supreme Saṃbhogakāya posture
[4577] <prose> Become supreme experts in dharmatā's meaning.
[4578] <prose> From saṃsāra's wheel, delusion impure ripening into form—pig emerges;
[4579] <prose> That producing latency, sentient beings' mind chief form ripening.
[4580] <prose> When ripening into form, mind changes much, intellect changes, conceptuality great, || 4580 ||
[4581] <prose> Not delighting in speech,
[4582] <prose> Always delighting in sleep.
[4583] <prose> Always abiding in Dharmakāya posture, determined to abide in dharmatā for three times.
[4584] <prose> First, aversion impure ripening into form—
[4585] <prose> Snake ripening, body action chief form emerging;
[4586] <prose> Delighting in body action, desire to move,
[4587] <prose> Body strength great, body coarse,
[4588] <break> <prose> Body delighting in grooming, body emerged.
[4589] <prose> Always abiding in Nirmāṇakāya posture, determined to become Buddha.
[4590] <break> <prose> Therefore posture determined as three. || 4590 ||
[4591] <prose> Sentient beings' destiny emerging into body, speech, and mind,
[4592] <prose> Liberating from those bindings—therefore three alone determined.
[4593] <prose> More than that not needed;
[4594] <prose> Few incomplete—therefore three alone determined.
[4595] <ornament> At this time, speech's main point: cutting speech.
[4596] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[4597] <verse> Speech—training, abiding, swallowing—
[4598] <verse> Must be made firm.
[4599] <tantra> Thus.
[4600] <tantra> Thus it is stated. || 4600 ||
