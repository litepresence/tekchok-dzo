[24894] <ornament> First, the Nirmāṇakāya posture:
[24895] <prose> Like a seer hunched in meditation—
[24896] <prose> Two ankles pressed together: the crucial point producing the union of method and wisdom; || 4470 ||
[24897] <prose> Two soles touching the earth: the crucial point suppressing the action winds of grasping;
[24898] <prose> Knees pressed: the crucial point dropping the body's elements into the central channel;
[24899] <prose> Body held straight: the crucial point keeping channels uncompressed, wind naturally slow;
[24900] <prose> Hands crossed: the crucial point mixing expanse and awareness;
[24901] <prose> Neck held straight: the crucial point projecting wind to its object, self-purifying.
[24902] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[24903] <verse> Emanation-kāya's posture:
[24904] <verse> Relying upon the seer's hunch,
[24905] <verse> Dharmatā appearances self-emanate,
[24906] <verse> The Dharma eye beholds— || 4480 ||
[24907] <tantra> Thus.
[24908] <ornament> Definitive terminology:
[24909] <prose> "Emanation" signifies the body's arising and various actions emanated and purified;
[24910] <prose> That purification ripens into the illusory kāya;
[24911] <prose> Posture relies upon the ground of the tantra;
[24912] <prose> Relying upon that posture, not returning to the three realms—
[24913] <tantra> From Golden Garuda:
[24914] <verse> Purifying the body's aggregates,
[24915] <verse> Emanation-kāya's posture;
[24916] <verse> Whoever knows this crucial point, || 4490 ||
[24917] <verse> Liberates from that, becoming Buddha.
[24918] <tantra> Thus.
[24919] <ornament> Saṃbhogakāya's posture:
[24920] <prose> Like an elephant reclining—
[24921] <prose> Hunched sleeping: the crucial point pressing the body's aggregate dharmas;
[24922] <prose> Knees pressed: the crucial point dropping the elemental heat;
[24923] <prose> Toes stretched outward: the crucial point holding the action wind;
[24924] <prose> Fingertips upon the ground: the crucial point drawing awareness into the expanse;
[24925] <prose> Neck raised upward: the crucial point keeping awareness and expanse inseparable.
[24926] <tantra> From Thalgyur: || 4500 ||
[24927] <verse> Saṃbhogakāya's posture:
[24928] <verse> Relying upon the elephant's sleep,
[24929] <verse> Dharmatā is enjoyed,
[24930] <verse> The lotus eye beholds—
[24931] <tantra> Thus.
[24932] <ornament> Definitive terminology:
[24933] <prose> "Enjoyment" signifies the five desire-objects purified,
[24934] <prose> Leading into the unborn path of dharmatā;
[24935] <prose> Dharmatā's direct crucial point engaged by the eye faculty.
[24936] <prose> "Complete" signifies the method liberating the body's aggregate dharmas into light-clarity. || 4510 ||
[24937] <prose> "Kāya" signifies ripening those, liberated from saṃsāra.
[24938] <prose> Relying upon that crucial point, the person always enjoying dharmatā directly,
[24939] <prose> Is called Saṃbhogakāya.
[24940] <prose> "Posture" signifies abiding in samādhi.
[24941] <prose> "Stance" signifies the crucial point transcending the three realms.
[24942] <tantra> From Golden Garuda:
[24943] <verse> Enjoying from dharmatā's expanse,
[24944] <verse> Relying upon Saṃbhogakāya's posture,
[24945] <verse> This engages the three kāya fields,
[24946] <verse> Therefore the supreme crucial point of body, || 4520 ||
[24947] <verse> The yogin supreme, the chief.
[24948] <tantra> Thus.
[24949] <ornament> Dharmakāya's posture:
[24950] <prose> Like a lion entering its den—
[24951] <prose> Two soles upon the ground: the crucial point equalizing elemental heat;
[24952] <prose> Body flexible in sitting: the crucial point suppressing action wind through wisdom wind's projection;
[24953] <prose> Fingers bent upon the ground: the crucial point reversing the action wind;
[24954] <prose> Chest hollow placed: the crucial point vision quickly dawning;
[24955] <prose> Neck strength relaxed: the crucial point keeping expanse and awareness never separate.
[24956] <tantra> From Thalgyur: || 4530 ||
[24957] <verse> Dharmakāya's posture, the lion:
[24958] <verse> Delusion's fears all abandoned,
[24959] <verse> The vajra eye beholds—
[24960] <tantra> Thus.
[24961] <ornament> Definitive terminology:
[24962] <prose> "Dharma" signifies liberating from the body's aggregates;
[24963] <prose> "Kāya" signifies those completely pure, the illusory kāya always abiding.
[24964] <prose> "Posture" signifies not departing from samādhi's abiding.
[24965] <prose> "Stance" signifies liberating from saṃsāra.
[24966] <tantra> From Golden Garuda: || 4540 ||
[24967] <verse> Dharmakāya's posture manner:
[24968] <verse> Whoever knows the body's crucial point,
[24969] <verse> Compatible with that,
[24970] <verse> Makes the yogin pure in dharmakāya bliss.
[24971] <tantra> Thus.
[24972] <prose> Performing the three kāyas' postures, not transgressing the three kāyas' intent.
[24973] <prose> The Nirmāṇakāya hunched: sign of future liberation through asceticism;
[24974] <prose> The Saṃbhogakāya elephant: sign of future spontaneous effortless liberation;
[24975] <prose> The Dharmakāya lion: sign of future genuine fearless liberation.
[24976] <prose> Why does the elemental body's gaze transform into the three kāyas' gaze? || 4550 ||
[24977] <prose> The three kāyas, luminous-clear, dwell in the heart's innate presence;
[24978] <prose> Making gaze thus manifests the three intents abiding within.
[24979] <prose> Since the three kāyas exist as one's own constituents, one's own gaze becomes the three kāyas' gaze.
[24980] <prose> When cold elemental body harmonizes with Nirmāṇakāya: balanced warmth;
[24981] <prose> When hot: with Dharmakāya;
[24982] <prose> When balanced: with Saṃbhogakāya—auspicious.
[24983] <prose> Particularly, vision increases swiftly.
[24984] <prose> If posture not bent, awareness's self-resonance in the body's channels does not arise;
[24985] <prose> Without raising, awareness-vision does not dawn in outer sky—therefore gaze is precious.
[24986] <prose> Ordinary abiding cannot manifest awareness. || 4560 ||
[24987] <prose> When dawn comes, ordinary abiding cannot increase; moreover decreases—therefore gaze is precious.
[24988] <prose> As the snake's limbs, though in body, not manifest—bend them, they appear;
[24989] <prose> So awareness dawns from the gaze's crucial point.
[24990] <prose> Are postures limited to three?
[24991] <prose> If one, two, three, or hundreds-thousands arise—what then?
[24992] <prose> Sentient beings led by three afflictions into three realms—liberated from that, — therefore three determined.
[24993] <prose> Three afflictions ripening into body, speech, and mind—therefore three determined.
[24994] <prose> First from saṃsāra's karma wheel:
[24995] <prose> Desire impure ripening into form—bird form emerges,
[24996] <prose> Action and doer, speech chief, becoming; || 4570 ||
[24997] <prose> When ripening into body, delight in speech,
[24998] <prose> Object chief, desire great,
[24999] <prose> Delight in desire comes.
[25000] <prose> Taking that into pure path,
[25001] <prose> Saṃbhogakāya posture shown.
[25002] <prose> Such beings always performing supreme Saṃbhogakāya posture
[25003] <prose> Become supreme experts in dharmatā's meaning.
[25004] <prose> From saṃsāra's wheel, delusion impure ripening into form—pig emerges;
[25005] <prose> That producing latency, sentient beings' mind chief form ripening.
[25006] <prose> When ripening into form, mind changes much, intellect changes, conceptuality great, || 4580 ||
[25007] <prose> Not delighting in speech,
[25008] <prose> Always delighting in sleep.
[25009] <prose> Always abiding in Dharmakāya posture, determined to abide in dharmatā for three times.
[25010] <prose> First, aversion impure ripening into form—
[25011] <prose> Snake ripening, body action chief form emerging;
[25012] <prose> Delighting in body action, desire to move,
[25013] <prose> Body strength great, body coarse,
[25014] <break> <prose> Body delighting in grooming, body emerged.
[25015] <prose> Always abiding in Nirmāṇakāya posture, determined to become Buddha.
[25016] <break> <prose> Therefore posture determined as three. || 4590 ||
[25017] <prose> Sentient beings' destiny emerging into body, speech, and mind,
[25018] <prose> Liberating from those bindings—therefore three alone determined.
[25019] <prose> More than that not needed;
[25020] <prose> Few incomplete—therefore three alone determined.
[25021] <ornament> At this time, speech's main point: cutting speech.
[25022] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[25023] <verse> Speech—training, abiding, swallowing—
[25024] <verse> Must be made firm.
[25025] <tantra> Thus.
[25026] <tantra> Thus it is stated. || 4600 ||
