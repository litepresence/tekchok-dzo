[30139] <ornament> First: These various outer white-red appearances, clear in expanse gathered by five elements of container-contents,
[30140] <break> <prose> Except appearing on face of self-mind's delusion, outer meaning thing,
[30141] <prose> And inner mind's thing, both not established,
[30142] <prose> Should understand as like deluded hair-shadow and dream illusion appearance, nature of clear-appear without base-without empty miracle.
[30143] <tantra> From Six Expanses:
[30144] <prose> All appearance is illusion,
[30145] <prose> Like dream and reflection.
[30146] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 9720 ||
[30147] <tantra> From Root Wisdom:
[30148] <prose> Like dream, like illusion,
[30149] <prose> Like gandharva city,
[30150] <break> <prose> Like-that arising and like-that abiding,
[30151] <break> <prose> Like-that also not destroyed. Thus it is spoken.
[30152] <prose> Appearing to mind whatever appears,
[30153] <prose> Like appearance to impure sense-power of eye-defect's hair-shadow.
[30154] <tantra> From that same source:
[30155] <prose> To mind itself existing as object,
[30156] <prose> Various appearances self-arise. || 9730 ||
[30157] <prose> Name and color individually
[30158] <prose> Complete as two aspects of form.
[30159] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[30160] <prose> Though appearing to mind, these outer-clear appearance manners are not self's mind,
[30161] <prose> Existing also without self,
[30162] <break> <prose> Abiding as field,
[30163] <break> <prose> Color,
[30164] <prose> Because seeing as shape etc.
[30165] <prose> Not mind because those do not exist in mind.
[30166] <prose> Here, giving introduction like dream delusion of clear-appear, not existing: these appearances of outer appearance fields like form etc., || 9740 ||
[30167] <verse> "This is form,"
[30168] <prose> Thinking color etc., arising-arising, first the appearance-field of arising, holding that is called "mind of appearance,"
[30169] <prose> Called "mind of grasping,"
[30170] <prose> Having seized essence, called "mind of field."
[30171] <prose> Questioning if that mind of appearance exists: not true by holding clear-appear without field,
[30172] <prose> Also not existing by color not established as essence seize,
[30173] <prose> Also not existing by examining in three: arise, cease, abide.
[30174] <prose> Called "giving introduction of mind itself as empty,"
[30175] <prose> Give introduction as wisdom Buddha without self-dissolving place.
[30176] <prose> Therefore ordinary Dharma and || 9750 ||
[30177] <prose> Great perfect ordinary's appearance,
[30178] <prose> Not separating appearance field,
[30179] <prose> Desiring outer appearance field self-characteristic as mind
[30180] <prose> Is mistake into odor-with various-true mind-only.
[30181] <prose> Here, at time of giving introduction of appearance as mind, mind holding as appear-not-appear,
[30182] <prose> Mind of appearance to mind first meeting field,
[30183] <break> <prose> After, examining that distinction as mental event, desiring called "mind of holding,"
[30184] <break> <prose> Called "saṃsāra: delusion-hold, delusion-appear, purify, abandon."
[30185] <prose>
[30186] <prose> In two truths, || 9760 ||
[30187] <prose> Of mind and mental-event, three realms',
[30188] <prose> Superimposing aspect is concept.
[30189] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[30190] <tantra> From Treasury:
[30191] <verse> "Concept and examine coarse-subtle."
[30192] <prose> Thus explained as abandonment, entering together all meaning—this great essential point should be realized by those possessing supreme holy wisdom intelligence.
[30193] <prose> Also, need one like this for meeting baseless outer-inner.
[30194] <prose> Second, establishing secret space by inner mind's essential point:
[30195] <prose> When not seizing essence by examining mind,
[30196] <prose> Not becoming like inert, || 9770 ||
[30197] <prose> Though declaring not knowing spread-spread clear without essence seize,
[30198] <prose> Give introduction as inner Dharma-space of Dharma-ceasing, arising primordially pure, stain-free space of self-clear empty self-tone manner,
[30199] <prose> Realization of limit-free, stain-free arises from within.
[30200] <prose> Seeing also secondary appearance of luminosity space-appear by familiarizing in that manner.
[30201] <tantra> From Introduction Ornament:
[30202] <prose> By empty not-existing from-beginning,
[30203] <prose> Element self-ceasing, light-appearance ray.
[30204] <prose> By empty free of action-agent,
[30205] <prose> Obtain light-appearance indicating three bodies.
[30206] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 9780 ||
[30207] <prose> Third, establishing supreme awareness by secret space's essential point:
[30208] <prose> That mind-pure empty in space is not mere empty extreme,
[30209] <prose> Clear — snap,
[30210] <prose> Give introduction to Dharmakaya free from stain, wisdom of awareness by individual self-clear self-clear.
[30211] <prose> Not going to extreme from awareness portion,
[30212] <prose> Not going to eternal by thing not-existing,
[30213] <prose> Placed in decided manner in great vast limit-free expanse of not-two-both and not-two-both by nowhere declaring.
[30214] <prose> Self-appear awareness self-tone nadi-thread with bindu.
[30215] <tantra> From that same source:
[30216] <prose> By awareness abiding in base, || 9790 ||
[30217] <prose> Meet space of gathered Dharma-nature.
[30218] <prose> By awareness holding characteristic,
[30219] <prose> Meet pure complete space.
[30220] <prose> By nadi-thread awareness,
[30221] <prose> Meet light space of nature.
[30222] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[30223] <prose> Thus giving introduction to baseless appearance field.
[30224] <prose> Transcend saṃsāra of appearance field's container-contents.
[30225] <prose> Giving introduction of appearance as mind,
[30226] <prose> Knowing object of self-dissolving arise-liberate. || 9800 ||
[30227] <prose> Giving introduction of mind itself as empty,
[30228] <prose> Cut root of grasp-hold delusion.
[30229] <prose> Giving introduction of empty as space-awareness,
[30230] <prose> Rolling experience of three bodies into one,
[30231] <prose> For obtaining perfect Buddha in one life,
[30232] <prose> Demonstrating introduction of delusion reversing manner from mind as very important.
[30233] <prose> By example introduction:
[30234] <prose> Meaning of wisdom of awareness existing in self,
[30235] <prose> Demonstrating sign confidence by awakening mind's lamp.
[30236] <tantra> From that same source: || 9810 ||
[30237] <prose> Holding measure of all Buddhas,
[30238] <prose> Examine example wisdoms.
[30239] <prose> Holding measure of sign wisdom,
[30240] <break> <prose> Examine lamp of empty bindu.
[30241] <break> <prose> Holding measure of meaning wisdom,
[30242] <break> <prose> Examine clear manifest appearance.
[30243] <break> <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[30244] <prose> Briefly summarized:
[30245] <prose> Outer appearance field baseless,
[30246] <prose> Giving introduction of mind of holding that appearance as empty, || 9820 ||
[30247] <prose> Knowing saṃsāra delusion as one groundless,
[30248] <prose> Not sufficient by that,
[30249] <prose> Giving introduction manifestly to meaning of root awareness, giving introduction without gathering-separation of space-awareness,
[30250] <prose> Instruction to supreme excellent intelligences: should deliver to primordially pure Dharmakaya.
[30251] <break> <prose> Second meaning: introduction of self-appear wisdom has two aspects:
[30252] <break> <prose> Distinction of sense-power of instruction object,
[30253] <prose> And sequence of instruction introduction.
[30254] <ornament> First:
[30255] <prose> Dividing best, middle, and last three sense-powers into sevens makes twenty-one.
[30256] <prose> Those all also: wisdom, || 9830 ||
[30257] <prose> Purification,
[30258] <prose> Different liberation.
[30259] <prose> First, called "best":
[30260] <prose> Portion of wisdom and realization.
[30261] <prose> Also dividing that, seven:
[30262] <prose> Best's last and
[30263] <prose> Best's middle and
[30264] <prose> Best's best and
[30265] <break> <prose> Best's advanced and
[30266] <break> <prose> Best's supreme and || 9840 ||
[30267] <break> <prose> Best's peak and
[30268] <break> <prose> Best's end reaching.
[30269] <prose> Placing those all from portion of easily realizing self-appear.
[30270] <prose> Also seven for middle:
[30271] <prose> Middle's last and
[30272] <break> <prose> Middle's middle and
[30273] <break> <prose> Middle's best and
[30274] <prose> Middle's advanced and
[30275] <prose> Middle's supreme and
[30276] <prose> Middle's peak and || 9850 ||
[30277] <prose> Middle's end reaching.
[30278] <prose> Likewise, also seven for last:
[30279] <prose> Last's last and
[30280] <prose> Last's middle and
[30281] <prose> Last's best and
[30282] <prose> Last's supreme and
[30283] <prose> Last's advanced and
[30284] <prose> Last's peak and
[30285] <prose> Last's peak complete.
[30286] <break> <ornament> Second: || 9860 ||
[30287] <break> <prose> Thus twenty-one sense-powers arise, twenty-one introductions also arise.
[30288] <prose> That also, from individually giving introduction, two:
[30289] <prose> Common distinction,
[30290] <prose> Distinct indicative manner.
[30291] <ornament> First:
[30292] <prose> To three: light, wisdom, awareness,
[30293] <prose> Giving introduction as seven groups.
[30294] <tantra> From Vajra-Mind Heart Mirror Tantra:
[30295] <prose> Awareness transcends from base,
[30296] <prose> Should know twenty-one introductions—example meaning introduction etc.—for making known entering path. || 9870 ||
[30297] <prose> Snow or
[30298] <prose> Conch or
[30299] <break> <prose> One crystal without stain arising from ocean:
[30300] <break> <prose> Extend to window's appearance,
[30301] <prose> Five colors of light spontaneously arise.
[30302] <prose> Also, what are those?
[30303] <prose> Blue color and
[30304] <prose> White and
[30305] <prose> Yellow and
[30306] <prose> Red and || 9880 ||
[30307] <prose> Green.
[30308] <prose> That person following one crystal: hold right eye with right hand,
[30309] <prose> Place on eye's top, appearance will be seen; block left eye with left hand.
[30310] <prose> That is example introduction.
[30311] <prose> Meaning thus abides in self's heart center.
[30312] <prose> That is meaning introduction.
[30313] <prose> Press eye with self's thumb, sign: bindu of light arises like fish eye.
[30314] <prose> That is sign introduction.
[30315] <prose> Dharmakaya introduction:

[30319] <prose> Place crystal on eye's top,
[30320] <prose> Look eye to sky,
[30321] <prose> Enjoyment complete body possessing mouth, eye, ear will be seen.
[30322] <break> <prose>
[30323] <break> <prose> Giving introduction to emanation body:
[30324] <break> <prose> Make know essence: dharma-possessor appearing as sign is miracle of self-awareness.
[30325] <prose> Make know as mass of self's light rays on Dharma day.
[30326] <prose> Make know essence without abandoning this interior of concept habit-continuum. || 9900 ||
[30327] <break> <prose> That is emanation body's introduction.
[30328] <prose> That root bind method introduction of appearance arising in self-manner.
[30329] <prose> Thus seven aspects called "light introduction."
[30330] <prose> What is wisdom's introduction?
[30331] <prose> Examining essence of copper vessel: introduction of Dharma space's wisdom.
[30332] <prose> Fill copper vessel well with water,
[30333] <prose> Place clear-making mirror on eye's top, look:
[30334] <prose> Bindu and
[30335] <prose> Arising as bindu particle manner,
[30336] <prose> Also from that, light and || 9910 ||
[30337] <prose> Emanate like weapon point.
[30338] <prose> That is Dharma space's wisdom introduction.
[30339] <prose> What is mirror-like wisdom's introduction?
[30340] <prose> Draw dust-color mandala between two silver mirrors,
[30341] <prose> Place mirror each on two near sides comparing interval,
[30342] <tantra> From that, two appearances arise.
[30343] <prose> Introduction of equality wisdom:
[30344] <prose> Seize essence on water moon.

[30353] <prose> Those seven are wisdom's introduction.
[30354] <prose> Now demonstrating awareness's introduction:
[30355] <prose> Introduction of awareness youth vase body:
[30356] <prose> Place one wearing white clothes before self, || 9930 ||

[30373] <prose> Introduction of awareness not abiding in anything:
[30374] <prose> Should know by looking eye to space-between.
[30375] <prose> Thus seven are awareness's introduction.
[30376] <prose> Having completed twenty-one thus, || 9950 ||
[30377] <prose> At the time when that Buddha-family son passes from nirvāṇa,
[30378] <prose> Awareness arises from eye path, enters intermediate appearance. Thus it is spoken.
[30379] <prose> Second, two aspects of distinctive indicative manner:

[30558] <prose> To all middling elaboration: at light, two—interior light and outer appearance.
[30559] <prose> At wisdom, three—essence, nature, compassion.
[30560] <prose> At body: self-single, father-mother.
[30561] <prose> Three collections.
[30562] <prose> At bindu: three—ground, path, result.
[30563] <prose> At awareness: three—base-abiding, characteristic-holding, field-appearance.
[30564] <prose> At space: two—outer, inner; demonstrating by sixteen enumeration of introduction.
[30565] <prose> To all small elaboration: three—example, meaning, sign.
[30566] <prose> To all very free from elaboration: meeting essence by manifest single appearance. || 10140 ||
[30567] <tantra> From that same source:
[30568] <prose> For purpose of all great ones,
[30569] <prose> By twenty-one introductions,
[30570] <prose> Gather that from outer to inner.
[30571] <break> <prose> Also gathered: these all.
[30572] <break> <prose> At light, two; at wisdom, three.
[30573] <prose> At body, three demonstrated; at bindu, three.
[30574] <prose> Awareness, three; at space, two.
[30575] <prose> For meaning of gathering those all.
[30576] <break> <prose> Very gathered: these all. || 10150 ||
[30577] <break> <prose> By three: example, sign, meaning,
[30578] <prose> Obtain fruit of abiding self-nature.
[30579] <break> <prose> Enter god's yogin mudra,
[30580] <break> <prose> For meaning of sign-possessing.
[30581] <prose> Intention of single elaboration-free:
[30582] <prose> Free holding of all those.
[30583] <prose> Make ripening having ripened as path.
[30584] <prose> To abiding by manifest continuum,
[30585] <prose> By self seeing self heart-essence,
[30586] <prose> What do by all other efforts? || 10160 ||
[30587] <prose> Should familiarize with this itself.
[30588] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[30589] <prose> Abandoning inner scriptural contradiction:
[30590] <tantra> From Jewel Intricate Display:
[30591] <prose> Alas, Buddha-family son, after I completely pass from nirvāṇa,
[30592] <prose> At the time of five hundred degenerations,
[30593] <prose> By those possessing deceiving child's nature,
[30594] <prose> The time arises of making confidence in Buddha's intention through example.
[30595] <prose> At that time, this secret tantra of self arises.
[30596] <prose> True awareness itself cannot be demonstrated by example. || 10170 ||
[30597] <prose> To five lights of nature existing as self-nature,
[30598] <prose> Though demonstrating five lights of image, will not become Buddha.
[30599] <prose> Question: Is example introduction not blocked?
[30600] <prose> That is: without seeing meaning of manifest awareness, mind-examining-holding—some say awareness's example is like this, like sky;
[30601] <prose> Some say different elements;
[30602] <prose> Some say light;
[30603] <prose> Demonstrate by god's body.
[30604] <prose> Common vehicle general,
[30605] <prose> Making only pure nature of low for some portions of outer-inner secret,
[30606] <prose> To negate base of primordially pure awareness, || 10180 ||
[30607] <prose> Is spoken for negating grasping at thing's self-characteristic.
[30608] <prose> At this occasion demonstrating meaning of secret heart essence,
[30609] <prose> However much demonstrating example, no deviation,
[30610] <prose> No grasping place.
[30611] <prose> Those seeing manifest awareness, though introduction only as that's helper,
[30612] <prose> Again essence,
[30613] <prose> Expansion,
[30614] <prose> By dissolve manner, like crystal, great open primordially pure—demonstrate by crystal above pure,
[30615] <prose> With suitability.
[30616] <prose> That tantra also demonstrates this little, speaks thus. || 10190 ||
[30617] <tantra> From that same source:
[30618] <prose> Indicative example of Vajra-Mind:
[30619] <break> <prose> White color, moon's color,
[30620] <break> <prose> Etc., thus demonstrating awareness by three: example, sign, meaning,
[30621] <prose> Demonstrating birthless, ceaseless, open expanse.
[30622] <prose> Then this introduction suitable to sense-power:
[30623] <prose> With experience-taking hand-guidance,
[30624] <prose> Without deviation place, without stagnate place,
[30625] <prose> Ear lineage and hand gesture together,
[30626] <prose> Confidence, || 10200 ||
[30627] <prose> Cutting superimposition,
[30628] <prose> Connecting word and meaning.
[30629] <prose> Supreme introduction spoken for demonstrating place of Buddha's Dharma lineage.
[30630] <prose> ### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[30631] <prose> Demonstrating by relying on difficult introduction of vajra place,
[30632] <prose> Thus concludes the twenty-first chapter.
[30633] <prose> Thus having extensively demonstrated sequence of taking experience,
[30634] <prose> Now, demonstrating sequence of determining signs of yogin experience-taker has three aspects:
[30635] <prose> Generally demonstrating meaning of how purifying signs in former life now abide in body, speech, mind;
[30636] <prose> Explaining distinction of arising manner to three-door appearance possessing signs of now entering path. || 10210 ||
