[24854] <prose> Fourth, regarding these: through the four supports or companions, if the pith is not familiarized, familiarization does not reach the measure. Therefore the final support instruction and four topics are taught:
[24855] <tantra> From the Glorious Mountain-Stack Tantra:
[24856] <verse> If one desires to familiarize the direct pith, || 4430 ||
[24857] <verse> The pith is distinguished as four sections.
[24858] <tantra> Thus it is.
[24859] <prose> The certainty of completing the path through four topics:
[24860] <prose> Externally, exhausting the appearances of the four emanations with their supports;
[24861] <prose> Internally, exhausting the increase and decrease of the four times;
[24862] <prose> Secretly, exhausting the changes of the four day-moons;
[24863] <prose> Supreme, emptying the ground of the four body-speech-mind-consciousness—thus four certainties.
[24864] <prose> Moreover, externally demonstrating the certainty of the four empowerments;
[24865] <prose> Internally, expanding the channels of the four wheels;
[24866] <prose> Secretly, actually clarifying the four wisdoms; || 4440 ||
[24867] <prose> Supreme, showing the increase of the four lamps—thus four topics are taught.
[24868] <prose> If more than this, chattering is purposeless;
[24869] <prose> If fewer, without root, the fruit of the desired meaning does not ripen—depending on purpose, thus four arise.
[24870] <ornament> First, exhausting the pith of body and speech:
[24871] <tantra> From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra:
[24872] <verse> Thus having gone before,
[24873] <verse> In order to look at the direct meaning,
[24874] <verse> Body, speech, and mind are thoroughly bound.
[24875] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[24876] <prose> Here there are three: || 4450 ||
[24877] <list> Establishing the three kāyas' postures of the body;
[24878] <list> Speech not speaking anything, like a mute;
[24879] <list> Cutting the proliferating thoughts of mind's dispersion and gathering.
[24880] <ornament> First:
[24881] <tantra> From that itself:
[24882] <verse> The body—like a lion,
[24883] <verse> Like a sage, and like an elephant:
[24884] <verse> If one does not move from these,
[24885] <verse> Even with three thousand Buddhas,
[24886] <verse> The fortune is equal. || 4460 ||
[24887] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[24888] <tantra> From the Pearl Garland:
[24889] <verse> The body's pith is threefold:
[24890] <verse> The lion's manner and elephant's manner,
[24891] <verse> Abide like a sage.
[24892] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[24893] <prose> Here, the three kāyas too, though the supports are different, through three different postures of a single body—
