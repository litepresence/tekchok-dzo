[23339] <prose> Able to transfer other-sickness upon other.
[23340] <prose> This time, transfer guru's sickness upon other, and—
[23341] <prose> Do not transfer upon inanimate other than transfer upon inanimate.
[23342] <prose> Because contradicts abandoning harm to sentient-beings from mantra-samaya.
[23343] <prose> And do not transfer sickness in nature.
[23344] <prose> Born to purify self-other's obscurations, and—
[23345] <prose> Because transferred also arises again.

[23347] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[23348] <prose> Two types of transfer-action.
[23349] <prose> Actual itself, emptiness.
[23350] <prose> Actual included by form.
[23351] <tantra> From mastering elements thus.
[23352] <prose> And made depending upon familiarized wind.
[23353] <prose> Upon whatever actual-form.
[23354] <prose> Able to move by placed awareness.
[23355] <prose> Then begin actual-transfer.
[23356] <prose> Chief is familiarized emptiness-mind. || 2930 ||
[23357] <prose> Dharma-space, Dharmakaya.
[23358] <prose> Know by non-dual practice-emptiness.
[23359] <prose> Upon emptiness-clear nature.
[23360] <prose> Mind also within that's state.
[23361] <prose> By complete dependent-arising ritual.
[23362] <prose> Method of releasing point-transfer, and.
[23363] <prose> Know from voice-recitation.
[23364] <prose> By each element-body meeting.
[23365] <prose> Do transfer by seeing only.
[23366] <prose> By skilled wind-joined. || 2940 ||
[23367] <prose> However, if reached upon actual-accomplishment.
[23368] <prose> Accomplish all actions by invisible-form.
[23369] <prose> If see substance of actual-attachment.
[23370] <prose> Take by transfer because offer to guru.
[23371] <prose> Do not do other.
[23372] <prose> Thus, mount, form, etc.
[23373] <prose> If hero-guru commands.
[23374] <prose> Take this also by familiarized wind.
[23375] <prose> By possessing attract-mind.
[23376] <prose> Do transfer by yogi. || 2950 ||
[23377] <prose> Thus it is.
[23378] <prose> Accomplish transfer by mastering wind of all four elements in nature, and.
[23379] <prose> Accomplish by especially mastering karma-wind.
[23380] <prose> Transfer is also appearance-mind mixed, power obtained over elements.
[23381] <prose> Not only transfer sickness alone, bliss-suffering fixation, and.
[23382] <prose> Area and—
[23383] <prose> Transfer forests etc. not exists.
[23384] <prose> Transfer not exists.
[23385] <prose> Attract transfer here that exists within other area.
[23386] <prose> Project transfer to other that exists here. || 2960 ||
[23387] <prose> Transfer like sentient-beings coming to inanimate-actual's self-place.
[23388] <prose> Draw mount, girl, etc. by wind to sky, transfer to self-place.
[23389] <prose> For example: great master Padma transferred Mangyul mountains, and—
[23390] <prose> Transferred Ne'u-thang and tree-forest within Samye, like exists until now.
[23391] <prose> This is supreme for accomplishing yogi's wishes.
[23392] <tantra> From Thalgyur:
[23393] <prose> Yogi of great fortune wishes transfer.
[23394] <prose> Upon included rigpa-with mind.
[23395] <prose> Upon living that appears as form.
[23396] <prose> By inner-consistent karma change. || 2970 ||
[23397] <prose> Transfer self-sickness etc. upon other.
[23398] <prose> By thus transferred, free from actual.
[23399] <prose> Do other by dependent-arising practice.
[23400] <tantra> From four inanimate elements.
[23401] <prose> By dependent-arising become actual.
[23402] <prose> By numbers, code, sounds.
[23403] <prose> Transfer sickness etc. by transforming focus.
[23404] <prose> Wood, stones, pieces, and—
[23405] <prose> Grass, sticks, twists, etc.
[23406] <prose> Thus water, earth, sky also. || 2980 ||
[23407] <prose> Hold certainly transfer-action.
[23408] <prose> Transform by yoga-mind-power.
[23409] <prose> Thus it is.
[23410] <ornament> Second: Dream—two:
[23411] <prose> Preliminary and—
[23412] <prose> Actual.
[23413] <prose> First, from three:
[23414] <prose> Training—day prostrations, circumambulations, recitation, mind's projection-gathering by force—purified body-speech-mind three—many flickering-flickering dreams arise—is measure of mastered.
[23415] <prose> Thus, then from those dreams—examine latency subtle-thick—then day very relaxed, slightly trembling release—think hold and examine dream—made without distraction from one-pointed.
[23416] <prose> If much dream of before-fixation objects etc. || 2990 ||
[23417] <prose> Because great before-fixation latency—difficult, easy, medium transform.
[23418] <prose> If much dream now—very easy—mastered in about three-four days.
[23419] <prose> And place not reached before.
[23420] <prose> If dream human etc. not-experienced meet—difficult to cut.
[23421] <prose> If three all mixed-mixed dream—three latencies combined—very difficult to cut.
[23422] <prose> Suppress is dream-hold.
[23423] <prose> Upon this—aspiration one-pointed only—oral-instruction point is.
[23424] <prose> By made sudden stable aspiration, certainty, thinking day-dream is here arose.
[23425] <prose> Night held certainly.
[23426] <prose> This time—cheat people, transform. || 3000 ||
[23427] <prose> Emanate, transform, and—
[23428] <prose> By train capacity of area, realms, view, etc.
[23429] <prose> Is suppress appearance.
[23430] <prose> By made first great guru-devotion, aspiration upon that.
