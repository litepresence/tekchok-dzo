[8810] <prose> Behold—the spontaneous sound of awareness, self-arisen, self-liberated. || 8810 ||
[8811] <prose> Not fabricated, not sought: this very sound resounds without a source.
[8812] <prose> Elaborate? It is the play of unborn emptiness.
[8813] <prose> Unelaborate? The same play, naturally free.
[8814] <prose> Very unelaborate? Awareness recognizing itself in every echo.
[8815] <prose> Utterly unelaborate? Neither sound nor silence—pure recognition, naked and immediate.
[8816] <prose> Do you hear it? This is not hearing with ears.
[8817] <prose> The person capable of recognition enters thus: appearances not cut, naturally pure.
[8818] <prose> Consciousness not ceased—self-liberated upon arising.
[8819] <prose> Outer: wind-mind, father-mother—all are the spontaneous display of awareness.
[8820] <prose> Inner: body-wheel, channel-difference—your own nature, naturally perfect. || 8820 ||
[8821] <prose> Secret: lamp four appearances—self-showing, self-recognized.
[8822] <prose> Unsurpassed: no face to show, no path to clear—recognition itself is the four certainties.
[8823] <list> Second, showing the spontaneous ripening:
[8824] <prose> When recognition dawns, ripening-appearance: pure and impure, sky and space—all included in awareness.
[8825] <prose> Desire-destruction dwell in three times—all included in this instant of recognition.
[8826] <prose> Body, speech, mind—this very recognition liberates.
[8827] <prose> Saṃsāra-Nirvāṇa—conditioned and unconditioned become one in recognition.
[8828] <prose> Appearance-control: aggregates, elements, sense-sources—spontaneously pure, never stained.
[8829] <prose> Existence-control: afflictions—self-liberated in their own ground.
[8830] <prose> Recognition enters through body, speech, mind, consciousness—action spontaneously shows. || 8830 ||
[8831] <prose> Elaborate recognition: obtain, dwell, stabilize, near-realize—four aspects of one taste.
[8832] <prose> Very unelaborate: body, speech, mind, consciousness—fourfold bliss of natural awareness.
[8833] <prose> Utterly unelaborate: three doors, deity body-speech-mind—beyond expression, beyond dwelling.
[8834] <list> Third, the nature of recognition—fourfold spontaneous perfection:
[8835] <prose> The field is good: awareness itself, stainless and vast.
[8836] <prose> The seed faultless: recognition, never separate from you.
[8837] <prose> Elaborate recognition planted, unelaborate sprout arises.
[8838] <prose> Very unelaborate: the flower of awareness shines.
[8839] <prose> Utterly unelaborate: four kayas certain—this is the ripened result.
[8840] <list> From each recognition—four divisions spontaneously perfect. || 8840 ||
