[31252-31256] <thig-le-ngo-bo-bindu-nature-reification> <sphere-essence-objectification>

**Misreading:**
The "nature of bindu" (*thig le'i ngo bo*) interpreted as actual spherical object with essence, creating bindu-materialization.

**Why it arises:**
"Nature" suggests essence. "Bindu" implies sphere. Objectification: things have essences. The practitioner materializes bindu.

**Primary consequence:**
Bindu-materialization: treating thig-le as physical sphere. Natural bindu is obscured by object-fixation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "The bindu is located in my channels"
- Missing that bindu indicates indivisibility
- Sphere-hunting over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<thig-le-ngo-bo-bindu-nature-reification> → <bindu-materialization> [object fixation] → <sphere-hunting> [locating bindu] → <indivisibility-miss> [object over nature]

[31257-31261] <thig-mi-gyur-bindu-unchanging-fixation> <bindu-immutability-attachment>

**Misreading:**
The "bindu unchanging" (*thig mi 'gyur ba*) interpreted as permanent unchanging substance, creating permanence-fixation.

**Why it arises:**
"Unchanging" suggests permanence. Etymology implies stability. Eternalism: find the permanent. The practitioner seeks unchanging bindu.

**Primary consequence:**
Permanence-fixation: treating unchanging as eternal substance. Natural unchanging is obscured by permanence-seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I must find the unchanging bindu"
- Missing that unchanging indicates natural state
- Eternalism-over-recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<thig-mi-gyur-bindu-unchanging-fixation> → <permanence-fixation> [eternal substance] → <eternalism> [unchanging sphere] → <natural-state-miss> [permanence over nature]

[31262-31265] <thig-le-dbye-ba-bindu-classification-obsession> <bindu-typology-mania>

**Misreading:**
The threefold classification of bindus (*lus gnas rtsa'i thig le*, etc.) interpreted as types to master, creating bindu-typology-obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests list. "Classification" implies categories. Scholarly mind: catalog types. The practitioner inventories bindus.

**Primary consequence:**
Bindu-typology: treating three as separate categories. Natural unity is obscured by classification.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm working with the path bindu now"
- Missing that three are aspects of single bindu
- Type-obsession over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<thig-le-dbye-ba-bindu-classification-obsession> → <bindu-typology> [category fixation] → <type-inventory> [cataloging bindus] → <unity-miss> [types over one]

[31266-31268] <kun-rdzob-rgyu-thig-le-conventional-cause-bindu-duality> <conventional-ultimate-bindu-dualism>

**Misreading:**
The distinction between conventional cause bindus (white/red) and ultimate wisdom bindus (five) interpreted as two different bindus, creating bindu-dualism.

**Why it arises:**
"Conventional/ultimate" suggests levels. Two sets implies duality. Dualistic mind: separate phenomena. The practitioner separates bindus.

**Primary consequence:**
Bindu-dualism: treating conventional/ultimate as different. Natural non-duality is obscured by level-separation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "The white/red bindus are lower, the five wisdom bindus are higher"
- Hierarchy of bindus
- Missing that all are single display

**Cascade effects:**
<kun-rdzob-rgyu-thig-le-conventional-cause-bindu-duality> → <bindu-dualism> [level separation] → <bindu-hierarchy> [higher/lower] → <non-duality-miss> [dualism over unity]

[31269-31275] <ye-shes-thig-le-wisdom-bindu-achievement> <wisdom-sphere-attainment>

**Misreading:**
The five wisdom bindus (*ye shes kyi thig le lnga*) interpreted as five attainments to achieve, creating wisdom-bindu-collection.

**Why it arises:**
"Five" suggests set. "Wisdom" implies attainment. Achievement-mind: collect wisdoms. The practitioner seeks five bindus.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom-bindu-collection: treating five as acquisitions. Natural wisdom is obscured by pursuit.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I have three of the five wisdom bindus"
- Missing that five are single awareness
- Collection-over-recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<ye-shes-thig-le-wisdom-bindu-achievement> → <wisdom-bindu-collection> [five acquisitions] → <set-completion> [getting all five] → <single-awareness-miss> [collection over nature]

[31276-31279] <lam-gyi-thig-le-path-bindu-development> <path-sphere-progress>

**Misreading:**
The "path bindu" (*lam gyi thig le*) interpreted as bindu that develops along the path, creating bindu-development-project.

**Why it arises:**
"Path" suggests journey. "Bindu" implies object. Developmental mind: grow the bindu. The practitioner develops bindu.

**Primary consequence:**
Bindu-development: treating bindu as improvable. Natural bindu is obscured by growth-project.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My path bindu is developing"
- Missing that path indicates recognition, not growth
- Development-over-immediacy

**Cascade effects:**
<lam-gyi-thig-le-path-bindu-development> → <bindu-development> [growth project] → <improvement-fixation> [better bindu] → <natural-bindu-miss> [development over nature]

[31280-31286] <chos-nyid-thig-le-dharmata-bindu-philosophicalization> <dharmata-sphere-intellectualization>

**Misreading:**
The "dharmata bindu" (*chos nyid kyi thig le*) interpreted as philosophical concept to understand, creating dharmata-intellectualization.

**Why it arises:**
"Dharmata" suggests philosophy. "Bindu" implies technical term. Intellectual habit: understand concept. The practitioner thinks about dharmata bindu.

**Primary consequence:**
Dharmata-intellectualization: treating bindu as concept. Natural bindu is replaced by philosophical position.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I understand the dharmata bindu concept"
- Missing that dharmata bindu is immediate
- Thinking-over-being

**Cascade effects:**
<chos-nyid-thig-le-dharmata-bindu-philosophicalization> → <dharmata-intellectualization> [conceptual understanding] → <philosophical-pride> [understanding bindu] → <immediate-bindu-miss> [thinking over nature]

[31287-31289] <bras-bu-thig-le-result-bindu-future-fixation> <result-sphere-achievement>

**Misreading:**
The "result bindu" (*bras bu'i thig le*) interpreted as final achievement to attain, creating result-bindu-fixation.

**Why it arises:**
"Result" suggests goal. "Bindu" implies prize. Teleological mindset: reach the result. The practitioner seeks result-bindu.

**Primary consequence:**
Result-fixation: treating bindu as future attainment. Natural ever-present bindu is obscured by goal-orientation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "When I achieve the result bindu..."
- Future-orientation over present recognition
- Missing that result is now

**Cascade effects:**
<bras-bu-thig-le-result-bindu-future-fixation> → <result-fixation> [future goal] → <goal-orientation> [seeking result] → <ever-present-miss> [future over now]

[31290-31295] <thig-le-mtshan-nyid-bindu-characteristics-obsession> <bindu-quality-fixation>

**Misreading:**
The characteristics of bindu (*thig le'i mtshan nyid*)—without suffering, round, without elaboration, etc.—interpreted as qualities to identify, creating bindu-characteristic-obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Characteristics" suggests features. "Without suffering" implies quality. Identification-mind: spot the qualities. The practitioner identifies characteristics.

**Primary consequence:**
Characteristic-obsession: treating qualities as checklist. Natural bindu is obscured by feature-identification.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Does my bindu have all five characteristics?"
- Missing that characteristics describe nature, not features
- Quality-checklist over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<thig-le-mtshan-nyid-bindu-characteristics-obsession> → <characteristic-obsession> [quality checklist] → <feature-identification> [spotting qualities] → <nature-description-miss> [features over nature]

[31296-31300] <thig-le-klong-bindu-expanse-reification> <bindu-vastness-container>

**Misreading:**
The "bindu becoming expanse" (*thig le klong du gyur pa) interpreted as bindu expanding into vast container, creating expanse-reification.

**Why it arises:**
"Expanse" suggests space. "Becoming" implies transformation. Container-mind: bindu enters space. The practitioner visualizes expansion.

**Primary consequence:**
Expanse-reification: treating klong as container. Natural expanse is obscured by spatial-fantasy.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "The bindu expands into the expanse"
- Missing that klong indicates openness, not space
- Spatial-fantasy over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<thig-le-klong-bindu-expanse-reification> → <expanse-reification> [container fixation] → <spatial-fantasy> [bindu in space] → <openness-miss> [container over nature]

[31301-31305] <phyi-rtags-nges-pa-outer-signs-certainty-dependence> <outer-signs-validation>

**Misreading:**
The "certain outer signs" (*phyi'i rtags nges pa) interpreted as external confirmations of progress, creating sign-validation-dependence.

**Why it arises:**
"Signs" suggests proof. "Outer" implies external. Validation-seeking: need confirmation. The practitioner waits for signs.

**Primary consequence:**
Sign-dependence: treating external marks as validation. Natural certainty is obscured by external-seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I haven't seen the outer signs yet"
- Missing that signs indicate recognition, not cause it
- External-validation over self-recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<phyi-rtags-nges-pa-outer-signs-certainty-dependence> → <sign-dependence> [external validation] → <confirmation-waiting> [awaiting signs] → <self-certainty-miss> [external over internal]

[31306-31309] <thig-le-stong-sgron-bindu-empty-lamp-fixation> <bindu-lamp-visualization>

**Misreading:**
The "bindu empty lamp" (*thig le stong pa'i sgron ma) interpreted as specific lamp-visualization target, creating bindu-lamp-fixation.

**Why it arises:**
"Lamp" suggests object. "Empty" implies quality. Visualization-mind: see the lamp. The practitioner visualizes bindu-lamp.

**Primary consequence:**
Bindu-lamp-fixation: treating metaphor as visualization object. Natural clarity is obscured by lamp-chasing.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to visualize the empty bindu lamp"
- Missing that lamp indicates self-clarity
- Object-chasing over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<thig-le-stong-sgron-bindu-empty-lamp-fixation> → <bindu-lamp-fixation> [object visualization] → <lamp-chasing> [seeking light] → <self-clarity-miss> [object over nature]

[31310-31314] <gzhan-la-blo-skad-cig-other-mind-instant-externalization> <other-awareness-externalization>

**Misreading:**
The "mind not entering others for an instant" (*gzhan la blo skad cig kyang 'jug par mi 'gyur) interpreted as special mind-state that doesn't connect with others, creating isolation-pride.

**Why it arises:**
"Not entering others" suggests separation. "Instant" implies brief time. Isolation-pride: special detachment. The practitioner prides in disconnection.

**Primary consequence:**
Isolation-pride: treating non-connection as achievement. Natural compassion is obscured by disconnection-pride.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My mind never enters others"
- Spiritual isolationism
- Missing that non-entering indicates non-dual, not separation

**Cascade effects:**
<gzhan-la-blo-skad-cig-other-mind-instant-externalization> → <isolation-pride> [disconnection achievement] → <spiritual-isolationism> [not connecting] → <compassion-miss> [pride over connection]

[31315-31325] <rtags-ldan-dper-na-signs-possessing-example-hope> <sign-possession-expectation>

**Misreading:**
The "one possessing signs, for example" (*rtags dang ldan pa dper na) interpreted as person who has achieved signs, creating sign-possession-hope.

**Why it arises:**
"Possessing signs" suggests achievement. "Example" implies model. Hope: I can possess signs too. The practitioner hopes for signs.

**Primary consequence:**
Sign-possession-hope: treating signs as acquisitions. Natural signs are obscured by possession-desire.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "When will I possess the signs?"
- Missing that signs are natural indications
- Acquisition-hope over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<rtags-ldan-dper-na-signs-possessing-example-hope> → <sign-possession-hope> [acquisition desire] → <possession-anxiety> [wanting signs] → <natural-indication-miss> [hope over nature]
