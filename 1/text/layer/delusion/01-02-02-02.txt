[1463-1473] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The lifespan increases (20 years for abandoning killing up to 80,000 years for abandoning wrong dharma practice) interpreted as a transactional moral economy—virtue deposits yield longevity dividends in a cosmic accounting system.

**Why it arises:**
The arithmetic progression (20, 40, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 10,000, 20,000, 40,000, 80,000) suggests calculable returns. The systematic increase feels rational and fair. "Abandon X, gain Y" resembles behavioral conditioning.

**Primary consequence:**
Morality congeals into investment strategy. Practitioners calculate "virtue returns" and optimize abandonment for maximum lifespan. The intrinsic value of ethical conduct is displaced by instrumental calculation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ethical decision-making reduced to longevity-actuarial analysis. Present recognition sacrificed for future rewards. Spiritual materialism of "merit accumulation" dominates.

**Cascade effects:**
<moral-calculism> → <virtue-accounting> → <future-obsession> → <present-neglect>

[1463] <eternalistic-error>

**Misreading:**
Long lifespan presented as desirable fruit of virtue interpreted as confirmation that long life is the goal—one should practice to live as long as possible.

**Why it arises:**
Death anxiety makes longevity attractive. Long life seems like reward. The alternative (short life as result of non-virtue) appears as punishment to avoid.

**Primary consequence:**
Dharma practice hijacked by longevity-seeking. Recognition of deathless nature displaced by desire for extended existence. The very impermanence that makes recognition urgent is denied.

**Secondary consequences:**
Health practices mistaken for Dharma. Death meditation abandoned as "negative." The preciousness of human life reduced to duration rather than opportunity.

**Cascade effects:**
<eternalistic-error> → <death-denial> → <longevity-fixation> → <practice-corruption>

[1474-1475] <reification-error>

**Misreading:**
"Longevity, beauty, and enjoyment increase" interpreted as prosperity gospel—virtue leads to material success, beauty, and pleasure in this life.

**Why it arises:**
"Enjoyment" (*longs spyod*) suggests sensory pleasure. "Beauty" (*gzugs*) implies physical attractiveness. The prosperity theology model is culturally prevalent.

**Primary consequence:**
Dharma reduced to self-help for worldly success. Practitioners expect wealth and beauty as spiritual rewards. Recognition displaced by material optimization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Poor practitioners feel spiritually inadequate. Rich practitioners confuse wealth with virtue. The renunciation aspect of path is rejected.

**Cascade effects:**
<reification-error> → <prosperity-obsession> → <worldly-attachment> → <renunciation-rejection>

[1476-1477] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The kalpa calculations (18 intermediate kalpas of decrease/increase) interpreted as essential cosmological knowledge establishing precise timeline of cosmic cycles.

**Why it arises:**
Numbers create sense of precision and understanding. "18" appears significant. The systematic alternation of increase/decrease suggests discoverable pattern.

**Primary consequence:**
Time petrifies into mathematical structure. Recognition confused with understanding temporal mechanics. Practice congeals into calculation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners memorize kalpa systems. Dharma study focuses on chronology. Present awareness displaced by temporal abstractions.

**Cascade effects:**
<temporal-mathematics> → <kalpa-fetishism> → <present-abandonment> → <cosmological-intellectualism>

[1478-1479] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The "long-eon without culmination" (*ma thog ring mo*) and kalpa terminology interpreted as stages of spiritual development—the longer the kalpa, the more advanced the practitioner.

**Why it arises:**
"Long" suggests duration equals depth. The hierarchy of kalpa-names implies progression. Practitioners want to know "how far along" they are.

**Primary consequence:**
Temporal duration confused with spiritual maturity. Practitioners believe they've been practicing "for kalpas." The timeless nature of recognition historicizes.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual seniority based on claimed kalpa-count. Beginners feel inadequate. The immediate availability of recognition is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
<progression-mysticism> → <kalpa-identification> → <seniority-hierarchy> → <immediate-recognition-loss>

[1480-1495] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The appearance of "merit-light" (*bsod nams kyi snang ba*) producing Buddha, Dharma, Sangha interpreted as merit being a substance that generates spiritual commodities.

**Why it arises:**
"Light" suggests radiant substance. "Produces" implies causal generation. Merit as commodity is familiar concept in Buddhist cultures.

**Primary consequence:**
Merit petrifies into spiritual currency. Buddha, Dharma, Sangha become merit-products. Recognition reduced to merit-consumption.

**Secondary consequences:**
Merit-trading economies develop. Practitioners calculate merit-balances. Generosity congeals into merit-investment. The emptiness of all phenomena is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
<merit-substantialism> → <commodification> → <transactional-spirituality> → <emptiness-miss>

[1486-1495] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The appearance of suffering and wrong paths from "non-merit" interpreted as establishing dualistic cosmos—merit produces good, non-merit produces evil, two opposing forces.

**Why it arises:**
The parallel structure (merit-light vs. non-merit) suggests opposition. Good vs. evil is culturally prevalent framework. The symmetry implies cosmic balance.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen non-duality solidifies as moral dualism. Practitioners see world as battle between merit and non-merit. Recognition of same-taste is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
Moral judgment replaces wisdom. Practitioners avoid "non-merit people." Suffering is seen as punishment rather than call to recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<dualistic-manifestation> → <moral-dualism> → <judgment-obsession> → <same-taste-miss>

[1496-1530] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The seven suns burning everything, seven floods dissolving to salt water, wind scattering all—interpreted as literal future catastrophe to fear and prepare for.

**Why it arises:**
Seven suns sounds scientifically plausible (heat death). Sequential destruction follows physical logic. "Seven times" suggests repeatable cosmic disaster.

**Primary consequence:**
Impermanence teaching is displaced by apocalypse anxiety. Practice motivated by disaster-avoidance. Recognition obscured by survival-preoccupation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners obsess over destruction-timelines. Dharma congeals into survival-preparation. Present recognition displaced by end-times worry.

**Cascade effects:**
<apocalyptic-literalism> → <destruction-fear> → <survival-spirituality> → <present-neglect>

[1514-1524] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The seven suns progressively burning rivers, oceans, mountains, Meru interpreted as meditation instruction—visualize fire consuming everything.

**Why it arises:**
Progressive destruction invites visualization. Fire is powerful meditation object. The systematic burning suggests structured practice.

**Primary consequence:**
Cosmological description reduced to fire-visualization technique. Practitioners cultivate aggressive fire-imagery. The pedagogical point (impermanence) is replaced by technique.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fire-meditation obsession. Aggressive visualization practices. The gentle recognition of impermanence replaced by violent imagery.

**Cascade effects:**
<pyromania-spirituality> → <fire-obsession> → <aggressive-visualization> → <gentle-recognition-loss>

[1525-1530] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The sequence of destruction by fire, water, wind interpreted as revealing elemental hierarchy—fire destroyed by water, water by wind, establishing element-superiority.

**Why it arises:**
Sequential destruction suggests hierarchy. Elements conquering elements implies power-ranking. The final wind-victory suggests wind-supremacy.

**Primary consequence:**
Elemental hierarchies are constructed. Practitioners favor "superior" elements. The empty nature of all elements is missed in elemental competition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Wind-meditation privileged as "highest." Elemental practices become hierarchical. The equal emptiness of all elements is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
<elemental-destruction-fetish> → <hierarchy-construction> → <elemental-elitism> → <emptiness-miss>

[1531-1538] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The detailed kalpa mathematics (80 small kalpas = 1 great kalpa, etc.) interpreted as Buddhist cosmological science—precise temporal mechanics to master.

**Why it arises:**
Mathematical precision suggests scientific accuracy. The symmetrical numbers (80, 180) imply cosmic order. "Great kalpa" sounds like technical term.

**Primary consequence:**
Time is mathematized as cosmological structure. Recognition confused with temporal understanding. Practice congeals into calculation.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners memorize kalpa-systems. Cosmology studied as physics. Present awareness displaced by temporal abstractions.

**Cascade effects:**
<kalpa-quantification> → <scientism> → <abstraction-obsession> → <present-loss>

[1531] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
"Great kalpa" (*bskal pa chen po*) interpreted as referring to immense duration that makes human life insignificant—practitioners feel small and cosmically insignificant.

**Why it arises:**
"Great" suggests scale beyond human. The numbers (80, 180) are incomprehensibly large. Cosmic time makes human time seem trivial.

**Primary consequence:**
Temporal vastness produces spiritual inadequacy. Practitioners feel their practice is "just a drop in the kalpa-ocean." The immediate perfection is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners defer recognition to "future kalpas." Present life seen as preparation. The timeless nature of ground is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<temporal-grandiosity> → <inadequacy-complex> → <future-deferral> → <present-recognition-loss>

[1532-1538] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The cycles of formation, duration, destruction, and emptiness interpreted as determinism—beings are trapped in endless cosmic cycling without escape.

**Why it arises:**
The four phases repeat eternally. "Endless cycling" sounds like samsara. The lack of mention of liberation suggests hopelessness.

**Primary consequence:**
Cosmological cycles are reified as inescapable prison. Practitioners feel trapped in kalpa-machinery. Recognition of liberation outside time is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Fatalistic acceptance of cycling. Liberation deferred to "between kalpas." Practice congeals into endurance rather than recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<cycle-determinism> → <fatalism> → <endurance-mentality> → <liberation-deferral>

[1532-1538] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The four aspects of cyclic existence (birth, aging, sickness, death) interpreted as establishing the substantial continuity of samsara—a real continuum that must be transcended.

**Why it arises:**
The four are presented as definitive. "Cyclic existence" (*srid pa*) suggests ongoing entity. implies samsara's reality.

**Primary consequence:**
Samsara solidifies as real continuum. Practitioners attempt to "escape" a substantial prison. The illusory nature of cycling is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Escape-mentality dominates. Practitioners reject samsara rather than recognize its nature. The non-dual identity of samsara and nirvana is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<birth-death-continuity> → <samsara-reification> → <escape-obsession> → <non-duality-miss>

[1539-1542] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The gradual lifespan decrease to 10 years interpreted as pessimistic vision of human degeneration—we are in declining age of darkness.

**Why it arises:**
Declining numbers suggest deterioration. "10 years" sounds like dystopian future. Present age seems degraded compared to past.

**Primary consequence:**
Pessimistic view of current era. Practitioners feel born in wrong time. Recognition made contingent on "better era."

**Secondary consequences:**
Golden-age nostalgia. Present conditions rejected. Practice lacks urgency because "too degenerate to succeed."

**Cascade effects:**
<age-deterioration-anxiety> → <temporal-pessimism> → <present-rejection> → <urgency-loss>

[1541-1542] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The three small calamities (disease, weapons, famine) interpreted as predictions to watch for—practitioners should prepare for and survive these disasters.

**Why it arises:**
"Calamity" (*bskal pa*) sounds apocalyptic. Threefold structure invites classification. Survival instincts activated.

**Primary consequence:**
Dharma practice congeals into disaster-preparedness. Practitioners stockpile supplies and skills. Recognition displaced by survival-anxiety.

**Secondary consequences:**
Survivalist mentality in Dharma communities. Present practice neglected for future preparation. The deathless nature ignored.

**Cascade effects:**
<calamity-obsession> → <survivalism> → <present-neglect> → <deathless-miss>

Lines 1463-1542 present the detailed cosmology of virtue-results, kalpa cycles, and world destruction. This continues into subsequent sections where these cosmological frameworks will be applied to specific realms and conditions.
