<epistemic-error> [RECOGNITION AS EVENT]
**Misreading:**
Recognition (ngo shes pa) is a special event, insight, or experience that happens in time.

**Why it arises:**
"Recognition" suggests cognitive achievement.

**Primary consequence:**
Waiting for recognition to "happen."

**Secondary consequences:**
Disappointment that it's "just this."

**Cascade effects:**
<meditationism-error> → <waiting-syndrome> (future-event) → <experience-seeking> (special-moment) → <recognition-prevention> (event substitutes for nature).

<trekcho-completion-achievement> <khregs-chod-mastery-quest>

**Misreading:**
Trekcho (khregs chod), cutting through, is a preliminary practice to complete before advancing to thogal (thod rgal). One must master cutting-through through sustained practice to qualify for leap-over teachings.

**Why it arises:**
Pedagogical structure suggests progression. "Cutting through" sounds like method. Desire for advanced teachings. Elitism around thogal secrecy.

**Primary consequence:**
Trekcho congeals into obstacle course. Practitioners obsess over "completing" cutting-through, measuring progress, comparing themselves to "advanced" thogal practitioners—when trekcho is recognition itself.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Creating trekcho/thogal hierarchy
- Measuring "readiness" for thogal
- Believing one must "finish" trekcho first
- Missing that khregs chod is instantaneous recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-completion-achievement> → <progress-measurement> (cutting-through-levels) → <thogal-sequential-waiting> (waiting-for-visions) → <recognition-prevention> (sequence substitutes for immediacy).

<light-phenomena-attachment> <thod-rgal-snang-ba-grasping>

**Misreading:**
Thogal visions (thod rgal gyi snang ba)—circles of light (thig le), Buddha-forms (rigs lnga), six limits (mtha' drug)—are attainments to achieve through practice, indicating progress and realization level.

**Why it arises:**
Vision descriptions are vivid. "Attainment" language pervades Buddhism. Tangible results appeal to goal-mind. Comparison with others' experiences.

**Primary consequence:**
Thogal congeals into vision-chasing. Practitioners practice specifically to see lights/forms, believing these indicate realization, grasping at rang snang (self-display) as objective achievement.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety about not seeing visions
- Pride in vision-experiences
- Believing lights = realization
- Missing that visions are natural display, not goal

**Cascade effects:**
<light-phenomena-attachment> → <phenomena-grasping> (light-forms) → <experience-validation> (needing-visions) → <recognition-prevention> (appearances substitute for essence).
