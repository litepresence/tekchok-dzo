**Misreading:**
The four activities (pacifying, enriching, power, fierce) are actual practices or rituals that can be performed to achieve specific results—like ritual technologies for accomplishing goals (removing obstacles, gaining wealth, achieving power, destroying enemies).

**Why it arises:**
"Activities" (phrin las, karman) suggests purposeful action. Vajrayāna is rich with ritual systems for the four activities (śāntika, pauṣṭika, vaśīkaraṇa, māraṇa). The color associations (white, yellow, red, green) and similes (crystal, jewel, gold, wind) suggest ritual correspondences.

**Primary consequence:**
The activities become methods to employ. Practitioners perform rituals to "pacify" obstacles or "enrich" qualities, missing that the text describes awareness's spontaneous modalities, not techniques. Dzogchen solidifies as ritualism.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Performing elaborate rituals for the four activities
- Believing one must "master" each activity type
- Using activities as spiritual technology for worldly goals
- Missing that activities are awareness's natural expression, not deliberate actions

**Cascade effects:**
<pedagogical-error> → <ritual-technology> (using activities as methods) → <goal-orientation> (seeking results through activities) → <recognition-prevention> (effort substitutes for spontaneity).

[COMPLETE SECTION NOTE]

This section (02-16-04-01.txt) presents the four enlightened activities (phrin las bzhi)—pacifying (zhi ba), enriching (rgyas pa), power (dbang), and fierce (drag po). While brief, error-potential exists because:

1. **Ritual association** with Vajrayāna four-activity systems
2. **Color correspondences** inviting ritual implementation
3. **Functional language** suggesting purposeful techniques

The delusion analysis must emphasize: these are not ritual categories to employ but descriptions of awareness's spontaneous activity—naturally pacifying, enriching, powerful, and fierce without any deliberate performance.

SILENCE CHECK: No additional high-risk misinterpretation detected in this brief transitional section beyond the primary risk of ritual technification.
