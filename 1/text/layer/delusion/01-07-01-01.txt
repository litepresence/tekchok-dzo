[9704-9713] <commitment-fetish> <samaya-legalism>

**Misreading:**
Samaya interpreted as binding legal contract—commitments that, once taken, create enforceable obligations with penalties for breach, like spiritual law.

**Why it arises:**
"Binding" suggests legal obligation. "Pledge" implies contract. Fear of consequences drives compliance-mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Samaya substantialized as legal framework. Recognition displaced by obligation-anxiety. The naturally pure nature is obscured by contractual thinking.

**Secondary consequences:**
Guilt over samaya-breaking. Legalistic interpretation of tantra. Relationship with teacher congeals into contractual.

**Cascade effects:**
<commitment-fetish> → <legalism> → <guilt-accumulation> → <natural-purity-miss>

[9704-9707] <vajra-cross-literalization> <obstacle-course-spirituality>

**Misreading:**
"Vajra cross, difficult to traverse" interpreted as obstacle course—samaya as series of difficult trials one must navigate to succeed.

**Why it arises:**
"Difficult to traverse" suggests challenge. "Cross" implies intersection of difficulties. Achievement mentality loves obstacles.

**Primary consequence:**
Samaya reduced to obstacle-navigation. Recognition displaced by challenge-overcoming. The effortless nature is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pride in "difficult" samaya. Comparison of "who has harder commitments." The simple recognition is lost in complexity.

**Cascade effects:**
<vajra-cross-literalization> → <obstacle-course> → <achievement-pride> → <effortless-miss>

[9708-9713] <mind-promise-fetish> <samaya-as-mental-contract>

**Misreading:**
"Mind itself, unbroken, free from deception" interpreted as establishing mental promise as samaya—keeping one's word as primary commitment.

**Why it arises:**
"Unbroken" suggests promise-keeping. "Free from deception" implies honesty. Ethical values support promise-keeping.

**Primary consequence:**
Samaya reduced to promise-keeping ethics. Recognition displaced by moral obligation. The view-transcending nature is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Anxiety about "breaking promises." Moral perfectionism. The recognition beyond ethics is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<mind-promise-fetish> → <mental-contract> → <promise-anxiety> → <view-transcendence-miss>

[9714-9723] <root-branch-hierarchy> <samaya-tree-metaphor>

**Misreading:**
Root (body-speech-mind) and branch (twenty-five) samayas interpreted as hierarchical tree—root essential, branches optional, creating prioritization.

**Why it arises:**
Tree metaphor suggests hierarchy. "Root" implies essential. "Branch" suggests optional.

**Primary consequence:**
Samayas ranked by importance. Root-samaya obsession, branch-neglect. The completeness of all samayas is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Essential vs optional" thinking. Selective samaya-keeping. The undivided nature is fragmented.

**Cascade effects:**
<root-branch-hierarchy> → <samaya-prioritization> → <selective-keeping> → <completeness-miss>

[9714-9716] <body-speech-mind-triplicity> <threefold-obsession>

**Misreading:**
Body-speech-mind root samayas interpreted as three distinct domains of commitment—each gate requiring separate set of rules.

**Why it arises:**
Three gates classification is familiar. Specificity suggests comprehensiveness. Categories feel manageable.

**Primary consequence:**
Samaya fragmented by gates. Body-samaya, speech-samaya, mind-samaya treated separately. The unified nature is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Gate-specific anxiety. "Which samaya did I break?" analysis. The singular view is lost in triplicity.

**Cascade effects:**
<body-speech-mind-triplicity> → <threefold-obsession> → <gate-anxiety> → <unified-nature-miss>

[9717-9723] <twenty-five-catalog> <samaya-accumulation>

**Misreading:**
Twenty-five branch samayas interpreted as catalog to complete—checklist of commitments to accumulate and maintain.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration suggests list. Twenty-five is specific number. Completeness drives accumulation.

**Primary consequence:**
Samaya reduced to checklist. Recognition displaced by inventory-management. The essence is lost in enumeration.

**Secondary consequences:**
"How many samayas kept?" counting. Anxiety about missing items. The single commitment is fragmented.

**Cascade effects:**

[9719-9722] <acceptance-obligation> <blang-dor-reification>

**Misreading:**
"To accept, not to abandon, to practice, to accomplish" interpreted as fourfold obligation binding system—must accept all, abandon none, practice perfectly, accomplish completely.

**Why it arises:**
Fourfold structure suggests system. Obligation language implies binding. Perfectionism drives complete fulfillment.

**Primary consequence:**
Samaya substantialized as fourfold burden. Recognition displaced by obligation-management. The natural commitment is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Overwhelming obligation-sense. Inadequacy about "not accomplishing." The effortless commitment is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<acceptance-obligation> → <fourfold-burden> → <obligation-overwhelm> → <effortless-miss>

[9724-9741] <sevenfold-classification> <samaya-taxonomy>

**Misreading:**
Sevenfold samaya classification (view, conduct, practice, common, body-speech-mind, branches, crucial) interpreted as comprehensive taxonomy—must understand all categories to keep samaya properly.

**Why it arises:**
Sevenfold structure suggests completeness. Taxonomy implies systematic understanding. Classification feels organized.

**Primary consequence:**
Samaya reduced to classification-study. Recognition displaced by category-mastery. The simple commitment is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Taxonomy-obsession. "Which category?" analysis. The undivided view is lost in classification.

**Cascade effects:**
<sevenfold-classification> → <samaya-taxonomy> → <category-obsession> → <simplicity-miss>

[9731-9744] <hundred-thousand-terror> <samaya-quantity-anxiety>

**Misreading:**
"Hundred-thousand-fold spoken samayas" interpreted literally as 100,000 distinct commitments—impossible burden creating terror.

**Why it arises:**

**Primary consequence:**
Samaya substantialized as impossible quantity. Recognition displaced by quantity-anxiety. The manageable essence is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Overwhelm and despair. "Can never keep all" resignation. The single samaya is lost in multitude.

**Cascade effects:**

[9745-9753] <teacher-dependence> <guru-samaya-fetish>

**Misreading:**
Teacher as "cause of protection" interpreted as establishing guru-dependence—student protected only through teacher, creating unhealthy reliance.

"Protection" suggests vulnerability. "Cause" implies dependency. Guru devotion traditions emphasize reliance.

**Primary consequence:**
Teacher substantialized as protection-source. Recognition made teacher-dependent. The self-sufficient nature is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Guru-dependence. Inability to recognize without teacher present. The naturally liberated is lost in other-dependence.

**Cascade effects:**

[9754-9764] <vajra-sibling-hierarchy> <spiritual-family-elitism>

**Misreading:**
Four types of vajra siblings (general, close, mixed, extremely mixed) interpreted as spiritual family hierarchy—closest siblings have highest status.

**Why it arises:**
Classification suggests ranking. "Extremely" implies superlative. Family closeness correlates with status.

**Primary consequence:**
Vajra siblings ranked by closeness. "Extremely mixed" elitism. The equality of all connections is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Status-competition among siblings. Exclusion of "general" siblings. The undivided sangha is fragmented.

**Cascade effects:**
<vajra-sibling-hierarchy> → <spiritual-elitism> → <status-competition> → <equality-miss>

[9760-9764] <empowerment-sibling-magic> <initiation-bond-fetish>

**Misreading:**
"Single empowerment at one time, in one mandala" creating "extremely mixed siblings" interpreted as magical bond—simultaneous initiation produces special connection.

**Why it arises:**
"One time, one mandala" suggests ritual simultaneity. "Extremely" implies special power. Shared ritual produces bonds.

**Primary consequence:**
Empowerment substantialized as magical bonding. Recognition of connection made ritual-dependent. The natural connection is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Ritual-bond obsession. "Who got empowerment with me?" tracking. The always-connected nature is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<empowerment-sibling-magic> → <initiation-fetish> → <ritual-dependence> → <natural-connection-miss>

[9762-9764] <mandala-mixing-mystery> <single-vase-obsession>

**Misreading:**
"One mandala, one lamp, one vase" interpreted as requiring literal single objects—insisting all participants must share exact same physical implements.

**Why it arises:**
"One" suggests singularity. Physical objects seem concrete. Sharing produces unity.

**Primary consequence:**
Mandala substantialized as physical object. Recognition made object-dependent. The non-objectified nature is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Object-obsession. "Was it the same vase?" anxiety. The object-free recognition is lost.

**Cascade effects:**

[9765-9773] <teacher-typology-obsession> <four-guru-catalog>

**Misreading:**
Four teacher types (general, drawing, empowerment, instruction) interpreted as catalog for guru-shopping—seek different teachers for different needs.

**Why it arises:**
Four types suggest specialization. "Empowerment teacher" implies function-specific. Consumer mentality loves options.

**Primary consequence:**
Teachers reduced to functional types. Recognition fragmented by teacher-category. The single teacher-essence is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Guru-collecting. "I need an instruction-teacher now." The one-pointed relationship is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<teacher-typology-obsession> → <guru-shopping> → <functional-fragmentation> → <single-point-miss>

[9774-9785] <teacher-definition-literalism> <dpon-slob-reification>

**Misreading:**
Etymological definition of teacher-student (liberating through knowing, vessel for instruction) interpreted as literal requirements—must have these exact qualities to be valid teacher/student.

**Why it arises:**
Etymology suggests essence. Definition implies criteria. Literalism seeks certainty.

**Primary consequence:**
Relationship substantialized by definition. Recognition made definition-dependent. The undefinable connection is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Definition-checking. "Do you meet the definition?" testing. The definition-transcending is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<definition-literalism> → <criteria-checking> → <definition-testing> → <essence-miss>

[9786-9796] <benefit-accumulation> <samaya-reward-mentality>

**Misreading:**
Benefits of keeping samaya interpreted as reward system—good behavior earns spiritual benefits, like merit-account.

**Why it arises:**
"Benefit" suggests reward. "Reach culmination" implies achievement. Reward-punishment psychology.

**Primary consequence:**
Samaya reduced to transactional benefit-gain. Recognition displaced by reward-seeking. The non-transactional nature is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
"What do I get?" mentality. Benefit-comparison. The benefit-less recognition is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<benefit-accumulation> → <reward-mentality> → <transactional-spirituality> → <non-transactional-miss>

[9792-9796] <blessing-dependence> <byin-rlabs-fetish>

**Misreading:**
"Sons and siblings are blessed in intention" interpreted as establishing blessing-power—samaya keeping attracts special blessings from superiors.

**Why it arises:**

[9800-9803] <teacher-decline-panic> <dpon-nyams-terror>

**Misreading:**
"If teacher declines, without purification method" interpreted as establishing that teacher-samaya-breaking is unpardonable—worse than any other breach.

**Why it arises:**
"Teacher" is authority figure. "Without purification" suggests hopelessness. Gurus emphasized in Vajrayana.

**Primary consequence:**
Teacher-samaya fetishized as supreme. Recognition displaced by guru-terror. The equal nature of all samayas is obscured.
