<five-buddha-families-ontologization> <rigs-lnga-dngos-po>

**Misreading:**
Five Buddha families (*rigs lnga*)—Tathagata, Vajra, Ratna, Padma, Karma—interpreted as establishing five actual deities—distinct enlightened beings with personalities, realms, and powers.

**Why it arises:**
"Five" suggests multiplicity. Families imply entities. Deity-names trigger personification. Pantheon-comfortable.
