**Misreading:**
"Looking from inside, outside clear; looking from outside, inside clear" interpreted as describing actual visual capacity—seeing through things, X-ray vision.

**Why it arises:**
"Inside" (*nang*), "outside" (*phyi*), "looking" (*bltas*), "clear" (*gsal*) suggest vision. The phrases describe unusual seeing. Paranormal abilities fascinate.

**Primary consequence:**
The non-duality of appearance-emptiness solidifies as supernatural sight. The actual meaning—non-obstruction of awareness—is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek clairvoyance. Meditation aims for penetrating vision. The natural clarity is obscured.

Page 11 continues the thirty-six activities enumeration from Page 10, completing the "secret four" and beginning body/speech/mind activities. Lines 326-335 complete the body activities.

Line 336 begins speech activities which continue onto Page 12.

**Misreading:**
The five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) interpreted as five things to acquire or possess—cognitive achievements or mental powers.

**Why it arises:**
"Five" suggests list. "Wisdoms" (*ye shes*) suggests knowledge. lists them (mirror-like, equality, etc.). Achievement frameworks use checklists.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom is commodified into possession. Practitioners try to "get" five wisdoms. The naturally present awareness is forgotten.

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation aims at wisdom accumulation. Teachers sell "wisdom transmission." Recognition is replaced by acquisition.

**Misreading:**
The samadhis (*ting nge 'dzin*)—non-composing, pure vision, pure dharmata, exhaustion of outflows—interpreted as meditative states to achieve through effort.

**Why it arises:**
"Samadhi" commonly means "concentration." "Achieving" (*mdzad*) suggests accomplishment. Buddhist practice includes samadhi cultivation.

**Primary consequence:**
Natural stability inverts into technique. Practitioners try to "do" samadhi. Effortless recognition is replaced by effort.

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation congeals into struggle for concentration. Teachers judge students by samadhi depth. Simple awareness is overlooked.

**Misreading:**
"Exhaustion of outflows" (*zag pa zad pa*) interpreted as cleansing impurities—removing defilements, purifying contaminants.

**Why it arises:**
"Exhaustion" (*zad pa*) suggests depletion. "Outflows" (*zag pa*) suggests contamination. Purification frameworks dominate spirituality.

**Primary consequence:**
Awakening solidifies as cleaning process. Practitioners focus on removing impurities. The already-pure nature is forgotten.

**Secondary consequences:**
Endless purification practices develop. Self-purification congeals into obsession. Recognition is replaced by cleansing.

**Cascade effects:**

<contamination-anxiety> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

**Misreading:**
"Mirror-like wisdom enjoying examples" (*me long lta bu'i ye shes kyis dpe la longs spyod pa*) interpreted as wisdom using examples to understand meaning—cognitive process of learning from illustrations.

**Why it arises:**
"Example" (*dpe*) and "meaning" (*don*) suggest pedagogical relationship. "Enjoying" (*longs spyod*) suggests consumption. Learning uses examples.

**Primary consequence:**
The non-dual display is divided into example and meaning. Wisdom congeals into cognitive faculty using illustrations.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek "correct examples." Meditation uses visualizations as examples. Direct recognition is mediated.

**Cascade effects:**

<cognitive-mediation> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

**Misreading:**
"Abiding as emptiness-clarity non-dual" (*gsal stong dbyer med du bzhugs pa*) interpreted as describing a special state where emptiness and clarity are fused together—like mixing two ingredients.

**Why it arises:**
"Non-dual" (*dbyer med*) negates duality but affirms something. "Emptiness" (*stong*) and "clarity" (*gsal*) sound like two things. Fusion suggests combination.

**Primary consequence:**
Non-duality petrifies into "state of fusion." The inseparability petrifies into special condition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners try to "unite" emptiness and clarity. Meditation seeks fusion experience. Natural inseparability is obscured.

**Cascade effects:**
<fusion-seeking> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<non-dual-substantialism> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result
<combination-obsession> → error-propagates → downstream-effects → final-result

Page 12 continues from Page 11's speech activities, moving to mind activities and five wisdoms enumeration. Lines 351-355 describe mind's outer four activities. Lines 356-365 describe inner and secret four.

The page continues the thirty-six activities framework, shifting from body to speech to mind.
