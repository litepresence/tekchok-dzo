<practice-error> [NON-MEDITATION AS NOT PRACTICING]
**Misreading:**
"Non-meditation" means one should not practice or make any effort at all.

**Why it arises:**
Literal interpretation of "non." Anti-effort romanticism.

**Primary consequence:**
Laziness justified as Dzogchen practice.

**Secondary consequences:**
No actual recognition; ordinary distraction.

**Cascade effects:**
<practice-error> → <non-meditation-misconception> (literal-non) → <laziness-justification> (inaction-as-practice) → <recognition-prevention> (passivity substitutes for recognition).

<thogal-sequential-waiting> <khregs-chod-thod-rgal-progression>

**Misreading:**
Trekcho (khregs chod) and thogal (thod rgal) represent sequential stages of Dzogchen practice—one must complete cutting-through before being introduced to leap-over visions.

**Why it arises:**
Two-phase pedagogy suggests order. "Cutting through" sounds preliminary. Thogal visions appear advanced. Teacher-student hierarchy.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen congeals into staged curriculum. Practitioners obsess over "finishing" trekcho to qualify for thogal, missing that both are aspects of same recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Creating trekcho/thogal hierarchy
- Measuring "readiness" for visions
- Believing one must "earn" thogal
- Missing simultaneity of approaches

**Cascade effects:**
<thogal-sequential-waiting> → <staged-curriculum> (phase-obsession) → <qualification-anxiety> (earning-advanced) → <recognition-prevention> (sequence substitutes for unity).

<light-phenomena-attachment> <thod-rgal-snang-ba-anticipation>

**Misreading:**
Thogal visions (snang ba)—light circles (thig le), five families (rigs lnga), six limits (mtha' drug)—will definitely appear with sufficient practice, indicating successful thogal.

**Why it arises:**
Vision descriptions are vivid and inspiring. "Results" language. Tangible proof appeal. Comparison with reported experiences.

**Primary consequence:**
Thogal congeals into vision-expectation. Practitioners practice while waiting for specific phenomena, creating grasping at appearance and disappointment when visions don't match expectations.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Anxiety when "nothing happens"
- Comparing with others' vision reports
- Believing practice failed without visions
- Missing that thogal is recognition, not visual effects

**Cascade effects:**
<light-phenomena-attachment> → <phenomena-dependency> (needing-visions) → <comparison-syndrome> (others-have-lights) → <recognition-prevention> (appearances substitute for essence).
