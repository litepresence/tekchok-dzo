[24278-24280] <trekcho-completion-achievement>

**Misreading:**
Reading "rang sa zin te" as having "achieved" Trekcho via coronation ceremony. Royal analogy triggers achievement psychology—practice congeals into stabilizing a possession.

**Why it arises:**
Coronation marks transition to rulership, suggesting Trekcho requires such transition moment.

**Primary consequence:**
Subtle grasping at view as possession; practice oriented toward "confirming" recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-completion-achievement> → <view-completion-pride> → <reification-error>

[24281-24282] <cloud-sky-confusion>

**Misreading:**
Interpreting "gzhi stongs pas" as consciousness "emptying into" ground, treating gzhi as container receiving contents.

**Why it arises:**
Military analogy suggests spatial framework—consciousnesses occupy ground.

**Primary consequence:**
Duality between "mind that perceives" and "ground of perception" under guise of non-duality.

**Cascade effects:**
<cloud-sky-confusion> → <formless-samadhi-addiction> → <nihilistic-error>

[24283-24286] <liberation-event>

**Misreading:**
Reading "rang dbang thob pa" as gaining autonomy—mind achieving independence from conditions.

**Why it arises:**
Captured-minister analogy evokes personal freedom narrative; Western autonomy psychology overlays dbang terminology.

**Primary consequence:**
Afflictive consciousnesses seen as obstacles to free from rather than self-liberated.

**Cascade effects:**
<liberation-event> → <psychologization-error> → <recognition-prevention>

[24287-24289] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Taking "ye nas de ltar gnas pa" as perfect primordial state requiring discovery; ka dag as ontological perfectionism.

**Why it arises:**
Bse shing fruit analogy suggests inherent potential actualizing; "ye nas" invites reading finished state awaiting recognition.

**Primary consequence:**
Devaluation of practice as "unnecessary"; nihilistic dismissal of relative path.

**Cascade effects:**
<ka-dag-purity-obsession> → <cause-effect-nihilism> → <pedagogical-error>

[24290-24308] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Reading "rang shar rang gnas rang grol" as prescribing "let whatever arises self-release" as technique.

**Why it arises:**
Western anti-structural spiritual impulses overlay "spontaneous" as virtue to cultivate.

**Primary consequence:**
Deliberate effort to "be spontaneous"—paradox of effort toward effortlessness.

**Cascade effects:**
<lhun-grub-spontaneity-romanticism> → <practice-error> → <pedagogical-error>

[24292-24295] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Taking "sku gsum rang la tshang bar rdzogs" as completing three kayas as attainment, treating trikaya as inventory of qualities.

**Why it arises:**
"Thob tu yod pa'i sems nyid" plus "rdzogs" parallels achievement language.

**Primary consequence:**
Trikaya as spiritual trophy rather than nature of awareness.

**Cascade effects:**
<three-kaya-reification> → <samadhi-emanation-materialism> → <eternalistic-error>

[24296-24299] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Interpreting "snying po yang gsang chen por rdzogs" as completing/reaching heart essence—arrival at destination.

**Why it arises:**
"Yang gsang chen po" triggers treasure-hunting psychology; "rdzogs" suggests progression.

**Primary consequence:**
Heart essence substantialized as hidden jewel; Dzogchen as esoteric attainment.

**Cascade effects:**
<recognition-achievement> → <pedagogical-error> → <ontological-error>

[24300-24307] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Reading "snang ba sna tshogs rang shar te" as confirming appearances as real display, missing emptiness.

**Why it arises:**
Detailed phenomenological listing invites naive realism.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen congeals into sophisticated realism rather than recognition of nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<appearances-reification> → <eternalistic-error> → <cloud-sky-confusion>

[24309-24319] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Taking "'khor 'das re dogs dang bral ba" as having transcended hope/fear, using as spiritual bypass.

**Why it arises:**
Western therapeutic "non-attachment" overlays Dzogchen freedom.

**Primary consequence:**
Genuine care dismissed as "hope and fear"; emotional engagement pathologized.

**Cascade effects:**
<hope-fear-denial> → <cause-effect-nihilism> → <pedagogical-error>

[24321-24323] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Reading "rang zhig rang grol" as afflictions automatically self-liberating without recognition.

**Why it arises:**
Snake-knot and water-wave analogies suggest natural self-resolution.

**Primary consequence:**
Passive indulgence in negative emotion under guise of "self-liberation."

**Cascade effects:**
<nyon-mong-ngar-grol-distortion> → <recognition-prevention> → <practice-error>

[24324-24343] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Taking "rang sar dag" as mantra validating all experience as already perfect—license for non-practice.

**Why it arises:**
Comprehensive listing invites rote application.

**Primary consequence:**
Deliberate non-engagement with experience.

**Cascade effects:**
<rang-sar-dog-fetishization> → <nihilistic-error> → <psychologization-error>

[24344] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Reading "blo spros pa can gyi don du'o" as sectarian Dzogchen superiority polemic.

**Why it arises:**
Sectarian competition frameworks interpret as establishing hierarchy.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen elitism; premature engagement without foundations.

**Cascade effects:**
<dzogchen-reductionism> → <pedagogical-error>
