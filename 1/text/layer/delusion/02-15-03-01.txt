**Misreading:**
"Though essence is one, Three Kayas abide in expanse through different aspects" interpreted as establishing kayas as actually three—unity merely conceptual while three-ness is real.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests multiplicity. "Different aspects" implies real distinction. Enumeration validates separation.

**Primary consequence:**
Kayas substantialized as three despite unity claim. Unity dismissed as abstraction. The singular nature is obscured by triplicity.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Unity vs three" duality. Preference for three over one. The three-as-one is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<kaya-triplicity-illusion> → <multiplicity-preference> → <unity-dismissal> → <singular-nature-miss>

[21095-21102] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
"Different aspects" interpreted as establishing real difference—kayas have distinct characteristics despite shared essence.

**Why it arises:**
"Different" suggests variation. Aspects imply properties. Characteristics seem real.

**Primary consequence:**
Aspects substantialized as real differences. Unity-undermined by differentiation. The aspect-free is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Which aspect?" analysis. Aspect-comparison meditation. The undifferentiated is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<aspect-differentiation-fetish> → <difference-obsession> → <characteristic-analysis> → <aspect-free-miss>

[21098-21102] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
"Without obstruction to anything" interpreted as establishing spatial freedom—kayas pervade space without barriers.

**Why it arises:**
"Without obstruction" suggests space. "Anything" implies extent. Pervasion is spatial.

**Primary consequence:**
Kayas substantialized as spatially extended. Recognition displaced by space-pervasion. The space-free is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pervasion-meditation. "Kayas everywhere" visualization. The location-free is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<non-obstruction-spatialization> → <pervasion-obsession> → <space-meditation> → <space-free-miss>

[21100-21102] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
"Perceived objects being one" interpreted as establishing monism—all objects are one object, losing diversity.

**Why it arises:**
"One" suggests singularity. Objects seem multiple. Unity appears opposed.

**Primary consequence:**
Unity substantialized as object-monism. Diversity denied for oneness. The diversity-in-unity is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
"All is one" dissolution. Diversity-rejection. The one-in-many is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<object-unity-confusion> → <monism-fetish> → <diversity-rejection> → <many-in-one-miss>

[21103-21108] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
"Manner of awareness-itself's appearance" interpreted as establishing appearance-modes as real—awareness actually appears in three ways.

**Why it arises:**
"Manner" suggests mode. Appearance implies manifestation. Ways seem real.

**Primary consequence:**
Appearance-modes substantialized as real. Awareness fragmented by manner. The manner-free is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Which manner?" investigation. Mode-differentiation. The single-appearance is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<awareness-manner-reification> → <mode-fragmentation> → <manner-investigation> → <manner-free-miss>

**Misreading:**
"Thought-free awareness, Dharmakaya's essence" interpreted as establishing thought-free as achievement—cessation of thinking is Dharmakaya.

**Why it arises:**
"Thought-free" suggests absence. Cessation seems goal. Blankness appeals.

**Primary consequence:**
Dharmakaya substantialized as thought-cessation. Recognition displaced by non-thinking. The luminous clarity is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Thought-suppression practice. Blank-mind meditation. The clear-knowing is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<thought-free-achievement> → <cessation-practice> → <blank-mind-meditation> → <luminous-clarity-miss>

[21106-21107] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
"Uncensored clear awareness, Sambhogakaya" interpreted as establishing clarity as special state—unblocked luminosity to achieve.

**Why it arises:**
"Uncensored" suggests freedom. "Clear" implies luminosity. Special states attract.

**Primary consequence:**
Clarity substantialized as state-goal. Recognition displaced by clarity-cultivation. The naturally clear is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
Clarity-chasing. "Unblocked awareness" practice. The effortless clarity is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<uncensored-clarity-fetish> → <clarity-cultivation> → <state-chasing> → <naturally-clear-miss>

[21107-21108] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
"Whatever-appearing awareness, Nirmanakaya" interpreted as license—anything that appears is Nirmanakaya, justifying all behavior.

**Why it arises:**
"Whatever" suggests totality. Permissiveness is attractive. License feels free.

**Primary consequence:**
Nirmanakaya substantialized as justification for anything. Recognition replaced by permission. The discerning wisdom is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Everything is Nirmanakaya" license. Ethical disregard. The wisdom-in-appearance is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<whatever-appearing-permissiveness> → <license-justification> → <ethical-disregard> → <discerning-wisdom-miss>

[21109-21110] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
"Complete; awakened" interpreted as establishing final state—end of path where everything is finished.

**Why it arises:**
"Complete" suggests ending. Finality is comforting. Goal-achievement satisfies.

**Primary consequence:**
Awakening substantialized as final state. Recognition displaced by completion-concept. The never-incomplete is obscured.

**Secondary consequences:**
"Finished" complacency. Post-awakening stagnation. The always-unfolding is lost.

**Cascade effects:**
<completion-finality> → <final-state> → <completion-complacency> → <never-incomplete-miss>

Lines 669-684 present the three kayas from single awareness—a core Dzogchen teaching. Though brief, this section contains profound pointing to recognition.
