[1582-1588] <ontological-error>
<ontological-error> <element-reification>
**Misreading:**
The five elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space) are interpreted as the fundamental building blocks of reality—like atoms or physical substances that constitute the world.

**Why it arises:**
"element" carries substantialist connotations from Western science (elements on the periodic table) and Greek philosophy (earth, water, air, fire). of five specific substances suggests they are "what things are made of."

**Primary consequence:**
Dharmas are substantialized into elemental substances. Mind and matter are understood as composed of these five elements, creating a materialist-metaphysical framework that contradicts Buddhist emptiness.

**Secondary consequences:**
The distinction between internal (mind) and external (world) elements congeals as a rigid dualism. Practice petrifies into manipulating elements (through chakras, energetic practices) rather than recognizing their empty nature.

**Cascade effects:**
<reification-error> (treating mind as composed of elements), <reification-error> (viewing elements as real existents), <causal-error> (trying to control elements rather than recognize nature).

[1589-1595] <ontological-error>
<spatial-error> <container-metaphor>
**Misreading:**
The "internal" and "external" dhatus are interpreted as literal spatial containers—mind is "inside" while the world is "outside," with the body as the boundary between them.

**Why it arises:**
The Tibetan terms "nang" (inside) and "phyi" (outside) trigger spatial associations. Common language about "inner experience" and "external world" reinforces this. The body appears as a physical boundary.

**Primary consequence:**
The dhatus become locations rather than modalities of experience. "Internal dhatus" are sought within the body (through meditation), while "external dhatus" are ignored or seen as separate.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dzogchen congeals as a form of internal exploration—looking "inside" for the nature of mind. The non-duality of inner and outer is misunderstood as "everything is inside" rather than "inside/outside is empty."

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-error> (seeking mind within), <ontological-error> (maintaining inner/outer split), <contemplative-narcissism> (focusing only on internal experience).

[1596-1602] <ontological-error>
<causal-error> <dependency-substantialism>
**Misreading:**
The text's discussion of elements producing and supporting each other is interpreted as establishing causal laws—fixed relationships between substantial elements.

**Why it arises:**
Phrases like "earth element produces the body" and "water element produces cohesion" sound like causal claims. Scientific causality expects consistent relationships between entities.

**Primary consequence:**
The interdependence of elements congeals as a mechanical system. Practitioners try to understand "how elements interact" rather than recognizing dependent origination as empty.

**Secondary consequences:**
The five elements become a framework for understanding physiology, psychology, and cosmology in fixed ways. Flexibility is lost as practitioners categorize experiences according to elemental theory.

**Cascade effects:**
<causal-error> (viewing elements as interacting parts), <categorization-fixation> (forcing experiences into elemental boxes), <causal-determinism> (believing elements determine experience).

[1603-1609] <ontological-error>
<reification-error> <aggregates-as-parts>
**Misreading:**
The eighteen dhatus (six sense bases, six objects, six consciousnesses) are understood as actual components that make up experience—like parts of a machine or ingredients in a recipe.

**Why it arises:**
"dhatu" means "element" or "sphere," suggesting components. (18) implies a comprehensive list. The analytical approach feels like "breaking down" experience into parts.

**Primary consequence:**
Experience is analyzed into components rather than recognized as empty display. Practitioners study the 18 dhatus as a map of reality rather than as pedagogical categories.

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation congeals into analytical—trying to identify "which dhatu is active" during experience. The simplicity of direct recognition is buried under complex taxonomies.

**Cascade effects:**
<analytical-fixation> (dissecting rather than recognizing), <scholarly-collapse-error> (treating categories as real), <complexity-accumulation> (adding layers of analysis).

[1610-1616] <ontological-error>
<reification-error> <delusion-as-thing>
**Misreading:**
The statement that "all these dhatus arise from confusion" is interpreted as meaning confusion is a substantial cause or ground from which dhatus emerge.

**Why it arises:**
"From confusion arises" sounds like a causal statement. "Marigpa" (marig pa, confusion/ignorance) can be reified as a thing. The language suggests confusion precedes and produces dhatus.

**Primary consequence:**
Confusion petrifies into a metaphysical principle—the "ground of samsara." Practitioners try to "eliminate confusion" as if it were a real entity, rather than recognizing it as empty.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dzogchen congeals as a project of "clearing up confusion" through practice. The primordial purity of ground is obscured by treating confusion as real and requiring elimination.

**Cascade effects:**
<meditationism-error> (believing confusion must be removed), <ontological-error> (confusion precedes dhatus), <metaphysical-ignorance> (marigpa as cosmic principle).

[1617-1623] <ontological-error>
<five-skandhas-reification> <aggregate-substantialism>
**Misreading:**
The five skandhas (form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness) are understood as the actual components of a person—like five bricks that together constitute a self.

**Why it arises:**
The analytical framework suggests "these five make up a person." Western psychology's parts-of-mind theories map onto this. implies comprehensiveness.

**Primary consequence:**
The self is deconstructed into five real parts rather than recognized as empty. Practitioners analyze "which skandha is operating" rather than recognizing skandhas as empty labels.

**Secondary consequences:**
The no-self teaching congeals as a form of reductionism—"I am not a self, I am five skandhas." The emptiness of the skandhas themselves is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<scholarly-collapse-error> (replacing self with skandhas), <analytical-ego> (the analyzer remains), <constituent-fixation> (skandhas as real building blocks).

[1624-1630] <ontological-error>
<twelve-ayatana-dualism> <sense-base-reification>
**Misreading:**
The twelve ayatanas (six sense bases + six objects) are interpreted as establishing a dualistic structure—inner sense organs meeting outer objects to produce experience.

**Why it arises:**
The paired structure (eye/form, ear/sound, etc.) suggests subject-object duality. "ayatana" (source, basis) implies foundations of experience.

**Primary consequence:**
Experience is understood as the meeting of subject (sense base) and object (sense field). Dzogchen's non-duality is interpreted as "subject and object are both empty" rather than "subject-object is empty."

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation practices reinforce subject-object structure—"I observe the six objects with the six senses." The collapse of this duality is not recognized.

**Cascade effects:**
<sense-door-fixation> (practicing with dualistic sense structure), <subject-object-persistence> (maintaining observer), <contact-reification> (meeting-point as real).

[1631-1637] <ontological-error>
<eighteen-dhatu-expansion> <consciousness-hierarchy>
**Misreading:**
The expansion from twelve ayatanas to eighteen dhatus by adding six consciousnesses is interpreted as establishing a hierarchy or developmental sequence.

**Why it arises:**
The numerical progression (5 → 12 → 18) suggests increasing sophistication. Adding consciousnesses to the model feels like "completing the picture."

**Primary consequence:**
The dhatus are understood as a comprehensive map of reality's structure. Practitioners try to "experience all 18 dhatus" or "transcend the 18 dhatus" as if they were real territories.

**Secondary consequences:**
The simplicity of rigpa is obscured by complex taxonomic achievement. Recognition congeals into "seeing through the 18 dhatus" rather than direct insight.

**Cascade effects:**
<comprehensive-map-fallacy> (dhatus as complete description), <enumerative-achievement> (trying to experience all 18), <taxonomic-transcendence> (transcending categories rather than dissolving them).

[1638-1644] <ontological-error>
<sense-power-materialism> <faculty-reification>
**Misreading:**
The "powers" (dbang po) associated with sense faculties are interpreted as actual capacities or abilities that the senses possess—like muscles or organs with functions.

**Why it arises:**
"Power" suggests capability or faculty. "dbang po" (faculty, power, organ) carries functional connotations. The eye appears to "have" the power of seeing.

**Primary consequence:**
Sensory experience is understood as the exercise of faculties. The emptiness of sensory experience is missed as practitioners focus on "developing faculties" or "purifying senses."

**Secondary consequences:**
Tantric practices involving senses become about "enhancing faculties" rather than recognizing their empty nature. The six sense powers become objects of cultivation.

**Cascade effects:**
<faculty-development> (cultivating sense powers), <functional-fixation> (focusing on what senses do), <organ-reification> (senses as physiological entities).

[1645-1651] <ontological-error>
<object-subject-construction> <perceptual-duality>
**Misreading:**
The section on "object and subject aspects" is interpreted as establishing that experience is constructed from the meeting of perceiver and perceived—as if these were two independent realities that come together.

**Why it arises:**
The paired terminology (gzuang 'dzin, grasped/grasper) suggests two poles. The language of "aspects" (rnam pa) implies perspectives on something.

**Primary consequence:**
Perception is understood as requiring both subject and object. The possibility of perception without this duality is not considered. Dzogchen congeals into "subject and object are empty" rather than "subject-object collapses."

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation reinforces the observer-observed structure. Even "non-dual" meditation maintains subtle subjectivity—the "one who sees non-duality."

**Cascade effects:**
<perceptual-construction> (experience as constructed), <meeting-point-mysticism> (focusing on contact), <subtle-subjectivity> (the non-dual observer).

[1652-1658] <ontological-error>
<samsara-nirvana-duality> <ground-manifestation-split>
**Misreading:**
The presentation of samsaric dhatus vs. nirvanic realization is interpreted as establishing two different realities—confused existence versus enlightened transcendence.

**Why it arises:**
The contrast between 'khor ba'i chos (samsaric phenomena) and mya ngan las 'das pa (nirvana) suggests a dichotomy. The path appears to lead from one to the other.

**Primary consequence:**
Nirvana congeals as a separate state to achieve, a transcendence of samsara. The ground's primordial purity is missed as practitioners strive to "get out" of samsara.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dzogchen petrifies into an escape route from samsara. The recognition that samsara and nirvana are not-two is understood intellectually but not realized.

**Cascade effects:**
<transcendence-seeking> (trying to escape samsara), <nirvana-fabrication> (creating goal to achieve), <path-obstruction> (seeking prevents finding).

[1659-1664] <ontological-error>
<karma-reification> <action-substance>
**Misreading:**
The discussion of karma (virtuous, non-virtuous, immutable) is interpreted as establishing karmic causality as a real mechanism—actions literally producing results through a causal chain.

**Why it arises:**
The threefold classification and detailed discussion of actions suggests a real process. The language of cause and result implies mechanism.

**Primary consequence:**
Karma congeals as a metaphysical system of cosmic justice. Practitioners fixate on "creating good karma" and "avoiding bad karma" rather than recognizing karma's emptiness.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dzogchen practice congeals into about "purifying karma" through techniques. The spontaneity of natural mind is obscured by karmic calculation.

**Cascade effects:**
<karmic-calculism> (calculating merit), <moralistic-spirituality> (good vs bad actions), <purification-project> (trying to clean up karma).

[1665-1670] <ontological-error>
<defilement-substantialism> <klesha-reification>
**Misreading:**
The six afflictions (ignorance, confusion, anger, pride, attachment, jealousy) are interpreted as real entities or forces that afflict the mind—like diseases or demons.

**Why it arises:**
of specific defilements suggests discrete entities. "nyon mong" (affliction, defilement) implies something that contaminates.

**Primary consequence:**
Afflictions are substantialized into enemies to defeat. Practitioners wage war on "anger" or "attachment" rather than recognizing them as empty display.

**Secondary consequences:**
The 84,000 afflictions become a terrifying army to overcome. Dzogchen's self-liberation is replaced by active purification of defilements.

**Cascade effects:**
<anti-affliction-war> (fighting emotions), <defilement-anxiety> (fear of being contaminated), <purification-obsession> (endless cleaning).
