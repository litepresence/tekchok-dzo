[2833-2835] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The two truths—conventional and ultimate—are interpreted as two separate realities or dimensions: the everyday world of conventional truth versus the transcendent realm of ultimate truth.

**Why it arises:**
"truth" suggests reality or existence. Two truths sound like two kinds of reality. "Ultimate" implies a higher, more real dimension beyond the conventional world.

**Primary consequence:**
Ultimate truth congeals as a transcendent reality to reach, while conventional truth is devalued as mere illusion. The non-duality of the two truths is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practitioners seek to "access" ultimate truth through meditation, abandoning conventional reality. Daily life is seen as inferior to "ultimate" experience.

**Cascade effects:**
<transcendence-seeking> (trying to reach ultimate truth), <conventional-rejection> (devaluing ordinary life), <hierarchical-truth> (one truth better than other).

[2833-2833] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The two truths are understood as sequential stages—first understand conventional truth, then progress to ultimate truth, like moving from kindergarten to university.

**Why it arises:**
The pedagogical presentation suggests progression. Buddhist training often proceeds from coarse to subtle. Sequential learning feels natural.

**Primary consequence:**
Ultimate truth is deferred until conventional truth is mastered. Practitioners remain stuck in preparatory study, never recognizing what is already present.

**Secondary consequences:**
The simplicity of direct recognition is replaced by lengthy philosophical study. Dzogchen petrifies into an advanced course requiring prerequisites.

**Cascade effects:**
<preparation-paralysis> (endless study), <progressive-obscuration> (deferring recognition), <pedagogical-error> (treating Dharma as curriculum).

[2833-2833] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
"Conventional truth" is interpreted as "mere convention" or "just appearance"—less real than ultimate truth and therefore not worthy of serious attention.

**Why it arises:**
"Conventional" carries connotations of artificial, arbitrary, or shallow. Ultimate seems profound; conventional seems superficial. Spiritual seekers want what is real.

**Primary consequence:**
Ordinary experience is dismissed as "just conventional." Practitioners try to see through appearances to some more real truth behind them.

**Secondary consequences:**
Life congeals as a problem to transcend. Relationships, work, and daily activities are seen as obstacles to ultimate realization.

**Cascade effects:**
<world-rejection> (leaving conventional life), <appearance-aversion> (trying to see through phenomena), <spiritual-escapism> (using Dharma to exit life).

**Misreading:**
"False conventional" (log pa'i kun rdzob) is interpreted as referring to ordinary appearances, which are then deemed false, illusory, and to be rejected.

**Why it arises:**
"false" suggests deception and unreliability. If conventional is false, it seems one should not trust appearances. Common sense agrees that "things are not what they seem."

**Primary consequence:**
Ordinary perception is pathologized as confused. Practitioners try to stop seeing "false" appearances and see "true" reality instead.

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation congeals as a project of correcting perception. The natural function of perception is interfered with as practitioners try to see differently.

**Cascade effects:**
<perception-correction> (trying to see right), <appearance-rejection> (denying ordinary perception), <meditation-manipulation> (forcing different perception).

[2833-2833] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
"True conventional" (yang dag kun rdzob) is interpreted as virtuous actions, merit accumulation, and positive karma—things to acquire and collect.

**Why it arises:**
"true" suggests something valuable and worth pursuing. Virtuous actions seem like good things to do. The ten virtuous actions provide a clear program.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual practice congeals into moralistic accumulation—doing good deeds, collecting merit, building up positive karma as spiritual capital.

**Secondary consequences:**
The recognition that virtue is also empty is missed. Practitioners become attached to their virtue and merit, developing spiritual pride.

**Cascade effects:**
<merit-accumulation> (collecting spiritual capital), <moralistic-spirituality> (good vs evil framework), <virtue-attachment> (proud of goodness).

[2833-2833] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Ultimate truth is interpreted as a special object of knowledge—the way things "really are" that can be known through meditation or philosophy.

**Why it arises:**
"Truth" suggests a correct description of reality. "Ultimate" implies the deepest, most fundamental level. Knowledge seems to grasp truths.

**Primary consequence:**
Emptiness petrifies into an object of knowledge—something to understand, realize, or perceive. The subject-object structure is maintained even in "ultimate" knowledge.

**Secondary consequences:**
Meditation petrifies into an attempt to "perceive" emptiness. Philosophers debate what ultimate truth "is." The non-conceptual nature is missed.

**Cascade effects:**
<emptiness-cognition> (knowing emptiness), <ultimate-knowledge> (grasping ultimate truth), <objectified-emptiness> (emptiness as thing known).
