[3354-3375] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Dream yoga (*rmi lam*) instructions interpreted as techniques to control, manipulate, or use dreams for spiritual practice—lucid dreaming as achievement.

**Why it arises:**
"Yoga" suggests technique. Lucid dreaming is popular. Control appeals to ego. Methods promise results.

**Primary consequence:**
Dreams become objects to master. Practitioners try to "stay aware" in dreams, missing that dream and waking are equally empty display.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Lucid dreaming obsession
- Valuing "spiritual" dreams over ordinary
- Missing that recognition transcends dream/waking

**Cascade effects:**
<dream-control> → manipulating dreams
<lucid-obsession> → staying aware
<experience-seeking> → special dreams
<recognition-prevention> → technique obscures nature

[3376-3388] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Bardo instructions interpreted as post-death travel guide—literal description of what happens after death that one must memorize and navigate.

**Why it arises:**
"Intermediate state" suggests journey. Tibetan Book of Dead popularized this. Fear of death. Wanting control over afterlife.

**Primary consequence:**
Bardo congeals into future destination. Practitioners study as "what will happen when I die," creating anxiety. The present moment bardo is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Memorizing bardo stages for future use
- Anxiety about "getting it right" at death
- Missing that bardo is this moment's display

**Cascade effects:**
<future-preparation> → waiting for death
<bardo-anxiety> → worrying about journey
<postponement> → I'll practice when dying
<recognition-prevention> → future obscures present

[3389-3393] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The "illusory body" (*sgyu lus*) interpreted as actual subtle body created through practice—something to develop and possess.

**Why it arises:**
"Body" suggests entity. "Illusory" sounds magical. Subtle body fascination. Creation appeals to ego.

**Primary consequence:**
Illusory body congeals into achievement. Practitioners try to "create" or "manifest" it. The empty nature of all bodies is missed.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Body-building meditation
- Valuing "subtle" over "gross" body
- Missing that all form is illusory display

**Cascade effects:**
<subtle-body-obsession> → building light body
<body-hierarchy> → illusory > physical
<creation-ego> → I made this
<recognition-prevention> → having obscures emptiness

[3394-3398] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The "clear light" (*od gsal*) interpreted as luminous experience to be cultivated or attained through meditation—visual achievement.

**Why it arises:**
"Light" suggests vision. Near-death experiences describe light. Meditative phenomena include lights. Experience validates practice.

**Primary consequence:**
Clear light congeals into goal. Practitioners seek light-experiences. The naturally luminous nature is obscured by seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Light-chasing meditation
- Disappointment without visual phenomena
- Missing that clear light is awareness's nature, not experience

**Cascade effects:**
<light-obsession> → seeking luminosity
<experience-validation> → light = progress
<phenomena-attachment> → clinging to visions
<recognition-prevention> → seeking obscures presence

[3399-3408] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The four wisdoms (manifestation, increase, attainment, complete attainment) interpreted as progressive stages to achieve sequentially.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration suggests progression. "Increase" implies growth. Developmental psychology. Achievement orientation.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom congeals into developmental stage. Practitioners try to "reach" each wisdom. The spontaneously present is obscured by progression.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Stage-tracking: "Which wisdom am I at?"
- Believing wisdoms are sequential achievements
- Missing that all four describe one nature

**Cascade effects:**
<stage-obsession> → tracking progress
<sequential-attainment> → achieving levels
<hierarchy-wisdom> → higher is better
<recognition-prevention> → progress obscures presence

[3409-3420] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The emphasis on "recognizing" clear light interpreted as pressure to "get it right"—test-like evaluation at moment of death or in meditation.

**Why it arises:**
"Recognize" suggests correct identification. Test anxiety. Fear of failure. Wanting to pass.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice congeals into performance anxiety. Practitioners fear "missing" recognition. The natural ease is replaced by pressure.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Test-anxiety about recognition
- Self-judgment: "Did I recognize or not?"
- Missing that recognition is not achievement

**Cascade effects:**
<performance-anxiety> → getting it right
<recognition-doubt> → did I or didn't I
<evaluation-stress> → being tested
<recognition-prevention> → anxiety obscures ease

[3421-3430] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Instructions about death and clear light interpreted as requiring special practice at moment of death—waiting until then to "do" the practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Death" suggests special time. Bardo teachings emphasize death moment. Postponement tendency. Hope for future salvation.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice deferred to deathbed. "I'll recognize when I die" congeals into excuse. Present moment availability is ignored.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Waiting for death to practice
- Missing that death happens in every moment
- Future-fixation obscures present recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<postponement> → waiting for death
<future-practice> → then I'll do it
<present-neglect> → not now
<recognition-prevention> → later obscures now

[3431-3440] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The "bardo of existence" (*srid pa bar do*) interpreted as literal intermediate realm where one can choose or influence next rebirth.

**Why it arises:**
"Intermediate" suggests place. Rebirth narratives describe choices. Wanting control over future. Fear of bad rebirth.

**Primary consequence:**
Bardo congeals into literal place. Practitioners try to "navigate" it. The metaphorical nature is lost.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Bardo-navigation techniques
- Anxiety about "choosing" right rebirth
- Missing that bardo describes present confusion

**Cascade effects:**
<navigation-obsession> → steering rebirth
<choice-anxiety> → picking parents
<future-control> → managing next life
<recognition-prevention> → place obscures process

[3441-3450] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The "illusory body of chosen deity" (*yi dam gyi sgyu lus*) interpreted as requiring specific deity visualization practice for liberation in bardo.

**Why it arises:**
"Deity" suggests worship. "Chosen" implies special relationship. Tantric deity yoga is major practice. Hope for divine aid.

**Primary consequence:**
Deity dependence develops. Practitioners believe they need specific deity practice. Self-power is abandoned.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Deity-dependence for liberation
- Anxiety about "having" right deity
- Missing that deity is awareness's display

**Cascade effects:**
<deity-dependence> → need deity to save me
<practice-requirement> → must do deity yoga
<external-salvation> → waiting for rescue
<recognition-prevention> → other-power obscures self-power

[3451-3571] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
"Spontaneous presence" (*lhun grub*) reduced to "being casual" or "going with the flow"—lackadaisical attitude mistaken for Dzogchen.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous" suggests casual. "Effortless" sounds easy. New Age "go with flow." Laziness appeals.

**Primary consequence:**
Dzogchen congeals into excuse for laziness. "It's all spontaneous" justifies inaction. The dynamic clarity solidifies as passivity.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Whatever" attitude as practice
- Avoiding discipline through Dzogchen rhetoric
- Missing that spontaneity is dynamic, not passive

**Cascade effects:**
<casual-spirituality> → laziness as practice
<avoidance-justification> → Dzogchen as excuse
<practice-error> → doing nothing
<recognition-prevention> → indifference obscures dynamic awareness

[3572-3599] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) interpreted as achievement state—something that happens when practice succeeds, not inherent nature.

**Why it arises:**
"Presence" suggests state. "Spontaneous" sounds advanced. Achievement culture. Wanting to "have" realization.

**Primary consequence:**
Lhundrub congeals into goal. Practitioners try to "reach" spontaneous presence. The already-spontaneous is obscured by seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Trying to "be spontaneous"
- Paradox of effortful spontaneity
- Missing that lhundrub is always already the case

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneity-goal> → trying to be natural
<effort-paradox> → striving to relax
<achievement-orientation> → reaching lhundrub
<recognition-prevention> → seeking obscures presence
