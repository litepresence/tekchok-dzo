[29398-29405] <stor-dus-rig-pa-loss-awareness-terror> <loss-time-awareness-panic>

**Misreading:**
The "time of loss" (*stor dus*) interpreted as actual losing of awareness, creating panic about losing the precious jewel of mind.

**Why it arises:**
"Loss" suggests danger. "Awareness" implies possession. Loss-aversion: fear losing what is precious. The practitioner fears losing rigpa.

**Primary consequence:**
Loss-panic: treating awareness as something that can be lost. Natural awareness is obscured by possession-anxiety.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I've lost my awareness"
- Desperate seeking to "find" what was never lost
- Missing that loss is conceptual, not real

**Cascade effects:**
<stor-dus-rig-pa-loss-awareness-terror> → <loss-panic> [fear of losing] → <desperate-seeking> [trying to find] → <conceptual-loss-miss> [panic over nature]

 <bzang-ngan-khyad-med-good-bad-no-difference-bypass> <good-bad-indifference-permission>

**Misreading:**
The "no difference between good and bad" (*bzang ngan khyad med*) in awareness interpreted as permission for unethical behavior, creating moral-bypass.

**Why it arises:**
"No difference" suggests equality. Good/bad implies morality. Libertine reading: no distinction = no ethics. The practitioner justifies harm.

**Primary consequence:**
Moral-bypass: treating awareness-equality as amoral license. Natural ethics are rejected as dualistic.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Awareness makes no distinctions"
- Justifying harmful actions as "beyond good and bad"
- Missing that non-dual includes natural virtue

**Cascade effects:**
<bzang-ngan-khyad-med-good-bad-no-difference-bypass> → <moral-bypass> [amoral license] → <ethical-relativism> [no distinctions] → <natural-virtue-miss> [license over integration]

**Misreading:**
The "unmeditated awareness" (*ma bsgoms pa'i rig pa*) interpreted as superior to meditated awareness, creating practice-elitism.

**Why it arises:**
"Unmeditated" suggests natural. "Meditated" implies effort. Elitism: natural > artificial. The practitioner claims unmeditated-superiority.

**Primary consequence:**
Practice-elitism: treating unmeditated as higher. Natural awareness is obscured by comparative judgment.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My awareness is unmeditated—therefore better"
- Rejection of meditation as "inferior"
- Missing that both are awareness-display

**Cascade effects:**
<ma-bsgoms-rig-pa-unmeditated-awareness-elitism> → <practice-elitism> [natural superiority] → <meditation-rejection> [inferior method] → <equality-miss> [comparison over nature]

[29401-29405] <khor-dus-das-dus-circle-death-time-fixation> <cyclic-death-temporal-obsession>

**Misreading:**
The references to "circle time" and "death time" (*khor dus*, *das dus*) interpreted as specific times when awareness is different, creating temporal-fixation.

**Why it arises:**
"Times" suggests variation. Cyclic/death implies categories. Temporal-mind: awareness changes with time. The practitioner tracks temporal-awareness.

**Primary consequence:**
Temporal-fixation: treating awareness as time-dependent. Natural timelessness is obscured by temporal-monitoring.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Is my awareness better in circle time or death time?"
- Missing that awareness transcends time
- Time-tracking over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<khor-dus-das-dus-circle-death-time-fixation> → <temporal-fixation> [time-dependence] → <awareness-monitoring> [tracking times] → <timelessness-miss> [temporal over nature]

[29403-29405] <gnyid-sad-rig-pa-sleep-wake-awareness-dualism> <sleep-wake-awareness-separation>

**Misreading:**
The awareness in sleep and waking (*gnyid du song dus*, *sad dus*) interpreted as two different awarenesses, creating state-dualism.

**Why it arises:**
"Sleep" and "waking" suggest states. Different conditions imply different awarenesses. Dualistic mind: state = different awareness. The practitioner separates states.

**Primary consequence:**
State-dualism: treating sleep/waking as different awarenesses. Natural continuity is obscured by state-division.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My sleep awareness is different from waking"
- Missing that awareness is continuous
- State-division over seamlessness

**Cascade effects:**
<gnyid-sad-rig-pa-sleep-wake-awareness-dualism> → <state-dualism> [separate awarenesses] → <continuity-fragmentation> [breaking flow] → <seamlessness-miss> [division over nature]

**Misreading:**
The "awareness of going places" (*gro kha'i rig pa*) interpreted as different awareness in different locations, creating geographic-fixation.

**Why it arises:**
"Going places" suggests travel. Locations imply different contexts. Geographic-mind: place changes awareness. The practitioner tracks location-awareness.

**Primary consequence:**
Geographic-fixation: treating awareness as place-dependent. Natural ubiquity is obscured by location-tracking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My awareness is different when I travel"
- Missing that awareness is not location-bound
- Place-tracking over omnipresence

**Cascade effects:**
<gro-kha-rig-pa-going-place-awareness-geographic-fixation> → <geographic-fixation> [place-dependence] → <location-tracking> [where am I] → <ubiquity-miss> [geographic over nature]
