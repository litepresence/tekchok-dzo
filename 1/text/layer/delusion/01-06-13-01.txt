**Misreading:**
Treating chos sku (Dharmakaya) teacher Samantabhadra (kun tu bzang po) as external deity to be worshipped from afar rather than recognizing as one's own nature. Reifying dharmakaya as "out there" separate from immediate awareness.

**Why it arises:**
Conditioning from theistic traditions produces habitual externality projection toward "higher" beings. The Sanskrit name "Samantabhadra" sounds foreign and distant, reinforcing perception of separation. Cultural habit of looking "up" for divine sources rather than recognizing the ground of immediate awareness. Concept of "teacher" (*ston pa*) implies someone external who knows more.

**Primary consequence:**
Perpetual seeking without finding, as the sought-after dharmakaya is projected outward while remaining unrecognized in direct experience. Devotional practice congeals into worship of abstraction rather than recognition of nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dependency on external savior figures; disempowerment of intrinsic wisdom; ritual performance without recognition; accumulation of merit without realization; delay in actual awakening while awaiting blessing from "outside."

**Cascade effects:**
<dharmakaya-teacher-externality> → externality-projection → <deity-worship> → recognition-failure → samsara-perpetuation

[9519-9525] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Approaching the five perfections (teacher, place, teaching, retinue, time) as a checklist to be completed or attained through effort, rather than recognizing their spontaneous perfection (lhun gyis grub pa) beyond achievement.

**Why it arises:**
Western achievement mentality converts sacred dimensions into goals to accomplish. The five perfections framework appears as a structure requiring "completion." Habit of measuring progress through checklists and accomplishments. Missing that gnas, bstan pa, 'khor, and dus are already perfect as the display of awareness.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual materialism where practice congeals as accumulation of "perfect conditions" rather than recognition of inherent perfection. Endless preparation without actual recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Anxiety about having "enough" perfections; judgment of others' practice as "incomplete"; postponement of recognition until conditions are "perfect"; treating lhundrub as achievement rather than natural state.

**Cascade effects:**
<five-perfections-checklist> → achievement-mentality → <spiritual-materialism> → preparation-obsession → recognition-delay

[9532] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Viewing longs sku (Sambhogakaya) pure lands (zhing khams) like "Gangchen Tso" as literal destinations to escape to after death, rather than recognizing them as the display of one's own clear light nature in this very moment.

**Why it arises:**
Dissatisfaction with current life conditions invites desire for better "location." Zhing khams descriptions sound like attractive real estate. Fear of death converted into hope for favorable rebirth. Missing that pure lands are the clarity aspect of one's own awareness-emptiness, not elsewhere.

**Primary consequence:**
Life warps into preparation for death rather than recognition of deathless nature now. Pure land practice warps into escapist fantasy rather than recognition of luminosity in immediate experience.

**Secondary consequences:**
Neglect of present-moment recognition; future-oriented spirituality; disappointment when pure lands don't "appear" as expected; missing that sambhogakaya displays wherever clarity-emptiness is recognized.

**Cascade effects:**
<sambhogakaya-pure-land-escapism> → escapist-fantasy → <afterlife-obsession> → present-neglect → recognition-failure

[9549] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Fixating on sprul sku (Nirmanakaya) teacher Vajradhara (rdo rje 'chang) as historical figure in "Lchanglocan" (lcang lo can), failing to see that nirmanakaya manifests wherever there is recognition of mind's nature.

**Why it arises:**
Historical consciousness looks for "real" figures in time and place. The name "Lchanglocan" sounds like an actual location. Cultural conditioning to value historical fact over timeless truth. Missing that nirmanakaya is the unceasing display of compassionate activity inseparable from recognition.

**Primary consequence:**
Nirmanakaya solidifies as distant historical phenomenon rather than living presence available now. Buddhist practice solidifies as archaeology rather than direct recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Attachment to "authentic" historical lineage; dismissal of present manifestation; literalization of mythic time; failure to recognize one's own manifestation as nirmanakaya activity.

**Cascade effects:**
<nirmanakaya-historical-fixation> → historical-literalism → <lineage-fundamentalism> → present-blindness → recognition-failure

[9566-9567] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Collecting knowledge of the four kayas (sku bzhi) as conceptual accumulation, believing understanding descriptions equals realization. Treating kayas as objects of knowledge rather than recognition of one's own display.

**Why it arises:**
Educational conditioning equates knowledge with understanding. The four kayas framework appears as information to master. Intellectual satisfaction from categorizing dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya, and svabhavikakaya. Missing that sku bzhi are not concepts but direct recognition of one's nature.

**Primary consequence:**
Sophisticated conceptual framework without actual recognition, creating the illusion of progress through accumulation. Scholarly expertise masks lack of realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pride in knowing "about" kayas; judgment of others' "incomplete" understanding; use of terminology without recognition; conceptual kaya hierarchy without direct experience.

**Cascade effects:**
<four-kaya-accumulation> → conceptual-hoarding → <spiritual-intellectualism> → knowledge-pride → recognition-block

[9537, 9554, 9563, 9580] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Buddha-field (zhing khams) tourism mentality - wanting to visit Akanishta ('og min), Sukhavati (bde ba can), or other pure lands as external locations, missing that all fields are displays of one's own awareness-emptiness.

**Why it arises:**
Consumer culture mentality applied to spirituality - "experiencing" pure lands as exotic destinations. Zhing khams descriptions evoke beautiful locations. Spiritual materialism desiring "better" realms. Missing that 'og min and bde ba can are aspects of one's own clear light nature, not elsewhere.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual life petrifies into tourism industry - collecting destinations rather than recognizing nature. Pure lands remain perpetually "out there" while their actual nature is ignored here.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dissatisfaction with "impure" present location; judgment of samsaric realms as inferior; missing that all realms are pure when seen as awareness-display; delay in recognition while seeking better "places."

**Cascade effects:**
<buddha-field-tourism> → spatial-reification → <pure-land-escapism> → location-attachment → recognition-failure

[9534, 9551] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Believing rang byung ye shes (self-arisen wisdom) is something to achieve through practice or time, rather than recognizing it as what is already present but unnoticed. Seeking to "get" what one has never been separate from.

**Why it arises:**
Achievement conditioning assumes everything valuable must be earned. "wisdom" implies something to develop. Rang byung suggests special quality requiring cultivation. Missing that ye shes is not produced by practice but revealed through recognition of what already is.

**Primary consequence:**
Perpetual practice without recognition, as the practitioner seeks what is already present. Effort petrifies into obstacle by implying distance from wisdom.

**Secondary consequences:**
Burnout from endless striving; self-judgment for "not getting it yet"; proliferation of practices to "develop" wisdom; missing the self-arisen nature of every moment of awareness.

**Cascade effects:**
<self-arisen-wisdom-achievement> → attainment-delusion → <striving-compulsion> → effort-obstruction → recognition-delay

[9518] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Attaching to specific teacher forms - Samantabhadra, Vairocana (rnam par snang mdzad), Vajradhara - as ultimate identities rather than skillful displays. Creating hierarchy of "better" teachers based on kaya level.

**Why it arises:**
Identity-fixation habit applies to spiritual figures, creating preference for "higher" forms. Conceptual hierarchy ranks dharmakaya teacher above nirmanakaya. Attachment to specific iconography as "more authentic." Missing that all teacher forms are equally displays of one's own nature.

**Primary consequence:**
Discrimination between teacher forms prevents recognition that all are one's own awareness-display. Preference for "primordial" over "manifest" feeds subtle rejection of present experience.

**Secondary consequences:**
Elitism around "highest" teachers; dismissal of accessible forms; failure to recognize ordinary teachers as nirmanakaya; attachment to iconographic specifics.

**Cascade effects:**
<teacher-identity-attachment> → identity-fixation → <hierarchical-delusion> → form-preference → recognition-block

[9533] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Pilgrimage obsession to "holy" locations like "Rnam Dag Stugpo Bkodpa" believing physical presence grants blessing, while missing that the true place (gnas) is dharmadhatu (chos kyi dbyings) never separate from awareness.

**Why it arises:**
Geographic spiritualism assumes physical locations carry inherent power. Gnas descriptions evoke special sacred sites. Travel industry mentality equates proximity with blessing. Missing that chos kyi dbyings is not a place but the emptiness-nature of all experience.

**Primary consequence:**
Blessing is sought through travel rather than recognition, making spiritual progress dependent on resources and mobility. Gnas remains external while its true nature is ignored internally.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual tourism as status symbol; judgment of those who cannot pilgrimage; missing that wherever awareness is recognized is the holy place; attachment to specific geographic coordinates.

**Cascade effects:**
<place-pilgrimage-obsession> → geographic-spiritualism → <location-attachment> → travel-dependency → recognition-failure

[9520, 9534, 9551, 9569] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Collecting teachings (bstan pa) like precious objects, accumulating transmissions without integrating. Believing more empowerments, more teachings equals more progress, while missing the single teaching of recognizing mind nature.

**Why it arises:**
Consumer mentality applied to dharma - collecting "teachings" as acquisitions. Bstan pa multiplicity cultivates appearance of vast resource to amass. Spiritual materialism measures progress by accumulation. Missing that all teachings point to the single recognition of rang sems.

**Primary consequence:**
Shallow exposure to many teachings without depth in any, creating the illusion of progress through variety. Transmission warps into commodity rather than recognition catalyst.

**Secondary consequences:**
Empowerment shopping; teaching hoarding without practice; use of transmission as status marker; missing that one teaching fully integrated surpasses many partially received.

**Cascade effects:**
<teaching-collection-hoarding> → spiritual-materialism → <transmission-consumerism> → integration-failure → recognition-block

[9521, 9535, 9552, 9562] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Creating exclusivity around retinue ('khor) - "uncompounded assembly," "four buddha families," "wisdom ocean" - as special groups one must belong to, rather than seeing all beings as retinue of one's own awareness display.

**Why it arises:**
Ingroup psychology cultivates spiritual elitism around 'khor categories. "Uncompounded" sounds exclusive and superior. Four buddha families become identity markers. Missing that 'khor is the display of one's own awareness and all beings participate in it.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual exclusivity and judgment of those "outside" the special retinue. 'Khor warps into membership organization rather than natural display.

**Secondary consequences:**
Elitism about "higher" assemblies; rejection of "ordinary" beings; failure to recognize all beings as buddhas; attachment to special group identity.

**Cascade effects:**
<retinue-exclusivity> → ingroup-elitism → <spiritual-exclusivity> → other-condemnation → compassion-block

[9522, 9536, 9553, 9571] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Waiting for special "time" (dus) - death, auspicious moment, future life - to recognize dharmakaya or enter pure lands. Missing that timelessness (dus med) means available now, not later.

**Why it arises:**
Procrastination habit applied to spirituality - "I'll practice seriously later." Dus descriptions imply temporal conditions. Future-orientation assumes better opportunities ahead. Missing that dus med means freedom from temporal limitation entirely, available in this very instant.

**Primary consequence:**
Perpetual postponement of recognition, as the "right time" never arrives. Death-bed spiritualism wastes present opportunities for awakening.

**Secondary consequences:**
Present-moment neglect; future-fantasy about pure land entry; delay in practice until "auspicious" moments; missing that every moment is the timeless dus of recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<timing-conditional-waiting> → procrastination-spiritual → <future-fantasy> → present-neglect → recognition-delay

[9575-9582] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Ranking the three kayas hierarchically - dharmakaya "highest," sambhogakaya "middle," nirmanakaya "lowest" - and striving only for dharmakaya while devaluing the others, failing to see they are inseparable displays of single nature.

**Why it arises:**
Hierarchical thinking imposes rankings on naturally inseparable dimensions. Chos sku sounds "highest" and most abstract. Spiritual elitism prefers "ultimate" over "relative." Missing that sku gsum are simultaneous aspects of single awareness, not levels to climb.

**Primary consequence:**
Rejection of form and manifestation while seeking empty "highest" truth. Sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya are devalued, missing that their recognition is inseparable from dharmakaya realization.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual bypass using dharmakaya to reject relative; disembodied abstraction; failure to integrate display and emptiness; hierarchy-based judgment of others' practice.

**Cascade effects:**
<kaya-hierarchy-ranking> → hierarchical-delusion → <spiritual-elitism> → form-rejection → integration-failure

[9526-9528] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Elitism around "five perfections" (phun sum tshogs pa lnga) - believing those who know this framework are spiritually superior, using it to judge others' practice as "impure" or "incomplete."

**Why it arises:**
Doctrinal knowledge distorts into basis for superiority. Phun sum tshogs pa framework fuels measurable criteria for judgment. Spiritual competition uses vocabulary as status marker. Missing that lhun grub perfection is available to all regardless of doctrinal knowledge.

**Primary consequence:**
Doctrinal sophistication masks lack of realization while creating judgment of others. Five perfections become weapon rather than recognition framework.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pride in knowing the framework; condemnation of "incomplete" practice; use of terminology to establish hierarchy; missing that perfection is intrinsic, not doctrinally conferred.

**Cascade effects:**
<perfection-five-elitism> → doctrinal-elitism → <spiritual-superiority> → other-condemnation → compassion-block

[9562] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Quantifying "wisdom ocean" (ye shes rgya mtsho) - trying to measure, count, or limit the limitless. Believing one can "fill up" on wisdom like accumulating merit points toward enlightenment.

**Why it arises:**
Quantification habit applied to immeasurable. Rgya mtsho metaphor suggests vastness to explore. Achievement mentality wants measurable progress. Missing that ye shes is not accumulable but the unobstructed nature of awareness itself.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual materialism treats wisdom as commodity to acquire, creating perpetual dissatisfaction with current "amount." The ocean metaphor is literalized as volume to fill.

**Secondary consequences:**
Measuring "progress" in wisdom accumulation; anxiety about "not having enough"; commodification of insight; missing that one is already the ocean, not a container to fill.

**Cascade effects:**
<wisdom-ocean-quantification> → quantification-fallacy → <accumulation-obsession> → dissatisfaction-proliferation → recognition-block

[9519] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Reifying dharmadhatu (chos kyi dbyings) as a "place" one can go to or abide in, rather than recognizing it as the emptiness-clarity that is the nature of all experience without separation.

**Why it arises:**
Spatial language ("expanse of dharmas") suggests location. Chos kyi dbyings sounds like a realm or dimension. Habit of seeking "places" to abide spiritually. Missing that dbyings is not a space but the empty nature of every experience.

**Primary consequence:**
Dharmadhatu degrades into destination rather than recognized nature. Practice degrades into journey to somewhere rather than recognition of here.

**Secondary consequences:**
Waiting to "enter" dharmadhatu; geographic projection onto emptiness; missing that every moment already occurs in chos kyi dbyings; attachment to "being in" rather than "being it."

**Cascade effects:**
<dharmadhatu-reification> → spatial-reification → <emptiness-misunderstanding> → seeking-delusion → recognition-failure

[9525, 9528] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Grasping at "effortless spontaneous presence" ('bad med lhun gyis grub pa) as something to achieve through effort, paradoxically turning spontaneity into another practice goal requiring striving.

**Why it arises:**
Irony of achievement mentality applied to effortlessness. Lhun grub sounds like desirable state to attain. Habit of all goals requiring effort. Missing that 'bad med means exactly that - without effort - and is already the case.

**Primary consequence:**
Effort to achieve effortlessness provokes tension that prevents recognition of natural presence. The goal itself degrades into obstacle through grasping.

**Secondary consequences:**
Frustration with "not getting" effortlessness; forcing relaxation; turning spontaneity into technique; missing that every moment is already lhun gyis grub pa.

**Cascade effects:**
<effortless-spontaneity-grasping> → paradoxical-grasping → <effort-tension> → natural-state-obstruction → recognition-delay

[9566-9588] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Separating the four kayas (dharmakaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya, svabhavikakaya) as truly distinct entities rather than different aspects or modes of the same single nature of mind. Creating divisions where none exist.

**Why it arises:**
Categorical thinking divides seamless reality into labeled boxes. Four kayas appear as separate entries in lists. Intellectual analysis emphasizes differences over unity. Missing that sku bzhi are one nature seen from different angles, not separate things.

**Primary consequence:**
Compartmentalized understanding prevents recognition of single nature. Practice degenerates into fragmented according to "which kaya" is being addressed.

**Secondary consequences:**
Preference for certain kayas over others; confused about relationships between sku; missing that all four are simultaneously present in every moment of awareness; reification of distinctions.

**Cascade effects:**
<kaya-four-separation> → false-dichotomy → <compartmentalized-practice> → fragmented-recognition → integration-failure

[9537-9542] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Geographical attachment to pure lands described as stacked realms "twenty-five above and below," literalizing metaphors about spatial dimensions of enlightened display.

**Why it arises:**
Literal interpretation of metaphorical language. "Twenty-five above and below" sounds like architectural description. Physicalist bias assumes spatial reference. Missing that directional metaphors describe qualities of awareness, not cosmic geography.

**Primary consequence:**
Pure lands become physical destinations to reach, requiring travel or rebirth. The metaphor is literalized into geography.

**Secondary consequences:**
Waiting to "go up" to pure lands; rejection of "lower" samsaric locations; missing that vertical metaphors describe depth of recognition not physical altitude; attachment to cosmic architecture.

**Cascade effects:**
<pure-land-geoattachment> → literalism → <spatial-attachment> → escapist-fantasy → recognition-failure

[9549] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Mythologizing the "sixth nirmanakaya teacher Vajradhara" as literal historical being who existed in specific time/place, rather than symbol of mind's indestructible nature manifesting in every moment.

**Why it arises:**
Historical consciousness literalizes mythic figures. "Sixth" implies sequence in historical time. Rdo rje 'chang sounds like personal name. Missing that vajradhara represents indestructible awareness present in every instant, not historical personage.

**Primary consequence:**
Vajradhara decays into distant historical figure rather than living symbol of one's own indestructible nature. Practice decays into historical study rather than present recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Attachment to "authentic" historical accounts; dismissal of present experience; missing that rdo rje 'chang quality is available now; confusion between symbol and historical fact.

**Cascade effects:**
<vajradhara-mythologization> → mythic-literalism → <historical-fixation> → present-blindness → recognition-failure

[9518] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Treating Samantabhadra as external primordial buddha separate from oneself, praying to "him" for realization, rather than recognizing kun tu bzang po as the all-good nature of one's own awareness.

**Why it arises:**
Theistic projection onto dharmakaya teacher. "Primordial buddha" sounds like creator deity. Prayer habit seeks external intervention. Missing that kun tu bzang po is not "him" but the all-good quality of awareness itself.

**Primary consequence:**
Dependency on external savior prevents recognition of intrinsic buddhahood. Samantabhadra remains object of worship rather than recognized nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Perpetual prayer without recognition; self-disempowerment; waiting for "his" blessing; missing that one is already kun tu bzang po in essence.

**Cascade effects:**
<samantabhadra-external-deity> → theistic-projection → <savior-dependency> → self-disempowerment → recognition-block

[9532] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Attachment to Vairocana (rnam par snang mdzad) as luminous form with specific iconography, believing visualization of his appearance equals sambhogakaya realization, while missing the light is one's own awareness-display.

**Why it arises:**
Form-fixation habit applies to sambhogakaya. Rnam par snang mdzad descriptions emphasize luminous appearance. Visualization practice reinforces form-identification. Missing that the light (snang ba) is the display of one's own awareness, not an external form.

**Primary consequence:**
Visualization transforms into attachment to form rather than recognition of luminosity. Sambhogakaya metamorphoses into specific appearance rather than recognized as clear light nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pride in clear visualization; judgment of "impure" appearances; missing that all light is self-display; attachment to iconographic specifics.

**Cascade effects:**
<vairocana-light-form-attachment> → form-fixation → <visualization-obsession> → appearance-attachment → recognition-failure

[9591-9610] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Competing over empowerment counts - "128 perfections," "four sets of sixteen" - treating spiritual development as numerical accumulation game rather than recognition of nature.

**Why it arises:**
Quantification fallacy converts awakening into numbers. "128" and "16" create measurable metrics. Competitive spirituality uses counts as status markers. Missing that empowerment is recognition, not accumulable quantity.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual materialism measured in empowerment counts. Practice transforms into numerical accumulation rather than deepening recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Status competition over "more" empowerments; shallow receipt of many without integration; judgment of "lesser" practitioners; missing that one recognition surpasses many empowerments.

**Cascade effects:**
<empowerment-quantity-competition> → quantification-spiritual → <status-competition> → integration-failure → recognition-block

[9563, 9576, 9580] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Maintaining subtle dualism between clarity/appearance (gsal ba) and emptiness/void (stong pa), believing they must be "combined" rather than recognized as never-separated.

**Why it arises:**
Analytical mind separates naturally unified aspects. Gsal and stong appear as distinct concepts needing synthesis. Philosophical training emphasizes combining opposites. Missing that clarity-emptiness is single nature, not two things joined.

**Primary consequence:**
Perpetual effort to "unite" what was never separate, creating tension where natural ease should prevail. The attempt to combine transforms into the obstacle.

**Secondary consequences:**
Preference for clarity or emptiness; oscillation between extremes; artificial "union" practices; missing that every experience is already gsal stong zung 'jug.

**Cascade effects:**
<clarity-void-dualism> → subtle-dualism → <synthesis-obsession> → effort-proliferation → recognition-delay

[9572] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Believing "self-liberation" (rang grol) and "natural exhaustion" (rang zad) are future results of practice rather than immediate qualities of afflictions when recognized as dharmakaya display.

**Why it arises:**
Temporal displacement habit projects all results into future. Rang grol sounds like achievement to accomplish. Practice appears as cause producing future effect. Missing that rang grol is the nature of afflictions in the instant of recognition.

**Primary consequence:**
Waiting for future liberation while missing immediate self-liberation of present thoughts. Practice transmutes into cause for future result rather than present recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Postponement of recognition; practice for future payoff; missing that every thought is already rang grol when seen as display; delay while waiting for "accomplishment."

**Cascade effects:**
<self-liberation-future-achievement> → temporal-displacement → <future-orientation> → present-neglect → recognition-delay

[9584-9604] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Believing one must "progress" through kayas sequentially - first stabilize nirmanakaya practice, then advance to sambhogakaya, finally reach dharmakaya - missing their simultaneous presence.

**Why it arises:**
Developmental model assumes sequential progress through stages. Three kayas appear as levels to climb. Pedagogical structure suggests order. Missing that sku gsum are always simultaneously present as aspects of single awareness.

**Primary consequence:**
Hierarchical practice delays recognition of higher "levels" while reinforcing sense of distance from dharmakaya. The sequence metamorphoses into obstacle to immediate recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pride in "advanced" kaya practice; judgment of "beginner" level; postponement of dharmakaya recognition; missing that all three are present in every moment.

**Cascade effects:**
<three-kaya-practice-sequence> → sequential-delusion → <hierarchical-practice> → recognition-postponement → integration-failure

 <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Claiming ownership of kaya displays - "my dharmakaya," "my sambhogakaya retinue" - while the very concept of possessor is what obscures natural presence.

**Why it arises:**
Ownership habit applies to spiritual experiences. "My" practice produces "my" realization. Ego co-opts kaya recognition for self-aggrandizement. Missing that sku snang is self-liberated display without owner.

**Primary consequence:**
The possessor-self remains intact, preventing actual recognition of anatta. Kayas become possessions rather than recognized nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual ego inflation; possessiveness about "my" realization; competition over "better" kayas; missing that the owner is the obstacle to recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<kaya-display-ownership> → ownership-delusion → <spiritual-ego> → possessor-fixation → recognition-block

[9597-9604] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Identification with wrathful forms (khro bo) as "I am Heruka" rather than recognition that all forms are spontaneous self-display of awareness without identifiable self.

**Why it arises:**
Identity habit shifts from ordinary to "divine" self. Khro bo forms invoke powerful identification. Visualization practice can reinforce ego. Missing that khro bo sku is display without possessor, not identity to claim.

**Primary consequence:**
Spiritual ego inflated through "divine" identification. The same fixation mechanism now attaches to "higher" identity, perpetuating rather than dissolving self.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pride in wrathful identification; aggression justified as "divine"; missing that all forms are empty display; transfer of ego to spiritual identity.

**Cascade effects:**
<deity-yoga-identification> → identification-misplacement → <spiritual-ego> → ego-reinforcement → recognition-failure

 <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Maintaining dichotomy between peaceful (zhi ba) and wrathful (khro bo) kayas as truly different rather than modes of same display, preferring one over other.

**Why it arises:**
Preference pattern applies to spiritual categories. Zhi ba and khro bo appear as opposites. Dualistic habit sees them as mutually exclusive. Missing that they are equally displays of single nature, neither superior.

**Primary consequence:**
Preference for peaceful or wrathful prevents recognition of both as equal display. Discrimination between forms perpetuates dualistic mind.

**Secondary consequences:**
Judgment of "wrong" emotional tone; attachment to pleasant forms; fear of wrathful manifestations; missing that all are awareness-display.

**Cascade effects:**
<peaceful-wrathful-dichotomy> → preference-delusion → <dualistic-fixation> → discrimination-proliferation → recognition-block

[9617] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Obsessive focus on "mirror-like wisdom" (me long lta bu'i ye shes) as special state to achieve, rather than recognizing all experience already mirrors without obstruction.

**Why it arises:**
State-chasing habit seeks special experiences. Me long lta bu'i ye shes sounds like advanced attainment. Meditation goals create desire for specific wisdom. Missing that all perception is already mirror-like reflection without grasper.

**Primary consequence:**
Seeking special mirror-state prevents recognition that ordinary experience is already me long lta bu. The goal obscures the present fact.

**Secondary consequences:**
Frustration with "ordinary" awareness; forcing mirror-like quality; missing that every reflection is already self-liberated; delay while seeking special state.

**Cascade effects:**
<jnana-mirror-obsession> → state-chasing → <experience-seeking> → ordinary-rejection → recognition-delay

[9617-9622] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Collecting the five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) as achievements to accumulate, believing one must "develop" each wisdom separately rather than recognizing them as natural facets of awareness.

**Why it arises:**
Development model assumes wisdoms must be cultivated. Five wisdoms appear as separate accomplishments. Achievement mentality requires measurable progress. Missing that ye shes lnga are already present as aspects of single awareness.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom accumulation reverses into spiritual materialism. Practice targets "developing" what is already present, creating sense of lack.

**Secondary consequences:**
Competition over "how many" wisdoms; judgment of "undeveloped" practitioners; missing that all five are simultaneous; effort to cultivate what is natural.

**Cascade effects:**
<five-wisdom-collection> → development-delusion → <accumulation-obsession> → lack-perpetuation → recognition-block

[9614-9670] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Quantifying higher knowledges (mngon shes) - "six clairvoyances," "thirty knowledges" - treating them as psychic powers to acquire rather than natural functioning of unobstructed awareness.

**Why it arises:**
Quantification fallacy converts natural functioning into acquisitions. "Six" and "thirty" create measurable targets. Power-chasing seeks special abilities. Missing that mngon shes are natural when awareness is unobstructed, not powers to gain.

**Primary consequence:**
Psychic power pursuit subverts into spiritual goal, diverting from recognition. The "knowledges" are sought as achievements rather than allowed as natural function.

**Secondary consequences:**
Competition over "abilities"; disappointment when powers don't manifest; missing that true knowing is non-conceptual recognition; attachment to special faculties.

**Cascade effects:**
<abhijna-quantification> → power-chasing → <psychic-obsession> → recognition-diversion → siddha-attachment

[9614-9624] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
Competitive pursuit of six superknowledges (mngon shes drug) as signs of spiritual advancement, displaying them to prove realization, while missing that true knowing is non-conceptual.

**Why it arises:**
Spiritual competition uses powers as status markers. "Six knowledges" create measurable achievements. Ego seeks proof of advancement. Missing that mngon shes drug are natural byproducts of recognition, not trophies to display.

**Primary consequence:**
Demonstration of powers overturns into spiritual theater, proving nothing about actual recognition. Competition obscures genuine knowing.

**Secondary consequences:**
Pride in displays; judgment of "lesser" practitioners; missing that true mngon shes is beyond display; attachment to being recognized as advanced.

**Cascade effects:**
<six-superknowledges-competition> → spiritual-competition → <power-display> → ego-reinforcement → recognition-block

[9653, 9670] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Viewing omniscience (thams cad mkhyen pa) as accumulation of all possible knowledge points, like filling a database, rather than recognition that knows without object/subject division.

**Why it arises:**
Cognitive model misapplies information accumulation to wisdom. "All-knowing" sounds like comprehensive database. Epistemological assumptions about knowledge-as-content. Missing that thams cad mkhyen pa is recognition without subject-object, not content accumulation.

**Primary consequence:**
Futile effort to "know everything" as information, missing that omniscience is mode of knowing, not quantity of known. The model prevents actual recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Information hoarding; anxiety about "gaps" in knowledge; missing that knowing is already complete; confusion between wisdom and information.

Believing one can "control" kaya manifestations or "make" buddha-fields appear through practice, rather than recognizing display as self-liberated without controller.

**Why it arises:**
Control delusion extends to spiritual display. Mastery mentality assumes practitioner directs phenomena. Practice appears as cause producing controlled effects. Missing that sku snang is self-liberated without anyone making it appear.

**Primary consequence:**
Controller-self remains intact, using practice to extend dominion rather than dissolve grasping. Manifestation reduces to another arena for ego.

**Secondary consequences:**
Frustration when displays don't obey; spiritual power-tripping; missing that true display is uncontrived; attachment to being "master" of appearances.

**Cascade effects:**
<kaya-manifestation-control> → control-delusion → <spiritual-mastery> → ego-extension → recognition-block

[9571, 9601] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Confusing timelessness with infinite time - believing "timeless" (dus med) means existing for eternity rather than being free of temporal conceptualization entirely.

**Why it arises:**
Temporal concepts are all mind knows. "Timeless" is interpreted within time-framework as "infinite duration." Conceptual conflation of negation with extension. Missing that dus med means freedom from time-concept entirely, not endless time.

**Primary consequence:**
Timelessness misunderstood as eternalism. The concept of "forever" replaces recognition of timeless presence, perpetuating temporal mind.

**Secondary consequences:**
Waiting for "eternal" continuation; fear of time-ending; missing that nowness is timeless; confusion between timeless and endless.

**Cascade effects:**
<timeless-time-confusion> → conceptual-conflation → <eternalism-fallacy> → temporal-fixation → recognition-block
