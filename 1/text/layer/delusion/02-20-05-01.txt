<non-attainment-nihilism> <thob-pa-med-pa-negation>

**Misreading:**
"Nothing to attain" (thob pa med pa) establishes that there is no enlightenment, no liberation, and no spiritual result—absolute nihilism dressed in Dzogchen language.

**Why it arises:**
"Nothing" triggers nihilistic attractor. Negation language invites denial. "To attain" suggests there was something. Misunderstanding of emptiness as annihilation.

**Primary consequence:**
Nihilistic rejection of all spiritual possibilities. "Nothing to attain" congeals into "nothing exists," leading to denial of path, fruit, and recognition itself.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Rejection of path and fruit as meaningful
- Spiritual apathy: "why practice if nothing?"
- Licentiousness justified by emptiness
- Missing that non-attainment is not denial

**Cascade effects:**
<non-attainment-nihilism> → <nihilistic-interpretation> (denial-of-all) → <path-rejection> (no-practice-needed) → <recognition-prevention> (denial substitutes for freedom).

<ontological-error> [SPONTANEOUS AS AUTOMATIC]
**Misreading:**
Spontaneous perfection means everything happens automatically without effort.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous" suggests automatic process.

**Primary consequence:**
Waiting for automatic enlightenment.

**Secondary consequences:**
Passivity; inaction justified.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-error> → <automatic-process-belief> (waiting-to-happen) → <passive-inertia> (non-engagement) → <recognition-prevention> (waiting substitutes for recognition).

<trekcho-completion-achievement> <khregs-chod-mastery-requirement>

**Misreading:**
Trekcho (khregs chod) cutting-through practice must be completed, mastered, or perfected before one can advance to thogal (thod rgal) leap-over teachings.

**Why it arises:**
Pedagogical sequencing suggests prerequisite. "Cutting through" sounds like method to finish. Elitism around advanced teachings.

**Primary consequence:**
Trekcho congeals into prerequisite obstacle. Practitioners obsess over "finishing" trekcho, measuring proficiency, waiting for thogal qualification.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Pressure to "complete" trekcho
- Comparison with "advanced" thogal students
- Believing one must "earn" visions
- Missing that khregs chod is recognition itself

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-completion-achievement> → <proficiency-obsession> (mastery-measurement) → <qualification-anxiety> (waiting-for-permission) → <recognition-prevention> (completion substitutes for immediacy).

<light-phenomena-attachment> <thod-rgal-snang-ba-goal>

**Misreading:**
Thogal visions (thod rgal gyi snang ba)—light circles (thig le), Buddha families (rigs lnga), six limits (mtha' drug)—are achievements to work toward through practice.

**Why it arises:**
Vision descriptions are inspiring. Tangible results appeal. "Signs of success" language. Achievement culture.

**Primary consequence:**
Thogal congeals into vision-achievement project. Practitioners practice specifically to produce light phenomena, treating rang snang as objective goal.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Practicing to "get" visions
- Anxiety when phenomena don't appear
- Believing lights indicate progress
- Missing that visions are natural display

**Cascade effects:**
<light-phenomena-attachment> → <phenomena-goal> (vision-target) → <experience-striving> (wanting-lights) → <recognition-prevention> (appearances substitute for essence).
