[5085-5091] <bcos-ma'i-bsgom-pa-fabrication> <artificial-meditation-addiction>

**Misreading:**
The distinction between "fabricated meditation" (*bcos ma'i bsgom pa*) and "natural samadhi" (*rang bzhin gyi bsam gtan*) interpreted as permission to abandon all meditation effort, creating lazy non-practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Natural" suggests effortlessness. "Fabricated" implies artificial. Anti-effort romanticism: "Real practice is doing nothing." The practitioner justifies laziness as naturalness.

**Primary consequence:**
Laziness-as-practice: ordinary distraction renamed as "natural samadhi." Natural recognition is obscured by non-recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm just being natural" as excuse for no practice
- Missing that natural samadhi requires recognition
- Confusing ordinary mind with natural mind

**Cascade effects:**
<bcos-ma'i-bsgom-pa-fabrication> → <laziness-as-practice> [ordinary distraction] → <non-recognition-justification> [confusion as nature] → <natural-mind-miss> [ordinary vs natural]

 <rlung-sems-dag-project> <wind-mind-purification-obsession>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "binding body and speech at the key points, wind and mind are pure" (*lus ngag gnad du gcun pas rlung sems dag*) interpreted as specific technique to purify energies, creating wind-mind manipulation project.

**Why it arises:**
"Binding" suggests technique. "Pure" implies goal to achieve. Energy-work traditions manipulate *rlung*. The practitioner works to "purify" wind-mind.

**Primary consequence:**
Purification-project: treating impurity as stain to remove. Natural purity is obscured by cleaning-effort.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to purify my wind and mind"
- Missing that purity is ever-present nature
- Energy-manipulation as spiritual practice

**Cascade effects:**
<rlung-sems-dag-project> → <purification-obsession> [stain removal] → <energy-manipulation> [working with rlung] → <natural-purity-miss> [achievement over presence]

 <kun-brtags-kun-rdzob-pathologization> <conceptual-conventional-disease-model>

**Misreading:**
The "conceptual conventional aspect" (*kun brtags kun rdzob kyi rnam pa can*) interpreted as disease or contamination to eliminate, creating pathologization of conceptuality.

**Why it arises:**
"Conceptual" suggests impurity. "Conventional" implies inferior. Purification mentality: clean the impure. The practitioner treats concept as disease.

**Primary consequence:**
Concept-pathologization: treating thought as sickness. Natural conceptual function is medicalized.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I must eliminate all concepts"
- War on thinking as spiritual practice
- Missing that concepts are empty display

- Missing that purity is ever-present
- Immediate-fixation on result

**Cascade effects:**
<kun-rtog-gzhi-gro-rang-sangs-elimination> → <purification-method> [immediate technique] → <concept-cleaning> [purifying thoughts] → <ever-present-miss> [effort over nature]

[5117] <'dzin-cha-phyed-pa-grasping-component-absence-pathologization>
**Misreading:**
The absence of half the grasping component (*'dzin cha'i phyed pa*) interpreted as deficiency to correct, creating grasping-fixation.

**Why it arises:**
"Absence" suggests lack. "Half" implies incompleteness. Perfectionism: complete the whole. The practitioner seeks missing half.

**Primary consequence:**
Grasping-fixation: treating absence as defect. Natural absence is obscured by completion-project.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to complete my understanding"
- Missing that absence is natural feature
- Completion-anxiety over allowing

**Cascade effects:**
<'dzin-cha-phyed-pa-grasping-component-absence-pathologization> → <grasping-fixation> [completion project] → <absence-anxiety> [missing half] → <natural-absence-miss> [completion over allowing]

[5117-5118] <snang-ba-rang-mtsan-'dzin-pa-log-appearance-self-mark-grasping-reversal-technique>
**Misreading:**
The "reversal of grasping at appearances as self-marked" (*snang ba rang mtshan du 'dzin pa log pa*) interpreted as specific technique to reverse self-marking, creating reversal-method.

**Why it arises:**
"Reversal" suggests technique. "Self-marked" implies error. Method-mindset: fix wrong grasping. The practitioner reverses grasping.

**Why it arises:**
"Selflessness" suggests attainment. "Person and phenomena" implies scope. Philosophical pride: "I understand emptiness." The practitioner claims understanding.

**Primary consequence:**
Selflessness-pride: treating understanding as achievement. Natural emptiness is obscured by comprehension-claim.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I have realized selflessness"
- Intellectual pride over emptiness
- Missing that selflessness is not position

**Cascade effects:**
<gzung-'dzin-gang-zag-chos-bdag-med-person-phenomena-selflessness-achievement> → <selflessness-pride> [philosophical achievement] → <emptiness-claim> [understanding possession] → <natural-emptiness-miss> [position over nature]

[5118] <rtog-pa-conceptualization-pride> <thought-achievement-identification>

**Misreading:**
The term "understanding" (*rtog pa*) in "understanding selflessness" interpreted as conceptual comprehension, creating thought-pride.

**Why it arises:**
"Understanding" suggests knowledge. "Conceptual" implies intellectual. Cognitive pride: "I get it." The practitioner identifies with understanding.

**Primary consequence:**
Thought-pride: treating comprehension as realization. Natural recognition is replaced by cognitive achievement.

**Secondary consequences:**

**Misreading:**
The division of appearance-experiences into "five wisdom colors" and "sphere appearances" interpreted as two distinct categories, creating dualistic taxonomy.

**Why it arises:**
"Two" suggests categories. "Five wisdoms/sphere" implies types. Dualistic mind divides experience. The practitioner categorizes appearances.

**Primary consequence:**
Appearance-dualism: treating two as separate types. Natural unity is obscured by classification.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "These are wisdom-colors, those are sphere-appearances"
- Preference for one type over other
- Missing that all appearances are single display

**Cascade effects:**
<snang-nyams-ye-shes-lnga-dbyings-snang-dualism> → <appearance-dualism> [categorical separation] → <type-preference> [wisdom vs sphere] → <unity-miss> [categories over oneness]

[5121-5124] <gong-'phel-progress-addiction> <higher-increase-obsession>

**Why it arises:**
"Higher" suggests advancement. "Increase" implies growth. Developmental model: more = better. The practitioner seeks increase.

**Primary consequence:**
Progress-obsession: treating more appearances as progress. Natural display is obscured by accumulation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My appearances are increasing—I'm progressing"
- Pride in "advanced" visionary capacity
- Missing that increase is natural unfolding

**Cascade effects:**
<gong-'phel-progress-addiction> → <progress-obsession> [more as better] → <accumulation-pride> [visionary capacity] → <natural-unfolding-miss> [growth over nature]

 <je-bkra-je-legs-je-mang-beauty-escalation> <increasingly-beautiful-good-numerous-addiction>

**Misreading:**
The appearances becoming "increasingly beautiful, good, and numerous" (*je bkra je legs je mang*) interpreted as spiritual hierarchy where better visions = better practitioner, creating aesthetic-spiritual elitism.

**Why it arises:**
"Beautiful/good" suggests quality. "Increasingly" implies hierarchy. Aesthetic elitism: beauty = spiritual. The practitioner judges by appearances.

**Primary consequence:**
Aesthetic-elitism: treating beautiful visions as advanced. Natural display is evaluated as good/bad.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I have beautiful visions—I'm advanced"
- Rejection of "plain" experiences
- Missing that all appearances are equally pure

 <snang-tshul-particular-appearance-explanation-fragmentation> <specific-appearance-division-obsession>

**Misreading:**
The "particular explanation of appearance manner" (*snang tshul gyis bye brag tu bshad pa*) interpreted as requirement to divide experiences into specific types, creating fragmentation-obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Particular" suggests details. "Explanation" implies analysis. Analytical mind fragments experience. The practitioner categorizes appearances.

**Primary consequence:**
Fragmentation-obsession: dividing appearances into types. Natural unity is obscured by particularization.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Which type of appearance is this?"
- Missing that division is pedagogical, not real
- Analysis over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<snang-tshul-particular-appearance-explanation-fragmentation> → <fragmentation-obsession> [type division] → <category-analysis> [detailed classification] → <unity-miss> [particulars over whole]
