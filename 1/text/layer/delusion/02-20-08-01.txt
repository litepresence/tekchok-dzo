[29649-29653] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The "mountain peak" metaphor indicates a path of ascent where one must climb from lower to higher states of realization, progressing from inferior to superior views through gradual stages.

**Why it arises:**
"mountain" (ri bo) universally evokes upward progression in spiritual discourse across cultures. Combined with "general meaning" (spyi chings), practitioners assume a graduated curriculum where each capacity level represents a rung on the ladder. The listing of three distinct faculties (rab, 'bring, tha ma) reinforces the hierarchical reading. Cultural conditioning from meritocratic systems favors incremental achievement models over spontaneous recognition paradigms.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner perpetually defers full recognition, believing they must first master "lesser" views before accessing "superior" ones, trapping themselves in preparatory modes indefinitely.

**Secondary consequences:**
Chronic self-assessment and comparison with others; cultivation of spiritual materialism through capacity-ranking; abandonment of direct recognition in favor of sequential "preparation."

**Cascade effects:**
<mountain-peak-climbing> → <three-capacities-hierarchy> [hierarchical reading of dbang po gsum as sequential rather than simultaneous aspects of one recognition]
<three-capacities-hierarchy> → <capacity-self-assessment> [continuous evaluation of which capacity level one currently occupies]
<capacity-self-assessment> → <recognition-delay> [deferring recognition until reaching "higher" capacity]
<recognition-delay> → <fruition-future-goal> [fruition projected into future attainment rather than present recognition]

[29654-29667] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The three capacities represent permanent spiritual hierarchies—some beings are inherently superior, others middling, others inferior—determined by past karma and fixed for this lifetime.

**Why it arises:**
The explicit categorization of "best, middle, last" faculties triggers hierarchical cognition patterns reinforced by caste systems, class structures, and meritocratic education. "when faculties realize this" (dbang pos rtogs dus) suggests realization depends on faculty quality rather than recognition itself. Religious traditions worldwide employ graded initiations, making hierarchical interpretation cognitively default.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioners resign themselves to "lesser" paths or develop superiority/inferiority complexes based on self-assigned capacity rankings, losing the essential point that recognition transcends all categories.

**Secondary consequences:**
Elitism among those assuming "superior" capacity; shame and inadequacy among those accepting "inferior" labels; bypassing of direct recognition through identification with capacity-level descriptions.

**Cascade effects:**
<three-capacities-hierarchy> → <view-meditation-conduct-sequence> [sequentializing the four aspects as capacity-dependent achievements]
<view-meditation-conduct-sequence> → <fruition-future-goal> [fruition as culmination of capacity-appropriate progression]
<fruition-future-goal> → <recognition-prevention> [active deferral of present recognition in favor of future attainment]

[29656-29660] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
View, meditation, conduct, and result constitute a four-step developmental sequence: first establish correct view, then practice meditation, then engage in conduct, finally achieve result—each building upon the previous.

**Why it arises:**
"four-fourfold" (bzhi bzhir) suggests systematic progression. Ordinary experience confirms that actions produce results sequentially. The pedagogical presentation follows grammatical order (view → meditation → conduct → result), triggering temporal interpretation. Cultural preference for linear, causal thinking over synchronous, non-causal recognition.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner compartmentalizes these dimensions, focusing on "developing view" as preliminary stage before "starting meditation," missing their simultaneous, non-dual nature.

**Secondary consequences:**
View treated as philosophical position rather than recognition; meditation as technique rather than natural abiding; conduct as behavioral modification rather than spontaneous expression; result as future achievement rather than present fact.

**Cascade effects:**
<view-meditation-conduct-sequence> → <spontaneous-perfection-passivity> [waiting for result to emerge automatically from sequential practice]
<spontaneous-perfection-passivity> → <recognition-delay> [deferring recognition until sequence completes]
<recognition-delay> → <direct-perception-obstruction> [obscuring immediate recognition with sequential expectation]

[29656-29674] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Terms like "spontaneously arising" (lhun grub) and "self-arisen" (rang byung) mean practice is unnecessary—recognition will happen automatically when conditions ripen without any engagement from the practitioner.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous" in common parlance means automatic or effortless. "Self-arisen" suggests arising without cause or conditions. "wisdom display spontaneously arising" (ye shes kyi snang ba lhun grub) appears to describe an automatic process. Existential appeal of passivity versus the effort of practice. Misunderstanding of Dzogchen "non-effort" as literal inaction.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner abandons all method, waiting for spontaneous awakening while ordinary confusion perpetuates itself.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual lethargy justified as "naturalness"; dismissal of all guidance as "unnecessary effort"; regression to habitual patterns under guise of spontaneity.

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneous-perfection-passivity> → <recognition-delay> [waiting for automatic recognition rather than immediate recognition]
<recognition-delay> → <wisdom-vision-achievement> [seeking extraordinary visionary experiences as signs of spontaneous ripening]
<wisdom-vision-achievement> → <light-phenomena-attachment> [grasping at luminous displays as confirmation of progress]

[29668-29674] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The "lesser faculty" description—realizing appearances as illusion or emanation—provides an objective diagnostic tool for practitioners to identify themselves as inferior capacity, accepting limited realization as their appropriate path.

**Why it arises:**
Self-deprecating cognition matches descriptions of "lesser" capacity. The explicit differentiation invites self-classification. Cultural conditioning toward modesty and acceptance of limitations. Fear of claiming recognition triggers identification with "lower" categories as safer.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner actively adopts "lesser" path limitations, believing humility requires accepting restricted realization, thereby preventing access to recognition available to all faculties equally.

**Secondary consequences:**
Chronic underestimation of recognition capacity; seeking external confirmation of faculty level; avoidance of direct pointing due to assumed inappropriateness for "lesser" practitioners.

**Cascade effects:**
<capacity-self-assessment> → <recognition-delay> [deferring to future lives or higher capacity development]
<recognition-delay> → <empowerment-transmission-magic> [seeking external empowerment to "upgrade" capacity]
<empowerment-transmission-magic> → <thogal-visualization> [fabricating visionary experiences to prove capacity advancement]

[29675-29703] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The second intention's "wisdom filling" (ye shes spyi blugs) and references to empowerment (dbang bskur) indicate that realization is transmitted through ritual consecration from teacher to student, requiring proper ceremonial bestowal.

**Why it arises:**
Tantric traditions emphasize empowerment ceremonies as prerequisites. "empowerment perfected from the beginning" (ye nas rdzogs pa) sounds like something received rather than recognized. The metaphor of "royal empowerment at the crown" (rgyal rigs spyi bo nas dbang bskur) evokes coronation imagery of power transfer. Cultural expectation that spiritual authority requires transmission.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner congeals into dependent on repeated empowerments, believing realization is transferred externally rather than recognized internally, creating guru-dependency rather than self-recognition.

**Secondary consequences:**
Accumulation of empowerments without recognition; seeking increasingly rare or exotic transmission lineages; confusion of ritual efficacy with recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<empowerment-transmission-magic> → <fruition-future-goal> [fruition as culmination of accumulated transmissions]
<fruition-future-goal> → <wisdom-vision-achievement> [seeking visionary signs of successful empowerment]
<wisdom-vision-achievement> → <thogal-visualization> [deliberately generating thogal experiences to validate empowerment]

[29677-29696] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The repeated phrase "obtaining buddhahood" (sangs rgyas 'thob) and "attaining result" ('bras bu thob) indicate that enlightenment is an achievement reached at the end of practice, not the ground of present experience.

**Why it arises:**
"Obtain" and "attain" are achievement verbs requiring temporal sequence. Ordinary goal-oriented cognition assumes results follow causes. The listing of result after view, meditation, and conduct suggests temporal ordering. Cultural emphasis on accomplishment and attainment.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner perpetually defers recognition, believing buddhahood remains a future goal to be achieved through practice, missing that it is the nature of present awareness.

**Secondary consequences:**
Chronic spiritual ambition; dissatisfaction with present recognition; accumulation of practices as "causes" of future enlightenment; overlooking that recognition is already complete.

**Cascade effects:**
<fruition-future-goal> → <recognition-delay> [active postponement of recognition until practice culminates]
<recognition-delay> → <direct-perception-obstruction> [obscuring immediate recognition with future-oriented expectation]
<direct-perception-obstruction> → <appearance-emptiness-paradox> [intellectual resolution of paradox rather than direct recognition]

[29701-29740] <thogal-visualization>

**Misreading:**
The third intention's "bindu seeing aperture" (thig le mthong rtol) provides techniques for deliberately generating visionary experiences—circles of light, bindus, thogal displays—through directed attention or manipulation of subtle body energies.

**Why it arises:**
"Seeing" suggests visual experience; "aperture" implies opening or technique. Thogal traditions describe specific visions (thig le, 'od zer). The subtle body terminology (channels, winds, bindus) invites physiological manipulation. Cultural fascination with extraordinary experiences and altered states.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner deliberately fabricates or seeks specific visual experiences, mistaking induced phenomena for self-arising wisdom, creating artificial displays rather than recognizing natural awareness.

**Secondary consequences:**
Attachment to specific visionary content; disappointment when experiences differ from descriptions; cultivation of subtle body techniques for experience-generation; confusion of physiology with recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<thogal-visualization> → <light-phenomena-attachment> [grasping at visual displays as signs of progress]
<light-phenomena-attachment> → <wisdom-vision-achievement> [pursuing increasingly elaborate visionary experiences]
<wisdom-vision-achievement> → <recognition-prevention> [obscuring recognition with experiential pursuit]

[29708-29739] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The descriptions of superior faculty's view—"like meteors racing in sky," "wisdom potency arising as qualities," "liberation in three instants"—provide benchmarks for extraordinary experiences that confirm successful practice.

**Why it arises:**
Vivid imagery invites comparison with personal experience. "Liberation in three instants" suggests rapid but distinct temporal process. The specificity of descriptions (meteors, sun rising) implies recognizable phenomena. Achievement orientation seeks concrete signs of progress.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner evaluates practice success by comparing experiences to textual descriptions, seeking specific signs rather than recognizing that wisdom display transcends all particular forms.

**Secondary consequences:**
Experience-matching as validation; disappointment with "ordinary" recognition; fabrication of experiences matching descriptions; overlooking that recognition requires no special experience.

**Cascade effects:**
<wisdom-vision-achievement> → <light-phenomena-attachment> [attachment to luminous displays as wisdom indicators]
<light-phenomena-attachment> → <direct-perception-obstruction> [obscuring direct recognition with experiential seeking]
<direct-perception-obstruction> → <recognition-delay> [deferring recognition until achieving described experiences]

[29709-29740] <light-phenomena-attachment>

**Misreading:**
References to "clear light" ('od gsal), displays (snang ba), and luminosity indicate that the goal is to perceive or achieve special light phenomena—internal radiance, external visions, or altered visual perception.

**Why it arises:**
"Clear light" translated literally suggests visual phenomenon. Descriptions of "wisdom display" (ye shes kyi snang ba) evoke visual content. Thogal practices traditionally involve light experiences. Cross-cultural association of spirituality with illumination, brightness, radiance.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner pursues light experiences as the goal, mistaking visual phenomena for wisdom recognition, creating attachment to specific sensory content.

**Secondary consequences:**
Cultivation of eye-pressure or visualization techniques for light generation; interpretation of physical phenomena (phosphenes) as spiritual signs; disappointment with recognition lacking visual component.

**Cascade effects:**
<light-phenomena-attachment> → <thogal-visualization> [deliberate generation of light experiences]
<thogal-visualization> → <wisdom-vision-achievement> [evaluating practice by light-phenomena intensity]
<wisdom-vision-achievement> → <recognition-prevention> [obscuring recognition with light-chasing]

[29720-29729] <direct-perception-obstruction>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "abiding in that display without seer" (snang ba de nyid la mthong byed med par gnas) indicates that the goal is to stop perceiving or seeing, to achieve a blank, non-perceptual state devoid of experience.

**Why it arises:**
"Without seer" interpreted as absence of perception. "Abiding" suggests remaining in non-perceptual state. Fear of confusion leads to desire for cessation of experience. Cultural associations of meditation with blank mind, sensory deprivation, cessation.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner deliberately suppresses perception, seeking non-experiential blankness, mistaking absence of experience for recognition, creating suppression rather than naturalness.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dulling of awareness; dissociative states mistaken for meditation; fear of experience as distraction; active aversion to phenomena.

**Cascade effects:**
<direct-perception-obstruction> → <equal-taste-indifference> [interpreting non-perception as equal taste]
<equal-taste-indifference> → <appearance-emptiness-paradox> [resolving paradox through emptiness-only negation]
<appearance-emptiness-paradox> → <recognition-prevention> [preventing recognition through nihilistic interpretation]

[29740-29767] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The sun-moon equality doctrine describes a final goal where all dualities merge into homogenous unity, requiring the transcendence or elimination of difference into non-dual sameness.

**Why it arises:**
"Sun and moon non-dual" (nyi zla gnyis su med) suggests elimination of duality. "Equality" interpreted as sameness or homogeneity. Cultural association of spirituality with unity, oneness, merging. Fear of difference and multiplicity.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner seeks to collapse all distinctions into undifferentiated oneness, denying relative reality, creating nihilistic homogeneity rather than non-dual equality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Dismissal of conventional distinctions; inability to function in relative world; spiritual bypassing of ethical differentiation; denial of individual differences.

**Cascade effects:**
<sun-moon-duality> → <appearance-emptiness-paradox> [collapsing appearance into emptiness rather than recognizing their equality]
<appearance-emptiness-paradox> → <equal-taste-indifference> [indifference mistaken for equal taste]
<equal-taste-indifference> → <recognition-prevention> [preventing recognition through nihilistic homogenization]

[29741-29767] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The phrase "appearance-emptiness equality without ceasing" (snang stong zad ma mnyam) presents a logical paradox to be intellectually resolved through philosophical analysis—determining how appearance can be empty while remaining apparent.

**Why it arises:**
Apparent contradiction triggers analytical resolution impulse. "Equality" seems to require philosophical explanation. Academic training favors conceptual understanding over direct recognition. Fear of contradiction leads to intellectual resolution.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner engages in philosophical analysis to resolve the paradox intellectually, missing that recognition transcends conceptual resolution, creating conceptual position rather than direct seeing.

**Secondary consequences:**
Accumulation of philosophical positions; debating appearance-emptiness formulations; pride in sophisticated understanding; overlooking that recognition requires no explanation.

**Cascade effects:**
<appearance-emptiness-paradox> → <equal-taste-indifference> [intellectual acceptance mistaken for equal taste]
<equal-taste-indifference> → <direct-perception-obstruction> [conceptual mediation obstructing direct recognition]
<direct-perception-obstruction> → <recognition-delay> [deferring recognition until intellectual resolution complete]

 <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
"Equal taste" (kha mnyam) and "equal gap" (skas mnyam) mean all experiences, ethical choices, and actions are ultimately the same—nothing matters, no distinction between virtue and harm, pleasure and pain, leading to indifferent amorality.

**Why it arises:**
"Equal" interpreted as "same" in value judgment sense. Dzogchen emphasis on transcending good/bad dualism. Cultural relativism supporting "all perspectives valid." Existential appeal of releasing responsibility through nondual view.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner adopts indifferent stance toward all phenomena, ethics, and relationships, justifying harmful behavior as "equal taste," creating spiritual bypassing rather than genuine equality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Amoral behavior justified as nondual; avoidance of ethical discernment; dismissal of suffering as "equal taste"; social dysfunction masked as spiritual transcendence.

**Cascade effects:**
<equal-taste-indifference> → <spontaneous-perfection-passivity> [indifference enabling passive non-engagement]
<spontaneous-perfection-passivity> → <recognition-prevention> [preventing recognition through indifferent disengagement]
<recognition-prevention> → <view-meditation-conduct-sequence> [deferring integration through indifference]

[29768-29797] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Recognition (rtogs pa) is a special event that occurs at specific moments—during formal meditation, at death, in the bardo—not continuously available in ordinary waking life.

**Why it arises:**
"When the doctrine dawns" (dgongs pa shar ba'i dus) suggests temporal specificity. Bardo references imply special transitional states. Ordinary experience seems too mundane for recognition. Cultural preference for peak experiences over continuous awareness.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner limits recognition to specific practice periods or anticipated moments, missing that recognition is the nature of all moments, creating compartmentalized spirituality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Separation of "practice time" from "ordinary life"; waiting for death/bardo for "real" recognition; overlooking present recognition in favor of future special moments.

**Cascade effects:**
<recognition-delay> → <fruition-future-goal> [fruition as future recognition event]
<fruition-future-goal> → <wisdom-vision-achievement> [seeking signs that recognition has occurred]
<wisdom-vision-achievement> → <thogal-visualization> [fabricating recognition experiences]

 <recognition-prevention>

**Misreading:**
The text describes deluded states ('khrul pa) and obstacles to recognition in such detail that practitioners become fixated on diagnosing their confusion, inadvertently reinforcing the very delusion they seek to transcend.

**Why it arises:**
Detailed phenomenology of error invites self-diagnosis. Fear of delusion leads to hypervigilance. Intellectual engagement with error descriptions more accessible than recognition. Cultural emphasis on problem-solving over natural abiding.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner obsessively analyzes their state for signs of delusion or recognition, creating recursive self-monitoring that prevents the naturalness recognition requires.

**Secondary consequences:**
Paralysis through analysis; chronic self-doubt; accumulation of conceptual frameworks about error; forgetting that recognition transcends all categories including "deluded" and "recognized."

**Cascade effects:**
<recognition-prevention> → <capacity-self-assessment> [diagnosing which delusions characterize one's capacity level]
<capacity-self-assessment> → <three-capacities-hierarchy> [hierarchical self-classification by delusion type]
<three-capacities-hierarchy> → <recognition-delay> [deferring recognition based on assigned capacity/delusion profile]

[29798-29821] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Buddhahood is an ontological state or entity that one congeals into through practice—a transformation from ordinary sentient being into awakened buddha requiring fundamental change in being.

**Why it arises:**
"Attaining buddhahood" (sangs rgyas thob pa) suggests acquisition of new state. Transformation narratives pervade spiritual traditions. The sixty dharmas enumeration implies progressive purification. Cultural expectation that enlightenment involves becoming something different.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner seeks fundamental transformation of identity, believing they must become something other than what they are, missing that recognition reveals what has always been.

**Secondary consequences:**
Rejection of ordinary nature; seeking special identity; accumulation of "buddha qualities" as achievements; overlooking that buddha-nature is present, not achieved.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-error> → <fruition-future-goal> [fruition as ontological transformation]
<fruition-future-goal> → <empowerment-transmission-magic> [seeking empowerment to enable ontological shift]
<empowerment-transmission-magic> → <recognition-delay> [waiting for transformation rather than recognizing present nature]

[29811-29829] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The "ground of primordial purity" (ka dag gi sa) is a special transcendent realm or state to be reached or entered, separate from ordinary experience—an ontological location rather than the nature of all locations.

**Why it arises:**
"Ground" (sa) suggests place or location. "Primordial purity" sounds like special state. Metaphors of "carrying to the ground" (sar bskyal) evoke transportation to destination. Cultural preference for spatial metaphors (journey, path, destination) over recognition metaphors.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner seeks to enter or abide in a special "pure ground" distinct from ordinary experience, creating duality between "here" and "the ground," missing that primordial purity is the nature of all experience.

**Secondary consequences:**
Rejection of present experience in favor of "pure ground"; dissatisfaction with ordinary life; spiritual escapism; overlooking that no transportation is required.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-error> → <mountain-peak-climbing> [climbing to reach the pure ground]
<mountain-peak-climbing> → <fruition-future-goal> [pure ground as destination]
<fruition-future-goal> → <recognition-delay> [deferring recognition until reaching the ground]

 <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The numerical structure—five intentions, three capacities, four aspects yielding sixty dharmas—represents a comprehensive curriculum that must be systematically studied and mastered in sequence, each element building upon previous learning.

**Why it arises:**
Enumeration (five, three, four, sixty) suggests systematic curriculum. Educational systems organize knowledge hierarchically. "Binding all yogins" ('ching ba) implies comprehensive coverage. Cultural value placed on thoroughness and completeness.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner approaches teachings as academic subject to be mastered through sequential study, accumulating knowledge about the path rather than recognizing the nature the path points to.

**Secondary consequences:**
Scholasticism without recognition; pride in comprehensive understanding; deferral of practice until study complete; confusion of knowing about with recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<view-meditation-conduct-sequence> → <three-capacities-hierarchy> [mastering curriculum appropriate to each capacity]
<three-capacities-hierarchy> → <capacity-self-assessment> [determining which curriculum level appropriate]
<capacity-self-assessment> → <recognition-delay> [deferring recognition until curriculum mastery complete]

 <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The concluding phrase "spontaneous leap-over wisdom" (lhun grub thod rgal gyi ye shes) indicates that the leap-over (thod rgal) happens spontaneously without any engagement from the practitioner—one simply waits for the spontaneous leap to occur.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous" (lhun grub) suggests automaticity. "Leap-over" (thod rgal) sounds like sudden event that happens to one. of "effortless" Dzogchen invites passive interpretation. Existential relief from responsibility of practice.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner abandons all engagement, waiting for spontaneous leap-over while ordinary confusion continues uninterrupted, missing that thod rgal requires recognition, not passive waiting.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual fatalism; abdication of responsibility; regression under guise of naturalness; overlooking that recognition is active knowing, not passive happening.

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneous-perfection-passivity> → <recognition-delay> [waiting for spontaneous leap rather than immediate recognition]
<recognition-delay> → <direct-perception-obstruction> [obscuring direct recognition with passive expectation]
<direct-perception-obstruction> → <recognition-prevention> [preventing recognition through passive waiting]

[29661-29674] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The middling faculty's description—realizing rigpa "merely unborn" (skye ba med pa tsam du)—provides an intermediate benchmark for practitioners to identify themselves as "middling capacity," accepting partial realization as appropriate to their level.

**Why it arises:**
Middle position feels safe between extremes. "Merely unborn" sounds achievable yet substantial. Self-assessment tends toward middle categories to avoid arrogance or shame. Cultural preference for moderation.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner settles for "middling" recognition, believing they occupy intermediate spiritual territory, preventing the recognition that transcends all capacity categories.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual complacency in "middling" status; avoidance of direct pointing; acceptance of partial recognition as sufficient; overlooking that recognition is complete for all faculties.

**Cascade effects:**
<capacity-self-assessment> → <view-meditation-conduct-sequence> [following middling capacity curriculum]
<view-meditation-conduct-sequence> → <fruition-future-goal> [middling fruition as appropriate goal]
<fruition-future-goal> → <recognition-delay> [deferring full recognition as inappropriate for middling capacity]

[29753-29767] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The non-duality of method (thabs) and wisdom (shes rab) means eliminating or transcending method entirely, pursuing wisdom-only realization without engagement, conduct, or activity.

**Why it arises:**
"Non-dual" interpreted as elimination of one pole. Wisdom privileged over method in some interpretations. Cultural preference for contemplative over active spirituality. Exhaustion with practice leading to wisdom-only preference.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner abandons all method and conduct, seeking wisdom-only realization through disengagement, creating imbalance rather than non-duality.

**Secondary consequences:**
Withdrawal from activity; neglect of skillful means; inability to benefit others; imbalance between realization and manifestation.

**Cascade effects:**
<sun-moon-duality> → <equal-taste-indifference> [indifference to method and activity]
<equal-taste-indifference> → <spontaneous-perfection-passivity> [passive wisdom-only stance]
<spontaneous-perfection-passivity> → <recognition-prevention> [preventing recognition through disengagement]

 <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The different seeing aspects (mthong lta) for the three capacities indicate hierarchical progression—from analyzing source of appearances (lesser), through bliss-emptiness experience (middling), to direct liberation (superior)—requiring advancement through lower to reach higher.

**Why it arises:**
Three distinct descriptions suggest developmental progression. "Superior" description sounds more advanced. Cultural models of skill acquisition through practice levels. Hope that practice leads to qualitative improvement.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner attempts to advance from "lesser" to "middling" to "superior" seeing, treating recognition as developmental achievement rather than immediate availability.

**Secondary consequences:**
Practice focused on capacity-advancement; chronic comparison with descriptions; disappointment with current capacity; overlooking that recognition is identical for all three.

**Cascade effects:**
<three-capacities-hierarchy> → <view-meditation-conduct-sequence> [advancing through capacity-appropriate methods]
<view-meditation-conduct-sequence> → <fruition-future-goal> [higher capacity fruition as goal]
<fruition-future-goal> → <recognition-delay> [deferring recognition until reaching superior capacity]

[29704-29740] <thogal-visualization>

**Misreading:**
The bardo wisdom (bar do'i shes rab) and self-display recognition (rang snang) references indicate that thogal practice requires manipulating the intermediate state experience through specific techniques to achieve recognition after death.

**Why it arises:**
Bardo teachings describe specific post-death experiences. "Self-display" suggests experiences to be recognized. Fear of missing recognition at death leads to bardo-technique focus. Cultural fascination with death and afterlife.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner focuses on bardo preparation and post-death recognition, missing that bardo is continuous with present experience and recognition is always available.

**Secondary consequences:**
Postponement of recognition to death/bardo; anxiety about dying without recognition; accumulation of bardo-specific techniques; overlooking that recognition transcends life and death.

**Cascade effects:**
<thogal-visualization> → <recognition-delay> [deferring recognition to bardo experience]
<recognition-delay> → <fruition-future-goal> [bardo recognition as future goal]
<fruition-future-goal> → <direct-perception-obstruction> [obscuring present recognition with bardo-focus]

[29798-29829] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The enumeration of sixty dharmas (drug cu / chos kyi rnam grangs) represents a comprehensive taxonomy of spiritual realities that must be intellectually mastered and categorized for complete understanding.

**Why it arises:**
Numerical precision (60) suggests systematic knowledge. "Dharma enumerations" implies categorical system. Academic training values taxonomic mastery. Cultural preference for comprehensive frameworks.

**Primary consequence:**
Practitioner engages in categorical analysis of the sixty dharmas, accumulating knowledge of the system rather than recognizing what the system points toward.

**Secondary consequences:**
Intellectual mastery without recognition; pride in comprehensive knowledge; deferral of recognition until taxonomy complete; confusion of map with territory.

**Cascade effects:**
<ontological-error> → <view-meditation-conduct-sequence> [mastering sixty dharmas as curriculum]
<view-meditation-conduct-sequence> → <three-capacities-hierarchy> [organizing dharmas by capacity level]
