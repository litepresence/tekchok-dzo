**Misreading:**
The threefold structure (basis of empowerment, path of empowerment, result of completion) is interpreted as developmental stages one progresses through.

**Why it arises:**
Temporal projection. Sequential description invites progression. "Completion" suggests goal.

**Primary consequence:**
Stage-climbing. The practitioner believes they advance from basis through path to result.

**Secondary consequences:**
Deferring result; measuring progress; missing that all three are simultaneous recognition.

**Cascade effects:**
<ground-path-fruition temporalization> through stage-model.
<progress-tracking> through advancement-measurement.

[6765-6780] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The extensive list of guru qualities (compassionate, skilled in view, Dzogchen instruction, etc.) is interpreted as establishing an idealized figure to be worshipped or sought.

**Why it arises:**
Hero-worship tendency. Quality-lists suggest ideal. Looking for perfect teacher.

**Primary consequence:**
Guru-idealization. The practitioner seeks "perfect guru" matching all qualities.

**Secondary consequences:**
Disappointment with real teachers; guru-shopping; missing that qualities point to nature, not person.

**Cascade effects:**
<authority-dependency> through idealization.
<disappointment-cycle> through perfection-seeking.

**Misreading:**
"Vajra holder" (rdo rje 'dzin pa) is interpreted as establishing an achieved status or title that distinguishes advanced practitioners from ordinary beings.

**Why it arises:**
Status-seeking. "Holder" suggests possession. Title implies rank.

**Primary consequence:**
Status-aspiration. The practitioner seeks to become "vajra holder" as identity.

**Secondary consequences:**
Spiritual materialism; elitism; missing that vajra holder is recognition, not title.

**Cascade effects:**
<identity-fixation> through status-aspiration.
<hierarchical-error> through holder-identity.

[6793-6800] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
The six characteristics of guru (discarding samsara, few desires, skilled in methods, etc.) are interpreted as checklist requirements to verify before accepting a teacher.

**Why it arises:**
Verification compulsion. Six suggests completeness. Fear of false teachers.

**Primary consequence:**
Checklist-obsession. The practitioner evaluates teachers against six criteria.

**Secondary consequences:**
Judgmental attitude; missing living transmission; formalism.

**Cascade effects:**
<judgmental-obsession> through checklist-verification.
<transmission-miss> through evaluation-over-presence.

[6793-6799] <ontological-error>
**Misreading:**
"Great compassion" (snying rje che) is interpreted as establishing a quantity or degree of compassion that can be measured or compared.

**Why it arises:**
Quantitative thinking. "Great" suggests scale. Measurable qualities.

**Primary consequence:**
Compassion-comparison. The practitioner measures "how much" compassion.

**Secondary consequences:**
Quantification of qualities; competition; missing that compassion is recognition-expression.

**Cascade effects:**
<reification-error> through measurability.
<spiritual-competition> through comparison.
