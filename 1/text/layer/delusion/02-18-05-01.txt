**Misreading:**
Cutting speech (*smra ba bcad pa*) interpreted as forceful suppression through willpower, creating inner conflict and tension.

**Why it arises:**
"Cut" suggests prohibition. "Restriction" implies force. Suppression-pattern: "I must not speak."

**Primary consequence:**
Speech-suppression: forced silence creating pressure. Natural quiet replaced by enforced muteness.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Inner tension from holding back
- "I want to speak but can't" conflict
- Missing that silence is natural, not forced

**Cascade effects:**
<speech-restriction-suppression> → <forced-silence> [willpower muteness] → <inner-conflict> [holding back] → <natural-quiet-miss> [silence as ease]

 <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
"Train in long silence" (*ring du bslab*) interpreted as duration achievement, creating silence-length competition.

**Why it arises:**
"Long" suggests duration. "Train" implies accumulation. Achievement-pattern: "I did 3 days silent."

**Primary consequence:**
Silence-competition: measuring practice by duration. Natural silence replaced by endurance-test.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My silence retreat was longer"
- Pride in duration over quality
- Missing that silence is moment-to-moment

**Cascade effects:**
<long-silence-achievement> → <silence-competition> [duration pride] → <endurance-test> [lasting vs being] → <moment-silence-miss> [silence as now]

 <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The prohibition on mantra recitation (*sngags la sogs pa brjod pa mi bya*) interpreted as absolute ban creating anxiety about accidental recitation.

**Why it arises:**
"Prohibition" suggests rule. "Not do" implies restriction. Scrupulosity: "I might accidentally recite!"

**Primary consequence:**
Mantra-anxiety: obsessive monitoring of speech. Natural quiet replaced by prohibition-obsession.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Fear of accidentally breaking silence
- Missing that prohibition is contextual
- Rule-following over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<mantra-prohibition-attachment> → <mantra-anxiety> [accidental speech fear] → <obsessive-monitoring> [speech checking] → <contextual-prohibition-miss> [rule as pointer]

[4626-4638] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The three key points (*gnad gsum*)—gateway, field, wind-rigpa—interpreted as techniques to master, creating checklist mentality.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests set. "Key points" implies methods. Technique-thinking: "I must master these three."

**Primary consequence:**
Key-point-mastery: treating gnad as achievements. Natural recognition replaced by point-collecting.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Have I mastered gateway key point?"
- Missing that three are aspects of single display
- Technique-accumulation over recognition

**Cascade effects:**
<three-key-points-mastery> → <key-point-mastery> [method collecting] → <checklist-mentality> [which point?] → <single-display-miss> [three as one]

 <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The gateway key point (*sgo'i gnad*) interpreted as requiring specific eye positioning or gateway control, creating fixation on visual access.

**Why it arises:**
"Gateway" suggests entrance. "Key point" implies mechanism. Control-pattern: "I must control my gateway."

**Primary consequence:**
Gateway-fixation: obsession with visual access points. Natural seeing replaced by aperture-control.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Is my gateway open/closed correctly?"
- Physical eye strain from positioning
- Missing that gateway is natural display

**Cascade effects:**
<gateway-key-point-fixation> → <gateway-fixation> [access control] → <aperture-obsession> [eye positioning] → <natural-seeing-miss> [gateway as display]

 <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The field key point (*yul gyi gnad*) interpreted as establishing territorial possession over perceptual space, creating field-ownership.

**Why it arises:**
"Field" suggests territory. "Key point" implies control. Possession-pattern: "This is my field."

**Primary consequence:**
Field-ownership: claiming perceptual territory. Natural field replaced by possessive space.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My field of vision" attachment
- Defensive protection of space
- Missing that field is open display

**Cascade effects:**
<field-key-point-territoriality> → <field-ownership> [territorial claim] → <possessive-space> [protecting field] → <open-display-miss> [field as natural]

 <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The wind-rigpa key point (*rlung rig gi gnad*) interpreted as requiring manipulation of subtle winds and awareness, creating energetic control obsession.

**Why it arises:**
"Wind" suggests energy. "Rigpa" implies awareness. Manipulation-thinking: "I must control these."

**Primary consequence:**
Wind-control: forcing energetic flow. Natural wind-rigpa replaced by mechanical management.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Physical tension from wind-manipulation
- "Are my winds flowing right?" checking
- Missing that wind-rigpa is natural

**Cascade effects:**
<wind-rigpa-key-point-manipulation> → <wind-control> [energy forcing] → <mechanical-management> [forcing flow] → <natural-wind-miss> [wind-rigpa as ease]

[4639-4695] <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The weapon analogies—arrow (*so pa*), guest (*'gron po*), trap (*jag pa*)—interpreted as establishing aggressive/defensive practice, creating martial mentality.

**Why it arises:**
"Weapon" suggests aggression. "Trap" implies defense. Martial thinking: "I must arm myself."

**Primary consequence:**
Weapon-fetish: treating practice as armament. Natural recognition replaced by martial preparation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "My three weapons are ready" aggression
- Defensive posture toward experience
- Missing that analogies point to naturalness

**Cascade effects:**
<three-points-weapon-analogy-literalization> → <weapon-fetish> [armament mentality] → <martial-preparation> [aggression/defense] → <analogy-pointer-miss> [weapons as metaphors]

 <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
The warning about too many or too few points (*mang na mtha' yas... nyung na don mi 'grub*) interpreted as requiring exactly three, creating numerical fixation.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests optimal number. "More/less" implies error. Numerical fixation: "Must be exactly three."

**Primary consequence:**
Numerical-obsession: fixating on quantity. Natural teaching replaced by number-compliance.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I have four points—is that wrong?"
- Missing that three is pedagogical, not absolute
- Counting over recognizing

**Cascade effects:**
<three-points-less-more-confusion> → <numerical-obsession> [quantity fixation] → <number-compliance> [exact count] → <pedagogical-function-miss> [three as teaching]

 <ontological-error>

**Misreading:**
Restraining body, speech, and mind (*lus ngag sems gsum mi 'gul*) interpreted as forceful immobilization, creating rigid fixation.

**Why it arises:**
"Restrain" suggests holding. "Not moving" implies freezing. Force-pattern: "I must hold still."

**Primary consequence:**
Forceful-restraint: rigid immobilization. Natural ease replaced by muscular holding.

**Secondary consequences:**
- Physical tension from forced stillness
- "Am I restrained enough?" checking
- Missing that non-movement is natural

**Cascade effects:**
<three-body-speech-mind-restriction> → <forceful-restraint> [rigid holding] → <muscular-fixation> [tension] → <natural-ease-miss> [stillness as allowing]
