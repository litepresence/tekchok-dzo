<trekcho-completion-achievement> <khregs-chod-gzhi>

**Misreading:**
the ground of Trekcho (*khregs chod*) interpreted as foundation to establish before practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Basis" suggests prerequisite. "Trekcho" implies method. Foundationalist thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Basis-establishment: trying to create foundation. Natural foundation obscured by construction.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to establish the basis first"
- Missing that basis is already present
- Reifying foundation as achievement
- Preliminary-obsession

**Cascade effects:**
<trekcho-completion-achievement> → <foundation-construction> [building basis] → <preliminary-obsession> [not ready yet] → <natural-foundation-miss> [basis always present]

<cutting-through-effort> <chod-pa-rtsol-ba>

**Misreading:**
"Cutting through" (*gcod pa*) interpreted as effortful severing requiring force.

**Why it arises:**
"Cutting" suggests action. "Through" implies penetration. Effort-culture.

**Primary consequence:**
Forceful-cutting: applying effort to cut. Natural cutting-through obscured by striving.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I must cut through with effort"
- Missing that cutting is recognition
- Reifying method as forceful
- Exhaustion from trying

**Cascade effects:**
<cutting-effort> → <forceful-striving> [trying hard] → <exhaustion-compulsion> [wearing out] → <natural-cutting-miss> [cutting is seeing]

<rigpa-introduction-event> <rig-pa-ngo-sprod>

**Misreading:**
Rigpa introduction interpreted as special event where teacher bestows awareness.

**Why it arises:**
"Introduction" suggests ceremony. "Rigpa" implies special state. Event-fetish.

**Primary consequence:**
Introduction-event: treating pointing-out as ritual. Natural self-introduction obscured by ceremony.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I received introduction from my teacher"
- Missing that introduction is always happening
- Reifying ritual as necessary
- Teacher-dependency

**Cascade effects:**
<rigpa-introduction-event> → <ritual-dependency> [need ceremony] → <teacher-attachment> [waiting for pointing] → <natural-introduction-miss> [self-introducing]

<direct-recognition-achievement> <ngo-rang-thog-tu-dbab>

**Misreading:**
Direct recognition (*ngo rang thog tu dbab*) interpreted as special attainment to achieve.

**Why it arises:**
"Direct" suggests immediate. "Recognition" implies attainment. Achievement-mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Recognition-achievement: pursuing direct seeing as goal. Natural directness obscured by goal-fixation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I achieved direct recognition"
- Missing that direct is always already
- Reifying recognition as event
- Spiritual status-seeking

**Cascade effects:**
<direct-recognition-achievement> → <goal-fixation> [getting recognition] → <status-seeking> [having it] → <natural-directness-miss> [always direct]

<thogal-sequential-waiting> <khregs-chod-tha-dad>

**Misreading:**
Trekcho interpreted as separate practice from Thogal, creating method-dualism.

**Why it arises:**
"Trekcho" suggests cutting. "Thogal" implies direct. Comparative methods.

**Primary consequence:**
Method-dualism: choosing between Trekcho/Thogal. Natural unity obscured by comparison.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Should I do Trekcho or Thogal?"
- Missing that both point to same nature
- Reifying methods as distinct paths
- Practice-shopping

**Cascade effects:**
<thogal-sequential-waiting> → <method-comparison> [which better] → <practice-shopping> [choosing] → <natural-unity-miss> [methods are one]

[23465-23470] <ontological-error>
<basis-essence-separation> <gzhi-ngo-bo-tha-dad>

**Misreading:**
The basis (*gzhi*), essence (*ngo bo*), and nature (*rang bzhin*) interpreted as separate entities.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests distinction. Technical terms imply concepts. Analytical thinking.

**Primary consequence:**
Triadic-separation: treating three aspects as divisions. Natural inseparability obscured by analysis.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "the ground is emptiness, essence is clarity, nature is compassion"
- Missing that three are indivisible
- Reifying concepts as realities
- Philosophical fragmentation

**Cascade effects:**
<triadic-separation> → <analytical-fragmentation> [dividing] → <philosophical-debate> [how relate] → <natural-inseparability-miss> [never separate]

[23471-23476] <ontological-error>
<primordial-purity-foundation> <ka-dag-gzhi>

**Misreading:**
Primordial purity (*ka dag*) interpreted as original state to return to or maintain.

**Why it arises:**
"Primordial" suggests origin. "Purity" implies cleanness. Restoration-fantasy.

**Primary consequence:**
Origin-return: trying to get back to purity. Natural ever-purity obscured by temporal thinking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to return to primordial purity"
- Missing that purity is never lost
- Reifying origin as past
- Restoration-project

**Cascade effects:**
<primordial-purity-foundation> → <origin-return> [going back] → <restoration-project> [recovering] → <natural-ever-purity-miss> [never impure]

[23477-23482] <ontological-error>
<spontaneous-presence-achievement> <lhun-grub-gzhi>

**Misreading:**
Spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) interpreted as special state to achieve through practice.

**Why it arises:**
"Spontaneous" suggests effortlessness. "Presence" implies state. State-achievement.

**Primary consequence:**
Spontaneity-achievement: pursuing effortless state. Natural spontaneity obscured by effort-to-be-effortless.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I'm trying to be spontaneous"
- Missing that trying prevents spontaneity
- Reifying effortlessness as goal
- Paradox of trying not to try

**Cascade effects:**
<spontaneity-achievement> → <effort-paradox> [trying to not try] → <performance-anxiety> [being spontaneous] → <natural-spontaneity-miss> [effortless is natural]
