[37196-37215] <five-perfections-accumulation> <phun-sum-tshogs-pa-lnga>

**Misreading:**
The five perfections (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga*)—teacher, place, retinue, teaching, time—interpreted as checklist to complete for spiritual accomplishment.

**Why it arises:**
"Five" suggests set. "Perfections" implies ideal conditions. Achievement mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Perfection-chasing: pursuing ideal circumstances. Natural perfection obscured by condition-seeking.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need all five perfections to practice"
- Missing that perfections are naturally present
- Waiting for right conditions
- Reifying circumstances as prerequisites

**Cascade effects:**
<five-perfections-accumulation> → <condition-seeking> [perfect setup] → <waiting-mentality> [not yet ready] → <natural-perfection-miss> [already perfect]

[37216-37228] <outer-perfection-externalization> <phyi'i-phun-sum>

**Misreading:**
The outer five perfections (Grdhrakuta, Buddha Shakyamuni, various vehicles, retinue, 100-year lifespan) interpreted as external historical requirements.

**Why it arises:**
"Outer" suggests external. Historical Buddha seems essential. Place pilgrimage.

**Primary consequence:**
External-dependency: needing Vulture Peak/Shakyamuni. Natural inner perfection obscured by externals.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to go to Vulture Peak"
- Missing that outer perfections symbolize inner nature
- Reifying locations as sacred
- Time-displacement to Buddha's era

**Cascade effects:**
<outer-perfection-externalization> → <pilgrimage-obsession> [going to places] → <historical-nostalgia> [Buddha's time] → <natural-inner-perfection-miss> [perfection here now]

[37228-37237] <inner-perfection-achievement> <nang-gi-phun-sum>

**Misreading:**
The inner five perfections (Akanishta, Vajradhara, dakinis, secret mantra, pure timing) interpreted as advanced attainments requiring initiation.

**Why it arises:**
"Inner" suggests hidden. "Secret" implies esoteric. Elitist access.

**Primary consequence:**
Initiation-dependency: waiting for inner perfection access. Natural availability obscured by secrecy.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need initiation for inner perfections"
- Missing that inner is always accessible
- Reifying secret as superior
- Exclusion from "inner" circle

**Cascade effects:**
<inner-perfection-achievement> → <initiation-waiting> [permission needed] → <elitist-exclusion> [inner vs outer] → <natural-availability-miss> [always accessible]

[37237-37238] <three-kaya-five-perfection-multiplication> <sku-gsum-phun-lnga>

**Misreading:**
The three kayas each having five perfections interpreted as 15 achievements to accumulate.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" times "five" suggests multiplication. Quantification produces goals.

**Primary consequence:**
Accumulation-mania: pursuing 15 perfections. Natural simplicity obscured by complexity.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need 15 perfections for complete awakening"
- Missing that kayas and perfections are unified
- Reifying numbers as requirements
- Endless accumulation

**Cascade effects:**
<three-kaya-five-perfection-multiplication> → <accumulation-mania> [chasing 15] → <complexity-overwhelm> [too many] → <natural-simplicity-miss> [already complete]

[37239-37252] <wisdom-mode-reification> <ye-shes-gnas>

**Misreading:**
The three modes of wisdom (*ye shes gnas*)—dharmakaya basis, sambhogakaya self-characteristic, nirmanakaya all-pervading—interpreted as separate wisdoms to develop.

**Why it arises:**
"Three modes" suggests types. "Wisdom" implies attainment. Collection mentality.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom-collecting: pursuing three types. Natural wisdom-unity obscured by categorization.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I need to develop all three wisdom modes"
- Missing that modes are aspects, not separate
- Reifying types as distinct achievements
- Comparison of "wisdom development"

**Cascade effects:**
<wisdom-mode-reification> → <wisdom-collecting> [type accumulation] → <categorical-fixation> [dharmakaya vs sambhogakaya] → <natural-wisdom-unity-miss> [one wisdom]

[37253-37270] <three-wisdom-essence-nature-compassion> <ngo-bo-rang-bzhin-thugs-rje>

**Misreading:**
The three wisdoms of essence (ka-dag), nature (lhun-grub), compassion (kun-khyab) interpreted as trinity to conceptualize.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests triad. Theological trinity influence. Conceptual clarity desire.

**Primary consequence:**
Trinitarian-conceptualization: intellectually grasping three-aspects. Natural non-conceptuality obscured by theology.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Essence is empty, nature is luminous, compassion is pervasive"
- Missing that description points beyond concepts
- Reifying three as metaphysical structure
- Theological debate about relationships

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Mirror-like wisdom is principal for Akshobhya"
- Missing that all five are equally essential
- Reifying principal/retinue as value-judgment
- Preference for "principal" wisdom

**Cascade effects:**
<longku-five-wisdom-hierarchy> → <wisdom-ranking> [principal better] → <discriminatory-preference> [choosing favorites] → <natural-equality-miss> [all equal]

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I have 15 of 25 wisdoms"
- Missing that wisdom is singular, not plural
- Reifying enumeration as achievement
- Checklist spirituality

**Cascade effects:**
<twenty-five-wisdom-accumulation> → <inventory-mentality> [counting wisdoms] → <pluralism-fixation> [many types] → <natural-singularity-miss> [one wisdom]

[37266-37281] <basis-wisdom-seed-dependency> <gzh-gnas-ye-shes-sa-bon>

**Misreading:**
The basis wisdom as "seed" (*sa bon*) interpreted as potential requiring development.

**Why it arises:**

**Primary consequence:**
Continuity-obsession: fearing gaps in being. Natural discontinuity obscured by persistence-desire.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "Wisdom must not be interrupted"
- Missing that interruptions are conceptual
- Reifying continuity as essential
- Terror at gaps

**Cascade effects:**
<above-below-interruption-terror> → <continuity-obsession> [no gaps allowed] → <existential-anxiety> [fear of discontinuity] → <natural-discontinuity-miss> [gaps are display]

[37296-37311] <thug-je-shugs-kyi-materialization> <thugs-rje-shugs>

**Misreading:**
The "energy of compassion" (*thugs rje shugs*) interpreted as force to harness for benefit.

**Why it arises:**
"Energy" suggests power. "Force" implies agency. Power-manipulation traditions.

**Primary consequence:**
Force-harnessing: trying to use compassion-energy. Natural spontaneous benefit obscured by manipulation.

**Misreading:**
The exhaustion of 25 wisdoms into dharmata interpreted as losing valuable qualities.

**Why it arises:**
"Exhaustion" suggests depletion. "Twenty-five" implies possession. Loss-aversion.

**Primary consequence:**
Wisdom-loss-fear: clinging to multiple wisdoms. Natural singularity obscured by plurality-attachment.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I don't want to lose my 25 wisdoms"

- Reifying multiplicity as richness
- Fear of simplification

**Cascade effects:**
<wisdom-twenty-five-exhaustion> → <multiplicity-clinging> [holding many] → <simplification-fear> [losing variety] → <natural-singularity-miss> [one is complete]

[37326-37341] <ka-dag-lhun-grub-thug-je-triadic-achievement> <ka-dag-lhun-grub-thugs-rje>

**Misreading:**
The triad of ka-dag, lhun-grub, thugs-rje interpreted as three achievements to complete.

**Why it arises:**
"Three" suggests set. Each term implies quality. Achievement checklist.

**Primary consequence:**
Triadic-completion: pursuing three qualities. Natural unity obscured by trinitarian accumulation.

**Secondary consequences:**
- "I've achieved ka-dag, working on lhun-grub"
- Missing that three are inseparable
- Reifying separation as progressive
- Spiritual resume-building
