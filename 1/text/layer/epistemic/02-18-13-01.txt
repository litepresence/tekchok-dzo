<classification> Recognition-seeing teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Recognition seeing this—establishes that recognition sees directly and realizes the gnad. Statement: wisdom—wisdom's five self-resonance—indicates that wisdom's luminosity also flows. Gnad: recognition—this is upāya for recognition to rest in recognition. Risk of reification: treating five-lights as external illumination rather than awareness's own luminosity.

<classification> That itself rim-enclosing wall and individual main retinue appearance—Dharmakaya's purification completely pure measure-reached arising. This is rigpa-measure-reached appearance: preliminary times body's actions and doings' connection measure, afterward non-arising sign. Also: though appearing those appearances from preliminary antidotes etc. crucial point, labeled arisen, they are labelers of separation-result and purification-purifier cause-effect, not produced from that arising—wisdom self-existing radiance's stain obscurations purified through power of appearance. The Dzogchen view: these appearances are not produced by practice but revealed through recognition. Thal Gyur citation: Rigpa-measure-reached appearance: Sambhogakaya's marks examples clear; uncertain color rainbow from; five families father-mother appearing. Bstan bu: Likewise body up to: six and ten and five-three; unerringly Sambhogakaya. Individual nature: measure-reached definitive terminology generally shown and measure-three particular explained. First: rigpa-measure-reached means ground-abiding rigpa manifestly became, path-channel entered, ground-appearance's self-radiance spontaneous present arising-door body-appearance, path-appearance near exhaustion, mandala complete. Measure: first half-body to body's mandala complete. Reached: from that transcended without remainder clearly appearing. These like full moon form—waxing-waning mandala complete, self-face incontrovertible. Second, measure-three particular: outer appearance, inner body measure, secret rigpa measure. Dzogchen integration: measure is not quantity but recognition's fullness; reached is not destination but realization there was never anywhere to go. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: believing measure-reached is goal achieved through antidotes rather than recognition of ever-present wisdom.

<classification> Thigle-luminosity teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side. Statement: therefore—this is the gnad: recognition one precious. Gnad: separation's born child capacity pure—indicates that when recognition rests, the born child of separation has capacity to be pure. Risk of view-collapse: treating born child as literal birth rather than recognition-metaphor for arising display.

<classification> Thal Gyur purification teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side of Dzogchen view. Instruction: purification is purification—this establishes that recognition is purified through elimination of afflictions, not through accumulation of virtues. Gnad: therefore afflictions exhausted—this is definitive: delusion has never truly existed to eliminate. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating Thal Gyur purification as ritual practice rather than natural recognition of primordial purity.

<classification> Five-families teaching operates as instructional provisionality from sems-side for structured path. Teaching: also five precious ones—indicates that Buddha-families manifest as five qualities. Gnad: wisdom's wind completely pure seeing recognition's appearance—establishes that wisdom's wind is recognition's own luminosity appearing as five families. Gnad: recognition appears, exhausted—indicates that when wisdom's purity manifests, recognition recognizes its appearance and delusion is exhausted. Risk of reification: treating five families as external deities rather than recognition-display modes.

Statement: object—this is upāya describing how appearance has the object of established—not established. Gnad: recognition's object whatever appears. Gnad: emptiness is not established. Risk of view-collapse: treating circle-abounds as geographical location rather than recognition-display description.

<classification> Six-accumulations teaching operates from instructional provisionality for structured recognition. Therefore action of going around—six accumulations appear and go through awareness's meditative observation and arise—describes recognition's integration of perception, appearance, and action. Gnad: therefore action of appearance recognition going liberates—indicates that when action is applied to appearance, recognition going into recognition liberates. Risk of reification: treating six accumulations as metaphysical entities rather than recognition-descriptions.

Gnad: exhausted through recognition, not through path—establishes that exhaustion occurs through recognition, not through path. The teaching that therefore five wisdoms—indicates that five wisdoms manifest when appearance exhausts. Risk of view-collapse: treating exhaustion as temporal process rather than recognition of primordial purity.
