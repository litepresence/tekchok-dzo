<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Self-liberation principle—thoughts, emotions, appearances not transformed through antidotes but liberated through recognition of nature. Delusions self-liberated when nature seen, not technique but natural quality of awareness. Fire naturally burns, awareness naturally liberates. Liberation here is not achievement but nature—self-arising, self-freeing. The definitive register is unambiguous.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> All activity spontaneous, not performed by agent. Distinction between meditation and post-meditation dissolves; all activity is display of awareness. Spontaneity recognized in all circumstances: no separation between practice and its aftermath.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Natural meditation or non-meditation as essence—not activity performed by practitioner but natural state remaining in own place without distraction. Effortless and unfabricated, recognition that awareness naturally remains as it is. Resting is posited not as activity but as non-interference with what already abides.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Equal taste as fruition—all phenomena experienced as equal in nature of mind. Not philosophical position but direct experience of primordial purity. Beyond dualistic discrimination between pleasant and unpleasant, good and bad, samsara and nirvana. Equality asserted not as concept but as direct registration: all distinctions dissolve in the single taste of awareness.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Beyond action and agent—transcending duality of practice and practitioner. No practitioner separate from natural state, no action separate from spontaneous presence. Division into action and agent as conceptual imputation. Spontaneity (lhun grub) recognized as non-dual: no doer, no deed, only natural display.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Immediacy of recognition—liberation not future achievement but immediately present when recognition occurs. Path not journey in time but recognition in this very moment. Nature of mind already liberated; recognition in this moment is complete liberation. Immediacy without temporal mediation: recognition complete at the moment of recognition.

<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<classification> Three modes of self-liberation—liberation upon arising, upon recognition, without trace—progressively deeper levels. Not techniques to apply but descriptions of how recognition functions. Instructional provisionality of categorization.

[3201-3250]

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Natural meditation as continuous flow of recognition. Whether thoughts arise or not, whether emotions manifest or not, recognition of their nature as awareness continues without interruption. Beyond session-bound meditation: recognition uninterrupted by circumstance.

[3251-3300]

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Equal taste of eight worldly concerns—praise and blame, gain and loss, pleasure and pain, fame and disgrace—all equal in nature of mind. None can harm or help the one who recognizes this. Worldly dualities transcended not by rejection but by recognition of single nature.

<pedagogy>upaya-statement
<classification> Relationship between equal taste and ethical behavior. Equal taste transcends conventional distinctions but does not license harmful behavior. Natural expression of equal taste is compassionate activity, not nihilistic indifference. Upaya maintaining ethical engagement.
