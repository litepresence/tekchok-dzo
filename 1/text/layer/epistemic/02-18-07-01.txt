<classification> Definitive clarification of outer and inner objects operates from rigpa-side pointing to recognition's non-duality. Explanation: outer is object where rigpa dawns, inner is object where experience increases; because rigpa and experience are non-dual, it is called "samsara-nirvana mixed." This establishes outer and inner are not separate: object of recognition is not something other than recognition and experience. Warning: placing object on coarse earth-water-fire-air objects will not liberate—first, appearance does not want to dawn; later, when dawning, even knowing as coarse objects produces agreement, so emptiness-unthinkable experience does not dawn from within. Crucial: grasping at coarse physical objects as object of gnad, recognition cannot occur because coarse objects are already solidified by dualistic perception. "Emptiness-unthinkable experience" refers to direct recognition beyond concept of emptiness. Risk of nihilism: treating object as external to recognize rather than awareness's own display. Dzogchen view recognizes outer and inner are pedagogical designations pointing to same recognition. "Mixing" of samsara-nirvana is recognition they were never truly separate.

<classification> Definitive teaching on awareness and emptiness operates from rigpa-side of Dzogchen view. Opening: "having placed awareness-as-emptiness upon space-as-emptiness"—establishes non-dual basis where space, emptiness, and awareness are not separate entities. Subsequent analysis: experience-emptiness equal to space appearing as spontaneous-uncorrected display marks definitive mode—awareness never departs from its own self-display. Statement of purpose refers to recognition-function, not ontological status. Citation from sems sde on yoga's abiding in space indicates even provisional teachings point toward definitive ground. "Experience-emptiness consistent with space" establishes valid experience is inseparable from empty nature of appearance. Risk of nihilism: interpreting emptiness as mere absence rather than self-luminous expanse of awareness.

<classification> Threefold unity—appearance-emptiness non-dual view, appearance-awareness undifferentiated view, and appearance-awareness dissolved-into sameness taste view—operates from definitive rigpa-side. These are not three stages but single recognition described from different angles: (1) nature of awareness is display, not separate object; (2) awareness never becomes separate from its own display; (3) in that non-separation, samsara and nirvana are already same taste. "Expanse" refers to awareness's capacity to display; "awareness" refers to knowing quality; they are one nature, two aspects. Risk of view-collapse: treating expanse as empty container and awareness as filler rather than recognizing their inseparability as primordial state.

<classification> Wind-rig gnad presentation operates from sems-side pedagogy for practitioners who benefit from structured path. Instruction: relying on object and door together, when wind is calmed then hold awareness in concentration—this is upāya, not definitive truth. Explanation that wind becomes calm causes expansion outward and holding inward is provisional causal description for recognition preparation, not actual causation. Internal movement of concepts ceasing when wind is calmed creates conditions for recognition. Secret practice of awareness directly seeing accomplishes that even afflictions do not appear in that nature—all this describes experiential process, not ontological transformation. Goal "to fully awake" refers to recognition of what was never obscured, not attainment of new state. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating wind calming and holding awareness as mechanical techniques rather than recognition-facilitating conditions.

<classification> Citation from Thal Gyur and subsequent analysis operates from definitive rigpa-side. Repeated statement "by wind-awareness calming, wisdom is accomplished" appears three times. Crucial analysis: from fully releasing, body and mind connection dissolved, therefore even not reversed in three realms. This establishes definitive recognition: when awareness recognizes itself, body-mind duality never existed, so reversing it is meaningless. Three realms do not dissolve because they never truly existed as separate from awareness. Final statement points to direct introduction: awareness-gnad placed in middle between vessel-hook-continuum and expanse, make it not waver—"middle between" does not refer to spatial location but to recognition that awareness is neither grasping at form nor clinging to continuum but resting as expanse. Risk of reification: treating vessel-hook-continuum as entities rather than metaphoric descriptions.

<classification> Three eyes description operates as instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from structural recognition coordinates. Analysis continues from previous gnad: wind-rig method enables recognition of three-eyed viewing. These are not literal eyes but recognition's three modes of seeing: (1) seeing through dharmata-eye clearing latencies downward; (2) seeing through wisdom-eye looking evenly as same-taste of samsara-nirvana; (3) seeing through prajña-eye looking downward which settles wisdom-appearance. "Looking" directions refer to recognition's orientation toward aspects of itself, not spatial directions. Instruction that lazy ones need Sambhogakaya, diligent ones Nirmanakaya, equanimous ones Dharmakaya indicates different practitioners require different entry-points based on predominant capacity. This is not hierarchical division but recognition-variety. Risk of view-collapse: treating three eyes and postures as visual techniques rather than recognition-coordinate descriptions.

<classification> Citations establishing awareness as self-knotted operate within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Rang Ngo Rig Pa citation: "Self-face awareness like a snake-knot, held in sky through free from going-coming." Bstan Bu citation: "Within expanse, snake-knot, arranged but not separated." These establish Dzogchen view of awareness as self-arisen and self-coiled, not externally constructed. Commentary elaborates: through slow-wind reliance, meaning of separation from activity arises in continuum; awareness-knot placed in "A" syllable causes conceptual sources to exhaust, delusion returns to ground, mother-child wisdoms meet. "Mother-child wisdoms meeting" refers to meeting of primordial wisdom and recognition wisdom—not two things meeting but recognition of their inseparability. Crucial: "Awareness separated from wind, without going-coming, is awareness entering itself." This establishes recognition is not produced but discovered: awareness has never truly been separate from itself; apparent separation is wind-agitation, when wind settles awareness naturally enters itself. Risk of reification: treating snake-knot as actual entity to unknot rather than metaphorical description.

<classification> Detailed instruction for preparation operates within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Graduated practice: (1) If guiding, rely on body-gnad for five-six days; (2) Then apply gate for just that amount; (3) Then search field from six to seven days; (4) Then place direct actual on threshold and take as experience. This produces extreme training and meditative knowing. Warning: if by mixing and turning one sees appearance singularly, and when emerging from guidance without conviction, doubt arises without any speaking, therefore do not go that way. This indicates mixing practices without proper foundation leads to unstable experiences. Guidance-instructions: when placing this great guidance, go forth with effort to all predecessors, having purified, conviction arises in actual basis—not ordinary conviction but extraordinary certainty in recognition itself. When placing actual basis, special joy arises in direct perception. Post-guidance instruction: cutting off dharma extremes, knowing one can protect experience-taking, cutting off all doubts, one should not place... Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating stages as mandatory sequence rather than pedagogical presentation.

<classification> Direct pointing of awareness's self-face operates from definitive rigpa-side. Description: awareness as vajra-snake-knot, like golden thread hovering in sky, expanse-clear-light-appearance together—this unconfused buddha, primordial purity spontaneous presence self-radiance. Looking into state, all concept-creators pure, beyond elaboration like sky, radiance dawns within, knowing meaning of non-dual expanse-rigpa, prajna-born wisdom meets face-to-face. This is not description of attainment but recognition-instruction: snake-knot is awareness's self-coiled nature, never requiring unknotting; golden thread in sky is subtle self-radiance always present, not something to create; meeting face-to-face is collapse of recognizer-recognized separation, not event of meeting two entities. "Unconfused buddha" refers to awareness itself, never confused—only apparently so through dualistic perception. "Primordial purity spontaneous presence self-radiance" indicates three aspects: (1) primordial purity—never corrupted; (2) spontaneous presence—not created by causes; (3) self-radiance—self-displaying without external agent. This is declarative finality. Risk of view-collapse: treating golden thread as visualization to create rather than recognition of what is already present.

<classification> Opening statement on Samantabhadra and capacity equality establishes definitive Dzogchen ground: primordial state and individual capacity are already equal, not gradually achieved. Instruction that training to capacity causes liberation in light operates as upāya for practitioners who benefit from path-structure, but definitive view recognizes liberation is recognition of what was never bound. Threefold description—wandering through self-arising fields, six wanderings with confusion cutting the basis—are pedagogical descriptions of how samsara manifests from recognition-failure, not ontological states. Risk of reification: interpreting capacity equality as equal path-progress rather than recognition-availability.

Rhetorical question—who sees in this manner—and statement that Samantabhadra and capacity are equal—establish that recognition is available to all regardless of apparent difference. Thal Gyur citation on vessel-hook-continuum's self-arising and concepts all purified, non-delusion basis spontaneously expanding—describes nature of ground: appearance arises from itself, concepts are already pure, basis of non-delusion spontaneously expands. "Basis" here is not substrate but recognition's own nature. Risk of view-collapse: interpreting "spontaneously expanding" as gradual process rather than timeless quality of ground.

<classification> Five-light appearance mode teaching operates from definitive rigpa-side with instructional provisionality for recognition preparation. Description: outer five lights' self-resonance appearing in space, thigle and particles connecting to vessel-hook-continuum, analogy of stars not wandering outward, thigle containing five colors—these are recognition-descriptions, not visual objects to create. Statement "therefore one sees thigle" indicates when recognition recognizes itself, subtle display naturally becomes apparent, not through cultivation. Risk of view-collapse: treating five lights and thigle as visual phenomena to search for rather than self-manifesting qualities of awareness.

<classification> Awareness-gnad instruction operates from definitive rigpa-side. Point: awareness should not separate from vajra and vessel-hook-continuum—this is definitive instruction on non-separation: awareness is the nature and vessel-hook-continuum is the display; they are not two. Explanation: awareness is essence-nature itself, compassion-Three undivided, abiding in basis, and its light-resonance appearance—from root and branch like golden thread connecting to golden knot, connect with thigle. Final statement: Vajra from side of immovable abiding, all sentient beings equal good and bad nature and unchanging—establishes ground is impartial recognition, not state achieved.

<classification> Three similes establishing Dzogchen view operate within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Vessel simile: like good water vessel, water increases and decreases without arising, spontaneous presence without effort, body and wisdom increase, various path appearances appear without completion, arising from that. Hook simile: within that very one, dharmata's non-mistaken view and meditation are drawn. Continuum simile: pervading samsara-nirvana, from those gathered appearances, clarifying bodies, thigle dispersion, increase, gathering and so forth. These similes operate as instructional provisionality to point toward recognition. Risk of reification: treating vessel, hook, continuum as actual entities rather than metaphorical descriptions. Dzogchen view recognizes water increases/decreases without arising points to awareness's self-display not being truly caused; non-mistaken view and meditation drawn points to recognition being drawn into dharmata; pervading samsara-nirvana points to awareness's non-dual nature never truly separate from appearances.

<classification> Thal Gyur citation on fourfold appearance operates from definitive rigpa-side. Citation: "Slow wind-rigpa accomplishes wisdom; from that appearance becomes four—(1) dharmata actual appearance destroys intellectual grasping-view; (2) experience-appearance increase upward causes delusion-appearance to disappear; (3) rigpa measure-reached appearance transcends three-kaya realization-path-appearance; (4) dharmata exhaustion-appearance cuts three-realm samsara continuum." These four appearances are not sequential stages but simultaneous modalities of recognition-deepening: (1) direct appearance—recognition itself; (2) experiential increase—recognition's deepening; (3) measure-completion—recognition's fullness; (4) exhaustion—recognition's consummation. "Measure-reached" indicates recognition reaches its natural measure without exceeding or falling short. "Exhaustion" refers to exhaustion of dualistic perception, not exhaustion of awareness itself. This is declarative finality. Risk of view-collapse: treating four as mandatory sequential progression rather than recognition-descriptions. Dzogchen view recognizes these as awareness's own display, never departing from primordial purity, spontaneously self-liberating without effort.

<classification> Detailed enumeration of fourfold appearance divisions operates within ordinary cognition pedagogical framework. Statement: four appearances are definitely, then lists: (1) external sun-moon four-times increase-decrease; (2) internal body-speech-mind-consciousness four bindings liberation; (3) secret four-empowerments definitive showing; (4) suchness four-lamp appearances definitive, therefore looking at that four are definite. This establishes four appearances manifest on multiple levels: external (cosmic cycles), internal (subtle body), secret (empowerment), suchness (ultimate). This is instructional provisionality for practitioners who benefit from structural mapping. Risk of reification: treating four as rigid categories rather than pedagogical presentation of same recognition from different angles. Dzogchen view recognizes external sun-moon, internal four bindings, secret four empowerments, suchness four lamps all refer to same recognition displayed through different modes.

<classification> Explanation of definite sequence operates from sems-side pedagogy. Explanation: without seeing first ground dharmata-directly, remaining three have no arising-basis, therefore first dharmata-direct-appearance arises as support-base. When that itself dawns, seeing all dharmas' meaning, obtaining self-arisen wisdom from self—this indicates recognition is not attainment of new wisdom but recognition of what has always been self-arisen. Crucial instruction: that appearance if not taken as experience, no fruit arises from mere words, but experiencing the meaning causes that experience to increase upward. Therefore, measure of experience-arisen must be stabilized: without stabilizing no confidence enters experience, not holding dharma, no warmth arises—when reaching measure of experience-stabilization. This is instructional provisionality. Risk of view-collapse: taking first-then structure as mandatory temporal progression rather than pedagogical presentation of logical dependence. Dzogchen view recognizes sequence describes recognition's logical structure, not temporal unfolding.

<classification> Arising of awareness-measure-reached appearance marks definitive Dzogchen view. Crucial distinction: even when rigpa-appearance reaches measure, if it does not change into something other than that, it is not different from considering three kayas as fruition, and from apparent marks/signs one does not hope for meaning's fruition—indicates Dzogchen view does not treat three kayas as goals to attain in future but as recognition of what is present. Explanation: appearance-experience dissolves into ground, subtle-coarse appearance-grasping ceases, through engaging in primordial purity dharma-exhaustion, dharmata-exhaustion-appearance arises. This establishes recognition is not progressive but revelatory: when experience dissolves into its ground, grasping ceases, one abides in primordial purity, what arises is dharmata-exhaustion—not dharmata destroyed but recognition that dharmata has never been obscured. Detailed structure: first two are Nirmanakaya, measure-reached is Sambhogakaya, exhaustion is Dharmakaya. Through making them path-appearance, three kayas appear as path-appearance, and fruition dharma-exhaustion primordial purity reaches expanse. Conclusion: self-appearance's potency-three kayas dissolve into rigpa's state. Risk of view-collapse: treating dissolution as temporal process rather than recognition of timeless ground.
