<classification> Four-times equal-application (dus bzhi mnyam sbyor) to clear-light instructions. Four levels: outer—holding channel-wind in channel through body yoga mastery; inner—speech expression ceasing through speech yoga mastery; secret—unmodified mind settling through mind yoga mastery; suchness—mother-clear-light mixing with sleep. Practice methods extensive in Four Times Equal Application text; here summarized. Instructional provisionality providing recognition-support through temporal-practice correlation. Risk of view-collapse: four levels as hierarchical progression rather than simultaneous aspects of single recognition.

<classification> Clear-light four-times practice: daytime appearance sealed; dusk senses gathered to place; midnight knowable put in vase; dawn wisdom made clear. Samadhi and post-meditation. Samadhi: sleep-mixing with lion-sleep method, wind held gently; not blinking eyes, mind held on five-light mass inside heart; outer appearance gradually diminishing. Instructional provisionality of sleep-clear-light practices as recognition-vehicle. Risk of practicing as sleep-state manipulation rather than recognition that clear-light is always-present nature.
