<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<classification> Nirmāṇakāya essence: from expanse-kaya and rigpa, radiating as light-kaya, performing others' benefit. Self-Arisen citation: nine etymologies—appearing suitable to world-realms beings; able to perform emanation-kaya benefit; performing all actions; liberating numberless beings into expanse; brief time in one field realm; compassion arising without direction; wrathful and fierce; peaceful and certain; beings see as beautiful. Declarative assertion that Nirmāṇakāya is spontaneous benefit-activity, not manufactured method.

<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Nirmāṇakāya divisions: generally nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation; here depending on two benefits' completion—completed-actions emanation and performing-actions emanation. Self-benefit spontaneously accomplished completing-actions emanation: this life or bardo, completing spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate; through three connections emanation, benefit for impurity-gate six realms self-appearance; merely in self-appearance, thoroughly purifying six families, expanse peaceful. Self-appearance's saṃsāra must be emptied. Instructional provisionality of bardo recognition teaching. Risk of view-collapse: treating "emptying saṃsāra" as nihilistic destruction rather than recognition of never-having-been-established.
