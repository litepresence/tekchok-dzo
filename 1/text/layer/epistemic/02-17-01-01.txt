<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Framework establishing two pathways to liberation: those with object-mind (yul gyi blo can) entering through graduated method, and those with rigpa's self-appearance mind (rig pa rang snang gi blo can) taking direct experience. The distinction operates pedagogically—both paths lead to liberation city, but through different recognition-capacities. Risk of reifying the distinction as permanent typology rather than provisional orientation.

<pedagogy>negational-clearing
<classification> Twelve-yogin typology from Rang-shar tantra systematically clearing misconceptions. First eight types enumerated through negation: word-characteristic, sign-mere-holding, following-conduct, nature-definite, appearance-mind, enter-action, action-cause, doer-condition. Each progressively closer yet still missing direct recognition. Negational clearing demonstrating that no conceptual framework, no matter how refined, constitutes liberation itself.

<pedagogy>negational-clearing
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Extended negation of first eight yogin types through tantric citation. Word-yogin bound by conceptual fixation; sign-yogin trapped in symbolic interpretation; following-yogin attached to faith-grounds; nature-definite-yogin grasping at non-conceptuality as achievement; appearance-mind-yogin reifying mind as source. Each represents sophisticated misunderstanding—proximity to recognition without direct recognition. Risk of practitioners identifying with "higher" types while maintaining same grasping.

<pedagogy>negational-clearing
<classification> Continued negation of appearance-mind, enter-action, action-cause, and doer-condition yogins. Appearance-mind type reifies "all is mind" without recognizing mind's emptiness. Enter-action type bound by great deeds and causal accumulation. Action-cause type elevates tantra-path while still grasping at cause-result. Doer-condition type seeks authentic meaning through conduct while maintaining caste-distinctions. Clearing demonstrating that liberation transcends all systematic approaches.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<risk>reification
<classification> Transition to four liberating yogin types: end-arrive-fruit, authentic-meaning, end-arrive-liberation, done-complete. These liberate through direct recognition without dwelling in ground-path frameworks. Fruit-yogin sees self-thatness beyond path-progression. Authentic-meaning yogin obtains self-realization through bardo-appearance purification. Declarative assertion that liberation is recognition-nature, not path-traversal. Risk of reifying "liberated yogin" as identity to achieve rather than recognition to discover.
