Buddha-speech essence: Empty of sound, various dharmadhātu-appearance. Six divisions: great activity speech, Brahma's sixty-branch speech, six-realm self-appearance speech, beings' faith-pleasing speech, secret mother code speech, verbal expression speech.

Qualities essence: Buddha-ground's dharmas perfectly complete. Etymology—like wish-fulfilling jewel, all excellences spontaneously arise. Three divisions: ground-abiding qualities (dharmakāya self-settled, self-benefit complete); path-appearing qualities (saṃbhogakāya palace clear, other-benefit activity arises); end-guiding qualities (nirmāṇakāya guides beings, final dharmakāya union). Not sequential but simultaneous aspects.

Text colophon completion: Treasury of Supreme Vehicle, spontaneously accomplished results, twenty-fifth chapter pavilion. Extensive praise verses on text as wish-fulfilling jewel, benefitting beings. Dedication to text's long abiding in world, supreme vehicle's excellent path. Not mere literary convention but recognition of transmission continuity. Risk of reifying text as object rather than recognition-pointer.
