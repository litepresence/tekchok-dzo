<classification> Dream yoga preliminary practices: harsh-holding (rtsub zin) through fear conditions (water, fire, dog, enemy) recognizing dream-state. Emanation training: day-mind deity-forms, sentient beings, manifold appearances emanating one-to-many. Transformation practice: mutual god-naga transformation, male-female transformation, travel to unvisited places and realms. Instructional provisionality providing recognition-support through dream-state mastery. Risk of view-collapse: preliminary practices not dharmatā meaning—merely held dream and transformation not liberated from intellect truth-grasping. Important point from suppression commentary and dream instruction oral transmission.

<classification> Dream yoga main practice three-fold: dharmatā-meaning point, means, focus point, channel-wind binding point. Training, transformation, cutting—three practices with graduated difficulty. All three trained when guiding, though single practice sufficient for some. Dream training: day appearances recognized as last night's dream through clear aspiration; emanation-transformation made. Outer truth-without training: rigpa looks at arising-arising base-without, root-free nature—naked clear meditation. All fixation-without, truth-without, base-without, recognition-without—appearances' nature recognized, one-pointed meditation without losing effort. Appearances only actually illusion-dream arise; karma, latency, deluded-appearance, deluded-grasping all cease. Day-night dharmatā-wheel not beyond; dream-transform from appearance-emptiness two. Instructional provisionality of dream yoga as recognition-vehicle. Risk of practicing as sleep manipulation rather than recognition that all appearances are dreamlike.
