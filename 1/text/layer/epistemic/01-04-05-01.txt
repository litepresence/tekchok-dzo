<classification> Four visions of thodgal—progressive stages of spontaneous presence manifestation. Not achievements but natural unfolding of awareness. Direct perceptions of reality, not psychological experiences.

<classification> Four lamps creating conditions for visions—not causes producing effects but conditions allowing what is already present. Risk of reifying lamps as ontologically necessary.

<classification> Four visions: (1) direct perception of dharmata, (2) increase of experience, (3) maturation of awareness, (4) exhaustion of phenomena—all dissolving into primordial purity.

<classification> Four lamps: (1) hollow crystal tube—channels of subtle body, (2) smooth white channel—central channel, (3) far-reaching water—eye consciousness, (4) self-arisen wisdom—innate awareness as source.

These represent conventional supports for recognition, not the recognition itself. The Dzogchen view maintains that rigpa is present regardless of these conditions—though they provide support for those who need them.

The four visions (snang ba) are: direct perception of dharmata (chos nyid), increase of experience ('phel ba), maturation of awareness (smin pa), and exhaustion of phenomena (zad pa)—all dissolving into primordial purity where awareness recognizes itself as source and substance of all appearance.

These four visions represent progressive deepening of recognition: (1) initial direct perception where awareness sees its own empty nature, (2) expansion and intensification of visions as recognition deepens, (3) maturation into stable presence as obscurations dissolve, (4) complete dissolution of appearances into primordial purity—the recognition that there was never anything to attain.

The four lamps (snying po) create conditions for these visions: (1) hollow crystal tube—the channels through which awareness manifests, (2) smooth white channel—the central channel as pathway of wisdom, (3) far-reaching water—perceptual capacity as gateway, (4) self-arisen wisdom—the innate awareness that is the source.

From the Dzogchen perspective, these are skillful means for those who need them—not the recognition itself which is always present. The rigpa doesn't depend on these conditions but they help point to what is already here.
