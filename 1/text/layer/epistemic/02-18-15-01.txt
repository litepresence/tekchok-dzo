<classification> Recognition-gathering teaching—this is upaya: when recognition arises, cognition gathers completely recognition's appearance. Gnad: therefore recognition's experience spontaneously arises—indicates that recognition-experience is not something caused but arises naturally from dependence. Risk of reification: treating recognition-gathering as metaphysical entity rather than recognition-description of experience modes.

<classification> Nyingma tradition and treasure lineage represent two primary transmission streams of snying thig—the oral lineage and treasure lineage. Gnad: reliance on such masters guarantees liberation without doubt—this is upaya: when one relies on masters without doubt, the result is certain liberation. Risk of reification: treating reliance as faith-based dependency rather than transmission facilitation through recognition.

<classification> Dharmakaya's posture seven: body straight like arrow, mind space dissolving, appearance mind not different, empty clear not grasping, rigpa fresh not dull, six consciousnesses naturally clear, experience without separation. These seven are key points of posture, not the recognition itself. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: believing correct posture alone brings liberation rather than recognizing posture supports but does not constitute recognition.

<classification> Supreme gurus—these are ultimate authorities. Gnad: such ones have—establishes their supreme status and authority. Gnad: one relies—indicates singular focus. Statement: those who properly practice—this sets up upaya for proper transmission without deviation. Gnad: liberation—indicates that goal is actual liberation, not just correct understanding. Risk of reification: treating liberation from gurus as grace-based rather than recognition of one's own nature.

<classification> Sambhogakaya posture seven: body cross-legged vajra, channels not pressured, winds balanced, awareness clear not dull, appearances luminous, bliss warmth naturally arising, non-conceptual samadhi. The seven points support recognition but are not recognition itself. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating the form as sufficient without the view of recognition.

<classification> That reversed, outer confused-appearance ceases, inner body-mind heat arises. Both palms earth joining, changing karma-wind reverses. That reversed, outer thigle and thigle-drop dawns, inner day-night without experience arises. Neck mind slightly embrace, grasping karma-wind reverses. That reversed, outer body's appearance seen, inner wind's movement exhausts. Dharmakaya's dwelling also: sound explained: Lion three powers complete, to any not fear, body vital-point three realms fear dispels. Posture symbolism: the lion posture represents Dharmakaya stance—fearless, unmoving, all-vanquishing. This triad of postures mirrors three-kaya structure in somatic form. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating postures as ritual forms rather than recognition supports.

<classification> That returning outward delusion-vision ceases, inward body-mind warmth arises. Two palms pressed earth, moving action wind returns. That returning outward thigle and particles dawn, inward day-night without experience arises. Chin mind slightly raised, grasping wind returns. That returning outward body's vision sees, inward wind's movement exhausts. The postures reverse the winds, but this is recognition not technique. Risk of practice-misread_as_ontology: treating this as mechanical wind-control rather than wisdom-display.
