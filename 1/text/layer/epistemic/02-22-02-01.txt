<classification> Trekchö classified: definitive Dzogchen register cutting through grasping and solidity of mind. Unlike tantric completion stage's subtle body energetics, Trekchö operates directly on awareness—recognizing thoughts, emotions, appearances as self-liberated upon arising. Terminology—freedom from elaborations, unfabricated, self-settled—marks definitive meaning: no practice in conventional sense, only recognition of what already is. Longchenpa distinguishes Trekchö from lower methods: no visualization, no mantra, no meditation object—only direct recognition of awareness's own nature. Khregs: reification of experience, belief in substantial existence of self, phenomena, mind. Trekchö cuts through by direct recognition that all appearances are self-liberated—they leave no trace in awareness. Not analysis of thoughts or transformation of them, but recognition of their empty nature from the beginning. Hallmark: freedom from all philosophical positions—no view to maintain, no meditation to perform, only naked awareness. Direct path: cutting through all reference points to reference-free nature of awareness itself. Risk of practice-misread-as-ontology: treating this as practice to perform rather than recognition of what is.
