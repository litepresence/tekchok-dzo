<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<risk>reification
<classification> Five-yogin taxonomy from Rigpa Rangshar consolidating liberating types. First four liberating yogins from previous enumeration now encompassed within fivefold framework: great-potency-complete, prophecy-obtained, great-breath-emitting, body-mind-half, and karma-obeying-action. Fivefold classification demonstrating that liberation operates through diverse recognition-capacities—not single path but manifold expressions of single recognition. Risk of typologizing as fixed categories rather than recognition-modes.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<risk>practice-misread-as-ontology
<classification> Tantric verses defining five liberating yogins through Rang-shar citation. Karma-obeying-action: all beings of three realms already within this category—recognition that saṃsāra itself is wisdom-display. Body-mind-half: delusion-appearance ceased through truth-seeing—not annihilation but recognition of delusion's nature. Prophecy-obtained: certainty attained in spontaneous presence appearances. Great-breath-emitting: final faculties manifesting as tathāgata in emanation realms. Great-potency-complete: primordial purity unchanging, free from all effort. Declarative assertion that these are recognition-states, not achievements. Risk of practicing to "obtain" these states rather than recognizing already-present nature.

<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Vessel-possessing individual (snod ldan gyi gang zag) requirements for Dzogchen teaching. General qualifications: guru devotion, generosity, faith, wisdom, effort, ethical restraint, saṃsāra weariness. Particular qualifications: eight-fold suitability specifically for Atiyoga—faith in supreme secret conduct. Pedagogical framework establishing readiness-capacity for direct recognition teaching. Risk of using qualifications as exclusionary criteria rather than diagnostic indicators of recognition-maturity.
