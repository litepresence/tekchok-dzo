<classification> Tummo (gtum mo) generation instructions. Channel-point below navel, avadhūti fire-seed visualization—red essence sparking, fire blazing from touch-heat. Warmed within channels, crown HAM red-white bodhicitta dripping, pervading four wheels and body. Channel-wind-drop purified as water-one within four wheels' cavity. Heat and wisdom arising—supreme means of actual path. Wisdom-branch with other-body method assistance or independent bliss-drop blazing-flowing through channel contraction. Pedagogical provisionality providing recognition-support through subtle body energetics. Risk of practicing as physical heat generation rather than recognition of bliss-emptiness nonduality.

<classification> Wind practice entry into equal clear-light certainty. Thalgyur citation: depending upon wind, separate karma-mind; cut three realms' escape-hole; reverse body-speech fixation; equalize six realms' precipice; pierce body-speech-mind points; mix mind-itself with dharmatā; draw wind-awareness upward; exhaust deluded-appearance. Six-fold wind purpose as recognition framework. Instructional provisionality of prāṇa yoga as wisdom-vehicle. Risk of reifying wind as substantial entity to manipulate rather than dynamic awareness-display.

<risk>nihilism
<classification> Victory over means and obstacles through nectar and elements taste-equal. Nectar application: reverse smearing with food-beer, separating from ordinary smell; oil preparation from boiled essence. Thalgyur citation: essence extraction cutting body-arising continuum, reversing feces to cease body's outflows. Instructional provisionality providing recognition-support through alchemical transformation of ordinary substances. Risk of nihilistic misreading as substance denial rather than recognition of all substances as wisdom-essence.
