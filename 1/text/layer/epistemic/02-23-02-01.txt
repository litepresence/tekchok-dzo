<pedagogy>instructional-provisionality
<risk>practice-misread-as-ontology
<classification> Threefold ground teaching framework: contemplating difficulty of finding leisure/endowment (dal 'byor), contemplating impermanence/certainty of death ('chi ba), practicing meaning at needed time. Instructional provisionality establishing foundational prerequisites—recognition of precious opportunity creates urgency for practice. Risk: treating contemplations as philosophical exercises rather than recognition-facilitating conditions.

<risk>reification
<classification> Six difficult-to-find contemplations from sutric framework: difficult to be born (skye dka'), difficult to find (rnyed dka'), difficult to meet ('phrad dka'), difficult to enter (zhugs dka'), difficult to know (shes dka'), difficult to abandon (spang dka'). Causal vehicle pedagogy using impermanence and karma to generate renunciation. 'Phags pa klu'i dbang po and 'Phags pa zhi ba lha citations establishing authoritative foundation for leisure/endowment (dal 'byor) rarity. Risk: reifying leisure/endowment as substantial possession rather than recognition-opportunity.

<view>sutric-provisional
<pedagogy>negational-clearing
<risk>nihilism
<classification> Certainty of death ('jig nges pa) analysis—conditioned aggregates (dus byas) inevitably disintegrate. Bubble simile: aggregates like water bubbles that burst. Impermanence contemplation clearing attachment to samsaric appearances. Risk of nihilism: interpreting impermanence as meaninglessness rather than urgency for recognition.

<pedagogy>declarative-finality
<risk>view-collapse
<classification> Integration of ground teaching with Dzogchen view. Rin po che spungs pa'i rgyud citation: "Aggregates of coarse elements have no abiding place; life of firm person has no permanence." Declarative assertion that recognition of ground transcends impermanence analysis while incorporating its insight. Dpal mar me mdzad ye shes citation: "All worldly activity meaningless, causes of suffering—accustom yourself to looking at own mind." Risk of view-collapse: treating ground as metaphysical foundation separate from recognition.
