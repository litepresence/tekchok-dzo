Summary of channel-wind-wisdom relationship: Channels dwell in body, winds dwell in channels, wisdom and action winds move two-fold. Wisdom wind ripens nirvana; action wind ripens samsara. Avoiding refutation: objection establishment and answer giving. This section bridges tantric physiology with Dzogchen view preparation. Risk: prematurely collapsing tantric transformation framework into Dzogchen recognition without proper graduated engagement.
