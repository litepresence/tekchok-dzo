<classification> Opening passage establishing bardo as present reality, not future event. In primordial purity (སྤྱོད་ཡང་སྟོང་པ) no intermediate state exists (བར་མེད) - bardo is not place between death and rebirth but this very moment of non-recognition. That very self depends not on other dharmas before or after - no temporal sequence. Cannot enter any interval - bardo is not something to enter but the nature of appearing. From Thalgyur tantra: in primordial purity from very beginning, ground of confusion cannot be expressed; if so, what of unconfused? Risk of nihilism: misreading as "no bardo" rather than "bardo is rigpa's self-display."

<classification> Etymology of "bardo" (bar do): "bar" indicates center - central dharma of any upper/lower/before/after, like dream intermediate state existing between sleep and waking. "ma" indicates center; "do" (two) dwells in center like connecting rope joining beginning and end. This is instructional provisionality - using etymology to explain the conceptual framework. Divisions: common perspective (vehicles) asserts birth-death bardo, dream bardo, dharmata bardo, existence bardo. Uncommon vehicle (Secret King) asserts four: nature-remaining, death-time, dharmata, existence. This framework organizes experience for pedagogical purposes, not ontological categories.

<classification> Four bardo types in Secret King: (1) Nature-remaining (rang bzhin gnas pa'i bar do) - bound by five aggregates, five kayas dissolve; bound by elements/sense-sources, light/color dissolve; bound by karma/afflictions, pristine cognition/dharmata dissolve. (2) Death-time (chi kha'i bar do) - through element disturbance, outer body suffering; through mental factor loss, inner mind suffering; through grasping collapse, separation from appearances; through non-virtuous karma, fear of bad migrations; through cherished grasping body dissolution, fear of aggregate support collapse. Risk of view-collapse: treating these as sequential stages rather than simultaneous aspects of recognition.

<classification> (3) Dharmata bardo (chos nyid kyi bar do): abandoning aggregate support, body-wisdom appears; karma/latent tendencies cut, enjoys nature-meditation; faculty/grasper empty, exercises self-appearance clear-light. This is the bardo of dharmata - recognition of reality-nature. (4) Existence bardo (srid pa'i bar do): outer body as mind-body with faculties complete goes unobstructed; inner mind as think-doers enters; body-mind gathered goes unobstructed except two supports - vajra seat and mother's womb. Two supports: vajra seat as inner space of primordially pure unchangeable where all buddhas abide; mother's womb as impure samsara door in six realms - not literal but symbolic.

<classification> Four perversions (snang ba bzhi): not knowing nature of samsaric confusion-appearance like dreams/illusions. (1) Holding impermanent as permanent. (2) Holding unreal as real. (3) Holding cause of suffering as pleasure. (4) Holding empty-by-nature as entities/marks. These are the root of confusion - the four ways mind distorts experience. As antidotes, Buddha taught Four Dharmas for guiding ordinary beings. From Dzogchen view, these perversions are not to be "overcome" but recognized as empty appearance - the perversion IS the purity. The teaching uses conventional language while pointing to unconventional meaning.

<classification> Death-time bardo detailed: through body's elements disturbance, experiences suffering of outer body. Through mental factor feeling-path loss, experiences suffering of inner mind. Through grasping latent tendencies ocean collapse, experiences suffering of separating from life's appearances though attached. Through remembering non-virtuous karma of harming others, experiences fear of falling into bad migrations. Through cherished grasping body dissolved, experiences fear that aggregate support citadel collapsed. Thus remaining in suffering of fearing death through separating inanimate from consciousness by meaning. Risk of reifying these as literal experiences rather than recognizing them as mind's display in the moment of death - which is same as moment of now.

<classification> Dharmata bardo: abandoning support of aggregate self-grasping, dharmata of body-wisdom appears manifest. Connection of karma/latent tendencies cut, one enjoys dharmata of nature-meditation. Object of faculty/grasper empty, one exercises in dharmata of self-appearance clear-light. This is not "after death" but the recognition that happens when grasping dissolves. Declarative: dharmata bardo is this very moment when grasping releases - not future event but present realization. Risk of nihilism: misreading as "no self" rather than "no self-grasping" - emptiness is not void but luminosity.

<classification> Existence bardo: outer body as mind-body with all faculties complete goes unobstructed; inner mind thinks in many think-doers enters; gathered body-mind goes unobstructed in all except two supports - mind loose. Two supports: vajra seat (blessing-accomplished) and mother's womb (impure samsara door). The vajra seat is not literal place in India but inner space of primordially pure unchangeable where all buddhas abide in door of liberation from suffering. This is symbolic not literal - recognizing inner vajra seat rather than external location. Risk of view-collapse: treating support terminology literally rather than as recognition-metaphors.

<classification> Sutra places have two: provisional and definitive meaning. Intention and indirect intention - bound by four manners. Tantra adds two: literal and not literal - bound by six limits. These hermeneutical principles apply to bardo teaching - much is provisional scaffolding for those who need conceptual framework. Final meaning: bardo is not place but the nature of appearing when recognition is absent. Whether called birth-death bardo, dream bardo, dharmata bardo, or existence bardo - all are different aspects of same reality: mind's self-appearance when not recognized as mind. Declarative assertion: all bardos resolve into rigpa - the bardo IS rigpa appearing as various forms when unrecognized.
