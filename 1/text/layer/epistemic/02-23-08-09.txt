Fifth, liberation in primordial purity (lnga pa la ka dag tu grol ba)—complete recognition establishing ground. After liberation but before complete dissolution, emanation divides (sprul pa 'gyed). Emanation days equal meditation days (bsam gtan gyi zhag dang gcig go)—temporal equivalence indicating recognition-time and emanation-capacity correlate. Five moments joined individually with meditation days showing liberation mode of appearances. Citation from Rang Shar (Self-Arisen): various liberation modes—some liberate into five-light dimension ('od lnga'i dbyings), some into five-body dimension (sku lnga'i dbyings), some through five bindus (tsom bu lnga), some into mirror-like dimension (me long dbyings), some into encircling dimension (mu khyud dbyings), some through upper-lower bindus, some into empty encircling. These describe medium faculty liberation paths (bring gi grol lugs)—recognition modes accommodating gradual capacity. Risk of view-collapse: treating liberation modes as exclusive paths rather than recognition variations of single ground.

Medium faculty establishment of certainty (bring gi nges pa la 'jog pa)—seven days obtain certainty (zhag bdun nges pa rnyed). Five days abide in bindu appearances (zhag lnga tsom bu'i snang ba la sdod), one day in dharmadhatu (chos kyi dbyings), one day in mirror-like wisdom (me long ye shes). From own heart center one body arises (rang gi thugs ka nas sku cig byung), from that emanates countless bodies, recognition awakened therein becomes power, again like shooting star (skar mda' lta bu). Emanation can benefit for twenty-six days. Medium supreme takes eight days—five in bindus, three in four wisdom appearances—then various wisdom bodies spreading from above seen, certainty obtained like shooting star. Emanation can benefit for twenty-seven days. These enumerations are instructional provisionality describing recognition-stabilization periods, not fixed temporal requirements. Risk of reification: treating days as objective durations rather than capacity-relative recognition markers.

Detailed enumeration of medium faculty capacity levels: medium best (bring mchog) nine days—five bindus, four wisdom, then certainty obtained, all appearances realized like mirror, stability obtained, emanation benefits thirty days. Medium pinnacle (bring phul) ten days—five bindus, four wisdom appearances, one spontaneous presence, all bodies realized as non-dual, buddhahood, emanation benefits thirty-one days. Medium supreme (bring rab) eleven days—five bindus, five wisdom, one spontaneous presence, all appearances seen as light-house, certainty obtained, emanation benefits thirty-four days. Medium middling (bring bring) twelve days—five bindus, one wrathful body pure land, five wisdom, one spontaneous presence, stability obtained, emanation benefits thirty-seven days. Medium final (bring tha ma) thirteen days—six bindus upper-lower, five wisdom, two spontaneous presence, all appearances seen like butter lamp mandala, certainty obtained, emanation benefits thirty-nine days. Risk of view-collapse: creating hierarchical ranking of practitioners based on recognition speed rather than understanding all recognition equally primordial.

Transition to third section: six of final faculties (gsum pa dbang po tha ma'i drug)—twenty-one moments liberated (skad cig nyi shu rtsa gcig na grol te). Structural marker indicating completion of medium faculty presentation and entry into final faculty enumeration. Definitive meaning: numerical distinctions accommodate capacity without establishing hierarchy.
