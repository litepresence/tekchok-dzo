<classification> Youth vase body (gzhon nu bum pa'i sku) structure: essence abiding as body (ngo bo skur gnas pa), nature abiding as speech (rang bzhin gsung du gnas pa), compassion abiding as mind (thugs rje thugs su gnas pa). Life-wind with four limbs (srog rlung yan lag bzhi ldan) as abiding of five wisdom winds' essence in awareness (ye shes kyi rlung lnga'i snying po rig par gnas pa). From outwardly radiating resonance (gdangs phyi shar), five light appearances (od lnga'i snang ba) arise together with jewel cavity spontaneous presence resonance (rin po che'i sbubs lhun gyi grub kyi gdangs). Compassion awareness resonance investigating aspects (thugs rje rig pa'i gdangs rnam pa la dpyod pa'i shes pa shar ba) as not knowing own face (rang ngo ma shes pa), becoming foundational ignorance (ma rig pa) dependent on rigpa. Terms: gzhi ma 'gyur yang gzhi snang shar bas 'gyur 'gyur 'dra bar song ba—as basis does not change but ground-appearance arises changing, thus rigpa's display changes. Primordially pure display (ka dag gi snang ba) like cloudless sky; spontaneous presence eight modes of arising (lhun grub kyi 'char tshul brgyad) as self-appearance. Risk of reifying basis as container or location rather than empty-ground of display.

<classification> Eight modes of spontaneous presence arising ('char tshul brgyad): (1) Compassion like appearing, door not blocked (thugs rje ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas), compassion for beings arises; (2) Light like appearing, door not blocked ('od ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas), five wisdoms' self-rainbow-light fills display; (3) Wisdom like appearing, door not blocked (ye shes ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas), abiding in non-conceptual state; (4) Body like appearing, door not blocked (sku ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas), peaceful-wrathful light-body fills sky; (5) Non-dual like appearing, door not blocked (gnyis med ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas), not analyzing one and many; (6) Liberated from extremes like appearing, door not blocked (mtha' grol ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas), spontaneous presence clearly in own face; (7) Pure wisdom door like appearing, door not blocked (dag pa ye shes kyi sgo ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas), essence primordially pure display like cloudless sky appears above; (8) Impure samsara door like appearing, door not blocked (ma dag pa 'khor ba'i sgo ltar 'char ba'i go ma 'gags pas), six realms' display appears below. Eightfold gateway structure of spontaneous presence from single ground. Declarative assertion: all eight simultaneous aspects of single display.

<classification> Bkra shis mdzes ldan chen po'i rgyud citation: "Alas, though without wandering confusion, from my potency wandering confusion arises"—basis not changing (gzhi mi 'gyur ba), nature not ceasing (rang bzhin ma 'gags pa), compassion appearing (thugs rjes shar nas), non-determinate ground-spontaneous presence (gzhi lhun grub kyi gnas lugs). Like clouds in sky not truly existing, adventitiously arising—ground, path, rigpa not existent (gzhi lam rig pa yod pa cang ma yin), yet from compassion-appearing ignorance self-arises (thugs rje ltar shar ba las ma rig pa byung). Jewel casket (rin po che ga'u) metaphor: wish-fulfilling gem, eight aspects like wish-fulfilling jewel ('dod yon gyi nor bu rin po che lta bu). Inner youth vase body (nang gzhon nu bum pa'i sku) broken open (rgya ral), outer spontaneous presence abiding (phyi lhun grub kyi gnas lugs su gnas). Instructional provisionality of metaphor pointing to non-conceptual recognition.

<classification> At that time my display breaks outward (ngai snang ba phyi ral), morning-evening, instantaneous-momentary appearances—eight modes as self-liberated display. Ground-display (gzhi snang) appearing to self as not appearing to other, like dream display (rmi lam gyi snang ba ltar), flickering instantaneous (yar yud 'al 'ol sang seng du shar te), not recognizing own face (rang ngos ma zin pas), momentary instant (dar cig yud tsam mo). All beneath primordial purity (ka dag gi 'og na), spontaneous presence display (lhun grub kyi snang ba). Risk of nihilistic reading as denying appearances rather than recognizing their empty nature.

<classification> Below that: five clear light bindus and ray-dimensions (od gsal lnga'i thig le dang zer gdangs su snang ba) as great original ground (gzhi snga chen po). Below that: Sambhogakaya display (longs sku'i snang ba). Below that: Natural Nirmanakaya display (rang bzhin sprul sku'i snang ba). Below that: Six realms' display (gro drug gi snang ba) and taming-field displays (gro 'dul sprul sku thub pa drug). Impure Nirmanakaya display tamed by birth-aging-sickness-death (ma dag pa sprul pa'i sku skye rga na 'chis 'dul ba'i zhing snang). Eight modes as source-place ('byung ba'i gnas) of all these, like peacock's egg covering (gro ba'i 'bag skong lta bu). Thus called casket (ga'u'i sgra) teaching. Declarative assertion of hierarchical display structure as non-hierarchical recognition-facets.

<classification> Three kayas as pedagogical framework: Dharmakaya as essence primordially pure, Sambhogakaya as nature spontaneous presence, Nirmanakaya as compassion unobstructed. Not three separate bodies but three aspects of single display. Instructional provisionality of three-kaya structure for understanding recognition. Risk of reifying three kayas as ontological hierarchy.

<classification> Essential point: basis and display inseparable (gzhi snang dbyer med). Primordial purity and spontaneous presence co-emergent (ka dag lhun grub lhan cig skyes pa). Not sequential—spontaneous presence not arising after primordial purity, but simultaneous aspects. Display not other than basis, basis not other than display. Declarative assertion of non-dual ground.

<classification> Practical recognition: practitioner recognizes all appearances as spontaneous presence display—not rejecting impure, not grasping pure. Eight modes appearing in experience: compassion as natural response, light as clarity, wisdom as non-conceptuality, body as form, non-dual as beyond one-many, liberated from extremes as freedom, pure wisdom as primordial purity, impure samsara as requiring recognition. Instructional framework for applying view to experience.

<classification> Synthesis of basis teachings: All-ground (kun gzhi) as neutral ground of both samsara and nirvana. All-ground consciousness (kun gzhi rnam shes) as confused aspect. Dharmakaya as recognition aspect. Not two separate grounds but single ground with recognition or non-recognition. Eight modes as complete display of single ground. Definitive assertion: recognition completes spontaneous presence.

<classification> Distinction from other views: Not Cittamatra's dependent nature parinispanna. Not Madhyamaka's emptiness of inherent existence. Not tantra's transformation of impure to pure. Dzogchen view: primordially pure without transformation, spontaneously present without construction. Risk of view-collapse if Dzogchen reduced to lower views.
