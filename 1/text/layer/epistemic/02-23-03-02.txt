Second transference method: red A-letter technique (gnis pa A dmar por bcas te 'phang)—combining visualization of red A with consciousness projection. "Piercing upward" (gyen yal) indicates directionality toward crown aperture (spyi bo), ultimate gateway for consciousness exit in tantric physiology. Technical instruction: consciousness mounted on wind-vehicle exits through brahma-aperture. Final stage: projecting without conceptualizing anything (tha ma gang yang mi bsam par 'phang). Risk: literalizing as spatial journey rather than recognition of unimpeded nature.

Forceful transference technique for benefitting others ('phral gyi gsum ka la HUM du bsams te)—drawing another's consciousness into oneself through HUM visualization. "Wisdom drawn into my own rigpa" (shes pa HUM mthing ga bdag gi rig pa la drang) indicates tantric capacity to affect other's stream through accomplished practice. Physiological details: breath retention, forceful suction, subtle body intervention. Requires empowerment (dbang), samaya (dam tshig), and accomplishment prerequisites. Three doors opened (sgo gsum sgo phrad), breath held, drawn, projected—YAM A HAM seed syllable integration for body-speech-mind empowerment. Strengthening body and mind through repeated application. Risk of reification: treating as mechanical procedure rather than wisdom-display.

Recognition moment at death—when appearances arise, this is dharmata bardo self-arising, not external realm. "This is it—nothing else" (rang nang 'di ka yin gyis gzhan ma yin) asserts immediate recognition without seeking elsewhere. Three recognitions: appearance-recognition (snang ba de mthong), instruction-hearing (gdams ngag de go), certainty (nges pa rnyed). Non-conceptual samadhi attainment (mi rtog pa'i ting nge 'dzin thob) as Buddhahood certainty. Citation from Nyi zla kha sbyor (Sun Moon Union) establishing authoritative grounding. Risk: nihilistic reading as denial of appearances rather than liberation-through-recognition. Definitive Dzogchen: recognition itself is liberation, not result of practice.

Six signs of death and rebirth destinations (skye gnas kyi rtags)—external thermal signs indicating internal consciousness trajectory. Crown-heat upward (spyi bor drod 'dus): god realm (lha); sole-heat downward (rkang mthil): hell (dmyal ba); right-armpit (mchan khung g.yas): asura (lha min); throat (mkhar): preta (yi dwags); bluish vision obscured (mig rab rib): animal (byol song); eye-heat (mig tu drod 'dus): human (mi). Systematic correspondences between physiological dissolution and rebirth. Ordinary cognition framework: empirical observation for prediction, not recognition-based liberation. Behavioral signs: right hand moving, incoherent speech, left foot stamping, animal sounds, facial contortions.

Special animal-rebirth signs: armpit heat, facial contortions (mtshan mar 'dus pa), animal sounds, obscured vision—external-internal sign convergence. Purification rituals for rebirth destinations: three-fold timing (before death 'chi khar, at corpse ro la, afterward rjes la). Death-moment transference ritual from Nyi zla kha sbyor—A-letter visualization with breath coordination. Age-breath correlation: matching consciousness projection to recipient's lifespan (lo grangs rlung). Twenty-one recitations with breath-gasps projecting consciousness through crown aperture. "Even sinners drawn to higher realms" (sdig can yin yang mtho ris su 'drongs)—transference power transcending individual karma. Tantric methodology overriding ordinary causality through accomplished practice.

Corpse purification ritual (ro la sbyang ba)—elaborate mandala (mandala khru do pa), precious vase (rin po che'i bum pa), eight-petaled lotus visualization (padma 'dab brgyad). Samantabhadra (kun tu bzang po) with consort in rainbow palace ('od lnga'i gzhal yas khang), five-family buddhas (rigs lnga'i sangs rgyas), lineage gurus (bla ma brgyud pa). OM AH HUM svaha and A recitation (A 'bum phrag gcig) for consecration. Abhiseka mantra (OM A BHYARGATAM KEM CHE GE MO'I SDIG PA DANG SGRIB PA THAMS CAD SHANTIM KURU YE SVAHA) for purifying specific being's obscurations. Upaya framework: ritual as condition for liberation, not liberation itself. Risk: mistaking ritual elaboration for essential recognition.

Detailed corpse purification procedure: vase held at different body locations for different rebirth destinations. Crown (spyi bo) with TAM: from god realm (lha); throat (mgrin pa) with BHYA: from preta (yi dwags); secret place (gsang gnas) with RGYA: from animal (byol song); right armpit (mchan khung) with KEM: from asura (lha min); crown again with TAM: from god; heart (snying gar) with OM AH HUM SVAHA: purifying human rebirth. Wisdom nectar (ye shes bdud rtsi) descending from guru and deity body-parts filling vase. Three, five, or seven days of practice ensuring signs of liberation (rnam par grol ba'i rtags) appear in space. Sequential purification (rim pa'i gnas rnams 'phos) transforming lower realms into higher rebirths. Tantric upaya demonstrating result-vehicle methods operating differently from causal-vehicle karma.
