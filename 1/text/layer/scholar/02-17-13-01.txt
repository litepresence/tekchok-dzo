. Outer view: phenomena as without self-nature, illusion-similes, and vajra-eye.

[3709-3714] <structure>
Longchenpa establishes the outer view (phyi'i lta ba), the first of three views (outer, inner, secret). The structure follows a fourfold progression: (1) viewing outer phenomena as without self-nature (chos bdag med par mthong), (2) viewing with vajra-eye as eight similes of illusion (sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad), (3) realizing delusion not truly established ('khrul pa bden par ma grub), (4) mind at ease without doubt of returning to three realms. The structure demonstrates the progressive dissolution of reification through view.

 <context>
The outer view represents the classical Madhyamaka analysis of emptiness applied within Dzogchen framework. The citation from Nyi zla kha sbyor (Sun-Moon Union) validates: "Regarding objects that appear as referents, Whoever becomes familiar with them as without self-nature, By this, appearance and emptiness are non-dual." The eight similes of illusion (sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad)—dream, magical illusion, mirage, echo, reflection, city of gandharvas, rainbow, lightning flash—are standard Madhyamaka analogies for the empty yet apparent nature of phenomena. This reflects the Nyingma integration of emptiness teaching within Dzogchen.

 <philology>
The term chos (phenomena/dharma) carries its broad sense of all knowable objects. The compound bdag med (without self-nature) employs the technical Madhyamaka vocabulary of anātman/anātmya. The phrase rdo rje'i mig (vajra-eye) indicates the penetrating wisdom that sees through appearances to their empty nature. The term sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad (eight similes of illusion) refers to the standard set of analogies for emptiness. The phrase 'khrul pa (delusion/error) indicates the mistaken perception that reifies phenomena. The compound khams gsum (three realms) encompasses all of samsara.

 <concept>
The philosophical architecture here integrates Madhyamaka emptiness with Dzogchen recognition: phenomena are without self-nature, yet they appear—this apparent yet empty nature is itself the display of awareness. The concept of snang stong gnyis med (appearance-emptiness non-dual) indicates that these are not sequential stages but simultaneous dimensions. The "vajra-eye" represents the penetrating wisdom that cuts through reification—not destroying appearances but recognizing their true nature. The result—mind at ease (blo bde) without fear of rebirth—indicates the soteriological efficacy of this view.

. Rigpa Rangshar citation: outer appearance as miracle of self-arisen clarity.

 <structure>
This subsection presents the second citation from Rigpa Rangshar (Self-Arisen Rigpa), elaborating the outer view from a more direct Dzogchen perspective. The structure emphasizes: (1) sense-power of eye not ceasing (mig gi dbang po ma 'gags), (2) this as excellent view of mind (sems kyi lta ba), (3) self's own rigpa clear (rang gi rig pa gsal), (4) miracle of outer appearance (phyi snang 'phrul), (5) essence of concept-free clarity (rtog med gsal ba'i ngo bo), (6) knowing as great self-arisen (rang byung chen por shes). The structure moves from conventional perception through recognition to spontaneous wisdom.

 <context>
The Rigpa Rangshar citation provides the Dzogchen perspective on outer view: not mere intellectual emptiness analysis but direct recognition that appearances are the "miracle of outer appearance"—self-arisen display of awareness. This reflects the Nyingma distinction between emptiness as negation (sutra approach) and emptiness as luminous display (Dzogchen approach). The emphasis on "sense-power of eye not ceasing" indicates that perception continues but is transformed— Dzogchen does not negate appearance but recognizes its true nature.

 <philology>
The term mig gi dbang po (sense-power of eye) refers to visual perception. The phrase ma 'gags (not ceasing) indicates continuity—perception is not eliminated. The compound sems kyi lta ba (view of mind) indicates the conceptual approach contrasted with rig pa (awareness). The term 'phrul (miracle/magical display) indicates the wondrous, uncaused nature of appearance. The phrase rtog med (concept-free) distinguishes this from intellectual understanding. The compound rang byung (self-arisen) indicates spontaneous manifestation without causes.

 <concept>
The Dzogchen perspective on outer view is distinct: outer phenomena are not merely empty (Madhyamaka) but are the "miracle" ('phrul) of awareness's self-display. The concept of rang gi rig pa gsal (self's own rigpa clear) indicates that clarity is intrinsic, not achieved. The "miracle of outer appearance" indicates that phenomena are neither truly existent (eternalism) nor non-existent (nihilism) but the magical display of awareness—beyond both extremes. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching of kadag (primordial purity) and lhun grub (spontaneous presence) as inseparable.

. Inner view: dharmatā without arising, prajñā of single concept.

 <structure>
Longchenpa examines the inner view (nang gi lta ba), focusing on dharmatā (chos nyid) and rigpa. The structure describes: (1) viewing inner dharmatā with wisdom-eye (ye shes kyi mig), (2) realizing no mind of grasping in self-awareness (rang rig 'dzin pa'i blo med), (3) mind at ease in exhausted dharmas (chos zad kyi ngang). The Rigpa Rangshar citation elaborates: dharmatā and rigpa without arising (skye med), concepts naturally absent, rigpa without negation or affirmation (dgag sgrub med), free from action and actor, called great meditation (sgom pa chen po), prajñā of single concept (rtog gcig) leading to depth-confidence (zab gtad).

 <context>
The inner view represents the transition from analyzing outer phenomena to recognizing inner nature. The emphasis on "single concept" (rtog gcig) indicates that realization may arise from a single decisive insight—not accumulation of many concepts. The citation from Rigpa Rangshar establishes that this is "great meditation" precisely because it is free from action and actor—the dualism of subject-object has dissolved. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching that meditation is not something done but the natural state recognized.

 <philology>
The term chos nyid (dharmatā) carries its ultimate sense as the nature of reality. The compound rang rig (self-awareness) indicates awareness recognizing itself. The phrase 'dzin pa'i blo (mind of grasping) indicates the conceptual, appropriating consciousness that is absent in realization. The term zab gtad (depth-confidence) indicates profound certainty that transcends doubt. The phrase rtog gcig (single concept) refers to the decisive recognition that cuts through all complexity. The term sgom pa chen po (great meditation) distinguishes this from ordinary deliberate meditation.

 <concept>
The epistemology of inner view is crucial: realization comes through prajñā (shes rab)—penetrating insight that may arise from a single concept (rtog gcig). This reflects the Dzogchen teaching of chig chod (single cutting/decisive recognition). The concept of chos zad (exhausted dharmas) indicates not that phenomena are destroyed but that their apparent independent existence is exhausted—recognized as empty. The "great meditation" is precisely the absence of deliberate meditator and meditation—naturally abiding in the nature of exhausted dharmas.

. Secret view: non-duality of expanse and rigpa, primordial purity of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa.

 <structure>
Longchenpa deploys the secret view (gsang ba'i lta ba), the culmination of the three views. The structure emphasizes: (1) non-duality of expanse and rigpa (dbyings rig gnyis med), (2) Buddha not obtained by intellectual words (rtog ge'i tshig gis sangs rgyas ma thob), (3) saṃsāra-nirvāṇa primordially pure ('khor 'das ka dag), (4) exhausted dharmas (chos zad). The Sun-Moon Union citation validates: whoever sees expanse and rigpa becomes familiar with Buddha ground, no other method, surpassing distinctions of mind-grasping.

 <context>
The secret view represents the ultimate Dzogchen recognition: the non-duality of expanse (dbyings/space/emptiness) and rigpa (awareness). This transcends both the outer view (phenomena as empty) and inner view (dharmatā recognition) to the direct recognition that emptiness and awareness are inseparable. The citation from Sun-Moon Union establishes this as the ultimate method—beyond this, no other is needed. This reflects the Nyingma presentation of Dzogchen as the pinnacle of Buddhist practice.

 <philology>
The term dbyings (expanse/space) refers to dharmadhātu—the ultimate dimension. The compound gnyis med (non-dual) indicates transcendence of subject-object duality. The phrase rtog ge'i tshig (intellectual words) indicates conceptual, philosophical approaches that cannot achieve realization. The term ka dag (primordially pure) indicates that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa were never truly separate. The phrase sangs rgyas zhing (Buddha ground) indicates the ground of enlightenment, not a place but the nature of reality.

 <concept>
The philosophical culmination of the three views is profound: secret view recognizes that dbyings (emptiness/space) and rigpa (awareness) are non-dual—this is the Buddha ground. The concept of 'khor 'das ka dag indicates that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are primordially pure—not that they become pure through practice but that their true nature has always been purity. The statement that "Buddha is not obtained by intellectual words" reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on direct recognition over philosophical understanding. This represents the Dzogchen teaching that the ground, path, and fruition are ultimately inseparable.
