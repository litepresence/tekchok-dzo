## Wisdom Lamps: Appearances as Light-Ray Continuums

**Second Wisdom Lamp:**
- Appearances as continuums of light-rays ('od kyi zer thag)
- Five qualities manifesting:
  1. Subtle (phra ba)
  2. Moving ('gul ba)
  3. Wriggling ('phrig pa)
  4. Flickering (ltem pa)
  5. Blazing (mer ba)

**Third Wisdom Lamp:**
- Appearances dawning within the bindu's circle (thig le'i mu khyud)
- Producing upright-standing appearances (gyen 'greng)
- Spokes (rtsibs) radiating eastward and other directions

 <philology>
**Terms:**
- snang ba: appearance
- 'od kyi zer thag: light-ray continuum
- thig le: bindu/drop
- mu khyud: circle/rim
- rtsibs: spokes/rays

**Progression:** Second lamp presents light as continuum; third lamp presents light as center-periphery structure (bindu with radiating spokes).

 <context>
**Philosophical Context:** These represent stages in thögal visionary development. The five qualities (subtle to blazing) describe the refinement of light appearances as meditation deepens. The bindu represents the concentrated essence of awareness's self-display.

**Connection to Previous:** The first wisdom lamp establishes the foundational clarity; the second and third lamps elaborate the specific manifestations of that clarity as visionary phenomena.

This corresponds to the thögal progression from diffuse light (snam bu) to structured rays (zer thag) to concentrated bindu (thig le).

The "bindu" (thig le) is the essential point—the concentrated essence of awareness's luminosity, the pivot point where appearance and awareness are inseparable.

This is the basis for the "self-ripened result" (rang smin) presentation: the fruit is not something achieved but what is recognized as always present.
