Conclusive marker for the fourth stage in the bardo recognition sequence.

[35178] <philology>
*bzhi pa la rang snang du rtogs te bden pa'i stobs rnyed* — "Fourth: realizing self-appearance, obtaining the power of truth." *rang snang* (self-appearance) from *rang* (self) + *snang* (appear); *bden pa'i stobs* (power of truth) indicates liberation through reality's inherent force.

[35178] <context>
Final moment in the fourfold bardo recognition sequence. Culmination of progression from initial appearance through recognition to full realization.

[35178] <concept>
Self-appearance (*rang snang*) represents the Dzogchen view that phenomena manifest from awareness's luminosity without external cause. The "power of truth" accomplishes liberation through non-dual realization—spontaneous presence (*lhun grub*) dimension of Great Perfection.
