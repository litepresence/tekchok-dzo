. Four supports and three kāyas' postures: body, speech, and mind binding.

[4428-4433] <structure>
This section introduces the four supports or companions (rten bzhi) necessary for familiarization with the direct pith (thod rgal gyi gnad) to reach its measure (tshad). The structure presents four topics (gnad bzhi): (1) externally exhausting the appearances of the four emanations with their supports, (2) internally exhausting the increase and decrease of the four times, (3) secretly exhausting the changes of the four day-moons, (4) supreme emptying the ground of the four body-speech-mind-consciousness. The structure demonstrates the graduated approach from outer to inner to secret to supreme.

The citation from Ri bo brtsegs pa'i rgyud (Mountain-Stack Tantra) establishes scriptural authority: "If one desires to familiarize the direct pith, The pith is distinguished as four sections." This reflects the Nyingma understanding that thod rgal practice requires specific supports—without these, familiarization does not reach its measure. The fourfold structure (external, internal, secret, supreme) represents progressive deepening of practice.

[4428-4433] <philology>
The term rten (support/companion) carries its technical sense as the necessary conditions for practice. The compound gnad (pith/essential point) refers to the crucial instructions without which practice cannot succeed. The phrase tshad phebs (arriving at measure) indicates complete familiarization. The fourfold enumeration—sprul pa bzhi'i snang ba zad pa (exhausting appearances of four emanations), dus bzhi'i 'phel 'grib zad pa (exhausting increase/decrease of four times), zla ba bzhi'i 'gyur ba zad pa (exhausting changes of four day-moons), lus ngag yid sems bzhi'i gzhi stong pa (emptying ground of four body-speech-mind-consciousness)—demonstrates systematic progression.

[4428-4433] <concept>
The philosophical framework here is that thod rgal practice requires specific supports to mature. The four topics represent progressive transcendence: external appearances of emanations are exhausted (recognized as illusory), internal changes of time are exhausted (transcending temporal limitation), secret changes of moon-phases are exhausted (transcending subtle energetic fluctuations), supreme ground of aggregates is emptied (recognizing emptiness of all components). The concept of zad pa (exhaustion) indicates not destruction but recognition that these were never truly established.

. Body, speech, and mind binding: the three kāyas' postures.

[4434-4467] <structure>
This subsection presents the first topic: exhausting the pith of body and speech. The structure follows three aspects: (1) establishing the three kāyas' postures of the body (sku gsum gom pa), (2) speech not speaking anything like a mute (ngag ci yang mi smra ba lkug pa lta bu), (3) cutting the proliferating thoughts of mind's dispersion and gathering (sems 'phro 'du'i rnam rtog bcad pa). The structure then elaborates the three postures: lion (seng ge), sage (drang srong), and elephant (glang po).

[4434-4467] <context>
The citation from gSang spyod sa bon gyi rgyud (Secret Conduct Seed Tantra) establishes authority: "Thus having gone before, In order to look at the direct meaning, Body, speech, and mind are thoroughly bound." The Pearl Garland (Mu tig phreng ba) citation provides additional validation for the three postures. This reflects the Nyingma integration of body, speech, and mind practices as the foundation for thod rgal. The three postures—lion, sage, and elephant—represent different energetic configurations supporting different aspects of realization.

[4434-4467] <philology>
The term gom pa (posture) carries its technical yogic sense as specific bodily configurations that support meditation. The compound sku gsum (three kāyas) indicates that each posture supports realization of a specific kāya: lion posture supports Dharmakāya, sage posture supports Sambhogakāya, elephant posture supports Nirmāṇakāya. The term lkug pa (mute) indicates total cessation of speech. The phrase 'phro 'du (dispersion and gathering) describes the natural movement of mind that must be cut (bcad).

[4434-4467] <concept>
The somatic dimension of Dzogchen is emphasized here: realization requires specific bodily supports. The lion posture (seng ge'i chal)—typically sitting with legs crossed, back straight, hands in specific mudrā—supports the empty, vast quality of Dharmakāya. The sage posture (drang srong)—often sitting in meditation with specific gaze—supports the luminous, clear quality of Sambhogakāya. The elephant posture (glang po)—sitting with specific stability—supports the manifest, active quality of Nirmāṇakāya. The concept of sku gsum goms pa (familiarizing the three kāyas) indicates that these postures are not merely physical but activate the corresponding dimensions of awareness.

[4434-4467] <structure>
The concluding lines indicate that though the supports (rten) are different, through three different postures of a single body, the three kāyas are realized. This synthesis demonstrates the integration of physical practice with ultimate recognition.

[4434-4467] <context>
The scriptural citations from both Secret Conduct Seed Tantra and Pearl Garland establish the authenticity of these practices within the Nyingma lineage. The statement that "even with three thousand Buddhas, The fortune is equal" indicates the supreme value of these postures.

[4434-4467] <philology>
The phrase thod rgal gyi don (direct meaning) refers to the immediate recognition that thod rgal practice facilitates. The term bcings pa (binding) indicates not restriction but stabilization—body, speech, and mind are bound to their natural state. The particle yang (even) in yang stong gsum indicates emphasis—"even three thousand" emphasizes the supreme value.

[4434-4467] <concept>
The philosophical integration is profound: the three postures are not merely physical exercises but somatic technologies for realizing the three kāyas. The body is recognized as the support for enlightenment—not as obstacle to be transcended but as the very dimension through which realization manifests. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching of lhun grub (spontaneous presence)—the body, properly aligned, naturally manifests enlightenment.
