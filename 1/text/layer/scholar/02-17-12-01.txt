. Seven verbal views and the view of meaning: from concept to direct perception.

[3600-3612] <structure>
Longchenpa establishes the distinction between verbal views (tshig gi lta ba) and the view of meaning (don gyi lta ba), a crucial Dzogchen hermeneutical framework. The structure enumerates seven verbal views held by individual intellectual analysis: (1) action-free primordial liberation (bya bral ka nas grol), (2) effort-free primordial liberation (rtsol bral ka nas grol), (3) progressive stages of mind leading upward (sems kyi rim pas yar 'gro), (4) transcending virtue and vice (dge sdig gnyis ka 'das), (5) great non-doing and non-arising (byed med skye med chen po), (6) great unmodified self-purity (ma bcos rang dag chen po), (7) great self-arisen self-liberation (rang byung rang grol chen po). The structure then contrasts these with the view of meaning—vidya (rig pa) in its own immediacy.

[3600-3612] <context>
The seven verbal views represent conceptual approximations of Dzogchen view that practitioners may hold through intellectual analysis (shes rab). These are not wrong but provisional—steps toward the view of meaning (don gyi lta ba), which is direct recognition without conceptual mediation. The citation validates this distinction: "Regarding that, views are of two types: Verbal view and view of meaning." This reflects the Nyingma understanding that conceptual understanding must be transcended for direct recognition.

[3600-3612] <philology>
The term tshig gi lta ba (verbal view) combines tshig (word/speech) and lta ba (view), indicating conceptually-mediated understanding. The term don gyi lta ba (view of meaning) indicates direct recognition of the referent without conceptual overlay. The compound bya bral (action-free) indicates transcendence of deliberate practice. The term rtsol bral (effort-free) indicates spontaneity. The phrase ka nas grol (primordially liberated) indicates liberation without needing to be achieved. The term rang byung (self-arisen) indicates arising without causes. The term rig pa (vidya/awareness) carries its technical Dzogchen sense of direct pristine cognition.

[3600-3612] <concept>
The philosophical distinction here is crucial: verbal views are intellectual positions that approximate Dzogchen view; the view of meaning is direct recognition. The seven verbal views represent progressive refinements of conceptual understanding, but all remain conceptual. The view of meaning transcends them all—it is "not by prajñā" (shes rab kyis min), meaning not by conceptual wisdom, but "viewed as the very domain of sense-powers" (dbang po'i yul du bltas), meaning direct perception through the senses in their natural state. This reflects the Dzogchen emphasis on direct experience over philosophical position.

. Enumerated views: outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassed.

[3613-3640] <structure>
This subsection presents the enumerated views (grangs su bshad pa'i lta ba) organized into four categories: outer (phyi), inner (nang), secret (gsang), and unsurpassed (bla na med). The structure describes: outer view as eight progressive mental preferences held as intellectual apprehension; inner view as seeing essence and nature as illusory; secret view as seeing the linked-chain connection (lu gu rgyud) in self-awareness; unsurpassed view as suchness going to expanse-vidya. This fourfold structure represents progressive deepening from conceptual to direct recognition.

[3613-3640] <context>
The citation from Thal 'gyur provides scriptural authority for this fourfold schema: "Enumerations of expressed words and names: Outer, inner, secret, And unsurpassed view—these four." This reflects the Nyingma presentation of graduated approaches to view, accommodating different capacities. The eight progressive mental preferences ('phel phyogs yid dpyod brgyad) represent the gradual path of conceptual refinement, while the inner, secret, and unsurpassed views transcend conceptuality progressively.

[3613-3640] <philology>
The term grangs su bshad pa (enumerated/explained by numbers) indicates systematic presentation. The compound phyi lta (outer view) refers to conventional conceptual understanding. The term nang lta (inner view) indicates deeper insight into dharmatā. The term gsang lta (secret view) refers to recognition of the subtle connection between all phenomena. The term bla na med pa'i lta ba (unsurpassed view) indicates the ultimate Dzogchen recognition. The phrase lu gu rgyud (linked chain) metaphorically indicates the interconnected nature of awareness. The term chos nyid dbyings rig (dharmatā expanse-vidya) indicates the ultimate non-dual recognition.

[3613-3640] <concept>
The four views represent progressive transcendence of conceptuality: outer view uses concepts (eight mental preferences); inner view sees through concepts (essence and nature as illusory); secret view recognizes the non-dual nature of all experience (linked-chain connection); unsurpassed view is the direct recognition of dharmatā as expanse-vidya. This progression reflects the Dzogchen teaching that view must be refined until it becomes recognition—philosophical understanding must dissolve into direct perception.

[3641-3651]
. Three views of nature: abiding, pure-seeing, and without fabrication.

[3641-3651] <structure>
This final subsection presents three views of nature (rang bzhin gyi lta ba): (1) view of abiding (gnas lta) that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are primordially liberated, (2) view of pure-seeing (dag snang) that transcends cause, effect, action, and effort, (3) view without fabrication (ma bcos) that is great vastness liberation from extremes. The structure moves from recognition of primordial liberation through transcendence of causality to ultimate non-fabrication.

[3641-3651] <context>
The three views of nature represent the culmination of the view presentation—direct recognition without conceptual overlay. The citation validates: "Moreover, dharmatā wheel is explained. The view of abiding realizes all dharmas, Nature pure, dividing saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, Without doing, losing arising." This reflects the Nyingma presentation of view as recognition rather than position—the view is not something to hold but something to recognize.

[3641-3651] <philology>
The term rang bzhin (nature) carries its technical sense as the intrinsic quality of phenomena. The compound gnas lta (view of abiding) indicates recognition of how things actually are. The term dag snang (pure vision) indicates perception untainted by delusion. The phrase rgyu 'bras las 'brel (cause-effect-action) represents the conventional framework that is transcended. The term ma bcos (without fabrication/modification) indicates recognition without deliberate alteration. The compound mtha' grol (liberation from extremes) indicates transcendence of all conceptual polarities.

[3641-3651] <concept>
The philosophical synthesis here presents the ultimate Dzogchen view: saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not different realms but different modes of recognition—primordially liberated means they were never truly separate. Pure-seeing transcends causality not by denying it but by recognizing its empty nature. The view without fabrication indicates that nothing needs to be done—recognition is immediate, not constructed. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching of ka dag (primordial purity)—everything is already perfect, requiring only recognition.
