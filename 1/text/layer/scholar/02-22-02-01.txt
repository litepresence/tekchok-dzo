. The expanse (klong): essential nature, divisions, characteristics, and result.

[10766-10777] <structure>
Longchenpa establishes the fivefold analysis of the expanse (klong): essential nature (ngo bo), definitive terms (nges tshig), divisions (dbye ba), characteristics (mtshan nyid), and result ('bras bu). The structure follows the standard Nyingma scholastic framework for analyzing key concepts.

 <philology>
The term klong (expanse/vastness) indicates the dimension of awareness that is without center or periphery, like space. The compound gsal ba'i bdag nyid chen po (great identity of clarity) emphasizes the luminous (gsal) nature of the expanse. The phrase nges tshig (definitive term) carries the sense of precise semantic definition. The divisions into outer expanse (space), inner expanse (lamp), secret expanse (light and bindu), and unsurpassed expanse (great display) demonstrate systematic taxonomy.

 <context>
The fivefold analysis reflects the Nyingma penchant for comprehensive definition, ensuring that concepts are understood from all angles. The progression from outer to secret to unsurpassed expanse indicates the movement from gross to subtle to ultimate. The citation from Blazing Reliquary (sku gdung 'bar ba) provides scriptural authority for the signs that arise through familiarity with the expanse.

 <concept>
The ontology of the expanse presented here is carefully non-reified: dharmatā is not a "thing" (dngos po) but "that which brings forth the power to clarify" (gsal byed nus pa 'byin pa). This reflects the Dzogchen understanding that the ground is not a substance but a capacity—the capacity for awareness to know itself. The mirror metaphor (gsal zhing zab pa'i me long) indicates that the expanse reflects all phenomena without being affected by them.

[10777-10793] <structure>
The core section elaborates the characteristics: the expanse opens to the vast, has the capacity to appear, and pervades—appearing as the domain of clarity like a clear deep mirror.

[10793-10809] <structure>
The conclusion presents the result: through familiarity with the expanse, external wondrous signs manifest—breath and movement exhausted, proceeding like bird through space or fish through water, beholding unseen lands, Mount Meru, and Buddha-fields from a single seat.

. Internal visionary signs: thirteen indicators of approaching nirvana.

 <structure>
This section enumerates thirteen internal visionary signs (nang gi snang ba'i rtags) that indicate the practitioner is approaching complete nirvana (yongs su mya ngan las 'da' ba). The structure presents these as diagnostic indicators arising from the heart-mirror of Vajrasattva.

 <philology>
The term yongs su mya ngan las 'da' ba (complete nirvana) carries the technical meaning of full buddhahood beyond the Hinayana conception of cessation. The phrase snying gi me long (heart-mirror) indicates the heart center as the locus where these signs arise. The enumerated signs employ simple descriptive language: sitting alone experiencing bliss (glang du bde ba myong), body light as cotton leaf (ras bal ltar yang ba), feeling as if flying (nam mkha' la 'phyo ba'i 'du shes).

 <context>
The thirteen signs reflect the phenomenology of advanced practice: disengagement from social interaction, physical lightness, joy at cessation of appearances, non-attachment to body and life, non-engagement with phenomena, clarity without dullness, natural relaxation of cognition, happiness in company, immunity to afflictions, non-grasping of arisen afflictions, equanimity toward beautiful and ugly forms, transcendence of hunger/thirst through samadhi, and non-harmony with others' deluded minds. These indicate not pathology but spiritual maturation.

 <context>
The sign of "no desire to be with others" (mi dang 'grogs par mi 'dod) and "happiness when with others" (mi dang 'grogs par dga' ba) appear contradictory but indicate flexibility—the advanced practitioner is equally comfortable in solitude or company. The "perception of joy when appearances cease" (snang ba 'gags par 'gyur snyam pa la dga' ba) indicates progress toward the Dzogchen goal of recognizing appearances as self-liberated.

 <concept>
The epistemology of signs (rtags) suggests that spiritual progress has objective indicators that can be recognized by the practitioner and confirmed by qualified teachers. These signs are not the goal but diagnostic instruments—like a fever thermometer indicating health status. The concept of "not grasping arisen afflictions as thoughts" (nyon mongs skyes kyang rtog tu mi 'dzin) indicates that while afflictions may still arise in the mindstream, they are immediately self-liberated without entering the chain of conditioning.
