[578-585] Introduction to the Thirteen Buddha-fields

<structure>
The passage establishes the cosmological framework of infinite Buddha-fields (*zhing khams dpag tu med pa*) manifesting from the five families (*rigs lnga*) of the Dharmakaya. The structure centers on Vairocana (*rnam par snang mdzad*) as the core (*snying po*), surrounded by twenty-five stacked levels (*nyi shu rtsa lnga brtsegs mar*), with our world-system (*mi mjed 'di*) situated at the thirteenth level. This creates a vertical hierarchy of above (*steng*), below (*'og*), and intermediate directions (*phyogs mtshams*) where the thirteen fields are distributed.

<philology>
Key terminological elements include: *zhing khams* (Buddha-field), *rgya khyon* (extent/expanse), *bkod pa* (arrangement/adornment), *thal ba* (aspiration/resonance/echo), *bzang thal* (directly manifest/clear), *mchod rten* (stupa), *bang rim* (terraces), and *zang thal snang* (directly apparent). The term *thal ba* pervades the field names, suggesting these realms represent different modalities or resonances of enlightened aspiration. The *sga thal 'gyur* (Sound Tantra) citation marks this as a tantric cosmological schema.

<context>
This passage bridges the general Mahayana concept of infinite Buddha-fields with a specific Dzogchen tantric enumeration. The sGra thal 'gyur citation (lines 586-634) provides authoritative scriptural grounding for the thirteen-field system. The cosmology places Saha-world (*mi mjed*) at the thirteenth level, nested within a jeweled lotus (*padma rin po che*) structure. The "twenty-five stacked" arrangement suggests a correlation with the twenty-five Dzogchen disciples or aspects of primordial wisdom.

<concept>
The thirteen fields represent progressive dimensions or aspects of enlightened manifestation, with Vairocana's central field (*dbus ma*) as the organizing principle. The vertical arrangement (below six worlds, above the twenty-first level) maps enlightenment onto a cosmic axis. Each field carries specific characteristics: visual splendor (*rgya khyon dpag dka' rab tu mdzes*), doctrinal associations (*ston pa'i bstan pa*), and formal properties (*'khor lo'i dbyibs*, *padma rgyas pa'i dbyibs*). The fields function both as ontological realities and as stages of realization, with our world serving as the accessible entry point into this mandala of aspiration.

[586-634] 'gyur Citation: The Thirteen Buddha-fields

<structure>
The enumeration follows a precise spatial and numerical schema distributed across the cosmic hierarchy:

1. **Below six worlds** (*'jig rten drug 'og na*): Thal ba dbyangs (lines 589-594) - "Resounding Aspiration," circular/wheel-shaped, first in the series

2. **Further below** (*de nas 'jig rten drug 'og na*): Thal ba 'dzin (lines 596-599) - "Holding Aspiration," holding the wheel-form, second arrangement

3. **Right of three worlds** (*'jig rten gsum gyas na*): Thal ba skyob (lines 601-605) - "Protecting Aspiration," adorned by mothers (*ma rgod*), discipline-field (*'dul ba'i zhing*)

4. **Above six worlds** (*'jig rten drug gi steng*): Thal ba brdal (lines 607-614) - "Spreading Aspiration," lotus-expanded form, subtle without coarse reflections

5. **Above, beyond nineteen** (*bcu dgu 'das pa'i yang steng na*): Thal ba'i be con (lines 617-622) - "Hammer of Aspiration," gem-adorned mounds, possessing two perfections

6. **North-east direction** (*byang shar mtshams*): Thal ba'i rgyun (lines 624-628) - "Stream of Aspiration," stupa-shaped with five terraces, source of manifold sounds

7. **Above that, at twenty-one** (*de steng nyi shu rtsa gcig na*): Rab tu thal bas khyab (lines 630-634) - "Pervaded by Great Aspiration," pure perception-nature without inner/outer, directly apparent

<philology>
The term *thal ba* (resonance/aspiration/echo) forms the semantic core: *thal ba dbyangs* (resounding/sounding aspiration), *thal ba 'dzin* (holding/containing aspiration), *thal ba skyob* (protecting/sheltering aspiration), *thal ba brdal* (spreading/diffusing aspiration), *thal ba'i be con* (hammer/mallet of aspiration—suggesting forceful impact), *thal ba'i rgyun* (stream/continuity of aspiration), and *rab tu thal bas khyab* (pervaded by supreme aspiration). 

Spatial terminology: *rgya khyon* (expanse/extent), *dpag dka'* (immeasurable), *bkod pa* (arrangement), *zang thal* (directly clear/apparent), *dpag tu med pa* (infinite), *steng 'og* (above-below), *phyogs mtshams* (intermediate directions). 

Formal descriptors: *'khor lo'i dbyibs* (wheel-shaped), *padma rgyas pa'i dbyibs* (lotus-expanded shape), *mchod rten dbyibs* (stupa-shaped), *bang rim* (terraced levels).

<context>
The sGra thal 'gyur (Sound Tantra) is one of the Seventeen Tantras (*rgyud bcu bdun*) of the Upadesa class in the Dzogchen tradition. This citation represents a systematic cosmological teaching mapping Buddha-fields onto a vertical axis with Saha-world (*mi mjed*) as the reference point. Each field correlates with specific doctrinal teachings (*ston pa'i bstan pa*): causes and conditions (*rgyu dang rkyen*), discipline (*'dul ba*), aggregates (*'dus mched*), two perfections (*rdzogs gnyis ldan*), and temporal manifestation (*dus 'byung*). The twenty-one level for the seventh field suggests Dzogchen numerology (twenty-one primary manifestations of primordial wisdom).

<concept>
The thirteen fields constitute a mandala of enlightened aspiration, each representing different modalities of buddha-activity:

**Thal ba dbyangs** (Resounding Aspiration): Located beneath the six worlds, this field embodies the fundamental resonance of enlightenment. Its wheel-form (*'khor lo'i dbyibs*) and immeasurable extent (*rgya khyon dpag dka'*) indicate its encompassing nature. As the first field, it establishes the primordial sound/aspiration that reverberates through all realms.

**Thal ba 'dzin** (Holding Aspiration): Positioned further below, this field "holds" or contains the aspiration in a wheel-form (*zang thal lo*), suggesting it preserves and maintains the enlightened intent across cosmic distances.

**Thal ba skyob** (Protecting Aspiration): Located to the right of the three worlds, this field is characterized by maternal protection (*ma rgod dag gis yongs spras pa*) and serves as the field of discipline (*'dul ba'i zhing*). The "mothers" (*ma rgod*) suggest protective dakini principles, while the emphasis on individual karma (*so so'i las*) and marks (*mtshan*) indicates it preserves the particularities of spiritual practice.

**Thal ba brdal** (Spreading Aspiration): Situated above the six worlds, this field takes the form of an expanded lotus (*padma rgyas pa'i dbyibs*), perfectly even (*khod snyoms pa*), radiating manifold light and color. The absence of coarse reflections (*rag gi gzugs brnyan snang ba min*) indicates a subtle realm beyond ordinary perception, where the aggregates (*'dus mched*) flourish.

**Thal ba'i be con** (Hammer of Aspiration): Located nineteen levels above our world, this field appears as a delightful expansive realm (*rab tu ljongs te nyams dga' ba*) adorned with various precious fragments (*rin chen sil ma sna tshogs*). The "hammer" imagery suggests the forceful impact of enlightened aspiration. Its possession of two perfections (*rdzogs gnyis ldan*) and skull-garland arrangement (*thod pa'i phreng ba bkod pa*) mark it as a high tantric field.

**Thal ba'i rgyun** (Stream of Aspiration): Positioned in the north-east direction, this field resembles a stupa (*mchod rten dbyibs 'dra*) with beautiful terraces (*bang rim mdzes*), adorned by five arrangements (*bkod pa lnga yis yongs su spras*). As the source of manifold sounds (*sgra dbyangs sna tshogs 'byung ba'i gzhi*), it relates to temporal manifestation (*dus 'byung*), suggesting the continuous flow of enlightened time.

**Rab tu thal bas khyab** (Pervaded by Great Aspiration): Situated at the twenty-first level above, this supreme field embodies pure perception (*dmigs pa dag pa'i rang bzhin*), appearing without inner or outer division (*phyi dang nang med*), directly manifest (*zang thal snang*). It demonstrates the arising of buddha-activity (*byed pa'i rgyu rkyen khyab 'jug*), representing the culmination where aspiration thoroughly pervades all dimensions.

Together, these seven named fields (along with six implied others) form a complete mandala of enlightened manifestation, with our Saha-world serving as the gateway through which practitioners access these progressively subtler dimensions of awakened reality.
