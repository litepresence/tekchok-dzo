Nor Bu 'Phrul Bskod Citation
**Analysis:** From *Nor bu 'phrul bkod chen po'i rgyud*: "Kye ma! Listen divine race, I teach well retain mind" (*kye ma nyon cig lha yi rigs / ngas bstan legs par yid la zung*). "Appearance mandala great this, all teach not do, secret capable some teach" (*snang ba'i dkyil 'khor chen po 'di / kun la bstan par mi bya ste / gsang ba thub pa 'ga' la bstan*). "Secret mantra secret supreme this, teach race thus: secret yearning capable make, secret meaning respect, wisdom intelligence great, samaya vow possess teach" (*gsang sngags gsang ba'i dam pa 'di / bstan pa'i rigs ni 'di lta ste / gsang ba'i gnyer gtad thub par byed / gsang ba'i don la gus pa dang / shes rab blo rtsal che ba dang / dam tshig sdom pa ldan la bstan*).

Definite scripture rgyal khu byug mchog. Person's race, conduct great, color characteristic three asked. Buddha Vajradhara from samadhi arose, special retinue commanded: "Kye ma!

Race distinction thus: royal race and brahmin race, likewise great merchant race, especially great persons, secret mantra definite meaning teach speak.

Physical Marks of the Suitable Vessel
**Analysis:** The *Rang Shar* tantra enumerates the physical characteristics marking one as a suitable vessel (*snod*) for Great Perfection teachings. These are not social privileges but somatic indicators of subtle body capacity:

**Physical Marks:**
- Male or female (*pho mo gnyis*)—gender non-specific
- Specific coloration (*kha dog 'di dang ldan pa*) indicating constitutional type
- Thick limbs (*yan lag rags shing*)
- Nose with good coloration (*kha dog*)
- Teeth white like conch (*so nyid thags bzangs dkar la 'dril*)
- Eye corners slightly red (*mig rtsa yid tsam dmar ba*)
- Hair characteristics: curls to the right (*g.yas su 'khyil*), black color (*kham nag mdog*)
- Small body/limited stature (*lus la bkur sti chung ba*)—not imposing presence
- Ordinary external conduct (*phyi yi spyod lam tha mal mdog*)
- Forceful speech (*tshig rnams shugs byung smra ba*) or the ability to mirror others' speech patterns (*gcig gis gang ltar smras pa ltar*)

These marks indicate a constitution capable of sustaining the energetic transformations of Dzogchen practice, not social status.

[22385-22400] <concept>
Caste Irrelevance in Dzogchen Transmission
**Analysis:** When the above qualities are complete (*de rnams gcig la tshang ba na*), social origin becomes irrelevant. Longchenpa lists the lowest castes:
- Butcher caste (*shan pa'i rigs*)
- Prostitute caste (*smad 'tshong rigs*)
- Chāṇḍāla/untouchable caste (*phyags dar khrod pa'i rigs*)
- Any low caste (*rigs ngan gang dag*)

The secret instruction essence (*gsang ba'i man ngag bcud*) is given regardless. The phrase *rgyu chung* (small cause) indicates the practitioner brings minimal resources—using only their own provisions (*rang gi yo byad*) and giving completely without remainder (*lhag ma med par yongs su sbyin*).

The lineage (*rigs*) and color examination methods (*kha dog brtag thabs*) are part of the esoteric transmission. Longchenpa notes that after his parinirvāṇa (*mya ngan 'das 'og tu*), this secret instruction essence (*yang bcud*) will be taught to the definitive king (*nges pa'i rgyal po*)—the qualified practitioner.

Two Practice Methods
**Analysis:** Second: how experience-take manner definite, practice manner two: wandering manner practice and deer manner practice. First: own place abandon, other place go, whoever own name good bad, what know not-know etcetera face not-know make, normal pretend, food clothes begging live, cave village little go or secluded or inn etcetera without sign practice. This time own excellence name not-boast, desire not mark. Other guru dharma etcetera hint not do, own instruction faith doubt not mark.

 <structure>
Two Modes of Practice
**Analysis:** The text transitions to the second topic (*don gnyis pa*): how to practice experientially. Two modes (*bsgrub lugs gnyis*):

1. **Wandering Yogi Style** (*sprang po'i tshul*): Abandon own locale, go to other regions. Make it so that no one knows your name, good or bad, what you know or don't know. Pretend to be ordinary. Live by begging for food and clothes. Dwell in caves, villages, secluded places, or inns without obvious signs.

During this time:
- Not boasting of one's qualities (*rang gi yon tan ming ngom pa med*) = mark of few desires (*zhe 'dod med pa'i rtags*)
- Not hinting at others' gurus or dharmas (*gzhan gyi bla ma dang chos la dri brda mi byed*) = mark of confidence and doubtlessness in one's own instructions (*rang gi man ngag la yid ches shing the tshom med pa'i rtags*)

The phrase *de skad du yang* (thus it is said) introduces further scriptural citation.

Practice Like a Wandering Yogi
**Analysis:** From *Man ngag rin po che'i 'khor lo* (Precious Instruction Wheel):
- "Enemy friend abandon side in, wandering like manner practice" (*dgra gnyen spangs pa'i phyogs su / sprang po lta bu'i tshul gyis bsgrub*)

"Second: practice like deer, very secluded mountain valley cliff bird-nest possess or forest wilderness or mountain peak or snow shoulder or empty valley great go, three actions abandon practice" (*gnyis pa ri dwags ltar bsgrub pa ni rab tu dben ba'i ri ngogs brag gi bya skyibs can nam nags khrod dam / ri rtse'am / gangs 'dabs sam / lung stong chen por song la bya ba gsum spangs la bsgrub*).

"Also body action trade agriculture sky take move" (*de'ang lus kyi bya ba tshong so nam mkhar len sgul skyod*). "Hand circumambulate etcetera" (*phyag bskor ba la sogs pa*). "Speech expression whatever all" (*ngag gi brjod pa gang ci yang rung ba thams cad*). "Mind spread-gather memory thought different, own instruction contradiction all abandon" (*sems kyi 'phro 'du dran bsam tha dad pa rang gi gdams ngag dang 'gal ba rnams thams cad spangs*). "Instruction supreme one-pointedly not-distracted practice" (*man ngag dam pa gcig pu la rtse gcig tu ma yengs pas bsgrub*).

"Need body slow by channels relaxed, channels relaxed by wind-mind nature relaxed" (*dgos pa ni lus dal bas rtsa dal / rtsa dal bas rlung sems rang bzhin gyis dal*).
