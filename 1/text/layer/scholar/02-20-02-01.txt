. Crucial points of practice: body, expanse, awareness, and appearance.

[8831-8844] <structure>
Longchenpa establishes the crucial points (gnad) of Thögal practice organized into four categories: body's crucial point through resonance, expanse's crucial point through gathering and drawing, awareness's crucial point through releasing to space, and appearance's crucial point through increase and exhaustion. The structure follows the systematic presentation of practical instructions.

[8831-8844] <philology>
The term gnad (crucial point/essential point) indicates the precise technical instructions that must be applied correctly for practice to succeed. The compound sgra brdar (resonance/striking) refers to the vibratory quality of awareness that permeates the body. The phrase thig le bsdus nas (bindu accumulated and churned) employs the technical vocabulary of subtle body anatomy—bindu as energetic essences that must be concentrated and activated.

[8831-8844] <context>
The four categories of crucial points reflect the comprehensive approach of Thögal practice: body (working with postures and channels), expanse (working with space and the elements), awareness (working with recognition and release), and appearance (working with visionary phenomena). The citation from Self-Arisen (Rang shar) tantra establishes scriptural authority for the non-grasping approach to wisdom's self-appearance.

[8831-8844] <context>
The specific techniques described—drawing bindu to the center of the eyes when they don't increase, directing to the eyebrow area when light expands, binding wind when thoughts disperse, releasing awareness to space—reflect the sophisticated somatic and contemplative technology of Nyingma Dzogchen. These are not arbitrary procedures but precise interventions based on understanding of subtle body dynamics.

[8831-8844] <concept>
The phenomenology of practice presented here suggests that visionary experiences follow predictable patterns that can be guided through specific techniques. The concept of "resonance" (sgra brdar) indicates that awareness has a vibratory quality that can be felt throughout the body and directed through intention. The "unchanging lamp" (mi 'gyur sgron ma) metaphor suggests that despite all changes in experience, there is a stable core of awareness that remains constant.

[8844-8862] <structure>
The core section elaborates the progressive stages of practice from first practice to final completion, using the metaphors of bird flying, deer swiftness, bee circling to essence, mirage abiding, flickering, quivering fire, and finally non-coming non-going light-appearance.

[8862-8879] <structure>
The conclusion presents the crucial points for specific situations: if thigle does not increase, if light-pra expands, if thoughts disperse—each with specific remedies.

. Progressive experience of expanse-awareness: from swift flight to rainbow body.

[8880-8895] <structure>
Longchenpa examines the progressive stages of Thögal experience using a series of metaphors: bird flying swiftly (instant pervasion), deer swiftness (when string strikes), bee circling to essence, mirage abiding, flickering/flashing, quivering fire, non-coming non-going light, empty thigle lamp, thigle body endowed, delusion-appearance as enjoyment body, and finally day-night without distinction like wolf's eyes.

[8880-8895] <philology>
The term rang snang (self-appearance) indicates that all visionary phenomena are projections of awareness, not external objects. The compound chos sku (Dharmakaya/essence body) here refers to the thigle body endowed with all major and minor marks. The phrase sprul sku (Nirmanakaya/emanation body) indicates that delusion-appearances transform into the enlightened display of the Buddha's emanation activity.

[8880-8895] <context>
The citation from Seng ge rtsal rdzogs (Lion Complete Potency) provides scriptural authority for the progressive stages. The metaphors follow a recognizable sequence: initial freedom and expansion (bird), followed by obstacles (string striking), then progressive refinement (bee, mirage, flickering, fire), then stability (non-coming non-going), and finally transformation (thigle body, enjoyment body, emanation body). This sequence reflects the actual phenomenology of advanced Thögal practice.

[8880-8895] <context>
The final stage—"day and night without distinction: like the eyes of a wolf" (nyin mtshan khyad med spyang ki mig ltar)—indicates that advanced practitioners achieve continuous recognition regardless of external conditions. Wolves can see in darkness, symbolizing the yogin's ability to maintain visionary clarity even in sleep or in dark retreat. The "self-appearance mandala" (rang snang dkyil 'khor) indicates that the entire world is recognized as the display of awareness.

[8880-8895] <concept>
The ontology of progressive stages suggests that enlightenment is not a binary state but a graduated refinement of recognition. The concept of "empty-form" (stong gzugs) is crucial here—the thigle bodies are not solid matter but appearances of emptiness, like rainbows or reflections. The distinction between day and night dissolves not because external conditions change but because the practitioner's recognition becomes continuous and unconditioned.

[8895-8910] <structure>
The middle section presents the crucial correction to mistaken understanding: empty-form rainbow-light thigle bodies exist not in outer space but in the inner body's clear light-nerve, seen through the eye's clear light-nerve drawn inward.

[8910-8924] <structure>
The conclusion emphasizes that when wind and mind are pure, through spontaneous presence's appearance, potency-ground dissolves inward, reaching measure and going to exhaustion—finally liberated in primordial purity.

[8925-8959]
. Clarifying the nature of appearances: inner clear light-nerve, not outer space.

[8925-8936] <structure>
Longchenpa deploys a critical clarification: visionary appearances in Thögal practice arise from the inner clear light-nerve (gsal 'od rtsa), not from outer space. The structure refutes the mistaken view that thigle bodies exist in external space and establishes the correct understanding of internal origin.

[8925-8936] <philology>
The term gsal 'od rtsa (clear light-nerve) refers to the subtle channel through which luminosity manifests. The compound nang du 'char (arising inward) emphasizes the internal origin of visionary phenomena. The phrase gzhi snang (ground-appearance) indicates the manifestation of primordial ground through the practitioner's own cognitive and energetic system.

[8925-8936] <context>
This clarification is doctrinally significant: it prevents the reification of visionary experiences as external entities and maintains the Dzogchen understanding that all appearances are projections of awareness. The mirror metaphor—young maiden seeing her own face in a mirror—aptly illustrates that visionary deities are self-recognition, not external beings. The proof that appearances are internal—seeing them even with eyes closed—demonstrates logical rigor in Nyingma argumentation.

[8925-8936] <context>
The distinction between outer and inner confusion (phyi nang gnyis 'khrul) addresses a common error in interpreting tantric teachings: taking metaphorical spatial language literally. The text explicitly states that tantras speak of appearances in outer space "provisionally" (drang don) for ease of understanding, but the definitive meaning (nges don) is internal. This hermeneutical sophistication reflects the Nyingma integration of philosophical analysis with practical instruction.

[8925-8936] <concept>
The epistemology of visionary experience presented here is carefully nuanced: appearances are "objectless" (yul med) yet they "appear as objects" (yul du snang). This apparent paradox resolves through understanding that the "objects" are empty-forms (stong gzugs)—appearances without substantial basis. The concept of "vajra chain" (rdo rje lu gu rgyud) indicates the unbroken continuity of awareness that manifests as various forms while remaining essentially unchanged.

[8936-8948] <structure>
The core section presents the proof of internal origin: when eyes are closed, empty-forms are still seen; appearances seem to exist in outer objects but are actually like mirror reflections of the heart's awareness-resonance.

[8948-8959] <structure>
The conclusion presents the citation from Lion Complete Potency Great Tantra, using the mirror metaphor to establish that body's appearances arise to dharmatā's object-sky as awareness's self-appearance, not existing in external objects.

[8960-8969]
. Summary: expanse-awareness and the wise practitioner's realization.

[8960-8969] <structure>
This brief concluding section summarizes the essential understanding: appearances are easy to realize as "body appearance" when the manner is understood, while the deluded mistakenly grasp expanse-awareness and lamps as existing in outer space.

[8960-8969] <philology>
The term sku snang (body appearance) indicates the recognition that all appearances are the display of the Buddha bodies. The compound klong rig (expanse-awareness) refers to the inseparability of spatial expanse (dbyings) and awareness (rig pa). The phrase drang don du bshad (explained as provisional meaning) employs the crucial hermeneutical distinction between provisional (drang don) and definitive (nges don) teachings.

[8960-8969] <context>
The text identifies itself as instruction from the "yogin of various self-liberation" (sna tshogs rang grol gyi rnal 'byor pa)—indicating that the author speaks from direct experience. The statement that the teachings are explained provisionally as existing in outer space "for ease of understanding" (go sla'i phyir) demonstrates pedagogical sensitivity: beginners need concrete spatial reference points, but advanced practitioners must transcend these to recognize the internal nature of all appearances.

[8960-8969] <concept>
The hermeneutical philosophy here reflects the Buddhist distinction between conventional and ultimate truth: teachings about external deities and spaces are conventionally true and pedagogically useful, but ultimately all appearances are projections of mind. The wise practitioner (shes rab can) realizes the inner meaning (nang don) without contradicting the provisional explanations. This reflects the Dzogchen non-duality of skillful means and wisdom—appearances are used as the path while recognizing their emptiness.
