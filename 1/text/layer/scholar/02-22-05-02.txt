**Analysis:** Movement analysis establishes a hierarchical taxonomy: 1) container world as support, 2) animate beings as supported. This reflects the standard Buddhist "container and contained" (snod bcud) cosmological framework. The fourfold division of movement (rab tu g.yo ba, cher g.yo ba, kun tu rab tu g.yo ba, and implied fourth) creates scalar intensity. The results section maps movement onto bodhisattva stages (sa), creating a comprehensive soteriological cartography.

 <philology>
**Analysis:** Technical terminology: སྣོད་ཀྱི་འོག་གཞི་ (container world's base) - standard Abhidharma term for the physical world as "vessel" for sentient beings. སྐྱེ་འགྲོ་ (animate beings) contrasts with སྣོད་ (container). ནུས་པས་རླུང་བསྐུལ་ (power/mastery propels wind) - indicates tantric wind-energy (vayu/rlung) mechanics. The phrase ཐུན་མོང་བ་ (common/shared) vs. special indicates path typology. Bodhisattva stage terminology follows Dasabhumika Sutra enumeration (rab tu dga' ba, etc.).

[11736-11760] <context>
**Analysis:** The three temporal divisions (three days, six days, nine days) for different stage-attainments create a precise soteriological chronometry. The enumeration of sravaka stages (four) and bodhisattva stages (ten + one result stage) reflects standard Mahayana path structures from the Abhisamayalamkara. The four vidyadhara stages (rig 'dzin sa bzhi) - matured, life-mastery, mahamudra, spontaneous accomplishment - derive specifically from the Maha-yoga and Anu-yoga tantra systems, particularly the Guhyagarbha tantra.

 <concept>
**Analysis:** The ontological mechanism: the deceased's mastery (nus pa) activates wind-energy (rlung) causing physical movement. This reflects the tantric "vajra body" theory where consciousness-winds animate the physical realm. The scalar typology of movement intensity correlates with realization depth - greater movement indicates higher attainment. The bodhisattva stage mapping demonstrates the text's syncretic integration of sutra and tantra path structures, a hallmark of the rNying ma scholastic tradition. The qualification that these practitioners "do not quickly attain results" (myur du 'bras bu mi thob) introduces important nuance about path differences - sravakas and bodhisattvas require extended cultivation compared to tantric instantaneous liberators.

**Analysis:** This page completes the movement category's bodhisattva stage analysis and presents scriptural citation from Sku Gdung 'Bar ba rtags kyi rgyud. The structure maintains the temporal-stage mapping (3 days, 6 days, 9 days) for sravaka, pratyekabuddha, bodhisattva, and vidyadhara attainments. The verse citation at 11766-11784 employs seven-syllable meter with feminine vocative མཁའ་འགྲོ་མ་ and closing particle ཞེས་སོ་, confirming tantric revelation context.

 <philology>
**Analysis:** Technical terminology: རིག་པ་འཛིན་པའི་ས་ (vidyadhara stages) - specific enumeration follows Guhyagarbha tantra: rnam par smin pa'i sa, tshe la dbang ba'i sa, phyag rgya chen po'i sa, lhun gyis grub pa'i sa. Temporal markers use locative-associative particles (zhag ni gsum na yang). The term ཅི་དགར་སྤྱོད་པ་ (freedom to act as wished) indicates the acintya/chen po'i spyod yul (unimaginable activity sphere) of high tantric attainments. Scriptural citation employs conditional logic: གལ་ཏེ...གྱུར་ན་ནི་ (if...occurs, then).

 <context>
**Analysis:** The eight sravaka stages (dmun pa'i sa brgyad) listed at 11735-11741 reflect the Vaibhasika/Abhidharma system: rigs (gotra), brgyad pa (eighth), mthong ba (darsana), srib pa (elimination of defilements), byas pa rtogs pa (understanding of the conditioned), then four arya stages (rgyun zhugs, phyir 'ong, phyir mi 'ong, dgra bcom pa). The bodhisattva ten stages follow Dasabhumika Sutra enumeration. The criticism of those who confuse vehicle-doors and entry-paths (theg pa'i sgo dang 'jug lam so so) at 11785 reflects ongoing sectarian debates about sudden vs. gradual paths in Tibetan Buddhism.

[11785-11794] <concept>
**Analysis:** The epistemological critique at 11785-11793 employs the simile of "measuring the time to Lhasa for those who travel by different means" to illustrate that different paths (sutra vs. tantra) have different temporal requirements. This represents the rNying ma hermeneutical position on the "nine vehicles" (theg pa dgu) - each vehicle valid but with different efficiencies. The principle of "path-specific means and prajna activity" (lam so so'i thabs dang shes rab kyi byed pa) establishes the necessity of vehicle-appropriate practice, rejecting reductionist attempts to conflate all paths into a single timeline.

[11785-11802] <structure>
**Analysis:** The text transitions to SECOND MAIN TOPIC: "'Gro drug 'khrul pas skye ba len pa'i rtags" (signs of the six realms taking birth through delusion). This represents the samsaric counterpart to the preceding nirvanic/liberation signs. The structure employs binary opposition: two paths (chos nyid bardo vs. srid pa bardo) and two results (Buddha vs. sentient being). The five paths to buddhahood (tshogs lam through mthar phyin pa'i lam) versus five delusion paths create comprehensive path typology.

 <philology>
**Analysis:** Key terminology: འགྲོ་དྲུག་ (six realms/gatis) - standard samsaric cosmology. འཁྲུལ་པ་ (delusion/error) indicates fundamental ignorance ('khrul gzhi). ཆོས་ཉིད་ཀྱི་བར་མ་དོ་ (dharmata bardo) vs. སྲིད་པའི་བར་མ་དོ་ (srid pa bardo) - the classical pair from the Bardo thodrol literature. The five paths to buddhahood use standard Sanskrit-derived Tibetan terms: tshogs lam (sambhara-marga), sbyor lam (prayoga-marga), mthong lam (darsana-marga), sgom lam (bhavana-marga), mthar phyin pa'i lam (nistha-marga/nisya-marga).

 <context>
**Analysis:** The five paths structure derives from the Abhisamayalamkara's presentation of the Mahayana path, common to all Tibetan Buddhist traditions. The five delusion paths (rmig lam, bag chags kyi lam, las kyi mtha'i lam, etc.) represent specifically tantric categorization of samsaric rebirth processes found in the Karling Zhitro and related bardo literature. The binary framework (liberation vs. delusion, two paths, two results) reflects the fundamental Buddhist soteriological structure of nirvana vs. samsara, though here elaborated with bardo-specific phenomenology.

[11803-11815] <structure>
**Analysis:** This page presents the detailed typology of samsaric rebirth paths (delusion paths) corresponding to the five paths to buddhahood. The structure follows a five-fold enumeration: 1) dream path, 2) habitual pattern path, 3) karmic fruition path, 4) uncertain delusion-mechanism path, 5) indeterminate cause-result path. This creates a comprehensive phenomenology of bardo consciousness, mapping how undirected awareness becomes fixated into specific rebirth destinations.

[11803-11823] <philology>
**Analysis:** Technical terminology: རྨི་ལམ་གྱི་ལམ་ (dream path) - references the intermediate dream-like state of the bardo. བག་ཆགས་ཀྱི་ལམ་ (habitual pattern path) - employs the Yogacara concept of vasana (perfumings). ལས་ཀྱི་མཐའི་ལམ་ (karmic fruition path) - las mtha' (karmic bound/end) indicates maturation. འཁྲུལ་འཁོར་ (delusion-mechanism) - literally "wheel of error," indicating cyclic delusion. Particle constructions: causative chains marked by connective དང༌ and temporal ནས་.

 <context>
**Analysis:** The five delusion paths represent a specifically rDzogs chen/tantric categorization found in Karling Zhitro (kar gling zhi khro) and related bardo revelation texts. The "uncertain delusion-mechanism path" (ma nges pa'i lam) refers to the period before karmic maturation becomes determined, a crucial concept in bardo liberation practices. The binary result structure (Buddha vs. sentient being) at 11816-11823 establishes the fundamental soteriological framework, with six realms (dmal ba through lha) as the only possible destinations for non-liberated consciousness.

[11816-11823] <concept>
**Analysis:** Ontological analysis reveals the mechanics of samsaric fixation: the bardo consciousness, lacking stable recognition, becomes entrained by residual habit patterns (bag chags) which then activate karmic seeds (sa bon), eventually becoming fixated (nges pa) on specific rebirth destinations. The "uncertain" path represents the window for liberation - once fixation occurs, rebirth becomes inevitable. This reflects the Abhidharma theory of antarabhava combined with tantric understandings of mind's creative power.

[11824-11824] <structure>
**Analysis:** The text transitions to specific signs for hell realm rebirth (dmyal bar skye ba'i rtags), first of six realm analyses. The structure follows phenomenological description of atmospheric and environmental signs visible at death: sky-darkening, storms, specific weather phenomena. This is followed by enumeration of the eight hot hells (tsha dmyal brgyad), eight cold hells (grang ba brgyad), and adjacent hells (nye 'khor ba).

 <philology>
**Analysis:** Technical terminology: ནམ་མཁའ་སྤྲིན་ནག་པོས་འཁྲིགས་ (sky thick with dark clouds) - འཁྲིགས (to become dense/filled) is precise meteorological term. མུན་བསྲོས་པ་ (gathered darkness) - imagery from the Rin chen gter mdzod. Phenomenological markers: སྤྲིན་ (clouds), ཆར་ (rain), ཁུ་རླངས་ (mist), རླུང་ (wind), སེར་བ་ (hail), བུ་ཡུག་ (dust storm) - comprehensive atmospheric taxonomy. Hell names use standard translations: tsha dmyal (hot hells), grang ba (cold), nyi tsha ba (occasional), sems can dmyal ba (hell of sentient beings = Avici/continuous).

 <context>
**Analysis:** The hell realm cosmology derives from Abhidharma traditions (Abhidharmakosha chapter 3), with eight hot hells ranging from Reviving (sos) to Uninterrupted (mnar med). The distinction of Avici/mnar med and rdo rje'i dmyal ba (Vajra hell) as separate from the eight hot hells reflects tantric additions - the Vajra hell specifically for samaya breakers. The description draws from the Dirghagama, Mahaparinirvana Sutra, and various tantras including Guhyagarbha.

 <concept>
**Analysis:** The phenomenological correlation: specific atmospheric phenomena at death (darkness, storms, hail) indicate karmic affinity with specific hell realms. This reflects the Buddhist principle of karmic resonance - external appearances mirror internal karmic states. The Avici hell's extreme duration (bar bskal - intermediate eon, exceeding by hundreds of thousands of times) demonstrates the severity of abandoning the Dharma (chos spong ba), considered the most heinous karmic action. The Vajra hell's infinite duration (measured by ocean evaporation simile) reflects tantric severity regarding samaya violations.
