. Dream yoga: preliminary and actual practices.

[3005-3014] <structure>
Longchenpa establishes preliminary dream yoga practices organized through four progressive stages: (1) harsh-holding (drag 'dzin) when fear arises, (2) emanation (sprul) of various forms, (3) transformation (sgyur) between god-naga and male-female, (4) travel to unreachable places and hearing Dharma. The structure follows the graduated approach of first recognizing the dream state, then gaining control over dream content, then using dreams for spiritual practice. The progression moves from passive recognition to active manipulation.

[3005-3014] <context>
Dream yoga (rmi lam sgom pa) represents the classical Buddhist practice of recognizing and utilizing the dream state for spiritual development. The preliminary practices (sngon 'gro) establish dream lucidity through: recognizing fear as dream (harsh-holding), creating emanations, transforming forms, and traveling to pure realms. The phrase "fierce aspirations" (drag po'i mos pa) indicates that intensity of intention accelerates mastery. This reflects the Nyingma understanding that dream yoga is preliminary to clear light recognition.

[3005-3014] <philology>
The term rmi lam (dream) carries its technical sense as a domain for practice intermediate between waking and deep sleep. The compound drag 'dzin (harsh-holding) refers to forcefully recognizing the dream state when fear arises. The term sprul (emanation) indicates the capacity to create forms in the dream. The phrase lha klu (god-naga) represents the capacity to transform between higher and lower forms. The verb bsgom (train/cultivate) indicates that these capacities must be developed through practice.

The epistemology of dream yoga is central to Dzogchen: if waking reality is like a dream (as the mirror practice established), then mastering dreams prepares one for recognizing the illusory nature of all experience. The concept of rmi lam ngos 'dzin (recognizing the dream) is preliminary to the actual practice of transforming dreams into clear light. The ability to emanate and transform in dreams demonstrates that ordinary reality is malleable when recognized as mind's display.

. Actual dream yoga: dharmatā meaning, means, and focus points.

[3015-3044] <structure>
This subsection presents the actual (dngos gzhi) dream yoga with three aspects: (1) dharmatā-meaning point (don gyi gnad), (2) means (thabs), (3) focus point (gnad gzhi), (4) channel-wind binding point (rtsa rlung 'gag gnad). The structure moves from preliminary emanation-transformation to the actual practice of recognizing emptiness in dreams. The threefold training (bslab, sgyur, chod) indicates progressive stages of dream mastery.

[3015-3044] <context>
The text establishes that preliminary dream yoga—while useful—is limited because "not free from intellect truth-grasping" (blo'i bden 'dzin las ma grol). The actual practice requires recognition of dharmatā (chos nyid). The citation "From three: train, transform, cut" (gsum las bslab sgyur chod) provides the scriptural basis for the threefold method. The warning that this is "a very important point" (gnad shin tu che) indicates the profundity of actual dream yoga.

[3015-3044] <philology>
The term chos nyid (dharmatā) carries its ultimate sense as the empty nature of all phenomena. The compound bden med (truthless/without truth) indicates the absence of inherent existence. The phrase gzhi med (baseless/groundless) refers to the lack of substantial foundation for phenomena. The term rig pa (awareness/pristine cognition) appears in contrast to blo (intellect/mind)—rig pa recognizes directly, blo conceptualizes. The phrase chos nyid 'khor lo (dharmatā wheel) indicates the cycle of day and night unified in recognition.

[3015-3044] <concept>
The actual dream yoga transcends mere lucidity to recognition of emptiness: all dream appearances are "fixation-without, truth-without, base-without, recognition-without"—indicating the fourfold emptiness of phenomena. The transformation to deity's mandala (lha'i dkyil 'khor) and Buddha's realm (sangs rgyas zhing) utilizes dream control for spiritual purposes. The "eight examples of illusion" (sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad) provide the framework for understanding dream-emptiness. The ultimate goal: day-night union (nyin mtshan zung 'jug) where the recognition continues uninterrupted.

. Cutting dreams and day-night union meditation.

[3045-3056] <structure>
This concluding section presents the culmination of dream yoga: cutting (chod) the dream and achieving day-night union (nyin mtshan zung 'jug). The structure describes: (1) progressive fading of dreams (coarse, subtle, fade, gone), (2) day-night mixed self-clear rigpa concentration, (3) the actual meditation of day-night union. The progression indicates complete transcendence of the dream state into continuous recognition.

[3045-3056] <context>
The term "cut" (chod/gcod) indicates not destruction but recognition—dreams are "cut" when their true nature is seen. The "two pure stages" (dag pa'i sa gnyis) likely refer to the two stages of generation and completion, or possibly the stages of luminosity recognition. The "sixth" (drug pa) may refer to the sixth consciousness (mind consciousness) purified. The culmination—"anything not dream"—indicates complete awakening where even the distinction between waking and dreaming dissolves.

[3045-3056] <philology>
The term zung 'jug (union) carries its technical Dzogchen sense of non-dual integration. The compound rang gsal rig pa (self-clear awareness) indicates the natural luminosity of mind. The phrase ting nge 'dzin (samādhi/concentration) indicates stabilized meditative absorption. The term re dogs med (doubt-free) indicates the certainty that comes from direct recognition. The verb med (not exist) appears repeatedly—not as nihilistic denial but as recognition of emptiness.

[3045-3056] <concept>
The philosophical culmination of dream yoga is profound: when dreams are cut and day-night union is achieved, the practitioner realizes that waking life was always dream-like, and dreams were always empty. The concept of nyin mtshan zung 'jug indicates that the recognition of dharmatā transcends the duality of day (waking) and night (dreaming/sleeping). This represents the Dzogchen ideal of continuous recognition (rgyun chags kyi ngo sprod) where all states—waking, dreaming, deep sleep—are recognized as manifestations of single awareness.
