. Training capacity instruction: illusory body, clear light, and bardo liberation.

 <structure>
The passage at lines 3354-3356 establishes the foundational structure for capacity training (dbang sbyong) instructions, organizing the material through the three classical yogas: illusory body (sgyu lus), clear light ('od gsal), and bardo (bar do). The structural markers rim pa indicate the graduated progression from daytime practices (illusory body and clear light) through bardo familiarity to dream certainty. The dbye ba framework distinguishes between preliminary training and actual bardo instructions, while the section maintains standard Nyingma doxographical conventions through scriptural citation formulas (de las gsungs pa).

 <philology>
The term dbang sbyong (capacity training) employs the technical vocabulary of Anuttarayoga tantra, where dbang refers to the empowerment capacities transmitted and sbyong to their subsequent cultivation. The compound sgyu lus (illusory body) distinguishes the subtle body of clear light from the coarse physical form. The phrase 'od gsal (clear light) carries its specific Dzogchen sense of primordial luminosity rather than mere visual brightness. The particle zhes so marks the citation from Klong chen pa drug pa (Six Expanses) as authoritative transmission rather than original composition.

 <context>
This section cites authoritative tantric sources—Klong chen pa drug pa (Six Expanses), sGyu 'phrul drwa ba (Mayajala), and Zhi khro (Peaceful-Wrathful) cycles—to establish the validity of the three-yoga system. The Nyingma emphasis on bka' ma (oral tradition) sources is evident in the selection of these canonical texts. Longchenpa's synthetic methodology demonstrates how diverse tantric technologies (illusory body yoga, dream yoga, clear light yoga, bardo recognition) are integrated within the Great Perfection framework.

 <concept>
The operational logic of the three-yoga system follows the standard Buddhist lam rim structure adapted to completion stage (rdzogs rim) practices: cause (familiarity with illusory nature), method (clear light recognition), result (bardo liberation). The key doctrinal innovation is the Dzogchen claim that liberation occurs at the moment of recognition—whether in this life through illusory body practice, at death through clear light recognition, or in bardo through deity manifestation. The concept of bar do 'char tshul (manner of bardo arising) indicates that bardo experience follows predictable patterns that can be mastered through training.

[23783-23797]
. Self-liberation through three times equality: not cutting, not welcoming, not depending.

 <context>
The section elaborates the essential pith instructions for meditation through the three times—past, present, future—citing the Klong chen pa drug pa (Six Expanses) tantra. The doctrinal framework emphasizes that the essence of practice is "one-gathered" (gcig bsdus) rather than scattered across temporal moments. The transmission lineage is indicated through the zhes so formula, establishing these as received teachings rather than philosophical innovations.

 <structure>
The structure presents a series of negations organized around the three times: not cutting past traces (das pa'i rjes ma chod), not welcoming future hope (ma 'ongs re ma drangs), not depending on present latency with antidote (da lta'i bag la nyal gnyen po la ma brten). The passage at lines 3357-3371 demonstrates the Nyingma pedagogical approach of defining practice through what it transcends rather than what it affirms.

 <philology>
The compound rjes chod (cutting trace) refers to the common meditation error of deliberately cutting thoughts, which the text rejects in favor of self-liberation (rang grol). The phrase re drangs (welcoming/raising hope) indicates the error of anticipating future realization rather than resting in present awareness. The term bag la nyal (latency/dormant tendency) carries the Abhidharma technical meaning of karmic seeds awaiting conditions. The parallel constructions—stretched/not-stretched, puffed/not-puffed, hesitant/not-hesitant—employ physical metaphors to indicate balanced recognition.

 <concept>
The epistemology of three times equality (dus gsum mnyam pa) presented here is distinctively Dzogchen: rather than abandoning temporal experience, the practitioner recognizes all three times as equally ungraspable. The bird leaving no trace in sky metaphor (nam mkha' la bya rjes 'dzin med ltar) illustrates immediate self-liberation without residue. The concept of snang skad grol ba (liberating at the moment of appearance) indicates that recognition and liberation are simultaneous—there is no interval of processing or transformation.

[23798-23819]
. Actual bardo instruction: elements dissolving into clear light mother-child meeting.

 <context>
Longchenpa establishes the actual bardo instructions (bar do'i man ngag dngos), drawing from sGyu 'phrul drwa ba (Mayajala), Zhi khro (Peaceful-Wrathful), and bZhi brgyad (Four-Eight) tantras. The citations establish the inevitability of liberation for practitioners with faith (dad pa can), even if not achieved in this birth. The doctrinal framework integrates classical tantric cosmology (five elements dissolving) with Dzogchen direct recognition.

 <structure>
The passage at lines 3394-3404 demonstrates the systematic presentation of the death process: earth dissolving into water, water into fire, fire into wind, wind into space, space into clear light. The structure then presents the four wisdoms (ye shes bzhi) arising from the clear light: near-attainment (nye bar thob), moment one (skad cig gcig), then two and three and four. The final structure distinguishes between those who recognize clear light (Dharmakaya liberation) and those who enter bardo (deity illusory body liberation).

 <philology>
The phrase 'byung ba bzhi (four elements) refers to earth, water, fire, wind—the progressive dissolution sequence. The compound 'od gsal ma bu 'phrad (clear light mother-child meeting) indicates the recognition of ground clear light (mother) by path clear light (child). The term chos sku (Dharmakaya) here refers to the ultimate body achieved through immediate recognition at death. The phrase srid pa'i bar do (existence bardo) distinguishes the intermediate state between death and rebirth.

 <concept>
The phenomenology of death presented here is precise: as elements dissolve, consciousness becomes increasingly subtle until the clear light dawns. The concept of ye shes bzhi (four wisdoms) indicates progressive stages of recognition—each wisdom dissolving into the next until the ultimate. The distinction between immediate Dharmakaya recognition and bardo deity manifestation reflects the Dzogchen teaching that recognition can occur at multiple points depending on practitioner capacity.

[23820-23830]
. Sugata intention and sun-moon union meditation.

 <structure>
The passage at lines 3394-3404 demonstrates Longchenpa's method of integrating diverse practices under unified frameworks. The structural markers indicate the two Sugata intentions (bde gshegs dgongs pa gnyis)—likely referring to the two truths or two accumulations—taught briefly from Rang shar (Self-Arisen) tantra. The progression extends to sun-moon union meditation (nyi zla kha sbyor), where sensation ceases through non-modification and warmth measure is obtained through non-meditated looking.

 <context>
The citation from Rang shar (Self-Arisen) establishes the spontaneous arising of wisdom appearance through familiarity with sky expanse. The doctrinal lineage emphasizes bka' ma sources, with the de las gsungs pa formula indicating transmission. The section integrates completion stage practices (sun-moon union referring to the blending of red and white essences) with Dzogchen non-meditation.

 <philology>
The term bde gshegs dgongs pa (Sugata intention) carries the sense of Buddha-mind or enlightened intention. The compound nyi zla kha sbyor (sun-moon union) refers to the union of method (sun) and wisdom (moon) at the heart center. The phrase ma bcos gnas (not-modify place) indicates resting without deliberate alteration. The term dgongs pa (intention) appears in multiple compounds—great boundary-not-exist samadhi-post-meditation intention (chos nyid thig chen po rjes thob kyi dgongs pa).

 <concept>
The meditative technology presented here involves gazing without blinking (mi g.yo ba'i mig) to achieve the "ocean relax method" (rgya mtsho lhod pa'i thabs). The concept of rgya mtsho (ocean) indicates mind that is unmoving yet all-reflecting—like an ocean reflecting planets without being stained by them. The phrase dus gsum mnyam pa'i ting 'dzin (three times equality meditation) synthesizes daytime and nighttime practice into continuous recognition.

[23831-23845]
. Cutting error places: the four deviations in meditation.

 <context>
This section addresses common errors (gol sa) in meditation practice, citing Thal 'gyur (Consequence/Result Tantra) and Yi ge med pa (Letterless) tantra. The doctrinal framework identifies specific deviations: one-directional shamatha, scattered distraction, not finding self-essence depth clarity, and holding peg one-pointed. These reflect the Nyingma pedagogical concern with precise recognition rather than mere concentration.

 <structure>
The passage at lines 3405-3419 demonstrates the graduated enumeration of errors, followed by the correct meditation instruction: gathering wind-mind, putting consciousness in self-place, cutting outer-inner movement. The structure moves from error identification through correct method to result—self-arisen wisdom meditation pervading and self-liberating.

 <philology>
The term gol sa (error place/deviation) indicates specific meditation errors that practitioners may fall into. The compound zhi gnas (shamatha/peaceful abiding) appears in the context of "one-directional shamatha" (phyogs gcig tu zhi gnas pa)—a limitation to be transcended. The phrase rlung sems (wind-mind) refers to the subtle energy and consciousness that must be gathered. The term thig le (bindu/essence drop) indicates the point of concentration at the heart.

 <concept>
The epistemology of error presented here is sophisticated: errors are not moral failings but cognitive misapprehensions that can be precisely identified and corrected. The concept of skyon ma sgom pa'i gol sa (fault of not-meditating) indicates the paradox that both meditation and non-meditation can become obstacles if not properly understood. The correct method—dwelling in self-rigpa clear vast self-liberation—transcends both concentration and distraction.

[23846-23860]
. Faults of not-meditating: binding self through views and words.

 <context>
The section elaborates the counter-intuitive teaching that not-meditating can itself become a fault if misunderstood. Citing Thal 'gyur, the text identifies eight specific faults: manifest samsara appearance, self-other object-consciousness duality, view with word, object with focus, binding self through affliction, losing Buddha path, not-knowing result nature, ground-not-exist equal all dharma, and binding three-realms self-aware.

 <structure>
The passage at lines 3420-3434 presents the faults through enumeration (dbye ba), moving from external appearance through internal conceptualization to ultimate groundlessness. The structure concludes with the imperative: therefore effort do meditation (des na rtsol sgrub sgom par bya)—acknowledging that while ultimate nature transcends meditation, conventional practice remains necessary.

 <philology>
The term skyon (fault/error) carries the sense of deviation from correct practice. The compound blo gros (thought/discrimination) appears in the phrase blo gros kyis phung ste (become downfall with thought)—indicating that conceptual understanding without direct recognition becomes obstacle. The phrase sa gsum (three realms) refers to desire, form, and formless realms of samsara. The term rang rig (self-aware) indicates the reflexive nature of consciousness that becomes binding when not recognized as empty.

 <concept>
The philosophical dialectic here addresses the apparent paradox of Dzogchen: ultimate nature transcends meditation, yet meditation is necessary to realize this transcendence. The concept of chos thams cad ka nas mi mnyam pa (ground not-exist equal all dharma) indicates that while all dharmas are equal in emptiness, this equality must be realized through practice, not merely asserted. The eight faults represent progressive subtlety—from gross samsara appearance to the subtle error of binding three realms through self-awareness.

[23861-23887]
. Dharmatā arising ground: self-relaxation reaching elaboration limit.

 <context>
Longchenpa examines the third aspect: dharmatā arising ground relax appearance-existence intention (chos nyid 'char gzhi lhod pa snang srid de yi dgongs pa). Citing Klong chen pa drug pa, the text establishes the four fruits: thought not mind-itself, not-grasp not-cease self-appearance, self-rigpa clear object recognize, ground-place great aim. These reflect the Nyingma presentation of the path as progressive recognition.

 <structure>
The passage at lines 3435-3461 demonstrates the systematic enumeration of the four fruits, followed by the contemplation verses attributed to Kun tu bzang po (Samantabhadra). The structure moves from preliminary recognition through spontaneous vast appearance to the final fruit of self-pure samadhi.

 <philology>
The term chos nyid 'char gzhi (dharmatā arising ground) indicates the foundation from which all appearances arise as dharmatā. The compound rang lhod (self-relax) refers to relaxation without deliberate effort—natural release of tension. The phrase spros pa'i mtha' (elaboration limit) indicates the endpoint of conceptual proliferation. The name Kun tu bzang po (Samantabhadra/All-Good) appears as the speaker of the contemplation verses, establishing primordial Buddha as source.

 <concept>
The soteriology presented here emphasizes that afflictions self-vanquish (nyon mongs rang zil gyis gnon) and self-pure (rang dag), from which wisdom dawns. The concept of snang btags chos (appearance-label dharmas) indicates that all labeled phenomena are Dharmakaya nature self-clear naked liberated—this is the ultimate view where appearance and emptiness are inseparable.

[23888-23902]
. Six-Vastnesses ground completion: the ten non-virtues as self-pure.

 <context>
The section presents the Klong chen pa drug pa (Six Expanses) teaching that all appearances—positive and negative—are self-pure in mind-itself. This radical teaching transforms the ten non-virtues (killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle speech, covetousness, malice, wrong view) from obstacles to supports for recognition.

 <structure>
The passage at lines 3462-3476 demonstrates the systematic pairing of each non-virtue with its self-pure nature: killing self-pure, existence-appearance mind-itself; stealing self-pure, lie-words mind-itself; and so forth through all ten. The structure concludes with the five objects (form, sound, smell, taste, touch) similarly presented as self-pure.

 <philology>
The term mi dge ba bcu (ten non-virtues) refers to the standard Buddhist moral categories that are here reinterpreted. The compound rang dag (self-pure) indicates that impurity is adventitious rather than intrinsic. The phrase yod snang (exist-appearance) and med snang (not-exist appearance) appear as the basis for self-purity—showing that both existence and non-existence are mind-itself. The term rnam shes tshogs drug (six-aggregate consciousness) encompasses all cognitive modes.

 <concept>
The ethical philosophy here is sophisticated and potentially dangerous: the ten non-virtues are self-pure not because morality is irrelevant, but because when recognized as mind-itself, they liberate rather than bind. The concept of sdig pa rang dag (sin self-pure) indicates that the nature of all phenomena is primordial purity (ka dag)—sin is only sin when not recognized. This teaching requires the foundation of direct introduction and stable recognition; otherwise it becomes mere rationalization.

[23903-23925]
. View progressive: city continuum-cut and mountain all-placement method.

 <context>
The final section presents the progressive view (lta ba rim gyis byed pa) for yogins, citing Thal 'gyur on the nature of view. The doctrinal framework distinguishes view general and view nature, establishing that appearance-existence container-content are primordially liberated without pervasion or whatever-liberation.

 <structure>
The passage at lines 3477-3499 demonstrates the concluding synthesis: view city continuum-cut (lta ba'i grong rgyun chad), instruction mountain all-placement method (man ngag gi ri bo thams cad gzhag pa'i thabs), aim realms three complete-liberation (dngos gzhi khams gsum yongs su grol ba), fruit affliction ground-pure ('bras bu nyon mongs gzhi dag). The structure moves from view through instruction to aim and fruit.

 <philology>
The term lta ba'i grong (view city) metaphorically indicates the dwelling place of conceptual views that must be cut. The compound man ngag gi ri bo (instruction mountain) suggests the stability and elevation of authentic instruction. The phrase khams gsum (three realms) encompasses all of samsara. The term yongs su grol ba (complete liberation) indicates final emancipation rather than temporary freedom.

 <concept>
The philosophical culmination presented here resolves the apparent contradiction between progressive practice and instantaneous recognition: the view is primordially liberated (ka nas grol), yet the yogin engages in progressive familiarization (goms pa). The Thal 'gyur citation establishes that whatever appears is self-dharmatā, and fabricated dharmatā does not exist—this is the ultimate view where engagement is non-engagement, thinking is non-thinking.
