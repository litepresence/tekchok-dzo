. Three emanation types: hunters/butchers, six Śākyas, and five pure fields.

[16719-16728] <structure>
Longchenpa establishes the threefold classification of emanations (sprul pa): (1) hunters and butchers (shon pa shan pa) who appear in negative forms to benefit beings, (2) the six Śākyas (shAkya drug) who emanate in various forms according to what tames each being, (3) the five pure fields (zhing lnga) where Buddhas manifest in five families' forms. The structure moves from unconventional emanations through historical Buddha manifestations to cosmic pure fields, demonstrating the comprehensive scope of Nirmāṇakāya activity.

[16719-16728] <context>
The citation from Guhyagarbha (gSang ba snying po) establishes scriptural authority for unconventional emanations: "As hunters and butchers, etcetera, Emanating, benefit sentient beings." This reflects the Nyingma understanding that Buddhas manifest in whatever form benefits beings—including forms that appear negative from conventional perspective. The six Śākyas refer to the six historical or archetypal Buddhas of the Śākya lineage. The five pure fields—Akanistha ('og min), Sudarśana (mthong na sdug), Glorious-Endowed (dpal ldan), Lotus-Stack (pad brtsegs), Karma Perfect (phrin las rdzogs)—represent the main pure realms where Sambhogakāya manifests.

[16719-16728] <philology>
The term shon pa (hunter) and shan pa (butcher) indicate professions considered negative in Buddhist ethics, here transformed into emanation forms. The compound shAkya drug (six Śākyas) refers to the six Buddhas of the Śākya lineage—historical or archetypal figures. The term 'og min (Akanistha) means "none higher," the highest pure field. The compound mtshong na sdug (Sudarśana) means "beautiful to behold." The term dpal ldan (Glorious-Endowed) indicates the field of wealth and glory. The compound pad brtsegs (Lotus-Stack) refers to a field of stacked lotuses. The term phrin las rdzogs (Karma Perfect) indicates the field where all activities are perfected.

[16719-16728] <concept>
The philosophical implication is profound: Buddhas manifest without attachment to form, appearing even as hunters and butchers to benefit specific beings. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching of thugs rje (compassion) as the spontaneous capacity to appear in whatever form benefits—without limitation to conventional "good" forms. The concept of sprul sku (emanation body) indicates that enlightenment is not static but dynamic, manifesting throughout all realms in forms appropriate to each situation. The five fields represent the five Buddha families' pure manifestation, demonstrating that cosmic organization reflects enlightened wisdom.

. Detailed description of pure fields: characteristics and cosmology.

[16729-16756] <structure>
This subsection presents detailed characteristics of the pure fields following a fivefold schema: (1) field/pure field (zhing/zhing khams), (2) place (gnas), (3) retinue ('khor), (4) teaching (bstan pa), (5) time (dus). The structure applies this schema to: Glorious Great Vajradhara (dpal chen rdo rje 'chang) in Jambudvīpa, Emanation Body's Sambhogakāya as Glorious Vajrasattva, and Emanation Body's Emanation Body as Śākyamuni. This systematic presentation demonstrates the Nyingma comprehensive cosmology.

[16729-16756] <context>
The detailed enumeration of pure field characteristics reflects the Nyingma integration of Indian Buddhist cosmology with Dzogchen perspective. The "three-thousand three-thousand-hundred-million worlds" (stong gsum stong gsum bye ba'i 'jig rten gyi khams) indicates vast cosmic scope—each Buddha-field encompasses innumerable world-systems. The description of Vajrasattva as "Emanation Body's Sambhogakāya" (sprul sku'i longs sku) indicates the non-dual relationship between these two kāyas—they are not separate entities but different modes of manifestation. The teaching of "Definitive Meaning Vehicle" (nges don gyi theg pa) indicates the advanced teachings given in pure fields.

[16729-16756] <philology>
The term 'dzam bu'i gling (Jambudvīpa) refers to our world-system, here described as the field of Vajradhara. The compound rdo rje 'chang (Vajradhara) means "vajra-holder," the primordial Buddha. The phrase skye ba bzhi (four births) refers to the four modes of birth (womb, egg, moisture, spontaneous). The term phrin las (deeds/activities) refers to the twelve or thirty-six deeds of a Buddha. The compound stong gsum (three thousand) refers to the three thousand great thousand worlds (trichiliocosm). The term 'dzam bu'i gling (Jambudvīpa) as Śākyamuni's field indicates our world. The phrase rgya mtsho'i spyan snga (Vulture Peak mountain) indicates the main teaching site in India.

[16729-16756] <concept>
The cosmological architecture here is sophisticated: pure fields are not merely "heavenly realms" but dimensions where Buddhas manifest according to the capacity of beings. The concept of sprul sku'i sprul sku (emanation of emanation) indicates cascading manifestation—from Dharmakāya through Sambhogakāya through multiple Nirmāṇakāya forms. The time distinctions—"immeasurable years" for Vajrasattva, "great distinguishing time" for Śākyamuni—indicate that temporal experience varies according to realm and capacity. The fivefold schema (field, place, retinue, teaching, time) demonstrates the systematic Nyingma presentation of Buddha-field cosmology.

. Emanation Body's nature: non-attachment and self-abiding disciples.

[16757-16769] <structure>
This concluding subsection presents the essential nature of Emanation Body through citation from Precious Heap (Rin chen spungs pa): emanating by non-attachment, awakening from Dharmadhātu, disciples' self-abiding, awakening six families' fortunate ones. The structure emphasizes that Emanation Body is not limited to historical Buddhas but represents the continuous manifestation of enlightenment for benefit of beings.

[16757-16769] <context>
The citation from Precious Heap establishes the ultimate nature of Emanation Body: it manifests not through deliberate effort but through non-attachment (chags pa med par), from Dharmadhātu (chos dbyings las), awakening those who are self-abiding (rang gnas)—indicating that disciples themselves are manifestations of the ground. This reflects the Nyingma understanding that savior and saved are ultimately non-dual—the Buddha appears to those whose own nature is already enlightened. The teaching of "as number-of-vehicles" (theg pa'i grangs ltar) indicates the graduated approach accommodating different capacities.

[16757-16769] <philology>
The term chags pa med par (by non-attachment) indicates spontaneous manifestation without grasping. The phrase chos dbyings las (from Dharmadhātu) indicates the ultimate source of emanation. The term rang gnas (self-abiding) indicates that disciples are already in their natural state. The compound rigs drug (six families) refers to the six classes of beings or the six Buddha families. The phrase dbang po (faculties) here refers to the capacities of disciples. The term spros pa (elaboration) indicates conceptual proliferation, contrasted with direct teaching.

[16757-16769] <concept>
The philosophical culmination here is profound: Emanation Body manifests not to create enlightenment where it didn't exist but to awaken those who are "self-abiding" (rang gnas)—already in their natural enlightened state but not recognizing it. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching of ye nas sangs rgyas (primordially enlightened)—all beings are already Buddhas, requiring only recognition. The concept of "memory self-clear from mind" (dran pa yid las rang gsal) indicates that the teachings arise from the natural clarity of mind itself, not external imposition. This represents the Dzogchen understanding that enlightenment is revelation, not construction.
