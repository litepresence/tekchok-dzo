## Fifth Position: Universal Acceptability Refutation

**Assertion:** Because awareness essence is without direction and appears everywhere (rig pa'i ngo bo la phyogs med kun tu shar bas), it accepts/asserts anything whatsoever (cir yang khas len pa).

**Refutation:** Examining alternatives:
1. If acceptance exists in ground → permanent and impermanent would be simultaneously established (rtag dngos mi rtag dngos gnyis lhan cig grub par thal)
2. If acceptance doesn't exist in ground → even rabbit horns (ri bong gi rwa) and son of barren woman (mo gsham gyi bu) could create samsara-nirvana—endless faults

**Canonical Citation:** "All these are merely projections of not recognizing one's own face. Because all are established as existing entities through delusion. Since faults of non-recognition are endless..."

## Sixth Position: Variegated Appearance Refutation

**Assertion:** Because essence appears everywhere, variegated appearances of multiplicity arise through not recognizing own face.

**Three Alternatives Examined:**
1. **External appearance** (phyi snang ba): Ground would appear manifold externally
2. **Internal consciousness** (nang shes pa): Ground would be momentary (skad cig ma), conceptual (snyam byed), afflicted (nyon mongs)
3. **Aggregation** (de gnyis tshogs pa): Ground would be subject-object duality (gzung 'dzin), six aggregates to abandon (tshogs drug spang bya)

**Conclusion:** Ground cannot be single expanse (dbyings gcig) if truly manifold.

- lhan cig grub: arise together
- khra bo: variegated/multicolored
- sna tshogs: manifold/various
- snang ba: appearance

**Logical Markers:**
- thal: absurd consequence
- 'gal: contradiction
- phyir: because

 <concept>
**Philosophical Context:** These refutations demonstrate the Madhyamaka dialectical method applied to Dzogchen ground theory. Each extreme position—universal acceptance, variegated appearance—leads to unacceptable consequences (thal ba). Longchenpa will establish that the ground transcends all positions while being their basis.

**Doxographical Relevance:** These five positions (with others to follow) represent the range of philosophical errors to be refuted:
1. Spontaneous presence alone
2. Indeterminate ground
3. Unchanging like space
4. Transformable
5. **Universal acceptability** (this section)
6. **Variegated appearance** (this section)
7. Pure non-establishment (to follow)

Longchenpa's positive presentation will show that primordial purity (ka dag) and spontaneous presence (lhun grub) are inseparable (dbyer med)—not two, not one.
