## Arising at the Rim of the Bindu

**The Heart Bindu:** The bindu within the heart, radiant with five colors, resembles a pellet of five-colored light. In size it is like a fish-eye. In its measure of light, like an eye in sleep. In its clarity, like the eye of a sky-goer with mind in motion.

At times, moved by the wind of pristine cognition, it quivers within the crystal-blue central channels and remains trembling. The bindu arisen through habituation is taken up in experience.

**The Three Fruition Thigles:**
1. **Light-ripened thigle** (*'od rnams smin pa'i thig le*): Arises vertically, extremely clear, unmixed like a rainbow
2. **Wisdom-ripened thigle** (*ye ses smin pa'i thig le*): Abides horizontally at the ribs, five-colored, radiating like the sun
3. **Rigpa-ripened thigle** (*rig pa smin pa'i thig le*): Round shape, holding the body of great purity within

**Visionary Development:**
The passage presents three stages of visionary progression:

1. **Light-Wall Appearance** (*'od kyi snam bu*): Initial visionary field—diffuse luminosity
2. **Ray-Thread Abiding** (*'od kyi zer thag tu gnas pa*): Light coalesces into ray-like threads
3. **Thigle Rim Arising** (*thig le'i mu khyud du 'char ba*): Concentration at the thigle's rim/edge

**Arising Signs:** From one aspect of characteristic-holding pristine cognition purified, light-curtains appear within the sphere of the senses. From that arise: boat-broken forms, flitting and darting, and dizziness. These appearances also arise as the thigle ripens through practice.

**Philosophical Context:** The thigle (*thig le*) represents the subtle energetic substrate of visionary experience in Dzogchen dark retreat practice. The progression from dispersed light to structured rays to concentrated spheres mirrors the meditative trajectory from dispersion to stability.
