## Illusion (Sgyu) in Dzogchen

**Core Teaching:** Nothing is established as objects. Through unestablished awareness and wisdom, beyond speech and thought, merely in ultimate truth, existing as the manner of illusion.

**Tantric Citation (Mother):** "All phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion. Nirvana is also like a dream, like an illusion. If something more excellent than nirvana exists, that also is like a dream, like an illusion."

**Two Truths Application:**
- **Conventional truth:** All phenomena are merely various objects and consciousness
- **Ultimate truth:** Even illusion does not abide—since there are no objects or aspects, even self-aware experience does not exist

 <concept>
## Three Positions on Illusion

**1. Illusion as Established Reasoning:** Asserting illusion as valid reasoning establishes something as real
**2. Appearance as Merely Illusion:** Asserting that appearance is merely illusion—deceptive
**3. Merely Illusion:** Various divisions beyond measure

These represent the "autonomous lower" positions—philosophical errors that fail to recognize the Dzogchen view.

## Ultimate Truth: Non-Abiding

**Key Point:** In ultimate truth, not even illusion abides. Since objects and aspects do not exist, even self-aware experience does not exist—like a barren woman's son, there is no meeting consciousness.

**When awakening from a dream:** The appearance of horse and ox stops. Conventional truth is not true; ultimate truth is non-abiding.

**Key Terms:**
- sgyu: illusion/maya
- yul: object
- rig pa: awareness
- ye shes: wisdom
- de bzhin nyid: suchness
- kun gzhi: all-ground
- gnyis med: non-dual

**Two Truth Framework:**
- Convention (kun rdzob): phenomena appear as objects and consciousness
- Ultimate (don dam): even illusion does not abide—empty of establishment

**Philosophical Context:** This passage engages with the Svatantrika-Madhyamaka distinction between conventional and ultimate truth. The "dream-like" (sgyu mar) simile appears throughout Madhyamaka literature (e.g., Nagarjuna's MMK). However, Dzogchen extends this: not only are phenomena like dreams, but even the awareness of dreams is the self-manifesting wisdom (rang snang gi ye shes)—not a consciousness apprehending objects, but the spontaneous display of the ground.

**Doxographical Placement:** The three illusion positions represent errors:
1. Reifying illusion as a valid cognitive tool (establishes something)
2. Dismissing appearance as merely deceptive (nihilism)
3. Endless conceptual divisions about illusion (proliferation)

The correct Dzogchen view recognizes that illusion is neither established nor rejected—it is the self-liberating (rang grol) display of awareness itself.

**Cittamatra Connection:** The passage also addresses Cittamatra (sems tsam) teachings—phenomena as "merely various objects and consciousness" (sna tshogs yul dang rnam shes tsam). This represents the "appearances as consciousness" view. Dzogchen differs: appearances are not merely consciousness but the self-radiance (rang gsal) of wisdom itself.

The ultimate point: when awakening from the dream of appearance, there is no awakening to find—only the self-luminous wisdom that was never deluded.
