. Second vision: increasing experience (nyams gong 'phel) preliminary and nature visions.

[5159-5161] <structure>
Longchenpa establishes the preliminary visions (sngon 'gro'i snang ba) that arise as the second vision begins to dawn. The structure organizes five specific visionary phenomena: up-stand (yar 'dzegs), wing (gshog), boat-part (gru cha), part (cha), and cloth (ras) visions. Each vision is correlated with its arising cause and what it purifies. The text demonstrates systematic progression from preliminary signs to actual second vision experience, following the Nyingma schema of progressive familiarization.

 <context>
The presentation of visionary phenomena reflects the detailed taxonomy of thod rgal experiences documented in the Snying thig ya bzhi and Longchenpa's Mthong ba don ldan commentary. The temporal markers—day three, seven, fourteen—indicate the intensive practice periods required for each vision to mature. The phrase "one-arise one-cease" (gcig 'byung gcig 'gag) describes the rhythmic nature of visionary unfolding where each vision supersedes the previous.

 <philology>
The term sngon 'gro (preliminary/before-going) carries its technical sense of preparatory experiences before the main vision. The compound yar 'dzegs (up-stand) describes vertical visionary extensions like banners or pillars. The term gshog (wing) indicates horizontal expansions. The phrase gru cha (boat-part) uses nautical metaphor for curved visionary forms. These technical terms require precise understanding to distinguish between ordinary optical phenomena and authentic thod rgal visions.

 <concept>
The epistemology of preliminary visions is sophisticated: these are not merely hallucinations but diagnostic indicators (rtags) of energetic and cognitive shifts. The concept of dag byed (purifier) indicates that each vision arises to purify specific obscurations—up-stand purifies desire, wing purifies delusion, and so forth. This reflects the Dzogchen understanding that visionary experiences serve both as signs of progress and as active agents of purification.

[5162-5168] <structure>
The section transitions from preliminary visions to the actual second vision (nyams gong 'phel gyi snang ba) proper. The structure identifies three characteristic signs that the preliminary phase is ending: cessation of conceptuality (rtog pa), arising of awareness self-essence vision (rig pa rang ngo'i snang ba), and connection of points (thig 'brel). Each stage has specific temporal and causal markers.

 <context>
The emphasis on conceptuality ceasing (rtog pa 'gags) reflects the Dzogchen teaching that conceptual mind must dissolve before wisdom can fully manifest. The "hanging-cord" (thag gcig) metaphor indicates the single thread of awareness that connects all visionary experiences. The citation structure prepares for the upcoming scriptural quotations that validate these experiences.

 <philology>
The term rig pa rang ngo (awareness self-essence) carries the technical Dzogchen sense of recognizing awareness's own face. The compound thig 'brel (point-connection) refers to the linking of bindus (thig le) into visionary chains or networks. The phrase thabs shes rab (method and wisdom) indicates the non-dual nature of these advanced experiences. The temporal specification "day three, seven, fourteen" (zhag gsum bdun bcu bzhi) reflects the traditional timeframes for thod rgal practice.

 <concept>
The phenomenology of increasing experience reflects progressive non-conceptuality: as conceptuality ceases, awareness's self-essence becomes visible. The concept of nyams gong 'phel (experience increasing/maturing) indicates that earlier glimpses of luminosity now expand and stabilize. The distinction between preliminary (sngon 'gro) and actual (dngos gzhi) visions reflects the Dzogchen teaching that recognition deepens through progressive familiarization.

. Five points connecting: wisdom entry and scriptural citation.

 <structure>
This subsection presents the five-point connection vision (thig lnga 'brel ba'i snang ba) where the five wisdoms enter the practitioner's experience. The structure describes the transition from single-point to multi-point visionary experiences, culminating in citation from Thal 'gyur (Consequence/Result Tantra) that validates the vision using nautical metaphor (boat-part/victory-banner).

 <context>
The five-point vision indicates the activation of the five Buddha families (rigs lnga) and their associated wisdoms. The citation from Thal 'gyur establishes scriptural authority for the vision's characteristics: colors as five lights, measure seen as boat-only, and the victory-banner form. This reflects the Nyingma emphasis on grounding visionary experiences in canonical sources.

 <philology>
The term ye shes lnga (five wisdoms) refers to the transformation of the five afflictions into their wisdom counterparts. The compound thig lnga (five points/bindus) indicates the geometric arrangement of visionary spheres. The phrase rgyal mtshan (victory-banner) describes vertical visionary forms that signal success in practice. The poetic verse employs seven-syllable lines with parallelism characteristic of tantric literature.

 <concept>
The five wisdoms represent the full manifestation of enlightened qualities: mirror-like wisdom (discriminates without grasping), equality wisdom (recognizes all as equal), discriminating wisdom (distinguishes without confusion), action-accomplishing wisdom (engages effortlessly), and dharmadhātu wisdom (knows ultimate nature). The concept of thig 'brel (connection) indicates that these wisdoms are not separate acquisitions but interconnected aspects of single awareness.

. Self-Arising Tantra citation: recognition of self-face and impossibility of samsara.

 <structure>
The section presents the second major scriptural citation from Rang byung rgyud (Self-Arising Tantra), using eight lines of verse to establish the characteristics of authentic second vision experience. The structure moves from spatial specification (upper joint finger-four) through capacity distinction (good-capacity person) to rhetorical questions about samsara entry and concluding with temporal markers (moment sixteen).

 <context>
The citation from Rang byung establishes that authentic vision leads to recognition of self-face (rang ngo), making samsara entry impossible. The "finger-four" (sor bzhi) measurement indicates the spatial extent of visionary experiences. The temporal specification "moment sixteen" (skad cig bcu drug) refers to the duration of clear light experience. This reflects the Nyingma understanding that advanced practice transcends ordinary spatiotemporal limitations.

 <philology>
The term rang ngo shes (knowing self-face/recognition) carries the crucial Dzogchen sense of self-recognition without intermediary. The phrase sor bzhi (four finger-widths) provides a concrete measurement for visionary extent. The rhetorical question "how possible enter samsara?" ('khor ba la 'jug pa ji ltar) underscores the irreversibility of recognition. The verse employs rhetorical devices including rhetorical questions and temporal markers.

 <concept>
The philosophical claim here is radical: authentic vision makes samsara entry impossible not because external conditions change but because recognition transforms the relationship to all experience. The concept of skye med (unborn/unproduced) is implicit—when awareness is recognized as never having entered samsara, the notion of "entering" becomes incoherent. The temporal marker "moment sixteen" indicates that time itself is transcended in this recognition.

. Third vision: awareness arriving at measure (rig pa tshad phebs) general and particular.

 <structure>
This section initiates the third vision presentation with two divisions: general showing of vision manner (snang tshul spyir bstan) and particular explanation of nature (rang bzhin bye brag tu bshad pa). The structure describes five complete visions (up-stand, wing, boat-part, part, cloth) and their liberative function, followed by additional visionary forms (net, eye lines, canopy) and their transcendence of the five aggregates.

 <context>
The third vision (rig pa tshad phebs) represents the maturation point where awareness reaches full measure. The five liberations from binding (zhen las grol) correspond to the five poisons transformed into five wisdoms. The transcendence of world-self-three-two ('jig rten bdag gnyis gsum) indicates overcoming the dualistic perception of world and self. This reflects the Nyingma systematic presentation of progressive liberation.

 <philology>
The term tshad phebs (arriving at measure) indicates full maturation or completion. The compound zhen las grol (liberated from binding/attachment) describes freedom from grasping. The phrase phung po lnga (five aggregates) refers to the standard Buddhist analysis of personal existence. The term chos nyid kyi lta ba (dharmatā view) indicates the ultimate perspective from which all phenomena are pure.

 <concept>
The soteriological mechanism here is transformative: each vision liberates specific bindings—up-stand from desire, wing from aversion, boat-part from delusion, part from pride, cloth from jealousy. The concept of chos nyid dag pa'i byin rlabs (pure blessing of dharmatā) indicates that liberation comes not from deliberate effort but from recognition of primordial purity. The transcendence of "world-self-three-two" reflects the dissolution of subject-object duality.

. Particular explanation: five colors and five wisdoms with specific forms.

 <structure>
This section provides the particular explanation of vision manner organized by the five Buddha families. The structure presents each family with its wisdom, color, form, and resonance: Vajra family (mirror-like, white, vajra unmovable), Tathāgata family (dharmadhātu, blue/blue-black), Jewel family (equality, yellow, jewel source), Lotus family (discriminating, red, infinite), Karma family (action-accomplishing, green, actual accomplish).

 <context>
The systematic correlation of families, wisdoms, colors, and forms reflects the comprehensive taxonomy of tantric Buddhism integrated within Dzogchen. Each family purifies its corresponding poison: Vajra purifies aversion, Tathāgata delusion, Jewel pride, Lotus desire, Karma jealousy. The outer sequence (blue vajra fence) indicates that these wisdoms are non-dual despite appearing distinct.

 <philology>
The term rigs (family/Buddha family) carries the sense of lineage or category. The compound ye shes (wisdom) is qualified by specific types: me long lta bu (mirror-like), mnyam pa nyid (equality), so sor rtog pa (discriminating), bya ba grub pa (action-accomplishing), chos dbyings (dharmadhātu). The color terms (dkar, sngo, ser, dmar, ljang) indicate the standard five-color system. The resonance terms (sgra) describe the energetic quality of each wisdom.

 <concept>
The integration of five wisdoms reflects the complete transformation of consciousness: the five afflictions are not destroyed but recognized as the five wisdoms. The concept of rigs su dag pa (purification as family) indicates that purification is recognition of intrinsic purity rather than removal of impurity. The blue vajra fence surrounding all indicates that dharmadhātu wisdom encompasses and unifies all other wisdoms.

. Path sequence and final visions: from field-only to canopy tent.

 <structure>
This concluding section presents the path sequence (lam 'char rim pa) with specific timeframes for different capacities (great, middle, low), then describes the final visions: mirror-like shape eye spot, equality net half, discriminating flower heap, lotus thousand-possess, action-accomplish weapon, various wheel forms, dharmadhātu palace, and canopy tent. The structure moves from color-shape visions to fully formed visionary architectures.

 <context>
The temporal markers—five-five days for great diligence, seven-seven for middle, twenty-one for low—reflect the traditional understanding that capacity determines speed of attainment. The progression from simple forms (eye spot) to complex architectures (palace, canopy) indicates the maturation of visionary capacity. The final "canopy tent house" (bla gur g.yogs) represents the complete manifestation of the Buddha-field.

 <philology>
The term 'bad rtsol (diligence/effort) distinguishes three capacities: che (great), 'bring (middle), tha ma (low). The compound dngos grub (siddhi/accomplishment) indicates the result of successful practice. The visionary forms become increasingly elaborate: mig rtsibs (eye spot/spokes), dra ba (net), me tog (flower), padma stong ldan (thousand-possess lotus), bla gur g.yogs (canopy tent). Each term requires precise technical understanding.

 <concept>
The phenomenology of complete maturation suggests that visionary experience becomes increasingly stable and elaborate as recognition deepens. The concept of sna tshogs 'khor lo (various wheels) indicates the manifestation of all possible forms. The dharmadhātu palace (chos dbyings pho brang) represents the ultimate vision where space and awareness are inseparable. The canopy tent—a nomadic dwelling that is both temporary and complete—beautifully symbolizes the non-abiding nature of dharmakāya manifestation.
