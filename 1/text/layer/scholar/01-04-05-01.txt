Two Truths Framework
**Analysis:** This section establishes the two truths (*bden pa gnyis*) as the foundational framework for understanding Buddhist ontology and soteriology. Lines 2849-2861 present the false conventional (*log pa'i kun rdzob*)—appearances that function causally yet are empty when analyzed. Lines 2862-2872 present the true conventional (*yang dag kun rdzob*) and the ultimate truth (*don dam bden pa*), citing the Uttaratantra to ground the presentation in Indian Buddhist scholastic tradition. The structure follows the classic Indian *pramāṇa* method: establishing conventional appearance first, then transcending it through ultimate analysis.

**General Path Introduction:**

Longchenpa introduces the two truths (*bden pa gnyis*) as the basis for all Mahayana practice.

**From Root Wisdom (*rtsa ba'i shes rab*):**

All phenomena gathered by samsara and nirvana are gathered into the self-nature of the two truths.

**From Uttaratantra Commentary:**

```
All paths of truth are compounded.
All compounds are merely conventional.
That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—
The essence of emptiness, along with the subsequent measuring wisdom,
The peaceful aspect of elaboration, is the ultimate truth.
```

**Two-fold Ultimate Division:**

1. **Nominal Ultimate** (*rnam grangs pa'i don dam*):
   - Through reasoning that examines and dissects (*dpyod byed kyi rigs pas dpyad cing dbye ba na*)
   - When nothing is established as dharma-nature (*chos nyid du ma grub pa na*)
   - Wisdom realizing all as primordially dwelling arises in accord with its nature

2. **Verbal Ultimate** (*sgra ji bzhin pa'i don dam*)

**From Two Truths:**

The relationship between reasoning and realization established.

Vehicle of Characteristics Path
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the Vehicle of Characteristics (*mtshan nyid kyi theg pa*) as the path for practitioners with sharp faculties (*dbang po rno ba*) who rely on analytical reasoning (*rigs pa*) to realize the two truths. This corresponds to the *sūtra* approach, distinguished from the Vehicle of Fruition (*'bras bu'i theg pa*) or tantric approach. The presentation integrates the five paths (*lam lnga*) and ten grounds (*sa bcu*) of the Mahāyāna, grounded in the *Abhisamayālaṃkāra* and *Daśabhūmika* traditions. The citation from *Jug pa* (Entrance to the Middle Way) establishes the connection to Candrakīrti's *Madhyamakāvatāra*.

**Two-fold Division of Tenet Explanations:**

1. **Vehicle of Characteristics** (*mtshan nyid kyi theg pa*) — through methodological tradition
2. **Vehicle of Fruition** (*'bras bu'i theg pa*) — tantric approach

**Path for Sharp Faculties:**

Through the Vehicle of Characteristics, the path arises for:
- Sharp faculties (*dbang po rno ba*)
- Powerful mind-power (*sems kyi stobs ldan*)

**Basis:** Self-nature of the two truths (*gzhir gyur pa'i bden pa gnyis kyi rang bzhin*)

**Practice Framework:**

Knowing the two truths, the question becomes: *de ji ltar bsgom* — "how then to practice?"

**Fruit Presentation:**

Three divisions:
1. Path fruit
2. Complete perfection fruit
3. [Third aspect]

**From Entrance (*Jug pa*):**

```
The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear.
```

**Buddhahood Structure:**

- **Self-purpose** (*rang don*): Dharmakaya (*chos sku*)
- **Others' benefit** (*gzhan don*): Two form-bodies (*gzugs sku gnyis*)
- **Wisdom** (*shes rab*): Beholding all with two wisdoms
- **Activity** (*phrin las*): Working for beings until samsara emptied

Path and Ground Structure
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes the systematic structure of the bodhisattva path as understood in the Vehicle of Characteristics. The five paths (*lam lnga*)—accumulation, application, seeing, meditation, and no more learning—provide the progressive framework, while the ten grounds (*sa bcu*) describe the stages of realization. The "heat stages" (*drod gsum*) refer to the preparatory phase (*drod*) before the first ground, subdivided into outer, inner, and combined aspects. This taxonomy derives from the *Abhisamayālaṃkāra* and represents the standard Indian Mahāyāna path structure that Dzogchen presupposes and transcends.

**Five Paths of the Bodhisattva:**

1. **Accumulation** (*tshogs lam*)
2. **Application** (*sbyor lam*)
3. **Seeing** (*mthong lam*)
4. **Meditation** (*sgom lam*)
5. **No More Learning** (*mi slob lam*)

**Ten Grounds (*sa bcu*):**

1. Great Joy (*rab tu dga' ba*)
2. Stainless (*dri ma med pa*)
3. Luminous (*'od byed pa*)
4. Radiant ('*od 'phro ba*)
5. Difficult to Overcome (*sbyang dka' ba*)
6. Manifest (*mngon du gyur pa*)
7. Gone Afar (*ring du song ba*)
8. Immovable (*mi g.yo ba*)
9. Excellent Wisdom (*legs pa'i blo gros*)
10. Cloud of Dharma (*chos kyi sprin*)

**From Entrance (*'jug pa*):**

```
The peaceful body, like a wish-fulfilling tree, becomes clear.
```

**Fruit of Complete Perfection:**

Upon the ground of all-illumination (*kun tu 'od*):
- Self-purpose: Dharmakaya (*chos sku*)
- Benefit others: two supreme form-bodies (*gzugs sku*)
- Beholding all with two wisdoms (*shes gnyis*)
- Working for beings until samsara emptied

**Heat Stages (*drod gsum*):**

Through three aspects:
1. Outer heat (*phyi'i drod*)
2. Inner heat (*nang gi drod*)
3. Both together (*gnyis ka*)

**Outer Heat:**
- Second ground: stainless
- Entities appear as empty
- Practice of concentration
- Arises in two pure grounds

**Inner Heat:**
- Sixth ground: manifest
- Understanding pure knowable as empty

**Heat of Both:**
- Seventh ground: arises from pure
- Eighth: patience attained
- Ninth: peak reached
- Tenth: supreme dharma of world

Thus the ten grounds are obtained.

Uttaratantra and Two Truths
**Analysis:** The *Uttaratantra* (Treatise on the Sublime Continuum), attributed to Maitreya and transmitted through Asaṅga, provides the Indian Buddhist doctrinal foundation for this presentation. The fourfold division of ultimate truth—nominal, verbal, non-nominal, and truly authentic—reflects the *pramāṇa* distinction between conceptually-mediated understanding (*dpyad shes*) and direct realization (*mngon sum*). The "truly authentic ultimate" (*yang dag pa'i don dam*) corresponds to the Dharmadhātu as directly realized by āryas in meditative equipoise, while the nominal ultimate represents the inferential understanding accessible to ordinary beings through reasoning.

**From Uttaratantra Commentary:**

```
All paths of truth are compounded.
All compounds are merely conventional.
That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—
The essence of emptiness, along with the subsequent measuring wisdom,
The peaceful aspect of elaboration, is the ultimate truth.
```

**Two-fold Ultimate:**

1. **Nominal Ultimate** (*rnam grangs pa'i don dam*):
   - Through reasoning examining and dissecting
   - Nothing established as dharma-nature
   - Wisdom realizing all as primordially dwelling

2. **Verbal Ultimate** (*sgra ji bzhin pa'i don dam*)
3. **Non-nominal Ultimate** (*rnam grangs ma yin pa'i don dam*)
4. **Truly Authentic Ultimate** (*yang dag pa'i don dam*)

**From Two Truths:**

The relationship between analytical reasoning and direct realization established.
