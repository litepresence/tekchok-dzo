The Two-Fold Aggregate Classification
**Analysis:** This section continues the analysis of aggregates (*phung po skye mched*), establishing the fundamental bifurcation between conceptual aggregates (*rtog pa dang bcas pa*) of ordinary beings and non-conceptual aggregates (*rtog pa med pa*) of noble beings. This distinction reflects the standard Abhidharma taxonomy as interpreted through Dzogchen hermeneutics.

The text shifts to the second major category: *rten phung po* (basis-aggregates). Longchenpa establishes a fundamental bifurcation:

**Structure:**
1. *rtog pa dang bcas pa'i phung po* — Aggregates with thought (conceptual)
2. *rtog pa med pa'i phung po* — Aggregates without thought (non-conceptual)

**The Five Contaminated Aggregates (*zag bcas 'jig rten pa*):**

The presentation follows standard Abhidharma taxonomy, yet with Dzogchen hermeneutics:

1. **Form Aggregate (*gzugs kyi phung po*)**
   - Definition: *gzhig cing gzhom du rung ba* — suitable for destruction/disintegration
   - Philological note: *gzhig* (to break/destroy) implies impermanence (*mi rtag pa*) as intrinsic to form

2. **Feeling Aggregate (*tshor ba'i phung po*)**
   - Definition: *myong zhing sred par gyur pa* — experiencing and becoming desire
   - Key particle: *par gyur pa* (become-transformative) indicating the dynamic process where feeling ripens into craving

3. **Perception Aggregate (*'du shes kyi phung po*)**
   - Definition: *g.yo zhing yul la 'jug pa* — moving and entering objects
   - Analysis: *g.yo* (to move/flutter) captures the active, seeking nature of perception

4. **Formation Factors Aggregate (*'du byed kyi phung po*)**
   - Definition: *byed cing bag chags sogs pa* — doing and including latencies
   - Expansion: *sogs pa* indicates this aggregate encompasses all fifty-one mental factors (*sems byung*)

**Dzogchen Synthesis:** Even these "contaminated" aggregates will be reconceptualized as the five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) when recognized as self-liberated.

[1678-1684] <concept>
The Thought-Free Aggregates
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the five thought-free aggregates (*rtog pa med pa'i phung po*) as the enlightened counterparts to contaminated aggregates, representing the *'phags pa* (noble beings) who have transcended saṃsāric existence. These pure aggregates — concentration, wisdom, discipline, and complete liberation — constitute the constituents of enlightened embodiment.

Longchenpa presents the *rtog pa med pa'i phung po* (aggregates without thought) as the enlightened counterparts to the five contaminated aggregates. These are the aggregates of noble beings (*'phags pa*) who have transcended the world.

**The Five Pure Aggregates:**

1. **Concentration Aggregate (*ting nge 'dzin gyi phung po*)**
   - *zhi gnas dang lhag mthong gi rang bzhin* — nature of calm-abiding and insight
   - These are the twin wings of Buddhist meditation, here elevated to the aggregate level

2. **Wisdom Aggregate (*ye shes kyi phung po*)**
   - *rang rang gi nyon mongs pa las grol ba* — liberated from individual afflictions
   - Each of the five wisdoms liberates its corresponding affliction

3. **Wisdom Aggregate (*shes rab kyi phung po*)**
   - *rang dang spyi'i rang bzhin gzigs pa* — seeing the nature of particular and universal
   - Epistemological precision: *shes rab* (discriminating wisdom) cognizes both *rang mtshan* (specific characteristics) and *spyi mtshan* (general characteristics)

4. **Discipline Aggregate (*tshul khrims kyi phung po*)**
   - *dri ma'i phyogs las rnam par dag pa* — completely pure from the direction of stains
   - *Phyogs las* indicates directional transcendence—freedom from the entire dimension of defilement

5. **Complete Liberation Aggregate (*rnam par grol ba'i phung po*)**
   - *spros pa dang rtog pa las grol ba* — liberated from elaboration and thought
   - The culmination: freedom from both conceptual proliferation (*spros pa*) and discursive thinking (*rtog pa*)

The Training Path vs. Non-Training
**Analysis:** This section establishes the progressive purification of aggregates through the distinction between training (*slob pa*) and non-training (*mi slob pa*) stages. Aggregates on the training path remain "moistened" (*brlan pa*) by what must be abandoned, while non-training aggregates achieve complete purity (*rnam dag*) beyond the name "aggregate" itself.

Longchenpa introduces a crucial distinction between:
- *slob lam gyis bsdus pa* — gathered by the training path
- *mi slob pa'i dus* — the time when one is not training

**Technical Point:** The aggregates on the training path are still "moistened" (*brlan pa*) by the aspect of what is to be abandoned (*spang bya'i phyogs*). Only at the non-training stage (*mi slob pa*) do they become fully pure.

**Ultimate Liberation:** When completely liberated (*gcig tu grol ba'i tshe*), even the name "aggregate" does not remain. This references *phung po dag las shin tu rnam par 'grol ba* — "completely liberated from aggregates" — from the *Angulimala Sutra* tradition.

[1689-1703] <structure>
The Sun-Moon-Union Classification
**Analysis:** Longchenpa cites the *Nyi zla kha sbyor* (Sun-Moon-Union Tantra) to provide a tantric framework for understanding aggregates as either obscured by thought (*rtog pas sbags pa*) or naturally free from thought (*rang bzhin gyis med pa*). This classification reflects the Dzogchen distinction between mind (*sems*) and pristine awareness (*rig pa*).

Longchenpa cites the *Nyi zla kha sbyor* (Sun-Moon-Union Tantra) to provide a tantric framework for understanding the aggregates:

**Two-fold Classification:**
1. *rtog pas sbags pa'i phung po* — Aggregates obscured by thought
2. *rtog pa rnams rang bzhin gyis med pa'i phung po* — Aggregates naturally free from thought

**Obscured Aggregates (*rtog pas sbags pa*):**
The five contaminated aggregates arise from gathering (*'dus pa*):
- Form: from gathering all objects
- Feeling: from gathering all experiences
- Perception: from gathering all sense-holdings
- Formations: from gathering subtle afflictions
- Consciousness: from gathering all knowings

**Thought-Free Aggregates (*mi rtog pa'i phung po*):**
- Concentration: from gathering all concentrations
- Wisdom (liberation): since awareness itself is exhausted of outflows (*rig pa nyid zag pa zad pa*)
- Wisdom (discriminating): since that meaning appears without birth (*skye med*)

[1704-1705] <philology>
Completion of Pure Aggregates
**Analysis:** This section concludes the presentation of thought-free aggregates through philological analysis of the particle *phyir* (for the purpose of), demonstrating the teleological orientation of pure aggregates as means toward complete purification (*rnam dag*) and transcendence of all concepts (*rtog pa las 'das pa*).

The text concludes the five thought-free aggregates (*rtog pa med pa'i phung po*):

4. **Discipline Aggregate (*tshul khrims kyi phung po*)** — *dri ma rnams mngon du dag pa'i phyir* — for the purpose of manifestly purifying stains
5. **Complete Liberation Aggregate (*rnam par grol ba'i phung po*)** — *rnam par rtog pa thams cad las 'das pa'i phyir* — for transcending all concepts

The particle *phyir* (for the purpose of) indicates teleological orientation—these aggregates function as means toward complete purification.

The Twelve Sense Sources (*skye mched bcu gnyis*)
**Analysis:** Longchenpa transitions to the twelve sense sources (*skye mched bcu gnyis* = āyatanas), analyzing their etymology (*gang las skye zhing mched*) as "that which arises from what and becomes expanded." The bifurcation into grasped (*gzung ba*) and grasper (*'dzin pa*) reflects the standard Abhidharma structure adapted for Dzogchen exposition.

Longchenpa turns to the third major category: *rnam pa skye mched* (the distinctive characteristics of sense sources). The etymology is key: *gang zhig gang las skye zhing mched par gyur pas* — "that which arises from what and becomes expanded."

**The Twelvefold Structure:**

**Grasped Sense Sources (*gzung ba'i skye mched* — objects):**
1. Form (*gzugs*) 
2. Sound (*sgra*)
3. Odor (*dri*)
4. Taste (*ro*)
5. Dharma (*chos*)
6. Touch (*reg*)

**Grasper Sense Sources (*'dzin pa'i skye mched* — faculties):**
1. Eye (*mig*)
2. Ear (*rna ba*)
3. Nose (*sna*)
4. Tongue (*lce*)
5. Mind (*yid*)
6. Body (*lus*)

**Temporal Analysis:**
- Object (*yul*) = previous moment (*sng llogs*)
- Sense-consciousness (*dbang shes*) = present moment (*da ltar ba*)
- Expansion (*mched pa*) = the arising process itself

The Sun-Moon-Union Tantra (*nyi zla kha sbyor*) provides the authoritative source for this twofold division.

[1728-1731] <concept>
The Faculties (*dbang po*)
**Analysis:** Longchenpa establishes the faculties (*dbang po* = indriya) as powers that exercise control (*dbang byed*) over the apprehension of objects. The classification into form faculties (*gzugs can*) and wisdom faculties (*shes rab kyi cha*) reflects the standard six (*ṣaḍ-indriya*) from the *Abhidharma-samuccaya*, here integrated into the Dzogchen presentation of sense-power nature.

**Etymology:** *yul 'dzin pa las dbang byed pas na dbang po* — "they are called faculties because they have power over grasping objects."

**Two-fold Classification:**

1. **Form Faculties (*gzugs can dang po'i cha las byung ba*)** — arising from the portion of form-possessing:
   - Five sense faculties (*mig gi dbang po*, etc.)
   - Mind faculty (*yid kyi dbang po*)

2. **Wisdom Faculties (*shes rab kyi cha las byung ba*)** — arising from the portion of wisdom:
   - Faith (*dad pa*)
   - Effort (*brtson 'grus*)
   - Mindfulness (*dran pa*)
   - Concentration (*ting nge 'dzin*)
   - Wisdom (*shes rab*)
   - Mental peace (*yid bde*)

This division maps onto the standard five (*pancha-indriya*) plus one (*yid bde*) from the Abhidharma-samuccaya tradition.
