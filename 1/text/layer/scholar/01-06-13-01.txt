Four Kayas' Perfections and Dharmakaya Presentation

**Analysis:**
- **<structure>** This passage describes the four pure lands (*zhing khams*) of the four kayas with five perfections (*phun sum tshogs pa lnga*) each, beginning detailed presentation of Dharmakaya: teacher, location, teaching, retinue, time, field, dharma, and activity.

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *bsam gyis mi khyab pa'i dbye bas rgyas par bshad pa* (extensive explanation through inconceivable divisions), *sku bzhi'i zhing khams phun sum tshogs pa lnga lnga* (four kayas' pure lands each with five perfections), *chos sku'i ston pa dpal kun tu bzang po* (Dharmakaya teacher glorious Samantabhadra), *gnas chos kyi dbyings* (location: dharmadhātu), *bstan pa sangs rgyas thams cad kyi thugs kyi bstan pa* (teaching: all Buddhas' mind teaching), *'khor 'dus ma byas pa* (retinue: unconditioned), *dus chos nyid la 'pho 'gyur med pa* (time: dharmatā without transition-change), *zhing khams rnam par dag pa de nyid dang brjod du med pa* (field: pure that itself and inexpressible), *chos brjod du med pa* (dharma: inexpressible), *'thad pa gang la gang 'dul du sprul pas na sprul sku'i* (valid: emanating to whatever needs taming, therefore Nirmanakaya), *rang gzhon gyi don gnyis rdzogs pa'i 'phrin las* (activity: completing two benefits for self and other), *phun sum tshogs pa lnga* (five perfections), *brjod du med pa dang lhun gyis grub pa gnyis* (inexpressible and spontaneous two), *dbang bzhi'i sa bon bzhi dang 'bras bu bzhi* (four empowerment seeds and four fruitions), *bcu drug smin pa* (sixteen maturations).

- **<concept>** 
  **Four Kayas' Pure Lands with Five Perfections Each:**
  - The four kayas' fields each have five perfections
  - 4 kayas × 5 perfections = 20 + 8 (inexpressible and spontaneous) = 28? Or: four empowerment seeds and four fruitions = 8; total sixteen maturations
  
  **Dharmakaya Valid Establishment:**
  - Teacher: Glorious Samantabhadra
  - Location: Dharmadhātu
  - Teaching: All Buddhas' mind teaching
  - Retinue: Unconditioned
  - Time: Dharmatā without transition-change
  - Field: Pure that itself and inexpressible
  - Dharma: Inexpressible
  - Valid: Because emanating to whatever needs taming, therefore called Dharmakaya
  - Activity: Through effortless spontaneous dharmatā door
  
  **Calculation:** Five perfections + inexpressible + spontaneous = 7? Or the five plus two aspects = Dharmakaya valid establishment. Four empowerment seeds + four fruitions = eight; sixteen maturations produce these.

Four Kayas as Nature of All

**Analysis:**
- **<context>** The four kayas' nature is the four symbol-bodies (*rtags kyi sku bzhi*). Page concludes with peaceful body (*zhi ba'i sku*) teacher: self-knowing awareness king, unconditioned, abiding in citratna palace.

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *de thams cad kyi rang bzhin rtags kyi sku bzhi* (four symbol-bodies as nature of all), *chos sku'i ston pa rang bzhin ma bcos pa* (Dharmakaya teacher unmodified nature), *stong pa kun khyab* (empty all-pervading), *'dul stangs rnam dag* (pure taming mode), *rang bzhin yongs dag* (completely pure nature), *nges med sna tshogs* (various without definite), *zag pa rang zad* (outflows self-exhausted), *chos kyi phung po 'dus pas* (Dharma-aggregates gathered), *las bdag tu med pa'i las byed pa* (doing actions without self), *gzugs sku'i ston pa sku snang la rang bzhin med pa zhal kun tu thal le ba* (Form body teacher face completely penetrating, natureless in appearance), *phyi dang nang med pa kun tu yang nang du gyur pa* (no outer or inner, all becoming inner), *chos dang chos ma yin pa rnam par 'byed pa* (distinguishing dharma and non-dharma), *snang ba dang mi snang ba* (appearing and non-appearing), *spros bzhi'i tshig tsam du byung ba* (arising as merely four elaborations' words), *zhi ba'i sku* (peaceful body), *rang shes rig gi rgyal po* (self-knowing awareness king), *ma bcos pa* (unconditioned), *citta ratna* (citra jewel), *gzhal med khang* (immeasurable palace).

- **<concept>** The four kayas represent progressively subtle dimensions of Buddha-nature: Nirmanakaya (active manifestation), Svabhavikakaya (essential purity), Dharmakaya (emptiness/pervasiveness), Form Body (appearance without nature). The "symbol-body" (*rtags kyi sku*) indicates these are seals or markers of realization. The peaceful body teacher—self-knowing awareness king—abides in the citratna (citra jewel) immeasurable palace, representing the ground of all kayas.

Dharmakāya Perfections

**Dharmakāya Field:**
Pure field that itself inexpressible,

Unstained spontaneously present dharmatā door—called Dharmakāya.

**Five Perfections:**
1. Inexpressible
2. Spontaneously present
3. Eight: four empowerment seeds and four results
4. Ripened from eight

**Saṃbhogakāya Perfections:**
Teacher Vairocana Gangchen Tsho,
Location Dense Array,
Teaching self-arisen six letters' self-sound tongue's light rays emanating teaching's single son,
Retinue not separate eyes four families' Buddhas,
Time naturally pure great.

Field in palm-joining's sole,
Above below stacked twenty-five,
Below lotus sixteen,
Those also above below viewed as stacked layers like,
Between pure sky separated dwelling,
Mutually above below tent house spread like,
Individual iron mountain and lake surrounded dwelling.

Dharma: own nature naturally pure great Dharma engaging.
Reason: light and color body and wisdom engaging—called saṃbhogakāya.

That also light rays entering father's face, secret place emerging mother's space, emanating emanations.

The Wrathful Heruka and Sense-Power Clairvoyances

**Analysis:**
- **<structure>** This passage completes the four-kaya presentation with the wrathful body (*khro bo'i sku*), then enumerates sense-power clairvoyances (*dbang po'i mngon shes*). Organization: (1) wrathful Heruka teacher, location, teaching, retinue, time, field, dharma, and activity, (2) summary of sixteen sets of four (=64) related to empowerment and fruition, (3) six hundred sixty-six powers purifying six migrations' karma and afflictions, (4) thirty-six sense-power clairvoyances (six per sense).

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *khro bo'i sku'i ston pa* (wrathful body's teacher), *ye shes kyi he ru ka* (wisdom Heruka), *gnas bhandha 'bar ba'i gzhal yas khang* (Bhandha blazing palace), *klad pa dung khang dkar po* (skull conch house white), *bde chen gyi 'bar 'dzag* (great bliss blazing dripping), *sgron ma rnams pa bzhi* (four lamps), *ye shes rang 'khyil ba'i dus* (wisdom self-swirling time), *mig gi dbang po mthong ba ma 'gags pa* (eye sense-power seeing not-ceasing), *gzugs kyi de bzhin nyid* (form's thusness), *yul dang shes pa la khros pas* (fierce toward object and knowledge), *thog mar mthong ba rnam par dag pa* (first view purify), *zag pa med pa'i mngon par shes pa* (outflow-free superknowledge), *dbang po'i mthong ba rnam par dag pa'i mngon par shes pa drug* (six superknowledges of purified sense-power view), *dus gsum dus gcig la mthong ba* (seeing three times as one time), *pra sen mthong ba* (seeing like prasena).

- **<concept>** The wrathful body presentation mirrors the peaceful structure but emphasizes fierce activity (*khros pa*) toward object-knowledge. The eightfold structure (teacher, location, teaching, retinue, time, field, dharma, activity) applies to each kaya. The summary calculation: sixteen fours (=64) for empowerment/fruition plus sixteen fours (=64) for bodies = 128; combined as 108 + 28 = 128 empowerment fruition perfections. The clairvoyances of purified sense-power view: six sense powers (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) each with six superknowledges = 36. These correspond to knowing the thirty limbs of existence (*srid pa yan lag sum cu*).

[9613-9622] <context>
Sense-Power Clairvoyances Detailed

**Analysis:**
- **<context>** Detailed enumeration of six superknowledges for each sense power:
  - **Eye (6):** know all forms
  - **Ear (6):** understand all spoken sounds
  - **Nose (6):** definite arrival at six migrations' karma
  - **Tongue (6):** know six migrations' circles and enjoyments
  - **Body (6):** know all six migrations' forms—atoms and gross
  - **Mind (6):** know all six migrations' thoughts

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *mig gi mngon shes drug* (six eye superknowledges), *gzugs thams cad shes* (know all forms), *rna ba'i mngon shes drug* (six ear superknowledges), *brjod pa'i sgra thams cad gtan la phebs* (definite arrival at all spoken sounds), *sna'i drug* (six nose), *'gro ba drug gi las gtan la phebs* (definite arrival at six migrations' karma), *lce'i drug* (six tongue), *'gro drug gi 'khor dang longs spyod shes* (know six migrations' circles and enjoyments), *lus kyi drug* (six body), *'gro drug gi gzugs rdul phran dang rags pa thams cad shes* (know all six migrations' forms atoms and gross), *yid kyi drug* (six mind), *'gro drug gi bsam pa thams cad shes* (know all six migrations' thoughts).

- **<concept>** These thirty-six sense-power clairvoyances (6 senses × 6 each) enable the practitioner to perceive completely across all six migrations (*'gro ba drug*). The "definite arrival" (*gtan la phebs*) indicates direct, non-conceptual perception. Line 9622 notes that through subtracting from the division-basis, thirty sense-power clairvoyances exist—knowing the thirty limbs of existence.

Thirty-Two Major Marks and Wisdom Superknowledges

**Analysis:**
- **<structure>** This passage establishes: (1) thirty-two major marks (*mtshan sum cu rtsa gnyis*) arise from thirty-two empowerments, (2) wisdom-view superknowledges (*ye shes kyi mthong ba rnam par dag pa'i mngon shes*) in sets of six, (3) thirty wisdom superknowledges from thirty-two empowerments.

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *mtshan sum cu rtsa gnyis grub pa* (thirty-two marks complete), *shes rab kyi mthong ba rnam par dag pa'i mngon par shes pa drug* (six superknowledges of purified wisdom-view), *sbyangs pa'i shes rab* (trained wisdom), *bslab pa'i shes rab* (learned wisdom), *thos pa'i shes rab* (heard wisdom), *bsam byung gi shes rab* (thought-arisen wisdom), *sgom byung gi shes rab* (meditation-arisen wisdom), *tshig thams cad kyi brda don* (symbol-meaning of all words), *sems nyid chos nyid la 'jug pa* (mind itself entering dharmatā).

- **<concept>** The thirty-two major marks (major and minor marks of a Buddha) arise from thirty-two empowerments, establishing the somatic dimension of empowerment's effect. The wisdom-view superknowledges operate through five wisdom-types: (1) trained wisdom—understanding symbol-meaning of all words, (2) learned wisdom—special arising of entering dharmatā, (3) heard wisdom—knowing all sound and meaning, (4) thought-arisen wisdom—realizing aggregates of all dharmas, (5) meditation-arisen wisdom—knowing dharmas and mind mixed like sky. These thirty (6 × 5) arise from viewing the thirty-two qualities trained by Buddha.

The Five Wisdoms and Their Sixfold Superknowledges

**Analysis:**
- **<context>** Extended citation of the five wisdoms (*ye shes lnga*) each producing six superknowledges: (1) mirror-like wisdom, (2) equality wisdom, (3) discriminating wisdom, (4) accomplishing wisdom, (5) dharmadhātu wisdom, (6) non-abiding wisdom.

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *me long lta bu'i ye shes* (mirror-like wisdom), *mnyam pa nyid* (equality), *so sor rtog pa* (discriminating), *bya ba grub pa* (accomplishing), *chos kyi dbyings* (dharmadhātu), *mi gnas pa'i ye shes* (non-abiding wisdom), *ye shes kyi mig* (wisdom eye), *rdul med dri ma dang bral ba* (dustless and without defilement), *chos kyi mtshan nyid dang dgongs pa* (dharma's characteristic and intention), *'khor 'das gnyis su med pa* (samsara-nirvana non-dual), *'gro ba drug gi dbang po* (six migrations' sense-powers), *sangs rgyas kyi zhing khams* (Buddha-fields), *sangs rgyas kyi yon tan* (Buddha-qualities), *chos gang la yang mi gnas pa* (non-abiding in any dharma).

- **<concept>** Each of the five wisdoms produces six superknowledges:
  - **Mirror-like:** knowing dharma characteristics and intentions directly
  - **Equality:** knowing samsara-nirvana as non-dual
  - **Discriminating:** knowing six migrations' sense-powers
  - **Accomplishing:** knowing all dharmas effortless and all Buddha-fields
  - **Dharmadhātu:** knowing all Buddha-qualities
  - **Non-abiding:** knowing non-abiding in any dharma
  
  The "wisdom eye" (*ye shes kyi mig*) is obtained—dustless and without defilement. These thirty wisdom superknowledges arise from thirty-two empowerments.

- **<structure>** Line 9642: *de rnam par grol ba'i mngon shes drug 'char te*—"From that, six liberation superknowledges arise." This marks the transition to the next major set of superknowledges (completed on page 239).

- **<concept>** The pattern establishes: each "view" (wisdom-view, liberation-view, reality-view, body-speech-mind view) produces six superknowledges, organized in sets of thirty. The numerical structure reflects tantric numerology: 32 empowerments → 30 superknowledges (with remainder 2), building toward the total of 180.

Liberation Superknowledges and Body-Speech-Mind Activities

**Analysis:**
- **<structure>** This passage enumerates superknowledges arising from liberation (*rnam grol*) and deity identity (*lha ngo*), organized in sets of six: (1) liberation superknowledges (30 total), (2) body-speech-mind activity superknowledges (30 total), (3) reality-view superknowledges (30 total). Each set of six corresponds to exhaustion of outflows (*zag pa zad pa*) in body, speech, mind, sems, wisdom-aggregate, and dharma-dharmatā.

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *sems dang sems byung nub pa* (mind and mental-factors subside), *rnam grol dang po'i mthong ba rnam par dag pa'i mngon shes drug* (six clairvoyances of purified view of first liberation), *lus kyi zag pa zad pa* (exhaustion of body's outflow), *ngag gi zag pa* (speech's outflow), *yid kyi zag pa* (mind's outflow), *sems kyi zag pa* (sems's outflow), *shes rab kyi phung po la sgrib pa'i zag pa* (outflow of obscuration at wisdom-aggregate), *chos dang chos nyid kyi zag pa* (dharma and dharmatā outflow), *phyi nang gsang ba yongs rdzogs kyi dbang* (outer-inner-secret complete empowerment), *sku gsung thugs kyi las* (body-speech-mind activity), *sangs rgyas kyi mkhyen pa ma lus pa rdzogs pa* (complete Buddha knowledge without remainder).

- **<concept>** The structure presents liberation as progressive exhaustion of outflows (*zag pa zad pa*) through six stages: body (form) → speech (sound) → mind → sems (dualistic mind) → wisdom-aggregate → dharma/dharmatā. Each liberation produces six superknowledges, totaling 30 from the complete empowerment. The body-speech-mind activities manifest as: (1) body actual—seeing all Buddha bodies, (2) body appearance—engaging endless light-masses, (3) speech actual—engaging sixty speech-sounds, (4) speech appearance—engaging various sound-melodies, (5) mind actual—engaging all samadhis, (6) mind appearance—engaging knowing others' minds. These 30 arise from knowing the 32 deity identities.

Reality-View Superknowledges and Mind Transformation

**Analysis:**
- **<context>** Citation of reality-view (*chos nyid kyi mthong ba*) superknowledges: six arise at the time when dharmatā's intention abides without distinction. These focus on mind-transformation (*sems rnam par gdul ba*).

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *chos nyid kyi dgongs pa la dbyer mi phyed par bzhugs* (abide without distinction in dharmatā's intention), *sems rnam par gdul ba'i mngon shes* (clairvoyance of mind thoroughly trained), *sems kyi rang bzhin shes* (know mind's nature), *sems sbyang ba* (training mind), *rts ba shes* (know root), *sems zhi ba* (pacifying mind), *sems med pa'i mtshan nyid* (characteristic of mindless), *sems rnam par dag pa* (purifying mind), *mi 'gyur bar shes* (know unchanging), *sems mi ldog pa* (non-reversing mind), *khams gsum ming med par shes* (know three realms nameless), *sems las 'das pa* (transcending mind), *shes byed dang 'du 'phro dag* (pure knower and aggregate-emanation), *dbang gi rnam par 'phrul pa'i dbye ba* (transformation distinctions of empowerment).

- **<concept>** The six reality-view superknowledges map the progression of mind-transformation: (1) knowing mind's nature, (2) knowing root through training mind, (3) knowing mindlessness through pacifying mind, (4) knowing unchanging through purifying mind, (5) knowing three realms nameless through non-reversing mind, (6) realizing pure knower and aggregate-emanation without reversal through transcending mind. These 30 superknowledges (6 × 5 sets) arise from knowing the transformation distinctions of empowerment.

- **<philology>** Line 9670: *mthong ba dag pa'i mngon shes brgya brgyad cu ni mos pa'i mthong ba tsam las byung ba'o*—"The 180 clairvoyances of purified view arise from merely the view of devotion/faith." This establishes that even these advanced realizations depend on initial devotional commitment.

[9671] <structure> Transition to Elaboration-With Empowerments

**Analysis:**
- **<structure>** Line 9671 introduces the next subdivision: *de yang phye na mos pa'i bzhi bcu rtsa lnga lnga'i yon tan 'byung ba ni*—"That also, if divided, the forty-fivefold devotion, five-by-five qualities arising."

- **<concept>** This marks the transition to detailed analysis of how the 180 clairvoyances subdivide into 45 categories with five qualities each, which will be explained in the following passage (continuing on page 240).

Ground as Basis of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa

**Ground Definition:**
Ground (*gzhi*): basis of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—not one, not two.

From *Rang shar*:
"Ground thus
Basis of saṃsāra
Basis of nirvāṇa
Not one, not two
Basis thus"

**Three Aspects:**
1. **Essence** (*ngo bo*): emptiness
2. **Nature** (*rang bzhin*): luminosity
3. **Compassion** (*thugs rje*): power

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Ground three aspects
Essence, nature, compassion
Threefold ground
Complete thus"

**Not Same as Causal Ground:**
Ground here not causal ground of saṃsāra—primordial purity beyond cause-effect.

From *De nyid*:
"Ground not causal
Not result's ground
Beyond cause-effect
Ground thus"

**Three Modes of Ground:**
- **Ground as basis** (*gzhi gzhi*): dharmadhātu
- **Ground as origin** (*gzhi 'byung*): self-arisen wisdom
- **Ground as support** (*gzhi rten*): spontaneous presence

From *Rang shar*:
"Ground three modes
Basis, origin, support
Threefold modes
Ground complete"

Completion of Empowerment Superknowledges and Transitions to Samaya

**Analysis:**
- **<structure>** This passage completes the enumeration of superknowledges (*mngon shes*) arising from empowerments and transitions to the presentation of samaya (*dam tshig*). The organizational arc: (1) elaboration-with empowerments produce 180 clairvoyances, (2) elaboration-without empowerments produce 360 qualities, (3) totals reach 2,360 ground qualities + 660 wisdom actions + 3,120 dharmic synonyms, (4) colophon marking end of 6th section, (5) introduction to samaya as the crucial basis for Vajrayana practice.

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *spros bcas kyi dbang* (elaboration-with empowerment), *spros med kyi dbang* (elaboration-without empowerment), *rab tu spros pa med pa'i dbang* (completely elaboration-without empowerment), *brgya brgyad cu* (one hundred eighty), *thos pa rnam par dag pa'i mngon shes* (clairvoyance of purified hearing), *bsgyur gzhi'i don shes pa* (knowing the meaning of transformation-basis), *ye shes su dag pa* (purified as wisdom), *myong byed dag pa* (purified experiencer), *reg byed dag pa* (purified toucher), *mdo shes pa* (sutra-knowing), *chos dag pa'i mngon shes* (clairvoyance of purified dharma).

- **<context>** The numerical system reflects tantric numerology: 180 + 180 + 180 + 180 = 720; plus previous sets reaching 2,360 ground qualities, 660 wisdom actions, 3,120 dharmic categories. These constitute "Vajradhara's ground-clairvoyance transformations" (*rdo rje 'chang gi sa'i mngon shes kyi rnam par 'phrul ba*). The progression moves from elaborated (elaboration-with) to unelaborated (elaboration-without) to completely unelaborated empowerments, reflecting the Dzogchen trajectory from coarse to subtle.

- **<concept>** Longchenpa establishes the soteriological mathematics of empowerment: each level of purification (hearing, thinking, experiencing, touching, dharma) produces 180 clairvoyances. The distinction between elaboration-with/without reflects the tantric hermeneutic of progressive refinement—from conceptual (*spros bcas*) to non-conceptual (*spros med*) to completely non-conceptual (*rab tu spros pa med*). The colophon marks this as the first door of Secret Mantra Vajra Vehicle's crucial basis.

Colophon and Introduction to Samaya Presentation

**Analysis:**
- **<context>** Standard colophon formula: *Theg pa'i mchog rin po che'i mdzod las / gzhi'i don smin par byed pa dang dbang gi rnam par gzhag pa ste rim khang drug pa'o*—"From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle, the presentation of ripening the meaning of the ground and empowerment, the sixth section." This marks the closure of the empowerment chapter and pivot to samaya (*dam tshig*).

- **<structure>** The samaya presentation is organized into three topics: (1) samaya nature generally demonstrated, (2) body-speech-mind samaya specifically explained, (3) unsurpassable samaya supreme demonstrated. First topic has eight subdivisions: essence, definite-term, division, support, benefit, fault, repair-method, protect-method.

- **<philology>** Technical terminology: *gzhi'i don smin par byed pa* (ripening the meaning of the ground), *dbang gi rnam par gzhag pa* (empowerment presentation), *rim khang drug pa* (sixth section), *dam tshig* (samaya/sacred pledge), *nges tshig* (definite-term), *rten* (support), *phan yon* (benefit), *nyes dmigs* (fault), *bskang thabs* (repair-method), *bsrung thabs* (protect-method), *sngags kyi sdom pas rgyud bsdams pa'i gnyen po'i dpung* (antidote army binding continuum by mantra vow).

- **<concept>** Samaya is defined as the non-emitting (*mi mda' bar byed pa*) through the antidote army binding the continuum by mantra vow. This reflects the Vajrayana understanding of samaya as active engagement (*dam tshig*)—not mere restraint but empowered commitment. The eightfold analysis (essence, term, division, support, benefit, fault, repair, protection) provides comprehensive coverage of samaya theory and practice.

- **<structure>** The transition from empowerment to samaya follows tantric logic: empowerment (*dbang*) transmits authority; samaya (*dam tshig*) maintains that transmission through commitment. The phrase *bla na med pa gsang sngags kyi sgor zhugs so cog la dam tshig kho na gal che*—"for all who enter the door of unsurpassable Secret Mantra, samaya alone is crucial"—emphasizes the centrality of sacred commitment.
