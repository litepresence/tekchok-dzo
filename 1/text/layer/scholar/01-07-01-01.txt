Ground as Basis of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa

**Ground Definition:**
Ground (*gzhi*): basis of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—not one, not two.

From *Rang shar*:
"Ground thus
Basis of saṃsāra
Basis of nirvāṇa
Not one, not two
Basis thus"

**Three Aspects:**
1. **Essence** (*ngo bo*): emptiness
2. **Nature** (*rang bzhin*): luminosity
3. **Compassion** (*thugs rje*): power

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Ground three aspects
Essence, nature, compassion
Threefold ground
Complete thus"

**Not Same as Causal Ground:**
Ground here not causal ground of saṃsāra—primordial purity beyond cause-effect.

From *De nyid*:
"Ground not causal
Not result's ground
Beyond cause-effect
Ground thus"

**Three Modes of Ground:**
- **Ground as basis** (*gzhi gzhi*): dharmadhātu
- **Ground as origin** (*gzhi 'byung*): self-arisen wisdom
- **Ground as support** (*gzhi rten*): spontaneous presence

From *Rang shar*:
"Ground three modes
Basis, origin, support
Threefold modes
Ground complete"

Enumeration of Seven Samaya Categories
The text presents a comprehensive taxonomy of samaya (dam tshig) organized into seven distinct categories: (1) view samaya (lta ba), (2) conduct samaya (spyod pa), (3) practice samaya (bsgrub pa), (4) general samaya (thun mong), (5) special body-speech-mind samaya (sku gsung thugs), (6) branch samaya (yan lag), and (7) key-point definitive samaya (gal mdo nges pa). This enumerative structure follows classical tantric pedagogical conventions.

[9705-9707] <philology>
Root Tantra Citation
The opening citation from Dam tshig mchog gi rgyud employs the hermeneutical key "dam" as "bound" (bcings pa) and "indestructible vajra pledge" (rdo rje 'da' dka' gtan gyi gnyer), demonstrating etymological derivation typical of Nyingma tantric exposition. The term 'da' dka' (difficult to transcend) functions as a technical qualifier emphasizing the binding nature of these commitments.

[9709-9713] <context>
General Definition Framework
The general definition (spyi) of samaya as "one's own mind without deception, free from deceit and pretense" (rang sems tshig pa med pa la g.yo sgyu rnams dang bral ba) establishes the foundation for understanding tantric commitments not merely as external rules but as expressions of authentic mind-nature. This formulation bridges sutric ethics with tantric view.

[9715-9722] <concept>
Root and Branch Typology
The twofold classification into root (rtsa ba) and branch (yan lag) samaya—with root encompassing the three vajras (sku gsung thugs) and branch comprising twenty-five subdivisions organized into five groups of five—represents a classical organizational schema found throughout Sarma and Nyingma tantric literature. This structure demonstrates the systematic integration of ethical precepts with the three-body doctrine.

[9724-9742] <philology>
Enumerative Terminology Analysis
The sevenfold classification employs technical terminology distinguishing view (lta ba), conduct (spyod pa), practice (bsgrub pa), general (thun mong), particular (khyad par), branches (yan lag), and definitive key-points (gal mdo nges pa). The phrase "mdor bstan legs par yid la zung" (properly retain the abbreviated presentation) signals pedagogical intent for memorization and contemplation.

[9733-9790] <structure>
Essence, Nature, Compassion Triad

**Essence (*Ngo bo*):**
Definition: emptiness, non-arising, beyond extremes.
Characteristics: unborn, unceasing, unchanging.
From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Essence emptiness
Non-arising nature
Beyond extremes
Essence thus"

**Nature (*Rang bzhin*):**
Definition: luminosity, clarity, knowing.
Characteristics: clear, aware, luminous.
From *De nyid*:
"Nature luminosity
Clear aspect
Aware nature
Luminosity thus"

**Compassion (*Thugs rje*):**
Definition: power, capacity, expression.
Characteristics: unobstructed, all-pervading, manifesting.
From *Rang shar*:
"Compassion power
Unobstructed capacity
All-pervading expression
Compassion thus"

**Relation of Three:**
Essence empty, nature clear, compassion expressive—threefold wisdom.
Inseparable: essence not separate from nature, nature not separate from compassion, compassion not separate from essence.

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Three aspects three
Essence empty
Nature clear
Compassion expressive
Inseparable thus"

[9744-9765] <structure>
# The Basis of Samaya: Guru, Disciple, and Siblings
**Analysis:** Lines 9743-9765 establish the relational foundation (*rten*) of samaya through three categories: (1) guru (*slob dpon*), (2) disciple (*slob ma*), and (3) spiritual siblings (*mched lcam*). This triadic structure reflects the communal dimension of tantric practice.

**Line 9745:** *rten ni slob dpon dang slob ma mched lcam ste*—"the ground is teacher, student, and siblings"
- *rten* = basis, support, foundation
- Enumerative *ste* marks the threefold listing

[9747-9753] <context>
Guru-Disciple Protection Dynamic
**Analysis:** The citation from *de nyid* (the same text) establishes the protection dynamic:

**Lines 9747-9750:** *bsam gyis mi khyab dam tshig rnams / rnam pa gnyis su 'dus par gsungs / slob dpon dang ni slob ma gnyis / bsrung ba'i rgyu zhes kun tu grags*

"Inconceivable samayas are taught as gathered into two aspects: teacher and student are renowned as the cause of protection"

**Lines 9751-9753:** *bsrung ba'i rgyu ni slob dpon te / srung bar byed pa slob ma'o*

"The cause of protection is the teacher; the one who protects is the student"

**Key insight:** The guru embodies the samaya (*bsrung ba'i rgyu* = cause to be protected), while the disciple actively protects it (*srung bar byed pa* = protector/agent).

[9755-9764] <structure>
# Fourfold Classification of Spiritual Siblings
**Analysis:** Lines 9754-9764 present the four types of vajra siblings (*rdo rje'i spun*):

**Line 9756-9758:** *rdo rje'i spun la don bzhis bstan / spyi dang nye dang 'dres pa dang / dkyil 'khor bum pa 'dres pa'o*

"To vajra siblings taught through four meanings: general, close, mixed, and mandala-vase-mixed"

**The Four Types Detailed:**

1. **Line 9760:** *spyi'i mched*—General siblings
   - All who enter the teaching (*bstan par zhugs so cog*)
   - Especially all who enter secret mantra (*gsang sngags la zhugs pa thams cad*)

2. **Line 9761:** *nye ba'i mched*—Close siblings
   - Those of one dharma family (*chos rigs gcig pa*)
   - Share the same Buddha-family (*rigs*)

3. **Line 9762:** *'dres pa'i mched*—Mixed siblings
   - Gathered by one guru (*bla ma gcig gis bsdus pa*)
   - Same teacher, different empowerments

4. **Line 9763:** *shin tu 'dres pa'i mched*—Extremely mixed/intimate siblings
   - Same mandala, same butter lamp, same vase
   - Same empowerment time (*dbang dus gcig*)
   - Highest degree of samaya bond

[9765] <philology> Sevenfold Territory Marker
**Analysis:** *'di dag kyang yul bdun 'gyur gyis gnyan par shes par bya'o*—"These should be known as dangerous through sevenfold territory"

- *yul bdun* = seven territories/regions
- *'gyur gyis* = through becoming/transforming
- *gnyan pa* = dangerous, risky, heavy
- Indicates samaya violations occur across seven types of spatial/social boundaries

[9766] <structure> # Transition to Guru Classifications
**Analysis:** *slob dpon la'ang thams cad kyis slob dpon du bkur ba'i spyi'i slob dpon dang*—"As for the teacher: the general teacher honored by all as teacher..."

This introduces the next section on four types of gurus, continuing the systematic classification of samaya relationships.

[9767-9768] <structure>
# The Fourfold Guru Typology
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents a quadripartite classification (*dbye ba bzhi*) of spiritual teachers (*slob dpon*), establishing a graduated hierarchy of transmission roles. This typology maps onto the standard Nyingma *dbang lung khrid* (empowerment, transmission, instruction) triad with the addition of the "general" (*spyi*) category.

**The Four Teachers:**
1. **Dharma-Connection Teacher** (*rang nyid chos la sbyor ba 'dren pa'i slob dpon*)—The guru who initially introduces one to the Dharma path
2. **Samaya-Vow Empowerment Teacher** (*dam tshig dang sdom pa sbyin pa dbang gi slob dpon*)—The vajra master who bestows empowerments and commitments
3. **Instructional Reading Transmission Teacher** (*gdams ngag 'bogs pa lung gi slob dpon*)—The teacher who transmits esoteric instructions through formal reading authorization (*lung*)
4. **General Teacher** (*spyi*)—The foundational guide encompassing all aspects

The citation marker *de nyid las* (from that [text] itself) introduces scriptural authority for this classification.

[9771-9772] <philology>
Analysis of the Etymological Verses
**Analysis:** The versified etymology employs paronomasia (*sgra sbyor*) typical of tantric doxography:

- **Line 9770-9772:** *slob dpon la yang don bzhi ste*—"As for the teacher, moreover, [there are] four meanings"
  - *spyi* (general)
  - *'dren* (pull/guide)—from *dren pa* (to pull, guide, lead)
  - *dam tshig* (samaya)—the commitment bond
  - *dbang* (empowerment)—the initiatory transmission

The particle *yang* (also/moreover) indicates this enumeration supplements the previous categorization.

[9778-9778] <philology>
Etymology of "Teacher" (*slob dpon*)
**Analysis:** The text provides a Sanskrit-derived Tibetan etymology:

- **Line 9777:** *mi shes shes par 'grol phyir slob*—"Trains (*slob*) in order to liberate (*'grol*) not-knowing (*mi shes*) into knowing (*shes pa*)"
  - The ablative *phyir* indicates purpose/cause: training FOR liberation
  - *slob* = to train, study, practice (Skt. *śikṣā*)

- **Line 9778:** *rdzogs chen don la sbyor bas dpon*—"Teacher (*dpon*) through connecting (*sbyor*) to the Dzogchen meaning"
  - *sbyor ba* = application, connection, engagement
  - *dpon* = master, lord, chief (Skt. *upādhyāya*/*ācārya*)

The instrumental *bas* indicates agency: "through/by means of connecting."

[9780-9781] <philology>
Etymology of "Student" (*slob ma*)
**Analysis:** The etymological derivation (*nges tshig*) of *slob ma* parses the term into *slob* (to train/learn) and *ma* (the nominalizer indicating agent), with the compound signifying "one who trains." The *Rang shar* citation specifies the training modality as *ma yengs tshul gyis nyan pas*—through listening (*nyan pa*) in an undistracted (*ma yengs*) manner. This philological precision underscores that Dzogchen transmission requires attentive reception as the foundational discipline, distinguishing the qualified vessel (*snod*) from ordinary hearers.

- **Line 9780:** *ma yengs tshul gyis nyan pas slob*—"Trains through listening without distraction"
  - *ma yengs* = undistracted (negation of *yengs*—distraction)
  - *tshul gyis* = by manner/method (instrumental)
  - *nyan pas* = through hearing/listening (ablative of agency)

- **Line 9781:** *man ngag snod du gyur pas ma*—"Student (*ma*) through becoming a vessel (*snod*) for instructions"
  - *snod* = vessel, receptacle (Skt. *bhājana*)
  - This establishes the receptivity requirement: the student must be capable of receiving teachings

[9783-9784] <concept>
The Proper Guru-Disciple Relationship
**Analysis:** Lines 9782-9784 establish the prerequisites for authentic transmission:

- **Line 9782:** *de ltar don ldan dpon slob ni*—"Such meaningful guru-disciple [relationship]"
  - *don ldan* = possessing meaning/substance (not merely formal)

- **Line 9783:** *yang dag sa la mnyam por gnas*—"Abides equally on the correct ground"
  - *yang dag* = correct, authentic, proper
  - *sa* = ground, level, stage (Skt. *bhūmi*)
  - *mnyam por gnas* = abiding equally (in the same view/understanding)

- **Line 9784:** *dam tshig ldan na de bzhin no*—"If possessing samaya, it is like that"
  - The conditional *na* establishes samaya as the necessary condition for the relationship's authenticity

[9787-9791] <context>
Scriptural Authority on Samaya Benefits
**Analysis:** The citation from *de nyid* (likely referring to a root tantra or commentary) establishes the soteriological efficacy of samaya:

- **Line 9788:** *dam tshig sdom pa ji bzhin gnas*—"Abiding in samaya-vow as-it-is"
  - *ji bzhin* = as-it-is, correctly, properly

- **Line 9790:** *bsam pa thams cad mthar phyin 'gyur*—"All intentions become fully completed"
  - *mthar phyin* = reaching the end, completion, perfection (Skt. *pāripūri*)

This establishes samaya observance as the sufficient condition for accomplishing all aims.

[9792-9850] <philology>
Synonyms and Distinctions

**Essence Synonyms:**
- Dharmadhātu (*chos dbyings*)
- Suchness (*de bzhin nyid*)
- Tathātā (*de bzhin nyid*)
- Dharmatā (*chos nyid*)
- Emptiness (*stong pa nyid*)

From *De nyid*:
"Essence synonyms
Dharmadhātu, suchness
Tathātā, dharmatā
Emptiness, etc."

**Nature Synonyms:**
- Luminosity ('*od gsal*)
- Awareness (*rig pa*)
- Self-arisen wisdom (*rang byung ye shes*)
- Natural clarity (*rang gsal*)

From *Rang shar*:
"Nature synonyms
Luminosity, awareness
Self-arisen wisdom
Natural clarity"

**Compassion Synonyms:**
- Power (*nus pa*)
- Capacity (*rtsal*)
- Expression (*rtsal*)
- Energy (*rlung*)

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Compassion synonyms
Power, capacity
Expression, energy
Various"

**Important Distinction:**
Essence not mere emptiness; nature not mere clarity; compassion not mere power—each contains all three.

From *De nyid*:
"Essence not mere emptiness
Nature not mere clarity
Compassion not mere power
Each complete thus"

[9793-9796] <context>
*Māyājāla* Citation on Blessing
**Analysis:** The citation from *sgyu 'phrul* (Guhyamāyājāla-tantra) establishes the lineage transmission dynamic:

- **Line 9793:** *dam tshig mchog la gang gnas pa*—"One who abides in supreme samaya"
- **Line 9795:** *sras dang spun dgongs byin gyis rlob*—"Sons and siblings [receive] mind-blessing"
  - *sras* = spiritual sons (disciples)
  - *spun* = siblings (*mched grogs*—vajra siblings)
  - *dgongs* = intention/mind (Skt. *citta*)
  - *byin gyis rlob* = blessing (Skt. *adhiṣṭhāna*)

The instrumental *yis* (variant of *gyis*) indicates the means by which blessing occurs.

[9798-9819] <structure>
# The Three Samaya Categories and Their Violation
**Analysis:** The text transitions from benefits to consequences, establishing:
1. The three doors (*sgo gsum*) of samaya: Body, Speech, Mind
2. The graduated consequences of transgression
3. The distinction between teacher's and student's violations

[9799-9805] <context>
*Rang shar* Citation on Mutual Destruction
**Analysis:** The citation from *rang shar* (Self-Arisen) Tantra establishes:

- **Line 9799:** *nyams na gnyis ka 'tshig par 'gyur*—"If declined, both burn/are destroyed"
  - *nyams* = decline, degenerate, transgress
  - *'tshig* = burn, destroy, ruin (also: to be damned)

- **Line 9803:** *dpon gyis nyams na sbyang thabs med*—"If the teacher declines, there is no method of purification"
- **Line 9805:** *slob mas nyams na sbyang thabs yod*—"If the student declines, there is a method of purification"

This asymmetry reflects the tantric hierarchy: the teacher's violation is more severe and irreparable.

[9801-9802] <concept>
Body Samaya Violation Consequences
**Analysis:** The *Rang shar* establishes graduated consequences for body samaya violation (*sku yi dam tshig nyams pa*), prescribing birth in the great vajra hell (*rdo rje dmyal ba chen po*)—the most severe torment in the Buddhist cosmological hierarchy reserved specifically for transgressors of vajrayāna commitments. This severity reflects the doctrine that bodily actions, being most accessible to consciousness, carry immediate karmic weight. The specification that teacher violations lack purification methods (*sbyang thabs med*) while student violations allow restoration underscores the hierarchical asymmetry (*bla ma slob ma'i dbye ba*) in tantric ethics.

- **Line 9800-9802:** Violation of body samaya (*sku yi dam tshig*) results in:
  1. *rdo rje dmyal ba chen por 'tshed*—Burning in great vajra hell
  2. *'o dod 'bod pa'i gnas su skye*—Birth in the "wailing-crying" realm

The term *rdo rje dmyal ba* (vajra hell) indicates the most severe torment reserved for those who break vajrayāna commitments.

[9807-9810] <concept>
Speech Samaya Violation Consequences
**Analysis:** The karmic retribution for speech samaya transgression (*gsung gi dam tshig nyams pa*) manifests through sensory deprivation—the cessation of appearances (*snang ba 'gags pa*) and birth in the darkness-dust realm (*mun rdul chen po'i gnas*)—followed by communicative impairment in subsequent rebirths (*lkugs pa dag tu skye ba*). This graduated consequence reflects the principle of correspondence (*rgyu 'bras mthun mong*) between transgression and result: violating sacred speech results in losing the capacity for meaningful communication. The *Rang shar* thus establishes speech-violation as distinct from body-violation in its phenomenological consequences while maintaining equivalent soteriological severity.

- **Line 9806-9808:** Violation of speech samaya (*gsung gi dam tshig*) results in:
  1. *snang ba 'gags par 'gyur*—Cessation of appearances (sensory deprivation)
  2. *mun rdul chen po'i gnas su skye*—Birth in the "darkness-dust" realm

- **Line 9809-9810:** Even after emerging from that realm:
  *lkugs pa dag tu skye bar 'gyur*—Birth among mutes

This establishes a karmic continuity where speech-violation results in communicative impairment across lifetimes.

[9812-9818] <concept>
Mind Samaya Violation Consequences
**Analysis:** Mind samaya violation (*thugs kyi dam tshig nyams pa*) precipitates the most complex karmic consequences, manifesting across cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal dimensions. The *Rang shar* enumerates birth in the great mind-disturbance realm (*yid 'khrugs chen po'i gnas*), characterized by unceasing conflict (*rtag tu rtsod pa*), and mental deterioration spanning from dullness (*dran pa rengs pa*) to madness (*smyo 'bog nad*). This tripartite consequence—external strife, internal instability, and ultimate cognitive dissolution—reflects the Dzogchen view that mind (*sems/nyid*) is the ground of both bondage and liberation, making its violation particularly catastrophic for spiritual progress.

- **Line 9811-9814:** Violation of mind samaya (*thugs kyi dam tshig*) results in:
  1. *yid 'khrugs chen po'i gnas su skye*—Birth in the "great mind-disturbance" realm
  2. *rtag tu rtsod pa rgyun mi 'chad*—Unceasing continuum of quarreling
  3. *'thab dang sdug bsngal chen po*—Fighting and great suffering

- **Line 9815-9817:** Mental consequences:
  - *dran pa med par 'gyur*—Becoming without mindfulness
  - *dran pa rengs par 'gyur*—Mindfulness becoming dull/stiff
  - *smyo 'bog nad kyis thebs par 'gyur*—Being struck by madness-demon sickness

- **Line 9818:** Final result: *tha ma ngu 'bod gnas su skye*—Finally birth in the wailing-cry realm

The enumeration demonstrates the graduated severity: body-violation leads to hell, speech-violation to sensory deprivation, mind-violation to mental illness and interpersonal conflict.

[9821-9835] <structure>
# Portents of Samaya Deterioration
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents a graduated typology of negative portents (*snga ltas*) that indicate samaya deterioration. The structure moves from general misfortune to specific physiological, environmental, and interpersonal signs.

**The Portent Categories:**
1. **General Misfortune** (9821)—Various forms of unhappiness
2. **Disease Manifestations** (9822-9823, 9829)—Epidemic, fever, leprosy, skin diseases
3. **Spirit Aggression** (9824-9826)—Malevolent spirits (*gdon*) and misleaders (*log 'dren*) causing death and hell-rebirth
4. **Sensory Impairment** (9827-9828)—Loss of sight and hearing, failed activities
5. **Social Calamity** (9830-9833)—Thieves, royal punishment, unusual plagues, death of children and spouse, lands becoming hostile
6. **Existential Futility** (9834)—Actions becoming meaningless

[9821] <philology> Analysis of *snga ltas*
**Analysis:** The term *snga ltas* (early signs/portents) combines:
- *snga* = early, before, prior (temporal precedence)
- *ltas* = sign, omen, portent (indicative phenomenon)

The genitive *nyams pa'i* (of deterioration) establishes these as signs belonging-to/samaya-transgression. The locative *su* marks the context: "in the case of/at the time of."

[9822-9824] <context>
The Buddhist Theory of Misfortune
**Analysis:** This enumeration reflects the Indo-Tibetan Buddhist understanding that spiritual transgression manifests in worldly misfortune. The sequence follows the *karma-vipāka* (action-ripening) framework:

- **Line 9821:** *mi bde rnam pa sna tshogs*—"Various forms of unhappiness"—the general category
- **Line 9822:** *yams dang 'tshe ba'i nad*—"Epidemic and harming diseases"—collective calamity
- **Line 9823:** *rims nad*—"Fever diseases"—specifically infectious disease
- **Line 9824:** *gdon dang log 'dren*—"Spirits and misleaders"—supernatural aggression

The particle *kyis* (instrumental) in line 9824 establishes agency: these spirits cause harm.

[9827] <philology> Analysis of Hell Rebirth Formula
**Analysis:** *bsad nas sems can dmyal bar 'gro*—"Having been killed, go to hell"

- *bsad nas* = having been killed (past participle of *gsod*)
- *sems can* = sentient beings
- *dmyal bar* = to hell (dative/locative)
- *'gro* = go

This laconic formulation encapsulates the tantric warning: malevolent spirits kill the transgressor, who then takes rebirth in hell.

[9828-9829] <concept>
Sensory Karmic Retribution
**Analysis:** The text establishes specific correspondences between samaya-transgression and sensory impairment:

- **Eye damage** (9827): *mig gis gzugs mi mthong*—"Eyes not see form"
  - Corresponds to failing to "see" the guru's nature
- **Ear damage** (9828): *rna ba 'on*—"Ears hearing"
  - *'on* (hearing) paired with *las mi 'grub* (actions not accomplished)
  - Corresponds to failing to "hear" the teachings properly
- **Skin disease** (9829): *mdze dang shu ba*—"Leprosy and itch"
  - Physical manifestation of "impurity"

[9831-9834] <context>
Social and Environmental Consequences
**Analysis:** The enumeration extends to the socio-political realm:

- **Line 9830:** *chom rkun rgyal po'i chad pa*—"Thieves and royal punishment"—breakdown of law and order
- **Line 9831:** *gzhan la med pa'i rims nad*—"Fevers non-existent to others"—unique/unusual plagues marking the individual
- **Line 9832:** *bu dang chung ma 'chi bar ston*—"Children and wife shown to die"—familial destruction
- **Line 9833:** *yul rnams thams cad dgrar ldang*—"All lands rise as enemies"—environmental hostility
- **Line 9834:** *byas pa don med*—"Done [actions] meaningless"—existential futility

The instrumental *zhing* (and) in 9833 connects the land-enmity with the meaninglessness.

[9837-9866] <structure>
# The Threefold Restoration (bskang thabs)
**Analysis:** Having established the consequences of transgression, Longchenpa presents the three methods of restoration corresponding to body, speech, and mind samayas.

**The Structure:**
1. Body samaya restoration (9837-9842)
2. Speech samaya restoration (9843-9850)
3. Mind samaya restoration (9851-9859)
4. General protection methods (9860-9866)

[9838-9842] <context>
Body Samaya Restoration
**Analysis:** The citation from *de nyid* (the same [text]) prescribes:

- **Line 9839:** *gsung rab rgya chen bklag pa*—"Reading extensive scriptures"
- **Line 9840:** *tshogs kyi 'khor lo rgya chen bskor*—"Extensively turning the gaṇacakra"
  - *tshogs kyi 'khor lo* = feast wheel/assembly circle (Skt. *gaṇacakra*)
  - The tantric communal feast gathering
- **Line 9841:** *'khor gsum yang dag bya*—"Correctly performing the three circles"
  - The three circles (*'khor gsum*) refer to:
    1. Offerer (the practitioner)
    2. Offered-to (the deities/guru)
    3. Offerings (substances)
  - "Correct" (*yang dag*) implies non-dual operation

[9844-9850] <context>
Speech Samaya Restoration
**Analysis:** The restoration (*sbyang thabs*) of speech samaya employs fire rituals (*mar me cho ga*) and continuous confession (*rgyun bshags*) to purify vocal transgressions. The specification of "hundred" (*brgya rtsa*) lamps and recitations represents the standard numerical completeness in tantric praxis, while the identification of this practice as *na rag rgyun bshags* (continuous Naraka confession) connects it to the hell-terminating liturgies of the *Ma rgyud* corpus. This restorative methodology reflects the broader Nyingma principle that transgressions, while severe, remain ultimately purifiable through appropriate ritual engagement—a distinction that privileges the student (*slob ma*) over the teacher (*slob dpon*) whose violations the *Rang shar* deems irreparable.

- **Line 9845:** *mar me brgya rtsa'i cho ga*—"Ritual of the hundred [butter] lamps"
  - *brgya rtsa* = "hundred base"—a standard complete number
  - Fire offering to purify speech-obscurations

- **Line 9846:** *spang skong brgya rtsa gdon pa*—"Reciting the hundred confessions and repairs"
  - *spang* = confession (of faults)
  - *skong* = repair, restoration
  - *gdon pa* = to recite, read aloud

- **Line 9850:** *spang skong ni na rag rgyun bshags so*—"Confession-repair is continuous confession of Naraka"
  - Identifies this practice as the *Narakāntaka* (Hell-ender) confession
  - *rgyun* = continuous, stream

[9852-9898] <structure>
Ground's Characteristics and Nature

**Ground's Six Characteristics:**
1. **Not created** (*ma byas*): not produced by causes
2. **Not destroyed** (*ma bcom*): not destroyed by conditions
3. **Unchanging** (*mi 'gyur*): beyond change
4. **Spontaneously present** (*lhun grub*): naturally perfect
5. **Beyond concepts** (*rtog pa las 'das*): inexpressible
6. **All-pervading** (*khyab pa*): pervading all

From *Rang shar*:
"Ground six characteristics
Not created, not destroyed
Unchanging, spontaneous
Beyond concepts, all-pervading
Sixfold complete"

**Ground's Threefold Purity:**
1. **Primordially pure** (*ka dag*): pure from beginning
2. **Naturally pure** (*rang bzhin gyis dag*): pure by nature
3. **Completely pure** (*yongs su dag*): pure of adventitious stains

From *Thal 'gyur*:
"Ground three purities
Primordial, natural, complete
Threefold purity
Ground thus"

[9852-9859] <context>
Mind Samaya Restoration
**Analysis:** The restoration of mind samaya focuses on guru-pleasure (*mnyes pa*):

- **Line 9853:** *slob dpon mnyes pa'i rdzas kyis mchod*—"Offering with substances pleasing to the teacher"
  - *rdzas* = substance, material
  - The instrumental *kyis* indicates the means of offering

Methods of Protection
**Analysis:** Prevention supersedes restoration:

- **Line 9861:** *skyon yon mthong nas*—"Having seen faults and qualities"
  - Discriminative awareness of what to abandon and adopt

- **Line 9861:** *dran pa dang shes bzhin dag pas rgyud sdom pa*—"Binding the continuum with pure mindfulness and awareness"

Teacher-Student Responsibility Distinction
**Analysis:** The text distinguishes protection responsibilities:

- **Teacher (9867):** *slob dpon gyis rgyud dang dam tshig gi rim pa shes pas zhes bcus bsrungs*—"The teacher protects through knowing the stages of continuum and samaya"
  - The instrumental *pas* marks knowledge as the means
  - *zhes bcus* (by ten) refers to the ten knowledges listed next

- **Student (9868):** *slob mas mi shes pas slob dpon gyi bka' bzhin bsrung*—"The student, not knowing, protects according to the teacher's command"
  - The causal *pas* (from not-knowing) establishes student-deference
  - *bka' bzhin* = according to command/instruction (Skt. *ājñā*)

[9870-9871] <structure>

Scriptural Summary on Protection Methods
**Analysis:** The citation from *de nyid* encapsulates the relationship between knowledge and protection:

- **Line 9881-9882:** *shes pa gcig gi khyad par gyis / khyad par bcu yis bsrung thabs 'phags*—"Through the distinction of one knowledge, the protection method distinguished by ten is transcendent/exalted"
  - One comprehensive knowledge (*gcig*) gives rise to tenfold differentiated application (*bcu*)
  - The instrumental *gis* marks agency

- **Line 9883:** *gcig la de bas nyung ba'o*—"In one, it is less than that"
  - Contrasts partial knowledge with comprehensive knowledge

# Introduction to Three-Vajra Samaya
**Analysis:** Longchenpa transitions to the second major section (*gnyis pa*): the particular explanation (*bye brag tu bshad pa*) of body-speech-mind (*sku gsung thugs*) samaya. This follows the general discussion with specific enumeration.

The structure follows the *Thal 'gyur* (Consequence) tradition:
1. Empowerment-based commitments (*dbang la brten pa'i dam tshig*)
2. Aggregated into body-speech-mind
3. Applied to yogi's body-speech-mind
4. Focused on guru, vajra, and siblings
5. Distinguished by protective domain

[9888] <philology> Reference to *Thal 'gyur*
**Analysis:** *thal 'gyur las*—"From the Consequence [Tantra]"

The *Thal 'gyur* (*Thal pa'i 'gyur* or *Prasāraṅga*) is a major Nyingma tantra, one of the *sPyi rgyud* (General Tantras). Citation establishes scriptural authority for the three-vajra framework.

[9889-9895] <philology>
The Six-Line Summary
**Analysis:** The citation provides a mnemonic summary (*mdor bsdus*):

- **Line 9888:** Empowerment-based samaya explained
- **Line 9890:** Aggregated: body, speech, and mind
- **Line 9891:** Yogic body, speech, mind applied
- **Line 9892:** Focus: guru, vajra, siblings
- **Line 9893:** Distinguished by protective domain (*bsrung ba'i yul gyis*)
- **Line 9894:** Vows gathered into body and empowerment
- **Line 9895:** Vajra-secret place should be held

# The Ninefold Body Samaya Schema
**Analysis:** The three-vajra system subdivides each vajra into outer (*phyi*), inner (*nang*), and secret (*gsang ba*), then each of those into three subcategories (*phyi'i phyi* etc.), yielding 27 total, though the text focuses on the first three.
