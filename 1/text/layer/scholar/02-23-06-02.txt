. Six groups of six faculties: abhijñā and retentive powers.

[34626-34632] <structure>
Longchenpa establishes a complex numerical analysis organizing faculties into six groups of six (tshogs drug tshogs drug), totaling one hundred thirty-four portions (cha). The structure delineates: (1) the twenty-four faculties of the second and third stages, (2) the six faculties each of the remaining three stages, (3) classification into six groups: the thirty-six's fifth—the six faculties with outflows (zag bcas), the first group's six faculties seeing beyond—thirty without outflows (zag med), and the last, utterly without outflows. The structural logic reflects the progressive purification of faculties from with-outflows to utterly-without-outflows.

 <philology>
The term dbang po (faculty/organ) carries its Abhidharma technical sense as the capacities for cognition and action. The compound zag bcas (with outflows) refers to faculties contaminated by afflictions, while zag med (without outflows) indicates purified faculties. The number drug cu rtsa drug (thirty-six) likely refers to specific combinations of the six faculties (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) in different states. The term cha (portion/part) indicates subdivisions within the broader classification. The particle tshogs (group/assembly) indicates collections of related faculties.

 <concept>
The numerical taxonomy here serves a soteriological purpose: tracking the progressive purification of faculties through practice. The "outflows" (zag pa) are the afflictions that flow out from the faculties, binding the practitioner to samsara. As practice deepens, faculties transform from with-outflows (ordinary perception) to without-outflows (sacred perception) to utterly-without-outflows (complete purification). This reflects the Dzogchen teaching that faculties themselves are not obstacles but their contamination is—purification reveals their innate wisdom nature.

. Six clairvoyances arising in the bardo.

 <structure>
This subsection presents the six abhijñās (mngon shes drug/six clairvoyances) that arise for the practitioner in the bardo state. The structure enumerates: (1) knowledge of previous realms (sngon gyi gnas shes pa), (2) knowledge of death and transmigration ('chi 'pho shes pa), (3) knowledge of birth (skye shes pa), (4) knowledge of others' minds (gzhan sems shes pa), (5) knowledge of all hidden appearances (sbas pa'i snang ba shes pa), (6) seeing and knowing the six realms (rigs drug mthong shes pa). The citation from Nyi zla kha sbyor (Sun-Moon Union) provides scriptural authority.

 <context>
The six clairvoyances represent the natural capacities of mind when unobscured by afflictions. In the bardo state, these capacities manifest spontaneously as the practitioner navigates between death and rebirth. The Nyingma presentation integrates these classical Buddhist attainments within Dzogchen: they are not supernatural powers acquired through effort but natural manifestations of awareness when recognized. The term chos nyid bar do (dharmatā bardo) indicates that these capacities arise within the recognition of ultimate nature, not through ordinary mind.

 <philology>
The term mngon shes (abhijñā/clairvoyance) carries its technical Buddhist sense of supernormal knowledge. The compound sngon gyi gnas (previous realms/abodes) refers to knowledge of past lives. The phrase 'chi 'pho (death and transmigration) indicates knowledge of the death process and subsequent rebirth. The term skye shes (birth knowledge) indicates knowledge of where and how one will be reborn. The compound gzhan sems shes pa (knowledge of others' minds) refers to telepathic capacity. The term sbas pa (hidden/secret) indicates phenomena not perceptible to ordinary senses.

 <concept>
The epistemology of abhijñā in Dzogchen differs from lower vehicles: these are not extraordinary attainments but the natural functioning of awareness when unobscured. The concept of chos nyid bar do (dharmatā bardo) indicates that these capacities arise within the recognition of emptiness, not as accomplishments of ordinary mind. The six clairvoyances demonstrate that enlightenment is not the acquisition of new powers but the revelation of innate capacities. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching of rang 'byung (self-arisen)—these capacities arise spontaneously from the ground of awareness.

. Retentive powers and meditative absorption in dharmatā bardo.

 <structure>
This subsection presents the fourth and fifth aspects: (4) retentive powers (gzungs) arising in the dharmatā bardo, (5) manner of meditative absorption arising. The structure describes retentive powers: previously heard Dharma appearing simultaneously, innumerable Dharma categories never before heard also arising. The meditative absorption section describes: mind's engagement exhausted in dharmatā's purity, abiding non-conceptually, exhaustion in one's own continuum, appearance-rain of qualities exhausted in dharmatā's purity. The concluding simile compares this state to pure space.

 <context>
The retentive powers (gzungs) represent the capacity to remember and access all Dharma teachings—not merely those previously learned but also "never-before-heard" teachings that arise spontaneously from wisdom. This reflects the Nyingma understanding that the bardo is not merely a transitional state but an opportunity for complete realization. The meditative absorption (ting nge 'dzin) described here is not ordinary concentration but the natural samādhi of dharmatā recognition—"bad conceptuality does not arise at all" (nyon mongs rtog pa ci yang mi 'byung).

 <philology>
The term gzungs (retentive powers/dhāraṇī) carries its technical sense as mnemonic and cognitive capacities. The phrase sngon thos chos (previously heard Dharma) refers to teachings already learned. The term sngon ma thos pa (never before heard) indicates teachings arising spontaneously from wisdom, not memory. The compound thugs brtson (mind's engagement/mental effort) indicates deliberate cognitive activity that is "exhausted" (zad) in dharmatā's purity. The simile nam mkha' dag pa (pure space) illustrates the empty yet luminous nature of this absorption.

 <concept>
The philosophical depth here is significant: retentive powers are not mere memory but the capacity of wisdom to manifest all teachings spontaneously. The "never-before-heard Dharma" indicates that wisdom itself is the source of teaching, not external transmission. The exhaustion of mind's engagement in dharmatā's purity indicates transcendence of deliberate effort—meditation becomes natural abiding. The appearance-rain of qualities exhausted in dharmatā's purity indicates that even sublime experiences must dissolve into ultimate nature. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching that the path culminates in the dissolution of path itself.

. Spontaneous presence's dissolution: the eight modes.

 <structure>
This subsection presents the sixth aspect: spontaneous presence's dissolution manner (lhun grub 'gags tshul). The structure describes eight dissolution modes arising simultaneously: compassion dissolving into compassion, appearance-rain of six families, light dissolving into light. The similes employed—sun's rays gathering at sunset, rainbow dissolving in space—illustrate natural dissolution without loss of essence. The structure emphasizes that dissolution is not destruction but gathering-back (bsdus pa) into the ground.

 <context>
The dissolution of spontaneous presence represents the final stage where all manifest qualities return to the ground. The six families (rigs drug) refer to the Buddha families or the six realms—all manifestations of compassion. The Nyingma presentation emphasizes that dissolution is natural (lhun grub), not forced—like sunset or rainbow fading, the process is effortless. This reflects the Dzogchen understanding that cessation of appearance is not nihilistic void but the ground's self-release.

 <philology>
The term lhun grub (spontaneous presence) carries its technical Dzogchen sense as the effortless manifestation of qualities. The verb 'gags (dissolve/cease) indicates not destruction but return to source. The phrase thugs rje (compassion) here refers to the dynamic, manifesting aspect of awareness. The term rigs drug (six families) encompasses all possible manifestations. The simile nyi ma'i 'od zer (sun's rays) illustrates natural withdrawal. The term 'ja' tshon (rainbow) indicates luminous appearance that naturally fades.

 <concept>
The phenomenology of dissolution is crucial: spontaneous presence dissolves not into nothingness but into itself—compassion into compassion, light into light. This indicates that qualities are not lost but recognized as the ground's own nature. The eight modes of dissolution (gnas lugs brgyad) likely refer to the dissolution of the eight consciousnesses or eightfold manifestation. The similes emphasize naturalness—just as sunset and rainbow are natural processes without force, dissolution is the ground's spontaneous release. This reflects the Dzogchen teaching that the fruition is the recognition that manifestation and emptiness were never separate.
