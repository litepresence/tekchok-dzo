. The nature of awareness: no good-bad distinction, no transfer or change.

[29398-29402] <structure>
This section addresses the fundamental nature of awareness (rig pa) as beyond moral dualities and temporal changes. The structure presents the non-dual nature of awareness through various temporal states: delusion and meditation, wandering and passing, sleep and waking, coming and going—all equally manifestations of awareness without essential good or bad.

 <philology>
The term rig pa (awareness/pristine cognition) here carries its technical Dzogchen sense as the ground of all experience, unaffected by the content of experience. The compound 'pho 'gyur med (without transfer or change) employs double negation to emphasize absolute stability. The exclamation e ma ho marks the shift to poetic expression from the Self-Arisen tantra.

 <context>
The teaching that awareness has no good-bad distinction reflects the Dzogchen view that primordial purity (ka dag) transcends moral categories. This is not moral relativism but the recognition that the ground of awareness is prior to the dualistic mind that judges good and bad. The "precious jewel nectar" (rin chen bdud rtsi) metaphor indicates that awareness is inherently precious and nourishing, whether recognized or not.

 <concept>
The ontology presented here is carefully non-dual: samsara and nirvana are not different substances but different modes of recognizing the same awareness. The metaphor of losing a jewel in the king's treasury—suffering from its absence even while it remains present—aptly illustrates the paradox of non-recognition. The concept of "self-arisen from self, realized by self" (rang las rang byung, rang gis rang rtogs) emphasizes that awareness cannot be created or destroyed by external agency.

[29400-29414] <structure>
The core section presents the poetic verses from Self-Arisen tantra: the precious jewel nectar lost at beginningless time, wandering wrongly in suffering, yet having no place to be found by searching—only self-realized.

[29414-29427] <structure>
The conclusion presents the treasury metaphor: losing the jewel in the king's treasury and suffering from its absence, then finding it and experiencing joy—both occurring within the same treasury, neither moving from it. This illustrates that samsara and nirvana arise from the state of awareness without entering elsewhere.

. Lamp-pressing practice: preliminary characteristics of place and method.

[29428-29441] <structure>
This section transitions to practical instruction: the three aspects of lamp-experience—preliminary characteristics of place, actual lamp-pressing method, and manner of appearance-arising. The structure presents the preparatory requirements before specific techniques.

 <philology>
The term sgron la gtub pa (lamp-pressing) refers to the specific technique of applying pressure to the eye area to stimulate visionary experience. The compound mi g.yo gsum (three immovables) likely refers to body, gaze, and mind remaining stable. The phrase sgrub pa'i gnas (accomplishment place) indicates a location conducive to practice, whether natural (secluded direction, charnel ground) or constructed (dark retreat room).

 <context>
The preparatory requirements—abandoning all actions of this life, making the lama pleased, sitting in darkness with three immovables, perfecting lama yoga—reflect the serious commitment required for Thögal practice. The citation from Thal 'gyur (Consequence/Result Tantra) establishes scriptural authority for the retreat conditions. The emphasis on solitude (gcig pu gnas) and abandoning companions indicates that this practice requires isolation from social distraction.

 <concept>
The phenomenology of retreat presented here suggests that external conditions significantly affect internal experience. Darkness (mun pa) serves as a catalyst for visionary experience by removing ordinary visual stimulation. The "three immovables" (mi g.yo gsum) indicate that body, gaze, and mind must all be stabilized for advanced practice. This reflects the Dzogchen understanding that liberation is not escape from conditions but recognition within them.

[29441-29452] <structure>
The core section begins the actual lamp-pressing method: placing on AH (the syllable at the heart) and entering clearly—two aspects.
