## Bardo: The Intermediate State

**Core Definition:** Bardo is the state where external phenomena appear to internal mind—the intermediate state between death and rebirth.

**Twofold Typology:**
1. **Pure Dharmatā Bardo:** Appearance as empty essence and wisdom—self-radiance of ground-appearance
2. **Impure Delusion Bardo:** Appearance of six realms as confused—ordinary samsaric experience

**Key Question:** Between pure and impure dharmas, where does bardo exist? Answer: In the interval of primordial purity—from space of primordial purity, dissolves back into primordial purity.

**Doxographical Context:** This presents the Nyingma four bardo classification from the Karling Zhitro terma cycle. The passage establishes that both pure and impure bardos exist within primordial purity—impure can return to purity through recognition.

The question "between which does it exist?" points to the key insight: bardo is not a place but a mode of appearance—same appearances can be recognized as wisdom (dharmatā) or experienced as confusion (samsara).
