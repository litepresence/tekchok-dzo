Introduction to Two Truths Framework
**Analysis:** Longchenpa initiates the discussion of the two truths (bden pa gnyis) as the framework for understanding the paths of the vehicles (*theg pa*). The structure follows the standard threefold presentation:

1. **Ground** (*gzh*): Knowing the nature of the two truths [2833]
2. **Path** (*lam*): How to practice having understood [2834]
3. **Result** ('*bras bu*): The final fruition of complete path [2835]

This structure reflects the *gzh-lam-'bras* topology common in Tibetan Buddhist literature, particularly in *sngags* (tantric) presentations.

Two Truths: Conventional and Ultimate
**Key Terms:**

**Kun rdzob bden pa** (conventional truth):
- *Kun*: all, entirely
- *Rdzob*: cover, conceal, veil
- Literally "all-veiling truth"—that which covers the ultimate truth

**Dam pa'i don gyi bden pa** (ultimate truth):
- *Dam pa*: sublime, supreme
- *Don*: meaning, object
- Literally "truth of the sublime meaning"

**Analysis of [2833-2833]:**
The citation from Nāgārjuna's *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* establishes scriptural authority:

*Sangs rgyas rnams kyis chos bstan pa dang / bden pa gnyis la yang dag brten / 'jig rten kun rdzob bden pa dang / dam pa'i don gyi bden pa'o*

Grammatical structure:
- **la brten**: dependent upon (locative + verb)
- **yang dag**: correctly, properly
- The verse indicates that all Buddha's teachings rely (*brten*) on the two truths

**Doctrinal Context:**
This verse (MMK 24:8-9) is the locus classicus for the two truths doctrine in Madhyamaka. Nāgārjuna argues that without the conventional, the ultimate cannot be taught; without the ultimate, nirvāṇa cannot be attained.

Conventional Truth and Its Divisions
**Analysis:** Longchenpa presents the classical definition of conventional truth (*kun rdzob bden pa*) as phenomena appearing as signs within the sphere of mind (*blo'i yul du snang rung*). This epistemological definition emphasizes that conventional truth is mind-dependent rather than objectively existent. The crucial distinction between false conventional (*log pa'i kun rdzob*)—mistaken appearances that perpetuate suffering—and true conventional (*yang dag kun rdzob*)—virtuous actions that lead toward liberation—establishes the functional framework for Buddhist practice within the conventional realm.

The definition of conventional truth at [2835]: *chos can mtshan mar snang ba blo'i yul du snang rung rnams ni kun rdzobs kyi bden pa*—"all phenomena appearing as signs within the sphere of mind are conventional truth."

**Key Distinction:**
The text divides conventional truth into:
1. **Log pa'i kun rdzob** (false conventional): Mistaken appearances
2. **Yang dag kun rdzob** (true conventional): Correct but conventional

This division originates with Candrakīrti's *Madhyamakāvatāra* and is standard in Tibetan *grub mtha'* literature.

**Epistemological Point:**
The definition emphasizes *blo'i yul* (mind's object/scope)—conventional truth is that which can appear to mind. This is crucial: conventional truth is not "false" in a simple sense, but is mind-dependent (*blo btags*).

True and False Conventional in Detail
**Analysis:** Longchenpa elaborates the distinction between false and true conventional through the eight similes of illusion (*sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad*). False conventional comprises all phenomena of the container world (*snod*) and contained beings (*bcud*) fabricated by mind—appearing clearly while non-existent, functionally efficacious yet empty of inherent nature when examined. True conventional includes the ten virtues, generosity, merit accumulation, and meditative concentrations that, while still conventional and appearing as confusion, serve as causes for higher realms and liberation. This functional distinction allows Buddhist practice to operate meaningfully within the conventional while pointing toward the ultimate.

**False Conventional** [2833-2833]:
*Snang srid snod bcud blos bkod pa'i chos so cog dang bcas pa thams cad log pa'i kun rdzob*—"All phenomena included in the container and contained, fabricated by mind, are false conventional."

The four characteristics (*sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad*):
1. *Med pa gsal snang* — appearing clearly while non-existent
2. *Don byed nus pa* — capable of functional efficacy
3. *Brtags na ngo bo nyid kyis dben pa* — empty of inherent nature when examined
4. *Sgyu ma'i dpe brgyad* — illustrated by eight similes of illusion

**True Conventional** [2833-2833]:
*'Khrul par snang yang bde 'gro dang thar pa'i rgyu byed pa*—"Appearing as confusion yet causing higher realms and liberation."

This includes:
- Ten virtues (*dge ba bcu*)
- Perfection of generosity (*sbyin pa*)
- Accumulation of merit (*bsod nams*)
- Path-exertion samādhi (*ting 'dzin*)

The distinction is functional: false conventional leads to suffering, true conventional leads to liberation—both are ultimately empty.

**Dharmakīrti's Influence:**
The definition reflects Dharmakīrti's epistemology: *don byed nus pa* (able to perform functions) is the mark of the real conventionally.

[2833-2833] <concept>
Ultimate Truth: Definition and Divisions
**Analysis:** Ultimate truth (*dam pa'i don gyi bden pa*) is defined as dharmatā—the naturally abiding nature of phenomena, the essence of emptiness (*stong pa nyid*). Longchenpa presents the crucial Madhyamaka distinction between nominal ultimate (*rnam grangs pa*) and non-nominal ultimate (*rnam grangs pa ma yin pa*). The former serves as a pedagogical pointer, indicated by words and concepts; the latter represents actual realization that transcends all indication. This distinction preserves the apophatic nature of ultimate truth while allowing for its conventional expression, following Nāgārjuna's teaching that the two truths are not two realities but two perspectives on one reality.

**Definition** [2835]:
*Chos nyid rang bzhin du gnas pa stong pa nyid kyi ngo bo*—"Dharmatā naturally abiding, the essence of emptiness."

Key terms:
- *Chos nyid*: dharmatā—the nature of phenomena
- *Rang bzhin*: inherent nature, but here meaning "natural state"
- *Stong pa nyid*: emptiness (śūnyatā)

**Two-fold Division** [2833-2833]:
1. **Rnam grangs pa**: Nominal ultimate—meaning indicated by words/signs
2. **Rnam grangs pa ma yin pa**: Non-nominal ultimate—actual reality

This distinction is crucial in Madhyamaka: the nominal ultimate is a pedagogical tool; the non-nominal is the actual realization that transcends all indication.

**Philosophical Significance:**
The two truths are not two realities but two perspectives on one reality. As Nāgārjuna says: "There is not the slightest difference between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. There is not the slightest difference between nirvāṇa and saṃsāra." (MMK 25:19-20)
