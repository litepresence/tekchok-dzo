[26255] great-perfection momentary quick do measure mind life-to enter
[26256] Very elaboration all near cease-from not-exist-from power
[26257] This also example faith-to meaning connection cut
[26258] That also body ground is element four bind free do cause arise-from
[26259] Now element self continuum-to return not possible vital
[26260] Speech four is express ground
[26261] Express condition
[26262] Express object
[26263] Express agent four bind-from free-from
[26264] Now express word self continuum-to speak not possible
[26265] Mind four
[26266] Memory
[26267] Memory not
[26268] Arise not
[26269] Mind exceed four bind-from free
[26270] Now memory think object wheel-to enter not possible
[26271] Thus sign body-to dawn
[26272] Essence speech-to know
[26273] Confidence mind-to correct
[26274] Measure dream-by catch

[26279] Latency good bad conceptuality not-exist
[26280] Low dream good-to become is latency pure taste one-from abandon antidote cause effect action-to avoid need
[26281] Thus abide three
[26282] Mu tig phreng from
[26283] Pure expanse is abide and
[26284] Thus awareness essence abide
[26285] Vision all abide
[26286] Thus
[26287] Third obtain three nail strike
[26288] Outer vision-to power obtain-from vision condition field realm-to free
[26289] Inner illusion body-to power obtain-from dust together luminosity-to free
[26290] Secret awareness-to power obtain-from wind mind delusion exhaust
[26291] Meaning result-to power obtain-to near by-say
[26292] Again that itself from
[26293] Awareness dawn-from cause condition cease
[26294] Luminosity dawn-from subtle coarse cease
[26295] Expanse awareness dawn-from object mind cease
[26296] Thus
[26297] Fourth confidence four free measure hold
[26298] Hell hot cold suffering see or hear although fear dread not confidence and
[26299] Buddha quality hear although obtain hope and excitement not self place body three complete confidence and
[26300] Action affliction cause result hear although delusion vision samsara fall fear not-from cause result repeat confidence and
[26301] Nirvana self place see although free hope joy not-from primordially-pure self complete certain ground obtain confidence and four arise
[26302] Rinpoche spungs pa tantra from
[26303] Not change view confidence great four-by
[26304] Not return wisdom measure also hold
[26305] Thus
[26306] Thus extreme rely four addition-to
[26307] Vision sixteen-by conclusion gather
[26308] Vision and
[26309] Increase and
[26310] Obtain and
[26311] Near obtain four set each vision four-to enter-from
[26312] Ground sixteen vision complete
