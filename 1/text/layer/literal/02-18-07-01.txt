[25180] Thus said and
[25181] From Collection
[25182] Meaning that what sky-only gaze make
[25183] Thus said and
[25184] From Middle Mother
[25185] Transcendent discriminating-awareness perfection meditation
[25186] Sky yogin making said etcetera scripture immeasurable
[25187] That-also field outer-inner mixed equal limitless view called
[25188] Dhatu-awareness non-dual view called
[25189] Dhatu-awareness mixed samsara-nirvana taste equal view called
[25190] This same Instruction-Child from also
[25191] Dhatu and awareness gaze manner
[25192] Obscuration-doer separate sky-like
[25193] Thus spoken
[25194] Third wind-awareness main-point
[25195] Field and gate two meet time wind slow rely awareness capture called
[25196] That-also wind somehow slow outer far shoot outer hold place main-point
[25197] That also wind and slow cause
[25198] Outer yogin life extend helper become
[25199] Inner conceptuality cease cause make and
[25200] Secret awareness direct seeing action do
[25201] Actual contaminated not-seeing buddha make cause
[25202] That thus also from Thalgyur
[25203] Wind what slow make
[25204] Fully project from arising cause
[25205] Body and mind connection cut that
[25206] Three-realms in also reverse not
[25207] Thus said and
[25208] Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplish
[25209] Fully project from arising cause
[25210] Body and mind connection cut that
[25211] Three-realms in also reverse not
[25212] Thus said and
[25213] Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplish
[25214] Thus it is said
[25215] Awareness main-point hanging-cord dhatu fence place not-move make
[25216] That same from
[25217] Self-face awareness hanging-cord
[25218] Going-coming separate sky capture
[25219] Thus said and
[25220] From Instruction-Child
[25221] Dhatu inside hanging-cord
[25222] Place arrange separate not-do
[25223] Thus it is said
[25224] That-also wind slow rely action separate meaning mind-in arise
[25225] Awareness hanging-cord forehead gaze cause conceptuality source exhaust-from
[25226] Delusion base return wisdom mother-son meet
[25227] Awareness wind separate-from going-coming not-existing awareness self-arisen enter
[25228] That also guide cause body main-point rely days five-six do
[25229] Then gate practice that much only do
[25230] Then field seek days six seven make
[25231] Then direct self-point deliver experience take
[25232] That very purified meditation knowing arise
[25233] Other wrong not-wrong cause vision flickering see
[25234] Faith not-existing guide finish time what say not-thing divination various arise near therefore thus not-gone pure make
[25235] That general guide great-this apply time preliminary measure arrive diligence with purify cause actual main faith ordinary not-existing arise
[25236] Actual main point-deliver hit direct delight special arise
[25237] Subsequent support dharma end cut explain cause experience practice maintain capable know-from doubt and conceptuality end dharma other mind not-desire purpose existing
[25238] Second direct awareness self-face introduce
[25239] Awareness vajra hanging-cord golden thread sky hovering like dhatu luminous-clear vision with this not-deluded buddha pure spontaneous-completion self-resonance
[25240] State look cause concept-doer all pure elaboration-free sky-like resonance within dawn cause
[25241] Dhatu-awareness non-dual intent transcendent discriminating-awareness arising wisdom meet-face
[25242] First Samantabhadra capacity equal
[25243] This habituation measure arrive stone-with light liberating
[25244] Not-arrive also bardo or nature emanation field traverse
[25245] Six-realms delusion precipice cut
[25246] Thus introduce and
[25247] From Self-Arising Instruction
[25248] Thus who see person
[25249] First Samantabhadra and
[25250] Capacity itself equal
[25251] Thus said and
[25252] From Thalgyur
[25253] Hanging-cord nature
[25254] Conceptuality all pure cause
[25255] Not-deluded base buddha
[25256] Thus it is said
[25257] Third that-from vision dawning manner show
[25258] Dhatu light five self-resonance luster dawning and
[25259] Hanging-cord point tiny bind and
[25260] First white pure star scatter like from
[25261] Point color five possess and
[25262] Each-one and
[25263] Three-bind interval vision until that
[25264] Previous from
[25265] Then point see
[25266] Thus it is said
[25267] That-also outer luminous-clear look cause inner conceptuality separate equal limitless liberate
[25268] Pure self-arisen awareness-resonance and
[25269] Spontaneous-completion light-resonance two outer-inner pair connect cause
[25270] Dhatu-awareness gathering-separate not-existing intent called
[25271] Third vision four dawning sequence two
[25272] Essence briefly show and
[25273] Nature extensively explain
[25274] First
[25275] Vision four all time body posture abide
[25276] Eye gaze manner gaze
[25277] Wind-awareness mode slow three main-point harmonize
[25278] Particularly vision first two purify later two effort rely mode purify
[25279] Luminous-clear liberate therefore dhatu-awareness non-dual called
[25280] These main-point awareness vajra hanging-cord separate not-do main-point arise
[25281] That meaning explain
[25282] Awareness essence nature compassion three not-differentiable base-abide and that resonance light channel pure vision from golden thread like coil curve interval point bind
[25283] Vajra buddhas sentient-beings all essence good-bad not-existing equal unchanging abide part place
[25284] Lu example water channel good from water increase decrease not-existing emerge similar
[25285] Body and wisdom increase opening various path-vision complete until that from dawning cause
[25286] Gu that inside dharmata not-mistaken view and meditation pull cause
[25287] Continuity samsara-nirvana pervade vision those collections from
[25288] Body and
[25289] Point radiate and
[25290] Arise and
[25291] Gather etcetera clear cause
[25292] From Thalgyur
[25293] Wind-awareness slow wisdom accomplish
[25294] That-from vision four become
[25295] Dharmata direct vision cause
[25296] Intellect grasp view suppress
[25297] Experience-vision above increase cause
[25298] Delusion vision cease cause
[25299] Awareness measure arrive vision cause
[25300] Three-bodies realize path-vision transcend
[25301] Dharmata exhaust vision cause
[25302] Three-realms samsara stream cut
[25303] Thus it is said
[25304] That-also vision four number determine outer sun-moon time four increase decrease and
[25305] Inner body speech mind four binding-from liberate and
[25306] Secret empowerment four determination show and
[25307] Actual lamp four vision determine rely four determine
[25308] Sequence determine
[25309] First base dharmata direct not-see remaining three dawning base not-existing ground and supported base first dharmata direct vision dawning
[25310] That same dawn cause dharmas all meaning see self-arisen wisdom self-from find called
[25311] Then direct that experience not-experience word only fruit not-arise cause
[25312] Meaning experience cause that experience above increase arise
[25313] Thus experience arisen measure firm make need
[25314] Not-firm experience end not-existing dharmas possess not-existing and
[25315] Buddha expand cause not-arise cause
[25316] Experience firm measure arrive cause
[25317] Awareness measure arrive vision arise
[25318] Awareness vision measure arrive though that-from other not-change three-bodies fruit desire difference not-existing
[25319] Actual vision mark dharmas fruit meaning hope ordinary and difference not-existing cause
[25320] Vision experience base dissolve
[25321] Subtle coarse vision holding cease-from
[25322] Pure dharmata exhaust experience dharmata exhaust vision arise
[25323] Those also first two nirmanakaya
[25324] Measure arrive sambhogakaya
[25325] Exhaust dharmakaya vision path make three-bodies path-vision dawn fruit dharmata exhaust pure dhatu arrive cause
[25326] Self-vision potency three-bodies awareness mode dissolve cause
[25327] Awareness pure fruit
[25328] Awareness dhatu-from originally self-potency three-bodies dawn fruit function called
[25329] Vehicle other name also not-hear essence
[25330] Vehicle king intent called
[25331] Main-point this realize difficult one
[25332] Second individual nature extensively explain four
[25333] Dharmata direct
[25334] Experience above increase
[25335] Awareness measure arrive
[25336] Dharmata exhaust vision extensively explain
[25337] First two
[25338] Direct general connection place and
[25339] Self characteristic identify
[25340] First general direct conventional term famous direct and
[25341] Ultimate dhatu meet direct two from
