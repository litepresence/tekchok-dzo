[26840] First cause exist need-from
[26841] Cause exist conditioned not permanent-from again destroy-from action-to good bad not suitable and
[26842] Return-place not-exist then being aggregate number-not-exist these come suitable not and
[26843] Mind that various is then realm-to self other thought suddenly come suitable not and
[26844] Mutual intermix from
[26845] Self conquer and
[26846] Not die and
[26847] Suffering not-exist and
[26848] Retinue and enjoyment etc. possess happy and
[26849] Other defeat etc. all perceive agree come suitable not and
[26850] If different is then
[26851] Realm many exist-from
[26852] Some-to other with agree self defeat happy etc. come suitable and
[26853] One only think is then what one die-from all die or
[26854] One born-from all born suitable or
[26855] Thus aspect many door-from self mind-to one and different controversy-from examine search-from
[26856] Any also not-find is dharma-nature primordially-pure meaning wisdom power-by realize
[26857] Mind-to cause not-exist return not possible-from action accumulate-to end not-exist faith and
[26858] Mind-to cause exist result come need
[26859] Result samsara is then not pure-from liberate not possible
[26860] Transcended is then samsara come suitable not
[26861] Both is then
[26862] Samsara nirvana different like mind also different become and
[26863] If different then
[26864] Body mind different like memory thought family one-to gather desire also different many become-from
[26865] Family one-to gather-from know
[26866] Also mind-to cause not-exist then mind these suitable not by-say
[26867] These mind cause-from arise not-exist intelligence not is-from
[26868] Mind-from arise not is then mind this itself-to dwell only-to not realize not-exist
[26869] These birth and
[26870] Death and
[26871] Abide etc. exhaust also not is and
[26872] Increase also not is-from
[26873] Scripture-from
[26874] Ignorance illusion-wheel this-to exhaust-not-exist increase not-exist
[26875] By-say and
[26876] Also
[26877] Being realm nature that also end not-exist
[26878] By-say said-from
[26879] Thus cause not-exist-from mind-to increase not-exist realize
[26880] Increase not-exist-from birth not-exist realize
[26881] Birth not-exist-from death not-exist realize
[26882] That know-from action-to also bad not-exist realize
[26883] Condensed-from
[26884] Exist not-exist this two not-exist dharma
[26885] By-say
[26886] Thus primordially from-beginning self empty not-exist know-from
[26887] From-beginning pure-from being birth suitable how become
[26888] By-say arise
[26889] That also mind-to condition not-exist
[26890] Exist then appearance various-to appear like mind also condition-by color etc. various become and
[26891] Mind different-to go-from memory thought one-to not suitable and
[26892] Mind-to condition exist then certainly destroy become-from
[26893] Mind action-result not-exist conclude and
[26894] Mind cease also that action exist then
[26895] Very contradict
[26896] Body color and sense-base good bad all body cease also dwell by-say equal
[26897] Thus illusion like dwell only-by clear
[26898] Condition not-exist then now memory thought various this what-from arise by-say
[26899] Now memory thought this condition-from arise not-exist
[26900] Sudden yesterday dream jewel find-from happy and true hold-from
[26901] Wake then what also not-exist like
[26902] Now memory thought also true hold-from attach although that after-to what also not-exist-from circumstance true-false like appear-from establish not-exist
[26903] Example sky cloud various sudden gather that where go trace not-exist sudden dissolve like equal
[26904] Cloud that sky-to not-exist although that nature-in appear like
[26905] Condition and cause mind-to not-exist although appear appear like time cause condition not-exist one and many and time three examine-from not-exist certain
[26906] Root wisdom-from
[26907] Seed cease and not-cease-from
[26908] Sprout birth not-exist
[26909] You-by dharma all
[26910] Illusion arise like show
[26911] By-say and
[26912] Condition five is exist not-exist
[26913] By-say-from
[26914] All-doing-from also
[26915] Cause and condition not-exist peace supreme path
[26916] By-say etc. explained
[26917] That-from mind exist then
[26918] Entity form-possess-to exist or
[26919] Form not-exist-to exist
[26920] Form-possess-to not-exist exist then power direct-perception-to see suitable-from see suitable not observe direct-perception valid-cognition-by clear
[26921] Form not-exist-to exist then how know
[26922] Movement know by-say
[26923] Movement that need and direction part and
[26924] Past future present three meet examine-from not establish
[26925] Movement before and now movement meet then meet part memory-thought before that now not cease exist need and
[26926] Exist then before is contradict and
[26927] Now before and part that cease conclude and not meet then now memory-thought cause not-exist movement suitable not conclude-from stop
[26928] Movement one is or different
[26929] One then various-to movement lose and
[26930] Different then move-make one is-from lose
[26931] Thus mind exist-to not establish
[26932] Root separate sky like realize-from
[26933] Birth and birth-ground not-exist-from return place not-exist
[26934] Place not-exist then memory-thought before after interval-to face-introduce-from there dissolve-from mind-to ground not-exist recognize
[26935] That know-from return place not-exist faith
[26936] That know-from realm three name not-exist great-to decide
[26937] That dharma-from action virtue vice benefit harm not-exist mind happy
[26938] Also appearance know before after interval-to face-introduce-from
[26939] Mind-to cause and characteristic-to not establish recognize
[26940] That know-from mind itself empty-to identify grasp not-exist faith
[26941] That believe-from mind by-say cause condition-from not arise decide
[26942] That dharma-from memory-thought sudden thought-by benefit harm not-exist mind happy
[26943] Also mind happy
[26944] Also mind before after interval-to face-introduce-from
[26945] Mind-to root not-exist recognize
[26946] That know-from mind itself one wheel-to elaboration different not-exist faith
[26947] That believe-from made dharma-by buddha not become decide
[26948] That cut-from mind not-exist meaning-from not realize side not-exist-from mind happy
[26949] Also dharma-nature before after interval-to face-introduce-from
[26950] Mind-to birth not-exist recognize
[26951] That know-from propensity body kunzhi-by not harm faith
[26952] That believe-from now mind birth not possible decide
[26953] That dharma-from now mind house cease and return place and return-support not-exist mind happy
[26954] Thus mind search time four measure grasp-from
[26955] Buddha not-exist-from buddha name only-to also not-exist
[26956] Result-to hope hold mind turn
[26957] That turn-from path effort exertion-to make dharma not-exist
[26958] Thus not-exist dharma-to what also not-exist-from samsara nirvana-to designate name only-from meaning-to not find-to liberate measure by-say
[26959] That-from mind itself not-exist-to what also not-exist-from
[26960] Mind-to cause reason not-exist-from see not-exist and
[26961] Thus not-exist face-introduce four turn and
[26962] Dharma-possessor sixteen-to realize
[26963] Mind house destroy
[26964] Example child house build destroy like
[26965] That also action-by action destroy iron-by iron destroy like and
[26966] Not permanent-by not permanent destroy illusion person-by illusion city destroy like and
[26967] Made-by not permanent destroy corpse-on corpse stack like and
[26968] Not permanent-by made destroy wisdom now-by ignorance before destroy like
[26969] Thus mind-by mind destroy-from both track not-exist-to dissolve water-on letter write like and
[26970] Not-exist-by not-exist search also not find poor house-in wish-fulfilling jewel not-exist search-also find place not-exist like equal
[26971] Mind not-exist-to destroy place not-exist
[26972] Example dissolve time water-to hold place not-exist like
[26973] That-from mind not-exist meaning not know-from
[26974] View meditation conduct mind-to search
[26975] Bliss great liberation doctrine find time not-exist
[26976] Boat sink-from water-to enter like
[26977] Mind not-exist-to exist-to support that itself-by deceive and bind by-say
[26978] Samantabhadra heart mirror-from also
[26979] Appearance dharma-body-to desire me-to obstruction
[26980] Whatever-appear mind-to desire me-to obstruction
[26981] Self-arise other desire me-to obstruction
[26982] By-say
[26983] Then mind dissolve by-say exist that not-exist-to gone not by-say
[26984] Dissolve before like examine-from not establish and
[26985] Not examine then-also sudden memory-thought thought dissolve-from
[26986] Mind self-continuum exist-from not-exist-to gone not-exist
[26987] Dissolve cause and dissolve condition where-to also not-exist
[26988] Then mind house destroy-to need not-exist destroy cause not-exist-from
[26989] Mind primordially not-exist-to
[26990] Not-exist nature realize-to make only-from
[26991] Mind house ground-or entity exist is not-exist
[26992] Memory source dharma-nature-to gone-from
[26993] Not-exist understand-to make-to
[26994] House destroy by-say term-to make
[26995] Exist destroy what also not-exist
[26996] That-from term result by-say appearance object vital-point whatever-appear nature-on place-from
[26997] Inert appearance that-to grasp not-exist-from object mind two not-exist result and
[26998] Know whatever-move nature-on place-from
[26999] Mind house self-destroy-from movement thought-liberate result and
[27000] Thus inert know two not-exist union primordial wisdom dissolve place identify-from not-exist result
[27001] Thus result three time also dissolve time face-introduce vital-point four-to
