[25698] ground-vision self-resonance spontaneously-accomplish dawn-door body-form-vision-through
[25699] Path-vision exhaust near-from
[25700] Mandala complete those
[25701] Measure is first half-body from body mandala complete until
[25702] Arrive is that-from exceed place not-exist form-vision
[25703] Those moon full form like
[25704] Waxing increase cease-from mandala complete self-essence fabricate-not-exist
[25705] Second measure three particular explain to three
[25706] Outer vision
[25707] Inner body measure
[25708] Secret awareness measure
[25709] First
[25710] Vision control lands light-clear complete
[25711] Thal 'gyur from
[25712] Thus arrive-from complete measure
[25713] Direct entity-vision cease and
[25714] Earth stone vision melt and
[25715] Self-know whatever enter and
[25716] That enter inert move and
[25717] Wind move measure grasp and
[25718] Body dust-particle see arise
[25719] Whatever appear form-body complete and
[25720] That-from father-mother embrace and
[25721] Five five father and mother unite and
[25722] All periphery round to
[25723] Yogin body also light-clear
[25724] Go and come and sit vision
[25725] All awareness measure-arrive
[25726] Thus
[25727] Second
[25728] Body dust purify-from heart center-to white A from light-ray five coil heart-window sun-reflection like intermediate-space light star-window inside dawn pierce
[25729] Crown-uspa-from wisdom wind abide nature-by lift vision
[25730] Urna-from light-ray five fathom one light clear
[25731] Hand finger five-to light five garland coil
[25732] Body hair-door etc. outer-inner part dust-particle scope-from small each land realms number-not-exist Buddha and beings measure-not-exist vision is spontaneously-accomplish door eight dawn vision all here exceed lack not self-vision-to vision
[25733] Crown-palate wrathful mandala and heart-in peaceful mandala and
[25734] Body part all-to nature emanation and
[25735] Train-beings emanation and
[25736] Various emanation vision-through Buddha field-in self-vision beings benefit do vision
[25737] Compassion door-from clairvoyance six sets and
[25738] Dharma all know wisdom dawn
[25739] Pure wisdom door-from Buddha field pure self-vision Sambhogakaya complete and
[25740] Mind defilement pure and dust doubt separation itself obtain-from
[25741] Ground and ground latencies self-pure Thal 'gyur from
[25742] Measure-arrive body also thus become
[25743] Individual body dust free-from
[25744] Intermediate-space light star-window vision
[25745] Then light-ray hook shape
[25746] Subtle and coil-through vision hold
[25747] Body dust self-cease-from
[25748] Transparent stainless light body
[25749] Center-in A mark and
[25750] Urna light-ray fathom one measure
[25751] Crown-uspa wind-by lift vision
[25752] Peaceful-body hand finger from
[25753] Light garland form coil
[25754] Sound-not mind activity
[25755] Head skull palace from
[25756] Heruka manifest arise
[25757] This time self-body measure-to arrive
[25758] Transparent body three one coil
[25759] Thus
[25760] Third secret awareness measure
[25761] Subtle coarse move mind pure although
[25762] All-ground consciousness only mind exist
[25763] Awareness quality clairvoyance and eye-attachment not-exist dawn
[25764] That itself from
[25765] This time mind clear and
[25766] Clairvoyance six and
[25767] Far and concealed become
[25768] Dharmas moment-by know become
[25769] Measure-not Buddha realms and
[25770] Thus body also mind-to vision
[25771] Empty mind-to defilement exhaust
[25772] Nature not-move empty-clear obtain
[25773] Unmixed equal-complete expanse-to pervade
[25774] Manifest clear-through many separate-not
[25775] Part not-exist elaboration-not
[25776] Thus
[25777] That-also vision above two-to affliction-mind and mind-consciousness defilement manifest become purify-from
[25778] This obtain time collections eight first seven pure-from
[25779] Subtle coarse defilement-from free
[25780] Body mind connection cut-from
[25781] Outer vision object awareness-to vision
[25782] Investigate agent consciousness part kunzhi consciousness power-by self-condition do
[25783] Star-arrow sky-to move measure-like momentary investigate agent self-dawn that self-free antidote separate-to not-look pure
[25784] Vision above two time-at wind outward throw and inward not hold-from
[25785] Conceptuality moment two-in not abide ability purify cause arise
[25786] Body transparent
[25787] Consciousness kunzhi part concept-not object awareness fire-spark emit like clear-vivid
[25788] Outer extending vision and inner self-vision vision aspect two see-through body mind separate cut
[25789] Realms three-to outward not return ground supreme mandala great accomplish
[25790] Again Thal 'gyur from
[25791] Thus vision time all-to
[25792] Body mind connect cut
[25793] Contaminated exhaust body-from also
[25794] Outward arise characteristic clear mind
[25795] Star-arrow emit manner-by also
[25796] Sky realm-to clear see
[25797] That itself first time all-to
[25798] Wind and separate pure-from also
[25799] Effort and pure wind action
[25800] Body-from outward throw cause arise
[25801] See agent two part-from also
[25802] Body light-clear pure-to
[25803] Mind fire-spark emit like
[25804] One-to not abide self-clear ground
[25805] Vision aspect two manner-from arise
[25806] This-by body mind connect cut-from
[25807] Realms three return not
[25808] Thus
[25809] This time-at see agent also kunzhi consciousness part star-arrow or fire-spark emit like and
[25810] Awareness compassion wisdom part two exist-from
[25811] See object outer inner two see wisdom part-to arise
[25812] This time-at antidote intentionally gaze manner set etc. not
[25813] Always dharmata wheel-from not pass-from
[25814] Practice measure complete by-say
[25815] Fourth dharmata exhaust vision-to two
[25816] Exhaust manner brief show and
[25817] Nature extensive explain
[25818] First
[25819] Before measure-arrive moon full like vision-from
[25820] Self-resonance expanse-to dissolve manner
[25821] That-from moon waning like
[25822] Again body that fade-from bindu-to reach etc. first mind-to certain vision
[25823] That container contents arise abide destroy empty four sequence-through vision four purify manner-to meaning sequence apply
[25824] Birth aging sickness death four increase decrease and also similar
[25825] Outer container arise manner dissolve and
[25826] Inner contents beings life measure up arise and
[25827] Down wane exhaust sign
[25828] Those not exhaust self realms three-from not free
[25829] Thus outer container world exhaust-from
[25830] Support ground not-exist-from
[25831] Return ground not-exist vital point
[25832] Inner contents beings exhaust-from birth continuum cut-from
[25833] Now awareness itself death and separate
[25834] Then vision what essence-as also establish not
[25835] This is this is-not-by express difficult-from
[25836] Dharmata exhaust by-say meaning result
[25837] Result is person-by this is this is-not express difficult thought-by not-conceive cause
[25838] That-also dharma exhaust is measure-arrive time outer object inner body dharma dust together is exhaust-from here kunzhi consciousness dharma mind-by include those exhaust-from
[25839] All-ground part door three dharmata abide root non-awareness that exhaust purify and
[25840] Delusion dharma-to depend-upon
[25841] Vision luminosity arise destroy not-exist that dharmata ultimate abide-from
[25842] Dharmata two that exhaust come-from dharmata exhaust by-say
[25843] Vision is that before spontaneously-accomplish vision exist inner dissolve-to part part-from go time
[25844] Primordially-pure vision cloud not-exist sky like manner pure momentary abide-from vision by-say
[25845] Entity and characteristic-as vision like not
[25846] This time-at dharma merely-to also reference not-exist-from dharmata exhaust

[25850] Exhaust manner
[25851] Gradual and
[25852] Instantaneous two-from
[25853] Gradual exhaust is vision four measure arrive time
[25854] Instantaneous exhaust is first dharmata manifest see-from habituation do-from
[25855] Experience increase etc. vision not arise-from exhaust also exist
[25856] This mind supreme instantaneous by-say
[25857] That-also before purify action potential guru-to respect other-from great each merely exhaust manner exist merely
[25858] Second nature extensive explain to
[25859] Essence
[25860] Definition
[25861] Nature
[25862] Dharmata
[25863] Boundary and five-from
[25864] Dharmata exhaust essence
[25865] Outer light five vision body together exhaust
[25866] Inner dust together concept aggregate together exhaust
[25867] Experience vision object exhaust
[25868] Primordially-pure vision sky like manner-to awareness abide
[25869] Thal 'gyur from
[25870] Dharmata exhaust vision
[25871] Experience vision empty-from
[25872] Body exhaust sense object also exhaust
[25873] Concept aggregate delusion-from free-from
[25874] Express ground word and separate
[25875] Thus
[25876] Definition
[25877] Dharma by-saying body speech mind aggregate dharma affliction together
[25878] Itself purify agent path vision luminosity meditate part together
[25879] Exhaust is empty
[25880] Mind meditation object vision together self-reverse-from not-exist
[25881] Not observe by-say
[25882] That itself from
[25883] Thus dharmata certain definition
[25884] Dharma know aggregate gather-to
[25885] Action do and characteristic hold
[25886] Self-vision empty do-to
[25887] Individual families hold
[25888] Itself fabricate not-exist-to
[25889] Natural abide-through real pervade
[25890] Unfabricated original continuous-to
[25891] Sound word name number exhaust
[25892] Thus
[25893] Nature
[25894] Outer inner vision mind exhaust sky blue-grey resonance like primordially-pure self-resonance merely-to activity
[25895] Rtsal rdzogs from
[25896] This time exhaust characteristic
[25897] Action-free sky like thus
[25898] Thus
[25899] Dharmata-to two-from
[25900] Vision dharmata
[25901] Outer inner dust together exhaust-from channel wind exhaust
[25902] That exhaust-from mind-to depend latency all-from arise characteristic defilement subtle seed part those also exhaust
[25903] Continuity samadhi-to abide-through dharmata wheel-from not pass
[25904] Eye and clairvoyance great control-through realms three dharma king regent-to power obtain
[25905] All-ground subtle knowable obscuration very cut white silk curtain merely-by cut except obscuration not-exist-from
[25906] Path dharma exhaust result by-say
[25907] That clear-from Buddha obscuration all separate-from inner expanse primordially-pure dharmakaya-to enter very peace
[25908] Thal 'gyur from
[25909] Self-Buddha cease dharmata
[25910] Element cease-from dust cease
[25911] Dust and particle end cease-from
[25912] Part merely also abide not
[25913] Affliction cease-from delusion and
[25914] Concept-free attachment not abide-from
[25915] Latency and all-from arise
[25916] Dust part merely also not abide
[25917] Thus subtle coarse cease-from
[25918] Aggregate five also end gradual subtle
[25919] Element four body exhaust-from
[25920] All wisdom Sambhogakaya
[25921] Concept-free samadhi self-abide
[25922] Fabricate aggregate-from exceed-from
[25923] Dharma by-say word-to not abide
[25924] Thus
[25925] Empty dharmata
[25926] Channel wind coarse exhaust-from mind mental-events exhaust
[25927] Body and wisdom vision aspect measure-arrive moon full like-also inner expanse-to set-from primordially-pure vision-to abide-from
[25928] Dharmakaya vision core result dharmata self-vision by-say express
[25929] Again before from
[25930] Cause and result dharmata
[25931] Conceptuality coarse source cease-from
[25932] Memory self-pure continuum-from also
[25933] Dependent-arising wind itself fully-pure
[25934] Cause-from arise dharmata

[25937] Body and wisdom not-exist and
[25938] Dharmas exhaust ground arrive
[25939] Result dharmata is think
[25940] Thus
[25941] That-also word later this three-to delusion-from
[25942] Result primordially-pure-to body and wisdom not-exist think Nyingtigpa arise-from
[25943] That error great
[25944] Outer vision resonance body and wisdom crystal light inward return like part-to thus say that intention not understand merely
[25945] Meaning-to inner expanse-to not-exist spontaneous-accomplishment contradict and
[25946] Unconditioned is-from future not-exist completely perish-to go contradict and
[25947] Again expanse-from body and wisdom dawn ground-from beings benefit arise contradict and
[25948] Samantabhadra ground expanse pure end arrive-from beings and Buddha-to path show compassion and action show contradict etc. fault many exist-from
[25949] Fault such accept suitable not
[25950] Fifth boundary
[25951] Measure-arrive curtain-from exhaust begin time self hand foot four finger light five clear merely exist-from
[25952] Occasion this-from inner expanse-to outward enter and

[25954] That-also body form that now beings benefit actual extensive not arise
[25955] Finger light-to awareness focus-from
[25956] Outer vision and
[25957] Self body light-clear all inner expanse-to increasingly dissolve-to go
[25958] Direct entity-vision blue pure merely-from
[25959] Light body-to fade crystal light inward dissolve like
[25960] Body and vision self-resonance also reverse
[25961] Inner clear spontaneously-accomplish jewel shell-in body and wisdom depth resonance merely-to awareness abide
[25962] Outer vision blue-in vision part merely also not-exist crystal mirror self-lucid-to shadow like abide
[25963] Awareness dharmakaya-to Buddha coiled
[25964] Outer vision-to inward return body that Buddha action equal not accomplish sign
[25965] That-also birth and enter control-from awareness beings-to compassion focus-from whatever not-exist primordially-pure vision that self-reverse-from
[25966] Delusion vision vision this mirror reflection like vision
[25967] Self body that also water moon like wisdom illusion body-to self-vision transparent-from element harm separate vajra body obtain
[25968] Beings benefit-to transfer great body arise by-say
[25969] Other eye not-pure-from dust together merely-from transparent-to not see
[25970] Master great Vimala and
[25971] Padma like
[25972] Then birth and enter two control obtain-from
[25973] Momentary Buddha although delay exist
[25974] Beings benefit samsara not empty until do although self-power possess
[25975] Birth control
[25976] Inner expanse-to enter occasion beings three-thousand-to awareness enter all time one-to free power great obtain
[25977] Insects also light-to cease
[25978] Birth control obtain-from whatever desire emanate-from beings benefit spontaneously-accomplish do
[25979] Enter control
[25980] Inert-to awareness enter although move and sound make do
[25981] Lotus and wishing tree and jewel etc.-from dharma sound arise-from beings all ripen and
[25982] Food clothes rain make do
[25983] That-also birth and enter control this two exhaust follow inner expanse-to enter occasion not-there obtain-from
[25984] Beings benefit-to inward not return bardo beings three-thousand instantaneous free make-from expanse-to enter
[25985] Do birth control-from inward return gradual three-thousand free make-from
[25986] Birth enter many kalpa field dust number-to beings benefit whatever do
[25987] Earth treasure and
[25988] Jewel and
[25989] Dharma classification etc.-from time long some benefit accomplish although that means-to momentary also pass not-exist-from
[25990] Other-from compassion wonder arise and activity vision enter cause
[25991] Our guru holy Vimala and Padmakara very sublime such rely those this or bardo without-doubt free certain
[25992] Manner these secret conduct seed tantra from
[25993] Inner body exhaust ground arrive time
[25994] Finger etc. thus vision
[25995] This focus element self cease
[25996] Birth and enter difference-by
[25997] Dharma all exhaust self ground-to
[25998] What also hold not
[25999] Abide is emanation body
[26000] This-by enter power control
[26001] Birth self-power who obtain
[26002] That also that-to focus-from
[26003] Again time thus do time
[26004] Vision self-sound rustling
[26005] Manifest reverse delusion vision
[26006] This-by beings benefit all do
[26007] Awareness equal one cause
[26008] Thousand three beings
[26009] Transfer great this accomplish
[26010] Thus gradual and instantaneous
[26011] Body this-by accomplish
[26012] That all body exhaust measure-from free
[26013] This all result certain
[26014] Ground supreme mandala great accomplish
[26015] Thus
[26016] Thus vision four dawn that also path arise sequence by-say
[26017] Example ladder rung like
[26018] That also path abide part-from dawn agent not cease
[26019] Path obtain part-from what also not establish not-exist
[26020] Thus vision four measure arrive-from this itself contaminated not vision Buddha-from
[26021] Vehicle common those-from especially sublime-from
[26022] Dharma this meet-from diligence practice do-to effort do
[26023] That itself-to
[26024] Buddha accomplish desire person-by
[26025] This means possess thus thus
[26026] Other conduct pride do itself is-from
[26027] Entity see not
[26028] That cause this all rare word
[26029] Always jewel treasure this look
[26030] Thus
[26031] Meaning four extreme rely instruction four above those support back support or closely arise
[26032] That also unmoving three speech-to ground establish
[26033] Vow three measure hold
[26034] Obtain three nail strike
[26035] Confidence four free measure show those
[26036] Thal 'gyur from
[26037] That-to extreme rely faith do
[26038] Unmoving three-to ground establish-from
[26039] Wind mind vital-to arrive
[26040] Abide three measure hold-from
[26041] Dream reverse and body speech mind
[26042] Sign and measure certain hold
[26043] Obtain three nail strike-from
[26044] Contaminated aggregate not vision
[26045] Thus and
[26046] Mu tig phreng ba from
[26047] Measure is confidence four yogin itself
[26048] Thus
[26049] First unmoving three-by ground establish-from nirvana ground seal
[26050] Body unmoving three-by vital press and
[26051] Speech unmoving three-by path clear and
[26052] Mind unmoving three-by gorge wrap coil
[26053] First body unmoving three-to
[26054] Pervade posture unmoving-by channel vital-to bring
[26055] Dawn agent gaze manner unmoving-by path straight
[26056] Bind draw unmoving-by wind go come block
[26057] First
[26058] Mu tig phreng ba from
[26059] Body vital is this three
[26060] Lion manner and elephant manner
[26061] Rishi like know should
[26062] Thus-by
[26063] Emanation body posture-to
[26064] Sound explain and
[26065] Meaning divide two-from
