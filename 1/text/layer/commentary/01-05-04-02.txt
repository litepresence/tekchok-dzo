[6420-6420] Third—the thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector. The thousand Brahmas represent the thousand-fold display of awareness's own creativity. Each Brahma a facet, each world-protector a guardian of recognition. The numbers spiral outward to demonstrate: no limit to the ground's spontaneous expression.

[6420-6420] One without learning... once tried to count the Brahmas! By the time he reached three hundred, his mind was exhausted. Then he laughed—the thousand were not out there in space but the thousand thoughts that dance through awareness every moment. Yama protects the boundary between recognizing and forgetting.

[6420-6420] See through the counting and FIND THE GROUND THAT COUNTS! The thousand Brahmas are one awareness wearing masks. Remove the mask—recognize the face. The cosmology becomes transparent—window into your own nature.
