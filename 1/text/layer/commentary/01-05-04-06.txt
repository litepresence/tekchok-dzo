 Samantabhadra is not a deity to worship. He is your own primordial nature. The samsara-destroyer is not someone else—it is recognition itself. The sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons are not literal time—they represent the inexhaustible nature of compassionate activity.

Stop looking for Samantabhadra outside yourself. Rest in the recognition that you are Samantabhadra.

[6433-6438]
COMPLETE SYNTHESIS:

The seven buddhas represent seven aspects of recognition:
1. Self-remembering (Smṛti-protector)
2. Arisen at beginning (Śikhin)
3. World protection (Viśvabhū)
4. Solar illumination (Krakucchanda)
5. Flame-mouthed (Kanakamuni)
6. Light-ray rim (Kāśyapa)
7. Samsara-destruction (Śākyamuni/Maitreya)

All seven are one recognition showing seven faces.

May all beings recognize the samsara-destroyer in themselves.
May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate all paths.

Om ah hum.

 The samsara-destroyer's activity spans sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons—not as endurance but as natural expression. Recognition, once stabilized, continues effortlessly. The destroyer doesn't work at destroying; recognition naturally dissolves what was never established.

This is not achievement through effort but effortless expression of nature. Like the sun shining—no effort, no pause, no exhaustion.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce cutting: AEONS? TIME? Cut through! One instant of recognition contains all time! The samsara-destroyer doesn't need aeons! Recognition is now! Complete! Final!

[6657-6714]
Mountain hermit's aeon meditation: I contemplated these vast time scales until my mind balked. Sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons! How long is that? Then I realized: the measurement is pedagogical. The recognition happens in an instant. The instant contains all aeons. Time is mind's projection; recognition transcends it.

The samsara-destroyer doesn't wait for aeons. Recognition is immediate.

Singing yogi's aeon song:
Sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons vast
Samantabhadra's time contrast
Not enduring, not waiting long
Recognition's instant, the samsara-destroyer's song

The destroyer destroys what was never built
Recognition's lightning, confusion's guilt
All dissolved in one clear seeing
Samantabhadra's activity, endlessly freeing
