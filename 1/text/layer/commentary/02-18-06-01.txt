First: wisdom does not dawn through ordinary ways of gazing. One must train in the three gazes of the three kayas. From the Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra: "By dharmakaya's gaze manner, press and draw out three realms of samsara; sambhogakaya does not destroy samsara's ground; nirmanakaya liberates into buddha-field."

This old hermit learned: the gaze is not merely looking—it is the training itself. Three kayas, three gazes, one wisdom unfolding.


Observe. Understand. Release.
The gaze is not passive but active—not aggressive but awake. Ordinary
gazing: scattered, distracted, habitual. Extraordinary gazing: focused,
relaxed, knowing.

From the Glorious Sky-Equal Tantra: three gazes for three realms. Dharmakaya
presses and draws out—transcends completely. Sambhogakaya does not destroy
—transmutes while preserving. Nirmanakaya liberates into—transforms and
transfers. Three methods, three capacities, three results.
