Three aspects of expansion—first, completion. From Self-Arising: in pure appearance of three kayas, one complete, two complete, all complete. Wisdom appearing unceasing and clear. Pure wisdom, light-rays emanating. In awareness free from concept, five lights unceasing. In great self-liberation without grasping, outer, inner, secret dharmas all clear.

Listen: in awareness released from action, actor and acted complete in single moment. Not gradually—in one moment. In awareness separated from mind, all variety complete. In great clear purity, deluded appearances complete. In great self-liberated self-appearance, other-arisen dharmas complete. Such is manner of three kayas' completion.


One who walked paths... spent years trying to complete something. Practices, retreats,
accumulations—endless becoming. Then laughed: complete from the beginning,
never incomplete, never needing completion. One complete: dharmakaya as
ground. Two complete: sambhogakaya as enjoyment. All complete: nirmanakaya
as display. Three yet one, one yet three.

Notice. Allow. Rest.
recognition. Like realizing you've been holding the treasure you sought.
Actor and acted: both complete in one moment of awareness. Not gradually:
time collapses in recognition.
