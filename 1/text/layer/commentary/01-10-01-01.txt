[12500-12519]
See what is. Existence itself—srid pa—grasped as real. Sentient beings' forms
arise inconceivably, beyond ordinary mind's reach. The path of delusion and
intention emerges as conceptual thought follows its own projections.

An old traveler... spent decades seeking the meaning of these symbols. Finally he
understood: Vajrasattva is rigpa itself. The Land of Vast Expanses is your own
nature. Every symbol points to what was never hidden.

[12500-13103]
Between all these perspectives—the visionary, the systematic, the stark, the
earthy, the scholarly—we find the middle way. Not rejecting the symbols as mere
superstition. Not grasping them as literal truth. Using them as they are meant
to be used: as pointers to direct recognition.

[12520-12540]
Therefore. Thus. The symbolic narratives reveal delusion and liberation through
profound metaphors. The year of the pig—when non-recognition fully established
itself as conceptual imputation. The emanated sun—coarse perception arising as
Nirmanakaya.

 The bird constellation appears in the sky of
mind, representing desire grasping at objects of the five senses. The old woman
with the mushroom hat emerges—co-emergent ignorance itself, blocking the gate
of liberation.

[12541-12560]
The four rugged ones represent the four conditions. The five wild ones—the five
poisons that obscure natural awareness. The single thief—anger stealing peace.
The single gatherer—deluded appearances compressed into grasped reality.

 Each symbol corresponds to specific aspects of
bondage. Yet recognizing the correspondence liberates. The sign and the signified
are not two.

[12561-12580]
In former times in the Land of Vast Expanses dwelt the Teacher Light Diffusion.
His two sons—primordial purity and spontaneous presence—imprisoned in the retreat cave at Chimphu
of non-recognition. Five soldiers conquered from the stone fortress peak.

This is not history. It is your own mind's drama
playing out now. The Teacher is awareness. The sons are wisdom aspects. The
imprisonment is forgetting your own nature.

[12581-12600]
The two sons escaping and killing guards—recognizing self-awareness, dissolving
conceptual bonds. Fleeing to sun and rain, gathering subjects—rigpa entering
the eyes, beholding the expanse. The twenty-one queens consulting—twenty-one
instructions manifesting inner meaning.

While walking to the temple, while
cooking the evening meal, while laughing with friends—this same recognition is
available. Never separate from daily life.

[12601-12620]
The five men guarding with five hats—the bindu of five lights remaining
unmoving, unreachable by thought. The four mirrors looking at the demon—the four
lamps' wisdom revealing self-abiding rigpa. Seeing the house with eight doors—
recognizing spontaneous presence.

Essence Holder's spacious instruction: Rest in this recognition. Do not try to
make it happen. Do not try to stop it. The resting itself is the view.

[12610-12615]
Modern Bridge's pragmatic pointing: You don't need to believe in demons or
magic swords. The demon is your confusion. The sword is your insight. The
journey is your practice. The treasure is your recognition. The teaching is
practical, immediate, available now.

[12621-12640]
Third section: Another teaching from spontaneous presence. In the Land of Great
Circumference, a single lamp not extinguished within great mire of body and
mind. The Teacher Mirror Possessor—embodiment of awareness—speaking to Radiant
Being.

Ecstatic Tertön's urgency: Why wait? The recognition is here now. Not in the
story. Not in the symbol. Here, in the awareness reading these words.

[12641-12660]
Upon Mount Malaya's peak, Father Light Protection and Mother Vajra Sow dwell.
From their union came two children—wisdom and means. The son refusing to go to
demon land, fearing imprisonment by Black Halika—fearing non-recognition.

 The fear itself is the demon. The hesitation
is the prison. Go anyway. Recognition cuts through all obstacles.

[12661-12680]
The son asking for five servants—five wisdoms. Five mirrors—five Buddha
families. Sword anointed with sesame oil of clear light. The means are provided.
One need only use them.

Visionary Devotee's longing: How I pray for these supports! How I long for the
guru's blessing that opens the eyes! This longing itself is the path.

[12681-12700]
The parents' instruction: In the Jewel Heap Land of the mind dwell four caste
people—the four lamps. Ask them, and they will show the path. The son going to
demon land, meeting the mushroom woman—co-emergent ignorance asking for the
sword of recognition.

 She asks for your conceptual mind. Give it. She asks
for your grasping. Surrender it. In the giving, fire is obtained.

[12701-12720]
The son giving the sword—cutting through grasping. The mushroom woman pleased,
giving fire—the fire of wisdom obtained. Going to the temple of Four Fierce
Brothers—four wisdom lamps dwelling there.

Lion-Faced's fierce compassion: Cut through now! Do not negotiate with the
demon of ignorance. Give what must be given. Obtain what was always yours.

[12721-12740]
Between the elaborate symbolism and direct recognition, no separation exists.
The symbols are fingers. The recognition is the moon. Stop analyzing the fingers
and look at what they indicate.

 All these narratives—one teaching in many forms.
The ground is your nature. The path is recognition. The fruition is continuous.

[12741-12760]
This very moment—are you not the Teacher Light Diffusion? Are these not your
two sons of purity and presence? Is this not the demon land of samsara? The
recognition is here. The symbols dissolve into what they always pointed to.

You want to decode the story? You want to understand
every symbol? Meanwhile, the awareness that hears these words is the Teacher.
Stop playing with metaphors. Recognize directly.

[12761-12800]
Look. Recognize. Rest.
Recognition sees. Liberation rests. Forget these, and even perfect decoding will
not help. Remember these, and the Treasury opens itself.

I sat in retreat once... bows. The narratives have been told. The symbols explained.
What remains? Your own recognition. Look. See. Rest.

[12801-12850]
Now the deeper meaning unfolds. The boy Vajra Chain Puller represents rigpa's
power to bind and liberate. His sister Rim Holder represents the bindu of clear
light that holds the essence. Together they embody method and wisdom united.

The parents' prophecy is not mere storytelling—it is the self-arising instruction
of your own nature. When the Teacher Mirror Possessor speaks, it is awareness
recognizing itself. The crystal stupa is your own heart center. The four silver
mirrors are the four lamps that reveal the natural state.

[12807-12812]
Living Library's vast knowing: These narratives appear in many traditions,
many forms. The elements vary, but the structure remains. The journey to the
other world. The meeting with the demon. The obtaining of the treasure. The
return to the source. This is the hero's journey, the shamanic voyage, the
alchemical opus—all. The bird calls, you turn to look. The call is not the bird. the same recognition.

[12851-12900]
Mountain hermit understood: Mount Malaya is not in India or Tibet. It is the
peak of your own awareness. The crystal stupa is not an external monument. It is
the bindu of clear light in your heart center. The five servants are the five
wisdoms already present, waiting to be deployed.

He sat in his cave for twenty years, waiting for liberation to come from outside.
Then one morning, watching the play of light on the hidden cave of Pemako wall, he laughed. The
liberation was the light. the hidden cave of Pemako was the stupa. The watching was the recognition.

[12901-12950]
The narrative follows the structure of
the path—ground (parents), path (journey), fruition (recognition). The obstacles
(demons, imprisonment) represent the stages of delusion. The supports (servants,
mirrors, sword) represent the means of liberation. The final meeting with the
Teacher represents direct recognition.

Each element corresponds to specific aspects of practice. The four cast people
are the four lamps. The iron chains are method and wisdom bound together. The
fire obtained is the wisdom of clear light. The crystal stupa is the Dharmakaya
within.

[12951-13000]
 Enough stories! Enough symbols! The boy is you.
The demon land is your confusion. The parents are your true nature. The
recognition is now. Three words. See. Decide. Rest.

[12954-12959]
The house with eight doors—the eight doors of spontaneous presence. Enter any
one, and you enter all. The mother of manifold appearance—she is your own
confused perception. When you fail to recognize her, she binds you. When you
recognize her, she liberates you.

[13001-13050]
The story continues—the siblings consult and see the Teacher. This represents
the union of method and wisdom recognizing the master within. The prophecy
unfolds step by step, each element a doorway to recognition.

The crystal stupa with five levels represents the five wisdoms manifesting as
the five Buddha families. The four silver mirrors represent the four lamps that
show the way. Mount Malaya's peak represents the crown center where awareness
abides.

[13051-13100]
 This old fool tried to climb Mount Malaya once! Sought
it in maps, in guidebooks, in pilgrimage routes. Finally, exhausted, I sat down
and looked at my own mind. There was Mount Kailash. There was the stupa. There
was the recognition I had been seeking.

[13051-13056]
Dakini's whisper: The rope of light from the Teacher's foot—do not fear it. It
is the connection between your heart and the expanse. Grasp it without grasping.
Hold it without holding. Let it pull you into recognition. This is the secret
instruction.

[13101-13103]
The four silver mirrors—what are they? They reflect without grasping. They show
what is without adding or subtracting. They are the four lamps: the lamp of the
abiding nature, the lamp of the bindu of light, the lamp of the distant lasso,
and the lamp of self-arising wisdom. Each one shows the path. Together they
illuminate completely.
