[5925-5927] Ninth—the Ground of Excellent Intelligence. Upon this ground, wisdom's luminosity dawns spontaneously, no longer constrained by deliberate cultivation. The practitioner sees all dharmas as clouds in the vast sky—appearing, shifting, dissolving, yet never departing from the sky's nature. This is not mere philosophical understanding but direct recognition: phenomena are like clouds, awareness is like space.

 This old yogi once watched clouds for three months in a mountain cave! Every morning they would form, every evening they would disperse. One day, he realized—his thoughts were clouds, his awareness the sky. The sky never tried to hold the clouds. The clouds never stained the sky. This is the ninth ground: not achieving something new but recognizing what was always the case.


 Excellent intelligence! Cloud-like dharmas! Spontaneous luminosity! All concepts! Cut through them—can you grasp a cloud? Can you hold the sky? The intelligence is not excellent because it knows more. It is excellent because it knows knowing itself. See through the appearance and FIND THE NATURE THAT APPEARS!


 The ninth ground integrates appearance and emptiness into non-dual recognition. Clouds appear—emptiness does not negate them. Clouds are empty—appearance does not solidify them. Do not reject the cloud-like display. Do not cling to sky-like emptiness. Rest in the integration where appearance is emptiness, emptiness is appearance, and both are labels for what transcends both.


 The essence of the ninth ground: self-knowing knowing itself. Not knowledge of objects but knowledge knowing its own nature. The cloud metaphor Your voice echoes through the slopes of Gangri Tokar, Chimphu, and Namtso—the echo is not your voice. this—clouds (phenomena) appear in sky (awareness), yet what knows both is neither cloud nor sky but the self-luminous knowing that cannot be pointed to. Hold this essence.


 I have sung the cloud metaphor across mountain ranges! Each valley hears it differently. Some hear "everything is impermanent." Some hear "everything is empty." But the true song sings: everything is self-liberated, naturally free, like clouds that never leave the sky. Sing, practitioner, sing—through the ninth ground into the sky of your own nature!


 This old vagabond's final word on excellent intelligence: stop trying to be intelligent about it! The clouds teach without teaching. The sky holds without holding. Your own mind shows you the ninth ground every moment—thoughts like clouds, awareness like sky. You have been on this ground since before you sought it. Rest in recognition.


 Emaho! The ninth ground of excellent intelligence—where wisdom dawns spontaneously and all dharmas are seen as clouds in the vast sky of awareness!
