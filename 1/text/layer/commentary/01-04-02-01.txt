[2539-2546]
First, the Śrāvakayāna is explained in five aspects. Essence: the mind desiring personal liberation from samsara, the method realizing no-self of person. Definitive terminology: one who hears Dharma from teacher, propagates to others, accomplishes final existence bodhi, depending on teacher—this is a Śrāvaka. Purpose: definite emergence from samsara. Result: attaining arhatship without remainder.

[2539-2832]
Between the Śrāvaka's analytical precision and the Dzogchen's direct recognition, I weave this teaching. Not rejecting the Śrāvaka. Not stopping there. The Śrāvaka medicine cures the fever of self-grasping. Then Dzogchen reveals the patient's true nature was never sick. Both are necessary. Neither is sufficient alone.

[2547-2554]
Hear the teaching. Analyze the aggregates. Liberate through recognition. Three aspects—not really three separate things, but three ways of describing one awakening. The Śrāvaka's path: valid, important, not to be despised even by dzogchenpas who think they've transcended it all.

[2555-2562]
This uneducated yogi... once thought the Śrāvaka path was inferior. He wanted to skip to Dzogchen. He wanted direct recognition without analysis. He was like a student wanting calculus without arithmetic. The foundations matter. The analysis purifies. The recognition completes.

[2563-2572]
Division: Sautrāntika and Vaibhāṣika. Vaibhāṣika holds: conventional truth—coarse entities appear as unified collections, like yak horns, like grass huts. But ultimately: part-possessing atoms, separate, dispersed. Mind stream conventional. Moments ultimately without parts, like pot water. From aggregates, elements, sense-sources—surrounding coarse appearance with atoms, with intervals. Accepting no-self of person but accepting self of phenomena—atoms and moments existing.

[2573-2582]
Thus. We proceed. The Vaibhāṣika analysis is precise. Atoms are ultimately real. Moments are ultimately real. The person is merely a convention. This liberates from self-grasping. But it creates new grasping—grasping at atoms, grasping at moments. Different prison. Same mechanism.

[2583-2592]
An old traveler... met a Vaibhāṣika scholar. He could explain atoms. He could enumerate moments. His analysis was impeccable. But he grasped his analysis. He thought atoms were real. He thought moments were real. He was free from the self of person but bound to the self of atoms. Analysis without recognition is incomplete.

[2593-2615]
Also, truths four comprising Dharma—knowing cause-effect as abandoning-accepting. Cause. Origin. Cessation. Condition—aspects four, observing. Knowing mode: suffering object, origin to abandon, path to rely upon, cessation to obtain. Path. Reasoning. Practice. Definite emergence. Cessation. Peace. Excellence. No-self method meditating, abandoning four hundred fourteen to be abandoned of three realms through seeing and meditation, manifesting supreme wisdom of exhaustion and non-arising, desiring liberation.

[2616-2638]
Thus. We enumerate. The four noble truths are the foundation. Suffering to be known. Origin to be abandoned. Path to be relied upon. Cessation to be obtained. This is the structure. The framework. The medicine for the disease of samsara. Valid structure. Useful framework. But ultimately, all truths are conventional.

[2618-2832]
Also: from Śrāvakayāna, their path—dull, middling, great—thus Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha, Buddha's bodhi three accomplish. Not called Mahayana and Mantra path. Also: Śrāvaka and Pratyekabuddha white-pure vision ground etcetera, inferior eight grounds explained.

[2639-2661]
The twelve links of dependent origination. Ignorance creates formations. Formations create consciousness. Consciousness creates name-and-form. Name-and-form create six senses. Six senses create contact. Contact creates feeling. Feeling creates craving. Craving creates grasping. Grasping creates becoming. Becoming creates birth. Birth creates aging and death. The wheel turns. The analysis is precise. The causality is clear. But the one who analyzes remains.

[2662-2678]
Sautrāntika: objects to be observed—four truths, observing knowledges twelve, knowing thus, abandoning eighty-eight afflictions, desiring to realize supreme wisdom. Also: no-self of person like former, above that exceeding through part of Dharma element, also part-possessing atoms five bases mainly covering, mainly mind base, accompanying mind produced base, non-associated compositional aggregates base, uncompounded permanent base, appearing form base—five, realizing Dharma nature, not covering atom only without parts.

[2679-2695]
The Sautrāntika goes further. Not just atoms. The mind element. The mental factors. The non-associated formations. The uncompounded phenomena. More sophisticated analysis. More comprehensive. But still analysis. Still grasping at phenomena. Still missing the nature of the analyzer.

[2696-2716]
These two, path meditation time, path five arising sequence, diligently doing, three poisons general antidotes—no-self and illusion meditate. Individual antidotes: desire—eight impure substances, skeleton meditate. Hatred—love and dependent origination forward-reverse meditate. Delusion—breath counting meditate. No-self meditation also: object and subject ceasing cessation, not observing anything meaning meditate. Sinking: lethargy-dullness delusion antidote—crown flame mind place. Thus done: faculties dull and middling diligent some, life that itself fruit obtain. Sharp and Bodhisattvas some, path five former gone collections much accumulated support, one session path five complete, desiring liberation.

[2717-2737]
The path is graduated. According to capacity. Dull faculties need much practice. Sharp faculties accomplish quickly. The Bodhisattva may complete the five paths in one session. The gradualist needs many lifetimes. Both valid. Both lead to liberation. But liberation from samsara is not the final liberation. The final liberation recognizes samsara was never real.

[2832-2832]
Three words. Analysis complete. Recognition dawns. Rest.
