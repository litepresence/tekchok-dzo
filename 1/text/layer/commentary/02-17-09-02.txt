Fourth, clear light practice depending on four times equal joining instruction. Outer four times equal joining: channels-winds continuously held. Inner four times equal joining: speech ornament explanation exhausted. Secret four times equal joining: instruction mind unfabricated natural place. Thatness four times equal joining: instruction clear light mother-child meet.

From the tantra: "Outer time four, yogi body's power trained, channels sources holding essential. Inner time four itself, yogi speech's power trained, explanation ornaments cut vital. Secret time four also, yogi mind's power trained, sleep familiarity vital. Thatness time four, body speech mind by gathered, clear light great sleep joined, thus familiarized three bodies certainly joined, yogi!"

This old fool spent years trying to "achieve" clear light. He forced his channels, strained his winds, chased the experience like a hunter after a shadow. Finally, exhausted, he fell asleep in meditation. When he woke, clear light had been there all along—not achieved but recognized.

Four times equal joining—outer, inner, secret, thatness. Outer: hold the channels and winds continuously, day and night. Inner: cut through speech ornaments, rest in unfabricated naturalness. Secret: let mind rest in its own place, no contrivance. Thatness: the meeting of mother and child clear light. Four gates to the same palace.
