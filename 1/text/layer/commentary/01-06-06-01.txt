First joy—just joy. Second—feeling, experiential touch. Third—bliss itself.
Fourth—co-emergent experience. Fifth—emptiness. Thus the fivefold
classification of what is ultimately one taste. Dga' ba tsam nyid—mere
joy as foundation.

[8680-8685]
Bcu gnyis pa—twelfth section, viewing that itself and applying the vital
point of change. De nyid lta ba—viewing that itself. 'Gyur ba rtsi ba—
applying the key point of change. The five joys viewed as the basis,
the key point applied to transform recognition into stability.

[8680-8682]
Five stages, one bliss. View them as five aspects of single recognition.
Apply the vital point: don't seek the fifth while rejecting the first.
All five complete in simultaneity. Change is the recognition that nothing
changes. Emaho!

[8682-8686]
This wanderer once sought each joy separately. Like collecting beads for
a mala, he thought completion meant gathering all five. Then recognized:
the thread holding beads is the teaching. Five names, one experience.
Joy knowing itself.

[8684-8686]
Tshor ba myong reg—feeling, the experiential contact. Bde ba nyid—bliss
itself. Myong ba lhan cig skyes—co-emergent experience. Stong pa nyid—
emptiness. From the first to the fifth, not progression but deepening
recognition.

[8686-8686]
Joy recognized. Bliss abiding. Emptiness complete. Three words—or five
joys, or one taste. The counting is mind's game.
