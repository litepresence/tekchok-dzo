Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis establishes the fundamental distinction between the ground of mind and the ground of wisdom. The Kunzang Klongdrukpa TantraO great bodhisattva, the abode of mind is the all-ground, because the all-ground gathers all objects of thought and is known as mind.

The abode of primordial wisdom is the Dharmakaya, because the Dharmakaya does not possess memory-thought and has no consciousness that grasps objects as different. This is the essential distinction that separates samsara from nirvana, like the difference between a high plateau lake's surface and its depths.

All-ground (kun gzhi):
- Gathers habits
- Mixed with ignorance
- Basis of samsara
- To be purified

Dharmakaya (chos sku):
- Primordially pure
- Never stained
- Basis of nirvana
- Already complete

Know the distinction. Rest in Dharmakaya.

Om ah hum. Rest in Dharmakaya. Recognition complete. All-ground distinguished, Dharmakaya recognized.

Complete and perfect.

[17375-17386]
Some with manifest arrogance hold the all-ground as Dharmakaya! They cite common treatises saying the all-ground is the support of all pure and impure, and Dharmakaya is the stainless thusness within purity. Some even say when the all-ground transforms, it becomes the wisdom of the dharma-dimension and essence-body. But this contradicts the scriptures!

An old practitioner walking a pilgrimage path once insisted that the path itself was the destination. "I walk, therefore I have arrived," he proclaimed. Foolish confusion! The path remains the path; the destination waits ahead. One must complete the journey, not claim the mere walking as arrival.

[17387-17396]
Precise analysis reveals the fault: if the all-ground were Dharmakaya, Dharmakaya would possess stains. If the all-ground produces delusion of container and contained, Dharmakaya would produce delusion. If one accepts this, it follows that Buddhas would revert to sentient beings. The Kunzang Mind Mirror Tantra states: Those who hold all-ground as Dharmakaya deviate from me!

[17397-17408]
From Rangshar: Some hold all-ground as Dharmakaya. To teach them the reply, the characteristics of all-ground are thus: the all-ground is so-called because all are complete from it. Through the power of various appearances, Buddhas become sentient beings. Like a glacier that calves into the lake—ice becomes water, water is not ice. The transformation appears continuous, but ice and water maintain their distinct natures.

[17409-17420]
The all-ground is not Dharmakaya. The all-ground is mind mixed with ignorance; Dharmakaya is wisdom free from ignorance. Like a dreamer and the one who wakes—the dreamer must wake from the dream, but the waker was never dreaming. Do not confuse the two, or you will wander in confusion endlessly.

[17421-17426]
From Klongdrukpa: Therefore, if all-ground and Dharmakaya are not distinguished, they become similar to consciousness that grasps one form as different. Meaning cannot appear individually. The example of these two is like the ocean and boat. Dharmakaya, primordially pure rigpa without defilement, is like a clear ocean. The all-ground, like a boat on the ocean, has never entered the primordial expanse.

[17427-17442]
A simple practitioner... rows his boat across the lake of mind. The water is Dharmakaya—always pure, always clear, never disturbed by the boat. The boat is all-ground—carrying karma, habits, delusions, filled with many persons. The distinction is very great: one must wake from sleep and dream, but self-awareness needs no reversal.

Between the boat and the water, the vast middle way: the boat floats because of water, water remains unaffected by the boat. Use the all-ground to reach Dharmakaya, but do not mistake the vessel for the destination.

[17442-17447]
 ALL-GROUND? DHARMAKAYA? Cut through both! One awareness, one recognition, one liberation! The distinction is pedagogical, not ontological!

[17443-17464]
The all-ground and all dharmas supported by it are to be known as stains to be purified! From Thalgyur: The essential point of all-ground and Dharmakaya—there, first explain all-ground. ground of all dharma and non-dharma. Nature, word-meaning, division with. Nature is container of all habitual tendencies. Division: body and connection. Various and original-basis. Definitive-meaning: gathered at all.

Mountain hermit watching hot springs understood: the water bubbles up from deep earth, carries minerals to the surface, deposits them, and returns to depth. The all-ground bubbles up delusion, carries karma, deposits it as experience, yet the source remains pure. Do not confuse the bubbling with the source.

[17465-17478]
The nature of all-ground has five aspects: nature, definitive-meaning, division, function, cause of entering sound. First, nature: compounded virtuous forms and samsara dharmas, all complete habitual tendencies, become the container. Definitive-meaning: all-many-at. Basis gathered many of time, ground or support-basis as abiding. Division: four types—original-meaning all-ground, connection-meaning all-ground, body-habit all-ground, various-habit all-ground.

[17479-17496]
Between samsara and nirvana, the vast middle way opens. The all-ground is the basis for connection to both. The original-meaning is the first ground of samsara's dharmas. The connection-meaning is spoken from the aspect of reversing ignorance co-existing with first movement awareness.

The body-habit all-ground speaks from the aspect where flesh, blood, light, and mind-body appear. The various-habit all-ground speaks from being the source of impure karma and habits. Like prayer flags of different colors—all made of cloth, all receiving wind, all releasing prayers, yet distinct in their blessings.


[17515-17523]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce compassion: why debate the distinction endlessly? The all-ground and Dharmakaya are different—accept this and move on! Recognition of Dharmakaya is not analysis of all-ground. Wake up now!

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: while you walk the circumambulation path, while you turn the prayer wheel, distinguish the path from the goal. Every step on the path is not yet the destination, but brings you closer.

Final instruction: see through the all-ground without grasping it. Rest in Dharmakaya without seeking it. The distinction protects you from confusion. The recognition liberates you completely.



 The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty. This distinction is essential. Mistake them, and you wander in confusion.

The all-ground cannot become Dharmakaya. Sleep cannot become waking. The dreamer must wake up; the waker was never dreaming.
