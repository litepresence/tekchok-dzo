The outer, inner, secret, and perfect—do not mistake these for stages you climb. They are simultaneous dimensions of a single recognition. The outer divides the border of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Look: where exactly is this border? Is it somewhere in the Himalayas? In the spaces between thoughts? No—it is right here, in the gap between recognizing and not-recognizing. When you recognize your nature, you are in nirvāṇa. When you forget, you wander saṃsāra. The border is simply awareness or its absence. The inner engages the twenty-five gnoses—offering the maṇḍala of your experience, supplicating not a distant deity but your own enlightened potential. The secret enters through the doors of the four directions of space into the door of mind itself. What does this mean? East, south, west, north—these are not geographical. They are the directions of appearance, the ways phenomena manifest. Enter through any of them and you arrive at the same door: mind's nature. The perfect indicates awareness primordially pure, transcending conceptual mind, called "vast space." Not space as opposed to form, but space as the infinite capacity in which all form dances without obstruction.

In the mountains of Kham, there was a yogi who lived in a cave for thirty years. When asked what he practiced, he said: "I practice the border. Every morning, I sit and look for the line between samsara and nirvana. Every morning, I find there is no line. The looking is the practice. The not-finding is the result." He was famous for never refusing anyone who came to him, yet never seeking anyone out. "If they recognize," he said, "they don't need me. If they don't, I can't help them." But he sat there, day after day, like a mountain himself, and somehow his presence helped many recognize what they had been seeking. This is the mystery of transmission—it happens in the space between recognition and non-recognition, in the presence of one who rests stably in rigpa.

The division into four aspects—outer, inner, secret, perfect—reflects the Buddhist pedagogical principle of graduated instruction (anupubbi-katha), but with a crucial Dzogchen twist. In ordinary gradual paths, one moves from coarser to subtler levels. Here, the levels are presented as simultaneous aspects of a single truth viewed from different angles. The outer aspect deals with conduct and behavior, the proper way to be in the world as a practitioner. The inner involves meditation and visualization, the transformation of perception. The secret concerns the subtle energetics and the actualization of primordial wisdom. The perfect reveals that all these were never separate from the natural state. The twenty-five gnoses (yeshes) are the five wisdoms multiplied by the five buddha families, representing the complete spectrum of enlightened knowing. Offering the maṇḍala of experience means recognizing that every perception, every thought, every emotion is already the display of awakened mind—not to be rejected but offered as the path itself. The four directions of space correspond to the four immeasurables, the four empowerments, the four extremes of existence—entering through any door, one discovers they all lead to the same place.

To practice this, begin with the outer: examine your conduct. Are you creating the conditions for recognition or for distraction? Simplify. Reduce obligations. Create space. Then the inner: establish a regular meditation practice. Sit. Look at mind. Rest. Don't try to achieve something. Just be present with what is. Then the secret: as recognition stabilizes, work with the subtle body. Practice guru yoga. Receive blessings. Dissolve conceptual mind into the master's wisdom mind. Finally, the perfect: recognize that all these practices were simply supports for what was always the case. Rest in the natural state without contrivance. The vast space is not elsewhere. It is the space in which these words appear, the space of your own awareness reading them now. Can you feel it? That open, knowing quality that has been present throughout your entire life, never changing, never separate from any experience? That is it. Rest there. This is the practice of the utterly unelaborate. No ritual. No visualization. Just recognition and rest. But don't mistake this for laziness. Maintaining recognition in every moment of activity is the most demanding practice of all.

The Thalgyur speaks: "From the very unelaborate, divide below the border of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa." The unelaborate is your nature before concepts. From there, the division becomes obvious—not as philosophical position, but as direct knowledge. At that time, from the characteristic of space itself, the obscurations of body, speech, and mind are gauged. What are these obscurations? Merely the failure to recognize that body is deity, speech is mantra, mind is wisdom. They are gauged by characteristic—meaning they are seen through, seen as they truly are. If conduct is not pure, purify with virtue suitable to each self. This does not mean moralistic purification. It means aligning action with recognition. Rely upon the symbolic empowerment—the master's pointing, the ritual's structure—until you can introduce the face of self-knowing clarity directly. Then skillfully join the instruction of untying symbols. The symbols were never the point; they were fingers pointing. Untie them and see what they indicated.

I once asked my teacher about the "characteristic of space" mentioned here. He laughed and said: "You are looking for something complicated. Characteristic of space means just this—space has no characteristics. It cannot be stained. It cannot be improved. It cannot be diminished. Your awareness is exactly like this. The obscurations appear within it like clouds in sky, but do they stain the sky? No. They arise and dissolve, arise and dissolve. The gauging means recognizing this. You don't gauge with a measuring stick. You gauge by recognizing the ungaugable nature of what is." He paused, then added: "But this recognition must be stabilized through conduct. If you think 'I am empty, so I can do anything,' you have misunderstood. Conduct purifies the channels for recognition to flow unobstructed. It's like keeping the water pipes clean so the water can run clear."

The Thalgyur Root Tantra is one of the Seventeen Tantras of the Upadesha series, the core Dzogchen scriptures. Its name means "Total Arising" or "Complete Manifestation," indicating that all phenomena are the total display of primordial purity. When it speaks of "dividing below the border," it uses the metaphor of surveying—establishing the boundary line between two territories. In this case, the territories are not geographical but ontological: the domain of confusion and the domain of liberation. The crucial point is that this division is made "from the very unelaborate"—from the natural state itself, not from the perspective of conceptual mind. Conceptual mind cannot truly distinguish samsara from nirvana because it itself is samsara. Only rigpa, primordial awareness, can see the distinction clearly because it is nirvana. The obscurations of body, speech, and mind are gauged (bsgom, literally "measured" or "assessed") by their characteristic—meaning by seeing their true nature as empty display. Body is not physical matter but deity (lha). Speech is not mere sound but mantra. Mind is not discursive thought but wisdom. When this is recognized, the obscurations self-liberate.

Purification here does not mean washing away dirt from a fundamentally impure object. It means recognizing the impure as never having existed apart from purity. "Virtue suitable to each self" indicates individualized practice—what purifies one practitioner may not purify another. For some, strict discipline and moral rectitude create the necessary conditions for recognition. For others, more esoteric methods are appropriate. The key is alignment—action aligned with recognition, speech aligned with truth, mind aligned with the natural state. The symbolic empowerment is essential for most practitioners because we are so deeply habituated to ordinary perception. The ritual structure creates a temporary alternative reality where sacred perception is possible. But the goal is to transcend even this—to introduce the face of self-knowing clarity directly, without reliance on external supports. "Untying symbols" means seeing through the ritual to what it points at. The vajra is not a scepter but indestructible awareness. The bell is not brass but emptiness sounding. The maṇḍala is not colored powder but the display of mind. Untie these symbols and rest in what they indicate.

Now the utterly unelaborate empowerment—bestowing the recognition of spontaneous accomplishment of the nature of reason through body's posture, gaze, and stance. The Thalgyur again: from four aspects—outer, inner, secret, perfect. The outer shows posture: body seated in equilibrium, channels aligned, energies balanced. But this is not gymnastics. The posture reveals the natural state—the spine straight like a mountain, relaxed like a lion. The inner shows gaze: eyes open, unfocused, gazing into space while seeing nothing in particular. The secret: through posture directed to the four directions, and training in the manner of gaze, you practice in the buddha-field. The directions open; space becomes the practice environment itself. The perfect applies the meaning of symbolic words—"song" and so forth. Why song? Because awakened mind is not silent; it is the continuous spontaneous melody of existence. To the utterly unelaborate, open the door of the mind's maṇḍala. Definitely begin with the body's posture. Accustom yourself to that, apply the manner of gaze. Direct cognition is the symbol of scripture—not intellectual understanding, but recognition itself.

A remarkable woman practitioner in Bhutan taught me about posture. She was eighty years old but sat like a young yogi, perfectly straight yet completely relaxed. "Your posture is your statement to yourself," she said. "When you slump, you say 'I am heavy, I am burdened, I am subject to gravity and time.' When you sit straight, you say 'I am space, I am awareness, I am free.' But it must be natural, not forced. Forced posture is just another ego-construction. Find the posture where body remembers its true nature." She showed me how to align the spine so the central channel (uma) is straight, how to position the hands in the meditation mudra (dhyana mudra) with thumbs touching to complete the circuit of energy, how to tuck the chin slightly to regulate the flow of bindus. "These are not rules," she emphasized. "They are invitations to body to express what it already knows."

The utterly unelaborate empowerment (shin tu spros med) represents the pinnacle of Atiyoga, the highest of the nine vehicles. Unlike lower vehicles that rely on elaborate ritual, visualization, and gradual transformation, this empowerment introduces the natural state directly. The body's posture is crucial because body and mind are not separate. A slumped body produces dullness and torpor. A tense body produces agitation and striving. The seven-point posture of Vairochana—legs crossed, hands in mudra, spine straight, shoulders level, chin tucked, tongue against palate, eyes gazing into space—creates the physical conditions for recognition. But posture alone is insufficient. The inner gaze transforms perception. Eyes open, looking neither at objects nor into blankness, the practitioner gazes into space (bar snang). This is not spacing out but a highly alert, non-focused awareness that takes the sky or empty space as its support. In this gaze, thoughts cannot maintain their solidity; they dissolve like mist in sunlight. The secret level involves directing this gaze and posture toward the four directions, symbolizing the opening of awareness in all directions without preference or obstruction. Space itself becomes the maṇḍala, the practice environment, the buddha-field.

The symbolic words—"song," "dance," "play"—indicate that awakened mind is not static, not a frozen emptiness, but dynamic, creative, expressive. The natural state sings itself into manifestation. To practice: first, establish the physical posture. Sit comfortably but upright. Let the spine hold itself without effort, like a stack of coins balanced by their own weight. Place the hands in meditation mudra, right on left, thumbs touching. Tuck the chin slightly, not enough to strain but enough to feel the energy channel align. Open the eyes and gaze softly into space—not looking at the wall, not looking at thoughts, just gazing. Rest in that open awareness. When thoughts arise, don't follow them. Don't push them away. Just remain gazing. They self-liberate. The "song" of mind continues—thoughts, perceptions, sensations—but you rest as the space in which they arise. This is the utterly unelaborate. No visualization. No mantra. No conceptual meditation. Just recognition of what has always been the case. Direct cognition—not thinking about awareness but being awareness. This is the symbol of scripture, the meaning behind all the words, the essence of the Buddha's teaching.

Thus, regarding the kinds of bestowed empowerments, there are three approaches. Briefly shown through the definite distinctions of the Four Empowerments—this is for those with sharp faculties who need only the essential pointing. Extensively explained through distinctions of self-face—this unfolds the nuances of recognition, how rigpa manifests in various situations, how to sustain and stabilize. Very extensively elaborated through distinctions of emanation—this reveals how from one recognition, all display arises, how the master's blessing transmits, how the student ripens. Regarding the first approach, the valid establishment of the Four Empowerments' certainty: this is not arbitrary construction. The four ripen like teeth in a child—natural stages of maturation. Showing examples of this ripening: the vase empowerment like a seed planted, the secret like water nourishing, the wisdom-knowledge like warmth and light, the word like full flowering. Explaining the nature of each reveals how obscurations are purified, how latencies are awakened, how the result is made manifest. Three aspects emerge from each empowerment: the ripening of what was potential, the purification of what obscured, and the manifestation of what was always present.

My root teacher once explained the three approaches using the analogy of a mountain. "For some students, I simply point to the mountain and say 'Climb.' They understand. This is the brief approach. For others, I must describe the path, the rest stops, the dangers, the viewpoints along the way. This is the extensive approach. For still others, I must tell stories of those who climbed before, describe the view from the summit in detail, inspire them with poetry and song until they are compelled to climb themselves. This is the very extensive approach. But the mountain is the same. The summit is the same. Only the method of approach differs." He then laughed and added, "And of course, the secret teaching is that there is no mountain, no climber, and no summit. But you can't start with that. Or rather, you can, but very few can hear it."

The three approaches to empowerment reflect the three capacities of beings: sharp, medium, and dull faculties. This is not a value judgment but a recognition of individual differences in karmic readiness. The brief approach (bsdus pa) presents the essential structure of the Four Empowerments without extensive elaboration. It assumes the recipient already has a stable foundation in practice and needs only the crucial pointing. The extensive approach (rgyas pa) unfolds the self-face (rang ngo) of rigpa—how it appears in meditation, post-meditation, sleep, dream, death, and the bardo. It teaches methods for sustaining recognition in all states and circumstances. The very extensive approach (shin tu rgyas pa) explains emanation (sprul pa)—how the master's blessing manifests, how the student's potential ripens, how the result emerges from the ground. This includes detailed teachings on the guru principle, the lineage of blessing, the signs of progress, and the obstacles that arise. The certainty of the Four Empowerments is established through scripture (lung), reasoning (rigs pa), and instruction (man ngag)—the three valid sources of knowledge in Buddhism.

The analogy of ripening teeth beautifully illustrates the natural, spontaneous quality of spiritual maturation. A child doesn't decide to grow teeth; they emerge according to natural law when conditions are right. Similarly, the empowerments don't create enlightenment but allow what is latent to manifest. The vase empowerment plants the seed of buddhahood in the mental continuum. The secret empowerment waters it with bliss-emptiness experience. The wisdom-knowledge empowerment provides the warmth and light of discriminating awareness. The word empowerment brings full flowering—the direct recognition of rigpa. The purification that occurs is not of something truly impure but of the misconception of impurity. The latencies (bag chags) are not destroyed but transformed—like ice melting into water, they become the display of wisdom. The result is not newly achieved but newly recognized. This is the unique Dzogchen view: ground and fruition are not separate. The three aspects—ripening, purification, manifestation—describe a single process viewed from different angles. What ripens is the potential for recognition. What purifies is the obscuration preventing recognition. What manifests is the recognition itself. All three are aspects of the natural state revealing itself to itself.
