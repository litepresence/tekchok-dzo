[8677-8679]
Fifth joy—emptiness not empty. Fullness without edge. Mind and wisdom
neither opening nor closing. Like ice forming on lake—not solid, not liquid.
Neither holding nor releasing. First four joys were preparation; this is
recognition.

[8677-8678]
Not transcending extremes—nothing to transcend. Middle way is ground beneath
all positions. Like bird flying through sky—no path remains.

[8679-8679]
This mountain dweller... tried to open to wisdom, close off confusion. Like doorkeeper
at border. Then one morning, no gate. No keeper. Just valley holding
everything equally. Snow, rock, rainbow—all exactly as is.
