[6801-6804]
Student's six realms' seeds exhausted, six afflictions purified, six wisdoms' meaning dawns. That itself, power possessed. The teacher has the power to transform the student's habitual tendencies. The six realms are not external places. They are states of mind. The six poisons are not moral faults. They are wisdom not recognized. The teacher Steam rising from tea—warmth is indicated, but the vapor is not the heat. this recognition.

[6805-6808]
Attend. Recognize. Liberate.

[6809-6818]
Also, lama divided: root and accessory, two. First, root lama: four characteristics complete, empowerment basis established, tantra explained, instruction shown, present also I lama that shown instruction practice. Instruction lama: empowerment basis established, tantra explained is auxiliary. Instruction struck, becomes auxiliary lama three complete.

[6819-6828]
Thus. We categorize. The root lama is the source of empowerment. The instruction lama transmits the methods. The auxiliary lama supports the practice. All three may be one person. Or three different persons. What matters is the transmission. The recognition.

[6829-6844]
Incidentally, teacher to be abandoned: From Self-Arising: "Not knowing great pride, dull-ignorance word-hooked, secret mantra meaning not understanding, others' fault-seeking competitive words, wrong path entered, empowerment mandala face not seen, samaya spread, asked not able answer, heard little pride great—teacher not examined, student's mara. Secret mantra teacher not. Great Perfection Ati cannot teach. With that, do not associate."

[6845-6860]
The meditation cave at Drak Yerpa hermit... once followed a teacher with great pride. The teacher knew many words. He could quote scriptures. He wore elaborate robes. But he had not recognized his own nature. He taught from books. Not from recognitioThis mountain dweller...ool wasted years. Then he found a true teacher. Simple. Humble. But recognized. The difference was everything.

[6861-6882]
Second, student's nature: from samsara's dharmas, mind reversed. Lama, dharma, companion devotion and longing great. Faith firm, dharma other mind not entering. Definite meaning devoted, generosity and diligence great. Attachment little, continuum good. Wisdom great, samaya and vows abide. Others' mind accord, dharma transform. Lama's speech listen, secret door not mix. Hearing-contemplation great, own continuum tame. Particularly lama Buddha or more devotion having. Possessing ten dharmas. Supreme liberation student good. Quickly from samsara liberate supreme obtain certain.

[6883-6904]
The student is not a blank slate. The student must have capacity. Devotion. Longing. Faith. Diligence. These are the fertile ground. Without them, the teachings fall on stone. The student must be humble but confident. Devoted but not dependent. These qualities create the conditions for recognition.

[6899-7098]
One who walked paths... has explained the teacher and student relationship. The root lama. The instruction lama. The auxiliary lama. The qualities to avoid in a teacher. The qualities to seek in a student. The importance of proper vessel. All In-breath, pause, out-breath. The cycle A map shows the path, but paper is not the journey. stillness. one thing: recognition requires proper conditions.

[6905-6931]
Also from Self-Arising: "Faith power and diligence great. Wisdom great, attachment not. Humility great, secret mantra practice. Concept-free mind, distraction not. Samaya possess, practice diligent. Earnest and clear longing possess. Natural and spontaneous meditation practice. Teacher said accordingly act. Samaya spread not release. Conduct other accordingly act. Devotion manner mind and. One word teaching also follow. Own meaning accordingly act. Secret aspire able. Vajra meaning not transgress. Hear great person rely. Own meaning transgress not. Pride words not, gentle speak. Other mind accord enter. Teacher and thus-gone, not different one manner. That is student's characteristic. That possessing student, Great Perfection vessel said."

[6932-6958]
From Oddiyana, I see these qualities as the natural expression of recognition. Faith is not blind belief. It is confidence in the nature. Devotion is not worship. It is the nature longing for itself. Diligence is not effort. It is the natural activity of recognition.

[6959-6985]
Incidentally, student to be abandoned: From that: "Honor humility not doing, secret mantra mix practice, family continuum not, continuum not, wisdom little become, kindness exceed not, own family speak, body ornament good put, meaning-less spread—student not examined, teacher enemy. Practice not take person, Great Perfection meaning not explained."

[6986-7012]
The student without these qualities is not a fit vessel. Like milk in a dirty container. Like a lion's milk in a clay pot. The teachings are precious. They must be given to those ready. Not withheld from those ready. Not wasted on those unready.

[6997-7098]
Third, commonly doing dharma, three: master-student commonly thinking dharma. The teacher must have recognition. The student must have capacity. When these meet, recognition can be transmitted. This is the secret of the lineage. Not words passed down. Recognition passed down. From recognition to recognition. From nature to nature.

[7013-7025]
Also bad vessel that good essence cannot hold. Like lion's milk clay pot cannot hold. If put, dharma's greatness destroy, bad vessel that worse lower realms go. Bad vessel like that, must keep secret. From that: "Instruction Great Perfection meaning, bad vessel masses not put. Faith possessing some essence, bad vessel in put if, essence not two both ruin. Therefore low intelligence, keep secret."

[7026-7038]
See through the teacher! See through the student! Both are empty! The relationship is empty! The transmission is empty! See through it all! Recognition is immediate! Liberation is now!

[7098-7098]
Three words. Teacher found. Student ready. Recognition complete. Rest.
