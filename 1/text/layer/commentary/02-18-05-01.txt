First, training speech: speak less, cut ordinary talk, train briefly at first. Then train for longer periods. Even when there is no cause for speech, speak alone. Abiding in mantra, in virtuous speech. Do not mix with others' words even in syllables. At this time, the body becomes the sign, conveying meaning.

Swallowing—not chanting mantras. Firm—not even body signs. The silence becomes complete, like the meditation cave at Drak Yerpa where dripping water is the only sound.

From Seed Tantra: "Speech like a mute, not making sign with anyone, thus, whoever does this—mind's projecting and gathering self-cuts." Thus it was said.

A practitioner at a mountain hermitage took a vow of silence for three years. At first, the urge to speak was like a wild horse pulling at its tether. Gradually, like prayer flags fading in strong wind, the words lost their power. By the end, he understood: silence is not the absence of speech but the presence of something vaster.
