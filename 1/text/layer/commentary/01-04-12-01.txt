[3062-3076]
The wind moves through the meadows of Sertar without leaving a trace—this is how meaning appears when searched for directly. Where would it abide? The beginner's mind seeks a ground that was never absent, only overlooked in the very act of seeking.

A farmer does not search for the soil beneath his feet; he simply plants. So too, recognition requires no foundation beyond the recognition itself.

The Ratnagotravibhāga speaks of extremes dissolved, yet dissolution itself dissolves. What remains when even "emptiness" proves to be a designation, a Body touches ground—gesture is not the surrender. at moonlight that cannot be grasped?

[3064-3312]
The entire section—from Madhyamaka philosophy through the three outer tantras—presents a single continuum. Philosophy provides the view: emptiness. Tantra provides the method: direct recognition. The outer tantras provide the preparation: purification and meditation.

What begins as intellectual understanding (conventional truth is non-abiding) becomes direct experience (deity and self are non-dual). What begins as ritual purity (three baths, three garments) becomes natural purity (mind's primordial clearness). The path is one continuous revelation, unfolding according to the practitioner's capacity.

—

[3077-3091]
The eightfold non-abiding unfolds like a lotus that needs no support. Cause without cause. Distinction without distinction. One and many, both and neither—each concept released like a breath into morning air.

This is not philosophy as accumulation but as dissolution. The Autonomous School built structures; the Consequentialist reveals they were always sandcastles, beautiful in their impermanence.

—

[3092-3097]
No saṃsāra. The wanderer asks: "Where have I been wandering?" No answer comes because the question dissolves in the asking. No nirvāṇa to reach, for reaching implies distance, and distance requires a traveler who travels.

Even emptiness—empty. The word "emptiness" itself empty. Echo-like, chasing its own source, endlessly.

—

[3098-3106]
The non-abidings listed are not achievements but recognitions. To say "cause is non-abiding" is to see that causation itself is dependently arisen, therefore empty of inherent existence. The one who sees this does not stand apart from the seeing.

Mirror reflecting mirror—where is the original image? The reflection is perfect, complete, yet nothing is there.

—

[3107-3115]
The Consequentialist's method: enter through any door, find no floor, no ceiling, no walls. The building was a dream. This is not nihilism—the appearance of the building remains, but its substantiality evaporates like dew.

The King of Samādhi Sūtra warns against even the middle. Abandoning extremes, one might rest in the center. But the center is also a position, and positions bind. The wise one does not even abide in non-abiding.

—

[3116-3126]
The Tathāgata's permanence is not the permanence of a stone but the permanence of space—unchanging because never born. All dharmas share this nature, yet the childish grasp at signs, mistaking the pointing finger for the moon.

Like mistaking the reflection of a bird in water for a bird that can be caught.

—

[3127-3136]
Nāgārjuna's homage: dependent origination is the middle way. From non-cessation, no birth. From non-annihilation, no permanence. The opposites collapse not through force but through seeing their mutual dependency.

The chariot is not found in its parts, nor apart from them. Where then is the chariot? So too with the self, with all phenomena. The search itself reveals the emptiness of the sought.

—

[3134-3312]
From the causal vehicle's eons to the resultant vehicle's single lifetime—this compression is possible because the path is not actually traveled. The destination is not reached but recognized. The practitioner is not transformed but revealed.

The three outer tantras prepare the mind for this recognition through purification, through balance, through meditation. Each is appropriate for a different type of practitioner, yet all lead to the same door: the recognition of one's own nature as the deity's nature, the path's nature, the result's nature.

—

[3137-3146]
Thirty-seven syllables that stopped the philosophical world. Not by offering a new view but by showing all views are dependently arisen, therefore empty. The cessation of elaboration is not another elaboration but the end of the need to elaborate.

River reaching ocean—it does not cease to be water; it ceases to be "river."

—

[3147-3158]
The Refutation of Objections: Nāgārjuna has no position to defend. Therefore, no position can be attacked. The accuser projects; the accused is absent. This is not evasion—this is the nature of emptiness itself.

If I held a view, I would be vulnerable. Holding no view, there is nothing to pierce. Space cannot be wounded.

—

[3159-3163]
"Since there is nothing to refute, I refute nothing." This is not stubborn silence but the recognition that the opponent's categories are already empty. The imputation of negation belongs to the one who imputes.

Accusing silence of being loud—the accusation reveals the accuser's confusion, not the silence's volume.

—

[3164-3168]
Beyond true and false, beyond existence and non-existence, beyond even the present moment's conceptual grasp. This is the summit—yet no flag is planted here, no territory claimed. The Buddhas speak suchness without speaking it.

The view that is no view. The path that is no path. The accomplishment that is no accomplishment. All conventional designations, all ultimately empty, all equally the play of primordial wisdom.

—

[1]
The summit. After the arduous climb through conceptual systems, the air grows thin. Views require oxygen, and here there is none. What remains is not a view but viewlessness—not blindness but the clarity that sees through all seeing.

Like the mountain peak that supports no trees, no structures—just space, just openness, just the freedom from the need to be anything at all.

—

[3169-3181]
Six treatises, six doors, all opening onto the same courtyard. Nāgārjuna did not build a system; he dismantled all systems, including his own. The first turning's four truths, the second turning's signlessness, the third turning's definitive meaning—all explained, all opened.

This master is called the Second Buddha not for founding a school but for revealing what the First Buddha revealed: dependent origination is emptiness, emptiness is dependent origination. The wheel turns, yet goes nowhere.

—

[3182-3188]
The Root Wisdom, the Sixty Verses, the Seventy on Emptiness, the Fine Analysis, the Refutation, the Conventional Establishment—each a different. The bird calls, you turn to look. The call is not the bird. at the same moon. Not contradictory but complementary, like different paths up the same mountain that all dissolve at the summit.

To study one is to study all. To master all is to see they were never separate.

—

[3189-3215]
Action Tantra. The path of purity and purification, of master and servant, of deity approached with reverence and distance. Three purifications: of body through ritual bath, of speech through mantra, of mind through visualization.

The practitioner does not yet see the deity as oneself. The relationship is hierarchical, respectful, careful. Servant-like, entering the king's chamber—every movement measured, every word considered.

—

[3216-3242]
The Kriyā vehicle emphasizes external purity because the practitioner has not yet recognized internal purity. Bathing three times, changing garments, avoiding impure substances—these are training wheels for the mind that still believes in impurity.

Yet even here, wisdom whispers: the deity visualized is not different from the visualizer. The servant and master share one nature, though this is not yet seen clearly.

—

[3243-3250]
Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga—three approaches to the same realization. Like three rivers flowing from different mountains, all reaching the same ocean. Kriyā emphasizes action and purity. Upāya balances action with meditation. Yoga emphasizes meditation while maintaining some ritual.

The progression is not from wrong to right but from external to internal, from gradual to direct, from effort to recognition.

—

[3243-3312]
Returning to the Middle Way: all of this tantric elaboration—Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga, the five enlightenments, the three samayas—is itself dependently arisen, therefore empty. The Consequentialist's view encompasses all methods without being bound by any.

Nāgārjuna's six treatises provide the philosophical foundation: whatever is dependently arisen is empty. The tantras provide the method: recognize dependent origination directly in one's own experience. The meeting of view and method is the complete path.

—

[3248-3312]
Yoga Tantra. Now the relationship shifts: deity and practitioner are brothers, friends, equals. The five manifest enlightenments transform the practitioner into the deity not through supplication but through recognition.

Seat, form, emblem, generation, syllables—each a doorway through which one steps into Buddhahood. The deity does not bestow; the practitioner realizes what was always the case.

—

[3251-3261]
Upāya Tantra—the "both" vehicle. Conduct like Kriyā: purification, ritual, carefulness. View like Yoga: non-duality, emptiness, direct recognition. This is the bridge between the outer and inner, the gradual and sudden.

Bird-like with two wings—ritual and meditation together lift the practitioner. Neither alone is sufficient; together they carry one to realization.

—

[3256-3312]
The Middle Way section concludes with the summit of views. The tantra section that follows builds on this foundation. One cannot practice the outer tantras effectively without understanding emptiness. The rituals become mere superstition, the visualizations become mere fantasy.

But with the view of emptiness, everything transforms. The bath becomes the purification of conceptual mind. The mantra becomes the expression of awareness. The visualization becomes the revelation of true nature. The foundation makes the structure possible.

—

[3263-3312]
Kriyā in detail: the three purifications are the entry. Bathing, changing garments, maintaining purity—these are supports for the mind that has not yet recognized its own purity. The view is of master and servant; the practice is of careful ritual.

Yet within this carefulness, freedom is already present. The deity visualized is one's own mind's nature. The mantra recited is one's own awareness. The distinction is pedagogical, not ontological.

—

[3271-3312]
The Consequentialist's freedom from extremes is the foundation for tantra's freedom from acceptance and rejection. If nothing is inherently existent, nothing needs to be rejected. If nothing is inherently non-existent, nothing needs to be accepted. The Middle Way becomes the Great Way, the single taste of all phenomena.

This is why the Buddhas' view is called the summit—not because it is higher than others, but because it is the exhaustion of all comparative positions. No higher, no lower. Just this.

—

[3274-3312]
The Yoga Tantra's five enlightenments transform without transformation. The aggregates were always the five Buddhas; the elements were always the five consorts. The practitioner does not create this but recognizes it. The "generation" is not production but revelation.

Sun and moon, lotus and deities, syllables and emblems—these are not external supports but internal recognitions. The maṇḍala is not visualized but revealed as the nature of one's own mind.

—

[3286-3312]
The transition from sūtra to tantra is not a rejection but an acceleration. The causal vehicle requires eons of accumulation; the resultant vehicle recognizes that the result is already present. Like walking to a destination versus realizing you never left home.

Mantra's superiority lies not in different teachings but in direct methods. Many means, no difficulty, non-delusion, sharp faculties—four qualities that distinguish the swift path.

—

[3287-3312]
Deity and self as non-dual. This is the heart of Yoga Tantra. Not two entities merging but one reality seen clearly. The deity arises from oneself, dissolves into oneself, is never separate from oneself.

The three shamelessnesses: no shame before the deity (for we are one), no shame before teacher and sangha (for we share the same nature), no shame before one's own mind (for it is primordially pure). This is not recklessness but confidence born of recognition.

—

[3290-3312]
From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra: the view is realization of deity and friend, not master and servant. The conduct is without refutation or establishment—neither accepting nor rejecting, neither affirming nor denying.

The five enlightenments are practiced through the five doors: seat, form, emblem, generation, syllables. But these are not steps on a ladder; they are aspects of a single recognition. The deity's maṇḍala and one's own mind—non-dual from the beginning.

—

[3293-3312]
Action king, maṇḍala king—different approaches to the same result. Some practitioners prefer gradual accumulation through various rituals. Others enter directly through the complete maṇḍala. Both reach the same destination, like travelers on different roads converging at the city gate.

The complete purification of aggregates, elements, actions, afflictions, objects, faculties—nothing is left impure because nothing was ever impure. The recognition itself is the purification.

—

[3294-3312]
The five manifest enlightenments: sun and moon as method and wisdom, lotus as the source of manifestation, complete form as the purification of the senses, syllables as the purification of speech, emblem as the purification of mind.

Each enlightenment is not sequential but simultaneous, not acquired but revealed. The aggregates purify into the five Buddhas not through transformation but through recognition of their true nature.

—

[3295-3312]
The definition of mantra: protection from affliction, quick accomplishment of enlightenment. The essence: self-arisen wisdom, clear light, direct realization. These are not new doctrines but the tantric expression of the same emptiness taught in the Middle Way.

The term "tantra" refers to continuity—the continuity of the practitioner's mindstream with the clear light expanse. Not something to achieve but something to recognize.

—

[3298-3312]
The Ratnagotravibhāga's verses echo through the entire section. No saṃsāra, no nirvāṇa, not even emptiness—merely designated by words. This is not nihilism but the highest affirmation: the nature of reality cannot be contained in concepts, cannot be limited by existence or non-existence.

The eightfold non-abiding is the map of this freedom. Cause, distinction, one, many, beyond both, appearance—all released, all open, all the play of primordial wisdom.

—

[3300-3312]
Nāgārjuna as Second Buddha: not because he added to the teaching but because he revealed its depth. The six treatises comment on the three turnings, showing their ultimate meaning. The first turning's four truths, the second's signlessness, the third's definitive meaning—all are emptiness, all are dependent origination, all are the Middle Way.

This is the treasury's heart: not a new teaching but the same teaching seen clearly.

—

[3301-3312]
The Refutation's final word: "You have imposed that imputation." All accusations, all positions, all views—projected by the mind onto emptiness. The Consequentialist stands nowhere, therefore cannot be pushed off any ground.

This is the ultimate protection: not a fortress of views but the open space of viewlessness. Not defensiveness but the absence of anything to defend.

—

[3302-3312]
Upāya's unique position: it combines the ritual purity of Kriyā with the view of Yoga. This makes it a "neutral" vehicle—not inferior to Yoga, not superior to Kriyā, but a bridge for those who need both structure and spaciousness.

The five manifest enlightenments appear here too, but the emphasis is balanced between external ritual and internal meditation.

—

[3305-3312]
Outer and inner tantra: the outer maintains some distinction between practitioner and deity, ritual and realization. The inner dissolves all distinction into spontaneous presence. The outer is preparation; the inner is recognition.

Yet even this distinction dissolves upon examination. All three outer tantras lead to the same realization; they differ only in method and emphasis, not in goal.

—

[3306-3312]
The six collections of reasoning are not philosophical exercises but liberation manuals. Each verse is a key to unlock a particular conceptual prison. The Root Wisdom on dependent origination, the Sixty on reasoning, the Seventy on emptiness, the Fine Analysis on subtle distinctions, the Refutation on objections, the Conventional Establishment on the provisional—together they form a complete toolkit for dissolving all views.

To read them as asserting a position is to miss them entirely. To read them as dissolving positions is to use them correctly.
