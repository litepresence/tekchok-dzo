Detailed analysis. Not for entertainment. For liberation. Form aggregate. The body. The world. All that appears "out there." But where does it appear? This is the question that matters.

The five aggregates: form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness. These are the components of what we call a being. The form aggregate is not just the physical body—it includes the world perceived as external. The eye sees forms. The ear hears sounds. The nose smells. The tongue tastes. The body feels touch. The mind knows phenomena. Six gates. One threshold. What perceives through all six?

The form aggregate arises from elements. Elements arise from mind. Mind arises from—stop. Do not chase the chain backward forever. Recognize the arising itself. The one who chases and the chain being chased—where do they arise? Rest in that question until it dissolves you.

[1742-1750]
A yogi once sat in the cliff caves above Samye for three years analyzing form. He became an expert. He could describe the physics of perception. He could explain optical illusions. On the day he left the retreat cave at Chimphu, he saw a wildflower and wept. All his analysis had not touched the flower's reality. He returned to the retreat cave at Chimphu. This time he did not analyze. He recognized.

[1751-1770]
The form aggregate arises from elements. Elements arise from mind. Mind arises from. stop. Do not chase the chain backward forever. Recognize the arising itself. The one who chases and the chain being chased—where do they arise? Rest in that question until it dissolves you.

The text explains: the faculties arising from form are six: eye faculty sees forms, ear faculty hears sounds, nose faculty smells scents, tongue faculty tastes flavors, body faculty feels touch, mind faculty knows phenomena. Each faculty holds a portion of the elements—earth, water, fire, wind, space. The eye holds coarse earth, sees forms. The ear holds moving wind, hears sounds. The nose holds gathering water, smells scents. The tongue holds ripening fire, tastes flavors. The body holds various portions, feels touch. The mind holds pervading space, knows all phenomena.

The faculties arising from wisdom are also six: faith lifts and clarifies the mind, effort sharpens and focuses the mind on the path, mindfulness holds word and meaning without interruption, concentration manifests emptiness and produces engagement, wisdom engages the meaning of view with discernment, mental peace produces non-conceptual meaning of reality. These are the supports for liberation.

[1771-1776]
Feeling aggregate in detail. Pleasant feeling—attachment arises. Unpleasant feeling—aversion arises. Neutral feeling—ignorance arises. Three poisons. Three doors. But also: three opportunities. When pleasant feeling arises, recognize it as empty. Liberated as attachment. This is Dzogchen.

The feeling aggregate is the immediate experience of sensation. Pleasant, unpleasant, neutral—these three arise from contact. In ordinary experience, pleasant feeling generates desire, unpleasant generates aversion, neutral generates ignorance. But in the practice of liberation, these feelings become doorways. Pleasant feeling arises—recognize its emptiness, and desire liberates itself. Unpleasant feeling arises—recognize its emptiness, and aversion liberates itself. Neutral feeling arises—recognize its emptiness, and ignorance liberates itself. Not through gradual effort. Not through suppression. The feeling arises and liberates in the same moment. Like a bird flying through the sky—no trace. Like writing on water—no mark. This is not metaphor. This is direct instruction.

[1777-1786]
Not through gradual effort. Not through gradual effort. The feeling arises and liberates in the same moment. Like a bird flying through the sky—no trace. Like writing on water—no mark. This is not metaphor. This is direct instruction.

[1787-1806]
Perception aggregate. The six perceptions. Eye perception of form. Ear perception of sound.

Secret ground: the path is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight never leaves the moon. Nose perception of smell. Tongue perception of taste.

After centuries of seeking paths: the ground was never left. Rediscovery of what was always present. Body perception of touch. Mind perception of phenomena. Six gates. One threshold. What perceives through all six?

[1807-1812]
This practitioner once tried to unify the six perceptions. He practiced for years. Finally he laughed. There was never six. There was never one. The number itself was conceptual proliferation. The practice was the obstacle.

[1813-1822]
Between the perception and the perceived, contact occurs. This is the moment of samsara.

 This is also the moment of liberation. The contact itself is empty.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle. The one who contacts is empty. What remains? Vast awareness. Natural clarity. Your own face before your parents were born.

The perception aggregate involves the six consciousnesses engaging with their objects. Form, sound, smell, taste, touch, phenomena—these are the objects. The consciousness is the perceiving factor. But where is the line between perceiver and perceived? The text says: the cognition that is object and not object-possessor knows without duality. That, although appearing as object, is free from all extreme grasping and fixation. The supreme cognition beyond expression that does not appear as object is non-dual wisdom.

Objects are twofold: the object of entities, appearing as substantial things, and the object of emptiness, being the nature of reality. The object of entities includes form, sound, odor, taste, phenomena, touch, the four elements, and all appearances of entering conditions. The object of emptiness is all emptiness, free from all cognition of extreme grasping. The non-objects are those transcending extremes and those transcending view—beyond all conceptual limits, beyond all philosophical positions.

[1823-1852]
Formations aggregate. Fifty-one mental factors. Abhidharma lists them precisely. Cetasikas. This is scholarly material. Useful for clearing confusion. But do not become a scholar of formations. Become free of formations. The list itself is formation. The study is formation. The liberation from formation is also formation. See through the whole game.

The formations include all mental factors: contact, feeling, perception, volition, attention, faith, mindfulness, shame, fear, diligence, equanimity, and many more. They are the fabric of mental experience. The text details: attachments, hatred, delusion—these three root poisons. These divide into twenty-one thousand, one thousand, one thousand aspects respectively, making eighty-four thousand distinct conceptual masses. All of these, although non-existent in reality, are grasped as real—like a mirage, like water in a dream, like confusion itself, arising and grasping a snake where there is only a rope.

[1851-1901]
Between the systematic analysis of the Abhidharma and the stark pointing of direct recognition, Longchenpa weaves the middle way. Not rejecting the aggregates. Not grasping their analysis. The ocean remains whether waves are counted or not. Rest in that recognition. The aggregates neither bind nor liberate. Recognition is liberation.

The worldly vehicle accomplishes temporary happiness through the ten virtues and ethical discipline, achieving results of gods and humans. The transcendent vehicle accomplishes ultimate liberation. The aggregates, elements, and faculties rely upon actions and kleśas. Actions and kleśas are not ultimately real, yet mental activities constantly abide as their display. The incorrect mental activities abide excellently in the purity of mind. The phenomena of mind's self-nature do not abide anywhere at all.

Now the text explains: aggregates, elements, and faculties arise from actions and kleśas. Earth abides in water and wind. Wind abides excellently in space. Space is not contained in wind, water, nor in the earth element. Thus, the aggregates, elements, and faculties rely upon actions and kleśas. Actions and kleśas are not ultimately real, yet mental activities constantly abide as their display. The incorrect mental activities abide excellently in the purity of mind. The phenomena of mind's self-nature do not abide anywhere at all. This is the teaching.

The division is like this: the worldly vehicle has definition, division, purpose, and five results. Its essence is the definite meaning that dwells in the terminology of enumeration, which attains the results of mental investigation of samsara that does not transcend suffering. The definition is engaging and establishing merely the excellence and happiness of the world. There are the two vehicles of fixated views and mistaken philosophical positions. The purpose is accomplishing one's own temporary results of happiness. The result is the method by which one's own result manifests at a certain time through practice.

The fixated vehicle of gods and humans: through accumulating merit and maintaining the ten virtues and ethical discipline, one accomplishes the method for achieving future happiness of gods and humans. Since what is entered becomes a basis for further progress, this is called the fixated vehicle. The mistaken vehicle of philosophical positions is also explained.

The teaching continues: Hold fast to the secret vajra! My vehicle is immeasurable and vast. It gathers all modes of explanation into two: samsara and nirvana—these alone. The meaning has two aspects: the worldly vehicle accomplishing temporary happiness, and the transcendent vehicle accomplishing ultimate liberation.

Before recognition dawned... has traversed these teachings. I have sat in debate, memorized the lists, analyzed the formations. But the real teaching is this: all these elaborate divisions—faculties, aggregates, elements, actions, kleśas—are the play of awareness. They arise from awareness, abide as awareness, dissolve into awareness. The practitioner who understands this does not reject the analysis but does not grasp it either. The ocean remains whether waves are counted or not. Rest in that recognition.

[1853-1863]
Volition. Intention. Attention. Concentration. Energy. Faith. Mindfulness. All formations. All empty. All self-liberated. This is not nihilism. This is recognition. The formations continue to function. Liberation does not mean stopping. It means no longer being bound.

The text explains actions: white actions (virtuous), black actions (non-virtuous), mixed actions. There is merit producing pleasant results, non-merit producing unpleasant results, and immovable actions producing form realm results. The kleśas (afflictions) are six: ignorance grasping confused conceptual basis as real, delusion arising from unrecognized wisdom, hatred arising from generation and becoming, pride arising from view and self-importance, attachment arising from appearance and desire, jealousy arising from unmanifest effects and comparison.

[1864-1873]
Consciousness aggregate. Eight consciousnesses. The five sense consciousnesses. The mind consciousness. The afflicted consciousness. The all-ground consciousness. Vast topic. Endless analysis possible. But where is the analyzer?

[1874-1893]
The all-ground is not something to be destroyed. It is rigpa's own nature when unrecognized. Do not make it an enemy. Recognize it. The storehouse of all tendencies. The latency of all karma. When recognized, it is the display of wisdom. Same basis. Different recognition.

The text says: the aggregates abide by supporting the face of the nature produced by actions and kleśas. Through the support of the all-ground consciousness with its six or seven groups of incorrect conceptions, it abides in the self-arisen wisdom of mind, the thusness, in the completely pure self-nature. Since it does not abide anywhere in particular, it is called self-arisen wisdom beyond location.

The analogy of the snake and rope: when you see a snake, that is conventionally true as deluded perception. When you see the rope, that is ultimately true as wisdom perception. Like a bird dwelling on high, seeing the entire landscape. The nature of the two truths: merely the conventional world of appearances, no inherent relation to the ultimate beyond words. From the expanse of emptiness, all aspects are liberated into their true nature.

[1890-1901]
One without learning... once.

Secret ground: the path is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight never leaves the moon.

[1891-1901]
This practitioner spent years trying to purify the all-ground (kun gzhi). He practiced purification mantras. He did confession. He accumulated merit. All good. All necessary on the path. But the final recognition: the all-ground (kun gzhi) was never impure. The purification itself was all-ground's play.

[1897-1901]
Recognition is immediate. See through the entire analysis. The aggregates are not something to be understood. They are something to be recognized. Form is empty. Feeling is empty.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete. Perception is empty. Formations are empty. Consciousness is empty. The one who sees this emptiness is also empty. Rest in that emptiness. This is the Treasury's heart.
