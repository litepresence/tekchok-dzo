The HUNG syllable—dark blue, vibrating with primordial potency. This is not a symbol to visualize but the actual resonance of awareness recognizing itself. When consciousness leaps from the heart center to the eyes, it carries with it the entire mandala of liberation.

The second HUNG, red, flung outward without conceptual grasping. Like a meteor burning through the atmosphere of dualistic mind, it leaves no trace, no residue, only the clear space of recognition.
