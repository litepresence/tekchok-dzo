Fourth, the extensive explanation of enumerations—from the five: kaya, speech, mind, qualities, enlightened activity. The nature is complete.

Kaya: appearing as whatever form beings believe in, each one's portion, marks and signs complete.

Speech: sixty branches' melodious sound, well-connected.

Mind: knowing how things are and how many, expansive.

Qualities: all dharmas of powers and so forth, knowing perfectly complete.

Enlightened activity: turning the Dharma wheel of five perfections, nature of outer, inner, secret three.

From the Thalgyur:

"Nirmanakaya also: kaya, speech, mind,
Qualities and enlightened activity, five aspects. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Kaya marks and signs,
Whatever trainees arise, body emanation. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Speech word-connection good,
Brahma's expanse sixty branches. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle vast oceanic completion. Never closed. Never opened. Simply what is.

Mind by wisdom of knowables,
Abiding in intention of twofold benefit. Logical analysis: if liberation were gradual, it would be compounded. But recognition is uncompounded. Immediate.

Qualities knowing perfectly complete,
Enlightened activity outer, inner, secret,
All activities perfectly complete,
Abide as five perfections.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Why wait even a moment! The distinction burns in recognition! The maker dissolves NOW!"

This is the complete description of enlightened manifestation—not just form, but speech, mind, qualities, and activity. All five are spontaneously present, naturally complete.
