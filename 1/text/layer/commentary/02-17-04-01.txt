Twenty-one conducts. Twenty-one ways to transcend fixation. Twenty-one skillful
means to cut through the net of conceptual mind. This is not a menu to choose
from—each practitioner finds the conduct that cuts their particular pattern of
grasping.

Bee-like conduct: enjoying all dharmas' taste without preference, like a bee
moving from flower to flower. Not getting stuck on any single experience, not
rejecting any appearance. Every phenomenon offers nectar when recognized.

Deer-like conduct: abandoning delusion's conditioned objects, dwelling alone
where people don't go. The deer is sensitive, alert, aware of danger. The
practitioner stays away from samsara's busyness, not from aversion but from
recognizing what deep practice requires.

Mute-like conduct: abandoning various delusion speech, not speaking with
anyone. Silence cuts the constant chatter that maintains ego. In silence, the
mind settles. In silence, recognition deepens. This is not repression—it is
liberation from the need to validate existence through words.

Peacock-like conduct: cutting secret mantra doubt, transforming poison into
beauty. The peacock eats poisonous snakes and transforms them into brilliant
plumage. The practitioner takes afflictions as path—anger becomes mirror-like
wisdom, desire becomes discriminating wisdom. But this requires stable
recognition. Without it, eating poison just makes you sick.
