[1638-1753] Second, increasing—unchangeable channel-heart light expands the body, great increasing activity. In the great unchangeable channel, body of great increasing activity, five lights expanding five bodies, awareness body expanding expanse, bodies of pristine cognition expanding expanse, light-rays expanding expanse. Thus body and pristine cognition in non-abiding mandala, entering Buddha's path.

[-20405--20393] The channel of unchangeable light expands. The body becomes light. Five lights expand—five Buddha families. Awareness expands into expanse. Pristine cognition expands. Light rays spread. The body and mind enter the mandala of Buddha's path. This is the increasing activity.

[1638-1753] Three words. Increase. Expand. Light. The unchangeable channel—light expands. Body becomes light. Awareness expands. The expansion is not getting bigger—it is recognizing the vastness that was always there.

[1638-1753] Four powers gather in this appearance. Bardo reality's pure appearance gathers four powers: distant-grasping and direct light-luminous two powers gather. Expanse progress pristine cognition four-link power gathers. Bindu measure reaching union mandala appearance power gathers. Wisdom exhaustion spontaneous-accomplishment appearance power gathers.

[-20392--20383] Four powers in the bardo appearance. Distant-grasping and direct light—the two powers. Expanse and pristine cognition—four-link power. Bindu and union—mandala appearance power. Wisdom and exhaustion—spontaneous accomplishment power. Four powers gathering in the bardo.

[1638-1753] From Self-Arising: activity power mandala. Self abiding in conch-shell mandala, four aspects of lamp clear. Awareness expanse by lamp, body pristine cognition power gathers. Bindu empty by lamp, outer element power gathers. Wisdom self-arisen by lamp, self that power gathers. Distant-grasping water lamp by, delusion that power gathers. Awareness concept-free great by, concept affliction power gathers. Unchangeable great Buddha path, bardo appearance power gathers. Thus power mandala, self body complete.

[-20382--20373] Four aspects of the lamp: awareness, bindu, wisdom, distant-grasping. Each gathers power. Each completes the body. The conch-shell mandala—the base of all. The lamp clears. The power gathers. The body completes.

[1638-1753] Four fierceness: awareness resonance mind projects and gathers, realizes assembly, affliction possessing sense-faculty each gate exit arises. Not realizing, samsara itself not revolving produces delusion-appearance. Realizing, power trains, arises-by arises-liberated type without, like water dissolving into water-wave, awareness-top dissolves action.

[-20372--20363] Four fierce activities. Awareness resonance—mind projects and gathers. Realizes assembly—affliction at each sense gate. Not realizing—samsara spins, delusion appears. Realizing—power trains, liberation without effort. Like water dissolving into water. Awareness top dissolves action.

[1638-1753] Voicechenpa): From 10 (Long Self-Arising: fierce Buddha activity. Self to sense-faculty gate, fierce activity mandala abides. Eye sense-faculty not ceasing, object grasping concept explains fierce activity. Consciousness object arises, fierce mandala one—think. Affliction thousand thousand eighty itself, object arises engages, fierce activity shows. Thus activity four aspects, self-self body complete.

[-20362--20353] Three words. Fierce. Activity. Complete. Fierce activity at each sense gate. Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind—six gates. Each gate, fierce activity. Each affliction, fierce display. Four aspects, one completion.

[1638-1753] The four enlightened activities: pacifying, enriching, power, fierce. Pacifying—calms all suffering. Enriching—increases wisdom. Power—accomplishes all tasks. Fierce—destroys all obscurations. Four activities, one purpose: liberation.

[-20352--20343] Four activities of the Buddhas. Pacifying—calms, soothes, brings peace. Enrichingesses—bl, increases, multiplies. Power—accomplishes, completes, perfects. Fierce—cuts, destroys, liberates. The four activities work in the bardo, in this life, in all situations.

[1638-1753] Four activities in four bardos. First bardo—clear light—pacifying activity. Second bardo—dharmata—enriching activity. Third bardo—becoming—power activity. Fourth bardo—birth—fierce activity. Each bardo an opportunity. Each activity a path.

[-20342--20333] The bardos are not after death. They are now. First bardo—clear light—this moment of awareness. Second bardo—dharmata—this moment of knowing. Third bardo—becoming—this moment of appearance. Fourth bardo—birth—this moment of arising. Four opportunities in this moment.

[1638-1753] First, pacifying activity in first bardo of clear light. When ground clear light dawns after death, you see sphere of light like sky at dawn. Recognize this as your own nature—liberated on the spot. Miss it—fall into next bardo.

[-20332--20323] First bardo—clear light. The ground dawns. The sphere appears. The sky at dawn. Recognize and be liberated. Don't recognize and fall. The choice is immediate.

[1638-1753] Second, enriching activity in second bardo. Four wisdoms linked together appear—mirror-like, equality, discriminating, all-accomplishing. Like finding treasure in your own pocket. They're not elsewhere—they're your own nature.

[-20322--20313] Four wisdoms: mirror-like—reflects everything equally. Equality—same toward all. Discriminating—knows distinctions. All-accomplishing—completes everything. Four wisdoms, one awareness. Four activities, one purpose.

[1638-1753] Third, power activity in third bardo. You see eight gates of spontaneous preciousness. Standing before eight doors, all leading to liberation. Power activity means capacity to choose—but only if you recognize.

[-20312--20303] Eight gates—eight freedoms, ten grounds, five paths. All doors lead to the same room. The power is recognizing which door you're at. Don't look for another door. The door you're at is the door.

[1638-1753] Fourth, fierce activity in fourth bardo. Self-appearance liberates itself in primordially pure ground. Nothing to do. No meditation, no practice, no effort. Just recognize and be free.

[-20302--20293] Three words. Fierce. Recognize. Free. The fierce truth: nothing to do. The liberation is not achieved—it is recognized. Not tomorrow, not after death. Now. This moment. The recognition is immediate.

[Final] Four activities—pacifying, enriching, power, fierce. Four bardos—clear light, dharmata, becoming, birth. Four powers gathering in appearance. The channel of unchangeable light expands. Five lights expand into five bodies. Awareness expands into expanse. The body becomes the mandala. The activities accomplish the Buddha's path. From the Self-Arising Tantra—these are not outside. They are your own mind's display. The bardo is this moment. The activities are this recognition. The path is complete. The fruit is certain. The unchangeable channel-heart light expands the body. The great increasing activity unfolds. Five lights become five Buddha bodies. Awareness becomes the expanse of pristine cognition. Light rays spread through the mandala. Body and pristine cognition enter the non-abiding mandala. The Buddha path is entered through this expansion. The four powers gather in the bardo appearance. Distant-grasping and direct light—the first two. Expanse and pristine cognition—the four-link power. Bindu and union—the mandala appearance. Wisdom and exhaustion—spontaneous accomplishment. Four powers gathering, completing the self-body. The conch-shell mandala holds the four aspects of the lamp. Awareness-lamp gathers body-pristine-cognition power. Bindu-lamp gathers outer element power. Wisdom-lamp gathers self-arisen power. Water-lamp gathers delusion power. Concept-free lamp gathers affliction power. The unchangeable great Buddha path through bardo appearance—power mandala complete. Four fierce activities: awareness resonance, assembly realization, sense-gate affliction. Not realizing—samsara spins, delusion appears. Realizing—power trains, liberation without effort. Like water dissolving into water, awareness dissolving action. Four fierce Buddha activities at six sense gates. Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind—each gate fierce activity. Afflictions become thousand thousand eighty manifestations. The fierce activity shows the mandala. Four aspects complete the self-body.

Emaho! The four activities! The four bardos! The four powers!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
