See directly: Consequently. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

This hermit realized: This wanderer. A wandering practitioner... waited for gradual progress. Then a bird called. Immediate. Complete.

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

Regarding chos sku: Dharmakaya is not a body of the Buddha but the body-ness of all phenomena—their empty, luminous nature.

Second, dimension one—rigpa's self-place liberated, like water drawing, basis primordially pure. Non-awareness, like water to fire, becomes confusion's condition. Thus: rigpa and non-awareness, example of water's manner, dependent on conditions.

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Cut through now! See what is. ROAR! IMMEDIATE! Cut through gradualism! NOW! Liberation! AH!

The five winds (rlung) are not physiological energies moving through physical channels. They are the movement of mind itself, the vibration of awareness pretending to be limited, pretending to be located in a body, pretending to be subject to birth and death. When recognition dawns, the winds do not stop moving—they are recognized as the spontaneous play of Dharmakaya, never having moved from the primordial expanse.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Path is ground. Never walked.

Regarding ma rig: Non-recognition does not obscure awareness—it is awareness playing at being obscured.

Look now: Thus established. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

The bhumis (sa) are described as levels to traverse, stages to achieve, but this is skillful means for those who need the motivation of progress. In truth, the first bhumi and the tenth bhumi are not different in nature—both are recognition. The difference is only in the degree of habitual obscuration temporarily suspended. One who recognizes fully in the first instant has traversed all ten bhumis without moving.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

Regarding bag chags: Latencies are not stains on consciousness but habits of not-recognizing, self-liberated when seen.

Fifth, dimension one—the all-ground like a boat, Dharmakaya like an ocean, floating in that state. Dharmakaya's obscuration arises as path or power. Thus: all-ground and Dharmakaya, example of boat on ocean, path arising naturally.

The bardo is not a place between death and birth. It is this very moment of not recognizing the nature of what appears. The moment of death is this moment. The clear light of death is the clear light of this awareness, unobscured by the fixation on a body, on a self, on a world. The terrifying deities of the bardo are your own mind's display, projected outward by the force of habit, recognized as empty when recognition dawns.

Between recognition and non-recognition, the vast middle way opens. The examples are not just poetic—they are precise pointers. The conch and horn share a shape but not essence. Water and bubble share substance but not stability. Gold and brass share color but not value.

Sudden recognition! The framework reveals. It is not that gradual practice is wrong. It is that recognition itself is never gradual. Immediate clarity.

Thogal (thod rgal) is translated as 'leap-over' or 'direct transcendence,' but these words mislead. There is no leap, no transcendence, no one who leaps or transcends. Thogal is the natural display of rigpa recognizing itself, the spontaneous arising of wisdom visions that are not visions of something else but the self-recognition of awareness's own luminosity. The four lamps are not external lights but ways of seeing that have always been present, obscured only by looking elsewhere.

Recognition is not something to achieve but something to stop avoiding.
