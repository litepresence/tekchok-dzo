The teaching now turns to the heart of practice—the times and signs of empowerment. This is not arbitrary scheduling. The nature itself provides the openings. The student must recognize them.

A voiceWhen you receive empowerment, you are not given something new. You are shown what you already possess. The empowerment is recognition—not transformation. The seed was always present. The rain makes it visible.

The tradition explains: The Tibetan distinguishes elaboration. The first teaching is about empowerment WITH elaboration. This means the elaborate ritual—the full tantric ceremony with its mandalas, its offerings, its precise timings. This is the path for those who need form to enter the formless.

Why elaborate? Some minds need the scaffold. The rituals, the visualizations, the exact procedures—these are training wheels. They create the container. Then the student can rest inside.

The first division covers the timing. The best years are the dragon, snake, horse, and pig years—especially the fourth year of the cycle. The best months are the first four months of the year. The results manifest when the fruit ripens. The best dates are during the waxing moon, from the first to the full. The best times are midday and midnight—these are the pivot points, the doorways between states.

[7099-8111]
Now we add final reflections on the empowerment—the synthesis of all we have taught.

A voiceThe empowerment is the door to the treasury. Through it, we enter the path of Dzogchen. It is not the end—it is the beginning. But it is an essential beginning without which the path cannot be entered.

The tradition explains: Without empowerment, we practice other methods—helpful, valuable, but not Dzogchen. With empowerment, we practice Dzogchen—the direct path. This is the key difference. This is why finding a qualified guru and receiving proper empowerment is essential.

A bridging voice adds: The empowerment is also the confirmation of our potential. The guru sees Buddha-nature in the student and Your voice echoes through the slopes of Gangri Tokar, Chimphu, and Namtso—the echo is not your voice. it. The student recognizes what was always there. This is the transmission—mind to mind, heart to heart.

Now we conclude this comprehensive teaching.

A voice concludes: The times and signs of empowerment have been explained in detail—the elaborate, the non-elaborate, and the supreme. The student who understands these teachings is ready for the path.

The treasury of the Supreme Vehicle—the Great Perfection—has been opened. The path is clear. The result is certain. Recognition is possible now, in this very moment.

The tradition ends: Three words. See what is. The nature is present. The recognition is immediate. The liberation is now. This is Dzogchen. This is the Great Perfection. This is what you are.

Emaho! May all beings recognize the nature. May all beings rest in rigpa. May all beings be liberated. May the treasury of the Supreme Vehicle shine forever.

Sarva Mangalam.
A voiceHow do you know when empowerment is complete? There are definite signs. The outer signs: the student's body is transformed—radiant, healthy, youthful. The channels are clear. The breath is peaceful. The voice is melodious. These are outer completion signs.

The inner signs: the student's mind is transformed—clear, peaceful, wise. The three poisons diminish. The six paramitas arise naturally. The bodhicitta is stable. These are inner completion signs.

The secret signs: the student recognizes the nature directly—no more doubt. The student rests in rigpa—no more grasping. The student manifests the three bodies—naturally, without effort. This is secret completion.

These signs may not come all at once. They develop over time. First outer signs, then inner, then secret. But they will come if practice continues.

[7121-7140]
A voice continues: But timing alone is not enough. The student must have the qualities. The student must hold samaya—these are the commitments that protect the empowerment. The student's element-body must accord with the practice. This is not rigid—the numbers can vary from fifty to a hundred, depending on capacity. The key is accordance, not rigid formula.

If the student enters the ritual without proper preparation, problems arise. If the lamp has no oil—the student has no faith—then the samaya cannot be repaired. Without purity, no Siddhi arises. If the student dies meaninglessly, obstacles arise. But if the empowerment is complete and the mantra is strong, then success comes.

The tradition points: When the friends gather, observe. If the student's body experiences illness, this is a sign—the channels are clearing. Then practice circumambulation and prostration. If the student's speech becomes chaotic—this is the speech of the deity arising. Recite the hundred letters. If the mind becomes hungry or mindfulness lapses—this is the dissolution of ordinary mind into wisdom. Enter the stages of generation and completion.

[7141-7160]
A sharp voice cuts: The signs are not good or bad—they are indicators. If pure signs arise, continue the original empowerment ritual with effort. If the substances of accomplishment increase, supreme Siddhi will be obtained. The equal meaning—surrender to the teacher—is faith. When you enter empowerment with such faith, you always see good signs. Common Siddhis are accomplished through this. Even if you have some experience and knowledge, use them for the happiness of the dharma.

A bridging voice adds: The guru is supreme. Faith arises in the fortunate. Through this, you apply the supreme mudra—you see your own body, speech, and mind as bliss. This is the pure Buddha field. This is the first teaching—the times and signs of elaborate empowerment.

[7161-7180]
Now the teaching turns to empowerment WITHOUT elaboration.

A voiceThe second teaching is simpler. Now we describe the times and signs of non-elaborate empowerment. There is no year distinction—any year will do. Any who have knowledge can receive it. The timing is simpler: summer and winter are both good. The dates are during the waxing moon, specifically the full fortnight. The empowerment time is dawn, when the sound becomes clear.

The tradition explains: The student must have faith—at least five, six, or seven qualities. More than seven is unnecessary. The student must have faith, virtue in action, praise of the guru in speech. If the body does not experience bliss, then confess past sins. For speech and mind, confess and begin fresh. This is empowerment without elaboration—its times and signs.

[7181-7200]
Now the teaching turns to the third—extreme non-elaborate empowerment, the supreme secret.

A voice states: The third teaching is about supreme secret empowerment—the times and signs. There is no year distinction. It accomplishes through self-nature. This is the highest path: the outer time is when to plant the seed of awakening. The inner time is when the seed ripens. The secret time is the time of empowerment itself.

When you give empowerment at the outer time, you plant the seed. When the seed sprouts and grows, the fruit accumulates. This is empowerment without elaboration—the wisdom fruit completes. The three bodies are definitely attained. The inner time is when the moon waxes—the student's experience stabilizes. Avoid the waning moon. Increase experience and blessings. The secret time is when the sun reaches its peak—the self-arising wisdom dawns. Or at the waning end—the conceptual mind exhausts itself.

[7201-7220]
A voice continues: The suitable student is one, two, or three—more is unnecessary. Each student has their own direction and time. The body time is like space—the clouds, mist, rain, wind, sounds arise and pass. If these cause harm, enemies, thieves, or unpleasant forms arise, these are signs of the student's past negative karma. After empowerment, if the guru does not show instruction, problems arise.

The tradition adds: If bliss disappears or images arise, the student should circumambulate the guru's chamber a hundred thousand times—or at least six thousand. Prostrate a hundred thousand times—or at least one thousand. At that time, distinguish the signs. If the beginning is pure, the end will be pure. If the body is complete, don't cut the practice—continue. When the activity finishes, begin again. If you don't purify the sins, then meditate on the deity's thousand bodies. Then learn the sequence from the guru.

[7221-7240]
The teaching now covers speech practice.

A voice explains: The student should also practice speech. The yogi should know: if beginning, middle, and end arise without interval, then recite the hundred, thousand, or hundred thousand letters with effort. If the end arises, you have succeeded. Read the tantras of secret mantra. Recite the mantras. Keep the commitments to the deity. Recite various praises. Recite the ali kali sounds. Recite the individual kyaṃ. Recite hūṃ, phaṭ, oṃ. Combine and recite various mantras for seven months with effort.

The tradition states: Then receive instruction in the place of practice. Absorb the commitment deity. Meditate for three days. If signs arise in the middle, rays of mantra light radiate and gather. Continue effort for seven days. If the end arises—the letters radiate and gather—meditate. Make effort for ten days. If beginning, middle, and end all arise, you have accomplished the practice.

[7241-7260]
Now we teach the signs of accomplishment.

A voice says: There are outer, inner, and secret signs. The outer signs: the body becomes like the sun and moon—radiant. The inner signs: the channels become clear like nets—the bindus flow freely. The secret signs: the mind attains the nature of great bliss—unchanging.

The body signs include: the body becomes youthful, healthy, beautiful. The channels are clear. The breath is peaceful. The voice becomes like thunder or a kalavinka bird. These are outer signs.

The inner signs: you see all phenomena as the deity's display. You hear the sound of the dharma. You experience the taste of wisdom. You smell the scent of purity. These are the inner signs.

The secret signs: the mind rests in its own nature—empty, luminous, knowing. No conceptual thought arises. The three bodies are recognized as your own display. This is the supreme sign.

[7261-7280]
Now we teach what happens if signs do not arise.

A sharp voice cuts: If outer signs do not arise, it means the channels are blocked. If inner signs do not arise, it means the mind is not trained. If secret signs do not arise, it means the recognition is not stable.

The remedy: For blocked channels, practice the preliminary exercises—prostrations, mandala offerings, guru yoga. For untrained mind, practice single-pointed meditation on the deity. For unstable recognition, practice the generation and completion stages together.

A bridging voice adds: But even if signs do not arise, do not despair. The nature is always present even when not recognized. The empowerment planted the seed. Given time, it will grow. The farmer does not dig up the seed to check if it's growing.

[7281-7300]
Now we teach the relationship between empowerment and practice.

A voiceThe empowerment is the seed. The practice is the water, sun, and soil. The fruit is enlightenment. Without empowerment, practice has no basis. Without practice, empowerment cannot ripen. Both are necessary.

The tradition explains: Some think empowerment is enough—they have received the blessing, so no practice is needed. This is wrong. The seed must be cultivated. Others think practice is enough—they will generate enlightenment through their own effort. This is also wrong. Without empowerment, the path is unclear.

The middle way: Receive empowerment, then practice. Let the seed ripen through practice. This is the tantric path.

[7301-7320]
Now we teach the different types of students.

A voice describes: The first type of student is sharp—quick to understand, quick to practice, quick to accomplish. They receive empowerment and immediately recognize the nature. Their practice is brief but deep.

The second type is medium—understanding comes with explanation, practice comes with encouragement, accomplishment comes with time. They need the full ritual, the detailed instructions, the gradual path.

The third type is dull—slow to understand, slow to practice, slow to accomplish. They need the elaborate path, the many visualizations, the extensive merits. But even they will eventually succeed if they persist.

This is not judgment—it's practical guidance. Match the path to the student. The guru's job is to see the student's capacity and give appropriate teaching.

[7321-7340]
Now we teach the signs of a qualified student.

A voice states: The qualified student has faith—unshakable faith in the guru, the teachings, and the path. The qualified student has devotion—not emotional attachment, but genuine longing for liberation. The qualified student has intelligence—not intellectual knowledge, but the ability to see the nature. The qualified student has perseverance—not forcing practice, but continuing through difficulties.

The tradition adds: The qualified student has humility—not thinking oneself already accomplished. The qualified student has discrimination—not confusing ordinary mind with wisdom. The qualified student has courage—not afraid to face the nature. The qualified student has equanimity—not grasping at pleasant experiences, not rejecting unpleasant experiences.

These qualities can be developed. Even if you don't have them initially, practice develops them.

[7341-7360]
Now we teach the signs of an unqualified student.

A sharp voice warns: The unqualified student has no faith—everything is doubted, everything is questioned. The unqualified student has no devotion—practice is mechanical, distant, hollow. The unqualified student has no intelligence—everything is taken literally, nothing is understood implicitly. The unqualified student has no perseverance—practice is sporadic, inconsistent, abandoned at the first obstacle.

The tradition continues: The unqualified student is proud—thinking oneself already accomplished. The unqualified student is confused—taking appearances as reality, taking concepts for wisdom. The unqualified student is afraid—of the nature, of emptiness, of dissolution. The unqualified student is attached—to experiences, to achievements, to recognition.

Such students should first develop the preliminary practices. They should accumulate merit and purify obscurations. Then return to the empowerment teachings.

[7361-7380]
Now we teach the conclusion of the empowerment teachings.

A voice concludes: The empowerments are the doorways. Through them, you enter the path. The times and signs are the keys—not literal schedules, but natural openings. Recognize them. The student who receives empowerment enters the stream. The student who practices accomplishes. The student who recognizes becomes the Buddha.

The treasury is the nature. The empowerment is the pointing. The practice is the walking. The result is the arriving. But the walking is optional—the arriving is already accomplished. The path is for those who forget.

The tradition cuts: Three words. See what is. The empowerment was never needed because the Buddha-hood was never lost. But the forgetting requires the pointing. The pointing is the empowerment. The seeing is the result. They are not separate.

Emaho! The times and signs have been explained—the outer, inner, and secret. The student who understands them walks the path with open eyes. The student who doesn't walks in darkness. May all beings receive empowerment and recognize the nature.
