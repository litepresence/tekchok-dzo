[17884-17895]
See directly: The framework reveals. The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

Longchenpa writes these words not to inform but to transform. The distinction between all-ground and Dharmakaya is not academic—it is the difference between sleeping and waking, between mistaking the reflection for the mirror and seeing them as inseparable. What gathers habits cannot be what is free from habits. What recognizes this gathering is itself free, has always been free, needs no liberation.

First, nature: object-subject grasping grasping-born awareness, non-recognition pervader exists. Definition: grasping grasping-born, object-subject thinking, thus called mind.

 Don't philosophize about mind and wisdom—recognize them! The philosopher who analyzes mind for years without recognition is like a man who studies the recipe but never tastes the food. All this classification, all these distinctions—they're medicine for the sick. Once healthy, forget the medicine.

Regarding kun gzhi: The all-ground (kun gzhi) gathers habits like a warehouse stores goods. Dharmakaya is the space of the warehouse—never filled, never empty.

[17896-17915]
This hermit realized: This hermit. From Oddiyana: recognition BLAZES immediately! Not tomorrow! NOW!

The treasury opens by revealing there is no treasury to open. The ground, path, and fruit are three names for one recognition, viewed from the perspective of delusion, the process of clearing delusion, and the recognition that delusion was never other than wisdom. But these are merely pedagogical concessions. From the first, nothing was obscured. Samantabhadra never slept; sentient beings have never been other than Buddha.

Pure mind divisions: mind-nature purity and mind purity. Mind-nature purity: mind-mental factors and entities marks grasping-empty dharmata thusness self-awareness. From Moonholder's Praise: Inexpressible, inthinkable, unutterable prajnaparamita, unborn, unceasing, space nature, self-aware wisdom object, three times' victorious mothers, homage!

[17916-17935]
Mind is latencies—all basis of embodied beings' stain. Grasp object, hold mind—that's samsara's dharma-nature. Jnana is separate from recollection-basis. From Six Expanses: If mind and wisdom's self-essence are not distinguished, like sun obscured by cloud-masses, outer appearance's meaning becomes impossible. Mind is karma, afflictions, latencies—all basis, source, accumulation, arising. Non-awareness is the house, always abiding, opposing wisdom's sun, obscuring.

Lion-faced dakini's fierce cutting: All these distinctions between mind and wisdom—they're distinctions made by mind! Wisdom doesn't distinguish. Wisdom doesn't categorize. Wisdom simply knows. Cut through the analysis! Stop sorting mind into types and wisdom into categories. Recognize what knows the sorting—that is wisdom. What does the sorting—that is mind.

[17936-17960]
Cut through now! See what is. 

What is called the all-ground (kun gzhi) is so named because all phenomena are complete within it—all virtuous and non-virtuous karma, all habitual tendencies, all the seeds of samsara and nirvana. But completeness is not purity. The warehouse contains everything, both treasure and trash. Dharmakaya is not the contents of the warehouse but the space that allows the warehouse to exist, the space that is never contained by what it contains.

Impure mind divisions: briefly shown and extensively explained. First: though expanse impurity doesn't exist, when moving from it, ground-appearance unceased, whatever arises, from non-recognition's play—mind. From mind's ornament—intellect. From intellect—afflictions arise.

Singing yogi's gentle song: The mind gathers habits like a river gathers sediment. Clear water becomes muddy, but the water-ness never changes. The sediment settles when the river rests. The mind's habits settle when recognition dawns. The water was never stained; the mind was never impure.

[17961-17985]
Mountain hermit's teaching: I once asked my teacher, "What is the difference between mind and wisdom?" He pointed to the sky. "See those clouds?" I nodded. "That's mind." Then he waited. The wind blew. The clouds dispersed. "Now what do you see?" "The sky," I said. "That's wisdom." I asked, "Where did the clouds go?" He laughed. "Nowhere. They're still there, just dispersed. Mind and wisdom are like this—never separate, just apparent and clear."

Play is capacity or strength, mere energy arising from that—like seed to sprout, like husk's form reflected in mirror. Ornament is matured degree arising from that, grain portion—like seed to flower, like shell's protrusion.

From Natural Arising: truly ka-dag appearance, non-recognition doesn't exist, mind doesn't exist, intellect doesn't exist, yet from spontaneous presence's strength, non-recognition arises, from non-recognition's play—mind arises, from mind's ornament—intellect arises, from intellect's object—five poisons arise, from five poisons—sixteen afflictions arise, from sixteen—twenty-five arise, from twenty-five—fifty-one arise, from that—eighty-four thousand arise.

[17986-18010]
Essence holder's spacious view: All these numbers—six, sixteen, twenty-five, fifty-one, eighty-four thousand—they're not separate demons to defeat. They're one demon wearing many masks. Remove the mask of non-recognition, and all afflictions are liberated simultaneously. Don't chase each affliction like a hunter chasing different animals. Hunt the root—non-recognition. The rest will fall.

Second, extensive explanation has three: non-recognition root divisions, mind arising divisions, affliction arising extensive explanation.

Non-recognition types: root mind non-recognition, deluded object non-recognition, deluded basis basis non-recognition, grasping concept non-recognition, artificial path non-recognition, not-knowing delusion non-recognition—six non-recognitions arising, not seeing own-appearance.

Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: Six types of non-recognition? That's like saying there are six types of darkness. Darkness is just absence of light. Non-recognition is just absence of recognition. Stop counting types! Turn on the light of recognition and all six vanish together.

[18011-18035]
Sequential order: first rigpa not recognizing self, self-other deluded delusion; appearance object's nature self-essence not knowing delusion; condition-deluded straw-man human deluded delusion; rigpa's essence selfless yet aspect self delusion—"my house" like delusion; path-correction; antidote becoming poison not liberating delusion; naturally luminous meaning not knowing always cycling delusion.

 Every type of non-recognition comes from one source—not recognizing your own face. The six types are just different angles of the same mistake. Fix the root, the branches fix themselves. Practice recognition. Everything else is elaboration.

Second, mind arising divisions: From Natural Arising: mind divisions thus: various gathering water-like mind, clean-uncleanless pig-like mind, brave timid great tiger-like mind, light feather-like mind, moving wind-like mind, greatly intoxicated mud-like mind, sparking spark-like mind, desiring bird-like mind, expanding branches-like mind, difficult to stop actor-like mind, no planet-grasping madman-like mind—eleven.

[18036-18060]
 Eleven types of mind? Eleven types of chains. Heavy chain, light chain, golden chain, iron chain—still chains. Don't study the chains. Break them! Recognition breaks all eleven simultaneously. The prisoner who catalogs his chains is still a prisoner.

These are object-habit various gathering—water; accept-reject deluded—pig; anger-pride coarse—tiger; entering various objects not fixed one—feather; changing unobstructed—wind; desiring objects intoxicated—mud; one to many concepts sparking—spark; accepting objects desiring—bird; awareness strength expanding investigating meaning—branches; object grasping awareness controlled—actor; not grasping object awareness unfocused wandering—madman.

Mountain hermit's observation: I watched a madman by the river for three days. He talked to rocks, commanded the water, proclaimed himself king of the sand. "He's crazy," people said. But I saw—he was free from social constraints, free from approval, free from the need to make sense. The madman-like mind they describe is not pathology. It's freedom from convention. The danger is when convention becomes the only sanity.

[18061-18085]
Third, affliction arising divisions: six root afflictions, sixteen proximate afflictions, subtle-arisen infinite afflictions.

From Sun Moon Union: afflictions are six: non-recognition called basis-deluded concept grasping; delusion—wisdom aspect deluded; anger—development stage deluded; pride—view aspect deluded; desire—appearance aspect deluded; jealousy—not-realized aspect deluded.

One who walked paths... asks: Why six? Why not five or seven? Because these six cover all the ways we try to make solid what is empty, to make separate what is unified, to make permanent what flows. Each affliction is a different flavor of the same mistake—grasping at self and other.

Orderly: object-subject deluded concept aspect delusion; wisdom rigpa opposite mere not-knowing; object anger aspect; "I am" pride; object attachment; meaning not-realized other anger.

[18086-18110]
Second, sixteen proximate afflictions: From Natural Arising: sixteen which? Non-recognition, mind, intellect, grasping, concept, not-knowing, not-seeing, not-realizing, not-understanding, self-impurity grasping, other jealousy, desiring, attachment, pride, scattering.

Singing yogi's gentle wisdom: Sixteen branches from one root. Cut the root, branches wither. Water the root, branches flourish. The root is non-recognition. Everything else is commentary.

Orderly: thusness not-knowing delusion completely afflicted; object mind grasping; subject grasping intellect; both self-grasping; all-pervading concept; meaning non-recognition; abiding mode not-seeing; word meaning not-realizing; general-specific not-understanding; knowing deluded samaya previous mistaken aspect; object self-grasping; other's excellence not-pleasing; accepting object; object attachment; slight pride; object scattering anger.

[18111-18135]
Third, subtle-arisen infinite afflictions: twenty-five, fifty-one, eighty-four thousand.

From root pervading non-recognition not counted separately, pervaded five poisons five divisions—twenty-five.

From Natural Arising: delusion five—greatly dulled delusion, not-knowing delusion, not-seeing delusion, very thick delusion, greatly intoxicated delusion.

Desire five: desire desiring desire, greatly burning desire, life not-seeing desire, anger-accompanied desire, space-traversing desire.

Anger five: desire-great anger, anger-accompanied anger, very coarse anger, delusion-accompanied anger, time's thunderstorm-like anger.

Pride five: suppressing lion-like pride, none-above space-like pride, brave timid tiger-like pride, "I am" weed-like pride, unequal equalizing elephant pride.

Jealousy five: subtle jealousy, self-arisen jealousy, very sharp jealousy.

[18136-18160]
 The numbers are not arbitrary. Twenty-five shows the five poisons each divided into five. Fifty-one shows further elaboration. Eighty-four thousand shows the infinite variety of suffering. But remember—these are pedagogical devices. The actual afflictions are as numerous as moments of not-recognizing. Don't count them. Stop generating them through recognition.

This old hermit's final teaching: I've studied these texts for sixty years. I can recite all eighty-four thousand afflictions. I can explain the twenty-five subdivisions. But what liberated me? Not the knowledge. Not the scholarship. One moment of recognizing my own face. That moment contained all the teachings. All the classifications are just different ways of saying: wake up!

The distinction between mind (sems) and wisdom (ye shes) is the central axis of dzogchen. Mind gathers, classifies, analyzes, wanders. Wisdom recognizes, rests, clarifies, liberates.

The all-ground (kun gzhi) is not the enemy—it's the field where the game plays out. The enemy is non-recognition (ma rig pa), the failure to recognize what knows the all-ground. Once recognized, the all-ground becomes the display of Dharmakaya.

The eleven mind types, six root afflictions, sixteen proximate, twenty-five subtle—all are different costumes worn by non-recognition. Don't fight each costume. Unmask the wearer.

Practice is simple: recognize awareness in every moment. When mind wanders, recognize the wandering. When afflictions arise, recognize their empty nature. When wisdom dawns, don't grasp it.

This is the heart of Longchenpa's teaching. This is the treasury's essence.

 Enough analysis. Enough classification. Sit down. Recognize your nature. Rest there. Everything else is distraction.

The mani wall stands, stones placed by countless hands, each carving representing countless hours of practice. But the wall is just stones. The practice is just recognition. Don't mistake the accumulation for the attainment.

Look. See. Rest.

Complete.



The distinction between mind and wisdom plays out in every moment of practice. When you sit in meditation, notice: the moment you try to "meditate," that's mind. The moment you rest without trying, that's wisdom. The moment you judge your meditation as good or bad, that's mind. The moment you simply notice without judgment, that's wisdom.

 Throughout your day, pause twenty times. In each pause, ask: "What is knowing this moment?" Don't answer with words. Look directly. That looking is wisdom. The one who asks is mind. The knowing itself is wisdom.

Mountain hermit's cave practice: I spent three years just watching the distinction between mind and wisdom. Every thought that arose, I asked: "Is this mind or wisdom?" Eventually, I stopped asking. The distinction dissolved. There was only knowing. That is the true synthesis.



Longchenpa wrote thousands of verses on mind and wisdom. The Prajnaparamita sutras fill libraries. The tantras are countless. But the essence is contained in one moment of recognition. All the classification serves one purpose—to exhaust the mind's tendency to analyze, to classify, to understand. When the mind exhausts itself, wisdom remains.

This is not nihilism. Wisdom is not nothing. Wisdom is luminous clarity, empty yet knowing. It is not inanimate like a stone. It is not dark like ignorance. It is the bright awareness that reads these words right now.

Final metaphor: The mind is like a wave on the ocean. It rises, falls, crashes, subsides. Wisdom is like the water itself—never moving from its water-nature, never becoming anything other than water, even when it appears as wave. The wave doesn't need to become water. It is water already. Mind doesn't need to become wisdom. It is wisdom's display already.

Recognize this, and the eleven mind types are liberated. The six root afflictions are purified. The eighty-four thousand are dissolved. Not by effort. Not by time. By recognition alone.

This is the supreme vehicle. This is the great perfection. This is the treasury of dharmadhatu.

Om ah hum.

The commentary on mind and wisdom is complete. The distinctions are drawn. The synthesis is made. What remains? Your recognition. Your practice. Your liberation.

May all beings recognize their true nature.

May the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle illuminate the path.

May wisdom dawn in all directions.



The teachings on mind and wisdom are not merely for meditation sessions. They apply to every moment. When anger arises in traffic, recognize: this anger is mind. What knows the anger? Wisdom. When desire arises for food, recognition: desire is mind. What knows the desire? Wisdom. When pride arises in accomplishment, see: pride is mind. What knows the pride? Wisdom.

This continuous recognition transforms ordinary life into the path. Every affliction becomes an opportunity for recognition. Every distraction becomes a reminder of the nondual nature. The distinction between meditation and post-meditation dissolves.

 Don't wait for special circumstances. Don't wait for retreat. Practice recognition now, in this moment, while reading these words. That is the instruction. That is the path. That is the result.

The mani wall by the path reminds pilgrims: every stone represents a mantra, every mantra represents a moment of recognition. Build your own wall, moment by moment, recognition by recognition, until the wall becomes unnecessary because recognition has become continuous.

This is the completion of the commentary on mind and wisdom distinctions.
