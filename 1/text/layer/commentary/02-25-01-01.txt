From Pearl Garland, the essence of fruition: liberation itself is primordial. Not
something achieved, not something attained—recognition returning to what was never
left. This is the final secret, the ultimate pointing: ka-dag is not a state to reach but the
nature of whatever appears. Exhaustion of confusion-ground does not mean destruction
of something real—it means seeing through what never existed.
