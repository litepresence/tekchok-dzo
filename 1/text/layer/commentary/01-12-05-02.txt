Water fire block separate, water water saliva eye-water. Earth earth flesh, fat bone marrow bodhicitta. Earth water thig-le, mercury son, rta-rnga knot daughter, eye-corner son ripen. Earth fire heat, vessel object 'phar shib, birth aging disease death. Earth wind strength complexion. All these elements—who binds them? The unbound has no elements.

[15649-15668]
Listen here, dear practitioner! The fire channel-wind causes steaming, and from this ripening come the changes of bodhicitta—contracting, dripping, scattering, drawing. These four create impotence in men, constant numbness, untimely seed emission, and dysfunction with objects. In women, menstrual blood not descending becomes disease, untimely emission, or monthly occasional emission. When the second and third days of the waxing moon see stainless menstrual emission, this benefits male children. When it descends at the fifteenth lunar mandala and so on, this benefits females. When it constantly descends in the waning moon, both male and female children ripen as twins. If menstrual flow is heavy with much blood, or constantly flows on the twenty-second or fifth, no children will arise at all!

[15669-15687]
The earth wind generates faculties and faculty-supports, producing much karma and conception. The wind fire creates awareness-power—light, heavy, blazing, roaring, full, and empty. The wind wind moves breath outside and inside.

 In women when sons and daughters are conceived, it creates eye disease; in men, it creates alcohol disease. The water of wind stops conception and makes non-conception. The earth wind draws and gathers the limbs.

 The fire wind makes affliction-power various. When wind wind and fire mix, they create various wisdom-powers—marvelous example discrimination, skill in dharma word-meaning, skill in cooking for women, and skill in body-speech transformations. The birth order of four elements changes through the actions of summer, winter, autumn, and spring—the element ranks shift, creating disease!

Emaho! See how the elements dance in your very body!

[15688-15724]
Listen, dear practitioner! Feel the heat in your body, understand death's approach, observe the differences in the actions of body, speech, and mind. These are not random occurrences—they follow the deterioration of elements! Look: the elements deteriorate in sequence, reverse, make effort, and change. When moving, they deteriorate; when reversing, they transform; when making effort, they persist; when changing, they evolve. Past time, if long, changes and removes; future time, if long, shifts and transforms. The present, brief as it is, shows through action and counting of change. One youth moves 21,600 winds in a single day—measure this with water-clock and finger-counts! Eight watches in a day, thirty-two periods, sixty-four fingers, sixteen shifts.

 Practice with precision, and the channels open like flowers to the sun!

[15725-15752]
Look here, practitioner! The year has twelve months, and in each the elements play their game. The sun's southern journey brings longer days, the northern return brings longer nights. Six hundred seventy-five winds increase and decrease with each water-clock measure—this is the breath of the world itself! Listen to the numbers: a day has eight watches, thirty-two periods, sixty-four fingers, sixteen shifts. Each shift holds 1,350 winds, each finger 338 and one-half plus eight movements, each watch 2,700 movements. Twelve element actions multiply twelve times twelve—this shows how twelve winds develop and decrease. The White Lotus commentary reveals: when the sun travels south, add and subtract time accordingly. Two water-clock measures change each month as the sun moves.

See the ground. Walking dissolves. When going south, day lengthens and night shortens; when reversed, day shortens and night lengthens. This is not mere calculation—this is the rhythm of your own life-force! The breath moving 675 times with each water-clock measure reveals the secret of longevity and health. Understand these movements, and you understand the deterioration and renewal of the elements within. This knowledge is the physician's wisdom, the yogin's clock, the key to mastering the body's inner winds. Practice with this understanding, and the channels open, the winds flow freely, and the mind settles into natural luminosity. Do not ignore these teachings as mere technical details—they are the very structure of existence itself!

[15750-15768]
Therefore. Thus. The element calculations are not mere arithmetic. They reveal the rhythm of existence. The wind moves 21,600 times per day. The water-clock measures the impermanence of each moment. This is the body's teaching.

This mountain dweller... once tried to count his breaths. He reached one thousand and lost track. Then he laughed—the counting was the breath. The breath was the counting. No separation.

Aware. Present. Complete.

 The calculation points to what cannot be calculated.

 Rest in that.

[15753-15761]
Three hundred sixty days, seven hundred twenty meals calculated! One day twelve times calculated: thousand nine hundred thirty-two and a half conception adventitious change; thousand nine hundred twenty-eight wisdom pure measure moving wind held! Thus five day, five night, two midnight—twelve parts calculated! This day-night equal time calculated! Autumn-spring two equal times certainly hold!

[15753-15768]
Moon itself increase-decrease calculation: moon female and male difference! Moon female six, twenty-nine days not more; male six, thirty complete! One year six days lacking! Thus moon controlled! Autumn-spring two middle day-night equal—remainder half and three extra fraction known! Vinaya also: sojong able-unable calculated! Thus wind calculation certainly obtained—outer year and month connected, day time divided, known! Its object summer-winter-autumn-spring four, moon twelve dawns, that confusion-wheel not reversed, all appearances certainly obtained! Also *Thal-'gyur*: "Day thirteen also, months are one! Thus twelve complete, year is one!"

Do you see? Time itself is wind-play, practitioner! Emaho!

[15764-15768]
Suit general establish, action las explain, change amount certainty. The nature is complete.

Secret completion: the treasury is intimate wisdom itself. Moonlight was never obscured.

[15768-15768]
Therefore. Thus. Precise analysis concludes: The element calculations are tools, not truths. Use them, then set them down. Like a carpenter using a measuring tape—necessary for building, then put away. The house stands without the tape.
