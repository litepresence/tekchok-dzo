[2989-2992]
First: When sound is heard, only sound-holding consciousness arises. As with form and so forth, the holding consciousness does not arise simultaneously. When consciousness enters an object, only that consciousness arises—others do not. Whatever the number of aspects, that many consciousnesses are asserted.

The Mind-Only school establishes their position through sequential analysis. When hearing occurs, the auditory consciousness alone manifests. Visual form-consciousness remains dormant. This sequential arising proves distinct consciousnesses for each object domain.

This old yogi. 

The apparent complexity resolves in simplicity when recognition dawns—before analysis, already complete.

The egg metaphor [2999-3002] is curious—like cracking an egg to find inside and outside are both still egg. Aspects and consciousness, outer and inner—both arise from the same mind-substance. Beginningless habits make them seem two, but self-awareness alone exists.

[3003-3016]
As an egg is split—what a profound image! The shell divides yet the substance remains one. When holding objects now, outer aspect-consciousness and inner-holding consciousness both arise. Through beginningless latent tendencies, they appear dual, yet in self-awareness alone nothing else is established.

The monkey in the fortress [3014-3016]—entering through five apertures, looking and looking. One consciousness knowing through five doors. At the moment of knowing, aspect and consciousness are not different in the nature (rang bzhin) of a single mind. Like dream appearance and dream-holder—both undifferentiated in single sleep-consciousness.

[3009-3016]
Second: The false aspects. The outer meaning aspect appearing mistakenly to consciousness is a false latent tendency—not true to consciousness. The meeting consciousness measures falsity. Experience measures truth—no measurement exists. Both object and consciousness are merely the nature (rang bzhin) of mistaken false appearance.

In this, there is division: the false with stain, the false intermediate, and that which is wished—the stainless, the pure. The Mind-Only school establishes a hierarchy of refinement leading to stainless suchness.

This binding—look closely. Is anything truly holding?.

The Treasury weaves distinctions to reveal what transcends all weaving. Seeing this the Great Perfection.

No process needed. No gradual opening. Immediate access to what was always present.

The false aspects—outer meaning appearing mistakenly to consciousness. False latent tendency! Not true to consciousness! Experience measures truth—no measurement exists! Both object and consciousness are merely mistaken false appearance!

See through it! The stain is not the cloth! The cloud is not the sky!

[3013-3016]
See what is. Rest in recognition. What appears as obstacle is actually the path itself, seen through.

The teaching undermines the one who would understand it; the understander is the final obstacle.

The egg splits—inside, outside—both mind. Beginningless habits make two where there is one. Self-awareness alone. Nothing else established.

[3015-3016]
SUDDEN. Thunder strikes the false! The nature described is not elsewhere—it is this very awareness.

ROAR! Ground itself! Path never walked! Cut through seeking! NOW!

Three divisions: false with stain, false intermediate, pure wished-for. The Mind-Only school catalogues like merchants counting coins. But where is the counter? 

Stainless suchness—beyond their categories!
