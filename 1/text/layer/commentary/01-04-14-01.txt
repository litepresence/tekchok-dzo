[3341-3361]
The basis made clear—mind itself, ultimate truth, free from great elaboration. Distinguished as great through being without effort. Like gold and its color, these two are non-dual. The basis to be accomplished: through accomplishment, mind's marks are realized closely. ground abiding and self-liberation's samadhi distinguishes this.

The path made clear: entering into the body of great yoga through the yoga path of manifestation. The gradual entry liberation path: depending on the stages of birth of the yoga path, entering the great yoga body, desiring self-liberated realization.

The result made clear: ripened mind's result appears variously and liberates variously—called self-arisen primordial wisdom.

[3341-3720]
Sky-dancer's playful wisdom: The Mind Section says mind exists. The Expanse Section says mind is empty. The Instruction Section points directly. Three approaches, one recognition. Three friends describing the same sunset—one mentions colors, one mentions light, one points silently. All correct. All incomplete. The sunset is the sunset.

The six divisions of Mind Section—arising-place, beyond deviation, free from extremes, self-arising, self-established, free from intellect—are six ways of saying: look at your mind. Don't add. Don't subtract. Just look.

[3362-3382]
A simple practitioner... wandered through nine valleys seeking what was never lost. Sixty years chasing teachings—then laughed until tears fell. The ground, path, and result were never three. Gold does not seek its color; water does not search for wetness.

Between effort and ease, we find the Mahāyoga path. Three concentrations—suchness, all-luminous, crystal-clear—are not destinations but descriptions of awareness resting in its own nature. River-like, describing its flow to itself.

[3383-3391]
The tradition desiring accomplishment: body carries Mañjuśrī's maṇḍala; speech makes lotus family Buddha; mind makes Heruka vajra family Buddha; qualities make jewel family Buddha; activities make karma family Buddha. Five families, five wisdoms, one nature displaying.

[3392-3400]
Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation: five Buddha families as five wisdom aspects, five aggregates purified, five elements transmuted. Body as Mañjuśrī's palace—this is not visualization but recognition. The maṇḍala already abides; the deity is your own face before masks.

The path of generation stage creates conditions for recognition. Like preparing a field before planting—necessary, yet the harvest depends on what was always in the seed.

[3401-3440]
The outer container world as celestial palace. Sentient beings as deities. All aggregates, elements, objects, faculties, afflictions purified—dwelling in the maṇḍala. Outer conducts purity and impurity. Inner realizes the indivisible true view. Which is higher? The one cutting through all reference points.

[3415-3420]
Essence holder's spacious view: Atiyoga is not the best vehicle. It is the vehicle that recognizes there was never any vehicle. Not better, not higher, not supreme. Simply direct. Thunder follows lightning, but the sound is not the strike. while others draw maps—the pointing is not superior; it's just more immediate.

The four samayas of Dzogchen—not existing, spontaneous, self-perfect, single—are not commitments to maintain. They are descriptions of what you are. Not existing: you were never a samsaric being. Spontaneous: your nature is effortless. Self-perfect: nothing needs to be added. Single: never separate from the whole.

[3441-3480]
These secret instructions are the heart-essence of all Buddhas. The outer world as celestial palace—not a poetic fancy but the nature of appearance when grasping subsides. Sentient beings as deities—recognition, not transformation.

This wanderer once spent a month in the meditation cave at Drak Yerpa, practicing deity yoga until the rocks themselves seemed alive with light. Then realized: the rocks were never other than light. The practice revealed what was always true.

Stop. Recognize. Continue.

[3481-3520]
From Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra: "The door of entry is the three concentrations. The view: whatever appears, realize as deity. The root samaya: body, speech, mind. The result: means and wisdom, not separate."

The three concentrations—suchness, free from thought, crystal clarity—are not states to achieve. They are descriptions of how awareness rests when not distracted. Like trying to describe the taste of water to someone who has only drunk wine.

[3521-3560]
Between the construct and the natural, we find the three concentrations. Suchness: awareness knowing itself without content. All-luminous: appearances arising as ornaments. Crystal-clear: the lucidity that knows both. These are not sequential stages but simultaneous aspects of one recognition.

The root samaya of body, speech, and mind—honoring these as the three vajras already complete. Not keeping vows but recognizing they were never broken.

[3535-3540]
 Anuyoga's instantaneous entry is not faster than Mahayoga's gradual path. Time is mind's creation. Instantaneous and gradual describe recognition, not clocks. The moment you recognize, eons of practice are complete. The moment you forget, complete practice is lost.

The gradual aspect of Anuyoga—entering expanse progressively—is for those who fear the leap. Learning to swim—first standing in shallow water, then floating, then moving. But the water was always wet. You were always capable.

[3561-3602]
Anuyoga: expanse and primordial wisdom non-dual. Instantaneous with gradual entry. Instantaneous: deities ungenerated, essence recalled through perfection. Gradual: expanse and wisdom entered progressively.

Protecting samaya: honoring the secret mantra teacher, recognizing guru and Buddha as non-different. This is not worship of an external power—it is recognizing your own nature in the teacher's pointing.

[3603-3644]
This old vagabond met a teacher who never spoke a word of Dharma. Just pointed at the sky, then at my heart, then laughed. That pointing was the entire Anuyoga path. Instantaneous recognition of what perfection means.

The gradual aspect: expanse entered progressively—like learning to swim by first feeling water, then floating, then moving. But the water was always wet; the floating was always possible.

The nine views from non-dual equality to without reference point—each one a loosening of grasping, a relaxation into what was never distant. The sphere of meaning as basis, primordial wisdom as path—words You visualize a deity—the image is not the wisdom. what transcends word and meaning.

[3625-3630]
Mountain hermit's cave teaching: The three concentrations of Mahayoga—suchness, all-luminous, crystal-clear—are not sequential stages. They're three windows into the same room. Look through any window; the room is the same. Practice any concentration; the nature is the same.

The generation stage builds the palace; the completion stage recognizes the palace was never built. The deity yoga creates the form; the recognition sees the form was never other than emptiness. This is not double-talk. This is the play of method and wisdom.

[3641-3720]
The six divisions of Mind Section: From dharmatā without change to free from intellect's investigation. All Wind horses printed on cloth—the image rides the breeze, but the breeze is not the horse. one recognition: mind itself is ultimate, free from elaboration.

The text lists vast quantities—hundreds of thousands of ślokas. All point to your own mind, recognizing itself. This is Dzogchen, the summit of all vehicles.

[3645-3674]
Anuyoga holds: becoming Buddha in one birth, in the intermediate state, or through rebirth. Nine views from non-dual equality to without reference point. The sphere of meaning is basis; primordial wisdom is path.

Self-arising primordial wisdom—like water-waves, sky-vapor, ocean-depths, lamp-light. Spontaneous, self-arising, self-liberated.

[3675-3704]
Therefore. Thus. The systematic presentation: three timings for awakening—this life, bardo, next birth. Not pessimism but realism about recognition's stability. Flame-like in wind—some protected, some flicker, some go out. The protection is recognition itself.

The nine views: rungs on a ladder that leads nowhere, for you are already at the top. Yet each rung matters for those who believe themselves at the bottom.

Self-arising wisdom: water cannot help but ripple when disturbed, sky cannot help but hold clouds. The arising is the nature, not the problem.

[3679-3720]
Great Perfection Atiyoga: three sections—Mind, Expanse, Instruction. Mind Section: various minds existing, mind's aspect existing. Yet meaning not established as mind-only.

Lion-like among beasts—self-knowing establishing, surpassing lower vehicles. Self-arisen, self-dissolved. Without meditation object or meditator.

[3685-3690]
Lion-faced dakini's fierce cutting: Enough comparing vehicles! Enough discussing paths! The vehicle that leads to recognition is the right vehicle. The path that ends in realization is the right path. Stop philosophizing about nine vehicles and start recognizing! Mahayoga, Anuyoga, Atiyoga—all words! Recognition is One without learning...is old fool has seen scholars debate which vehicle is supreme while dying without recognition. I've seen simple practitioners of lower vehicles wake up completely. The vehicle doesn't liberate; recognition liberates.

[3690-3720]
Ninth: Great Perfection instruction. In self-arising primordial wisdom, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not established. Four samayas: not existing, spontaneous, self-perfect, single.

From Self-Arisen Awareness: "One perfect, two perfect, all perfect. One arising, two arising, all arising."

[3693-3720]
 The nine vehicles are not rungs on a ladder but medicine for different diseases. The Sravaka path cures belief in self. Pratyekabuddha cures belief in external cause. Cittamatra cures belief in external objects. Madhyamaka cures all conceptual elaboration. Kriya cures impure vision. Upa adds method to emptiness. Yoga reveals pure vision. Mahayoga adds completion stage. Anuyoga perfects instantaneity. Atiyoga reveals what was never hidden.

Don't boast about being Dzogchen practitioners while looking down on lower vehicles. The person who needs antibiotics doesn't sneer at aspirin. The vehicles are skillful means, not hierarchical achievements. Use what you need. Discard when cured.

[3704-3720]
Mind's aspect: direction of appearance. Whatever appears is mind. Six divisions: result-mind's arising-place; beyond deviation; reasoning free from extremes; self-arising without falling; self-established objects; tenets free from intellect.

[3715-3720]
Singing yogi's gentle song: I once met a monk who had practiced Sravaka ethics for forty years. His mind was calm, his conduct pure. I met a Mahayogin who visualized deities until the walls shimmered with light. I met an Atiyogin who laughed at all practice. All three recognized their nature. All three were liberated. The vehicle is the door; the room is the same.

The nine vehicles are like nine rivers flowing to the ocean. Some wind through mountains, some flow straight, some seem to disappear underground. But water is water, and the ocean is the ocean.
