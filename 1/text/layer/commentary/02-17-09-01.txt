[23550-23623] First, mirror image appearing appearance, outer-inner dharmas no difference, true grasping what doing? All illusion image appearance certain, aspiration not distracted, whatever appears illusion image meditate. Especially own form mirror appearing, clothes putting, ornaments giving, those removed outside throwing, praising, unpleasant, etc., doing, that form there appearing but meaning not established like, appearing this self-other, enemy-friend, food-clothes, enjoyment, pleasant-unpleasant, denial-assertion, birth-death, happiness-suffering, illness, whatever arises whatever remembered whatever appears samsara-nirvana dharmas all mirror inside image like, appearing time itself essence none, knowing.

Three words. Mirror. Image. Stop. You see the mirror and think something appears. The mirror is empty. The image is empty. The seeing is empty. Three emptinesses, one recognition.

The mirror is the consort's face—reflecting all, grasping none. The illusion-body is her dance—appearing, transforming, dissolving. When you see all samsara-nirvana as mirror-images, you are the mirror, not the reflected.

 Your own form appears in the mirror. You put on clothes, wear ornaments. You remove them, throw them outside, praise or criticize. The form appears in the mirror but has no established meaning. It appears as self and other, enemy and friend, food and clothes, enjoyment, pleasant and unpleasant, denial and assertion, birth and death, happiness and suffering, illness. Whatever arises, whatever is remembered, whatever appears—all dharmas of samsara and nirvana are like images in the mirror. At the time of appearing, the essence is none. Knowing this is the practice.

Look in the mirror. Your reflection—clothes, ornaments, praise, criticism. None of it is you. None of it is not you. The reflection appears but has no essence. Self-other, enemy-friend—all mirror images. Birth-death, happiness-suffering—all appearing, none established. Know this and rest.

 From Drumsound Sutra: "Mirror mandala completely pure, face image appearing like, how essence not established, Drumsound dharmas know!" And from Samadhi King Sutra: "How night water moons, clear muddy without lake appearing, water moon empty fake essence without, dharmas all thus know! How people many center, magician by forms emanating, horse elephant vehicle various making, to them not true various appearing like, dharmas all thus know!"

The water-moon in the night—clear or muddy, no lake appears, water-moon empty, fake, essence none. All dharmas are like this. The magician creates forms—horses, elephants, vehicles—appearing to others, not truly various. All dharmas are like this.

 Three words. Moon. Water. Stop. You see the moon in water and think it's real. Then you think it's fake. Both are thoughts. The water-moon is the nature of all appearance—clear, ungraspable, beautiful, empty. Stop analyzing. Start recognizing.

 Second, nighttime illusion-body dream training: as before, all appearances dream knowing, appearance existence all illusion dream power-trained, birth-death denial-assertion delusion appearance all illusion dream mastered. In dream also thus arising, attachment sesame-none. From that: "How young girl's dream, man arising dying seeing, arising joy dying not joy like, dharmas all thus know!"

Dream training—treat all appearances as dreams. Train in daytime, master at night. All appearances—birth-death, denial-assertion, delusion—as illusion dreams mastered. In dreams also—arising, attachment none. Young girl dreams, man appears, dying, arising, joy, dying—not joy. All dharmas are like this.

 Thus day-night illusion-body trained, delusion appearance true-grasping none, body also completely hollow, shadow form like appearing but essence none, body shadowless, bardo illusion-body held, doubt none. The illusion-body—mirror's image, water's moon, magician's creation. All appear, none established. Train in daytime, master at night, recognize in bardo.

Daytime training: all appearances as mirror images. Nighttime training: all appearances as dreams. The body becomes hollow, shadow-like, essenceless. Shadowless—bardo illusion-body held. No doubt.

 The illusion-body practice: mirror image appearance, water-moon illusion, magician's creation. All appear, none established. Train in daytime—mirror images. Master at night—dream illusions. Recognize in bardo—illusion-body. The body becomes hollow, shadow-form, essenceless. The practice is complete.

Three words. Hollow. Shadow. Recognize. The body is hollow—empty. The form is shadow—no substance. Recognize this in bardo. The illusion-body is complete.

 First practice—mirror image appearance. All outer-inner dharmas as reflections. Your form in the mirror—clothes, ornaments, praise, criticism—none established. Self-other, enemy-friend, food-clothes, pleasure-pain, birth-death, happiness-suffering—all mirror images. Appearing time essence none. Knowing this is the practice. Second—dream training at night. All appearances as dreams. Train by day, master at night. The body becomes hollow, shadow-like, essenceless. The bardo illusion-body is held. From the Drumsound Sutra—the mirror mandala, pure, face image appearing, essence not established. From the Samadhi King Sutra—water-moon in night, clear or muddy, no lake, empty fake, essence none. Magician creates forms—horses, elephants, vehicles—not truly various. All dharmas are like this. Train the illusion-body—mirror image by day, water-moon at night, magician's creation always. The body becomes hollow, shadow without essence. This is the illusory body of Great Perfection. The mirror reflects without grasping. The water-moon appears without substance. The magician emanates without reality. Train in all three. Recognize in bardo. The liberation is certain.

Emaho! The mirror image! The water-moon! The illusion-body!

What is called delusion is wisdom's play. The treasury is complete.
