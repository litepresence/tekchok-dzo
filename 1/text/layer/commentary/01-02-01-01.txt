[635-640]
Look. Here. Done.
No need for twenty-five. No need for thirteen.
The field is where you are standing.
Stop looking elsewhere.

I walked for years seeking the twenty-five fields. I found them all in a single breath. The field of Thal-ba's Sound—what is it but the sound of your own awareness? Not the buzzing in your ears, but the clarity that hears the buzzing. The southeast, the six transcendent realms—all directions point to here. All distances collapse when you stop measuring.

The field is not a place. The field is this awareness, right now, reading these words. The twenty-five fields are twenty-five ways awareness can recognize itself. But recognition is one—not twenty-five. The fields are like Wind horses printed on cloth—the image rides the breeze, but the breeze is not the horse. at the moon. The moon is your own face. The fingers are not the moon.

The term "field" (zhing) in Tibetan means both "field" in the agricultural sense and "sphere of activity." The Buddha-fields are spheres where Buddha-activity occurs. But this activity is not separate from awareness itself. When you rest in awareness, you are already in all Buddha-fields simultaneously.

[641-652]
The translator sits with the text at dawn, words arriving like birds from the east. Twenty-five stacked fields—he renders them into language that carries the weight but not always the color. The stacked lotus upon which these worlds appear: this is not a cosmology to be visualized but a direct A rainbow appears in sky—the arc is not the sunlight. the layers of your own awareness. From formless to form, from subtle to coarse—these are not places but stages of recognition.

What are these Thal-ba fields? Thal-ba means "dust," "powder," "ashes." Why name pure lands after dust? Because even the purest appearance is dust compared to the nature that knows it. The field of Thal-ba's Sound—sound is vibration, vibration is movement, movement is the play of awareness. Not moving to somewhere. Just the natural dynamism of what is never still because it was never born.

The Tibetan word thal ba can mean "dust," "(powder), or (ashes). The pure fields are called "dust" because even the most refined phenomena are still appearances—still "dust" compared to the emptiness that knows them. This is not disparagement but pointing: the fields are not the goal—they are the path. The goal is the nature that knows the fields, which is beyond all fields.

[653-666]
The Lotus-Born stands on the Tibetan plateau, lotus-born himself, concealing treasures in rock and mind. The fields he describes are not Indian imports—they are the mountains and valleys of his new home, transformed through vision. Twenty-five stacked, each with its own gods and goddesses, its own rain and wind. He sees them simultaneously: the field of luminous clarity, the field of Brahma's drum-sound, this very Sahā world with its dust and yak dung. All are the play of the mandala. All are spontaneously accomplished.

The thirteen stacked above, Jewel Thal-ba—rin chen thal ba—what jewel? The jewel of awareness, more precious than any material gem because it is the source of all value. Adorned with auspicious suns, desirable qualities, miraculous letters—these are not decorations added to something plain. They are the natural radiance when radiance is not obscured. The lotus eyes of lda-ldi—lda-ldi is the plant that grows in pure lands, its eyes always open, never blinking, like awareness that never sleeps.

When I concealed terma in the mountains of Tibet, I was not hiding treasure—I was hiding awareness. The rocks are not containers—the mountains themselves are the mandala. The treasures are not objects—they are the recognition of one's own nature. When you find terma, you find yourself. The hidden lands are not hidden from you—they are you.

The twenty-five fields correspond to the twenty-five aspects of the ground (gzhi). Each field has its own Buddha (rin po che), its own lotus (padma), its own vajra (rdo rje). These are not external entities but internal qualities. The Buddha in the field is the awakened quality of awareness. The lotus is the purity of that awareness. The vajra is its indestructible nature.

[667-680]
Therefore we establish: the twenty-five are not sequential but simultaneous. The enumeration serves pedagogical purposes, not ontological ones. Like counting the colors of a rainbow—seven or five or ten depending on your culture—the number matters less than the recognition that light itself is uncountable. The architecture reveals the structure of perception, not the structure of reality. Reality has no structure.

The WHAT ARE YOU COUNTING? The twenty-five fields are twenty-five ways awareness can recognize itself. The Taming Thal-ba in the west-north—'dul ba, taming, subduing. What is being tamed? The wildness of conceptual mind. The field appears as sixteen-year-old beauty surrounded by the extremely young—not because Buddhas prefer youth, but because this represents freshness, newness, the not-yet-corrupted. The Dung-ldan Thal-ba below at the ninth world—dung means "conch," the sound that carries. Even in the lower realms, the sound of Dharma resounds. Are you listening?

The twenty-five fields are one field. The one field is zero fields. The zero field is awareness. When you rest in awareness, the counting stops. The fields remain, but you no longer grasp them as "fields." They are simply the play of awareness, like waves on the ocean. The waves are many; the ocean is one. But actually, waves are water. Fields are awareness. Recognition dissolves the distinction.

[681-694]
The wanderer laughs at all this counting. Twenty-five? Fifty? A thousand? He sits in his cave and the retreat cave at Chimphu is all fields. The wind through the crack is the sound of Thal-ba. The drip of water is the teaching of dependent arising. He needs no lotus throne, no stacked arrangement. Three words, three gestures. The world is complete. Your confusion is complete. Stop trying to improve it.

Star Thal-ba—skar ma'i thal ba—stars scattered like dust across the sky. The wheel stacked by five and nine—what five? The five elements, the five wisdoms, the five perfections. What nine? The nine vehicles, the nine stages, the nine ways of saying what cannot be said. Dawn's water-spouts adorning the field—not decoration, but the natural display of clarity. Thunder, lightning, red tongues—the speech of awareness when it is not filtered through concept.

I sat in my cave for forty years. Did I see the fields? the crystal cave was the field. The walls were the mandala. The darkness was the emptiness. The cold was the clarity. I needed nothing external. The fields are not somewhere else—they are here, now, in this very place. The only question is whether you recognize them.

The nine stacked wheels correspond to the nine vehicles. But in Dzogchen, all nine vehicles are included in the one vehicle of direct recognition. The five stacked wheels correspond to the five elements, the five wisdoms, the five Buddha families. All are aspects of the one awareness.

[695-708]
The Lion-Faced roars from beyond form. WHAT ARE YOU SEEKING IN THESE STACKED WORLDS? Each field is a prison if you think it is somewhere else. Each description is a chain if you cling to it. See the nature (rang bzhin) of what binds.

Between journey and destination, the ground includes both. Never departed from. Spacious presence. The twenty-five are one. The one is zero. The zero is YOU—still searching, still counting, still hoping the next field will be better than this one. IT WILL NOT. This field is on fire. See your own nature before the next breath.

The field you seek is where you are standing. The awareness reading these words—that is the field. Not the content of the words. Not the understanding of the words. The awareness that knows the understanding. That is the field. That is the Buddha. That is the answer. Now stop reading and recognize.

The twenty-five fields are the twenty-five ways the heart opens. First, the field of generosity—giving without expectation. Second, the field of discipline—protecting without grasping. Third, the field of patience—receiving without resistance. Fourth, the field of diligence—continuing without cessation. Fifth, the field of meditation—resting without effort. These five multiplied by five families equals twenty-five ways awareness expresses its natural generosity.

[709-722]
An old practitioner once spent a summer counting the stars visible from a high mountain pass. Each night he added more to his tally. By autumn he had counted thousands, yet the sky remained unchanged. He finally understood: the counting was the practice, but the recognition was the point. The twenty-five fields are like those stars—countable, yet Body touches ground—gesture is not the surrender. the infinite.

Now we turn to Sahā, this world we call home. From the immeasurable fields, we focus on this one—not because it is special, but because we are here. The external elements: wind, space, water, earth. The internal realms: formless, form, desire. This is not cosmology as geography. It is cosmology as psychology, as physiology, as the description of how experience arises from what has no origin.

The world is made of the four elements—wind (rlung), space (nam mkha'), water (chu), and earth (sa). These are not physical elements but experiential qualities. Wind is the movement of experience. Space is the openness of experience. Water is the flow of experience. Earth is the stability of experience. Together, they compose the world you experience.

When I was young, I thought the world was solid. Then I saw it change. When I was older, I thought the world was illusion. Then I saw it clearly. Now I understand: the world is neither solid nor illusion—it is the display of awareness. The elements are not "out there"—they are the texture of your experience. The wind is the movement of your thoughts. The space is the openness of your mind. The water is the feeling of your heart. The earth is the ground of your being.

Between the vast fields of the pure lands and the chaos of this Sahā world, there is no difference—except in the eye of the beholder. The pure lands appear pure because the beholder is pure. The Sahā world appears impure because the beholder is confused. When the confusion clears, the Sahā world becomes the pure land. The elements remain the same; the perception changes.

[723-736]
The wind arises first—not as cause, but as the first discernible movement in the unmoving. Space's dhātu, connected, associated—these words try to describe what cannot be described. Water supported by wind—not physical water, but the liquidity of experience, the flow that has no solid ground. Earth above water—not material earth, but the apparent stability that allows us to think we stand on something.

Four immeasurables plus one hundred thousand—not numbers to memorize, but pointers to the vastness that exceeds measurement. The four directions are immeasurable because they have no end. The hundred thousand is a conventional count for what is countless. One-fourth empty—the space between worlds, the gap between thoughts, the recognition that even fullness requires emptiness to be full.

The four immeasurables (tshad med pa bzhi) are love (byams pa), compassion (snying rto), joy (dga' ba), and equanimity (btang snyoms). These are called "immeasurable" because their objects are all sentient beings, and the number of sentient beings is beyond measurement. But more fundamentally, they are immeasurable because they arise from the nature of awareness, which is itself boundless.

The four immeasurables are not four things—they are one quality seen from four angles. Love is the wish for beings to have happiness. Compassion is the wish for beings to be free from suffering. Joy is the happiness that arises from seeing beings on the path. Equanimity is the balance that sees all beings equally. But actually, these four are the natural expression of recognizing one's own nature. When you see clearly, love arises naturally. When you see suffering, compassion arises. When you see the path, joy arises. When you see the nature, equanimity arises.

[737-750]
Continents arranged, Mount Meru, wishing-tree, jewels, sun and moon deities—this is the classical Buddhist cosmos, familiar to any scholar of Abhidharma. But do not mistake description for prescription. The continents are not places to travel. Meru is not a peak to climb. The wishing-tree is not an object to possess. They are the structure of perception itself, the way awareness organizes experience into coherent worlds.

The seven jewels surrounding—why seven? The seven branches of enlightenment, the seven treasures of a universal monarch, the seven aspects of recognition. Mountain ranges and water ranges—the solid and fluid aspects of experience, neither superior, neither primary. The three realms depending on these elements—depending not as a house depends on a foundation, but as a dream depends on the dreamer, which is to say, not really at all.

The seven jewels (rin po che sna bdun) are: gold (gser), silver (dngul), copper (zangs), turquoise (g.yu), crystal (shel), coral (byu ru), and pearl ('dzems). These represent the qualities of a universal monarch (cakravartin). But in Dzogchen, they represent the natural qualities of awareness—richness, clarity, purity, warmth, openness, radiance, and perfection. The mountains and waters represent the solid and fluid aspects of phenomena.

I once tried to find Mount Meru on a map. I looked for years. Finally, I realized: the map was Gangri Tokar. The search was Meru. The seeker was the sought. Now when I see a mountain, I see Meru. When I see a river, I see the four great rivers. The cosmos is not somewhere else—it is here, in this very perception.

[751-764]
From the formless realm, slight consciousness arises—not consciousness as opposed to matter, but the knowing quality that precedes the duality of subject and object. From this, the form realm, luminosity, the clear light that is not light as opposed to dark. From this, the desire realm, at a distance—not distant in space, but distant from recognition, obscured by the very appearance that is meant to reveal.

The pure abodes descending like drops—this is not a fall from grace. It is the compassionate descent of wisdom into whatever conditions require it. Akanistha at the top—not above in space, but above in clarity, in proximity to recognition. The gods, asuras, humans—different modes of the same awareness, like different frequencies of the same radio, all playing variations on the theme of not-recognizing.

The three realms—formless (gzugs med), form (gzugs), and desire ('dod)—are not places but states. The formless realm is the realm of infinite space, infinite consciousness, and nothingness. These are not emptiness as in voidness—they are subtle states of concentration. The form realm is the realm of radiant deities, bodies, and clear light subtle. The desire realm is the realm of ordinary beings, attachment, and grasping.

The three realms are one realm. The formless is awareness without object. The form is awareness with subtle object. The desire is awareness with gross object. But actually, there is only awareness. The three realms are like ice, water, and steam—all H2O, all the same substance in different states. Recognition is recognizing the ice as water, the water as steam, all as the one substance.

[765-780]
Three words that encompass all twenty-five fields: recognition itself. The fields do not exist apart from the one who recognizes them. The one who recognizes does not exist apart from the recognition. Stop counting worlds and recognize the world-stopper. Enough.

The first humans of the Fortunate Aeon—form and beauty, marks and characteristics, body pervaded by own-light radiance. This is not golden-age nostalgia. It is a description of awareness when it is not obscured by fixation on form. Eighty thousand years—not duration, but capacity. The lifespan is long because there is no hurry, no grasping, no fear of ending. Merit-food—not reward for good deeds, but the natural nourishment that comes from alignment with the nature.

[781-792]
Then the fall—not a historical event, but the inevitable consequence of not-recognizing. Two causes of delusion arise—what two? The appearance of other, and the grasping at self that follows. Gradually coarse—the natural process by which subtle experience congeals into gross fixation. Faculties develop—sense doors open—not as evolution, but as the beginning of the narrowing that will take lifetimes to reverse.

Earth-oil, rice, coarse food—the progression from subtle to gross nourishment mirrors the progression from subtle to gross experience. As recognition fades, more substantial supports are needed. As clarity dims, more intense stimulation is sought. This is not a fall from perfection into corruption. It is the natural display of what happens when display is not recognized as display.

The descent follows the twelve links of dependent origination (rten cing 'brel bar 'byung ba). From ignorance (ma rig pa) come formations ('du byed). From formations comes consciousness (rnam par shes pa). From consciousness come name-and-form (ming dang gzugs). From name-and-form come the six sense fields (skye mched drug). From the six sense fields comes contact (reg pa). From contact comes feeling (tshor ba). From feeling comes craving (sred pa). From craving comes grasping (len pa). From grasping comes becoming (srid pa). From becoming comes birth (skye ba). From birth comes old age and death (rga shi).

The Lion-Faced cuts: The descent is not a tragedy—it is a display. The ascent is not a triumph—it is a display. The entire cycle of samsara and nirvana is awareness displaying itself. When awareness forgets itself, it appears as samsara. When it remembers, it appears as nirvana. But actually, there is only awareness. The play continues. The question is: do you recognize it?

[793-806]
Now the seed-syllables—the triangular E, the sound A-UM. These are not magical formulae. They are sonic diagrams of the structure of experience. E, triangular, representing the source-mandala, the ground from which all manifestation arises. A-UM, the beginning and end of the alphabet, representing the pervading wind, the dynamic energy that stirs the ground into display.

The seven winds—spreading-stopping, bellows-making, encompassing, swirling, pervading, great-cloud, benefit-rain—are not meteorological phenomena. They are the seven stages of how the unmanifest becomes manifest, how the empty becomes full, how the nature displays without ever leaving its nature. Mouse-striped breath—the first stirring, so subtle it is almost imperceptible. Clouds gathering—the second stage, potential coalescing. Rain falling—the final stage, manifestation fully apparent.

E and A-UM. Two sounds. The beginning and the end. But actually, no beginning, no end. The triangle has no corners. The sound has no source. The display has no origin. This is what the syllables point to: the nature that cannot be named, the awareness that cannot be grasped, the ground that cannot be found because it is always already here.

[807-820]
From the winds, water. From the water, earth. This is not physics. It is the description of how solidity arises from fluidity, how the apparent stability of experience is built on the flow that has no ground. The golden disk, five thousand leagues—gold representing the precious nature, five thousand representing the immeasurable. Meru arising in the center—not a mountain, but the central channel, the axis of recognition around which experience revolves.

The seven gold mountains, four continents—these are not geography. They are topology. The seven mountains are the seven stages of practice, the seven factors of enlightenment, the seven ways awareness can recognize itself. The four continents are the four directions of perception, the four modes of engagement with phenomena. Jambudvīpa in the south—not because south is special, but because we are here, in the land of the rose-apple, the place where practice is possible because suffering is present.

The wish-fulfilling tree, the wish-fulfilling cow, the unplowed harvest—these are not objects of desire. They are symbols of spontaneous accomplishment. When the nature is recognized, everything is wish-fulfilling because there is no longer a wisher separate from what is wished. The tree grows without being planted. The cow gives without being milked. The harvest comes without being sown. This is not magic. It is the natural state.

The wish-fulfilling tree (dpag bsam gyi shing) and cow (dpag bsam) are symbols from the Indian tradition. The tree provides all desires; the cow gives all nourishment. In Dzogchen, these represent the infinite potential of the nature—when recognized, all needs are met, all wishes fulfilled, not by external objects but by the inexhaustible display of awareness itself.

[821-834]
The sun and moon—right and left channels, day and night, the alternating rhythm of experience. They are not external bodies. They are the natural luminosity and reflective capacity of awareness itself. Brahma's abode at the top—not because Brahma is supreme, but because this represents the highest form realm, the closest approach to formless recognition while still in form.

The three realms stack vertically only in diagrams. In experience, they interpenetrate. The desire realm is present in every moment of grasping. The form realm is present in every moment of clarity. The formless realm is present in every moment of openness. You do not climb from one to the next. You recognize that all three are present simultaneously, and the recognition itself is liberation from all three.

The inhabitants of the realms—gods enjoying, asuras fighting, humans practicing, animals instincting, pretas craving, hell-beings suffering—are not different species in different locations. They are different states of the same mind, available in every moment. When you grasp at pleasure, you are a god. When you compete, you are an asura. When you seek meaning, you are human. When you react without reflection, you are animal. When you hunger for what you cannot have, you are preta. When you are consumed by pain, you are in hell. All of these are possible in this very moment. Which one are you now?

[835-844]
The four continents of Jambudvīpa—our world with its three companions. Pūrvavideha to the east, body superior, because in the morning of recognition, the body is fresh. Aparagodānīya to the west, cattle-using, because in the evening of experience, we rely on supports. Uttarakuru to the north, superior enjoyments, because in the north of completion, all needs are spontaneously met. And Jambudvīpa here, thinkers with courage, because only here, in the midst of suffering, is there motivation to seek the nature.

The degeneration of the Fortunate Aeon—from eighty thousand years to one hundred. This is not cosmology as history. It is the description of how attention span shortens as fixation increases, how capacity diminishes as complexity grows. The five degenerations—life, view, affliction, being, time—are present now, in this very era. Short lives, wrong views, strong emotions, weak faculties, natural disasters. We are living in the degenerate age. This is not pessimism. It is the perfect condition for practice, because urgency is present.

The Wanderer laughs: The degenerate age is the best age. In the golden age, who seeks? Who practices? When everything is perfect, why strive? But in this age of suffering, of confusion, of short lives and strong emotions—here, practice becomes urgent. Here, recognition becomes precious. The degenerate age is the age of opportunity. The worse things are, the better the practice becomes.

The five degenerations (nyes pa lnga) are: shortened lifespan (tshe ring), wrong views (Ita ba ngan), declined virtue (yon tan dog), defiled beings (gang zag ngan), and degenerated time (dus ngan). These are not predictions of doom—they are descriptions of the conditions that make practice urgent. In the degenerate age, the teachings become rare, making them more precious. The urgency of death makes practice more immediate.

[845-858]
But even in degeneration, the cycle continues. After reaching the nadir, the reversal begins. Lifespan gradually increases as virtue accumulates. Eventually, Maitreya will appear—not in the future as a distant hope, but as the recognition that compassion is always possible, that the future Buddha is the present capacity for kindness. The cyclical cosmology is not a prediction. It is a description of how recognition deepens and fades, how practice strengthens and weakens, how the Dharma flourishes and declines, only to flourish again.

The twenty-five stacked lotus, the pure fields, Sahā world with its Meru and continents—all of it is display. All of it is the play of awareness showing itself to itself. Do not seek these realms in space. Do not hope for rebirth in better locations. Recognize that every location is awareness-location. Every field is awareness-field. Every world is awareness-world. The only question is whether you recognize this or not.

[859-877]
What was spoken here is the unspeakable nature. The words are offered; the recognition is yours. The treasury is complete.

Emaho! The cosmology is your own body. The directions are your own perceptions. The elements are your own experience. Mount Meru is your own central channel. The pure lands are your own moments of clarity. Stop looking elsewhere. The field you seek is exactly where you are standing. The twenty-five are not somewhere else. They are twenty-five ways of describing this very moment, this very awareness, this very recognition—or lack thereof.

May all beings recognize the pure field in every perception.
