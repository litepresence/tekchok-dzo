[8083] <prose> Samsara cycles namelessly in delusion; yet the distinctive excellence of this life-force bringing liberation through light is exceptional.
[8084] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[8085] <prose><tantra> Since this reveals the natural realm,
[8086] <prose><tantra> Without entering the circle of conditions,
[8087] <prose><tantra> As primordial purity and spontaneous presence, || 10 ||
[8088] <prose><tantra> From the sphere of objects and consciousness,
[8089] <prose><tantra> Liberated at the very basis of each distinct essence.
[8090] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8091] <prose> Yet if one asks what difference exists between liberation through Trekchö and not reaching the full measure of appearance while being liberated from the aggregates,
[8092] <prose> there is a vast distinction.
[8093] <prose> Through Trekchö one is liberated, yet from atomic particles without remainder,
[8094] <prose> transformation into light is impossible. || 20 ||
[8095] <prose> Without going into light, the vajra body is not established;
[8096] <prose> through the temporary illusory body, the final result is not traversed.
[8097] <prose> Without obtaining the body of light, the great transference body is not attained,
[8098] <prose> and therefore the great benefit for others through that support is not accomplished.
[8099] <prose> Thus from the aspect of entering light and atomic particles,
[8100] <prose> the great transference cannot perform benefit, while the eye of wisdom and clairvoyance, || 30 ||
[8101] <prose> the accomplishment of miraculous powers—there exists distinction of magnitude.
[8102] <list> Second:
[8103] <prose> Although rigpa is spoken of as luminosity from the beginning, through Trekchö's estimation of emptiness, its own light is not seen.
[8104] <prose> Through Thögal's application of crucial points, when dharmatā's essence-luminosity is internally captured,
[8105] <prose> the individual's own-resonance luminosity appears externally as practical display—this is superior.
[8106] <prose><tantra> From the Rangshar:
[8107] <prose><tantra> This King of Rigpa, self-appearance, || 40 ||
[8108] <prose><tantra> Exists in all yet is unrecognized.
[8109] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8110] <list> Third:
[8111] <prose> The pristine wisdom of rigpa not seen in Trekchö, covered by expansion, determined as only one without seeing—
[8112] <prose> in Thögal, through the opening of pristine wisdom's vision, dharmatā's sun-rays appearing clear:
[8113] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[8114] <prose><tantra> Through dharmatā's direct appearance,
[8115] <prose><tantra> The view of intellectual grasping is consumed. || 50 ||
[8116] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8117] <list> Fourth:
[8118] <prose> In Trekchö, relying upon coarse nāḍī and prāṇa,
[8119] <prose> in Thögal, capturing the pure light-nāḍī and actualizing the four lamps on the Path—
[8120] <prose><tantra> From that very source:
[8121] <prose><tantra> Moreover through nāḍī and illusory wheel,
[8122] <prose><tantra> The five wisdoms of natural appearance,
[8123] <prose><tantra> Are seen by the water-bubble eye. || 60 ||
[8124] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8125] <list> Fifth:
[8126] <prose> In Trekchö, seeking clarity through the six sense-doors not purified, through the mind's phenomena; in Thögal, through the pure luminosity-door opened by wisdom-prāṇa, the four lamps' appearance dawns—this is superior.
[8127] <prose><tantra> From that very source:
[8128] <prose><tantra> However it arises from the door,
[8129] <prose><tantra> Through entering-prāṇa's force,
[8130] <prose><tantra> From the four lamps, four activities arise. || 70 ||
[8131] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8132] <list> Sixth:
[8133] <prose> In Trekchö, seeking clarity through the door of rigpa's self-clarity without seeing;
[8134] <prose> in Thögal, through the wisdom-door of external-internal spontaneous presence,
[8135] <prose> the appearance of dharmadhātu and wisdom without separation or dispersion is directly examined—this distinctive excellence is superior.
[8136] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[8137] <prose><tantra> To the pure dharmadhātu lamp,
[8138] <prose><tantra> Bindus, bodies, and illusory appearances,
[8139] <prose><tantra> Natural expression and essence-nature,
[8140] <prose><tantra> Non-dual without separation or dispersion, appear. || 80 ||
[8141] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8142] <list> Seventh:
[8143] <prose> In Trekchö, having caused external objects and internal mind's delusion to appear, through resting in the state without rejection or acceptance, those are not quickly liberated.
[8144] <prose> In Thögal, from the moment of applying crucial points,
[8145] <prose> external-internal illusory appearances together with deluded apprehension are self-liberated;
[8146] <prose> not depending upon purification resting in the state without abandoning,
[8147] <prose> wisdom's increasing appearance waxes like the moon's waxing fortnight,
[8148] <prose> the four appearances reaching full measure and quickly liberated.
[8149] <prose><tantra> From that source:
[8150] <prose><tantra> The manner of appearance is not delusion,
[8151] <prose><tantra> In the nature of pure causal conditions,
[8152] <prose><tantra> Entities and non-entities self-purified, || 90 ||
[8153] <prose><tantra> The five doors' object-grasping purified,
[8154] <prose><tantra> The coarse elements purified,
[8155] <prose><tantra> Pristine wisdom purified, increasing appearance shown,
[8156] <prose><tantra> From that, exhausted dharmatā.
[8157] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8158] <prose> Although these distinctions, analyzed in detail, are inconceivable,
[8159] <prose> I speak merely a brief outline.
[8160] <prose> In summary: through directly seeing rigpa's actual meaning and its visible presence,
[8161] <prose> delusion reverses in a single moment; through the body of investigation,
[8162] <prose> having made delusory appearance the Path, seeking the result of non-delusion—through this distinctive excellence, those possessing the eye of wisdom should understand. || 100 ||
[8163] <prose> Since this Dharma possesses such crucial points, it is called the supreme pinnacle of all.
[8164] <list> Second: The presentation of Thögal possessing distinctive excellence has three parts:
[8165] <list> The general presentation of the three crucial points of dharmatā's wheel;
[8166] <list> The detailed explanation of the day-night luminosity wheel's manner of engagement;
[8167] <list> The extensive presentation of the vast expanse wisdom wheel.
[8168] <list> First has four parts:
[8169] <list> The body's three crucial points of posture;
[8170] <list> The door's three crucial points of gaze;
[8171] <list> The dharmadhātu's three crucial points of guidance;
[8172] <list> The object's three crucial points of appearance. || 110 ||
[8173] <list> First:
[8174] <prose> Whichever of the body's three postures one assumes,
[8175] <prose> there is purpose in resting the nāḍī-prāṇa in ease with relaxed abdomen;
[8176] <prose> if deliberately constrained, prāṇa and so forth become inverted and scattered, causing nāḍī constriction and excessive tension.
[8177] <prose> Therefore, together with the gaze, this distinctive Dharma of crucial points—drawing out slowly through the mouth from prāṇa dwelling extremely gently—is most important.
[8178] <prose> This, the common manner of exhaling and inhaling through the nose, filling the four wheels internally, generating clarity-luminosity samādhi,
[8179] <prose> in that manner: inverted prāṇa,
[8180] <prose> scattered prāṇa,
[8181] <prose> whirling prāṇa, || 120 ||
[8182] <prose> the four obscurations of sluggishness arising, various delusory appearances not dawning.
[8183] <prose> Here, purification of prāṇa does not increase the Path,
[8184] <prose> yet filling with the four wheels internally, although discursive thought's expansion is momentarily stopped, it cannot ultimately be stopped;
[8185] <prose> therefore, karmic prāṇa self-ceases and is released through the mouth.
[8186] <prose> Through the nose, entering solely the taste-channel,
[8187] <prose> then entering internally through the root of all four wheels,
[8188] <prose> discursive thought's various movements making the mind race—having blocked this here,
[8189] <prose> connecting mouth and throat,
[8190] <prose> through the throat's nāḍī like a grass-stalk's hollow, the mind's racing horse internally self-ceases and is released;
[8191] <prose> therefore, drawing prāṇa slowly out through the mouth and dwelling however long,
[8192] <prose> horse and rider separate individually, || 130 ||
[8193] <prose> the person dissolving into the heart's internal rigpa, accomplishing non-conceptual samādhi in spontaneous flow—this is the crucial point.
[8194] <prose> Occasionally, prāṇa with rushing sound and force violently expelled,
[8195] <prose> the obscuration of prāṇa-gathering, unpleasant mind,
[8196] <prose> afflictive discursive thought's movement,
[8197] <prose> heart-center's pain—all are cleared.
[8198] <prose> At those times, violent expulsion is the supreme crucial point.
[8199] <prose> Moreover, not knowing this prāṇa-crucial point, even if meditated, appearance's increase and signs reaching measure will certainly not arise.
[8200] <list> Second, the door-gaze's three crucial points:
[8201] <prose> Whichever of the three gazes one performs, without constraining through effort,
[8202] <prose> relaxing internally in natural flow, || 140 ||
[8203] <prose> eyes unmoving, pressing the gaze is that crucial point.
[8204] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[8205] <prose><tantra> Distant-set without movement is the crucial point;
[8206] <prose><tantra> At this time, apply the three gazes.
[8207] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8208] <list> Third, regarding the dharmadhātu-guidance's three crucial points:
[8209] <prose> Slowly with eyes' corners, up and down, into dharmadhātu appearance's sharp edge, eyes unmoving, recognition unmoved, awareness resting in clarity-emptiness single-pointedly—this is the crucial point.
[8210] <prose><tantra> From that very source:
[8211] <prose><tantra> Dharmadhātu's crucial point is guidance;
[8212] <prose><tantra> thus it is spoken, and:
[8213] <prose><tantra> From the Rtsal Dzog: || 150 ||
[8214] <prose><tantra> In dharmadhātu, mindfulness awakened, sky-space,
[8215] <prose><tantra> Appearing as five masses, garuḍa of gold soaring,
[8216] <prose><tantra> Without grasping attachment, without conceptual extremes, hovering.
[8217] <prose><tantra> In self-appearance without directional falling, sky-space,
[8218] <prose><tantra> Luminous-emptiness free from elaboration, garuḍa soaring,
[8219] <prose><tantra> Without grasping appearance, in that state hovering.
[8220] <prose><tantra> In signs free from elaboration, sky-space,
[8221] <prose><tantra> Free from grasping and apprehending, dharmakāya's garuḍa soaring,
[8222] <prose><tantra> Dharmatā's self-appearance in bindu's state hovering.
[8223] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8224] <list> Fourth:
[8225] <prose> Through focusing upon external space-object cloudless sky, rigpa clears and opens, appearance quickly increasing; || 160 ||
[8226] <prose> through focusing upon internal dharmadhātu lamp, luminosity mother-child connect;
[8227] <prose> through focusing upon secret object rigpa's self-clarity, the meaning of primordial purity and exhausted phenomena self-clarifies in its own place—there exists this crucial point.
[8228] <prose><tantra> From the Rangshar:
[8229] <prose><tantra> In the sky-empty maṇḍala of space,
[8230] <prose><tantra> The uncontrived four lamps,
[8231] <prose><tantra> Unceasing through meaning's nature, clear.
[8232] <prose><tantra> Rigpa, dharmadhātu's lamp,
[8233] <prose><tantra> In sky-empty vast expanse's center,
[8234] <prose><tantra> Dharmadhātu's nature, light-body,
[8235] <prose><tantra> Unceasing, unceased, clearly appearing.
[8236] <prose><tantra> Five wisdoms complete, heart-mind's body,
[8237] <prose><tantra> Arising in garuḍa-fashion.
[8238] <prose><tantra> That too: going and coming,
[8239] <prose><tantra> Movement and trembling.
[8240] <prose><tantra> Rigpa, dharmadhātu's lamp,
[8241] <prose><tantra> Placed within, rigpa unmoved,
[8242] <prose><tantra> Unchanging realization excellently explained. || 170 ||
[8243] <prose><tantra> Self-arisen wisdom's lamp,
[8244] <prose><tantra> Cutting all superimpositions,
[8245] <prose><tantra> Empty bindu's lamp,
[8246] <prose><tantra> Without effort, arisen,
[8247] <prose><tantra> Distant ropes, water's lamp,
[8248] <prose><tantra> Gazing there unmoving,
[8249] <prose><tantra> Perfection of meditation's measure thus spoken.
[8250] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken, and:
[8251] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[8252] <prose><tantra> This itself, the object's crucial point is thus:
[8253] <prose><tantra> In cloudless external object-emptiness,
[8254] <prose><tantra> The yogin dwells in sky's bird-path;
[8255] <prose><tantra> Not separating from this is dharmatā.
[8256] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken, and:
[8257] <prose><tantra> Moreover:
[8258] <prose><tantra> The characteristics of appearance's object are:
[8259] <prose><tantra> In blue-green limitless sky,
[8260] <prose><tantra> Light and color and form,
[8261] <prose><tantra> Five wisdoms' self-appearance shown.
[8262] <prose><tantra> To the pure dharmadhātu lamp,
[8263] <prose><tantra> Bindus, bodies, and illusory appearances,
[8264] <prose><tantra> Natural expression and essence-nature,
[8265] <prose><tantra> Non-dual without separation or dispersion, appear.
[8266] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8267] <prose> At this time, although subtle discursive thought sha-ra-ra arises from prāṇa moving within the nāḍī,
[8268] <prose> there is no harm to directly perceived meaning;
[8269] <prose> that very discursive thought, unable to establish itself by itself, liberates and vanishes—
[8270] <prose> like a bird of prey catching and releasing,
[8271] <prose> though attention scatters elsewhere, without distraction like continuous garuḍa-thread,
[8272] <prose><tantra> karmic traces are not accumulated, || 180 ||
[8273] <prose><tantra> Luminosity's meditation is not destroyed;
[8274] <prose><tantra> Rigpa's potency placed in arising,
[8275] <prose><tantra> Wisdom spontaneously born, opening opportunity.
[8276] <prose> Moreover, through gaze-posture constraining, coarse discursive thought greatly blocked self-ceases;
[8277] <prose> subtle, small, fine discursive thought all self-liberated—
[8278] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[8279] <prose><tantra> From single intent, no movement,
[8280] <prose><tantra> Appearance's appearance clear on appearance's peak,
[8281] <prose><tantra> From face and mirror-like,
[8282] <prose><tantra> Liberation is that and that itself liberated.
[8283] <prose><tantra> Knowing movement empty-vanished,
[8284] <prose><tantra> Seeing-knowing rigpa not different.
[8285] <prose><tantra> That itself liberated at its own peak.
[8286] <prose><tantra> Through single knowing, all liberated;
[8287] <prose><tantra> Two and three's numbers reach exhaustion.
[8288] <prose><tantra> Conceptualizing and grasping's object not appearing;
[8289] <prose><tantra> Movement and grasping primordially empty.
[8290] <prose><tantra> Empty intent clear-perfected,
[8291] <prose><tantra> Multiple numbers reach exhaustion.
[8292] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 190 ||
[8293] <prose> At this time, the intent of View, Meditation, and Conduct three is gathered into single expanse:
[8294] <prose><tantra> From Vajrasattva's heart-mirror:
[8295] <prose><tantra> Without nihilistic extreme-falling, possessing View's measure;
[8296] <prose><tantra> Without conceptuality in clarity, possessing Meditation's measure;
[8297] <prose><tantra> Without contrivance in self-arising, possessing Conduct's measure;
[8298] <prose><tantra> Great bliss without outflow, this non-entity enlightenment,
[8299] <prose><tantra> Like water-moon, not held by grasping;
[8300] <prose><tantra> Like lord's treasure, self-arising desires.
[8301] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8302] <prose> Moreover, if dharmadhātu-rigpa's appearance has not dawned, through gazing evenly at the eye's corner,
[8303] <prose> at the time of seeing, looking unmovingly at the center of sky's maṇḍala of darkness and light is the crucial point.
[8304] <prose><tantra> From the Yige Medpa:
[8305] <prose><tantra> Rigpa resting-naturally, crucial instruction itself,
[8306] <prose><tantra> This is secret heart-essence;
[8307] <prose><tantra> Eyes should be firmly settled,
[8308] <prose><tantra> That too, examine without separation or dispersion.
[8309] <prose><tantra> From eye's corner, dharmadhātu arises;
[8310] <prose><tantra> Light, subtle, coiling arises.
[8311] <prose><tantra> That essence, garuḍa-fashion,
[8312] <prose><tantra> Subtle, trembling, and moving. || 200 ||
[8313] <prose><tantra> Eyes rest in sky's element;
[8314] <prose><tantra> Buddha-body's bindu appears.
[8315] <prose><tantra> From that, finding intent's warmth,
[8316] <prose><tantra> Rigpa's body is garuḍa-fashion,
[8317] <prose><tantra> Together with body, appearance.
[8318] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8319] <prose> At this juncture, the three certainty-pledges of luminosity's determining are:
[8320] <list> The manner of mind's stains purifying in essence-intent;
[8321] <list> The manner of resting evenly in state without movement;
[8322] <list> The manner of signs-measure time-certain arising from that.
[8323] <list> First has three parts:
[8324] <list> Essence-intent itself;
[8325] <list> Mind and traces' illustrative examples;
[8326] <list> The main pledge of separation from that.
[8327] <list> First:
[8328] <prose><tantra> From Samantabhadra's mind-mirror:
[8329] <prose><tantra> Unwavering sky, thus rigpa clear,
[8330] <prose><tantra> Clear without distraction, depth unfathomable state;
[8331] <prose><tantra> Luminous-emptiness vast, great bliss dharmadhātu, engage.
[8332] <prose><tantra> Single-pointed clarity, ultimate dharmadhātu's state;
[8333] <prose><tantra> Unmixed perfection, spontaneously accomplished ground abide.
[8334] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8335] <prose> In rigpa's essence, four wisdoms arising as self-potency show realization's superior seeing of natural state.
[8336] <list> The four wisdoms:
[8337] <prose><tantra> From the Rangshar:
[8338] <prose><tantra> Moreover upon rigpa's essence, || 210 ||
[8339] <prose><tantra> Wisdom possessing four aspects,
[8340] <prose><tantra> These four wisdoms thus:
[8341] <prose><tantra> Liberating wisdom, liberating all,
[8342] <prose><tantra> Liberating everything completely;
[8343] <prose><tantra> Afflictions purified, liberated into pure field,
[8344] <prose><tantra> Without concept, without birth, liberated into state,
[8345] <prose><tantra> Ignorance into rigpa's expanse liberated,
[8346] <prose><tantra> Wisdom conceptuality into state liberated;
[8347] <prose><tantra> Therefore, liberating wisdom.
[8348] <prose><tantra> Stirring wisdom, moving
[8349] <prose><tantra> Five bodies pure, into dharmadhātu moving,
[8350] <prose><tantra> Five lights, grasping-free, into dharmadhātu moving,
[8351] <prose><tantra> Rigpa pristine wisdom, into dharmadhātu moving,
[8352] <prose><tantra> Lamps sky-space, into dharmadhātu moving;
[8353] <prose><tantra> Therefore, stirring wisdom.
[8354] <prose><tantra> Gathering wisdom, gathering
[8355] <prose><tantra> Elements five lights, internally gathering,
[8356] <prose><tantra> Sky-space lamps, internally gathering,
[8357] <prose><tantra> Five bodies' rigpa's state, internally gathering,
[8358] <prose><tantra> Rigpa without concept, internally gathering;
[8359] <prose><tantra> Therefore, gathering wisdom,
[8360] <prose><tantra> Gathering elements five lights internally,
[8361] <prose><tantra> Gathering sky-space lamps internally,
[8362] <prose><tantra> Gathering five bodies rigpa's state internally,
[8363] <prose><tantra> Gathering rigpa without concept internally;
[8364] <prose><tantra> Therefore, gathering wisdom.
[8365] <prose><tantra> Distinguishing wisdom, distinguishing
[8366] <prose><tantra> Ignorance and rigpa, distinguishing two,
[8367] <prose><tantra> Afflictions and pristine wisdom, distinguishing two,
[8368] <prose><tantra> Pure and impure, distinguishing two,
[8369] <prose><tantra> Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, distinguishing two,
[8370] <prose><tantra> Realized and unrealized, distinguishing two,
[8371] <prose><tantra> Good and bad, distinguishing two;
[8372] <prose><tantra> Therefore, distinguishing wisdom.
[8373] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 220 ||
[8374] <prose> Second, at that time, mind and traces' intent-purifications purifying:
[8375] <prose> The illustrative example of that:
[8376] <prose><tantra> From Vajrasattva's heart-mirror:
[8377] <prose><tantra> Emaho, Vajradhara, listen!
[8378] <prose><tantra> Unmatured discursive thought, saṃsāra,
[8379] <prose><tantra> Like iron inserted in gold,
[8380] <prose><tantra> Not liberated, liberation's time not arising.
[8381] <prose><tantra> Ignorance iron-inserted, not liberated;
[8382] <prose><tantra> Ignorance like water, afflictions gather.
[8383] <prose><tantra> Anger-fire like kalpa's fire-mass;
[8384] <prose><tantra> Attachment, whatever, like drinking brine-water;
[8385] <prose><tantra> Delusion-darkness like empty house darkness;
[8386] <prose><tantra> Pride-arrogance like pressing down mountains;
[8387] <prose><tantra> Jealousy ill-will like narrow dark valleys;
[8388] <prose><tantra> Five afflictions, wisdom's obscuration making;
[8389] <prose><tantra> Mind like bitch-thief;
[8390] <prose><tantra> Consciousness like forest monkey;
[8391] <prose><tantra> Mind like impure swamp;
[8392] <prose><tantra> All-basis like sentient-being pig;
[8393] <prose><tantra> Knowing like bird-feather wind-carried;
[8394] <prose><tantra> Grasping-apprehending like man woman;
[8395] <prose><tantra> Karmic varieties like bird-swarm circling;
[8396] <prose><tantra> Suffering varieties like water's ripples;
[8397] <prose><tantra> Affliction-result, endurance method lacking;
[8398] <prose><tantra> Saṃsāra's suffering, grasping-apprehending thorn-needle this,
[8399] <prose><tantra> By doing not released, by leaving released becomes;
[8400] <prose><tantra> Abandoning done phenomena, ease accomplished;
[8401] <prose><tantra> Abandoning all thought, supreme wisdom unmoved;
[8402] <prose><tantra> Secret mantra king, afflictions into wisdom transformed;
[8403] <prose><tantra> Like empty house lamp-kindled,
[8404] <prose><tantra> Wisdom-lamp, ignorance into rigpa transformed.
[8405] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8406] <list> Third, the manner of separation from that has three parts:
[8407] <list> Direct perception's own-time separation itself;
[8408] <list> Establishing separation's validity;
[8409] <list> Speaking other designations.
[8410] <list> First:
[8411] <prose> Through looking at external appearance-luminosity,
[8412] <prose> without delusion, internal self-clarity's meditation self-clear at that time,
[8413] <prose> mind and wisdom momentarily parting back-to-back, all-basis eight-collections together with wisdom covered,
[8414] <prose> saṃsāra's phenomena not clear.
[8415] <prose> The perfected past self-established spontaneously—
[8416] <prose><tantra> From Samantabhadra's mind-mirror:

[8526] <list> Third, the manner of signs-measure time-certain arising from that has three parts:
[8527] <list> Luminosity three bodies' signs;
[8528] <list> Samādhi spontaneously accomplished's measure;
[8529] <list> Unmoving even-resting's time.
[8530] <list> First:
[8531] <prose><tantra> Moreover from that very source:
[8532] <prose><tantra> Through samādhi first resting-naturally,
[8533] <prose><tantra> Three bodies gradually accustomed,
[8534] <prose><tantra> Entity-nature's yogin,
[8535] <prose><tantra> Through this meaning, supreme nearness becomes.
[8536] <prose><tantra> Three bodies accustomed samādhi experienced,
[8537] <prose><tantra> Simultaneous arising is not;
[8538] <prose><tantra> All this gradually, mind's object.
[8539] <prose><tantra> At first, samādhi nirmāṇakāya obtained,
[8540] <prose><tantra> At that time, to self-knowing,
[8541] <prose><tantra> Previously unseen phenomena,
[8542] <prose><tantra> Without thinking, to mind arise.
[8543] <prose><tantra> Self-instruction's conventional words,
[8544] <prose><tantra> Without grasping, to mind radiate;
[8545] <prose><tantra> To person possessing fortune,
[8546] <prose><tantra> Dharma's taste, mind expanding,
[8547] <prose><tantra> Body too, six-seven days,

[8549] <prose><tantra> Earth's surface transcending,
[8550] <prose><tantra> To intermediate space going experience,
[8551] <prose><tantra> Self's activity sphere arising.
[8552] <prose><tantra> Rigpa uncontrived, castle-placed,
[8553] <prose><tantra> Self thus obtains nirmāṇakāya.
[8554] <prose><tantra> That transcended, rigpa unmoved,
[8555] <prose><tantra> Saṃbhogakāya body too,
[8556] <prose><tantra> Self-knowing's continuum,
[8557] <prose><tantra> Self-appearance effort all-free,
[8558] <prose><tantra> Experience thus arising.
[8559] <prose><tantra> Previously unseen light-appearance too,

[8566] <prose><tantra> Entity's after-mind not following,
[8567] <prose><tantra> World's activities mind not appearing.
[8568] <prose><tantra> Through this, saṃbhogakāya obtained.
[8569] <prose><tantra> Then rigpa to sky,
[8570] <prose><tantra> Resting-naturally great gaze,
[8571] <prose><tantra> Without distraction evenly resting,
[8572] <prose><tantra> Again dharmakāya's samādhi appears.
[8573] <prose><tantra> That time, knowing depth-clear,
[8574] <prose><tantra> Garuḍa-fashion directly engaging,
[8575] <prose><tantra> Appearance-increase's measure is.
[8576] <prose><tantra> Knowing sharp, quick,
[8577] <prose><tantra> Previously unseen Buddha seen,
[8578] <prose><tantra> This, that time, people,
[8579] <prose><tantra> Hundred-thousand million to mind appear.
[8580] <prose><tantra> Body's previously done,
[8581] <prose><tantra> Knowing-without knowing's crafts and,
[8582] <prose><tantra> Illusion-magic and letters and,

[8590] <prose><tantra> Self and other benefits,
[8591] <prose><tantra> Person this accomplishes.
[8592] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8593] <list> Second, samādhi spontaneously accomplished's measure:
[8594] <prose><tantra> Moreover from that very source:

[8597] <prose><tantra> Nirmāṇakāya body's yogin engaging,
[8598] <prose><tantra> Previously non-existent great compassion,
[8599] <prose><tantra> Self-continuum supreme arising,
[8600] <prose><tantra> This time, nirmāṇakāya's samādhi obtained.
[8601] <prose><tantra> Clear without concept, knowing's experience,
[8602] <prose><tantra> Saṃbhogakāya's samādhi called.
[8603] <prose><tantra> Outflow-free emptiness bindu's body,
[8604] <prose><tantra> Effort-free self-arisen time,
[8605] <prose><tantra> Dharmakāya's samādhi,
[8606] <prose><tantra> Yogin possessing this obtains.
[8607] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.

[8655] <prose><tantra> Secret mantra familiarization's characteristic.
[8656] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8657] <list> Second, day-night luminosity wheel has three parts:
[8658] <list> Dharmadhātu-luminosity's arising-basis recognition;
[8659] <list> From that, lamps' practice shown;
[8660] <list> Day-night wheel-revolution's meditation manner determined.
[8661] <list> First:
[8662] <prose> Although spoken before, here extensively summarized, clearly shown in five:
[8663] <list> Dharmadhātu's abiding manner;
[8664] <list> Lamps' location manner;
[8665] <list> Dharmadhātu-rigpa arising manner;
[8666] <list> Practice engagement manner;
[8667] <list> Distinctive certainty manner.
[8668] <list> First:
[8669] <prose> Dharmadhātu's luminosity, Sugata's essence, exists without distinction in all sentient beings.
[8670] <prose><tantra> From the Norbu Phradak:
[8671] <prose><tantra> Like sesame or mustard seed,
[8672] <prose><tantra> Oil itself primordially spontaneously complete,
[8673] <prose><tantra> Sentient being body-appearance,
[8674] <prose><tantra> Thus Tathāgata's seed,
[8675] <prose><tantra> Harmonious light and self-complete
[8676] <prose><tantra> Abiding, Path-entering door-pure,
[8677] <prose><tantra> Arising variously, benefit engaging.
[8678] <prose><tantra> Sky-space everywhere pervading sentient beings,
[8679] <prose><tantra> Rigpa's meaning also that much.
[8680] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8681] <prose> Where it exists:
[8682] <prose><tantra> From that very source:
[8683] <prose><tantra> Emaho, rigpa's abiding nature,
[8684] <prose><tantra> Self's heart-center abides;
[8685] <prose><tantra> Father-mother two's aspect-holding,
[8686] <prose><tantra> Method-wisdom manner abides.
[8687] <prose><tantra> Father's aspect-holding, method's body;

[8689] <prose><tantra> Light and rays manner abides.
[8690] <prose><tantra> Dharmadhātu and rigpa excellently adorned,
[8691] <prose><tantra> Spontaneously perfected great bindu abides.
[8692] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8693] <prose> Moreover, how body and wisdom abide as dharmadhātu-rigpa's light-expanse,
[8694] <prose> location certainty is what and what:
[8695] <prose><tantra> From the Rtsal Dzog:
[8696] <prose><tantra> Each-own mind-jewel within,
[8697] <prose><tantra> Colorful light-blazing, vase-fashion,

[8703] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken, and:
[8704] <prose><tantra> All-basis dharma-source great treasury,
[8705] <prose><tantra> Rigpa's pristine wisdom as mass abides;
[8706] <prose><tantra> Appearance grasping-free object's treasury,

[8720] <prose><tantra> Emptiness signless sky-space treasury,
[8721] <prose><tantra> Rigpa's pristine wisdom light abides;
[8722] <prose><tantra> That is shown as secret treasury.
[8723] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8724] <prose> Moreover, rigpa's essence that basis-heart abiding, time, dharmadhātu five lights within exists, like peacock's egg.
[8725] <prose> Path dharmadhātu dawning time, sky-space's rainbow-light;
[8726] <prose> completion time, like chick freed from egg-shell.
[8727] <prose><tantra> From the Rtsal Dzog:
[8728] <prose><tantra> Basis-abiding rigpa,
[8729] <prose><tantra> In pristine wisdom dharmadhātu, three bodies complete;
[8730] <prose><tantra> Like peacock's egg example,
[8731] <prose><tantra> Internal light pristine wisdom clearly shown.
[8732] <prose><tantra> Path-dawning rigpa,
[8733] <prose><tantra> Like rainbow example shown;
[8734] <prose><tantra> Completion-directed rigpa,
[8735] <prose><tantra> Like peacock chick eggs,
[8736] <prose><tantra> Breaking, emerging, benefit-engaging.
[8737] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8738] <prose> Moreover, that pristine wisdom unmatured time, opening for all;
[8739] <prose> appearing time, light;
[8740] <prose><tantra> Familiar time, body-appearance;
[8741] <prose><tantra> From that, expression-free dharmadhātu,
[8742] <prose><tantra> Luminosity unobstructed touch arises;
[8743] <prose><tantra> Appearing time, light-appears,
[8744] <prose><tantra> Perfection time, self-appearance.
[8745] <prose><tantra> Familiar time, body transforms,
[8746] <prose><tantra> Wisdom-method connected,
[8747] <prose><tantra> Ultimate maṇḍala five seen.
[8748] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8749] <prose> Thus abiding body and rigpa and dharmadhātu and wisdom's characteristics:
[8750] <prose><tantra> Moreover from that very source:
[8751] <prose><tantra> Body's characteristics thus:
