[17656] <prose> That same from.
[17657] <prose> Mind is latencies all basis.
[17658] <prose> Embodied beings stain.
[17659] <prose> Grasp object on hold mind.
[17660] <prose> That reason saṃsāra Dharma-nature.
[17661] <prose> Thus and.
[17662] <prose> Again.
[17663] <prose> Jnana recollection-basis itself and separate || 140 ||
[17664] <prose> Thus.
[17665] <prose> Six-expanse from also.
[17666] <prose> Mind and jnana self essence not-distinguish if.
[17667] <prose> Sun cloud-masses through of obscured and like outer appearance meaning do impossible thus.
[17668] <prose> That-also mind.
[17669] <prose> Karma and afflictions and latencies all basis and source and accumulate-do and all from arise and.
[17670] <prose> Non-Awareness house in always abide through of jnana sun and oppose and obscure.

[17715] <prose> Conceptions all burned through of.
[17716] <prose> Jnana itself fire like consume.
[17717] <prose> Space itself and equal.
[17718] <prose> Empty-luminous Awareness-possess itself.
[17719] <prose> Thus.
[17720] <prose> Here not-know some.
[17721] <prose> Mind not-possess if inanimate or darkness like become thus also learning small.
[17722] <prose> Mind not-possess though jnana exist through of Awareness cease not through of reason.
[17723] <prose> That-also non-Awareness delusion mind cease through of || 200 ||
[17724] <prose> Jnana clear sun arise.
[17725] <prose> Night dawn through of day rise like.
[17726] <prose> Some is.
[17727] <prose> Non-Awareness Awareness pervader is through of.
[17728] <prose> Mind cease time Awareness cease think also very mistake great.
[17729] <prose> Awareness through of non-Awareness outward pervade though.
[17730] <prose> Non-Awareness inward not-pervade Buddha jnana like.
[17731] <prose> Mind on non-Awareness through of pervade through of.

[17734] <prose> Non-Awareness Awareness expanse from cease or continuum break think.
[17735] <prose> Therefore mind cease time basis non-Awareness part possessing cease though.
[17736] <prose> Awareness unceasing cease basis Awareness is through of reason.
[17737] <prose> Awareness-also not-possess if what top on cease think suitable.
[17738] <prose> Here non-Awareness mind part possessing cease through of Awareness jnana expand and two-knowledges on enjoy.
[17739] <prose> Pearl garland from.
[17740] <prose> Mind is movement all separate through of.
[17741] <prose> Inanimate like not.
[17742] <prose> Know and Awareness on clear do appear.
[17743] <prose> Thus spoken || 220 ||
[17744] <prose> There mind and jnana each-other.
[17745] <prose> Common body from also.
[17746] <prose> Mind and mind-itself nature through of pure two distinguish.
[17747] <prose> That on mind is all-conception saṃsāra Dharma.
