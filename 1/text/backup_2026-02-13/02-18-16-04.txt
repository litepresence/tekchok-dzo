[5928] <verse> Tenth: Attainment of the Dharma-Cloud-Like Ground.
[5929] <prose> That is obtaining without abandoning this very shell of truth-vision.
[5930] <prose> Those persons who abandon the shell obtain thus.
[5931] <prose> Delusion-vision ceasing, dawning as heap-vision—this is the eleventh: Attainment of the Universal Light Ground.
[5932] <prose> Then, not attaching even to that vision, unstained by all outer-inner dharmas—
[5933] <verse> Twelfth: Attainment of the Non-Attaching Lotus-Possessing Ground. || 10 ||
[5934] <prose> Then, from the self-heart, wisdom-ray lines dawning, from sky-space, five light-heaps abiding in wheel-manner—
[5935] <verse> Thirteenth: Attainment of the Great Collection Wheel of Letters Ground.
[5936] <prose> Then, abiding in wisdom-vision is the fourteenth: Attainment of the Great Samadhi Ground.
[5937] <prose> Then, certainty obtained at spontaneously-accomplished ground is the fifteenth: Attainment of the Vajra-Holder Ground.
[5938] <prose> Then, wisdom naturally dawning at primordially-pure ground, without anything above that, is
[5939] <verse> Sixteenth: Attainment of the Wisdom-Guru Ground.
[5940] <prose> Those are applied through similar aspects of vision-manner; they are not the actual ten bodhisattva grounds.
[5941] <prose> Those grounds also: divisions from the vision-aspect of one ground—awareness-luminosity without purifying or traversing.
[5942] <prose> In meaning, it is one awareness-ground. || 20 ||
[5943] <prose> For obtaining Buddha Vajradhara, specific causal grounds are not needed,
[5944] <prose> for they are applied thus to different entry-doors of path-essentials.
[5945] <prose> The manner of obtaining each ground through cause-result sequence, like common ones, and
[5946] <prose> mantra outer-inner generation-completion effort-accomplishment grounds obtained without needing purification.
[5947] <prose><tantra> From that itself:
[5948] <prose><tantra> "Therefore, although inconceivable beings exist, there is not more than one wisdom-essence.
[5949] <prose><tantra> 'Ground' and 'path' do not exist separately.
[5950] <prose><tantra> Know that there is no need to purify or traverse ground and path."
[5951] <prose><tantra> From the Kun byed:
[5952] <verse> "Awareness spontaneously complete, not transformed, not purified." || 30 ||
[5953] <prose> Thus it is.
[5954] <ornament> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[5955] <ornament> Showing the Summary of the Luminous Vajra Essence Path—the Eighteenth Chapter.
[5956] <prose> Thus, having shown the actual path,
[5957] <prose> now, regarding the path's distinction: for those of supreme faculties, the supreme means of liberating without meditation—bringing certainty to the secret instruction of Trekchö—has three parts:
[5958] <list> 1. Cutting the path through bringing self-essence to the point,
[5959] <list> 2. Binding the summary through cutting connection-words at the point,
[5960] <list> 3. Clearing obstacles through cutting confidence-liberation at the point.
[5961] <prose> The first has three:
[5962] <prose> Bringing certainty to the essence, sky-like, beyond accepting, rejecting, action, and effort, in the nature of great perfection.
