[3062] <prose> Since there is no beginning, meaning stops like an unestablished cause.
[3063] <prose><tantra> From the intermediate mother, the Ratnagotravibhāga:
[3064] <prose> <tantra> "In ultimate truth, saṃsāra does not exist.
[3065] <prose> <tantra> Nirvāṇa does not exist.
[3066] <prose> <tantra> Emptiness does not exist.
[3067] <prose> <tantra> It is merely designated by words—it is said."
[3068] <prose> In this, conventional truth is completely non-abiding.
[3069] <list> Cause is non-abiding.
[3070] <list> Distinction is non-abiding.
[3071] <list> The distinguisher is non-abiding. || 10 ||
[3072] <list> One is non-abiding.
[3073] <list> Many is non-abiding.
[3074] <list> Beyond one and many is non-abiding.
[3075] <list> Mere appearance is completely non-abiding—various divisions beyond measure.
[3076] <prose> This is called the consequentialist Middle Way higher school.
[3077] <prose> The consequentialist Middle Way is explained:
[3078] <prose> Thus, in ultimate truth, nothing whatsoever is established.
[3079] <prose> All is negated: conventional appearance as merely illusion established, and so forth.
[3080] <prose> Asserting freedom from the extremes of existence and non-existence, free from all conceptual claims.
[3081] <prose> As the Noble King of Samādhi Sutra states: || 20 ||
[3082] <prose> <tantra> "Permanent and impermanent—this is also an extreme.
[3083] <prose> <tantra> Existence and non-existence—both are extremes.
[3084] <prose> <tantra> Therefore, both extremes are completely abandoned.
[3085] <prose> <tantra> The wise one does not even abide in the middle."
[3086] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[3087] <prose><tantra> From the Ratnakūṭa Sutra:
[3088] <prose> <tantra> "The Tathāgatas are permanent dharmas without birth.
[3089] <prose> <tantra> All dharmas are like the Sugatas.
[3090] <prose> <tantra> Since childish intellect grasps at signs,
[3091] <prose> <tantra> One engages in the dharma that does not exist within the world." || 30 ||
[3092] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[3093] <prose><tantra> From the Root Wisdom, Mūlamadhyamakakārikā:
[3094] <prose> <tantra> "Whatever depends and connects,
[3095] <prose> <tantra> Through non-cessation, there is no birth.
[3096] <prose> <tantra> Through non-annihilation, there is no permanence.
[3097] <prose> <tantra> Through non-coming, there is no going.
[3098] <prose> <tantra> Neither different meaning nor single meaning.
[3099] <prose> <tantra> Showing the cessation of elaboration, peace.
[3100] <prose> <tantra> The perfect Buddhas speak.
[3101] <prose> <tantra> Homage to that supreme one." || 40 ||
[3102] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[3103] <prose><tantra> From the Refutation of Objections:
[3104] <prose> <tantra> "If I were to assert something exists,
[3105] <prose> <tantra> Then I would have this fault.
[3106] <prose> <tantra> Since I assert nothing,
[3107] <prose> <tantra> I am only without faults."
[3108] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[3109] <prose> Since there is nothing to refute,
[3110] <prose> I refute nothing.
[3111] <prose> Therefore, it is said that one refutes. || 50 ||
[3112] <prose> You have imposed that imputation.
[3113] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[3114] <prose> And this also, since no view is established by intellect, one wishes for the cessation of elaboration.
[3115] <prose> Although placed as various mere appearances in the branch of conventional symbol-knowledge as worldly convention,
[3116] <prose> This also is not ultimately asserted.
[3117] <prose> One wishes to be free from the extremes of existence and non-existence and from the present time, beyond true and false appearance of dharma.
[3118] <prose> This is the summit of the established views of the Buddhas who assert suchness.
[3119] <prose> This great treatise is the six collections of middle-way reasoning.
[3120] <list> The Root Wisdom,
[3121] <list> The Sixty Verses on Reasoning, || 60 ||
[3122] <list> The Seventy on Emptiness,
[3123] <list> The Fine Analysis,
[3124] <list> The Refutation of Objections,
[3125] <list> The Conventional Establishment.
[3126] <prose> Also this, from the speech of the noble Nāgārjuna:
[3127] <prose> Composed the collection of words on the explanation of the first teaching, the dharma-wheel of the four truths.
[3128] <prose> Composed the collection of reasoning on the explanation of the dharma-wheel of the middle, characteristic-less dharmas.
[3129] <prose> Composed the collection of praise on the explanation of the dharma-wheel of the ultimate, distinguished dharmas.
[3130] <prose> Therefore, this master turns the dharma-wheel with the second Buddha.
[3131] <prose> These treatises are without distinction of teaching and difference. || 70 ||
[3132] <prose><tantra> The four divisions: establishing the vehicle of Tantra as action, divided into two.
[3133] <prose> The presentation of the excellent mode of the causal vehicle.
[3134] <prose> And the explanation of the excellent vehicle itself.
[3135] <ornament> First: Through the vehicle of characteristics, one must strive greatly with difficulty, accomplishing through great perseverance.
[3136] <prose> Through depending on causes, mantras ripen results with little effort, attaining Buddhahood, surpassing the lower vehicle.
[3137] <prose> Through causes, the path of five paths, the ten grounds with great difficulty, over countless eons, to reach the Buddha.
[3138] <prose> Mantra: Excellent life alone.
[3139] <prose> The intermediate bardo.
[3140] <prose> Through least birth, through Buddha, quickly surpassing.
[3141] <prose> Even seeing the first truth of cause requires boundless collections and so forth. || 80 ||
[3142] <prose> Even accomplishing through subtle mantras, maṇḍalas, offerings, and so forth, surpasses.
[3143] <prose> Not making emptiness in the direct path of cause.
[3144] <prose> Expedient meaning and definitive meaning.
[3145] <prose> Showing intention and hidden intention, arranging.
[3146] <prose> Mantra, shown directly in one moment, surpasses through freedom from obstacles and hindrances.
[3147] <prose> Briefly:
[3148] <list> Accomplishing the meaning desired by the mantra vehicle through the causal vehicle.
[3149] <list> Many means.
[3150] <list> No difficulty.
[3151] <list> Non-delusion. || 90 ||
[3152] <list> Surpassing through sharp faculties accomplishing quickly.
[3153] <prose><tantra> From the Lamp of the Three Modes:
[3154] <prose> <tantra> "Even if one meaning, non-delusion.
[3155] <prose> <tantra> Many means, no difficulty.
[3156] <prose> <tantra> Through control of sharp faculties.
[3157] <prose> <tantra> Surpassing the excellent mantra vehicle."
[3158] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[3159] <prose> Second, from the five aspects:
[3160] <prose> The essence is the self-arisen wisdom, the expanse of clear light, the truth directly realized, the supreme secret means.
[3161] <prose> The divisions of meeting the spontaneous expanse of generation and completion. || 100 ||
[3162] <prose> The definition is mantra, praised as supreme for quickly accomplishing enlightenment and protecting from affliction.
[3163] <prose> The purpose is to liberate those with sharp faculties.
[3164] <prose> The result is accomplished as supreme by Vajradhara in one life, the intermediate state, or through the path.
[3165] <prose> Divided into two.
[3166] <prose><tantra> The outer vehicle of Munī's Tantra.
[3167] <prose><tantra> And the inner vehicle of means Tantra.
[3168] <prose> Thus it is said.
[3169] <prose><tantra> From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
[3170] <prose> <tantra> "The vajra vehicle has two aspects.
[3171] <prose> <tantra> The outer Munī tantra. || 110 ||
[3172] <prose> <tantra> And the inner means tantra."
[3173] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[3174] <prose><tantra> If one asks what is placed as Tantra in mantra:
[3175] <prose> When the main person's continuum meets the clear light of expanse, it is called "thus."
[3176] <prose> The first is divided into three.
[3177] <list> The action tantra vehicle, Kriyā.
[3178] <list> The both tantra vehicle, Upāya.
[3179] <list> The yoga tantra vehicle, Yoga.
[3180] <prose> Thus it is said.
[3181] <prose><tantra> From that itself: || 120 ||
[3182] <prose> <tantra> "The outer tantra has three aspects.
[3183] <prose> <tantra> Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga."
[3184] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[3185] <ornament> First:
[3186] <prose> Accomplishing through the three purifications and pure conduct as self and deity, master and servant, attaining accomplishment.
[3187] <prose> This divides into two.
[3188] <list> The main activity of purification.
[3189] <list> The main activity of visualization.
[3190] <ornament> First: Entering through bath and pure sound, meditating on the body as pure deity form.
[3191] <prose> Performing the three baths. || 130 ||
[3192] <prose> Changing the three garments.
[3193] <prose> Relying on the three whites.
[3194] <prose> And relying on the three sweets, etc.
[3195] <prose><tantra> From the lower, this surpassing manner.
[3196] <prose> Not establishing as true in the capacity of conventional appearance.
[3197] <prose> Through the three objects of meditation—visualizing forms, statues, images—all appearances become clear as deity forms.
[3198] <prose> Without abandoning form, not abiding in the extremes of one and many.
[3199] <prose> Meditating on speech syllables and letters, all sounds become clear as deity sounds, reciting mantras.
[3200] <prose> Not abiding in the four extremes of birth and cessation.
[3201] <prose> The sound extent is no other than the deity of sound. || 140 ||
[3202] <prose> Meditating on the mind's signs, all thoughts become clear as concentration deities.
[3203] <prose> Not departing from all thought through meditation, not abiding in great dependent origination.
[3204] <prose> Not even conventionally arising or born.
[3205] <prose> In ultimate truth, commitment deities, primordial wisdom beings.
[3206] <prose> Looking at the aspects of self, speech, and beings as master and servant, obstacles cease and accomplishments are obtained.
[3207] <prose> Depending on common accomplishments, conventional truth is not abandoned.
[3208] <prose> Depending on supreme accomplishments, ultimate truth is not established—thus surpassing.
[3209] <prose> The main activity of visualization is meditating on deity through the generation and completion stages, the subtle radiating and gathering.
[3210] <prose> Meditating on the deity's form, speech, and mind as the collection of forms, sounds, and thoughts.
[3211] <prose> The main activity of purification is through the purity of body and speech. || 150 ||
[3212] <prose> The main activity of the object is the meditation of mind.
[3213] <prose> Thus it is said.
[3214] <prose><tantra> From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
[3215] <prose> <tantra> "The established view of the Kriyā vehicle.
[3216] <prose> <tantra> The door of entry is the three purifications.
[3217] <prose> <tantra> Entering through bath and purity.
[3218] <prose> <tantra> The samaya of protection is thus:
[3219] <prose> <tantra> Not drinking even one cup of water.
[3220] <prose> <tantra> Conducting without distraction.
[3221] <prose> <tantra> Performing the three purifications of action. || 160 ||
[3222] <prose> <tantra> The three purifications are:
[3223] <prose> <tantra> The purification of deity and maṇḍala.
[3224] <prose> <tantra> The purification of substance and enjoyment.
[3225] <prose> <tantra> The purification of mantra and concentration.
[3226] <prose> <tantra> The view of realization is thus:
[3227] <prose> <tantra> The two purifications of deity and yogi.
[3228] <prose> <tantra> Viewing as master and servant.
[3229] <prose> <tantra> The stage of abandonment is thus:
[3230] <prose> <tantra> Abandoning meat, fish, onions.
[3231] <prose> <tantra> And likewise alcohol, etc. || 170 ||
[3232] <prose> <tantra> Attachment to concentration.
[3233] <prose> <tantra> Such is the Kriyā vehicle."
[3234] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[3235] <ornament> The fifth: The both tantra vehicle, Upāya.
[3236] <prose> Since one desires conduct as Kriyā and view as Yoga.
[3237] <prose> It is called the neutral vehicle.
[3238] <prose> Also this: Through bathing and purity, making the three doors pure.
[3239] <prose> Accomplishing the supreme maṇḍala and so forth through the five manifest enlightenments and so forth.
[3240] <prose><tantra> Also this from the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
[3241] <prose> <tantra> "Upāya is thus. || 180 ||
[3242] <prose> <tantra> View as Yoga.
[3243] <prose> <tantra> Conduct as Kriyā.
[3244] <prose> <tantra> Therefore it is called the both tantra."
[3245] <prose> Thus it is taught.
[3246] <ornament> The sixth: The yoga tantra vehicle.
[3247] <prose> Through the five doors of manifest enlightenment, viewing self and deity as brothers and friends, conducting samaya and purity.
[3248] <prose> Desiring to obtain through the great collection of the result wheel.
[3249] <prose> Divided: The main activity of action.
[3250] <prose> The main activity of concentration.
[3251] <ornament> First: Performing ritual actions. || 190 ||
[3252] <prose> The supreme action king.
[3253] <prose><tantra> From the two supreme maṇḍala kings.
[3254] <prose> Action, and scattered actions.
[3255] <prose><tantra> From the two: relying on the supreme action king.
[3256] <prose> Scattered actions rely on any ritual aspect, desiring enlightenment.
[3257] <list> Offerings.
[3258] <list> Tormas.
[3259] <list> Fire offerings.
[3260] <list> Continuous effort in recitation and so forth.
[3261] <prose> The supreme action king is practiced through all aspects of maṇḍala accomplishment. || 200 ||
[3262] <prose> Desiring enlightenment through five or six means: tormas, fire offerings, and so forth.
[3263] <prose> The supreme maṇḍala king:
[3264] <prose> Through ground rituals, relying on empowerment until one becomes a Buddha.
[3265] <prose> The main activity of concentration:
[3266] <prose> The first stage of preparation.
[3267] <prose> If relying on completely pure concentration.
[3268] <prose> One may meditate on a single deity.
[3269] <prose> Or meditate on the maṇḍala wheel.
[3270] <prose> Generating through the five manifest enlightenments.
[3271] <prose> Through sun and moon, relying on means and wisdom, manifest enlightenment arises from meditating on the lotus, stacked high. || 210 ||
[3272] <prose> Through the door of completely perfect form adornment, manifest enlightenment in the completely pure sense fields.
[3273] <prose> Through the wheel of the syllables and letters AḤ KāḤ, manifest enlightenment in the aspects of sound, words, and names.
[3274] <prose> The vajra of mind, signs, and embrace.
[3275] <prose> Through doors such as wheels and jewels, manifest enlightenment as Buddhas of each family.
[3276] <prose> Through the door of completely pure primordial wisdom beings, manifest enlightenment in the completely pure nature of reality through the five meditations.
[3277] <prose> The completely pure outer aggregates and elements.
[3278] <prose> The inner five actions and afflictions are completely purified.
[3279] <prose> The five secret objects and faculties are completely purified.
[3280] <prose> The five families become Buddhas as one's own self.
[3281] <prose> Meditating on commitment deity and self as brothers and friends. || 220 ||
[3282] <prose> Knowing no good cause for deity.
[3283] <prose> Accomplishment arises from oneself.
[3284] <prose> Realizing no bad cause for self, now as clear deity form in the illusion body—surpassing the lower.
[3285] <prose> Also this: Realizing the generation deity and self as non-dual.
[3286] <prose> Neither ultimate nor conventional name exists.
[3287] <prose> These also:
[3288] <prose><tantra> From the Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
[3289] <prose> <tantra> "The established view of yoga is thus.
[3290] <prose> <tantra> The doors of entry are the five manifest enlightenments.
[3291] <prose> <tantra> The view of realization as deity and friend. || 230 ||
[3292] <prose> <tantra> Keeping the three samayas of protection without shame.
[3293] <prose> <tantra> Pure conduct neither refutes nor establishes.
[3294] <prose> <tantra> The five enlightenments are thus.
[3295] <prose> <tantra> Enlightenment through the door of seat.
[3296] <prose> <tantra> Enlightenment through the door of form.
[3297] <prose> <tantra> Enlightenment through the door of emblem.
[3298] <prose> <tantra> Enlightenment through the door of generation.
[3299] <prose> <tantra> Enlightenment through the door of syllables and letters.
[3300] <prose> <tantra> Thus the five enlightenments are practiced.
[3301] <prose> <tantra> The three shameless ones—what are they? || 240 ||
[3302] <prose> <tantra> Shamelessness through commitment deity.
[3303] <prose> <tantra> Shamelessness through master, disciples, and friends.
[3304] <prose> <tantra> Shamelessness through one's own mind.
[3305] <prose> <tantra> Deity and yogi are also oneself.
[3306] <prose> <tantra> Desiring the manner of brother and friend.
[3307] <prose> <tantra> Meditating on deity and maṇḍala as non-dual with self.
[3308] <prose> <tantra> Deity also arises from self and dissolves into self.
[3309] <prose> <tantra> Desiring the radiation and gathering of self and deity.
[3310] <prose> <tantra> Thus."
[3311] <prose><tantra> The seventh: The presentation of the mahāyoga Tantra vehicle—surpassing the lower. || 250 ||
[3312] <prose> The explanation of the supreme vehicle itself, divided into two.
