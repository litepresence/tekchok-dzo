[7325] Without middle interval, gradually,
[7326] The manner of completing empowerments,
[7327] For those who become supreme—
[7328] This is extremely rare.
[7329] In the interval of days, months, and years,
[7330] Suitable to self-experience,
[7331] Complete the four empowerments.
[7332] If the four empowerments not complete,
[7333] The extremely non-elaboration empowerment,
[7334] The field of realizing profound parts,
[7335] By bestowing this, empowerment is obtained.
[7336] Having excellently examined the student's characteristics,

[7346] Thus it is spoken.
[7347] From the Empowerment King Tantra:
[7348] "To the ripening guru of empowerment,
[7349] Supreme offering of gold and silver,

[7354] Thus it is spoken.
[7355] From the Empowerment Jewel Tantra:
[7356] "Result easy and effortless,
[7357] Mind-generate awakening completed,
[7358] Called guru for fulfilling needs and desires,
[7359] Definitely similar to the cow of desires."

[7361] That also, after empowerment, by making offering and celebration,
[7362] Here also obtaining the perfections of self-desired meaning,
[7363] And in future time, perfections of power


### PAGE 182

[7364] Obtain qualities of glory and goodness,
[7365] After that, manifestly perfect awakening in the ornament-arranged field.
[7366] Thus also, from the Empowerment Infinite:
[7367] "Completing the meanings of desire,
[7368] Glory, fame, and wisdom,
[7369] Giving excellent power,
[7370] In the well-arranged Buddha-field,
[7371] Manifestly perfect awakening."
[7372] Thus it is spoken.
[7373] That also, rather than gathering numberless accumulations at another time,
[7374] At this time, the gathered increases by a hundred-thousand-fold.
[7375] By that power, all meanings of mind are accomplished here,
[7376] And without difficulty arises the definite accomplishment of special gatherings of food, wealth, etc.

[7379] "The fortunate one who relied on empowerment,
[7380] Result of completed two accumulations,
[7381] Definitely obtains the meaning of the two supreme."
[7382] Thus it is spoken.
[7383] At this time, having offered to the root guru food, drink, wealth, etc., each one,
[7384] And having offered hundreds at another time, the merit of offering here is great.
[7385] The merit of giving to one woman at this time,
[7386] And giving to one man,
[7387] And elsewhere, the merit of having done great feast offerings to a hundred ḍākinīs—
[7388] Giving these two at this time to one is superior.
[7389] That also, at this time, all Buddhas of the ten directions gathered compassion into one,
[7390] Doing the action of empowerment, turning the unsurpassed wheel,
[7391] Entering self into the town of great liberation—by superior kindness;
[7392] Also to women and men,
[7393] Heroes and heroines with support, abiding in the row of empowerment through compassion and samaya, giving blessing—
[7394] The two times of empowerment and celebration increase by a hundred-thousand-fold compared to others.  [7394] Thus also:

[8015] "Teaching empowerment form of two:
[8016] Realization wisdom empowerment,
[8017] Not-realization sign empowerment."
[8018] Thus it is spoken.
[8019] Here there are two forms:

[8058] Completion wrathful empowerment.
[8059] Secret-mark vajra empowerment also empower,
[8060] Command-sign scripture empowerment.

[8074] Empowering outer: sentient beings' appearance,
[8075] Empowering inner: meditation mind-holding.

[8105] Thus it is spoken.
[8106] That also: conventionally said as "empowering" through guru's introduction to empowerment existing primordially in self.
[8107] Empower those meanings' realization into practice.


### PAGE 196

[8109] Accomplishing as said,
[8110] Those who have not obtained siddhi accomplish meaning by empowering that all combined.
[8111] From that arrangement of four empowerments:
