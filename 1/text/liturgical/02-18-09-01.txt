[5085] <prose>First is: bind body speech main-point, wind mind relax from latency;</prose>
[5086] <prose>inner samādhi pervades luminous-clear empty state,</prose>
[5087] <prose>and spacious knowing, grasp-hold not-existing, pleasure happiness vast, arise spread-desire, though not-existing attachment grasp, even hair-tip, arise from arriving at nature meditation main-point.</prose>
[5088] <prose>Fabricated meditation: pleasure happiness arise, great experience change, coarse throb or song dance desire arise, cause attachment grasp to go.</prose>
[5089] <prose>This: though dawn pleasure happiness, also self-power obtain pleasure happiness, grasp not-existing, knowing difference existing, fabricated meditate.</prose>
[5090] <prose>Know difference of meditation arriving at nature wind.</prose>
[5091] <prose>End change experience: wind experience vision part is:</prose>
[5092] <verse>—Like firefly,</verse>
[5093] <verse>—like cloud,</verse>
[5094] <verse>—like smoke,</verse> || 10 ||
[5095] <verse>—like haze,</verse>
[5096] <verse>—like moon dawn,</verse>
[5097] <verse>—like star dawn,</verse>
[5098] <verse>—like sky brightening, blue vision existing,</verse>
[5099] <verse>—like sun dawn, outer inner unimpeded vision—</verse>
[5100] <verse>eight.</verse>
[5101] <prose>Become clear dim and dawn cease cause: not firm, cannot stand, change go—called end change experience, cause is wind moving experience.</prose>
[5102] <prose>These do existing, need purify wind mind.</prose>
[5103] <prose>Vision experience is: great awareness self-resonance luminous-clear.</prose>
[5104] <prose>Occasion: outer vision increases, from arriving at measure; self-resonance dissolves into base, reverse inner, only outer clear need; cause need dissolve into spontaneous-completion pure dhātu.</prose> || 20 ||
[5105] <prose>Inner clear: in self-light expanse, awareness body wisdom palace, originally abide spontaneous-completion great, not-existing change.</prose>
[5106] <prose>Therefore here: vision experience is chief.</prose>
[5107] <prose>Knowing experience: is intellect, change, cannot stand measure, all-conceptual conventional appearance possessor, remember doer difference, near-side concept gather cause.</prose>
[5108] <prose>Do measure this: similar to bird doing hide cover, place measure in cloud.</prose>
[5109] <prose>Time not existing to realize meaning, see self-point not arrive.</prose>
[5110] <prose>This: vision experience, see wisdom five color vision, transcend half end of samsāra action, grasp field vision.</prose>
[5111] <prose>See dhātu vision: that above, not existing grasp concept part half, grasp empty extreme wrong cause, transcend two-thirds samsāra part.</prose>
[5112] <prose>Self-purify all-concept base ground, grasp part half, grasp vision self-characteristic wrong cause,</prose>
[5113] <prose>called person and dharmas grasp-hold self not-existing concept.</prose>
[5114] <prose>Briefly: all vision experiences—wisdom five color vision, and dhātu vision, two gather.</prose> || 30 ||
[5115] <prose>Above increase is: go those visions more beautiful, more good, more many.</prose>
[5116] <prose>General show this purify manner, and particular explain vision manner—two from:</prose>
[5117] <prose>First is: apply samsāra liberate manner from binding;</prose>
[5118] <prose>that vision: up-stand, and wing dawn,</prose>
[5119] <prose>and boat-part, and part, and cloth vision—five complete, from obtaining power of wisdom five color.</prose>
[5120] <prose>Liberate from binding: five manifest move—desire, aversion, delusion, pride, jealousy.</prose>
[5121] <prose>Cause not existing other than latency only, itself transcend samsāra half.</prose>
[5122] <prose>Then: net form, and net half, and eye many line, and like eye spot form, and see like canopy tent house—</prose>
[5123] <prose>transcend from self made by form and so forth aggregate five collection.</prose>
[5124] <prose>Transcend world self three two, pure blessing of dharmatā view.</prose> || 40 ||
