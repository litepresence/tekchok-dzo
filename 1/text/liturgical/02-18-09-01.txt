[5085] <prose>First is: bind body speech main-point, wind mind relax from latency;
[5086] <prose>inner samādhi pervades luminous-clear empty state,
[5087] <prose>and spacious knowing, grasp-hold not-existing, pleasure happiness vast, arise spread-desire, though not-existing attachment grasp, even hair-tip, arise from arriving at nature meditation main-point.
[5088] <prose>Fabricated meditation: pleasure happiness arise, great experience change, coarse throb or song dance desire arise, cause attachment grasp to go.
[5089] <prose>This: though dawn pleasure happiness, also self-power obtain pleasure happiness, grasp not-existing, knowing difference existing, fabricated meditate.
[5090] <prose>Know difference of meditation arriving at nature wind.
[5091] <prose>End change experience: wind experience vision part is:
[5092] <verse>—Like firefly,
[5093] <verse>—like cloud,
[5094] <verse>—like smoke, || 10 ||
[5095] <verse>—like haze,
[5096] <verse>—like moon dawn,
[5097] <verse>—like star dawn,
[5098] <verse>—like sky brightening, blue vision existing,
[5099] <verse>—like sun dawn, outer inner unimpeded vision—
[5100] <verse>eight.
[5101] <prose>Become clear dim and dawn cease cause: not firm, cannot stand, change go—called end change experience, cause is wind moving experience.
[5102] <prose>These do existing, need purify wind mind.
[5103] <prose>Vision experience is: great awareness self-resonance luminous-clear.
[5104] <prose>Occasion: outer vision increases, from arriving at measure; self-resonance dissolves into base, reverse inner, only outer clear need; cause need dissolve into spontaneous-completion pure dhātu. || 20 ||
[5105] <prose>Inner clear: in self-light expanse, awareness body wisdom palace, originally abide spontaneous-completion great, not-existing change.
[5106] <prose>Therefore here: vision experience is chief.
[5107] <prose>Knowing experience: is intellect, change, cannot stand measure, all-conceptual conventional appearance possessor, remember doer difference, near-side concept gather cause.
[5108] <prose>Do measure this: similar to bird doing hide cover, place measure in cloud.
[5109] <prose>Time not existing to realize meaning, see self-point not arrive.
[5110] <prose>This: vision experience, see wisdom five color vision, transcend half end of samsāra action, grasp field vision.
[5111] <prose>See dhātu vision: that above, not existing grasp concept part half, grasp empty extreme wrong cause, transcend two-thirds samsāra part.
[5112] <prose>Self-purify all-concept base ground, grasp part half, grasp vision self-characteristic wrong cause,
[5113] <prose>called person and dharmas grasp-hold self not-existing concept.
[5114] <prose>Briefly: all vision experiences—wisdom five color vision, and dhātu vision, two gather. || 30 ||
[5115] <prose>Above increase is: go those visions more beautiful, more good, more many.
[5116] <prose>General show this purify manner, and particular explain vision manner—two from:
[5117] <prose>First is: apply samsāra liberate manner from binding;
[5118] <prose>that vision: up-stand, and wing dawn,
[5119] <prose>and boat-part, and part, and cloth vision—five complete, from obtaining power of wisdom five color.
[5120] <prose>Liberate from binding: five manifest move—desire, aversion, delusion, pride, jealousy.
[5121] <prose>Cause not existing other than latency only, itself transcend samsāra half.
[5122] <prose>Then: net form, and net half, and eye many line, and like eye spot form, and see like canopy tent house—
[5123] <prose>transcend from self made by form and so forth aggregate five collection.
[5124] <prose>Transcend world self three two, pure blessing of dharmatā view. || 40 ||
