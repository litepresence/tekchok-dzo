[12011] The first also arises from that, the last also must be delivered to that nature's state. In the space of primordial purity there is no intermediate state; that self does not depend on other dharmas before or after, nor is entry into anyone's interval possible, for it transcends the limits of transfer-change and appearance-emptiness.
[12012] From the Thal-logical Result:
[12013] In the primordial purity of the beginning,
[12014] The ground of confusion cannot be expressed;
[12015] Likewise, what of the unconfused?
[12016] This point too, if wisdom exists, is of great import.
[12017] Second, the etymology: "intermediate" (bar) is expressed from the aspect of being the center dharma of any upper, lower, before, or after—like the intermediate state of dream existing between going toward sleep and waking. "Ma" indicates center. "Do" (two) dwells in the center like a connecting rope joining beginning and end—the connecting rope of the center of two.
[12018] Third, divisions: from common and uncommon. From some common vehicles, birth-death intermediate state, dream intermediate state, dharmata intermediate state, existence intermediate state, and so forth are desired. In this uncommon vehicle, the secret king, four are regarded: nature intermediate state, death-time intermediate state, dharmata intermediate state, and existence intermediate state.
[12019] From the Thal-logical Result:
[12020] Such is the dharmata of intermediate state,
[12021] The greatly secret dharmata explained;
[12022] Divided, from four aspects—thus.
[12023] Fourth, appearance-pattern: from two. First, as shown generally: appearance in the general aspect of the three realms is desired as the manifestation of grasping-grasped, attachment-aversion, and afflictions; the subtle, form, and formless.
[12024] Appearance in each of the six realms individually: in one cause-water, by gods as nectar, etc. From the Two Truths:
[12025] Mind alone differentiates things,
[12026] Thus sees objects as unestablished.
[12027] For an individual in the category of doors, to one donor many enemies and friends appear.

[12055] Ground-boundary of nature-remaining intermediate state.
[12056] Death-time intermediate state.
[12057] Dharmatā intermediate state.
[12058] Existence intermediate state.
[12059] First, ground-boundary of nature-remaining:
[12060] The nature remaining as the ground of all,
[12061] Primordially pure, spontaneously present.
[12062] Thus the ground-boundary of nature-remaining.
[12063] Second, death-time intermediate state:
[12064] From the moment of death until the clear light,
[12065] The dissolution of elements and consciousness.
[12066] Thus the death-time intermediate state.
[12067] Third, dharmatā intermediate state:
[12068] The clear light of dharmatā dawning,
[12069] Recognition brings liberation.
[12070] Thus the dharmatā intermediate state.
[12071] Fourth, existence intermediate state:
[12072] From the dharmatā clear light until conception,
[12073] The wandering in the bardo of becoming.
[12074] Thus the existence intermediate state.
[12075] Herein, the duration:
[12076] The death-time lasts until the clear light.
[12077] The dharmatā lasts a maximum of four days.
[12078] The existence lasts a maximum of forty-nine days.
[12079] Thus the duration of intermediate states.
[12080] Herein, the appearances:
[12081] In death-time: dissolution of elements.  [12028] In dharmatā: clear light dawning.  [12029] In existence: karmic visions arising.  [12030] Thus the appearances.  [12031] Herein, the liberation:  [12032] In death-time: through recognition of dissolution.  [12033] In dharmatā: through recognition of clear light.  [12034] In existence: through recognition of illusory nature.  [12035] Thus liberation in intermediate states.  [12036] Herein, the preparation:  [12037] Through hearing, contemplating, and meditating,  [12038] Recognition is prepared for death and bardo.  [12039] Thus the preparation.  [12040] Herein, the importance:  [12041] Without preparation, wandering continues.  [12042] With preparation, liberation is certain.  [12043] Thus the importance of preparation.  [12044] Thus the four intermediate states are explained.  [12045] Thus the instructions on intermediate states are complete.


### PAGE 279

[12082] By meaning, separating inanimate from consciousness, remaining in death-fearing suffering.
[12083] The appearance of the dharmata intermediate state: abandoning the support of aggregate self-grasping, body and wisdom's dharmata appears manifest; karma and latent-tendency's connection cut, enjoying the dharmata of nature-meditation; faculty grasp-doer's object empty, exercising in the dharmata of self-appearance clear-light.
[12084] The appearance of the existence intermediate state: outer body's existence as mind-body with all faculties complete goes unobstructed; inner mind's existence thinking in many think-doers, mind enters; body and mind's gathered existence goes unobstructed in all except the two supports, mind loose.
[12085] The two supports: the vajra seat accomplished from blessing, and the mother's womb.
[12086] Therein, most masters identify the vajra seat as that in India, but here it is desired as that in which all buddhas abide in the door of liberation from suffering in the supreme place of buddhahood in the inner space of primordially-pure unchangeable. The mother's womb is desired as the impure door of samsara in any of the six realms' birth-places; know that this is not the literal meaning.
[12087] Generally, sutra places have two: provisional meaning and definitive meaning; intention and indirect intention—bound by four manners. Tantra section places have two on top of that: literal and not literal—know these bound by six limits.
[12088] These too from the Thal-logical Result:
[12089] Intermediate state's appearance:
[12090] Nature-remaining aggregates and
[12091] Elements and afflictions appear as objects,
[12092] Death-time's mist-gloom rising,
[12093] Consciousness not remaining as one.
[12094] Dharmata intermediate state: body and
[12095] Wisdom, light and color,
[12096] Drops expanding and elements appearing,
[12097] Whatever appears: dharmata's measured palace.
[12098] Existence's appearance flickering,
[12099] Flashing like dream appearance,
[12100] True-appearance false, mind's object,
[12101] White-mist etc., six races' light,
[12102] Each individual's focused object appears—thus.
[12103] Fifth, ground-boundary: from four.

[12121] The ground boundary of the intermediate state of remaining in nature is from exiting the mother's womb until struck by the disease of the final death condition.
[12122] From there until breath is cut by gasping is the death-time intermediate state.
[12123] From inner breath being cut, clear light arises; the interval of spontaneously accomplished appearance is the dharmatā intermediate state.
[12124] From there, spontaneously accomplished dissolves, appearing like flashing dreams until entering the mother's womb is the ground boundary of the existence intermediate state.
[12125] These introductions shown at the final time of death are called the instruction of giving a robe-shake to the traveler crossing.
[12126] That traveler has entered the path of death.
[12127] The suffering of death is great,
[12128] And if the various path appearances are not known as own-appearance, there is danger of arising as enemies.
[12129] If known, there is danger of appearing as helpers.
[12130] To hit that shake at death,
[12131] Is called the instruction of hitting with robe-shake; the example and meaning fit.
[12132] These are the general establishment of the intermediate state.
[12133] There is need to divide in half for ease.
[12134] Second, regarding the extensive explanation of individual natures, there are four:
[12135] For the intermediate state of nature, the tone-instruction like entering a box with rope cut, deciding the class of knowables,
[12136] For the death-time intermediate state, the instruction like looking in a beautiful woman's mirror, giving clarity to what is unclear,
[12137] For the dharmatā intermediate state, the instruction like meeting a familiar person or a child entering the mother's lap through confidence in own-appearance,
[12138] For the existence intermediate state, the instruction like inserting a fox into a broken fox hole through the continuity of karma.
[12139] First:
[12140] Before doing the entering-box, examine whether caught or not caught by the enemy of harm; without harm, with the box ready, whenever entering that box later, no need to cut superimpositions, without doubt,
[12141] And without obstruction or attachment, entering like that yogin, first desiring liberation from saṃsāra, examining which method is profound and which point is great, abandoning three—deciding the limit of that Dharma of self-confidence, entering with doubt, and not arriving at the beginning.


### PAGE 281

[12142] First, cultivate the mind through hearing.
[12143] In the middle, decide through contemplation.
[12144] Finally, repeating with meditation, making the mind at ease is like approaching the box.
[12145] Like entering the box, settling meanings, entering at death without danger or fear.
[12146] The meanings of these were extensively shown before.
[12147] Here, explaining slightly in condensed practice:
[12148] Looking at outer appearance, seeing the appearing object like an illusory confusion mandala,
[12149] When seeing only the self-form of groundless emptiness,
[12150] All dharmas appearing variously as the mirror of view, meditation, and conduct have arisen from the beginning.
[12151] For it is the self-power of dharmatā's ceaseless play arising.
[12152] Also, looking at the various white and red appearing like eating under a garment house,
[12153] When seeing whatever appears, whatever arises, whatever is heard, all as the play of self-dissolved emptiness, without hand to correct or discard the blockage of appearance,
[12154] Appearance liberates from the ground of appearance, confusion liberates as groundless, arising only as the peak of illusion, liberated from saṃsāra of grasping outer objects.
[12155] The dharmas—pieces of mountains, excellent-born women, etc.—whatever first arises as appearing object, cut in pieces, put greatly wherever it appears,
[12156] Without entering the great consciousness as investigator,
[12157] Appearance is not changed by mind.
[12158] Mind is not seized by appearance; dissolve in self-place.
[12159] Without preventing the six consciousness groups, putting in self-place, dharmatā appearance arises spontaneously.
[12160] Thus looking at outer dharmas, when knowing as the self-form of objectless emptiness, grasping is pure like objectless space.
[12161] This is called realizing grasping as without nature.
[12162] Thus looking at the consciousness of the outer looker,
[12163] Moving dissolves in emptiness without outline,
[12164] When realizing as self-clear without sudden dissolving,
[12165] Realizing inner dharmatā as great without birth, cessation, or ground,
[12166] Grasping spreads as self-dissolved in the nature of supportless sky-like state.
[12167] In supportless ye re.


### PAGE 282

[12168] Remaining in direct penetration,
[12169] Pervading without truth,
[12170] Fixed without root.
[12171] In the nature of the great equalness of dharmatā, smiling ge, put with joy.
[12172] There is need for the twist-nail of grasping mind to come out.
[12173] Thus when realizing object and mind as groundless and root-free,
[12174] The secret self-awareness of grasping-grasped, free from elaboration, goes to remaining.
[12175] When meditating in the nature of clear light without gathering or separating space-awareness through the four lamps of introduction by the master's word to the great self-clear primordial purity,
[12176] The five lights of outer space-appearance self-radiance are clear like form-reflections inside a mirror.
[12177] Though aspects appear outer, essence remains inner.
[12178] Knowing appearance-emptiness like water-moon form-reflections,
[12179] Do not do grasping attachment of joy-play in appearance.
[12180] Looking far in the clear light of outer appearance,
[12181] Inner awareness clear light clears near.
[12182] Awareness, free from meditation mind and antidote, wide view of pure vast nature,
[12183] Clear meditation of self-descended nature-remaining,
[12184] Without accepting or rejecting in clear light conduct,
[12185] Through obtaining the fruit of primordially pure self-clear,
[12186] Abandon delusion appearance without abandoning,
[12187] Block delusion thought without preventing,
[12188] Pure without training dual-grasping,
[12189] Pure from the beginning without abandoning faults,
[12190] Spontaneously accomplished qualities without seeking.
[12191] The meaning of complete liberation of the three realms,
[12192] Transcending the object of view,
[12193] Transcending the mind of meditation,
[12194] Transcending the calculation of conduct,
[12195] Transcending the Dharma of result,
[12196] In the fortune of emptying saṃsāra,
[12197] The field of dharmatā manifest appearance is spacious.
[12198] In the good circle of the land of the source of bliss,
[12199] Having obtained the self-arisen palace according to desire,
[12200] With the first lord, the King of Unchanging Light,
[12201] And the five-light spontaneously accomplished queen gathered,
[12202] The supreme inconceivable holy child-appearance meets his own father and mother.
[12203] It is called the time of obtaining the eternal establishment of inseparable joy-bliss.
[12204] The extensive scripture of these was shown before.


### PAGE 283

[12205] Doing certainty by clear situation, from Sun-Moon Union:
[12206] Exclamation! Conqueror, you listen:
[12207] By condensing all those,
[12208] The drop remaining as one is obtained.
[12209] And what and what are they?
[12210] By putting, self-spread is obtained;
[12211] By intentions, time is shown;
[12212] By exhaust-patterns, intention is shown;
[12213] By stable confidence, the not-turning sign.
[12214] Thus meanings are condensed.
[12215] These are that result:
[12216] Who sees the space-lamp
[12217] Manifestly exercises in dharma-space;
[12218] Who sees the drop-lamp
[12219] Obtains the hope-base of those with effort;
[12220] Who sees the wisdom-lamp
[12221] Realizes general and self-characteristic;
[12222] Who sees the water-lamp
[12223] Obtains power over faculties;
[12224] Who is habituated in lu-gu-rgyud,
[12225] Awarenesses obtain balance.
[12226] By that result of three bodies,
[12227] All these are self-awareness ground.
[12228] In the intermediate state of nature-remaining,
[12229] The birth-being habituated to these,
[12230] All elements as self-vanish,
[12231] Become in this without doubt.
[12232] These dharmas I proclaimed,
[12233] All sutras and tantras here condensed—thus extensively said.
[12234] Second, the eightfold instruction like a beautiful woman looking in a mirror for giving clarity to unclear in the death-time intermediate state: thinking the cause of certain death with many examples, examining death's signs, showing reversal methods, showing death-time appearance, showing giving instruction, showing birth-place signs, showing purifying rites, showing other uncommon places.
[12235] First has three: training in dharma without opportunity for leisure-freedom by thinking on the difficult-to-obtain manner; showing the rite of training; producing definite-emerge and weariness always by thinking on continuous cause of certain decay; meditating on profound empty meaning at need-time by thinking on example of certain death.
