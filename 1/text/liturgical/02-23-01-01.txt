<ornament> [12011] Thus it abides—present now in the outer and inner expanse of manifestation.
<ornament> [12012] The end too must be delivered to that nature's own state.

<verse> [12013] In the expanse of primordial purity, no intermediate state exists;
<verse> [12014] That very self depends not on other dharmas, before or after—
<verse> [12015] Nor can entry into any interval occur,
<verse> [12015] For it transcends the limits of transfer-change and appearance-emptiness.

<tantra> [12016] From the Thalgyur Tantra:
<tantra> [12017] "In primordial purity from the very beginning,
<tantra> [12018] The ground of confusion cannot be expressed;
<tantra> [12019] If so, what of the unconfused?
<tantra> [12020] Thus it is spoken."

[12021] This point, if wisdom exists, carries great import.

[12022] Second, the etymology: "intermediate" (bar) is expressed from the aspect of being the central dharma of any upper, lower, before, or after—like the intermediate state of dream existing between going toward sleep and waking.

[12023] "Ma" indicates the center.

[12024] "Do" (two) dwells in the center like a connecting rope joining beginning and end—even as the connecting rope at the center of two.

[12025] Third, regarding divisions: from common and uncommon perspectives.

[12026] From some common vehicles, the birth-death intermediate state, dream intermediate state, dharmatā intermediate state, existence intermediate state, and so forth are asserted.

[12027] In this uncommon vehicle, the Secret King, four are regarded:
<list> [12028] First: the nature-remaining intermediate state (rang bzhin gnas pa'i bar do)
<list> [12029] Second: the death-time intermediate state ('chi kha'i bar do)
<list> [12030] Third: the dharmatā intermediate state (chos nyid kyi bar do)
<list> [12031] Fourth: the existence intermediate state (srid pa'i bar do)

<tantra> [12032] From the Thalgyur Tantra:
<tantra> [12033] "Such is the dharmatā of intermediate state,
<tantra> [12034] The greatly secret dharmatā explained;
<tantra> [12035] Divided, from four aspects—thus."

[12036] Fourth, regarding appearance-patterns: from two perspectives.

[12037] First, as shown generally: appearance in the general aspect of the three realms is asserted as the manifestation of grasping-grasped, attachment-aversion, and afflictions—the subtle, form, and formless.

[12038] Appearance in each of the six realms individually: in one cause-water, by gods as nectar, by hell-beings as molten bronze, and so forth.

<tantra> [12039] From the Two Truths:
<tantra> [12040] "Mind alone differentiates things,
<tantra> [12041] Thus sees objects as unestablished."

[12042] For an individual in the category of specific doors, to one donor many enemies and friends appear.

[12043] From the appearance of pleasure and pain, confusion and non-confusion,
[12044] Attachment and aversion, good and bad,
[12045] Dharma and non-dharma, and so forth—
[12046] Various appearances arise as different cause-effect actions for future good and evil karma.

[12047] In brief, whatever appears to anyone is like the various good and bad dreams of last night:
[12048] Though appearing, they are unestablished—existing clearly as emptiness without existence.

[12049] Second, the detailed explanation of the four:

<list> [12050] First, the appearance of the nature-remaining intermediate state:
<list> [12051] Bound by the five aggregates of form and so forth, the appearance of the five kāyas self-dissolves;
<list> [12052] Bound by elements and sense-sources, the appearance of light and color self-dissolves;
<list> [12053] Bound by karma and afflictions, the appearance of pristine cognition and dharmatā self-dissolves.

[12054] Through grasping at outer appearance with inner apprehending mind,
[12055] One wanders day and night in the depths of the difficult-to-cross rivers of the four perversions,
[12056] Engaging with much karma and latent tendencies.

[12057] The four perversions, not knowing the nature of samsaric confusion-appearance like dreams and illusions:
<list> [12058] Holding the impermanent as permanent,
<list> [12059] Holding the unreal as real,
<list> [12060] Holding the cause of suffering as pleasure,
<list> [12061] Holding what is empty by nature as entities and marks.

[12062] As antidotes to these, the Blessed One taught the Four Dharmas for guiding ordinary individual beings.

[12063] The appearance of the death-time intermediate state:
[12064] Through the disturbance of the body's elements, one experiences the suffering of the outer body;
[12065] Through the loss of the mental factor's feeling-path, one experiences the suffering of the inner mind;
[12066] Through the collapse of the ocean of grasping's latent tendencies, one experiences the suffering of separating from this life's appearances though attached;
[12067] Through remembering non-virtuous karma of harming others, one experiences the suffering of fear of falling into bad migrations;
[12068] Through the body of cherished grasping being dissolved, one experiences the suffering of fear that the citadel of the aggregate support has collapsed.

[12069] Thus remaining in the suffering of fearing death through separating the inanimate from consciousness by meaning.

[12070] The appearance of the dharmatā intermediate state:
[12071] Abandoning the support of aggregate self-grasping, the dharmatā of body and wisdom appears manifest;
[12072] The connection of karma and latent tendencies cut, one enjoys the dharmatā of nature-meditation;
[12073] The object of faculty and grasping-doer empty, one exercises in the dharmatā of self-appearance clear-light.

[12074] The appearance of the existence intermediate state:
[12075] The outer body's existence as mind-body with all faculties complete goes unobstructed;
[12076] The inner mind's existence thinking in many think-doers, mind enters;
[12077] The gathered existence of body and mind goes unobstructed in all except the two supports—mind loose.

[12078] The two supports: the vajra seat accomplished from blessing, and the mother's womb.

[12079] Therein, most masters identify the vajra seat as that in India, but here it is asserted as that in which all buddhas abide in the door of liberation from suffering in the supreme place of buddhahood in the inner space of primordially-pure unchangeable.

[12080] The mother's womb is asserted as the impure door of samsara in any of the six realms' birth-places—know that this is not the literal meaning.

[12081] Generally, sutra places have two: provisional meaning and definitive meaning;
[12082] Intention and indirect intention—bound by four manners.
[12083] Tantra section places have two on top of that: literal and not literal—know these bound by six limits.

<tantra> [12084] These too from the Thalgyur Tantra:
<tantra> [12085] "Intermediate state's appearance:
<tantra> [12086] Nature-remaining aggregates and
<tantra> [12087] Elements and afflictions appear as objects,
<tantra> [12088] Death-time's mist-gloom rising,
<tantra> [12089] Consciousness not remaining as one.
<tantra> [12090] Dharmatā intermediate state: body and
<tantra> [12091] Wisdom, light and color,
<tantra> [12092] Drops expanding and elements appearing,
<tantra> [12093] Whatever appears: dharmatā's measured palace.
<tantra> [12094] Existence's appearance flickering,
<tantra> [12095] Flashing like dream appearance,
<tantra> [12096] True-appearance false, mind's object,
<tantra> [12097] White-mist etc., six races' light,
<tantra> [12098] Each individual's focused object appears—thus."

[12099] Fifth, the ground-boundaries: from four.

[12100] The ground boundary of the nature-remaining intermediate state is from exiting the mother's womb until struck by the disease of the final death condition.

[12101] From there until breath is cut by gasping is the death-time intermediate state.

[12102] From inner breath being cut, clear light arises; the interval of spontaneously accomplished appearance is the dharmatā intermediate state.

[12103] From there, spontaneously accomplished dissolves, appearing like flashing dreams until entering the mother's womb is the ground boundary of the existence intermediate state.

[12104] These introductions shown at the final time of death are called the instruction of giving a robe-shake to the traveler crossing.

[12105] That traveler has entered the path of death.

<verse> [12106] The suffering of death is great,
<verse> [12107] And if the various path appearances are not known as own-appearance, there is danger of arising as enemies.
<verse> [12108] If known, there is danger of appearing as helpers.
<verse> [12109] To hit that shake at death,
<verse> [12110] Is called the instruction of hitting with robe-shake; the example and meaning fit.

[12111] These are the general establishment of the intermediate state.

[12112] There is need to divide in half for ease.

[12113] Second, regarding the extensive explanation of individual natures, there are four:

<list> [12114] For the nature-remaining intermediate state, the tone-instruction like entering a box with rope cut, deciding the class of knowables;
<list> [12115] For the death-time intermediate state, the instruction like looking in a beautiful woman's mirror, giving clarity to what is unclear;
<list> [12116] For the dharmatā intermediate state, the instruction like meeting a familiar person or a child entering the mother's lap through confidence in own-appearance;
<list> [12117] For the existence intermediate state, the instruction like inserting a fox into a broken fox hole through the continuity of karma.

[12118] First:

[12119] Before doing the entering-box, examine whether caught or not caught by the enemy of harm; without harm, with the box ready, whenever entering that box later, no need to cut superimpositions, without doubt,

[12120] And without obstruction or attachment, entering like that yogin, first desiring liberation from samsara, examining which method is profound and which point is great, abandoning three—deciding the limit of that Dharma of self-confidence, entering with doubt, and not arriving at the beginning.

[12121] First, cultivate the mind through hearing.

[12122] In the middle, decide through contemplation.

[12123] Finally, repeating with meditation, making the mind at ease is like approaching the box.

[12124] Like entering the box, settling meanings, entering at death without danger or fear.

[12125] The meanings of these were extensively shown before.

[12126] Here, explaining slightly in condensed practice:

[12127] Looking at outer appearance, seeing the appearing object like an illusory confusion mandala,

[12128] When seeing only the self-form of groundless emptiness,

[12129] All dharmas appearing variously as the mirror of view, meditation, and conduct have arisen from the beginning.

[12130] For it is the self-power of dharmatā's ceaseless play arising.

[12131] Also, looking at the various white and red appearing like eating under a garment house,

[12132] When seeing whatever appears, whatever arises, whatever is heard, all as the play of self-dissolved emptiness, without hand to correct or discard the blockage of appearance,

[12133] Appearance liberates from the ground of appearance, confusion liberates as groundless, arising only as the peak of illusion, liberated from samsara of grasping outer objects.

[12134] The dharmas—pieces of mountains, excellent-born women, etc.—whatever first arises as appearing object, cut in pieces, put greatly wherever it appears,

[12135] Without entering the great consciousness as investigator,

[12136] Appearance is not changed by mind.

[12137] Mind is not seized by appearance; dissolve in self-place.

[12138] Without preventing the six consciousness groups, putting in self-place, dharmatā appearance arises spontaneously.

[12139] Thus looking at outer dharmas, when knowing as the self-form of objectless emptiness, grasping is pure like objectless space.

[12140] This is called realizing grasping as without nature.

[12141] Thus looking at the consciousness of the outer looker,

[12142] Moving dissolves in emptiness without outline,

[12143] When realizing as self-clear without sudden dissolving,

[12144] Realizing inner dharmatā as great without birth, cessation, or ground,

[12145] Grasping spreads as self-dissolved in the nature of supportless sky-like state.

[12146] In supportless ye re.

[12147] Remaining in direct penetration,

[12148] Pervading without truth,

[12149] Fixed without root.

[12150] In the nature of the great equalness of dharmatā, smiling ge, put with joy.

[12151] There is need for the twist-nail of grasping mind to come out.

[12152] Thus when realizing object and mind as groundless and root-free,

[12153] The secret self-awareness of grasping-grasped, free from elaboration, goes to remaining.

[12154] When meditating in the nature of clear light without gathering or separating space-awareness through the four lamps of introduction by the master's word to the great self-clear primordial purity,

[12155] The five lights of outer space-appearance self-radiance are clear like form-reflections inside a mirror.

[12156] Though aspects appear outer, essence remains inner.

[12157] Knowing appearance-emptiness like water-moon form-reflections,

[12158] Do not do grasping attachment of joy-play in appearance.

[12159] Looking far in the clear light of outer appearance,

[12160] Inner awareness clear light clears near.

[12161] Awareness, free from meditation mind and antidote, wide view of pure vast nature,

[12162] Clear meditation of self-descended nature-remaining,

[12163] Without accepting or rejecting in clear light conduct,

[12164] Through obtaining the fruit of primordially pure self-clear,

[12165] Abandon delusion appearance without abandoning,

[12166] Block delusion thought without preventing,

[12167] Pure without training dual-grasping,

[12168] Pure from the beginning without abandoning faults,

[12169] Spontaneously accomplished qualities without seeking.

<verse> [12170] The meaning of complete liberation of the three realms,
<verse> [12171] Transcending the object of view,
<verse> [12172] Transcending the mind of meditation,
<verse> [12173] Transcending the calculation of conduct,
<verse> [12174] Transcending the Dharma of result,
<verse> [12175] In the fortune of emptying samsara,
<verse> [12176] The field of dharmatā manifest appearance is spacious.

<verse> [12177] In the good circle of the land of the source of bliss,
<verse> [12178] Having obtained the self-arisen palace according to desire,
<verse> [12179] With the first lord, the King of Unchanging Light,
<verse> [12180] And the five-light spontaneously accomplished queen gathered,
<verse> [12181] The supreme inconceivable holy child-appearance meets his own father and mother.

[12182] It is called the time of obtaining the eternal establishment of inseparable joy-bliss.

[12183] The extensive scripture of these was shown before.

[12184] Doing certainty by clear situation, from Sun-Moon Union:

<tantra> [12185] Exclamation! Conqueror, you listen:
<tantra> [12186] By condensing all those,
<tantra> [12187] The drop remaining as one is obtained.
<tantra> [12188] And what and what are they?
<tantra> [12189] By putting, self-spread is obtained;
<tantra> [12190] By intentions, time is shown;
<tantra> [12191] By exhaust-patterns, intention is shown;
<tantra> [12192] By stable confidence, the not-turning sign.

[12193] Thus meanings are condensed.

<verse> [12194] These are that result:
<verse> [12195] Who sees the space-lamp
<verse> [12196] Manifestly exercises in dharma-space;
<verse> [12197] Who sees the drop-lamp
<verse> [12198] Obtains the hope-base of those with effort;
<verse> [12199] Who sees the wisdom-lamp
<verse> [12200] Realizes general and self-characteristic;
<verse> [12201] Who sees the water-lamp
<verse> [12202] Obtains power over faculties;
<verse> [12203] Who is habituated in lu-gu-rgyud,
<verse> [12204] Awarenesses obtain balance.

<verse> [12205] By that result of three bodies,
<verse> [12206] All these are self-awareness ground.
<verse> [12207] In the intermediate state of nature-remaining,
<verse> [12208] The birth-being habituated to these,
<verse> [12209] All elements as self-vanish,
<verse> [12210] Become in this without doubt.

<tantra> [12211] These dharmas I proclaimed,
<tantra> [12212] All sutras and tantras here condensed—
<tantra> [12213] Thus extensively said.
