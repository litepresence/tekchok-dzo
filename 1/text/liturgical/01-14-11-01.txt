[20147] <list> First: Ground, Path, and Result.
[20148] <ornament>
[20149] <prose> First: The ground's space-awareness is: within the heart, the mass of five lights is space; the Intertwined's resonance-light abiding in the channel is Awareness.
[20150] <tantra> From the Seng-ge Tsal-rdzogs:
[20151] <verse> Ground-abiding space-awareness and
[20152] <verse> Path-appearance space-awareness and
[20153] <verse> End-conveying space-awareness go.
[20154] <verse> Ground's space-awareness various two is:
[20155] <verse> Space is space's lamp;
[20156] <verse> Awareness clear as Intertwined.
[20157] <ornament> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20158] <prose> Path's space: to the fortress of five lights,
[20159] <prose> Within the channel-naḍī, body's appearance arisen.
[20160] <tantra> From that very source:
[20161] <verse> Path-appearance space-awareness is:
[20162] <verse> Space is light's surrounding;
[20163] <verse> Awareness explained as five bodies' appearance.
[20164] <ornament> Thus.
[20165] <verse> Result's space: to original purity's self-appearance, like a cloud-free sky,
[20166] <verse> Awareness as that space, inside dissolving, appearing as ground only—
[20167] <verse> Abiding.
[20168] <tantra> From that very source:
[20169] <verse> End-conveying space-awareness is:
[20170] <verse> Space is self-nature appearance;
[20171] <verse> Awareness shown as body and entity.
[20172] <verse> Therefore space and awareness explained.
[20173] <ornament> Thus.
[20174] <prose> Distinguishing this essential point of space-awareness is most important.
[20175] <prose> Second: The actual measure.
[20176] <tantra> Again, from that very source:
[20177] <verse> The secret meaning of certain primordial wisdom:
[20178] <verse> When appearance is piece by piece,
[20179] <verse> The skilled must thoroughly investigate.
[20180] <verse> When very subtle and moving,
[20181] <verse> Through familiarity, thoroughly abide.
[20182] <verse> When flickering, subtle, and moving,
[20183] <verse> Through seeing, thoroughly grasp.
[20184] <verse> When round, subtle, and swirling,
[20185] <verse> The skilled, without distraction, firm absorption.
[20186] <verse> When flashing, flaming, and body appearing,
[20187] <verse> Through familiarity, grasp appearance non-existent.
[20188] <verse> When truly all-appearing,
[20189] <verse> The skilled, appearance gather—as explained.
[20190] <verse> When without attachment and fixation,
[20191] <verse> The skilled, know the method of grasping.
[20192] <verse> This is secret mantra familiarity's characteristic.
[20193] <verse> Then, when primordial wisdom is stirred,
[20194] <verse> The five elements dissolve,
[20195] <verse> That primordial wisdom without attachment,
[20196] <verse> When arrived at appearance's object,
[20197] <verse> Appearance seen as delusion-free,
[20198] <verse> When seeing familiarity's truth,
[20199] <verse> Explained as light-appearance union-like.
[20200] <ornament> Thus.
[20201] <prose> That also: when those path-appearance appearances dissolve inside space,
[20202] <prose> Also from warm, cool, and so forth, the five ultimate elements pervading into the expanse,
[20203] <prose> Elements not sunk,
[20204] <prose> Pristine cognition pervading into expanse,
[20205] <prose> Wisdom pervading into space—called "pristine cognition moving into expanse"—this is the intention's definite time and date.
[20206] <prose> By those, pristine cognition's nature extensively explained.
[20207] <prose> The general meaning, third: Explaining other distinguished phenomena—two:
[20208] <list> Distinguishing individually through definite examples, and
[20209] <list> Distinguishing particularly through definite meaning.
[20210] <prose> First: From the fifteen pairs of comparison-basis.
