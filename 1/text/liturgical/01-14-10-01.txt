[19975] <prose> First.
[19976] <prose> Looking at the Intertwined without the eye moving—such is the View.
[19977] <prose> Meditating without distraction in that state—such is Meditation.
[19978] <prose> Practicing within the appearances of the Intertwined—such is Practice.
[19979] <prose> Stable sphere of Awareness is the Result—
[19980] <tantra> From the Norbu Phra-khod:
[19981] <prose> Within that great abiding nature,
[19982] <verse> The meaning of View is the Intertwined.
[19983] <verse> Although phenomena appear numberless,
[19984] <verse> In the meaning of reality, none are other than One. || 10 ||
[19985] <verse> E-ma! Through the continuum yoga of View,
[19986] <verse> Look upon that meaning as changeless.
[19987] <verse> That too is the body of the Intertwined—
[19988] <verse> Directly appearing yet difficult to grasp.
[19989] <verse> Within that very essence of Awareness,
[19990] <verse> The example of unceasing naked-through abiding.
[19991] <verse> Just as from the clear ocean
[19992] <verse> Planets and stars arise—
[19993] <verse> When it is not the time of latency,
[19994] <verse> Various naked-through great ones abide. || 20 ||
[19995] <verse> Through the continuum yoga of View,
[19996] <verse> If not distracted from that meaning,
[19997] <verse> Latency and non-latency are absent—
[19998] <verse> Day appearances and night subsidence,
[19999] <verse> Appearing as two does not exist.
[20000] <verse> Through the continuum yoga of Practice,
[20001] <verse> The essence of the Intertwined
[20002] <verse> And the four times not separated—
[20003] <verse> That is the continuum yoga of Practice.
[20004] <verse> Although self-aware meditation's continuum is absent,
[20005] <verse> The continuum yoga of Meditation arises. || 30 ||
[20006] <verse> In all times and non-times,
[20007] <verse> Not separated from the Intertwined—
[20008] <verse> That is the continuum yoga of Meditation.
[20009] <ornament> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20010] <prose> Second: Recognizing the places of error.
[20011] <prose> Moreover, from that very source:
[20012] <ornament> E-ma ho!
[20013] <prose> Within the continuum yoga of View,
[20014] <verse> There are three forms of error places:
[20015] <verse> When looking at emptiness,
[20016] <verse> One errs as the four formless sense-fields. || 40 ||
[20017] <verse> When looking at things as existent,
[20018] <verse> The seventeen locations of the form realms
[20019] <verse> And inert solidity become errors.
[20020] <verse> When thoroughly looking at the Intertwined's appearances
[20021] <verse> As permanent,
[20022] <verse> Bound by great attachment,
[20023] <verse> One errs into the six realms' locations.
[20024] <verse> Within the continuum yoga of Practice,
[20025] <verse> There are three forms of error places:
[20026] <verse> When practicing all thus-appearing ones
[20027] <verse> Like a crazy person,
[20028] <verse> One errs as a demi-god. || 50 ||
[20029] <verse> When practicing meaningless mute words,
[20030] <verse> One errs into the view of self.
[20031] <verse> When practicing like a child
[20032] <verse> Toward all six collections' object appearances,
[20033] <verse> One errs into the undefined location.
[20034] <verse> Within the continuum yoga of Meditation,
[20035] <verse> There are three forms of error places:
[20036] <verse> When meditating equanimity selfless,
[20037] <verse> One errs into darkness-appearing from the center.
[20038] <verse> When meditating concentration letters,
[20039] <verse> One errs into Samsara's location through attachment.
[20040] <verse> When meditating non-conceptual emptiness,
[20041] <verse> One errs into the extreme of limitless cutting. || 60 ||
[20042] <verse> Although error's causes are inconceivable,
[20043] <verse> There is no great error place other than that.
[20044] <verse> The Intertwined has no error place—
[20045] <verse> To the path continuum, error appears.
[20046] <verse> In meaning, not even one error place exists.
[20047] <verse> Although cause and result are designated,
[20048] <verse> This was spoken to cut error places.
[20049] <ornament> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20050] <prose> That also: For yogins who have not seen Awareness's directly manifest appearances, who engage in mental paths of view, meditation, practice, and result, and who, although seeing, hold extremes through dull faculties—
[20051] <prose> To cut that:
[20052] <prose> Awareness self-clear with radiance, established as looking at the senses' gates,
[20053] <prose> Free from the extremes of intellect discrimination's existent-nonexistent concepts,
[20054] <prose> Self-essence,
[20055] <prose> Self-dawn view's intention decided inwardly—cutting error places:
[20056] <tantra> From the Thal-'gyur:
[20057] <verse> When the essence of View is seen,
[20058] <verse> Intellect discrimination's words do not move it. || 70 ||
[20059] <ornament> Thus.
[20060] <prose> Although meditating thig-le from the state of self-dawn self-appear, not gone to sudden grasping-holding, expanding as vast open-attachment, recognized as wisdom of depth-clear complete-essence not-distracted, face-grasped vastly meditated—there is no error place.
[20061] <tantra> From that very source:
[20062] <verse> The meditation of non-erring abiding:
[20063] <verse> When the senses' gates are clear,
[20064] <verse> Not moved by mind's concepts,
[20065] <verse> The discrimination mind itself to knowing,
[20066] <verse> Not lost outwardly—
[20067] <verse> Not clear as type and mark,
[20068] <verse> Not gone to separated-cut emptiness,
[20069] <verse> Not continuity of bliss,
[20070] <verse> Not gone to dull equanimity, || 80 ||
[20071] <verse> Mindful aware clear rest,
[20072] <verse> Not gone to reverse purification,
[20073] <verse> Grasping part easy to move inwardly,
[20074] <verse> Manner clear grasping part,
[20075] <verse> Color letter transformers all—
[20076] <verse> When those do not fall to directions,
[20077] <verse> That is non-erring abiding meditation.
[20078] <ornament> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20079] <prose> When concepts move within that state,
[20080] <prose> From practicing what arises as the senses' appearing objects, the part of dual appearance, all liberating—
[20081] <prose> Cutting that error place:
[20082] <prose> Spontaneously arisen, arising; spontaneously arisen, liberating—
[20083] <prose> Between, accepting-rejecting attachment does not enter.
[20084] <verse> Face-to-face showing's benefit not meditated, || 90 ||
[20085] <prose> Placing what appears in the time of appearing right there, liberating at the point of awareness—
[20086] <prose> Suddenly dawned, type without, vast universally, bubble-bubble dawned, grasping part not entered into dharmas possessing two.
[20087] <tantra> From the Seng-ge Tsal-rdzogs:
[20088] <verse> Great Perfection's ceaseless practice itself—
[20089] <verse> Done, it does not arise;
[20090] <verse> Meeting attachment-free self-liberated three.
[20091] <ornament> Thus.
[20092] <verse> The result: self-complete Great Pristine Cognition Obtained—
[20093] <verse> Primordially not established,
[20094] <prose> Knowing this very self-abiding Awareness as the result, decided by one, making ground seized, error place is cut off.
[20095] <tantra> From that very source:
[20096] <verse> Great Perfection's familiarity indeed exists itself— || 100 ||
[20097] <verse> Not arisen through familiarization;
[20098] <verse> Arrived at change-free thought-free four.
[20099] <verse> Great Perfection's meaning itself, difficult to realize,
[200100] <verse> Not found through pointing-out words.
[20101] <verse> Arrived at instructions secret-essence two.
[20102] <verse> Great Perfection Awareness thought-free itself—
[20103] <verse> Not realized through familiarization;
[20104] <verse> Arrived at great sent-place one.
[20105] <verse> Great Perfection self-arisen Primordial Wisdom itself—
[20106] <verse> Not accomplished through accomplishment;
[20107] <verse> Arrived at certain essence two.
[20108] <verse> Great Perfection result single-pointed itself— || 110 ||
[20109] <verse> Not completed through production;
[20110] <verse> Arrived at attachment-free instructions three.
[20111] <ornament> Thus.
[20112] <prose> Third: How Awareness appears to the doorway.
[20113] <prose> Awareness and
[20114] <prose> Appearance—two.
[20115] <prose> Awareness: when looking at self-resonance or recognizing self-arisen, it is called "appearing to the doorway."
[20116] <prose> At that time, potency ground dissolves above, clarity without effusion or gathering, spread out wide, relaxed settled, blazing-clear abiding.
[20117] <tantra> From the Norbu 'Phra-bkod:
[20118] <verse> Arisen from the doorway to the path,
[20119] <verse> Dissolved into the sky-equal empty mode.
[20120] <verse> Although primordial wisdom of meaning generally appears,
[20121] <verse> Complete in the mode, arisen from the mode. || 120 ||
[20122] <ornament> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20123] <prose> Appearance, emerged from the doorway: light, body, sphere, and so forth.
[20124] <tantra> From that very source:
[20125] <verse> Then, when emerged to the doorway:
[20126] <verse> Space's self-nature, Wisdom Body;
[20127] <verse> Awareness's self-nature, Means Body;
[20128] <verse> Without gathering or separating, manifest appearance—
[20129] <verse> Great essence unburst, unceased.
[20130] <verse> Not abiding like a powerful body,
[20131] <verse> Entity completely pure, vast Primordial Wisdom itself;
[20132] <verse> Playing in the object of Great Emptiness's nature,
[20133] <verse> Clear unobstructed Body empty of entity. || 130 ||
[20134] <verse> In the time of emptiness, self-nature uncertain,
[20135] <verse> Body and Primordial Wisdom mandala: thought not existent;
[20136] <verse> Means and Wisdom: meaning change not existent.
[20137] <verse> Empty lamp free from action-effort two,
[20138] <verse> Compassion-arisen lamp like sun-rays.
[20139] <verse> Lamp's light-ray depth arrived not existent,
[20140] <verse> Secret light supreme mind inside clear,
[20141] <verse> Self-nature meaning clear in sky's expanse.
[20142] <verse> Mandala self-complete light is thus.
[20143] <ornament> Thus it is proclaimed.
[20144] <prose> Fourth: Teaching through definite time and measure.
[20145] <prose> Ground-space-awareness distinction showing and
[20146] <prose> Measure actual showing—two.
