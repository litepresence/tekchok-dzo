[17524] <ornament> First, the nature:</ornament>
[17525] <prose> The primordial great purity within, luminous nature, effortless arising basis, abiding as subtle primordial wisdom,</prose>
[17526] <prose> Placed in its expression at the time of delusion, realized as singularly free from elaboration of mind entity, together with the taste of experience.</prose>
[17527] <prose> From that itself:</prose>
[17528] <verse> "Two modes of abiding natural state:</verse>
[17529] <verse> Abiding in the first basis,</verse>
[17530] <verse> And abiding in the object of delusion.</verse>
[17531] <verse> First essence and nature,</verse>
[17532] <verse> Abiding as threefold compassion. || 10 ||</verse>
[17533] <verse> That also abiding as essence body,</verse>
[17534] <verse> Into the rain of Dharma, Sambhogakaya, and Nirmanakaya,</verse>
[17535] <verse> The mode of not dividing the undivided,</verse>
[17536] <verse> From down-accomplished only, even—</verse>
[17537] <verse> Body color and so on, no mind object,</verse>
[17538] <verse> The mode of nature arising as light,</verse>
[17539] <verse> White, red, yellow, green, and blue,</verse>
[17540] <verse> Without possessing signs and marks, || 20 ||</verse>
[17541] <verse> Without marks, accomplished from knowledge-down,</verse>
[17542] <verse> From compassion arising as various,</verse>
[17543] <verse> Because not definite as one like this,</verse>
[17544] <verse> Because appearing as various, it is called basis.</verse>
[17545] <verse> Self-placed in the object of delusion,</verse>
[17546] <verse> Rest, self-liberated, expand place."</verse>
[17547] <prose> Thus it is said.</prose>
[17548] <prose> From Self-Arisen Rigpa:</prose>
[17549] <prose> Scripture of Dharmakaya Great Primordial Wisdom:</prose>
[17550] <verse> "Possessing three characteristics,</verse>
[17551] <verse> Essence, nature, and compassion three,</verse>
[17552] <verse> Are the characteristics of Dharmakaya. || 30 ||</verse>
[17553] <verse> Thus it is."</verse>
[17554] <prose> If asked where this exists now:</prose>
[17555] <prose> It exists in the secret treasury, the glorious jewel precious casket in the heart center.</prose>
[17556] <prose> From that itself:</prose>
[17557] <verse> "This unchanging palace of Dharmakaya,</verse>
[17558] <verse> Abides clearly in the center of each self-citta,</verse>
[17559] <verse> Essence of empty primordial wisdom,</verse>
[17560] <verse> Essence of clear light,</verse>
[17561] <verse> Essence of self-arisen awareness,</verse>
[17562] <verse> Dharmakaya possessing three essences, || 40 ||</verse>
[17563] <verse> Primordial wisdom meaning realized, path-ground not traversed,</verse>
[17564] <verse> This great Dharmakaya free from expression limits,</verse>
[17565] <verse> Abides in all, realized by none,</verse>
[17566] <verse> Without mind, without consciousness, without ignorance, without delusion.</verse>
[17567] <verse> Thus it is."</verse>
[17568] <prose> Here, sometimes it is labeled as the primordial wisdom of basis-abiding,</prose>
[17569] <prose> Sometimes labeled as Dharmakaya,</prose>
[17570] <prose> Sometimes labeled as liberation-basis,</prose>
[17571] <prose> All spoken from the aspect of reversal on one nature,</prose>
[17572] <prose> One should know this as the intention of body and primordial wisdom without gathering or separation. || 50 ||</prose>
[17573] <ornament> Second, definitive meaning:</ornament>
[17574] <prose> It is called Dharmakaya because it gathers the profound and vast essence of Dharma.</prose>
[17575] <ornament> Third, if divided:</ornament>
[17576] <prose> Depending on the basis of great primordial purity meaning, completely pure by nature,</prose>
[17577] <prose> Existing in that body,</prose>
[17578] <prose> And the supreme Dharmakaya of adventitious stain-free, three,</prose>
[17579] <prose> From the three bodies divided by that, become nine.</prose>
[17580] <prose> From Self-Arisen Rigpa:</prose>
[17581] <prose> Though inconceivable, if gathered, bodies gather as three.</prose>
[17582] <prose> What are they?</prose>
[17583] <prose> Dharmakaya transcended from the object of signs,</prose>
[17584] <prose> Sambhogakaya transcended from the object of grasping,</prose>
[17585] <prose> Nirmanakaya transcended from the object of attachment.</prose>
[17586] <prose> That also, in Dharmakaya, is three:</prose>
[17587] <list> Dharmakaya of Dharmakaya,</list>
[17588] <list> Sambhogakaya of Dharmakaya,</list>
[17589] <list> And Nirmanakaya of Dharmakaya.</list>
[17590] <prose> That also, Dharmakaya of Dharmakaya is awareness,</prose>
[17591] <prose> Dharma appears as object,</prose>
[17592] <prose> Body is the unceasing nature of awareness.</prose>
[17593] <prose> Sambhogakaya of Dharmakaya is</prose>
[17594] <prose> The five lights.</prose>
[17595] <prose> Nirmanakaya of Dharmakaya is</prose>
[17596] <prose> The unceasing seeing to the eye sense-power.</prose>
[17597] <prose> The object of Dharmakaya is</prose>
[17598] <prose> The completely pure sky.</prose>
[17599] <prose> The abode of Dharmakaya is citta.</prose>
[17600] <prose> The path of Dharmakaya</prose>
[17601] <prose> Is with the duct of crystal jewel.</prose>
[17602] <prose> In Sambhogakaya also three:</prose>
[17603] <list> Dharmakaya of Sambhogakaya,</list>
[17604] <list> Sambhogakaya of Sambhogakaya,</list>
[17605] <list> And Nirmanakaya of Sambhogakaya.</list>
[17606] <prose> That also, Dharmakaya of Sambhogakaya is</prose>
[17607] <prose> The lucidly abiding unceasing appearance of five primordial wisdoms.</prose>
[17608] <prose> Sambhogakaya of Sambhogakaya is</prose>
[17609] <prose> The five bindu forms with path.</prose>
[17610] <prose> Nirmanakaya of Sambhogakaya is</prose>
[17611] <prose> The awareness arising to the five doors' knowledge objects.</prose>
[17612] <prose> The abode of Sambhogakaya is</prose>
[17613] <prose> Avadhuti.</prose>
[17614] <prose> The path of Sambhogakaya is the small right tip.</prose>
[17615] <prose> In Nirmanakaya three:</prose>
[17616] <list> Dharmakaya of Nirmanakaya,</list>
[17617] <list> Sambhogakaya of Nirmanakaya,</list>
[17618] <list> And Nirmanakaya of Nirmanakaya.</list>
[17619] <prose> That also is as follows:</prose>
[17620] <prose> Dharmakaya of Nirmanakaya is</prose>
[17621] <prose> The two lamps.</prose>
[17622] <prose> Sambhogakaya of Nirmanakaya is</prose>
[17623] <prose> Seeing the five lights.</prose>
[17624] <prose> Nirmanakaya of Nirmanakaya is</prose>
[17625] <prose> The self-awareness of each individual arising of five afflictions.</prose>
[17626] <prose> The abode of Nirmanakaya</prose>
[17627] <prose> Is the brain.</prose>
[17628] <prose> The path of Nirmanakaya is the eye.</prose>
[17629] <prose> The object of Nirmanakaya is said to be appearing as delusion.</prose>
[17630] <prose> That also, Dharmakaya does not exist as mind and afflictions,</prose>
[17631] <prose> And that division of the three bodies' Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya,</prose>
[17632] <prose> And the two Nirmanakayas of Nirmanakaya spoken as five doors' consciousness and afflictions—if one thinks this is contradictory,</prose>
[17633] <prose> It is not contradictory.</prose>
[17634] <prose> Because at the time of consciousness and afflictions' self, there exists the self-expression of awareness, it is spoken to that,</prose>
[17635] <prose> Consciousness and afflictions are not actual Nirmanakaya.</prose>
[17636] <ornament> Fourth, function:</ornament>
[17637] <prose> The Dharmakaya of original purity essence makes the liberation-basis,</prose>
[17638] <prose> At path time, the naturally clear Dharmakaya does the action of liberation,</prose>
[17639] <prose> Those three kayas do the action of purifying and pure-basis.</prose>
[17640] <ornament> Fifth, cause of word entry:</ornament>
[17641] <prose> From primordial free from dust and pure,</prose>
[17642] <prose> Though existing in self-circumstance, not knowing face, as secret Dharma,</prose>
[17643] <prose> Because it exists as the fruit of final-meaning aim seeking, it is expressed as the word of Dharmakaya.</prose>
[17644] <prose> Second meaning: on the difference of mind and primordial wisdom, two:</prose>
[17645] <list> Briefly showing essence, and</list>
[17646] <list> Extensively explaining each own-nature.</list>
[17647] <prose> First:</prose>
[17648] <prose> From the Garland of Pearls:</prose>
[17649] <verse> "The distinction of mind and primordial wisdom</verse>
[17650] <verse> Should be known by scholars.</verse>
[17651] <verse> Thus it arises:</verse>
[17652] <verse> Mind is</verse>
[17653] <verse> Possessing the root non-awareness co-existent, possessing stains, samsaric dharmas, self-same to primordial wisdom sun, obscured like clouds,</verse>
[17654] <verse> Primordial wisdom is</verse>
[17655] <verse> Co-existent with Dharmakaya, not possessing stains, not abiding together with mind's recollection-thought, like the sun. || 120 ||</verse>
[17656] <prose> From that same:</prose>
[17657] <verse> "Mind is the basis of all latencies,</verse>
[17658] <verse> The stain of embodied beings,</verse>
[17659] <verse> Mind grasps objects as grasped,</verse>
[17660] <verse> Therefore it is the nature of samsara.</verse>
[17661] <verse> Thus and—</verse>
[17662] <verse> Again,</verse>
[17663] <verse> Primordial wisdom is free from recollection-basis itself,</verse>
[17664] <verse> Thus."</verse>
[17665] <prose> Also from the Six Expanses:</prose>
[17666] <prose> If the essence of mind and primordial wisdom is not distinguished,</prose>
[17667] <prose> Like the sun obscured by cloud masses, the meaning of outer appearance cannot be done—thus.</prose>
[17668] <prose> That also, mind is</prose>
[17669] <prose> The basis, source, accumulator, all-ariser of all karma, afflictions, and latencies,</prose>
[17670] <prose> Always abiding in the house of non-awareness, opposed to and obscuring the primordial wisdom sun.</prose>
[17671] <prose> From Self-Arisen Rigpa:</prose>
[17672] <verse> "Mind gathers all latencies.</verse>
[17673] <verse> Mind accumulates all afflictions. || 130 ||</verse>
[17674] <verse> Mind is the basis of all latencies,</verse>
[17675] <verse> Because that latency is difficult to cut,</verse>
[17676] <verse> Obscuring self-appearance,</verse>
[17677] <verse> Abiding equally with non-awareness,</verse>
[17678] <verse> Thus and—</verse>
[17679] <verse> From the Garland of Pearls:</verse>
[17680] <verse> Because mind arises from gatherings,</verse>
[17681] <verse> And is also coated with defilements,</verse>
[17682] <verse> Mind gathering Alaya and so on,</verse>
[17683] <verse> Becomes the number of defilements,</verse>
[17684] <verse> Thus."</verse>
[17685] <prose> That also, because that mind obstructing awareness exists as possessed, it is called sentient beings,</prose>
[17686] <prose> Because that mind accumulates karma, delusion itself deludes, doing samsara's karma from one to one.</prose>
[17687] <prose> That mind is liberated from awareness,</prose>
[17688] <prose> When pure and exhausted, it is called Buddha,</prose>
[17689] <prose> Because awareness is free from defilements.</prose>
[17690] <prose> Therefore the true assembly of defilements to be abandoned is</prose>
[17691] <prose> Mind itself.</prose>
[17692] <prose> From that itself:</prose>
[17693] <verse> "If mind is free, Buddha,</verse>
[17694] <verse> All embodied beings' stains exhausted, || 140 ||</verse>
[17695] <verse> Migrating beings migrate by that mind,</verse>
[17696] <verse> Without that, migration is impossible,</verse>
[17697] <verse> Therefore migrating like delusion-wheel,</verse>
[17698] <verse> Thus."</verse>
[17699] <prose> That mind also, the mind that grasps objects as "this and this," symbols, names, and universal grasp,</prose>
[17700] <prose> And investigating distinctions in detail, analyzing, the mind of subject grasping—these two gather,</prose>
[17701] <prose> "Mind grasps objects as grasped"—</prose>
[17702] <prose> Thus it is explained.</prose>
[17703] <prose> These are needed also from common texts:</prose>
[17704] <prose> "When mind ceases, the body directly does"—</prose>
[17705] <prose> Thus and—</prose>
[17706] <prose> In Clear Words:</prose>
[17707] <prose> "Mind and mental factors' entry also continuous break"—</prose>
[17708] <prose> From the Heap of Jewels:</prose>
[17709] <prose> "Free from mind, intellect, and consciousness,</prose>
[17710] <prose> Not abandoning the abode of samadhi,</prose>
[17711] <prose> This is called the unfathomable secret of the Tathagata's heart."</prose>
[17712] <prose> Primordial wisdom is</prose>
[17713] <prose> Like space, elaboration ceased, basis of measureless Buddha dharmas, source of the wheel, together with the ocean assembly of primordial wisdom, always abiding in Dharmakaya's home, burning all thickets of afflictions and habits like fire.</prose>
[17714] <prose> From the Garland of Pearls:</prose>
[17715] <verse> "Because all conceptions are burned,</verse>
[17716] <verse> Primordial wisdom itself consumes like fire,</verse>
[17717] <verse> Equal to space itself,</verse>
[17718] <verse> Possessing empty-luminous awareness,</verse>
[17719] <verse> Thus." || 150 ||</verse>
[17720] <prose> Here, some not-knowing,</prose>
[17721] <prose> Saying "If mind does not exist, it becomes inanimate or like darkness"—this is of small learning.</prose>
[17722] <prose> Though mind does not exist, because primordial wisdom exists, awareness does not cease.</prose>
[17723] <prose> That also, because the mind of non-awareness delusion ceases,</prose>
[17724] <prose> The clear sun of primordial wisdom arises,</prose>
[17725] <prose> Like day rising because night dawns.</prose>
[17726] <prose> Some say,</prose>
[17727] <prose> "Because non-awareness is the pervader of awareness,</prose>
[17728] <prose> Thinking that when mind ceases, awareness ceases"—this is a very great mistake.</prose>
[17729] <prose> Though awareness pervades non-awareness outwardly,</prose>
[17730] <prose> Non-awareness does not pervade inwardly, like Buddha's primordial wisdom.</prose>
[17731] <prose> Because non-awareness pervades mind,</prose>
[17732] <prose> It is suitable as mind's pervader,</prose>
[17733] <prose> Because it does not pervade awareness,</prose>
[17734] <prose> Non-awareness is thought to cease or break continuum from awareness expanse.</prose>
[17735] <prose> Therefore when mind ceases, though the basis non-awareness possessing parts ceases,</prose>
[17736] <prose> Awareness does not cease, because the basis of ceasing is awareness.</prose>
[17737] <prose> If awareness also did not exist, what would be suitable to cease on top of?</prose>
[17738] <prose> Here, because the part of non-awareness mind ceases, awareness expands as primordial wisdom, enjoying the two knowledges.</prose>
[17739] <prose> From the Garland of Pearls:</prose>
[17740] <verse> "Because mind is separated from all movement,</verse>
[17741] <verse> It is not like inanimate,</verse>
[17742] <verse> Knowing and appearing clear to awareness,</verse>
[17743] <verse> Thus it is spoken."</verse>
[17744] <prose> There, mind and primordial wisdom are each-other.</prose>
[17745] <prose> Also from common body:</prose>
[17746] <prose> Mind and mind-itself are distinguished as two, pure by nature.</prose>
[17747] <prose> There, mind is all-conception samsara dharma,</prose>
[17748] <prose> Mind-itself is elaboration-free nirvana dharma.</prose>
[17749] <prose> Also from the Arya Prajnaparamita in Eight Thousand:</prose>
[17750] <prose> "On mind, mind does not exist,</prose>
[17751] <prose> The nature of mind is luminosity"—thus it is spoken.</prose>
[17752] <prose> "On mind" thus is gathering the basis, showing essence nature.</prose>
[17753] <prose> Mind possessing elaboration, thought, dharma emanating and gathering, and one-pointed entering higher realms—like these indeed do not have nature.</prose>
[17754] <prose> Nature of mind,</prose>
[17755] <prose> Natural state of mind,</prose>
[17756] <prose> Mind itself called, name enumeration, that itself character, abiding as luminous primordial wisdom—thus it arises.</prose>
[17757] <prose> Fools not knowing to distinguish mind and mind-itself, also pitaka-knowing arrogant, display arrogance only.</prose>
[17758] <prose> Thus well separating mind and primordial wisdom, though doing ground, path, and fruit to mind in the common object-possessing vehicle,</prose>
[17759] <prose> All that does not arrive directly at meaning,</prose>
[17760] <prose> In this vehicle, enumerating Buddha's ground, path, and fruit to primordial wisdom,</prose>
[17761] <prose> Quickly liberates from samsara,</prose>
[17762] <prose> Others, hoping for enlightenment at samsara's root for long, even that is difficult to obtain,</prose>
[17763] <prose> Because the manner of opening the ground errs.</prose>
[17764] <prose> From Samantabhadra's Mind Mirror:</prose>
[17765] <tantra> "Desiring Buddha from mind deviates from me." || 180 ||</tantra>
[17766] <prose> Thus it is spoken.</prose>
[17767] <prose> The manner of deviation:</prose>
[17768] <prose> It is contradicted by both reasoning and scripture.</prose>
[17769] <prose> Thus if Buddha, path, and ground are opened from mind,</prose>
[17770] <prose> Three,</prose>
[17771] <prose> That opening-ground mind itself, because possessing grasping-grasper, as a result your ground, path, and fruit all become possessed of grasping-grasper.</prose>
[17772] <prose> Therefore Buddha is not accomplished from desire, and even if accomplished, it results in reverse,</prose>
[17773] <prose> Because not liberated from grasping-grasper.</prose>
[17774] <prose> Also like mind gathering various habits and karma,</prose>
[17775] <prose> Ground, path, and fruit also result in that,</prose>
[17776] <prose> If desired, there is the fault of resulting in delusion.</prose>
[17777] <prose> Opponents say this:</prose>
[17778] <prose> "If mind does not exist, Buddha is also not reasonable,</prose>
[17779] <prose> Because you also desire that these Buddhas are distinguished by bodhicitta."</prose>
[17780] <prose> Reply is spoken:</prose>
[17781] <prose> "Buddha is not from mind not existing and existing,</prose>
[17782] <prose> Thus it arises from Dharmakaya primordial wisdom existing or not existing.</prose>
[17783] <prose> Though true that Buddha is distinguished by awakening from mind's delusion, still not certain by the spontaneous presence Buddha of the ground, it is not truly actual,</prose>
[17784] <prose> Because though purified as to-be-purified, that to-be-purified purified is not Buddha.</prose>
[17785] <prose> Buddha does not arise from mind.</prose>
[17786] <prose> Here also harmed by scripture:</prose>
[17787] <prose> Common scripture:</prose>
[17788] <prose> Also from Madhyamakavatara:</prose>
[17789] <prose> "When mind ceases, the body directly does"—</prose>
[17790] <prose> Says and—</prose>
[17791] <prose> Uncommon scripture:</prose>
[17792] <prose> Also from Vajra-tip:</prose>
[17793] <prose> "The five pure consciousness elements are the nature of five wisdoms," etc. explained as state-change.</prose>
[17794] <prose> If Buddha is achieved from mind entity,</prose>
[17795] <prose> To-be-purified and state-change are meaningless.</prose>
[17796] <prose> Unsurpassable scripture:</prose>
[17797] <prose> From Rigpa Self-Shine Tantra, chapter eighty-six, the chapter refuting all opponents:</prose>
[17798] <prose> Some desire thus:</prose>
[17799] <tantra> "They think to seek result from mind.</tantra>
[17800] <tantra> Return on that is as follows:</tantra>
[17801] <tantra> How much is the entity of mind?</tantra>
[17802] <tantra> Asked, extensively answered:</tantra>
[17803] <tantra> Because mind has no entity,</tantra>
[17804] <tantra> Then what is the characteristic of mind?</tantra>
[17805] <tantra> Asked, extensively answered:</tantra>
[17806] <tantra> Because mind has no entity,</tantra>
[17807] <tantra> Where is the grasping-holder of dharma-nature?</tantra>
[17808] <tantra> Like the characteristic of sky as example,</tantra>
[17809] <tantra> Because grasping and holding do not exist,</tantra>
[17810] <tantra> Words spoken returning on that.</tantra>
[17811] <tantra> Does grasping-holder exist or not exist on mind?</tantra>
[17812] <tantra> Asked, extensively answered:</tantra>
[17813] <tantra> Though grasping and holding exist on mind,</tantra>
[17814] <tantra> Because dharma-nature has no grasping-holder,</tantra>
[17815] <tantra> Returning on that also spoken.</tantra>
[17816] <tantra> Whose assertion will fall?</tantra>
[17817] <tantra> Because mind and dharma-nature are one,</tantra>
[17818] <tantra> If grasping-holder arises on mind,</tantra>
[17819] <tantra> Buddha will not be found by effort,</tantra>
[17820] <tantra> Because grasping-holder exists on mind,</tantra>
[17821] <tantra> Asked, reverse spoken.</tantra>
[17822] <tantra> If mind does not exist, Buddha-ness—</tantra>
[17823] <tantra> Your find, or by what?</tantra>
[17824] <tantra> Asked on that, extensively answered:</tantra>
[17825] <tantra> Result is not sought from mind,</tantra>
[17826] <tantra> Because various arise from mind,</tantra>
[17827] <tantra> Sentient beings are gathering of latencies,</tantra>
[17828] <tantra> Because moving to grasping object,</tantra>
[17829] <tantra> Mind is the root of samsara,</tantra>
[17830] <tantra> Mind is the stage to be abandoned,</tantra>
[17831] <tantra> Why? Because existing as mind,</tantra>
[17832] <tantra> Mind is the root of confusion,</tantra>
[17833] <tantra> All are separated from that,</tantra>
[17834] <tantra> Because missing from similar-basis,</tantra>
[17835] <tantra> Mind is demonstrated as defiled,</tantra>
[17836] <tantra> Why? Because thought exists,</tantra>
[17837] <tantra> Mind is like an action feather,</tantra>
[17838] <tantra> Why? Because not possessing mind,</tantra>
[17839] <tantra> Then reverse words spoken.</tantra>
[17840] <tantra> Then how is mind itself desired?</tantra>
[17841] <tantra> Then extensively granted kindness answer.</tantra>
[17842] <tantra> Result is not desired from mind,</tantra>
