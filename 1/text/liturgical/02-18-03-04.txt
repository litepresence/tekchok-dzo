[4428] <prose> Fourth, regarding these: through the four supports or companions, if the pith is not familiarized, familiarization does not reach the measure. Therefore the final support instruction and four topics are taught:</prose>
[4429] <tantra> From the Glorious Mountain-Stack Tantra:</tantra>
[4430] <verse>If one desires to familiarize the direct pith,</verse>
[4431] <verse>The pith is distinguished as four sections.</verse>
[4432] <tantra>Thus it is.</tantra>
[4433] <prose>The certainty of completing the path through four topics:</prose>
[4434] <prose>Externally, exhausting the appearances of the four emanations with their supports;</prose>
[4435] <prose>Internally, exhausting the increase and decrease of the four times;</prose>
[4436] <prose>Secretly, exhausting the changes of the four day-moons;</prose>
[4437] <prose>Supreme, emptying the ground of the four body-speech-mind-consciousness—thus four certainties. || 10 ||</prose>
[4438] <prose>Moreover, externally demonstrating the certainty of the four empowerments;</prose>
[4439] <prose>Internally, expanding the channels of the four wheels;</prose>
[4440] <prose>Secretly, actually clarifying the four wisdoms;</prose>
[4441] <prose>Supreme, showing the increase of the four lamps—thus four topics are taught.</prose>
[4442] <prose>If more than this, chattering is purposeless;</prose>
[4443] <prose>If fewer, without root, the fruit of the desired meaning does not ripen—depending on purpose, thus four arise.</prose>
[4444] <ornament>First, exhausting the pith of body and speech:</ornament>
[4445] <tantra>From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra:</tantra>
[4446] <verse>Thus having gone before,</verse>
[4447] <verse>In order to look at the direct meaning, || 20 ||</verse>
[4448] <verse>Body, speech, and mind are thoroughly bound.</verse>
[4449] <tantra>Thus it is said.</tantra>
[4450] <prose>Here there are three:</prose>
[4451] <list>Establishing the three kāyas' postures of the body;</list>
[4452] <list>Speech not speaking anything, like a mute;</list>
[4453] <list>Cutting the proliferating thoughts of mind's dispersion and gathering.</list>
[4454] <ornament>First:</ornament>
[4455] <tantra>From that itself:</tantra>
[4456] <verse>The body—like a lion,</verse>
[4457] <verse>Like a sage, and like an elephant: || 30 ||</verse>
[4458] <verse>If one does not move from these,</verse>
[4459] <verse>Even with three thousand Buddhas,</verse>
[4460] <verse>The fortune is equal.</verse>
[4461] <tantra>Thus it is said.</tantra>
[4462] <tantra>From the Pearl Garland:</tantra>
[4463] <verse>The body's pith is threefold:</verse>
[4464] <verse>The lion's manner and elephant's manner,</verse>
[4465] <verse>Abide like a sage.</verse>
[4466] <tantra>Thus it is said.</tantra>
[4467] <prose>Here, the three kāyas too, though the supports are different, through three different postures of a single body— || 40 ||</prose>
