[1671] First, regarding the aggregates with thought of contaminated worldly ordinary beings:
[1672] The five aggregates of such beings are those wherein cyclic existence is accumulated.
[1673] The form aggregate, being suitable for destruction and disintegration, serves as the vessel of experience.
[1674] The feeling aggregate, which experiences pleasure and pain and becomes attached as desire, binds beings to saṃsāra.
[1675] The perception aggregate, which moves toward and enters objects, distinguishing this from that.
[1676] The formation factors aggregate, which performs actions and includes all latent tendencies.
[1677] The aggregate of consciousness that knows and functions with objects, being the chief of the five.
[1678] Regarding the aggregates without thought:
[1679] These are the five aspects abiding in the self-awareness of individual noble beings who have transcended the world.
[1680] The aggregate of concentration, having the nature of calm-abiding and insight united. || 10 ||
[1681] The aggregate of wisdom, liberated from individual afflictions through direct realization.
[1682] The aggregate of wisdom discerning, seeing the nature of self and generality without confusion.
[1683] The aggregate of discipline, completely pure from the direction of stains and transgressions.
[1684] The aggregate of complete liberation, liberated from all elaboration and conceptual thought.
[1685] These aggregates, when gathered by the training path, abandon those parts associated with learning and proceed further, moistening only the aspect of what is to be abandoned.
[1686] The qualities of the time when one is not training are not like that, being spontaneous and effortless.
[1687] When liberated all at once, even the name "aggregate" does not remain, for there is no gathering.
[1688] Since it is said that they are "completely liberated from aggregates," one should understand that although called "one aspect," there is no contradiction, as this refers to the definitive meaning.
[1689] As it is stated in the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra:
[1690] The aggregates are as follows, divided into two categories: || 20 ||
[1691] The aggregates obscured by conceptual thought, and
[1692] The aggregates that are naturally free from conceptual thought.
[1693] Regarding the aggregates obscured by conceptual thought:
[1694] These are as follows:
[1695] The form aggregate, when all objects are gathered and accomplished as the basis.
[1696] The feeling aggregate, when all experiences are gathered as pleasant, painful, or neutral.
[1697] The perception aggregate, when the holding of all faculties is gathered as distinct cognition.
[1698] The formation factors aggregate, when all subtle afflictions and latencies are gathered.
[1699] The consciousness aggregate, when all knowings are gathered as the ground of experience.
[1700] Regarding the aggregates without conceptual thought: || 30 ||
[1701] The aggregate of concentration, when all concentrations are gathered as one-pointed calm.
[1702] The aggregate of wisdom, complete liberation, since awareness itself is exhausted of outflows.
[1703] The aggregate of wisdom discerning, since that meaning appears without birth or cessation.
[1704] The aggregate of discipline, for the purpose of purifying manifest stains through ethical conduct.
[1705] The aggregate of complete liberation, for the purpose of transcending all concepts and elaborations.
[1706] Third: The distinctive characteristics of the sense sources, which serve as the gateways of perception.
[1707] That which arises from specific conditions and becomes expanded into experience is called "sense source."
[1708] If one divides them according to their manner of arising:
[1709] From the aspect of objects, the eye's grasping object—form and so forth—six things arise and expand as the two knowings of the present moment and the outer continuum.
[1710] From the aspect of knowing, there arise and expand six consciousnesses: eye consciousness and so forth, knowing forms as forms without confusion. || 40 ||
[1711] Thus the twelve sense sources are established:
[1712] These are taught as follows:
[1713] The sense sources are fundamentally two:
[1714] The grasped sense sources that appear as objects, and
[1715] The grasper sense sources that apprehend them.
[1716] Regarding the grasped sense sources: Thinking of form, sound, odor, taste, phenomena, and touch as the domain of perception.
[1717] The six portions of the grasped are eye, ear, nose, tongue, mind, and body as objects.
[1718] The twelve are eye grasping form, ear grasping sound, nose grasping odor, tongue grasping taste, mind grasping phenomena, and body grasping touch. Thus it is taught by the Buddha.
[1719] Fourth: The essential nature of the faculties that grasp and dominate their objects.
[1720] They are called "faculties" because they possess power and sovereignty over the grasping of objects. || 50 ||
[1721] If one divides them according to their origin:
[1722] There are those arising from the first portion of form-possessing embodiment, and
[1723] Those arising from the portion of wisdom—these two categories.
[1724] First:
[1725] The coarse aggregates arising from the first condition of form-possessing embodiment.
[1726] Five faculties: the eye faculty and so forth, which produce the capability of grasping forms and so on.
[1727] The sixth: the mind faculty, arising from the first condition of form-possessing knowing.
[1728] Second:
[1729] The portion of knowing that arises as wisdom, capable of engaging objects with discernment.
[1730] These are the six: faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom, and mental peace. || 60 ||
[1731] As it is stated in the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra, the great seal of definitive meaning.
