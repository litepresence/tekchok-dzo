[1671] First:
[1672] The five aggregates of contaminated worldly ordinary beings:
[1673] The form aggregate, suitable for destruction,
[1674] The feeling aggregate, which experiences and becomes desire,
[1675] The perception aggregate, which moves and enters objects,
[1676] The formation factors aggregate, which does and includes latencies.



[1677] The aggregate of consciousness that knows and functions with objects.
[1678] The aggregates without thought are:
[1679] The five parts abiding in the self-awareness of individual noble beings who have transcended the world:
[1680] The aggregate of concentration, the nature of calm-abiding and insight.
[1681] The aggregate of wisdom, liberated from individual afflictions.
[1682] The aggregate of wisdom, seeing the nature of self and generality.
[1683] The aggregate of discipline, completely pure from the direction of stains.
[1684] The aggregate of complete liberation, liberated from elaboration and thought.
[1685] These, when gathered by the training path, abandon those parts and proceed further, moistening the aspect of what is to be abandoned.
[1686] The qualities of the time when one is not training are not like that.
[1687] When liberated all at once, even the name "aggregate" does not remain.
[1688] Since it is said that they are "completely liberated from aggregates," one should understand that although called "one aspect," there is no contradiction.
[1689] As it is stated in the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra:
[1690] The aggregates are as follows:
[1691] The aggregates obscured by thought, and
[1692] The aggregates that are naturally free from thought.
[1693] The aggregates obscured by thought are:
[1694] As follows:
[1695] The form aggregate, when all objects are gathered and accomplished.
[1696] The feeling aggregate, when all experiences are gathered.
[1697] The perception aggregate, when the holding of all faculties is gathered.
[1698] The formation factors aggregate, when all subtle afflictions are gathered.
[1699] The consciousness aggregate, when all knowings are gathered.
[1700] The aggregates without thought are:
[1701] The aggregate of concentration, when all concentrations are gathered.
[1702] The aggregate of wisdom, complete liberation, since awareness itself is exhausted of outflows.
[1703] The aggregate of wisdom, since that meaning appears without birth.



[1704] The aggregate of discipline, for the purpose of purifying manifest stains.
[1705] The aggregate of complete liberation, for the purpose of transcending all concepts.
[1706] Third: The distinctive characteristics of the sense sources.
[1707] That which arises from what and becomes expanded is called "sense source."
[1708] If divided:
[1709] From the aspect of objects, the eye's grasping object, form, and so forth—six things—arise and expand as the two knowings of the moment and the outer continuum.
[1710] From the aspect of knowing, there arise and expand six: eye consciousness and so forth, knowing forms as forms.
[1711] The twelve sense sources are:
[1712] These are:
[1713] The sense sources are two:
[1714] The grasped sense sources, and
[1715] The grasper sense sources.
[1716] The grasped sense sources: Thinking of form, sound, odor, taste, phenomena, and touch as perception.
[1717] The six portions of the grasped: eye, ear, nose, tongue, mind, and body.
[1718] The twelve are: eye grasping, ear grasping, nose grasping, tongue grasping, mind grasping, and body grasping. Thus it is taught.
[1719] Fourth: The essential nature of the faculties that grasp.
[1720] They are called "faculties" because they have power over grasping objects.
[1721] If divided:
[1722] Those arising from the first portion of form-possessing, and
[1723] Those arising from the portion of wisdom—these two.
[1724] First:
[1725] The coarse aggregates arising from the first condition of form-possessing.
[1726] Five: the eye faculty and so forth, which produce the capability of grasping forms.
[1727] The six: the mind faculty, arising from the first condition of form-possessing knowing.
[1728] Second:
[1729] The portion of knowing that arises, capable of engaging objects.
[1730] These are the six: faith and so forth.
[1731] As it is stated in the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra.
