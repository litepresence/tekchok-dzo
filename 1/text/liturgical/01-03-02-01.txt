[1710] Regarding the faculties as wisdom's dynamic display:
[1711] These are not mechanical senses but the sovereign display of self-arisen wisdom.
[1712] The twelve sense sources arise as the play of rigpa's spontaneous presence—
[1713] The eye faculty, domination of luminous clarity seeing forms as empty display.
[1714] The ear faculty, domination of unobstructed resonance hearing sounds as echoes.
[1715] The nose faculty, domination of pure discernment knowing scents as ungraspable.
[1716] The tongue faculty, domination of unimpeded cognition tasting flavors as bliss-emptiness.
[1717] The body faculty, domination of all-pervading touch-feeling contact as mere appearance.
[1718] The mind faculty, domination of knowing-knowing phenomena as mind's own display. || 10 ||
[1719] The six faculties of form-embodiment are wisdom temporarily unrecognized—
[1720] Not obstacles but pathways of recognition when seen as their nature.
[1721] These faculties do not grasp objects; objects arise as their own display.
[1722] The eye seeing form is rigpa seeing its own face.
[1723] The ear hearing sound is wisdom recognizing its own vibration.
[1724] Thus the faculties are kayas in potential—
[1725] Unrecognized, they bind through grasping.
[1726] Recognized, they liberate through seeing their own nature.
[1727] The six wisdom-faculties arise when recognition dawns:
[1728] Faith as confidence in self-arisen wisdom.
[1729] Effort as natural engagement without striving.
[1730] Mindfulness as unbroken recognition without distraction. || 20 ||
[1731] Concentration as one-pointed abiding in the nature.
[1732] Wisdom as seeing all phenomena as one's own display.
[1733] Mental peace as freedom from conceptual elaboration.
[1734] As the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra declares—the great seal of definitive meaning:
[1735] "The faculties arising from form are wisdom temporarily veiled.
[1736] The faculties arising from wisdom are recognition itself displaying.
[1737] No separation between these two—merely recognition and non-recognition."
[1738] Thus the eighteen elements are established as wisdom-display:
[1739] The six objects, six faculties, and six consciousnesses are empty of inherent existence.
[1740] The element of earth—cohesive stability—is dharmakaya's unchanging nature. || 30 ||
[1741] The element of water—fluid gathering—is sambhogakaya's spontaneous presence.
[1742] The element of fire—ripening warmth—is nirmanakaya's compassionate activity.
[1743] The element of wind—mobility and movement—is the dynamic energy of awareness.
[1744] The element of space—all-pervading openness—is the vast expanse of dharmadhatu.
[1745] These five elements are not external substances but wisdom's own qualities—
[1746] Earth as the unshakeable confidence of recognition.
[1747] Water as the flowing continuum of non-dual awareness.
[1748] Fire as the warmth of compassion arising from emptiness.
[1749] Wind as the dynamic display of spontaneous presence.
[1750] Space as the unobstructed ground of all appearance. || 40 ||
[1751] When the faculties, elements, and consciousnesses are seen as wisdom-display,
[1752] The eighteen elements are liberated into the nature of mind.
[1753] Eye-consciousness seeing form is dharmakaya seeing its own face.
[1754] Ear-consciousness hearing sound is sambhogakaya enjoying its own display.
[1755] Mind-consciousness knowing phenomena is nirmanakaya spontaneously accomplishing benefit.
[1756] There is no consciousness separate from wisdom—
[1757] Merely recognition transforms consciousness into primordial knowing.
[1758] Thus the faculties and elements are the mandala of recognition:
[1759] Unrecognized, they appear as the world of grasping and fixation.
[1760] Recognized, they are the pure lands of the three kayas.
[1761] The distinction lies not in the faculties themselves but in recognition—
[1762] This is the definitive meaning of the Sun-Moon-Union Tantra. || 50 ||
