[10471] First, establishing the nature of the ground: The dimension of primordial purity, ultimate truth, and the vajra place of Secret Mantra—revealing the essence of the spontaneously present mandala—comprises two aspects.

[10472] The general presentation of the sevenfold nature of the ground,

[10473] And the detailed explanation of the supreme ground.

[10474] The first has three parts:

[10475] A brief presentation of the essence of the seven grounds,

[10476] Showing how fixation on extremes creates the seven grounds with their flaws,

[10477] And establishing in the authentic scriptures the ground where primordial purity and spontaneous presence are inseparable.

[10478] First: According to the Great Perfection, the ground is taught as sevenfold.

[10479] These represent the respective positions held by proponents of different philosophical tenets.

[10480] They are: the ground as primordially pure,

[10481] The ground as spontaneously present,

[10482] The ground as indefinite,

[10483] The ground as definite—the authentic main practice,

[10484] The ground as capable of being transformed in any way,

[10485] The ground as capable of accepting any position,

[10486] And the ground as multiform—seven in all.

[10487] These are individually asserted by labeling distinct aspects of primordial purity.

[10488] In this self-arisen wisdom,

[10489] There is no assertion of existence or non-existence.

[10490] From the perspective of the Great Freedom from Elaboration, the ground is held as primordially pure.

[10491] In the essence of awareness, qualities exist as innate, like the sun possessing rays, stainless—this is spontaneous presence.

[10492] In the essence of awareness, since nothing is established as singular, this is held as the great indefiniteness free from directional elaboration.

[10493] In the essence of awareness, that which is immutable is held as the ground of certainty.

[10494] In the essence of awareness, since anything may appear, it is held as capable of being transformed in any way.

[10495] In the essence of awareness, since all phenomena of samsara and nirvana arise, it is held as capable of accepting any position.

[10496] In the essence of awareness, since the manner of appearance is unceasing, it is held as multiform—called "variegated."

[10497] These are posited through seeing different aspects of a single awareness as separate valid cognitions.

[10498] <tantra>From the Thal 'gyur:</tantra>

[10499] The natural state established by spontaneous descent

[10500] Is also expressed through the manner of seven grounds.

[10501] From the face of multiplicity is spontaneous presence,

[10502] From the measure of movement is indefiniteness.

[10503] From non-movement comes certainty,

[10504] The measure of appearance transforms in every way.

[10505] Since all arise, there is acceptance,

[10506] Since confusion is purified, primordial purity,

[10507] The manner of appearance is called entirely variegated.

[10508] Thus it is said.

[10509] <tantra>From the Klong drug pa:</tantra>

[10510] The ground established by primordial descent,

[10511] Existent yet not one, not many—

[10512] From the aspect where confusion appears,

[10513] When realized ones definitively establish it,

[10514] It appears in the manner of seven stages.

[10515] Yet these sevenfold appearances

[10516] Are the manner of appearing of a single essence.

[10517] Not knowing this singularity, thus they appear.

[10518] Yet the meaning is this:

[10519] Abiding as spontaneous presence itself,

[10520] Multiform gathered, appearing as essence.

[10521] Abiding as indefinite,

[10522] Mover with conceptual mind appears.

[10523] Abiding as certainty in its own face,

[10524] Remembrance without transference appears.

[10525] Abiding as capable of transformation,

[10526] Through effort, mind's aspect appears.

[10527] Abiding as the essence of everything,

[10528] Whatever appears appears as its own essence.

[10529] Abiding as variegated,

[10530] In multiform, individual manners appear.

[10531] Abiding as pure from the beginning,

[10532] Stains appear as never having existed.

[10533] All these are levels of mind,

[10534] In its own face, pure from the beginning.

[10535] Thus it is.

[10536] Second, showing the seven grounds with their flaws through extreme fixation: Like the blind describing an elephant before them,

[10537] Fixation on partial understanding of awareness, grasping at positions with stubborn attachment,

[10538] To refute these, there are seven arguments.

[10539] First, refuting the view of spontaneous presence: Presenting the assertion and refuting it—two aspects.

[10540] First, the presentation: They hold that the natural state of spontaneous presence

[10541] Has never been severed in India,

[10542] Nor fallen in any direction.

[10543] Second, the refutation: If spontaneously present from the first, then samsara, always circling, would not be liberated,

[10544] Since it is spontaneously present.

[10545] Nirvana too would not depend on conditions such as recognizing one's own face,

[10546] Since nirvana is spontaneously present from the first.

[10547] It is also unreasonable to say that both their grounds are spontaneous presence,
