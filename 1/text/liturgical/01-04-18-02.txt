[3893] The second:
[3894] Through the vast expanse's aspect—never departing anywhere—the pervasion and estimation of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
[3895] Through essence-grasping being free in dharmadhātu's emptiness, the estimation of phenomena's transformation,
[3896] Through non-fabrication in the expanse, that-which-is-called self-arisen wisdom.
[3897] The essence of the self-arising tantra's instruction—all commands' source—is clear in the arising ground.
[3898] The unique is cut by the axe of distinctive knowing.
[3899] Through non-duality in self-nature, the cessation of saṃsāra's reliance,
[3900] Through characteristic not established as words or letters,
[3901] Emptiness is free from the ground of dispute.
[3902] When divided, there are four: || 10 ||
[3903] <list> Commanded in the manner of view's thorough investigation,
[3904] <list> Commanded in the manner of removing obscurations,
[3905] <list> Commanded in the manner of bringing forth the hidden to manifestation,
[3906] <list> Commanded in the manner of self-clarifying explanation.
[3907] The first:
[3908] Pervading the unelaborated essence-ground,
[3909] Action free from good and bad, the three realms' complete liberation,
[3910] Through self-nature's emptiness arising in all aspects—action, virtue, and non-virtue not abandoned—buddhas and sentient beings do not exist.
[3911] Through characteristic not established as words or letters, the dharma of all vehicles—through non-transcendence—is the essential point of the single sovereign's path.
[3912] When divided: the view clinging to appearance and concept—non-arising, || 20 ||
[3913] The investigation of mind's realization—all doubts released—these are two.
[3914] The first:
[3915] Through essence being without dharma, even the name of buddha does not exist.
[3916] Through self-nature radiating as energy, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa appear as the view.
[3917] Through characteristic not established as one, view and meditation are without measure.
[3918] The second:
[3919] Through essence being unproduced and completely purified, afflictions are self-liberated,
[3920] Through self-nature being unceasing and pervasively arising, acceptance and rejection do not exist at all,
[3921] Through characteristic being causeless and self-liberated, the path of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is exhausted.
[3922] Through the essence of gtar-ka's obstacle-clearing, the essential point of dharmatā is clarified, || 30 ||
[3923] At the boundary of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa:
[3924] Through self-nature being unobstructed, the ground-basis is without the stain of ignorant mind,
[3925] Through characteristic being causeless and the basis being pure, confusion is self-pacified.
[3926] When divided, there are two:
[3927] <list> The removal of obstacles in the heat and clarity of view and meditation,
[3928] <list> The removal of obstacles in the manner of abiding of phenomena.
[3929] The first:
[3930] The heat of view is the connection between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
[3931] That also: when view moves, the dharmatā of cyclic existence settles as the non-dual equality of movement and stillness.
[3932] At the time of view's attainment, heat arises in body and speech, || 40 ||
[3933] Like fire blazing in wood.
[3934] At the time of view's stability, the distinction between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is:
[3935] Like an army conquering a fortress.
[3936] At the time of meditation's movement, wind and mind are gathered,
[3937] Like entering the treasure-house of the body's channels.
[3938] At the time of meditation's attainment, mind enters the path,
[3939] Like a wild boar being tamed.
[3940] At the time of meditation's stability, the strength of awareness is found—
[3941] Like the royal lineage bestowing empowerment from the universal sovereign.
[3942] At the time of conduct's movement, the distant reach of knowing, with heart-wind rising, || 50 ||
[3943] Like a garuḍa's complete wings or a companion flying into the sky.
[3944] At the time of conduct's stability, the heat and clarity of the three bodies is attained,
[3945] Like the absorption of Brahmā.
[3946] Also, through conduct, appearance is purified, so the dharmatā of appearance and conditions is without path of effort.
[3947] Through the removal of obstacles in meditation's movement, the path of recollection, samādhi, and concentration is without path of effort.
[3948] Through the removal of obstacles in view's dharmatā, the path of buddhahood beyond reliance on phenomena is without path of effort.
[3949] Through the removal of obstacles in the manner of abiding of phenomena, the essence of dharmatā is without fabrication—whatever appears, mind does not conceptualize.
[3950] Through self-nature without cause and fruition, without self-wish, there is no place to go,
[3951] Through characteristic not needing familiarization, not depending on other knowables.
[3952] Through the essence of the hidden and manifest being unobtainable, || 60 ||
[3953] Hope does not reach anywhere.
[3954] Through self-nature without direction, doubt is nowhere.
[3955] Through characteristic examined and not found, the root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is rotten—so it is called.
[3956] When divided, there are two:
[3957] <list> Concealing one, revealing and emerging two,
[3958] <list> Concealing two, revealing and emerging one.
[3959] The first:
[3960] If view and conduct are revealed and emerge, and meditation is concealed,
[3961] That nature in union without beginning or end—saṃsāra and nirvāṇa's beginning and end are cut.
[3962] That nature's two are not different—in the bindu without outside or inside, || 70 ||
[3963] Without dependence on characteristic—causeless openness.
[3964] If conduct is concealed and the other two are revealed and emerge,
[3965] Abiding in emptiness, purified through emptiness—so it is called.
[3966] If view is concealed and the other two are revealed and emerge, through grasp-free knowledge arising directionlessly,
[3967] Awareness without object, liberation beyond concepts—so it is called.
[3968] The second: concealing two, revealing one:
[3969] If meditation is revealed and emerges, awareness free from aim arises—causeless fruition abides in itself—so it is called.
[3970] If conduct is revealed and emerges, body cast to the precipice, mind sent to dharmatā—so it is called.
[3971] If view is revealed and emerges, mind delivered to emptiness, body and speech brought to the essential point—so it is called.
[3972] The fourth: the essence of self-clarifying explanation—word-attachment's stream is cut, the established view does not dwell, the establishment is specially supreme, || 80 ||
[3973] Self-nature not perceived, completely pure, primordial purity's dharmatā that arises directionlessly—so it is called,
[3974] Characteristic not mind, self-pure movement, without done to the basis—so it is called.
[3975] That divided, there are three:
[3976] <list> Speaking in the manner of error's messenger,
[3977] <list> Speaking in the manner of reversing error at its basis,
[3978] <list> Speaking of the bindu brought to its own vital point.
[3979] The first essence: error's root, ignorance, laid as the basis of saṃsāra in the three realms,
[3980] That same one pursuing itself, ignorance's root is cut.
[3981] Called "first self-awareness."
[3982] Self-nature arising as manifold, through the messenger of cause and condition pursuing, || 90 ||
[3983] The focus on objects severed, saṃsāra and error's basis exhausted—causeless emptiness, primordially pure, so it is called.
[3984] Through error being self-purified in characteristic, the path of error's knowledge is exhausted, so it is called.
[3985] That divided, there are three:
[3986] <list> The manner of cutting error at the root, reversing the view of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
[3987] <list> The manner of leaving error to itself, recognizing the dharmatā of non-error,
[3988] <list> The manner of embracing the basis of error, cutting the stream of error's wheel.
[3989] The first essence:
[3990] Error's root—awareness that is the same, knowing itself as self-liberated—primordial error that is not experienced, seal obtained, beyond error and impurity,
[3991] Self-nature as different error, the measure of all imagination obtained, beyond object and subject.
[3992] Characteristic: knowing error as error, the heat and measure of non-error obtained. || 100 ||
[3993] The second essence:
