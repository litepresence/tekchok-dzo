[4805] The arising-basis of letters, their sounds and meanings hereby declared.

[4807] Though explanation methods are manifold, in summary they are established as three.
[4808] From Rigpa Rangdrol:
[4809] The King of Teachings' manner of explanation also
[4810] Is expounded according to this very occasion.
[4811] Scripture-style explanation and Tantra-style explanation,
[4812] Instruction-style explanation—these three.
[4813] Through the gate of entry they are to be known.
[4814] Thus it is spoken.
[4815] There, scripture-style explanation is shown by means of the five perfections,
[4816] Tantra-style explanation is declared by means of the three definite abodes,
[4817] Oral instruction is explained by basis, path, and result—these three, from which
[4818] Here the main Tantra-style explanation has three abodes:
[4819] For the sharp-facultied, by mentioning names, toward realization's face the Tantra's name-meaning is expressed;
[4820] For the middling, by mentioning types only, toward realization's face the five perfect complete-abidings are shown; and
[4821] For the dull, with example and meaning, toward realization's face the body is extensively explained.
[4822] FIRST:
[4823] From that itself:
[4824] That also name explained is like this:
[4825] Name, homage, and promise.
[4826] Thus it is spoken.
[4827] SECOND:
[4828] Also from that itself:
[4829] The introduction shown is like this:
[4830] Teacher, Mother, and the retinue, and
[4831] Father's request—all are to be known.
[4832] Thus it is spoken.

[4835] Conclusion with meaning and rejoicing,
[4836] From Rangdrol:
[4837] Text shown is like this:
[4838] Sūtra and great extensive, and
[4839] Extremely great extensive explained.
[4840] That is shown by the text's words.
[4841] Conclusion's meaning is like this:
[4842] Oral instruction meaning untied explained,
[4843] That great Tantra is definitely shown.
[4844] Secret mantra all's explanation method—
[4845] Thus all are to be known.

[4855] Thus it is spoken.
[4856] Thus, when not explained, the defects are:
[4857] From that itself:
[4858] If history meaning is not explained,
[4859] Toward this Secret Great Definite Teaching,
[4860] The defect of mind-not-believing arises.
[4861] If root meaning is not explained,
[4862] Dharmas are not gathered into Rigpa—
[4863] The defect of limitless arises.
[4864] If yoga meaning is not explained,
[4865] Vehicle distinctions are not divided—
[4866] Big and small ranks become meaningless.
[4867] If great meaning is not explained,
[4868] Toward Great Perfection without effort—
[4869] The defect of meaninglessness arises.
[4870] If word meaning is not explained,
[4871] When tantras are clearly ranked,
[4872] The defect of not grasping letters arises.
[4873] Thus it is spoken.

[4875] From that itself:
[4876] Thus, when defects are abandoned,
[4877] All qualities become perfect.
[4878] Thus it is spoken.
[4879] The purpose is:
[4880] From Rigpa Rangdrol:
[4881] To protect one's own view and
[4882] To refute others' views—
[4883] Also called "to explain."
[4884] Thus it is spoken.
[4885] When extensively enumerated with certainty:
[4886] Various jewel examples: twenty-three,
