[18274] <prose> First, the essential nature of Wisdom (jñāna) is the self-knowing awareness (rigpa) that dwells primordially as omniscient clarity.
[18275] <prose> Regarding this:
[18276] <prose> It is called "wisdom" because of its primordial dwelling.
[18277] <verse> Through realizing its characteristic marks,
[18278] <verse> One does not abide in the duality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[18279] <verse> Thus it is said.
[18280] <prose> The definitive term: understanding and knowing the meaning of primordial dwelling,
[18281] <prose> Arising from self-manifestation.
[18282] <verse> Primordially, the nature spontaneously accomplished,
[18283] <verse> From that, realization becomes manifest.
[18284] <verse> This is the definitive term for wisdom.
[18285] <verse> Thus it is said.
[18286] <prose> Divided, there is: the wisdom of basis-abiding, || 10 ||
[18287] <prose> The wisdom of characteristic-holding,
[18288] <prose> And the wisdom pervading objects—these three.
[18289] <prose><tantra> From the Mu Tig Phreng Ba (Pearl Garland):
[18290] <prose> Wisdom itself is like this:
[18291] <verse> The wisdom of basis-abiding purity,
[18292] <verse> Characteristic-holding and pervading objects—
[18293] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[18294] <prose> First, regarding the wisdom of basis-abiding, there are three types:
[18295] <prose> The wisdom of primordial purity (ka dag) is like space, transcending the extremes of existence and non-existence.
[18296] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[18297] <prose> Regarding the wisdom of primordial purity:
[18298] <verse> Non-awareness is called existence—no name, no non-existence,
[18299] <verse> No number of one or two, || 20 ||
[18300] <verse> Established by conceptualization—no existence, no non-existence,
[18301] <verse> Where there is no division in dharmatā,
[18302] <verse> Not even wisdom alone is established,
[18303] <verse> No words, no expression is established.
[18304] <verse> Not abiding in extremes—self-knowing purity,
[18305] <verse> Expression-holding names, extremes exhausted.
[18306] <verse> No cause, no number of conditions,
[18307] <verse> No duality of appearance, object and subject,
[18308] <verse> Characteristics nowhere divided,
[18309] <verse> Object-conditions, coarse, self-exhausted. || 30 ||
[18310] <verse> Primordially non-existent, therefore pure, pure,
[18311] <verse> Confused cognition ceased, not engaging in anything,
[18312] <verse> Unborn, therefore cessation-empty.
[18313] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[18314] <prose> The wisdom of spontaneous perfection (lhun grub) is primordially complete with qualities—like a wish-fulfilling jewel arising from the ground of potency and manifestation—its essence appearing yet empty of entity and characteristics.
[18315] <prose> Again, from that itself:
[18316] <prose> It is called the wisdom of spontaneous perfection.
[18317] <verse> Unborn, unceasing, not thinking anything,
[18318] <verse> Because objects are definitely pure, non-existent,
[18319] <verse> Because potency and qualities are unceasing, non-existent,
[18320] <verse> Merely play-appearances, || 40 ||
[18321] <verse> The ground-mother of various completeness,
[18322] <verse> Non-existent reason, therefore appearance; appearance reason, therefore empty,
[18323] <verse> Appearance-emptiness, limbs of engagement.
[18324] <verse> Buddha and sentient beings, pure objects,
[18325] <verse> This ground called evident-abiding,
[18326] <verse> Merely abiding as own-nature,
[18327] <verse> Essence of parts, empty through conceptualization.
[18328] <verse> Limbs emanate, therefore complete knowledge,
[18329] <verse> Self-abiding, spontaneously accomplished reason,
[18330] <verse> This has no abandoning or accepting, no duality. || 50 ||
[18331] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[18332] <prose> The wisdom of all-pervading compassion is without self-face yet manifests as the root pervading the ground of manifestation.
[18333] <prose> Again, from that itself:
[18334] <prose> The wisdom of all-pervading compassion:
[18335] <verse> Exhaustless, manifold gates of manifestation,
[18336] <verse> Complete in essence like exhausted appearance,
[18337] <verse> From the empty nature of Dharmakāya,
[18338] <verse> The wisdom portion of complete knowledge,
[18339] <verse> By force manifesting to sentient beings,
[18340] <verse> Without this, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa hosts severed,
[18341] <verse> Known by knowledge, clear, || 60 ||
[18342] <verse> From the nature of self-knowing clarity,
[18343] <verse> Compassion itself, the force of nature.
[18344] <verse> Unceasing, no cessation,
[18345] <verse> From the pure portion of manifestation,
[18346] <verse> Without action and complete in oneness,
[18347] <verse> Like light from the sun,
[18348] <verse> Self-possessed, without obstruction.
[18349] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[18350] <prose> Second, the wisdom of characteristic-holding has five roots and twenty-five divisions.
[18351] <prose> The five roots, from self-manifestation:
[18352] <verse> Dharmadhātu wisdom, without concept,
[18353] <verse> Mirror-like wisdom, unceasing clarity, || 70 ||
[18354] <verse> Wisdom of equality, complete, unmixed,
[18355] <verse> Discriminating wisdom, realized as before,
[18356] <verse> All-accomplishing wisdom, dharmas complete—
[18357] <verse> Thus regarded as five aspects.
[18358] <verse> Thus it is said.
[18359] <prose> Elaborating extensively on the meaning of those:
[18360] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[18361] <prose> Regarding the characteristic-holding:
[18362] <verse> Explaining the wisdom of Saṃbhogakāya,
[18363] <verse> From mirror-like wisdom, reflections,
[18364] <verse> Complete in shape and color appearances,
[18365] <verse> White, pure of stains, therefore light,
[18366] <verse> Self-possessed appearances connecting saṃsāra-nirvāṇa, || 80 ||
[18367] <verse> Because all dharmas appear as forms,
[18368] <verse> Called self-knowing wisdom.
[18369] <verse> Clear and empty, liberated by emptiness,
[18370] <verse> Liberation-holding, exhausting thoughts of extremes,
[18371] <verse> Without placement, complete liberation ground.
[18372] <verse> That which is called equality
[18373] <verse> Is equality from two equal causes and three equal conditions,
[18374] <verse> By equal time and measure,
[18375] <verse> Without duality, free from class,
[18376] <verse> Without division, without distinction, self-abiding two, || 90 ||
[18377] <verse> Equality called dharmatā,
[18378] <verse> Free from elaboration of suffering,
[18379] <verse> Itself called without modification and effort,
[18380] <verse> Abiding as nature, essence empty.
[18381] <verse> Mind itself, all thoughts exhausted,
[18382] <verse> Called wisdom-abiding,
[18383] <verse> Through realizing that characteristic,
[18384] <verse> Not abiding in saṃsāra-nirvāṇa duality.
[18385] <verse> Discriminating types of sense faculties,
[18386] <verse> Whatever appears as that dharma,
[18387] <verse> Each sequence clear, || 100 ||
[18388] <verse> Pure through conceptualized self-appearance,
[18389] <verse> Awareness becoming object itself,
[18390] <verse> Each called distinction,
[18391] <verse> Arising as antidote method,
[18392] <verse> Realization called seeing characteristics.
[18393] <verse> With increase of self-appearance,
[18394] <verse> Wisdom first arising, || 110 ||
[18395] <verse> Pure of affliction faults by knowledge,
[18396] <verse> Called accomplishing action,
[18397] <verse> Self-ceasing effort and struggle,
[18398] <verse> All dharmas self-placed, self-liberated,
[18399] <verse> From ground-appearance of complete self-liberation,
[18340] <verse> Obtaining stainless, dust-free subtle parts,
[18341] <verse> Transcending objects of thought-investigation,
[18342] <verse> The undivided dharmatā of what,
[18343] <verse> Self-nature complete, exhausting appearance limit,
[18344] <verse> Simultaneously realized, || 120 ||
[18345] <verse> Free from desire through accomplishment,
[18346] <verse> Without return or reversion,
[18347] <verse> The meaning itself of primordial abiding,
[18348] <verse> Becoming manifest through knowing,
[18349] <verse> Reaching the ground of exhausted dharmas,
[18350] <verse> Vast dimension of dharmas,
[18351] <verse> Not observing extremes and middle,
[18352] <verse> Pure dharmatā of liberation ground,
[18353] <verse> Dharmas acting, doing. || 130 ||
[18354] <verse> Without transcended and worldly action,
[18355] <verse> Clear and pure nature,
[18356] <verse> Dimension opening opportunity,
[18357] <verse> Self-arisen great abiding,
[18358] <verse> Primordial complete self-nature,
[18359] <verse> Without beginning modification,
[18360] <verse> Knowing liberation from saṃsāra-nirvāṇa duality,
[18361] <verse> Complete intention of self-appearance.
[18362] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[18363] <prose> Moreover, in the portion of compassion, there is wisdom gathered by knowing and wisdom gathered by objects of knowledge—these two also abide.
[18364] <verse> Wisdom gathered by knowing also abides as two:
[18365] <prose> Wisdom gathered by knowing is the self-clear manifest intention of Buddha body and wisdom abiding in Buddhas, and || 140 ||
[18366] <prose> The subtle essence abiding in the hearts of sentient beings.
[18367] <prose> Regarding that:
[18368] <prose> Wisdom gathered by knowing.
[18369] <verse> All Buddhas and sentient beings,
[18370] <verse> Without distinction, pervaded by non-existent own-nature,
[18371] <verse> That and Buddhas completely pure, complete,
[18372] <verse> Abiding stainless and dust-free,
[18373] <verse> From the six types of sentient being appearance aspects,
[18374] <verse> Each abiding in their own continuum.
[18375] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[18376] <prose> Regarding wisdom gathered by objects of knowledge—two:
[18377] <prose> Knowing how much of knowable object-aspects appear, all without mixing individually by knowledge, and || 150 ||
[18378] <prose> Knowing how the abiding mode of knowable objects is like space, free from elaboration.
[18379] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[18380] <prose> Wisdom gathered by objects of knowledge.
[18381] <verse> Know as two aspects:
[18382] <verse> Explain how much can be known of that,
[18383] <verse> This knows the thoughts of disciples,
[18384] <verse> Understanding others' benefit,
[18385] <verse> Knowing the nature of dharmas,
[18386] <verse> Called the abiding mode of "how,"
[18387] <verse> Through complete without remainder by how much,
[18388] <verse> Primordially benefiting all sentient beings,
[18389] <verse> Extracting from the three realms by knowing, || 160 ||
[18390] <verse> The knowledge portion of emanation body,
[18391] <verse> Complete in the face of self-appearance,
[18392] <verse> Explaining wisdom of how-knowing,
[18393] <verse> Free from expression-ground possessing appearance,
[18394] <verse> Clear reflection of pure self-appearance,
[18395] <verse> Knowing the abiding mode of entity,
[18396] <verse> Exhausting confusion continuum through realizing self-benefit,
[18397] <verse> Called the abiding mode of "how,"
[18398] <verse> Conduct without wandering in view,
[18399] <verse> Complete because knowing ceases without ceasing, || 170 ||
[18400] <verse> Primordially becoming path,
[18401] <verse> Knowing measure reached,
[18402] <verse> Great self-liberation without modification,
[18403] <verse> Without movement from the ground.
[18404] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[18405] <prose> The division of wisdom into twenty-five:
[18406] <prose><tantra> From the heart-mirror of Vajrasattva:
[18407] <verse> Kye ho! Secret Lord, listen!
[18408] <verse> Regarding the five aspects of wisdom,
[18409] <verse> Five times five makes twenty-five—know thus,
[18410] <verse> The divisions of that are like this: || 180 ||
[18411] <verse> The wisdom of dimension,
[18412] <verse> The wisdom of dharmadhātu,
[18413] <verse> The wisdom of completely pure dimension,
[18414] <verse> The wisdom of great dimension,
[18415] <verse> The wisdom of non-duality of all dimensions—these five.
[18416] <verse> Mirror-like wisdom,
[18417] <verse> Great mirror-like wisdom,
[18418] <verse> Wisdom of concept-free clarity,
[18419] <verse> Wisdom of concept-free purity,
[18420] <verse> Wisdom of clarity without holding—these five. || 190 ||
[18421] <verse> Wisdom of equality,
[18422] <verse> Wisdom of equality through cessation,
[18423] <verse> Wisdom of unmoving equality,
[18424] <verse> Wisdom of unceasing equality,
[18425] <verse> Wisdom of equality not abiding in anything—these five.
[18426] <verse> Discriminating wisdom,
[18427] <verse> Wisdom thoroughly distinguishing all meanings,
[18428] <verse> Wisdom arising in moment of thought,
[18429] <verse> Wisdom completely removing all sounds,
[18430] <verse> Wisdom understanding without abiding in sound and word—these five. || 200 ||
[18431] <verse> All-accomplishing wisdom,
[18432] <verse> Wisdom doing all actions,
[18433] <verse> Wisdom not abiding in action,
[18434] <verse> Wisdom free from action,
[18435] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[18436] <prose> Explaining the meaning of those:
[18437] <prose> From the Rigpa Rangshar Tantra:
[18438] <prose> The expanse of pure dharmatā vast,
[18439] <verse> Explained as the completely pure dimension,
[18440] <verse> Abandoning all concept-free thoughts,
[18441] <verse> The great clear wisdom of dimension,
[18442] <verse> Outer and inner empty, without awareness—
[18443] <verse> This is the great clear wisdom of dimension. || 210 ||
[18444] <verse> Outer appearance, empty, without duality—
[18445] <verse> Regard as the great wisdom of dimension.
[18446] <verse> Outer, inner, secret words all complete,
[18447] <verse> This is the wisdom of dharmadhātu.
[18448] <verse> The meaning possessing non-duality, vajra-meaning,
[18449] <verse> Regard as the essence of non-dual dimension.
[18450] <verse> The meaning of great unceasing clarity and purity,
[18451] <verse> This is mirror-like wisdom.
[18452] <verse> In the pure, clear, pure essence, || 220 ||
[18453] <verse> Complete in one time of pure appearance,
[18454] <verse> This is the great mirror-like wisdom.
[18455] <verse> Without conceptual mind, without mind,
[18456] <verse> Not entering attachment-holding,
[18457] <verse> This is the wisdom of concept-free clarity.
[18458] <verse> Light-appearance unbroken, clear,
[18459] <verse> Mind's thoughts not wavering,
[18460] <verse> This is the wisdom of concept-free purity.
[18461] <verse> Clear, clear-agent, free from dharmas,
[18462] <verse> If thoughts do not waver to that,
[18463] <verse> This is the wisdom of clarity without holding.
[18464] <verse> Equal to dharmatā, unmixed, || 230 ||
[18465] <verse> This is the wisdom of equality.
[18466] <verse> Without ceasing, holding each characteristic,
[18467] <verse> This is the wisdom of equality.
[18468] <verse> Unmoving body of scope,
[18469] <verse> Scope cut, no fall into extremes,
[18470] <verse> This is the unmoving wisdom of equality.
[18471] <verse> Unceasing, clear, pure, great,
[18472] <verse> Mind not thinking, clear,
[18473] <verse> This is the wisdom of equality.
[18474] <verse> The peak of all wisdom not abiding in anything,
[18475] <verse> Liberating self-place of sign-entity, || 240 ||
[18476] <verse> This is the wisdom of equality not abiding in anything.
[18477] <verse> Mind appearing, liberating essence of doubt,
[18478] <verse> This is the great discriminating wisdom.
[18479] <verse> Manifold gathered as one,
[18480] <verse> From that, all meanings arise.
[18481] <verse> This is the wisdom distinguishing all meanings.
[18482] <verse> Not transcending meaning of thought,
[18483] <verse> Liberating three moments,
[18484] <verse> This is the wisdom arising in a moment. || 250 ||
[18485] <verse> Transcending awareness-essence of sound and word,
[18486] <verse> Reason of one complete convention,
[18487] <verse> This is the wisdom removing all sounds.
[18488] <verse> Complete nature of all sound and word,
[18489] <verse> Transcending words of awareness-expanse,
[18490] <verse> This is the wisdom not abiding in word.
[18491] <verse> Self-knowing, holding, dharma-liberated,
[18492] <verse> Abandoning convention, label, name,
[18493] <verse> This is the all-accomplishing wisdom.
[18494] <verse> Mind pervading ten directions of light-rays, || 260 ||
[18495] <verse> Reason for doing benefit of emanation beings,
[18496] <verse> This is the wisdom doing action.
[18497] <verse> Wisdom's nature without movement—action released,
[18498] <verse> Transcending sign-entity of dharmas,
[18499] <verse> This is the wisdom not abiding in action.
[18500] <verse> Clear without awareness-concept,
[18501] <verse> Knowing nature leisurely,
[18502] <verse> This is the wisdom of action-release.
[18503] <verse> All outer, inner, secret dharmas,
[18504] <verse> Gathering all of awareness-expanse,
[18505] <verse> This is the wisdom severing all superimposition. || 270 ||
[18506] <prose> Thus apply the meaning of wisdom:
[18507] <prose> Those desiring nirvāṇa,
[18508] <prose> If they abide in this, obtain non-duality,
[18509] <prose> The three bodies do not return to the ground.
[18510] <prose> The sign of wisdom's example, that
[18511] <prose> Thus it is said.
[18512] <prose> Third.
[18513] <prose> The heart-mirror of Vajra mind. || 280 ||
[18514] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[18515] <verse> From dharma nature's self-resonance, free of concept,
[18516] <verse> Arising wisdom-appearance without objects,
[18517] <verse> That yogin complete in wisdom,
[18518] <verse> Correct gathering of limbs.
[18519] <verse> Wisdom's essential point arises in the eye,
[18520] <verse> Knowing the manner of gaze,
[18521] <verse> Conduct together with dharmadhātu dimension,
[18522] <verse> Exhausting three realms by reason,
[18523] <verse> Root of arising in the eye socket,
[18524] <verse> Wisdom descending upward-reverse. || 290 ||
[18525] <verse> What is the essential point arising wisdom?
[18526] <verse> Possessing sequence, dharma nature,
[18527] <verse> Liberating all definite thoughts,
[18528] <verse> Wisdom arising from dimension.
[18529] <verse> Upper and lower eye essential point.
[18530] <verse> Skilled effort, nose channel arises,
[18531] <verse> All-gathering wisdom appearance,
[18532] <verse> Again eye wisdom,
[18533] <verse> Thoroughly divided by five colors,
[18534] <verse> Similar to complete maṇḍala form,
[18535] <verse> What arises from this experience, || 300 ||
[18536] <verse> Unable to express by non-existence,
[18537] <verse> E ma! Wonderful! Great itself!
[18538] <verse> Appearance of complete qualities,
[18539] <verse> Subtle wisdom pervading great parts,
[18540] <verse> Direct and path.
[18541] <verse> Thus it is proclaimed.
[18542] <prose> That indicates: object-appearances, appearances immediately self-liberated wisdom, and
[18543] <prose> Empty wisdom, and
[18544] <prose> Object wisdom—these three.
