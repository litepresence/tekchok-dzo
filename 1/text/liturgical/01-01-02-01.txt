[175] Having first received the path from Samantabhadra, generating bodhicitta, thus arose.
[176] Thus Samantabhadra's purpose-accomplishment through tantra is called.
[177] In certain treatises this sequence appears:
[178] From Buddha comes dharma, from dharma come the arya hosts.
[179] Such is the meaning of this order.
[180] Second: Regarding Vajradhara's manner of obtaining peace in this field—
[181] Some say from the first Protector
[182] Beings of different tantras generate mind—this view is invalid,
[183] For the Magical Vairotsana declares:
[184] "First Buddha, Buddha of earth,
[185] Great hero and great destroyer"—
[186] Thus.
[187] "This teacher is Vajradhara,
[188] Buddha before all Buddhas"—
[189] Thus spoke the Bhagavan, contradicting that view.
[190] Therefore, for the purpose of beings in this field, in the first time, through Samantabhadra's own emanations, displaying as ordinary beings generating mind, then demonstrating Buddhahood and opening the great play of enlightened activity.
[191] Such manner is also renowned in common sutras.

[192] From the Meeting of Father and Son:
[193] "Great hero, skilled in skillful-means,
[194] For the complete ripening of sentient-beings,
[195] Though becoming buddha ten-million times,
[196] Still you guide, O Teacher,
[197] Demonstrating many Buddhas"—
[198] Thus.
[199] From the Flower Ornament:
[200] "Having attained the ocean of supreme enlightenment,
[201] For the complete ripening of the ocean of sentient-beings,
[202] Demonstrating the ocean of bodhicitta generation,
[203] Showing the ocean of conduct undiminished through all time—
[204] Such is the emanation of the Sugatas."
[205] Thus spoke the Bhagavan.
[206] Therefore, the first Protector, intending to tame this realm, displayed through emanations that manner of mind-generation—
[207] Regarding this Fortunate Eon, before immeasurable eons past,
[208] In the field called "Self-Nature Completely Arranged,"
[209] To Buddha Flower-Great-Beauty offered one golden vajra, generating supreme bodhicitta as the first mind.
[210] Then in the second birth, in the north, "Wind-Movement Arranged," becoming householder Good-Give's son called Jewel-Garland,
[211] Dwelt near Buddha Wheel-Well-Conduct, hearing Dharma.
[212] Then passed beyond, born as a son called "Lightning-Light" in the Bliss-Intoxicated Island, the brahmin youth Good-Give.
[213] At that time, heard Dharma from Buddha Good-Intelligence for five years, and for seven years abided in single-pointed samadhi.
[214] At seventy-five years, demonstrated manifest complete Buddhahood upon the peak of the mountain called "Jewel-Precious-Heap-Arranged."
[215] Having dwelt for one great eon in the meaning of dharma-body,
[216] Then self-arose as the Victor's enjoyment-complete body in ornament and color wheel.
[217] From the spreading-gathering of light-rays, arose thirty-six self-arisen tantras.
[218] 

[219] From the bindu of light, abiding, established sixty complete perfections,
[220] Buddha-bodies hundred-thousand countless, inexpressible, self-appearing;
[221] From the tongue-faculty of those appearing as five-family Buddhas, immeasurable light-rays radiate forth, all through the proclaimed sound of self-arisen six syllables, compassion without activity radiates in ten directions.
[222] From that very state, Buddha Vairochana the great manifest, body with principal and retinue countless, dharmatā Samantabhadra's complete enjoyment gathering,
[223] Great Perfection's body blazes with light.
[224] Likewise Akṣobhya,
[225] Ratnasaṃbhava,
[226] Amitābha,
[227] Amoghasiddhi and so forth, with individual mandalas and retinues countless, inexpressible,
[228] Gathering in his own complete enjoyment, Great Perfection's body blazes with light.
[229] At that time, in Light-House completely pure, supremely well-arranged upper dwelling,
[230] Teacher Completely Pure, Self-Knowing Awareness King, Vairochana Gang-chen-mtsho by name,
[231] Became lord of all mandalas.
[232] Body-speech-mind without fabrication, precious teaching's state unmoving,
[233] Non-arising,
[234] Non-abiding,
[235] Non-taking,
[236] Non-rejecting,
[237] Non-moving itself self-arisen.
[238] At that time, the tamer of those not to be tamed, precious beautiful retinue assembly hundred-thousand countless,
[239] From his own body,
[240] Speech,
[241] Mind,
[242] Qualities,
[243] Activities themselves radiate and gather.
[244] Thus all appearances—upper
[245] And lower,
[246] Ten directions' worlds—not being,
[247] All completely pure, dense arrangement, blissful field, self-appearance completely pure, self-arisen Buddha-field clearly became.
[248] From that very appearance-aspect, marks and characteristics complete, the arising of Vajradhara's qualities complete body:

[249] From offering a vajra as basis for mind-generation arose this.
[250] That merit pure, body appears without nature,
[251] Accumulation pure,
[252] Mind's great wisdom conducts all aspects known.
[253] Thus in dharma-body time, when place, dharma-sphere, object, and thought are pure,
[254] Teacher Samantabhadra's natural activities all complete, perfectly accomplished and abides.
[255] Upon one particle of retinue, particles-number Buddhas countless, with teaching actual nature, dzogchen dharma-nature vajra whoever—uncompounded.
[256] When viewing dharma-nature, pure conduct, perfections five abide.
[257] In this time, body-speech-mind inexhaustible, ornament-wheel activities thirty-six.
[258] Body's outer activities four:
[259] Unchanging,
[260] Uncoming,
[261] Ungoing,
[262] Non-abiding.
[263] Inner four:
[264] Non-appearing,
[265] Non-doing,
[266] Non-radiating,
[267] Non-gathering.
[268] Secret four:
[269] Clear-open,
[270] Even,
[271] Loose,
[272] Direct.
[273] Speech's outer activities four:
[274] Inexpressible,
[275] Unshowable,
[276] Unseeable,
[277] Unslightable.
[278] Inner four:
[279] Natural,
[280] Passing,
[281] Objectless,
[282] Nonplural.
[283] Secret four:
[284] Fresh,
[285] Innate,
[286] Natural,

[290] Lion-display samadhi,
[291] Hero-going samadhi,
[292] Wish-fulfilling jewel pinnacle samadhi.
[293] Inner four:
[294] Victory-banner peak play,
[295] Lightning garland,
[296] Great wheel,
[297] Light-blazing samadhi.
[298] Secret four:

[299] Mudrā's subjugation,
[300] Great-blaze's equality,
[301] Diversity of dharmatā,
[302] Samadhi called "self-appearing spontaneous adornment."
[303] Those also not the activity of meaning's agent,
[304] But called "activity" through the arising of qualities' essence and radiance.
[305] From that, enjoyment-complete body's self-arising:
[306] From the play of unobstructed radiance of former appearances and compassion's arising manner,
[307] The pure abodes are densely arranged.
[308] From the equal-expanse gesture of the great ocean's teacher of complete manifestation—at the lotus-pericarp's base from the thumb, upon the tiny protuberances, upon the layered arrangement of thirty-two realms, the appearances abiding as layered masses, with varied colors and forms like water and moon—
[309] All layered masses as well, infinite and vast like palace arrangements.
[310] In arrangements like descending offering-feast houses.
[311] The bodies of five-family Buddhas as well, all-enumerable in variety.
[312] In the perfume-water stream below the lotus-throne, infinite.
[313] The sixteen sixteen realms as well, not as layered masses.
[314] Like infinite jewel-umbrella arrangements.
[315] In arrangements like mutual grain-pile masses, also enumerable including five-family Buddhas.
[316] Furthermore, from all pores of hair-light, radiating into space—also infinite enumerable variety of realms and teachers, boundless, measureless, infinite.
[317] Thus in enjoyment-body's realm:
[318] Teaching actual, speech self-arisen syllables whoever not made, yet all teaching's sons and simultaneous appearances those abide—
[319] At the time of unchanging dharmatā.
[320] From the thirty-six self-arisen activities of the enjoyment-body's body, speech, mind inexhaustible ornament-wheel:
[321] The body's four outer activities:
[322] Through body appearing without self-nature, obscurations are purified.

[323] By perfected wisdom face-hand, the body's self-nature is perfected.
[324] By clear light face-hand, self-appearance is liberated.
[325] By clear discerning face-hand, knowledge is perfected.
[326] The four of the inner:
[327] By appearance of the thirty-two marks, the body's qualities are perfected.
[328] By possessing the eighty signs, reality is perfected.
[329] By emanating masses of light-rays, special qualities are perfected.
[330] By face pervasively residing in all directions, the characteristic of enjoyment is perfected.
[331] The four of the secret:
[332] By residing without front or back, the aspect of appearance is perfected.
[333] Looking from inside, by outer clarity, the quality of empty aspect is perfected.
[334] Looking from outside, by inner clarity, the quality of non-duality is perfected.
[335] By tip pervasively residing in all directions, the quality of non-dwelling without cessation is perfected.
[336] The four outer deeds of speech:
[337] By six self-arisen syllables emanating from tongue, immeasurable reality deeds are perfected.
[338] By entering the father's face, enjoyment of markless dharma is made.
[339] By emerging from mother's space, engagement with non-dual reality is made.
[340] By that same emanating and gathering, deeds without nature are perfected.
[341] The four of the inner:
[342] By self-nature explained, control of inexpressible sound is made.
[343] By non-word, enjoyment of reality beyond speech and thought is made.
[344] By appearing as understood meaning, enjoyment of non-composite reality is made.
[345] By many light-rays emanating from face, enjoyment of disciple and discipliner dharma is made.
[346] The four of the secret:
[347] By pure body practice, engagement with self-arisen dharma is made.
[348] By pure speech practice, engagement with outflow-free dharma is made.
[349] By pure mind practice, enjoyment of wisdom knowing all aspects is made.

[350] By pure face practice, enjoyment of all-knowing dharma is performed.
[351] The four outer deeds of mind:

[353] By samadhi of pure wisdom view, equipoise knowing is perfected.
[354] By samadhi of pure dharma-nature, knowing dharma general and self-characteristic is performed.

[363] By abiding in non-dual appearance-emptiness, object-wisdom two non-dual is performed.
[364] By abiding in non-dual awareness-emptiness, apprehension-apprehender two non-dual is performed.
[365] By abiding in non-dual object-mind, the concept limit of apprehension-apprehender is cut.
[366] Third, the method of turning the wheel through emanation-body emanation:
[367] Then from enjoyment-body appearance, gone to emanation-body, those gone having clearly emanated twelve earth teachers in twelve abodes,
[368] Possessing the nature of five-five perfections.
[369] At the time of these, also by appearance of three great emanations, benefit to beings is performed.
[370] By emanation-body in this Jambu continent, place of disciples,
[371] The Dharma-body teaching, self-arisen from Great Perfection blessing, filling the hands of people from Vajra Amitayus self-born from one hundred jewel causes until now,
[372] The Enjoyment-body teaching, self-arisen from Self-arisen teaching single-son blessing, self-born from one hundred jewel causes, four books of letters, renowned as dharma self-sound.

[373] The body-form self-born without anyone making, equal to beings' body bulk, self-arisen from twelve emanation-body blessings, from one hundred jewel causes.
[374] Those three emanations of body, speech, mind, not made by anyone, fearless.
[375] By self-arisen blessing, miracles and immeasurable qualities.
[376] Possessing the activity of immediately liberating birth when meeting with whichever.
[377] That also, the mind-support Vajra, from disease-free of those beings wishing to pacify disease,
[378] Fulfilling desires and applying to liberation.
[379] The speech-support self-arisen letter, meeting with that,
[380] Liberated by merely meeting and hearing the sound.
[381] This book, writing and holding, possesses liberating activity without effort.
[382] That body performs liberating activity into clear light when meeting with whichever body.
[383] Where these exist, one asks.
[384] They abide in different places by the times of body, speech, mind teachings.
[385] That also, from Amitayus life, from the time of thousand Buddhas, the body-taming teaching,
[386] Exists three times five hundred five thousand years.
[387] Then until seventy years of life, the speech-taming teaching,
[388] One five hundred five thousand years.
[389] Then until ten years of life, the mind-taming teaching,
[390] One five hundred five thousand years.
[391] In the interval of those life years, that much year exists but not time,
[392] The year numbers tamed by those teachings are explained.
[393] That also, at the time of body teaching, that Vajra exists in the island possessing salty taste, Uddiyana land ocean,
[394] Occasionally making countless emanations possessing light, sound, and monk miracle arise.
[395] The letter, held by dakinis in the sky above five hundred leagues of Vajra-seat, abides.
[396] The body abides together with that.
[397] At the time of speech teaching.

[398] The vajra at Mount Malaya, at the hand-vajra's abode, yakṣa kings render homage.
[399] The syllable in Vajrāsana's upper sky, held by ḍākinīs abides.
[400] The body, not fixed in one place, circumambulates Jambudvīpa,
[401] Making offering-fields for special assemblies of gods and humans;
[402] When harm arises to the teaching,
[403] From body comes light,
[404] hūṃ
[405] From eyes comes fire, turning back the harm.
[406] At the time of mind's teaching, the vajra abides in Vajrāsana's sky.
[407] The syllable abides in the extremely wrathful ṛṣi's cave.
[408] The body in the thirty-three gods' measureless palace,
[409] The hand-vajra's house upper-chamber's upper-story abides.
[410] Such three emanations abiding, Jambudvīpa surpasses all others.
[411] The manner of twelve emanation-bodies arriving in twelve abode-types:

[498] These from Rig-pa-rang-shar-great tantra:
[499] At beginningless time,
[500] "My precious jewel lost,
[501] By jewel-lost self-nature,
[502] From darkness-appearance interval came,
[503] By four conditions concept impure,
[504] To Tuṣita upper-chamber land came,
[505] Support is pure lotus,
[506] Secret mantra great teaching established,
[507] Near retinue is Akṣobhya,
[508] Tantra's king Thal-'gyur taught,"
[509] Thus and so forth;

[510] Also extensively quoted from Ati-koṭa-great taught at turquoise-script.
[511] These body-speech-mind inexhaustible ornament maṇḍala's thirty-six activities:
[512] Body's external four activities:
[513] Regarding abandoning four rivers of suffering,
[514] Birth,
[515] Marriage,
[516] Skill competition,
[517] Renunciation,
[518] Piṇḍapāta engagement.
[519] Internal four:
[520] Regarding abandoning retinue and enjoyment,
[521] Great-horse,
[522] Chariot abandoning,
[523] Essence going to bodhi,
[524] Emanating light-rays,
[525] Transforming weapon-rain to flowers.
[526] Secret four:
[527] Regarding taming with teaching's final samādhi,
[528] Making austerity,
[529] Immediately manifesting on Meru twenty-hundred-thousand samādhi-sounds in single instant,
[530] Constantly abiding in precious casket samādhi,
[531] Bodhi through vajra-like samādhi.
[532] Speech's external four activities:
[533] Sūtra-section,
[534] Verse intoned,
[535] Prophecy,
[536] Gāthā-section four.
[537] Internal four:
[538] Extremely extensive,
[539] Birth-stories,
[540] Nidāna saying,
[541] Thus arising four.
[542] Secret four:
[543] Udāna,
[544] Avadāna,
[545] Nipāta teaching,
[546] Adbhuta-dharma.
[547] Mind's external four:

[551] Casket samādhi.
[552] Internal four:

[557] Secret four:
[558] Pure movement,
[559] Profound appearance,
[560] Jewel-lamp,
[561] Supreme-good samādhi.
[562] Thus emanation-body,
[563] Complete-enjoyment,
[564] Dharma-body summarized, appearing as hundred-eight activities:

[565] Called the activity of the single self-nature of Vajradhara complete in qualities.
[566] These are called the succession transmitted by the Victor's intention,
[567] Only from Vajradhara arriving at different times,
[568] Called gathered by one intention or tantra.
[569] Thus, although the emanations of guides of fortunate aeons arriving later are different, in essence they are one in the self-nature of this very Vajradhara.
[570] Incidentally, the vidyādhara sign-transmitted
[571] And person ear-transmitted succession,
[572] Understand as individual biography and great history.
[573] By these, the teacher and teaching's descent manner is well explained.
[574] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[575] The manner of arising established, first chapter.
[576] Thus having shown the tamer teacher's history,
[577] Now from the definite abode where that teacher tames,
