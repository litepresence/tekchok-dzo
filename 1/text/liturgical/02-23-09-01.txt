[14823] First, self-appearance gradually arising—seven instants.
[14824] From self-appearance arisen, resting in its nature wondering "What am I in my own place?"—seven instants.


### PAGE 355

[14825] Knowing that as self-appearance, gradually gaining certainty—seven instants.
[14826] At the twenty-first, liberation in primordial purity;
[14827] Until not yet dissolved therein, emanating emanations,
[14828] Dissolving into primordial purity.
[14829] Though these twenty-one instants are equal, the days of meditation vary in number, therefore faculties are established as sharp or dull.
[14830] Calculating those days with instants,
[14831] The manner of faculty appearance, the enumeration of days,
[14832] And the various ways of emanating emanations,
[14833] From the Self-Arisen:
<verse> [14834] Some are liberated by white color,
<verse> [14835] Some by yellow color,
<verse> [14836] Some by red color,
<verse> [14837] Some by green color,
<verse> [14838] Some by blue color,
<verse> [14839] Some by all five colors,
<verse> [14840] Some by bindus and rays.
<verse> [14841] This is the manner of liberation for the last.
[14842] Thus it is spoken.
[14843] The manner of liberation for the last faculties is as follows:
[14844] The last taking hold of the ground endures fourteen days.
[14845] Of those, six in the upper and lower gatherings,
[14846] Five in Jñana,
[14847] The last abiding three days in spontaneous presence, seeing self-appearance, becomes Buddha.
[14848] Emanations too can accomplish benefit on the fortieth day.
[14849] The peak of the last:
[14850] Endures fifteen days,
[14851] Again gatherings and Jñana as before.
[14852] Abiding one day in spontaneous presence, the last too seeing self-appearance gains stability.
[14853] Emanations too can accomplish benefit on the forty-third day.
[14854] The supreme of the last:
[14855] Endures sixteen days,
[14856] Gatherings and Jñana as before.
[14857] Abiding five days in spontaneous presence, the last too seeing self-appearance gains stability.
[14858] Emanations too can accomplish benefit from the forty-sixth day.
[14859] The excellent of the last endures seventeen days,
[14860] Gatherings and Jñana as before.
[14861] Abiding six days in spontaneous presence, the last too seeing self-appearance gains stability.
[14862] Emanations too can accomplish benefit on the forty-seventh day.
[14863] The best of the last
[14864] Endures eighteen days,
[14865] Again six days in the gatherings,
[14866] Eight in Jñana,


### PAGE 356

[14867] Abiding three days in spontaneous presence, the last seeing self-appearance gains stability.
[14868] Emanations too can accomplish benefit on the fiftieth day.
[14869] The middling of the last:
[14870] Endures nineteen days,
[14871] Again twelve days in the gatherings,
[14872] Four abiding in Jñana.
[14873] All those faculties of sentient beings press down upon the ground of Buddhahood.
[14874] Those intermediate states too are like dreams—thus it is spoken.
[14875] The last of the last, being born as natural emanation, is explained here within the category of liberation.
[14876] These are the manners of faculty liberation—crucial points to be known.
[14877] The fourth general meaning: the existence intermediate state, instructions like placing a hook in a narrow ravine where the projection of karma continues—having two parts:
[14878] Brief indication of the manner of instruction, and extensive explanation of the intermediate state's own nature.
[14879] The first:
[14880] The existence intermediate state, like dream appearance, entering objects instantaneously without obstruction, the previous instants self-ceasing and dissolving, not apprehending their identity,
[14881] Now clear appearance exists directly, the restless, scattered, wandering going wherever thought directs, the wonder of traversing in an instant—at that time,
[14882] Those seeing this door, since the intermediate state's self-appearance will be recognized,
[14883] Merely by mentally creating the emanation realms of the ten directions, through the blessing of dharmatā's truth, born there, without intermediate state, becomes Buddha.
[14884] For this too, the prior instruction:
[14885] Now, Awareness from the eye or Brahma aperture, shooting like an arrow to the light sphere above.
[14886] The instruction for that time: remembering that realm, projecting east and so forth, Awareness is projected by its own momentum.
[14887] Those ordinary beings not seeing this door, trained in Dharma, hold the illusion body,
[14888] Train in unreality,
[14889] And through mentally creating pure realms, liberation is possible—explained as arising from individual practice texts.
[14890] Those not habituated to Dharma, by aspiring prayers to pure realms,


### PAGE 357

[14891] Taking refuge,
[14892] Turning from bad womb doors,
[14893] Choose the excellent.
<tantra> [14894] From the Golden Garland:
<verse> [14895] Delusion as the mere aspect of existence,
<verse> [14896] Self-appearance naturally appearing without nature,
<verse> [14897] Knowing self-appearance as natureless,
<verse> [14898] Remembering emanation liberates one's own continuum.
[14899] Thus it is spoken.
[14900] The second, extensive explanation, has twenty parts:
<list> [14901] Manner of wandering,
<list> [14902] Etymology,
<list> [14903] Aspects,
<list> [14904] Clairvoyance,
<list> [14905] Wonder,
<list> [14906] Lifespan,
<list> [14907] Color,
<list> [14908] Manner of head-gazing,
<list> [14909] The distinction of accumulating and not accumulating karma,
<list> [14910] Signs of karma,
<list> [14911] Enumerations of names,
<list> [14912] Measure of body,
<list> [14913] Recognizing birthplace,
<list> [14914] Distinction of conduct,
<list> [14915] Measure of light,
<list> [14916] Distinction of karmic connections,
<list> [14917] The connection of future body and afflictions,
<list> [14918] The distinction of which realm is entered,
<list> [14919] Signs of entering the future womb,
<list> [14920] Close indicating examples.
[14921] First, the distinction of wandering manner:
[14922] For those not seeing this door, or seeing yet not believing and not practicing, the dharmatā intermediate state is short,
[14923] Not knowing self-appearance, again and again wandering in the existence intermediate state,
[14924] Though flesh and blood own-form does not exist, through previous habituation to self-grasping of body, like a dream body, faculties complete and flesh form faultlessly seeming to exist, appearance arises—
<verse> [14925] The previous existence with flesh form,
<verse> [14926] Complete faculties possessing unobstructedness,
<verse> [14927] Seen by pure divine eye of similar class,
<verse> [14928] Irresistible—that is the scent-eater.
[14929] Thus labeled and explained.
[14930] If flesh form and faculties existed in their own characteristics, having taken the body, becoming actual, contradicts being intermediate state.
[14931] Therefore, separated from the aggregate body of the arising basis, the name of mind existence,
[14932] Relying on the seed-aspect of the four elements, near entering the body, possessing the second name of illusion body,
[14933] Not taking hold of the ground, karma moves everywhere and wanders.
[14934] Second, etymology:
[14935] Dharmatā appearance ceasing,
[14936] The appearance between not actually taking the body of the six classes—"intermediate" (bar) is thus expressed.
[14937] That is identified as the very center connecting those two.
[14938] Existence (srid pa): some as birth-existence emanating as emanation body,


### PAGE 358

[14939] Some as birth-existence as gods and humans,
[14940] Some as birth-existence in bad migrations,
[14941] Some as existence through liberation—
[14942] Thus called intermediate existence (bar srid).
[14943] Third, aspects:
[14944] As long as abiding in the intermediate, the upper half's aspect is the former,
[14945] From the lower half, the body, clothes, ornaments and so forth of where later born—thinking they exist, like dream aspects.
[14946] Moreover, taking god or human birth, that aspect;
[14947] If born in form, first existing as light body.
[14948] If born in formless, when rising, formless, aspects do not appear, yet
[14949] From space and mere wind appearance, birth occurs.
[14950] From formless transferring to lower realms, the upper half's meditation and mere wind, self-emanated meditation aspect, nothing else,
[14951] The lower half where born, aspects appear.
[14952] Demigods and
[14953] The three bad migrations, those aspects appear;
[14954] If born in unrelenting hell, through forceful entry, no intermediate state.
[14955] Likewise, upper forceful entry and
[14956] Phowa perfected, wherever forcefully entered, intermediate state does not appear.
[14957] Others make path in intermediate existence.
[14958] Fourth, clairvoyance:
[14959] Earlier dharmatā intermediate state's clairvoyance aspect, latency abiding here, through its power the former abiding world's container and contents' extent,
[14960] Height,
[14961] Measure,
[14962] Arising-ceasing and so forth,
[14963] The later birthplace's container and contents characteristics, all like mirror reflections arising in an instant, are known.
[14964] Thus, desiring and aspiring where born in the future, one is born.
[14965] Seeing god and human realms, through attachment, born there;
[14966] Demigods and
[14967] Animals' forests and lakes, seeing their beauty, born there;
[14968] Hell and preta realms too, seeing beautiful fire-light ray appearance and attachment, thinking to go there, one is born—
[14969] In brief, wherever born, seeing that realm as beautiful and delightful,


### PAGE 359

[14970] Fleeing enemies, seeing refuge there, mind grasping there for an instant, one takes birth.
[14971] Moreover, all birth through desire, desire-attachment's force arisen in mind, generates extra joy-sorrow toward objects.
[14972] If born in form, coarse appearance is aversion, light is joy-sorrow.
[14973] If born in formless, no appearance whatsoever has joy-sorrow, so merely abiding in empty mind, delight arises.
[14974] Container and contents appearance too, from mere instant,
[14975] Then through the power of thick latency, ceases.
[14976] Here, from what cause does clairvoyance arise?
[14977] Dharmatā seed existing, here the obstructing body does not exist,
[14978] And from the blessing of seeing dharmatā above, it arises.
[14979] Fifth, wonder:
[14980] Faculties clear and body complete appearance, like flying in dreams,
[14981] Going in space, mind enters wherever directed,
[14982] Small: entering keyholes and horse-hoof clefts,
[14983] Large: entering horses, oxen, mountains, rocks, and space,
[14984] Becoming sentient beings of undetermined size,
[14985] Unobstructedly going to earth, water, fire, wind, mountains, rocks and so forth,
[14986] Not harmed by four element damage,
[14987] Having power to enter any element,
[14988] Therefore the vital point of beings entering inside rocks and eggs.
[14989] At this time, unobstructed to all except vajra seat and mother's womb,
[14990] Similar class and divine eye possessing see it, others do not see,
[14991] By that all sentient beings' realm classes are seen afar.
[14992] This wonder's continuum arises from the aspect of seeing above Sambhogakāya's wonder,
[14993] That too arises merely for an instant, then again ceases and dissolves, other appearances arising.
[14994] When others arise, the former forgotten, not appearing, like not remembering previous and later dreams in that dream hole.
[14995] Sixth, lifespan:


### PAGE 360

[14996] These twenty aspects of arising appearance complete in seven days,
[14997] For that intermediate existence's life ends after seven days.
[14998] Is there no life beyond that?
[14999] Again, through latency's power, waking the above appearance,
[15000] Taking the mind body, dying seven times,
[15001] Seven times appearing to be born, like dream birth-death.
[15002] The seven births too are miraculous birth,
[15003] All death and birth done in an instant.
[15004] If virtue's power is applied, making seven of seven days' seven junctions is greatly beneficial.
[15005] Moreover, seven births appearing to abide, seven appearing to die, seven appearing to be born—twenty-one of one set
[15006] Is the utmost limit of taking body,
[15007] Seven groups of seven is forty-nine days,
[15008] Within that, through various karma, individual bodies are taken.
[15009] Generally, intermediate existence's short limit: seven days,
[15010] Long limit: forty-nine days,
[15011] Intermediate: between those.
[15012] If desired, like untimely death,
[15013] There too, untimely death through karma is possible, yet
[15014] Explained as possible to be longer than that, yet made under intermediate's power.
[15015] The cause of birth-death appearance:
[15016] From remembering previous death, above, whatever night-day portion died at that time, this too dies,
[15017] Remembering birth, in an instant, birth.
[15018] Seventh, color:
[15019] Appearing as signs of whichever body later born,
[15020] If born god or human: white,
[15021] If born demigod or animal: yellow,
[15022] If born preta: like smoke,
[15023] If born in hell: like black wool wavering.
[15024] This continuum arises from seeing above Sambhogakāya's color and hand symbols.
[15025] Eighth, distinction of head-gazing:
[15026] If born god or human: upward,
[15027] If born demigod or animal: sideways,
[15028] If born preta or hell: downward.
[15029] Ninth, accumulating and not accumulating:
[15030] Coarse manifest not accumulated,
[15031] Subtle latency relying on mind's power accumulated—


### PAGE 361

[15032] Called intermediate karma.
[15033] Moreover, through seeing dharmatā's truth, previous manifest karma does not appear, yet exists as seed.
[15034] Here, like dream's own time, accumulating subtle intermediate karma merely adding to future,
[15035] Future karma's connection too, this cause-result's fruit, one after another, making cyclic existence.
[15036] Manner of accumulation:
[15037] Special appearance one ceasing, one not yet born, accumulated at that time, through its power previous appearance not clear.
[15038] Time: between former and later cognition.
[15039] Cause: though previous manifest does not exist, from subtle latency and meditation aspect.
[15040] Here, accumulation arises from fear and alarm at dharmatā above.
[15041] Tenth, signs of karma:
[15042] Previous pure karma's seed-aspect appearance, at that time, by above dharmatā extremely clear and examined,
[15043] Previous impure seed makes cognition unclear and dull.
[15044] Cognition clear-unclear arises from previous virtue-nonvirtue's projection.
[15045] Cause: two—from pure subsequent memory, clear arises;
[15046] Unclear arises from turning back to dharmatā.
[15047] Former god-seeing aspect labeled as subsequent memory, not seeing characteristic subsequent memory, here is delusion.
[15048] Eleventh, name enumerations:
[15049] From four elements' seed aspect, four names gathered essence-possessing:
[15050] Earth element's action gathered, existence flesh form essence-possessing—one;
[15051] Water element's action seed becoming illusion-like body,
[15052] At this time, as food scent-eating, near circling above karma—two: existence intermediate, connecting five aggregates' links, scent-eater near circling—two.
[15053] Fire element's action seed: existence mind-only form,
[15054] Though flesh blood own does not exist, in seed aspect existing, ripening in that form, faculties and limbs complete, thinking—


### PAGE 362

[15055] Complete faculties possessing unobstructedness—three.
[15056] Wind element's action from seed, karma wind unobstructedly lifting, everywhere seeing-heart desiring and entering, unobstructed possessing, or
[15057] Entering existence—four.
[15058] From what cause do these arise?
[15059] From above four Jñanas' connection's potency.
[15060] Twelfth, body's measure:
[15061] Impure karma ones: child's eight years approximately;
[15062] Pure ones: sixteen years body's measure, like dream form, not existing in own characteristics.
[15063] Cause: arising from seeing above spontaneous presence's eight arising patterns.
[15064] Thirteenth, which birthplace is entered:
<list> [15065] Womb-born,
<list> [15066] Egg-born,
<list> [15067] Warmth-moisture born,
<list> [15068] Miraculous born—from four.
[15069] Belongs to miraculous birth.
[15070] Whatever dharma corresponding, having wonder and light, corresponding with gods.
[15071] Every seven days experiencing birth-death suffering, corresponding with hells—
<verse> [15072] Hells and gods and
<verse> [15073] Intermediate existence miraculous birth—
[15074] Thus it is spoken.
[15075] Cause: arising from seeing above emanation's aspects.
[15076] Fourteenth, conduct:
[15077] Dharmatā truth's power dissolved, previous attachment latency arisen, whatever done before, does here too.
[15078] Cause: arising from fear and alarm at self-appearance in dharmatā's time above.
[15079] Fifteenth, light:
[15080] Pure karma born in higher realms: white, one league clear;
[15081] Impure born in bad migrations: yellow and black, merely self-luminous murky.
[15082] Their cause: arising from dharmatā's own light.
[15083] Sixteenth, karmic connections:
[15084] If born in future good migration with Dharma, here meeting virtuous aspects;
[15085] If future wealth,
[15086] Retinue, and enjoyment possessing, self-pleasing aspects appearing, meeting those.
[15087] If future incomplete faculties, evil, or


### PAGE 363

[15088] Bad migrations and so forth born,
[15089] Displeasing,
[15090] Poverty and so forth aspects appearing.
[15091] Cause: arising from grasping as attachment or aversion to dharmatā.
[15092] Seventeenth, body and afflictions connection:
[15093] Though form own does not exist, in dream-like space, grasping self-form, desire arises;
[15094] Aversion arises as form;
[15095] Intermediate arises as formless.
[15096] Their cause: arising from deviation from dharmatā truth.
[15097] Eighteenth, which realm is entered:
<list> [15098] Desire,
<list> [15099] Form,
<list> [15100] Formless—from three.
[15101] Though four name aggregates' illusion mind body seems to exist,
[15102] Future aggregates not taken, form own does not exist, therefore
[15103] Other than form: feeling,
[15104] Perception,
[15105] Formation,
[15106] Consciousness latency aggregates abiding, belong to formless realm.
[15107] Formless cause: from what arising? From seeing above dharmatā like illusion.
[15108] Nineteenth, signs of entering future womb:
[15109] From one or two sets of seven, experiencing existence, certain karma completed, first entering individual future existence's time,
[15110] If entering god's birthplace, at that time, cognition appearance abiding on top of a divine mansion or inside piled jewel houses.
[15111] If entering demigod's womb,
[15112] Abiding inside a fire-wheel's circle,
[15113] Or in the center of falling rain, such thought arises.
[15114] If entering human womb: very cold—thinking that, mere human body;
[15115] Abiding in dense fog—thinking that, pure human body;
[15116] Abiding in crowds' noise midst—thinking that, precious human body signs.
[15117] If entering animal's womb: inside head or cave or swamp, abiding—such thought.
[15118] If entering preta's womb: inside a hole or dung worm—thinking that.
[15119] Hell beings are abiding in the intermediate existence through succession from direct existence.
[15120] These having arisen, entered the womb,


### PAGE 364

[15121] Though desiring to go, with obstruction, powerless.
[15122] Cause: from not trusting above dharmatā truth.
[15123] Twentieth, examples:
[15124] Like grass holding fire, through karma and latency's power holding womb abode, and
[15125] Like mud holding beings, jewels, trees and so forth, holding one's own awareness Jñana in cyclic existence, and
[15126] Like bird eating bird, between parents' union, intermediate existence sentient beings holding—
<verse> [15127] Like bees gathering on summer's rotting flesh,
<verse> [15128] Countless intermediates swarm at parents' union's womb door,
<verse> [15129] Mere experience of parents' bliss, those with karma to be born there, powerlessly enter the womb's swelling—mother's birth canal.
<tantra> [15130] From the Sun Moon Union:
<verse> [15131] This itself, those without scripture,
<verse> [15132] Sentient beings' entering
<verse> [15133] The existence intermediate state—
<verse> [15134] Cyclic existence realm's path head,
<verse> [15135] Like water-mill wheel turning,
<verse> [15136] Separated from flesh blood own body,
<verse> [15137] Illusion mind form possessing.
<verse> [15138] Second name separated from aggregates.
<verse> [15139] Previous cognition's appearance ceased,
<verse> [15140] Future itself not yet arisen,
<verse> [15141] Which class uncertain,
<verse> [15142] Whatever ceases, whatever appears at that time,
<verse> [15143] Instant-abiding intermediate state.
<verse> [15144] Later, whichever birthplace's aspect held,
<verse> [15145] Future aspects fully held,
<verse> [15146] Six classes' individual appearance rain.
<verse> [15147] Desire realm's container common and
<verse> [15148] Contents self-known and clear.
<verse> [15149] Self itself, whichever birthplace's container and contents,
<verse> [15150] At that very time, clear.
<verse> [15151] Desire-possessing container and contents clearly appearing,
<verse> [15152] Faculties and limbs complete,
<verse> [15153] Unobstructed to all things,
<verse> [15154] Mountains, rocks and so forth unobstructed entry.
<verse> [15155] From others, lifespan becomes seven days,
<verse> [15156] Seven sets of seven days—
<verse> [15157] That life's measure.


### PAGE 365

<verse> [15158] Gods and humans: white color,
<verse> [15159] Demigods and animals: yellow,
<verse> [15160] Pretas: light like smoke,
<verse> [15161] Hells: like tree stump,
<verse> [15162] Or like wavering black wool,
<verse> [15163] Animals: like blood smeared,
<verse> [15164] Demigods: like falling rain.
<verse> [15165] Then head thus:
<verse> [15166] Gods and humans gaze upward,
<verse> [15167] Demigods and animals gaze sideways,
<verse> [15168] Pretas and hells gaze downward.
<verse> [15169] These are birth's power just now,
<verse> [15170] Existence intermediate state's karmas:
<verse> [15171] Accumulating and not accumulating—these signs.
<verse> [15172] Maturation latency does not exist,
<verse> [15173] Intermediate's power cause-result
<verse> [15174] Latencies are accumulated by this.
<verse> [15175] Then cognition's signs:
<verse> [15176] Whichever karma is pure,
<verse> [15177] That cognition itself is clear.
<verse> [15178] Likewise impure, unclear.
<verse> [15179] All from virtue-evil karma arisen.
<verse> [15180] That itself, name enumerations:
<verse> [15181] These all should be known.
<verse> [15182] Four names gathered essence-possessing,
<verse> [15183] Existence's flesh form and
<verse> [15184] Illusion body scent-eater near circling,
<verse> [15185] Existence intermediate aggregate links connecting,
<verse> [15186] Formless faculties complete possessing,
<verse> [15187] Unobstructed entering all.
<verse> [15188] Thus intermediate body's measure:
<verse> [15189] Child eight years or
<verse> [15190] Ten years' body measure,
<verse> [15191] Dream-like form abiding.
<verse> [15192] Birthplace itself from four:
<verse> [15193] Miraculous birth indeed—
<verse> [15194] Gods and hells intermediate state,
<verse> [15195] All these from miraculous birth.
<verse> [15196] Conduct itself thus:
<verse> [15197] Previous attachment karma enjoying,
<verse> [15198] Following that, entering,
<verse> [15199] That conduct mind's subsequent holding.
<verse> [15200] That itself, light measures:
<verse> [15201] Previous attachment latency coarse arisen,
<verse> [15202] This light one league,
<verse> [15203] White color luminous.
<verse> [15204] This is god-human's birthplace.
<verse> [15205] To latency-possessing, clear not appearing.
<verse> [15206] Whichever karma good-evil by,
<verse> [15207] Good virtue pleasing meeting.
<verse> [15208] Evil sentient beings latency-possessing,
<verse> [15209] Displeasing, entering womb.
<verse> [15210] Future body's connection:
<verse> [15211] Self-momentum aversion arisen cause,
<verse> [15212] Likewise desire condition by,
<verse> [15213] Future appearance manner.
<verse> [15214] Realms from three aspects:
<verse> [15215] Four name aggregates not ceased,
<verse> [15216] Future not taken, not existent,
<verse> [15217] From four name aggregates' gathered aggregate,
<verse> [15218] Flesh blood form not appearing,
<verse> [15219] Formless realm.
<verse> [15220] Future body near time:
<verse> [15221] Fire-wheel or rain,
<verse> [15222] Likewise cold dense fog,
<verse> [15223] Crowds gathered noise,
<verse> [15224] Divine mansion or top,
<verse> [15225] Houses piled seeing.
<verse> [15226] Bad migrations: caves or
<verse> [15227] Holes dung worms empty seeing.
<verse> [15228] These are womb-entering signs.
<verse> [15229] Though desiring to go, swollen,
<verse> [15230] With obstruction indeed.
<verse> [15231] Like grass holding fire,
<verse> [15232] Likewise mud holding essence,
<verse> [15233] Ḍākinī desire power by,
<verse> [15234] Like digging earth hole's after-holding,
<verse> [15235] Powerless attachment after-holding.
[15236] Thus it is spoken.
[15237] Thus from the existence intermediate state making path,

[15238] Through karma's power:
<list> [15239] Joyous,
<list> [15240] Contention-possessing,
<list> [15241] Equal-possessing,
<list> [15242] Two-possessing,
<list> [15243] Hunger-possessing,
<list> [15244] Great suffering-possessing realms,
[15245] Like a water-mill wheel, going from one to one, called the six classes of beings.
<tantra> [15246] From the Self-Arisen:
<verse> [15247] Discursive thought is cyclic existence indeed,
<verse> [15248] Great crying-out realm and
<verse> [15249] Great hunger-possessing realms and
<verse> [15250] Dull intoxicated great realm and
<verse> [15251] Very coarse realm and
<verse> [15252] Likewise equal-possessing great realm and
<verse> [15253] Explained as extremely joyous realm.
<verse> [15254] Unrealized sentient beings,
<verse> [15255] From that, no going beyond.
[15256] Thus it is spoken.
[15257] <tantra> [CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle]
[15258] From the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle,
[15259] The manner of self-appearance intermediate state display explained—the twenty-third chapter.
[15260] Thus extensively explaining instructions for liberation in the intermediate state for the diligent and middling faculties,
[15261] Now explaining the dharmic enumeration for giving breath to natural emanation for the last faculties:
[15262] For this, those seeing the door among the last of the last faculties too, from two classes:
[15263] Extreme: seeing the door directly yet not believing, not practicing,
[15264] Believing yet not practicing even an instant, distracted by this life, are explained in the Copper Letters as transferring to other existence.
[15265] Seeing the door, believing, practicing, yet
[15266] Appearance not greatly increasing,
[15267] Realization not meeting primordial purity's intention of exhausted dharmas, realization not arisen in continuum,
[15268] Yet through practice, non-virtue's entry is restrained,
[15269] Persons of fortune becoming good in dream, from dharmatā truth's blessing, born as natural emanation.
<tantra> [15270] From the Great Self-Arisen Awareness Tantra:
<verse> [15271] Sentient beings seeing truth,
<verse> [15272] Though realization not arisen in continuum,
<verse> [15273] In the ten directions' emanation realms,
<verse> [15274] Abiding, finally, become liberated.
[15274] Thus it is explained.
