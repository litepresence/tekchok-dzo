[14823] First, regarding self-appearance gradually arising: seven moments.
[14824] Self-appearance having arisen, abiding in that nature, thinking "What is its own condition?"—seven.
[14825] That, knowing as self-appearance, gradually obtaining certainty—seven.
[14826] At twenty-one, liberating in primordial purity.
[14827] During the interval of not dissolving, projecting emanation,
[14828] Dissolves into primordial purity.
[14829] Though the twenty-one instants are equal, meditation days vary according to sharp or dull faculties.
[14830] Joining those days with instants,
[14831] Faculty appearance manner and days' enumeration,
[14832] And emanation's different manner of projection—these are different.
[14833] From self-arising:
[14834] Some liberate through white color,
[14835] Some liberate through yellow color,
[14836] Some liberate through red color,
[14837] Some liberate through green color,
[14838] Some liberate through blue color,
[14839] Some liberate through all five colors,
[14840] Some liberate through bindu-rays.
[14841] That is the final manner of liberation.
[14842] Thus it is spoken.
[14843] The liberation manner of final faculties is thus:
[14844] That also, completing the final ground takes fourteen days.
[14845] That also, six for the gathering above-below,
[14846] Five for wisdom,
[14847] Three for spontaneous presence—the final seeing self-appearance, becoming Buddha.
[14848] Emanation also, at forty days, able to accomplish benefit.
[14849] The final summit:
[14850] Takes fifteen days,
[14851] Also gathering and wisdom as before.
[14852] Spontaneous presence abiding one day, final also seeing self-appearance, obtaining stability.
[14853] Emanation also, at forty-three days, able to accomplish benefit.
[14854] The final supreme:
[14855] Takes sixteen days,
[14856] Gathering and wisdom as before.
[14857] Spontaneous presence abiding five days, final also seeing self-appearance, obtaining stability.
[14858] Emanation also, at forty-six days, able to accomplish benefit.
[14859] The final best:
[14860] Takes seventeen days,
[14861] Gathering and wisdom as before.
[14862] Spontaneous presence abiding six days, final also seeing self-appearance, obtaining stability.
[14863] Emanation also, at forty-seven days, able to accomplish benefit.
[14864] The final excellent:
[14865] Takes eighteen days,
[14866] Also six for the gathering,
[14867] Eight for wisdom.
[14868] Spontaneous presence abiding three days, final seeing self-appearance, obtaining stability.
[14869] Emanation also, at fifty days, able to accomplish benefit.
[14870] The final intermediate:
[14871] Takes nineteen days,
[14872] Also twelve for the gathering,
[14873] Four for wisdom.
[14874] Those faculties of beings all attain the ground of Buddha.
[14875] Those bardos also are like dreams, thus it is said.
[14876] The final of final, arising as natural emanation, here explained within the scope of liberation.
[14877] These are the liberation manners of faculties—the great crucial point, thus one should know.
[14878] Fourth, the general meaning: existence bardo where karmic force connects, severing the hollow like inserting a fox—pith instructions have two aspects:
[14879] Briefly showing the manner of pointing out instructions, and extensively explaining the bardo's own nature.
[14880] First:
[14881] Existence bardo, like dream appearance, momentarily engages objects without obstruction, previous moments self-ceasing and dissolving, not apprehending.
[14882] Now, direct appearance clear, consciousness wandering freely, miraculous power to traverse in an instant to wherever contemplated—at that time,
[14883] Those with this door of vision, recognizing bardo's self-appearance, contemplate pure lands of emanation in the ten directions; through Dharmatā truth's blessings, born there, without bardo, become Buddha.
[14884] For this also, previous instructions are:
[14885] Now, awareness from the eyes or Brahma-aperture, observing light-mass shooting like a meteor.
[14886] Instructions for that time: remembering that pure land, projecting awareness spontaneously in directions such as east.
[14887] Those ordinary beings without this door of vision, trained in Dharma, holding illusion-body,
[14888] Training in non-existence,
[14889] Contemplating pure lands, liberating—explained as possible, as found in individual practice texts.
[14890] Those without Dharma familiarity, aspiring to pure lands,
[14891] Taking refuge,
[14892] Rejecting bad womb-entrances,
[14893] Selecting good ones.
[14894] From the Golden Rosary:
[14895] Delusion merely the aspect of existence,
[14896] Self-appearance naturally without appearance,
[14897] Knowing self-appearance naturally without essence,
[14898] Emanation recollection liberates one's own continuum.
[14899] Thus it is.
[14900] Second, extensive explanation has twenty aspects:
[14901] Circling manner,
[14902] Definitive terminology,
[14903] Characteristics,
[14904] Clairvoyance,
[14905] Miraculous powers,
[14906] Life span,
[14907] Color,
[14908] Head-direction manner,
[14909] Difference of accumulating or not accumulating karma,
[14910] Karmic signs,
[14911] Names' enumeration,
[14912] Body size,
[14913] Recognizing birthplace,
[14914] Behavior differences,
[14915] Light extent,
[14916] Karmic connection differences,
[14917] Connection with future body and afflictions,
[14918] Difference of which realm one belongs to,
[14919] Signs of entering future womb,
[14920] Illustrative examples.
[14921] First, difference of circling manner:
[14922] For those without this door of vision, or having seen but not believing and not practicing, Dharmatā bardo is short in duration.
[14923] Not recognizing self-appearance, existence bardo circles again and again.
[14924] Though without flesh-blood self-body, habitual tendencies of body-self-grasping from before cause appearance like dream-body, with complete faculties, flesh-form flawless like existing.
[14925] Previous existence flesh-form possessor,
[14926] Complete faculties, unobstructed possession,
[14927] Seen by similar kind with pure divine eye,
[14928] Unreturning, that is a gandharva.
[14929] Thus nominally explained.
[14930] If flesh-form and faculties exist as own-characteristics, having taken body actually becomes, contradicting being bardo.
[14931] Therefore, separated from coarse arisen-base body, named mind-existence,
[14932] Depending on seed-aspect of four elements, entering body is near, named second illusion-body.
[14933] Not completing ground, moved by karma, circling.
[14934] Second, definitive terminology:
[14935] Dharmatā appearance ceasing,
[14936] Not actually taking six-realm body, the appearance in between is called "bardo."
[14937] That is recognized as the middle of those two conjoined.
[14938] Existence: some emanation-body birth-existence,
[14939] Some god-human birth-existence,
[14940] Some lower realm birth-existence,
[14941] Some liberation-existence, thus called.
[14942] Called "intermediate existence."
[14943] Third, characteristics:
[14944] However long bardo abides, the upper half as previous form,
[14945] Lower half as body, clothes, ornaments, etc. of wherever one will be born,
[14946] Like dream characteristics.
[14947] Also, if taking god-human birth, that form;
[14948] If born in form realm, first exists as light-body.
[14949] Formless upward birth, formless thus form doesn't appear, but
[14950] Born from space and mere wind appearance.
[14951] Formless transferring to lower realms, upper half absorption and mere wind self-emanation absorption form, nothing else.
[14952] Lower half appears as form of wherever born.
[14953] Asuras,
[14954] Three lower realms appear as that form.
[14955] Born in Avici, precipitated thus no bardo.
[14956] Likewise precipitated upward,
[14957] Transferring accomplished, wherever precipitated, bardo not seen.
[14958] Others make bardo the path.
[14959] Fourth, clairvoyance:
[14960] Previous Dharmatā bardo clairvoyance aspect, latency here present, through its power, previous world's container-contained extent, height, measure, formation-destruction, etc.
[14961] And future birthplace container-contained characteristics, all known in an instant like mirror-reflection appearing.
[14962] Thus, whichever future place born, desiring and aspiring, born there.
[14963] Seeing god-human realms, attached, born there.
[14964] Asuras,
[14965] Animals' forests and pleasant lake-islands, seeing, born there.
[14966] Hungry ghosts' realms, seeing light-radiant fire-appearance beautiful and attractive, proceeding thus, born there.
[14967] In brief, wherever born, appearing beautiful and delightful,
[14968] Enemy pursuing, seen as refuge, mind briefly attached, hiding there, takes birth.
[14969] Also, all desire-realm birth, desire-attachment potency arising, object joy-longing greatly increases.
[14970] Born in form, coarse appearance anger, light joy-longing arises.
[14971] Born formless, no appearance joy-longing, thus nothing-at-all mind abiding only, joy arises.
[14972] Container-contained appearance also, merely an instant,
[14973] Then through great habitual tendency power, ceases.
[14974] Here, what is the cause of clairvoyance appearing?
[14975] Dharmatā seed present, here obstructing body self not present,
[14976] And Dharmatā previous seeing blessing arising.
[14977] Fifth, miraculous powers:
[14978] Faculties clear, body complete appearance, like flying in dreams, etc.,
[14979] Traversing space, consciousness entering wherever directed,
[14980] Small entering eye of needle, horse ear cavity,
[14981] Large entering horse-elephant, mountain-rock, and space,
[14982] Thus becomes indeterminate size being.
[14983] Earth-water-fire-wind mountain-rock etc., all passing through without obstruction,
[14984] Four elements' harm cannot affect,
[14985] Power to enter whatever element exists,
[14986] Beings entering inside rocks, etc., and inside eggs—the crucial point.
[14987] At this time, except Vajra-seat and mother's womb, no obstruction anywhere.
[14988] Except similar kind and divine-eye possessor, not seen by them,
[14989] But they see all beings' realm-locations.
[14990] This miraculous power continuum arises from previous Sambhogakāya miraculous power seeing aspect.
[14991] That also, arising merely an instant, then ceasing and dissolving, other appearance arising.
[14992] Other arising, previous forgotten, not seen, like dream before-after not remembered in dream-state.
[14993] Sixth, life span:
[14994] These twenty appearance-birth aspects complete in seven days,
[14995] Bardo that life, seven days passed thus exhausting.
[14996] No life beyond that?
[14997] Again through habitual tendency power, previous appearance waking,
[14998] Taking mind-body, dying seven times,
[14999] Seven times appearing to be born, like dream birth-death.
[15000] Seven births also miraculous birth,
[15001] All death and birth done in an instant.
[15002] If applying virtuous power, seven sevens making seven periods greatly benefits.
[15003] Also, seven births abiding, seven death-appearances, seven birth-appearances—twenty-one,
[15004] One cycle is body's taking extreme duration.
[15005] Seven groups of seven making forty-nine days,
[15006] Within that, different karma, taking separate bodies.
[15007] Generally, bardo life's minimum seven days,
[15008] Maximum forty-nine days,
[15009] Intermediate in between.
[15010] Also, like untimely death in desire realm,
[15011] There also untimely karma-death possible,
[15012] Karma exhausted longer also explained, but posited by intermediate's power.
[15013] Appearance of death-birth cause:
[15014] From previous death memory, at time of day-night portion previously died, this also dies.
[15015] Birth memory, instantly born.
[15016] Seventh, color:
[15017] As sign of future body to be born:
[15018] God-human birth, white;
[15019] Asura and animal birth, yellow;
[15020] Hungry ghost birth, smoke-like;
[15021] Hell birth, tangled black wool-like.
[15022] This continuum arises from previous Sambhogakāya color and hand-emblems seeing.
[15023] Eighth, head-direction difference:
[15024] God-human birth, upward;
[15025] Asura animal, horizontal;
[15026] Hungry ghost hell, downward.
[15027] Ninth, accumulating or not accumulating karma:
[15028] Coarse manifest not accumulating,
[15029] Subtle latency depending on mind-power accumulating,
[15030] Called intermediate karma.
[15031] Also, Dharmatā truth seeing, previous manifest karma not seen, exists as seed.
[15032] Here like dream own-time, intermediate subtle future merely adding accumulating,
[15033] Future karmic connection also, this's ripened-result cause-fruit one to one continuing, making samsara.
[15034] Accumulating manner:
[15035] One appearance ceasing, one not yet born, accumulating in between, through its power previous appearance unclear.
[15036] Time is between previous and later consciousness.
[15037] Cause is previous manifest not present but subtle latency and meditation aspect.
[15038] Here accumulating arises from previous Dharmatā obscuration and fear.
[15039] Tenth, karmic signs:
[15040] Previous karma pure, seed-aspect appearance, at that time greatly clarified and examined by Dharmatā.
[15041] Previous impure seed, consciousness unclear and dull.
[15042] Consciousness clear-unclear arises from previous virtue-nonvirtue propulsion.
[15043] Cause of two: clear cause from previous subsequent memory pure arising,
[15044] Unclear from turning back to Dharmatā arising.
[15045] Previously divine seeing aspect nominally subsequent memory, not actual subsequent memory characteristics seeing, here delusion.
[15046] Eleventh, names' enumeration:
[15047] Four elements seed-aspect four names gathered nature:
[15048] Earth element function gathered existence flesh-form nature, one.
[15049] Water element function seed illusion-like body arising, thus
[15050] At this time food-eating gandharva and near-circling upper karma, two.
[15051] Existence bardo five aggregates link gandharva near-circling, two.
[15052] Fire element function seed, existence mind-form only,
[15053] Flesh-blood self not present but seed-aspect exists, ripening to that form, complete faculties and limbs thinking,
[15054] Complete faculties unobstructed possession, three.
[15055] Wind element function seed, karmic wind lifting without obstruction, seeing all with desire to enter,
[15056] Unobstructed possession or existence-entering, called existence-entering, four.
[15057] These from what cause arising?
[15058] From previous four wisdoms preparation potency arising.
[15059] Twelfth, body size:
[15060] Impure karma ones, about eight-year-old child size;
[15061] Pure ones, sixteen-year-old body size, like dream-form not own-characteristic.
[15062] Cause arises from previous spontaneous presence eight manner seeing.
[15063] Thirteenth, which birthplace one belongs to:
[15064] Womb-born,
[15065] Egg-born,
[15066] Warmth-moisture born,
[15067] Miraculous birth—of four,
[15068] Belongs to miraculous birth.
[15069] Whatever Dharma accorded, miraculous power and light present, thus god-accorded.
[15070] Seven sevens birth-death suffering engaging, thus hell-accorded.
[15071] Hell beings and god beings,
[15072] Existence bardo miraculously born.
[15073] Thus by this.
[15074] Cause arises from previous emanation form seeing.
[15075] Fourteenth, behavior:
[15076] Dharmatā truth power dissolving, previous attachment habitual tendency arising, previous whatever done, here also doing.
[15077] Cause arises from previous Dharmatā time self-appearance obscuration and fear.
[15078] Fifteenth, light:
[15079] Pure karma higher birth, one league clear white light;
[15080] Impure lower realm birth, yellow and black murky merely self-clarity.
[15081] Their cause arises from Dharmatā's own light.
[15082] Sixteenth, karmic connection:
[15083] Future good birth Dharma-possessed, here meeting virtuous form.
[15084] Future wealth,
[15085] Retinue and enjoyments possessed, meeting pleasant forms pleasing to mind.
[15086] Future faculties incomplete, evil-possessed,
[15087] Lower realms, etc., born,
[15088] Meeting unpleasant,
[15089] Poverty, etc., forms thinking.
[15090] Cause arises from grasping Dharmatā as attachment or aversion.
[15091] Seventeenth, body and afflictions connection:
[15092] Form self not present but like dream-state, self-form attachment arising, desire;
[15093] Aversion arising, form;
[15094] Indifference arising, formless birth.
[15095] Their cause arises from deviating from Dharmatā truth.
[15096] Eighteenth, which realm one belongs to:
[15097] Desire,
[15098] Form,
[15099] Formless—of three,
[15000] Four names' aggregates illusion mind-body thinking, but
[15001] Future aggregates not taken, thus form self not present,
[15002] Other than form, feeling,
[15003] Perception,
[15004] Formations,
[15005] Consciousness latency aggregates abiding, thus belongs to formless realm.
[15006] Formless from what cause arising? Previous Dharmatā illusion-like seeing arising.
[15007] Nineteenth, signs of entering future womb:
[15008] One or two seven-periods from seven, intermediate experience certain karma completed, entering respective future existence, first entering time:
[15009] Divine birthplace entering, at this time consciousness-appearance divine palace upper story or jewel-storied house inside abiding thinking.
[15010] Asura womb entering,
[15011] Inside fire-brand wheel abiding, or
[15012] Inside rain-falling center abiding, comes.
[15013] Human womb entering, extremely cold thinking, merely human body;
[15014] Dark mist center abiding thinking, pure human body;
[15015] People gathered noise midst abiding thinking, jewel human body.
[15016] Animal womb entering, head inside or cave or bush inside abiding thinking.
[15017] Hungry ghost womb entering, rotten tree hollow inside abiding thinking.
[15018] Hell, directly existence bardo abiding without intermediate.
[15019] These having arisen, having entered womb,
[15020] Though wishing to go, obstructed, without power.
[15021] Cause from previous not believing Dharmatā truth.
[15022] Twentieth, examples:
[15023] Like grass holding fire, karma and habitual tendency power holding womb-abiding;
[15024] Like mud holding being or jewel or tree, etc., samsara holding self-awareness wisdom;
[15025] Like bird holding bird, parents' union dregs intermediate being holding:
[15026] Like summer rotten meat bees gathering,
[15027] Parents' union womb-door countless intermediate beings gathered,
[15028] Merely experiencing parents' bliss-essence, there birth-karma-possessed, without power, womb swells filling, entering mother's excretion-path.
[15029] From these sun-mouth joining,
[15030] This itself scripture not concordant,
[15031] Beings' entering
[15032] Existence bardo called
[15033] Samsara abode path-head,
[15034] Like irrigated water circling,
[15035] Separated from flesh-blood self-body,
[15036] Illusion mind-form possessor.
[15037] Separated from coarse second name.
[15038] Previous consciousness-appearance ceased,
[15039] Future itself not yet arisen,
[15040] Type not determined anywhere,
[15041] Whatever dissolves, whatever appears, at that time,
[15042] Instantaneously abiding bardo,
[15043] Future whichever body-form holding,
[15044] Future arising form fully grasped,
[15045] Six-realm respective appearance-aspects become.
[15046] Desire realm container general and
[15047] Contained self-knowing and clear.
[15048] Self whichever birthplace container-contained,
[15049] That itself at time clear.
[15050] Desire-possessed container-contained clear appearance.
[15051] Faculties limbs fully complete,
[15052] All things unobstructed,
[15053] Mountain-rock, etc., unobstructed entering.
[15054] Others' life becomes seven days.
[15055] Days seven periods of seven,
[15056] That life's measure is thus.
[15057] Gods and humans white color,
[15058] Asuras and animals yellow,
[15059] Hungry ghosts light smoke-like,
[15060] Hell tree-trunk-like, or
[15061] Also tangled black wool-like.
[15062] Animals also blood-clot-like,
[15063] Asuras mouth-rain-falling-like.
[15064] At that time head thus:
[15065] Gods and humans upward-looking,
[15066] Asuras animals likewise horizontal,
[15067] Hungry ghosts hell downward-looking.
[15068] These newly birth-power.
[15069] Existence bardo karmas,
[15070] Accumulating and not accumulating signs these.
[15071] Ripened habitual tendencies not present,
[15072] Intermediate power cause-corresponding
[15073] Habitual tendencies these accumulate.
[15074] At that time consciousness signs these.
[15075] Whatever karma pure,
[15076] Consciousness itself clear,
[15077] Likewise impure ones unclear,
[15078] All these virtue-nonvirtue karma arising.
[15079] That itself names' enumeration,
[15080] These all should be known.
[15081] Four names gathered nature,
[15082] Existence flesh-form and
[15083] Illusion-body gandharva near-circling,
[15084] Existence bardo aggregates link.
[15085] Formless all faculties possessed,
[15086] Unobstructedly entering all.
[15087] Thus intermediate body size,
[15088] Child eight years old, or
[15089] Sixteen years old body size,
[15090] Like dream-form abiding.
[15091] Birthplace itself of four kinds,
[15092] Miraculous birth itself,
[15093] Gods and hells bardo,
[15094] All these miraculously born.
[15095] Behavior itself thus:
[15096] Previous attachment karma engaging,
[15097] Following that,
[15098] Doing that mind's subsequent grasping.
[15099] That itself light measures,
[15000] Previous attachment habitual tendency coarse arising,
[15001] This light one league,
[15002] Color white brilliant,
[15003] This is god-human birthplace.
[15004] Habitual tendency-possessed unclear not seen.
[15005] Whichever karma good-evil,
[15006] Good virtue and pleasant meeting.
[15007] Evil beings habitual tendency-possessed,
[15008] Unpleasant womb entering.
[15009] Future body connection,
[15010] Spontaneous anger arising cause,
[15011] Likewise desire attachment condition,
[15012] Future appearance manner.
[15013] Realm of three kinds,
[15014] Four names' aggregates not ceased,
[15015] Future not taken, not possible.
[15016] Four names' gathered aggregate from
[15017] Flesh-blood form not seen,
[15018] Formless realm thus.
[15019] Future body near time,
[15020] Fire-brand or rain, or
[15021] Likewise cold and dark mist,
[15022] People gathered noise, and
[15023] Divine palace or upper story, or
[15024] Storied houses seen.
[15025] Lower realms cave, or
[15026] Hollow rotten empty tree seen.
[15027] These womb-entering signs.
[15028] Though wishing to go, swells filling,
[15029] With obstruction.
[15030] Like grass holding fire,
[15031] Likewise mud holding substance,
[15032] Sky-goer desire-power,
[15033] Earth-cavity dug dregs holding-like,
[15034] Without power attachment dregs holding.
[15035] Thus.
[15036] Thus existence bardo traversing path,
[15037] Through karma-power,
[15038] Joy-possessed,
[15039] Strife-possessed,
[15040] Equanimity-possessed,
[15041] Two-possessed,
[15042] Hunger-possessed,
[15043] Great suffering-possessed abodes,
[15044] Like irrigated water-wheel, one to one going, called six-realm beings.
[15045] From self-arising:
[15046] Conceptualization samsara only,
[15047] Great wailing abode and
[15048] Extreme hunger abodes,
[15049] Dull and intoxicated great abode,
[15050] Very coarse abode, and
[15051] Likewise equanimity great abode,
[15052] Extreme joy abode explained.
[15053] Unrealized beings,
[15054] From there no going-place.
[15055] Thus.
[15056] From Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury,
[15057] Self-appearance bardo aspects shown, chapter twenty-three.
[15058] Thus extensively showing instructions for liberation in bardo for diligent and intermediate faculties,
[15059] Now explaining Dharma enumerations for final faculties natural emanation exhalation.
[15060] For this, those with door of vision final of final faculties have two types:
[15061] Extreme: seen directly with door of vision but not believing, not practicing;
[15062] Though believing and practicing, life distracted without even an instant,
[15063] Copper-letter explained transferring to other existence.
[15064] Door of vision seen, believing, practicing, but
[15065] Appearance not greatly increasing,
