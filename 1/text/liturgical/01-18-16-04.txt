[5928] Asuras,
[5929] Garuḍas,
[5930] Gandharvas,
[5931] Nāgas, and countless others,
[5932] Teaches inconceivable sūtras and tantras,
[5933] For time spanning eons immeasurable to a hundred.
[5934] These are called the perfection of abode, occasion, and time,
[5935] From the Thalgyur:
[5936] The bases are of five types,
[5937] The abodes are held to be of three types.
[5938] This is the meaning.
[5939] Also from the Ratnaketu:
[5940] Dharmakāya, self-pure grasping,
[5941] Within the self-pure elaborationless celestial palace,
[5942] To the retinue of appearances inseparable from itself,
[5943] By means of signless speech,
[5944] Elaborationless dharmas,
[5945] Arise from mind as non-abiding, self-exhausted.
[5946] Without spoken, without speech,
[5947] Shown in the state of great equality.
[5948] By Saṃbhogakāya, self-clear and pure,
[5949] From the pure celestial palace of five lights,
[5950] By means of elaborationless great bliss speech,
[5951] To the retinue of the five kāyas and families,
[5952] Entityless, pure dharmas
[5953] Arise from mind as Five Wisdoms gathered.
[5954] From the tongue spreading pure light-rays,
[5955] The six self-arisen letters also,
[5956] Great self-arisen shown without speaking.
[5957] By Nirmāṇakāya without attachment,
[5958] Dharma also from the disciple's own abode,
[5959] To the fortunate awakened from the six families,
[5960] By means of speech with words and elaborations,
[5961] Whatever dharmas faculties desire,
[5962] From mind, self-clear mindfulness,
