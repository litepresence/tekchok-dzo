[16533] Saṃbhoga-kāya extensively explained also comprises
[16534] Essence,
[16535] Definitive terminology,
[16536] Divisions,
[16537] And enumerations—four aspects.

[16538] Essence's defining characteristic: completely perfect in great self-clarity,
[16539] Essence's abiding manner: unchanging in nature, kāya of marks and signs, families clearly manifest yet unmoving.

[16540] Saṃbhoga-kāya's definitive terminology: engaging in appearance as saṃbhoga-kāya, in that itself wisdom unceasingly engaging.
[16541] Kāya: great self-clear display-arrangement.

[16542] Saṃbhoga-kāya's divisions are four:
<list> [16543] Great element essence-kāya;
<list> [16544] All-pervading abiding manner kāya;
<list> [16545] Appearance path kāya;
<list> [16546] Those to be trained's appearance manner kāya.

[16547] The first:
[16548] Self-arisen from Dharma-kāya's manifestation-basis, perfected as the fivefold luminosity-kāya:
[16549] Appearance-basis great elements' nature: clear warmth,
[16550] Coolness,
[16551] Spaciousness,
[16552] Possessing all-pervading identity.

[16553] The second:
[16554] For all Buddhas and sentient beings, the aspect of pervasion by light and light-house directly manifest.

<tantra> [16555] From Self-Arisen:
<tantra> [16556] "Abiding as light's heart-essence for all,
<tantra> [16557] Thought-free completely pure Dharmadhātu,
<tantra> [16558] The single without rival,
<tantra> [16559] Maṇḍala, retinue, palace,
<tantra> [16560] And awareness, emptiness, and clarity."
<tantra> [16561] Thus it is spoken.

[16562] The third:
[16563] The saṃbhoga-kāya of appearance-basis Dharmatā, appearing to sentient beings in the bardo as path, here guiding those to be trained—self-arisen from Dharma-kāya's inner Expanse,
[16564] Within the expanse of light and color,
[16565] Maṇḍala,
[16566] Retinue,
[16567] Individual assemblies,
[16568] Kāya,
[16569] Wisdom,
[16570] Father,
[16571] Mother,
[16572] Kāya-colors,
[16573] Hand-symbols, and so forth clearly manifest.

<tantra> [16574] From secret seed-cause,
<tantra> [16575] To nature-appearance,
<tantra> [16576] Nature-kāya manifests;
<tantra> [16577] Like oneself and reflection.
<tantra> [16578] Three kāyas: luminosity, emptiness,
<tantra> [16579] Not permanent, without entity,
<tantra> [16580] Not severed: luminosity-kāya,
<tantra> [16581] Without distinction, without outer-inner."
<tantra> [16582] Thus it is spoken.

[16583] The fourth:
[16584] To those to be trained by saṃbhoga-kāya, individually appearing according to family and maṇḍala,
[16585] Divided through emanation, empowered by those to be trained.
[16586] Saṃbhoga-kāya's Dharma-kāya Vairocana, great ocean,
[16587] That abiding manner: externally viewed, internally clear;
[16588] Internally viewed, externally clear;
[16589] Through thorough openness, without front or back;
[16590] From wherever viewed, like showing face—appearance: face in ten directions, completely open.

[16591] That field: completely adorned ornament-arrangement,
[16592] At the palm's lotus-top, reigning over twenty-five world-systems.

[16593] Field: completely pure dense array,
[16594] Retinue: not other than oneself,
[16595] Teaching: self-arisen wisdom self-appearing,
[16596] Time: realization directly manifest.

[16597] This, regarding self-appearance primordially as emanation,
[16598] Regarding those to be trained's luminosity, is posited as saṃbhoga-kāya through perfection of marks and signs.

[16599] Saṃbhoga-kāya's saṃbhoga-kāya: appearing as five families' principal five.
[16600] That defining characteristic: essence different, nature single.
[16601] Fields: individual families' maṇḍalas, immeasurable;
[16602] Field: great Akaniṣṭha, retinues of individual five families;
[16603] Teaching: engaging in five wisdoms of knowing;
[16604] Time: appearance of training flourishing.

[16605] Saṃbhoga-kāya's emanation-kāya:
[16606] Five families' Buddhas and individual principal retinues.
[16607] That defining characteristic: without nature in appearance,
[16608] Without conception in clarity.
[16609] That field: gods and goddesses, inconceivable, pure appearance of enjoyment.
[16610] Field: Trāyastrimśa, basis of wisdom-display;
[16611] Retinue: Buddhas and bodhisattvas, immeasurable;
[16612] Time: awareness self-appearing time.
[16613] Yet not yakṣa-realm Trāyastrimśa,
[16614] But five families' field-appearance,
[16615] Naturally pure,
[16616] Five lights' appearance self-clear,
[16617] Engaging in great enjoyment of five wisdoms' aspects,
[16618] Free from all affliction-pain.

<tantra> [16619] From Jewel Heap:
<tantra> [16620] "Through self-clear pure saṃbhoga-kāya,
<tantra> [16621] In five lights' pure celestial palace,
<tantra> [16622] Through elaboration-free bliss Speech,
<tantra> [16623] To five-kāya families' retinues,
<tantra> [16624] Non-entity pure dharmas
<tantra> [16625] Are emitted from five-wisdom-gathered Mind,
<tantra> [16626] Completely pure light-rays spread from tongue.
<tantra> [16627] Even to self-arisen six syllables,
<tantra> [16628] Unspoken, shown as great self-arisen."
<tantra> [16629] Thus it is spoken.

[16630] Saṃbhoga-kāya means:
[16631] Through essence, not demonstrating dharmas as word—thus "unspoken."
[16632] The six syllables' self-sound heard by those to be trained:
[16633] Like dream-words, appearing as spoken.

<tantra> [16634] From Six Expanses:
<tantra> [16635] "Without speaking from one's own mouth,
<tantra> [16636] In dream-like defining characteristic,
<tantra> [16637] To retinue's bodhisattvas,
<tantra> [16638] Wisdom's analytical thought appears in mind."
<tantra> [16639] Thus it is spoken.

[16640] The fourth: extensively explained enumerations from body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities:
[16641] Saṃbhoga-kāya's body:
[16642] Empty-clarity, like a rainbow.
[16643] Speech:
[16644] Those to be trained's self-appearance, like a dream.

[16651] Activities:

<tantra> [16653] From Thalgyur:

<tantra> [16655] Qualities, activities—five.
<tantra> [16656] Body: appearing, without nature,
<tantra> [16657] Clarity and clear-maker pervaded by families.

<tantra> [16669] To retinue, shown by own essence."
<tantra> [16670] Thus it is spoken.
