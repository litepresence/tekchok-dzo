[16436] The First:
[16437] In Dharmatā, from the perspective of that upon which one looks, since the essence of any is not established, it is free from the extremes of elaboration;
[16438] Since it transcends the grasping of entity identity, it is without arising, ceasing, transference, or transformation;
[16439] Since the ultimate is directly manifest, Dharmatā is inconceivable.
[16440] The Second:
[16441] The Dharmakāya pervading all of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, possessing twofold purity—pure through the purification of adventitious stains—is That.
[16442] <prose><tantra> From Hevajra:
[16443] <prose><tantra> "Sentient beings are truly Buddhas,
[16444] <prose><tantra> Yet obscured by adventitious stains.
[16445] <prose><tantra> When these are cleared away, they are truly Buddhas." || 10 ||
[16446] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16447] From Uttaratantra:
[16448] <verse> "The Perfect Buddha's Body is emanating,
[16449] <verse> Suchness is without distinction,
[16450] <verse> Because of possessing the Lineage, all sentient beings
[16451] <verse> Always possess the Essence of Buddhahood."
[16452] <verse> Thus the portion of direct manifestation is spoken.
[16453] The Third:
[16454] Each vehicle demonstrates Rigpa,
[16455] Emptiness, || 20 ||
[16456] And qualities and so forth.
[16457] Here in the Great Perfection, if divided through miraculous display:
[16458] Dharmakāya's Dharmakāya fields—inconceivable;
[16459] Abode—Dharmatā transcending the mind's grasping;
[16460] Samādhi—great Immovable;
[16461] Retinue—various self-nature, non-dual;
[16462] Teaching—indescribable Dharmatā;
[16463] Time—Dharmatā without transformation at any time.
[16464] Dharmakāya's Saṃbhogakāya fields—free from dust, without stain;
[16465] Abode—memory, mind's thought self-dissolved; || 30 ||
[16466] Samādhi—cessation of mind and mental factors' arisings, wisdom self-abiding;
[16467] Retinue—empty, self-appearance's agent;
[16468] Teaching—pure, complete perception;
[16469] Time—without investigation, great primordial equality.
[16470] Dharmakāya's Nirmāṇakāya:
[16471] Fields—emptiness, unbroken space;
[16472] Abode—arising-basis of all, great self-clarity of depth;
[16473] Samādhi—unceasing, self-clear;
[16474] Retinue—pure appearance without class-distinction;
[16475] Teaching—unfabricated self-nature; || 40 ||
[16476] Time—essence directly manifest.
[16477] These too are designated from Dharmakāya's aspect of primordial purity self-abiding.
[16478] <prose><tantra> From Ratnaketu:
[16479] <prose><tantra> "Through self-pure Dharmakāya,
[16480] <prose><tantra> Self-pure without elaboration, in celestial palace,
[16481] <prose><tantra> In appearance-retinue nondual with oneself,
[16482] <prose><tantra> Through markless Speech,
[16483] <prose><tantra> Elaboration-free words
[16484] <prose><tantra> Are emitted from nonabiding self-dissolved Mind.
[16485] <prose><tantra> Without speaking, without having spoken, || 50 ||
[16486] <prose><tantra> Shown in the state of Great Equality."
[16487] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[16488] These too are merely designated as aspects;
[16489] In meaning, since established nowhere, they abide in Great Perfection free from extremes.
[16490] <prose><tantra> From that very text:
[16491] <prose><tantra> "This abode of 'this,'
[16492] <prose><tantra> The named designated field with its marks,
[16493] <prose><tantra> Whatever form appears nowhere,
[16494] <prose><tantra> Nonexistent emptiness from Dharmodaya,
[16495] <prose><tantra> In the great secret Expanse, || 60 ||
[16496] <prose><tantra> Abiding from the primordial beginning,
[16497] <prose><tantra> Ungrasped, in the manner of abiding,
[16498] <prose><tantra> Great Play arose primordially.
[16499] <prose><tantra> Here none abide.
[16500] <prose><tantra> None make an abode.
[16501] <prose><tantra> Here there is no perfection.
[16502] <prose><tantra> Devoid of dwelling and coming.
[16503] <prose><tantra> Thus, the place of great primordial emptiness,
[16504] <prose><tantra> From nonexistence, the Expanse's field,
[16505] <prose><tantra> Here there is neither outer nor inner. || 70 ||
[16506] <prose><tantra> Above and below, no looking.
[16507] <prose><tantra> In directions and intermediate points, none ever
[16508] <prose><tantra> Has anything to grasp here."
[16509] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[16510] The Fourth: Extensive explanation of enumerations:
[16511] From Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities, and Activities—five:
[16512] Dharmakāya's Body—empty-clarity, markless;
[16513] Speech—indescribable, transcending words and speech;
[16514] Mind—without memory, thought, or elaboration;
[16515] Qualities—never regressing, without transformation; || 80 ||
[16516] Activities—spontaneous presence, abiding as basis of unceasing manifestation-manner.
[16517] <prose><tantra> From Thalgyur:
[16518] <prose><tantra> "Dharmakāya: Body and Speech,
[16519] <prose><tantra> Mind and Qualities and Activities.
[16520] <prose><tantra> Body: emptiness and clarity,
[16521] <prose><tantra> And markless self-nature.
[16522] <prose><tantra> Speech: separated from words, speech, and names,
[16523] <prose><tantra> Without speaking and discussing.
[16524] <prose><tantra> Mind: without thought and change,
[16525] <prose><tantra> Transcending spreading and investigating. || 90 ||
[16526] <prose><tantra> Qualities: never coming or regressing,
[16527] <prose><tantra> Pervading Expanse and jñāna,
[16528] <prose><tantra> And self-nature unfabricated.
[16529] <prose><tantra> Activities: unarisen, unborn,
[16530] <prose><tantra> Arising potency, without ceasing,
[16531] <prose><tantra> Without making, without having made."
[16532] <prose><tantra> Thus it is.
[16533] Saṃbhogakāya extensively explained also comprises
[16534] Essence,
[16535] Definitive terminology, || 100 ||
[16536] Divisions,
[16537] And enumerations—four aspects.
[16538] Essence's defining characteristic: completely perfect in great self-clarity,
[16539] Essence's abiding manner: unchanging in nature, Kāya of marks and signs, families clearly manifest yet unmoving.
[16540] Saṃbhogakāya's definitive terminology: engaging in appearance as Saṃbhogakāya, in that itself wisdom unceasingly engaging.
[16541] Kāya: great self-clear display-arrangement.
[16542] Saṃbhogakāya's divisions are four:
[16543] <list> Great element Essence-Kāya;
[16544] <list> All-pervading abiding manner Kāya;
[16545] <list> Appearance path Kāya; || 110 ||
[16546] <list> Those to be trained's appearance manner Kāya.
[16547] The first:
[16548] Self-arisen from Dharmakāya's manifestation-basis, perfected as the fivefold luminosity-Kāya:
[16549] Appearance-basis great elements' nature: clear warmth,
[16550] Coolness,
[16551] Spaciousness,
[16552] Possessing all-pervading identity.
[16553] The second:
[16554] For all Buddhas and sentient beings, the aspect of pervasion by light and light-mansion directly manifest.
[16555] <prose><tantra> From Self-Arisen: || 120 ||
[16556] <prose><tantra> "Abiding as light's heart-essence for all,
[16557] <prose><tantra> Thought-free completely pure Dharmadhātu,
[16558] <prose><tantra> The single without rival,
[16559] <prose><tantra> Maṇḍala, retinue, palace,
[16560] <prose><tantra> And awareness, emptiness, and clarity."
[16561] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16562] The third:
[16563] The Saṃbhogakāya of appearance-basis Dharmatā, appearing to sentient beings in the bardo as path, here guiding those to be trained—self-arisen from Dharmakāya's inner Expanse,
[16564] Within the expanse of light and color,
[16565] Maṇḍala, || 130 ||
[16566] Retinue,
[16567] Individual assemblies,
[16568] Kāya,
[16569] Wisdom,
[16570] Father,
[16571] Mother,
[16572] Kāya-colors,
[16573] Hand-symbols, and so forth clearly manifest.
[16574] <prose><tantra> From secret seed-cause,
[16575] <prose><tantra> To nature-appearance, || 140 ||
[16576] <prose><tantra> Nature-Kāya manifests;
[16577] <prose><tantra> Like oneself and reflection.
[16578] <prose><tantra> Three Kāyas: luminosity, emptiness,
[16579] <prose><tantra> Not permanent, without entity,
[16580] <prose><tantra> Not severed: luminosity-Kāya,
[16581] <prose><tantra> Without distinction, without outer-inner."
[16582] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16583] The fourth:
[16584] To those to be trained by Saṃbhogakāya, individually appearing according to family and maṇḍala,
[16585] Divided through emanation, empowered by those to be trained. || 150 ||
[16586] Saṃbhogakāya's Dharmakāya Vairocana, great ocean,
[16587] That abiding manner: externally viewed, internally clear;
[16588] Internally viewed, externally clear;
[16589] Through thorough openness, without front or back;
[16590] From wherever viewed, like showing face—appearance: face in ten directions, completely open.
[16591] That field: completely adorned ornament-arrangement,
[16592] At the palm's lotus-top, reigning over twenty-five world-systems.
[16593] Field: completely pure dense array,
[16594] Retinue: not other than oneself,
[16595] Teaching: self-arisen wisdom self-appearing, || 160 ||
[16596] Time: realization directly manifest.
[16597] This, regarding self-appearance primordially as emanation,
[16598] Regarding those to be trained's luminosity, is posited as Saṃbhogakāya through perfection of marks and signs.
[16599] Saṃbhogakāya's Saṃbhogakāya: appearing as five families' principal five.
[16600] That defining characteristic: essence different, nature single.
[16601] Fields: individual families' maṇḍalas, immeasurable;
[16602] Field: great Akaniṣṭha, retinues of individual five families;
[16603] Teaching: engaging in five wisdoms of knowing;
[16604] Time: appearance of training flourishing.
[16605] Saṃbhogakāya's Nirmāṇakāya: || 170 ||
[16606] Five families' Buddhas and individual principal retinues.
[16607] That defining characteristic: without nature in appearance,
[16608] Without conception in clarity.
[16609] That field: gods and goddesses, inconceivable, pure appearance of enjoyment.
[16610] Field: Trāyastriṃśa, basis of wisdom-display;
[16611] Retinue: Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, immeasurable;
[16612] Time: awareness self-appearing time.
[16613] Yet not yakṣa-realm Trāyastriṃśa,
[16614] But five families' field-appearance,
[16615] Naturally pure, || 180 ||
[16616] Five lights' appearance self-clear,
[16617] Engaging in great enjoyment of five wisdoms' aspects,
[16618] Free from all affliction-pain.
[16619] <prose><tantra> From Jewel Heap:
[16620] <prose><tantra> "Through self-clear pure Saṃbhogakāya,
[16621] <prose><tantra> In five lights' pure celestial palace,
[16622] <prose><tantra> Through elaboration-free bliss Speech,
[16623] <prose><tantra> To five-Kāya families' retinues,
[16624] <prose><tantra> Non-entity pure Dharmas
[16625] <prose><tantra> Are emitted from five-wisdom-gathered Mind, || 190 ||
[16626] <prose><tantra> Completely pure light-rays spread from tongue.
[16627] <prose><tantra> Even to self-arisen six syllables,
[16628] <prose><tantra> Unspoken, shown as great self-arisen."
[16629] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16630] Saṃbhogakāya means:
[16631] Through essence, not demonstrating Dharmas as word—thus "unspoken."
[16632] The six syllables' self-sound heard by those to be trained:
[16633] Like dream-words, appearing as spoken.
[16634] <prose><tantra> From Six Expanses:
[16635] <prose><tantra> "Without speaking from one's own mouth, || 200 ||
[16636] <prose><tantra> In dream-like defining characteristic,
[16637] <prose><tantra> To retinue's Bodhisattvas,
[16638] <prose><tantra> Wisdom's analytical thought appears in mind."
[16639] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16640] The fourth: extensively explained enumerations from Body, Speech, Mind, Qualities, and Activities:
[16641] Saṃbhogakāya's Body:
[16642] Empty-clarity, like a rainbow.

[16653] <prose><tantra> From Thalgyur:
[16654] <prose><tantra> "Saṃbhogakāya too: Body, Speech, Mind,
[16655] <prose><tantra> Qualities, Activities—five. || 220 ||
[16656] <prose><tantra> Body: appearing, without nature,
[16657] <prose><tantra> Clarity and clear-maker pervaded by families.
[16658] <prose><tantra> Speech: self-arisen, self-appearance,
[16659] <prose><tantra> Emanation-gathering aspects' wheel.

[16668] <prose><tantra> Self-arisen from tongue-tip, emanated,
[16669] <prose><tantra> To retinue, shown by own essence."
[16670] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16671] The third: extensively explained Nirmāṇakāya also comprises
[16672] Essence,
[16673] Definitive terminology,
[16674] Divisions,
[16675] And enumerations—four. || 240 ||
[16676] Essence:
[16677] Various, without determination.
[16678] That essence's abiding manner:
[16679] Liberated from attachment and fixation,
[16680] Samādhi: abiding evenly in the state of Mind without thought.
[16681] Definitive terminology:
[16682] Since emanated for whomever, whatever is to be trained, therefore "emanation;"
[16683] That very form complete with excellent marks, therefore "Kāya."
[16684] Divisions: common and uncommon approaches—two:
[16685] Common vehicle's renowned three: || 250 ||
[16686] <prose><tantra> From Sūtrālaṃkāra:
[16687] <prose><tantra> "Craft, birth, and great enlightenment,
[16688] <prose><tantra> Supreme enlightenment's emanation—
[16689] <prose><tantra> This Buddha's Nirmāṇakāya
[16690] <prose><tantra> Is the great method of complete liberation."
[16691] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16692] Craft:
[16693] Paintings and so forth.
[16694] Birth:
[16695] Buddha emanating as forms for common beings: horses, great fish, and so forth. || 260 ||
[16696] Supreme enlightenment's emanation:
[16697] The twelve deeds:
[16698] <prose><tantra> From Uttaratantra:
[16699] <prose><tantra> "Without moving from Dharmakāya,
[16700] <prose><tantra> Through emanation's various self-nature,
[16701] <prose><tantra> Birth, manifest birth,
[16702] <prose><tantra> Transference from Tuṣita abode,
[16703] <prose><tantra> Entry into womb and birth,

[16712] <prose><tantra> In impure fields,
[16713] <prose><tantra> Showing abiding as long as existence."
[16714] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[16715] In this uncommon vehicle: || 280 ||
[16716] Impure Nirmāṇakāya,
[16717] Nirmāṇakāya training beings,
[16718] And self-nature Nirmāṇakāya—three.
