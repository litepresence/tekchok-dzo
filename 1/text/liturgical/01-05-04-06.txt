[6424] <prose> At the seventh, the saṃsāra-destroyer king, and
[6425] <prose> Then, in the aeons of the intervals of sixty-four hundred-thousand, holding this secret heart-essence, acting for the benefit of beings,
[6426] <prose> Until the great aeon of strife-possessing, arranged by Vajradhara of the great Brahma.
[6427] <prose> The sequence of these extensively:
[6428] <tantra> Arises from the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra—
[6429] <prose> Each aeon,
[6430] <prose> Each enumeration of Buddha,
[6431] <prose> Each manner of liberation of gathered retinue, and the first:
[6432] <tantra> From the primordial first Buddha,
[6433] <prose> Until the aeon of strife-possessing, actually taught sixty-six within the category of the inexpressible— || 10 ||
[6434] <prose> The teaching of all, the number of sixty-four hundred-thousand.
[6435] <prose> The primordial first Buddha:
[6436] <verse> "First, the superior Smṛti-protector,
[6437] <prose> Mudrā of self-remembering wheel,
[6438] <prose> The word distinguishing superior from base,
[6439] <prose> Śikhin, arisen at the previous beginning.
[6440] <prose> By seventy myriads of this time,
[6441] <prose> This mudrā is supreme."
[6442] <prose> To:
[6443] <verse> "The wisdom-protector of exhausted mindfulness, || 20 ||
[6444] <prose> The essence, self-word, secret understood,
[6445] <prose> To the aeon of strife-possessing,
[6446] <prose> By the nineteen lineage-holders,
[6447] <prose> The definitive mudrā supreme held."
[6448] <prose> Thus inexpressible,
[6449] <tantra> From the blessings of the Buddhas,
[6450] <prose> In the self-arisen great letter,
[6451] <prose> Of the great primordially pure abiding,
[6452] <tantra> From the descent, all this self-arisen arose;
[6453] <prose> All this sequence of blessing also, || 30 ||
[6454] <prose> Self-shown from the first descent.
[6455] <prose> Thus to:
[6456] <verse> "Inexpressible" means other aeons and the sequence of Buddhas of the interval aeons condensed.
[6457] <prose> Those also, from the Great Arrangement:
[6458] <verse> "The primordial first Buddha,
[6459] <prose> The supreme thousand maṇḍala gathered.
[6460] <prose> Then at the second teaching,
[6461] <prose> Called Śikhin, protector of the world,
[6462] <prose> By the supreme thousand, this mudrā.
[6463] <prose> At the third teaching, || 40 ||
[6464] <prose> The thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector,
[6465] <prose> The thousand Buddhas' very heart essence rolled.
[6466] <prose> Then at the fourth teaching,
[6467] <prose> The thousand suns' king, and
[6468] <prose> By the thousand Buddhas, dominion conquered.
[6469] <prose> At the fifth teaching,
[6470] <prose> Called Jvalamukha, protector of the world,
[6471] <prose> In the heart of the supreme thousand, concealed.
[6472] <prose> At the sixth teaching,
[6473] <prose> The thousand light-rays' rim-protector, || 50 ||
[6474] <prose> By the thousand families, this very concealed.
[6475] <prose> Then at the seventh teaching,
[6476] <prose> The all-pervading saṃsāra-destroyer, Brahma-protector,
[6477] <prose> By the thousand great bliss, crown held.
[6478] <prose> Thus, thus is the teaching:
[6479] <prose> To sixty-four hundred-thousand,
[6480] <prose> By that many number of Buddhas,
[6481] <prose> This great secret fully held.
[6482] <prose> The definitive Buddhas of the teaching:
[6483] <prose> By nineteen hundred-thousand, || 60 ||
[6484] <prose> This very mudrā, essence rolled.
[6485] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[6486] <prose> That also, sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons,
[6487] <prose> Is the aeon of the great Brahma.
[6488] <tantra> From the arrangement of sixty-four hundred-thousand great emanations of that first protector himself,
[6489] <prose> Emanating as Buddhas, nineteen hundred-thousand to the perception of disciples, acting for benefit:
[6490] <prose> The arrangement of great Brahma in the abode of king supreme Samantabhadra,
[6491] <prose> The teaching showing the deed in the sky of the abode of one Kaustubha jewel, the thirteenth within the center of lotus petals on the palm of Vairocana's hand.
[6492] <prose> And in all the abodes of that kāya,
[6493] <prose> The teaching showing the deed in fields existing in other abodes of the five families transcends thought— || 70 ||
[6494] <prose> The Buddha's deed,
[6495] <prose> Qualities and activities,
[6496] <prose> Called "three kāyas equal to the sky"—
[6497] <prose> Tenth-ground bodhisattvas cannot measure;
[6498] <prose> How can worldly, seeing mind measure?
[6499] <tantra> From the Uttaratantra:
[6500] <verse> "Buddha-element and Buddha-awakening,
[6501] <prose> Buddha qualities and Buddha activities,
[6502] <prose> Even for pure beings, inconceivable."
[6503] <prose> Thus it is spoken. || 80 ||
[6504] <tantra> From the Ratnaketu:
[6505] <verse> "As much as the sky is pervaded,
[6506] <prose> The kāya also pervades that much.
[6507] <prose> As much as the kāya is pervaded,
[6508] <prose> Light also pervades that much.
[6509] <prose> As much as light is pervaded,
[6510] <prose> Speech also pervades that much."
[6511] <prose> Thus it was spoken.
[6512] <prose> Second, showing the enumeration of obtained liberation:
[6513] <prose> In this Jambudvīpa, by this great secret definitive teaching, || 90 ||
[6514] <prose> Although hundred-thousand non-human ḍākinīs beyond number are liberated,
[6515] <prose> Here on this occasion, the definite enumeration of liberation in this life and the intermediate state by the enumeration of men, women,
[6516] <prose> Fully ordained,
[6517] <prose> Boys and girls is:
[6518] <tantra> From the Great Arrangement:
[6519] <verse> "Listen, fortunate monk Pal:
[6520] <prose> I, from not abiding here,
[6521] <prose> Until sixty years of life,
[6522] <prose> One thousand results of liberation
[6523] <prose> Arising as self-release: || 100 ||
[6524] <prose> Monk form, half of that;
[6525] <prose> Remainder, bodhisattvas.
[6526] <prose> Then until fifty,
[6527] <prose> Arising, returning to self-place,
[6528] <prose> By two hundred-thousand, obtain birthless.
[6529] <prose> Mostly females' form,
[6530] <prose> Males, two thousand.
[6531] <prose> Then, in the interval of thirty years of life,
[6532] <prose> Six hundred-thousand,
[6533] <prose> These mostly males, || 110 ||
[6534] <prose> By one hundred-thousand females.
[6535] <prose> Arising, self-release.
[6536] <prose> Those, my former retinue,
[6537] <prose> In degenerate time, obtained Buddhahood.
[6538] <prose> The definite secret essence even gathered,
[6539] <tantra> From obtaining the result itself,
[6540] <prose> Not the result of other teaching.
[6541] <prose> If to other teaching,
[6542] <prose> Manifest Buddhas arise,
[6543] <prose> This meets, thus it is. || 120 ||
[6544] <prose> In the heart of all results,
[6545] <prose> This is the definite teaching."
[6546] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[6547] <prose> Shown is the number of self-pure arising in this life.
[6548] <prose> All who have obtained Buddhahood, wherever from, have become Buddha from the abode of this great secret,
[6549] <prose> Having seen the direct dharmatā of awareness-manifest, becoming Buddha—
[6550] <prose> For that is not surpassed by others.
[6551] <prose> That also, by the power of having gathered accumulations over many former aeons,
[6552] <prose> First meeting with this teaching,
[6553] <prose> Called the heart of the result for becoming Buddha without taking long; || 130 ||
[6554] <prose> All meeting with this teaching quickly obtain Buddhahood,
[6555] <prose> For they meet the heart of the result.
[6556] <prose> O fortunate master-disciple, possessor of Dharma,
[6557] <prose> In this life, or
[6558] <prose> In the bardo, or
[6559] <prose> In whichever field of natural emanation-kāya, definitely accomplish Buddhahood quickly,
[6560] <prose> For the cause, the power of definite Buddhahood-accomplishment without obstruction, meeting the pure teaching's heart of result, and by faith conducting in that.
[6561] <prose> O fortunate master-disciple, possessor of Dharma,
[6562] <prose> Formerly worshipped countless Buddhas and gathered in the retinue of Samantabhadra,
[6563] <prose> For conducting in the unsurpassed secret vehicle again. || 140 ||
[6564] <prose> If even merely meeting the common vehicle definitely has former merit-roots such as worshipping Buddhas,
[6565] <prose> Meeting such uncommon teaching has special former accumulations, and it pervades that well-practiced before.
[6566] <prose> Also from the Abhisamayālaṃkāra:
[6567] <verse> "Having specially served the Buddhas,
[6568] <prose> Planted merit-roots toward that,
[6569] <prose> Protected by spiritual friends,
[6570] <prose> Are vessels for hearing this."
[6571] <prose> Thus it was spoken.
[6572] <prose> The enumeration of liberation in the bardo:
[6573] <prose> Also from the former: || 150 ||
[6574] <verse> "Between the two births, manifestly Buddha,
[6575] <prose> In the interval of ten years of life, these:
[6576] <prose> Seven thousand meet the mother of appearances;
[6577] <prose> Males, indeed six thousand;
[6578] <prose> Female form, one thousand.
[6579] <prose> Thus males and females, boys and girls,
[6580] <prose> Whatever form they dwell in, easy—all who meet this are completely liberated."
[6581] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[6582] <prose> That also, having entered this definite secret supreme and obtained guidance and instructions,
[6583] <prose> Although the meaning is not obtained, || 160 ||
[6584] <prose> Those males, females, and children, by the benefit of hearing, definitely liberate quickly,
[6585] <prose> For they meet the unsurpassed heart of the result.
[6586] <prose> Third, expressing the definite prophecy of vidyādhara:
[6587] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[6588] <verse> "I, after parinirvāṇa,
[6589] <prose> In the land of Uḍḍiyana of the west,
[6590] <prose> To the goddess of Dhana Kośa,
[6591] <prose> The fatherless son, Vajra-He,
[6592] <prose> By this one, the supreme teaching is held.
[6593] <prose> That successor, in the western direction, || 170 ||
[6594] <prose> A brahmin child, fortunate,
[6595] <prose> Called Mañjuśrīpati,
[6596] <prose> Holds for seventy-five years.
[6597] <prose> That successor, fortunate,
[6598] <prose> In the place called Sośa Island,
[6599] <prose> Householder-born Śrī Siṃha,
[6600] <prose> By that one, will hold.
[6601] <prose> After that, the holder of outcaste family,
[6602] <prose> Jñānasūtra, holds this very teaching.
[6603] <prose> After that, the holder of householder family, || 180 ||
[6604] <prose> Holds by Mahāmudrā-holders.
[6605] <prose> After that, in the king family,
[6606] <prose> Holds together with emanation-reflection.
[6607] <prose> After that, in monastic form,
[6608] <prose> By Lhun-gyal-tshen.
[6609] <prose> After that, Siddha Śvara holds.
[6610] <prose> After that, dwelling on earth,
[6611] <prose> By bodhisattvas holds.
[6612] <prose> After that, Vajrapāṇi's
[6613] <prose> Emanation, Vajra Pha, holds. || 190 ||
[6614] <prose> After that, King Senge,
[6615] <prose> By Zangpo holds.
[6616] <prose> After that, Drakhar-Pa holds.
[6617] <prose> After that, by Yogi Srawa holds.
[6618] <prose> After that, King Khri-'od,
[6619] <prose> After that, monk Pal-dang-ldan,
[6620] <prose> Then by Lodrö Chok holds.
[6621] <prose> Then by ḍākinī Pal-'dzin-ma,
[6622] <prose> Having held this teaching,
[6623] <prose> Flourishes at the time of ten years of life; || 200 ||
[6624] <prose> Then, not abiding, to self-place."
[6625] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[6626] <prose> Thus our holy master, monk Pal-dang-ldan,
[6627] <prose> The sequence of prophecy of emanations arising until Kumārarāja, protector of beings,
[6628] <prose> Especially, in hundreds of years,
[6629] <prose> In this Tibet, Vimalamitra's emanation, time, definitely clarifying the places of this essence—established in the great history:
[6630] <prose> This is the supreme one, possessing the mole-mark of A on the nose-tip,
[6631] <prose> The definite key point of oral instructions excelling others,
[6632] <prose> Prophesying the future by clairvoyance,
[6633] <prose> Clearly showing the definite difficult points, || 210 ||
[6634] <prose> And filling the world with definite, exceeding marks even at the time of parinirvāṇa.
[6635] <prose> Whoever meets this, liberated without effort from the town of saṃsāra, has arisen as the ornament of Jambudvīpa.
[6636] <prose> Protector of beings, extremely compassionate,
[6637] <prose> Having become the world's guru-ornament, now arisen,
[6638] <prose> Having clearly shown the teaching of Clear Light Essence,
[6639] <prose> Gone to the peaceful sphere—to you, respectful prostration.
[6640] <prose> Always holding all of saṃsāra with compassion,
[6641] <prose> Although not passing to one-sided nirvāṇa peace,
[6642] <prose> By final deed, seeing beings' benefit,
[6643] <prose> Pervading the world with wonder—to you, respectful prostration. || 220 ||
[6644] <prose> In the first month of autumn, peaceful,
[6645] <prose> Having relinquished body-life in the supreme forest-retreat,
[6646] <prose> Again, what marvelous blessing-compassion,
[6647] <prose> Excelling others—to you, respectful prostration.
[6648] <prose> Where the protector became parinirvāṇa,
[6649] <prose> At that time, this earth with forests moved;
[6650] <prose> The appearance of five lights pervaded the sky,
[6651] <prose> Music's sweet sound played—to you, respectful prostration.
[6652] <tantra> From melting body-relics, light-rays blazing in the sky,
[6653] <prose> Adorned by ḍākinīs' offering-clouds and music, || 230 ||
[6654] <prose> All beings obtained non-conceptual meditation—
[6655] <prose> To the one showing limitless emanations, respectful prostration.
[6656] <prose> Siddhas, mantra-holders, and ḍākinī gatherings,
[6657] <prose> Completely surrounded by arrangements of immeasurable offering-clouds,
[6658] <prose> Gone to the field of vidyādhara-victors,
[6659] <prose> To the sky-goer who obtained siddhi, respectful prostration.
[6660] <prose> For future beings, as a supreme merit-field,
[6661] <tantra> From placed body-relics, the five families came,
[6662] <tantra> From the crown, the fields of five families like rainbows,
[6663] <prose> Adorned with five lights, come—to you, respectful prostration. || 240 ||
[6664] <prose> Wherever body-relic fragments were invited,
[6665] <prose> Even when stūpas were erected and charity was done,
[6666] <prose> Five lights' appearance pervaded the sky,
[6667] <prose> Greatly moving beings' minds—to you, respectful prostration.
[6668] <prose> Vimalamitra, protector, compassionate,
[6669] <prose> By many emanations acting for beings' benefit,
[6670] <prose> Gone as emanation-ornament to the land of Tibet,
[6671] <prose> To Kumārarāja, the teacher, respectful prostration.
[6672] <prose> This clearly expresses the prophecy of our holy master as the emanation of vidyādhara.
[6673] <prose> Thus, in Jambudvīpa, by the gathering of vidyādhara-victors holding the supreme teaching, seven generations of flourishing passed, || 250 ||
[6674] <tantra> From passing of ten years of life:
[6675] <prose> As shown before, the teaching's seed leaped to fields such as the Beautiful Arrangement, and acting for the benefit of ripening all beings.
[6676] <prose> When, from this good eon's thousand, passed a hundred million eons of formation and destruction,
[6677] <prose> At the eon called "Saṃsāra-Emptier,"
[6678] <prose> Buddha Wheel Lightning Garland completely holding this supreme teaching,
[6679] <prose> Having liberated beings from saṃsāra,
[6680] <prose> All beings of the great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara are liberated in the primordial ground, and the three seeds of the teaching also dissolve into the sphere of reality;
[6681] <prose> Saṃsāra is emptied;
[6682] <tantra> From here, in twenty thousand great aeons, embodied ones do not appear.
[6683] <prose> Then again, as before, from the arising of latent tendencies, when the vessel and environment of beings appear, || 260 ||
[6684] <prose> The teacher of method also arises from the power of primordial Samantabhadra.
[6685] <tantra> As said in the Sound Great Thalgyur Tantra:
[6686] <verse> "This secret heart-essence teaching,
[6687] <prose> Thus, from the passing of seven teachings,
[6688] <tantra> From definitely experiencing seven fields,
[6689] <prose> Thus, from the passing of seven also,
[6690] <prose> On the threshold of Vajra Seat,
[6691] <prose> The seed of all teachings' speech,
[6692] <prose> The very self-arisen great syllable,
[6693] <prose> Descends with sound; || 270 ||
[6694] <prose> Here, in a hundred-million aeons,
[6695] <prose> By Wheel Lightning Garland,
[6696] <prose> Will appear to the Bhagavān.
[6697] <prose> Then, three hundred years,
[6698] <prose> Thus, below the passing of three,
[6699] <prose> The teaching's mind-vajra also
[6700] <prose> Will appear to that teacher.
[6701] <prose> Then, in five hundred years,
[6702] <prose> The teaching's kāya also descended there;
[6703] <prose> Thus, from the actual descent of teaching, || 280 ||
[6704] <prose> Again the teaching's ember arises.
[6705] <prose> Even in that teacher's retinue,
[6706] <prose> Called Ārya Brahma-Light,
[6707] <prose> To miraculous-power-possessing perfection,
[6708] <prose> Extremely faithful, aspiring,
[6709] <prose> Definitely held, manifestly appeared.
[6710] <prose> That, etc., the teacher's retinue:
[6711] <prose> Ārya śrāvakas, twenty thousand,
[6712] <prose> Vinaya teaching, one eon
[6713] <prose> Placed in the arhat result itself; || 290 ||
[6714] <prose> Then six dark aeons,
[6715] <prose> After that passed, two hundred-thousand arhats,
[6716] <prose> Gathered in one's own retinue;
[6717] <prose> Sūtra teaching, eight aeons,
[6718] <prose> Placed at the end of provisional-definitive action.
[6719] <tantra> From miraculous power and control,
[6720] <prose> Definitely propelled, the teaching complete,
[6721] <prose> Again showing the manner of parinirvāṇa.
[6722] <prose> Then two dark aeons,
[6723] <prose> Then from the teacher's body born, || 300 ||
[6724] <prose> The retinue of great bodhisattvas,
[6725] <prose> Eight thousand gathered,
[6726] <prose> Supreme aspiration, Excellent-Terror-Glory,
[6727] <prose> Greatly showing, the teaching gathered.
[6728] <prose> Abhidharma teaching, a hundred aeons,
[6729] <prose> All obtaining result in one life.
[6730] <prose> At this time, saṃsāra is eradicated;
[6731] <prose> By beings, Buddhahood is obtained;
[6732] <prose> The appearance of six migrations is not possible.
[6733] <prose> In twenty thousand aeons, || 310 ||
[6734] <tantra> From the continuity of beings' saṃsāra ceasing,
[6735] <prose> Embodied ones do not appear.
[6736] <prose> Then, by the distinction of karma,
[6737] <prose> Although beings have no former afflictions,
[6738] <prose> By the power of arisen latent tendencies,
[6739] <prose> Forms taking extremely subtle,
[6740] <tantra> From extremely subtle, many in number,
[6741] <prose> Form-possessing beings' bodies will grow.
[6742] <prose> Thus inexpressible by words,
[6743] <prose> The end of the teaching, inconceivable— || 320 ||
[6744] <prose> Briefly indicated by words.
[6745] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[6746] <prose> Here, some masters
[6747] <prose> Consider that all beings in Samantabhadra's abode are emptied,
[6748] <prose> Some consider that all beings of the great Brahma arranged by Vajradhara are liberated;
[6749] <verse> "The end of the teaching is inconceivable,"
[6750] <prose> Thus it is considered that in Samantabhadra's abode, still immeasurable.
[6751] <prose> However, there is no contradiction,
[6752] <prose> For by Samantabhadra's compassion, all are liberated, and
[6753] <prose> Arising from the sphere, still immeasurable latent tendencies—the two are not contradictory; || 330 ||
[6754] <prose> Even if recognized as the measure of vast liberation, it is supreme good.
[6755] <tantra> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[6756] <prose> Showing the difficult points from the definitive meaning of the great secret—the fifth chapter.
[6757] <prose> Thus, having established from the tantra's abode of knowing, the branch of confidence,
[6758] <prose> Now, from that abode, whatever meanings arise are to be shown;
