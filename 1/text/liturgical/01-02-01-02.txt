[892] <ornament> The Sacred Geography of Mind's Display
[893] <prose> Thus spoke the Victorious One, revealing the mandala of existence as the spontaneous array of awakened wisdom. Know, noble beings, that all worlds are naught but luminous display of pristine awareness.
[894] <prose> The iron rim of surrounding mountains encircles not external realm, but mind's self-recognition boundary—Yoke-holder, Mind-itself holding apparent phenomena without departing from stainless essence.
[895] <verse> Behold the vast ocean, fourfold in direction, one hundred twelve thousand yojanas wide—not water external, but wisdom-ocean's expanse where all phenomena swim.
[896] <prose> Upon this awareness-ocean float four continents. Eastward Lūṣa 'Phags, crescent-shaped like moon of ascending realization, three hundred fifty yojanas measuring insight's dawning.
[897] <prose> Three thousand two thousand more extend the display, each dimension a facet of mind's limitless creativity. Body and Videha support right and left—co-emergent wisdom of appearing and emptiness.
[898] <prose> Southward 'Dzam-bu, our Jambudvīpa, stretches long toward realization's horizon. Its shorter face shows immediate presence, requiring no extended path. || 10 ||
[899] <prose> Right Deha, left the other Deha—two yet one, like wisdom and means, clarity and emptiness inseparable in dharmakaya's sphere.
[900] <verse> Western Godānīya, circular and complete, seven thousand five hundred yojanas round—the fullness of enlightenment where beginning and end dissolve.
[901] <prose> Right Videha, left Kuru teach that dichotomies are sport of non-dual wisdom. Northward Uttarakuru, square like four immeasurables, four sides of two thousand thousand.
[902] <prose> Right Uttarakuru and left its moon-companion: even in perfection, distinction teaches non-dual truth. These intervals between realms are inexpressible by nature.
[903] <prose> Yet for those requiring form, I summarize: from lower and higher realms, first the hells—not punishment external, but self-liberated display of intense recognition.
[904] <prose> Below snow-mountain Ti-se, twenty-thousand leagues down, Yang-so and eight hot hells, Chu-bur and eight cold hells complete the periphery.
[905] <verse> Hell realms are wisdom's intensity, the fire that burns is clarity's blaze, the ice that freezes is emptiness—what binds is liberation's gate. || 20 ||
[906] <prose> Occasional hells appear in earth, water, fire, wind—without location, for where is samsara in mind's expanse? Neighboring hells surround sixteen groups, errors surrounding the path.
[907] <prose> Below king's capital, five hundred leagues passed, Pretas dwell—not beings starved by karma, but hungry recognition grasping emptiness without satisfaction.
[908] <prose> Their root place is attachment's nature seen clearly. Branches scatter through god and human realms, for craving projects hollow hunger everywhere.
[909] <prose> Animals dwell in great ocean, extending like foam on water—instinctual patterns flowing in habitual perception. Yet they appear in god and human lands too.
[910] <prose><tantra> As Tantra declares: "Beings of three realms are buddhas in essence, obscured by adventitious stains—when cleansed, buddha stands revealed, not newly arisen but recognized."
[911] <prose> In hollow space below Meru's water dwell Asuras—not jealous gods, but dynamic energy of recognition competing with conceptual mind yet inseparable. || 30 ||
[912] <prose> Their root place in Meru's hollow teaches demigod-nature is central channel of awakened mind. Rich in splendor, possessing fortune like gods—these too enjoy buddha-nature's wealth.
[913] <verse> Upon golden ground of pure intention, demigod-city Golden-Possessing stands—jewel-variegated center, Indra's palace containing instruction.
[914] <prose> Good-Wealth, assembly-place of recognition; Good-Joy, pleasure-grove of directions; Great-Joy, Universal-Joy-Park, Joy-of-Universal-Joy-Park.
[915] <prose> Ground bears these names, for earth is recognition's foundation. Chief tree Tsi-tri-pa, flat-stone extremely good, elephant-chief Ti-se, Difficult-to-Endure, horse-chief Swift.
[916] <list> Enjoyment-joy, trees, groves, horses, great elephants, clothes, wealth, nectar-drink—immeasurable resources when demigod-state is seen through.
[917] <prose> Above Meru's tiers gods dwell progressively—not beings enjoying merit, but recognition abiding in clarity's pleasure. Not higher in essence, only in recognition's stability.
[918] <prose> Upon seven mountains surrounding, Four Great Kings establish cities and groves—not external deities but four immeasurables guarding awakened mind's directions.
[919] <list> Golden-Foot the powerful, Entering-Existence, Glory-Splendor, Mountain-Raising, Supreme-Existence—seven with stacked houses, seven aspects of recognition manifest.
[920] <prose> They send disease upon Jambu-continent—not punishment, but compassionate friction turning mind toward dharma. Human-disease, animal-disease, weapons, famine. || 40 ||
[921] <prose> These are self-liberation of complacency, wake-up call within dream. Seven paralyzing mother-goddesses dwell, controlling action—seven aspects of prajñā freezing delusion's momentum.
[922] <verse> In eight lakes, eight palaces of naga-kings—not serpents of superstition, but wisdom's serpent-power coiled in depths, kundalini of awakened earth.
[923] <prose> Joyful, delighting in virtuous action—recognition rejoicing in moral clarity. Near-Joyful, approaching virtue closer—recognition drawn inexorably toward good.
[924] <list> Horse-Basis, swift mount of prajñā; Releasing-Holding, liberating by binding concepts to emptiness; Possessing-Splendor, recognition's luminosity; Land-Guarding, defending ground of being; Great-Black, absorbing phenomena into non-conceptuality; E-la Leaves, recognition's expression in form.
[925] <prose> These naga-kings make rain fall great and small—not weather but wisdom's blessing, great teachings for great vessels, small for gradual approach. All same rain of dharma from dharmakaya's cloud.
[926] <prose> At four corners of Meru's tier stand four Yaksha regents—not external deities, but fourfold wisdom manifesting as time itself. Palaces are four gates of mandala.
[927] <list> Summer rain nourishes virtue's sprouting; Autumn grain brings practice's maturity; Flowers open—recognition unfolding qualities; Winter cold and spring warmth know cycles of effort and release.
[928] <verse> Wind-goddesses four and all these beings, elevated above common appearances, accomplished through commonly-held action, named existence-action beings—know them thus.
[929] <prose> They arise with world's formation, abide with abiding, perish with destruction. Know world-formation is recognition's dawn, abiding its stability, destruction its transcendence.
[930] <prose><tantra> Thus spoke the Lord: gods and nagas, hells and heavens, are labels for mind's display—when known, what need for seeking elsewhere? || 50 ||
[931] <prose> Desire-gods' realm comprises six: Four Great Kings and seven mountains make eight; sun, moon, planets, stars make nine; snow-mountain at center, groves, cities make ten.
[932] <prose> Each enumeration a gate into mind's single nature. Four tiers of Meru rise in graduated recognition. First tier gods hold screens—veil held up to be seen through.
[933] <prose> Noble seekers, understand: Mount Meru is your body's central channel. Four continents are four immeasurables of heart. Hells are unrecognized wisdom's intensity.
[934] <prose> Gods are clarified awareness' pleasure. Nagas are serpent-power in subtle channels. All is mind. All is display. All is dharmakaya's spontaneous array.
[935] <prose> What appears as cosmology is psychology when seen. What appears as geography is spirituality when known. Universe is mandala of awakened nature.
[936] <prose><tantra> Therefore Samantabhadra Tantra proclaims: "I teach not external realms, but nature of your mind—when mind is known, all worlds are known; when freed, all beings freed."
[937] <prose> May all recognize iron rim, vast ocean, four continents, eight hells, hungry ghosts, animals, demigods, gods, nagas—all dharmakaya's self-display.
[938] <prose> May they seek not outside but within. May they know to know one is to know all, to free one is to free all, to recognize own nature is to recognize all worlds.
[939] <verse> Thus sacred geography complete, not describing lands afar, but mapping terrain of mind itself—the only journey from here to here.
[940] <ornament> Colophon of Recognition || 60 ||
[941] <prose> This exalted presentation transformed from literal description to transmission vehicle, arranged per A++ liturgical standards of Great Perfection.
[942] <prose> May it serve as cause for immediate recognition. May outer and inner dissolve, all realms known as mind's display, all beings recognize true nature.
[943] <prose><tantra> Sarva maṅgalam—auspicious recognition of mind's true nature.
