[2989] First: When sound is heard, only the sound-holding consciousness arises.
[2990] As with form and so forth, the holding consciousness does not arise simultaneously.
[2991] When consciousness enters an object, only that consciousness arises, others do not arise.
[2992] Whatever the number of aspects, that many consciousnesses are asserted.
[2993] Second: Appearances also arise from consciousness in various outer forms.
[2994] The holding consciousness also arises from mind.
[2995] As an egg is split, aspects and consciousnesses possessing objects appear in a single mind.
[2996] When holding objects now, outer aspect consciousness and inner-holding consciousness both arise.
[2997] Through beginningless latent tendencies, both appear thus.
[2998] Self-awareness alone, nothing else is established—like an egg is split. || 10 ||
[2999] If one says: "When outer aspect consciousness holds, at that time holding consciousness arises, two thoughts simultaneously"—it does not become thus.
[3000] It does not change.
[3001] That aspect consciousness is without thought—for this reason.
[3002] Third: When outer objects appear as various aspects,
[3003] A single inner-holding consciousness knows.
[3004] As when a monkey quickly enters a fortress,
[3005] Appearing in four apertures, entering and entering, looking and looking,
[3006] Entering through the five doors, a single consciousness knows the object.
[3007] At the moment of knowing, both aspect and consciousness are not different in the nature of a single mind.
[3008] Like a dream appearance and the self-appearing holder—both are undifferentiated in a single sleep consciousness. || 20 ||
[3009] Second: The false aspects.
[3010] The outer meaning aspect appearing mistakenly to consciousness is a false latent tendency.
[3011] Not true to consciousness.
[3012] The meeting consciousness also measures falsity.
[3013] Experience measures truth—no measurement exists.
[3014] Both object and consciousness are merely the nature of mistaken false appearance.
[3015] In this, there is division: the false with stain, the false intermediate, and that which is wished.
[3016] The stainless, the pure, and the intermediate—these two.
