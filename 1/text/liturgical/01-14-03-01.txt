[17884] First essence
[17885] Object subject grasper-holder arise knowledge what non-Awareness pervader exist
[17886] Definition is
[17887] Grasper-holder arise through of object and subject mind through of mind thus called
[17888] Above two mind also samadhi one-pointed on attach grasper-holder
[17889] Desire in all-conception coarse
[17890] Distinction if
[17891] Pure and impure two
[17892] Pure on mind-itself pure and
[17893] Mind pure two from
[17894] Mind-itself pure
[17895] Mind mental-factors and thing mark grasp through of empty Dharma-nature thusness self-Awareness
[17896] Rahu grasp object on praise from
[17897] Speak-think express-void prajnaparamita
[17898] Not-arise unceasing space essence
[17899] Self jnana object-field

[17901] Thus arise like
[17902] Mind pure
[17903] Path time mind conception through of uncorrupted liberation cause suitable samadhi arise and
[17904] Realization-possess compassion mind-generate etc liberation cause suitable
[17905] Precious-garland from

[17907] Enlightenment accomplish some on
[17908] Thus and
[17909] Not-attachment not-hatred delusion nonexistent
[17910] That produce karma virtuous
[17911] Thus like
[17912] These all also self-arisen ultimate meaning general grasp through of directly object impossible through of
[17913] Samsara aspect belonging mind gather
[17914] Uttaratantra from
[17915] Self-arisen ultimate that
[17916] Faith itself realization object on
[17917] Sun mandala clear-light though
[17918] Eye not-possess through of see nonexistent
[17919] Thus spoken like
[17920] Impure mind distinction if two
[17921] Briefly-shown and
[17922] Extensively-explained
[17923] First is expanse on impure nonexistent though
[17924] That from move time basis-appearance from cut impossible what also arise
[17925] Non-Awareness play from mind
[17926] Mind ornament from intellect
[17927] Intellect from affliction arise
[17928] That also play is capacity or power or ray like that from arise tone just
[17929] Seed from sprout and
[17930] Face form from that reflection mirror in arise like
[17931] Ornament is that from ripen arise grain portion just seed flower and mark like
[17932] That like also self-arisen from
[17933] Completely pure primordial-pure appearance on non-Awareness nonexistent
[17934] Mind not-exist
[17935] Intellect nonexistent though
[17936] Spontaneous-accomplishment power from
[17937] Non-awareness arise
[17938] Non-Awareness play from mind arise
[17939] Mind ornament from intellect arise
[17940] Intellect object from five-poisons arise
[17941] Five-poisons from afflictions sixteen arise
[17942] Sixteen from twenty-five arise
[17943] That from fifty-one arise
[17944] That from thousand eight ten four arise thus
[17945] Second extensively-explained on three
[17946] Root ignorance genitive division
[17947] That from arisen mind genitive division
[17948] That from arisen affliction genitive division extensively explained
[17949] First is again that itself from
[17950] Ignorance this like
[17951] Root mind genitive ignorance and
[17952] Confusion object genitive ignorance and
[17953] Confusion-basis basis genitive ignorance and
[17954] Grasping thought genitive ignorance and
[17955] Artificial path genitive ignorance and
[17956] Not-knowing delusion genitive ignorance and
[17957] Thus ignorance form six as arisen and self genitive appear not-see go says
[17958] That also sequence like
[17959] First rigpa self face not-know through of self on other as confused delusion and
[17960] Appear object genitive essence nature not-have as not-know genitive delusion and
[17961] Condition from confusion scarecrow man as confused like delusion and
[17962] Rigpa essence on self not-have although form on self as delusion self genitive house says like delusion and
[17963] Path like artificial and
[17964] Antidote poison as become and free not give genitive delusion and
[17965] Nature through of light-clear genitive meaning not-know through of always samsara in delusion
[17966] Second that from arisen genitive mind genitive division
[17967] Self-shine from
[17968] Mind genitive division this like
[17969] Mind genitive division this like
[17970] Various gather water-like mind and
[17971] Clean-unclean not-have pig-like mind and
[17972] Brave timid great tiger-like mind and
[17973] Light feather-like mind and
[17974] Move wind-like mind and
[17975] Greatly intoxicated mud-puddle-like mind and
[17976] Spread fire-spark-like mind and
[17977] Desire bird-like mind and
[17978] Expand branch-like mind and
[17979] Stop difficult garuda-like mind and
[17980] Planet-tether not-have madman-like mind and eleven are says
[17981] Those also sequence like object and latencies various gathered through of water and
[17982] Accept-reject on deluded through of pig and
[17983] Anger and pride coarse through of tiger and
[17984] Object many on enter from focus one on not-decide superimposition and
[17985] Move on obstacle nonexistent wind and
[17986] Object desire through of intoxicate mire and
[17987] One from many conceptions spread fire and
[17988] Object accept desire bird and
[17989] Knowledge power expand through of meaning examine branch and
[17990] Object through of Awareness grasp that power into gone actor and
[17991] Not-diverge object knowledge direction not-give waver mad like mind
[17992] These all also object and condition through of virtuous non-virtuous unspecified mind three gather
[17993] Mind from intellect arise
[17994] All search intellect etc six
[17995] Third that from arise affliction distinction on three
[17996] Six root afflictions
[17997] Sixteen proximate afflictions
[17998] Subtle-arise clear limitless afflictions
[17999] First is sun-moon union from
[18000] Afflictions is six
[18001] Non-Awareness thus called basis delusion-conception part grasp
[18002] Delusion is Wisdom part from delusion
[18003] Anger is produce sequence from delusion
[18004] Pride is view part from delusion
[18005] Desire is appearance part from delusion
[18006] Jealousy is nonrealized part from delusion thus
[18007] That-also sequence like object subject delusion-conception part delusion and
[18008] Wisdom Awareness from reverse just not-know and
[18009] Object on hate part-possess and
[18010] I-am pride and
[18011] Object desire and
[18012] Meaning nonrealized through of other on anger
[18013] Second sixteen proximate afflictions
[18014] Self-arisen from
[18015] Sixteen what say
[18016] Non-awareness and
[18017] Mind and
[18018] Intellect and
[18019] Grasp and
[18020] Conception and
[18021] Not-know and
[18022] Not-see and
[18023] Not-realize and
[18024] Not-understand and
[18025] Self that impure and
[18026] I as grasp and
[18027] Other on jealousy do and
[18028] Desire and
[18029] Attachment and
[18030] Pride and
[18031] Spread and sixteen thus
[18032] These all also sequence like
[18033] That alone not-know delusion through of all affliction make and
[18034] Object on mind grasp and
[18035] Subject on grasp intellect and
[18036] Both on self as grasp and
[18037] All conception and
[18038] Meaning non-Awareness and
[18039] Nature aim not-see and
[18040] Word meaning nonrealized and
[18041] General-specific not-understand and
[18042] Delusion know after promise meaning before wrong form and
[18043] Object I as grasp and
[18044] Other excellence on not-happy and
[18045] Object take and
[18046] Object on special desire and
[18047] Slightly puff pride and
[18048] Object on spread anger
[18049] Third subtle-arise clear limitless afflictions on three
[18050] Twenty-five
[18051] Fifty-one
[18052] Thousand eight ten four
[18053] First is root non-Awareness pervader exist through of separately not-counted
[18054] Pervaded five-poisons on five distinguish through of twenty-five
[18055] Self-arisen from
[18056] Delusion on five
[18057] Very-dull delusion and
[18058] Not-know delusion and
[18059] Not-see delusion and
[18060] Very-dark delusion and
[18061] Very-intoxicate delusion and five
[18062] Desire also five
[18063] Face desire and

[18065] Life not-care desire and
[18066] Anger possessing desire and
[18067] Space move desire and five
[18068] Anger also five
[18069] Desire much anger and
[18070] Rage possessing anger and
[18071] Very-coarse anger and
[18072] Delusion possessing anger and
[18073] Time thunder-rain like anger five
[18074] Pride also five
[18075] Suppress lion like pride and
[18076] Above nonexistent space like pride and
[18077] Brave brave great tiger like pride and
[18078] I-am think vulture like pride and
[18079] Unequal equal elephant like pride and five
[18080] Jealousy also five
[18081] Subtle jealousy and
[18082] I from arise jealousy and
[18083] Very-harsh jealousy and
[18084] Coarse jealousy and
[18085] View jealousy and five
[18086] That is afflictions twenty-five thus
[18087] Second fifty-one is that like twenty-five on object grasp afflictions twenty-five
[18088] Subject grasp afflictions twenty-five fifty
[18089] Root non-Awareness and root one arise
[18090] Third thousand eight ten four
[18091] Desire from become twenty-one thousand
[18092] Anger from become twenty-one thousand
[18093] Delusion from become twenty-one thousand
[18094] Part equal from become twenty-one thousand
[18095] Sum thousand eight and four
[18096] Afflictions eighty-four thousand also clear limitless distinguish if measure nonexistent mind not-comprehend
[18097] That-also arise from
[18098] That from mind not-comprehend speech not-utter
[18099] Count impossible arise thus
[18100] These all also mind and
[18101] Intellect and
[18102] Recollection and
[18103] Latency and
[18104] Doubt through of produce and all from arise and affliction influence through of imprint through of samsara affliction do action-possess
[18105] Sun-moon union from
[18106] These etc afflictions is thought all follow hold mind and
[18107] Recollection all follow hold intellect and
[18108] Interval connect latency and
[18109] Doubt all basis become conception and
[18110] Object and thing grasp part etc measure nonexistent thus
[18111] That like karma and afflictions all three-realm mind mental-factors on depend through of
[18112] That also consciousness group eight
[18113] Basis-all consciousness object not-think appear cause become consciousness conception-nonexistent clear and
[18114] That from spread door five knowledge from
[18115] Eye consciousness form grasp conception-nonexistent
[18116] Ear consciousness sound grasp conception-nonexistent
[18117] Nose consciousness smell grasp conception-nonexistent
[18118] Tongue consciousness taste grasp realize-nonexistent
[18119] Body consciousness touch grasp conception-nonexistent
[18120] That from grasp-holder intellect-consciousness two
[18121] Object first general grasp intellect-consciousness and
[18122] After particular grasp affliction-intellect
[18123] Grasped and grasper
[18124] Intellect-consciousness this two on
[18125] Virtuous non-virtuous unspecified three exist and
[18126] Conception-possess conception-nonexistent each suitable exist
[18127] Door five and basis-all consciousness conception-nonexistent
[18128] Thus three-realm mind and mental-factors fifty-one all abandon object superimposition only
[18129] Two-truths from
[18130] Mind and mental-factors three-realm
[18131] Superimposition form-possess conception
[18132] Thus
[18133] These abandon object
[18134] Non-Awareness nature is reason
[18135] Here mind path make Buddha desire great-text madhyamaka etc tradition through of also
[18136] Mind and mind-itself two distinguish through of mind group eight or seven or six nature abandon object gather through of
[18137] Mind-itself nature through of pure accept object realize through of path cultivate on enter do
[18138] This also that and part similar
[18139] Awareness and Awareness from arise mind-itself and
[18140] Self characteristic grasp mind thus explain
[18141] Six-expanse from
[18142] Hey mind-hero great
[18143] Awareness and Awareness from arise mind-itself is stain and conception all from beyond
[18144] Brief nirvana cause and fruit all
[18145] Awareness self-appearance see beings object-field
[18146] Self characteristic grasp mind is thus superimpose appearance all and
[18147] Exist appearance and

[18158] Brief samsara Dharma all is self characteristic grasp mind
[18159] Beings six-classes self-same appearance all thus spoken
[18160] Then this two same question
[18161] Difference great
[18162] Common vehicle view-meditation-conduct what do also mind from transcend impossible and
[18163] Here mind unmixed Awareness direct through of more-superior etc many
[18164] Fourth each meaning on mind basis and

[18182] Move part wind
[18183] Awareness part Awareness tone
[18184] That-also heart inside Awareness thing water like
[18185] That from power tone navel channel enter through of wind mix mind that water bubble like
[18186] Mind that Awareness channel-path tone
[18187] That-also mind is Awareness exist nonexistent follow do
[18188] Awareness is mind exist nonexistent follow go-return not-do through of
[18189] Essence on mind power in Awareness not-become and
