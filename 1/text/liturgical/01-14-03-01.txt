[17884] <ornament> First, the essence:</ornament>
[17885] <prose> The awareness of what arises as grasper-holder of object and subject, while non-awareness is the pervader.</prose>
[17886] <ornament> Definition:</ornament>
[17887] <prose> Because arising as grasper-holder, by mind of object and subject, thus it is called mind.</prose>
[17888] <prose> The mind of the above two also attaches to one-pointed samadhi as grasper-holder.</prose>
[17889] <prose> If desired, it is coarse all-conception.</prose>
[17890] <prose> If distinguished:</prose>
[17891] <list> Pure and impure two.</list>
[17892] <prose> In pure:</prose>
[17893] <list> Mind-itself pure and</list>
[17894] <list> Mind pure—two.</list>
[17895] <prose> Mind-itself pure is self-awareness of suchness, dharma-nature empty of grasping mind, mental factors, and things as marks.</prose>
[17896] <prose> From Praise of Rahu Grasping Object:</prose>
[17897] <verse> "Prajnaparamita inexpressible by speech and thought, || 10 ||</verse>
[17898] <verse> Not-arisen, unceasing, essence of space,</verse>
[17899] <verse> Object-field of self primordial wisdom,</verse>
[17900] <verse> Homage to the mother of Buddhas of three times."</verse>
[17901] <prose> Thus it arises like.</prose>
[17902] <prose> Mind pure is</prose>
[17903] <prose> At path time, mind not corrupted by conception, arising as samadhi suitable as liberation cause,</prose>
[17904] <prose> And possessing realization, compassion mind-generate, etc. suitable as liberation cause.</prose>
[17905] <prose> From the Garland of Pearls:</prose>
[17906] <verse> "Possessing essence of emptiness and compassion,</verse>
[17907] <verse> For some accomplishing enlightenment. || 20 ||</verse>
[17908] <verse> Thus and—</verse>
[17909] <verse> Without attachment, without hatred, without delusion,</verse>
[17910] <verse> Karma produced by that is virtuous.</verse>
[17911] <verse> Thus like."</verse>
[17912] <prose> These all also, because impossible to directly objectify self-arisen ultimate meaning general grasp,</prose>
[17913] <prose> Are gathered as mind belonging to samsara aspect.</prose>
[17914] <prose> From the Uttaratantra:</prose>
[17915] <verse> "That self-arisen ultimate,</verse>
[17916] <verse> As realization object of faith itself,</verse>
[17917] <verse> Though clear light of sun mandala,</verse>

[17919] <verse> Thus it is spoken."</verse>
[17920] <prose> In impure mind, if distinguished, two:</prose>
[17921] <list> Briefly shown, and</list>
[17922] <list> Extensively explained.</list>
[17923] <prose> First, though impure does not exist on expanse,</prose>
[17924] <prose> From that moving, from basis-appearance, unobstructed cut, anything arises.</prose>
[17925] <prose> From play of non-awareness, mind,</prose>
[17926] <prose> From ornament of mind, intellect,</prose>
[17927] <prose> From intellect, affliction arises.</prose>
[17928] <prose> That also, play is capacity or power or ray like, from that arising, tone just.</prose>
[17929] <prose> Sprout from seed, and</prose>
[17930] <prose> Reflection arisen in mirror from face form like.</prose>
[17931] <prose> Ornament is ripening from that, grain portion just, seed, flower, and mark like.</prose>
[17932] <prose> That like also from Self-Arisen:</prose>
[17933] <prose> On completely pure primordial-pure appearance, non-awareness does not exist.</prose>
[17934] <prose> Mind does not exist,</prose>
[17935] <prose> Intellect does not exist, though,</prose>
[17936] <prose> From spontaneous presence power,</prose>
[17937] <prose> Non-awareness arises.</prose>
[17938] <prose> From play of non-awareness, mind arises,</prose>
[17939] <prose> From ornament of mind, intellect arises,</prose>
[17940] <prose> From object of intellect, five poisons arise,</prose>
[17941] <prose> From five poisons, sixteen afflictions arise,</prose>
[17942] <prose> From sixteen, twenty-five arise,</prose>
[17943] <prose> From that, fifty-one arise,</prose>
[17944] <prose> From that, eighty-four thousand arise—thus. || 40 ||</prose>
[17945] <prose> Second, extensively explained, three:</prose>
[17946] <list> Division of root ignorance,</list>
[17947] <list> Division of mind arisen from that,</list>
[17948] <list> Extensive explanation of division of afflictions arisen from that.</list>
[17949] <prose> First, again from that itself:</prose>
[17950] <prose> Ignorance is as follows:</prose>
[17951] <list> Root mind non-awareness, and</list>
[17952] <list> Object confusion non-awareness, and</list>
[17953] <list> Basis confusion-basis non-awareness, and</list>
[17954] <list> Thought grasping non-awareness, and</list>
[17955] <list> Path artificial non-awareness, and</list>
[17956] <list> Delusion not-knowing non-awareness,</list>
[17957] <prose> Thus ignorance arises as six forms, and self does not see own appearance—thus.</prose>
[17958] <prose> That also, by sequence:</prose>
[17959] <prose> First, from not knowing self-face of rigpa, delusion of confusing self as other,</prose>
[17960] <prose> Delusion of not knowing essence nature of appearing object without nature,</prose>
[17961] <prose> Delusion like confusing scarecrow as man from condition,</prose>
[17962] <prose> Delusion like house of self, though self not exist in rigpa essence, self as delusion in form,</prose>
[17963] <prose> Artificial like path, and</prose>
[17964] <prose> Delusion of not giving freedom though antidote becomes poison,</prose>
[17965] <prose> Delusion always in samsara from not knowing meaning of naturally light-clear.</prose>
[17966] <prose> Second, division of mind arisen from that:</prose>
[17967] <prose> From Self-Arisen:</prose>
[17968] <verse> "Division of mind is as follows:</verse>
[17969] <verse> Division of mind is as follows:</verse>
[17970] <verse> Mind like water gathering various, and</verse>

[17981] <prose> Those also, by sequence, by gathering various objects and latencies, water and</prose>
[17982] <prose> By deluded accept-reject, pig and</prose>
[17983] <prose> By coarse anger and pride, tiger and</prose>
[17984] <prose> By entering many objects, not decided as one focus, superimposition and</prose>
[17985] <prose> Without obstacle to moving, wind and</prose>
[17986] <prose> By desiring object, intoxicated mire and</prose>
[17987] <prose> Spreading conceptions from one to many, fire and</prose>
[17988] <prose> Desiring to accept object, bird and</prose>
[17989] <prose> By expanding knowledge power, examining meaning, branch and</prose>
[17990] <prose> By grasping awareness with object, gone into its power, actor and</prose>
[17991] <prose> Not giving direction to object knowledge, waver mad like mind.</prose>
[17992] <prose> These all also, by object and condition, gather as three minds: virtuous, non-virtuous, unspecified.</prose>
[17993] <prose> From mind, intellect arises—</prose>
[17994] <prose> Six of intellect searching all, etc.</prose>
[17995] <prose> Third, division of afflictions arisen from that, three:</prose>
[17996] <list> Six root afflictions,</list>
[17997] <list> Sixteen proximate afflictions,</list>
[17998] <list> Subtle-arisen clear limitless afflictions.</list>
[17999] <prose> First, from Sun-Moon Union:</prose>
[18000] <verse> "Afflictions are six:</verse>
[18001] <verse> Non-awareness thus called, grasping part of basis delusion-conception,</verse>

[18007] <prose> That also, by sequence:</prose>
[18008] <prose> Delusion of part of delusion-conception of object and subject,</prose>
[18009] <prose> Not-knowing just reverse from wisdom awareness,</prose>
[18010] <prose> Possessing part of hating object, and</prose>

[18031] <verse> Pride and</verse>
[18032] <verse> Spread—sixteen thus."</verse>
[18033] <prose> These all also, by sequence:</prose>
[18034] <prose> By not-knowing that alone, delusion making all affliction, and</prose>
[18035] <prose> Grasping mind on object, and</prose>
[18036] <prose> Grasping on subject, intellect, and</prose>
[18037] <prose> Grasping as self on both, and</prose>

[18050] <prose> Third, subtle-arisen clear limitless afflictions, three:</prose>
[18051] <list> Twenty-five,</list>
[18052] <list> Fifty-one,</list>
[18053] <list> Eighty-four thousand.</list>
[18054] <prose> First, because root non-awareness pervader exists, not counted separately,</prose>
[18055] <prose> By distinguishing five on five poisons pervaded, twenty-five.</prose>
[18056] <prose> From Self-Arisen:</prose>
[18057] <prose> On delusion, five:</prose>
[18058] <list> Very-dull delusion, and</list>
[18059] <list> Not-know delusion, and</list>

[18069] <prose> On anger also five:</prose>
[18070] <list> Desire much anger, and</list>
[18071] <list> Rage possessing anger, and</list>
[18072] <list> Very-coarse anger, and</list>
[18073] <list> Delusion possessing anger, and</list>
[18074] <list> Time thunder-rain like anger—five.</list>
[18075] <prose> On pride also five:</prose>
[18076] <list> Suppressing lion like pride, and</list>
[18077] <list> Above not-exist space like pride, and</list>
[18078] <list> Brave brave great tiger like pride, and</list>
[18079] <list> I-am think vulture like pride, and</list>
[18080] <list> Unequal equal elephant like pride—five.</list>
[18081] <prose> On jealousy also five:</prose>
[18082] <list> Subtle jealousy, and</list>
[18083] <list> I from arise jealousy, and</list>
[18084] <list> Very-harsh jealousy, and</list>
[18085] <list> Coarse jealousy, and</list>
[18086] <list> View jealousy—five.</list>
[18087] <prose> That is twenty-five afflictions—thus.</prose>
[18088] <prose> Second, fifty-one is that like: on twenty-five grasping object afflictions twenty-five,</prose>
[18089] <prose> Twenty-five grasping subject afflictions—fifty.</prose>
[18090] <prose> Root non-awareness and root one arise.</prose>
[18091] <prose> Third, eighty-four thousand:</prose>
[18092] <prose> Twenty-one thousand from desire,</prose>
[18093] <prose> Twenty-one thousand from anger,</prose>
[18094] <prose> Twenty-one thousand from delusion,</prose>
[18095] <prose> Twenty-one thousand from part equal,</prose>
[18096] <prose> Summed: thousand eight and four.</prose>
[18097] <prose> Though eighty-four thousand afflictions, if distinguished clearly limitless, measure not-exist, mind not-comprehend.</prose>
[18098] <prose> That also from Self-Arisen:</prose>
[18099] <verse> "From that, mind not-comprehend, speech not-utter,</verse>
[18100] <verse> Count impossible arise—thus."</verse>
[18101] <prose> These all also, mind and</prose>
[18102] <prose> Intellect and</prose>
[18103] <prose> Recollection and</prose>
[18104] <prose> Latency and</prose>
[18105] <prose> Doubt produce and arise from all, and by imprint of affliction influence, doing affliction of samsara, action-possessed.</prose>
[18106] <prose> From Sun-Moon Union:</prose>
[18107] <verse> "These etc. afflictions: mind holding following all thoughts, || 100 ||</verse>
[18108] <verse> Intellect holding following all recollections,</verse>
[18109] <verse> Interval connecting latencies,</verse>
[18110] <verse> Conception becoming basis of all doubt,</verse>
[18111] <verse> Object and thing grasping part etc. measure not-exist—thus."</verse>
[18112] <prose> That like, all karma and afflictions, because depending on mind and mental factors of three realms,</prose>
[18113] <prose> That also, eight groups of consciousness.</prose>
[18114] <prose> Basis-all consciousness, not thinking object, appearing cause become, consciousness without conception, clear, and</prose>
[18115] <prose> From that spreading, from five doors knowledge:</prose>
[18116] <prose> Eye consciousness grasping form without conception,</prose>
[18117] <prose> Ear consciousness grasping sound without conception,</prose>
[18118] <prose> Nose consciousness grasping smell without conception,</prose>
[18119] <prose> Tongue consciousness grasping taste without realization,</prose>
[18120] <prose> Body consciousness grasping touch without conception.</prose>
[18121] <prose> From that, two intellect-consciousness of grasp-holder:</prose>
[18122] <prose> First general grasp intellect-consciousness of object,</prose>
[18123] <prose> After particular grasp affliction-intellect,</prose>
[18124] <prose> Grasped and grasper.</prose>
[18125] <prose> On these two intellect-consciousnesses,</prose>
[18126] <prose> Virtuous, non-virtuous, unspecified three exist, and</prose>
[18127] <prose> Conception-possess, conception-not-exist, each suitable exist.</prose>
[18128] <prose> Five doors and basis-all consciousness are without conception.</prose>
[18129] <prose> Thus all mind and mental factors of three realms, fifty-one, are only superimposition as abandon object.</prose>
[18130] <prose> From Two Truths:</prose>
[18131] <verse> "Mind and mental factors of three realms,</verse>
[18132] <verse> Are superimposition form-possess conception. || 110 ||</verse>
[18133] <verse> Thus."</verse>
[18134] <prose> These are abandon objects,</prose>
[18135] <prose> Because they are nature of non-awareness.</prose>
[18136] <prose> Here, though great texts like Madhyamaka, desiring Buddha by making mind path,</prose>
[18137] <prose> Distinguishing mind and mind-itself as two, gathering nature of mind group eight or seven or six as abandon object,</prose>
[18138] <prose> Realizing mind-itself pure by nature as accept object, enter to cultivate path.</prose>
[18139] <prose> This also, part similar to that,</prose>
[18140] <prose> Awareness and mind-itself arisen from awareness, and</prose>
[18141] <prose> Mind grasping own characteristic—thus explained.</prose>
[18142] <prose> From the Six Expanses:</prose>
[18143] <tantra> "Hey, great mind-hero!</tantra>
[18144] <tantra> Mind-itself arisen from awareness and awareness is beyond all stains and conceptions,</tantra>
[18145] <tantra> In brief, all cause and fruit of nirvana,</tantra>
[18146] <tantra> Object-field of beings seeing self-appearance. || 120 ||</tantra>
[18147] <tantra> Mind grasping own characteristic is all superimposed appearances and</tantra>
[18148] <tantra> Exist appearances and</tantra>
[18149] <tantra> Not-exist appearances all and</tantra>
[18150] <tantra> Appearance and</tantra>
[18151] <tantra> Renown and</tantra>
[18152] <tantra> View and</tantra>
[18153] <tantra> Meditation and</tantra>
[18154] <tantra> Conduct appearances all and</tantra>
[18155] <tantra> Grasp and</tantra>
[18156] <tantra> Conception and</tantra>
[18157] <tantra> Afflictions,</tantra>
[18158] <tantra> All appearing as thought objects.</tantra>
[18159] <tantra> In brief, all samsara dharmas are mind grasping own characteristic,</tantra>
[18160] <tantra> All appearances of self-same of six classes of beings—thus spoken."</tantra>
[18161] <prose> Then, if asked if these two are same,</prose>
[18162] <prose> Difference is great:</prose>
[18163] <prose> Whatever view-meditation-conduct done by common vehicle, cannot transcend from mind,</prose>
[18164] <prose> Here mind unmixed, direct awareness, more superior, etc. many.</prose>
[18165] <prose> Fourth, on each meaning: basis of mind, and</prose>
[18166] <prose> Abode, and</prose>
[18167] <prose> Path, and</prose>
[18168] <prose> Door, and</prose>
[18169] <prose> Essence, and</prose>
[18170] <prose> Power, and</prose>
[18171] <prose> Action, and</prose>
[18172] <prose> Fruit—from eight:</prose>
[18173] <prose> Basis is form aggregate, upper-torso, chest.</prose>
[18174] <prose> Abode is from heart connecting to lung interval, in navel aorta tube just, on wind horse, awareness tone rides, abides.</prose>
[18175] <prose> Wind is like horse, blind, leg-possess.</prose>
[18176] <prose> Awareness tone is like person not spread, eye-possess.</prose>
[18177] <prose> If those two not mixed as one, not move, nine-move, conception not arise,</prose>
[18178] <prose> Because tone awareness abides as self,</prose>
[18179] <prose> Though object appears, not thinking on that, knowledge clear dawn, half arise,</prose>
[18180] <prose> By wind essential point,</prose>
[18181] <prose> Continuum mark of distinguishing wind and awareness is that.</prose>
[18182] <prose> By mixing those two, conception not clear, nine-clear arise.</prose>
[18183] <prose> Move part is wind,</prose>
[18184] <prose> Awareness part is awareness tone.</prose>
[18185] <prose> That also, awareness thing inside heart like water,</prose>
[18186] <prose> From that power tone entered navel channel, mixed with wind, that mind like water bubble,</prose>
[18187] <prose> That mind is awareness channel-path tone.</prose>
[18188] <prose> That also, mind follows awareness exist not-exist,</prose>
[18189] <prose> Awareness does not follow go-return mind exist not-exist,</prose>
[18190] <prose> In essence, awareness not become in mind's power, and</prose>
[18191] <prose> Because power, mind become in awareness's power,</prose>
[18192] <prose> If awareness moves, mind conception impossible,</prose>
[18193] <prose> Like if water not move, wave arise impossible.</prose>
[18194] <prose> From Self-Arisen:</prose>
[18195] <verse> "Example of mind and awareness is water and bubble manner,</verse>
[18196] <verse> Because not become in mind's power—thus."</verse>
[18197] <prose> Path is moving from life-channel,</prose>
[18198] <prose> Because from that mind horse life-wind moves.</prose>
[18199] <prose> Door is</prose>
[18200] <prose> Mouth and nose two, because wind exits from there as door.</prose>
[18201] <prose> Essence is grasp-holder nature of samsara.</prose>
[18202] <prose> Power is grasping object and clinging I-self.</prose>
[18203] <prose> Action is doing various pleasure-pain of samsara.</prose>
[18204] <prose> Fruit is samsara and lower-realm without end.</prose>
[18205] <prose> That word also from Self-Arisen:</prose>
[18206] <verse> "Impure nature is</verse>
[18207] <verse> On self-continuum of all beings,</verse>
[18208] <verse> Impure three-layer abides.</verse>
