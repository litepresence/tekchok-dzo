[997] Second: the gods holding flower garlands. These divine beings dwell within the Thal-ba fields, celestial realms of unimaginable splendor situated above the great snow-mountain Meru, the axis mundi that supports the Sahā World. In these exalted realms, the gods, known as 'Thal-ba, Holding Flower Garlands,' continuously grasp exquisite celestial blossoms of divine fragrance and radiant beauty.

<tantra>As proclaimed in the root tantra of the Great Perfection, these gods possess bodies of light adorned with ornaments of five-colored rays. They hold in their hands flower-garlands formed from mandāra blossoms, parijata flowers, and countless other divine species that never fade, never wither, but eternally radiate fragrance and light.</tantra>

<list>
• The mandāra flower-garlands, white as moonlight and fragrant as the nectar of immortality
• The parijata blossoms, crimson as sunset clouds and possessing the power to fulfill all wishes
• The celestial lotuses, blue as sapphires, rising from golden lakes to the level of the gods' knees
• The unsought-for flowers, spontaneously arisen from the ground of precious substances
</list>

These gods experience joy through the offering of flowers to the victorious ones and their noble assemblies. Their hands are never empty of garlands, for the trees in their realm spontaneously produce blossoms of every hue and fragrance. They weave these into offerings of inconceivable beauty, creating mandalas of light and scent that pervade the entire Thal-ba realm.

<tantra>The tantra declares: 'In the Thal-ba fields above Jambudvīpa, the gods holding flower-garlands sport and play, surrounded by groves of wish-fulfilling trees, their bodies adorned with light-rays emanating from the blossoms they bear.'</tantra>

The ground of their realm is of gold, sprinkled with sandalwood water, covered to the knee-level by the fallen petals of divine flowers. Palaces of jewel surround them, pleasure-groves delight their senses, and lakes filled with lotuses equal in beauty to the water itself provide their playgrounds.

These gods, though still within the desire realm, possess merit accumulated through countless eons of virtuous action. Their holding of flower-garlands represents the cultivation of offering, the paramita of generosity expressed through the medium of celestial flowers. Through this practice, they accumulate vast stores of merit, preparing the ground for future attainment of the paths and bhumis of enlightenment.

Thus, the second tier of the Thal-ba fields: the gods holding flower-garlands, perpetually engaged in the joyous activity of divine offering, dwelling in splendor beyond the conception of ordinary beings of Jambudvīpa.
