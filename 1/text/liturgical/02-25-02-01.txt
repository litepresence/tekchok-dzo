[16329] <prose> First, there are three aspects:
[16330] <prose> The general presentation of the manner of attainment,
[16331] <prose> The detailed explanation that it is the result,
[16332] <prose> The explanation of the path as appearance and the avoidance of contradiction.
[16333] <ornament> First:
[16334] <tantra> From the arising-basis of essence, though appearing as the Three Bodies,
[16335] <prose> The demonstration of attainment by the power of purifying stains of the three gates to be purified—
[16336] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[16337] <prose> Furthermore, the sequence of the result:
[16338] <prose> The Dharmakāya is attained by the action of mind, and || 10 ||
[16339] <prose> The Saṃbhogakāya is attained by the aspect of speech;
[16340] <prose> The Emanation Body is by the body.
[16341] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[16342] <prose> These are called the cause-effect to be purified.
[16343] <prose> By nature it is spontaneous presence; therefore understand that it is impossible to attain by producing through cause and condition.
[16344] <ornament> Second:
[16345] <tantra> From the Pearl-Garland:
[16346] <prose> The result—Three Bodies, five wisdoms—
[16347] <prose> Thus it is spoken, and
[16348] <tantra> From Vajrasattva's mind-mirror: || 20 ||
[16349] <prose> All dharmatā of the result, the Three Bodies irreversible—know this.
[16350] <ornament> Third:
[16351] <ornament> If asked regarding contradiction with explaining the Three Bodies as path-appearance:
[16352] <prose> Former lamas say,
[16353] <prose> Saying "it is not the result"
[16354] <prose> Refers to freeing from the extreme of attachment to the Three Bodies as result, or
[16355] <prose> Refers to refuting those who consider the three cycles' womb as ultimate; thus avoiding contradiction,
[16356] <prose> Yet placing it as result in meaning
[16357] <prose> Is the display of not considering the essence of primordial purity's inner expanse; therefore very mistaken—not good.
[16358] <prose> Here, as accepted before, path-appearance is also, || 30 ||
[16359] <prose> And it is also the result—without contradiction.
