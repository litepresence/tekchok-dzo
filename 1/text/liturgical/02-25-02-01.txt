[16329] First, there are three aspects:
[16330] The general presentation of the manner of attainment,
[16331] The detailed explanation that it is the result,
[16332] The explanation of the path as appearance and the avoidance of contradiction.
[16333] First:
[16334] From the arising-basis of essence, though appearing as the Three Bodies,
[16335] The demonstration of attainment by the power of purifying stains of the three gates to be purified—
[16336] From the Thalgyur:
[16337] Furthermore, the sequence of the result:
[16338] The Dharmakāya is attained by the action of mind, and || 10 ||
[16339] The Saṃbhogakāya is attained by the aspect of speech;
[16340] The Emanation Body is by the body.
[16341] Thus it is spoken.
[16342] These are called the cause-effect to be purified.
[16343] By nature it is spontaneous presence; therefore understand that it is impossible to attain by producing through cause and condition.
[16344] Second:
[16345] From the Pearl-Garland:
[16346] The result—Three Bodies, five wisdoms—
[16347] Thus it is spoken, and
[16348] From Vajrasattva's mind-mirror: || 20 ||
[16349] All dharmatā of the result, the Three Bodies irreversible—know this.
[16350] Third:
[16351] If asked regarding contradiction with explaining the Three Bodies as path-appearance:
[16352] Former lamas say,
[16353] Saying "it is not the result"
[16354] Refers to freeing from the extreme of attachment to the Three Bodies as result, or
[16355] Refers to refuting those who consider the three cycles' womb as ultimate; thus avoiding contradiction,
[16356] Yet placing it as result in meaning
[16357] Is the display of not considering the essence of primordial purity's inner expanse; therefore very mistaken—not good.
[16358] Here, as accepted before, path-appearance is also, || 30 ||
[16359] And it is also the result—without contradiction.
