[16329] The first: three aspects:
[16330] General presentation of attainment manner,
[16331] Detailed explanation that it is fruition,
[16332] Resolution of apparent contradictions with path-appearance explanations.
[16333] The first:
[16334] Though from the manifestation-basis of essence arise the three kāyas,
[16335] It is shown that through the power of purifying the three doors' stains, these are attained.
[16336] From Thalgyur:
[16337] "Furthermore, regarding fruition's sequence:
[16338] Dharmakāya through mind's activity,
[16339] Saṃbhogakāya attained through speech,
[16340] Emanation-kāya through body."
[16341] Thus it is spoken.
[16342] These are called "purification's cause and result."
[16343] One should understand that since spontaneous presence is the nature, attainment produced by causes and conditions is impossible.
[16344] The second:
[16345] From Pearl Garland:
[16346] "Fruition: three kāyas, five wisdoms."
[16347] Thus spoken, and
[16348] From Vajrasattva's Heart Mirror:
[16349] "Know that all fruition phenomena are three kāyas, irreversible." Thus it is spoken.
[16350] The third:
[16351] If asked whether explaining the three kāyas as path-appearance contradicts,
[16352] Some early masters claim:
[16353] "That it is not fruition" is intended to separate from extreme attachment to fruition as three kāyas, or
[16354] It is intended to refute considering the three cycles as ultimate treasury—thus resolving the contradiction,
[16355] And positing it as fruition actually
[16356] Is a distortion not understanding the essence of primordially pure inner Expanse—extremely mistaken, not good.
[16357] Here, as previously accepted, it is both path-appearance
[16358] And also fruition—without contradiction
[16359]
