[16329] The first: three aspects:
<list> [16330] General presentation of attainment manner;
<list> [16331] Detailed explanation that it is fruition;
<list> [16332] Resolution of apparent contradictions with path-appearance explanations.

[16333] The first:
[16334] Though from the manifestation-basis of essence arise the three kāyas,
[16335] It is shown that through the power of purifying the three doors' obscurations, these are attained.

<tantra> [16336] From Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16337] "Moreover, regarding fruition's sequence:
<tantra> [16338] Dharma-kāya through mind's activity,
<tantra> [16339] Saṃbhoga-kāya attained through speech,
<tantra> [16340] Emanation-kāya through body."
<tantra> [16341] Thus it is spoken.

[16342] These are called "purification's cause and result."
[16343] One should understand that since spontaneous presence is the nature, attainment produced by causes and conditions is impossible.

[16344] The second:

<tantra> [16345] From Pearl Garland:
<tantra> [16346] "Fruition: three kāyas, five wisdoms."

<tantra> [16347] From Vajrasattva's Mind-Mirror:
<tantra> [16348] "Know that all fruition phenomena are three kāyas, irreversible." Thus it is spoken.

[16349] The third:
[16350] If it is asked whether explaining the three kāyas as path-appearance contradicts,

[16351] Some early masters claim:
[16352] "That it is not fruition is intended to separate from extreme attachment to fruition as three kāyas," or
[16353] It is intended to refute considering the three cycles as ultimate treasury—thus resolving the contradiction.

[16354] However, positing it as fruition actually
[16355] Is a distortion not understanding the essence of primordially pure inner Expanse—extremely mistaken and incorrect.

[16356] Here, as previously accepted, it is both path-appearance
[16357] And fruition—without contradiction.

[16358] The first is path-appearance, for from the great treasury of primordial purity, spontaneous presence's treasury—the meaningful fruition like a house—
[16359] One must enter there and then emerge again; from primordial purity, one must manifest as external display.

[16360] The manner of manifestation arises from essence abiding as kāya.

[16361] Path-appearance has two types:
<list> [16362] The path of making oneself a Buddha, preceding fruition;
<list> [16363] The path of guiding those to be trained, having made oneself a Buddha, kāyas manifesting for benefit.

[16364] From these, here it is considered path-appearance of no-more-learning—thus establishing the connection between two non-contradictory kāyas: three kāyas as path-appearance and as fruition.

[16365] The liberated Dharma-kāya's three kāyas manifesting externally as path from the inner Expanse—these kāyas and wisdoms' emanation-appearances—
[16366] Dharma-kāya as wisdom's mind,
[16367] Saṃbhoga-kāya as that kāya,
[16368] Emanation-kāya appearing as deeds—thus benefit arises.

[16369] Moreover, the inner clear manifestation-basis of kāyas and wisdoms without gathering or separation, and Vajrasattva's Dharmatā,
[16370] And from that, the externally clear three kāyas' path-appearance manifesting as external clarity, though similar in awareness's state,
[16371] External and internal distinction is distinguished;
[16372] From self-appearance's aspect, for those to be trained's appearance-perception, saṃbhoga and emanation manifest for benefit.
[16373] Though a single awareness-display,
[16374] Self-appearance is not seen by those to be trained,
[16375] Yet that which manifests from it is seen—thus the distinction between the two similars is shown.

<tantra> [16376] From Lion's Perfect Power:
<tantra> [16377] "Vajrasattva's Dharmatā and
<tantra> [16378] Self-appearance's pure maṇḍala—two,
<tantra> [16379] Similar-basis, yet great divergence."
<tantra> [16380] Thus it is explained.

[16381] Thus inner Expanse and
[16382] External clear path-appearance aspect, without division,
[16383] If three kāyas are considered self-appearance's fruition,
[16384] Emanation-kāya appears to those to be trained like a reflection,
[16385] So liberation-ground's primordially pure Dharma-kāya would appear to those to be trained,
[16386] For three kāyas are of single essence.

[16387] Dharma-kāya would appear as radiance-gathering and color,
[16388] For saṃbhoga and emanation of the same essence as you appear.
[16389] Or else, emanation-kāya would not appear to those to be trained,
[16390] For Dharma-kāya does not appear.

[16391] Therefore, though three kāyas are known as single essence,
[16392] That single-essence variety is not to be adopted;
[16393] Emanation-kāya is compassion-aspect,
[16394] Yet its emanated appearance is merely reflected emanation,
[16395] Not true emanation-kāya,
[16396] For it is not compassion.

[16397] This distinction of philosophical systems is extremely subtle; intelligent ones should investigate and understand.
[16398] These are crucial essential points.

[16399] The second, explanation of the topic at hand, comprises three aspects:
<list> [16400] General presentation of three kāyas' fields;
<list> [16401] Detailed explanation of wisdoms' fields;
<list> [16402] Summary of body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities' five fields.

[16403] The first: from Dharma-kāya,
[16404] Saṃbhoga-kāya,
[16405] Emanation-kāya—
