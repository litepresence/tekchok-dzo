[10095] Supremely mantra in entered to,
[10096] Harm do one's mind done if,
[10097] Above's suffering experience become.
[10098] Thus.
[10099] Outer's inner guru and brother-sister to harm-mind abandoning is.



[10100] Sky-iron fire blazing one's tantra from,
[10101] If being common to,
[10102] Object become harm's mind arise if,
[10103] Migrate world common body having,
[10104] Hundred three of life cut,
[10105] This one's sin's share equal,
[10106] If teaching's sign hold one's,
[10107] Form ones to wrong become,
[10108] Mantra in entered hundred-times become.
[10109] Vajra's sibling seven-times,

[10111] Root's guru that one's hundred.
[10112] Mantra's door entered empowerment obtained,
[10113] Supremely aspect-ripen thus.
[10114] Thus.
[10115] Outer's secret self-other's established-view to wrong-view arise abandoning is.
[10116] Arrangement great from,
[10117] Self or other's hidden one's,
[10118] Dharma to disparage wrong one's path,
[10119] Root's samaya from exceed after,
[10120] Earth-dwell fire's suffering to,
[10121] Long time for dwell one's,
[10122] Self's established-view wrong-view arise,
[10123] Hell itself from liberate chance not.
[10124] Thus.
[10125] Mind's inner's outer conduct and
[10126] Inner meditate and
[10127] Secret view wrong abandoning is.
[10128] Crystal's house stacked one's tantra from,
[10129] View and meditate and conduct wrong,
[10130] This path wrong great is.
[10131] Being all's suffering whatever,
[10132] This one's mind in ripen certain.
[10133] Thus.
[10134] Secret's three's outer view meditate conduct,
[10135] Inner yi-dam's deity,
[10136] Secret guru and brother-sister day-night in mind in done is.
[10137] Lotus klong one's tantra from,
[10138] Who mind's karma wander and,
[10139] Mind in do one's dharmas to,
[10140] Mind in not-done degenerate and,
[10141] Past and ceased one's karma's end,
[10142] Uninterrupted suffering experience one's.
[10143] Thus and
[10144] Co-arise near take one's tantra from,
[10145] Actual-accomplish supreme desire,
[10146] Yi-dam abandon not-do and,
[10147] Guru abandon if actual-accomplish destroy.
[10148] Other where accomplish also not-find.
[10149] Therefore dharma for promise taken and,
[10150] Guru's before samaya pledged one's,
[10151] Mind in thought one's virtue's karma,
[10152] That self abandon if actual-accomplish degenerate.
[10153] Thus and
[10154] 



[10155] From the Tantra of the Supreme Trunk of Samaya Arrangements:
[10156] Promises must not be transgressed,
[10157] The guru's commitments must not be broken.
[10158] The guru's activities must not be wrong,
[10159] One's body, speech, and mind—all
[10160] Must not stray from Dharma.
[10161] Acting for the benefit of all beings,
[10162] Always respecting the guru,
[10163] Not transgressing supreme samaya.
[10164] Holding vajra and bell,
[10165] Holding substances suitable for mantra.
[10166] Generally, from root samaya:
[10167] What should be secret and entrusted,
[10168] Secret promises and pledges,
[10169] If wrong conduct with speech or mind,
[10170] This too will increase the uninterrupted continuum.
[10171] Distinctive Dharma arising from empowerment
[10172] Must not be revealed to others; join with mind.
[10173] The guru's mind—if harmed
[10174] By body, speech, or mind,
[10175] Wrong deeds must not be done.
[10176] Similarly, toward vajra siblings
[10177] Harm and injury must not be done.
[10178] Thus.
[10179] Thus, guarding the twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, and mind distinctions is the distinctive Dharma here.
[10180] Furthermore, from Consequence:
[10181] Furthermore, samaya and discipline explained:
[10182] The guru is the basis of Buddha worship,
[10183] Dharma and Sangha, yi-dam deity,
[10184] Vajra sky-goers—to these
[10185] Gathering and worship must not cease.
[10186] Seeing a guru with proper characteristics,
[10187] Praise and worship should be complete.
[10188] Do not disparage women, do not be angry.
[10189] Do not disparage aggregates; rely on yi-dam.
[10190] Mandala, mantra, and deity,
[10191] Mudra reliance is indeed proper.
[10192] Do not break the faithful gathering,
[10193] Do not disturb the virtuous mind.
[10194] The discipline-possessed should dwell in samaya.
[10195] Furthermore, the training sequence:
[10196] Complete bodily conduct,
[10197] Speech must be strictly restrained.
[10198] Mind dwells, examines, and analyzes.
[10199] Enter sequence, do karma sequence.
[10200] Always hand and pill karma,
[10201] Place all channels in the drop-net.
[10202] Garland and necklace, even half,
[10203] Beautifully conduct the wheel.
[10204] Take the chief of supreme attainments,
[10205] Do with the wheel of six place-ornaments.
[10206] All these, without transgression or degeneration, must be earnestly done.
[10207] If these are exceeded, faults are measureless.
[10208] From the Tantra of the Jewel-Stacked Wheel:



[10209] If body samaya is transgressed,
[10210] One is separated from the word called Buddha-body.
[10211] Thus, all beings of the three realms—
[10212] Compared to cutting life at one time,
[10213] By defeat, sin is limitless.
[10214] Similarly, if speech ceases,
[10215] Buddha-speech's word does not dwell.
[10216] Of all beings of the three realms,
[10217] The tongue faculty at one time
[10218] Cut—by this sin is limitless.
[10219] If mind degenerates,
[10220] Filling the three realms with meditators,
[10221] Virtuous monks dwelling in virtue,
[10222] At one time disturbing mind, expelling mind—
[10223] By this, sin increases more.
[10224] Thus.
[10225] Especially, degenerate fall from relying on the guru is heavy.
[10226] From the Glorious Sky-Not-Exhausted Tantra:
[10227] If without bad mind,
[10228] By degenerate mindfulness in dream,
[10229] Or non-virtues becoming careless,
[10230] Confess aimed at the guru.
[10231] Bodily fault by body,
[10232] Thus speech and mind also.
[10233] If not confessed immediately,
[10234] By this too, experience uninterrupted suffering.
[10235] Thus.
[10236] The guru is the nature of all Buddhas,
[10237] Teaching to liberate from samsara by supreme Dharma at this time, therefore the object is fierce.
[10238] Accomplish as spoken,
[10239] Abandoning non-faith,
[10240] Wrong mind,
[10241] Harm,
[10242] And speaking, etc.
[10243] From the mouth of the great master Joy Vajra:
[10244] The supreme guru commanded:
[10245] If knowing the flaw of faults,
[10246] Do as spoken.
[10247] Thus, toward the guru's activity,
[10248] Even if body's suffering becomes supreme,
[10249] By one's own ability, make effort to do.
[10250] The guru's mind, even for a moment,
[10251] Must not be disturbed.
[10252] Toward the guru's food and wealth,
[10253] As one cherishes one's own life,
[10254] The yogi must always act.
[10255] If in the guru's realm,
[10256] Teaching Dharma, empowerment, consecration,
[10257] And all meditations to be done,
[10258] Must not be done without subsequent permission.
[10259] Briefly, by body, speech, and mind,
[10260] Whatever deed's aspect is done,
[10261] Without asking the guru, without permission,
[10262] Even a little must not be done.
[10263] Furthermore, whatever virtuous karma,
[10264] Begin by asking the guru.
[10265] In all yogic conduct,
[10266] Must not separate from the supreme guru.
[10267] Whenever eating food of the three times,
[10268] With first portions cut in three parts,
[10269] Must offer to the supreme guru.
[10270] By wealth and rare jewels,
[10271] To the guru, vajra holder,
[10272] Without desire, offer portions.
[10273] With first portions of whatever and whatever,
[10274] Dedicate and offer to the supreme guru.
[10275] Briefly, all of one's mind,
[10276] Pure aspect, without pretense,
[10277] Aim toward the guru's portion.
[10278] All good qualities will be accomplished.
[10279] Thus.
[10280] Purpose is from Consequence:



[10281] Guru rely circle stream stop.
[10282] Empowerment rely body speech ripen.
[10283] Samaya rely actual-accomplish arise.
[10284] View rely realm three cease.
[10285] Meditate rely delusion stop.
[10286] Conduct rely body purified become.
[10287] Rely this from whatever arise.
[10288] This self samaya discipline's.
[10289] Thus.
[10290] That also samaya's sequence from exceed if restore's ritual to effort and,
[10291] Respective's cross-degenerate's distinction know confess do.
[10292] Nature's cross-degenerate is explained ones in,

[10294] Time long to gone and heavy to gone,
[10295] Degenerate's contradict,

[10300] Samaya degenerate's fault day gap not samaya from contradict called.
[10301] Month gap not is degenerate.
[10302] Year gap not is crossed.
[10303] Year two and three gone is loose.
[10304] That to respective's restore method also know restore do.
[10305] Vajra sun samaya arranged one's tantra from,

[10329] Loose self's life restore.
[10330] That from again become if,
[10331] Degenerate great called.
[10332] Restore able not.
