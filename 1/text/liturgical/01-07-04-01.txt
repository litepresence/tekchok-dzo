[10153] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
[10154] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
[10155] <prose> <tantra> From the Tantra of the Supreme Trunk of Samaya Arrangements: || 70 ||
[10156] <prose> <tantra> "Promises must not be transgressed;
[10157] <prose> <tantra> The guru's commitments must not be broken.
[10158] <prose> <tantra> The guru's activities must not be wrong;
[10159] <prose> <tantra> One's body, speech, and mind—all

[10171] <prose> <tantra> Distinctive Dharma arising from empowerment
[10172] <prose> <tantra> Must not be revealed to others; join with mind.
[10173] <prose> <tantra> The guru's mind—if harmed

[10175] <prose> <tantra> Wrong deeds must not be done. || 90 ||
[10176] <prose> <tantra> Similarly, toward vajra siblings
[10177] <prose> <tantra> Harm and injury must not be done."
[10178] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10179] <prose> Thus, guarding the twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, and mind distinctions is the distinctive Dharma here.
[10180] <prose> <tantra> Furthermore, from the Consequence:
[10181] <prose> <tantra> "Furthermore, samaya and discipline explained:
[10182] <prose> <tantra> The guru is the basis of Buddha worship,

[10188] <prose> <tantra> Do not disparage women, do not be angry.
[10189] <prose> <tantra> Do not disparage aggregates; rely on yi-dam.
[10190] <prose> <tantra> Mandala, mantra, and deity,
[10191] <prose> <tantra> Mudra reliance is indeed proper.
[10192] <prose> <tantra> Do not break the faithful gathering,

[10206] <prose> <tantra> All these, without transgression or degeneration, must be earnestly done.
[10207] <prose> <tantra> If these are exceeded, faults are measureless."
[10208] <prose> <tantra> From the Tantra of the Jewel-Stacked Wheel:
[10209] <prose> <tantra> "If body samaya is transgressed,
[10210] <prose> <tantra> One is separated from the word called Buddha-body.
[10211] <prose> <tantra> Thus, all beings of the three realms—
[10212] <prose> <tantra> Compared to cutting life at one time,
[10213] <prose> <tantra> By defeat, sin is limitless.
[10214] <prose> <tantra> Similarly, if speech ceases,
[10215] <prose> <tantra> Buddha-speech's word does not dwell. || 130 ||
[10216] <prose> <tantra> Of all beings of the three realms,

[10219] <prose> <tantra> If mind degenerates,

[10222] <prose> <tantra> At one time disturbing mind, expelling mind—
[10223] <prose> <tantra> By this, sin increases more."
[10224] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10225] <prose> Especially, degenerate fall from relying on the guru is heavy. || 140 ||
[10226] <prose> <tantra> From the Glorious Sky-Not-Exhausted Tantra:
[10227] <prose> <tantra> "If without bad mind,

[10229] <prose> <tantra> Or non-virtues becoming careless,
[10230] <prose> <tantra> Confess aimed at the guru.
[10231] <prose> <tantra> Bodily fault by body,
[10232] <prose> <tantra> Thus speech and mind also.
[10233] <prose> <tantra> If not confessed immediately,
[10234] <prose> <tantra> By this too, experience uninterrupted suffering."
[10235] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 150 ||
[10236] <prose> <tantra> Moreover, the guru is the nature of all Buddhas,
[10237] <prose> <tantra> Teaching to liberate from saṃsāra by supreme Dharma at this time; therefore the object is fierce.

[10241] <prose> <tantra> Harm,
[10242] <prose> <tantra> And speaking, etc.
[10243] <prose> <tantra> From the mouth of the great master Joy Vajra:
[10244] <prose> <tantra> "The supreme guru commanded:
[10245] <prose> <tantra> If knowing the flaw of faults, || 160 ||
[10246] <prose> <tantra> Do as spoken.
[10247] <prose> <tantra> Thus, toward the guru's activity,
[10248] <prose> <tantra> Even if body's suffering becomes supreme,
[10249] <prose> <tantra> By one's own ability, make effort to do.
[10250] <prose> <tantra> The guru's mind, even for a moment,
[10251] <prose> <tantra> Must not be disturbed.
[10252] <prose> <tantra> Toward the guru's food and wealth,
[10253] <prose> <tantra> As one cherishes one's own life,
[10254] <prose> <tantra> The yogi must always act.

[10259] <prose> <tantra> Briefly, by body, speech, and mind,
[10260] <prose> <tantra> Whatever deed's aspect is done,
[10261] <prose> <tantra> Without asking the guru, without permission,
[10262] <prose> <tantra> Even a little must not be done.
[10263] <prose> <tantra> Furthermore, whatever virtuous karma,
[10264] <prose> <tantra> Begin by asking the guru.
[10265] <prose> <tantra> In all yogic conduct, || 180 ||
[10266] <prose> <tantra> Must not separate from the supreme guru.
[10267] <prose> <tantra> Whenever eating food of the three times,
[10268] <prose> <tantra> With first portions cut in three parts,
[10269] <prose> <tantra> Must offer to the supreme guru.
[10270] <prose> <tantra> By wealth and rare jewels,
