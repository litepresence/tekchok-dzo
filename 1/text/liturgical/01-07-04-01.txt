[10086] First: outer's outer—harmful mind abandoning is.
<tantra> From the Essence Meaning Aspect-Taken Tantra:
<tantra> "Whoever mantra-holder vajra holder,
<tantra> Being other or self also suffice—
<tantra> Harm-doing mind hold if,
<tantra> This leprosy-possessed body,
<tantra> Cold touch possessing one,
<tantra> Body thousand-times five taken after,
<tantra> Cold hell in certain becomes."
<tantra> "Supremely mantra in entered to, || 10 ||
<tantra> Harm-doing mind done if,
<tantra> Above's suffering experience becomes."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10099] Outer's inner: guru and vajra siblings harmful mind abandoning is.
<tantra> From the Sky-Iron Fire Blazing Tantra:
<tantra> "If being common to,
<tantra> Object become harm's mind arise if—
<tantra> Migrate world common body possessing,
<tantra> Hundred three of life cut,
<tantra> This one's sin's share equal. || 20 ||
<tantra> If teaching's sign hold one's
<tantra> Form ones to wrong become,
<tantra> Mantra in entered hundred-times becomes.
<tantra> Vajra's sibling seven-times,
<tantra> Lineage's guru hundred-times,
<tantra> Root's guru that one's hundred.
<tantra> Mantra's door entered empowerment obtained,
<tantra> Supremely aspect-ripen thus."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10115] Outer's secret: self-other's established-view wrong-view arise abandoning is. || 30 ||
<tantra> From the Great Arrangement:
<tantra> "Self or other's hidden one's
<tantra> Dharma disparage, wrong one's path—
<tantra> Root's samaya from exceed after,
<tantra> Earth-dwell fire's suffering to,
<tantra> Long time for dwell one,
<tantra> Self's established-view wrong-view arise,
<tantra> Hell itself from liberate chance not."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10125] Mind's inner's outer: conduct, and || 40 ||
Inner: meditate, and
Secret: wrong view abandoning is.
<tantra> From the Crystal House Stacked Tantra:
<tantra> "View and meditate and conduct wrong—
<tantra> This path wrong great is.
<tantra> Being all's suffering whatever,
<tantra> This one's mind in ripen certain."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10134] Secret's three's outer: view meditate conduct,
Inner: yi-dam's deity, || 50 ||
Secret: guru and vajra siblings day-night in mind done is.
<tantra> From the Lotus Klong Tantra:
<tantra> "Who mind's karma wander, and
<tantra> Mind done dharmas to,
<tantra> Mind not-done recognized, and
<tantra> Past and ceased one's karma's end,
<tantra> Uninterrupted suffering experience one."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
<tantra> From the Co-Arisen Near-Taken Tantra:
<tantra> "Actual-accomplish supreme desire, || 60 ||
<tantra> Yi-dam abandon not-do, and
<tantra> Guru abandon if actual-accomplish destroyed.
<tantra> Other where accomplish also not-find.
<tantra> Therefore Dharma for promise taken, and
<tantra> Guru's before samaya pledged one's
<tantra> Mind thought one's virtue's karma—
<tantra> That self abandon if actual-accomplish recognizes."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
<tantra> Thus it is spoken, and
<tantra> From the Tantra of the Supreme Trunk of Samaya Arrangements: || 70 ||
<tantra> "Promises must not be transgressed;
<tantra> The guru's commitments must not be broken.
<tantra> The guru's activities must not be wrong;
<tantra> One's body, speech, and mind—all
<tantra> Must not stray from Dharma.
<tantra> Acting for the benefit of all beings,
<tantra> Always respecting the guru,
<tantra> Not transgressing supreme samaya.
<tantra> Holding vajra and bell,
<tantra> Holding substances suitable for mantra. || 80 ||
<tantra> Generally, from root samaya:
<tantra> What should be secret and entrusted,
<tantra> Secret promises and pledges—
<tantra> If wrong conduct with speech or mind,
<tantra> This too will increase the uninterrupted continuum.
<tantra> Distinctive Dharma arising from empowerment
<tantra> Must not be revealed to others; join with mind.
<tantra> The guru's mind—if harmed
<tantra> By body, speech, or mind—
<tantra> Wrong deeds must not be done. || 90 ||
<tantra> Similarly, toward vajra siblings
<tantra> Harm and injury must not be done."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10179] Thus, guarding the twenty-seven samayas of body, speech, and mind distinctions is the distinctive Dharma here.
[10180] <tantra> Furthermore, from the Consequence:
<tantra> "Furthermore, samaya and discipline explained:
<tantra> The guru is the basis of Buddha worship,
<tantra> Dharma and Sangha, yi-dam deity,
<tantra> Vajra sky-goers—to these
<tantra> Gathering and worship must not cease. || 100 ||
<tantra> Seeing a guru with proper characteristics,
<tantra> Praise and worship should be complete.
<tantra> Do not disparage women, do not be angry.
<tantra> Do not disparage aggregates; rely on yi-dam.
<tantra> Mandala, mantra, and deity,
<tantra> Mudra reliance is indeed proper.
<tantra> Do not break the faithful gathering,
<tantra> Do not disturb the virtuous mind.
<tantra> The discipline-possessed should dwell in samaya.
<tantra> Furthermore, the training sequence: || 110 ||
<tantra> Complete bodily conduct,
<tantra> Speech must be strictly restrained.
<tantra> Mind dwells, examines, and analyzes.
<tantra> Enter sequence, do karma sequence.
<tantra> Always hand and pill karma,
<tantra> Place all channels in the drop-net.
<tantra> Garland and necklace, even half,
<tantra> Beautifully conduct the wheel.
<tantra> Take the chief of supreme attainments,
<tantra> Do with the wheel of six place-ornaments. || 120 ||
<tantra> All these, without transgression or recognition, must be spontaneously expressed.
<tantra> If these are exceeded, faults are measureless."
<tantra> From the Tantra of the Jewel-Stacked Wheel:
<tantra> "If body samaya is transgressed,
<tantra> One is separated from the word called Buddha-body.
<tantra> Thus, all beings of the three realms—
<tantra> Compared to cutting life at one time,
<tantra> By defeat, sin is limitless.
<tantra> Similarly, if speech ceases,
<tantra> Buddha-speech's word does not dwell. || 130 ||
<tantra> Of all beings of the three realms,
<tantra> The tongue faculty at one time
<tantra> Cut—by this sin is limitless.
<tantra> If mind recognizes,
<tantra> Filling the three realms with meditators,
<tantra> Virtuous monks dwelling in virtue,
<tantra> At one time disturbing mind, expelling mind—
<tantra> By this, sin increases more."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10225] Especially, recognized fall from relying on the guru is heavy. || 140 ||
<tantra> From the Glorious Sky-Not-Exhausted Tantra:
<tantra> "If without bad mind,
<tantra> By recognized mindfulness in dream,
<tantra> Or non-virtues becoming careless,
<tantra> Confess aimed at the guru.
<tantra> Bodily fault by body,
<tantra> Thus speech and mind also.
<tantra> If not confessed immediately,
<tantra> By this too, experience uninterrupted suffering."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 150 ||
<tantra> Moreover, the guru is the nature of all Buddhas,
<tantra> Teaching to liberate from samsara by supreme Dharma at this time; therefore the object is fierce.
<tantra> Accomplish as spoken,
<tantra> Abandoning non-faith,
<tantra> Wrong mind,
<tantra> Harm,
<tantra> And speaking, etc.
<tantra> From the mouth of the great master Joy Vajra:
<tantra> "The supreme guru commanded:
<tantra> If knowing the flaw of faults, || 160 ||
<tantra> Do as spoken.
<tantra> Thus, toward the guru's activity,
<tantra> Even if body's suffering becomes supreme,
<tantra> By one's own ability, make effort to do.
<tantra> The guru's mind, even for a moment,
<tantra> Must not be disturbed.
<tantra> Toward the guru's food and wealth,
<tantra> As one cherishes one's own life,
<tantra> The yogi must always act.
<tantra> If in the guru's realm, || 170 ||
<tantra> Teaching Dharma, empowerment, consecration,
<tantra> And all meditations to be done,
<tantra> Must not be done without subsequent permission.
<tantra> Briefly, by body, speech, and mind,
<tantra> Whatever deed's aspect is done,
<tantra> Without asking the guru, without permission,
<tantra> Even a little must not be done.
<tantra> Furthermore, whatever virtuous karma,
<tantra> Begin by asking the guru.
<tantra> In all yogic conduct, || 180 ||
<tantra> Must not separate from the supreme guru.
<tantra> Whenever eating food of the three times,
<tantra> With first portions cut in three parts,
<tantra> Must offer to the supreme guru.
<tantra> By wealth and rare jewels,
<tantra> To the guru, vajra holder,
<tantra> Without desire, offer portions.
<tantra> With first portions of whatever and whatever,
<tantra> Dedicate and offer to the supreme guru.
<tantra> Briefly, all of one's mind, || 190 ||
<tantra> Pure aspect, without pretense,
<tantra> Aim toward the guru's portion.
<tantra> All good qualities will be accomplished."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10296] Purpose is from the Consequence:
<verse> "Guru rely, circle stream stop.
<verse> Empowerment rely, body speech ripen.
<verse> Samaya rely, actual-accomplish arise.
<verse> View rely, realm three cease.
<verse> Meditate rely, delusion stop. || 200 ||
<verse> Conduct rely, body purified become.
<verse> Rely this from whatever arise—
<verse> This self samaya discipline's."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10306] That also: samaya's sequence from exceed if, restore's ritual to effort, and
Respective cross-recognized's distinction know, confess do.
Nature's cross-recognized is explained ones in,
Time's cross-recognized is samaya recognized one to also,
Time long to gone and heavy to gone,
Recognized's contradict, || 210 ||
Recognized,
Crossed,
Loose—these four know do.
That in: samaya from contradict is direction agree's fault tainted is although, this occasion in recognized's contradict to apply if,
Samaya recognized's fault day gap not: samaya from contradict called.
Month gap not is: recognized.
Year gap not is: crossed.
Year two and three gone is: loose.
That to respective's restore method also know, restore do.
<tantra> From the Vajra Sun Samaya Arranged Tantra: || 220 ||
<tantra> "General samaya distinction from,
<tantra> Time from distinction certain divided,
<tantra> Samaya from contradict called fault whatever.
<tantra> Day gap not in,
<tantra> Aimed object to confess done if,
<tantra> That corner even enter one's,
<tantra> Recognized called month not-respected.
<tantra> Regret intense confess,
<tantra> Samaya from crossed if year,
<tantra> Middle gap not confess, || 230 ||
<tantra> Year two and three from,
<tantra> Samaya loose called.
<tantra> Supremely pure if restore able.
<tantra> Year three from exceed after,
<tantra> That restore able not is.
<tantra> If take, both's burn.
<tantra> Certain earth-dwell suffering to,
<tantra> Continually conduct only.
<tantra> Contradict if gathering's wheel confess.
<tantra> Recognized if self's possession restore. || 240 ||
<tantra> Crossed: child and wife and
<tantra> Near-circle body and speech and
<tantra> Mind and possession accompany restore.
<tantra> Loose: self's life restore.
<tantra> That from again become if,
<tantra> Recognized great called.
<tantra> Restore able not."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10349] Third: supreme samaya explain is.
<tantra> From the Letter-Not-Have: || 250 ||
<tantra> "That time guard one's boundary crossed one's,
<tantra> Not-have and one alone vast one's—
<tantra> That one's companion that becomes."
<tantra> Thus spoke one's meaning little explain if,
<tantra> Self's realization's top from certainty straight direct spoke.
[10356] Thus nature Great Completion's samaya: awareness self-arisen wisdom, primordial guard boundary from crossed one's, nature from not-move do.
That also nature primordial-pure to regarding: Trekcho's samaya as samsara's Dharma, as appearance all, appearance existence container-contents outer inner all, primordial not-have, mirage's water etc. illusion's eight-examples know, appearance to true-clinging release one's purpose is.
Outer inner object not-have know one's state in, mind seize's rope not-bound, awareness vast gapless great guard, and
Clinging seize whatever not-do, door five wide-open, object not-have's awareness, basis not-have direct on put after, vast vast release is: vast called.
Appearance label Dharma-nature release one's purpose is. || 260 ||
Nature spontaneous-presence to regarding: Thogyal's samaya as,
Self-arisen's wisdom to quality spontaneous accomplish, gathering not-depend, self face know accomplish certainty after,
Light five self-clear spontaneous-presence's nature, appearance four's experience and not-separate do,
Buddha self-nature as accomplish.
Other from doubt not-need one's purpose is.
<verse> Condition appear and pleasure-pain arise, feel and thought,
<verse> Appear and awareness whatever arise,
<verse> Whatever appear,
<verse> Whatever aware also self-arisen's wisdom one-only certainty,
<verse> All self-release spontaneous-equal great's meaning from not-exceed, and || 270 ||
Nature Dharma-body primordial-pure and spontaneous-presence, Trekcho and Thogyal two not-have,
Dharma-nature cease ground on: sha ra ra ol la la.
Ye re re sangs sangs sangs: certain existence seize one's purpose is.
That all also self-clear wide, self-cease.
Self-enlightened, self-liberated.
Trace without, childlike.
Expression.
Fixation without, primordially-enlightened Samantabhadra's intention-to reached.
Phenomena exhausted, primordially-exhausted great.
Anyone samsara not experience: || 280 ||
Samsara primordially-exhausted.
Anyone pass not experience:
Nirvana primordially-liberated.
Awareness sufficient.
Non-awareness sufficient.
Existence sufficient.
Non-existence sufficient.
Samsara sufficient.

Wide-open.
Undecided decided.
Not-dissolved dissolved.
Not-vanished vanished.
Not-cleared cleared.
Not-taxed taxed-to arisen is.
Great Perfection primordially-liberated spontaneously-accomplished yoga called.
This like samaya at abide is: various self-liberated's yogin is,
Without-doing completed,
Without-going arrived, || 310 ||
Without-seeking found,
Without-accomplishing accomplished,
Without-abandoning purified.
Expression.
Guru holy's intention and equal.
Connection.
Karma completed.
Action without spontaneously-accomplished intention-to reached.
Klong-chen Rab-'byams good now become.
Ah la la. || 320 ||
Crucial is but not understand.
Realization sufficient but effort need.
Place sufficient but who from free.
Heard but word-taste.
Understand but concept.
Realize but extent.
Meditate but mind-made.
Analyze but duality-grasp.
Accomplish but samsara.
Still now dharmata's vast-expanse self where exist. || 330 ||
Samsara from prior-mixing one-by not-transcended student-to,
Natural Great Perfection's karmic-connection one also come will.
Phenomena exhausted self's appearance-to looked-by,
Mind exhausted alone joy lost.
Action without dharmata's nature taken-by,
Hope-fear duality-grasp's defilement from liberated.
Meditate sufficient.
Place sufficient.
Do sufficient.
Abandon sufficient. || 340 ||
This is fix-limit dharma non-existent self-to.
Self-fall spontaneous-presence's meaning water-wave like although,
One also my meaning not-understand ya cha.
All primordially-seized in dwell and again do.
Primordially-release in dwell and again release.
Primordially-place in dwell and again place.
Primordially-meditated in dwell and again meditate.
Primordially-view in dwell and again view.

Seek from exceed.
Find not-have.
Thus wide spontaneous-arising in dwell.
Explain also not-understand one's person to, realization's karma-connection not-have: laugh.
Primordially-place dharma ceased one's student all meaning not-find: pra yas.
What to look also, space wide klong-chen's meaning appear, experience delightful. || 370 ||
Cease one's ground always conduct, samsara-nirvana boundary not-have, release one's yogi is.
Meaning this like, meaning word in spoke,
Future's fortunate ones,
Me and actual meet one's statue arose, realization self-arise appear one's faith-basis make.
Thus realization view's samaya great four always dwell shown is.
<tantra> From Awareness Self-Arisen:
<tantra> "Samaya guard not-have, primordial guard separate.
<tantra> Not-have vast spontaneous-presence one-only.
<tantra> Secret-mantra all's meaning great is."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 380 ||
This is place important great.
<tantra> From the Vehicle's Supreme Jewel Treasury:
<tantra> Samaya aspects arranged is, sequence house seven is.
Thus empowerment and samaya's king great shown after,
Now essence meaning's nature certainty place from,
