[8680] <verse> First recognition: Joy itself only,
[8681] Second recognition: feeling experience touch;
[8682] Third recognition: bliss itself called,
[8683] Fourth recognition: experience co-emergent,
[8684] Fifth recognition: emptiness called—
[8685] Thus.
[8686] <prose> Twelfth: viewing recognition itself and applying the crucial point of no-change.

<tantra> All signs are spontaneous marks of awakened display—not achievements to be gained, but recognition of what already is.
