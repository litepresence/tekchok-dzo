[16866] At first, light appears like a mirror's surface—
[16867] Then as fragments,
[16868] As realms and domains,
[16869] Filling all of space.
[16870] Whatever appears arises as the display of Dharmatā. From seeing between bodies to reaching the consummation of visionary appearances—this is the manner of familiarity.
[16871] From the <tantra>Rangshar</tantra>:
[16872] <verse>Having distinguished the boundary of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa,
[16873] Settle body and speech in their natural place.
[16874] Then examine the appearances of Space and Vidya.
[16875] Having found the measure of familiarity with this,
[16876] The outer appearances themselves
[16877] Progressively increase from above to above,
[16878] Gradually obtaining great self-familiarity.
[16879] Having found the measure of stability in this,
[16880] When all phenomena become exhausted—
[16881] This is to be made familiar,
[16882] As I have taught as a branch.</verse>
[16883] Thus it is spoken.
[16884] And from the <tantra>Rangshar</tantra>:
[16885] <verse>The pristine cognition of seeing and familiarization,
[16886] Having no mind of grasping whatsoever—
[16887] The measure of seeing is held by this.
[16888] In the completely pure sky,
[16889] Through the unceasing power of the eye,
[16890] In the center of the lower sky, Thusness—
[16891] That pure Space Lamp,
[16892] Which is seen through the King of Awareness-Knowledge,
[16893] When one becomes familiar with that,
[16894] This is seeing one's own View.
[16895] Deep familiarization with this is paramount.</verse>
[16896] Thus it is.
[16897] Seven: The Measure



### PAGE 404


[16898] Through practice, from the nose-tip to the upper-reach between the eyebrows, from the blue expanding as shimmering light, visionary spikes appearing below the contour—
[16899] Like a mirror,
[16900] Like fragments,
[16901] Inside the pervasion of the extent of vision, bodies arise—this is its measure.
[16902] From the <tantra>Secret Conduct Seed Tantra</tantra>:
[16903] <verse>The manner of viewing Space and Awareness:
[16904] View the sky free from obstructions.
[16905] As a necklace within Space,
[16906] Completely establish without separation.
[16907] Thus, whoever sees in this way—
[16908] With Primordial Samantabhadra
[16909] Their fortune is equal.
[16910] From that, one sees the bindu.
[16911] Through focusing there, appearances rise above,
[16912] Thus from seeing one's own face.
[16913] From the upper-reach, at four finger-widths,
[16914] The excellent being separated—
[16915] How could there be entry into Saṃsāra?
[16916] Whatever appears as the filled vessel—
[16917] Through this, the qualities of Emanation are accomplished.
[16918] Whatever appears as the mere object of seeing—
[16919] In the sphere, it is likewise.
[16920] Whatever outer appearances cease—
[16921] In sixteen moments,
[16922] This also becomes thus.
[16923] The bindus of unripened and so forth,
[16924] Likewise up to reaching the body—
[16925] Six and ten and five and three—
[16926] Without doubt, this is the Sambhogakāya.
[16927] When reaching the ground of the exhaustion of the inner body,
[16928] Fingers and so forth likewise appear.
[16929] Here, focusing causes the elements to self-cessate.
[16930] Through the distinction of arising and entering,
[16931] In the ground of the exhaustion of all phenomena,
[16932] Without grasping anything whatsoever—
[16933] This is the abiding of the Nirmāṇakāya.
[16934] This is empowered by the force of entry,
[16935] Whoever obtains the self-power of arising,
[16936] Through focusing upon that,
[16937] When this is done again at that time,
[16938] The self-sound of appearances as spontaneous melody—
[16939] Directly returning, appears as distortion.
[16940] Through this, the benefit of all beings is accomplished.
[16941] Because Awareness is singularly equal,
[16942] The three thousandfold—
[16943] The great transmigration of beings is accomplished by this.
[16944] Likewise through gradual and instantaneous,
[16945] The body is accomplished by this.
[16946] All of that is liberated from the measure of body-exhaustion.
[16947] All of this is the certain result—
[16948] The supreme ground, the great Maṇḍala, is accomplished.</verse>
[16949] Thus it is spoken.



### PAGE 405


[16950] From the <tantra>Lamp Blazing</tantra>:
[16951] <verse>From the blue unchanging appearances,
[16952] Also as the five clear lights of the opening—
[16953] This itself becomes supremely clear,
[16954] In front of oneself at the upper-reach,
[16955] At four finger-widths or a forearm's length,
[16956] Elevated and separated from the body—
[16957] This becomes its measure.</verse>
[16958] Thus it is spoken.
[16959] And from the <tantra>Rangshar</tantra>:
[16960] <verse>Then from the arising of appearances,
[16961] Through one's own great discriminating awareness,
[16962] When examined, in the appearance of pristine cognition,
[16963] Body and pristine cognition arise without direction.
[16964] The manner of arising is as follows:
[16965] At first, merely a mirror-maṇḍala,
[16966] From that, appearances arise as fragments,
[16967] From that, arising as realms and domains,
[16968] From that, arising as filling the sky.
[16969] Whatever appears, in the maṇḍala of light,
[16970] Arising and seeing form-bodies,
[16971] All the maṇḍalas of bodies
[16972] Arising from oneself and emanated from oneself.
[16973] The appearances filling the sky
[16974] Are the signs of pristine cognition moving through the sky of Jñāna,
[16975] The Dharmatā of seeing unceasing.
[16976] In the appearance of self-nature itself,
[16977] The body of self-essence arising—
[16978] That arising is oneself.
[16979] The Dharma of the measure of the intent of the Buddhas,
[16980] Thus-gone to the authentic meaning—
[16981] This is taught as the measure of familiarity.</verse>
[16982] Thus it is.
[16983] Eight: The Location
[16984] The Space of the Ground: Citta.
[16985] The Space of the Path: Briguta.
[16986] The Space of Fruition: Self-Arising—the location is cloudless sky.
[16987] From the <tantra>Lamp Blazing</tantra>:
[16988] <verse>The eye without conditioned arising,
[16989] Abiding in one's own Awareness,
[16990] Appears as a necklace,
[16991] Apprehending cloudless sky.
[16992] When self-knowing is clear within,
[16993] It abides in the center of Citta.
[16994] Outer projection is cloudless sky.
[16995] In the pure eye-consciousness,
[16996] The five radiant light-rays as illuminators—
[16997] In the manner of unchanging pervasion,
[16998] Abide as the great blue natural resonance.</verse>
[16999] Thus it is.

[17000] Nine: The Gate
[17001] It arises from the eye.
[17002] From the <tantra>Lamp Blazing</tantra>:
[17003] <verse>The gate of arising of this is also from the eye,
[17004] Appearing in the manner of unchanging pervasion.
[17005] Through the self-purity of the appearances of this,
[17006] Space and Awareness are united in pair—
[17007] Abiding primordially, resting evenly.
[17008] Self-arising is its own sphere of activity.
[17009] Through appearances connected with the eye itself,
[17010] That itself arises in the sky free from conditions.
[17011] Thus the gate of arising is unceasing.</verse>
[17012] Thus it is.
[17013] Ten: The Space Lamp Itself
[17014] Arising from the two corners of the eye as blue great-pervading light without limit—the inner Rigpa abides as light in that mansion, while outwardly the bindu necklace with thousandfold emptiness abides as its fence. The five-colored light-display and the encircling fence are Space itself.
[17015] Moreover, because there is no coarse substantiality, it is not established as an object of grasping. Because it is severance from nihilistic severance, it is self-clear like a rainbow. Because it is unharmed by elemental disturbance, it is not conditioned Saṃsāra. Because it possesses the key points, through seeing and familiarizing one becomes originally enlightened, re-enlightened.
[17016] From the <tantra>Lamp Blazing</tantra>:
[17017] <verse>Thus with the three key points and oral instruction,
[17018] The person who connects with this,
[17019] Becomes familiar with Space directly.
[17020] In the upper-reach of existence,
[17021] From the corner of this very dual entry,
[17022] Through the nature of Skillful Means and Discriminating Awareness,
[17023] The two are intertwined and unified.
[17024] By a single finger-width, ignorance—
[17025] Through conditioned arising by day,
[17026] Appearances become manifest, and at night
[17027] The blue itself merges with its own face.
[17028] The nature of Space, the mansion of light,
[17029] As the great primordial resonance unchanging,
[17030] For all Buddhas and beings,
[17031] Without anyone having made it—
[17032] Primordially abides without duality, equal.
[17033] From this great pervasive subtlety,
[17034] Arising as the portion of one's own knowing,
[17035] It is directly present, supremely secret.
[17036] For whoever wishes to practice this great secret,
[17037] They become re-enlightened in original enlightenment.</verse>
[17038] Thus it is.
[17039] Eleven: The Analogical Example of This
[17040] Just as when the four Nāro letters have their two wings gathered, one Nāro is accomplished, so when the outer blue Space and the appearances arising from it are gathered together, they are designated as one—the Space Lamp.



### PAGE 407


[17041] Like the form of Nāro, the great blue pervasion, yet when first appearing at the eyebrow-center, a black form somewhat upright with curvature—
[17042] When focusing upon that, afterwards it fills the intermediate space like a five-colored rainbow.
[17043] From the <tantra>Rangshar</tantra>:
[17044] <verse>For example, like the letter Nāro,
[17045] When the two are held and gathered as one,
[17046] The black can be transformed.
[17047] Having found confidence through familiarity with that,
[17048] The intermediate space like a rainbow,
[17049] Colors unmixed, completely perfect.
[17050] Then again through the power of familiarity,
[17051] For one endowed with its signs,
[17052] The intermediate realm is likewise.</verse>
[17053] Thus it is.
