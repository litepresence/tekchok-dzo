[8083] <tantra>From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[8084] "Realization wisdom empowerment:
[8085] Should be known as form three.
[8086] Empowering outer: sentient beings' appearance,
[8087] Empowering inner: meditation mind-holding.
[8088] By twenty-one introductions,
[8089] Should be empowered as secret empowerment.
[8090] Introduction also form three:
[8091] By complete three—example, meaning, and sign,
[8092] Should empower great empowerment indicating.
[8093] Do introduction of Rigpa wisdom.
[8094] Secret wisdom empowerment.
[8095] By introduction of Rigpa only,
[8096] Do empowerment of form-body pure lands.
[8097] Realization wisdom empowerment supreme:
[8098] Know whatever appears as Rigpa.
[8099] Rigpa free of negation and assertion,
[8100] Empowerments complete at one time.
[8101] Instructions liberating empowerments.
[8102] Great object-free Maṇḍala,
[8103] Empowerment exists in self.
[8104] That also said by untying meaning:
[8105] One untie, two untie, all untie,
[8106] Liberation self-arisen, other not.
[8107] Thus self-arisen great empowerment.
[8108] Maṇḍala of supreme meaning empowerment:
[8109] One complete, two complete, all complete.
[8110] Indicating wisdom of meaning empowerment:
[8111] One non, two non, all non.
[8112] Great empowerment realizing Vajra meaning:
[8113] One arise, two arise, all arise.
[8114] Great empowerment of empty wisdom:
[8115] One born, two born, all born.
[8116] If realized, thus empower supreme empowerment."
[8117] Thus it is spoken.
[8118] 
[8119] That also: conventionally said as "empowering" through Guru's introduction to empowerment existing primordially in self.
[8120] Empower those meanings' realization into practice.
[8121] 
[8122] Gurus who have obtained siddhi, even with a single fragment, obtain complete empowerment for the student,
[8123] Accomplishing as said,
[8124] Those who have not obtained siddhi accomplish meaning by empowering that all combined.
[8125] 
[8126] From that arrangement of four empowerments:
[8127] <list>First: colored-powder Maṇḍala, Deity,
[8128] Vase,
[8129] Student preparation complete,
[8130] Vase action preceding: eight auspicious substances,
[8131] Seven royal possessions,
[8132] Empowering peaceful-wrathful body with Tsaka-li or protruding or statue image, blessing with Vajra, name empowerment,
[8133] Empowering with Poti of command and seal,
[8134] Completing activity with glory Torma empowerment—called vase empowerment.
[8135] 
[8136] Then giving two Bodhicittas—secret empowerment.
[8137] 
[8138] Then: attachment-free Mudrā meditation,
[8139] Empowering merely by respecting Mudrā,
[8140] Two: empowering the attached with actual action seal—
[8141] Prajñā-Jñāna.
[8142] 
[8143] That is called not-realized cause-indicating empowerment.
[8144] 
[8145] Then fourth, word empowerment:
[8146] Realization wisdom empowerment,
[8147] External: view,
[8148] Internal: meditation,
[8149] Empowering three: secret Rigpa.
[8150] 
[8151] Self-introducing Rigpa through introduction,
[8152] Directly viewing meaning,
[8153] Called Rigpa-potency empowerment: transmitting recognition by dividing into three—pressing essential point of arise-release.
[8154] 
[8155] Thus the definite four empowerments:
[8156] Arrangement of middling elaboration-with.
[8157] 
[8158] Condensed elaboration-with:
[8159] Called meaning-elaboration,
[8160] <list>First: entering self and student into colored-powder Maṇḍala indicating five Rigpa wisdoms,
[8161] Vase,
[8162] Secret,
[8163] Prajñā-Jñāna,
[8164] Empowering Dzogchen complete word empowerment with four signs, making festival.
[8165] 
[8166] This is the sequence of actual empowerment from Vimala to Legé-tsün.
[8167] 
[8168] Now doing as hand tradition,
[8169] And renowned that the other two from Guru Jo-ber are cut.
[8170] Before that, from symbols only,
[8171] Renowned that there is no hand tradition.
[8172] Obvious that it is difficult to bestow hand-receiving coming from treasure, so not bestowed.
[8173] Meaning elaboration is sufficient,
[8174] And bestowing into practice: empowerment root exists, difficulty not.
[8175] Guru said: no contradiction even if bestowed.
[8176] 
[8177] Those have finished teaching the action sequence of four empowerments.
[8178] 
[8179] Teaching the third meaning: classification of Mudra difficult to realize—inner meaning of Prajñā-Jñāna empowerment—seventeen.
[8180] <list>Examining and searching knowledge-woman,
[8181] How to attract that,
[8182] Examining channel characteristics,
[8183] Expanding Bodhicitta,
[8184] Training in Dhāraṇī, certainly holding Mantra path,
[8185] Pith-instruction of method generating bliss to that,
[8186] Searching and holding channel with special preparation seat,
[8187] Down-casting conventional Bindu relying on body key,
[8188] Body posture,
[8189] Holding with wind key,
[8190] Refining Bindu, applying great bliss Mudrā,
[8191] Applying certainty to sequence of bliss arising,
[8192] Applying view to that, calculating change,
[8193] Placing Bindu at channel object, expanding body strength by mixing with wind, applying to ultimate Bodhicitta.
[8194] Reversing three times for student's benefit, then sending back, applying to special certainty of empowerment.
[8195] Holding measure of experience of object-free great bliss arising for student.
[8196] Relying on continuum, making unseen,
[8197] Other than empowerment time, not relying, offering gift, sending to self's place, comfortable.
[8198] 
[8199] <list>First:
[8200] Family,
[8201] Shape,
[8202] Color,
[8203] From four examinations through conduct door.
[8204] 
[8205] From three examinations through the door of family:
[8206] <list>Outer family: by royal family accomplishing Buddha of Sugata family,
[8207] By minister family: Vajra,
[8208] By commoner family: jewel,
[8209] By Brahmin: lotus,
[8210] By outcaste family: accomplishing Buddha of karma family.
[8211] 
[8212] If thinking that whichever Buddha is accomplished by one, it is not so;
[8213] Without each knowledge-woman for each family, it is not accomplished.
[8214] Just as Buddhas arise in five families, certainly in five families.
[8215] 
[8216] Thus:
[8217] <tantra>From the Great Empowerment Arrangement:
[8218] "By difference of Buddha family,
[8219] Knowledge-woman thus becomes different."
[8220] Thus it is spoken.
[8221] 
[8222] <list>Inner family: daughter of Yakṣa,
[8223] Daughter of god,
[8224] Son of Nāga,
[8225] Daughter of Brahmā,
[8226] Five daughters of Indra are the karma Mudra family.
[8227] 
[8228] <tantra>From the Vajra Ḍākinī Samvara:
[8229] "God, demigod, or Yakṣa,
[8230] Nāga, Indra, and Brahmā—
[8231] Blessed by Mudra surpassing family.
[8232] Attract and well apply by self."
[8233] Thus it is spoken.
[8234] 
[8235] As the master of Kosala, Glorious Great Bliss, attained siddhi by empowering, having attracted daughters of Brahmā, Indra, and so forth.
[8236] 
[8237] Secret family: four.
[8238] Women do not transcend the channels of four family-possessed.
[8239] 
[8240] <list>That: Conch-Possessed,
[8241] Elephant-Nose-Possessed,
[8242] Lotus-Possessed,
[8243] Deer-Possessed,
[8244] Cow-Possessed.
[8245] 
[8246] Conch-Possessed:
[8247] Black hair, good teeth, good arrangement.
[8248] Elephant-Nose: bad hair, excess front teeth.
[8249] 
[8250] Lotus-Possessed:
[8251] Yellow voice, right li.
[8252] 
[8253] Deer-Possessed:
[8254] Bad hair, big forehead prominence.
[8255] 
[8256] Cow-Possessed:
[8257] Good hair, wrinkle standing upward at forehead.
[8258] 
[8259] That Lotus-Possessed generates excess bliss, helper of Dharmatā clarity.
[8260] As there is a channel like lotus open and not-open,
[8261] Instruction of opening channel mouth is most important.
[8262] 
[8263] Deer-Possessed:
