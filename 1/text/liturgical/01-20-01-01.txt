<tantra> [8083] From the Self-Arisen:
<tantra> [8084] "Realization wisdom empowerment:
<tantra> [8085] Should be known as threefold.
<tantra> [8086] Outer empowering: sentient beings' appearance,
<tantra> [8087] Inner empowering: meditation mind-holding.
<tantra> [8088] Through twenty-one introductions,
<tantra> [8089] Should be empowered as secret empowerment.
<tantra> [8090] Introduction also threefold:
<tantra> [8091] Through complete three—example, meaning, and sign,
<tantra> [8092] Should empower great empowerment indicating.
<tantra> [8093] Do introduction of Rigpa wisdom.
<tantra> [8094] Secret wisdom empowerment.
<tantra> [8095] Through introduction of Rigpa alone,
<tantra> [8096] Do empowerment of form-body pure lands.
<tantra> [8097] Realization wisdom empowerment supreme:
<tantra> [8098] Know whatever appears as Rigpa.
<tantra> [8099] Rigpa free of negation and assertion,
<tantra> [8100] Empowerments complete at one time.
<tantra> [8101] Instructions liberating empowerments.
<tantra> [8102] Great object-free Maṇḍala,
<tantra> [8103] Empowerment exists in self.
<tantra> [8104] That also said by untying meaning:
<tantra> [8105] One untie, two untie, all untie,
<tantra> [8106] Liberation self-arisen, other not.
<tantra> [8107] Thus self-arisen great empowerment.
<tantra> [8108] Maṇḍala of supreme meaning empowerment:
<tantra> [8109] One complete, two complete, all complete.
<tantra> [8110] Indicating wisdom of meaning empowerment:
<tantra> [8111] One non, two non, all non.
<tantra> [8112] Great empowerment realizing Vajra meaning:
<tantra> [8113] One arise, two arise, all arise.
<tantra> [8114] Great empowerment of empty wisdom:
<tantra> [8115] One born, two born, all born.
<tantra> [8116] If realized, thus empower supreme empowerment."
<tantra> [8117] Thus it is spoken.

[8118] That also: conventionally said as "empowering" through Guru's introduction to empowerment existing primordially in self.
[8119] Empower those meanings' realization into practice.

[8120] Gurus who have obtained siddhi, even with a single fragment, obtain complete empowerment for the student,
[8121] Accomplishing as said.
[8122] Those who have not obtained siddhi accomplish meaning by empowering that all combined.

[8123] From that arrangement of four empowerments:
<list> [8124] First: colored-powder Maṇḍala, Deity,
<list> [8125] Vase,
<list> [8126] Student preparation complete,
<list> [8127] Vase action preceding: eight auspicious substances,
<list> [8128] Seven royal possessions,
<list> [8129] Empowering peaceful-wrathful body with Tsaka-li or protruding or statue image, blessing with Vajra, name empowerment,
<list> [8130] Empowering with Poti of command and seal,
<list> [8131] Completing activity with glory Torma empowerment—called vase empowerment.

[8132] Then giving two Bodhicittas—secret empowerment.

[8133] Then: attachment-free Mudrā meditation,
[8134] Empowering merely by respecting Mudrā,
<list> [8135] Two: empowering the attached with actual action seal—
<list> [8136] Prajñā-Jñāna.

[8137] That is called not-realized cause-indicating empowerment.

[8138] Then fourth, word empowerment:
[8139] Realization wisdom empowerment,
<list> [8140] External: view,
<list> [8141] Internal: meditation,
<list> [8142] Empowering three: secret Rigpa.

[8143] Self-introducing Rigpa through introduction,
[8144] Directly viewing meaning,
[8145] Called Rigpa-potency empowerment: transmitting recognition by dividing into three—pressing essential point of arise-release.

[8146] Thus the definite four empowerments:
[8147] Arrangement of middling elaboration-with.

[8148] Condensed elaboration-with:
[8149] Called meaning-elaboration,
<list> [8150] First: entering self and student into colored-powder Maṇḍala indicating five Rigpa wisdoms,
<list> [8151] Vase,
<list> [8152] Secret,
<list> [8153] Prajñā-Jñāna,
<list> [8154] Empowering Dzogchen complete word empowerment with four signs, making festival.

[8155] This is the sequence of actual empowerment from Vimala to Legé-tsün.

[8156] Now doing as hand tradition,
[8157] And renowned that the other two from Guru Jo-ber are cut.
[8158] Before that, from symbols only,
[8159] Renowned that there is no hand tradition.
[8160] Obvious that it is difficult to bestow hand-receiving coming from treasure, so not bestowed.
[8161] Meaning elaboration is sufficient,
[8162] And bestowing into practice: empowerment root exists, difficulty not.
[8163] Guru said: no contradiction even if bestowed.

[8164] Those have finished teaching the action sequence of four empowerments.

[8165] Teaching the third meaning: classification of Mudra difficult to realize—inner meaning of Prajñā-Jñāna empowerment—seventeen.
<list> [8166] Examining and searching knowledge-woman,
<list> [8167] How to attract that,
<list> [8168] Examining channel characteristics,
<list> [8169] Expanding Bodhicitta,
<list> [8170] Training in Dhāraṇī, certainly holding Mantra path,
<list> [8171] Pith-instruction of method generating bliss to that,
<list> [8172] Searching and holding channel with special preparation seat,
<list> [8173] Down-casting conventional Bindu relying on body key,
<list> [8174] Body posture,
<list> [8175] Holding with wind key,
<list> [8176] Refining Bindu, applying great bliss Mudrā,
<list> [8177] Applying certainty to sequence of bliss arising,
<list> [8178] Applying view to that, calculating change,
<list> [8179] Placing Bindu at channel object, expanding body strength by mixing with wind, applying to ultimate Bodhicitta.
<list> [8180] Reversing three times for student's benefit, then sending back, applying to special certainty of empowerment.
<list> [8181] Holding measure of experience of object-free great bliss arising for student.
<list> [8182] Relying on continuum, making unseen,
<list> [8183] Other than empowerment time, not relying, offering gift, sending to self's place, comfortable.

[8184] First:
<list> [8185] Family,
<list> [8186] Shape,
<list> [8187] Color,
<list> [8188] From four examinations through conduct door.

[8189] From three examinations through the door of family:
<list> [8190] Outer family: by royal family accomplishing Buddha of Sugata family,
<list> [8191] By minister family: Vajra,
<list> [8192] By commoner family: jewel,
<list> [8193] By Brahmin: lotus,
<list> [8194] By outcaste family: accomplishing Buddha of karma family.

[8195] If thinking that whichever Buddha is accomplished by one, it is not so;
[8196] Without each knowledge-woman for each family, it is not accomplished.
[8197] Just as Buddhas arise in five families, certainly in five families.

<tantra> [8198] From the Great Empowerment Arrangement:
<tantra> [8199] "By difference of Buddha family,
<tantra> [8200] Knowledge-woman thus becomes different."
<tantra> [8201] Thus it is spoken.

[8202] Inner family: daughter of Yakṣa,
[8203] Daughter of god,
[8204] Son of Nāga,
[8205] Daughter of Brahmā,
[8206] Five daughters of Indra are the karma Mudra family.

<tantra> [8207] From the Vajra Ḍākinī Samvara:
<tantra> [8208] "God, demigod, or Yakṣa,
<tantra> [8209] Nāga, Indra, and Brahmā—
<tantra> [8210] Blessed by Mudra surpassing family.
<tantra> [8211] Attract and well apply by self."
<tantra> [8212] Thus it is spoken.

[8213] As the master of Kosala, Glorious Great Bliss, attained siddhi by empowering, having attracted daughters of Brahmā, Indra, and so forth.

[8214] Secret family: four.
[8215] Women do not transcend the channels of four family-possessed.

<list> [8216] That: Conch-Possessed,
<list> [8217] Elephant-Nose-Possessed,
<list> [8218] Lotus-Possessed,
<list> [8219] Deer-Possessed,
<list> [8220] Cow-Possessed.

[8221] Conch-Possessed:
[8222] Black hair, good teeth, good arrangement.
[8223] Elephant-Nose: bad hair, excess front teeth.

[8224] Lotus-Possessed:
[8225] Yellow voice, right li.

[8226] Deer-Possessed:
[8227] Bad hair, big forehead prominence.

[8228] Cow-Possessed:
[8229] Good hair, wrinkle standing upward at forehead.

[8230] That Lotus-Possessed generates excess bliss, helper of Dharmatā clarity.
[8231] As there is a channel like lotus open and not-open,
[8232] Instruction of opening channel mouth is most important.

[8233] Deer-Possessed:
