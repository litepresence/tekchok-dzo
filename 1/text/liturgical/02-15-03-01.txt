[669] <prose> The first aspect:
[670] Though essence is one, the Three Kayas abide in the expanse through different aspects.
[671] From Self-Arisen:
[672] <verse> Three Kayas, wisdom-appearance,
[673] Without obstruction to anything;
[674] Perceived objects being one,
[675] Essence appearing individually. || 10 ||
[676] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[677] This is the manner of awareness-itself's appearance.
[678] From that same nature:
[679] <verse> Thought-free awareness, Dharmakaya's essence;
[680] Uncensored clear awareness, Sambhogakaya;
[681] Whatever-appearing awareness, Nirmanakaya. || 20 ||
[682] <prose><tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[683] In this, complete;
[684] Awakened.
