[669] <prose> The first aspect:
[670] <prose> Though essence is one, the Three Kayas abide in the expanse through different aspects.
[671] <prose><tantra> From Self-Arisen:
[672] <verse> Three Kayas, wisdom-appearance,
[673] <prose> Without obstruction to anything;
[674] <prose> Perceived objects being one,
[675] <prose> Essence appearing individually.
[676] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[677] <prose> This is the manner of awareness-itself's appearance.
[678] <prose><tantra> From that same nature: || 10 ||
[679] <verse> Thought-free awareness, Dharmakāya's essence;
[680] <prose> Uncensored clear awareness, Sambhogakāya;
[681] <prose> Whatever-appearing awareness, Nirmāṇakāya.
[682] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[683] <prose> In this, complete;
[684] <prose> Awakened.
