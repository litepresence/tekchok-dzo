[16769] First, the essence.
[16770] From blue.
[16771] The five colors spread, and the five lights' rim rounds the inner petal, together like an under-barrel house appearance.
[16772] Awareness, the snake-noose ray-shooting fence, arises.
[16773] This bindu of the light house moves through a slight small part.
[16774] From the blazing lamp.
[16775] Completely, and through the sphere of the lamp.
[16776] The essence of awareness gathers.
[16777] The snake-noose fence appears.
[16778] This, to whoever is familiar, is that very meaning itself. || 10 ||
[16779] Blue, unchanging, self-luminous.
[16780] The rim of the fence abides.
[16781] Self-luminous, the outer object appears.
[16782] The essence itself is unfabricated.
[16783] Thus it is.
[16784] Also, when focusing on the sky, first from the straight-drawn sky-blue of the treasury-brow, great light pervades and arises.
[16785] From that inner, the five colors arise.
[16786] Also, from the two corners of the eye, rainbows arise like errors.
[16787] From the Pearl Garland:
[16788] <tantra> Like the rainbow of the sky. || 20 ||
[16789] <tantra> Pure, afflictions and stains exhausted.
[16790] <tantra> The sphere is vast, and the expanse uncut.

[16793] <tantra> Pervading great blue, change nonexistent.
[16794] <tantra> Meeting the condition of pure appearance.
[16795] <tantra> Becoming together with the five colors.
[16796] Thus it is spoken.
[16797] Second, the definition.
[16798] Through Rigpa, the self-object and appearance, through display-ground-doing, through the expanse. || 30 ||
[16799] Through completely pure nonexistent defilement, as object-appearance.
[16800] Through the chain-circle going-space grasp, from appearance-awareness, through clarifying, through the lamp.
[16801] <tantra> From the former.
[16802] <tantra> Through the expanse, through Rigpa, the self-object does.
[16803] <tantra> The vajra itself, chain-circle.
[16804] <tantra> Through entering inside this itself, doing.
[16805] <tantra> Through self, essence as thought-not.
[16806] <tantra> Also through inside, through the expanse, going-space.
[16807] <tantra> Indeed through not-grasping, nonabiding manner.
[16808] <tantra> Appearing as continuous as nonexistent separation. || 40 ||
[16809] To aspect-object as appearance.
[16810] Exhausted limit of number through pure defilement.
[16811] Through the lamp, the vajra chain-circle.
[16812] Indeed, stare-release to space itself.
[16813] Doing through appearing as nonexistent nature.
[16814] Through that meaning, grasping.
[16815] As definitive-term through nature itself.
[16816] Abiding as nonexistent gather-separate from-beginning.
[16817] Thus it is.
[16818] If divided through three, from three. || 50 ||
[16819] Through abiding at ground, through completely pure expanse, the lamp inside tsitta at pristine awareness and light, through body spontaneous-presence inside clear abiding.
[16820] Through appearing at path, through completely pure expanse, the lamp through the five rims' enclosure surrounding the center possessing lotus petal, through essence gathering of bindu.
[16821] Through appearing at fruit-object, through completely pure expanse, the lamp through bound chain-circle grasping, through the web and half-web of five lights.
[16822] Projection below design, etcetera.
[16823] Also from the blazing lamp.
[16824] Three divide-aspects exist.
[16825] Through abiding at ground, through pure expanse.
[16826] Through Rigpa, as pristine awareness body grasping.
[16827] Through appearing at path, through the expanse indeed.
[16828] Through Rigpa, essence gathering of bindu. || 60 ||
[16829] Through appearing at object, through the expanse indeed.
[16830] That chain-circle bound as grasping.
[16831] Through dividing all through that.
[16832] Thus it is.
[16833] Indeed four natures.
[16834] Through abiding as self-face primordially pure, through enclosure of expanse, as Rigpa inserts, through naked-straight equal intention, through great self-ease, through meditation state set-down.
[16835] Through spontaneous-presence primordial-resonance, from appearance, from space to projection below wall-house etcetera, through many appearances appearing indeed.
[16836] Intention, ka-pure and spontaneous-accomplish, two nonexistent, this nature.
[16837] From that.
[16838] Through unceasing nature-appearance. || 70 ||
[16839] All actual memory ceases.
[16840] Self-pure appearance into space.
[16841] Also to Awareness of nonexistent thought.
[16842] Through knowing nonmoving equality.
[16843] Also into space of all-ceasing.
[16844] Primordial thought-ceasing.
[16845] Abiding in completely pure nature space.
[16846] Through two nonexistent express and appearance-word.
[16847] Also into space of nonexistent outer and inner.
[16848] Abiding in the state of great self-ease. || 80 ||
[16849] Thus it is.
[16850] Five characteristics.
