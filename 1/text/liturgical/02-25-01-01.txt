<tantra> [15635] From the Pearl Garland Tantra:
<tantra> [15636] "The ground of liberation itself is the primordial."
<tantra> [15637] Thus it is spoken.

[15638] Regarding the primordially pure from the beginning: When Awareness recognizes its own face, and through irreversibility has reached a state of no return, the basis of delusion exhausted—this transformation of name is called "fruition."

[15639] From the detailed explanation previously established in the section on Ground,
[15640] One should understand this distinction through separation from stains.

[15641] The second part comprises three aspects:
<list> [15642] The actual manner of liberation in the Expanse;
<list> [15643] The nature of abiding in the Expanse;
<list> [15644] How the dharmatā intention spirals in the Expanse.

[15645] The first of these:

[15646] At the time of liberation for those of sharp, dull, and medium faculties, there is no distinction in the fruition;
[15647] All Buddhas of the three times awaken simultaneously as the single bindu of the non-dual nature, without same or different, in the Dharma-kāya beyond expression where intentions are exhausted—all as that very single nature.

[15648] Whether in this life with residual elements, or in the bardo through recognizing self-appearance, or
[15649] Through transference of breath to the emanation-field—
[15650] All path-appearances of kāyas and wisdoms, the externally clear aspects,
[15651] Through the sequence of spontaneous dissolution-thoroughfare, subside into the Expanse like light gathered within a crystal; at that time, appearances are liberated as emptiness.

[15652] Wisdom dissolves into the Expanse,
[15653] Form-kāyas pass beyond sorrow into the expanse of Dharma-kāya,
[15654] And subject-object without marks, like space, become of single taste in Dharmatā—like space dissolving into space.

[15655] For example: just as Awareness, separated from the Expanse and abiding in the body like space within a vase, is connected to the vast space through the aperture at the vase's mouth,
[15656] So the Four Lamps link with the primordially pure from the beginning;
[15657] When the vase breaks, inner, outer, and intermediate spaces abide as indivisible, a single essence—
[15658] So through the separation of body and mind, the five Awarenesses abide without outer or inner, as the great inner Expanse of Great Primordial Purity.

<tantra> [15659] From the Six Expanses:
<tantra> [15660] "When all elaborations have completely subsided in the state of Samantabhadra, when one has awakened without rival, this is called: free from the motes of dust in the eyes of all phenomena."
<tantra> [15661] "Having seen pure realms without limit, when outer and inner appearances mix without duality, the intention of the completely pure expanse is obtained."

[15662] At that time, this itself is called "samsara's beginning and end severed." Thus it is spoken.

[15663] Thus, like the merging of space with space—
[15664] Or again, like the rays of self-luminous outer display dissolving into the Expanse, or the sun setting and its rays gathering into themselves,
[15665] Like water dissolving into water,
[15666] Like butter dissolving into butter—

<tantra> [15667] From the Blazing Relics:
<tantra> [15668] "Then, in the primordially pure essence,
<tantra> [15669] Like rays gathering into the sun,
<tantra> [15670] Self-appearance together with emanations,
<tantra> [15671] Into their own essence self-dissolve,
<tantra> [15672] Becoming without division, without division-making.
<tantra> [15673] Just as water dissolves into water,
<tantra> [15674] And thus butter dissolves into butter,
<tantra> [15675] Like space dissolving into space,
<tantra> [15676] Non-dual, without certain grasping, they become."
<tantra> [15677] Thus it is spoken.

[15678] At that time, through the dissolution into the inner Expanse of primordial purity, Awareness settles in its own place;
[15679] The Victorious One, Buddha of unchanging light,
[15680] The Teacher of complete dominion, Samantabhadra, Lord of spontaneously present wisdom, Vajradhara—thus one becomes.

[15681] Through the exhaustion of path-phenomena, the fruition is obtained;
[15682] Fruition-phenomena, like the waxing and waning moon, completely perfected—
[15683] Beyond that, there is no travel, having reached the ground of exhaustion.

<tantra> [15684] From the Self-Arisen:
<tantra> [15685] "The realized person of intelligence and power
<tantra> [15686] Dissolves into the state of unchanging equality;
<tantra> [15687] Self-arisen, thought-free wisdom.
<tantra> [15688] In that great ground of Bheṭa Bṭersega,
<tantra> [15689] Various manifestations arise and dissolve into the state,
<tantra> [15690] Like an unarranged heap of jewels.
<tantra> [15691] The progenitor of all Buddhas
<tantra> [15692] Is renowned everywhere as unchanging light."

<tantra> [15693] From the Six Expanses:
<tantra> [15694] "At the time of passing beyond sorrow, conceptions self-exhaust through self-cessation of all extremes of expression;
<tantra> [15695] Aggregates, elements, and sense-fields passing beyond sorrow—all samsaric existence appears as the pure field of bliss;
<tantra> [15696] Sense-faculties and objects passing beyond sorrow—the supreme seal of mahāmudrā appears as self-appearance;
<tantra> [15697] Words and expressions at the time of passing beyond sorrow—appearance transcends all;
<tantra> [15698] View, meditation, conduct, and fruition at the time of passing beyond sorrow: effortful mindfulness self-exhausts;
<tantra> [15699] Dharmas and wisdom at the time of passing beyond sorrow—divine kāyas appear unobservable, sealed by mudrā;
<tantra> [15700] Experiences at the time of passing beyond sorrow—the doors of sensations are self-blocked through self-cessation;
[15701] Warmth and signs self-exhaust at the time of passing beyond sorrow—afflictions are self-emptied and made void.

[15702] These exhausted phenomena are the self-arising and self-perfection of the person who practices them.
[15703] Whoever sees this abiding ground of awareness,
[15704] This is the essence of Samantabhadra, the fruition of all Buddhas, self-abiding.
[15705] Whoever is familiar with this fruition of all Buddhas becomes the glorious Vajra-holder;
[15706] From the treasury of light of pure, stainless primordial Guardian, self-arisen,
[15707] The supreme secret, great embodiment of the deeds of all Buddhas—is obtained.
[15708] From there, the yogin of power, strength, and capacity, who does not turn back,
[15709] Having reached the limit of all fruitions, is equal to Samantabhadra."
<tantra> [15710] Thus it is spoken.

[15711] In the primordially pure own-face of suchness, transcending the extremes of existence and non-existence,
[15712] Merely the unceasing basis of manifestation—
[15713] Like a conch shell in its own face, where light and color are nowhere established,
[15714] Yet from within that state, the unceasing basis of five-fold light manifestation—

<tantra> [15715] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [15716] "Though the fruition cannot be expressed,
<tantra> [15717] Phenomena reach the place of exhaustion;
<tantra> [15718] One's own establishment-extreme also destroyed.
<tantra> [15719] At this time, the Guru's oral instruction sets;
<tantra> [15720] Through view, meditation, and conduct's extreme exhaustion,
<tantra> [15721] Phenomena do not appear as dharmas;
<tantra> [15722] Kāyas and wisdoms' continuum ceases;
<tantra> [15723] No Buddhas and no sentient beings;
<tantra> [15724] In brief, nothing whatsoever abides;
<tantra> [15725] Without going, there is no coming."

<tantra> [15726] From the Six Expanses:
<tantra> [15727] "Thus in Dharmatā primordially pure,
<tantra> [15728] There is no wisdom and no kāya;
<tantra> [15729] Without light, without colors,
<tantra> [15730] Without the nature of anything established—
<tantra> [15731] What need to mention non-recognition and afflictions?
<tantra> [15732] They do not exist."
<tantra> [15733] Thus it is spoken.

[15734] Thus, even in the nature of inner Expanse primordially pure, merely the basis of manifestation—
[15735] Nowhere is anything established as real.

<tantra> [15736] From that very text:
<tantra> [15737] "In self-nature's appearance,
<tantra> [15738] There has never been mark-grasping;
<tantra> [15739] Without color, through self-clarity,
<tantra> [15740] Knowing and awareness-aspects only—
<tantra> [15741] Without any grasped object,
<tantra> [15742] Without the grasping-aspect of conception;
<tantra> [15743] Into the primordial clarity beyond light,
<tantra> [15744] Abiding with primordial distinction;
<tantra> [15745] Into the self-clarity beyond kāya,
<tantra> [15746] Abiding as the completely pure great mudrā."
<tantra> [15747] Thus it is spoken.

[15748] The second: the nature of Awareness abiding in the Expanse comprises five aspects:
<list> [15749] Elements merging into the Expanse;
<list> [15750] Wisdom dissolving into the Expanse;
<list> [15751] Prajñā ascending to space;
<list> [15752] Luminosity spiraling in the Expanse;
<list> [15753] Awareness settling in its own place.

[15754] The first of these:

[15755] Through the compression of the three treasuries into one, the five elements are liberated into the expanse of the five great elements—
[15756] Without obstruction to the eye of pure wisdom.
[15757] Thus when impure, deluded appearances dissolve into pure Dharmatā,
[15758] The flesh-blood body dissolves into the illusory body of luminosity, and that itself dissolves into the secret vajra-body of Dharma-kāya;
[15759] The eye of wisdom dissolves into the eye of wisdom,
[15760] And that itself dissolves into the eye of Dharmatā—subject and object, action and agent completely purified.
[15761] In the precious secret treasury, the intention of wisdom's inner clarity transfers without change—

<tantra> [15762] From Samantabhadra's Mind-Mirror:
<tantra> [15763] "Impure deluded appearances obscure wisdom-appearance;
<tantra> [15764] When deluded appearances cease, pure appearance dawns;
<tantra> [15765] Latencies of the treasury obscure wisdom's illusory body;
<tantra> [15766] When this body is abandoned, light-appearance dawns;
<tantra> [15767] Then one reaches perfection in the jeweled treasury;
<tantra> [15768] The three treasuries compressed into one, emanations are made in the ten directions."
<tantra> [15769] Thus it is spoken.

[15770] Now, the five elements of the present body's impure aspects purified,
[15771] The great inner Expanse of primordial purity's luminosity—if one calculates the manner in which the five great elements individually abide in the expanse,
[15772] It is not that impure elements actually become pure elements, nor that latencies dissolve—
[15773] Rather, through the power of purifying impure five elements, as they appear to the pure eye of wisdom as the five pure great elements,
[15774] The pure result is definitively established.

[15775] Thus it is spoken.

[15776] The wind arranged as a crossed vajra, with the ḍākinī of samaya spiraling in space without moving—the wind dissolves into the Expanse;
[15777] Earth, the stūpa of the five jewels, balanced and arranged, without solidity—earth dissolves into the Expanse;
[15778] Water, the well-arranged crystal wheel, liberated from action and affliction, without moisture—water dissolves into the Expanse;
[15779] Fire, the blazing lotus-net of light, ripening the unripened, without heat—fire dissolves into the Expanse;
[15780] Space, the vast, wide Dharmatā expanse, pure from the beginning, without the impure, delusion-opening space—space dissolves into the Expanse.
[15781] Thus outer objects,
[15782] Inner body,
[15783] Aggregates, elements, sense-fields, and all phenomena completely purified.

[15784] The precious jewel-nature of wisdom-emptiness, the universal-arising maṇḍala of the vast expanse—

<tantra> [15785] From the Self-Arisen:
<tantra> [15786] "The plain of the five jewels is completely smooth;
<tantra> [15787] The jewel-sun of secret treasure rises and sets without ceasing;
<tantra> [15788] The jewel-water-lotus is without stain;
<tantra> [15789] The jewel-fire-maṇḍala is well-arranged;
<tantra> [15790] The jewel-wind's prajñā is without conception;
<tantra> [15791] The jewel-earth-maṇḍala is the great vehicle;
<tantra> [15792] The jewel-space is without center or limit;
<tantra> [15793] The jewel-emptiness-maṇḍala is well-drawn;
<tantra> [15794] The jewel-kāya-blazing-relic stūpa is well-stacked—"
<tantra> [15795] Thus it is spoken.

<tantra> [15796] From the Introduction to Awareness:
<tantra> [15797] "Eye and eye-consciousness,
<tantra> [15798] Ear and ear-consciousness,
<tantra> [15799] Nose and smell-consciousness,
<tantra> [15800] Tongue and tongue-consciousness,
<tantra> [15801] Body and body-consciousness—
<tantra> [15802] Knowing the suchness of these, the body completely passes beyond sorrow;
<tantra> [15803] The form-aggregate is completely purified.
<tantra> [15804] Space completely passes beyond sorrow;
<tantra> [15805] The conception-aggregate is completely purified.
<tantra> [15806] Earth completely passes beyond sorrow;
<tantra> [15807] The feeling-aggregate is completely purified.
<tantra> [15808] Fire completely passes beyond sorrow;
<tantra> [15809] The consciousness-aggregate is completely purified.
<tantra> [15810] Wind completely passes beyond sorrow;
<tantra> [15811] The compositional-factor-aggregate is completely purified."
<tantra> [15812] Thus it is spoken.

[15812] The second: wisdom dissolving into the Expanse—
[15813] The five self-clarities of the five afflictions purifying into the five wisdoms dissolve into the luminosity of the inner Expanse,
[15814] Abiding as the basis of manifestation for the depth-clarity of five colors.

<tantra> [15815] From the Six Expanses:
<tantra> [15816] "The aspect of white self-clarity stirring
<tantra> [15817] Abides as great depth-clarity itself;
<tantra> [15818] The yellow aspect of appearance self-exhausting
<tantra> [15819] Is clear, unmanifest from the depth;
<tantra> [15820] The red aspect of attachment-aversion self-exhausting
<tantra> [15821] Abides as great, unmixed depth-clarity;
<tantra> [15822] The green of unobstructed, actionless striving,
<tantra> [15823] Without exhaustion—
<tantra> [15824] The firsts' rays also
<tantra> [15825] Unmanifest from the clear aspect;
<tantra> [15826] The dark-blue of unchanging perfection
<tantra> [15827] Abides without perfection-making."
<tantra> [15828] Thus it is spoken.

[15829] The third: prajñā ascending to space—
[15830] The five wisdom-winds of the inner Expanse, unmoving and without transfer, abide in their own places.
[15831] These are: powerful mistress,
[15832] Momentum-holder,
[15833] Ascending-doer,
[15834] Steady one,
[15835] Appearance-maker.

[15836] The water-pure-nature, selecting downward, powerful mistress—
[15837] Through wisdom-wind, the two principal retinues are joined as non-dual, though distinct in appearance;
[15838] The wind-pure-nature, upward-going momentum-holder—the five principal retinues are instantly moved into Dharma-kāya's state;
[15839] The earth-pure-nature, all-pervading appearance-basis manifestation, ascending-doer—without support or supported, form-kāya is established in Dharma-kāya's state;
[15840] The appearance-maker, space-pure-nature, unobservable equal-appearance fourfold Dharma-kāya and wisdom not existing as real, yet abiding as inner clarity of depth-clear manifestation-basis;
[15841] The steady one, earth-pure-nature life-wind manifestation-basis, making immovable the thought-free intention of awareness-wisdom.

<tantra> [15842] From that very text:
<tantra> [15843] "In great primordial self-purity,
<tantra> [15844] Perfected ones abide at the summit;
<tantra> [15845] Through self-purification of marked aggregates,
<tantra> [15846] They abide as the ground of great depth-clarity;
<tantra> [15847] Empty through pervader and pervaded."

<tantra> [15848] From the Self-Arisen:
<tantra> [15849] "The net of jeweled arrangement is called 'smooth aspects.'"
<tantra> [15850] Thus it is spoken.

[15850] The fourth: luminosity spiraling in the Expanse comprises four aspects:
<list> [15851] Without dullness in dissolution;
<list> [15852] Without conception in clarity;
<list> [15853] Without self in being;
<list> [15854] Without individual distinction in non-distinction.

[15855] The first: without dullness in dissolution—
[15856] Though elements merge into the Expanse and wisdom dissolves into the Expanse,
[15857] The three kāyas abide without separation or gathering as subtle wisdom's inner clarity.

[15858] The second:
[15859] Through Dharma-kāya's stainlessness, without front or back,
[15860] Without above or below,
[15861] Without direction or intermediate direction, through luminosity,
[15862] Abiding as the manifestation-basis of kāyas and wisdoms,
[15863] Without mind or breath, all samsaric phenomena are unstained.

[15864] The third:
[15865] Being the self-arisen king of view, without separation from latencies of self.

[15866] The fourth:
[15867] Within Dharma-kāya's expanse, the blazing jewel-kāya of five kāyas abides as depth-clarity,
[15868] And though the basis abides in its own place, through non-conception of that basis, the door of delusion into samsara does not open.
[15869] This arises from the movement of five kāyas into the Expanse through prajñā ripening into kāya.

[15870] The fifth: Awareness settling in its own place comprises four aspects:
<list> [15871] Dharma-kāya's unchanging vajra-like kāya;
<list> [15872] Wisdom's unchanging svastika-like life;
<list> [15873] Intention's ungathered river-like continuum;
<list> [15874] Awareness's unwaning sun-like ray.

[15875] The first:
[15876] Awareness dissolves form-kāya into Dharma-kāya, becoming of single essence,
[15877] Without transfer or change.

[15878] The second:
[15879] Essence-grasping wisdom,
[15880] Nature mark-grasping wisdom,
[15881] Compassion wisdom guiding beings—these, merely the manifestation-basis, are non-dual in their own face, abiding permanently—this is called "wisdom of all times."

[15882] The third:
[15883] Through continuum-samādhi's ungatheredness,
[15884] Without transfer from Dharmatā's inconceivable samādhi.

[15885] The fourth:
[15886] Through self-clarity's self-arisen Awareness abiding in great spontaneous presence,
[15887] It abides unchangingly in the jeweled treasury.

<tantra> [15888] From that very text:
<tantra> [15889] "On the jeweled vajra-seat, unchanging;
<tantra> [15890] On the jewel-emptiness-path, without meeting end;
<tantra> [15891] The intention of self-abiding awareness—
<tantra> [15892] This is shown as the oral instruction."
<tantra> [15893] Thus it is spoken.

[15893] The third: How the dharmatā intention spirals in the Expanse comprises three aspects:
<list> [15894] Essence briefly shown;
<list> [15895] Aspects extensively explained;
<list> [15896] Meaningful conclusion of the topic.

[15897] The first of these:

[15898] The heart-essence of self-clarity awareness-wisdom in the primordially pure Expanse,
[15899] Being the root of all Buddha-phenomena, is called "great scripture";
[15900] Vast through limitlessness,
[15901] Powerful through buddhahood,
[15902] The final vehicle of view,
[15903] The unchanging nail,
[15904] The castle beyond the reach of mind's analysis,
[15905] The mirror of the all-knowing,
[15906] The summit traversed by all paths,
[15907] The object of liberation,
[15908] The great treasury of all royal Dharma-phenomena—

[15909] Without letters:
[15910] Awareness-wisdom, unmistaken, shown;
[15911] Unchanging, great root-scripture;
[15912] Vast, great Dharma-appearance;
[15913] Powerful intention of Dharmatā;
[15914] Great self-arisen castle of view;
[15915] Unchanging great nail-letter;
[15916] Great castle difficult to bear;
[15917] Great mirror difficult to view;
[15918] Great path difficult to traverse;
[15919] Great object difficult to establish;
[15920] Great ground difficult to reach;
[15921] Great appearance unmanifest yet appearing;
[15922] Great unfathomable depth;
[15923] Great primordial clarity without pervasion;
[15924] Great wisdom without analytical thought;
[15925] Great intention without dualistic awareness and object;
[15926] Great appearance without mind;
[15927] Great completely open unchangingness;
[15928] Great difficulty of grasping the subtle;
[15929] Great without seeing the vast;
[15930] —
[15931] Great without shape in roundness;
[15932] Great without breath in flickering;
[15933] Great black color in clarity;
[15934] Great soft tenderness in non-being;
[15935] Great difficulty of analysis in appearance;
[15936] Great appearance in emptiness;
[15937] Great without severance in oneness;
[15938] Great perfection in dual-like appearance;
[15939] Great without ornament in beauty;
[15940] Great emptiness in fullness;
[15941] Great without completion in maturation;
[15942] Great without coming-going in kāya-like appearance—"
<tantra> [15943] Thus it is spoken.

[15943] Thus the Expanse and wisdom appear as two;
[15944] In Dharma-kāya's state, depth-clear kāya appears as manifestation-basis.

[15945] The second: extensively explained aspects comprise two:
[15946] If measured as empty essence, primordially pure, like space, nowhere established, transcending extremes—this is the vast expanse of Great Perfection, Dharma-kāya's expanse;
[15947] If measured as clear appearance, within Dharma-kāya's expanse, wisdom's spontaneously accomplished Body, Speech, and Mind of unceasing ornament-wheel arise as the universal-arising of subtle manifestation's depth-clarity.
[15948] From its aspects analyzed:
[15949] The five wisdoms' maṇḍala primordially clear,
[15950] Above that wisdom, nothing else exists—so high,
[15951] Wisdom's palace spontaneously accomplished—so vast, and so forth.

<tantra> [15952] From Samantabhadra's Mind-Mirror:
<tantra> [15953] "The jeweled arrangement-maṇḍala—though not drawn, displayed;
<tantra> [15954] The steady mountain-king of wisdom—though not built, high;
<tantra> [15955] The widely extending palace of wisdom—though not made, vast;
<tantra> [15956] The vast ocean of wisdom's expanse—though not stirred, self-clear;
<tantra> [15957] The clear sun of wisdom—though not fabricated, rises and sets without ceasing;
<tantra> [15958] The plain of emptiness's openness—though not arranged, smooth in aspects;
<tantra> [15959] The path of unchanging awareness—though not smoothed, without near or far;
<tantra> [15960] The horse of unchanging awareness—though running, without cessation;
<tantra> [15961] The river of awareness's unobservable stream—though flowing, without interruption;
<tantra> [15962] The seed of awareness-wisdom—without increase or decrease;
<tantra> [15963] Awareness's emptiness-clarity wisdom—without division;
<tantra> [15964] Awareness's ungrasping wisdom—without extremes of face-establishment;
<tantra> [15965] Awareness's thought-free wisdom—unceasing, completely clear;
<tantra> [15966] Awareness's all-clear wisdom—unmixed, completely perfect;
<tantra> [15967] Awareness's all-appearing wisdom—clear, without grasping;
<tantra> [15968] Awareness's all-clear wisdom—clear, spontaneously gathered."

<tantra> [15969] From the Self-Arisen:
<tantra> [15970] "The jeweled celestial palace is well-arranged;
<tantra> [15971] The jewel-variously-sprinkled queen is well-ornamented;
<tantra> [15972] The jewel-beautiful horse is swift;
<tantra> [15973] On the plain of various jewels, without exhaustion."
<tantra> [15974] Thus it is spoken.

[15974] The third: meaningful conclusion of the topic—
[15975] In the Buddha of indivisible Expanse and wisdom, the assembly of qualities is immeasurable.

<tantra> [15976] From the Jewel Display:
<tantra> [15977] "The measure of the miracles of the perfectly complete Buddha
<tantra> [15978] Is immeasurable,
<tantra> [15979] Ungraspable,
<tantra> [15980] Inestimable.
<tantra> [15981] Buddha-appearance transcends great-small extremes—like space;
<tantra> [15982] Buddha-power transcends is-isn't extremes—like an elephant;
<tantra> [15983] Buddha-potency transcends abandonment-attainment extremes—like a lion;
<tantra> [15984] Buddha-qualities transcend full-empty extremes—like a wish-fulfilling jewel;
<tantra> [15985] Buddha-essence transcends self-grasp extremes—all-pervasive wisdom itself;
<tantra> [15986] Buddha-abiding transcends faculties-objects—self-appearance itself;
<tantra> [15987] These are the words of self-arisen intention."

<tantra> [15988] From the Self-Arisen:
<tantra> [15989] "In the perfectly complete Buddha's intention, there is no final extreme;
<tantra> [15990] In Buddha-realization, there is no measure;
<tantra> [15991] In wisdom, there is no calculation;
<tantra> [15992] In the object, there is no good-bad;
<tantra> [15993] In view, there is no is-isn't;
<tantra> [15994] In the ground, there is no severance;
<tantra> [15995] In the path, there is no transfer-change;
<tantra> [15996] In the fruition, there is no return-to-cause;
<tantra> [15997] In wisdom, there is no clear-obscured;
<tantra> [15998] In wisdom, there is no mind."
<tantra> [15999] Thus it is spoken.

[15999] Buddha's own ground—having completely reached the limit of fruition, there is no path for oneself to traverse.
[16000] The Blessed Buddhas are explained as objects: path-transcending, entry-transcending, elaboration-transcending, and samsara-conducting-transcending.
[16001] Through the path of compassion guiding those to be trained, through kāyas,
[16002] Through wisdoms, and through activities manifesting externally,
[16003] This is explained as the "path of no-more-learning."

[16004] The third: establishing definitively the basis of manifestation of kāyas and wisdoms comprises two aspects:
<list> [16005] The basis of manifestation definitively determined;
<list> [16006] The nature extensively explained.

[16007] The first of these also comprises the actual basis of manifestation and
[16008] The refutation of mistaken views regarding it.

[16009] The first:
[16010] The Dharma-kāya of abandonment-realization's ultimate phenomena, the treasury of primordially pure spontaneous precious presence—this is the basis of manifestation of kāyas and wisdoms.
[16011] Its essence: self-arisen wisdom, empty-clarity, nowhere established, without division-making or divisions, without separation or opening, beyond expression, thought, or description—
[16012] Liberated from the extremes of samsara and nirvāṇa;
[16013] Like space, nowhere established, yet from it immeasurable qualities arise like sun, moon, planets, and stars—thus it becomes the basis of manifestation, called "wisdom-perfect kāya."

<tantra> [16014] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16015] "The Dharmatā of all Buddhas
<tantra> [16016] Is without opening, without dividing, in equality;
<tantra> [16017] How could words, expressions, names exist?
<tantra> [16018] The basis of reference self-pure, delusion pure,
<tantra> [16019] Samsara-nirvāṇa are not renowned as names.
<tantra> [16020] Without arising, without birth, without cessation,
<tantra> [16021] Universal-arising wisdom—what is not that?

<tantra> [16022] Thus,
<tantra> [16023] Dharmatā self-settled:
<tantra> [16024] Through elements' settlement, aggregates cease;
<tantra> [16025] Atoms and subtle-particles completely cease,
<tantra> [16026] Not even an atom's part abides.
<tantra> [16027] Through afflictions' settlement, delusion and
<tantra> [16028] Thought-free attachment do not abide;
<tantra> [16029] Latencies and all rising,
<tantra> [16030] Not even a particle abide.
<tantra> [16031] Thus through subtle-gross settlement,
<tantra> [16032] The five aggregates too become subtle at the limit;
<tantra> [16033] The four elements' body exhausted,
<tantra> [16034] All becomes wisdom-perfect kāya.
<tantra> [16035] Thought-free samādhi self-abides,
<tantra> [16036] Beyond fabricated dharmas;
<tantra> [16037] Therefore 'dharma' does not abide as word."
<tantra> [16038] Thus it is spoken.

[16039] The second comprises three aspects:
<list> [16040] Positing the assertions;
<list> [16041] Their refutation;
<list> [16042] Establishing the correct system.

[16043] The first:
[16044] Some early masters claim:
[16045] "At the time of perfect awakening, primordial purity is utterly unestablished anywhere, so there are no kāyas and wisdoms as phenomena, and no basis of manifestation."
[16046] Others claim:
[16047] "Kāyas and wisdoms truly abide, for without them, the result would not be obtained, or having obtained, would degenerate."

[16048] The refutation comprises two:
[16049] Reasoning and
[16050] Scriptural refutation.

[16051] According to the first position:
[16052] In the Buddha there is no wisdom, so self-benefit and other-benefit would not arise—
[16053] For there would be no difference from empty space where nothing exists.

[16054] According to the second position:
[16055] Like some substantialists, the Dharma-kāya would be truly established as a thing, as a mark—like a coarse inanimate object—
[16056] For form would be truly established in its own mark, and wisdom-appearance truly established, becoming indistinguishable from conception.

[16057] Scriptural refutation:
<tantra> [16058] From the Six Expanses:
<tantra> [16059] "Without the two wisdoms of knower and known,
<tantra> [16060] What difference from inanimate things?
<tantra> [16061] Or else, into extreme emptiness,
<tantra> [16062] This itself becomes change only."

<tantra> [16063] From the Lamp That Illuminates:
<tantra> [16064] "Thus, if there were no wisdom-aspect,
<tantra> [16065] What difference from external empty space?
<tantra> [16066] Distinction itself would exist;
<tantra> [16067] Therefore wisdom pervades from the ground.
<tantra> [16068] Without wisdom, there is cessation and
<tantra> [16069] No distinction whatsoever would occur;
<tantra> [16070] If gross wisdom existed,
<tantra> [16071] It would equal conception itself."
<tantra> [16072] Thus it is spoken.

[16073] The third: the correct system:
[16074] In the primordially pure own-face, nowhere established, transcending existence-non-existence extremes, kāyas and wisdoms are established—like a conch shell.
[16075] In that state or in a portion of the Expanse, the extremely subtle manifestation-basis aspect of wisdom abides threefold, like light within a crystal—though not an object of direct perception,
[16076] It abides as the basis of manifestation.
[16077] Through the existence of these three wisdoms, all kāyas and wisdoms arise as universal-arising;
[16078] And from that very Dharma-kāya, without moving, the power to manifest form-kāyas and activities for those to be trained also arises from that essential point.
[16079] If it were not so, having become a Buddha, one would be solely Dharma-kāya;
[16080] In that, without wisdom, there would be no benefit for sentient beings and no immeasurable Buddha-dharmas.

<tantra> [16081] From the Collection:
<tantra> [16082] "Without wisdom, qualities do not increase, nor awakening,
<tantra> [16083] And Buddha-dharmas like the ocean would become nonexistent."
<tantra> [16084] Thus it is spoken.

[16085] Those statements of "no wisdom" are negations of essence being anywhere established;
[16086] Statements of "wisdom exists" describe the aspect of spontaneous presence's nature—
[16087] Without contradiction, primordial purity and spontaneous presence are non-dual.

[16088] The second: extensively explained nature:
[16089] In the Dharma-kāya of primordially pure Expanse, wisdom of spontaneous presence abides as subtle nature;
[16090] In ground-abiding wisdom, it abides as truly subtle;
[16091] From that aspect arise the five mark-grasping wisdoms and
[16092] The wisdom knowing the extent of knowables—merely existing as the actual manifestation-basis aspect.

<tantra> [16093] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16094] "When mind itself is matured,
<tantra> [16095] In Dharma-kāya wisdom abides as ground;
<tantra> [16096] Through primordial purity, stains are exhausted,
<tantra> [16097] Essence primordially without delusion,
<tantra> [16098] Unceasing manifestation spontaneously present."
<tantra> [16099] Thus it is spoken.

[16100] In the Expanse of primordial purity, spontaneously abiding, essence, nature, and compassion-aspects appear as truly subtle;
[16101] Through these three ground-abiding wisdoms, other wisdoms' manifestation-bases are made.
<tantra> [16102] From that very text:
<tantra> [16103] "In liberated mind-as-it-is thus,
<tantra> [16104] Compassion is not absent;
<tantra> [16105] Through ground-abiding wisdom,
<tantra> [16106] Nature spontaneously manifests.
<tantra> [16107] Through mark-grasping wisdom,
<tantra> [16108] Conditions purify maturation;
<tantra> [16109] Through wisdom of knower and known,
<tantra> [16110] Gifts are given to the faithful."
<tantra> [16111] Thus it is spoken.

[16112] Regarding the manner in which the three ground-abiding wisdoms make manifestation-bases:
[16113] Essence makes the three kāyas' manifestation-basis, though the three kāyas are not established as truly separate in manifesting;
[16114] Nature makes the five lights' manifestation-basis, though colors are not established in their own marks;
[16115] Compassion makes the two wisdoms' manifestation-basis, though objects and aspects are not directly encountered.

<tantra> [16116] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16117] "Thus, essence abiding as kāya,
<tantra> [16118] Dharma, enjoyment, and emanation's manifestation,
<tantra> [16119] Without opening, without division-making,
<tantra> [16120] Established from descent alone, and
<tantra> [16121] Even more from that establishment,
<tantra> [16122] Kāya-colors and so forth are not objects of mind.
<tantra> [16123] Nature's manifesting, light's manner—
<tantra> [16124] White, red, yellow, green, and dark-blue,
<tantra> [16125] Not possessing mark-distinctions,
<tantra> [16126] Established through markless knowables' descent.
<tantra> [16127] From compassion's various manifestations,
<tantra> [16128] Not determined as singular thus,
<tantra> [16129] As various appearances, called 'ground.'"

<tantra> [16130] From the Six Expanses as well:
<tantra> [16131] "Through self-purification of aggregate-marks,
<tantra> [16132] Abiding as the ground of great depth-clarity;
<tantra> [16133] Empty through pervader and pervaded,
<tantra> [16134] Without extreme-cessation, appearing clearly,
<tantra> [16135] Manifesting aspect of clarity unceasing,
<tantra> [16136] Heart-essence of all gathered essence,
<tantra> [16137] Stainless and self-pure,
<tantra> [16138] Buddhas in great secret
<tantra> [16139] Abide as nature's aspect.
<tantra> [16140] From compassion's appearance-aspect,
<tantra> [16141] Emptiness-aspect without cessation,
<tantra> [16142] Into knowables' wisdom two,
<tantra> [16143] From appearance-aspect appearing thus,
<tantra> [16144] Through self-purity of non-existence,
<tantra> [16145] Spontaneous presence compassion-nature,
<tantra> [16146] Without deed-making effort,
<tantra> [16147] Without fabrication, in appearing manner,
<tantra> [16148] Without division-making, primordially appears.
<tantra> [16149] Like light from the sun,
<tantra> [16150] Not its own fabrication,
<tantra> [16151] Its own nature thus appears."
<tantra> [16152] Thus it is spoken.

<tantra> [16153] "Through compassion's wisdom-aspect
<tantra> [16154] Knowing the nature of things,
<tantra> [16155] Knowing one's own phenomena's object-pattern;
<tantra> [16156] Without that wisdom-aspect,
<tantra> [16157] What difference from the four elements' forms?
<tantra> [16158] Through compassion-wisdom
<tantra> [16159] Knowing the extent of knowables,
<tantra> [16160] Knowing the thoughts of those to be trained;
<tantra> [16161] Without this, like space itself,
<tantra> [16162] Therefore all-knowing wisdom
<tantra> [16163] Appears as compassion-aspect.
<tantra> [16164] All this is not held by recollection,
<tantra> [16165] From nature-abiding itself,
<tantra> [16166] Grasping and grasper do not grossly abide.
<tantra> [16167] Through subtle depth-clear appearance,
<tantra> [16168] This is sentient beings' path,
<tantra> [16169] Seed above expanding like a seed;
<tantra> [16170] This appearance unceasing,
<tantra> [16171] Like appropriate medicine's potency,
<tantra> [16172] Appears appropriately for the six families.
<tantra> [16173] Therefore this is compassion."
<tantra> [16174] Thus it is spoken.

[16175] Thus from the aspect of manifestation-basis, when emanated as emanation-kāya, the two wisdoms directly perform the benefit of the six families of those to be trained;
[16176] At this time, in primordial purity, they do not exist as real,
[16177] But merely abide as seeds.

<tantra> [16178] From the Six Expanses as well:
<tantra> [16179] "Essence, nature, and
<tantra> [16180] Compassion's appearances
<tantra> [16181] Appear for intelligent beings.
<tantra> [16182] Essence nowhere established,
<tantra> [16183] Nature's appearance-aspect clearly appears;
<tantra> [16184] From compassion-aspect, two wisdoms
<tantra> [16185] Arise without object and agent.
<tantra> [16186] Through two levels of appearance-mind,
<tantra> [16187] Wisdom's deeds are thus:
<tantra> [16188] Appearing free from effort and achievement,
<tantra> [16189] Buddhas' wisdom
<tantra> [16190] Primordially appears thus."
<tantra> [16191] Thus it is spoken.

[16192] Thus the ultimate Dharma-kāya of indivisible Expanse and wisdom—primordial purity and spontaneous presence non-dual liberation-ground, called "Great Primordial Purity"—
[16193] Though nature abides as manifestation-basis,
[16194] Nowhere established, the single ultimate truth, Great Perfection, Dharmatā like space, transcending kāyas and wisdoms—
[16195] The final fruition,
[16196] Great inner Expanse,
[16197] Liberation ground unsurpassed,
[16198] The vajra secret treasury of spontaneous precious presence, indivisible Body, Speech, and Mind.

<tantra> [16199] From Samantabhadra's Mind-Mirror:
<tantra> [16200] "In the Tathāgata's body there is no rising or abiding;
<tantra> [16201] Why is this?
<tantra> [16202] In the Tathāgata there is no kāya as real.
<tantra> [16203] In the Tathāgata's speech there is no turning or not-turning;
<tantra> [16204] Why is this?
<tantra> [16205] The Tathāgata's secret is empty.
<tantra> [16206] In the Tathāgata's mind there is no intending or not-intending;
<tantra> [16207] Why is this?
<tantra> [16208] In the Tathāgata's mind there is no thought."

<tantra> [16209] From the Heart Sūtra's Diamond Cutter as well:
<tantra> [16210] "Those who see me as form,
<tantra> [16211] Those who know me as sound,
<tantra> [16212] Have entered wrong abandonment;
<tantra> [16213] That person does not see me.
<tantra> [16214] Guides are Dharma-kāya,
<tantra> [16215] Dharmatā is not the knowable,
<tantra> [16216] That cannot be known."
<tantra> [16217] Thus it is spoken.

[16218] Prāsaṅgika Mādhyamikas assert the Buddha truly to be that completely pure, empty Dharma-kāya;
[16219] In one's own face, through the pacification of existence-non-existence elaborations, not even kāyas and wisdoms are established,
[16220] Yet for others appear form-kāyas and activities through Buddha-compassion and the prayers of those to be trained—
[16221] Like space-traveling wish-fulfilling trees, jewels, and wishing-trees.

<tantra> [16222] From the Entry:
<tantra> [16223] "The peaceful kāya appears clearly like a wishing-tree;
<tantra> [16224] Like a wish-fulfilling jewel, without conception,
<tantra> [16225] Worldly benefit and happiness always bestowed,
<tantra> [16226] Liberating beings until existence's end—
<tantra> [16227] This is appearance free from elaboration."
<tantra> [16228] Thus it is spoken.

[16229] Here too, though similar to that primordially pure own-face,
[16230] From subtle wisdom existing in the Expanse, kāyas and wisdoms manifest,
[16231] And through that directly perform the benefit of those whose prayers were made for beings to become Buddhas;
[16232] Through the distinction of spontaneous presence from essence-aspect, the special quality of not considering them produced by causal prayers is distinguished.
[16233] These are crucial essential points of primordially pure fruition; intelligent persons should understand them with extremely subtle wisdom.
