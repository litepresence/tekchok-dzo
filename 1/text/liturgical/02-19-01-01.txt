[6414] First there must be a cause.
[6415] If cause exists, conditioned and impermanent, destroyed again—unsuitable for good or bad in actions.


### PAGE 151

[6416] Without returning place, the coming of numberless sentient being aggregates is unsuitable.
[6417] If that mind were various, self-other thoughts suddenly coming to realms is unsuitable.
[6418] Through mutual intermixing,
[6419] Self-conquest,
[6420] Non-death,
[6421] Absence of suffering,
[6422] Possession of retinue and enjoyments bringing happiness,
[6423] Defeat of others and all shared perceptions coming uniformly is unsuitable.
[6424] If they were different,
[6425] Since many realms exist,
[6426] It would be suitable for some to come with agreement with others through self-defeat, happiness, and so forth.
[6427] If one only thinks, would all die through one dying,
[6428] Or would all be born through one being born?
[6429] Thus, examining and searching one's own mind through the door of many aspects with the controversy of one and different,
[6430] Finding nothing is realizing with the power of wisdom the meaning of primordial purity of dharmata.
[6431] Mind having no cause, return is impossible—boundless faith in accumulation of actions.
[6432] Mind having cause, result must come.
[6433] If result is samsara, impure, liberation is impossible.
[6434] If transcended, samsara's coming is unsuitable.
[6435] If both,
[6436] Samsara and nirvana being different, mind also becomes different.
[6437] If different,
[6438] Like body and mind being different, desires gathered in one family of memory-thought would become many different—from
[6439] Knowing through gathering in one family.
[6440] Moreover: if mind has no cause, these minds are unsuitable.
[6441] These do not arise from mind's cause, for they are not intelligence.
[6442] Not arising from mind, there is no failure to realize mind's mere dwelling in itself.
[6443] These birth,
[6444] Death,
[6445] Abiding, and so forth neither exhaust
[6446] Nor increase—
[6447] From scripture:
[6448] "In this ignorance-illusion wheel, no exhaustion, no increase."
[6449] And:
[6450] "The nature of the realm of beings also has no end."
[6451] Thus said.
[6452] Thus, through causelessness, know increase not existing in mind.
[6453] 


### PAGE 152

[6454] Through non-increase, know non-birth.
[6455] Through non-birth, know non-death.
[6456] Knowing that, know also no evil in actions.
[6457] From the Condensed:
[6458] "This pair of existence and non-existence is the dharma of non-existence."
[6459] Thus, knowing self-empty from primordial beginning,
[6460] "How could beings be born, being pure from the beginning?"
[6461] Thus it is said.
[6462] Moreover, mind is conditionless:
[6463] If it existed, like appearances appearing variously, mind also would become various in color, etc., through conditions.
[6464] Mind having become different, memory-thought is unsuitable as one.
[6465] If mind had conditions, it would certainly be destroyed—
[6466] Concluding no action-result in mind.
[6467] Even if mind ceases, if its action exists,
[6468] This is greatly contradictory,
[6469] Equal to saying that body's color, sense-bases, good and bad all dwell even when body ceases.
[6470] Thus, clear through mere dwelling like illusion.
[6471] If conditionless, from what does this various memory-thought now arise?
[6472] This present memory-thought does not arise from conditions—
[6473] Like happiness and holding as true upon finding yesterday's dream jewel,
[6474] When waking, nothing exists.
[6475] Even though now's memory-thought is held as true and attached, after that nothing exists—there is no establishment from circumstance's true-false-like appearance.
[6476] For example: like sky's various clouds suddenly gathering, without trace of where they went, suddenly dissolving,
[6477] Though clouds do not exist in sky, they appear in its nature.
[6478] Though conditions and causes do not exist in mind, like appearing appearances, at the time of appearing, cause and condition do not exist—certain of non-existence through examination of one, many, and three times.
[6479] From the Root of Wisdom:
[6480] "From seed ceased and not ceased,
[6481] Sprout's birth does not exist.
[6482] You have shown all dharmas
[6483] Arising like illusions."
[6484] "The fifth condition is non-existent."
[6485] Thus said.
[6486] Also from the All-Creating:
[6487] 
[6488] 


### PAGE 153

[6489] "The supreme path of peace without cause and condition."
[6490] Thus explained, and so forth.
[6491] Therefore, if mind exists,
[6492] Does entity possess form,
[6493] Or exist formlessly?
[6494] It does not possess form—for if it existed, it would be suitable for sense-power's direct perception; clear through valid cognition of direct perception not observing the suitable-for-seeing.
[6495] If it exists formlessly, how is it known?
[6496] If known through movement,
[6497] That movement is merely needed, direction-part,
[6498] And past-future-present three meeting—unestablished through examination.
[6499] If former movement and present movement meet, the meeting-part's former memory-thought would need to exist now without ceasing;
[6500] If it existed, this contradicts being former.
[6501] If present's former and that part cease, and they do not meet, present memory-thought would have no cause—movement is unsuitable, thus stopped.
[6502] Is movement one or different?
[6503] If one, the becoming-various is lost;
[6504] If different, since move-maker is one, it is lost.
[6505] Thus, mind's existence is unestablished,
[6506] Realizing like rootless sky.
[6507] Birth and birth-basis not existing, no returning place.
[6508] Place not existing, memory-thought before-after interval facing-introduces, dissolving there—recognizing no basis in mind.
[6509] Knowing that, faith in no returning place.
[6510] Knowing that, deciding upon the great namelessness of three realms.
[6511] Through that dharma, mind's ease without benefit-harm of virtuous and vicious actions.
[6512] Moreover, appearance-knowing before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6513] Recognizing mind's non-establishment as cause and characteristic.
[6514] Knowing that, faith in no identifying-grasping of mind's emptiness itself.
[6515] Believing that, deciding mind does not arise from causes and conditions.
[6516] Through that dharma, mind's ease without benefit-harm from sudden memory-thoughts' thoughts.
[6517] Moreover, mind's ease.
[6518] Moreover, mind before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6519] Recognizing no root in mind.
[6520] Knowing that, faith in no different elaborations in mind's single wheel.
[6521] Believing that, deciding buddhahood not achieved through fabricated dharmas.


### PAGE 154

[6522] Cutting that, mind's ease without failure to realize from non-existent mind's meaning.
[6523] Moreover, dharmata before-after interval facing-introduces,
[6524] Recognizing no birth in mind.
[6525] Knowing that, faith that propensities are not harmed by body's all-ground.
[6526] Believing that, deciding mind's birth impossible now.
[6527] Through that dharma, mind's ease without returning place and returning-support, mind's house ceasing.
[6528] Thus, through grasping the measure of four times of mind-searching,
[6529] Buddha not existing, buddha also not even name-only.
[6530] Mind turning from holding hope for results.
[6531] That turning, no dharmas making path effort-exertion.
[6532] Thus, non-existent dharma having nothing, called "liberation's measure" through not finding meaning from mere names designated as samsara-nirvana.
[6533] Therefore, mind itself non-existent having nothing,
[6534] Mind having no cause-reason, not seen,
[6535] Thus turning four face-introducings of non-existence, and
[6536] Realizing sixteen dharma-possessors
[6537] Is destroying mind's house.
[6538] Like child's house built and destroyed;
[6539] Like that: action destroys action, iron destroys iron;
[6540] Impermanent destroys impermanent, like illusion-person destroys illusion-city;
[6541] Made destroys impermanent, like corpse stacked on corpse;
[6542] Impermanent destroys made, like present wisdom destroys former ignorance.
[6543] Thus, mind destroying mind, both dissolve without track, like letters written on water;
[6544] Not-exist seeking not-exist also not finding, like no finding-place though searching for wish-fulfilling jewel not existing in poor house.
[6545] Non-existent mind having no place to destroy
[6546] Is like no holding-place in water when dissolving.
[6547] Therefore, not knowing non-existent mind's meaning,
[6548] Searching mind for view-meditation-conduct


### PAGE 155

[6549] Great bliss liberation's doctrine finding-time not-exists—
[6550] Like boat sinking, entering water.
[6551] Non-existent mind's existing-support itself deceives and binds—thus said.
[6552] From Samantabhadra's Heart Mirror:
[6553] "Desiring appearance as dharmakaya is obstruction to me."
[6554] "Desiring whatever-appears as mind is obstruction to me."
[6555] "Desiring self-arising as other is obstruction to me."
[6556] Thus said.
[6557] Then: does "mind dissolving" mean existing becomes non-existent?
[6558] Dissolving: as before, unestablished through examination;
[6559] Even unexamined, from sudden memory-thoughts' thought dissolving,
[6560] Mind's self-continuum does not go from existence to non-existence.
[6561] Dissolve-cause and dissolve-condition nowhere exist.
[6562] Then: is destroying mind's house purposeless, since nothing to destroy?
[6563] To primordially non-existent mind,
[6564] Only making realize non-existent nature—
[6565] Not that mind's house's basis or entity exists.
[6566] Memory's source having gone to dharmata,
[6567] Making understand non-existence,
[6568] Conventionally called "destroying house."
[6569] Destroying the existent—nothing whatsoever.
[6570] Therefore, placing above whatever-appears object-vital-point of appearance—the so-called "term's result"—
[6571] Inert appearance without grasping there, result of non-dual object-mind;
[6572] Placing above whatever-knowing moves,
[6573] Mind's house self-destroying, movement-thought-liberated result;
[6574] Thus, identifying non-dual inert-knowing union wisdom's dissolving place, non-existent result.
[6575] Thus, result-three's times also upon four vital-points of dissolving-time facing-introduction,
[6576] Know sixteen non-existent dharmas as before.
[6577] This also: from Great Secret Certain Heart-Essence's Cutting-Through—mind primordially non-existent, self-liberated;
[6578] Movement sudden, primordially liberated;
[6579] Instruction other and mind ultimately non-existent;
[6580] Pretending conventionally existent.


### PAGE 156

[6581] Two: making path through view and meditation upon mind.
[6582] Though merely self-liberating, self-dawning, self-placing may seem discordant,
[6583] The meaning is not discordant:
[6584] Here, making primordially non-existent, and
[6585] Elsewhere desiring non-existence of the existent—thus.
[6586] Also union:
[6587] Desiring union where two existents connect one-to-one elsewhere, and
[6588] Here, no cause to enter union through primordial non-existence,
[6589] Non-existent essence having no different distinction—two not different, thus called "non-dual union."
[6590] This vital point, most crucial among all vehicles, extremely important and crucial:
[6591] From this, not desiring appearance as mind, and
[6592] Showing the great basis of buddhahood not experienced as existent mind.
[6593] Depending on this, face-introducing appearance as mind, and
[6594] Face-introducing mind itself as empty—know this as Heart Essence instruction intention.
[6595] If some instructions thus arise possibly, decide they are merely provisional below, not definitive meaning.
[6596] Third: objects appearing in mind's mirror dawning, aggregates six pervading expansive great equality:
[6597] Outer various appearances,
[6598] Inner sudden memory-thoughts,
[6599] All powers six appearances with objects,
[6600] Merely clear appearance of non-existence.
[6601] In meaning, nowhere outer-inner, like cataract-hairlines,
[6602] Illusion,
[6603] Eye-magic,
[6604] Emanation—appearing in mind although,
[6605] Know transcending exist-not-exist extremes from the very time of appearing.
[6606] From appearance's side, however designated, not contradictory;
[6607] Allow "is,"
[6608] Allow "is not,"
[6609] Allow "exists,"
[6610] Allow "not exists,"
[6611] Allow "appears,"
[6612] Allow "empty,"
[6613] Allow "deluded,"
[6614] Allow "liberated,"
[6615] Allow "good,"
[6616] Allow "bad,"
[6617] Allow "mind,"
[6618] Allow "other"—
[6619] However designated,
[6620] From empty's side, empty first by that itself which designates.
[6621] Designation is mind,
[6622] Mind is non-existent,
[6623] Like dream actions and illusion actions—no maker for non-existence.
[6624] 


### PAGE 157

[6625] Virtue, non-virtue, etc.—that itself sudden.
[6626] That essence: basisless, self-liberated.
[6627] Awareness's primordial tone exists in part—if identified, intention's dharmata direction has nowhere else to grasp.
[6628] All appearance-existence samsara-nirvana dharmas—great appearance of clear appearance of non-existence in awareness's nature, self-dawning, self-appearing:
[6629] Like four elements' appearances dwelling in sky's nature,
[6630] Like various dreams and sleep,
[6631] Not moving from sleep-awareness's nature.
[6632] Although all self-appear in awareness's nature,
[6633] Awareness does not see delusion-appearance samsara,
[6634] Does not see pure appearance transcended,
[6635] Samsara-nirvana does not see awareness.
[6636] All, unmoving in basisless great equal nature,
[6637] Transcending seer and seen through non-establishment of essence,
[6638] Dawning from awareness's nature—merely designated "samsara-nirvana awareness's self-tone or play."
[6639] Great liberation from exist-not-exist extremes,
[6640] Designation not contradictory,
[6641] Not established in meaning.
[6642] All appearance-existence samsara-nirvana dharmas dawn as merely clear appearance of non-existence.
[6643] From Space Six:
[6644] "To mind itself without stain,
[6645] Appearance separate from object-conditions
[6646] Is called 'great self-pure intention'—
[6647] Samantabhadra I have shown."
[6648] From Jewel Display:
[6649] "Entity of complete non-existence,
[6650] Not falling in any direction,
[6651] Entity of whatever delusion—
[6652] Merely appearing as harmonious appearance,
[6653] Yet that meaning does not arise,
[6654] Appearance like dharmadhatu ornament.
[6655] Great emptiness wisdom
[6656] Deludes from complete non-existence—"
[6657] From Pearl Garland:
[6658] "That is I, that is beings,
[6659] That is mind, arisen from mind,
[6660] Not many, singularly one,
[6661] Samsara-nirvana is myself,
[6662] Mandalas etc. are gradual entry,
[6663] Dharmas, appearing as dharmas,
[6664] Abiding, moving,
[6665] Sitting, sleeping, lying,
[6666] Life, also cutting,
[6667] Three worlds arise from that.
[6668] Briefly: as appears,
[6669] All dharmas arise from that—
[6670] Earth, water, fire, wind, space,
[6671] Great elements arise from that."
[6672] 
[6673] 
[6674] 
[6675] 


### PAGE 158

[6676] Thus to dwelling dharmata:
[6677] Delusion not-existing from the beginning,
[6678] In dharmakaya like sky,
[6679] Obscured by sudden beings' clouds.
[6680] Also non-deluded dwelling dharmata
[6681] Appears in mind as deluded manner.
[6682] Beings' five afflictions themselves:
[6683] In meaning, they do not exist—
[6684] Like clouds in sky,
[6685] Sudden, with conditions,
[6686] Clouds arise from sky itself.
[6687] Knowing thus dissolve into sky,
[6688] Called "non-different one nature."
[6689] Thus afflictions' stains themselves,
[6690] Knowing self-arising, self-ceasing,
[6691] How could beings be bound?
[6692] Appearance-manner unestablished like
[6693] Appearing as grasping, yet nowhere established—
[6694] Shown also as great placelessness.
[6695] From Heap of Jewels:
[6696] "This mind itself without dwelling place,
[6697] Without going place, wondrous!
[6698] To six minds entering all,
[6699] Without depending place, wondrous!
[6700] To all-gathering all-ground,
[6701] Without placing place, wondrous!
[6702] To circling-deluding ignorance,
[6703] Without changing power, wondrous!
[6704] To all object-attaching afflictions,
[6705] Without basis-root, wondrous!
[6706] To subtle and coarse stains,
[6707] Without grasping place, wondrous!
[6708] To coarse elemental forms,
[6709] Without placing place, wondrous!
[6710] To person's depending life-breath,
[6711] Without time-setting, wondrous!
[6712] To six aggregates' object appearances,
[6713] Without permanence, wondrous!
[6714] To person's arisen memory-thought feelings,
[6715] Without exhaustion, wondrous!"
[6716] "This basisless dharmata—
[6717] Great wonder, placed without searching!
[6718] To going-coming awareness—
[6719] Great wonder, without end!
[6720] To primordially dwelling great wisdom—
[6721] Great wonder, without antidote!"
[6722] Also from Arya Samadhi Raja, common vehicle:
[6723] "How in mid-space, little cloudless,
[6724] Momentarily cloud mandala appears,
[6725] Arising-ceasing, that cloud mandala—
[6726] Examine from what first it arose!
[6727] Know all dharmas thus.
[6728] How person dwells in rock mountain hollow,
[6729] From singing, speaking, laughing, crying,
[6730] Echoes arise depending on conditions,
[6731] Yet that tone from sound never moves.
[6732] Know all dharmas thus."
[6733] Extensively said.
[6734] Second meaning: face-introducing foundation primordial wisdom without move-change, copper-shining dharma-exhaust mind-transcend intention—three:
[6735] 
[6736] 
[6737] 
[6738] 
[6739] 


### PAGE 159

[6740] Direct face-introduction of copper-shining awareness through dharma-exhaustion and mind-transcendence:
[6741] Maintain the intention of self-clear nature-abiding in great pervasion-expansion,
[6742] Place the three vital points of dharmata's wheel in the great sky-equal space-clarity.
[6743] First:
[6744] Just place self-settled awareness in self-clarity,
[6745] Not sending outward,
[6746] Not gathering inward,
[6747] Look at self-nature without thinking in-between—
[6748] Outer, inner, and middle: non-existent;
[6749] Self-clear foundation:
[6750] Dharmakaya not confused by view-meditation,
[6751] Primordial wisdom not moved by concepts,
[6752] Intention not fabricated by elaboration-gathering;
[6753] In clarity: thought non-existent;
[6754] In abiding: grasping non-existent;
[6755] In vastness: losing non-existent;
[6756] In equality: interval non-existent.
[6757] Great self-tone without entering-maker;
[6758] Great great intention self-settled from primordial time:
[6759] Tone and empty like ocean,
[6760] Clear and pure like sun and moon,
[6761] Vast and pervading like sky,
[6762] Stable and abiding like king of mountains.
[6763] This meaning and all beings: though existing primordially in self, not experiencing separation even for a moment,
[6764] Yet through face-not-knowing, mixed in samsara by bad thought elaborations—
[6765] Now, through lama's instruction identifying, whether dawning or dwelling or whatever, just as face-introduction to self-settled place nature, make only nature-not-wandering.
[6766] From Lion Perfection:
[6767] E ma: path that lion crosses not;
[6768] Lion of action-effort non-existent:
[6769] To white snow of release-place non-existent,
[6770] Powers three of cleared darkness perfect.
[6771] I, lion of thought-non-existent tone:
[6772] To good snow of primordial purity, stain-not,
[6773] Powers three of cleared element perfect.
[6774] Thus said, and:
[6775] From Six Spaces:
[6776] To mind-itself of permanent-cease non-existent:
[6777] Appearance of separation from good-bad:
[6778] Intention of separation from abandon-accept—
[6779] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6780] To mind-itself of accept-reject non-existent:
[6781] Appearance of self-liberation direction-non-existent—
[6782] Intention of great pervasion-expansion—
[6783] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6784] To mind-itself of dull-excitement non-existent:
[6785] Meditation of great release-equal—
[6786] Intention of six aggregates spontaneous—
[6787] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6788] To mind-itself of concern non-existent:
[6789] Appearance of separation from hope-doubt—
[6790] Intention of primordial place, confidence-possessing—
[6791] I, Samantabhadra, show.
[6792] Thus said.


### PAGE 160

[6793] From Perfection:
[6794] This dharma-nature, entity-separate, grasping-attachment non-existent—
[6795] Buddhas' intention dharma of non-duality;
[6796] Particular emptiness and signs' word path,
[6797] Dharma-nature of action-effort non-existent, pure in self-place;
[6798] Complete samadhi, entering from dharma-nature object.
[6799] Pure and impure: term dharmas non-existent;
[6800] Meaning primordially dwelling, transcending one and two;
[6801] Self-body in nature, entering single bindu;
[6802] Time non-existent realization: samadhi not-wandering clear;
[6803] Extreme and center non-existent: dharma-nature name-separate;
[6804] Change not: straight, pervading all;
[6805] Made not: spontaneously accomplished in arising place.
[6806] Thus it is said.
[6807] Second: maintaining that nature has three:
[6808] Maintaining view-meditation object-transcending great,
[6809] Maintaining samadhi self-settled great,
[6810] Maintaining intention mind-transcending great.
[6811] First:
[6812] In that face-introduction nature, without mind-grasping effort and purpose-meditation antidote entering—place awareness vast wide, primordially placed, height-top vast, interval non-existent, self-liberated.
[6813] From Jewel Display:
[6814] Vast: dharma-nature completely pure;
[6815] Great: view wonderful great;
[6816] Appearance face: mandala self-appearance itself;
[6817] Object and object-non-existent: completely pure;
[6818] Outer and inner non-existent: completely appear;
[6819] Empty and not-empty: transcending words.
[6820] Thus said, and:
[6821] From Lion Perfection:
[6822] To whatever place the first place is,
[6823] The last goes to that place;
[6824] Now: dwell in that meaning.
[6825] Thus said, and:
[6826] Also:
[6827] In sky of grasping-thought non-existent,
[6828] In sky of consciousness non-existent—
[6829] Consciousness mind unmoved:
[6830] Supreme samadhi of non-wandering,
[6831] Single Buddha grove manner.
[6832] Thus it is said.
[6833] Second has three:
[6834] Self-dwelling just-place:
[6835] Without making grasping-elaboration on aggregate-object appearance, outer-inner-middle non-existent, wide, self-liberated, vast place—
[6836] Even when going to sleep, sleeping in that nature, dreams dawn in clear light.
[6837] Great thunder is:


### PAGE 161

[6838] Identifying the nature: three doors spontaneously released, whatever dawns suddenly hit, self-liberated, vast vast gone.
[6839] Appearance expansion:
[6840] Body cross-legged, eyes staring at interval appearance,
[6841] Cut mind's sending-gathering, identify half-pure awareness nature—bind five winds to space,
[6842] Self-appearance pure clear light: outer smoke, mirage, rainbow light, etc., and inner dharma-nature empty clear appearance pure like dawn.
[6843] From Six Spaces:
[6844] Train thus in three samadhis:
[6845] Self-dwelling just-place samadhi:
[6846] Not stopping power doors,
[6847] Not using body actions,
[6848] Not abandoning sleep,
[6849] Not cutting apart with mind—
[6850] Brief: body speech in self-place,
[6851] Mind-arising parts outward not lost;
[6852] To power objects six,
[6853] Know-awareness action: mind unmoved;
[6854] To self-appearance not-thinking great,
[6855] Clear thought-non-existent: experience arises.
[6856] Great thunder samadhi:
[6857] Body from ordinary like,
[6858] Speech separate from spoken words,
[6859] Mind not bound tight,
[6860] Self-dawn to self: not wandering.
[6861] Appearance expand samadhi:
[6862] By body and object and awareness,
[6863] Grasp all pure self-appearance measures.
[6864] Thus it is said.
[6865] Third: maintaining intention mind-transcending has four:
[6866] Mountain just-place view,
[6867] Ocean just-place intention,
[6868] Awareness just-place instruction,
[6869] Appearance just-place method.
[6870] First:
[6871] Identify this self-clear awareness, whatever dawns—place in nature without move-change like mountain king view.
[6872] From Letter Non-Existent:
[6873] Mountain just-place view: secret itself;
[6874] Not doubt: change by nature non-existent.
[6875] Thus it is said.
[6876] Second:
[6877] Body cross-legged,
[6878] Eyes ha-re placed at interval appearance,
[6879] Clear place in nature like ocean unmoved by waves—half-pure consciousness.


### PAGE 162

[6880] From That Itself:
[6881] The intention of ocean just-place:
[6882] Not appearance, yet makes appear;
[6883] Not empty, yet not existent as empty;
[6884] Not clear, yet object of great clarity;
[6885] Not dull, excitement by nature non-existent.
[6886] Unmoved, immovable, not becoming moved;
[6887] Unstirred, not stirring, transcending all stirring—
[6888] See great method of place: not arisen by making;
[6889] Nature of just-place one: not making send-gather.
[6890] Not dwelling: no transcendence from that;
[6891] To ocean-like secret primordial wisdom,
[6892] Primordially spontaneously vast: unmoved, place in space.
[6893] From great ocean depth difficult to measure,
[6894] See peak of victory banner never setting;
[6895] Empty mind non-existent: great body not made,
[6896] By non-making conquer all making;
[6897] Just-place itself: primordially unarisen, unmade,
[6898] Appearance unchanged: not made by mind.
[6899] Dharma-nature dwell in sky: intention shown;
[6900] Dharmakaya primordial wisdom: completely abandon thought;
[6901] If no move-make: intention of meditation.
[6902] If not grasping appear-object and focus-direction,
[6903] Like planet-star dawning in ocean depth—
[6904] Grasping not on object, clear part not ceasing:
[6905] Thus is self-arisen intention dwell manner.
[6906] Thus it is said.
[6907] Third:
[6908] Identify wide wide wide self-clear foundation naked burst of clear-empty awareness primordial wisdom—cut samadhi mind-attachment mistake place, copper-shining foundation dharmakaya dawns from within.
[6909] From Lion Perfection: looking outward to many self-know objects—
[6910] Great thought-non-existent dharmakaya found within.
[6911] Thus it is said.
[6912] Fourth:
[6913] When widely looking at outer five-object appearance, place in nature of clear clear foundation self-clear dawning from within.
[6914] From That Itself:
[6915] Looking outward to awareness-clear dharmata object—
[6916] See inside awareness of separation from various.
[6917] Thus said, and:
[6918] From Letter Non-Existent:


### PAGE 163

[6919] Great method of appearance just-place awareness:
[6920] Appearance great: not basis of all;
[6921] Appear like five element Buddhas' path;
[6922] Five greats: mother itself clear as appearance;
[6923] In not-wandering nature: place great grasping-non-existent.
[6924] Thus it is said.
[6925] Third: placing three vital points of dharmata's wheel in great sky-equal space-clarity has three:
[6926] Instruction placing mind itself action-separate by nature of dharmata's separation from effort-exertion;
[6927] Instruction concepts dawning as primordial wisdom by vital point of dharmata's self-direct introduction;
[6928] Instruction appearance non-existent refute-establish by vital point of dharmata's liberation from self-place.
[6929] First:
[6930] That nature separate from action: not realized by action, realized by non-action place—place three doors self-settled vast.
[6931] From Thalgyur:
[6932] Also other action-separate dharmata:
[6933] Liberate-to liberate by action non-existent.
[6934] Thus said, and:
[6935] From Great Garuda:
[6936] Therefore if samsara-nirvana action-action itself separate,
[6937] What other doing exists from this great perfection?
[6938] Thus said, and:
[6939] From Six Objects:
[6940] Basis place by separating from action.
[6941] Second:
[6942] Face-introduce appearance as mind's play;
[6943] Face-introduce play basis-non-existent clear appearance;
[6944] Face-introduce as delusion if grasp clear appearance;
[6945] Face-introduce self-clear non-existent appearance by non-grasping—decide outer object appearance and mind other-to non-established, empty object of samsara birth.
[6946] Also face-introduce appearance-grasping mind that basis-non-existent;
[6947] Face-introduce basis-non-existent empty self-course;
[6948] Face-introduce self-course track-non-existent primordially liberated—
[6949] Circle-maker self-mind liberated basis-non-existent, echo in three realms name-non-existent dharmata.
[6950] From Perfection:
[6951] Nature dharma-nature peace: perception object-to non-existent;
[6952] Entity non-existent itself: appearance self-search self-appearance;
[6953] Self meaning dharma-nature: appearance mind separate;
[6954] Look self object: not making send-gather.
[6955] Thus it is said.
[6956] Here some face-introduce appearance to mind.


### PAGE 164

[6957] Face-introduce mind to empty, and
[6958] From decorated face-introduction:
[6959] E ma ho: by face-introducing appearance to mind, complete to mind;
[6960] By face-introducing mind itself to empty, spread happiness to empty;
[6961] By face-introducing empty to awareness—
[6962] That only dharmakaya, awareness itself and space non-dual, appears to attach words to meaning self-characteristic.
[6963] This has intended basis,
[6964] Need purpose,
[6965] Actually harm-making valid cognition—three exist, not approaching heart-essence intention direction.
[6966] Intended basis:
[6967] For provisional purpose of grasping outer object meaning not other-to, those words said;
[6968] From Self-Arising:
[6969] Sometimes show appearance to mind.
[6970] Thus it is said.
[6971] That also: designate from only appearance to deluded mind, appearance not other-to.
[6972] Need purpose: only abandon attachment to outer objects.
[6973] Actually harm-making:
[6974] If appearance is mind, mind would be certain color shape etc. by eye etc. powers, for appearance certain as form etc. shape and color; and
[6975] Appearance mind,
[6976] Mind empty,
[6977] Empty awareness—if these three, from mutual mixing:
[6978] Conclude awareness to delusion, and
[6979] Conclude appearance not seen by eye etc., and
[6980] Conclude mind not deluded—
[6981] For these three essence substance one.
[6982] This distinction explained in detail before, and
[6983] Not liberating by making appearance mind yoga,
[6984] From Self-Arising:
[6985] Appearance mind yoga:
[6986] All arise from my mind;
[6987] What doing exists if mind itself realized?
[6988] All expressing that word—
[6989] I said not liberated.
[6990] By that scripture also harm, and
[6991] Conclude appearance non-existent when realizing mind non-existent;
[6992] From conclude appearance ceasing at time mind ceases,
[6993] Also harm from appearance existing at mind non-existent occasion.
[6994] To mind non-existent occasion: five exist.
[6995] From Middle Extremes:


### PAGE 165

[6996] Mind non-existent: sleep and faint,
[6997] Absorption entering: two,
[6998] Always perception non-existent.
[6999] Thus it is said.
[7000] Briefly gathered:
[7001] This desiring appearance as mind—great darkness of wrong thought—needs clearing.
[7002] Third: instruction appearance non-existent refute-establish by vital point of dharmata self-place liberated:
[7003] Outer five objects non-existent empty self-pure like water moon: purify not needed;
[7004] Inner mind memory thought self-dissolve track-non-existent: destroy not by effort exertion two antidotes;
[7005] Appearance mind primordially liberated spontaneous: abandon-accept superimpose not needed.
[7006] To naked copper-shining awareness: not putting elaboration garment, complete complete complete, track-non-existent equal great, releasing inside—
[7007] Enter freeing to self-arisen primordial tone of five doors.
[7008] That also: burst awareness foundation naked, self-clear essence inner,
[7009] From that nature: know as self-tone of self-arisen primordial wisdom, distinguish-non-existent whatever dawns of memory thought good bad, not follow track.
[7010] Appearance mind rough not rough,
[7011] Clear not clear,
[7012] In this that manner, releasing to vast pervasion—self-dawn in Samantabhadra's intention space.
[7013] From Six Spaces:
[7014] Great self-appearance of all beings;
[7015] Place not existent for search from other;
[7016] By self power, self-knowing—
[7017] From wherever three-thousand world,
[7018] That itself: search also, find place non-existent.
[7019] Action object of all worlds:
[7020] That itself to appearance nature,
[7021] See not-existent by whoever—
[7022] Bliss field of appearance nature.
[7023] By yogi meditating this:
[7024] Body of I, Samantabhadra,
[7025] This one possessing fortune sees.
[7026] Thus said, and:
[7027] Also:
[7028] When self-dawning condition thought to object,
[7029] Knowing this all nature non-existent—
[7030] All appearances illusion or
[7031] Like dream and reflection,
[7032] Great reflection experience not-thinking—
[7033] That dawning in whoever's continuum:
[7034] All appearances thunder,
[7035] Appearance condition not dawning to continuum,
[7036] Obtain outward-not-returning samadhi.
[7037] Thus said, and:


### PAGE 166

[7038] From Letter Non-Existent:
[7039] All arising: delusion appearance my mind;
[7040] All abiding: delusion appearance my heart;
[7041] All appearing: delusion appearance my body;
[7042] All sounding: delusion appearance my speech.
[7043] Seeing not-ceasing: appear like my form;
[7044] Hearing not-ceasing: sound like my sound;
[7045] Smelling not-ceasing: feel like my smell;
[7046] Tasting not-ceasing: tone like my taste;
[7047] Feeling not-ceasing: quick like my mind;
[7048] Secret afflictions: my miracles;
[7049] Buddhas beings: my cemetery;
[7050] All-making I: great self-clear appearance.
[7051] Thus it is said.
[7052] Then: if allowing delusion appearance to self-place release, will delusion not go again?
[7053] Although ordinary beings delude by grasping as self,
[7054] Yogis: by knowing basis-non-existent, not delude by placing self-settled without correcting-changing.
[7055] From Pearl Garland:
[7056] Those beings in samsara
[7057] Bind by self concepts' actions;
[7058] Certain liberate by knowing nature non-existent.
[7059] Thus it is said.
[7060] Also: delusion and liberation rely on inner knowing,
[7061] For outer appearance makes no delusion and liberation—
[7062] Enough to place appearance straight.
[7063] By Tilopa:
[7064] Appearance not bind; grasping binds—
[7065] Cut grasping, Naropa.
[7066] Thus the instruction.
[7067] That also: only placing self-know that actual meaning in self-tone nature,
[7068] Not correctable to good by purposefully corrected view-meditation-action, for nature unchangeable, and
[7069] For self-arisen primordial wisdom becomes not true.
[7070] From Perfection:
[7071] By thought not find primordial wisdom meaning;
[7072] By thought finding primordial wisdom meaning—
[7073] Self-arisen primordial wisdom becomes false.
[7074] By meditation not see dharmakaya;
[7075] By meditation seeing dharmakaya—
[7076] Self-appearance dharmata becomes false.
[7077] By looking not realize awareness meaning;
[7078] By looking realizing awareness meaning—
[7079] Ceaseless dharmakaya becomes false.
[7080] By dharma not cut ignorance trace;
[7081] By dharma cutting ignorance trace—
[7082] Primordially pure primordial wisdom becomes false.
[7083] Thus it is said.
[7084] Thus: whatever conduct manner made, not transcend dharmata by realizing appear-know to dharmata.


### PAGE 167

[7085] Whatever appearance manner appears: dawn in play non-ceasing,
[7086] Dawn in mandala of self-arisen meaning.
[7087] Eating-drinking: dharmata approaching;
[7088] Sleeping-sitting: enlightenment accomplishing;

[7103] Self-dawn realization of aggregate six object appearance.
[7104] Spontaneously accomplished in great intention of three realms completely liberated.
[7105] From Pearl Garland:
[7106] E ma: thus all appearances—
[7107] If delusion itself self-liberates,
[7108] By what non-existent delusion not liberate?
[7109] All speaking and doing actions:
[7110] Conduct of empty-aware clarity.
[7111] Good and bad thoughts:
[7112] Meditation is great river space;
[7113] Wrong view, right desire:
[7114] View of yogi without distinction;
[7115] Hope and doubt grasping:
[7116] Result copper spontaneously arisen;
[7117] Desiring apparent mahamudra:
[7118] Eating-drinking to approaching;
[7119] Sleeping-sitting is accomplishing;
[7120] Formations: abiding;
[7121] Exhaling-inhaling: mandala accomplishing;
[7122] All three-thousand: to mandala;
[7123] Rain and steam: drip drip established;
[7124] Going path object: great bindu;
[7125] Foot trace: powder;
[7126] Desire to go: manner itself;
[7127] Limb movement: mudra;

[7135] Blood and yellow water: all water;
[7136] Filled by substance of heart-meaning etc.;
[7137] Self-to appearing empowerments: all given;
[7138] Not conferring: complete in itself;
[7139] Desire to pass: to samaya;
[7140] Desire to keep: bind;
[7141] Desire to liberate: decline;
[7142] Desire non-existence: supreme;
[7143] All seeing: have mudra;
[7144] Attaching to that: experience;
[7145] To know-awareness clear instruction:
[7146] Object mind two: object to place;
[7147] Birth-age-sickness-death: familiarity vital point;
[7148] Aggregate six non-ceasing: realization.
[7149] Thus it is said.
[7150] Thus: yogi whatever made, deity wheel generated in dharmata nature, with empower complete instruction.


### PAGE 168

[7151] From dharmata wheel complete, self-settled river-continuum samadhi bridge not cut,
[7152] Effort exertion,
[7153] Cause-effect not depending: obtain great wonderful wonder attainment by nature, supreme ground great mandala complete.
[7154] That also from Thalgyur:

[7316] Great yogis arrived at nature: explain straight cause-effect virtue-sin non-existent, like Padma, Vimala,
[7317] Tilopa, etc.
[7318] Although we ourselves realize thus in mind, not arrive through familiarity—
[7319] Explain together with not fearing nature and avoiding slight cause-result.
[7320] Thus: twelve vajra laughters explained three times in three instructions become thirty-six—root afflictions, dependent-arising twelve entering manner, and


### PAGE 173

[7321] Reverse from manner, and
[7322] Completely disperse: thirty-six—understand together with pure places.
[7323] Briefly explain these meanings by certain instruction; enough elaborating word meanings.
[7324] Second general meaning: decisive cut at top, binding gathering has three:
[7325] Decisive cut view to self-arisen primordial wisdom;
[7326] Maintain intention time-three time-non-existent in nature;
[7327] Echo to actual meaning dharma-non-existent primordially complete.
[7328] First: this essence of self-know empty clear without move-change, copper-shining foundation essence decisive cut—make experience by great self-settled view-meditation of spontaneously accomplished great, not making whatever correct-change by mind dharma of view-meditation-action-result.
[7329] From Perfection:
[7330] Secret mantra awareness just-place:
[7331] Knot of view-meditation-action;
[7332] To outer inner secret discriminating-awareness,
[7333] By mind concept unmoved—
[7334] Desire secret view of secret mantra;
[7335] Victorious lion dharmakaya,
[7336] Abide samadhi separate from grasping-holding,
[7337] To view sign-non-existent,
[7338] Clear great discriminating-awareness of release-equal.
[7339] Thus said, and:
[7340] Also:
[7341] From dharmakaya all arising,
[7342] Dissolve in nature object-non-existent vast space;
[7343] If not accepting-correcting: action is;
[7344] If seeing self-appearance: view is;
[7345] Explain meditation not wandering to that.
[7346] Obtain samadhi without release-place;
[7347] Hold self-place without direction-falling;
[7348] Establish primordially self-arisen without making.
[7349] Thus said, and:
[7350] In self-arisen ocean not-limited dharmata:
[7351] Self-know concept-separate golden fish moves;
[7352] Obtain separation of empty-clear samsara-nirvana.
[7353] Thus it is said.
[7354] Second: maintaining intention time-three time-non-existent has two:
[7355] Essence self-clear in nature tone: not correct-change, place inside in nature of equal clear light, dense dense coiled, self-place clear clear;
[7356] Cut track-hold continue send of self-dawning thought concepts from I,
[7357] 


### PAGE 174

[7358] Instruction clear in space self-place: place outside in great vast river-space intention pure time-non-existent three times, wide self-liberated without interval.
[7359] First:
[7360] Together with body vital point and wind vital point: firm place in self-clear knowing, self-appearance appearance without grasping-holding.
[7361] From Six Spaces:
[7362] If not making that suchness,
[7363] Like sky not covered by clouds,
[7364] Part clear primordially from primordial tone,
[7365] Thus in clear sky
[7366] Like self-appearance of sun heart,
[7367] Body stain-non-existent essence,
[7368] Heart essence certain one-gathered,
[7369] Mandala of I itself is.
[7370] Thus it is said.
[7371] Second: making experience by ten great methods of cutting mind connection of three times:
[7372] Also from That Itself:
[7373] Person by what: not holding past track,
[7374] Not taking future hope,
[7375] Then placing now knowing in self-place,
[7376] From mixing all knowing before-after non-existent into one—
[7377] Called one-gathered essence one:
[7378] Awareness yogi equal to three times.
[7379] Also: not following after track of past habits,
[7380] Not welcoming hope of later-arising habits,
[7381] Not relying on continuum of now habits—
[7382] Called awareness yogi equal to three times.
[7383] Mixing samsara-nirvana non-dual by method of memory self-ending:
[7384] Cutting interval of all past memory, and
[7385] Suppressing itself of future memory, and
[7386] Releasing to self-dissolve all now memory—
[7387] Called awareness yogi equal to three times.
[7388] Also: not sending enter to past mind,
[7389] Not sending back to future mind,
[7390] Not sending mind to now mind—
[7391] Realizing yogi equal to three times.
[7392] Also: not throwing stone to past ignorance,
[7393] Not abandoning father to future ignorance,
[7394] Not taking to side to now ignorance.


### PAGE 175

[7395] Awareness yogi equal to three times.
[7396] Not attach attach to past anger,
[7397] Not take hook to future anger,
[7398] Not feed pride to now anger—
[7399] Called realizing yogi equal to three times.
[7400] Not gather clouds by past delusion,
[7401] Not cut earth by future delusion,
[7402] Not fall rain by now delusion—
[7403] Called realizing yogi equal to three times.
[7404] Not give answer to past Buddha,
[7405] Not give threatening look to future Buddha,
[7406] Not give blame to now Buddha—
[7407] Called yogi equal to three times.
[7408] Dispel itself of past desire,
[7409] Cut all of future desire,
[7410] Take out object of now desire—
[7411] Yogi equal to three times.
[7412] Not take tight of past jealousy,
[7413] Not gather mind of future jealousy,
[7414] Not put mind of now jealousy—
[7415] Realizing yogi equal to three times,
[7416] Called great yogi realizing samsara-nirvana non-dual.
[7417] That also: three-time Buddhas
[7418] Possess distinction experience of awareness primordial wisdom—instruction abandon grasp-attach to happiness-enjoyment, and
[7419] Appear to object of nine refute-establish and self-abide scripture-not-shown delusion—
[7420] Meditate identifying abiding in dharmata wide, interval cut track connect three times.
[7421] Third: echo to actual-meaning dharma-non-existent primordially-complete.
[7422] From Lion Perfection:
[7423] Virtue: not realize Buddha meaning;
[7424] If realize Buddha meaning by virtue—
[7425] Complete Great actual meaning becomes false.
[7426] Not become fall samsara by sin;
[7427] Not become fall samsara sin;
[7428] If become fall samsara by sin—
[7429] Three moments become false.
[7430] Not see right meaning by empty;
[7431] If see right meaning by empty—
[7432] Light-clear primordial wisdom becomes false.
[7433] Not see self-know meaning by sign;
[7434] If see self-know meaning by sign—
[7435] Self-liberated dharmata becomes false.
[7436] Not find spontaneously-complete meaning by making;
[7437] If find spontaneously-complete meaning by making—
[7438] Unchangeable essence becomes false.
[7439] Not become see appearance by grasping;
[7440] If become see appearance by grasping—
[7441] Ceaseless nature becomes false.
[7442] Not become liberate other side by analyzing;
[7443] If become liberate other side by analyzing—
[7444] All-pervading heart-feeling becomes false.
[7445] Not cover I by delusion appearance;
[7446] If cover I by delusion appearance—
[7447] Two lamps become false.
[7448] Show secret mantra intention.
[7449] Thus it is said.
[7450] This secret meaning: great awe at echoing to space, should not fear straight explanation.
[7451] Third general meaning: establishing at top of confidence-liberation, obstacle removing has three:


### PAGE 176

[7452] General show meaning of self-liberation:
[7453] Particular explanation of primordially liberated actual meaning,
[7454] Extensive speaking of self-liberated intention.
[7455] First:
[7456] Here at Ati Vajra Heart Essence, king of paths certain release from affliction:
[7457] By not abandoning affliction, pure in place—
[7458] Not like hearers abandoning,
[7459] Not like beings abandoning,
[7460] Not like lower mantra transforming generation stage,
[7461] Not like complete stage releasing self-dissolution,
[7462] Not like common vehicle generally taming by antidote,
[7463] Not like mind section placing in self-manner,
[7464] Not like space section purifying by making that itself dharmata.
[7465] Why?
[7466] If not knowing affliction that primordially exists without experiencing,
[7467] Not abandon by abandoning.
[7468] If abandoning affliction by mind,
[7469] Impossible to purify by two substance one of abandon-object abandon-agent;
[7470] If abandoning by primordial wisdom, mind not see primordial wisdom;
[7471] By primordial wisdom not seeing mind—impossible term of abandon-object abandon-agent at contradiction of non-abiding together, and
[7472] No abandoning by before-after, for past-future substance oppose;
[7473] One exist at time, one cease;
[7474] If time equal: conclude abandon-object to antidote by mutual mixing, and
[7475] Conclude antidote to abandon-object,
[7476] For one continuum mind time equal.
[7477] Also: no time to abandon by abandoning at body and shadow like of affliction arising from mind that itself.
[7478] Apply also to purifying etc.
[7479] From Sun-Moon Union:
[7480] If not realize suchness,
[7481] Like yogi body and shadow,
[7482] From that self-arising that itself—
[7483] Not abandon by abandoning.
[7484] Also not by thus purifying,
[7485] Also not change by transforming.
[7486] Not realize unchangeable heart essence:
[7487] Like crystal rock or turquoise stone,
[7488] Not capable to purify and melt.
[7489] By nature abide pure—
[7490] Investigate by possessing yogi.


### PAGE 177

[7491] Also not thus peace itself;
[7492] Not knowing direct insight:
[7493] Like Meru mountain king,
[7494] Not capable to break by whoever.
[7495] Not liberate by antidote;
[7496] Not knowing self-pure without searching:
[7497] Like desiring clear sediment in muddy water,
[7498] Not clear later-later.
[7499] Although that itself clear: not dharmata;
[7500] Not knowing spontaneous self-appearance: like ordinary fool appearance,
[7501] Not reverse apparent attachment.
[7502] By thus saying: should know vital point of self-by-self liberating like water trace.
[7503] This also: from two mind levels—
[7504] Self-liberation with effort:
[7505] Identify whatever arisen affliction, place in self-place—train power in great equal self-liberation of pure abiding-movement nature, self-liberating complete complete gone without wandering even moment.
[7506] Without effort:
[7507] That arisen incapable to bear, self-liberated dharmata—
[7508] Liberate by nature nature or force without needing abandon that view-method to that.
[7509] These two mind levels: first distinction and
[7510] Abide like before-after.
[7511] From That Itself:
[7512] These two mind levels:
[7513] All with effort and without effort.
[7514] Place all with effort in self-place,
[7515] All measures of familiarized appearance:
[7516] Itself pure primordial wisdom appearance.
[7517] When self-dawning to all outer-inner,
[7518] Not arise by that condition.
[7519] Although those arise-change until,
[7520] Liberate in self-place itself by self-place.
[7521] From that: yogi appearance.
[7522] All without effort thus:
[7523] Self-by-self liberated to self itself,
[7524] From self blank self self-liberated—
[7525] Like splitting all iron by iron, and
[7526] Like breaking all stone by stone:
[7527] Self antidote self itself great,
[7528] By realizing nature complete great.
[7529] Whatever familiarized thus:
[7530] Find all meanings of non-searching placing,
[7531] Spread great bliss without meditating,
[7532] Directly know in nature itself.


### PAGE 178

[7533] Through whomsoever this wisdom meets,
[7534] Even they who bear inexpiable misdeeds,
[7535] Through habituating but to this alone—
[7536] Doubtless, they attain liberation.
[7537] Thus it is proclaimed.
[7538] The second: specific explanation of primordially-liberated ground-body, having three parts:
[7539] First, the demonstration that since liberation is finished from the beginning, at present self-liberation occurs without need for antidote of effort or striving. Second, the instruction not to transgress from the nature of that abiding-reality. Third, resting without having experienced going elsewhere from merely basisless self-dissolution in natural condition.
[7540] First: From the Pearl Garland:
[7541] Not through effort is liberation attained,
[7542] */ From the beginning abiding liberated.
[7543] And further:
[7544] Through non-recognition itself self-occurred,
[7545] */ Cause of delusion from the beginning purified.
[7546] */ Kun-gzhi as dharmakaya self-appeared,
[7547] */ Stream of birth cut at the root.
[7548] */ Yid-bzhin dgongs-pa primordially abiding,
[7549] */ Movement-makers self-settled.
[7550] */ Breath from the beginning stream-cut,
[7551] */ Birth and death from the start nonexistent.
[7552] */ Desire's qualities primordially perfected,
[7553] */ Attachment's extreme is cultivation itself.
[7554] */ Limbs unmoved, primordially gone,
[7555] */ Beings' path from the beginning traversed.
[7556] */ Spoken speech inexpressible,
[7557] */ From the beginning beyond speech and thought's object.
[7558] */ Thought's emanation-gather primordially empty,
[7559] */ From the beginning abiding in great meditation.
[7560] */ Defilements self-purified,
[7561] */ Defilement-less great zang-thal abiding.
[7562] */ Through made-by not having arising-place,
[7563] */ From the very beginning free of action and actor.
[7564] */ From basis other-arisen dharma not existing,
[7565] */ From the beginning self-occurred single-alone.
[7566] */ One and two's number exhausted,
[7567] */ Thig-le free from moon.
[7568] */ Darkness from the beginning thoroughly purified,
[7569] */ Rig-pa's appearance luminosity-pervading.
[7570] */ Samsara changeless, ceased-finished,
[7571] */ From the beginning spontaneously-perfect buddha-ground.
[7572] */ Sign's entity empty-purified,
[7573] */ Self-grasping thought from the beginning exhausted.
[7574] */ Conditions by conditions self-liberated,
[7575] */ Reference-points are cog-bzhag.
[7576] Thus.
[7577] Second: From Thal-'gyur...
[7578] 
[7579] 
[7580] 
[7581] 
[7582] 


### PAGE 179

[7583] Nature of great perfection's extreme:
[7584] Dharmas settled in their own place,
[7585] Appearance-awareness dharmata unity—
[7586] Ye-grol reaches cog-bzhag itself.
[7587] Dgongs-pa beyond thought,
[7588] Marked settled in self-place purified,
[7589] Empty and entity extremes liberated,
[7590] Movement-exhausted, concept not existing,
[7591] Thought-exhausted, mind beyond.
[7592] Thus.
[7593] From the previous:
[7594] */ Elements five themselves primordially pure,
[7595] */ Appearance as luminosity itself liberated.
[7596] */ Sense-faculties five themselves cer-settled,
[7597] */ Grasping's objects five self-place liberated.
[7598] Thus.
[7599] Third: From Thal-'gyur:
[7600] Rang-mind liberation called—
[7601] */ From one to one gone not.
[7602] */ Mind not-existing who liberates,
[7603] */ Basis perfected, going-coming not.
[7604] */ Examined not-found, cause-reason not,
[7605] */ Basis-root not-existing, empty-luminosity abides.
[7606] */ That mind self-luminous abiding,
[7607] */ Liberated by essence, direction-partition not.
[7608] */ Liberated by time, reference-basis not.
[7609] */ Liberated effort-less, effort not.
[7610] */ Liberated by confidence, effort-striving not.
[7611] */ To that, liberation by confidence explained.
[7612] */ Ye-from liberated, returning-basis not.
[7613] */ Self-liberated, antidote not.
[7614] */ Cer-loosened at seeing-place also,
[7615] */ Completely liberated, effort-less.
[7616] Thus.
[7617] That also: gates-three ye-from liberated, from-beginning effort by liberation not-needed. Body's mudra-turning etc. whatsoever not-needed—elements self-essence liberated, six-realms back not-returning. Speech's effort, essence-recitation etc. do not-needed—expression clear-pure liberated, speaking all sound-meaning's essence liberated. Mind's effort, meditation cultivation etc. do not-needed—what thought, dgongs-pa's essence liberated. Other from arising not, self-liberated, antidote existing not-possible.
[7618] Thus self-liberation's essence: antidote not-existing.
[7619] To liberation called...
[7620] 
[7621] 
[7622] 
[7623] 
[7624] 
[7625] 
[7626] 
[7627] 


### PAGE 180

[7628] Settled-only by liberation,
[7629] Knowing-only by essence-peak liberated,
[7630] Ye-grol, rang-grol, cer-grol,
[7631] Completely-liberated and so forth—
[7632] Though many, this great rang-grol
[7633] Antidote not-existing, effort not-needed is shown.
[7634] Third: extensive explanation of rang-grol's dgongs-pa, having three:
[7635] Essence briefly shown, nature individually explained, meaning's conclusion.
[7636] First: From Pearl Garland:
[7637] To rig-pa without cessation,
[7638] */ Delusion-cause not-existing, returning-place not.
[7639] */ Ye-grol is definitely transcended,
[7640] */ Rang-grol is objects-conditions exhausted,
[7641] */ Cer-grol is appearances purified,
[7642] */ Extreme-liberation is four-extremes ceased,
[7643] */ Single-liberation is many emptied.
[7644] Thus: outer-inner non-dual zang-thal's rig-pa, direct like crystal without stain. To rig-pa basis-not-existing's essence by, delusion's cause not-existing, root separated—path not. Path not-existing, result three-realms returning-place not. That ye-from liberated-finished, sky-like dgongs-pa spontaneously-accomplished-finished. Great five liberation-manners with, common vehicles all from particularly transcended essence.
[7645] Second: five—ye-grol, rang-grol, cer-grol, mtha'-grol, gcig-grol's nature extensively explained.
[7646] First ye-grol: relying upon returning-basis not-existing's essence, view-meditation effort-striving dependent all shown. Ye-she pervading, generally released, made and altered not-existing's meaning. From-whence also not-arisen, to-where also not-gone, wherever not-abiding, change not-existing's meaning.
[7647] Liberation is not like untying—view-meditation by effort not-needed. Liberation called: from abiding in rang-lugs, accepting-rejecting not-existing's meaning.
[7648] Thus body-speech-mind three relaxed-settled in rang-lugs, mind itself naturally arrived—to liberation called. That also permanently thus abiding, from common vehicles transcended.
[7649] Example of ye-from liberated...

### PAGE 181

[7672] A-li-ka's fruit, primordially ripened—
[7673] Now ripening cause not-existing, like.
[7674] Ye-grol having three: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner.
[7675] Ye-grol's understanding: not adventitious, from beginning liberated-finished. Now again liberating cause not-existing's essence—rig-pa itself from delusion not-experienced arisen.
[7676] Ye-grol as placing's establishment, having three: reason by establishment, scripture by establishment, logical-reason by establishment.
[7677] Reason by establishment: ye-from rig-pa itself liberated's essence. Rig-pa to basis not-existing, returning-place not. Root not-existing, arising-place not. Characteristics not-existing, certainty not-reached. Birth not-existing, liberating cause not-existing.
[7678] That also as ye-grol sign: meditation-accomplishment whatsoever by characteristics seeing not. That also cause-effect sequence-not's reason by established. Rig-pa to continuum not-existing, result not—karma and ripening existing not-possible.
[7679] Scripture by establishment: From Brtson-pa-don-ldan:
[7680] */ Mind itself ye-from liberated,
[7681] */ Outside from liberated condition how possible?
[7682] Thus.
[7683] Logical-reason by establishment: gtad-yal-rag-gzhag's logical-reason by accomplished. Gtad-pa ye-from liberated, that itself self-place liberated—ye-from liberated because.
[7684] That also: mind from arising-place not-existing, abiding-place not-existing, going-place not-existing's essence—ye-from liberated known.
[7685] Liberation-manner: mind empty is liberation called, or not-liberated called convention-only not-designatable. Ye-from liberated-finished's sign: now that to again liberate not-needed—mind ye-from buddha-ed.
[7686] Ye-from liberated that to: liberating cause not-existing known.
[7687] Second rang-grol: relying upon antidote not-existing's essence, lama's instruction dependent all shown.
[7688] Thus: appearing-sounding dharmas all, arisen also self from arisen...

[7718] Liberated also self-liberated—
[7719] Example like sky and cloud.
[7720] Thus: object-other dependent cultivation, view and conduct defect-possessing like not. Liberation by meaning called: dharmas exhausted to.
[7721] Rang-grol having three: understanding, establishment, liberation-manner.
[7722] Rang-grol's understanding: antidote not-existing's meaning. Appearance itself from appearance self-liberated—apart from appearance, dharmata whatsoever not. Thus empty etc., itself by liberated, apart not.
[7723] Example: alcohol-sick by alcohol destroyed, poison by poison destroyed, iron by iron cut—etc. like. Afflictions itself, that itself by liberated—rang-grol called.
[7724] Rang-grol as placing's establishment, having three: reason by established, scripture by established, logical-reason by established.
[7725] Reason by established: dharmata's reason by established. Liberation all rang-grol is—other by untied like not established. If other-liberation is, entity one form different appearing not-possible like. Entity's characteristic, entity certainty reached like.
[7726] Scripture by established: From Sems-sde:
[7727] */ Liberation self-occurred, other from not.
[7728] Thus.
[7729] Logical-reason by established: rang-grol-chen-po controversy-basis not-existing's logical-reason by accomplished established. Thus appearance rang-grol is—antidote other dependent not.
[7730] Liberation-manner: self by self-liberated, apart not, other not. From other text also: desire-possessing desire path made liberation etc. explained. From Kye-rdo-rje:
[7731] */ Like fire by burned to,
[7732] */ Fire that itself by warm do.
[7733] Thus etc. spoken like.
[7734] Appearance appearance self's peak from liberated itself...

[7765] Apart from appearance, liberating-cause or liberated-condition other not.
[7766] That basis-not liberated, abiding's support not, basis-root not. That basis-root not-existing's mind itself—that: From Gsang-snying:
[7767] */ Basis-root not-existing's mind this,
[7768] */ Male female not, neuter not,
[7769] */ Color not, shape not,
[7770] */ Signless not, lineage not.
[7771] Thus: that itself self from apart returning-place not, going-place not, birth not-experienced. Whence arisen's place not that—itself self not-existing's dharma, apart not: rang-grol called.
[7772] Example: snake's knot, who by not-untied, self-liberated—like.
[7773] Third cer-grol: relying upon seeing-yal's essence, tantra scripture dependent all shown.
[7774] Cer by seeing only by, that itself liberated—mother-child meet, liberation is. Appearance that itself thought not-altered, appearance by not-cut settled, self-pure liberated.
[7775] Cer-grol seeing-yal four: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner, example.
[7776] Cer-grol's understanding: cer by seeing only by, that itself seeing liberated. Moment first self to see or hear, awareness only by liberated—that to dharmata direct's reckoning reaches.
[7777] Cer-grol as placing's establishment three: reason, scripture, logical-reason.
[7778] Reason: gtang-yal where also not-perceived established. Appearance seeing-peak, appearance only liberated. Awareness moving-peak, moving only liberated. Empty self-place's essence by, form cer seeing—form slight-only shown, that itself liberated. Thus sound etc. also.
[7779] That liberated how known? Form as seeing, form not-existing elaboration cut. That to cer settled, that itself liberated...

[7817] Other to entering awareness not-arising by.
[7818] Scripture by established: From Gser-gyi-snying-po's tantra:
[7819] */ Cer-grol-chen-po's view-gaze by,
[7820] */ Buddhas beings two both liberated.
[7821] Thus.
[7822] Logical-reason: direction-free self-pure's logical-reason by established. Thus appearance cer-grol is—that itself cer-place settled, settled-place liberated, liberated-place yal because.
[7823] Liberation-manner: dharma-possessing part trained, part cer-place liberated. Wherever gone not, whence come not, wherever going-place not, wherever abiding change not. Dharma-possessing general trained, appearances all cer-grol gone.
[7824] Example: like blind-intellect temple gone, seeing-limit not.
[7825] Fourth mtha'-grol: relying upon reference apart basis-not-existing's essence. Reference what to also not-pointing essence—one's extreme from liberated is, two not-abiding, two from liberated one also not-abiding. Thus both, both not etc.
[7826] Extreme: existing's extreme appearance, not-existing's extreme not-appearance, both both not's extreme four cease—liberation called convention.
[7827] Mtha'-grol reference apart three: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner.
[7828] Mtha'-grol's understanding: existing, not-existing, appearing, empty's extreme—whatsoever reference not-pointing. Meaning by this is this not's reckoning beyond.
[7829] Mtha'-grol as placing's establishment three: reason, scripture, logical-reason.
[7830] Reason: reference-free essence reason by established. Whatsoever not-referenced, extreme apart is—extreme whatsoever abiding not. Therefore extreme-free, center not-perceived view called.

[7871] From Rtsal-chen-yon-tan-rdzogs-pa's scripture:
[7872] */ Extreme apart, liberation called, thus.
[7873] Logical-reason: one knowing all liberated's logical-reason by established. One extreme apart knowing—thus appearance designation all from liberated is, reference whatsoever not-approaching because.
[7874] Liberation-manner: existing extreme not-abiding, not-existing extreme liberated. Not-existing extreme not-abiding, existing extreme liberated. Existing-not-existing both not-abiding, both liberated, both not by, both not liberated.
[7875] Fifth gcig-grol: relying upon peerless basis-not-existing's essence, means and wisdom dependent all shown.
[7876] One great-perfection thig-le single-alone, elaboration apart is—that's natural-condition liberated, many number's extreme all emptied.
[7877] Gcig-grol peerless basis four: understanding, placing's establishment, liberation-manner, example.
[7878] Gcig-grol's gcod-ba: gcig-grol that not-established not—one one liberated, apart not-recognized whatsoever not. Therefore rig-pa to: ye-from liberated not-liberated convention beyond.
[7879] Gcig-grol as placing's establishment three: reason, scripture, logical-reason.
[7880] Reason by established: liberation all different not—one other not-existing, liberation called. Single-one rig-pa itself—that also self-awareness single-alone, not-existing's dharma apart not.
[7881] Scripture by established: From Gser-gyi-snying-po:
[7882] */ Single liberation's dharmata is,
[7883] */ Many taste-one is because.
[7884] Thus.
[7885] Logical-reason by established: one knowing all-liberated by established. One awareness knowing—samsara-nirvana all liberated because.
[7886] Liberation-manner: dharmata as recognition, appearance-awareness all liberated.
[7887] Example: many taste-one knowing—salt one's taste, certainty reached if...

[7923] Salt all's taste certainty reached, or molasses and fire—one recognition, knowing all knowing—like.
[7924] From Byang-chub-sems-'grel:
[7925] */ Fire's nature heat,
[7926] */ Molasses nature sweet like.
[7927] */ Thus dharmas all also,
[7928] */ Nature empty single.
[7929] Thus like.
[7930] Thus liberation-manner five, person one calculate not—faculties' difference by, what aspiration, liberation is.
[7931] Third: liberation-manner five's conclusion five show. That also here: liberation-manner five those reference-basis apart. Rang-grol is: grasping view, meditation, conduct dharma's reference apart. Conditions conditions by liberated—example like dirt by dirt washed. Condition bad, condition bad by liberated, ye-she's companion appear. Ka-dag ka-dag by liberated, rig-pa rig-pa by liberated.
[7932] Ye-grol: grasping-grasped unity reference apart. Objects objects by liberated—poison by poisons destroyed like.
[7933] Cer-grol: samsara-nirvana two not-referenced, cause causes liberated—example iron by iron cut like.
[7934] Mtha'-grol: convention word not-referenced, dharma dharma liberated's example—wood from arisen fire, that wood that burned like.
[7935] Gcig-grol: liberating-doer thought not-referenced, mind-itself mind liberated's example—stone by stones cut like.
[7936] From Mu-tig-phreng-ba:
[7937] */ Conditions conditions by liberated because,
[7938] */ Grasping dharmas to not-reference.
[7939] */ Objects objects liberated to,
[7940] */ Grasping-grasped two not-reference.
[7941] */ Cause cause liberated to,
[7942] */ Samsara-nirvana two not-reference.
[7943] */ Dharma dharma liberated to,
[7944] */ Convention word not-reference.
[7945] */ Mind-itself mind liberated to,
[7946] */ Indicating-doer thought not-reference.
[7947] */ Dirt by dirt washed like,

[7951] */ Stone's stones severed,
[7952] */ Wood's woods burned like.

[7966] That from:

Ye-from thoroughly-pure zang-ka, stone-with pure empty. General-appearance samsara-nirvana's projection-feature not-stained. Dharmas exhausted, movement-dissolved, inert-awareness beyond.

[8013] Rig-pa sky-like meaning relying-upon: dharmas exhausted, appearance body water-moon like manifested. Walls, fence etc. touch not—eye, clairvoyance measureless attained. Aryas' truth seeing, again existence completely liberated.
[8014] Ka-dag ground liberated: elements-four's atom power-not, ye-she's fire burned. Mist dissolved like, sky's space body miracle shown. Meaning become: ye-she's fire burned atoms, those body-relic, self-relic blessing confer. Not-become: self-dissolved peace made, rig-pa dharmakaya's expanse abiding. Form-body activities with, samsara not-empty until, beings' benefit do.
[8015] From Zangs-yig-can and Rtags-tshad: appearance four measure not-reached also, stone-with not-visible, from-beginning's place liberated existing. Khregs-chod as liberation's manner clearly—rin-po-che-spungs-pa's tantra from spoken:
[8016] Not-released self-place settled's,
[8017] */ Mind this word all.
[8018] */ Who by trained not,

[8020] */ This itself self intellect understood,
[8021] */ Not-visible concept not-existing by.
[8022] */ Appearances all self-pure from,

[8024] */ Empty-luminosity great's kind become.
[8025] */ Earth water fire wind elements four,
[8026] */ Individual power not-visible.
[8027] */ Mist like wise dissolve.
[8028] */ Delusion's attachment varieties—
[8029] */ How thought, birth-not.
[8030] */ Grasping-grasped aspects self-ceased,

[8052] Slight not-reached also, other from transcended is—if corpse that pound-one etc., weight-only even to light etc., rig-pa ka-dag dissolved.
[8053] This's essence: rig-pa's essence zang-thal stone-with pure, habituating's portion from arisen. Mind that's delusion-appearance not-existing, clear-appearance portion also, time that self-face thoroughly-pure, mind ye-she distinguished. Mind pure, ye-she's truth seeing, thought bliss.
[8054] From Seng-ge-rtsal-rdzogs:
