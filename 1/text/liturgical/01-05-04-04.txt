[6422] At the fifth, the web-protector Buddha, and

The fifth emanation in the sequence of primordial teachers appears during the fifth teaching epoch as the web-protector Buddha (dra ba skyong ba'i sangs rgyas). This designation refers specifically to Jvalamukha (khro rgyal me zhal), the wrathful world-protector whose fiery countenance and diamond-sharp awareness cut through the net of conceptual entanglements that bind beings to cyclic existence.

According to the Great Arrangement (mahāvyūha) teachings recorded in the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra:

"At the fifth teaching,
Called Jvalamukha, protector of the world,
In the heart of the supreme thousand, concealed."

This emanation's name—Jvalamukha, literally "Blazing Face" or "Flame-Mouthed"—signifies the transformative power of wrathful compassion that consumes all impurities while preserving the pure essence. Unlike the peaceful emanations that precede it, this fifth manifestation employs fierce methods to liberate beings whose obstructions require more forceful intervention.

The description of being "concealed in the heart of the supreme thousand" (stong mchog gi snying la sbas) indicates that Jvalamukha represents the secret, innermost dimension of the thousand Buddhas' wisdom—the wrathful aspect that remains hidden from ordinary perception but becomes manifest when necessary for the benefit of beings with particularly heavy karmic obscurations.

The "web" (dra ba) in the title refers to the intricate net of causes and conditions that constitute saṃsāra, including the subtle conceptual fabrications that even advanced practitioners may fail to recognize. As the web-protector, this Buddha severs these entanglements with the sharp weapon of non-dual wisdom, revealing the open space of primordial purity that lies beyond all constructed webs of perception.
