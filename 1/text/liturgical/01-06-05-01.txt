[8672] <list> The Sequence of the Five Joys—progressive stages of wisdom-bliss ascending toward the non-dual realization:

[8673] <tantra> First Joy—entering into the wisdom of Jñāna, engaging with the propelling and gathering of the winds. At this stage, the winds are drawn inward; the vital energies converge and concentrate, establishing the foundation for the arising of bliss through the manipulation of the inner vajra-body's prāṇa.

<tantra> This First Joy marks the inception of the path wherein the practitioner begins to taste the first fruits of liberated awareness—not through conceptual understanding but through the direct engagement with the subtle body's dynamic forces. The winds that ordinarily scatter throughout Saṃsāra's endless becoming are now gathered and directed toward the central channel, creating the conditions for the arising of pristine cognition.

<tantra> The gathering of winds represents the initial phase of the completion stage practices wherein the ten winds—the five root winds and five branch winds—are drawn into the central avadhūtī channel. This gathering dissolves the ordinary fixation on external objects and turns the mind inward toward the experience of inner radiance. It is at this moment that the first taste of joy emerges—not the conditioned happiness of worldly pursuits, but the unconditioned bliss of wisdom beginning to manifest.

<tantra> In the glorious tradition of Vajrayāna, this First Joy is likened to the sun rising over the eastern mountains; just as the first rays of dawn dispel the darkness of night, so too does this initial gathering of winds dispel the darkness of ordinary perception. The practitioner recognizes that the confused appearances of Saṃsāra are none other than the display of Dharmakāya, and this recognition itself becomes the foundation for all subsequent attainments.

<tantra> The Guru's blessings are essential at this stage, for without the transmission of the authentic lineage, the mere manipulation of winds leads only to mundane meditative states rather than the transcendent wisdom of the Buddhas. Therefore, the practitioner supplicates the Three Jewels and Three Roots with fervent devotion, recognizing that all gathering of winds is ultimately the play of the Guru's compassion.

[8678] Thus it is spoken:

<tantra> First Joy only from,
The gathering of winds and wisdom's dawn;
Entering Jñāna's radiant sphere,
The path of bliss begins to clear.

<tantra> Through this First Joy, the practitioner establishes the foundation for the entire path of the completion stage, preparing the vessel of the subtle body to receive the higher wisdom-blisses that follow. May all beings enter this joy and swiftly traverse the path to supreme enlightenment.
