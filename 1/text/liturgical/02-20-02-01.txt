[8831] First:
[8832] From Self-Arising:
[8833] In the sky of self-appearing Dharma-nature,
[8834] Awareness-wisdom without distraction,
[8835] When placed in hold-free state,
[8836] See pure wisdom's self-appearance;
[8837] Reverse non-awareness's delusion-appearances.
[8838] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8839] Upon the banner without setting,
[8840] The lamp without change is clear.
[8841] Upon wisdom without concepts,
[8842] The five lights without clear-obscure are clear.
[8843] Thus it is spoken, and:
[8844] Upon jewel precious nectar,
[8845] By doing and meditating, one does not find.
[8846] Upon lamp's space-appearance,
[8847] Examine without distraction, clear, without holding.
[8848] Thus, not distracted from meaning,
[8849] This is the precious nectar lamp.
[8850] Without release and placing, the supreme finding;
[8851] Without holding, self-liberation.
[8852] Thus it is spoken.
[8853] Second:
[8854] From Thalgyur:
[8855] Body's essential point is by resonance.
[8856] Wisdom's posture is by pure.
[8857] Bindu coils and stirs, accomplishing.
[8858] Light extends and gathers.
[8859] Connection-possessed restraining is wind's essential point.
[8860] Entering action is distinguished by end.
[8861] By that changer, wind ceases.
[8862] Join with delusion's encounter.
[8863] Awareness's essential point: releasing and
[8864] Coiling, placing in sky.
[8865] Space's essential point: gathering and
[8866] Drawing, joining element-overflow.
[8867] Appearance's essential point: increasing and ceasing,
[8868] Various self-liberations.
[8869] Thus it is spoken.
[8870] Moreover, when seeing body, look at that perfect essential point's resonance without changing.
[8871] When at wisdom-fortress-mouth etc., posture does not change.
[8872] When bindu does not expand, roll to eye-center and constrict light-root.
[8873] When light overflows, place at brow.
[8874] When concepts scatter, bind and emit wind.
[8875] Awareness's essential point: release nadi-thread to sky.
[8876] Space's essential point: gather to center, lead from eye-corners, look.
[8877] These are all essential points.
[8878] Second, thus when taking experience, the essential points of space-awareness gradually arising through experience:
[8879] From first experience-taking until perfect end.

[8880] From Lion Power-Perfect:
[8881] That self-appearing awareness-thing
[8882] Abides in wisdom's nadi-thread.
[8883] Like swift-flying winged ones
[8884] Going everywhere in mere moments,
[8885] When reached by arrow,
[8886] Becomes like swift deer.
[8887] Then, not distracted from meaning,
[8888] Like bees circling nectar.
[8889] Then, when looking at self-appearance,
[8890] It abides like a mirage.
[8891] Then, not distracted from meaning,
[8892] Becomes only movement or fluttering.
[8893] Not distracted from that meaning,
[8894] Becomes sinking and blazing.
[8895] Therefore, when looking very carefully,
[8896] See light-appearance without going or coming.
[8897] When stable in that meaning,
[8898] See the bindu-empty lamp.
[8899] When truly looking at that,
[8900] See bindu with body.
[8901] Not distracted from that meaning,
[8902] Delusion-appearances become seen as enjoyment-body.
[8903] All those body-appearances
[8904] Are like illusion-rainbow.
[8905] Becoming thoroughly stable in that,
[8906] Day and night without—
[8907] Like the eye of a vixen,
[8908] Without day and night.
[8909] Self-appearing mandala is thus.
[8910] Thus it is spoken.
[8911] Moreover, all empty-form rainbow-light bindu-bodies etc.
[8912] Are widely said to exist in outer intermediate space, and
[8913] One holds that they exist there,
[8914] But this is error, not thus.
[8915] All exist within the clear light-root of the inner body.
[8916] By the clarity of eye's light-root, one sees empty-forms inwardly.
[8917] Moreover, the heart's resonance-root pervading all and emanating
[8918] Is now the time of base-appearance arising.
[8919] Knowing self-face and clearly placing in self-glow,
[8920] Going increasingly clear,
[8921] When wind-mind pure, seeing what spontaneous appearance is within body, when entering within as power-base dissolves,
[8922] Reaching measure, goes to cease.
[8923] When setting again, base-appearance dissolves into base, liberating into primordial purity,
[8924] When that appearance appears to expand, expanding without self-characteristic.

[8925] There is no obscuration from reversing inward.
[8926] Here, what tantra and instruction say exists in outer sky:
[8927] For now, said intentionally—when placing eye on outer sky condition, the portion seen and seeming to exist there.
[8928] Naturally, if it existed outside, others could also see it;
[8929] Know it does not exist outside.
[8930] That others do not see one's empty-form is due to body obscuration.
[8931] Self-seeing is like seeing sun-arisen appearance within the hole of seeing-arising through pure light-root's gap.
[8932] The proof: by seeing empty-forms with closed eyes, one knows they exist within.
[8933] Therefore, body-appearances etc. appear as if existing in outer fields, though not existing there—
[8934] Like face appearing when looking in mirror.
[8935] In the mirror of clear inner light-root,
[8936] That heart-awareness's face-like resonance-appearance
[8937] Arises from the portion of pure light-root's quality, seen within though not in field.
[8938] Outer and inner two portions mixing in mere appearance—delusions also, many are true.
[8939] Understanding manner thus, a person possessing wisdom, arisen from Great Perfection's expanse, is called
[8940] A yogin like myself of various self-liberation.
[8941] Joining these manners with confident scripture:
[8942] From the great Lion Power-Perfect Tantra:
[8943] All those body-appearances
[8944] Are not field-appearances.
[8945] Like a young girl
[8946] To the mirror's clear characteristic,
[8947] Seeing her own face appear—
[8948] To Dharma-nature's field-sky,
[8949] Awareness-appearance arises as body.
[8950] Seeing one's own location-condition
[8951] Does not exist in field.
[8952] Pure reference manifestly clear,
[8953] With one's own center and mandala.
[8954] Though wisdom-meaning has no field,
[8955] At sentient-being time, appears like field.
[8956] Great realization in seen field,
[8957] Great bliss in understood field,
[8958] Great experience in seen appearance,
[8959] Self-awareness alone, supreme companion.

[8960] Because not existing in the field of appearance,
[8961] From Vajra Nadi-Thread itself:
[8962] Portion-body is unthinkable.
[8963] Thus it is spoken.
[8964] This has a reason to be understood; intelligent ones should know it.
[8965] Naturally easy to realize, saying body-appear has no contradiction,
[8966] For the confused, it should be explained that space-awareness and lamp-appearance in outer sky are easy to realize.
[8967] The reason for understanding within oneself is as before.
[8968] Fifth, the manner of special determination:
[8969] By the essential point of awareness without change,
