[8831] First:



<tantra> [8832] From the Self-Arisen:
<tantra> [8833] To dharmatā's self-appearance sky,
<tantra> [8834] Awareness wisdom not distracted,
<tantra> [8835] In non-grasping state settled,
<tantra> [8836] Pure wisdom's self-appearance seen.
<tantra> [8837] Non-recognition delusion-appearances reversed.
<tantra> [8838] Thus it is spoken.



<tantra> [8839] Upon the never-setting victory banner,
<tantra> [8840] The unchanging lamp clear,
<tantra> [8841] To thought-free wisdom,
<tantra> [8842] The five lights without waxing or waning clear.
<tantra> [8843] Thus it is spoken.



<tantra> [8844] Upon the wish-fulfilling jewel nectar,
<tantra> [8845] Through contrived practice never obtained.
<tantra> [8846] To the expanse-lamp appearance,
<tantra> [8847] Without distraction, clear, without grasping, examine.
<tantra> [8848] Thus without distraction from meaning,
<tantra> [8849] The wish-fulfilling jewel lamp it is.
<tantra> [8850] Without contrivance or settlement, supreme attainment,
<tantra> [8851] Without grasping, self-liberated in its own place.
<tantra> [8852] Thus it is spoken.



[8853] Second:



<tantra> [8854] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [8855] Body's crucial point is through resonance,
<tantra> [8856] Through wisdom's settling postures pure.
<tantra> [8857] Thigle accumulated and churned—accomplished.
<tantra> [8858] Light expands and gathers.
<tantra> [8859] Through related binding, wind's crucial point.
<tantra> [8860] Entering's action distinguished by extreme.
<tantra> [8861] Its transformation causes wind exhaustion.
<tantra> [8862] Delusion's harmony related.
<tantra> [8863] Awareness's crucial point is releasing and
<tantra> [8864] Drawing upward, released to space.
<tantra> [8865] Expanse's crucial point is gathering and
<tantra> [8866] Drawing, elements' pervasion related.
<tantra> [8867] Appearance's crucial point is increase and exhaustion,
<tantra> [8868] Various self-liberated.
<tantra> [8869] Thus it is spoken.



[8870] Moreover, when seeing the body at that time, the crucial point is to view that resonance of complete perfection without change.
[8871] At the time of wisdom citadels and so forth, the settling posture is without change.
[8872] If thigle does not increase, draw inward to the center of the eyes, binding the light-nerve.
[8873] If light-pra expands, direct to the area between the eyebrows.
[8874] If thoughts disperse, bind the wind and draw.
[8875] Awareness's crucial point: release the chain to space.
[8876] Expanse's crucial point: gather to the center, and from the corner of the eyes, guide and view.
[8877] These are the crucial points.
[8878] Second: when practicing in that manner, the crucial point of expanse-awareness progressively experienced is
[8879] From first practice to final completion:



<tantra> [8880] From the Lion Complete Potency:
<tantra> [8881] This awareness's self-appearance entity,
<tantra> [8882] Abides as wisdom's chain.
<tantra> [8883] Like birds flying swiftly born,
<tantra> [8884] In but an instant, pervades all.
<tantra> [8885] If string strikes that,
<tantra> [8886] It becomes merely swift as a deer.
<tantra> [8887] Then without distraction from meaning,
<tantra> [8888] Merely circling to the essence like a bee.
<tantra> [8889] Then viewing self-appearance,
<tantra> [8890] Like a mirage, it abides.
<tantra> [8891] Then without distraction from meaning,
<tantra> [8892] Merely as flickering or flashing it becomes.
<tantra> [8893] Without distraction from its meaning,
<tantra> [8894] It becomes like quivering and fire.
<tantra> [8895] Therefore, when viewed intently,
<tantra> [8896] Non-coming, non-going, light-appearance seen.
<tantra> [8897] When steadied upon its meaning,
<tantra> [8898] The empty thigle lamp seen.
<tantra> [8899] When truly viewed upon that,
<tantra> [8900] The thigle body seen endowed.
<tantra> [8901] Without distraction from its meaning,
<tantra> [8902] Delusion-appearance seen as enjoyment body.
<tantra> [8903] All those body's appearances,
<tantra> [8904] Are like illusions, rainbows.
<tantra> [8905] When steadied intently upon that,
<tantra> [8906] Day and night without distinction:
<tantra> [8907] Like the eyes of a wolf,
<tantra> [8908] Without day or night,
<tantra> [8909] Self-appearance mandala is likewise.
<tantra> [8910] Thus it is spoken.



[8911] Moreover, all empty-form rainbow-light thigle bodies and so forth
[8912] Are commonly said to exist in outer space,
[8913] And grasped as existing there.
[8914] Mistaken understanding is not so.
[8915] All that exist in inner body's clear light-nerve
[8916] Are seen as empty-forms through the eye's clear light-nerve drawn inward.
[8917] Moreover, the heart's resonance-nerve pervading everywhere spreading
[8918] Is the time of ground-appearance arising now.
[8919] Knowing one's own face, settling gently upon self-resonance,
[8920] Proceeding increasingly pure,
[8921] When wind and mind pure, through spontaneous presence's appearance, seeing whatever within the body, potency-ground dissolves, entering inward,
[8922] Reaching measure, going to exhaustion,
[8923] Then at setting, ground-appearance dissolving into ground, liberated in primordial purity.
[8924] All those appearances appear as increase, yet increase is without self-nature.



[8925] Inward self-reversal—there is no waning.
[8926] Here, what tantras and oral instructions say exists in outer space
[8927] Is provisionally spoken: because of the portion seen when directing the eye to conditioned outer space, and because it seems to exist there.
[8928] In nature, if existing outside, others could also see it.
[8929] Knowing it does not exist outside,
[8930] That others do not see one's own empty-form is because obscured by the body.
[8931] One's own seeing is like seeing the sun shining inside through the window of inwardly arising clear light-nerve.
[8932] The proof is that when eyes closed, seeing empty-forms also knows it exists inside.
[8933] Therefore, body and so forth's appearances, though not in outer objects, seem to exist,
[8934] Like a form reflected when looking in a mirror.
[8935] In the mirror of inner clear light-nerve,
[8936] The heart's awareness like-form resonance-appearance
[8937] Though not in objects, is seen inwardly through the quality of pure observed light-nerve.
[8938] Outer and inner two aspects confused—appearance only is delusion. Most ordinary beings accept this.
[8939] When the manner is understood thus, it is called born from the expanse of Great Perfection, person of wisdom.
[8940] The yogin of various self-liberation, like myself.
[8941] The manner of these, when conjoined with confident scripture,
[8942] From the Lion Complete Potency Great Tantra:



<tantra> [8943] All those body's appearances,
<tantra> [8944] Are not objects' appearances.
<tantra> [8945] For example, by a young maiden,
<tantra> [8946] Upon the mirror's clear characteristic,
<tantra> [8947] Her own face-appearance seen—
<tantra> [8948] To dharmatā's object-sky,
<tantra> [8949] Awareness's appearance arises as body.
<tantra> [8950] Seeing one's own actual state
<tantra> [8951] Is not existing in objects.
<tantra> [8952] Through pure observation, directly clear.
<tantra> [8953] With one's own mandala and retinue,
<tantra> [8954] Though wisdom's meaning is objectless,
<tantra> [8955] It appears as objects for sentient beings.
<tantra> [8956] Great realization in seen objects,
<tantra> [8957] Great bliss in understood objects.
<tantra> [8958] Great experience in seen appearance.
<tantra> [8959] Self-awareness alone, supreme companion.



<tantra> [8960] Because in appearance's objects it does not exist,
<tantra> [8961] From vajra chain itself,
<tantra> [8962] The body's portions inconceivable.
<tantra> [8963] Thus it is spoken.



[8964] This has meaning to be understood—the wise should realize.
[8965] In nature, easy to realize, called "body appearance"—there is no contradiction.
[8966] For the deluded, who see expanse-awareness and lamps appearing in outer space, it is explained for ease of understanding.
[8967] Inner meaning is as before.
[8968] Fifth: the manner of determining particular distinctions,
[8969] Through the crucial point of awareness's unchangeability,
