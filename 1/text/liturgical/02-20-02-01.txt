[8831] First:
[8832] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[8833] <tantra> To dharmatā's self-appearance sky,
[8834] <tantra> Awareness wisdom not distracted,
[8835] <tantra> In non-grasping state settled,
[8836] <tantra> Pure wisdom's self-appearance seen.
[8837] <tantra> Non-recognition delusion-appearances reversed.
[8838] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8839] <tantra> Upon the never-setting victory banner,
[8840] <tantra> The unchanging lamp clear, || 10 ||
[8841] <tantra> To thought-free wisdom,
[8842] <tantra> The five lights without waxing or waning clear.
[8843] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8844] <tantra> Upon the wish-fulfilling jewel nectar,
[8845] <tantra> Through contrived practice never obtained.
[8846] <tantra> To the expanse-lamp appearance,
[8847] <tantra> Without distraction, clear, without grasping, examine.
[8848] <tantra> Thus without distraction from meaning,
[8849] <tantra> The wish-fulfilling jewel lamp it is.
[8850] <tantra> Without contrivance or settlement, supreme attainment, || 20 ||
[8851] <tantra> Without grasping, self-liberated in its own place.
[8852] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8853] Second:
[8854] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[8855] <tantra> Body's crucial point is through resonance,
[8856] <tantra> Through wisdom's settling postures pure.
[8857] <tantra> Thigle accumulated and churned—accomplished.
[8858] <tantra> Light expands and gathers.
[8859] <tantra> Through related binding, wind's crucial point.
[8860] <tantra> Entering's action distinguished by extreme. || 30 ||
[8861] <tantra> Its transformation causes wind exhaustion.
[8862] <tantra> Delusion's harmony related.
[8863] <tantra> Awareness's crucial point is releasing and
[8864] <tantra> Drawing upward, released to space.
[8865] <tantra> Expanse's crucial point is gathering and
[8866] <tantra> Drawing, elements' pervasion related.
[8867] <tantra> Appearance's crucial point is increase and exhaustion,
[8868] <tantra> Various self-liberated.
[8869] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8870] Moreover, when seeing the body at that time, the crucial point is to view that resonance of complete perfection without change. || 40 ||
[8871] At the time of wisdom citadels and so forth, the settling posture is without change.
[8872] If thigle does not increase, draw inward to the center of the eyes, binding the light-nerve.
[8873] If light-pra expands, direct to the area between the eyebrows.
[8874] If thoughts disperse, bind the wind and draw.
[8875] Awareness's crucial point: release the chain to space.
[8876] Expanse's crucial point: gather to the center, and from the corner of the eyes, guide and view.
[8877] These are the crucial points.
[8878] Second: when practicing in that manner, the crucial point of expanse-awareness progressively experienced is
[8879] From first practice to final completion:
[8880] <tantra> From the Lion Complete Potency: || 50 ||
[8881] <tantra> This awareness's self-appearance entity,
[8882] <tantra> Abides as wisdom's chain.
[8883] <tantra> Like birds flying swiftly born,
[8884] <tantra> In but an instant, pervades all.
[8885] <tantra> If string strikes that,
[8886] <tantra> It becomes merely swift as a deer.
[8887] <tantra> Then without distraction from meaning,
[8888] <tantra> Merely circling to the essence like a bee.
[8889] <tantra> Then viewing self-appearance,
[8890] <tantra> Like a mirage, it abides. || 60 ||
[8891] <tantra> Then without distraction from meaning,
[8892] <tantra> Merely as flickering or flashing it becomes.
[8893] <tantra> Without distraction from its meaning,
[8894] <tantra> It becomes like quivering and fire.
[8895] <tantra> Therefore, when viewed intently,
[8896] <tantra> Non-coming, non-going, light-appearance seen.
[8897] <tantra> When steadied upon its meaning,
[8898] <tantra> The empty thigle lamp seen.
[8899] <tantra> When truly viewed upon that,
[8900] <tantra> The thigle body seen endowed. || 70 ||
[8901] <tantra> Without distraction from its meaning,
[8902] <tantra> Delusion-appearance seen as enjoyment body.
[8903] <tantra> All those body's appearances,
[8904] <tantra> Are like illusions, rainbows.
[8905] <tantra> When steadied intently upon that,
[8906] <tantra> Day and night without distinction:
[8907] <tantra> Like the eyes of a wolf,
[8908] <tantra> Without day or night,
[8909] <tantra> Self-appearance mandala is likewise.
[8910] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 80 ||
[8911] Moreover, all empty-form rainbow-light thigle bodies and so forth
[8912] Are commonly said to exist in outer space,
[8913] And grasped as existing there.
[8914] Mistaken understanding is not so.
[8915] All that exist in inner body's clear light-nerve
[8916] Are seen as empty-forms through the eye's clear light-nerve drawn inward.
[8917] Moreover, the heart's resonance-nerve pervading everywhere spreading
[8918] Is the time of ground-appearance arising now.
[8919] Knowing one's own face, settling gently upon self-resonance,
[8920] Proceeding increasingly pure, || 90 ||
[8921] When wind and mind pure, through spontaneous presence's appearance, seeing whatever within the body, potency-ground dissolves, entering inward,
[8922] Reaching measure, going to exhaustion,
[8923] Then at setting, ground-appearance dissolving into ground, liberated in primordial purity.
[8924] All those appearances appear as increase, yet increase is without self-nature.
[8925] Inward self-reversal—there is no waning.
[8926] Here, what tantras and oral instructions say exists in outer space
[8927] Is provisionally spoken: because of the portion seen when directing the eye to conditioned outer space, and because it seems to exist there.
[8928] In nature, if existing outside, others could also see it.
[8929] Knowing it does not exist outside,
[8930] That others do not see one's own empty-form is because obscured by the body. || 100 ||
[8931] One's own seeing is like seeing the sun shining inside through the window of inwardly arising clear light-nerve.
[8932] The proof is that when eyes closed, seeing empty-forms also knows it exists inside.
[8933] Therefore, body and so forth's appearances, though not in outer objects, seem to exist,
[8934] Like a form reflected when looking in a mirror.
[8935] In the mirror of inner clear light-nerve,
[8936] The heart's awareness like-form resonance-appearance
[8937] Though not in objects, is seen inwardly through the quality of pure observed light-nerve.
[8938] Outer and inner two aspects confused—appearance only is delusion. Most ordinary beings accept this.
[8939] When the manner is understood thus, it is called born from the expanse of Great Perfection, person of wisdom.
[8940] The yogin of various self-liberation, like myself. || 110 ||
[8941] The manner of these, when conjoined with confident scripture,
[8942] From the Lion Complete Potency Great Tantra:
[8943] <tantra> All those body's appearances,
[8944] <tantra> Are not objects' appearances.
[8945] <tantra> For example, by a young maiden,
[8946] <tantra> Upon the mirror's clear characteristic,
[8947] <tantra> Her own face-appearance seen—
[8948] <tantra> To dharmatā's object-sky,
[8949] <tantra> Awareness's appearance arises as body.
[8950] <tantra> Seeing one's own actual state || 120 ||
[8951] <tantra> Is not existing in objects.
[8952] <tantra> Through pure observation, directly clear.
[8953] <tantra> With one's own mandala and retinue,
[8954] <tantra> Though wisdom's meaning is objectless,
[8955] <tantra> It appears as objects for sentient beings.
[8956] <tantra> Great realization in seen objects,
[8957] <tantra> Great bliss in understood objects.
[8958] <tantra> Great experience in seen appearance.
[8959] <tantra> Self-awareness alone, supreme companion.
[8960] <tantra> Because in appearance's objects it does not exist, || 130 ||
[8961] <tantra> From vajra chain itself,
[8962] <tantra> The body's portions inconceivable.
[8963] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[8964] This has meaning to be understood—the wise should realize.
[8965] In nature, easy to realize, called "body appearance"—there is no contradiction.
[8966] For the deluded, who see expanse-awareness and lamps appearing in outer space, it is explained for ease of understanding.
[8967] Inner meaning is as before.
[8968] Fifth: the manner of determining particular distinctions,
[8969] Through the crucial point of awareness's unchangeability,
