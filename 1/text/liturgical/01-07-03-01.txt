[9990] First: outer's outer—falsehood abandoning is.
<tantra> From the Wheel-Stacked Tantra:
<tantra> "Mantra's inclination spontaneous activity of rigpa,
<tantra> Migrate world common ones to also—
<tantra> False one's word, self-desire,
<tantra> Speak to, always joy having.
<tantra> Mantra recite power not arise, and
<tantra> Other spoke also holy not.
<tantra> Self's speech self recognized,
<tantra> Migrate world other's tongue-drip become. || 10 ||
<tantra> Future time in gadfly's body,
<tantra> Northern direction in experience become.
<tantra> That below bad-migrate suffering also,
<tantra> Aspects various experience become."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10005] Speech's outer's inner samaya: slander not-speak is.
<tantra> Again that same from:
<tantra> "Mantra in entered one's person whoever,
<tantra> Other two divide-enter slander speaks—
<tantra> Dharma spoke circles not-gather, and || 20 ||
<tantra> What done wrong become, and
<tantra> Not-practiced also enemy become, and
<tantra> Body to weapon strike, and
<tantra> Died after clawed body,
<tantra> Then bad-migrate sequence experience."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10016] Outer's secret: other's harsh-words abandoning is.
<tantra> Again that same from:
<tantra> "Always harsh-words word speaks:
<tantra> Former's karma and later's sign, || 30 ||
<tantra> Migrate world love-lacking friend also hate.
<tantra> Dharma's word also seek become.
<tantra> Died after very pride's body,
<tantra> Then bad-migrate three in circle."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10025] Speech's inner's three is:
<list> Dharma speak: outer,
<list> Accomplish: inner,
<list> Meditate speech: secret.
<tantra> From the Samaya Aspects Arranged Tantra: || 40 ||
<tantra> "Mantra one discipline in dwell,
<tantra> Dharma speak ones and dharma accomplish, and
<tantra> Dharma instructed one's person to,
<tantra> Grieve and blame bestow, and
<tantra> Scold and disparage's word speak if—
<tantra> Other's inclination recognized, and
<tantra> Self's possession recognized, and
<tantra> Self's dharmas forget confusion.
<tantra> Mind-thought different uneven become."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 50 ||
[10051] Secret's three is:
<list> Outer: vajra's siblings disparage,
<list> Inner: guru's mudra and near-circle,
<list> Secret: guru disparage is.
<tantra> From the Two-Joined Mudra Tantra:
<tantra> "Vajra brother and sister to,
<tantra> Word spoke and speech cut if—
<tantra> Aeon hundred into million in,
<tantra> Bad-migrate suffering unbearable indeed,
<tantra> Person this by experience, and || 60 ||
<tantra> Former not-done and present's sign,
<tantra> Sequence experience become is.
<tantra> Former done one's life this in,
<tantra> Middle from last experience to,
<tantra> Again former life's earlier at,
<tantra> This in done one's karma end is.
<tantra> Life's measure speech's karma,
<tantra> Circle and other's tongue-drip, and
<tantra> Sudden speech in speak stream stop.
<tantra> Guru's son and wife, and || 70 ||
<tantra> What near-dwell ones also suffice—
<tantra> Command from exceed and samaya exceed if,
<tantra> Former karma from two-times become,
<tantra> Or guru's distinction,
<tantra> Root and branch,
<tantra> Speech exceed speech in spoke, and
<tantra> Exaggerate-blame desire-word speak done if,
<tantra> Former karma from thousand-times become,
<tantra> Aspect ripen unbearable,
<tantra> Sequence guru's distinction also, || 80 ||
<tantra> Immediately experience become."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
<tantra> From the Great Arrangement also:
<tantra> "Guru and near's circle,
<tantra> Vajra's sibling and sister to,
<tantra> Bad-spoke word trace little also,
<tantra> Sign or actuality speak not-do.
<tantra> If dream in also,
<tantra> Arise if mind confess do.
<tantra> Actual and harsh done, and || 90 ||
<tantra> If mindfulness not-seized,
<tantra> Overturned become although not-confess if,
<tantra> Downward looked hell in go."
<tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[10084] Thus speech's samaya in divided by nine.
