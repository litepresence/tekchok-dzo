[10760] The essence being primordially pure and the nature being spontaneously accomplished are held to be non-dual.
[10761] From the Rangshar:
[10762] "The basis is spoken of as having two aspects:
[10763] The basis of great primordial purity, and
[10764] The basis of variegated spontaneous presence."
[10765] Thus it is said.
[10766] From the Klong drug pa:
[10767] "The essence itself is primordially pure;
[10768] The nature is spontaneously accomplished."
[10769] Thus it is said.
[10770] From the Mu tig phreng ba:
[10771] "The essence is primordially pure, free from the basis of expression;
[10772] The nature is spontaneously present, complete in whatever appears."
[10773] Thus it is.
