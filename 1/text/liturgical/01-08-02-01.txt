[10548] First: regarding the purpose of demonstrating that mere unceasing display cannot constitute the true recognition of liberation from samsara and nirvana.
[10549] The position holding that the ground of those two—samsara and nirvana—is mere unceasing display is thus also unreasonable upon analysis.
[10550] If rigpa were merely unceasing display without recognition, it would be unreasonable for samsara and nirvana to arise and cease without any recognition of its own face.
[10551] Or alternatively, who among sentient beings would ever become liberated without recognizing their own nature whatsoever?
[10552] If cause and effect were both primordially spontaneously accomplished from the very beginning without any dependence on recognition,
[10553] Then cause and effect would necessarily exist simultaneously as one essence, rendering all distinction meaningless.
[10554] If one accepts this position, then when the cause is established as samsara,
[10555] The effect would clearly not be able to manifest as nirvana, for they would be identical.
[10556] If those two—samsara and nirvana—were truly one essence, then samsara would necessarily follow wherever nirvana is present.
[10557] And nirvana following upon samsara would cause those two to be one without distinction—an absurd consequence. || 10 ||
[10558] If one accepts this identity, they cannot be separate in any meaningful way.
[10559] Clearly, pure and impure cannot exist simultaneously as cause and effect if they are one substance.
[10560] Because of these and many other logical faults, the position of mere unceasing display as the ground does not abide under scrutiny.
[10561] From the Klongdrukpa, treasury of the Great Perfection:
[10562] <prose><tantra> Mere spontaneous display being posited as the ground of all variety,
[10563] <prose><tantra> Is truly not the correct recognition of liberation.
[10564] <prose><tantra> If it were, it would necessarily become like this:
[10565] <prose><tantra> These sentient beings, without any effort or practice,
[10566] <prose><tantra> Would never attain liberation itself from confusion.
[10567] <prose><tantra> Non-recognition of one's own face becomes the cause of continued obscuration. || 20 ||
[10568] <prose><tantra> If mere awareness existing were said to be sufficient cause for liberation,
[10569] <prose><tantra> Then the effect—liberation—also would not become distinct from ordinary existence.
[10570] <prose><tantra> For example, just as charcoal piled upon black earth,
[10571] <prose><tantra> Cannot be cleaned to appear as pure white by any effort.
[10572] <prose><tantra> Like color that cannot change its fundamental nature,
[10573] <prose><tantra> Cause and effect would remain forever separate without connection.
[10574] Again, mere unceasing display cannot truly constitute the authentic recognition of realization,
[10575] For if cause and effect were established as truly one without distinction,
[10576] Then recognition and resting in one's own nature would become entirely unnecessary, rendering the direct path meaningless.
[10577] Therefore, to merely name unceasing display as the ground without understanding its true relation to primordial purity || 30 ||
[10578] Is not a meaning that can be genuinely understood or established through direct recognition.
[10579] Samantabhadra, the Primordial Buddha, spoke these words to me:
[10580] <prose><tantra> "O great bodhisattva, thus has the Teacher declared to the assembly,
[10581] <prose><tantra> According to your own understanding and realization,
[10582] <prose><tantra> This teaching of unceasing display as the sole ground exists merely among the conventional dharmas that can be known by the intellect,
[10583] <prose><tantra> And is not itself the correct essence of the ultimate recognition."
[10584] Thus it is declared.
[10585] The second position is also established and refuted in this manner:
[10586] Because the nature of awareness is not established as any definite entity, it remains uncertain and indeterminate;
[10587] Because conditions transform and alter it in every moment, it remains uncertain without fixed nature. || 40 ||
[10588] From the Semde teachings, the Mind Section of the Great Perfection, it is said:
[10589] <prose><tantra> "From the manifold names and designations given to uncertainty,
[10590] <prose><tantra> The meaning too is merely labels, empty in themselves like echoes.
[10591] <prose><tantra> Because the nature is not determined as singular or fixed,
[10592] <prose><tantra> Whatever label is applied through convention, appears accordingly without inherent reality."
[10593] Thus it is taught.
[10594] Second, the thorough refutation of that position holding uncertainty as the basis:
[10595] If the basis were truly one essence, it could not simultaneously be non-one—a direct logical contradiction; harm comes through reasoning about the impossibility of separate substances being one.
[10596] If that uncertain basis were truly the cause-base from which samsara arises, it would be clearly determined in itself as the cause of confusion through its own assertion.
[10597] Conversely, if it were truly the basis of nirvana, this too would be clearly established as determined in a contradictory manner. || 50 ||
[10598] Moreover, if that basis were established as inherently pure, impurity could not possibly arise from it; thus accepting both alternation between purity and impurity and fundamental uncertainty causes direct logical contradiction.
[10599] Moreover, proceeding logically from purity, impurity would also necessarily revert to purity, eliminating all distinction.
[10600] Because the basis would remain uncertain without any determinate ground or established nature.
[10601] Also, samsara and nirvana would mutually mix together without distinction, destroying the path and fruition.
[10602] The basis being fundamentally uncertain means it changes in every regard without any stability;
[10603] If one accepts this position, all sentient beings would be liberated without any effort or practice whatsoever,
[10604] While conversely, fully awakened Buddhas would revert to impure confusion, once again engaging with suffering.
[10605] Moreover, that basis would necessarily follow as a possession of mind rather than mind's true nature; thus asserting only uncertainty would itself constitute a form of determination, contradicting the original claim.
[10606] Many faults such as these and more would necessarily arise from this position.
[10607] From the Klong drug pa, profound treasury of Great Perfection teachings: || 60 ||
[10608] <prose><tantra> "The basis taught as fundamentally uncertain and indeterminate—
[10609] <prose><tantra> This too cannot truly constitute the authentic basis of reality.
[10610] <prose><tantra> I understand at this level of intelligence and analysis
[10611] <prose><tantra> That effects must necessarily possess alternation and change,
[10612] <prose><tantra> Or become endowed with reversion to their cause.
[10613] <prose><tantra> The uncertain itself becomes determined through its own existence,
[10614] <prose><tantra> And thus the uncertain becomes determined despite claims otherwise.
[10615] <prose><tantra> Because uncertainty must exist in itself to be asserted,
[10616] <prose><tantra> Being determined would be like the exhaustion of all possible action.
[10617] <prose><tantra> Are not all these knowable dharmas clear to the intelligent? || 70 ||
[10618] <prose><tantra> The Teacher has spoken thus regarding this fault."
[10619] Thus it is definitively established.
[10620] The third position is also expressed in this manner by proponents of philosophical views:
[10621] Because the essence of awareness does not change in its nature, it is like space itself—pervasive and unchanging;
[10622] Appearances, being unable to change in their fundamental nature, are accepted as determined and fixed, like the nature of fire and water.
[10623] Second, the thorough logical refutation of that position:
[10624] If the essence of awareness does not change in any way and appearances likewise cannot change,
[10625] Then samsara arising from that unchanging basis is not logically valid,
[10626] And consequently no one could possibly attain liberation from what never arose.
[10627] If nirvana existed primordially as an unchanging essence, there would be no difference from the eternalists' view of permanence maintained by non-Buddhist philosophers; accepting liberation arising from causes and conditions would directly contradict this position. || 80 ||
[10628] If one accepts that the essence of samsara, already being nirvana in itself, does not change,
[10629] Then if the essence itself is already nirvana without change, liberation through practice would not be necessary at all—
[10630] Just as fire, being hot by its very nature, requires no change or effort to become hot.
[10631] If one says this analysis is necessary only regarding mental appearances and not the basis itself,
[10632] This contradicts the fundamental position that appearances cannot change if the basis is unchanging.
[10633] Being that the appearance of samsara itself manifests from the basis,
[10634] If one says it is not the appearance of the basis but something separate,
[10635] It necessarily follows that that basis would possess duality—appearing and not appearing—which is absurd.
[10636] Because the appearance of samsara exists separate from the basis itself in this view, creating duality where none should exist.
[10637] Moreover, if one realizes that basis and accepts determination, it cannot constitute the authentic basis that transcends all extremes. || 90 ||
[10638] If a basis of realization were to exist inherently before realization itself occurs,
[10639] Then a merely cognizing mind arises independently, and thus realization does not depend upon realizing the basis—making realization meaningless.
[10640] Yet the basis depends upon the mind of realization to be known, creating circular dependence.
[10641] Because realization must exist beforehand to realize the basis, this logical error pervades the entire position.
[10642] If what is not realized is also claimed to be the basis, what knows it to be the basis?
[10643] If ordinary mind knows it, then not realizing it also becomes the basis—rendering all distinction meaningless.
[10644] Perceive also the many faults that follow logically from this untenable position.
[10645] From the Klong drug pa, treasury of Dzogchen instructions:
[10646] <prose><tantra> "Regarding the determined basis that is taught by some proponents,
[10647] <prose><tantra> This too is not the correct essence of the authentic basis. || 100 ||
[10648] <prose><tantra> Just as for those with the eye disease of yellowing vision,
[10649] <prose><tantra> A pure white conch appears mistakenly as yellow,
[10650] <prose><tantra> Through the distinction of reversion to oneself and other,
[10651] <prose><tantra> Self and other are free of the two extremes of determination.
[10652] <prose><tantra> Therefore that view too is not correct upon analysis.
[10653] <prose><tantra> Or, because cause is determined and effect is determined as identical,
[10654] <prose><tantra> The self becomes no different from the eternalist view of permanence.
[10655] <prose><tantra> Are not these knowable dharmas apparent to the wise?
[10656] <prose><tantra> What was said before accords with what has been shown here."
[10657] Thus it is definitively established by reasoning. || 110 ||
[10658] The fourth position is also expressed by proponents of this view:
[10659] The essence is not divided into directions or categories in its true nature,
[10660] While appearances are changeable in whatever manner through conditions.
[10661] Second, the logical refutation of that untenable position:
[10662] If the basis were truly changeable in its essence, pure enlightened Buddhas would devolve into impure confusion.
[10663] Whoever accepts this unacceptable consequence follows that sentient beings, without any effort or practice, spontaneously change into Buddhas and are liberated.
[10664] Also, effect would illogically revert to cause, destroying temporal sequence.
[10665] Because it would be a basis of fundamental change rather than stability.
[10666] Earth and other material elements would become awareness, and
[10667] Awareness would also devolve into matter—absurd consequences. || 120 ||
[10668] Moreover, if that which is not divided into categories of essence in the basis itself changes,
[10669] Or if appearances other than essence change,
[10670] If the essence itself changes, essence cannot coherently be called the basis.
[10671] Because it would change into a dharma other than the authentic basis.
[10672] If appearances other than essence change, the essence itself would be damaged by changing somewhere, compromising its integrity.
[10673] Also, one must ask: does the permanent change, or
[10674] Does the impermanent change in this view?
[10675] The permanent cannot change by definition, like space which remains unaltered.
[10676] The impermanent does not need to change through effort, for it has already changed by its very nature.
[10677] Also, through the reasoning of the three times—past, present, and future—past and future cannot be changed, being non-existent in the present moment. || 130 ||
[10678] The present has already arisen and immediately ceased, so it cannot be changed.
[10679] The later part of a moment is not yet born, being non-existent, so there is nothing to change.
[10680] Because change cannot be perceived in any of the three times, that the basis is changeable in whatever way is not logically valid.
[10681] From that very source of reasoning,
[10682] As was said before by the Teacher regarding what is called changeable:
[10683] <prose><tantra> "If one's own state of the basis is held to be changeable,
[10684] <prose><tantra> This too is no different from being fundamentally undetermined.
[10685] <prose><tantra> Because effect itself reverts to cause without sequence,
[10686] <prose><tantra> Effort becomes unnecessary for those who hold this view.
[10687] <prose><tantra> Because again and again it reverts circularly, || 140 ||
[10688] <prose><tantra> Who could possibly make matter into awareness?
[10689] <prose><tantra> It is not possible by any valid reasoning.
[10690] <prose><tantra> Are not these knowable dharmas apparent upon investigation?
[10691] <prose><tantra> What was said before is just like this demonstration."
[10692] Thus it is definitively established.
[10693] The fifth position is also expressed by proponents holding this view:
[10694] Because awareness, in its essence, has no fixed direction and arises pervasively everywhere, it accepts whatever arises without discrimination.
[10695] Second, the refutation of that untenable position:
[10696] Whatever accepts appearances in that manner,
[10697] Does it accept that it dwells inherently in the basis as the same essence, or || 150 ||
[10698] Does it accept that it does not dwell in the basis as separate?
