[10548] First from nirvana spontaneous accomplish one's purpose.
[10549] That two's basis spontaneous-presence is thus also not-reasonable.
[10550] Spontaneous-presence is if not-change samsara-nirvana arise not-reasonable.
[10551] Or who also effort not-have liberate become.

[10552] Cause-effect primordially spontaneously-accomplished being cause.
[10553] Like-that-if cause-effect time simultaneous follows.
[10554] Accept-if cause samsara be time.
[10555] Effect nirvana-from not being cause clear.
[10556] Those two one-if samsara nirvana-as follows.

[10560] Those and other also faults many not dwell.
[10561] Klong-drug-pa from,
[10562] Spontaneous-accomplishment variety base that also.
[10563] Correct base truly not.
[10564] If be then like-this become.
[10565] These sentient beings effort,
[10566] Liberation itself-as not become.
[10567] Non-recognition itself obscured cause.
[10568] Awareness exist cause liberation said-if,
[10569] Effect also liberation itself not become or.
[10570] For-example charcoal black upon,
[10571] Cleaning pure white of.
[10572] Color change able not like.
[10573] Cause and effect separate cause.
[10574] Again spontaneous-accomplishment not.
[10575] Like-that cause and effect one-if,
[10576] Effort those-for need not become.
[10577] Therefore spontaneous-accomplishment called base.

[10591] Nature one-as not determined cause.
[10592] Whatever label that-like appear.
[10593] Thus.
[10594] Second that refutation.
[10595] One be-if one not be direct-contradiction substance separate cause reason harms.
[10596] Base not-determined that samsara cause-base be-if that itself-as determined cause own-word clear.
[10597] Nirvana-of base be-if also clear.
[10598] Also base that pure be-if impure not cause alternation not-determined accept cause contradict and.

[10609] This also base truly not-able.
[10610] I intelligence level this-like understand.
[10611] Effect alternation possess-or.
[10612] Or revert with become.
[10613] Not-determined determined become and.
[10614] Not-determined determined become.
[10615] Own not-determined own exist cause.
[10616] Determined be-if action end like.
[10617] This all knowable not.
[10618] Teacher said that-like.

[10625] Base that-from samsara arise not valid and.
[10626] Who also liberate not possible.
[10627] Nirvana primordially exist-if eternalist permanent and difference not cause condition-from liberate accept cause contradict.
[10628] Samsara-of essence nirvana being cause not change thus accept-if.
[10629] Essence nirvana be-if just liberate not necessary.
[10630] Fire hot just change not necessary like.

[10638] Realization-of before realization-base exist and,
[10639] Then cognition-of mind arise cause realization-to base not depend.
[10640] Base-to realization-of mind depend even.
[10641] Realization-of before exist must cause pervade.
[10642] Not realize also base be-if base being what know.
[10643] Mind know-if not realize also base being fall.
[10644] Those etcetera-of faults perceive also.
[10645] Klong-drug from,
[10646] Determined base called show-to,
[10647] This also correct essence not.
[10648] For-example eye yellow-possess those-to,
[10649] Conch-from yellow appear like.
[10650] Self-to revert-of distinction,
[10651] Self other two not determined limit free.
[10652] Therefore that also correct not.
[10653] Or cause determined effect determined cause.
[10654] Self permanent and difference not become.
[10655] This also knowable not.
[10656] Said that also previous and same.

[10676] Impermanent change not necessary change already cause.
[10677] Also three-times-of reason past future change possible not being non-existent be and.
[10678] Present early arise ceased.
[10679] Later part not born cause non-existent cause.
