[10548] First, regarding the purpose of being spontaneously accomplished from nirvana.
[10549] The basis of those two being spontaneous presence is thus also unreasonable.
[10550] If it is spontaneous presence, it is unreasonable for samsara and nirvana to arise without change.
[10551] Or who would become liberated without effort?


### PAGE 257

[10552] If cause and effect were primordially spontaneously accomplished,
[10553] Then cause and effect would exist simultaneously.
[10554] If one accepts this, then when the cause is samsara,
[10555] The effect is clearly not being nirvana.
[10556] If those two were one, samsara would follow as nirvana.
[10557] Nirvana following as samsara would cause those two to be one.
[10558] If one accepts this, they cannot be separate.
[10559] Clearly, pure and impure exist as cause.
[10560] Because of those and many other faults, they do not abide.
[10561] From the Klongdrukpa:
[10562] Spontaneous accomplishment being the base of variety,
[10563] Is truly not the correct basis.
[10564] If it were, it would become like this:
[10565] These sentient beings, without effort,
[10566] Would not become liberation itself.
[10567] Non-recognition itself is the cause of obscuration.
[10568] If awareness existing is said to be the cause of liberation,
[10569] The effect also would not become liberation itself.
[10570] For example, like charcoal upon black,
[10571] Being cleaned as pure white.
[10572] Like color that cannot change,
[10573] Cause and effect are separate causes.
[10574] Again, spontaneous presence cannot constitute the true basis,
[10575] For if cause and effect were established as truly one,
[10576] Then effort and exertion would become entirely unnecessary.
[10577] Therefore, to name spontaneous presence as the basis
[10578] Is not a meaning that can be genuinely understood.
[10579] Samantabhadra spoke these words to me:
[10580] "O great bodhisattva, thus has the Teacher declared,
[10581] According to your own understanding,
[10582] This exists merely among the dharmas that can be known,
[10583] And is not itself the correct essence."
[10584] Thus it is.
[10585] The second position is also established in this way:
[10586] Because the nature is not established, it remains uncertain;
[10587] Because conditions transform it, it remains uncertain.
[10588] From the Semde teachings, it is said:
[10589] "From the manifold names given to uncertainty,
[10590] The meaning too is merely labels, empty in themselves.
[10591] Because the nature is not determined as singular,
[10592] Whatever label is applied, appears accordingly."
[10593] Thus it is.
[10594] Second, the refutation of that position:
[10595] If it were one, it could not be non-one—a direct contradiction; harm comes through reasoning about separate substances.
[10596] If that uncertain basis were the cause-base of samsara, it would be clearly determined in itself through its own assertion.
[10597] If it were the basis of nirvana, this too would be clearly established.
[10598] Moreover, if that basis were pure, impurity could not arise; accepting alternation and uncertainty causes contradiction.


### PAGE 258

[10599] Moreover, from purity, impurity would also revert.
[10600] Because the basis would be uncertain without any ground.
[10601] Also, samsara and nirvana would mutually mix together.
[10602] The basis being uncertain means it changes in every regard;
[10603] If one accepts this, sentient beings would be liberated without any effort,
[10604] While Buddhas would revert to impurity, engaging with suffering.
[10605] Moreover, that basis would follow as a mind-possessor; thus asserting only uncertainty would itself be determined.
[10606] Many faults such as these would arise.
[10607] From the Klong drug pa, it is said:
[10608] "The basis taught as uncertain—
[10609] This too cannot truly constitute the basis.
[10610] I understand at this level of intelligence
[10611] That effects possess alternation,
[10612] Or become endowed with reversion.
[10613] Uncertain becomes determined,
[10614] And uncertain becomes determined.
[10615] Because uncertainty exists in itself,
[10616] Being determined would be like the exhaustion of action.
[10617] Are not all these knowable dharmas?
[10618] The Teacher has spoken thus."
[10619] Thus it is.
[10620] The third position is also expressed in this manner:
[10621] Because the essence does not change, it is like space itself;
[10622] Appearances, being unable to change, are accepted as determined, like fire and water.
[10623] Second, the refutation of that position:
[10624] If the essence does not change and appearances cannot change,
[10625] Then samsara arising from that basis is not valid,
[10626] And no one could possibly attain liberation.
[10627] If nirvana existed primordially, there would be no difference from the eternalists' view of permanence; accepting liberation from causes and conditions would contradict this.
[10628] If one accepts that the essence of samsara, being nirvana, does not change,
[10629] Then if the essence itself is nirvana, liberation would not be necessary at all—
[10630] Just as fire, being hot, requires no change whatsoever.
[10631] If one says this is necessary regarding mental appearances,
[10632] This contradicts the position that appearances cannot change.
[10633] Being the appearance of samsara itself,
[10634] If one says it is not the appearance of the basis,
[10635] It follows that that basis would possess duality.
[10636] Because the appearance of samsara exists separate from the basis itself.
[10637] Moreover, if one realizes that basis and accepts determination, it cannot constitute the basis.


### PAGE 259

[10638] If a basis of realization exists before realization itself,
[10639] Then a cognizing mind arises, and thus realization does not depend upon the basis.
[10640] Yet the basis depends upon the mind of realization.
[10641] Because realization must exist beforehand, this pervades all.
[10642] If what is not realized is also the basis, what knows it to be the basis?
[10643] If mind knows it, then not realizing it also becomes the basis.
[10644] Perceive also the many faults that follow from this.
[10645] From the Klong drug pa, it is said:
[10646] "Regarding the determined basis that is taught,
[10647] This too is not the correct essence.
[10648] Just as for those with yellow-eyed disease,
[10649] A conch appears yellow,
[10650] Through the distinction of reversion to oneself,
[10651] Self and other are free of the two extremes of determination.
[10652] Therefore that too is not correct.
[10653] Or, because cause is determined and effect is determined,
[10654] Self becomes no different from permanence.
[10655] Are not these knowable dharmas?
[10656] What was said accords with what came before."
[10657] Thus it is.
[10658] The fourth position is also expressed:
[10659] The essence is not divided into directions or categories,
[10660] While appearances are changeable in whatever manner.
[10661] Second, the refutation of that:
[10662] If the basis were changeable, pure Buddhas would become impure confusion.
[10663] Whoever accepts this follows that sentient beings, without effort, change into Buddhas and are liberated.
[10664] Also, effect would revert to cause.
[10665] Because it would be a basis of change.
[10666] Earth and other matter would become awareness, and
[10667] Awareness would also become matter.
[10668] Moreover, if that which is not divided into categories of essence changes,
[10669] Or if other changes,
[10670] If the essence changes, essence cannot be the basis.
[10671] Because it would change into a dharma other than the basis.
[10672] If other changes, the essence would be damaged by changing anywhere.
[10673] Also, does the permanent change, or
[10674] Does the impermanent change?
[10675] The permanent cannot change, like space.
[10676] The impermanent does not need to change, for it has already changed.
[10677] Also, through the reasoning of the three times, past and future cannot be changed, being non-existent.
[10678] The present has already arisen and ceased.
[10679] The later part is not born, being non-existent.


### PAGE 260

[10680] Because change cannot be perceived, that the basis is changeable in whatever way is not valid.
[10681] From that very source,
[10682] As was said before regarding what is called changeable:
[10683] "If one's own state is changeable,
[10684] This too is no different from being undetermined.
[10685] Because effect itself reverts to cause,
[10686] Effort becomes unnecessary for those.
[10687] Because again and again it reverts,
[10688] Who could make matter into awareness?
[10689] It is not possible.
[10690] Are not these knowable dharmas?
[10691] What was said is just like that."
[10692] Thus it is.
[10693] The fifth position is also expressed:
[10694] Because awareness, in its essence, has no direction and arises everywhere, it accepts whatever arises.
[10695] Second, the refutation of that:
[10696] Whatever accepts that,
[10697] Does it accept that it dwells in the basis, or
[10698] Does it accept that it does not dwell?
