[6760] <prose> Here, for the definite arrangement of that abode, three:
[6761] <prose> The basis for entering empowerment,
[6762] <prose> The path of actual empowerment,
[6763] <prose> The result of completed empowerment.
[6764] <prose> First, four:
[6765] <prose> The characteristic of the guru who bestows-accomplishes,
[6766] <prose> The self-nature of the student who is bestowed,
[6767] <prose> The Dharma to be done in common,
[6768] <prose> The activity of empowerment, how bestowed. || 10 ||

[6770] <prose> Completing all qualities suitable for guru, free from all faults, great waves of compassion—
[6771] <prose><tantra> From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[6772] <verse> "The vajra-meaning-possessing guru,
[6773] <prose> Of good nature and skilled in teaching,
[6774] <prose> Having obtained empowerment, applies the meaning of secret mantra,
[6775] <prose> Knows all outer and inner actions,
[6776] <prose> Without gathering and separation from the yi-dam deity,
[6777] <prose> Without distraction from samādhi,
[6778] <prose> Possessing the meaning of Dzogchen instructions, || 20 ||
[6779] <prose> Skilled in the tantra of secret mantra secrets,
[6780] <prose> Does all outer and inner accomplishments,
[6781] <prose> Not transgressing from the meaning of view,
[6782] <prose> Has released outer and inner secret actions.
[6783] <prose> Like a jewel of qualities,
[6784] <prose> Engaging the inexhaustible treasure."
[6785] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[6786] <prose><tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[6787] <verse> "The great Vajradhara guru's.
[6788] <prose> Sequence is to be explained; || 30 ||
[6789] <prose> The guru of complete characteristics.
[6790] <prose> Is the source of all qualities,
[6791] <prose> The holder of the basis of perfect awakening."
[6792] <prose> Thus it is spoken.
[6793] <prose> Here, possessing six characteristics:
[6794] <prose> Discarding saṃsāra's dharmas behind,
[6795] <prose> Few desires and knowing contentment,
[6796] <prose> Skilled in application and possessing experience,
[6797] <prose> Skilled in the tantra's word-meaning and earnest in accomplishment,
[6798] <prose> Skilled in the meaning of view and complete in capability, || 40 ||
[6799] <prose> Great compassion and joy in giving.
