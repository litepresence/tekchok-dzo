[9611] Hundred twenty-eight: empowerment results' perfections
[9612] <list> Third: Mastery through infinite clairvoyance
[9613] From four empowerments' seed-parts: 666
[9614] Purifying six realms' karma and afflictions
[9615] First: Pure vision from pure seeing
[9616] Self's uncontaminated clairvoyance
[9617] Six sense-empowerment purifications seeing three times as one, like Prasenajit's vision
[9618] Eye clairvoyance six: Knows all forms
[9619] Ear clairvoyance six: Comprehends all voiced sounds
[9620] Nose six: Knows six realms' karma
[9621] Tongue six: Knows six realms' retinues and enjoyments
[9622] Body six: Knows six realms' form atoms coarse and subtle
[9623] Mind six: Knows six realms' thoughts
[9624] Thus divided by basis: Thirty sense-empowerment clairvoyances knowing thirty existence branches
[9625] Thirty-two marks' perfection arising from thirty-two empowerments
[9626] Then wisdom's pure vision clairvoyance six arises
[9627] Cultivated wisdom's pure vision wisdom six dawning
[9628] Understanding all words' symbolic meaning
[9629] Trained wisdom's pure vision clairvoyance six
[9630] Special entry into mind-dharmatā
[9631] Pure vision applied to all
[9632] Heard wisdom's clairvoyance six: Knows all sound and meaning
[9633] Arisen-from-contemplation wisdom's clairvoyance six: Realizes all dharmas' aggregates
[9634] Arisen-from-meditation wisdom's clairvoyance six: Knows dharmas and mind blended like space
[9635] Thus thirty: Empowerment-changing thirty-two
[9636] Buddhas' cultivated qualities thirty-two arising from vision
[9637] Then wisdom's pure vision clairvoyance six dawns
[9638] At this time: Obtaining stainless wisdom eye, free from dust
[9639] Mirror-like wisdom's pure vision clairvoyance six: Directly knows dharmas' characteristics and intent
[9640] Equality's six: Knows saṃsāra-nirvāṇa non-dual

[9643] Dharmadhātu's six: Knows all Buddha-qualities
[9644] Non-abiding wisdom's six: Knows non-abiding in any dharma
[9645] Thus divided by basis: Five sets of six clairvoyances
[9646] Wisdom clairvoyance thirty arising from thirty-two empowerments
[9647] Then liberation's clairvoyance six dawns
[9648] At this time: Mind and mental factors subside
[9649] First liberation's pure vision clairvoyance six dawning
[9650] Body's outflows exhausted
[9651] Second liberation six: Speech's outflows exhausted
[9652] Third six: Mind's outflows exhausted
[9653] Fourth six: Consciousness's outflows exhausted
[9654] Fifth six: Prajñā-aggregate obstruction outflows exhausted
[9655] Sixth six: Dharma and dharmatā outflows exhausted
[9656] These thirty arising from perfect outer-inner-secret empowerments
[9657] Then body-speech-mind activities manifest clairvoyance six dawns
[9658] Buddha's knowledge completely perfected
[9659] Actual body pure vision clairvoyance six dawning: Sees all Buddha-bodies, obtains oneself too
[9660] Body's radiance six: Plays in infinite light masses
[9661] Actual speech six: Plays in sixty vocal tones
[9662] Speech's radiance six: Plays in various sounds
[9663] Actual mind six: Plays in all samādhis
[9664] Mind's radiance six: Plays in knowing others' minds
[9665] Thus thirty arising from thirty-two deity empowerments
[9666] Then dharmatā's pure vision clairvoyance six dawns
[9667] At this time: Dwelling indivisible in dharmatā intent
[9668] Mind-taming clairvoyance six dawning: Knows mind's nature
[9669] Mind-purifying six: Knows root
[9670] Mind-pacifying six: Knows mindless characteristic
[9671] Mind-purifying six: Knows unchanging
[9672] Mind-non-reversing six: Knows three realms nameless
[9673] Mind-transcending six: Knower and gathering pure, irreversible realization
[9674] Thus thirty arising from knowing empowerment display divisions
[9675] Thus pure vision's 180 clairvoyances arising from mere devoted vision
[9676] Also analyzed: Faith's forty-five each producing five qualities
[9677] Arising from obtained elaborated empowerment
[9678] Similarly: Heard purification's clairvoyance also becomes 180
[9679] In it too: Four wisdoms' qualities enter as before
[9680] These arising from non-elaborated empowerment
[9681] Contemplation-purified 180 arising from knowing transformation-basis
[9682] Wisdom-purified and
[9683] Experiencing-purified 180 knowing nature
[9684] Contact-purified 180 knowing sūtras
[9685] Three sets: Arising from utterly non-elaborated empowerment
[9686] Dharma-purified clairvoyance 180 arising from completely non-elaborated empowerment
[9687] Thus: Joined with grounds, grounds' qualities 2360
[9688] Wisdom's activity 660
[9689] Dharma's categories 3120 are Vajradhara's ground clairvoyance display great divisions
[9690] These are empowerment's arrangements
[9691] Secret Mantra Vajra Vehicle's first gate's important basis is correct
[9692] From Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury
[9693] Ground meaning ripening subject and empowerment arrangements—sixth story
[9694] Thus after well-explaining empowerment's gate
[9695] Its definite abode is samaya, therefore
[9696] Explaining it: For all entering unexcelled Secret Mantra gate, samaya alone is crucial
[9697] Here to be established: Three
[9698] Samaya's nature generally shown
[9699] Body-speech-mind samaya specifically explained
[9700] Unexcelled samaya supremely shown
[9701] First: Samaya's essence
[9702] Definitive meaning, division, support, benefits, flaws, restoration methods, protection methods—eight
