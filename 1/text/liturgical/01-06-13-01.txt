[9518] <list> First, the Dharmakāya Teacher: Glorious Samantabhadra,
[9519] Abiding within the Dharmadhātu expanse beyond expression,
[9520] Teaching the mind-essence of all Buddhas,
[9521] With retinue unconditioned and spontaneously present,
[9522] Time: Dharmatā without change or transformation—the five perfections establishing the Dharmakāya.
[9523] Field: The pure realm itself, inexpressible,
[9524] Dharma beyond all expression,
[9525] Effortless and spontaneously accomplished through the nature of reality—this is called Dharmakāya.
[9526] The five perfections,
[9527] Beyond expression, and
[9528] Spontaneously accomplished—these two,
[9529] Making eight.
[9530] The four seeds of the four empowerments, and
[9531] The four results—eight, arising from ripening.
[9532] <list> The Saṃbhogakāya Teacher: Vairocana of the Gaṅgā Lake,
[9533] Abiding in Akaniṣṭha, the Dense Array,
[9534] Teaching the self-arisen six syllables, whose natural sound emanates as rays of light from the tongue—the single son of the teaching,
[9535] With retinue: self-awareness, the eye, the four Buddha families,
[9536] Time: the great purity of innate nature,
[9537] Field: Upon the ground of equanimity,
[9538] Twenty-five stacked above,
[9539] Sixteen below the vajra posture.
[9540] These appear as stacked slate when viewed from above and below, with pure space dividing the middle,
[9541] Mutually arranged like tents spread below one another,
[9542] Each divided by iron mountains and oceans where they abide.
[9543] The Dharma: engaging with the self-nature of great purity,
[9544] Established thus: engaging with light, color, form, and wisdom—this is called Saṃbhogakāya.
[9545] This too: pure light-ray union, entering from the father's face and emerging from mother's sky through the secret place, emanating emanations,
[9546] The five perfections,
[9547] Field and emanation—two, making eight.
[9548] This too: the result of the eight empowerments.
[9549] <list> The Nirmāṇakāya Teacher: The Sixth Vajradhara.
[9550] Abode: Tuṣita, called Ogmin—the distinction of names,
[9551] Teaching: the Great Perfection of innate nature,
[9552] Retinue: worldly and transcendent,
[9553] Time: the time of taming beings through form,
[9554] Field: the vast realm of great purity.
[9555] When the pure essence emerges: the Sahā world with its four continents and Mount Meru, a hundred million.
[9556] <list> Dharma teaching: actual and reflection—these two;
[9557] Suitable for taming whoever needs taming—emanated emanation body,
[9558] Self and other's benefit, two complete activities—eight.
[9559] <list> The Svābhāvikakāya Teacher: Samyaksaṃbuddha, pure beyond thought and expression,
[9560] Abode: transcending thought, free from characteristics and basis,
[9561] Teaching: without dust or stain,
[9562] Retinue: the ocean of wisdom,
[9563] Field: the realm of great bliss, completely pure,
[9564] Dharma: without distinguishing faces,
[9565] Activity: transcending the mind's mistaken perception—eight.
[9566] All these—the nature of that: the four kāyas of marks.
[9567] <list> The Dharmakāya Teacher: unfabricated nature,
