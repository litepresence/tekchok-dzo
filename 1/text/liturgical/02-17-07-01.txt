[3005] First—fear arise from fierce conditions water, fire, dog, enemy, etc.—think sit within dream—called harsh-hold, hold certainly.
[3006] Then all how-dreamed held come.
[3007] Held-time emanation.
[3008] By made emanation one-to-many—day mind's deity-form, sentient-beings, different appearances many—emanate.
[3009] See like emanation within dream.
[3010] Then mutual god-naga transform.
[3011] Transform male-female.
[3012] Certain is arise within dream—trained day without distraction from aspiration—transform one-to-many, many-to-one.
[3013] Then travel there within dream, hear dharma etc.—mind made before not-reached place, realms, etc.
[3014] If made these fierce aspiration—quickly mastered.
[3015] Yet explained dream meditation actual some.
[3016] Here suitable as preliminary—because not free from intellect truth-grasping—merely held dream, emanate-transform not dharmata meaning.
[3017] Before most not explained this exists—very important point said suppression explanation, dream point oral-instruction, and.

[3018] Is certainty taken self-experience.
[3019] Second, actual—three:
[3020] Dharmata-meaning point,
[3021] Means, and—
[3022] Focus point,
[3023] Channel-wind binding point.
[3024] From three: train, transform, cut.
[3025] Meditate all three—very difficult, and—
[3026] Yet also said whichever one enough—easy, two medium.
[3027] Train all in practice when do guide this—meditate all time.
[3028] First train dream—day appearances all—last night's dreamed dream—clear aspiration—made emanate-transform, and.
[3029] Train outer truth-without time—training-rigpa look—arise-arise base-without, root-free nature—naked, clearly meditate.
[3030] All fixation-without, truth-without, base-without, recognition-without—recognize appearances' nature—one-pointed—meditate without losing effort-force—appearances only—actually illusion-dream arise—karma, latency, deluded-appearance, deluded-grasping all cease.
[3031] And arise without distraction from that state within dream.
[3032] Day-night dharmata-wheel—not beyond.
[3033] Dream-transform from appearance-emptiness two.
[3034] Appearance-transform point—depend made upon showing deity-form in mirror, and.
[3035] Transform all appearances to deity's mandala, and—
[3036] Transform to Buddha's realm, and—
[3037] Do by fierce aspiration transforming illusion's eight-examples.
[3038] Transform emptiness—like smoke clearing, cloud gathering in sky.
[3039] Moment-emptiness deluded-appearance—wide flat flat meditate.
[3040] Become that thus within dream.
[3041] Upon this itself how appear time—dream cut.
[3042] Not establish rigpa-hold top intermediate-space.
[3043] Not hold appearance form-reflection top here-rig.
[3044] Not confused by thought of connection between appearance-mind two.

[3048] Whatever mind not do—vast release inner-clear self-clear rigpa.
[3049] Made thus—first dream coarse.
[3050] Then subtle.
[3051] Then fade.
[3052] Gone increasingly few, finally anything not dream—practice meaning day-night mixed self-clear rigpa concentration—meditation called day-night union.
[3053] Upon second means-focus point:
[3054] Stir, and—
[3055] Squeeze.
[3056] From three: throw point.
