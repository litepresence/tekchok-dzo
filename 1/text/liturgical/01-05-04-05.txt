[6423] At the sixth, the thousand light-rays' rim-protector, and

The sixth emanation in the sequence of primordial teachers manifests during the sixth teaching epoch as the thousand light-rays' rim-protector ('od stong gi mu khyud skyong ba). This emanation's title evokes the imagery of a protective rim or border constituted by a thousand rays of light, suggesting a mandala-like structure where this Buddha guards the periphery while maintaining connection to the central essence.

According to the Great Arrangement (mahāvyūha) teachings recorded in the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra:

"At the sixth teaching,
The thousand light-rays' rim-protector,
By the thousand families, this very concealed."

This emanation is described as being concealed "by the thousand families" (rigs stong gis shin tu sbas), referring to the thousand Buddha-families or lineages that constitute the complete mandala of enlightenment. The "rim-protector" (mu khyud skyong ba) function suggests a boundary-dwelling presence that maintains the integrity of the dharma realm while simultaneously extending protective influence to all beings within the sphere of its light-rays.

The "thousand light-rays" ('od stong) represent the manifold skillful means through which this Buddha's wisdom-activity manifests. Unlike the single sun of the fourth emanation, these multiple rays suggest a more differentiated, personalized approach to liberation—each ray adapted to the specific capacities and karmic dispositions of the beings it touches. The rim or border (mu khyud) imagery indicates that this emanation operates at the interface between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, between the conditioned and the unconditioned, protecting beings as they transition from one state to another.

As the sixth in the sequence, this emanation prepares the ground for the final, culminating emanation that follows—the saṃsāra-destroyer king who brings the entire emanation cycle to its completion. The rim-protector ensures that no beings fall through the cracks of existence, that all find their place within the mandala of liberation, before the final dissolution that the seventh emanation represents.
