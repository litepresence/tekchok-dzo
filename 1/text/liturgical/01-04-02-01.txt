[2539] Selflessness of persons is established through outer grasping being non-existent.
[2540] Selflessness of dharmas is established through lack of true existence in phenomena.
[2541] Thus is explained the complete Sautrāntika view.
[2542] Herein, how should one explain the cultivation of the path?
[2543] The antidote for the three poisons of desire, anger, and delusion is the realization of emptiness.
[2544] Individual antidotes are applied: meditation on impurity as antidote for desire,
[2545] Meditation on love as antidote for anger, and meditation on dependent arising as antidote for delusion.
[2546] The faculties of practitioners are classified as dull, medium, and sharp.
[2547] Effort is made according to the capacity of these faculties.
[2548] The bodhisattvas' path is that of the five previously described transcendent perfections. || 10 ||
[2549] Thus is explained the cultivation of the path in brief.
[2550] Herein, how should one explain the effects or results?
[2551] For hearers, the four effects: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and foe-destroyer.
[2552] For the self-enlightened: solitary rhinoceros-like pratyekabuddhas.
[2553] For bodhisattvas: the ten grounds beginning with great joy.
[2554] Thus are explained the various effects.
[2555] Herein, how should one explain the self-enlightened vehicle?
[2556] They realize dependent arising through their own power of wisdom,
[2557] Without relying upon a teacher in their final life.
[2558] Like a rhinoceros wandering alone, they practice in solitude. || 20 ||
[2559] Thus is explained the self-enlightened vehicle.
[2560] Herein, how should one explain the bodhisattva vehicle?
[2561] Through generation of bodhicitta and engagement in the six perfections,
[2562] Perfecting the two accumulations, they attain enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings.
[2563] Thus is explained the bodhisattva vehicle in brief.
[2564] Maha, Anu, and Ati are taught.
[2565] From the Great Array of Ati:
[2566] The phenomena taught by me
[2567] Herein, explaining in detail the Great Vehicle:
[2568] First, the essence of the bodhisattva vehicle: || 30 ||
[2569] The generation of bodhicitta and engagement in the six transcendent perfections.
[2570] Definition: That vehicle which is entered through the power of compassion.
[2571] Purpose: Establishing all sentient beings in the state of buddhahood.
[2572] Effect: Attaining the ten grounds and traversing the five paths.
[2573] Division: Two systems—the Prajñāpāramitā system and the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2574] Thus is explained the bodhisattva vehicle in detail.
[2575] Herein, the Prajñāpāramitā system:
[2576] Realizing the three circles—subject, object, and action—as empty of inherent existence,
[2577] Perfecting the six transcendent perfections,
[2578] Attaining buddhahood through traversing the five paths and ten grounds. || 40 ||
[2579] Thus is explained the Prajñāpāramitā system.
[2580] Herein, the Tathāgatagarbha system:
[2581] Recognizing the Buddha-nature endowed with all virtues as existent from the beginning,
[2582] Purifying adventitious defilements that obscure it,
[2583] Revealing the essence spontaneously present as the result.
[2584] Thus is explained the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2585] Herein, the grounds and paths:
[2586] The five paths: accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, and no-more-learning.
[2587] The ten grounds: joyous, stainless, luminous, radiant, difficult-to-conquer, manifest, gone-afar, immovable, good-intelligence, and cloud-of-dharma.
[2588] Thus are explained the grounds and paths. || 50 ||
[2589] Herein, the two accumulations:
[2590] Merit accumulated through the first five perfections of generosity, morality, patience, effort, and concentration,
[2591] Wisdom accumulated through the perfection of discernment or prajñā.
[2592] Thus are explained the two accumulations.
[2593] Herein, the final ground:
[2594] The tenth ground, called cloud-of-dharma,
[2595] Where the bodhisattva is surrounded by Buddhas and receives the great empowerment,
[2596] Thus attaining complete and perfect buddhahood.
[2597] Thus is explained the final ground.
[2598] Herein, the common vehicle summary: || 60 ||
[2599] Through the three vehicles, beings of three capacities—dull, medium, and sharp—are tamed.
[2600] This is the causal vehicle establishing the causes of buddhahood.
[2601] Thus is the common vehicle explained.
[2602] Sutras,
[2603] Vinaya,
[2604] Abhidharma,
[2605] Those three equally divided into twenty-one thousand,
[2606] The eighty-four thousand dharmaskandhas.
[2607] Those with dull faculties and those of medium effort—
[2608] Some among them obtain the result within that very life. || 70 ||
[2609] Those with sharp faculties,
[2610] And some bodhisattvas who have previously traversed the five paths, having accumulated the collections extensively as a basis, desire liberation upon one seat having completed the five paths.
[2611] Regarding this, from the hearer vehicle perspective:
[2612] Their path, through small intellect,
[2613] Medium intellect,
[2614] And great intellect, hearers of three types
[2615] Along with self-enlightened,
[2616] And buddha-enlightenment three—desire to accomplish these results,
[2617] But the Mahāyāna and mantra path they do not desire to traverse.
[2618] For hearers and self-enlightened, the eight inferior grounds from the White Completely-Seeing Ground and so forth are taught. || 80 ||
[2619] Relying upon these classifications: stream-enterer,
[2620] Once-returner,
[2621] Non-returner,
[2622] And foe-destroyer—
[2623] Each entered and
[2624] Each abiding are divided two-by-two, thus called the eight stages of great persons.
[2625] For bodhisattvas' ten grounds from Great Joy and so forth also, the four renunciation results are taught to exist correspondingly.
[2626] Regarding these, from the Self-Arisen Wisdom Tantra, Rigpa Rangshar:
[2627] <prose><tantra> "The hearer vehicle is thus explained:
[2628] <prose><tantra> The entry gate is realization of the four truths. || 90 ||
[2629] <prose><tantra> The hearers' general entry gate.
[2630] <prose><tantra> Divisions are held as two types:
[2631] <prose><tantra> Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika.
[2632] <prose><tantra> The Vaibhāṣikas' view:
[2633] <prose><tantra> Aggregates, elements, and sense-bases
[2634] <prose><tantra> Are held in the manner of yak-horn and conch—distinct and real.
[2635] <prose><tantra> When become signs of own intellect,
[2636] <prose><tantra> Dust and dust-atoms minute particles are held as ultimately real.
[2637] <prose><tantra> Thus completely analyzing all phenomena,
[2638] <prose><tantra> Emptiness is meditated through reduction to atoms. || 100 ||
[2639] <prose><tantra> The Sautrāntikas' view:
[2640] <prose><tantra> Recitation-made self-nature through study,
[2641] <prose><tantra> Hearing, contemplation, meditation three,
[2642] <prose><tantra> Through cultivating wisdom of these three,
[2643] <prose><tantra> Desire to obtain the ten grounds' supreme result.
[2644] <prose><tantra> Hearers' general type:
[2645] <prose><tantra> Meditating the four truths thoroughly,
[2646] <prose><tantra> Desire to obtain the four fruitional results.
[2647] <prose><tantra> That also, meditation-method is thus:
[2648] <prose><tantra> Desiring to meditate cessation of suffering, || 110 ||
[2649] <prose><tantra> Desiring to abandon origination of suffering.
[2650] <prose><tantra> Cessation meditation-method is thus:
[2651] <prose><tantra> Upon these external elements,
[2652] <prose><tantra> Entering into non-attached abode of peace,
[2653] <prose><tantra> First accustoming to food and sustenance.
[2654] <prose><tantra> Having become accustomed to food,
[2655] <prose><tantra> Samādhi and concentration meditate,
[2656] <prose><tantra> Samādhi non-conceptual single-pointedly meditate.
[2657] <prose><tantra> Upon the Victor Maitreya's teaching,
[2658] <prose><tantra> Desire to obtain the liberating result. || 120 ||
[2659] <prose><tantra> Origination abandonment is thus:
[2660] <prose><tantra> Free from food's concept,
[2661] <prose><tantra> Desiring to cut the continuum of origination.
[2662] <prose><tantra> That also, as anger's antidote meditate,
[2663] <prose><tantra> All afflictions completely abandon.
[2664] <prose><tantra> Ground-path meditation is thus:
[2665] <prose><tantra> As desire's antidote meditate,
[2666] <prose><tantra> As delusion's antidote meditate.
[2667] <prose><tantra> Thus the path's meditation:
[2668] <prose><tantra> Desiring to abandon suffering's root. || 130 ||
[2669] <prose><tantra> Path's meditation-method is thus:
[2670] <prose><tantra> As desire's antidote,
[2671] <prose><tantra> Upon own forehead's maṇḍala,
[2672] <prose><tantra> A white skeleton thumb-sized visualize,
[2673] <prose><tantra> Having meditated white light-rays accumulated,
[2674] <prose><tantra> From that produced, then just the head visualize,
[2675] <prose><tantra> Then just the body meditate,
[2676] <prose><tantra> Then just own surrounding visualize,
[2677] <prose><tantra> Then whatever-appears all meditate as skeleton.
[2678] <prose><tantra> Thus three-thousand white skeletons, || 140 ||
[2679] <prose><tantra> Thus white accustomed through repetition,
[2680] <prose><tantra> Desire's suffering completely abandon.
[2681] <prose><tantra> Delusion suffering abandon:
[2682] <prose><tantra> Also upon own head's crown,
[2683] <prose><tantra> Fire red, clear tone visualize."
[2684] Herein, explaining the three types of vows:
[2685] Prātimokṣa vows of individual liberation, bodhisattva vows, and mantra or tantric vows.
[2686] Thus are explained the three vows in brief.
[2687] Herein, the Prātimokṣa vows:
[2688] Eight types: bhikṣu full monk, bhikṣuṇī full nun, śikṣamāṇā probationary nun, śrāmaṇera novice monk, śrāmaṇerikā novice nun, || 150 ||
[2689] Upāsaka layman, upāsikā laywoman, and one-day upavāsa fasting vow.
[2690] Thus are explained the Prātimokṣa vows.
[2691] Herein, the bodhisattva vows:
[2692] Aspiring bodhicitta and engaging bodhicitta.
[2693] The twenty root downfalls and forty-six branch faults to be abandoned.
[2694] Restoring broken vows through the four powers: regret, reliance, remedy, and resolve.
[2695] Thus are explained the bodhisattva vows.
[2696] Herein, the mantra or tantric vows:
[2697] The fourteen root downfalls and eight thick branch faults.
[2698] Samaya commitments of body, speech, and mind. || 160 ||
[2699] Restoring through appropriate recitation and meditation practices.
[2700] Thus are explained the mantra vows.
[2701] Herein, the summary of vehicles and vows:
[2702] The three vehicles for three types of beings with different capacities,
[2703] The three vows for three types of practitioners on those paths.
[2704] Thus are explained vehicles and vows together.
[2705] Herein, the vehicle of characteristics:
[2706] Established through causes and conditions gradually cultivated,
[2707] Gradually traversed over countless aeons to reach the goal.
[2708] Thus is explained the vehicle of characteristics. || 170 ||
[2709] Herein, the vehicle of mantra:
[2710] Established through the methods of channels, winds, and drops,
[2711] Traversed swiftly through profound skillful means to enlightenment.
[2712] Thus is explained the vehicle of mantra.
[2713] Herein, the vehicle of Ati or Great Perfection:
[2714] Established through directly recognizing the nature of mind as it is,
[2715] Instantaneous liberation without need for gradual stages.
[2716] Thus is explained the vehicle of Ati.
[2717] Herein, distinguishing the vehicles:
[2718] By method, by view, by conduct, and by effect they differ. || 180 ||
[2719] Thus are explained the distinctions among vehicles.
[2720] Thus the explanation of the common vehicle is completed.
[2721] Desiring to abandon the origin of all.
[2722] The cessation cultivation method is thus:
[2723] Toward these external elements,
[2724] Entering the abode without attachment,
[2725] First becoming accustomed to food.
[2726] Realizing that phenomena, like reflections in a mirror, are without inherent essence by nature and unarisen from the beginning.
[2727] Furthermore, the two—outer grasping toward the self-existence of dharmas
[2728] And inner knowledge grasping the antidote—are both superimpositions of true existence. || 190 ||
[2729] The self of the person is the knowledge of abandonment regarding the dharmas comprising the five aggregates, grasping at I and mine.
[2730] These are called the self of the person and the self of dharmas.
[2731] Though ārya hearers realize the selflessness of the person, they do not realize the selflessness of dharmas.
[2732] Self-enlightened ones realize above that the outer grasping of dharmas is non-existent, yet do not realize the non-existence of the inner grasping antidote.
[2733] From the Ornament of Clear Realization, Abhisamayālaṅkāra:
[2734] <prose><tantra> "In order to abandon thought of the grasped object,
[2735] <prose><tantra> "And in order not to abandon grasping itself,
[2736] <prose><tantra> "The rhinoceros-like path of support
[2737] <prose><tantra> "Should be known through correct summary."
[2738] Thus it is taught. || 200 ||
[2739] The time required is through accumulating the collections comprising the path of accumulation for a hundred great kalpas.
[2740] <prose><tantra> "The rhinoceros through the cause of a hundred kalpas"
[2741] Is thus taught in scripture.
[2742] The crow-like self-enlightened:
[2743] Meditates on dependent origination in reverse order.
[2744] Going to the charnel ground, contemplating from "From what does this corpse arise?"
[2745] "It arises from death," thus from ignorance as the root,
[2746] Based on realizing half and two aspects of selflessness,
[2747] Through meditating on the five paths, they manifest the enlightenment of knowing weariness with saṃsāra and non-arising of phenomena.
[2748] Both types of self-enlightened teach Dharma through bodily signs, not through speech. || 210 ||
[2749] These methods are also from the Self-Arisen Wisdom Tantra, Rigpa Rangshar:
[2750] <prose><tantra> "A-ho, Secret Lord, listen well!
[2751] <prose><tantra> "The sūtra vehicle of the self-enlightened ones:
[2752] <prose><tantra> "The door of entry is the twelve links of dependent origination.
[2753] <prose><tantra> "The realized view is the selflessness of the person,
[2754] <prose><tantra> "Holding half the power of the view of dharmas' selflessness.
[2755] <prose><tantra> "Keeping the two hundred fifty disciplines of protection,
[2756] <prose><tantra> "Meditating on the stage of non-thought, the nature of dharmas,
[2757] <prose><tantra> "Outer and inner dependent origination,
[2758] <prose><tantra> "Becoming strength through habituation, || 220 ||
[2759] <prose><tantra> "Holding the measure of perfected fruit.
[2760] <prose><tantra> "These also are indicated by examples thus:
[2761] <prose><tantra> "For example, like a corpse in the charnel ground,
[2762] <prose><tantra> "Having gone to the charnel ground,
[2763] <prose><tantra> "This corpse, from what did it first arise?
[2764] <prose><tantra> "Now, what is the entity of this corpse?
[2765] <prose><tantra> "Thus indicating by example.
[2766] <prose><tantra> "This also arises from ignorance as root.
[2767] <prose><tantra> "From ignorance, formative forces arise.
[2768] <prose><tantra> "Formative forces produce consciousness. || 230 ||
[2769] <prose><tantra> "From consciousness, name and form arise.
[2770] <prose><tantra> "From name and form, the nature of the six sense-bases arises.
[2771] <prose><tantra> "From the six sense-bases, contact arises.
[2772] <prose><tantra> "From contact, feeling arises.
[2773] <prose><tantra> "From feeling, craving arises.
[2774] <prose><tantra> "From craving, grasping arises.
[2775] <prose><tantra> "From grasping, existence arises.
[2776] <prose><tantra> "From existence, birth arises.
[2777] <prose><tantra> "From birth, aging arises.
[2778] <prose><tantra> "From aging, sickness arises. || 240 ||
[2779] <prose><tantra> "From sickness, death arises.
[2780] <prose><tantra> "Thus meditate on the twelve links of dependent origination.
[2781] <prose><tantra> "Through meditating thus with excellence,
[2782] <prose><tantra> "Obtain the fruit of the twelve grounds.
[2783] <prose><tantra> "Meditate on the eight types of unpleasantness.
[2784] <prose><tantra> "Having gone in the direction of the charnel ground,
[2785] <prose><tantra> "Thus contemplate upon one's own body as impermanent."
[2786] Definitive meaning: desiring oneself alone to become Buddha.
[2787] Herein, explaining the outer pith instructions of the Great Perfection is done:
[2788] The outer concentration: the four visions of the lamp. || 250 ||
[2789] Outer emptiness: dissolving phenomena into the expanse.
[2790] Thus are explained the outer pith instructions.
[2791] Herein, the inner pith instructions are explained:
[2792] The inner concentration: the four visions of the lamp.
[2793] Inner emptiness: dissolving into the bindu.
[2794] Thus are explained the inner pith instructions.
[2795] Herein, the secret pith instructions are explained:
[2796] The secret concentration: the four lamps of the channels.
[2797] Secret emptiness: dissolving into the channels.
[2798] Thus are explained the secret pith instructions. || 260 ||
[2799] Herein, the unsurpassable pith instructions are explained:
[2800] The unsurpassable concentration: the four lamps.
[2801] Unsurpassable emptiness: dissolving into the clear light.
[2802] Thus are explained the unsurpassable pith instructions.
[2803] Herein, the four lamps are explained:
[2804] The lamp of the abiding nature, the lamp of the channels,
[2805] The lamp of the far-reaching water lasso, the lamp of the empty bindu.
[2806] Thus are explained the four lamps.
[2807] Herein, the four visions are explained:
[2808] Dharmatā vision, increase vision, full attainment vision, and exhaustion vision. || 270 ||
[2809] Thus are explained the four visions.
[2810] Herein, dharmatā vision is explained:
[2811] Recognizing the nature of mind as the deity.
[2812] Thus is explained dharmatā vision.
[2813] Herein, increase vision is explained:
[2814] The increase of experiences and realizations.
[2815] Thus is explained increase vision.
[2816] Herein, full attainment vision is explained:
[2817] The full attainment of the stages of the path.
[2818] Thus is explained full attainment vision. || 280 ||
[2819] Herein, exhaustion vision is explained:
[2820] The exhaustion of all phenomena into the nature.
[2821] Thus is explained exhaustion vision.
[2822] Herein, the manner of liberation is explained:
[2823] Through recognition, liberation is instantaneous.
[2824] Through practice, qualities arise.
[2825] Through perfection, buddhahood is attained.
[2826] Thus is explained the manner of liberation.
[2827] Thus the uncommon vehicle of the Great Perfection is explained.
[2828] Viewing the dominion of dharmas as possessed. || 290 ||
[2829] Protecting two hundred fifty protecting samayas.
[2830] Meditation method: meditating on non-conceptual dharmatā.
[2831] Here follows the general path briefly stated.
[2832] The explanation of the various established tenet positions divides into two parts.
