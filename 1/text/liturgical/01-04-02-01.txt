[2539] Selflessness of persons is established through outer grasping.
[2540] Selflessness of dharmas is established through lack of true existence.
[2541] Thus explaining the Sautrāntika view.
[2542] Herein, how to explain the path cultivation?
[2543] The antidote for the three poisons is emptiness.
[2544] Individual antidotes: meditation on impurity for desire,
[2545] Meditation on love for anger, and dependent arising for delusion.
[2546] The faculties are dull, medium, and sharp.
[2547] Effort is made according to faculties.
[2548] Bodhisattvas' path is the five previously gone.
[2549] Thus explaining path cultivation in brief.
[2550] Herein, how to explain the effects?
[2551] Hearer effects: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and foe-destroyer.
[2552] Self-enlightened: solitary rhinoceros-like.
[2553] Bodhisattvas: the ten grounds of great joy.
[2554] Thus explaining the effects.
[2555] Herein, how to explain the self-enlightened vehicle?
[2556] They realize dependent arising through their own power,
[2557] Without relying upon a teacher in their final life.
[2558] Like a rhinoceros, they wander alone.
[2559] Thus explaining the self-enlightened vehicle.
[2560] Herein, how to explain the bodhisattva vehicle?
[2561] Generated bodhicitta, engaged in the six perfections,
[2562] Perfecting the two accumulations, attaining enlightenment for others' benefit.
[2563] Thus explaining the bodhisattva vehicle in brief.
[2564] 
[2565] 
[2566] 



[2567] Herein, explaining in detail,
[2568] First, the essence of the bodhisattva vehicle:
[2569] Generation of bodhicitta and engagement in the six perfections.
[2570] Definition: vehicle entered through the power of compassion.
[2571] Purpose: establishing all beings in buddhahood.
[2572] Effect: attaining the ten grounds and five paths.
[2573] Division: two—the Prajñāpāramitā system and the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2574] Thus explaining the bodhisattva vehicle.
[2575] Herein, the Prajñāpāramitā system:
[2576] Realizing the three circles as empty,
[2577] Perfecting the six perfections,
[2578] Attaining buddhahood through the five paths and ten grounds.
[2579] Thus explaining the Prajñāpāramitā system.
[2580] Herein, the Tathāgatagarbha system:
[2581] Recognizing the Buddha-nature endowed with virtues as existent,
[2582] Purifying adventitious defilements,
[2583] Revealing the essence spontaneously present.
[2584] Thus explaining the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2585] Herein, the grounds and paths:
[2586] The five paths: accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, and no-more-learning.
[2587] The ten grounds: joyous, stainless, luminous, radiant, difficult-to-conquer, manifest, gone-afar, immovable, good-intelligence, and cloud-of-dharma.
[2588] Thus explaining grounds and paths.
[2589] Herein, the two accumulations:
[2590] Merit accumulated through the first five perfections,
[2591] Wisdom accumulated through the perfection of discernment.
[2592] Thus explaining the two accumulations.
[2593] Herein, the final ground:
[2594] The tenth ground, cloud-of-dharma,
[2595] Surrounded by Buddhas, receiving empowerment,
[2596] Attaining complete buddhahood.
[2597] Thus explaining the final ground.
[2598] Herein, the common vehicle summary:
[2599] Through the three vehicles, beings of three capacities are tamed.
[2600] The cause vehicle establishing the cause of buddhahood.
[2601] Thus the common vehicle is explained.
[2602] 
[2603] 
[2604] 
[2605] 
[2606] 



[2607] Those with dull faculties and those of medium effort—
[2608] Some obtain the result within that very life.
[2609] The sharp,
[2610] And some bodhisattvas who have previously traversed the five paths, having accumulated collections extensively as a basis, desire liberation upon one seat having completed the five paths.
[2611] That also, from the hearer vehicle:
[2612] Their path, through small intellect,
[2613] Medium,
[2614] And great, hearers,
[2615] Self-enlightened,
[2616] And buddha-enlightenment three desire to accomplish—
[2617] The Mahāyāna and mantra path they do not desire.
[2618] That too, for hearers and self-enlightened, the eight inferior grounds from the White Completely-Seeing Ground and so forth are taught.
[2619] Relying upon that: stream-enterer,
[2620] Once-returner,
[2621] Non-returner,
[2622] And foe-destroyer—
[2623] Each entered and
[2624] Abiding divided two-by-two are called the eight stages of great persons.
[2625] For bodhisattvas' ten grounds from Great Joy and so forth also, the four renunciation results are taught to exist.
[2626] Those also, from Rigpa Rangshar:
[2627] The hearer vehicle is thus:
[2628] The entry gate is the four truths.
[2629] The hearers' general entry gate.
[2630] Divisions are held as two types:
[2631] Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika.
[2632] The Vaibhāṣikas' view:
[2633] Aggregates, elements, and sense-bases
[2634] Are held in the manner of yak-horn and conch.
[2635] When become signs of own intellect,
[2636] Dust and dust-atoms are held.
[2637] Thus completely analyzing,
[2638] Emptiness is meditated.
[2639] The Sautrāntikas' view:
[2640] Recitation-made self-nature,
[2641] Hearing, contemplation, meditation three,
[2642] Through cultivating wisdom three,
[2643] Desire to obtain the ten grounds' result.
[2644] Hearers' general type:
[2645] Meditating the four truths,
[2646] Desire the four results.
[2647] That also, meditation-method is thus:
[2648] Desiring to meditate cessation,
[2649] Desiring to abandon origination.
[2650] Cessation meditation-method is thus:
[2651] Upon these external elements,
[2652] Entering into non-attached abode,
[2653] First accustoming to food.
[2654] Having become accustomed to food,
[2655] Samādhi and concentration meditate,
[2656] Samādhi non-conceptual single-pointedly meditate.
[2657] Upon the Victor Maitreya's teaching,
[2658] Desire to obtain the result.
[2659] Origination abandonment is thus:
[2660] Free from food's concept,
[2661] Desiring to cut the continuum of origination.
[2662] That also, as anger's antidote meditate,
[2663] All afflictions abandon.
[2664] Ground-path meditation is thus:
[2665] As desire's antidote meditate,
[2666] As delusion's antidote meditate.
[2667] Thus the path's meditation:
[2668] Desiring to abandon suffering.
[2669] Path's meditation-method is thus:
[2670] As desire's antidote,
[2671] Upon own forehead's maṇḍala,
[2672] A white skeleton thumb-sized,
[2673] Having meditated white light-rays accumulated,
[2674] From that produced, then just the head,
[2675] Then just the body meditate,
[2676] Then just own surrounding,
[2677] Then whatever-appears all meditate.
[2678] Thus three-thousand white,
[2679] Thus white accustomed,
[2680] Desire's suffering abandon.
[2681] Delusion suffering abandon:
[2682] Also upon own head's crown,
[2683] Fire red, clear tone.



[2684] Herein, explaining the three vows:
[2685] Prātimokṣa, bodhisattva, and mantra vows.
[2686] Thus explaining the three vows in brief.
[2687] Herein, Prātimokṣa vows:
[2688] Eight types: bhikṣu, bhikṣuṇī, śikṣamāṇā, śrāmaṇera, śrāmaṇerikā,
[2689] Upāsaka, upāsikā, and one-day upavāsa.
[2690] Thus explaining Prātimokṣa.
[2691] Herein, bodhisattva vows:
[2692] Aspiring and engaging bodhicitta.
[2693] The twenty root downfalls and forty-six branch faults to be abandoned.
[2694] Restoring through the four powers.
[2695] Thus explaining bodhisattva vows.
[2696] Herein, mantra vows:
[2697] The fourteen root downfalls and eight thick branches.
[2698] Samaya of body, speech, and mind.
[2699] Restoring through recitation and meditation.
[2700] Thus explaining mantra vows.
[2701] Herein, the summary of vehicles and vows:
[2702] The three vehicles for three types of beings,
[2703] The three vows for three types of practitioners.
[2704] Thus explaining vehicles and vows.
[2705] Herein, the vehicle of characteristics:
[2706] Established through causes and conditions,
[2707] Gradually traversed over countless aeons.
[2708] Thus explaining the vehicle of characteristics.
[2709] Herein, the vehicle of mantra:
[2710] Established through the methods of channels, winds, and drops,
[2711] Traversed swiftly through profound skillful means.
[2712] Thus explaining the vehicle of mantra.
[2713] Herein, the vehicle of Ati:
[2714] Established through directly recognizing the nature,
[2715] Instantaneous liberation without gradual stages.
[2716] Thus explaining the vehicle of Ati.
[2717] Herein, distinguishing the vehicles:
[2718] By method, by view, by conduct, by effect.
[2719] Thus explaining the distinctions.
[2720] Thus the explanation of the common vehicle is completed.
[2721] 
[2722] 
[2723] 
[2724] 
[2725] 



[2726] Realizing that like reflections, they are without essence by nature and unarisen.
[2727] Furthermore, the two—outer grasping toward the self of dharmas
[2728] And inner knowledge grasping the antidote—are superimpositions of truth.
[2729] The self of the person is the knowledge of abandonment on the dharmas comprising the five aggregates, grasping at I and mine.
[2730] These are called the self of the person and the self of dharmas.
[2731] Though ārya hearers realize the selflessness of the person, they do not realize the selflessness of dharmas.
[2732] Self-enlightened ones realize above that the outer grasping of dharmas is non-existent, yet do not realize the non-existence of grasping.
[2733] From the Abhisamayālaṅkāra:
[2734] "In order to abandon thought of the grasped object,
[2735] "And in order not to abandon grasping,
[2736] "The rhinoceros-like path of support
[2737] "Should be known through correct summary."
[2738] Thus.
[2739] The time is through accumulating the collections comprising the path of accumulation for a hundred great kalpas.
[2740] "The rhinoceros through the cause of a hundred kalpas"
[2741] Is thus taught.
[2742] The crow-like:
[2743] Meditates on dependent origination in reverse order.
[2744] Going to the charnel ground, contemplating from "From what does this corpse arise?"
[2745] "It arises from death," thus from ignorance,
[2746] Based on realizing half and two of selflessness,
[2747] Through meditating on the five paths, they manifest the enlightenment of knowing weariness and non-arising.
[2748] Both of these teach Dharma through bodily signs, not through speech.
[2749] These methods are also from Rigpa Rangshar:
[2750] "A-ho, Secret Lord, listen!
[2751] "The sūtra vehicle of the self-enlightened:
[2752] "The door of entry is the twelve links of dependent origination.
[2753] "The realized view is the selflessness of the person,
[2754] "Holding half the power of the view of dharmas.
[2755] "Keeping the two hundred fifty disciplines of protection,
[2756] "Meditating on the stage of non-thought, the nature of dharmas,
[2757] "Outer and inner dependent origination,
[2758] "Becoming strength through habituation,
[2759] "Holding the measure of perfected fruit.
[2760] "These also are indicated by examples thus:
[2761] "For example, like a corpse in the charnel ground,
[2762] "Having gone to the charnel ground,
[2763] "This corpse, from what did it first arise?
[2764] "Now, what is the entity of this?
[2765] "Thus indicating by example.
[2766] "This also arises from ignorance.
[2767] "From ignorance, formative forces.
[2768] "Formative forces, consciousness.
[2769] "From consciousness, name arises.
[2770] "From name, the nature of form arises.
[2771] "From form, the six sense-bases arise.
[2772] "From the six sense-bases, contact arises.
[2773] "From contact, feeling arises.
[2774] "From feeling, craving arises.
[2775] "From craving, grasping arises.
[2776] "From grasping, existence arises.
[2777] "From existence, birth arises.
[2778] "From birth, aging arises.
[2779] "From aging, sickness arises.
[2780] "From sickness, death arises.
[2781] "Thus meditate on the twelve links of dependent origination.
[2782] "Through meditating thus with excellence,
[2783] "Obtain the fruit of the twelve grounds.
[2784] "Meditate on the eight types of unpleasantness.
[2785] "Having gone in the direction of the charnel ground,
[2786] "Thus contemplate upon one's own body.



[2787] Herein, explaining the outer pith instructions:
[2788] The outer concentration: the four visions of the lamp.
[2789] Outer emptiness: dissolving into the expanse.
[2790] Thus explaining the outer pith instructions.
[2791] Herein, the inner pith instructions:
[2792] The inner concentration: the four visions of the lamp.
[2793] Inner emptiness: dissolving into the bindu.
[2794] Thus explaining the inner pith instructions.
[2795] Herein, the secret pith instructions:
[2796] The secret concentration: the four lamps of the channels.
[2797] Secret emptiness: dissolving into the channels.
[2798] Thus explaining the secret pith instructions.
[2799] Herein, the unsurpassable pith instructions:
[2800] The unsurpassable concentration: the four lamps.
[2801] Unsurpassable emptiness: dissolving into the clear light.
[2802] Thus explaining the unsurpassable pith instructions.
[2803] Herein, the four lamps:
[2804] The lamp of the abiding nature, the lamp of the channels,
[2805] The lamp of the far-reaching water lasso, the lamp of the empty bindu.
[2806] Thus explaining the four lamps.
[2807] Herein, the four visions:
[2808] Dharmatā, increase, full attainment, and exhaustion.
[2809] Thus explaining the four visions.
[2810] Herein, dharmatā vision:
[2811] Recognizing the nature of mind as the deity.
[2812] Thus explaining dharmatā vision.
[2813] Herein, increase vision:
[2814] The increase of experiences and realizations.
[2815] Thus explaining increase vision.
[2816] Herein, full attainment vision:
[2817] The full attainment of the path.
[2818] Thus explaining full attainment vision.
[2819] Herein, exhaustion vision:
[2820] The exhaustion of phenomena into the nature.
[2821] Thus explaining exhaustion vision.
[2822] Herein, the manner of liberation:
[2823] Through recognition, liberation is instantaneous.
[2824] Through practice, qualities arise.
[2825] Through perfection, buddhahood is attained.
[2826] Thus explaining the manner of liberation.
[2827] Thus the uncommon vehicle is explained.
[2828] 
[2829] 
[2830] 



[2831] Here follows the general path briefly stated.
[2832] The explanation of the various established tenet positions divides into two parts.
