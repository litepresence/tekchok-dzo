[2539] Selflessness of persons is established through outer grasping being non-existent.
[2540] Selflessness of dharmas is established through lack of true existence in phenomena.
[2541] Thus is explained the complete Sautrāntika view.
[2542] Herein, how should one explain the cultivation of the path?
[2543] The antidote for the three poisons of desire, anger, and delusion is the realization of emptiness.
[2544] Individual antidotes are applied: meditation on impurity as antidote for desire,
[2545] Meditation on love as antidote for anger, and meditation on dependent arising as antidote for delusion.
[2546] The faculties of practitioners are classified as dull, medium, and sharp.
[2547] Effort is made according to the capacity of these faculties.
[2548] The bodhisattvas' path is that of the five previously described transcendent perfections.
[2549] Thus is explained the cultivation of the path in brief.
[2550] Herein, how should one explain the effects or results?
[2551] For hearers, the four effects: stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner, and foe-destroyer.
[2552] For the self-enlightened: solitary rhinoceros-like pratyekabuddhas.
[2553] For bodhisattvas: the ten grounds beginning with great joy.
[2554] Thus are explained the various effects.
[2555] Herein, how should one explain the self-enlightened vehicle?
[2556] They realize dependent arising through their own power of wisdom,
[2557] Without relying upon a teacher in their final life.
[2558] Like a rhinoceros wandering alone, they practice in solitude.
[2559] Thus is explained the self-enlightened vehicle.
[2560] Herein, how should one explain the bodhisattva vehicle?
[2561] Through generation of bodhicitta and engagement in the six perfections,
[2562] Perfecting the two accumulations, they attain enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings.
[2563] Thus is explained the bodhisattva vehicle in brief.

[2567] Herein, explaining in detail the Great Vehicle:
[2568] First, the essence of the bodhisattva vehicle:
[2569] The generation of bodhicitta and engagement in the six transcendent perfections.
[2570] Definition: That vehicle which is entered through the power of compassion.
[2571] Purpose: Establishing all sentient beings in the state of buddhahood.
[2572] Effect: Attaining the ten grounds and traversing the five paths.
[2573] Division: Two systems—the Prajñāpāramitā system and the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2574] Thus is explained the bodhisattva vehicle in detail.
[2575] Herein, the Prajñāpāramitā system:
[2576] Realizing the three circles—subject, object, and action—as empty of inherent existence,
[2577] Perfecting the six transcendent perfections,
[2578] Attaining buddhahood through traversing the five paths and ten grounds.
[2579] Thus is explained the Prajñāpāramitā system.
[2580] Herein, the Tathāgatagarbha system:
[2581] Recognizing the Buddha-nature endowed with all virtues as existent from the beginning,
[2582] Purifying adventitious defilements that obscure it,
[2583] Revealing the essence spontaneously present as the result.
[2584] Thus is explained the Tathāgatagarbha system.
[2585] Herein, the grounds and paths:
[2586] The five paths: accumulation, preparation, seeing, meditation, and no-more-learning.
[2587] The ten grounds: joyous, stainless, luminous, radiant, difficult-to-conquer, manifest, gone-afar, immovable, good-intelligence, and cloud-of-dharma.
[2588] Thus are explained the grounds and paths.
[2589] Herein, the two accumulations:
[2590] Merit accumulated through the first five perfections of generosity, morality, patience, effort, and concentration,
[2591] Wisdom accumulated through the perfection of discernment or prajñā.
[2592] Thus are explained the two accumulations.
[2593] Herein, the final ground:
[2594] The tenth ground, called cloud-of-dharma,
[2595] Where the bodhisattva is surrounded by Buddhas and receives the great empowerment,
[2596] Thus attaining complete and perfect buddhahood.
[2597] Thus is explained the final ground.
[2598] Herein, the common vehicle summary:
[2599] Through the three vehicles, beings of three capacities—dull, medium, and sharp—are tamed.
[2600] This is the causal vehicle establishing the causes of buddhahood.
[2601] Thus is the common vehicle explained.

[2607] Those with dull faculties and those of medium effort—
[2608] Some among them obtain the result within that very life.
[2609] Those with sharp faculties,
[2610] And some bodhisattvas who have previously traversed the five paths, having accumulated the collections extensively as a basis, desire liberation upon one seat having completed the five paths.
[2611] Regarding this, from the hearer vehicle perspective:
[2612] Their path, through small intellect,
[2613] Medium intellect,
[2614] And great intellect, hearers of three types
[2615] Along with self-enlightened,
[2616] And buddha-enlightenment three—desire to accomplish these results,
[2617] But the Mahāyāna and mantra path they do not desire to traverse.
[2618] For hearers and self-enlightened, the eight inferior grounds from the White Completely-Seeing Ground and so forth are taught.
[2619] Relying upon these classifications: stream-enterer,
[2620] Once-returner,
[2621] Non-returner,
[2622] And foe-destroyer—
[2623] Each entered and
[2624] Each abiding are divided two-by-two, thus called the eight stages of great persons.
[2625] For bodhisattvas' ten grounds from Great Joy and so forth also, the four renunciation results are taught to exist correspondingly.
[2626] Regarding these, from the Self-Arisen Wisdom Tantra, Rigpa Rangshar:
<tantra> [2627] "The hearer vehicle is thus explained:
<tantra> [2628] The entry gate is realization of the four truths.
<tantra> [2629] The hearers' general entry gate.
<tantra> [2630] Divisions are held as two types:
<tantra> [2631] Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika.
<tantra> [2632] The Vaibhāṣikas' view:
<tantra> [2633] Aggregates, elements, and sense-bases
<tantra> [2634] Are held in the manner of yak-horn and conch—distinct and real.
<tantra> [2635] When become signs of own intellect,
<tantra> [2636] Dust and dust-atoms minute particles are held as ultimately real.
<tantra> [2637] Thus completely analyzing all phenomena,
<tantra> [2638] Emptiness is meditated through reduction to atoms.
<tantra> [2639] The Sautrāntikas' view:
<tantra> [2640] Recitation-made self-nature through study,
<tantra> [2641] Hearing, contemplation, meditation three,
<tantra> [2642] Through cultivating wisdom of these three,
<tantra> [2643] Desire to obtain the ten grounds' supreme result.
<tantra> [2644] Hearers' general type:
<tantra> [2645] Meditating the four truths thoroughly,
<tantra> [2646] Desire to obtain the four fruitional results.
<tantra> [2647] That also, meditation-method is thus:
<tantra> [2648] Desiring to meditate cessation of suffering,
<tantra> [2649] Desiring to abandon origination of suffering.
<tantra> [2650] Cessation meditation-method is thus:
<tantra> [2651] Upon these external elements,
<tantra> [2652] Entering into non-attached abode of peace,
<tantra> [2653] First accustoming to food and sustenance.
<tantra> [2654] Having become accustomed to food,
<tantra> [2655] Samādhi and concentration meditate,
<tantra> [2656] Samādhi non-conceptual single-pointedly meditate.
<tantra> [2657] Upon the Victor Maitreya's teaching,
<tantra> [2658] Desire to obtain the liberating result.
<tantra> [2659] Origination abandonment is thus:
<tantra> [2660] Free from food's concept,
<tantra> [2661] Desiring to cut the continuum of origination.
<tantra> [2662] That also, as anger's antidote meditate,
<tantra> [2663] All afflictions completely abandon.
<tantra> [2664] Ground-path meditation is thus:
<tantra> [2665] As desire's antidote meditate,
<tantra> [2666] As delusion's antidote meditate.
<tantra> [2667] Thus the path's meditation:
<tantra> [2668] Desiring to abandon suffering's root.
<tantra> [2669] Path's meditation-method is thus:
<tantra> [2670] As desire's antidote,
<tantra> [2671] Upon own forehead's maṇḍala,
<tantra> [2672] A white skeleton thumb-sized visualize,
<tantra> [2673] Having meditated white light-rays accumulated,
<tantra> [2674] From that produced, then just the head visualize,
<tantra> [2675] Then just the body meditate,
<tantra> [2676] Then just own surrounding visualize,
<tantra> [2677] Then whatever-appears all meditate as skeleton.
<tantra> [2678] Thus three-thousand white skeletons,
<tantra> [2679] Thus white accustomed through repetition,
<tantra> [2680] Desire's suffering completely abandon.
<tantra> [2681] Delusion suffering abandon:
<tantra> [2682] Also upon own head's crown,
<tantra> [2683] Fire red, clear tone visualize."

[2684] Herein, explaining the three types of vows:
[2685] Prātimokṣa vows of individual liberation, bodhisattva vows, and mantra or tantric vows.
[2686] Thus are explained the three vows in brief.
[2687] Herein, the Prātimokṣa vows:
[2688] Eight types: bhikṣu full monk, bhikṣuṇī full nun, śikṣamāṇā probationary nun, śrāmaṇera novice monk, śrāmaṇerikā novice nun,
[2689] Upāsaka layman, upāsikā laywoman, and one-day upavāsa fasting vow.
[2690] Thus are explained the Prātimokṣa vows.
[2691] Herein, the bodhisattva vows:
[2692] Aspiring bodhicitta and engaging bodhicitta.
[2693] The twenty root downfalls and forty-six branch faults to be abandoned.
[2694] Restoring broken vows through the four powers: regret, reliance, remedy, and resolve.
[2695] Thus are explained the bodhisattva vows.
[2696] Herein, the mantra or tantric vows:
[2697] The fourteen root downfalls and eight thick branch faults.
[2698] Samaya commitments of body, speech, and mind.
[2699] Restoring through appropriate recitation and meditation practices.
[2700] Thus are explained the mantra vows.
[2701] Herein, the summary of vehicles and vows:
[2702] The three vehicles for three types of beings with different capacities,
[2703] The three vows for three types of practitioners on those paths.
[2704] Thus are explained vehicles and vows together.
[2705] Herein, the vehicle of characteristics:
[2706] Established through causes and conditions gradually cultivated,
[2707] Gradually traversed over countless aeons to reach the goal.
[2708] Thus is explained the vehicle of characteristics.
[2709] Herein, the vehicle of mantra:
[2710] Established through the methods of channels, winds, and drops,
[2711] Traversed swiftly through profound skillful means to enlightenment.
[2712] Thus is explained the vehicle of mantra.
[2713] Herein, the vehicle of Ati or Great Perfection:
[2714] Established through directly recognizing the nature of mind as it is,
[2715] Instantaneous liberation without need for gradual stages.
[2716] Thus is explained the vehicle of Ati.
[2717] Herein, distinguishing the vehicles:
[2718] By method, by view, by conduct, and by effect they differ.
[2719] Thus are explained the distinctions among vehicles.
[2720] Thus the explanation of the common vehicle is completed.

[2726] Realizing that phenomena, like reflections in a mirror, are without inherent essence by nature and unarisen from the beginning.
[2727] Furthermore, the two—outer grasping toward the self-existence of dharmas
[2728] And inner knowledge grasping the antidote—are both superimpositions of true existence.
[2729] The self of the person is the knowledge of abandonment regarding the dharmas comprising the five aggregates, grasping at I and mine.
[2730] These are called the self of the person and the self of dharmas.
[2731] Though ārya hearers realize the selflessness of the person, they do not realize the selflessness of dharmas.
[2732] Self-enlightened ones realize above that the outer grasping of dharmas is non-existent, yet do not realize the non-existence of the inner grasping antidote.
[2733] From the Ornament of Clear Realization, Abhisamayālaṅkāra:
<tantra> [2734] "In order to abandon thought of the grasped object,
<tantra> [2735] "And in order not to abandon grasping itself,
<tantra> [2736] "The rhinoceros-like path of support
<tantra> [2737] "Should be known through correct summary."
[2738] Thus it is taught.
[2739] The time required is through accumulating the collections comprising the path of accumulation for a hundred great kalpas.
<tantra> [2740] "The rhinoceros through the cause of a hundred kalpas"
[2741] Is thus taught in scripture.
[2742] The crow-like self-enlightened:
[2743] Meditates on dependent origination in reverse order.
[2744] Going to the charnel ground, contemplating from "From what does this corpse arise?"
[2745] "It arises from death," thus from ignorance as the root,
[2746] Based on realizing half and two aspects of selflessness,
[2747] Through meditating on the five paths, they manifest the enlightenment of knowing weariness with saṃsāra and non-arising of phenomena.
[2748] Both types of self-enlightened teach Dharma through bodily signs, not through speech.
[2749] These methods are also from the Self-Arisen Wisdom Tantra, Rigpa Rangshar:
<tantra> [2750] "A-ho, Secret Lord, listen well!
<tantra> [2751] "The sūtra vehicle of the self-enlightened ones:
<tantra> [2752] "The door of entry is the twelve links of dependent origination.
<tantra> [2753] "The realized view is the selflessness of the person,
<tantra> [2754] "Holding half the power of the view of dharmas' selflessness.
<tantra> [2755] "Keeping the two hundred fifty disciplines of protection,
<tantra> [2756] "Meditating on the stage of non-thought, the nature of dharmas,
<tantra> [2757] "Outer and inner dependent origination,
<tantra> [2758] "Becoming strength through habituation,
<tantra> [2759] "Holding the measure of perfected fruit.
<tantra> [2760] "These also are indicated by examples thus:
<tantra> [2761] "For example, like a corpse in the charnel ground,
<tantra> [2762] "Having gone to the charnel ground,
<tantra> [2763] "This corpse, from what did it first arise?
<tantra> [2764] "Now, what is the entity of this corpse?
<tantra> [2765] "Thus indicating by example.
<tantra> [2766] "This also arises from ignorance as root.
<tantra> [2767] "From ignorance, formative forces arise.
<tantra> [2768] "Formative forces produce consciousness.
<tantra> [2769] "From consciousness, name and form arise.
<tantra> [2770] "From name and form, the nature of the six sense-bases arises.
<tantra> [2771] "From the six sense-bases, contact arises.
<tantra> [2772] "From contact, feeling arises.
<tantra> [2773] "From feeling, craving arises.
<tantra> [2774] "From craving, grasping arises.
<tantra> [2775] "From grasping, existence arises.
<tantra> [2776] "From existence, birth arises.
<tantra> [2777] "From birth, aging arises.
<tantra> [2778] "From aging, sickness arises.
<tantra> [2779] "From sickness, death arises.
<tantra> [2780] "Thus meditate on the twelve links of dependent origination.
<tantra> [2781] "Through meditating thus with excellence,
<tantra> [2782] "Obtain the fruit of the twelve grounds.
<tantra> [2783] "Meditate on the eight types of unpleasantness.
<tantra> [2784] "Having gone in the direction of the charnel ground,
<tantra> [2785] "Thus contemplate upon one's own body as impermanent."
