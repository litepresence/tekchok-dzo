[3062] Since there is no beginning, meaning stops like unestablished cause.
[3063] From the intermediate mother.
[3064] In ultimate truth, samsara does not exist.
[3065] Nirvāṇa does not exist.
[3066] Emptiness does not exist.
[3067] It is merely designated by words—it is said.
[3068] In this, conventional truth is completely non-abiding.
[3069] Cause is non-abiding.
[3070] Distinction is non-abiding.
[3071] The distinguisher is non-abiding.
[3072] One is non-abiding.
[3073] Many is non-abiding.
[3074] Beyond one and many is non-abiding.
[3075] Mere appearance is completely non-abiding—various divisions beyond measure.
[3076] This is called the autonomous middle-way higher.
[3077] The consequentialist middle-way.
[3078] Thus, in ultimate truth, nothing is established.
[3079] All is negated: conventional appearance as merely illusion established, and so forth.
[3080] Asserting beyond nature from the extremes of existence and non-existence, free from all claims.
[3081] As the Noble King of Samadhi states:
[3082] Permanent and impermanent—this is also an extreme.
[3083] Existence and non-existence—both are extremes.
[3084] Therefore, both extremes are completely abandoned.
[3085] The wise one does not even abide in the middle.
[3086] Thus.



[3087] From the Ratnakuta Sutra:
[3088] The Tathagatas are permanent dharmas without birth.
[3089] All dharmas are like the Sugatas.
[3090] Since childish intellect grasps at signs,
[3091] One engages in the dharma that does not exist within the world.
[3092] Thus.
[3093] From the Root Wisdom:
[3094] Whatever depends and connects,
[3095] Through non-cessation, there is no birth.
[3096] Through non-annihilation, there is no permanence.
[3097] Through non-coming, there is no going.
[3098] Not different meaning, not single meaning.
[3099] Showing the cessation of elaboration, peace.
[3100] The perfect Buddhas speak.
[3101] Homage to that supreme one.
[3102] Thus.
[3103] From the Refutation of Refutations:
[3104] If I were to assert something exists,
[3105] Then I would have this fault.
[3106] Since I assert nothing,
[3107] I am only without faults.
[3108] Thus.
[3109] Since there is nothing to refute,
[3110] I refute nothing.
[3111] Therefore, it is said that one refutes.
[3112] You have imposed that imputation.
[3113] Thus.
[3114] And this also, since no view is established by intellect, one wishes for the cessation of elaboration.
[3115] Although placed as various mere appearances in the branch of conventional symbol-knowledge as worldly convention,
[3116] This also is not asserted.
[3117] One wishes to be free from the extremes of existence and non-existence and from the present time, beyond true and false appearance of dharma.
[3118] This is the summit of the established views of the Buddhas who assert suchness.
[3119] This great treatise is the six collections of middle-way reasoning.
[3120] The Root Wisdom.
[3121] The Sixty.
[3122] The Seventy on Emptiness.
[3123] The Fine Analysis.
[3124] The Refutation.
[3125] The Conventional Establishment.
[3126] Also this, from the speech of the noble Nagarjuna:
[3127] Composed the collection of words on the explanation of the first teaching, the dharma-wheel of the four truths.
[3128] Composed the collection of reasoning on the explanation of the dharma-wheel of the middle, characteristic-less dharmas.
[3129] Composed the collection of praise on the explanation of the dharma-wheel of the ultimate, distinguished dharmas.
[3130] Therefore, this master turns the dharma-wheel with the second Buddha.



[3131] These treatises are without distinction of teaching and difference.
[3132] The four divisions: establishing the vehicle of tantra as action, divided into two.
[3133] The presentation of the excellent mode of the causal vehicle.
[3134] And the explanation of the excellent vehicle itself.
[3135] First: Through the vehicle of characteristics, one must strive greatly with difficulty, accomplishing through great perseverance.
[3136] Through depending on causes, mantras ripen results with little effort, attaining Buddha, surpassing.
[3137] Through causes, the path of five, the ten grounds with great difficulty, over countless eons, to the Buddha.
[3138] Mantra: Excellent life alone.
[3139] The intermediate bardo.
[3140] Through least birth, through Buddha, quickly surpassing.
[3141] Even seeing the first truth of cause requires boundless collections and so forth.
[3142] Even accomplishing through subtle mantras, mandalas, offerings, and so forth, surpasses.
[3143] Not making emptiness in the direct path of cause.
[3144] Expedient meaning and definitive meaning.
[3145] Showing intention and hidden intention, arranging.
[3146] Mantra, shown directly in one moment, surpasses through freedom from obstacles and hindrances.
[3147] Briefly:
[3148] Accomplishing the meaning desired by the mantra vehicle through the causal vehicle.
[3149] Many means.
[3150] No difficulty.
[3151] Non-delusion.
[3152] Surpassing through sharp faculties accomplishing quickly.
[3153] From the lamp of the three modes.
[3154] Even if one meaning, non-delusion.
[3155] Many means, no difficulty.
[3156] Through control of sharp faculties.
[3157] Surpassing the excellent mantra vehicle.
[3158] Thus.
[3159] Second, from the five:
[3160] The essence is the self-arisen wisdom, the expanse of clear light, the truth directly realized, the supreme secret means.
[3161] The divisions of meeting the spontaneous expanse of generation and completion.
[3162] The definition is mantra, praised as supreme for quickly accomplishing enlightenment and protecting from affliction.
[3163] The purpose is to liberate the sharp sharpness of faculties.
[3164] The result is accomplished as supreme by Vajradhara in one life, the intermediate state, or through the path.
[3165] Divided into two.



[3166] The outer vehicle of Muni's tantra.
[3167] And the inner vehicle of means tantra.
[3168] Thus it is said.
[3169] From self-arisen awareness.
[3170] The vajra vehicle has two aspects.
[3171] The outer Muni tantra.
[3172] And the inner means tantra.
[3173] Thus.
[3174] If one asks what is placed as tantra in mantra:
[3175] When the main person's continuum meets the clear light of expanse, it is called "thus."
[3176] The first is divided into three.
[3177] The action tantra vehicle, Kriyā.
[3178] The both tantra vehicle, Upāya.
[3179] The yoga tantra vehicle, Yoga.
[3180] Thus it is said.
[3181] From that itself.
[3182] The outer tantra has three aspects.
[3183] Kriyā, Upāya, Yoga.
[3184] Thus.
[3185] First:
[3186] Accomplishing through the three purifications and pure conduct as self and deity, master and servant, attaining accomplishment.
[3187] This divides into two.
[3188] The main activity of purification.
[3189] The main activity of visualization.
[3190] First: Entering through bath and pure sound, meditating on the body as pure deity form.
[3191] Performing the three baths.
[3192] Changing the three garments.
[3193] Relying on the three whites.
[3194] And relying on the three sweets, etc.
[3195] From the lower, this surpassing manner.
[3196] Not establishing as true in the capacity of conventional appearance.
[3197] Through the three objects of meditation—visualizing forms, statues, images—all appearances become clear as deity forms.
[3198] Without abandoning form, not abiding in the extremes of one and many.
[3199] Meditating on speech syllables and letters, all sounds become clear as deity sounds, reciting mantras.
[3200] Not abiding in the four extremes of birth and cessation.
[3201] The sound extent is no other than the deity of sound.
[3202] Meditating on the mind's signs, all thoughts become clear as concentration deities.
[3203] Not departing from all thought through meditation, not abiding in great dependent origination.
[3204] Not even conventionally arising or born.
[3205] In ultimate truth, commitment deities, primordial wisdom beings.



[3206] Looking at the aspects of self, speech, and beings as master and servant, obstacles cease and accomplishments are obtained.
[3207] Depending on common accomplishments, conventional truth is not abandoned.
[3208] Depending on supreme accomplishments, ultimate truth is not established—thus surpassing.
[3209] The main activity of visualization is meditating on deity through the generation and completion stages, the subtle radiating and gathering.
[3210] Meditating on the deity's form, speech, and mind as the collection of forms, sounds, and thoughts.
[3211] The main activity of purification is through the purity of body and speech.
[3212] The main activity of the object is the meditation of mind.
[3213] Thus it is said.
[3214] From self-arisen awareness.
[3215] The established view of the Kriyā vehicle.
[3216] The door of entry is the three purifications.
[3217] Entering through bath and purity.
[3218] The samaya of protection is thus:
[3219] Not drinking even one cup of water.
[3220] Conducting without distraction.
[3221] Performing the three purifications of action.
[3222] The three purifications are:
[3223] The purification of deity and mandala.
[3224] The purification of substance and enjoyment.
[3225] The purification of mantra and concentration.
[3226] The view of realization is thus:
[3227] The two purifications of deity and yogi.
[3228] Viewing as master and servant.
[3229] The stage of abandonment is thus:
[3230] Abandoning meat, fish, onions.
[3231] And likewise alcohol, etc.
[3232] Attachment to concentration.
[3233] Such is the Kriyā vehicle.
[3234] Thus.
[3235] The fifth: The both tantra vehicle, Upāya.
[3236] Since one desires conduct as Kriyā and view as Yoga.
[3237] It is called the neutral vehicle.
[3238] Also this: Through bathing and purity, making the three doors pure.
[3239] Accomplishing the supreme mandala and so forth through the five manifest enlightenments and so forth.
[3240] Also this from self-arisen awareness.
[3241] Upāya is thus.
[3242] View as Yoga.
[3243] Conduct as Kriyā.
[3244] Therefore it is called the both tantra.
[3245] Thus.
[3246] The sixth: The yoga tantra vehicle.



[3247] Through the five doors of manifest enlightenment, viewing self and deity as brothers and friends, conducting samaya and purity.
[3248] Desiring to obtain through the great collection of the result wheel.
[3249] Divided: The main activity of action.
[3250] The main activity of concentration.
[3251] First: Performing ritual actions.
[3252] The supreme action king.
[3253] From the two supreme mandala kings.
[3254] Action, and scattered actions.
[3255] From the two: relying on the supreme action king.
[3256] Scattered actions rely on any ritual aspect, desiring enlightenment.
[3257] Offerings.
[3258] Tormas.
[3259] Fire offerings.
[3260] Continuous effort in recitation and so forth.
[3261] The supreme action king is practiced through all aspects of mandala accomplishment.
[3262] Desiring enlightenment through five or six means: tormas, fire offerings, and so forth.
[3263] The supreme mandala king:
[3264] Through ground rituals, relying on empowerment until one becomes a Buddha.
[3265] The main activity of concentration:
[3266] The first stage of preparation.
[3267] If relying on completely pure concentration.
[3268] One may meditate on a single deity.
[3269] Or meditate on the mandala wheel.
[3270] Generating through the five manifest enlightenments.
[3271] Through sun and moon, relying on means and wisdom, manifest enlightenment arises from meditating on the lotus, stacked high.
[3272] Through the door of completely perfect form adornment, manifest enlightenment in the completely pure sense fields.
[3273] Through the wheel of the syllables and letters Ālī Kālī, manifest enlightenment in the aspects of sound, words, and names.
[3274] The vajra of mind, signs, and embrace.
[3275] Through doors such as wheels and jewels, manifest enlightenment as Buddhas of each family.
[3276] Through the door of completely pure primordial wisdom beings, manifest enlightenment in the completely pure nature of reality through the five meditations.
[3277] The completely pure outer aggregates and elements.



[3278] The inner five actions and afflictions are completely purified.
[3279] The five secret objects and faculties are completely purified.
[3280] The five families become Buddhas as one's own self.
[3281] Meditating on commitment deity and self as brothers and friends.
[3282] Knowing no good cause for deity.
[3283] Accomplishment arises from oneself.
[3284] Realizing no bad cause for self, now as clear deity form in the illusion body—surpassing the lower.
[3285] Also this: Realizing the generation deity and self as non-dual.
[3286] Neither ultimate nor conventional name exists.
[3287] These also:
[3288] From self-arisen awareness.
[3289] The established view of yoga is thus.
[3290] The doors of entry are the five manifest enlightenments.
[3291] The view of realization as deity and friend.
[3292] Keeping the three samayas of protection without shame.
[3293] Pure conduct neither refutes nor establishes.
[3294] The five enlightenments are thus.
[3295] Enlightenment through the door of seat.
[3296] Enlightenment through the door of form.
[3297] Enlightenment through the door of emblem.
[3298] Enlightenment through the door of generation.
[3299] Enlightenment through the door of syllables and letters.
[3300] Thus the five enlightenments are practiced.
[3301] The three shameless ones—what are they?
[3302] Shamelessness through commitment deity.
[3303] Shamelessness through master, disciples, and friends.
[3304] Shamelessness through one's own mind.
[3305] Deity and yogi are also oneself.
[3306] Desiring the manner of brother and friend.
[3307] Meditating on deity and mandala as non-dual with self.
[3308] Deity also arises from self and dissolves into self.
[3309] Desiring the radiation and gathering of self and deity.
[3310] Thus.
[3311] The seventh: The presentation of the mahāyoga tantra vehicle—surpassing the lower.
[3312] The explanation of the supreme vehicle itself, divided into two.
