[578] First, the explanation of the sequence of pure fields and container-contained:
[579] Thus, from Vajradhara—the nature of complete qualities—having awakened to Bodhi,
[580] Arising from the Dharmakāya as Saṃbhogakāya,
[581] From the bodies of the Five Families,
[582] From the arrangement of immeasurable pure fields,
[583] Among the immeasurable pure fields abiding in the essence ornamented by Vairochena at the center,
[584] Upon the Jewel Lotus, in the thirteenth of the twenty-five stacked realms, abides this Jambudvīpa.
[585] Above and below this, and in the intermediate directions, exist thirteen pure fields ornamented by light and jewels.
[586] 
[587] From the Sound Tantra of Thalgyur:
[588] <verse> "To the thirteen types of fields—
[589] <verse> Below this world is
[590] <verse> That called Thalba-dyang,
[591] <verse> Of immeasurable extent, extremely beautiful.
[592] <verse> Cause, condition, nature,
[593] <verse> And the retinue of the Teacher's doctrine—
[594] <verse> Above, below, and in intermediate directions,
[595] <verse> Small, delightful, well-arranged and ornamented.
[596] <verse> Then below the six worlds,
[597] <verse> That called Thalba-dzin—
[598] <verse> Wheel-shaped, completely pervasive;
[599] <verse> The Teacher's doctrine of true reality,
[600] <verse> The second, well-ornamented arrangement.
[601] <verse> To the right of the three worlds from here,
[602] <verse> That called Thalba-kyob—
[603] <verse> Completely ornamented by the Mothers,
[604] <verse> With certain light and color clarity;
[605] <verse> The pure field of the Teacher's Vinaya doctrine,
[606] <verse> With individual karma and characteristics.
[607] <verse> Then above the six worlds,
[608] <verse> That called Thalba-dal—
[609] <verse> Lotus-blossom shaped, resembling
[610] <verse> Utterly pervasive, evenly pervading;
[611] <verse> Various lights blazing, colors
[612] <verse> White and red appearance swirling,
[613] <verse> Not displaying coarse form-images;
[614] <verse> The Teacher's doctrine of expanded Abhidharma,
[615] <verse> Called Thal of completed kalpa.
[616] <verse> Above this world from here,
[617] <verse> Nineteen beyond, further above,
[618] <verse> That called Thalba's Club—
[619] <verse> Utterly delightful, well-proportioned,
[620] <verse> From various jewel fragments
[621] <verse> Certainly ornamented, piled up;
[622] <verse> The Teacher's doctrine possessing both perfections,
[623] <verse> The arrangement of skull-garlands.
[624] <verse> From here, the northeast intermediate direction of the world,
[625] <verse> That called Thalba's Current—
[626] <verse> Stūpa-shaped, with beautiful terraced slopes,
[627] <verse> Completely ornamented by five arrangements;
[628] <verse> The basis from which various sounds arise,
[629] <verse> By that the Teacher's doctrine of dependent arising—
[630] <verse> Above that, at the twenty-first,
[631] <verse> Called utterly pervasive Thal,
[632] <verse> In the nature of pure perception,
[633] <verse> Appearing without outer or inner, completely pervasive;
[634] <verse> The Teacher's doctrine revealing arising,
[635] <verse> The causal condition of activity: Viṣṇu."
