[1021] First, Nirmanakaya essence: from expanse-kaya and rigpa, radiating as light-kaya and so forth, performing others' benefit.
[1022] The etymology:
[1023] From Self-Arisen:
[1024] Know these emanation-kaya etymologies:
[1025] Because appearing suitable to world-realms beings—emanation kaya.
[1026] Because able to perform emanation-kaya benefit—emanation kaya.
[1027] Because performing all actions—emanation kaya.
[1028] Because able to liberate numberless beings into expanse—emanation kaya.
[1029] Because brief in time in one field realm—emanation kaya.
[1030] Because compassion arising without direction—emanation kaya.
[1031] Because wrathful and fierce—emanation kaya.
[1032] Because peaceful and certain—emanation kaya.
[1033] Because beings see as beautiful—emanation kaya.
[1034] Thus it is spoken.
[1035] Third, the characteristics:


### PAGE 20

[1036] Performing disciples' two benefits completion:
[1037] From that same nature:
[1038] Emanation-kaya characteristics:
[1039] Actions completion performing,
[1040] Two aspects considered.
[1041] Thus it is spoken.
[1042] Fourth, divisions: generally explained as nature-emanation, beings-taming emanation, and so forth;
[1043] On this occasion, depending upon two benefits' completion establishment,
[1044] Completed actions emanation-kaya
[1045] And performing actions emanation-kaya—these two held.
[1046] Moreover, completed actions emanation-kaya, self-benefit spontaneously established:
[1047] In this life or intermediate state, completing spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate,
[1048] Through three connections emanation, benefit performed for those arising as impurity-gate six realms self-appearance,
[1049] Merely in self-appearance, thoroughly purifying six families, expanse peaceful.
[1050] Samsara's self-appearance must emptied,
[1051] For delusion-appearance must emptied.
[1052] In common as well:
[1053] "May samsara's three lower realms be exhausted and emptied,"
[1054] Thus it is said, and
[1055] For all beings' liberation mind producing sake.
[1056] Particularly in intermediate state: able or unable emanations release, opening emanations thus Buddha-becoming—all actions,
[1057] When six realms' stations appear below in spontaneously accomplished self-appearance gate,
[1058] There, through Dharma teaching and so forth, benefit performed for that emptiness-appearing self-appearance,
[1059] By that cause, all samsara-appearing becomes empty,
[1060] When dissolving into pure nirvana expanse through spontaneous accomplishment gate,
[1061] It is called "Buddha entering nirvana."
[1062] This is crucially important to all wisdom-possessors.
[1063] Furthermore, that emptiness-appearing for self-benefit establishing, being self-arisen emanation that liberates self into expanse, is called completed actions emanation-kaya.
[1064] From Self-Arisen:
[1065] Completed actions emanation-kaya:
[1066] Liberating one's own continuum, manifestly awakened,
[1067] From that, distributing emanations.
[1068] Outer-inner actions complete—
[1069] Considered as completed actions emanation-kaya.
[1070] Thus it is spoken.
[1071] Emanations distributing manner:


### PAGE 21

[1072] When seeing spontaneously accomplished intermediate state's eight gates completion,
[1073] Liberated by knowing self-face,
[1074] In impure samsara's gate,
[1075] Oneself, from Sambhogakaya father-mother union's secret space, radiating light rays, entering individually into each station's pure father-mother womb, appearing to be born—through Dharma teaching, showing liberation.
[1076] This is like dream emanations opening example,
[1077] Summarized merely as self-appearance.
[1078] When channels and elements nearly pure, in this life also six realms appear inside thigle;
[1079] These bound by three inner crucial points binding, reaching exhaustion ground, not depending on emanations distributing.
[1080] This difficult point, if understood after knowing direct expression, is my power.
[1081] Second, performing actions emanation-kaya:
[1082] To ground-abiders, Sambhogakaya;
[1083] To impure, supreme emanation-kaya;
[1084] To very impure, emanating into suitable beings according to individual stations, performing individual beings' benefit.
[1085] From that same nature:
[1086] Performing actions emanation-kaya:
[1087] Showing to each whatever tames them,
[1088] Appearing suitable to others—
[1089] That is like above.
[1090] Not deluded regarding others' benefit,
[1091] Able to transform into anything.
[1092] Appearing suitable to others,
[1093] Overwhelming beings.
[1094] Afflictions naturally non-existent,
[1095] Latencies appearing like body.
[1096] To time-arrived beings,
[1097] Showing great correct benefit.
[1098] To whatever beings are tamed,
[1099] Appearing suitable to that.
[1100] Thus it is said.
[1101] That emanation-kaya also performs benefit through four individual correct knowledges:
[1102] Teaching Dharma in each being's own language through all languages' individual correct knowledge;
[1103] Also knowing faculties and latencies, showing suitable to that thought;
[1104] Also great vehicle
[1105] And small,
[1106] And various,
[1107] And secret mantra: generation and completion;


### PAGE 22

[1108] Individual and
[1109] Mind and
[1110] Wisdom and
[1111] Alaya and
[1112] Alaya dharmakaya showing and so forth, though showing many,
[1113] Dzogpa Chenpo's nature appears to some fortunate ones at times and occasions, not universally.
[1114] From Self-Arisen:
[1115] All languages knowing,
[1116] In whatever language, that showing.
[1117] Harmonious gathering through harmony,
[1118] Sometimes through words' gate showing,
[1119] Sometimes through dependent arising's gate showing,
[1120] Sometimes through blessing-engagement's gate showing,
[1121] Sometimes through generation's gate showing,
[1122] Sometimes through both's gate showing,
[1123] Sometimes through five awakenings showing,
[1124] Sometimes through three concentrations showing,
[1125] Sometimes expanse and wisdom showing,
[1126] Dzogchen meaning is not contradictory.
[1127] Appears to some fortunate individuals.
[1128] That showing manner is thus:
[1129] Sometimes rigpa-emptiness showing,
[1130] Sometimes no-rigpa emptiness showing,
[1131] Sometimes rigpa matter showing,
[1132] Sometimes rigpa alone showing,
[1133] Sometimes alaya dharmakaya showing,
[1134] Sometimes virtue-lacking sin-lacking showing,
[1135] Sometimes meditation-possessor showing,
[1136] Sometimes no-meditation showing.
[1137] Thus showing emanation-kaya
[1138] Secret mantra supreme's
[1139] Meaning from some not spoken.
[1140] Not spoken, speaking does not occur.
[1141] Though occasionally becomes spoken,
[1142] Arhats, pratyekabuddhas, sutras,
[1143] Hinayana—name also non-existent inside,
[1144] Supreme vehicle proclaims.
[1145] Therefore hidden from other dull intellects.
[1146] That person possessing those,
[1147] Performing actions emanation-kaya is considered.
[1148] Thus.
[1149] Also though Dzogpa Chenpo possible to arise,
[1150] From mind-expanse and pith instruction's very secret cycle down,
[1151] This Nyingtik supreme from universal possibility does not arise, thus extremely rare dharma section—know thus.
[1152] Therefore like jewel, hold as cherished ornament;
[1153] From Uttaratantra:
[1154] Rare arising, stainless,
[1155] Powerful, and world's
[1156] Ornament becoming, thus jewel itself.
[1157] As spoken thus.
[1158] Fifth, emanation-kaya's examination method:
[1159] Teaching dharma with benefit-happiness to common world beings and


### PAGE 23

[1160] Through Buddha's emanation, two benefits appear somewhat similar;
[1161] That certain examination:
[1162] From Self-Arisen:
[1163] Know emanation examining method like this:
[1164] Even when descending, gaze not wandering elsewhere,
[1165] In crown ushnisha, one hair cluster curling right,
[1166] In heart center, vajra form,
[1167] Royal caste or high caste birth.
[1168] Conducting conduct suitable to whatever,
[1169] Following in that whatever spoken,
[1170] Not establishing own preferred desires,
[1171] Deed, effort, grasping naturally non-existent,
[1172] Clearing whatever beings desire doubt.
[1173] Know that one possessing those is emanation-kaya—thus spoken.
[1174] Although these marks exist showing that as emanation,
[1175] Whether others suitable emanations or not uncertain;
[1176] With pure mind produced, strive to tame own continuum.
[1177] Second: individually explained, five kayas' enumeration—essence,
[1178] Etymology,
[1179] Appearance,
[1180] Division,
[1181] And meaning application—five aspects.
