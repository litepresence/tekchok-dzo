[10472] The general presentation of the nature of the seven bases,
[10473] And the detailed explanation of the supreme basis.
[10474] First, this has three parts:
[10475] A brief presentation of the nature of the seven bases,
[10476] Demonstrating the seven bases that fall into extremes as faulty,
[10477] And establishing the non-dual basis of primordial purity and spontaneous presence as one's own tradition.
[10478] First, regarding the general presentation of the seven views on the basis according to the Great Perfection system:
[10479] These are held by the individual tenets of those who propound philosophical positions,
[10480] Which are: the view that holds the basis as primordially pure,
[10481] The view that holds the basis as spontaneously present,
[10482] The view that holds the basis as uncertain,
[10483] The view that holds the basis as certain and the actual basis of meaning,
[10484] The view that holds the basis as transformable into anything whatsoever,
[10485] The view that holds the basis as accepting anything whatsoever,
[10486] And the view that holds the basis as various or multiplicity—these seven.
[10487] These are posited through adhering to one aspect or another of primordial purity, each accepting their own view.
[10488] Regarding this self-arisen wisdom,
[10489] Without asserting anything as either existent or non-existent,
[10490] From the aspect of the great sphere free from elaborations, one holds the basis as primordially pure.
[10491] One holds spontaneous presence as the nature of awareness naturally possessing qualities like the sun and its rays, without stains.
[10492] One holds the basis as uncertain because the nature of awareness is not established as singularly being this, being the great freedom from extremes and elaborations.
[10493] One holds the view of certainty because the nature of awareness is without change or transformation.
[10494] One holds the basis as transformable into anything whatsoever because one holds that the nature of awareness appears as anything.
[10495] One holds the basis as accepting anything whatsoever because one holds that all phenomena of samsara and nirvana arise from the nature of awareness.
[10496] One holds multiplicity because one holds that the nature of awareness appears without ceasing in its manner of appearance, being variegated and multi-colored.
[10497] These are all posited by seeing one aspect or another of the respective tenets regarding the single awareness.
[10498] From the Thalgyur:
[10499] The manner of abiding spontaneously established from the beginning,
[10500] Also through the manner of the seven bases:
[10501] Multiplicity appears as spontaneous presence from its own side,
[10502] But from the aspect of what changes, it is uncertain.
[10503] From what does not change, there is certainty.
[10504] The measure of appearance is transformable into anything.
[10505] Because all arise, assertions are made.
[10506] Because confusion is purified as primordially pure,
[10507] All manners of appearance are called variegated.
[10508] Thus it is said.

[10509] From the Klongdrukpa:
[10510] The basis spontaneously established from the beginning,
[10511] Although not existing as a singular entity,
[10512] From the aspect appearing as confusion,
[10513] When those who realize posit their determination,
[10514] It appears in the manner of seven stages.
[10515] Yet the appearance of seven stages
[10516] Arises from the single manner of appearance of the nature.
[10517] Because the singular is not known, it appears thus.
[10518] However, the meaning is like this:
[10519] When abiding as spontaneous presence itself,
[10520] The gathering of multiplicity appears as the essence.
[10521] When abiding as uncertain,
[10522] The aspect of the mind that transforms appears.
[10523] When abiding as certainty in its own face,
[10524] The aspect of remembrance without movement appears.
[10525] When abiding as transformable,
[10526] The aspect of mind through effort appears.
[10527] When abiding as the essence of what-is,
[10528] Whatever appears appears as its own nature.
[10529] When abiding as variegated,
[10530] The various individual manners appear.
[10531] When abiding as primordially pure,
[10532] Stains appear as primordially non-existent.
[10533] All of these arise from the stages of mind,
[10534] While one's own face is primordially pure.
[10535] Thus it is said.
[10536] Second, demonstrating the seven bases that fall into extremes as faulty:
[10537] Like blind men describing an elephant before them,
[10538] When proponents hold tenets by fixating on one aspect of awareness as realization, each establishing their acceptance deeply,
[10539] To refute these, there are seven meaningful points,
[10540] First, regarding the refutation of those who hold spontaneous presence:
[10541] The view is presented,
[10542] And there are two parts to refuting it.
[10543] First is the position of spontaneous accomplishment.
[10544] This does not exclude even India,
[10545] But is held as not falling into any extreme whatsoever.
[10546] Second: if it were spontaneously accomplished from the first, it would be unreasonable to be liberated from samsara that always circles, because it would be spontaneous presence.
[10547] Furthermore, nirvana also would not depend on conditions such as knowing one's own face, and so forth.
