[10472] The general presentation of the nature of the seven bases upon which views are established,
[10473] Together with the detailed explanation of the supreme basis that transcends all extremes.
[10474] First, this extensive topic comprises three principal divisions:
[10475] <list> First: a brief presentation of the essential nature of the seven bases,
[10476] <list> Second: demonstrating how the seven bases that fall into conceptual extremes are fundamentally faulty,
[10477] <list> Third: establishing the non-dual basis of primordial purity and spontaneous presence as the authentic tradition of one's own mind.
[10478] Regarding the first: the general presentation of the seven views on the basis according to the Great Perfection system of Atiyoga:
[10479] These seven positions are held individually by those who propound various philosophical tenets,
[10480] <list> The first: the view that holds the basis as primordially pure from the very beginning,
[10481] <list> The second: the view that holds the basis as spontaneously present with all qualities complete, || 10 ||
[10482] <list> The third: the view that holds the basis as uncertain and indeterminate,
[10483] <list> The fourth: the view that holds the basis as certain and established as the actual basis of meaningful existence,
[10484] <list> The fifth: the view that holds the basis as transformable into anything whatsoever,
[10485] <list> The sixth: the view that holds the basis as accepting anything whatsoever that arises,
[10486] <list> The seventh: the view that holds the basis as various, manifold, and multiplicity itself—these seven views complete.
[10487] These seven are posited through adhering to one limited aspect or another of the single primordial purity, each proponent accepting their own view as ultimate.
[10488] Regarding this self-arisen wisdom that transcends all conceptual fabrication:
[10489] Without asserting anything whatsoever as either existent or non-existent in the absolute sense,
[10490] <list> From the aspect of the great sphere free from all elaborations, one holds the basis as primordially pure;
[10491] <list> One holds spontaneous presence as the natural expression of awareness, spontaneously possessing all qualities like the sun and its rays, completely without stains; || 20 ||
[10492] <list> One holds the basis as uncertain because the nature of awareness is not established as singularly being any one thing, being the great freedom from all extremes and elaborations;
[10493] <list> One holds the view of certainty because the nature of awareness abides without change or transformation in its essential state;
[10494] <list> One holds the basis as transformable into anything whatsoever because one holds that the nature of awareness naturally appears as whatever manifests;
[10495] <list> One holds the basis as accepting anything whatsoever because one holds that all phenomena of samsara and nirvana arise equally from the nature of awareness;
[10496] <list> One holds multiplicity because one holds that the nature of awareness appears without ceasing in its manner of appearance, being naturally variegated and multi-colored.
[10497] These seven views are all posited merely by seeing one limited aspect or another of the respective tenets regarding the single awareness.
[10498] From the Thalgyur Tantra, supreme among all scriptures:
[10499] <tantra> The manner of abiding spontaneously established from the beginning,
[10500] <tantra> Also manifests through the manner of the seven bases:
[10501] <tantra> Multiplicity appears as spontaneous presence from its own side, || 30 ||
[10502] <tantra> But from the aspect of what changes, it is uncertain.
[10503] <tantra> From what does not change, there is certainty.
[10504] <tantra> The measure of appearance is transformable into anything.
[10505] <tantra> Because all arise, assertions are made.
[10506] <tantra> Because confusion is purified as primordially pure,
[10507] <tantra> All manners of appearance are called variegated.
[10508] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[10509] From the Klongdrukpa, treasury of profound meaning:
[10510] <tantra> The basis spontaneously established from the very beginning,
[10511] <tantra> Although not existing as a singular entity that can be grasped, || 40 ||
[10512] <tantra> From the aspect appearing as confusion to deluded minds,
[10513] <tantra> When those who realize the truth posit their determinations,
[10514] <tantra> It appears in the manner of seven distinct stages.
[10515] <tantra> Yet the appearance of these seven stages
[10516] <tantra> Arises from the single manner of appearance of the nature itself.
[10517] <tantra> Because the singular truth is not known by ordinary minds, it appears thus manifold.
[10518] <tantra> However, the meaning is like this:
[10519] <tantra> When abiding as spontaneous presence itself,
[10520] <tantra> The gathering of multiplicity appears as the essential nature.
[10521] <tantra> When abiding as uncertain, || 50 ||
[10522] <tantra> The aspect of the mind that transforms appears to delusion.
[10523] <tantra> When abiding as certainty in its own face,
[10524] <tantra> The aspect of remembrance without movement appears.
[10525] <tantra> When abiding as transformable,
[10526] <tantra> The aspect of mind through effort appears.
[10527] <tantra> When abiding as the essence of what-is,
[10528] <tantra> Whatever appears appears as its own nature.
[10529] <tantra> When abiding as variegated,
[10530] <tantra> The various individual manners appear.
[10531] <tantra> When abiding as primordially pure, || 60 ||
[10532] <tantra> Stains appear as primordially non-existent from the very first.
[10533] <tantra> All of these arise from the stages of mind's own delusion,
[10534] <tantra> While one's own face is primordially pure without change.
[10535] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[10536] Second: demonstrating that the seven bases that fall into conceptual extremes are faulty:
[10537] Like blind men describing an elephant before them, each grasping only a part,
[10538] When proponents of philosophical views hold tenets by fixating on one limited aspect of awareness as the complete realization, each establishing their acceptance deeply as the whole truth,
[10539] To thoroughly refute these partial views, there are seven meaningful points of logical analysis,
[10540] <list> First: regarding the refutation of those who hold spontaneous presence as the ultimate basis:
[10541] <list> The view they present must be examined, || 70 ||
[10542] <list> And there are two parts to thoroughly refuting it.
[10543] <list> First is the presentation of their position of spontaneous accomplishment.
[10544] <list> This view is held not only in India but universally,
[10545] <list> Yet is maintained as not falling into any extreme whatsoever—a claim we shall examine.
[10546] <list> Second: if the basis were spontaneously accomplished from the very first without cause, it would be completely unreasonable to speak of being liberated from samsara that always circles in confusion, because bondage itself would be spontaneous presence and thus no different from liberation;
[10547] <list> Furthermore, nirvana also would not depend upon any conditions such as knowing one's own face, effort, or practice, and so forth—making the path meaningless.
