[10782] First: establishing the dispute regarding the non-dual basis of primordial purity and spontaneous presence.
[10783] Critics argue that each of primordial purity and spontaneous presence possesses inherent faults when posited separately as the basis: if the essence were exclusively primordially pure without spontaneous presence, since samsara would not exist as other than purity, it would be unreasonable for sentient beings' confusion to ever arise.
[10784] Conversely, because the nature is held as merely spontaneous presence without primordial purity, whoever accepts this position follows that one is primordially liberated without any effort or recognition.
[10785] It follows that primordial purity and spontaneous presence contradict each other when posited as separate substances of a single basis—a fundamental problem requiring resolution.
[10786] The answer to this objection: because the essence is primordially pure in its empty nature, sentient beings do not ultimately exist in samsara as real entities.
[10787] From the power of spontaneous presence as merely the play of the path, appearing like that does not contradict primordial purity—the two are non-dual.
[10788] Just as when going to sleep and in the time of sleep, though dreams do not exist in the own-face of awareness,
[10789] Appearances of horses and oxen appearing to the dreamer does not contradict the empty nature of sleep.
[10790] Moreover, though sentient beings appear to deluded perception, because the meaning of the essence is not established merely through the play of illusion, they are primordially liberated and finished from the very beginning.

[10791] When horses and oxen appear through the power of mantra to the eye in conventional appearance, manifesting as liberation to the pure perception of yogins,
[10792] Because the nature dwells in its own place without effort, reverting spontaneously like a child's ball that returns when thrown.
[10793] When appearing as liberated into the expanse of space, from that time appearing as reverted is merely reversion without new arising,
[10794] Because liberation newly arising and bondage are not established as real entities.
[10795] Moreover, from the conventional aspect of appearance as spontaneous presence with all qualities,
[10796] From the ultimate aspect of emptiness as primordially pure, it is merely expressed in words—beyond word and concept.
[10797] Because those two—primordial purity and spontaneous presence—are not separate substances, they do not change separately or contradict.
[10798] Though the essence is one in emptiness, reversion in appearance is different and separate—being thus is not a contradiction.
[10799] Just as being a vow-possessor and being fully ordained do not contradict but complement each other in the path.
[10800] Those are also the dispute-answers establishing non-duality.
[10801] From the Klong drug pa, profound tantra of Great Perfection:
<tantra> [10802] "Because the essence itself is primordially pure from the first,
<tantra> [10803] Sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable as real existence.
<tantra> [10804] Because stains of non-recognition are primordially exhausted in the nature.
<tantra> [10805] Thus spoke the Teacher, O great bodhisattva, listen well.
<tantra> [10806] Because the nature is spontaneously accomplished with all qualities,
<tantra> [10807] That also appears as play without ceasing in the field."
[10808] The bodhisattva himself also asked the Teacher for clarification:
<tantra> [10809] "If the nature itself is spontaneous accomplishment complete,
<tantra> [10810] These sentient beings are reasonably self-liberated without effort.
<tantra> [10811] Because primordially spontaneously accomplished from the beginning."
[10812] He spoke in response: "These sentient beings,
<tantra> [10813] Because the essence is primordially pure without stain,
<tantra> [10814] Liberations also appear as play without contradiction."
[10815] The bodhisattva also asked to clarify further doubts:
<tantra> [10816] "If the essence itself is primordially pure alone,
<tantra> [10817] Spontaneous accomplishment would also become unnecessary.
<tantra> [10818] Or, if all is spontaneously accomplished without purity,
<tantra> [10819] Primordially pure would not become manifest."
[10820] The Teacher spoke regarding the way of existence beyond extremes:
<tantra> [10821] "Because there are no words by which to express the ultimate,
<tantra> [10822] Being free from words of expression and sound entirely,
<tantra> [10823] Because the essence of anything is not established as real,
<tantra> [10824] Words are free from harming this ultimate nature.
<tantra> [10825] Sentient beings, from the object of self-grasping mind alone,
<tantra> [10826] Because variety, recollection, and thought do not cease in delusion,
<tantra> [10827] Words do not harm the essence—there is no distinction in the nature.
<tantra> [10828] Because of the term ultimate and conventional distinction."
[10829] Thus it is established definitively.
[10830] Second: the unsurpassed basis particularly explained according to the tradition of Great Perfection has three principal parts:
<list> [10831] First: the common brief presentation of the essential nature,
<list> [10832] Second: elaborately explained from the respective aspects of essence and nature,
<list> [10833] Third: the meaning gathering establishing the complete view.
[10834] Regarding the first: the beginning basis of all—the essence, primordially pure like a conch shell pure and unmixed with stains; the nature, spontaneously accomplished, not established as any limited thing or mark; inside the white mandala, having subtle self-light as depth-clarity shining, although conditions not existing, therefore not appearing outwardly to deluded perception—
[10835] Outside, limitless, unobstructed and unbound, the youth vase body abides as the actual state of reality itself.
[10836] Because the essence is primordially pure, it is empty of inherent existence;
[10837] Although no thing exists as real, the subtle awareness with primordial resonance and self-light is not restricted by any condition, naturally self-possessed.
[10838] Because the nature is spontaneously accomplished, although abiding as the arise-base of all appearances everywhere,
[10839] In its own face, outwardly clear, light and body and color with limiting marks are not appearing as real.
[10840] Inside the vast expanse of essence primordially pure, the primordial resonance of nature spontaneously accomplished, depth-clarity, subtle self-light, together with pristine cognition—
[10841] These are one in essence, and
[10842] Different in aspect, and
[10843] Not separate in manner—light-clear supreme spontaneous presence jewel casket of all qualities.
[10844] The youth vase body field of natural perfection.
[10845] Essence, nature, and compassion three as one possession supreme abides as the basis.
[10846] Because essence is empty, it is not established as limited thing and mark;
[10847] Because nature is clear, primordial resonance in appearance with own-face not abandoned;
[10848] Because compassion is awareness that knows, pristine cognition expanding everywhere, arise-base of all not ceasing abides as the ground.
[10849] From this non-dual nature, the great Auspicious Beautiful Tantra speaks:
<tantra> [10850] "Before realized Buddha ever arose as other,
<tantra> [10851] Before unrealized sentient beings appeared as deluded,
<tantra> [10852] Awareness self-arisen wisdom, unmoved from basis of all,
<tantra> [10853] Condition-not-existing appearance of three bodies together abide."
[10854] Then again the Teacher, awareness pristine cognition itself,
[10855] This actual state of own abiding manner spoke for disciples:
<verse> [10856] "O appearance great vast expanse this very mind,
<verse> [10857] From unmoving Dharmakaya great beyond all change,
<verse> [10858] Abide as Buddha great not confused by any delusion.
<verse> [10859] Essence body not ceasing abides from beginningless time.
<verse> [10860] Essence not changing in its nature.
<verse> [10861] Method secret beyond expression.
<verse> [10862] Unmoved by any condition.
<verse> [10863] Not moving from own place.
<verse> [10864] Not shaken by any wind of concept."
<ornament>
<ornament> ### PAGE 264
<ornament>
<verse> [10865] "All appearances complete at one time beyond sequence,
<verse> [10866] All pristine cognition complete at one moment without effort,
<verse> [10867] All bodies mature abiding in perfection,
<verse> [10868] All light appearance unobscured clear luminosity."
[10869] In the actual-state appearance of the basis itself,
[10870] Unobscured appearance-manner of essence nature compassion three, without interruption completely perfected great beyond compare.
[10871] That great actual-state of essence also abides like the vast body of reality itself,
[10872] Yet the eyes, ears, and nose as sense faculties are not abiding as substantially real entities.
[10873] It abides like emptiness itself; yet falling into a reified emptiness is not its abiding.
[10874] In the great appearance manifesting like the five wisdom lights,
[10875] Dividing into limited, graspable color is not its mode of abiding.
[10876] In appearance without interruption or ceasing, connection like cause-and-effect is not established.
[10877] In wisdom without center or periphery to see or grasp,
[10878] No direction toward which to point is found abiding.
[10879] In appearance like space, not stained by any part or limit,
[10880] Dividing into conceptual category is not its nature.
[10881] Appearance manifests like the spontaneous ornament of awareness, never ceasing.
[10882] Height, depth, above, or below appearing as substantially real is none whatsoever.
[10883] Natural expression appearance is:
<list> [10884] Like vast space appearing, direction-falling without any limit;
<list> [10885] Like clear water appearing, thing to grasp without any nature;
<list> [10886] Like deep-blue lapis appearing, not divided by part or section;
<list> [10887] Like white conch appearing, order and sequence not holding;
<list> [10888] Like yellow gold appearing, qualities spontaneously complete;
<list> [10889] Like red ruby appearing, clarity and brightness not ceasing;
<list> [10890] Like green emerald appearing, qualities spontaneously perfect.
[10891] Five colors themselves abiding in unity, color not holding as separate great beyond limit.
[10892] Rolled-up potential, yet shape without fixed form.
[10893] Not ceasing in manifestation, yet condition without dependence.
[10894] Not pervading partially, yet great self-resonance everywhere.
[10895] Self-clear luminosity, outer inner together with as one.
[10896] Without effort or accomplishment, yet by spontaneous force accomplished.
[10897] Compassion appearance manifests as:
<list> [10898] Like empty space appearing, clarity not ceasing anywhere;
<list> [10899] Without elaboration of concept, great elaboration of qualities complete;
<list> [10900] Nature not ceasing in essence, various not determined as fixed categories;
<list> [10901] Clear luminosity without limit, darkness nowhere to be found;
<list> [10902] Not ceasing in manifestation, not-existing as real great beyond extremes;
<list> [10903] Force-empty from beginning, all-arising great manifestation;
<list> [10904] Not mixed with impurities, completely appearing as pure great;
<list> [10905] Pervading all without limit, gathered into one great unity;
<list> [10906] Pure from the first, confusion not ceasing as its display great.
<ornament>
<ornament> ### PAGE 265
<ornament>
<verse> [10907] "Complete as one appearance great without duality,
<verse> [10908] Compassion not ceasing abides thus from beginningless time."
[10909] From the Thalgyur Tantra, mother of all Dzogchen teachings:
<verse> [10910] "First essence nature spontaneously present,
<verse> [10911] And compassion three aspects inseparably abiding.
<verse> [10912] That also essence as body abiding,
<verse> [10913] Dharma enjoyment emanation three aspects,
<verse> [10914] Not divided yet dividing without manner—
<verse> [10915] By spontaneous force accomplished itself also,
<verse> [10916] Body color and qualities mind-object without.
<verse> [10917] Natural expression appearing as light manner,
<verse> [10918] White red yellow green and deep-blue,
<verse> [10919] Not mark with-mark appearance without,
<verse> [10920] Without category yet knowable by force accomplished.
<verse> [10921] Compassion appearance various manifesting from basis,
<verse> [10922] This like nature one determined without fixation,
<verse> [10923] Because various appearances manifest, basis called the ground of all."
[10924] Thus it is said in the tantra of supreme meaning.
[10925] That also, because from the side of essence primordially pure, nothing whatsoever is established as real, although the outwardly-clear aspect with light and body-color appears, it is not established as any limited category;
[10926] From the expanse of that nature spontaneously accomplished, the primordial resonance of the five lights—body, rays, and bindu—appears as the most subtle essence of being,
[10927] Coiled within the vast expanse of awareness itself, inner clear subtle pristine cognition naturally exists without obstruction.
[10928] That also, if cut into the side of primordial purity alone as one aspect,
[10929] What would be the aspect of body and pristine cognition arising?
[10930] In the basis held as only primordially pure, nothing whatsoever exists as other.
[10931] If thinking arising from that expanse as spontaneous presence,
[10932] Does it exist or not exist as separate?
[10933] If not exists, arising is not logically valid,
[10934] Just as from non-thing nothing can arise—like that.
[10935] If exists as other, it contradicts with holding nothing whatsoever exists in the basis.
[10936] Therefore, the nature of primordially pure is spontaneous presence inseparable,
[10937] In that expanse inner clear subtle pristine cognition primordial resonance clarity appearance subtle naturally exists.
[10938] That also, outwardly clear coarse appearance not accepted as real, liberated from extreme of permanence;
[10939] Inner clear subtle awareness held as natural, liberated from extreme of nihilism.
[10940] Thus, free from all extremes, self-arisen pristine cognition essence empty, not established anywhere as limited thing.
[10941] Nature clear appearance manner not ceasing in display.
[10942] Compassion not ceasing in knowing, whatever like appears, basis doing all manifestation is,
[10943] Basis as thing-essence actual state of reality itself.
[10944] Second: elaborately explained from the respective aspects of the basis has two divisions:
<list> [10945] First: essence empty aspect from the reversion of primordial purity elaborately explained;
<list> [10946] Second: nature appearance aspect from the reversion of spontaneous presence elaborately explained.
[10947] Regarding the first aspect of essence as primordial purity:
[10948] Because what is primordially pure is not established as any limited thing or mark, by reversion regarding the empty nature,
<verse> [10949] Awareness not exists as real entity;
<verse> [10950] Non-awareness not exists as other;
<verse> [10951] Buddha not exists as separate from mind;
<verse> [10952] Sentient beings not exists as truly deluded;
<verse> [10953] Samsara not exists as real place;
<verse> [10954] Nirvana not exists as other place;
<verse> [10955] Light not exists as substantial thing;
<verse> [10956] Color not exists as real quality;
<verse> [10957] Body not exists as material form;
<verse> [10958] Pristine cognition not exists as separate knower;
<verse> [10959] Basis not exists as ground to find;
<verse> [10960] Path not exists as way to travel;
<verse> [10961] Fruition not exists as result to obtain;
<verse> [10962] Whoever confusion not exists as real delusion;
<verse> [10963] Liberation not exists as freedom to gain;
<verse> [10964] Bondage not exists as state to escape;
<verse> [10965] Liberation not exists as separate from bondage;
<verse> [10966] Action not exists as real cause;
<verse> [10967] Afflictions not exists as true obscuration;
<verse> [10968] Wind not exists as element to grasp;
<verse> [10969] Elements not exists as bases of form;
<verse> [10970] Is not exists as affirmation;
<verse> [10971] Is-not not exists as negation;
<verse> [10972] What not exists as particular thing;
<verse> [10973] What not exists as anything at all;
<verse> [10974] Anything established as real and anything observable as separate—not found.
[10975] Negation dharma is shown only by contrast to establishment dharma; abandoning both extremes is the meaning,
[10976] From Auspicious Beautiful Tantra, treasury of definitive meaning:
<verse> [10977] "Called great primordial purity beyond all concept.
<verse> [10978] Truly arisen Buddha never arose as other from mind.
<verse> [10979] Not pure sentient beings never arose as truly deluded abiding.
<verse> [10980] Called great primordial resonance unmoved awareness essence.
<verse> [10981] To that ultimate inexpressible by any word.
<verse> [10982] Immeasurable by any standard.
<verse> [10983] Not observable as object of senses.
<verse> [10984] Not measurable by any concept.
<verse> [10985] Not calculable by any number.
<verse> [10986] By whoever not determined as this or that.
<verse> [10987] Not showable as exhibit to others.
<verse> [10988] Knowing object not makeable by fabrication.
<verse> [10989] By that pristine nature samsara not seen as real.
<verse> [10990] Samsara by that deluded mind not seen as basis.
<verse> [10991] That ultimate dharma not practiced as method.
<verse> [10992] By ordinary dharma that ultimate meaning not realized.
<verse> [10993] That ultimate samsara not is as real.
<verse> [10994] Nirvana not is as other than mind.
<verse> [10995] Basis not is as ground to find.
<verse> [10996] Appearance not is as thing seen.
<verse> [10997] Darkness not is as obstruction.
<verse> [10998] Path not is as way to walk.
<verse> [10999] Traverse not as journey to make.
<verse> [11000] Not traverse not is as remaining.
<verse> [11001] Fruition not is as result to obtain.
<verse> [11002] Abandoned not is as renunciation.
<verse> [11003] Obtained not is as acquisition.
<verse> [11004] That called great awareness expanse of mind itself."
[11005] From Letterless Tantra, meaning beyond word and concept:
<verse> [11006] "To me self-arisen pristine cognition nature,
<verse> [11007] Analyzing object of scrutiny not exists.
<verse> [11008] Before passed not exists as past.
<verse> [11009] After arising not exists as future.
<verse> [11010] Now appearing anything not exists as present.
<verse> [11011] Action not exists as real cause.
<verse> [11012] Latency not exists as hidden seed.
<verse> [11013] Non-awareness not exists as true delusion.
<verse> [11014] Mind not exists as separate entity.
<verse> [11015] Intellect not exists as thinking.
<verse> [11016] Wisdom not exists as separate knowing.
<verse> [11017] Samsara not exists as real cycle.
<verse> [11018] Nirvana not exists as true peace.
<verse> [11019] Awareness itself also not exists as thing.
<verse> [11020] Pristine cognition appearance anything not exists as real."

[11021] From Mu-tig-phreng-ba, pearl garland of essential instructions:
<verse> [11022] "Natural expression abiding essence to primordial purity,
<verse> [11023] Buddha not exists as separate and sentient beings not exists as other.
<verse> [11024] Non-awareness not exists and confusion not exists as real.

<verse> [11040] Expanse not exists as space, palace also not exists as container.
<verse> [11041] Gods not exists as high, beyond offering object all conception."
[11042] Thus it is spoken in the tantra of supreme meaning.
[11043] From Klong-drug-pa, six expanses of Great Perfection:
<verse> [11044] "Elaboration-free dharmata primordially pure essence,
<verse> [11045] Own-face completely pure heart-essence basis of all.

<verse> [11052] What not exists as this, what not exists as that, anything whatsoever not exists as real.
<verse> [11053] Like that not-existing nature heart-essence to—all equally free."
[11054] Thus it is definitively spoken.
[11055] From Letterless Tantra, meaning beyond all expression:
<verse> [11056] "To me birth and death not exists as real events.
<verse> [11057] Cessation-free dharma completely perfect from beginning.
<verse> [11058] To me outer and inner not exists as separate.

[11077] From Rangshar, self-arisen wisdom tantra:
<verse> [11078] "First basis great primordially pure that to,
<verse> [11079] Thought not exists as conceptual mind.
<verse> [11080] Non-awareness not exists as separate delusion.
<verse> [11081] Mind not exists as substantial entity.
<verse> [11082] Intellect not exists as thinking process.
<verse> [11083] Grasping not exists as attachment.
<verse> [11084] That also like this essential nature:
<verse> [11085] Without interruption pristine cognition flows.
<verse> [11086] Spontaneously accomplished Buddha complete.
<verse> [11087] Elaboration-free dharmata beyond concept.
<verse> [11088] Without extremes awareness natural state.
<verse> [11089] Great pure appearance luminosity.
<verse> [11090] Direction-falling without view abides supreme."
[11091] That also the nature of basis is vast beyond limit,
[11092] Clear luminosity without obstruction,
[11093] Not changing in its essence,
[11094] Pristine cognition not ceasing in manifestation,
[11095] Bindu various expanding as display.
[11096] Not established as any limited dharmata.
[11097] Outer limitless unbound by direction.
[11098] Inner pristine cognition five lights not ceasing clear.
[11099] Body and pristine cognition essence abides as non-dual.
[11100] By this demonstration, primordially pure in pristine cognition and light appearance shown,
[11101] Primordially pure also not-thing as separate is refuted.
[11102] Second: the nature-appearance aspect, elaborately explained from the reversion of spontaneous presence, is as follows:
[11103] The natural expression of spontaneous presence—the actual state of the basis.
[11104] This meaning is not cut off even in the philosophical systems of India;
[11105] In direction anywhere, it has not fallen into partiality or limitation.
[11106] It is the ground and place where body and pristine cognition arise.
[11107] Inner clear subtle awareness naturally existing, outer limitless and unbound.
[11108] The jewel casket meaning of natural perfection,
[11109] The spontaneous presence jewel casket containing all qualities complete.
[11110] The youth vase body field, a light-clear expanse thickly arranged with all qualities.
[11111] Outer and inner without distinction as separate, yet everywhere becoming inner as the nature of mind,
<list> [11112] Root life-wind five elements as basis,
<list> [11113] Upon that body five kayas manifest,
<list> [11114] Speech five aspects complete,
<list> [11115] Mind five wisdoms pure,
<list> [11116] Qualities five perfections,
<list> [11117] Activity five displays,
<list> [11118] Pristine cognition five modes,
<list> [11119] Light five colors etcetera arising from basis.
[11120] It is the arising place of all appearances,
[11121] The supported object of all perception.
[11122] Not existing as real, yet appearing beyond as display.
[11123] Outer without limit, inner clear luminosity.
[11124] Part subtle, difficult to analyze by thought.
[11125] Basis-appearance arising as the body of display,
[11126] Path-appearance arising from the basis as the way,
[11127] Fruition appearance arising in the expanse as the result.
[11128] Form body and awareness arising together in the great expanse abide as the nature.
[11129] From Rangshar tantra definitive meaning:
<verse> [11130] "That expanse also without interruption or limit,
<verse> [11131] Direction anywhere not fallen into extreme.

<verse> [11181] "Buddha all great secret nature in,
<verse> [11182] Natural expression aspect supreme abides."
[11183] Thus it is spoken definitively.
[11184] From previous teachings of the same definitive meaning:
[11185] The natural expression of spontaneous presence—appearance as unobstructed display,
[11186] The jewel casket meaning containing all qualities complete.
[11187] The inner pristine cognition jewel of mind, appearance clear and luminous,
[11188] Outer and limitless, unbound by any direction or limit.
[11189] This is called the youth vase body, the actual state of the perfect basis.
[11190] Third: the meaning gathering, establishing the complete view:
[11191] The essence, primordially pure, without thing or mark of real existence;
[11192] The natural expression, spontaneously accomplished, body and pristine cognition abiding as non-dual, without gathering or separation, is the ultimate meaning.

[11199] Thus also taught in tantras of Great Perfection.
[11200] From Rangshar definitive meaning:
[11201] "I, not existing as a separate ego before, the basis like this abides naturally.
[11202] The basis, great primordially pure from the first, is so called.
[11203] Essence, nature, and compassion—three aspects—inseparably abide."
[11204] The essence, that unchanging pristine cognition not ceasing, clear luminosity.
[11205] The youth vase body, actual state beyond concept, is so called.
[11206] The natural expression of the five lights—appearance not ceasing as display.
[11207] Compassion-appearance, like the example of a sky cloud-free, is natural.
