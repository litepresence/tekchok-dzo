[10782] First: establishing the dispute.
[10783] Because each of primordial purity and spontaneous presence has faults: if the essence were primordially pure, since samsara would not exist, it would be unreasonable for sentient beings' confusion to arise.
[10784] Because the nature is spontaneous presence, whoever accepts this follows that one is primordially liberated without effort.
[10785] It follows that primordial purity and spontaneous presence contradict as substances of a single basis.
[10786] The answer: because the essence is primordially pure, sentient beings do not exist in samsara.
[10787] From the power of spontaneous presence as merely the play of the path, appearing like that does not contradict.
[10788] Just as when going to sleep and in the time of sleep, though dreams do not exist in the own-face of consciousness,
[10789] Appearances of horses and oxen appearing does not contradict.
[10790] Moreover, though sentient beings appear, because the meaning of the essence is not established merely through the play of illusion, they are primordially liberated and finished.

[10791] When horses and oxen appear through the power of mantra to the eye in conventional appearance, as liberation,
[10792] Because nature dwells in its own place without effort, reverting like a child's ball.
[10793] When appearing as liberated into space, from that time appearing as reverted is merely reversion,
[10794] Because liberation newly arising and bondage are not established.
[10795] Moreover, from the conventional aspect of appearance as spontaneous presence,
[10796] From the ultimate aspect of emptiness as primordially pure, it is merely expressed in words.
[10797] Because those two are not separate substances, they do not change separately.
[10798] Though the essence is one, reversion is different and separate—being thus is not.
[10799] Just as being a vow-possessor and being fully ordained do not contradict.
[10800] Those are also the dispute-answers.
[10801] From the Klong drug pa:
[10802] "Because the essence itself is primordially pure,
[10803] Sentient beings' samsara is not reasonable.
[10804] Because stains of non-recognition are primordially exhausted.
[10805] Thus spoke the Teacher, O great bodhisattva.
[10806] Because the nature is spontaneously accomplished,
[10807] That also appears as play without ceasing."
[10808] The bodhisattva himself also asked:
[10809] "If the nature itself is spontaneous accomplishment,
[10810] These sentient beings are reasonably self-liberated.
[10811] Because primordially spontaneously accomplished."
[10812] He spoke: "These sentient beings,
[10813] Because the essence is primordially pure,
[10814] Liberations also appear as play."
[10815] The bodhisattva also asked:
[10816] "Because the essence itself is primordially pure,
[10817] Spontaneous accomplishment would also become unnecessary.
[10818] Or, because spontaneously accomplished,
[10819] Primordially pure would not become."
[10820] The Teacher spoke regarding the way of existence:
[10821] "Because there are no words by which to express,
[10822] Being free from words of expression and sound,
[10823] Because the essence of anything is not established,
[10824] Words are free from harming this.
[10825] Sentient beings, from the object of self-grasping mind,
[10826] Because variety, recollection, and thought do not cease,
[10827] Words do not harm the essence—there is no distinction.
[10828] Because of the term ultimate and conventional."
[10829] Thus it is.
