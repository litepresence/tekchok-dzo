[8770] <prose> First, the outer:
[8771] <prose> Dividing the border of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa.
[8772] <prose> The inner: engaging the twenty-five Gnosises, offering the Maṇḍala and supplicating.
[8773] <prose> The secret: entering through the doors of the four directions of space into the door of mind itself.
[8774] <prose> The perfect: indicating awareness primordially pure, transcending conceptual mind, called "vast space."
[8775] <prose> These also from the Thalgyur:
[8776] <tantra> From the very unelaborate,
[8777] <prose> Divide below the border of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa.
[8778] <prose> At that time, from the characteristic of space,
[8779] <prose> The obscurations of body, speech, and mind also— || 10 ||
[8780] <prose> Are definitely gauged by characteristic.
[8781] <prose> If conduct is not pure,
[8782] <prose> Purify with virtue suitable to each self.

[8784] <prose> Introduce the face of self-knowing clarity,
[8785] <prose> Skillfully join instruction of untying symbols.
[8786] <prose> Thus it is.
[8787] <ornament> Fourth: The utterly unelaborate Empowerment:
[8788] <prose> Bestowing the Empowerment of introducing the self-nature of spontaneous accomplishment of the nature of reason, following the body's posture, gaze, and stance.
[8789] <tantra> From four—outer, inner, secret, and perfect: || 20 ||
[8790] <prose> The outer shows posture;
[8791] <prose> The inner shows gaze;
[8792] <prose> The secret: through posture to the four directions,
[8793] <prose> And training in the manner of gaze, practicing in the Buddha-field.
[8794] <prose> The perfect: applying the meaning of symbolic words such as "song" and so forth.
[8795] <prose> Thus also from the Thalgyur:
[8796] <prose> To the utterly unelaborate,
[8797] <prose> Open the door of the mind's Maṇḍala,
[8798] <prose> Definitely begin the body's posture,
[8799] <prose> Accustom to that and apply the manner of gaze, || 30 ||
[8800] <prose> Direct cognition is the symbol of scripture.
[8801] <prose> Thus it is.
[8802] <prose> Third meaning: Thus, regarding the kinds of bestowed Empowerments, there are three:
[8803] <prose> Briefly shown through the definite distinctions of the Four Empowerments;
[8804] <prose> Extensively explained through distinctions of self-face;
[8805] <prose> Very extensively elaborated through distinctions of emanation.
[8806] <ornament> Regarding the first:
[8807] <prose> The valid establishment of the Four Empowerments' certainty,
[8808] <prose> Showing examples of the four ripening teeth,
[8809] <prose> Explaining the nature of each—three from: || 40 ||
