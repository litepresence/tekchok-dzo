[8770] <prose> First, the outer recognition:
[8771] Recognizing the non-existent border of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa.
[8772] The inner recognition: engaging the twenty-five aspects of awareness, offering the self-display and supplicating one's own nature.
[8773] The secret recognition: entering through the doors of the four directions of space into the door of awareness itself.
[8774] The perfect recognition: indicating awareness primordially pure, transcending conceptual mind, called "vast space of recognition."
[8775] <tantra> These also from the Thalgyur:
[8776] From the very unelaborate recognition,
[8777] Recognize below the non-existent border of Saṃsāra and Nirvāṇa.
[8778] At that time, from the characteristic of space-like recognition,
[8779] The obscurations of body, speech, and mind also— || 10 ||
[8780] Are definitely gauged by recognition's own characteristic.
[8781] If recognition is not pure,
[8782] Purify with recognition suitable to each self.
[8783] Rely upon the symbolic recognition,
[8784] Introduce the face of self-knowing clarity,
[8785] Skillfully join recognition of untying symbols.
[8786] Thus it is.
[8787] <prose> Fourth: The utterly unelaborate recognition:
[8788] Bestowing the recognition of introducing the self-nature of spontaneous accomplishment of the nature of reason, following awareness's posture, gaze, and stance.
[8789] From four—outer, inner, secret, and perfect: || 20 ||
[8790] The outer shows recognition;
[8791] The inner shows awareness;
[8792] The secret: through recognition to the four directions,
[8793] And resting in the manner of awareness, abiding in the Buddha-field.
[8794] The perfect: applying the meaning of symbolic recognition such as "song" and so forth.
[8795] <tantra> Thus also from the Thalgyur:
[8796] To the utterly unelaborate recognition,
[8797] Open the door of the mind's self-display,
[8798] Definitely begin awareness's posture,
[8799] Accustom to that and apply the manner of awareness, || 30 ||
[8800] Direct cognition is the symbol of recognition.
[8801] Thus it is.
[8802] <prose> Third meaning: Thus, regarding the kinds of bestowed recognitions, there are three:
[8803] Briefly shown through the definite distinctions of the Four recognitions;
[8804] Extensively explained through distinctions of self-face;
[8805] Very extensively elaborated through distinctions of display.
[8806] Regarding the first:
[8807] The valid establishment of the Four recognitions' certainty,
[8808] Showing examples of the four ripening recognitions,
[8809] Explaining the nature of each—three from: || 40 ||
[8810] <ornament> Recognition through complete wisdom-display,
[8811] Direct recognition without support,
[8812] Spontaneous marks of awakened display—
[8813] All pointing to immediate recognition.
|| 50 ||
