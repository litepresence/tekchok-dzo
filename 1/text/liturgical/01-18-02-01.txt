[4156] Extensively explaining that nature,
[4157] The definite branches of explanation.
[4158] First: six,
[4159] The essence of Tantra,
[4160] Definite terms,
[4161] Divisions,
[4162] Rising measures,
[4163] Examples,
[4164] Validities.
[4165] First, the essence of Tantra:
[4166] Awareness and that certainty brought to certainty—the great secret, cannot add or remove, definite.
[4167] Definite terms:
[4168] For the purpose of indicating lineage, Tantra,
[4169] Making whatever lineages arise—thus Tantra,
[4170] Definite and unbroken middle, continuous—thus Tantra.
[4171] Divided: the Tantra of meaning and nature,
[4172] The Tantra of indicating words, two:
[4173] The Tantra of meaning:
[4174] Mind itself, naturally clear light, free from the stains of thought,
[4175] Always abiding in all, thus Tantra,
[4176] Being the lineage of Buddha, thus from Tantra,
[4177] Holding the characteristic of Buddha, thus placed in Tantra.
[4178] The Tantra of words:
[4179] That same indicating basis—name, word, letter's nature, chapter, etc.—divided,
[4180] The chief method of the creation sequence,
[4181] The chief discerning of the completion sequence,
[4182] Both equal parts: the non-dual union,
[4183] Showing beyond all: the key points of Great Perfection.
[4184] The rising measure: chief of the great creation sequence, ten:
[4185] First: basis empowerment and samaya—two,
[4186] Deity and mantra—two,
[4187] Maṇḍala and offering—two,
[4188] Samādhi and conduct—two,
[4189] Activity and view—two. Ten complete: the chief Tantra of the creation sequence.
[4190] The rising measure of the completion sequence:
[4191] View and fruition—two,
[4192] Conduct and meditation—two,
[4193] Mind and wisdom—two,
[4194] Experience and instruction—two. Eight complete: the chief rising measure of the completion sequence.
[4195] The non-dual union:
[4196] Both must complete—eighteen.
[4197] The completely perfect Great:
[4198] From creation and completion, the completion sequence.
[4199] The completion sequence: showing the sequence of channels, winds, and bindu with small elaboration,
[4200] Showing the sequence of great clear light wisdom—two.
[4201] Great—that entering the rising measure through the door of empowerment and samaya—two,
[4202] Path and enumeration—two,
[4203] Fruition and five complete.
[4204] Examples: like the warp,
[4205] Depending on many threads of cause, rolling like cloth,
[4206] Depending on different words, extracting one meaning.
[4207] Valid: Tantra dwelling in self, indicating, thus
[4208] Valid as Tantra.
[4209] That also, depending on the key of words, bringing meaning's basis to certainty without error, making it realized, thus placed in Tantra.
[4210] Second, extensively explaining that nature: two.
[4211] Meaning Tantra and word Tantra extensively explained.
[4212] First: two,
[4213] Method Tantra,
[4214] Nature Tantra.
[4215] First:
[4216] Awareness and that meaning's experience-taking instructions.
[4217] Divided: indicated method Tantra,
[4218] Indicating method Tantra, two.
[4219] First, nature:
[4220] Awareness pervading all beings, the mind of enlightenment.
[4221] Definite term: that same indicating meaning and realizing basis and liberating method, thus
[4222] Called indicated method Tantra.
[4223] Divided:
[4224] Emptiness,
[4225] Clarity, two.
[4226] Emptiness: awareness's nature, all empty of things and marked dharmas, primordially dwelling in great liberation from elaboration's end.
[4227] Clarity:
[4228] That too, not gone to the extreme of emptiness, self-illuminating Five Wisdoms' appearance,
[4229] Warm, cool, light,
[4230] Vast nature's chief great elements five, primordially spontaneously accomplished,
[4231] Compassion's tone unceasing, arising as capacity, awareness primordially pervading.
[4232] That too, awareness clear-empty great wisdom pervading all beings,
[4233] Called indicated method Tantra.
[4234] From the Pearl Garland:
[4235] All buddhas' method Tantra,
[4236] From the distinction of one basis nature,
[4237] Indicated and indicating,
[4238] Indicated Tantra, one, all-pervading,
[4239] All that connected to its trace,
[4240] Pervading aspects two:
[4241] Pervading by emptiness, pervading by clarity,
[4242] One cause of emptiness, without thing,
[4243] Beyond all things' Dharma,
[4244] Things empty, without appearance, one-pervading,
[4245] Becoming the basis of all, one nature,
[4246] Pervading lord itself gathered,
[4247] Birthless, memory exhausted,
[4248] From the distinction of nature itself,
[4249] Empty and appearing, appearing and empty,
[4250] Things, without things, also are,
[4251] Exhausted, primordially dwelling in emptiness,
[4252] Cause and condition separated, emptiness's object,
[4253] Pervading vast, without thing, empty by nature,
[4254] Without stain, unmixed, perfect,
[4255] Thoughtless, empty nature,
[4256] Pervading by emptiness, thus called Tantra.
[4257] Clear, nature unceasing,
[4258] Illuminating appearance, all-pervading,
[4259] Clear, warm, cool,
[4260] Vast, moving, nature holding,
[4261] Pervading, primordial tone, self-clear,
[4262] Liberating, ripening seed,
[4263] Reverse from emptiness, clear pervading,
[4264] Instant, self-liberation,
[4265] Self-arising clarity, body connected,
[4266] Without stain, particularly clear,
[4267] Graspless, clear object appearing,
[4268] Five doors' knowledge, self-clear, perfect,
[4269] Body clear pervading, thus called Tantra.
[4270] Thus.
[4271] Second, indicating method Tantra: three.
[4272] Nature:
[4273] The instruction of indicated meaning, awareness, realizing method.
[4274] Definite term:
[4275] Self-dwelling awareness's wisdom indicating,
[4276] As realizing method, gathering the key of experience, shown in one direction—thus called indicating method Tantra.
[4277] Generally, explanation tantras: words long, difficult,
[4278] Instruction tantras: words clear, easy,
[4279] Great Perfection tantras are called instruction tantras.
[4280] Divided:
[4281] Showing effortless primordial liberation,
[4282] Showing with effort through sequence, two.
[4283] First:
[4284] Cutting through the basis,
[4285] The sequence of instant faculties,
[4286] Primordially liberated, again without basis, etcetera.
[4287] Second: the path of leaping over, the gradual faculties, relying on the key of channels and winds, making liberation,
[4288] Three preliminaries, bringing to natural place, directly bringing to the self-key, until,
[4289] Body key,
[4290] Door key,
[4291] Object key,
[4292] Relying on the key of wind and awareness, taking experience,
[4293] Going to the measure of four appearances, showing liberation.
[4294] Also from that same:
[4295] Those directly realizing,
[4296] Called method—also distinction.
[4297] Person's intellect's difference,
[4298] How the sequence must be explained,
[4299] Without effort and striving, self-liberation,
[4300] With effort, experience must be taken.
[4301] Effortless ones are self-pure.
[4302] Key: through three aspects,
[4303] That meaning: taking experience,
[4304] Body, door, object.
[4305] Body's key: these three,
[4306] Lion's manner, elephant's manner,
[4307] Like a rishi, must be known.
[4308] Door: that same, unmoved,
[4309] Clarifying two, unmoved,
[4310] Sky itself unmoved.
[4311] Object's key: three aspects,
[4312] Pure expanse, dwelling,
[4313] Thus awareness's nature, dwelling,
[4314] All appearances, dwelling.
[4315] Mind changeless, self-abiding,
[4316] Mind changeless, memory clear,
[4317] Awareness unchanging, Three Bodies clear,
[4318] Mind, mind, slow—memory stream ceases.
[4319] Body and speech slack, free from suffering.
[4320] Awareness slack, five bodies arise.
[4321] Awareness arisen, conditions cease.
[4322] Expanse-awareness arisen, realm and mind cease.
[4323] Thus indicated method's Tantra.
[4324] Self's Tantra, unproduced and perfected.
[4325] Indicating, thus method is.
[4326] Dwelling in the stream, thus called Tantra.
[4327] Thus.
[4328] Second, nature's Tantra:
[4329] The meaning of basis, path, and fruition.
[4330] From that same:
[4331] Basis, path, fruition,
[4332] Determined holding, nature's Tantra.
[4333] Thus.
[4334] This essence:
[4335] Empty-clear awareness's essence, basis, path, and fruition gathered.
[4336] Definite term: pervading all, accomplishing Buddha-nature, thus called nature's Tantra.
[4337] Divided:
[4338] Basis,
[4339] Essence,
[4340] Quintessence nature's Tantra—three.
[4341] Basis nature's Tantra: the first ka-dag awareness, nature, compassion—three.
[4342] That too: essence primordially pure, non-awareness's name non-existent,
[4343] Delusion imputed only, not experienced,
[4344] Nature spontaneously accomplished, awareness light-clear,
[4345] Compassion all-pervading, manifesting, unceasing,
[4346] Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, whatever arises, dwelling in expanse.
[4347] Essence nature's Tantra:
[4348] Primordial wisdom three-stacked, in the heart-essence manner, arisen—basis nature's Tantra, that power, basis appearance, eye, four lamps arisen,
[4349] The path's four appearances actually seen.
[4350] Quintessence nature's Tantra:
[4351] Awareness's appearance, taking experience, fruition ripened.
[4352] That too: essence empty, marks awareness non-gone,
[4353] Permanent extreme-grasping non-existent, substantial entity non-established,
[4354] Empty self-appearance arisen, cut, cut-off non-existent,
[4355] Empty-clear, indivisible—that awareness's quintessence,
[4356] That too: measured, ripened, quintessence gathered, thus called.
[4357] Clarity three and
[4358] V. CLEARING, STABILITY, APPEARANCE, AND EMPTYING
[4359] 4358. Clear three, etcetera: Three Kāyas, phenomena of path-appearance that have reached their end.
[4360] 4359. Knowledge, directionless: clear—so not emptiness cut off.
[4361] 4360. Entity, markless: clear—so not gradual.
[4362] 4361. Self-aware ultimate: those three are indivisible.
[4363] 4362. Permanent and cut, liberated from the four extremes: the mind of the indivisibility of body and primordial wisdom—thus called.
[4364] Now the three clear aspects:
[4365] 4364. When outer realms appear,
[4366] 4365. awareness appears kāya-clear, dimension color-clear.
[4367] 4366. Sky, dimension-awareness, appear indivisible.
[4368] Now the three stabilities:
[4369] 4368. Thus arisen, faith: the stability of view.
[4370] 4369. Nose-held: the stability of realm.
[4371] 4370. Delusion ceased: the stability of decision.
[4372] Now the three non-returns:
[4373] 4372. When samsara itself is known as primordially Buddha,
[4374] 4373. awareness has no continuum—so no return.
[4375] 4374. Awareness kāya appears manifestly; delusion-appearances fall into pure-appearances—so appearances do not return.
[4376] 4375. Dharmatā appears as manifold.
[4377] 4376. That: realization's confidence gained—so no return.
[4378] Now the three appearances:
[4379] 4378. Dimension: appearance without day or night.
[4380] 4379. Awareness: appearance without clear-dimming.
[4381] 4380. Dharmatā: appearance without transformation.
[4382] 4381. Thus liberated: delusion's appearances, self-pure, have no cause for samsara.
[4383] 4382. That very purity of appearance, self-arisen, conditions of samsara cease of themselves.
[4384] 4383. Even offering here, dharmatā's appearance in the intermediate state is decided—samsara's result dissolves of itself.
[4385] Now the three emptinesses:
[4386] 4384. At that time:
[4387] 4385. Awareness without comparison—delusion emptied.
[4388] 4386. Mind without conditions—conceptual stains emptied.
[4389] 4387. Light without coming-and-going—elements' conditions emptied.
[4390] 4388. Thus, basis, essence, flower-Tantra: shown individually even.
[4391] 4389. Only a matter of reversal distinction; one essential nature.
[4392] 4390. How these three tantras proceed:  4391. As for what is shown as the basis-Tantra regarding reality's actual state:  4392. Buddha and all sentient beings arise from that—so the outer Tantra or the basis-Tantra is established.
[4393] 4393. Realizing: entered the Buddha's Tantra.
[4394] 4394. Not-realizing: entered the sentient beings' Tantra. Since that Tantra itself is made the basis, the basis-Tantra is established.
[4395] 4395. The method-Tantra too is this portion.
[4396] 4396. That meaning itself is the basis for indication, so what is indicated becomes the method-Tantra.
[4397] 4397. Without basis-awareness as support, there are no Buddhas or sentient beings whatsoever.
[4398] 4398. Those two who hold their tantras—regarding the Tantra—
[4399] 4399. That itself understood through entering: meaning realized—that is its purpose.
[4400] 4400. Realized and liberated—that is its innermost result and fruit.
