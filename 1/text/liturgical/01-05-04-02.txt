[6420] At the third, the thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector, and

The third emanation in the sequence of seven primordial teachers appears during the third teaching epoch. Designated as the Yama-world-protector (gshin rje 'jig rten skyong), this Buddha emerges specifically among the thousand Brahmas, representing the divine governing principle that protects the realm of Yama—the lord of death and impermanence.

According to the Great Arrangement (mahāvyūha) teachings recorded in the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra:

"At the third teaching,
The thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector,
The thousand Buddhas' very heart essence rolled."

This emanation holds particular significance as the "heart essence rolled" (thugs kyi snying po bsdus), indicating that within this third epoch, the essential wisdom of the thousand Buddhas becomes concentrated and embodied in this specific manifestation. The reference to "thousand Brahmas" suggests a cosmological context where this Buddha's activity extends throughout the Brahma-worlds, the highest realms of form in traditional Buddhist cosmology.

The Yama-world-protector's role extends beyond mere guardianship—this emanation actively teaches beings about the nature of impermanence and the transcendence of death, transforming the fearful realm of Yama into a field of liberation. Through this emanation, the secret essence (gsang ba'i snying po) of all Buddhas becomes accessible to practitioners traversing the path of Atiyoga.
