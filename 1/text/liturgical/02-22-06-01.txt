<ornament> [11825] First, the sign of birth in hell:

[11826] At the time of death, the sky gathers with black clouds,

[11827] And one proceeds as if darkness were spreading.

[11828] When rain,

[11829] Mist,

[11830] Great wind,

[11831] Hail, and

[11832] Dust-whirlwinds swirl, one takes birth among the eight hot hells,

[11833] The eight cold hells,

[11834] The intermittent hells,

[11835] The neighboring hells,

[11836] The sentient-being hell Avīci, and

[11837] The seven vajra hells.

[11838] The latter two, although included in the category of the eight hot hells, are distinguished separately due to their long lifespans and great suffering.

[11839] Moreover, by the karma of immediate actions and so forth, all who take birth in the last of the hot hells dwell for one intermediate kalpa, while those who have abandoned the Dharma remain for billions of hundreds of thousands of kalpas longer—hence it is called the Unbearable Sentient-Being Hell. As proclaimed in the Noble Sūtra of the Transcendence of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines:

[11840] Through the ripening of the karma of abandoning Dharma,

[11841] One takes birth in the great unbearable sentient-being hell,

[11842] Experiencing unbearable suffering.

[11843] Even when the great fire-gathering kalpa arises there,

[11844] One takes birth where the great sentient-being hell exists

[11845] In the eastern worlds—thus it is proclaimed

[11846] To extend throughout the ten directions, limitless and boundless.

[11847] Therefore, having entered the gate of Secret Mantra, breaking great samaya with the vajra guru produces long lifespans and great suffering. From the Supreme Samaya Arrangement, the Tree Tantra:

<tantra> [11848] Whoever toward the vajra guru
<verse> [11849] Bears evil mind, derides,
<verse> [11850] Great samaya-breaking—
<verse> [11851] As long as from the great ocean || 50 ||
<verse> [11852] The water is exhausted drop by drop,
<verse> [11853] Strand by strand of hair,
<verse> [11854] That water poured out exhausted—
<verse> [11855] For that many ocean-kalpas
<verse> [11856] One will dwell,
<verse> [11857] Known as the vajra hell.
<verse> [11858] Thus it is spoken.

[11859] Second, the sign of birth as a hungry ghost:

[11860] At the time of death, the sky becomes unclear, rays fade like the western sunset;

[11861] Sun and moon "die";

[11862] Yellow clouds obscure, sun and moon invisible;

[11863] Rain falls with cold traces;

[11864] Or in the evening, rain falls—

[11865] These are for hungry ghosts with outer obscuration,

[11866] Inner obscuration,

[11867] Sudden obscuration,

[11868] Distinctive obscuration,

[11869] Inverted obscuration, and

[11870] Karma and karmic-category obscuration—

[11871] In these, one takes birth.

[11872] Third, the sign of animals:

[11873] At the time of life-transference, the sky is gloomy with warmth without oiliness, black clouds gather,

[11874] Or fog banks obscure,

[11875] Smoke-form valleys appear blue-gray and one proceeds,

[11876] Gloomy, joyless sky appearing—one takes birth among creeping creatures with many legs,

[11877] Without legs,

[11878] Four-legged,

[11879] Winged, and

[11880] Clawed, and so forth.

[11881] Fourth, the sign of birth as a demigod:

[11882] At the time of death, strong wind rises from all directions,

[11883] Black clouds like terrifying creatures appear,

[11884] Clouds greatly disturbed, fierce thunder, lightning garlands flash, roaring sounds—

[11885] Sun and moon's light cloud-obscured,

[11886] Demigods with five projections,

[11887] Six faces,

[11888] Long arms,

[11889] Great belly-serpent, and

[11890] Sky-going long-haired—five take birth.

[11891] Fifth, the sign of birth as a god:

[11892] At the time of separating from breath,

[11893] The sky is clear, sun and moon clear, without yellow wind, directions beautiful, greatly joyful—

[11894] This is for desire realm gods of six races,

[11895] Pure realm five,

[11896] Clear light fifteen, and

[11897] Formless four—sign of taking birth-place.

[11898] Sixth, the sign of birth as a human:

[11899] At the time of death, the sky extremely clear and pure, without yellow dust,

[11900] Soft white clouds like stretched silk,

[11901] Sun and moon with rainbow light—

[11902] In sequence:

[11903] Merely human body,

[11904] Pure,

[11905] Jewel birth-place—sign of birth.

[11906] These are the general arrangements.

[11907] When examined specifically,

[11908] Bad—wind and

[11909] Hail etcetera, sent by angry non-humans, or

[11910] Other evil persons dying—these signs may also be possible.

[11911] Good—rainbow light and clear sky etcetera, may also be possible for excellent persons transferring to fields, achieving samādhi, life-transference, and so forth.

[11912] Achieving samādhi,

[11913] Life-transference, and so forth—

[11914] Here, possessing the power for signs to arise in one's own mind,

[11915] While alive, good mind and conduct; at death, good signs of that race—

[11916] While alive, bad, even if good signs—other's signs arising,

[11917] In the world called "meeting the rainbow seeker."

[11918] From that one's following, learning might arise; therefore these are explained for turning back.

<tantra> [11919] As proclaimed in the Blazing Relics Signs Tantra:
<verse> [11920] Thus for all sentient beings, || 180 ||
<verse> [11921] When the life-formations are enacted,
<verse> [11922] By the sky's own characteristic
<verse> [11923] All these exercise in birth-places.
<verse> [11924] Whoever dies, at that time
<verse> [11925] The sky turns gloomy-black, darkness black,
<verse> [11926] Likewise rain and steam and wind,
<verse> [11927] Hail and dust-whirlwinds arise—
<verse> [11928] To whoever these befall,
<verse> [11929] Without intermediate state,
<verse> [11930] They become in hell's birth-place, || 190 ||
<verse> [11931] O Ḍākinī.
<verse> [11932] Sky like mist, light yellow,
<verse> [11933] Sun and moon die,
<verse> [11934] Without wind and dust,
<verse> [11935] Yellow mist, sun not visible,
<verse> [11936] Rain or traces, or at twilight
<verse> [11937] These will fall—thus to whoever
<verse> [11938] These befall, in hungry ghost
<verse> [11939] Birth-place they are born, O Ḍākinī.
<verse> [11940] Sky gloomy without wind, || 200 ||
<verse> [11941] Clouds black without gaps,
<verse> [11942] Or mist appears,
<verse> [11943] Gloomy joyless—whoever
<verse> [11944] Does the life-formation,
<verse> [11945] This is the animal place.
<verse> [11946] Greatly fierce, disturbed by wind,
<verse> [11947] Clouds black-massed, fearful forms,
<verse> [11948] Greatly disturbed with coming-going,
<verse> [11949] Thunder and lightning's tongue protrude,
<verse> [11950] Sun and moon unable to be seen— || 210 ||
<verse> [11951] Thus to whoever these befall,
<verse> [11952] This is the asura birth-place.
<verse> [11953] Sky clear and pure,
<verse> [11954] Sun and moon's appearance clear,
<verse> [11955] Wind and dust unable to rise,
<verse> [11956] This is the god's birth-place.
<verse> [11957] Also in clear pure sky,
<verse> [11958] Undivided clouds like white silk,
<verse> [11959] Greatly thin, thread-like appear,
<verse> [11960] Or sun and moon with light-housed— || 220 ||
<verse> [11961] Thus to whoever these befall,
<verse> [11962] This human birth-place is obtained.
<verse> [11963] Thus whoever possesses signs,
<verse> [11964] Is certainly of the six races;
<verse> [11965] Formations without such signs
<verse> [11966] Are signless and uncertain.
<verse> [11967] Thus all those signs
<verse> [11968] Come from two to three days,
<verse> [11969] These are signs of birth there
<verse> [11970] In that birth-place—thus proclaimed. || 230 ||

[11971] Even those who die without signs—where they take birth is known by their own karma.

[11972] Yet at the time of death, the appearance of hell-fire,

[11973] The appearance of hunger, thirst, and fear,

[11974] Consciousness becoming gloomy, or thinking one dwells among animals,

[11975] Or not seeing lands of humans before, || 240 ||

[11976] Or the experience inside Meru or inside the ocean,

[11977] Or appearances of seeing inside divine mansions or pleasure groves,

[11978] Or seeing appearances like white clarity—these are explained in the sūtras as inner signs certain for individual six realms.

[11979] Also from the tantra sections:

[11980] Warmth from the soles of the feet, || 250 ||

[11981] Teeth,

[11982] Navel, and

[11983] Throat,

[11984] Between the eyebrows,

[11985] And dissolving from the crown are said to be signs of taking birthplaces of the six realms. || 260 ||

[11986] Also, though signs that have arisen appear in agreement with one's own mind, they should be known as certain signs of individual birthplaces.

<tantra> [11987] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
<verse> [11988] The certain establishment of the arrangement of signs of the three times—the twenty-second chapter.
<verse> [11989] Thus having shown the sequence of signs, the method of liberation in this life for those of excellent faculties, effort, and places of the general instruction,
<verse> [11990] Now, for establishing extensively the Dharma arrangement of completely perfect buddhahood in the bardo for those of medium faculties, there are two:
<verse> [11991] The general establishment of the intermediate state and
<verse> [11992] The extensive explanation of individual natures.
<verse> [11993] First, regarding the essence of the intermediate state: || 270 ||
<verse> [11994] Definition,
<verse> [11995] Division,
<verse> [11996] Appearance pattern,
<verse> [11997] And ground boundary—five aspects.

[11998] Thus have been extensively shown the arrangement of signs of the three times.
[11999] <verse> Definition,
[12000] <verse> Division,
[12001] <verse> Appearance pattern,
[12002] <verse> And ground boundary—four aspects. || 280 ||
