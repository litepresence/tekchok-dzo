[19657] <prose>First: regarding characteristic, from two aspects.</prose>
[19658] <prose>The general characteristic—showing pristine cognition's self-appearance, connecting light-clear mother-son, opening samsara-nirvana's two boundaries.</prose>
[19659] <tantra>From the Thalgyur:</tantra>
[19660] <verse>The lamp's characteristic is thus:</verse>
[19661] <verse>Generally showing appearances,</verse>
[19662] <verse>Connecting pristine cognition mother-son,</verse>
[19663] <verse>Joining samsara-nirvana's two boundaries.</verse>
[19664] <verse>Through self-radiance clarity to light-body,</verse>
[19665] <verse>Concept-free pristine cognition gathers.</verse>
[19666] <verse>To concept-possessing object-appearances,</verse>
[19667] <verse>Non-concept pristine cognition does not hold basis.</verse>
[19668] <prose>Thus it is proclaimed.</prose> || 10 ||
[19669] <prose>The particular characteristic: first of four—Distant-Water is the gathering of elements-four's essence, whatever thing, holding object-form's two parts, become the door of increasing appearance.</prose>
[19670] <tantra>From the Thalgyur:</tantra>
[19671] <verse>Distant-Water lamp's characteristic:</verse>
[19672] <verse>Pervading enters, entering pervades.</verse>
[19673] <verse>Elements four remain as self-maker.</verse>
[19674] <verse>Holding, entering, increasing, and doing.</verse>
[19675] <prose>Thus it is proclaimed.</prose>
[19676] <prose>Self-arisen wisdom's characteristic: from outer radiance, inner arising, mind's realization, remaining in pure dharmata-intention, transcending samsara-nirvana.</prose>
[19677] <prose>From that same source:</prose>
[19678] <verse>Pure wisdom's characteristic:</verse>
[19679] <verse>Clear word-entering gathers basis,</verse>
[19680] <verse>Burns afflictions, karma, and latencies,</verse>
[19681] <verse>Ripening-doer cuts samsara-nirvana's life.</verse>
[19682] <prose>Thus it is proclaimed.</prose> || 20 ||
[19683] <prose>Moreover, basis-appearing to sense-power, arising in that state: body and pristine cognition.</prose>
[19684] <prose>The result ripening as final ka-dag space application.</prose>
[19685] <prose>Wisdom-lamp is great.</prose>
[19686] <prose>Ground itself: result-ripening cause wisdom.</prose>
[19687] <verse>That dharma-body of nature-itself,</verse>
[19688] <verse>Through ripening as knowing-body,</verse>
[19689] <verse>Pristine cognition's dharma-body ripens.</verse>
[19690] <verse>Through that, pristine cognition continuum unbroken,</verse>
[19691] <verse>Body and pristine cognition spontaneously accomplished clear.</verse>
[19692] <prose>Thus spoke the Blazing Lamp.</prose>
[19693] <prose>The bindu-lamp's characteristic is:</prose>
[19694] <prose>Round, compact, red-clear, appearing in the eye, supporting pristine cognition arising.</prose>
[19695] <prose>Previous:</prose>
[19696] <verse>Bindu-empty characteristic:</verse> || 30 ||
[19697] <verse>Round, nature all-clear,</verse>
[19698] <verse>Red-clear, color-clear light,</verse>
[19699] <verse>With elaboration, causes spreading.</verse>
[19700] <prose>Thus it is proclaimed.</prose>
[19701] <prose>The space-lamp's characteristic: from blue-green pervading great light, spreading aspect-five, from eye's two corners self-clear arising, becoming body's arising-ground.</prose>
[19702] <tantra>From the Thalgyur:</tantra>
[19703] <verse>Space-itself pure characteristic:</verse>
[19704] <verse>Blue-green self-complete, two portions,</verse>
[19705] <verse>Method and wisdom complete,</verse>
[19706] <verse>From two corners' portions, holding two bodies.</verse>
[19707] <verse>Causes extremely appearing spreading.</verse>
[19708] <verse>These all also self-know complete.</verse>
[19709] <verse>Pervading-lord being's form shows.</verse>
[19710] <verse>Chain-link rope pulls.</verse>
[19711] <verse>Mandala-complete form similar.</verse>
[19712] <verse>All pristine cognition's ground-luster shows.</verse> || 40 ||
[19713] <verse>Light-depth luster shine also shows.</verse>
[19714] <verse>Body and bindu gathering-place.</verse>
[19715] <verse>Thus, pristine cognition-complete body—</verse>
[19716] <verse>This: who sees Buddha.</verse>
[19717] <verse>Three bodies liberated at exhaustion-ground's nature.</verse>
[19718] <verse>After crossing grasp-hold precipice,</verse>
[19719] <verse>Samsara-nirvana's limit-rope cut.</verse>
[19720] <prose>Thus it is proclaimed.</prose>
[19721] <prose>These two outer lamps: secret great vajra fortress, body and pristine cognition's source.</prose>
[19722] <tantra>From the Jewel-Spread Great Tantra:</tantra>
[19723] <verse>Bindu-empty lamp</verse>
[19724] <verse>And self-arisen space-lamp two—</verse>
[19725] <verse>Empty and non-empty, extreme-transcended,</verse>
[19726] <verse>Effort-non-existent, manifest abiding.</verse>
[19727] <verse>Appearance-complete, therefore self-abiding.</verse>
[19728] <verse>Dharmata non-separate, space-transcended.</verse>
[19729] <verse>Awareness, pristine cognition-body possessed.</verse>
[19730] <verse>Self-appearance light-mandala vast,</verse> || 50 ||
[19731] <verse>Grasping-attachment-free self-appearance object.</verse>
[19732] <verse>Dharma-thought completely abandoned.</verse>
[19733] <verse>Fortress vajra-palace built.</verse>
[19734] <verse>What: non-destroyed great vajra.</verse>
[19735] <verse>Vajra-palace: birth and destruction non-existent.</verse>
[19736] <verse>Empty, from thing-object separate.</verse>
[19737] <verse>Direction-non-existent, completely pure.</verse>
[19738] <verse>Ultimate-conventional two: non-existent.</verse>
[19739] <verse>Meaning: self-awareness.</verse>
[19740] <verse>Sign: manifest body with.</verse> || 60 ||
[19741] <verse>Clear, sharp, spontaneous, thick, light-ray blazing.</verse>
[19742] <prose>Thus it is proclaimed.</prose>
[19743] <prose>Second: regarding object, from two aspects.</prose>
[19744] <list>General object: outer space cloud-free,</list>
[19745] <list>inner reality self-essence,</list>
[19746] <list>between: increasing appearance light-clear.</list>
[19747] <tantra>From the Thalgyur:</tantra>
[19748] <verse>This object essential-point is thus:</verse>
[19749] <verse>Cloud-free outer object empty,</verse>
[19750] <verse>Yogin remains in space's bird-path.</verse>
[19751] <verse>Not free from this: reality.</verse>
[19752] <verse>Generally: individual characteristics.</verse>
[19753] <verse>Object different, one-complete essential-point.</verse>
[19754] <verse>Pristine cognition gathering ceases mind-continuum.</verse>
[19755] <verse>Elements gathering completes body.</verse>
[19756] <verse>From distinctive great appearances,</verse> || 70 ||
[19757] <verse>Remain as ripening-entering-moving's object.</verse>
[19758] <verse>Concept extreme exhausted: liberated from samsara.</verse>
[19759] <prose>Thus it is proclaimed.</prose>
[19760] <prose>Second: regarding particular object, from four aspects.</prose>
[19761] <prose>Distant-Water's object: light-appearance's empty-forms, intertwined held, gate unmoved, awareness emanates-gathers without establishing essential-point.</prose>
[19762] <prose>From that same source:</prose>
[19763] <verse>Distant-Water object: form, etc.,</verse>
[19764] <verse>Gathers and holds, projects, does.</verse>
[19765] <verse>Essential-point binds and places.</verse>
[19766] <verse>Thing transforms and root cuts.</verse>
[19767] <verse>Draws and form should be trained.</verse>
[19768] <prose>Thus it is proclaimed.</prose>
[19769] <prose>Moreover, light-clear, lamp, etc.—all important essential-points gather at the eye.</prose>
[19770] <prose>Gate unmoved and gaze-fixing is essential.</prose>
[19771] <tantra>From the Norbu Phra-khod:</tantra>
[19772] <prose>Son of noble family, knowing awareness's thatness, eye's thusness, resting-view: if known, all dharmas' general and particular become known—thus it is said.</prose>
[19773] <tantra>From the Yul Bar-ma:</tantra>
[19774] <prose>Knowing eye's thusness, all dharmas' brief and extensive become known—thus it is proclaimed.</prose> || 80 ||
[19775] <prose>Why?</prose>
[19776] <prose>From that: vajra-intertwined body and pristine cognition's radiance, together with confusion-appearance, transforming to light-clear.</prose>
[19777] <prose>From reality's exhaustion, joining original sphere's reason.</prose>
[19778] <tantra>From the Blazing Lamp:</tantra>
[19779] <verse>Kye-ma! Spiritual daughter, eye's thatness-essence shown as vajra-body intertwined—</verse>
[19780] <verse>Eye's thusness, bodies-three non-separated meaning: awareness self-clear, unmodified intention: wise ones should look.</verse>
[19781] <verse>Distant-Water lamp: true Buddha, awareness intertwined-body clear.</verse>
[19782] <verse>That also: sphere and awareness, gathering-separation-without, remain.</verse>
[19783] <verse>Meaning unobscured, self-appearing.</verse>
[19784] <verse>That nature of eye's thatness should be grasped.</verse>
[19785] <verse>That time: awareness-appearance's essence, together with that, should recall awareness resting-view.</verse>
[19786] <verse>That awareness: from aware-manner's thing, unmoved.</verse>
[19787] <verse>Also that: eye's corner should look.</verse>
[19788] <prose>Thus it is proclaimed.</prose> || 90 ||
[19789] <prose>Second: regarding wisdom-lamp's object—word-meaning: should cut with realization-confidence.</prose>
[19790] <tantra>From the Thalgyur:</tantra>

[19831] <prose>Thus it is proclaimed.</prose>
[19832] <prose>Third: regarding basis, from two aspects.</prose>
[19833] <prose>Lamp-general's basis: supporting samsara's liberation into space.</prose>
[19834] <tantra>From the Thalgyur:</tantra>
[19835] <verse>Pristine cognition pure lamp's basis:</verse>

[19847] <prose>Wisdom's basis: word-meaning supported.</prose>
[19848] <tantra>From the Thalgyur:</tantra>
[19849] <verse>Self-arisen wisdom's basis-place:</verse>

[19867] <prose>Thus it is proclaimed.</prose> || 130 ||
[19868] <prose>Fourth: the distinctive aspect of basis and object.</prose>
[19869] <prose>This-way: lamp, etc., possessed dharma-qualities, basis and supported established.</prose>
[19870] <prose>That-way: that appearance's arising-place is object—difference exists.</prose>
[19871] <prose>Basis-place, supported dharma, supported manner: three gathering is basis.</prose>
