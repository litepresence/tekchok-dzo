[5269] Now explained the sequence of long and short, heavy and light.
[5270] The first is this:
[5271] In whatever Tantra, however letters of mantra may appear, whether stacked or single,
[5272] The inverted letters are placed wherever appropriate at the root,
[5273] And whatever prefix has arisen, the inverted [letter] is joined to the palate at the tip of the tongue, expressed directly without inversion, as it is called.
[5274] Like ṬA to TA, and so forth.
[5275] The branches are also joined appropriately to the mother [letter] and expressed.
[5276] These are read combined together as one life-force and kindred class,
[5277] Like K+KA,
[5278] Like K+AÜ.
[5279] Not as single [letters] but each separately expressed,
[5280] Like G+HAJA and so forth.
[5281] This also [comes] from Rigpa Rangdrol:
[5282] The letters' mantra are thus:
[5283] The inverted, the prefix, and the branches
[5284] Are all expressed here as they are,
[5285] And each is pronounced as appropriate.
[5286] The inverted [letter] is tagged and becomes manifest.
[5287] The mother herself is placed as basis.
[5288] The branches are nirvāṇa letters.
[5289] The prefix is only saṃsāra.
[5290] Thus mantras and letters, each is pronounced as appropriate. Thus it is spoken.
[5291] This also [comes] from Rangshar:
[5292] The non-saṃsāric is explained,
[5293] The prefix and branches are nirvāṇa's letters explained. From Rigpa Rangdrol, the mother is not placed as basis: the prefix is saṃsāra and the branches are nirvāṇa—these two explanations are not contradictory but are understood according to context.
[5294] At that time, when saṃsāra's sentient beings are pervaded by the Buddha's essence, and sentient beings are taken as basis, the letters' mother is made saṃsāric, so the prefix and branches are understood as saṃsāra.
[5295] When the nature of awareness separates saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in the manner of distinction and completeness, that mother is shown as awareness and placed as basis: the prefix is explained as saṃsāra and the branches are expressed as the dharmas of nirvāṇa.
[5296] In their nature they are always joined together, for they are designations without inherent existence. When impure saṃsāra is indicated, the root letter is taken as the mind of pride.
[5309] The prefix and branch above [the letter] exist as karma and afflictions, aggregates and elements, sense-fields and elements, grasping and so forth—and are also explained thus.
[5310] When pure nirvāṇa is explained, that mother letter is self-arisen wisdom, and the prefix and branch are also explained as the Three Kāyas, Five Wisdoms, five lights, and ten powers.
[5311] When saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are both explained on one basis, that mother letter is awareness itself, and the prefix and branch are explained as the dharmas of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
[5312] When the basis is explained, that mother letter is awareness, and the prefix and branch are also explained as the essential nature, compassion, and the five winds.
[5313] When the path is explained, that mother letter is the basis-nature, the essence of the heart, which is the nature of the threefold compassion; and the prefix and branch are also explained as the four lamps of basis-appearance and the four appearances.
[5314] When the result is explained, that mother letter is the Buddha's mind, self-arisen wisdom and branch are also; and the prefix explained as the kāyas, wisdoms, qualities, and activities.
[5315] In brief, whatever meaning is shown, the chief one is the mother letter at that time of explanation, and its retinue—the prefix and branch—should be explained.
[5316] The second, the sequence of long-short and heavy-light, is explained as follows, from Rigpa Rangdrol:
[5317] Sound is shown in four aspects: long, short, very long, and great. Thus the basis's sound is called.
[5318] The short is one letter; when expressed, it is recited for the duration of one expression.
[5319] The long equals two; depending on the occasion, it may be class-concordant, or when life-force is concordant even if class-discordant, there are stacked [letters] and those having a long portion.
[5320] The great is very long, arising for approximately the duration of three.
[5321] The basis's sound is the expanse of letters, namely the mother, branch, and prefix together. Those, when life-force is concordant, are recited as one.
[5345] When not concordant, they are recited separately.
[5346] Also, on some occasions, the short [letters] with prefix and branch, and single [letters] without any long portion, are expressed.
[5347] The "long" refers to those having the long portion of A.
[5348] The "great" refers to K+KA and similar class-concordant stacked [combinations].
[5349] The basis's sound: KA with CA suffix, and so forth—these thick [letters] are renowned.
[5350] When joined with the musician, the duration of letters is counted as before; thus it should be known in Tibetan usage.
[5351] Joined with the Tantra's own text, depending on purity and state, it is joined as below and explained accordingly.
[5352] The definite heavy-light and long-short of these: the thick ones are heavy, the short ones are light.
[5353] The abodes are divided individually:
[5354] From Rigpa Rangdrol:
[5355] The long and short sounds are shown as follows:
[5356] AA+A stacked—long;
[5357] KA+KA tagged—long;
[5358] BA+BA tagged—great;
[5359] JA+JA tagged—thick;
[5360] NYA+NYA tagged—long;
[5361] SA+SA tagged—short;
[5362] YA+YA tagged—great;
[5363] MA+MA tagged—thick;
[5364] GA+GA tagged—long;
[5365] TSA+TSA tagged—short;
[5366] HA+HA tagged—great;
[5367] THA+CA tagged—thick;
[5368] KHA+KHA tagged—long;
[5369] NGA+NGA tagged—short;
[5370] PA+BA tagged—great;
[5371] THA+THA tagged—thick.
[5372] These and other letters, the joined meanings of syllables should be known.
[5373] These are arranged as follows:
[5374] KA+CA tagged—thick;
[5375] THA+NA tagged—thick;
[5376] JA+BA tagged—thick;
[5377] MA+SHA tagged—thick;
[5378] BA+A tagged—thick;
[5379] NA+TA tagged—thick.
[5380] These are the thick [letters].
[5381] The long letters are:
[5382] YA+NGA tagged—long;
[5383] GA+HA tagged—long;
[5384] THA+DA tagged—long;
[5385] A+KHA tagged—long;
[5386] TA+NA tagged—long;
[5387] SHA+ZHA tagged—long.
[5388] These are the long [letters].
[5389] These are the great [letters]:
[5390] SVA+LA tagged—great;
[5391] YA+DU tagged—great;
[5392] KA+SKRE tagged—great;
[5393] HRA+HA tagged—great;
[5394] NYA+RA tagged—great;
[5395] NGA+TE tagged—great;
[5396] YA+LA tagged—great;
[5397] SMA+KHRU tagged—great.
[5398] These are the great letters.
[5399] The short letters are:
[5400] NGA+YA tagged—short;
[5401] GA+NGA tagged—short;
[5402] DA+NGA tagged—short;
[5403] KA+ZHA tagged—short;
[5404] JA+SA tagged—short;
[5405] YA+NI tagged—short;
[5406] KHA+U tagged—short.
[5414] SA+NGA tagged—short; DA+NA tagged—short. The branches that arise are pronounced accordingly. Thus it is spoken.
[5415] Also CA, JA, ZA, ZHA, and CHA have arisen; one should not doubt that India does not [have them], for although Sanskrit's well-composed letters do not [exist], the ḍākinīs of Uḍḍiyāṇa have those sounds, so these forms have arisen.
[5416] These tantras are the letters of Uḍḍiyāṇa, held by the ḍākinīs.
[5417] The second, near-sound expression, is explained in two aspects: the single [letter] and the expression of the sphere's abode.
[5418] The single letter's abode is A, GA, SHA, and so forth—joined to whichever root of saṃsāra or nirvāṇa and explained. Tibetans recite GA, JA, DA, BA, and so forth, joined with aspiration. Other letters are recited separately.
[5419] Also, for KARMA, SARVA, and so forth, the prefix sound is called RA and RBA. When alone, it is called MA and BA.
[5420] The expression of the sphere's abode has three [aspects]: the prefix, the branch, and the stacked [letter].
[5421] The first is the double-stacked, called "prefix." When life-force is concordant, it is recited as one: like BHA, DHA, JHA, etc.
[5422] These, the letter's consort sound, are expressed with the ZHA-manner of HA sound slightly emanating.
[5423] When life-force is not concordant, it is separated and expressed separately: like AṬA, CAṬA, CA RI, recited as A ṬA, CA ṬA, CA RI.
[5424] All stacked types are thus.
[5425] The second also has life-concordant and life-discordant sequences, similar to that.
[5426] Separately, in Tibetan manner, like KAG CHEN: above KA-like, NA RO two, ZHENG BU two, GU GU two, KLAD KOR one, ZHABS KYU two, YA-tagged two, RA-tagged two, RI part one—when these arise, the mother [letter] arises fourteen times.
[5427] "See the classes of these letters aside." Stacked letters, note 2.
[5428] KO KĀO; KE KĀE; KĪ; KU; KYŪ; KRA KRĀ.
[5465] KAṂ KĀ is called. The root KA is KA alone; the head-circle is KAṂ. NA RO and so forth: each subsequent [letter] is read with its long portion. That is made the power of the branch tagged to the single [letter].
[5466] For the prefix with branch tags:
[5467] "Please examine the classes of these letters carefully." Stacked letters, note 3.
[5468] For one KA-like: NA RO two, GU GU two, ZHENG BU two, foot-hook two, YA tag two, RA tag two—one affixing LA. If the head-circle and one long portion exist:
[5469] The root KA and the affixing LA two are given half of the above and below NA RO and so forth. Given to the head-circle LA, this is the giving condition for both long portions to benefit.
[5470] For example: KĪ LĪ KĀO LĀO KĒ LĒ KŪ LŪ KYŪ LŪ YA KRĀ LĀ RA LAṂ.
[5471] Thus, when LA and RA are life-discordant, the normal LA and RA tags are inserted in order and pronounced.
[5472] When many or few branches arise above and below, the remainder is given to the prefix letter and read.
[5473] The head-circle gives power to the prefix.
[5474] When the above NA RO and so forth consist of one without elongation, it is pronounced lengthened.
[5475] The NA RO and so forth—the four ornament letters—are given to the prefix.
[5476] When the below end-support, foot-hook, and so forth, each are not in a group, it is given to the root and the prefix is pronounced alone.
[5477] The example of these two: according to sequence, KMOṂ is called: KA MO KA MI KA ME MAṂ is read.
[5478] KACAR is called: KRA CA KYA CA KU CA is pronounced.
[5479] This also: the root letters are first led by the nose and pronounced before the prefix.
[5480] NA RO, GU GU, ZHENG BU, head-circle—the four ornament letters—are called "the four letters of ornament."
[5481] YA tag, RA tag, foot-hook—the three end-supports or "four support letters."
[5482] When GU GU is double-stacked on the single [letters], it is called "straight placement."
[5508] KĪ is called a long single GU GU.
[5509] When NA RO is double-stacked, it is called upper and lower.
[5510] KOU is called a single foot-hook.
[5511] When GRENG BU is double-stacked, it is called GRENG and bent.
[5512] KEI is called a single GU GU.
[5513] Third, the expression manner of stacked letters:
[5514] When sounds are expressed like those suitable for life, etc.,
[5515] [
[5516] Please observe aside the classes of these letters.
[5517] 4 stacked letters.
[5518] Note.
[5519] ]Thus:
[5520] O KO ŚO MI TRĪ ṬAṂ is called.
[5521] Its meaning is:
[5522] The birthless pure dharmakāya,
[5523] The nature of wisdom, all dharmas non-dual,
[5524] Eternal wisdom, empty and cessationless,
[5525] Sphere arising from sphere,
[5526] Adorned by non-dual wisdom.
[5527] Therefore, the nature of the three-stacked sphere-wisdom.
[5528] This is also the Rigpa wisdom not transcending the equality of reality.
[5529] Light has two: the light of the realized person
[5530] And the light of sentient beings through non-realization.
[5531] For those endowed with realization, wisdom spontaneously arises in these very appearances.
[5532] Though the unrealized possess the five lights, they do not see them, and thus they are not indicated.
[5533] Thus also other abodes of stacked letters—
[5534] [
[5535] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."
[5536] Stacked letter five—annotation.
[5537] Thus it is called: NI TSI DZI MO ṬAM SHU MA NUS RBA Dharma KAYA SIDDHI BHĀRA.
[5538] Within these established sounds: Dharma KAYA, SIDDHI, BHĀRA exist.
[5539] Their meaning:
[5540] The pure body is shown by actual sound;
[5541] the impure body is shown through establishment.
[5542] Therein, the pure wisdom-body:
[5543] This appearance, ceasing, immediately arises.
[5544] The impure sentient beings' body is this very appearance as concreteness.
[5545] The wisdom-body: Rigpa at the heart, empty-cognizing, meaning-wisdom.
[5546] Dharmatā: permanent, unchanging—reversed from confusion.
[5547] Rigpa's wisdom reversed from the world.
[5548] Rigpa's compassion, unceasing, benefits beings.
[5549] Further, the stacked classes are shown:
[5550] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."
[5551] Stacked letter six—annotation.
[5552] Thus it is: E DE GE MAṂ LHA NYA; AD MA KO TSAG KRA BA LO KI.
[5553] Its meaning enters light:
[5554] Rigpa's light, kāya's light, wisdom's light—these three gathered into dharmadhātu.
[5555] This too: from dharmatā's equality, not gone beyond.
[5556] For the non-dual meaning, wisdom's self-nature:
[5557] Emptiness stacked—emptiness of sambhogakāya's equality, meaning of complete enjoyment body.
[5558] Kāya beyond words,
[5559] pervaded by clear light,
[5560] whatever portion depends—nothing remains.
[5561] The path has three:
[5562] 1. The empty wisdom-path,
[5563] 2. The clear light-path,
[5564] 3. The unchanging Rigpa's empty path.
[5565] First: the lamp of the bodhi path.
[5566] Second: wisdom's illusory body.
[5567] Third: the precious body.
[5568] These three too, in dharmadhātu's nature, are one taste:
[5569] Dharmatā's great equality's expanse, supreme, unchanging, not gone beyond.
[5570] Further stacked classes:
[5571] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray."
[5585] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter seven—annotation.
[5586] Thus it is: SHAM PADZRA MU TAD YA BYA NYA PRA PA RA DUS STAN KA HIH—its meaning:
[5587] By wisdom's meaning, realized;
[5588] Time-unchanging wisdom, ignorance by nature conquered.
[5589] Dharmadhātu's equality, surrounded and endowed.
[5590] In self always existing, pervasion threefold endowed.
[5591] Equality-day's wisdom, self-arisen.
[5592] Further:
[5593] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter eight—annotation.
[5594] Thus it is: MAṂ GAM HA SA HŪM—accomplishing, MA LA MA LA DHA THIM DHA THIM—its meaning:
[5595] Self's Rigpa, equal-pure body's form, realized.
[5596] That too, by self-arisen emptiness-wisdom, pervaded, realized.
[5597] That too, to self-entity's ground, complete parinirvāṇa, realized.
[5598] Three Kāyas, gathering-separating without, meaning realized.
[5599] All dharmas, equality, non-dual, realized.
[5600] From that, compassion unceasing, like sun-rays, shines.
[5601] Conceptual wisdom, self-place grasped.
[5602] Further:
[5603] "Of these letter-classes, aside observe, I pray." Stacked letter nine—annotation.
[5604] Thus it is: TA KA YU MU SHA SU MA HĀ DU BHĀRI KE HĀ KE HĀ—
[5605] Unchanging, Three Kāyas' ground, pressed.
[5606] All-times wisdom, always abiding, Dharma-pure wisdom-heart possessed;
[5607] Equality-wisdom's self-nature become.
[5608] To emptiness, three compassions, one time arising—that too, unceasing manner, equality-wisdom's kāya, not gone beyond.
[5609] Unchanging wisdom, self-constituent, explained.
[5610] Sound's place, many letters stacked: vowel and NA RO below, in order given, with GU GU, thus read;
[5611] Head-circle below's top, placed.
[5612] This letter-place is the bind of seventeen tantras' internals;
[5613] Wherever Tantra's place arises, thus understand.
[5614] These stacked letter examples, from Samantabhadra's mind-mirror arisen, like.
[5615] This letter-wheel's order, Tantra's difficult place, is.
[5626] Know meaning great penetrate thinking here well established.
[5627] Second topic introduction definite enumerate explained two:
[5628] Generally shown and,
[5629] Particularly explained.
[5630] First is:
[5631] Secret unsurpassed tantras meanings minds types two bound explained,
[5632] Awareness self-appearance mind-possessors mind,
[5633] Tantra name-meaning division and,
[5634] Focus object mind-possessors mind Tantra text definitely shown.
[5635] Thus also from Talgyur:
[5636] E MA Tantra definite arisen,
[5637] Minds types two are,
[5638] Awareness self-appearance mind-possessors,
[5639] Tantra name-meaning divided,
