[474] From each of the five winds also abiding as five:
[475] First, the five life-holding winds from the Self-Arisen:
[476] In life-holding wind also five:
[477] Root-holding life and
[478] Protecting life and
[479] Spreading life and
[480] Impure life and
[481] Shattering life—five. Thus.
[482] Those also according to sequence:
[483] Awareness-potential producing and
[484] Bindhu-potential producing and
[485] Light-potential producing and
[486] Non-awareness root holding and
[487] Existing in life-channel in mind-helper making manner.
[488] Life-wind potential relies upon and abides in awareness-potential.
[489] Second, the five fire-equal winds:
[490] Again from that:
[491] In fire-abiding wind also five:
[492] Clear-impure separating wind and
[493] Warmth-producing wind and
[494] Clear-change wind and
[495] Distinctions-gathering wind and
[496] Praise-making wind—five. Thus.  [497] Those also according to sequence:


### PAGE 10

[497] Nondual with life,
[498] Nondual with awareness,
[499] Nondual with lamp,
[500] Nondual with bindhu,
[501] Abide nondual with wisdom.
[502] Third, the five color-radiance producing winds—also from That Source:
[503] In color-radiance producing wind also five: consciousness-producing wind and
[504] Mind-arising wind and
[505] Radiance-possessing wind and
[506] Burning wind and
[507] Wildness wind—five. Thus.
[508] Those also according to sequence: wisdom-object,
[509] Appearing-object,
[510] Lamp-object,
[511] Non-awareness object,
[512] Mind-object horse making.
[513] Fourth, the five all-pervading winds:
[514] From the Self-Arisen:
[515] In all-pervading wind also five:
[516] Base-pervading and
[517] Immediate-pervading and
[518] Hatred-fear pervading and
[519] Memory-pervading and
[520] All body-pervading by holding—five. Thus.
[521] Those also according to sequence:
[522] Wisdom-appearing,
[523] Lamp-appearing,
[524] Knowing-appearing,
[525] Thinking-appearing,
[526] Mind-appearing potency making.
[527] Fifth, the five compassionless karma winds:
[528] Again from That Source:
[529] In compassionless aeon-karma wind also five:
[530] Movement-making wind and
[531] Liberation-making wind and
[532] Reversal-making wind and
[533] Swiftness-making wind and
[534] Moments wind—five. Thus.
[535] Those also according to sequence:
[536] Aggregates-pervading,
[537] Moments-pervading,
[538] Bardo-pervading,
[539] Concepts-pervading,
[540] Three-pervading—moments, actions, completion.
[541] Thus, twenty-five also gather into five roots.
[542] These terms' explanation:
[543] From the Self-Arisen:
[544] Because of true-ground movement-making,
[545] Move-making wind it is called.
[546] Because of pure wisdom's life-holding,
[547] Life-holding wind it is called.
[548] Because of five wisdom-lights' self-nature existing,
[549] Color-radiance producing wind it is called.
[550] Because of wisdom's true expanse liberation ability,
[551] Compassionless aeon-karma wind it is called.  [552] Because of wisdom-appearing's non-gathering non-separating abiding,  [553] Fire-equal wind it is called. Thus.  [554] Thus, in the five essence winds, relying on awareness-wisdom, now abiding in heart,  [555] That is wisdom's self-sound-potential clearing as five lights' essential point.  [556] When awareness separates from wind, wisdom-expanse gathering,  [557] Outer-inner's non-manifest also arrives at pure wind-mind's essential point.


### PAGE 11

[552] Explaining briefly summarized here:
[553] Primordially pure essence's awareness-jewel abides in luminous self-nature's palace, in secret cavity, as essence-nature-compassion-three's master.
[554] Although that essence, abiding as kaya, has unclear self-purpose, it is self-clear, appearing as outer-kaya from appearance's non-ceasing base.
[555] Nature: five lights' arising base, life wind, and four branches, primordially abiding as speech's essence.
[556] Compassion, self-arisen awareness-essence, spontaneously complete as two-knowing's wisdom.
[557] Abiding without shift or change from kaya-wisdom's non-gathering non-separating intention.
[558] The two-knowing:
[559] Depending on dharmata's inner-clear essence, all-knowing;
[560] Depending on dharmapossessor's outer-clear aspect, all-aspect-knowing appearing as wisdom.
[561] Five winds: from root life-wind's portion, compassion, awareness-wisdom—if pure, buddha-wisdom;
[562] If impure, become beings' realization-aggregate arising-base.
[563] Four branch winds emanating from that, from compassion-potency, like sun's rays:
[564] Upward-going wisdom-horse and
[565] Downward-clearing wisdom-ray, potential-light, and
[566] Fire-equal ripening-possessing power, and
[567] Completing-pervasion possessing power—four.
[568] Although these also exist only in life-wind's portion,
[569] In expanse, not emanated;
[570] Abiding only as emanation's non-ceasing base's essence.
[571] Essence-branch clear as light.
[572] Thus stated, also from the Kun gsal:
[573] That kaya's abiding manner:
[574] Like empty-luminous bubble's form-reflection.
[575] That speech's abiding nature:
[576] Like fire-sparks' rays, four branch winds
[577] Clear in awareness-expanse.
[578] That mind's clear nature:
[579] Life-wind's self-essence,
[580] Like wisdom fire-sparks without falling-direction,
[581] Abide as essence-of-essence's five wisdoms.
[582] Thus.
[583] That also is wisdom not deceived by any concept.


### PAGE 12

[584] Altering and transforming—
[585] Not able to be grasped by face or designated by mark,
[586] Like earth and sky,
[587] Clear and subtle, like sparks of fire behind the five lights,
[588] The expanse's heart essence, dharmakaya,
[589] Abiding as awareness itself, holding all's basis.
[590] Its abiding palace is
[591] From that very source:
[592] Dharmadhatu, empty and all-pervading like space—
[593] Thus it is said.
[594] When that dharmakaya abides within the precious interior,
[595] It is called dharmata's pure original tone,
[596] The house possessing awareness-light,
[597] Abiding in light's display.
[598] This is called the primordial common basis, awareness-expanse,
[599] The meaning of establishing connection with the five winds.
[600] Second, the five fires' extensive explanation, from Self-Arisen:
[601] There are five fires:
[602] Outer-inner all-pervading fire,
[603] Outer-inner all-illuminating fire,
[604] Outer-inner all-equalizing fire,
[605] Outer-inner action's concept fire,
[606] Outer-inner action's accomplishing fire—thus five.
[607] These also, in sequence,
[608] Reside in lungs,
[609] Eyes and five limbs, making six,
[610] Flesh gaps,
[611] Two soles of feet,
[612] And two palms of hands, producing warmth.
[613] Third, the five earths as well:
[614] From that same source:
[615] There are five earths:
[616] All-illuminating earth,
[617] Unchanging vajra earth,
[618] Precious earth from which all arise,
[619] All-pervading earth showing appearances,
[620] Perfected accomplishment earth—thus five.
[621] These also, in sequence,
[622] Together with awareness,
[623] Together with lamp,
[624] Together with thigle,
[625] Together with wisdom,
[626] Together with discriminating awareness, they abide in reliance.
[627] Fourth, the five waters also from Self-Arisen:
[628] The five water kinds are:
[629] Unchanging water,
[630] Peaceful, clear, pure water,
[631] Extensively arising qualities' water,
[632] Attachment-free water,
[633] Completion-without-grasping water—thus five.
[634] These also, according to sequence,
[635] Together with all channels—


### PAGE 13

[636] Together with all bones,
[637] Together with all blood,
[638] Together with all lymph,
[639] Abiding within two eyes, moistening without essence-holding.
[640] Fifth, the five spaces:
[641] Again, from Self-Arisen it is taught:
[642] The five spaces are:
[643] All-common-pervading space,
[644] Object-free clear-tone space,
[645] Pure unmixed space,
[646] Meaning-indicating space,
[647] Pure-field liberating space—thus.
[648] These also, in sequence,
[649] Together with actual awareness,
[650] Together with five lights,
[651] Together with pure-expanse lamp,
[652] Together with signs' wisdom,
[653] Together with twenty-one pointing-out instructions, example-meaning certain confidence.
[654] Thus, five elements' awareness summarized attributes are the great elements,
[655] While their basis is the small elements.
[656] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[657] The fifteenth division: Showing the Elements' Place.
[658] Thus, having established elements' nature as basis,
[659] Now, the supported's fourfold purity: expanse and wisdom:
[660] Basis: kayas,
[661] Tone: light,
[662] Supported: wisdom,
[663] Activities: enlightened actions.
[664] First, basis-kayas' extensive division has two parts:
[665] Three kayas' expanse general presentation, and
[666] Five kayas' enumeration particular explanation.
[667] The first has: kayas' definition brief presentation, and
[668] Place extensive explanation.
