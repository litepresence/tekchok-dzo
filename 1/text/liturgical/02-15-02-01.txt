[474] <prose> Second, branch division:
[475] <prose> From each of the five winds also abiding as five:
[476] <prose> First, the five life-holding winds from the Self-Arisen:
[477] <prose> In life-holding wind also five:
[478] <list> 1. Root-holding life and
[479] <list> 2. Protecting life and
[480] <list> 3. Spreading life and || 10 ||
[481] <list> 4. Impure life and
[482] <list> 5. Shattering life—five. Thus.
[483] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[484] <list> 1. Awareness-potential producing and
[485] <list> 2. Bindhu-potential producing and
[486] <list> 3. Light-potential producing and
[487] <list> 4. Non-awareness root holding and
[488] <list> 5. Existing in life-channel in mind-helper making manner.
[489] <prose> Life-wind potential relies upon and abides in awareness-potential. || 20 ||
[490] <prose> Second, the five fire-equal winds:
[491] <tantra> Again from that:
[492] <verse> "In fire-abiding wind also five:
[493] <verse> Clear-impure separating wind and
[494] <verse> Warmth-producing wind and
[495] <verse> Clear-change wind and
[496] <verse> Distinctions-gathering wind and || 30 ||
[497] <verse> Praise-making wind—five."
[498] <tantra> Thus.
[499] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[500] <list> 1. Nondual with awareness,
[501] <list> 2. Nondual with lamp,
[502] <list> 3. Nondual with bindhu,
[503] <list> 4. Abide nondual with wisdom.
[504] <prose> Third, the five color-radiance producing winds—also from That Source: || 40 ||
[505] <tantra> In color-radiance producing wind also five: consciousness-producing wind and
[506] <verse> Mind-arising wind and
[507] <verse> Radiance-possessing wind and
[508] <verse> Burning wind and
[509] <verse> Wildness wind—five."
[510] <tantra> Thus.
[511] <prose> Those also according to sequence: wisdom-object,
[512] <list> 1. Appearing-object,
[513] <list> 2. Lamp-object, || 50 ||
[514] <list> 3. Non-awareness object,
[514] <list> 4. Mind-object horse making.
[515] <prose> Fourth, the five all-pervading winds:
[516] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[517] <verse> "In all-pervading wind also five:
[518] <verse> Base-pervading and
[519] <verse> Immediate-pervading and
[520] <verse> Hatred-fear pervading and || 60 ||
[521] <verse> Memory-pervading and
[522] <verse> All body-pervading by holding—five."
[523] <tantra> Thus.
[524] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[525] <list> 1. Wisdom-appearing,
[526] <list> 2. Lamp-appearing,
[527] <list> 3. Knowing-appearing,
[528] <list> 4. Thinking-appearing,
[529] <list> 5. Mind-appearing potency making.
[530] <prose> Fifth, the five compassionless karma winds: || 70 ||
[531] <tantra> Again from That Source:
[532] <verse> "In compassionless aeon-karma wind also five:
[533] <verse> Movement-making wind and
[534] <verse> Liberation-making wind and
[535] <verse> Reversal-making wind and
[536] <verse> Swiftness-making wind and || 80 ||
[537] <verse> Moments wind—five."
[538] <tantra> Thus.
[539] <prose> Those also according to sequence:
[540] <list> 1. Aggregates-pervading,
[541] <list> 2. Moments-pervading,
[542] <list> 3. Bardo-pervading,
[543] <list> 4. Concepts-pervading,
[544] <list> 5. Three-pervading—moments, actions, completion.
[545] <prose> Thus, twenty-five also gather into five roots.
[546] <prose> These terms' explanation:
[547] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen: || 90 ||
[548] <verse> "Because of true-ground movement-making,
[549] <verse> Move-making wind it is called.
[550] <verse> Because of pure wisdom's life-holding,
[551] <verse> Life-holding wind it is called.
[552] <verse> Because of five wisdom-lights' self-nature existing,
[553] <verse> Color-radiance producing wind it is called.
[554] <verse> Because of wisdom's true expanse liberation ability,
[555] <verse> Compassionless aeon-karma wind it is called.
[556] <verse> Because of wisdom-appearing's non-gathering non-separating abiding,
[557] <verse> Fire-equal wind it is called."
[558] <tantra> Thus. || 100 ||
[559] <prose> Thus, in the five essence winds, relying on awareness-wisdom, now abiding in heart,
[560] <prose> That is wisdom's self-sound-potential clearing as five lights' essential point.
[561] <prose> When awareness separates from wind, wisdom-expanse gathering,
[562] <prose> Outer-inner's non-manifest also arrives at pure wind-mind's essential point.
[563] <prose> The two-knowing:
[564] <list> 1. Depending on dharmata's inner-clear essence, all-knowing;
[565] <list> 2. Depending on dharmapossessor's outer-clear aspect, all-aspect-knowing appearing as wisdom. || 110 ||
[566] <prose> Five winds: from root life-wind's portion, compassion, awareness-wisdom—if pure, buddha-wisdom;
[567] <prose> If impure, become beings' realization-aggregate arising-base.
[568] <prose> Four branch winds emanating from that, from compassion-potency, like sun's rays:
[569] <list> 1. Upward-going wisdom-horse and
[570] <list> 2. Downward-clearing wisdom-ray, potential-light, and || 120 ||
[571] <list> 3. Fire-equal ripening-possessing power, and
[572] <list> 4. Completing-pervasion possessing power—four.
[573] <prose> Although these also exist only in life-wind's portion,
[574] <prose> In expanse, not emanated;
[575] <prose> Abiding only as emanation's non-ceasing base's essence.
[576] <prose> Essence-branch clear as light.
[577] <tantra> Thus stated, also from the Kun gsal:
[578] <verse> "That kaya's abiding manner: || 130 ||
[579] <verse> Like empty-luminous bubble's form-reflection.
[580] <verse> That speech's abiding nature:
[581] <verse> Like fire-sparks' rays, four branch winds
[582] <verse> Clear in awareness-expanse.
[583] <verse> That mind's clear nature:
[584] <verse> Life-wind's self-essence,
[585] <verse> Like wisdom fire-sparks without falling-direction,
[586] <verse> Abide as essence-of-essence's five wisdoms."
[587] <tantra> Thus. || 140 ||
[588] <prose> That also is wisdom not deceived by any concept.
[589] <prose> Altering and transforming—
[590] <prose> Not able to be grasped by face or designated by mark,
[591] <prose> Like earth and sky,
[592] <prose> Clear and subtle, like sparks of fire behind the five lights,
[593] <prose> The expanse's heart essence, dharmakaya,
[594] <prose> Abiding as awareness itself, holding all's basis.
[595] <prose> Its abiding palace is
[596] <tantra> From that very source:
[597] <verse> "Dharmadhatu, empty and all-pervading like space—" || 150 ||
[598] <tantra> Thus it is said.
[599] <prose> When that dharmakaya abides within the precious interior,
[600] <prose> It is called dharmata's pure original tone,
[601] <prose> The house possessing awareness-light,
[602] <prose> Abiding in light's display.
[603] <prose> This is called the primordial common basis, awareness-expanse,
[604] <prose> The meaning of establishing connection with the five winds.
[605] <prose> Second, the five fires' extensive explanation, from Self-Arisen:
[606] <tantra> There are five fires:
[607] <verse> "Outer-inner all-pervading fire,
[608] <verse> Outer-inner all-illuminating fire, || 160 ||
[609] <verse> Outer-inner all-equalizing fire,
[610] <verse> Outer-inner action's concept fire,
[611] <verse> Outer-inner action's accomplishing fire—thus five."
[612] <tantra> Thus.
[613] <prose> These also, in sequence,
[614] <list> 1. Reside in lungs,
[615] <list> 2. Eyes and five limbs, making six,
[616] <list> 3. Flesh gaps,
[617] <list> 4. Two soles of feet,
[618] <list> 5. And two palms of hands, producing warmth.
[619] <prose> Third, the five earths as well: || 170 ||
[620] <tantra> From that same source:
[621] <verse> "There are five earths:
[622] <verse> All-illuminating earth,
[623] <verse> Unchanging vajra earth,
[624] <verse> Precious earth from which all arise,
[625] <verse> All-pervading earth showing appearances,
[626] <verse> Perfected accomplishment earth—thus five."
[627] <tantra> Thus.
[628] <prose> These also, in sequence,
[629] <list> 1. Together with awareness,
[630] <list> 2. Together with lamp, || 180 ||
[631] <list> 3. Together with thigle,
[632] <list> 4. Together with wisdom,
[633] <list> 5. Together with discriminating awareness, they abide in reliance.
[634] <prose> Fourth, the five waters also from Self-Arisen:
[635] <tantra> The five water kinds are:
[636] <verse> "Unchanging water,
[637] <verse> Peaceful, clear, pure water,
[638] <verse> Extensively arising qualities' water,
[639] <verse> Attachment-free water,
[640] <verse> Completion-without-grasping water—thus five." || 190 ||
[641] <tantra> Thus.
[642] <prose> These also, according to sequence,
[643] <list> 1. Together with all channels—
[644] <list> 2. Together with all bones,
[645] <list> 3. Together with all blood,
[646] <list> 4. Together with all lymph,
[647] <list> 5. Abiding within two eyes, moistening without essence-holding.
[648] <prose> Fifth, the five spaces:
[649] <tantra> Again, from Self-Arisen it is taught:
[650] <verse> "The five spaces are:
[651] <verse> All-common-pervading space, || 200 ||
[652] <verse> Object-free clear-tone space,
[653] <verse> Pure unmixed space,
[654] <verse> Meaning-indicating space,
[655] <verse> Pure-field liberating space—thus."
[656] <tantra> Thus.
[657] <prose> These also, in sequence,
[658] <list> 1. Together with actual awareness,
[659] <list> 2. Together with five lights,
[660] <list> 3. Together with pure-expanse lamp,
[661] <list> 4. Together with signs' wisdom,
[662] <list> 5. Together with twenty-one pointing-out instructions, example-meaning certain confidence. || 210 ||
[663] <prose> Thus, five elements' awareness summarized attributes are the great elements,
[664] <prose> While their basis is the small elements.
[665] <ornament> From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[666] <ornament> The fifteenth division: Showing the Elements' Place.
[667] <prose> Thus, having established elements' nature as basis,
[668] <prose> Now, the supported's fourfold purity: expanse and wisdom:
[669] <list> 1. Basis: kayas,
[670] <list> 2. Tone: light,
[671] <list> 3. Supported: wisdom,
[672] <list> 4. Activities: enlightened actions. || 220 ||
[673] <prose> First, basis-kayas' extensive division has two parts:
[674] <list> 1. Three kayas' expanse general presentation, and
[675] <list> 2. Five kayas' enumeration particular explanation.
[676] <prose> The first has: kayas' definition brief presentation, and
[677] <prose> Place extensive explanation.
[678] <prose> First is:
