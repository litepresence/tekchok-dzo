[2849] First: all phenomena including the container and contained of appearance and existence arranged by intellect are the false conventional.
[2850] Because appearance manifests as the essence of object-delusion appearing as intellect's falseness.
[2851] Those also imputed appearances arise as appearances accordant with the function of deluded intellect.
[2852] They possess the power to function.
[2853] When analyzed, they are empty by their very essence—
[2854] In the manner of the eight examples of illusion:
[2855] Arising as non-existent yet clear-appearing,
[2856] As before:
[2857] Like a dream, like an illusion,
[2858] Like a gandharva city,
[2859] Thus arise, thus abide,
[2860] Thus also cease.
[2861] Thus.
[2862] The true conventional:
[2863] Though appearing deluded, it serves as the cause of blissful migration and liberation.
[2864] The white actions of the ten virtues,
[2865] The collections of merit such as generosity,
[2866] Gathered through the path of truth by means of the mind's samadhi of wisdom, the four aspects of seeing and meditating, serving as the field of experience for intellect.

[2867] From the Uttaratantra Commentary:
[2868] All paths of truth are compounded.
[2869] All compounds are merely conventional.
[2870] That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—the essence of emptiness—along with the subsequent measuring wisdom, the peaceful aspect of elaboration, is the ultimate truth.
[2871] Divided: the nominal ultimate and the verbal ultimate.
[2872] These two: the non-nominal ultimate and the truly authentic ultimate.
