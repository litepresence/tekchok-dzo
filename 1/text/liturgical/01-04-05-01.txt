[2849] First: all phenomena including the container world and contained beings of appearance and existence arranged by intellect are the false conventional.
[2850] Because appearance manifests as the essence of object-delusion appearing as intellect's falseness.
[2851] Those also imputed appearances arise as appearances accordant with the function of deluded intellect.
[2852] They possess the power to function causally.
[2853] When analyzed, they are empty by their very essence—
[2854] In the manner of the eight examples of illusion:
[2855] <list> Arising as non-existent yet clear-appearing,
[2856] <list> As before explained:
[2857] <list> Like a dream, like an illusion,
[2858] <list> Like a gandharva city in the sky,
[2859] <list> Thus they arise, thus they abide,
[2860] <list> Thus also they cease.
[2861] Thus is the false conventional.
[2862] The true conventional:
[2863] Though appearing deluded, it serves as the cause of blissful migration and ultimate liberation.
[2864] The white virtuous actions of the ten virtues,
[2865] The collections of merit such as generosity and so forth,
[2866] Gathered through the path of truth by means of the mind's samādhi of wisdom, the four aspects of seeing and meditating, serving as the field of experience for intellect.
[2867] From the Uttaratantra Commentary:
[2868] <prose><tantra> "All paths of truth are compounded.
[2869] <prose><tantra> All compounds are merely conventional.
[2870] <prose><tantra> That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—the essence of emptiness—along with the subsequent measuring wisdom, the peaceful aspect free from elaboration, is the ultimate truth."
[2871] Divided: the nominal ultimate and the verbal ultimate.
[2872] These two: the non-nominal ultimate and the truly authentic ultimate.
