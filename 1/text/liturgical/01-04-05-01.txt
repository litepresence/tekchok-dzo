[2849] First: Look directly at this very moment—whatever appears as the container world and contained beings is nothing but the spontaneous display of the kayas, the play of awareness.
[2850] See how appearance manifests yet has never been apart from the Dharmakaya's display—object and subject appearing as illusory projections of mind's clarity.
[2851] These appearing forms arise spontaneously, functioning naturally without ever having substantial existence.
[2852] They possess the power to function causally while being utterly empty—this is the wonder of appearance-emptiness inseparable.
[2853] When you look directly, you find nothing to grasp—empty by its very nature from the very beginning.
[2854] In the manner of the eight examples of illusion:
<list> Arising as non-existent yet clear-appearing,
<list> As directly pointed out:
<list> Like a dream, like an illusion,
<list> Like a gandharva city in the sky, || 10 ||
<list> Thus they display, thus they are spontaneously present,
<list> Thus also they are never other than the ground.
[2861] This is the spontaneous display of kayas—nothing to adopt or reject.
[2862] The ultimate truth:
[2863] Though appearing in variety, recognize it as the Dharmakaya's display serving the welfare of beings who do not recognize.
[2864] The white virtuous actions, the ten virtues,
[2865] The collections of merit such as generosity and so forth,
[2866] Are skillful means within the play—seen through wisdom's samādhi, the four aspects of seeing and meditating, yet never departing from the expanse of rigpa.
[2867] From the Uttaratantra Commentary:
<tantra> "All paths of truth are compounded. || 20 ||
<tantra> All compounds are merely conventional.
<tantra> That which dwells as the inherent nature of dharma—the essence of emptiness—along with the subsequent measuring wisdom, the peaceful aspect free from elaboration, is the ultimate truth."
[2871] Divided: the nominal ultimate and the non-nominal ultimate.
[2872] These two: the merely conceptual ultimate and the truly authentic ultimate.
[2873] Now recognize: the authentic ultimate is your own rigpa, naked and unstained—nothing to search for elsewhere.
