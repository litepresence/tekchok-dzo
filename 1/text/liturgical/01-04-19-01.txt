[3994] First, through error not experienced, ignorance's continuum is pure,
[3995] Now, not dwelling in error, the basis of action and affliction is empty,
[3996] Later, error becomes impossible, the cord of action's virtue and sin is cut.
[3997] Self-nature without difference—the basis of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is one,
[3998] Error is completely pure,
[3999] Characteristic: without error's cause, the three realms are tossed like a sack.
[4000] The third essence:
[4001] The basis of falling-doers empty, the unobtainable basis is held,
[4002] Self-nature beyond calculation—even as merely non-error, without establishment,
[4003] Characteristic: duality not established, error and non-error separated.
[4004] The third: the essence of bindu brought to self-abiding—alone, free from elaboration, without many parts,


### PAGE 109

[4005] Self-nature without multiplicity—dharmatā beyond the words of conceptual elaboration, all-pervading.
[4006] Characteristic: pointed out, the cord of confidence is cut.
[4007] That divided, there are two:
[4008] The ear lineage and
[4009] The explanation lineage.
[4010] The essence of the ear lineage: connected one-to-one, especially near itself.
[4011] That too: self-nature connected to the ear faculty, without interruption by others,
[4012] Characteristic: without wavering, with confidence and the certainty of liberation.
[4013] Divided into many: with syllables and
[4014] Without syllables—the ear lineage of dharmatā's meaning and instruction.
[4015] The essence of the explanation lineage:
[4016] Dharmatā without action, without cause, without basis to reverse the three realms,
[4017] Self-nature:
[4018] Clear light without stain, knowing the characteristics of the five wisdoms,
[4019] Characteristic: beyond thought and investigation, dwelling in the intention of the three bodies possessing the five wisdoms.
[4020] Divided, there are four:
[4021] The outer cycle,
[4022] The inner cycle,
[4023] The secret cycle,
[4024] The unsurpassable secret cycle.
[4025] The essence of the outer cycle:
[4026] Without abandoning afflictions, the five poisons dwell as path-vehicles,
[4027] Self-nature without effort or establishment—whatever appears arises as dharmatā,
[4028] Characteristic without parts—emptiness nowhere divided.
[4029] The essence of the inner cycle: not possessing form, the markless dharmatā,
[4030] Self-nature without coming or going, the wisdom always dwelling at all times,
[4031] Characteristic: from the aspect of solidity, arising like a root,
[4032] From the aspect of twisting, arising like a trunk, from the aspect of clarity, arising like a flower,
[4033] From the aspect of ripening, arising like a fruit.
[4034] The essence of the secret cycle:
[4035] Pointing out and
[4036] Realization attained simultaneously, depending completely on the three: hearing, contemplation, and meditation,
[4037] Self-nature: breath cessation and buddhahood simultaneously, depending completely on effort, establishment, and familiarization-power,
[4038] Characteristic: buddhahood and compassion arising simultaneously, depending completely on accumulation and merit.
[4039] The essence of the unsurpassable secret cycle:


### PAGE 110

[4040] Not depending on words, completely depending on discerning wisdom.
[4041] Self-nature:
[4042] Directly seeing, not dwelling in the intellect-grasping view.
[4043] Characteristic: the measure of four appearances arrived at, the result of three bodies and five wisdoms not aimed at.
[4044] From that, this is the unsurpassed secret:
[4045] Below, through dharmatā's intellect-confidence reaching,
[4046] Here, through the guru's power, existing as the direct object of the senses—specially superior.
[4047] Thus shown, all cycles gathered into one sūtra, the definite sequence of division and summary:
[4048] These Great Perfections: nine in the expanse,
[4049] Twenty-one thousand volumes,
[4050] Three sections,
[4051] Thirty-five thousand chapters,
[4052] Eight great sections,
[4053] One hundred eighty sharp nails,
[4054] Fifteen hundred summaries,
[4055] Seven bundles of distinctions,
[4056] One and a half hundred-thousand enumerations,
[4057] Five thousand essential points,
[4058] Sixty-four hundred-thousand ślokas,
[4059] Twenty thousand name-affixed tantras dwelling as essences.
[4060] From the definitive conclusion,
[4061] From the nature of Great Perfection,
[4062] Word-distinctions emanate.
[4063] From the three sections, nine expanses become,
[4064] From the word summary, ślokas,
[4065] From fourteen hundred-thousand,
[4066] Thirty-five thousand chapters,
[4067] Twenty-one thousand volumes,
[4068] The spoken object equal to the sky's end,
[4069] Cutting the thoughts of disciples and beings,
[4070] From this, the spoken object abbreviated,
[4071] To one hundred eighty sharp nails,
[4072] Summaries one and a half thousand,
[4073] Three thousand great gathered essential points,
[4074] To forty thousand deviation-obstacles,
[4075] Twenty thousand name-affixed tantras,
[4076] The sequence of word-speaking clearly established.
[4077] Thus it is.
[4078] These too, when summarized:
[4079] Mind Section,
[4080] Expanse Section,
[4081] Instruction Section—gathered as three.
[4082] There: all of Mind Section—the inexpressible expanse of dharmatā,
[4083] The expanse of view's non-negation,
[4084] The expanse of conduct's non-affirmation—gathered as three.
[4085] That also gathered in five thousand name-affixed tantras.


### PAGE 111

[4086] That also gathered into eleven thousand chapters,
[4087] That also gathered into twenty-two hundred ślokas,
[4088] That also gathered into eleven thousand enumerations,
[4089] That also gathered into two bundles of distinctions,
[4090] That also gathered into five hundred summaries,
[4091] That also gathered into one thousand essential points,
[4092] That also gathered into fifty-one sharp nails,
[4093] That also gathered into two emanations of meditation's presence and absence,
[4094] And that, when made the vessel of the category,
[4095] Is called the Great Expanse's vessel, gathered into three categories.
[4096] And that is gathered into the two: command and treatise,
[4097] And those are gathered as the Mind Category.
[4098] The categories of the Expanse are gathered into three expanses:
[4099] The expanse of meditation's presence,
[4100] The expanse of self-nature's non-finding,
[4101] The expanse of characteristic's non-distinction—gathered as three.
[4102] That also gathered into three thousand name-affixed tantras,
[4103] And that gathered into eleven thousand chapters,
[4104] Those also gathered into twenty-two hundred ślokas,
[4105] Those also gathered into eight thousand enumerations,
[4106] And that gathered into two thousand bundles of distinctions,
[4107] Those also gathered into nine hundred summaries,
[4108] Those also gathered into two thousand essential points,
[4109] Those also gathered into fifty sharp nails,
[4110] Those also: liberation through action,
[4111] Liberation through placement,
[4112] Liberation through exactness—gathered as three emanations.
[4113] That also gathered into the category of expanse.
[4114] All categories of instruction also gathered into three expanses:
[4115] The expanse of play's non-cessation,
[4116] The expanse of mind's non-liberation,
[4117] The expanse of essence's non-good-non-bad,
[4118] Those also gathered into twelve thousand name-affixed tantras,
[4119] And those gathered into fourteen thousand chapters,
[4120] Those also gathered into twenty-one ślokas,
[4121] Those also gathered into eleven thousand enumerations.


### PAGE 112

[4122] Those also gathered into four thousand distinctions,
[4123] Those also gathered into two thousand five hundred summaries,
[4124] That also gathered into eighty-seven sharp nails,
[4125] Those also gathered into essential points,
[4126] Essential points of seeing,
[4127] Essential points of knowing—gathered as three emanations.
[4128] That also gathered into the two: command and treatise.
[4129] Treatise: many,
[4130] Tantra,
[4131] Scripture,
[4132] And instruction treatise—gathered as three.
[4133] Instruction treatise: very many,
[4134] Debate,
[4135] Establishment,
[4136] Intention,
[4137] And chiefly taking the treatise of enumeration—gathered as four.
[4138] Enumeration too:
[4139] The enumeration of meaning and instruction,
[4140] The enumeration of abiding nature,
[4141] The enumeration of established view's words,
[4142] The enumeration of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa non-duality—gathered as four.
[4143] Those all: essential points emanating,
[4144] Summary gathering,
[4145] Pointing out,
[4146] Directly bringing to the essential point—gathered as three.
[4147] Those gathered as one: the great general summary of dharma, well explained.
[4148] From the Supreme Vehicle Jewel Treasury,
[4149] The thorough division of established views, the fourth chapter.
[4150] Thus establishing the general manner of dharma's enumeration,
[4151] Now explaining the unsurpassable vehicle in particular,
[4152] Through knowing the nature of the tantra section,
[4153] And the definite basis arising from that—these two must be realized.
[4154] The nature of the tantra section: three,
[4155] Briefly showing the summary of tantra,
[4156] Extensively explaining that nature,
[4157] The definite branches of explanation.
[4158] First: six,
[4159] The essence of tantra,
[4160] Definite terms,
[4161] Divisions,
[4162] Rising measures,
[4163] Examples,
[4164] Validities.
[4165] First, the essence of tantra:
[4166] Awareness and that certainty brought to certainty—the great secret, cannot add or remove, definite.
[4167] Definite terms:
[4168] For the purpose of indicating lineage, tantra,
[4169] Making whatever lineages arise—thus tantra,
[4170] Definite and unbroken middle, continuous—thus tantra.
[4171] Divided: the tantra of meaning and nature,
