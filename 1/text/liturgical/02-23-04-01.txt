[13304] First, the first of the five outer elements dissolves:
[13305] The five inner earth elements dissolve into the five outer earth elements, whereby the body's power is lost and memory declines.


### PAGE 311

[13306] The five water elements dissolve into water, whereby the body's fluids drip, and in that silk-like moment the mouth and nose become dry while the eyes roll upward.
[13307] The five fire elements dissolve into fire, whereby the body's heat rises, memory ceases, and the lamp is no longer seen.
[13308] The five wind elements dissolve into wind, whereby the body's luster fades and breath becomes rough, ceasing in that silk-like moment.
[13309] Then the manner of the inner elements dissolving is thus:
[13310] The five space elements dissolve into the sphere of awareness; at that time, the face is grasped.
[13311] Then, the manner of the extremely clear five inner elements dissolving into the five secret elements:
[13312] The subtle aspect of the five elements dissolves into the life-force,
[13313] And the five life-forces enter into the awareness at the heart center:
[13314] The light-channel and
[13315] The hollow space within it and
[13316] The bindu and
[13317] The five lights—one's own body as awareness possessing the mansion of light—dissolve.
[13318] Then, those five secret elements first abiding as the life-wind, the great perfectly complete elements, the basis-appear as self-resounding awareness, the heart-center possessing self-nature as light-power, awareness possessing the mansion of light,
[13319] Possessing objects of limitless light,
[13320] Dissolve together with the appearance of the four lamps,
[13321] The Dharmakaya bardo self-resounding outwardly clear appearing aspect alone is made,
[13322] Outer and inner dharmas impure, separated from the aspect of samsara,
[13323] Awareness reverts from the basis,
[13324] Arriving at the original primordially pure self-sphere.
[13325] Special among these: at the time of the inner elements dissolving into the outer elements,
[13326] When earth dissolves into earth: the power of emptiness emerges, wisdom latent.
[13327] The clear wisdom latent in the power of awareness, wisdom unable to appear as the Path.
[13328] When water dissolves into water: wisdom moistens, latent in the state of awareness, water flows from mouth and nose.
[13329] That also, awareness wisdom clear and dim not, although power unable to appear outwardly, awareness latent.
[13330] When fire dissolves into fire: although primordially self-awareness abides as the essence of wisdom,
[13331] At that time, wind enters inward, power unable to appear outwardly.
[13332] When wind dissolves into wind: awareness power complete, not abiding in objects.


### PAGE 312

[13333] When the body's power is lost: because wisdom qualities are latent.
[13334] When space dissolves into space, awareness dissolves into the bardo: the time of wisdom grasping its own ground.
[13335] Self-appear awareness to appearance,
[13336] Free from binding with lump and binding-agent, because near.
[13337] That body, inner basis-appear spontaneous aspect, at that time this is called the bardo.
[13338] The five elements dissolve where the lump with binding-agent,
[13339] And awareness abiding in its own clear self-ground, because it is the interval.
[13340] Therefore, when abiding in the body, relying on the heart's inner power, that Dharma-nature self-resounding, arises from the path of the eye from the body, emerging.
[13341] Although called by the symbol "Dharmakaya bardo,"
[13342] Together with awareness self-resounding, from other arises nothing at all, and
[13343] That same inner dissolving-setting time, primordially pure self-ground grasping alone, from other does not exist.
[13344] These inner elements are slightly difficult: explained separately.
[13345] The remainder scripture itself knows, therefore here not explained separately.
[13346] That also,
<tantra> [13347] From Awareness Self-Arisen:
[13348] Ho! Friends, beings, great cavity transference:
[13349] Outer elements dissolve into inner elements,
[13350] Inner elements dissolve into secret elements,
[13351] Secret elements dissolve into perfectly complete elements, entering the great Path; at that time, know thus.
</tantra>
[13352] Then, as signs of the inner five elements dissolving outward, know thus:
[13353] Earth dissolves into earth,
[13354] Water dissolves into water,
[13355] Fire dissolves into fire,
[13356] Wind dissolves into wind,
[13357] Space dissolves into space.
[13358] That also, earth dissolving into earth has two aspects:
[13359] Outer earth dissolving into inner earth, and
[13360] Inner earth dissolving into outer earth.
[13361] The time of outer earth dissolving into inner earth is:
[13362] The first time.
[13363] The inner five elements dissolving outward
[13364] Time is: inner earth dissolving into outer earth sign, the body's power is lost.
[13365] That also is thus:
[13366] The sign of earth dissolving where all appears: outer consciousness dulls.
[13367] The sign of unchanging vajra earth dissolving: the body's power is lost.


### PAGE 313

[13368] The sign of all-arising precious earth dissolving: declining in capacity, unable to rise.
[13369] The sign of appearance-revealing Samantabhadra earth dissolving: losing perfectly complete power, intention unclear.
[13370] The sign of accomplishment-completing earth dissolving: the lamp's appearance ceases.
[13371] The sign of inner water dissolving into outer water: water unable to be held.
[13372] That also is thus:
[13373] The sign of unchanging water dissolving: water dripping from mouth and nose.
[13374] The sign of peaceful clear pure water dissolving: unable to hold water from the secret place.
[13375] The sign of quality-arising spreading water dissolving: eyes rolling upward.
[13376] The sign of attachment-free water dissolving: mouth and nose dry.
[13377] The sign of grasping-free perfectly complete water dissolving: ears unable to hear sound.
[13378] The sign of inner fire dissolving into outer fire: the body's heat is lost.
[13379] That also, know thus:
[13380] The sign of all-pervading outer-inner fire dissolving: inner heat lost, consciousness unclear.
[13381] The sign of outer-inner equal fire dissolving: secret heat lost.
[13382] The sign of outer-inner activity realizing fire dissolving:
[13383] Perfectly complete heat lost.
[13384] The sign of outer-inner activity accomplishing fire dissolving: the empty lamp is not seen.
[13385] The sign of inner wind dissolving into outer wind: the body's power is lost.
[13386] That also, know thus:
[13387] The sign of luster-and-radiance-generating wind dissolving: body's luster lost.
[13388] The sign of fire-equal abiding wind dissolving: water dripping from the body.
[13389] The sign of life-holding wind dissolving: breath unable to be held.
[13390] The sign of all-pervading wind dissolving: body's luster and memory lost.
[13391] The sign of compassion-free karma wind dissolving: outer breath ceases.
[13392] That is called the outer element.
[13393] Space dissolving into space:


### PAGE 314

[13394] The space pervading all universally dissolves into the pure lamp.
[13395] The objectless clear space dissolves into awareness.
[13396] The unmixed pure space dissolves into the Expanse.
[13397] The meaning-indicating space dissolves into Prajña.
[13398] The space liberating into the pure realm dissolves into the twenty-one meanings.
[13399] That is called the inner element.
[13400] The root-holding life dissolves into the bindu.
[13401] The protecting life coalesces into space.
[13402] The extremely subtle life coalesces into the body.
[13403] The impure life dissolves into space.
[13404] The vibratory life dissolves into the Expanse.
[13405] That is called the secret element.
[13406] The pure-impure distinguishing wind dissolves into the sphere.
[13407] The heat-generating wind dissolves into light.
[13408] The clarifying-transforming wind dissolves into Sku.
[13409] The settling wind dissolves into Ye-shes.
[13410] The exhorting wind dissolves into compassion.
[13411] The consciousness-moving wind dissolves into emptiness.
[13412] The mind-releasing wind dissolves into non-dual.
[13413] The radiance-possessing wind dissolves into limit-free.
[13414] The burning wind dissolves into great bliss.
[13415] The agitated wind dissolves into clarity.
[13416] The basis-pervading wind dissolves into space-clarity.
[13417] The instant-pervading wind dissolves into depth-clarity.
[13418] The terrifying-pervading wind dissolves into objects.
[13419] The memory-pervading wind dissolves into the bardo.
[13420] The grasping body-all-pervading wind dissolves into self-appear.
[13421] The moving wind moves awareness in space.
[13422] The liberating wind separates from outer-inner dharmas.
[13423] The reversing wind reverses self-awareness into the basis.
[13424] The hastening wind sees the object of awareness.
[13425] The instantaneous wind brings one to the place of primordial purity in three instants.
[13426] That is the perfectly complete element.
[13427] Those persons not under the power of conditions thus engage the life-force.
[13428] Those not thus engaging the life-force:


### PAGE 315

[13429] Are called the transference method of Bodhisattvas,
[13430] Reborn possessing bliss in the birth realm.
[13431] To those exhausted of karma, not thus, know thus, it is taught.
[13432] Thus, through twenty-five winds, the five elements dissolve into the Expanse,
[13433] Samsara and nirvana liberated,
[13434] Performing the action of liberating nirvana into primordial purity,
[13435] By what is called "wind," all actions are performed—
[13436] Thus it is taught.
[13437] These are great essential points to be known.
[13438] These are called the bardo of death.
[13439] Third topic: extensive explanation of the Dharmakaya bardo instructions on trusting self-appear, meeting previous acquaintances, or entering the lap, in three parts:
<list> [13440] First: demonstrating abandonment through the manner of awareness dissolving into luminosity,
<list> [13441] Second: extensive explanation through the manner of luminosity self-appear arising,
<list> [13442] Third: summary of meaning through the manner of self-appear sense-power liberation.
[13443] First:
[13444] The five winds dissolving into the Expanse,
[13445] The heart center's three-tiered ye-shes sound entering the throat separated from the horse, power dissolving into self, mind and mind-originated all-basis together with samsara's dharmas all latent,
[13446] At that time when samsara-nirvana's back is turned, awareness, white silk from the channel-path, emerges from the water-lamp into the pure space of the Expanse, arising as self-appear,
[13447] From first liberation until completion through eight dissolution manners:
<tantra> [13448] From Self-Arisen:
[13449] To truth-seeing beings, know thus:
[13450] Sons of family, at the time of passing beyond sorrow,
[13451] The body's pair lost, ye-shes appearance rising from the basis,
[13452] Ye-shes moving in space,
[13453] Awareness emerging from the path of the eye, moving in space,
[13454] That also, know thus:
[13455] From the center of the heart, awareness dissolves into the bindu,
[13456] Bindu dissolves into lamp,
[13457] Lamp dissolves into light,
[13458] Light dissolves into Sku,
[13459] Sku dissolves into sphere,
[13460] Sphere dissolves into four ye-shes,
[13461] Ye-shes dissolves into spontaneous presence,
[13462] Spontaneous presence dissolves into great primordial purity, grasping the ground.
</tantra>

### PAGE 316
[13463] Thus appears the liberation manner and dissolution manner of truth-seeing persons.
[13464] That also, these pure ye-shes appearances do not appear to those who, in an instant from the body, transmigrate to existence and other grounds,
[13465] To others, although briefly appearing, duration short, like a swift dream, without essence, fading away, unrecognized.
[13466] Even for truth-seeing ones, if accustomed to direct perception, appearance duration long, having only the abundance of liberation-appearance,
[13467] Although directly seen, if not particularly cultivated in that, that state's realm portion without that capacity, like a shooting star, completing in but a moment, as taught,
[13468] Therefore, now, familiarity with thogel concentration is essential.
<tantra> [13469] From Sun Moon Union:
[13470] Possessing the essence of empty clarity,
[13471] Possessing the essence of clear awareness,
[13472] Possessing the mansion of awareness light,
[13473] Familiarity with the four lamps is essential.
</tantra>
[13474] Thus.
[13475] Second, extensive explanation of luminosity self-appear arising manner in five parts:
<list> [13476] First: basis-appear luminosity appearance,
<list> [13477] Second: union sphere appearance,
<list> [13478] Third: four ye-shes joining appearance,
<list> [13479] Fourth: precious spontaneous presence appearance,
<list> [13480] Extensive explanation of essential pith instructions liberating into those.
[13481] First:
<tantra> [13482] From Thalgyur:
[13483] Here the Dharmakaya bardo is explained.
[13484] From death, at the time of falling,
[13485] Consciousness dissolves into pure space,
[13486] When space dissolves into luminosity,
[13487] All subtle and coarse appearances cease,
[13488] The light-body possessing all senses,
[13489] Transforms according to karma and latent tendencies.
[13490] At this time, at the time of light-appearance fragments,
[13491] The wise grasp the spreading appearance,
[13492] Moving with wind, spreading,
[13493] Five-by-five colored lights and rays,
[13494] Uncertain, appearing as rainbow patterns.
</tantra>
[13495] Thus,
[13496] Awareness not abiding, emerging, appearing in space,
[13497] Within the expanse of awareness, five ye-shes winds existing, spreading, luminosity appearance appearing as rainbow patterns, filling space,
[13498] Five ye-shes individually clear, unmixed self-resoundings,
[13499] Mirror-like ye-shes, primordially pure of stain, self-resounding white clearly appearing, also not mixed with the other four, clear in its own place:
[13500] At the bardo time, in the eastern direction, by oneself—


### PAGE 317

[13501] At the time of capacity, one's own forward direction is one's own place,
[13502] From that, rays self-pure and
[13503] Intertwined and
[13504] Direct and
[13505] Spreading like sun-rays from the eastern direction, and
[13506] The entity of equality ye-shes, spontaneous presence qualities complete without ceasing, yellow self-resounding,
[13507] At the bardo time, clear in the southern self-place, rays as above spreading, and
[13508] At the time of appearance increase, all those forward self-places,
[13509] Discriminating ye-shes, four powers arising without ceasing,
[13510] Red self-resounding from which rays as above spread, and
[13511] Accomplishing-action ye-shes, activity power primordially complete, green self-resounding,
[13512] From the northern self-place, rays as above spread, and
[13513] Dharmadhatu ye-shes, spontaneously accomplished Dharmakaya primordially complete, deep-blue self-resounding,
[13514] From the central self-place, rays as above spread.
[13515] At the time of capacity, all from forward self-place arising, appearance spreading,
[13516] From that, right, left, back, and above-below two, know.
[13517] Those five ye-shes self-resoundings also arise as the distinctive five Skus,
[13518] From those Skus, ye-shes light-rays spreading, one from another four finger-widths apart, not touching, white and
[13519] Yellow and
[13520] Red and
[13521] Green and
[13522] Deep-blue nature brilliantly shining, spreading in the ten directions:
[13523] Root subtle, tips vast, spontaneously thick, all appearances
[13524] Subtle and
[13525] Moving and
[13526] Trembling and
[13527] Flickering and
[13528] Shining,
[13529] The five lights' Expanse extremely vast, limitless, immeasurable, inconceivable,
[13530] Height high, tips vast, as the source of all mandalas, self-appear.
[13531] When seeing this appearance,
[13532] Consciousness abiding in natural absorption,
[13533] The essential pith instruction of recognizing spreading appearance as self-appear is supreme, and one should abide in that state.
[13534] If recognized here, liberated in three instants to the place of primordial purity:


### PAGE 318

[13535] First instant: recognition,
[13536] Second instant: liberation upon recognition,
[13537] Third instant: liberated, dissolving into primordial purity, after that no appearance whatsoever.
[13538] Those also, if scripture elaborates, beautiful to the wise,
[13539] And explained to open the eye of intelligence for the foolish.
<tantra> [13540] From Sun Moon Union:
[13541] Hey! Great thought-free Sage, listen!
[13542] Naturally pure appearance is thus:
[13543] The consciousness of beings dissolving into luminosity is called
[13544] Breath outer-inner travel severed immediately,
[13545] One's own senses
[13546] From portion appearing as thing, the consciousness thinking "fire exists" arises.
[13547] This body of lump-with-binding-agent not appearing,
[13548] Clearly as the light-body.
[13549] At that time, as much as becoming the sphere of sense activity,
[13550] Appearing as the mandala of five light-rays.
[13551] That also, those appearances, seen from outside, inside clear; seen from inside, outside clear.
[13552] Without outer-inner, all-pervading transparent,
[13553] Like a mirage,
[13554] Like fire,
[13555] Pressed, seeming to sink,
[13556] Lifted, seeming to leap,
[13557] Extremely captivating,
[13558] Clearly as colors, self-clear without individual mixing,
[13559] Equal portion, clarity portion not ceasing,
[13560] Truly seen, extremely subtle and
[13561] Moving and
[13562] Trembling like and
[13563] Flickering like and
[13564] Brilliantly shining, majestically spontaneous.
[13565] Extremely vast,
[13566] Without reckoning or object not entered,
[13567] Height high, tips vast, thus called,
[13568] Abiding as the source of all mandalas.
[13569] That also, colors are five:
[13570] White clear in self-place, rays spreading, and
[13571] Likewise yellow clear in self-place, rays spreading, and
[13572] Red clear in self-place, rays spreading, and
[13573] Green itself clear in self-place, rays spreading, and
[13574] Likewise deep-blue itself clear in self-place, rays spreading,
[13575] Those also, not touching in contact, individually self-clear as colors,
</tantra>

### PAGE 319
[13576] Extremely spontaneously thick abiding, thus taught.
[13577] Some persons not delighting in scripture are known as foolish, without intelligence.
[13578] The wise are especially made by scripture.
[13579] Second, extensive explanation of union sphere appearance:
<tantra> [13580] From Thalgyur:
[13581] From entering and maturing wind,
[13582] Four directions, directions, above-below accomplished.
[13583] There, gathered directional light,
[13584] Five families Sku also clearly appear.
[13585] Deep-blue, white, yellow, red, green,
[13586] Appearing together with individual consorts.
[13587] If spreading and grasping known in this,
[13588] The qualities of the Buddhas complete,
[13589] Not entering the three realms.
[13590] That characteristic thus:
[13591] Coarse elements free from dependency,
[13592] From light, bindu-pair blazing,
[13593] Five bindus connected, Skus filling,
[13594] From half-Sku, forms complete.
[13595] From form-half-Sku, five-by-five pairs,
[13596] Individual spheres complete,
[13597] Five-possessing, ten-possessing, hundred-possessing,
[13598] Spheres thousand, hundred-thousand,
[13599] Naturally pure in thought-scope,
[13600] Inexpressible, numberless.
[13601] If self and other known in this,
[13602] Obtaining the Three Skus condensed as one,
[13603] From this obtaining, no turning back.
[13604] Arisen from clarity-bestowal.
</tantra>
[13605] Thus,
[13606] In this, cause from what spreading,
[13607] From bindu, sphere appearance, essential pith instruction of non-reversal, demonstrated in three parts:
[13608] The cause is the former ye-shes wind entering objects, by that power, that same luminosity appearance here spreading as union sphere appearance.
[13609] The meaning of union: that awareness self-light spontaneously spreading, and
[13610] Dharmakaya mother's five luminosities, Sambhogakaya realm-appearance primordially existing as path-appearance, two meeting at the time at awareness's face, recognition, inseparably entering as one.
[13611] At that time, released from the binding of all-basis appropriation,


### PAGE 320

[13612] Dharmakaya eye seeing Dharmakaya appearance as self-system, entering that, and
[13613] Sambhogakaya ye-shes eye seeing awareness-son appearance, self-face inseparably entering, and
[13614] Former cultivated Prajña arising there, Prajña eye joining those two inseparably,
[13615] Mother-son inseparably abiding, ye-shes union dissolving, thus called.
[13616] Second:
[13617] Those light-ray tips, five bindus subtle bindus connected arising within, first from half-Sku alone, and
[13618] Father-mother, and
[13619] From five-by-five spheres,
[13620] Arising as individual family mandalas.
[13621] Those Skus also, principal-retinue portion diminished, light-sphere mutually measureless within, principals not greater or lesser,
[13622] Retinue retinue, one from another not greater or lesser,
[13623] Principals thirty-two cubits,
[13624] Retinue half-half of that appearing.
[13625] Five families individual gods, crown ornament and
[13626] Neck ornament and
[13627] Shoulder ornament and
[13628] Breast ornament and
[13629] Armlet and
[13630] Hand ornament and
[13631] Foot ornament and
[13632] Upper garment and
[13633] Lower garment, etc., adorned.
[13634] Possessing light eye ear, face hand complete.
[13635] Vairocana and
[13636] Akshobhya and
[13637] Ratnasambhava and
[13638] Amitabha and
[13639] Amoghasiddhi and
[13640] Consort Dharmadhatu Ishvari and
[13641] Mamaki and
[13642] Buddha Lochana and
[13643] Pandaravasini and
[13644] Samaya Tara, equally engaging,
[13645] Deep-blue and
[13646] White and
[13647] Yellow and
[13648] Red and
[13649] Green color shining.
[13650] Supreme enlightenment and
[13651] Earth-pressing and
[13652] Refuge-giving and
[13653] Equipoise and
[13654] Sel-gol mudra.
[13655] Wheel and
[13656] Vajra and
[13657] Jewel and
[13658] Lotus and
[13659] Crossed-vajra holding,
[13660] Feet in vajra-posture,
[13661] Individual family mandalas' center, family lord father-mother, four directions Akshobhya etc. Buddhas father-mother,


### PAGE 321

[13662] Eight directions Maitreya etc. Bodhisattvas eight and
[13663] Lasya etc. goddesses eight and
[13664] Ankusha etc. gatekeepers and gate-goddesses,
[13665] Families' mandalas measureless, five Buddhas:
[13666] Lion and elephant and
[13667] Horse and
[13668] Peacock and
[13669] Garuda throne above extremely clear, sun moon and lotus above, abiding in vajra-posture.
[13670] Bodhisattvas goddesses upon lotus sun moon, abiding in half-posture,
[13671] Gatekeepers abiding in standing manner.
[13672] From each of those, from self-Sku, measureless light-ray assemblies spreading,
[13673] Apart from those, outer five-light border sphere, five ye-shes light-rays surrounding,
[13674] Vairocana etc. individual sphere mandalas complete,
[13675] Completion manner:
[13676] Vairocana's spheres within light-sphere, Vairocana father-mother heart-center complete,
[13677] Those directions' gods heart-centers mandala complete each from,
[13678] Vajra family ones Akshobhya and
[13679] Jewel family ones Ratnasambhava and
[13680] Lotus family ones Amitabha and
[13681] Action family ones Amoghasiddhi father-mother retinue heart-centers outer-inner transparent complete,
[13682] Five light-spheres connected, five families sphere Skus five groups' heart-centers,
[13683] That family's sphere mandala Buddhas and Bodhisattvas goddesses gatekeepers together each complete.
[13684] At this time, although self has no self-marked body, thinking "exists" is like a dream from former body's self-grasping habitual pattern power,
[13685] Habitual pattern seeds not exhausted until, light,
[13686] Self-nature at that time existing as light-body,
[13687] Heart center awareness possessing realm-appearance sound, outward spreading,
[13688] Each Sku's heart-center sphere mandala clearly appearing, like mirror face arising.
[13689] At that time, from all those Sambhogakayas' heart-centers, horse-drum-tip light-rays from ten directions to self heart-center entering, and


### PAGE 322

[13690] From self heart-center also to those heart-centers entering:
[13691] Demonstrating the connection of self-resounding,
