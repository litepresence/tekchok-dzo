[9713] First: these various outer white-red appearances, clear in expanse gathered by five elements of container-contents,
[9714] Except appearing on face of self-mind's delusion, outer meaning thing,
[9715] And inner mind's thing, both not established,
[9716] Should understand as like deluded hair-shadow and dream illusion appearance, nature of clear-appear without base-without empty miracle.
[9717] From Six Expanses:
[9718] All appearance is illusion,
[9719] Like dream and reflection.


### PAGE 228

[9720] Thus it is spoken.
[9721] From Root Wisdom:
[9722] Like dream, like illusion,
[9723] Like gandharva city,
[9724] Like-that arising and like-that abiding,
[9725] Like-that also not destroyed. Thus it is spoken.
[9726] Appearing to mind whatever appears,
[9727] Like appearance to impure sense-power of eye-defect's hair-shadow.
[9728] From that same source:
[9729] To mind itself existing as object,
[9730] Various appearances self-arise.
[9731] Name and color individually
[9732] Complete as two aspects of form.
[9733] Thus it is spoken.
[9734] Though appearing to mind, these outer-clear appearance manners are not self's mind,
[9735] Existing also without self,
[9736] Abiding as field,
[9737] Color,
[9738] Because seeing as shape etc.
[9739] Not mind because those do not exist in mind.
[9740] Here, giving introduction like dream delusion of clear-appear, not existing: these appearances of outer appearance fields like form etc.,
[9741] "This is form,"
[9742] Thinking color etc., arising-arising, first the appearance-field of arising, holding that is called "mind of appearance,"
[9743] Called "mind of grasping,"
[9744] Having seized essence, called "mind of field."
[9745] Questioning if that mind of appearance exists: not true by holding clear-appear without field,
[9746] Also not existing by color not established as essence seize,
[9747] Also not existing by examining in three: arise, cease, abide.
[9748] Called "giving introduction of mind itself as empty,"
[9749] Give introduction as wisdom Buddha without self-dissolving place.
[9750] Therefore ordinary Dharma and
[9751] Great perfect ordinary's appearance,
[9752] Not separating appearance field,
[9753] Desiring outer appearance field self-characteristic as mind
[9754] Is mistake into odor-with various-true mind-only.
[9755] Here, at time of giving introduction of appearance as mind, mind holding as appear-not-appear,
[9756] Mind of appearance to mind first meeting field,
[9757] After, examining that distinction as mental event, desiring called "mind of holding,"
[9758] Called "samsara: delusion-hold, delusion-appear, purify, abandon."
[9759] 


### PAGE 229

[9760] In two truths,
[9761] Of mind and mental-event, three realms',
[9762] Superimposing aspect is concept.
[9763] Thus it is spoken.
[9764] From Treasury:
[9765] "Concept and examine coarse-subtle."
[9766] Thus explained as abandonment, entering together all meaning—this great essential point should be realized by those possessing supreme holy wisdom intelligence.
[9767] Also, need one like this for meeting baseless outer-inner.
[9768] Second, establishing secret space by inner mind's essential point:
[9769] When not seizing essence by examining mind,
[9770] Not becoming like inert,
[9771] Though declaring not knowing spread-spread clear without essence seize,
[9772] Give introduction as inner Dharma-space of Dharma-ceasing, arising primordially pure, stain-free space of self-clear empty self-tone manner,
[9773] Realization of limit-free, stain-free arises from within.
[9774] Seeing also secondary appearance of luminosity space-appear by familiarizing in that manner.
[9775] From Introduction Ornament:
[9776] By empty not-existing from-beginning,
[9777] Element self-ceasing, light-appearance ray.
[9778] By empty free of action-agent,
[9779] Obtain light-appearance indicating three bodies.
[9780] Thus it is spoken.
[9781] Third, establishing supreme awareness by secret space's essential point:
[9782] That mind-pure empty in space is not mere empty extreme,
[9783] Clear — snap,
[9784] Give introduction to Dharma-body free from stain, wisdom of awareness by individual self-clear self-clear.
[9785] Not going to extreme from awareness portion,
[9786] Not going to eternal by thing not-existing,
[9787] Placed in decided manner in great vast limit-free expanse of not-two-both and not-two-both by nowhere declaring.
[9788] Self-appear awareness self-tone nadi-thread with bindu.
[9789] From that same source:
[9790] By awareness abiding in base,
[9791] Meet space of gathered Dharma-nature.
[9792] By awareness holding characteristic,
[9793] Meet pure complete space.
[9794] By nadi-thread awareness,
[9795] Meet light space of nature.
[9796] Thus it is spoken.
[9797] Thus giving introduction to baseless appearance field.


### PAGE 230

[9798] Transcend samsara of appearance field's container-contents.
[9799] Giving introduction of appearance as mind,
[9800] Knowing object of self-dissolving arise-liberate.
[9801] Giving introduction of mind itself as empty,
[9802] Cut root of grasp-hold delusion.
[9803] Giving introduction of empty as space-awareness,
[9804] Rolling experience of three bodies into one,
[9805] For obtaining perfect Buddha in one life,
[9806] Demonstrating introduction of delusion reversing manner from mind as very important.
[9807] By example introduction:
[9808] Meaning of wisdom of awareness existing in self,
[9809] Demonstrating sign confidence by awakening mind's lamp.
[9810] From that same source:
[9811] Holding measure of all Buddhas,
[9812] Examine example wisdoms.
[9813] Holding measure of sign wisdom,
[9814] Examine lamp of empty bindu.
[9815] Holding measure of meaning wisdom,
[9816] Examine clear manifest appearance.
[9817] Thus it is spoken.
[9818] Briefly summarized:
[9819] Outer appearance field baseless,
[9820] Giving introduction of mind of holding that appearance as empty,
[9821] Knowing samsara delusion as one groundless,
[9822] Not sufficient by that,
[9823] Giving introduction manifestly to meaning of root awareness, giving introduction without gathering-separation of space-awareness,
[9824] Instruction to supreme excellent intelligences: should deliver to primordially pure Dharma-body.
[9825] Second meaning: introduction of self-appear wisdom has two aspects:
[9826] Distinction of sense-power of instruction object,
[9827] And sequence of instruction introduction.
[9828] First:
[9829] Dividing best, middle, and last three sense-powers into sevens makes twenty-one.
[9830] Those all also: wisdom,
[9831] Purification,
[9832] Different liberation.
[9833] First, called "best":
[9834] Portion of wisdom and realization.
[9835] Also dividing that, seven:
[9836] Best's last and
[9837] Best's middle and
[9838] Best's best and
[9839] Best's advanced and
[9840] Best's supreme and
[9841] Best's peak and
[9842] Best's end reaching.
[9843] Placing those all from portion of easily realizing self-appear.
[9844] Also seven for middle:
[9845] Middle's last and


### PAGE 231

[9846] Middle's middle and
[9847] Middle's best and
[9848] Middle's advanced and
[9849] Middle's supreme and
[9850] Middle's peak and
[9851] Middle's end reaching.
[9852] Likewise, also seven for last:
[9853] Last's last and
[9854] Last's middle and
[9855] Last's best and
[9856] Last's supreme and
[9857] Last's advanced and
[9858] Last's peak and
[9859] Last's peak complete.
[9860] Second:
[9861] Thus twenty-one sense-powers arise, twenty-one introductions also arise.
[9862] That also, from individually giving introduction, two:
[9863] Common distinction,
[9864] Distinct indicative manner.
[9865] First:
[9866] To three: light, wisdom, awareness,
[9867] Giving introduction as seven groups.
[9868] From Vajra-Mind Heart Mirror Tantra:
[9869] Awareness transcends from base,
[9870] Should know twenty-one introductions—example meaning introduction etc.—for making known entering path.
[9871] Snow or
[9872] Conch or
[9873] One crystal without stain arising from ocean:
[9874] Extend to window's appearance,
[9875] Five colors of light spontaneously arise.
[9876] Also, what are those?
[9877] Blue color and
[9878] White and
[9879] Yellow and
[9880] Red and
[9881] Green.
[9882] That person following one crystal: hold right eye with right hand,
[9883] Place on eye's top, appearance will be seen; block left eye with left hand.
[9884] That is example introduction.
[9885] Meaning thus abides in self's heart center.
[9886] That is meaning introduction.
[9887] Press eye with self's thumb, sign: bindu of light arises like fish eye.
[9888] That is sign introduction.
[9889] Dharma-body introduction:
[9890] Apply to sun mandala.
[9891] Enjoyment complete body introduction:
[9892] Place Thus-come body drawn on cloth before self,
[9893] Place crystal on eye's top,
[9894] Look eye to sky,
[9895] Enjoyment complete body possessing mouth, eye, ear will be seen.
[9896] 


### PAGE 232

[9897] Giving introduction to emanation body:
[9898] Make know essence: dharma-possessor appearing as sign is miracle of self-awareness.
[9899] Make know as mass of self's light rays on Dharma day.
[9900] Make know essence without abandoning this interior of concept habit-continuum.
[9901] That is emanation body's introduction.
[9902] That root bind method introduction of appearance arising in self-manner.
[9903] Thus seven aspects called "light introduction."
[9904] What is wisdom's introduction?
[9905] Examining essence of copper vessel: introduction of Dharma space's wisdom.
[9906] Fill copper vessel well with water,
[9907] Place clear-making mirror on eye's top, look:
[9908] Bindu and
[9909] Arising as bindu particle manner,
[9910] Also from that, light and
[9911] Emanate like weapon point.
[9912] That is Dharma space's wisdom introduction.
[9913] What is mirror-like wisdom's introduction?
[9914] Draw dust-color mandala between two silver mirrors,
[9915] Place mirror each on two near sides comparing interval,
[9916] From that, two appearances arise.

[9920] Seize essence on lamp.
[9921] Introduction of action-accomplishing wisdom:

[9923] Introduction of non-abiding wisdom:
[9924] Seize essence by sky rainbow.
[9925] Introduction of completely complete wisdom:

[9930] Place one wearing white clothes before self,
[9931] Place jewel on eye's top,
[9932] Extend eye to sky and look.

[9947] Introduction of awareness not abiding in anything:
[9948] Should know by looking eye to space-between.
[9949] Thus seven are awareness's introduction.
[9950] Having completed twenty-one thus,
[9951] At the time when that Buddha-family son passes from nirvana,
[9952] Awareness arises from eye path, enters intermediate appearance. Thus it is spoken.
[9953] Second, two aspects of distinctive indicative manner:
[9954] Briefly demonstrating introduction's condensation,
[9955] And extensively separating that nature.
[9956] First:
[9957] Demonstrate confidence-indicative example of seven last sense-powers by seven introductions to light and wisdom,
[9958] Body and

### PAGE 236

[10132] To all middling elaboration: at light, two—interior light and outer appearance.
[10133] At wisdom, three—essence, nature, compassion.
[10134] At body: self-single, father-mother.
[10135] Three collections.
[10136] At bindu: three—base, path, fruit.
[10137] At awareness: three—base-abiding, characteristic-holding, field-appearance.
[10138] At space: two—outer, inner; demonstrating by sixteen enumeration of introduction.
[10139] To all small elaboration: three—example, meaning, sign.
[10140] To all very free from elaboration: meeting essence by manifest single appearance.
[10141] From that same source:
[10142] For purpose of all great ones,
[10143] By twenty-one introductions,
[10144] Gather that from outer to inner.
[10145] Also gathered: these all.
[10146] At light, two; at wisdom, three.
[10147] At body, three demonstrated; at bindu, three.
[10148] Awareness, three; at space, two.
[10149] For meaning of gathering those all.
[10150] Very gathered: these all.
[10151] By three: example, sign, meaning,
[10152] Obtain fruit of abiding self-nature.
[10153] Enter god's yogin mudra,
[10154] For meaning of sign-possessing.
[10155] Intention of single elaboration-free:
[10156] Free holding of all those.
[10157] Make ripening having ripened as path.
[10158] To abiding by manifest continuum,
[10159] By self seeing self heart-essence,
[10160] What do by all other efforts?
[10161] Should familiarize with this itself.
[10162] Thus it is spoken.
[10163] Abandoning inner scriptural contradiction:
[10164] From Jewel Intricate Display:
[10165] Alas, Buddha-family son, after I completely pass from nirvana,
[10166] At the time of five hundred degenerations,
[10167] By those possessing deceiving child's nature,
[10168] The time arises of making confidence in Buddha's intention through example.
[10169] At that time, this secret tantra of self arises.
[10170] True awareness itself cannot be demonstrated by example.
[10171] To five lights of nature existing as self-nature,
[10172] Though demonstrating five lights of image, will not become Buddha.


### PAGE 237

[10173] Question: Is example introduction not blocked?
[10174] That is: without seeing meaning of manifest awareness, mind-examining-holding—some say awareness's example is like this, like sky;
[10175] Some say different elements;
[10176] Some say light;
[10177] Demonstrate by god's body.
[10178] Common vehicle general,
[10179] Making only pure nature of low for some portions of outer-inner secret,
[10180] To negate base of primordially pure awareness,
[10181] Is spoken for negating grasping at thing's self-characteristic.
[10182] At this occasion demonstrating meaning of secret heart essence,
[10183] However much demonstrating example, no deviation,
[10184] No grasping place.
[10185] Those seeing manifest awareness, though introduction only as that's helper,
[10186] Again essence,
[10187] Expansion,
[10188] By dissolve manner, like crystal, great open primordially pure—demonstrate by crystal above pure,
[10189] With suitability.
[10190] That tantra also demonstrates this little, speaks thus.
[10191] From that same source:
[10192] Indicative example of Vajra-Mind:
[10193] White color, moon's color,
[10194] Etc., thus demonstrating awareness by three: example, sign, meaning,
[10195] Demonstrating birthless, ceaseless, open expanse.
[10196] Then this introduction suitable to sense-power:
[10197] With experience-taking hand-guidance,
[10198] Without deviation place, without stagnate place,
[10199] Ear lineage and hand gesture together,
[10200] Confidence,
[10201] Cutting superimposition,
[10202] Connecting word and meaning.
[10203] Supreme introduction spoken for demonstrating place of Buddha's Dharma lineage.
[10204] ### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[10205] Demonstrating by relying on difficult introduction of vajra place,
[10206] The twenty-first chapter.
[10207] Thus having extensively demonstrated sequence of taking experience,
