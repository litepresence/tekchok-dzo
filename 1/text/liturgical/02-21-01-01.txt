[9582] <ornament> First:</ornament>
[9583] <prose> Dividing best, middle, and last three sense-powers into sevens makes twenty-one.</prose>
[9584] <prose> Those all also: wisdom,</prose>
[9585] <prose> Purification,</prose>

[9864] <prose> To five lights of nature existing as self-nature,</prose>
[9865] <prose> Though demonstrating five lights of image, will not become Buddha. || 460 ||</prose>
[9866] <prose> Question: Is example introduction not blocked?</prose>
