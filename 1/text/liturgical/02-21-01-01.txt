00426| <prose> At space: two—outer, inner; demonstrating by sixteen enumeration of introduction.</prose>
00427| <prose> To all small elaboration: three—example, meaning, sign.</prose>
00428| <prose> To all very free from elaboration: meeting essence by manifest single appearance.</prose>
00429| <tantra> From that same source:</tantra>
00430| <verse> For purpose of all great ones, || 430 ||</verse>
00431| <verse> By twenty-one introductions,</verse>
00432| <verse> Gather that from outer to inner.</verse>
00433| <verse> Also gathered: these all.</verse>
00434| <verse> At light, two; at wisdom, three.</verse>
00435| <verse> At body, three demonstrated; at bindu, three.</verse>
00436| <verse> Awareness, three; at space, two.</verse>
00437| <verse> For meaning of gathering those all.</verse>
00438| <verse> Very gathered: these all.</verse>
00439| <verse> By three: example, sign, meaning,</verse>
00440| <verse> Obtain fruit of abiding self-nature. || 440 ||</verse>
00441| <verse> Enter god's yogin mudra,</verse>
00442| <verse> For meaning of sign-possessing.</verse>
00443| <verse> Intention of single elaboration-free:</verse>
00444| <verse> Free holding of all those.</verse>
00445| <verse> Make ripening having ripened as path.</verse>
00446| <verse> To abiding by manifest continuum,</verse>
00447| <verse> By self seeing self heart-essence,</verse>
00448| <verse> What do by all other efforts?</verse>
00449| <verse> Should familiarize with this itself.</verse>
00450| <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 450 ||</tantra>
00451| <ornament> Abandoning inner scriptural contradiction:</ornament>
00452| <tantra> From Jewel Intricate Display:</tantra>
00453| <prose> Alas, Buddha-family son, after I completely pass from nirvana,</prose>
00454| <prose> At the time of five hundred degenerations,</prose>
00455| <prose> By those possessing deceiving child's nature,</prose>
00456| <prose> The time arises of making confidence in Buddha's intention through example.</prose>
00457| <prose> At that time, this secret tantra of self arises.</prose>
00458| <prose> True awareness itself cannot be demonstrated by example.</prose>
00459| <prose> To five lights of nature existing as self-nature,</prose>
00460| <prose> Though demonstrating five lights of image, will not become Buddha. || 460 ||</prose>
00461| <prose> Question: Is example introduction not blocked?</prose>
00462| <prose> That is: without seeing meaning of manifest awareness, mind-examining-holding—some say awareness's example is like this, like sky;</prose>
00463| <prose> Some say different elements;</prose>
00464| <prose> Some say light;</prose>
00465| <prose> Demonstrate by god's body.</prose>
00466| <prose> Common vehicle general,</prose>
00467| <prose> Making only pure nature of low for some portions of outer-inner secret,</prose>
00468| <prose> To negate base of primordially pure awareness,</prose>
00469| <prose> Is spoken for negating grasping at thing's self-characteristic.</prose>
00470| <prose> At this occasion demonstrating meaning of secret heart essence, || 470 ||</prose>
00471| <prose> However much demonstrating example, no deviation,</prose>
00472| <prose> No grasping place.</prose>
00473| <prose> Those seeing manifest awareness, though introduction only as that's helper,</prose>
00474| <prose> Again essence,</prose>
00475| <prose> Expansion,</prose>
00476| <prose> By dissolve manner, like crystal, great open primordially pure—demonstrate by crystal above pure,</prose>
00477| <prose> With suitability.</prose>
00478| <prose> That tantra also demonstrates this little, speaks thus.</prose>
00479| <tantra> From that same source:</tantra>
00480| <prose> Indicative example of Vajra-Mind: || 480 ||</prose>
00481| <verse> White color, moon's color,</verse>
00482| <verse> Etc., thus demonstrating awareness by three: example, sign, meaning,</verse>
00483| <verse> Demonstrating birthless, ceaseless, open expanse.</verse>
00484| <prose> Then this introduction suitable to sense-power:</prose>
00485| <prose> With experience-taking hand-guidance,</prose>
00486| <prose> Without deviation place, without stagnate place,</prose>
00487| <prose> Ear lineage and hand gesture together,</prose>
00488| <prose> Confidence,</prose>
00489| <prose> Cutting superimposition,</prose>
00490| <prose> Connecting word and meaning. || 490 ||</prose>
00491| <prose> Supreme introduction spoken for demonstrating place of Buddha's Dharma lineage.</prose>
00492| <tantra> ### CITATION: From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,</tantra>
00493| <prose> Demonstrating by relying on difficult introduction of vajra place,</prose>
00494| <ornament> The twenty-first chapter.</ornament>
00495| <prose> Thus having extensively demonstrated sequence of taking experience,</prose>
00496| <prose> Now, demonstrating sequence of determining signs of yogin experience-taker has three aspects:</prose>
00497| <prose> Generally demonstrating meaning of how purifying signs in former life now abide in body, speech, mind;</prose>
00498| <prose> Explaining distinction of arising manner to three-door appearance possessing signs of now entering path.</prose>
