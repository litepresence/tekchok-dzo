### PAGE 25

[1252] To path-trained appearance manner;
[1253] Intermediate state appearance manner.
[1254] First:
[1255] Although light radiantly abides in oneself, to six realms not knowing own face, now lamp's self-light exists in subtle portions.
[1256] From that itself:
[1257] To all unrealized beings:
[1258] In humans, example-exists;
[1259] In gods, visible;
[1260] In demigods, subtly exists;
[1261] In animals, merely in own abode;

[1289] Field: Empty sky;
[1290] Light body:
[1291] Five kayas and four wisdoms' upward appearances.
[1292] Eye:

[1294] Essence:
[1295] All-clear, non-ceasing wisdom.
[1296] Example and simile: Like crystal,
[1297] Although five lights in ground-abiding self not clear, they exist as arising ground.
[1298] When conditions experientially taken and intermediate state lamp, ground-appearance fills sky with five lights.
[1299] Time: If experientially taken, can also appear in this life;
[1300] Intermediate state naturally arising time.
[1301] Liberation place: To first primordially pure jewel secret cavity,
[1302]
