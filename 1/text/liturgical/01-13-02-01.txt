[16274] <prose>First, the essence of the water lamp is this:</prose>
[16275] <prose>Through holding the parts of both samsara and nirvana, the power-support of the agent seeing pure appearance and deluded appearance is the clarity of light-essence, and the clarity relying on that is.</prose>
[16276] <tantra>From the tantra of the blazing jewel lamp of the beautiful gold flower:</tantra>
[16277] <tantra>Of the far-casting water lamp.</tantra>
[16278] <tantra>Through essence, both appearances gather.</tantra>
[16279] <tantra>Because the agent-holding part has not ceased.</tantra>
[16280] <tantra>Because through view, both parts are held.</tantra>
[16281] <tantra>Of the agreement view of samsara-nirvana.</tantra>
[16282] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[16283] <prose>Second, the definition is this: || 10 ||</prose>
[16284] <prose>The form-reflection of light-luminous clarity and deluded appearance, earth stone appearance, abide hold at far distant.</prose>
[16285] <prose>Through casting samsara's deluded appearance with deluded-thought far, it is far.</prose>
[16286] <prose>If not realized, nirvana also casts far, thus far.</prose>
[16287] <prose>When seeing self-appearance, through binding impure, to snare.</prose>
[16288] <prose>If not realized, through attachment to deluded-appearance, through binding self-awareness, also snare.</prose>
[16289] <prose>Similar with rope.</prose>
[16290] <prose>If examine rope also, like hair single one one bind benefit cannot do.</prose>
[16291] <prose>If not examined, like collection bind agent established.</prose>
[16292] <prose>If examine deluded-appearance and deluded-hold two, although ground-emptiness essence-empty.</prose>
[16293] <prose>If not examined, like confusion self-awareness binding-agent appear. || 20 ||</prose>
[16294] <prose>From bound appear time, bound not exist and.</prose>
[16295] <prose>From liberated appear time, through binding-agent self-characterized not exist, liberation not exist.</prose>
[16296] <prose>From magical-illusion.</prose>
[16297] <prose>Through anyone also not-bound, bound not exist.</prose>
[16298] <prose>Bind-agent object exist not exist.</prose>
[16299] <prose>Bound not exist completely untie not exist.</prose>
[16300] <prose>Primordial spontaneously-complete buddha-dharma.</prose>
[16301] <prose>Through teach purpose, emanate various make.</prose>
[16302] <prose>Thus speak like.</prose>
[16303] <prose>Furthermore, into vast self-appearance not-enter, through binding also noose. || 30 ||</prose>
[16304] <prose>Through not exist attachment to appearance, through moisten make inward samadhi bliss, water called.</prose>
[16305] <prose>Through rely also to gather water's essence, water called.</prose>
[16306] <prose>To power-consciousness, form-appearance clear and.</prose>
[16307] <prose>Through light-appearance increase upward arise, lamp called.</prose>

[16310] <prose>Thus also from burning-lamp.</prose>
[16311] <tantra>Definitive word this like-this.</tantra>
[16312] <tantra>Through hold distance far continuum.</tantra>
[16313] <tantra>Through hold form-as appear and. || 40 ||</tantra>
[16314] <tantra>Gather color etc and.</tantra>

[16333] <tantra>Not exist all to attachment-of mind. || 60 ||</tantra>
[16334] <tantra>Through set-by-means-of self-place appearance.</tantra>
