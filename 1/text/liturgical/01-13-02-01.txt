[16274] First, the essence of the water lamp is this:
[16275] Through holding the parts of both samsara and nirvana, the power-support of the agent seeing pure appearance and deluded appearance is the clarity of light-essence, and the clarity relying on that is.
[16276] <tantra> From the tantra of the blazing jewel lamp of the beautiful gold flower:</tantra>
[16277] Of the far-casting water lamp.
[16278] Through essence, both appearances gather.
[16279] Because the agent-holding part has not ceased.
[16280] Because through view, both parts are held.
[16281] Of the agreement view of samsara-nirvana.
[16282] Thus.
[16283] Second, the definition is this:
[16284] The form-reflection of light-luminous clarity and deluded appearance, earth stone appearance, abide hold at far distant.
[16285] Through casting samsara's deluded appearance with deluded-thought far, it is far.
[16286] If not realized, nirvana also casts far, thus far.
[16287] When seeing self-appearance, through binding impure, to snare.
[16288] If not realized, through attachment to deluded-appearance, through binding self-awareness, also snare.
[16289] Similar with rope.
[16290] If examine rope also, like hair single one one bind benefit cannot do.
[16291] If not examined, like collection bind agent established.
[16292] If examine deluded-appearance and deluded-hold two, although ground-emptiness essence-empty.
[16293] If not examined, like confusion self-awareness binding-agent appear.
[16294] From bound appear time, bound not exist and.
[16295] From liberated appear time, through binding-agent self-characterized not exist, liberation not exist.
[16296] From magical-illusion.
[16297] Through anyone also not-bound, bound not exist.
[16298] Bind-agent object exist not exist.
[16299] Bound not exist completely untie not exist.
[16300] Primordial spontaneously-complete buddha-dharma.
[16301] Through teach purpose, emanate various make.
[16302] Thus speak like.
[16303] Furthermore, into vast self-appearance not-enter, through binding also noose.
[16304] Through not exist attachment to appearance, through moisten make inward samadhi bliss, water called.
[16305] Through rely also to gather water's essence, water called.
[16306] To power-consciousness, form-appearance clear and.
[16307] Through light-appearance increase upward arise, lamp called.
[16308] Through not is produce base of space-awareness's appearance, mother called.
[16309] Through make also view's support base of essence-power form-possess, mother called.
[16310] Thus also from burning-lamp.
[16311] Definitive word this like-this.
[16312] Through hold distance far continuum.
[16313] Through hold form-as appear and.
[16314] Gather color etc and.
[16315] From distance far also awareness body.
[16316] Through make see agent hold and.
[16317] From samsara thought side.
[16318] Through throw distance outward, distance called.
[16319] Likewise from also not-realize side.
[16320] Through throw nirvana, distance is.
[16321] Likewise from samsara's appearance aspect.
[16322] Form and desire-object five.
[16323] Through this by bind, noose is.
[16324] To power-of appearance, appearance-of.
[16325] Through this by hold, memory thought self-as.
[16326] From distance hold, noose called.
[16327] Likewise to sky cloud free.
[16328] As awareness selfless body appear.
[16329] Into appearance vast not-enter.
[16330] Through this by hold, noose called.
[16331] To water appearance those.
[16332] And return self-place attachment.
[16333] Not exist all to attachment-of mind.
[16334] Through set-by-means-of self-place appearance.
[16335] Through free-by-means-of self-grasp, water called.
[16336] All lamp self-of appearance.
[16337] Through increase-by-means-of above from above.
[16338] Through pristine-awareness clear-by-means-of lamp awareness.
[16339] All element coarse-of appearance.
[16340] And not-exist cease self-know experience.
[16341] Through clear-by-means-of power-of self-door lamp.
[16342] Through set-by-means-of awareness outer-of space.
[16343] And pure self-place inner space.
[16344] Appearance.
[16345] Through produce-by-means-of this-by-means-of experience-of appearance.
[16346] Through mix-by-means-of space-race, also is mother.
[16347] Also power all-of essence.
[16348] Through is eye, arise make door.
[16349] Mother called, all-of base hold.
[16350] Thus.
[16351] Three divide if three.
[16352] From wind-of essence root ram-horn like, element gather-of distant-noose water-lamp.
[16353] Light-root essence pristine-awareness-of color hold, pristine-awareness gather-of distant-noose water-lamp.
[16354] Deluded-appearance not-hold.
[16355] Power five-of essence eye-of a-berry center in power-support essence form see make produce, deluded-appearance see, pristine-awareness appearance not-see, power gather-of distant-noose water-lamp.
[16356] That-also water-lamp actual pristine-awareness gather that is.
