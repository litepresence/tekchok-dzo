[17072] First, the essential nature:
[17073] The intention of all lamps as the object of knowledge—Dharmatā empty-luminous, self-abiding, together with the dynamic of knowledge.
[17074] Method: ground-hook;
[17075] Bindu;
[17076] By placing the three dimensions unmoving,
[17077] Within, self-awareness crystal-clear split, the intention of self-abiding together with the interval of knowledge filling the expanse.
[17078] From the Blazing Lamp:
[17079] "Self-arisen wisdom lamp—
[17080] Thus, of all lamps,
[17081] Since abiding as the object of knowledge, || 10 ||
[17082] By this exactly, in all parts,
[17083] By this discriminating wisdom exactly,
[17084] Abiding in the manner of non-discrimination.
[17085] As the nature producing subtle parts,
[17086] Abiding primordially from the beginning.
[17087] Thus it is spoken."
[17088] Second, the definitive meaning:
[17089] Within self-abiding effortless intention, when knowing the time of outer-appearance self-appearance completely obvious,
[17090] Knowing dharmas all universally empty and selfless,
[17091] Knowing the measures of one's own primordial wisdom—this is called knowledge. || 20 ||
[17092] "Excellent, by all difficult to realize intention, not sought, found from self, becoming the extremely superior summit"—thus.
[17093] "Primordially existing jewel found at self, called self";
[17094] Self-arisen, ceaselessly arising, called arisen;
[17095] Knowing dharmas clearly, called lamp.
[17096] Self-appearance pervading at self-face by awareness, not by knowledge, called not.
[17097] Again, from that exactly:
[17098] By knowledge, entity and non-entity,
[17099] Completely entering into all appearances,
[17100] And knowing the universal meanings,
[17101] Obtaining the confidence of not-sought, not-placed, || 30 ||
[17102] Knowing the measures of one's own primordial wisdom,
[17103] Dharmakāya of pure nature,
[17104] By self-awareness not finding the three,
[17105] Clearly appearing surpassing all excellence.
[17106] Since no basis for examination by others,
[17107] Object of primordially pure self-arisen,
[17108] Not object of other, called self.
[17109] By doing, this meaning not found;
[17110] Since hope not existing for whom,
[17111] Called primordially self-appearance arisen. || 40 ||
[17112] By lamp, all Dharmatā,
[17113] Making appear as non-dual,
[17114] Ma pervading self-face, thus.
[17115] Thus spoken, and
[17116] From the Pearl-Garland:
[17117] "For example, like a fire-lamp,
[17118] By knowledge, dharmas simultaneously realized;
[17119] Excellent, becoming the summit of all;
[17120] Self free from other-dependent dharmas;
[17121] Arisen, unblocked, spontaneously appearing." || 50 ||
[17122] Thus spoken.
[17123] Third, divided there are five:
[17124] Ground-abiding self-arisen wisdom;
[17125] Inner-abiding awareness of knowledge—abiding as arising-basis and support.
[17126] One-pointed-grasping-appearance wisdom;
[17127] Expansive awareness non-dual union's own time self-clear, stainless, pure, conveying intention to Dharmatā.
[17128] Memory ceaseless wisdom;
[17129] Arising without characteristic below, yet
[17130] Liberating self-face to Dharmatā as one.
[17131] Analytical wisdom; || 60 ||
[17132] Dharmas and dharmatās, self and universal aspects,
[17133] Characteristics, etc., appearing without confusion, knowing.
[17134] Three-engaging wisdom;
[17135] In this bardo of nature, by hearing, establishing definitively;
[17136] By thinking, determining;
[17137] By meditation, tasting, certainly liberating from saṃsāra—
[17138] Making realize word-meaning.
[17139] Again, from that exactly:
[17140] Divisions are five types:
[17141] By ground-abiding self-arisen wisdom, || 70 ||
[17142] Making supports of body, etc., dharmas;
[17143] By one-pointed-grasping-awareness,
[17144] Grasping support of expanse and awareness;
[17145] By memory-ceaseless wisdom,
[17146] Gathering objects, one-pointed knowledge;
[17147] By analytical wisdom,
[17148] Discriminating universal and self characteristics;
[17149] By three-engaging wisdom,
[17150] Establishing definitively in nature's bardo.
[17151] Thus it is spoken. || 80 ||
[17152] Fourth, the characteristic:
[17153] Knowing dharmas gathered by appearing objects and dharmas gathered by knowing awareness as without nature—this is the characteristic.
[17154] From that exactly:
[17155] "All dharmas appearing and not-appearing,
[17156] Who knows as without nature—
[17157] This is the characteristic."
[17158] Thus spoken, and
[17159] From the Condensed:
[17160] "Dhārmās completely transformed as without nature—
[17161] This is called supreme Prajñāpāramitā." || 90 ||
[17162] Thus spoken exactly.
[17163] Fifth, the gate of manifestation:
[17164] Five faculties—since the gate is that by power-awareness objects are measured as wisdom.
[17165] Particularly, from the nose, memory wisdom's horse wind moving—this exactly.
[17166] Fire wind wisdom's spark-like appearance at night, squeezing—know thus.
[17167] Again, from that exactly:
[17168] "Manifestation gate five faculties;
[17169] Particularly, from nose making manifest.
[17170] That sign at night time,
[17171] Groaning and fierce squeezing, || 100 ||
[17172] Extremely fierce body remaining,
[17173] Red blazing light rays,
[17174] Spreading like sparks—
[17175] By that measure and that sign,
[17176] Know the gate of manifestation."
[17177] Thus it is spoken.
[17178] Sixth, the field:
[17179] Citta on four channels of great distinction, grasped by wisdom's clarity-wind, not dispersing outward, internally self-abiding, only unclear,
[17180] By karma-wind outward-force moved, objects awareness-appeared.
[17181] That also, abiding in name-ground-gathered clarity, || 110 ||
[17182] Element,
[17183] Knowledge,
[17184] Fourfold clarity of wisdom-awareness.
[17185] From that exactly:
[17186] "From four producing channels,
[17187] Moving, shaking, dispersing,
[17188] Fire spark rising characteristic,
[17189] Five
[17190] Wisdom,
[17191] Karma, || 120 ||
[17192] From,
[17193] With wind,
[17194] Knowledge clear-clear, aware-aware;
[17195] Wisdoms' nature as
[17196] Flavor not-raw, all trembling,
[17197] Crystal tube hollow inside,
[17198] Clear, great wisdom abiding.
[17199] Name-four-gathered clarity,
[17200] As nature discriminating all,
[17201] Primordially abiding in body-parts, || 130 ||
[17202] Occasionally grasped by wind,
[17203] Knowledge memoryless, dull, yet
[17204] Wisdom powers expanded-contracted,
[17205] Clear part none, becoming dull.
[17206] When one's own wisdom-power moved,
[17207] Even dharmas not heard before,
[17208] Arise in mind, clearly appear.
[17209] Clear and unclear powers,
[17210] Arise from wind's movement alone,
[17211] Abiding in body-center channel-inside." || 140 ||
[17212] Thus it is spoken.
[17213] Seventh, the measure:
[17214] Ground-abiding wisdom's measure: abiding in heat-measure of equal-intention.
[17215] One-pointed-grasping wisdom's measure:
[17216] Expansive awareness mixed, obtaining self-power.
[17217] Memory-ceaseless wisdom's measure:
[17218] Liberating-arising without characteristic, gathering-dispersing exhausted, abiding in effortless spontaneous intention, conditions not moving awareness.
[17219] Analytical wisdom's measure:
[17220] Dualistic dharmas discriminated separately, establishing definitively.
[17221] Three-engaging wisdom's measure: || 150 ||
[17222] Realizing word-meaning, abiding in meaning's self-face.
[17223] Thus, from the Blazing Lamp:
[17224] "Ground-abiding wisdom self-arisen measure:
[17225] From equal-intention experience-arisen,
[17226] Obtained confidence of stable knowledge.
[17227] That itself, without change,
[17228] Always abiding in continuum, thus
[17229] By this, ground-abiding wisdom completed.
[17230] This body also light,
[17231] Knowledges clear. || 160 ||
[17232] One-pointed-grasping wisdom measure:
[17233] Resting-experience enjoyed signs,
[17234] Body-center five colors' light,
[17235] Without effort appearing outward,
[17236] By this knowledge self-place completed.
[17237] Body also not touching ground,
[17238] By this knowing where placed,
[17239] Material objects also able to melt.
[17240] Self-power trained measure.
[17241] Memory-ceaseless wisdom measure: || 170 ||
[17242] Knowledge not entering other,
[17243] Alone abiding, happy,
[17244] Always in secluded place,
[17245] Not desiring to be with people,
[17246] Knowledge becomes one-pointed.
[17247] Even others' spoken words,
[17248] Free from grasping as pair,
[17249] View unchanging, confidence,
[17250] Thinking going through space,
[17251] Mind placed there, ceases there, || 180 ||
[17252] Others' conditions also,
[17253] How could this be changed?
[17254] Carefree knowledge vast,
[17255] Person born to this,
[17256] Memory-ceaseless wisdom completed.
[17257] Analytical wisdom measure:
[17258] Ālaya and Dharmakāya also,
[17259] Thus discriminated, thus signs,
[17260] Body attachment mind free,
[17261] Awareness placed where placed, || 190 ||
[17262] Body becomes material,
[17263] Mind and wisdom discriminated,
[17264] Moving channels' gates also cease.
[17265] Element clear-obscure discriminated,
[17266] Coarse appearance self-liberated,
[17267] Happy like a weasel,
[17268] Thus saṃsāra-nirvāṇa discriminated,
[17269] Delusion thoughts impossible.
[17270] Even if arisen, without benefit-harm,
[17271] By such self-knowledge, || 200 ||
[17272] Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa established definitively—
[17273] Analytical thought wisdom.
[17274] Three-engaging wisdom measure:
[17275] All dharmas one word spoken,
[17276] Knowing that scripture,
[17277] Hearing wisdom measure completed.
[17278] By knowledge, what is thought,
[17279] That pair pleasantly arisen in continuum,
[17280] By thinking likewise trained,
[17281] Arisen, conditions not harming, || 210 ||
[17282] Deluded thought attachment self-liberated—
[17283] By this, meditation wisdom found."
[17284] Thus it is spoken.
[17285] Eighth, the harmonious example:
[17286] One for whom viewed objects appear and are realized, all afflictions burned—like fire blazing in tinder.
[17287] From the Blazing Lamp:
[17288] "For example, in dry tinder,
[17289] Even meeting subtle fire spark,
[17290] All tinder blazing, burned by fire,
[17291] By wisdom, habitual tendencies burned— || 220 ||
[17292] All this wisdom lamp."
[17293] Thus spoken, and
[17294] From the Condensed:
[17295] "By wisdom, knowing dharmas' nature completely,
[17296] Truly transcending the three realms."
[17297] Thus spoken exactly.
[17298] From the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle,
[17299] The presentation of the Four Lamps' sequence—thirteenth chapter.
[17300] Thus, having explained in detail the body-support and other gathered dharmas,
[17301] Now, establishing definitively the nature of knowledge depending on that—three: || 230 ||
[17302] Ālaya and Dharmakāya distinction;
[17303] Mind and wisdom distinction;
[17304] Explanation of other distinctive dharmas.
[17305] First, two:
[17306] Brief presentation and
[17307] Detailed explanation.
[17308] First:
[17309] Looking at sentient beings' ground and Buddhas' ground, the essential nature of awareness—primordially pure, stainless,
[17310] Obscured by defilement with ignorance and thought-gatherings, becoming ground of all delusion-appearance, delusion-grasping—
[17311] From the aspect of Ālaya and Dharmakāya as two types, know. || 240 ||
[17312] From the Thalgyur:
[17313] "Ālaya and Dharmakāya's crucial point."
[17314] Thus it is spoken.
[17315] There, Ālaya—made distinct by ignorance, support of all mind and mental-events' beginning,
[17316] Intermediate abiding,
[17317] Final home,
[17318] Become vessel of habitual tendencies—like a pond;
[17319] Dharmakāya—
[17320] Made distinct by reversed ignorance,
[17321] Transcended objects of mind and mental-events, || 250 ||
[17322] Pure from all karma and habitual tendencies.
[17323] Ālaya—
[17324] Like lower garment ground, become ground of downward appearance,
[17325] Various objects appearing as objects,
[17326] As subjects, six ignorance, three realms, appearing as container-contained, and its body,
[17327] Happiness-suffering,
[17328] Mind's delusion aspects, many contained;
[17329] Dharmakāya—
[17330] All that non-existing,
[17331] Not abiding together with mind, etc. || 260 ||
[17332] From Rangshar:
[17333] "To Ālaya concept-grasping,
[17334] Various deluded knowledge deceived;
[17335] Ālaya ignorance entity,
[17336] Called Ālaya to that.
[17337] Thus spoken, and
[17338] Again:
[17339] "Sentient beings' ground and Buddhas' ground,
[17340] Distinction by one difference determined.
[17341] Thus spoken, and || 270 ||
[17342] From the Pearl-Garland:
[17343] "Since Ālaya is accumulation,
[17344] Dharmakāya exhaustion of outflows;
[17345] Empty and clear, clear and pervasive,
[17346] Uncontrived by thought, memory clear;
[17347] Free from elaboration,
[17348] Pervading like space, empty;
[17349] Self-pure, free from all demonstrations,
[17350] Ālaya with causes and conditions,
[17351] Habitual tendencies, etc., like a pond; || 280 ||
[17352] Dharmakāya free from habitual tendencies,
[17353] From mind, mental-events, gatherings,
[17354] Embodied Ālaya appearing as many;
[17355] Dharmakāya free from mind, etc.,
[17356] Form-appearances many, bodies non-existing."
[17357] Thus it is spoken.
[17358] That also, Ālaya—
[17359]
[17360]
