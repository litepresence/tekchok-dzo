[17072] First: the essence.
[17073] The dynamic intention of knowledge of all lamps, together with the power of self-cognizing dharmatā, is empty-luminous self-abiding knowledge.
[17074] The method of the far-casting ground-hook,
[17075] The bindu,
[17076] Through placing the three dimensions unmoving,
[17077] The intention expanse-full of knowledge-interval, together with the interval of knowledge, is the self-abiding split crystal-clear within self-Awareness.
[17078] From the blazing lamp:



<tantra> [17079] The lamp of wisdom self-arisen,
<tantra> [17080] Of all lamps,
<tantra> [17081] Abiding as knowledge-intention,
<tantra> [17082] By this exactly at the part of all,
<tantra> [17083] Exactly by discriminating wisdom,
<tantra> [17084] Abiding as discriminating-nonexistent mode,
<tantra> [17085] As nature of subtle produce of part,
<tantra> [17086] Abiding from primordially.
<tantra> [17087] Thus it is spoken.



[17088] Second: the definitive meaning.
[17089] Knowing completely obvious as self-appearance outer-appearance time knowledge intention effortless of self-abiding within.
[17090] Knowing as selfless and universal empty of all dharmas.
[17091] Knowing the measures of primordial wisdom of self is called knowledge.
[17092] That which is extremely superior, difficult to realize by all, the excellent intention, is found from self without being sought—this is called becoming the summit.
[17093] The jewel existing at oneself primordially, when found, is called self.
[17094] Appearing as ceaseless self-arisen is called arise.
[17095] Knowing all dharmas clearly is called lamp.
[17096] Pervading by Awareness at the self-face of self-appearance is called knowledge.



<tantra> [17097] From that same source:
<tantra> [17098] Entity and non-entity by knowledge,
<tantra> [17099] Completely entering into all appearance,
<tantra> [17100] And knowing the meaning of the universal,
<tantra> [17101] Attaining confidence of not seeking,
<tantra> [17102] Knowing the measures of primordial wisdom of self.
<tantra> [17103] The dharmakāya of pure nature,
<tantra> [17104] By self-awareness not finding three,
<tantra> [17105] Clearly appears excellent surpassing all.
<tantra> [17106] No basis of examination by other,
<tantra> [17107] Object primordially pure self-arisen.
<tantra> [17108] Self, not object of other.
<tantra> [17109] This meaning found not made by.
<tantra> [17110] To whom hope of nonexistent cause.
<tantra> [17111] Arise self-appearance primordially.
<tantra> [17112] All dharmatā by lamp,
<tantra> [17113] Make appearance non-dual.
<tantra> [17114] Pervaded by self-face.
<tantra> [17115] Thus it is spoken.



[17116] From the Mu-tig Phreng-ba:



<tantra> [17117] Like the example of a fire-lamp,
<tantra> [17118] Simultaneously realize all dharmas by knowledge.
<tantra> [17119] Become the summit of all excellence.
<tantra> [17120] Self, free and not depending on other dharmas.
<tantra> [17121] Appear unblocked and open by arising.
<tantra> [17122] Thus it is taught.



[17123] Third: if divided, from five.
[17124] The wisdom of self-arisen basis-abiding.
[17125] The aspect of knowledge abiding within as arise-basis and support.
[17126] The wisdom of raw-holding appearance,
[17127] Bringing to dharmatā intention by pure stainless clear self-time pair-join of non-dual dimension-awareness.
[17128] The wisdom of unceasing memory.
[17129] Arising below without arising-structure,
[17130] Gathering into one dharmatā of liberated self-face.
[17131] The wisdom of individual investigation,
[17132] Knowing individually the aspects of particular and universal dharmas and dharma-possessors,
[17133] And characteristics and so forth, unmistaken.
[17134] The wisdom of the three enterers,
[17135] Makes definite in the natural intermediate state by hearing,
[17136] Makes certain by thinking,
[17137] Extracts from saṃsāra by tasting through meditation.
[17138] Thus actualizing word-meaning.



<tantra> [17139] From that same source:
<tantra> [17140] Divisions are five:
<tantra> [17141] By wisdom of basis-abiding self-arisen,
<tantra> [17142] Support all dharmas of body and so forth.
<tantra> [17143] By wisdom-interval of raw-holding appearance,
<tantra> [17144] Hold the meeting place of dimension and awareness.
<tantra> [17145] By unceasing memory wisdom,
<tantra> [17146] Gather the objects to knowledge one-pointed.
<tantra> [17147] By wisdom of individual investigation,
<tantra> [17148] Discriminate particular and universal characteristics.
<tantra> [17149] By wisdom of the three enterers,
<tantra> [17150] Make definite in the natural intermediate state.
<tantra> [17151] Thus it is spoken.



[17152] Fourth: characteristic.
[17153] Knowing dharmas included in object-appearance as without nature is the characteristic of this.



<tantra> [17154] From that same source:
<tantra> [17155] All appearance and non-appearance dharmas,
<tantra> [17156] Who knows as without nature,
<tantra> [17157] This is the characteristic of that.
<tantra> [17158] Thus it is spoken.



[17159] From the Samādhi-sambhara:



<tantra> [17160] Transcending nature of all dharmas,
<tantra> [17161] This is called supreme transcendent wisdom.
<tantra> [17162] Thus it is spoken as taught.



[17163] Fifth: door of manifestation.
[17164] The five faculties—the sense-consciousnesses examining objects is wisdom, and because it is the door.
[17165] Especially through nose-memory wisdom-horse prāṇa moving, that itself is.
[17166] Fire-prāṇa wisdom-resonance like fire-sparks when sleep is pressed at night—manifests and knows.



<tantra> [17167] From that same source:
<tantra> [17168] Manifestation-door is five faculties,
<tantra> [17169] Especially from nose manifests.
<tantra> [17170] Sign of that at night-time,
<tantra> [17171] Coarse and pressed together,
[17172] When body extremely coarse,
[17173] Red radiating light-ray,
[17174] Like fire-sparks variously emanating,
[17175] By that measure and that sign,
[17176] Know the door of manifestation.
[17177] Thus it is spoken.



[17178] Sixth: etymology.
[17179] Through the four special nerves of the citta being captured by the resonance-prāṇa of awareness and not radiating outward, abiding within self-recognition as merely unclear,
[17180] Through action-prāṇa activating outward power, objects arise as knowledge.
[17181] That also, the resonance of name-basis-gathered abiding:
[17182] Element,
[17183] Knowledge,
[17184] Wisdom-awareness four resonances abiding.



<tantra> [17185] From that same source:
<tantra> [17186] From the four producing nerves,
<tantra> [17187] Moving, shaking, flickering,
<tantra> [17188] Fire-sparks upward characteristic,
<tantra> [17189] Five
<tantra> [17190] Wisdom,
<tantra> [17191] Action,
[17192] From,
[17193] Together with prāṇa,
<tantra> [17194] Knowledge clear-clear aware-aware,
<tantra> [17195] As nature of wisdoms,
<tantra> [17196] Vibration-raw-whole-all-tremble,
<tantra> [17197] Crystal-inside belly empty within,
<tantra> [17198] Clear great wisdom abides.
<tantra> [17199] As resonance of gathered four names,
<tantra> [17200] As nature of discriminating all,
<tantra> [17201] Abiding primordially at body-parts,
<tantra> [17202] When captured by prāṇa at time,
<tantra> [17203] Knowledge non-memory sluggish also,
<tantra> [17204] Wisdom power-full compressed,
<tantra> [17205] Become sluggish without clear portion,
<tantra> [17206] When activating self-wisdom-power,
<tantra> [17207] Even dharmas unheard before,
<tantra> [17208] Remember in mind and clearly arise,
<tantra> [17209] Clear and unclear powers,
<tantra> [17210] Arise from movement of prāṇa alone,
<tantra> [17211] Abiding within center-body nerves.
<tantra> [17212] Thus it is spoken.



[17213] Seventh: measure.
[17214] The measure of basis-abiding wisdom abiding at equal-intention warmth-measure.
[17215] The measure of raw-holding appearance wisdom,
[17216] Dimension-awareness mixed, obtaining self-power of knowledge.
[17217] The measure of unceasing memory wisdom,
[17218] Arising-liberated without structure, gathering-dispersal exhausted, abiding in effortless intention, prāṇas not moving awareness.
[17219] The measure of individual investigation wisdom,
[17220] Dividing individually dharmas with two-together, reaching certainty.
[17221] The measure of the three enterers' wisdom,
[17222] Reaching certainty of word-meaning, abiding at meaning self-face.



<tantra> [17223] From the blazing lamp:
<tantra> [17224] Measure of wisdom self-arisen basis-abiding,
<tantra> [17225] From produced experience of equal dharmas,
<tantra> [17226] Attain confidence of stable knowledge.
<tantra> [17227] That itself without change,
<tantra> [17228] Always abiding in continuum,
<tantra> [17229] By this wisdom basis-abiding is complete.
<tantra> [17230] This body also light,
<tantra> [17231] And knowledge clear.
<tantra> [17232] Measure of wisdom raw-holding appearance,
<tantra> [17233] Sign of experience left in equipoise,
<tantra> [17234] Five-color light of body-center,
<tantra> [17235] Arising outward without effort,
<tantra> [17236] Knowledge self-place in this,
<tantra> [17237] Body also not touching ground,
<tantra> [17238] By this where knowledge is cast,
<tantra> [17239] Can move even solid entities.
<tantra> [17240] Is measure of training self-power.
<tantra> [17241] Measure of wisdom unceasing memory,
<tantra> [17242] Knowledge not entering other,
<tantra> [17243] Delight in abiding alone,
<tantra> [17244] Always at secluded place,
<tantra> [17245] Not desiring company with humans,
<tantra> [17246] Knowledge becomes one-pointed unchanged,
<tantra> [17247] Even for speech described by other,
<tantra> [17248] Free from holding together,
<tantra> [17249] View unmoving in confidence,
<tantra> [17250] Think going in empty sky,
<tantra> [17251] Mind cast there ceases there,
<tantra> [17252] Even by conditions of others,
<tantra> [17253] Cannot influence this.
<tantra> [17254] Careless knowledge vast bliss,
<tantra> [17255] That person born to this,
<tantra> [17256] Unceasing memory wisdom is complete.
<tantra> [17257] Measure of wisdom individual investigation,
<tantra> [17258] All-basis and dharmakāya also,
<tantra> [17259] Thus divided sign like this,
<tantra> [17260] Mind free from body-attachment,
<tantra> [17261] Awareness cast at self-place abides,
<tantra> [17262] Body becomes like solid entity,
<tantra> [17263] Dividing mind and wisdom,
<tantra> [17264] Even doors of movers cease,
<tantra> [17265] Who divides pure-impure elements,
<tantra> [17266] Coarse appearance self-ceases,
<tantra> [17267] Conduct blissfully to chain,
<tantra> [17268] Thus who divides saṃsāra-nirvāṇa,
<tantra> [17269] Deluded thoughts cannot arise,
<tantra> [17270] Even if arise without help-harm,
<tantra> [17271] By self-knowing and so forth,
<tantra> [17272] Reaching certainty of saṃsāra-nirvāṇa,
<tantra> [17273] Is wisdom of individual investigation.
<tantra> [17274] Measure of wisdom three enterers,
<tantra> [17275] All dharmas by single word,
<tantra> [17276] Know that text-meaning,
<tantra> [17277] Reach measure of hearing wisdom.
<tantra> [17278] That which is thought by knowledge,
<tantra> [17279] Pair arising blissfully in continuum,
<tantra> [17280] Also training by thinking,
<tantra> [17281] Whatever arises not harmed by conditions,
<tantra> [17282] Deluded thought attachment self-ceases,
<tantra> [17283] By this attain meditation wisdom.
<tantra> [17284] Thus it is spoken.



[17285] Eighth: concordant example.
[17286] Looking at whatever object known and realized,
[17287] All afflictions burned by burning tinder like inflamed fire—such is this.



<tantra> [17288] From the blazing lamp:
<tantra> [17289] Like dry tinder without moisture,
<tantra> [17290] Though meet subtle fire-spark,
<tantra> [17291] All tinder inflamed by fire burns,
<tantra> [17292] By wisdom burn habitual-tendencies.
<tantra> [17293] This all is wisdom-lamp.
<tantra> [17294] Thus it is spoken.



[17295] From the Samādhi-sambhara:



<tantra> [17296] Knowing dharmas' nature by wisdom,
<tantra> [17297] Correctly transcend the three realms unproduced.
<tantra> [17298] Thus it is spoken as taught.



[17299] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle,
[17300] The presentation of the enumeration of the Four Lamps, the Thirteenth Chapter.



[17301] Having thus explained the classification of the body-support and the collection of its dharmas,
[17302] Now determining the nature of the mind supported by that has three aspects:
[17303] Distinction between all-basis and dharmakāya,
[17304] Distinction between mind and wisdom,
[17305] Explanation of other distinctive dharmas.
[17306] First has two:
[17307] Brief demonstration,
[17308] Extensive explanation.
[17309] First:
[17310] Looking at the basis of sentient beings and the basis of buddhas, in the manner of being the essence of awareness as primordially pure stainless and without defilement,
[17311] With defilement non-recognition conceptual-collection included, from the aspect of becoming the basis of all delusion-appearance delusion-grasper,
[17312] Know as two of all-basis and dharmakāya aspects.



<tantra> [17313] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [17314] Crucial point of all-basis and dharmakāya.
<tantra> [17315] Thus it is spoken.



[17316] Regarding that, all-basis is distinguished by non-recognition as the first support of all mind and mental factors,
[17317] Middle abiding,
[17318] Final home,
[17319] Become vessel of habitual-tendencies like a pond.
[17320] Dharmakāya is,
[17321] Distinguished by reversed non-recognition,
[17322] Transcended objects of mind and mental factors,
[17323] Pure from all action and habitual-tendencies.



[17324] All-basis is,
[17325] Like under-cloth lower-barrier as downward-appearance basis,
[17326] Various objects appearing as vessel,
[17327] Possessors as six non-recognitions appearing as three realms contents and that body,
[17328] Bliss-suffering,
[17329] And much portion of mind's delusion.
[17330] Dharmakāya is,
[17331] Without all that,
[17332] Not abiding together with mind and so forth.



<tantra> [17333] From the Self-Arisen:
<tantra> [17334] To all-basis concept-grasper,
<tantra> [17335] Various delusion-knowledge seduced,
<tantra> [17336] All-basis non-recognition is entity.
<tantra> [17337] All-basis called to that.
<tantra> [17338] Thus it is spoken.



[17339] Also:



<tantra> [17340] Basis of sentient beings, basis of buddhas,
<tantra> [17341] Distinguished certainly by one distinction.
<tantra> [17342] Thus it is spoken.



[17343] From the Mu-tig Phreng-ba:



<tantra> [17344] All-basis itself is for accumulation,
<tantra> [17345] Dharmakāya is exhaustion of outflow.
<tantra> [17346] Empty and clear and clear-pervading,
<tantra> [17347] Unstained by thought, memory-clear,
<tantra> [17348] Free from elaboration,
<tantra> [17349] Pervading and empty like space,
<tantra> [17350] Self-pure indication free from all,
<tantra> [17351] To all-basis with cause-conditions,
<tantra> [17352] Habitual-tendencies etc. outside like pond,
<tantra> [17353] Dharmakāya free from habitual-tendencies,
<tantra> [17354] From gathering of mind and so forth,
<tantra> [17355] Appear as many to embodied all-basis,
<tantra> [17356] Because free from mind etc. of dharmakāya,
<tantra> [17357] Appear as forms without body.
<tantra> [17358] Thus it is spoken.



[17359] Regarding that, all-basis is.
[17360] And regarding that, all-basis is.
