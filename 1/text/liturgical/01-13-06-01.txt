[17072] <prose>First, the essential nature:</prose>
[17073] <prose>The intention of all lamps as the object of knowledge—Dharmatā empty-luminous, self-abiding, together with the dynamic of knowledge.</prose>
[17074] <prose>Method: ground-hook;</prose>
[17075] <prose>Bindu;</prose>
[17076] <prose>By placing the three dimensions unmoving,</prose>
[17077] <prose>Within, self-awareness crystal-clear split, the intention of self-abiding together with the interval of knowledge filling the expanse.</prose>
[17078] <tantra>From the Blazing Lamp:</tantra>
[17079] <tantra>"Self-arisen wisdom lamp—</tantra>
[17080] <tantra>Thus, of all lamps,</tantra>
[17081] <tantra>Since abiding as the object of knowledge, || 10 ||</tantra>
[17082] <tantra>By this exactly, in all parts,</tantra>
[17083] <tantra>By this discriminating wisdom exactly,</tantra>
[17084] <tantra>Abiding in the manner of non-discrimination.</tantra>
[17085] <tantra>As the nature producing subtle parts,</tantra>
[17086] <tantra>Abiding primordially from the beginning.</tantra>
[17087] <tantra>Thus it is spoken."</tantra>
[17088] <prose>Second, the definitive meaning:</prose>
[17089] <prose>Within self-abiding effortless intention, when knowing the time of outer-appearance self-appearance completely obvious,</prose>
[17090] <prose>Knowing dharmas all universally empty and selfless,</prose>
[17091] <prose>Knowing the measures of one's own primordial wisdom—this is called knowledge. || 20 ||</prose>
[17092] <tantra>"Excellent, by all difficult to realize intention, not sought, found from self, becoming the extremely superior summit"—thus.</tantra>
[17093] <tantra>"Primordially existing jewel found at self, called self";</tantra>
[17094] <tantra>Self-arisen, ceaselessly arising, called arisen;</tantra>
[17095] <tantra>Knowing dharmas clearly, called lamp.</tantra>
[17096] <tantra>Self-appearance pervading at self-face by awareness, not by knowledge, called not.</tantra>
[17097] <tantra>Again, from that exactly:</tantra>
[17098] <tantra>By knowledge, entity and non-entity,</tantra>
[17099] <tantra>Completely entering into all appearances,</tantra>
[17100] <tantra>And knowing the universal meanings,</tantra>
[17101] <tantra>Obtaining the confidence of not-sought, not-placed, || 30 ||</tantra>
[17102] <tantra>Knowing the measures of one's own primordial wisdom,</tantra>
[17103] <tantra>Dharmakāya of pure nature,</tantra>
[17104] <tantra>By self-awareness not finding the three,</tantra>
[17105] <tantra>Clearly appearing surpassing all excellence.</tantra>
[17106] <tantra>Since no basis for examination by others,</tantra>
[17107] <tantra>Object of primordially pure self-arisen,</tantra>
[17108] <tantra>Not object of other, called self.</tantra>
[17109] <tantra>By doing, this meaning not found;</tantra>
[17110] <tantra>Since hope not existing for whom,</tantra>
[17111] <tantra>Called primordially self-appearance arisen. || 40 ||</tantra>
[17112] <tantra>By lamp, all Dharmatā,</tantra>
[17113] <tantra>Making appear as non-dual,</tantra>
[17114] <tantra>Ma pervading self-face, thus.</tantra>
[17115] <tantra>Thus spoken, and</tantra>
[17116] <tantra>From the Pearl-Garland:</tantra>
[17117] <tantra>"For example, like a fire-lamp,</tantra>
[17118] <tantra>By knowledge, dharmas simultaneously realized;</tantra>
[17119] <tantra>Excellent, becoming the summit of all;</tantra>
[17120] <tantra>Self free from other-dependent dharmas;</tantra>
[17121] <tantra>Arisen, unblocked, spontaneously appearing." || 50 ||</tantra>
[17122] <tantra>Thus spoken.</tantra>
[17123] <prose>Third, divided there are five:</prose>
[17124] <list>Ground-abiding self-arisen wisdom;</list>
[17125] <list>Inner-abiding awareness of knowledge—abiding as arising-basis and support.</list>
[17126] <list>One-pointed-grasping-appearance wisdom;</list>
[17127] <list>Expansive awareness non-dual union's own time self-clear, stainless, pure, conveying intention to Dharmatā.</list>
[17128] <list>Memory ceaseless wisdom;</list>
[17129] <list>Arising without characteristic below, yet</list>
[17130] <list>Liberating self-face to Dharmatā as one.</list>
[17131] <list>Analytical wisdom; || 60 ||</list>
[17132] <list>Dharmas and dharmatās, self and universal aspects,</list>
[17133] <list>Characteristics, etc., appearing without confusion, knowing.</list>
[17134] <list>Three-engaging wisdom;</list>
[17135] <list>In this bardo of nature, by hearing, establishing definitively;</list>
[17136] <list>By thinking, determining;</list>
[17137] <list>By meditation, tasting, certainly liberating from saṃsāra—</list>
[17138] <list>Making realize word-meaning.</list>
[17139] <tantra>Again, from that exactly:</tantra>
[17140] <tantra>Divisions are five types:</tantra>
[17141] <tantra>By ground-abiding self-arisen wisdom, || 70 ||</tantra>
[17142] <tantra>Making supports of body, etc., dharmas;</tantra>
[17143] <tantra>By one-pointed-grasping-awareness,</tantra>
[17144] <tantra>Grasping support of expanse and awareness;</tantra>
[17145] <tantra>By memory-ceaseless wisdom,</tantra>
[17146] <tantra>Gathering objects, one-pointed knowledge;</tantra>
[17147] <tantra>By analytical wisdom,</tantra>
[17148] <tantra>Discriminating universal and self characteristics;</tantra>
[17149] <tantra>By three-engaging wisdom,</tantra>
[17150] <tantra>Establishing definitively in nature's bardo.</tantra>
[17151] <tantra>Thus it is spoken. || 80 ||</tantra>
[17152] <prose>Fourth, the characteristic:</prose>
[17153] <prose>Knowing dharmas gathered by appearing objects and dharmas gathered by knowing awareness as without nature—this is the characteristic.</prose>
[17154] <tantra>From that exactly:</tantra>
[17155] <tantra>"All dharmas appearing and not-appearing,</tantra>
[17156] <tantra>Who knows as without nature—</tantra>
[17157] <tantra>This is the characteristic."</tantra>
[17158] <tantra>Thus spoken, and</tantra>
[17159] <tantra>From the Condensed:</tantra>
[17160] <tantra>"Dhārmās completely transformed as without nature—</tantra>
[17161] <tantra>This is called supreme Prajñāpāramitā." || 90 ||</tantra>
[17162] <tantra>Thus spoken exactly.</tantra>
[17163] <prose>Fifth, the gate of manifestation:</prose>
[17164] <prose>Five faculties—since the gate is that by power-awareness objects are measured as wisdom.</prose>
[17165] <prose>Particularly, from the nose, memory wisdom's horse wind moving—this exactly.</prose>
[17166] <prose>Fire wind wisdom's spark-like appearance at night, squeezing—know thus.</prose>
[17167] <tantra>Again, from that exactly:</tantra>
[17168] <tantra>"Manifestation gate five faculties;</tantra>
[17169] <tantra>Particularly, from nose making manifest.</tantra>
[17170] <tantra>That sign at night time,</tantra>
[17171] <tantra>Groaning and fierce squeezing, || 100 ||</tantra>
[17172] <tantra>Extremely fierce body remaining,</tantra>
[17173] <tantra>Red blazing light rays,</tantra>
[17174] <tantra>Spreading like sparks—</tantra>
[17175] <tantra>By that measure and that sign,</tantra>
[17176] <tantra>Know the gate of manifestation."</tantra>
[17177] <tantra>Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
[17178] <prose>Sixth, the field:</prose>
[17179] <prose>Citta on four channels of great distinction, grasped by wisdom's clarity-wind, not dispersing outward, internally self-abiding, only unclear,</prose>
[17180] <prose>By karma-wind outward-force moved, objects awareness-appeared.</prose>
[17181] <prose>That also, abiding in name-ground-gathered clarity, || 110 ||</prose>
[17182] <prose>Element,</prose>
[17183] <prose>Knowledge,</prose>
[17184] <prose>Fourfold clarity of wisdom-awareness.</prose>
[17185] <tantra>From that exactly:</tantra>
[17186] <tantra>"From four producing channels,</tantra>
[17187] <tantra>Moving, shaking, dispersing,</tantra>
[17188] <tantra>Fire spark rising characteristic,</tantra>
[17189] <tantra>Five</tantra>
[17190] <tantra>Wisdom,</tantra>
[17191] <tantra>Karma, || 120 ||</tantra>
[17192] <tantra>From,</tantra>
[17193] <tantra>With wind,</tantra>
[17194] <tantra>Knowledge clear-clear, aware-aware;</tantra>
[17195] <tantra>Wisdoms' nature as</tantra>
[17196] <tantra>Flavor not-raw, all trembling,</tantra>
[17197] <tantra>Crystal tube hollow inside,</tantra>
[17198] <tantra>Clear, great wisdom abiding.</tantra>
[17199] <tantra>Name-four-gathered clarity,</tantra>
[17200] <tantra>As nature discriminating all,</tantra>
[17201] <tantra>Primordially abiding in body-parts, || 130 ||</tantra>
[17202] <tantra>Occasionally grasped by wind,</tantra>
[17203] <tantra>Knowledge memoryless, dull, yet</tantra>
[17204] <tantra>Wisdom powers expanded-contracted,</tantra>
[17205] <tantra>Clear part none, becoming dull.</tantra>
[17206] <tantra>When one's own wisdom-power moved,</tantra>
[17207] <tantra>Even dharmas not heard before,</tantra>
[17208] <tantra>Arise in mind, clearly appear.</tantra>
[17209] <tantra>Clear and unclear powers,</tantra>
[17210] <tantra>Arise from wind's movement alone,</tantra>
[17211] <tantra>Abiding in body-center channel-inside." || 140 ||</tantra>
[17212] <tantra>Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
[17213] <prose>Seventh, the measure:</prose>
[17214] <prose>Ground-abiding wisdom's measure: abiding in heat-measure of equal-intention.</prose>
[17215] <prose>One-pointed-grasping wisdom's measure:</prose>
[17216] <prose>Expansive awareness mixed, obtaining self-power.</prose>
[17217] <prose>Memory-ceaseless wisdom's measure:</prose>
[17218] <prose>Liberating-arising without characteristic, gathering-dispersing exhausted, abiding in effortless spontaneous intention, conditions not moving awareness.</prose>
[17219] <prose>Analytical wisdom's measure:</prose>
[17220] <prose>Dualistic dharmas discriminated separately, establishing definitively.</prose>
[17221] <prose>Three-engaging wisdom's measure: || 150 ||</prose>
[17222] <prose>Realizing word-meaning, abiding in meaning's self-face.</prose>
[17223] <tantra>Thus, from the Blazing Lamp:</tantra>
[17224] <tantra>"Ground-abiding wisdom self-arisen measure:</tantra>
[17225] <tantra>From equal-intention experience-arisen,</tantra>
[17226] <tantra>Obtained confidence of stable knowledge.</tantra>
[17227] <tantra>That itself, without change,</tantra>
[17228] <tantra>Always abiding in continuum, thus</tantra>
[17229] <tantra>By this, ground-abiding wisdom completed.</tantra>
[17230] <tantra>This body also light,</tantra>
[17231] <tantra>Knowledges clear. || 160 ||</tantra>
[17232] <tantra>One-pointed-grasping wisdom measure:</tantra>
[17233] <tantra>Resting-experience enjoyed signs,</tantra>
[17234] <tantra>Body-center five colors' light,</tantra>
[17235] <tantra>Without effort appearing outward,</tantra>
[17236] <tantra>By this knowledge self-place completed.</tantra>
[17237] <tantra>Body also not touching ground,</tantra>
[17238] <tantra>By this knowing where placed,</tantra>
[17239] <tantra>Material objects also able to melt.</tantra>
[17240] <tantra>Self-power trained measure.</tantra>
[17241] <tantra>Memory-ceaseless wisdom measure: || 170 ||</tantra>
[17242] <tantra>Knowledge not entering other,</tantra>
[17243] <tantra>Alone abiding, happy,</tantra>
[17244] <tantra>Always in secluded place,</tantra>
[17245] <tantra>Not desiring to be with people,</tantra>
[17246] <tantra>Knowledge becomes one-pointed.</tantra>
[17247] <tantra>Even others' spoken words,</tantra>
[17248] <tantra>Free from grasping as pair,</tantra>
[17249] <tantra>View unchanging, confidence,</tantra>
[17250] <tantra>Thinking going through space,</tantra>
[17251] <tantra>Mind placed there, ceases there, || 180 ||</tantra>
[17252] <tantra>Others' conditions also,</tantra>
[17253] <tantra>How could this be changed?</tantra>
[17254] <tantra>Carefree knowledge vast,</tantra>
[17255] <tantra>Person born to this,</tantra>
[17256] <tantra>Memory-ceaseless wisdom completed.</tantra>
[17257] <tantra>Analytical wisdom measure:</tantra>
[17258] <tantra>Ālaya and Dharmakāya also,</tantra>
[17259] <tantra>Thus discriminated, thus signs,</tantra>
[17260] <tantra>Body attachment mind free,</tantra>
[17261] <tantra>Awareness placed where placed, || 190 ||</tantra>
[17262] <tantra>Body becomes material,</tantra>
[17263] <tantra>Mind and wisdom discriminated,</tantra>
[17264] <tantra>Moving channels' gates also cease.</tantra>
[17265] <tantra>Element clear-obscure discriminated,</tantra>
[17266] <tantra>Coarse appearance self-liberated,</tantra>
[17267] <tantra>Happy like a weasel,</tantra>
[17268] <tantra>Thus saṃsāra-nirvāṇa discriminated,</tantra>
[17269] <tantra>Delusion thoughts impossible.</tantra>
[17270] <tantra>Even if arisen, without benefit-harm,</tantra>
[17271] <tantra>By such self-knowledge, || 200 ||</tantra>
[17272] <tantra>Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa established definitively—</tantra>
[17273] <tantra>Analytical thought wisdom.</tantra>
[17274] <tantra>Three-engaging wisdom measure:</tantra>
[17275] <tantra>All dharmas one word spoken,</tantra>
[17276] <tantra>Knowing that scripture,</tantra>
[17277] <tantra>Hearing wisdom measure completed.</tantra>
[17278] <tantra>By knowledge, what is thought,</tantra>
[17279] <tantra>That pair pleasantly arisen in continuum,</tantra>
[17280] <tantra>By thinking likewise trained,</tantra>
[17281] <tantra>Arisen, conditions not harming, || 210 ||</tantra>
[17282] <tantra>Deluded thought attachment self-liberated—</tantra>
[17283] <tantra>By this, meditation wisdom found."</tantra>
[17284] <tantra>Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
[17285] <prose>Eighth, the harmonious example:</prose>
[17286] <prose>One for whom viewed objects appear and are realized, all afflictions burned—like fire blazing in tinder.</prose>
[17287] <tantra>From the Blazing Lamp:</tantra>
[17288] <tantra>"For example, in dry tinder,</tantra>
[17289] <tantra>Even meeting subtle fire spark,</tantra>
[17290] <tantra>All tinder blazing, burned by fire,</tantra>
[17291] <tantra>By wisdom, habitual tendencies burned— || 220 ||</tantra>
[17292] <tantra>All this wisdom lamp."</tantra>
[17293] <tantra>Thus spoken, and</tantra>
[17294] <tantra>From the Condensed:</tantra>
[17295] <tantra>"By wisdom, knowing dharmas' nature completely,</tantra>
[17296] <tantra>Truly transcending the three realms."</tantra>
[17297] <tantra>Thus spoken exactly.</tantra>
[17298] <ornament>From the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle,</ornament>
[17299] <ornament>The presentation of the Four Lamps' sequence—thirteenth chapter.</ornament>
[17300] <prose>Thus, having explained in detail the body-support and other gathered dharmas,</prose>
[17301] <prose>Now, establishing definitively the nature of knowledge depending on that—three: || 230 ||</prose>
[17302] <list>Ālaya and Dharmakāya distinction;</list>
[17303] <list>Mind and wisdom distinction;</list>
[17304] <list>Explanation of other distinctive dharmas.</list>
[17305] <prose>First, two:</prose>
[17306] <prose>Brief presentation and</prose>
[17307] <prose>Detailed explanation.</prose>
[17308] <prose>First:</prose>
[17309] <prose>Looking at sentient beings' ground and Buddhas' ground, the essential nature of awareness—primordially pure, stainless,</prose>
[17310] <prose>Obscured by defilement with ignorance and thought-gatherings, becoming ground of all delusion-appearance, delusion-grasping—</prose>
[17311] <prose>From the aspect of Ālaya and Dharmakāya as two types, know. || 240 ||</prose>
[17312] <tantra>From the Thalgyur:</tantra>
[17313] <tantra>"Ālaya and Dharmakāya's crucial point."</tantra>
[17314] <tantra>Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
[17315] <prose>There, Ālaya—made distinct by ignorance, support of all mind and mental-events' beginning,</prose>
[17316] <prose>Intermediate abiding,</prose>
[17317] <prose>Final home,</prose>
[17318] <prose>Become vessel of habitual tendencies—like a pond;</prose>
[17319] <prose>Dharmakāya—</prose>
[17320] <prose>Made distinct by reversed ignorance,</prose>
[17321] <prose>Transcended objects of mind and mental-events, || 250 ||</prose>
[17322] <prose>Pure from all karma and habitual tendencies.</prose>
[17323] <prose>Ālaya—</prose>
[17324] <prose>Like lower garment ground, become ground of downward appearance,</prose>
[17325] <prose>Various objects appearing as objects,</prose>
[17326] <prose>As subjects, six ignorance, three realms, appearing as container-contained, and its body,</prose>
[17327] <prose>Happiness-suffering,</prose>
[17328] <prose>Mind's delusion aspects, many contained;</prose>
[17329] <prose>Dharmakāya—</prose>
[17330] <prose>All that non-existing,</prose>
[17331] <prose>Not abiding together with mind, etc. || 260 ||</prose>
[17332] <tantra>From Rangshar:</tantra>
[17333] <tantra>"To Ālaya concept-grasping,</tantra>
[17334] <tantra>Various deluded knowledge deceived;</tantra>
[17335] <tantra>Ālaya ignorance entity,</tantra>
[17336] <tantra>Called Ālaya to that.</tantra>
[17337] <tantra>Thus spoken, and</tantra>
[17338] <tantra>Again:</tantra>
[17339] <tantra>"Sentient beings' ground and Buddhas' ground,</tantra>
[17340] <tantra>Distinction by one difference determined.</tantra>
[17341] <tantra>Thus spoken, and || 270 ||</tantra>
[17342] <tantra>From the Pearl-Garland:</tantra>
[17343] <tantra>"Since Ālaya is accumulation,</tantra>
[17344] <tantra>Dharmakāya exhaustion of outflows;</tantra>
[17345] <tantra>Empty and clear, clear and pervasive,</tantra>
[17346] <tantra>Uncontrived by thought, memory clear;</tantra>
[17347] <tantra>Free from elaboration,</tantra>
[17348] <tantra>Pervading like space, empty;</tantra>
[17349] <tantra>Self-pure, free from all demonstrations,</tantra>
[17350] <tantra>Ālaya with causes and conditions,</tantra>
[17351] <tantra>Habitual tendencies, etc., like a pond; || 280 ||</tantra>
[17352] <tantra>Dharmakāya free from habitual tendencies,</tantra>
[17353] <tantra>From mind, mental-events, gatherings,</tantra>
[17354] <tantra>Embodied Ālaya appearing as many;</tantra>
[17355] <tantra>Dharmakāya free from mind, etc.,</tantra>
[17356] <tantra>Form-appearances many, bodies non-existing."</tantra>
[17357] <tantra>Thus it is spoken.</tantra>
[17358] <prose>That also, Ālaya—</prose>
[17359] <prose></prose>
[17360] <prose></prose>
