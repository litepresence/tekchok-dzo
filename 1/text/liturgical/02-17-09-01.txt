[3124] First: appearance of reflection arising in mirror, and.
[3125] Upon these outer-inner phenomena difference not existing.
[3126] Holding as true—what use?
[3127] All are illusion-reflection appearance—knowing this with non-distracted aspiration, meditate whatever appears as illusion-reflection, and.
[3128] Especially upon one's own form appearing in mirror.
[3129] Putting on clothes, and.
[3130] Putting ornaments, and.
[3131] Removing those, throwing outside, and.
[3132] Praising, and.
[3133] Disparaging, etcetera—doing these.
[3134] Though that form appears there, like meaning not established.
[3135] Upon this appearance—self-other.
[3136] Enemy-friend.
[3137] Food-clothing.
[3138] Enjoyment.
[3139] Pleasant-unpleasant.
[3140] Denial-affirmation.
[3141] Birth-death.
[3142] Happiness-suffering.
[3143] Sickness-pain.
[3144] Whatever arises, remembers, appears—all samsara-nirvana phenomena like reflections inside mirror, knowing essence not existent from time of appearance itself.
[3145] Mastering deluded-appearance truthless illusion-nature.
[3146] Seeing own body also as illusion-body, without doubt holding bardo illusory-body.
[3147] As said in the Ljonpa-asked Sutra:
[3148] Upon completely pure mirror-mandala.
[3149] Like face-reflection appearing.
[3150] How nature not established.
[3151] Ljonpa, know phenomena.
[3152] Thus said, and.
[3153] From Arya Samadhiraja Sutra:
[3154] How night-water-moon.
[3155] Though appearing in clear defilement-not-exist lake.
[3156] Water-moon empty hollow essence not exist.
[3157] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3158] How people many midst.
[3159] Illusionist by forms emanate and.
[3160] Horse elephant chariot various make.
[3161] Like various appearance not-true upon that.
[3162] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3163] How water-field moist tree.
[3164] 
[3165] Though person cuts that for desire of essence.
[3166] Inside and outside—all essence not exist.
[3167] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3168] Thus it is.
[3169] Second, nighttime training illusory-body in dream: knowing all appearance as dream like before, training mastery all appearance-existence as illusion-dream.
[3170] Mastering birth-death, denial-affirmation, all deluded-appearance as dream-illusion.
[3171] In dream also thus arising, attachment sesame-grain not exist.
[3172] Again from that:
[3173] How in young girl's dream.
[3174] Seeing son arise and die.
[3175] Joy upon arising, not-joy upon dying—like this.
[3176] Phenomena all thus know do.
[3177] Thus it is.
[3178] At this time path-application virtues arise in self.
[3179] From Abhisamayalankara:
[3180] In dream also all phenomena.
[3181] View as dream-like, etcetera.
[3182] Sign of application reaching peak.
[3183] Taught as twelve aspects.
[3184] Thus it is.
[3185] Thus training illusory-body daytime-nighttime.
[3186] True-attachment to deluded-appearance not exist, and.
[3187] Seeing body also as transparent, shadow-form-like appearance, truth-not-exist.
[3188] Shadow not exist upon body, and.
[3189] Holding bardo illusory-body, becoming final-existence person.
[3190] Like holy precious lama Gyalwa Zhangton and scholar Nyibum.
[3191] Those also from Thalgyur:
[3192] Train illusory-body dream.
[3193] By that mastery, body itself also.
[3194] Become like shadow-form.
[3195] By that intermediate body.
[3196] These become self-held.
[3197] Thus it is.
