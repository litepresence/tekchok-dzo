[5649] Not-separated completely realized,
[5650] Saṃsāra pure abide not,
[5651] Elaborations joy person,

[5664] Which arises from the introduction-base, explains the meaning of the twofold introduction.
[5665] Second: Those meanings are summarized through the eleven words of instruction, establishing the eleven categories of verbal meaning.
[5666] Third:
[5667] Thus the eleven are gathered into cutting-through and crossing-over, binding the two stages of practice, explained thus.
[5668] Fourth:
[5669] All are gathered into the single meaning of direct awareness, suitable to awareness itself.
[5670] Thus the fourfold Great Secret is established in meaning.
[5671] The root Vajra's four bonds are named:
[5672] The great Paṇḍita Vimalamitra's supreme view.
[5673] Second, explained particularly in three parts:
[5674] The connection of the two introduction-bases.
[5675] The individual meanings extensively explained.
[5676] Abandoning mistaken refutations.
[5677] First:
[5678] The Tantra's meaning is summarized,
[5679] The title shown,
[5680] The twofold text.
[5681] The body of the text arranged,
[5682] The limbs extensively explained in two parts.
[5683] The body extensively explained, briefly shown, gathered.
[5684] Through the introduction-base, all tantras are shown to arise.
[5685] From the Treasury:
[5686] The clear sequence of words spoken,
[5687] The title shown, and through the text,
[5688] The minds of length and instant, variously.
[5689] To be realized, variously explained.
[5690] The twofold text-types distinguished.
[5691] The body itself arranged,
[5692] The limbs' meaning extensively divided.
[5693] The body's introduction-base is twofold.
[5694] Thus it is.
[5695] Each of the two introductions:
[5696] The teacher perfected,
[5697] The place perfected,
[5698] The retinue perfected,
[5699] The Dharma perfected,
[5700] The time perfected, abiding as fivefold.
[5701] From the Sun-Moon Union:
[5702] The great secret tantras,
[5703] Possessing the five perfections.
[5704] Common and uncommon,
[5705] The seeds of the introduction-bases.
[5706] Thus.
[5707] From the Treasury:
[5708] The first of the four introductions arising from the Tantra.
[5709] Holding the seeds of the five.
[5710] Thus it is spoken.
[5711] These two perfections give rise to the fivefold reasons, namely:
[5712] Common and uncommon reasons.
[5713] First:
[5714] Whatever Tantra has arisen, the teacher and retinue are therein certain to be taught.
[5715] That time and place are certain to exist.
[5716] Those gathered simultaneously arise in time.
[5717] Second:
[5718] When matter and consciousness gather, the body serves as support, placed in a certain abode.
[5719] In the field of form aggregates,
[5720] The consciousness as teacher,
[5721] Gathered with perception as retinue.
[5722] The teaching of feeling arises.
[5723] Formations have five times, certain.
[5724] Those five impure aggregates of the disciple-base are
[5725] Tamed by the five perfections of the introduction-base.
[5726] Suitable for disciple and method.
[5727] From that itself:
[5728] The individual persons of disciples.
[5729] The five types of disciple-base aggregates.
[5730] The introduction-base of that method.
[5731] Thus it is spoken.
[5732] That also is called the five perfections of the introduction-base, namely:
[5733] Basis:
[5734] Abode,
[5735] Time,
[5736] Teacher,
[5737] Retinue,
[5738] The five dharmas.
[5739] Each of those also becomes threefold.
[5740] From the Treasury:
[5741] The introduction is expressed in words.
[5742] The basis has five types.
[5743] Abode is accepted as threefold.
[5744] What is called perfection is gathered.
[5745] The three appear as numbers.
[5746] The gathering of qualities is complete.
[5747] The teacher himself is also threefold.
[5748] What is called perfection is the completion of the kāyas.
[5749] The Three Kāyas arise as three.
[5750] The gathering of retinue is assembled.
[5751] The retinue is also threefold.
[5752] What is called perfection is arranged in form.
[5753] The three appear as various gatherings.
[5754] The gathering of faith and aspiration.
[5755] The teaching itself is also threefold.
[5756] What is called perfection is the very essence.
[5757] The three are the precious collections.
[5758] The gathering liberates persons.
[5759] Time also has three gathering into four.
[5760] The perfection of all vehicles.
[5761] The three are past, present,
[5762] The gathering is definitively complete.
[5763] Thus.
[5764] Second, the individual meanings extensively explained in two parts.
[5765] Uncommon introduction and,
[5766] Common introduction extensively explained.
[5767] First is:
[5768] Awareness wisdom abiding manner five perfections possessing abiding,
[5769] Uncommon introduction expressed shown.
[5770] That also clear light tantras beginning,
[5771] Thus I taught time once,
[5772] Thus arising is.
[5773] Manner basis thing nature abode ultimate truth showing,
[5774] Vehicles dark Sūtra Tantra surpassing,
[5775] From Talgyur:
[5776] Uncommon distinguished,
[5777] Vehicles all surpassing sign.
[5778] Thus it is spoken.
[5779] Here divide two:
[5780] Basis thing nature abode five perfections possessing shown and,
[5781] That arrangement body how abiding five perfections.
[5782] First is:
[5783] Abode perfection,
[5784] Reality elaborations free characteristics wherever not-established,
[5785] Words letters sphere not.
[5786] Thing abiding manner teacher perfection:
[5787] Elaboration-basis word only not thing signs not-established self-arisen awareness.
[5788] Teacher that retinue perfection.
[5789] Reality's play wisdom ocean's collection.
[5790] Teaching perfection,
[5791] Nature equality dharmadhātu ultimate abode great perfection tathātā.
[5792] Time perfection,
[5793] All not-separate one and many both not reality inconceivable clear light great time.
[5794] Thus also:
[5795] From Ratnaketu:
[5796] Not-existing empty dharmadhātu from,
[5797] Primordial first Buddha by,
[5798] Awareness and wisdom distinction from,
[5799] Reality empty self-sound,
[5800] Primordially Dharma wheel turned,
[5801] Beginning middle end without.
[5802] Thus spoken and:
[5803] Secret great's self-sphere in,
[5804] Primordially abiding from,
[5805] Not-grasped abode manner possessing,
[5806] Play great first arisen.
[5807] Thus it is spoken.
[5808] Second body's five perfections:
[5809] Abode perfection,
[5810] CITTA jewel palace channel essence great center in,
[5811] Teacher perfection,
[5812] Self-arisen awareness clear light supreme unchanging nature nature compassion three nature,
[5813] Five kāyas,
[5814] Five Wisdoms,
[5815] Five lights,
[5816] Five Wisdoms,
[5817] Five winds,
[5818] Bindu tiny etcetera retinue perfection surrounding,
[5819] Dharma perfection,
[5820] Channel wind bindu key points and,
[5821] Key point arisen bliss-clear non-conceptual wisdom advice practice experience with,
[5822] Time perfection,
[5823] Awareness meaning familiar self-arisen self arisen,
[5824] From Sun-Moon-Joined:
[5825] CITTA jewel palace,
[5826] Self-awareness wisdom manifest arisen,
[5827] Wisdom self-arisen teacher great,
[5828] Kāyas and wisdoms bindus,
[5829] Non-conceptual enumerate retinue arisen,
[5830] Advice practice teaching manner,
[5831] That familiar time also.
[5832] Thus and:
[5833] From Talgyur:
[5834] Retinue and transcended beginning,
[5835] Self-arisen made without from,
[5836] Elements gathered aggregates arisen,
[5837] Earth water fire wind jewel four,
[5838] Center wind-mind cause and condition,
[5839] Gathered produced palace without,
[5840] Self-arisen awareness unaltered,
[5841] Delusion completely pure,
[5842] Great bliss gathered means retinue,
[5843] Kāyas and wisdoms wisdom winds,
[5844] Not-divide various focus without,
[5845] Channel wind means great bliss dharmas,
[5846] Individual experience suitable explained.
[5847] Past future present not,
[5848] Not-divide division completely not,
[5849] All self-arisen wisdom.
[5850] Thus it is spoken.
[5851] Incidentally mind gathered one gathered five perfections:
[5852] The perfection of place—
[5853] Within the vast and open sky of dharmadhātu's spacious expanse,
[5854] The perfection of teacher—
[5855] Samantabhadra, gathering the hosts of self-mind's delusion-appearances.
[5856] The perfection of retinue—
[5857] The five outer objects,
[5858] The six inner thought-collections, habitual delusion-appearances.
[5859] The perfection of teaching—
[5860] The dharmas of saṃsāra: grasping, holding, self, other, karma, and afflictions.
[5861] The perfection of time—
[5862] From beginningless and endless time, the moment consciousness grasps at appearances through conceptual analysis, absorption, higher realms, and habitual tendencies.
[5863] In summary: delusion-appearances arisen in mind, the dharmas of saṃsāra gathered under the name of five perfections are shown,
[5864] From the Ratnaketu Tantra:
[5865] From the pure aspect of appearance-making and grasping,
[5866] Outer objects appear like a retinue.
[5867] Thus it is spoken.
[5868] Second, the common prologue extensively explained:
[5869] From the Thalgyur:
[5870] The teacher's speech reveals to the retinue,
[5871] The chief of marvelous, supreme gathered teachings.
[5872] The common prologue of causes and conditions,
[5873] To accord with the door of other scriptures,
[5874] Is famously called "common."
[5875] Thus:
[5876] As it appears in the scriptures and tantras of common vehicles,
[5877] So too in this great secret definitive Tantra,
[5878] Following the uncommon prologue,
[5879] "Thus have I heard at one time," and so forth, is spoken.
[5880] That also shows accordance with all vehicle scriptures,
[5881] For the meaning is uncommon;
[5882] That meaning is shown through explanation,
[5883] Abandoning doubt about where, when, by which teacher, to which retinue, this doctrine was taught—the common prologue is spoken with these in mind.
[5884] How is it spoken? At the time the Tantra arose, where was the place?
[5885] That teacher, being of one essence with the Three Kāyas, must speak;
[5886] The manner:
[5887] Dharmakāya—speech of meaning-essence through blessing,
[5888] Saṃbhogakāya—speech that distinguishes pure, clear self-nature,
[5889] Nirmāṇakāya—speech in the manner of the sixty melodious speech-qualities, well-arranged in word and verse.
[5890] Those words also, from the hearer's consciousness,
[5891] Arise without sound or letters in meaning.
[5892] From the Uttaratantra:
[5893] Like an echo, without letters,
[5894] Thus it is spoken.
[5895] As the sound of an echo—
[5896] Arising from another's awareness,
[5897] Without concept, without fabrication,
[5898] Thus is the Tathāgata's speech.
[5899] Without concept, without fabrication,
[5900] Neither abiding outside nor within.
[5901] By this manner.
[5902] Regarding that, the places where the Tantra arises are of three types:
[5903] Dharmakāya's abode:
[5904] Within the great palace of dharmadhātu,
[5905] Teacher Samantabhadra,
[5906] To the gathering of the ocean of wisdom-retinue,
[5907] The Dharma of Great Perfection, self-nature,
[5908] At the time beyond expression of dharmatā,
[5909] Is spoken without words or letters.
[5910] Saṃbhogakāya's abode:
