[1754] Now, regarding the explanation of the progressive manner of taking experience through the definite path:
[1755] Those with object-mind enter definitely through the supreme method that leads above, and
[1756] Those with the mind of rigpa's self-appearance take direct experience through the well-said pith instructions that are definite, traversing in this very life to the great liberation city through the secret supreme method.
[1757] The common approach: from the progressive entry of the definite mind, it is shown beginning with
[1758] The meaning of the first ground, in which there are three kinds of ties:
[1759] Who performs the experience-taking: the distinction of the yogin, and
[1760] How the experience-taking manner is made definite, and
[1761] The actual meaning of experience-taking is shown.
[1762] First, among these three:
[1763] The common distinction,
[1764] The explanation of individual meanings,
[1765] The definite supreme place.
[1766] First:
[1767] From the Rang-shar:
<tantra> [1768] Kye kye! Close assembly, listen!
<tantra> [1769] The characteristic word yogin, and
<tantra> [1770] The sign-mere-holding yogin, and
<tantra> [1771] The following yogin itself, and
<tantra> [1772] The nature-definite yogin, and
<tantra> [1773] The appearance-mind yogin, and
<tantra> [1774] The enter-action yogin, and
<tantra> [1775] The action-cause yogin, and
<tantra> [1776] The doer-condition yogin, and
<tantra> [1777] The end-arrive-fruit yogin, and
<tantra> [1778] The authentic-meaning yogin, and
<tantra> [1779] The end-arrive-liberation yogin, and
<tantra> [1780] The done-complete yogin.
[1781] Thus it is spoken.
[1782] Second: regarding the explanation of individual meanings, from among the twelve yogins,
[1783] The first eight do not liberate, and
[1784] The manner of liberation of the later four is definitely shown.
[1785] Also from that itself:
<tantra> [1786] The characteristic word yogin:
<tantra> [1787] Attachs to words and engages with words,
<tantra> [1788] Relying upon not-knowing words.
<tantra> [1789] I do not speak that itself as liberated.
<tantra> [1790] The sign-relying yogin:
<tantra> [1791] From relying upon signs of self itself,
<tantra> [1792] Doing conduct that flatters others,
<tantra> [1793] Binding self with thoughts of self.
<tantra> [1794] I do not speak that also as liberated.
<tantra> [1795] The following-enter yogin:
<tantra> [1796] Dwells in whatever ground of faith,
<tantra> [1797] Doing conduct of faith,
<tantra> [1798] Placing hope in the first ground.
[1799] I do not speak that itself as liberated.
<tantra> [1800] The nature-definite yogin:
<tantra> [1801] Meditates one-pointedly, variously not-thinking,
<tantra> [1802] Possesses the nature of not-thinking.
<tantra> [1803] I do not speak that also as liberated.
<tantra> [1804] The appearance-mind yogin:
<tantra> [1805] All arisen from my mind,
<tantra> [1806] Realizing mind-itself, what is there to do?
<tantra> [1807] Thus expressing all,
<tantra> [1808] I do not speak as liberated.
<tantra> [1809] The enter-action yogin:
<tantra> [1810] Regards accomplishing the action of meaning itself,
<tantra> [1811] Those bound by great action,
<tantra> [1812] Do action-generating the first mind,
<tantra> [1813] From that grasping action all,
<tantra> [1814] Accomplishing all doing.
<tantra> [1815] I do not speak that also as liberated.
<tantra> [1816] The action-cause yogin:
<tantra> [1817] Raises the path of tantra itself,
<tantra> [1818] Hoping in cause, relying upon cause,
<tantra> [1819] Manifestly showing cause itself.
<tantra> [1820] I do not speak that also as liberated.
<tantra> [1821] The doer-condition yogin:
<tantra> [1822] Seeks authentic meaning through conduct,
<tantra> [1823] Holds the not-same side of caste,
<tantra> [1824] I do not speak that also as liberated.
<tantra> [1825] The end-arrive-fruit yogin:
<tantra> [1826] Carries the path of realization,
<tantra> [1827] Does not dwell in ground-path,
<tantra> [1828] From seeing self that-ness,
<tantra> [1829] Is regarded as great authentic liberation.
<tantra> [1830] The authentic meaning yogin:
<tantra> [1831] Also obtains self-realization,
<tantra> [1832] In pure bardo-appearance,
<tantra> [1833] From seeing authentic self,
<tantra> [1834] Is regarded as end-arrive liberated.
<tantra> [1835] The end-arrive liberation yogin:
<tantra> [1836] The certainty-obtaining yogin,
<tantra> [1837] In the ground itself of certainty-obtaining,
<tantra> [1838] From seeing obtain self that-ness,
<tantra> [1839] Is regarded as beyond authentic ground.
<tantra> [1840] The done-complete yogin:
<tantra> [1841] Is the primordially-pure great buddha;
<tantra> [1842] From that gone, I do not speak.
<tantra> [1843] In the four great yogins,
<tantra> [1844] I do not speak ground-purify,
<tantra> [1845] I do not speak path-traverse.
[1846] Thus.
[1847] That also: by different manner of path-meditation,
[1848] Here direct light-clear doing, below newly-enter, although ground-path purify-traverse not-need speak
[1849] Self path: with gate-three defilement and with-attachment aggregate, and
[1850] Moving thought, and
[1851] By needing to purify coarse wind-mind mind,
[1852] When those are pure: below ground-path incidentally complete, signs dawn.
[1853] Above complete by below incidentally complete become—aim in one great-completion.
[1854] Purify-traverse not-need speak.
<tantra> [1855] Ground one: rigpa spontaneously-accomplished,
<tantra> [1856] In all-doing,
<tantra> [1857] Rigpa spontaneously-complete, not-transform not-purify.
<tantra> [1858] Thus like.
[1859] Third: in the definite supreme place, generally showing the distinction of the yogin, and
[1860] From two in individual explanation of vessel-possess.
