[19304] <prose>First, primordially pure space spontaneous own-tone, crystal within-light like exist, manifestly color clear without, light five.</prose>
[19305] <tantra>From Sun-Moon Mouth-Union:</tantra>
[19306] <verse>Not-abide wisdom ground pure, color beyond light, stain without white, self-place pure, appearance where also not divide.

[19311] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra> || 10 ||
[19312] <prose>Now path-appearance and bardo self-appearance, all's life this from light five out arise.</prose>
[19313] <prose>Now or bardo or ground-appearance's set time, this five's space self dissolve.</prose>
[19314] <prose>Briefly: inner body and wisdom abide pure; out appearance body and wisdom appearance arise-place and exhaust-ground, two both are.</prose>
[19315] <prose>Second, color-hold light five:</prose>
[19316] <tantra>From Self-Arise:</tantra>
[19317] <verse>From wisdom, light arises.
[19318] From unchange wisdom, blue arises.
[19319] From pure wisdom, white arises.
[19320] From wisdom quality-arising, yellow arises.

[19333] <prose>Fourth, bindu: three.</prose>
[19334] <tantra>From Sun-Moon Mouth-Union:</tantra>
[19335] <verse>Bindu three:</verse>

[19338] <list>Fruit self-ripen bindu.</list>
[19339] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra> || 30 ||
[19340] <prose>First: heart within light five spontaneous bindu, light-channel essence within abide.</prose>
[19341] <prose>Light five's rim appear-by-means-of, nature light's bindu named.</prose>
[19342] <prose>That pure-from-birth awareness ornamentate-by-means-of, all-good bindu named.</prose>
[19343] <tantra>From that:</tantra>
[19344] <verse>Ground-hold bindu two:
[19345] Nature light's bindu and all-good bindu.</verse>
[19346] <tantra>Thus said.</tantra>
[19347] <prose>This itself secret-gather unbreakable bindu say;</prose>

[19349] <verse>Always heart abide,
[19350] Bindu one change without.</verse>
[19351] <prose>Second:</prose> || 40 ||
[19352] <verse>Definite wisdom arise become.</verse>
[19353] <prose>Appearance-path's bindu two:</prose>
[19354] <list>Conventional cause's bindu and</list>
[19355] <list>Abide ultimate's bindu.</list>
[19356] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[19357] <prose>First: prior also extensively shown; slightly explained.</prose>
[19358] <tantra>From that:</tantra>
[19359] <verse>Conventional cause's bindu embodied all's channel within abide.
[19360] Father's cause and mother's condition appear.
[19361] That also elements essence gather, mother bindu red become.
[19362] Bodhicitta all's sediment gather, father's bindu white become.</verse>
[19363] <prose>Therefore elements gather from form ripen; bodhicitta gather from mindfulness-thought and feeling and awareness gather.</prose> || 50 ||
[19364] <prose>That also miraculously-born, egg-born, warmth-moisture-born: at these also elements gather seed, and bodhicitta gather seed, two self-constituent gather from birth take.</prose>
[19365] <prose>Thus embodied all at body gather do, bindu white-red two self-constituent abide.</prose>
[19366] <prose>That male at elements seed, elements own-scope self-absorb, manifestly not appear; female at bodhicitta seed, ground unchange, manifestly not emerge.</prose>
[19367] <prose>Therefore bun-without at bliss meditate suitable; bindu and wind meditate, even unliberated for.</prose>
[19368] <prose>Thus seed two-by-means-of aggregates support do; persons life's conditioning also this two-by-means-of do.</prose>
[19369] <verse>Elements self-self awareness enemy temporarily condition.
[19370] This two abide from transfer do is.</verse>
[19371] <tantra>Thus it is proclaimed.</tantra>
[19372] <tantra>Thus said.</tantra> || 60 ||
[19373] <prose>First: that male at bindu and elements seed two separate for.</prose>
[19374] <prose>Seed first channel-view's support, manifestly not appear; female at elements essence pure lower-tip, secret-place space-protector wheel's within A's form abide, manifestly not appear.</prose>
[19375] <prose>Bindu manifestly flow support also; this two action do.</prose>
[19376] <prose>Bindu's seed is and elements essence gather seed named.</prose>
[19377] <prose>This two's difference distinguish essential.</prose>
[19378] <prose>Second:</prose>
[19379] <tantra>From Sun-Moon Mouth-Union:</tantra>
[19380] <verse>Abide ultimate's bindu two: || 70 ||
[19381] Self-abide cause's bindu, breath male habituation from arise.
[19382] Self-abide cause's bindu: embodied all's heart within light essence gather bindu,

[19384] <prose>Sometimes channels within within move and abide; male habituation from arise.</prose>
[19385] <prose>Second:</prose>

[19387] <prose>Distinguishing: path complete without-mistake self characteristic hold body, and light body characteristic color undivided thus-just-as-is body, two from first:</prose>
[19388] <tantra>From Sun-Moon Mouth-Union:</tantra>
[19389] <verse>Through essence, nature, compassion three, || 80 ||
[19390] Holding path's characteristic,

[19397] <prose>Second, the thus-just-as-is body: ground and path and fruit three.</prose>
[19398] <prose>Ground self-arisen wisdom abide body, path light tone space body thus-prior from out appearance merely from unchangeable body,</prose>
[19399] <prose>fruit three bodies spontaneous space exhaust ground reach body, three and that from:</prose> || 90 ||
[19300] <tantra>From that itself:</tantra>
[19301] <prose>Thus-just-as-is body this-like: thus-abide first body, thus-prior unchangeable body, and fruit self-perfect body.</prose>
[19302] <prose>Fruit self-perfect body three: dharmakaya elaboration without great, enjoyment-body complete hold without great, emanation-body self without great.</prose>
