[6421] At the fourth, the thousand suns' king, and

The fourth emanation in the sequence of primordial teachers manifests as the thousand suns' king (nyi stong gi rgyal po), appearing during the fourth teaching epoch. This Buddha's title evokes the imagery of a thousand suns simultaneously illuminating the universe, representing the complete dispelling of darkness through the radiance of awakened wisdom.

According to the Great Arrangement (mahāvyūha) teachings recorded in the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra:

"Then at the fourth teaching,
The thousand suns' king, and
By the thousand Buddhas, dominion conquered."

This emanation holds the distinction of having "dominion conquered" (dbang bsgyur) by the collective power of the thousand Buddhas, indicating that this Buddha's sovereignty extends across all realms through the unified blessing of the entire mandala of enlightened beings. The imagery of a thousand suns suggests the simultaneous arising of countless wisdom-illuminations, each capable of dispelling the darkness of ignorance in innumerable world-systems.

The "king" (rgyal po) designation emphasizes this emanation's regal authority in the spiritual hierarchy—the ability to command the forces of virtue and to establish the dharma as the governing principle of existence. Through this emanation, beings receive the empowerment to recognize their own innate luminosity, the self-arisen wisdom that shines spontaneously without dependence on external causes or conditions.

This fourth emanation represents a pivotal transition in the emanation sequence, where the protective functions of the earlier emanations give way to the active illumination of wisdom-awareness, preparing the ground for the subsequent emanations' more specialized functions.
