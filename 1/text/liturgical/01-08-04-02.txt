[10724] Second, if one asserts like this: consciousness being momentary, the basis follows as momentary; and
[10725] Consciousness having many thoughts and realizations, the basis also follows as that; and
[10726] Consciousness being under the power of afflictive conditions, the basis also follows as that.
[10727] Third, if one asserts like this: the basis follows as external and internal; and
[10728] The basis follows as grasped and grasper; and
[10729] The basis follows as the six collections, the object of abandonment, one-sided.
[10730] Moreover, the basis cannot be held as a single expanse,
[10731] Because it is an assembly of many.
[10732] The faults such as these:
[10733] From the Six Expanses:
[10734] "The Teacher spoke scattered above."
[10735] "This also, because it does not accord with the side,
[10736] Whose essence is that appearance,
[10737] The result is different; that meaning is similar.
[10738] Because deterioration comes through many sounds."
[10739] "Are not these knowable dharmas?
[10740] What was spoken is just like that."
[10741] Thus it is.
[10742] The seventh position is also expressed:
[10743] The primordial wisdom of self-arisen awareness, being free from the extremes of existence and non-existence, is not established merely as primordial wisdom.
[10744] One holds that from the aspect of the great bindu free from elaborations, it is not established anywhere.
[10745] Second, the refutation of that:
[10746] Thus, if primordial wisdom not established as anything, not existing merely as primordial wisdom, being pure from the beginning, is the natural state without anything to place anywhere—if there were nothing, this contradicts being the expanse from which samsara and nirvana arise.
[10747] If primordial wisdom does not exist, because the liberation of Buddhas and sentient beings does not exist, liberation through realizing the basis is also not logical.
[10748] If the subtle five lights do not exist, because there is no cause for basis-appearances to arise, from that state basis-appearances are not logical.
[10749] The non-realized mind of delusion is not logical.
[10750] From the Six Expanses:
[10751] "Because the essence itself is primordially pure,
[10752] Sentient beings' samsara is not logical.
[10753] Because stains of non-awareness are primordially exhausted."
[10754] Thus, it is similar to the previous six bases.
[10755] Third: establishing the non-dual basis of primordial purity and spontaneous presence as one's own system has two parts: the actual meaning and
[10756] Abandoning disputes regarding that.
