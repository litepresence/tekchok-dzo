[10912] <list> Nirmana-kaya: these three.</list>
[10913] <prose> Though common vehicles consider the Three Kayas as fruition,</prose>
[10914] <prose> according to this Great Perfection system, the Three Kayas are regarded as path-appearances.</prose>
[10915] <prose> Dharma-kaya is self-appearance:</prose>
[10916] <prose> as long as dharmas exist, mind exists, therefore it is the path;</prose>
[10917] <prose> as long as the kaya exists, the body exists, therefore it is also path-appearance;</prose>
[10918] <prose> it is not the ultimate.</prose>
[10919] <prose> When this actual main measure is reached and completed,</prose>
[10920] <prose> the appearance of exhaustion: || 20 ||</prose>
[10921] <prose> dissolving into primordial purity, near to that, this is it.</prose>
[10922] <prose> Sambhoga-kaya and Nirmana-kaya are path-appearances:</prose>
[10923] <prose> in the rank of existing phenomena of various appearances,</prose>
[10924] <prose> not ultimate, for they are free of extremes, markless, and equal.</prose>
[10925] <prose> At the time when this measure is reached,</prose>
[10926] <prose> from the appearance of spontaneous accomplishment, kayas,</prose>
[10927] <prose> pure-lands,</prose>
[10928] <prose> and teachers appear.</prose>
[10929] <ornament> Characteristics:</ornament>
[10930] <prose> The nature of path-appearance is clear light and emptiness. || 30 ||</prose>
[10931] <ornament> Fruition:</ornament>
[10932] <prose> When moved within the secret interior of primordially-pure jewel,</prose>
[10933] <prose> the inner clear Three Kayas dwell merely as the basis of arising.</prose>
[10934] <prose> Through familiarization with such path-appearance kaya-dharmata,</prose>
[10935] <prose> from Blazing Relics, the signs of obtained Three Kayas are:</prose>
[10936] <prose> The measure of kayas trained:</prose>
[10937] <verse> Whoever has familiarized with the kaya,</verse>
[10938] <verse> For the person endowed with fortune,</verse>
[10939] <verse> Prior signs are like this:</verse>
[10940] <verse> Whoever has familiarized with Dharma-kaya, || 40 ||</verse>
[10941] <verse> In the field of activity seen by others,</verse>
[10942] <verse> The body not seen by anyone,</verse>
[10943] <verse> The yogin self-freely plays.</verse>
[10944] <verse> Samadhi of not seeking, placed as is,</verse>
[10945] <verse> Arises in one's own continuum,</verse>
[10946] <verse> Experience of awareness without thought,</verse>
[10947] <verse> Appears in the mind of all yogins. || 50 ||</verse>
[10948] <verse> Persons arising thus,</verse>
[10949] <verse> See the appearance of Dharma-kaya.</verse>
[10950] <verse> Seeing this, all Buddhas'</verse>
[10951] <verse> Kayas gather in the expanse.</verse>
[10952] <verse> Whoever in Sambhoga-kaya,</verse>
[10953] <verse> Has familiarized and gained confidence, || 60 ||</verse>
[10954] <verse> The person experiencing thus,</verse>
[10955] <verse> Plays in the five kayas, five wisdoms.</verse>
[10956] <verse> With the gaze of great play,</verse>
[10957] <verse> Thus possessing these signs,</verse>
[10958] <verse> The fortunate one possessing yogic fortune,</verse>
[10959] <verse> The lamp of empty bindu, || 70 ||</verse>
[10960] <verse> Arising without effort,</verse>
[10961] <verse> Appearance itself also as kaya,</verse>
[10962] <verse> The person seeing gradually,</verse>
[10963] <verse> Sees the root of Sambhoga-kaya by this.</verse>
[10964] <verse> Thus familiar in the continuum,</verse>
[10965] <verse> Speech clear, possessing voice, || 80 ||</verse>
[10966] <verse> Words of lying speech</verse>
[10967] <prose> Likewise, words of non-virtuous action:</prose>
[10968] <verse> Always spoken expression ends, ceases.</verse>
[10969] <verse> Thus that one possessing signs,</verse>
[10970] <verse> If this meaning is practiced, || 90 ||</verse>
[10971] <verse> Flying in the sky,</verse>
[10972] <verse> Transparent through mountains and rocks,</verse>
[10973] <verse> Entering under the earth,</verse>
[10974] <verse> Arising without drowning in water.</verse>
[10975] <verse> Thus the fortunate one who arises,</verse>
[10976] <verse> If confidence in expanse-awareness is not entered, || 100 ||</verse>
[10977] <verse> The elements themselves dissolve,</verse>
[10978] <verse> Changing itself is not.</verse>
[10979] <verse> From this, transferring birth,</verse>
[10980] <verse> In the bardo of reality,</verse>
[10981] <verse> Liberates in five instants. || 110 ||</verse>
[10982] <verse> What person endowed with fortune,</verse>
[10983] <verse> Having familiarized with Nirmana-kaya,</verse>
[10984] <verse> This person who has gained confidence:</verse>
[10985] <prose> These signs of body, speech, and mind:</prose>
[10986] <verse> In whom arise such signs, || 120 ||</verse>
[10987] <verse> This one also becomes fortunate.</verse>
[10988] <verse> Dharmas heard before,</verse>
[10989] <verse> Their meaning in one's own continuum,</verse>
[10990] <verse> Arises simultaneously,</verse>
[10991] <verse> By this becomes dakini. || 130 ||</verse>
[10992] <verse> Likewise, various words</verse>
[10993] <verse> Of dharma not heard before,</verse>
[10994] <verse> Speak from the mouth in nature.</verse>
[10995] <prose> Likewise, words of other secret mantra tantras:</prose>
[10996] <verse> Tantra words as they are, || 140 ||</verse>
[10997] <verse> In order, become clearly manifest.</verse>
[10998] <verse> Likewise, all dharmas,</verse>
[10999] <verse> All forms of word and meaning,</verse>
[11000] <verse> How beings have faith, || 150 ||</verse>
[11001] <verse> Dharmas also accord with that,</verse>
[11002] <verse> How the answer to what is asked,</verse>
[11003] <verse> This fortunate one speaks,</verse>
[11004] <verse> This is the speech-lion.</verse>
[11005] <verse> Body strength greater than before, || 160 ||</verse>
[11006] <verse> Also gains swift foot strength,</verse>
[11007] <verse> Body without wrinkles,</verse>
[11008] <verse> White hair also becomes black,</verse>
[11009] <verse> Likewise, like one of sixteen years,</verse>
[11010] <verse> Also possessing youth's luster, || 170 ||</verse>
[11011] <verse> Like grass to youth,</verse>
[11012] <verse> When rain again falls,</verse>
[11013] <verse> Growing self-grown like that,</verse>
[11014] <verse> Compassion not existing before,</verse>
[11015] <verse> Arises from depth in this, || 180 ||</verse>
[11016] <prose> After that, enters benefit of beings.</prose>
[11017] <verse> When beings arise for benefit</verse>
[11018] <verse> Of one's own body,</verse>
[11019] <verse> This one can give body || 190 ||</verse>
[11020] <verse> And limbs as desired,</verse>
[11021] <verse> What need to mention outer possessions?</verse>
[11022] <verse> Likewise, to one's own guru,</verse>
[11023] <verse> Can give body and so forth as before,</verse>
[11024] <verse> Thus the person in whom this arises, || 200 ||</verse>
[11025] <prose> Touches Nirmana-kaya by this.</prose>
[11026] <tantra> Thus it is said.</tantra>
[11027] <prose> Thus, that one possessing Nirmana-kaya signs, if desiring, takes miraculous birth in the field of natural Nirmana-kaya, dwells sixty-eight thousand years for the benefit of beings,</prose>
[11028] <prose> from that state emanates in many millions of four continents, doing immeasurable benefit for beings,</prose>
[11029] <prose> crosses the ground with primordial purity. || 210 ||</prose>
[11030] <prose> If thinking this contradicts five hundred years in natural emanation:</prose>
[11031] <prose> It does not contradict.</prose>
[11032] <prose> Though dwelling five hundred for self-benefit,</prose>
[11033] <prose> dwelling limitless for other-benefit has no contradiction whatsoever.</prose>
[11034] <prose> Also, from that itself:</prose>
[11035] <verse> Thus the person possessing, || 220 ||</verse>
[11036] <verse> Later in Nirmana-kaya realms,</verse>
[11037] <verse> Taking miraculous birth body,</verse>
[11038] <verse> Sixty-eight thousand years,</verse>
[11039] <verse> Dwelling there, benefit of beings,</verse>
[11040] <verse> This person does. || 230 ||</verse>
[11041] <verse> Then from essence nature,</verse>
[11042] <verse> In Jambudvipa and other continents,</verse>
[11043] <verse> Sixty thousand million emanations,</verse>
[11044] <verse> Taking suitable bodies,</verse>
[11045] <verse> Do benefit of beings, || 240 ||</verse>
[11046] <verse> This becomes dakini.</verse>
[11047] <verse> Then essence primordially-pure,</verse>
[11048] <verse> Like sun rays gathering,</verse>
[11049] <verse> Own emanation with,</verse>
[11050] <verse> Own essence self-dissolves, || 250 ||</verse>
[11051] <verse> Without difference, without distinction becomes.</verse>
[11052] <verse> As water dissolves in water,</verse>
[11053] <verse> Likewise butter in butter,</verse>
[11054] <verse> Like sky dissolves in sky,</verse>
[11055] <verse> Essence without identification becomes. || 260 ||</verse>
[11056] <tantra> Thus it is said.</tantra>
[11057] <ornament> Inner Awareness Experience:</ornament>
[11058] <prose> From self-arisen:</prose>

[11063] <prose> Body bliss without grasping,</prose>
[11064] <prose> Awareness becomes one-pointed,</prose>

[11066] <prose> Awareness not distracted,</prose>
[11067] <prose> Awareness not entering other,</prose>
[11068] <prose> Realizing awareness as not anything,</prose>
[11069] <prose> Awareness not changing,</prose>
[11070] <prose> Awareness clear without ceasing, || 280 ||</prose>
[11071] <prose> Awareness ceasing without thought,</prose>
[11072] <prose> Awareness self-liberated without grasping,</prose>
[11073] <prose> Small grasping at outer and inner dharmas,</prose>
[11074] <prose> Without attachment and clinging to body,</prose>

[11100] <ornament> Characteristics:</ornament>
[11101] <prose> Self-clear naked: this.</prose>
[11102] <ornament> Fruition:</ornament>
[11103] <prose> By practicing that, liberating into primordially-pure transparent-penetration.</prose>
[11104] <prose> Though commonly considering Three Kayas as fruition, || 330 ||</prose>
[11105] <prose> here making them the path,</prose>
[11106] <prose> primordially-pure extreme-free great, kaya and wisdom not established,</prose>
[11107] <prose> considering as fruition the arise-basis not-ceasing, like crystal: this distinction is great.</prose>
[11108] <prose> Signs of rigpa trained in such view:</prose>
[11109] <prose> From Blazing Relics:</prose>
[11110] <verse> Whoever has familiarized with rigpa, || 340 ||</verse>
[11111] <verse> Signs on that body are these:</verse>
[11112] <verse> Whatever thing placed where,</verse>
[11113] <verse> There can insert self-awareness.</verse>
[11114] <verse> Wherever dwells, in that ground,</verse>
[11115] <verse> Body also follows that, || 350 ||</verse>

[11140] <ornament> First:</ornament>
[11141] <prose> The yogin who has gained confidence in realizing primordially-pure: for that one, signs of not taking rebirth again in existence are body without insects, and</prose>
[11142] <prose> hair and fingernails not growing: these two.</prose>
[11143] <prose> Then, in three months, others see light five center, five kayas of race rising in sky, dissolving: || 410 ||</prose>
[11144] <prose> from Blazing Relics:</prose>
[11145] <verse> Whoever unborn,</verse>
[11146] <verse> Person cut at root,</verse>
[11147] <verse> Signs like this also arise.</verse>
[11148] <verse> This one possessing these signs, || 420 ||</verse>
[11149] <verse> Fortune equal to me.</verse>
[11150] <verse> Insects, etcetera, in body,</verse>

[11152] <verse> Whoever hair and fingernails, || 430 ||</verse>
[11153] <verse> This all not-grow, continuum ceases,</verse>
[11154] <verse> This is without birth.</verse>
[11155] <verse> Thus possessing signs,</verse>
[11156] <verse> In three months also, || 440 ||</verse>
[11157] <verse> This dissolves in elements' own,</verse>
[11158] <verse> Contaminated aggregates not appearing,</verse>
[11159] <verse> Own body in light tone center,</verse>
[11160] <verse> With race, this becomes. || 450 ||</verse>
[11161] <tantra> Thus it is said.</tantra>
[11162] <prose> This is the great-fortune yogin of exhaustion time.</prose>
[11163] <ornament> Second:</ornament>
[11164] <prose> Praise of those qualities:</prose>
[11165] <prose> Appearance qualities of body and speech, || 460 ||</prose>
[11166] <prose> and not-awareness empty qualities immeasurable:</prose>
[11167] <prose> enjoying peaceful-wrathful two mandalas and Dharma-kaya qualities in Buddha-field of own-appearance:</prose>
[11168] <prose> from that itself:</prose>
[11169] <verse> Thus the person who realizes, || 470 ||</verse>
[11170] <verse> Inconceivable existence-nonexistence qualities,</verse>
[11171] <verse> Wisdom dwelling as one,</verse>
[11172] <verse> Self self-showing great teacher,</verse>
[11173] <verse> Primordial tone dwells in self without arrangement, || 480 ||</verse>
[11174] <verse> From nature of method and wisdom,</verse>
[11175] <verse> Buddha race also appears as two,</verse>
[11176] <verse> This all appears as that retinue,</verse>
[11177] <verse> From ground-appearance without nature, || 490 ||</verse>
[11178] <verse> Dharmas appear inexpressible by speech, thought, expression,</verse>
[11179] <verse> Also equal in three times,</verse>
[11180] <verse> Primordially all this self-dwells. || 500 ||</verse>
[11181] <tantra> Thus it is said.</tantra>
