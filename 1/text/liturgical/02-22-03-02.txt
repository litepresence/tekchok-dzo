[10900] Fourth, kaya—five aspects:
[10901] Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.
[10902] Essence: abiding as support of nirvana dharmas, nature always dwelling.
[10903] Definition: stainless transparent-penetrate, great self-complete.
[10904] Division: dharma-kaya, sambhogakaya, nirmanakaya—three.
[10905] Though common vehicles consider three kayas as result, Great Perfection's system considers three kayas as path appearance. Dharma-kaya is own-appearance—as long as dharma exists, mind exists, this is path. As long as kaya exists, body exists, this is path appearance—not final.
[10906] This main reaching complete measure is exhaustion appearance, dissolving near primordially pure.
[10907] Sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya are path appearance—various appearing dharmas exist in rank, not final extreme-free mark-free equality.
[10908] At measure-reaching time, kayas, fields, and teachers appear from spontaneously accomplished appearance.
[10909] Characteristic: path appearance clear-light empty nature.
[10910] Result: when primordially pure jewel secret inside moves, inner clear three kayas dwell only as arise-basis.
[10911] Familiarizing with such path appearance kaya reality, obtained appear-experience three kaya signs.
[10912] From Blazing Relics:
[10913] Kaya measure trained,
[10914] Upon fortunate person,
[10915] Before, signs like this:
[10916] Who familiar with dharma-kaya,
[10917] Body not seen by others
[10918] In their seen activity-field,
[10919] Yogin plays self-freely.
[10920] Samadhi of not-seeking, placed,
[10921] Arises in own continuum,
[10922] Awareness not-thinking experience,
[10923] Appears in all yogins' minds.
[10924] Thus arisen persons
[10925] See dharma-kaya appearance,
[10926] Seeing this, all buddhas'
[10927] Kayas gather in expanse.
[10928] Signs of familiarity and confidence with sambhogakaya:
[10929] Person experiencing thus
[10930] Plays in five kayas, five wisdoms,
[10931] By gaze of great play—
[10932] Thus possessing signs,
[10933] That fortunate possessing yogin,
[10934] Upon empty bindu lamp
[10935] Arising without effort,
[10936] Appearance also becoming kaya,
[10937] Person seeing gradually
[10938] Sees sambhogakaya root by this.
[10939] Continuum familiar thus,
[10940] Speech clear, possessing voice,
[10941] Words of lying say
[10942] Not arising from this mouth—
[10943] Likewise words of non-virtue action
[10944] 
[10945] 
[10946] 
[10947] 
[10948] 
[10949] 
[10950] 
[10951] 
[10952] 
[10953] 
[10954] 
[10955] 
[10956] 
[10957] 
[10958] 
[10959] 
[10960] 
[10961] 
[10962] 
[10963] 
[10964] 
[10965] 
[10966] 
[10967] 
[10968] Always saying, expression-end ceases.
[10969] Thus possessing signs,
[10970] If practice this meaning,
[10971] Fly in sky,
[10972] Transparently penetrate mountain rocks,
[10973] Enter under ground,
[10974] Arise without drowning in water.
[10975] Thus arisen fortunate one,
[10976] If confidence not entering expanse-awareness,
[10977] Elements dissolve to self,
[10978] Change is not self—
[10979] From this, transferring birth,
[10980] In reality bardo,
[10981] Liberate in five instants.
[10982] What person possessing fortune,
[10983] Familiar with nirmanakaya,
[10984] This person becoming confident,
[10985] These body, speech, mind signs,
[10986] In whom arise,
[10987] This also becomes fortune.
[10988] Meaning of dharma heard before,
[10989] Also in own continuum
[10990] Arises simultaneously—
[10991] This becomes dakini.
[10992] Likewise various words
[10993] Of dharma not heard before,
[10994] Speak from mouth by nature—
[10995] Likewise words of other secret mantra
[10996] Tantras, as words,
[10997] How clear according to order—
[10998] Likewise all dharmas,
[10999] All word meaning forms,
[11000] Beings' faith,
[11001] Dharmas and accord,
[11002] How asking, that answer,
[11003] This fortunate one speaks,
[11004] This is speech lion.
[11005] Strength greater than previous,
[11006] Gain fast foot strength,
[11007] Body without wrinkles,
[11008] White hair becomes black,
[11009] Likewise like sixteen years,
[11010] Possessing youth luster,
[11011] Example: grass upon youth,
[11012] Rain falls again,
[11013] Grows like self-grow—
[11014] Compassion not existing before
[11015] Arises from depth in this,
[11016] After that enters beings' benefit.
[11017] When beings arise
[11018] For benefit of own body,
[11019] However this desires,
[11020] Able to give body and limbs—
[11021] What need to mention outer possessions?
[11022] Likewise able to give
[11023] Body etcetera to own guru as before.
[11024] Thus in whom arises,
[11025] This one touches nirmanakaya.
[11026] Thus when nirmanakaya signs exist, if desire, take miraculous birth in nature nirmanakaya field, dwell sixty-eight thousand years for beings' benefit, from that state emanate millions of four continents, do immeasurable benefit for beings, cross ground of primordially pure.
[11027] If think contradiction with nature emanation completing five hundred years—no contradiction. Though dwelling five hundred for self-benefit, dwelling limitless for other-benefit—no contradiction.
[11028] Also from that:
[11029] Thus possessing person,
[11030] After in nirmanakaya field,
[11031] Taking miraculously born body,
[11032] Dwelling sixty-eight thousand years,
[11033] This person does beings' benefit.
[11034] Then from essence nature,
[11035] In Jambudvipa etcetera continents,
[11036] By sixty thousand million emanations,
[11037] Taking suitable bodies,
[11038] Does beings' benefit—
[11039] This becomes, dakini.
[11040] Then to essence primordially pure,
[11041] Like sun rays gathering,
[11042] Own emanation with,
[11043] Self-dissolves into own essence,
[11044] Becomes without difference, without distinction.
[11045] As water dissolves in water,
[11046] Likewise butter in butter,
[11047] As sky dissolves in sky,
[11048] Essence becomes without identification.
[11049] Inner awareness experience:
[11050] From Self-Arisen:
[11051] Possessing that joy,
[11052] Without attachment to worldly,
[11053] All appearance arising as light,
[11054] Seeing kaya mass not ceasing in light,
[11055] Body joy without grasping,
[11056] Awareness one-pointed,
[11057] Awareness naturally slow,
[11058] Awareness not distracted,
[11059] Awareness not entering other,
[11060] Realizing awareness as not anything,
[11061] Awareness not changing,
[11062] Awareness clear without ceasing,
[11063] Awareness ceasing without thought,
[11064] 
[11065] 
[11066] 
[11067] 
[11068] 
[11069] 
[11070] 
[11071] 
[11072] Awareness self-liberating without grasping,
[11073] Small grasping at outer-inner dharmas,
[11074] No attachment or clinging to body.
[11075] Fifth, awareness—five aspects:
[11076] Essence, definition, division, characteristic, and result.
[11077] Essence: appearing as vajra chain.
[11078] From Lion Power Complete:
[11079] Own-appearance awareness thing that,
[11080] Dwells as wisdom chain.
[11081] Definition: previously not-aware, aware by guru pith-instruction, therefore awareness.
[11082] Division: three—ground-dwell awareness beyond virtue-defect fault, path-appearance awareness famous in respective philosophical systems, insight awareness.
[11083] Mind-itself, unborn, co-emergent wisdom, mind-beyond, meaning alaya, bodhicitta called—whatever name, pervading all buddhas and beings, self-awareness wisdom self-clear empty naked this.
[11084] Insight awareness: direct appearance of vajra chain kaya, free from thought word cage, without bright-dim of virtue-defect fault-merit, if diligence not distracting from that view, accomplishes light-body transparent-penetrate.
[11085] Characteristic: this naked self-clear.
[11086] Result: liberates into primordially-pure transparent-penetrate by practicing that.
[11087] Though commonly considering three kayas as result, here making path, not establishing primordially-pure extreme-free great as kaya and wisdom, considers result like crystal not-ceasing arise-basis—great distinction.
[11088] Signs of training such awareness:
[11089] From Blazing Relics:
[11090] Who familiar with awareness,
[11091] These signs upon that body:
[11092] Able to insert self-awareness there,
[11093] Wherever thing is placed,
[11094] Body follows that
[11095] Wherever ground dwells,
[11096] As same as awareness,
[11097] Able to change others' faith,
[11098] Self-ceasing thought-continuum clinging,
[11099] Possessing inner signs—
[11100] Who knows directly,
[11101] This goes to elements' own-place,
[11102] This fortunate one dissolves,
[11103] Gains supreme unborn siddhi.
[11104] 
[11105] 
[11106] 
[11107] 
[11108] 
[11109] 
[11110] 
[11111] 
[11112] 
[11113] 
[11114] 
[11115] 
[11116] 
[11117] 
[11118] 
[11119] 
[11120] 
[11121] 
[11122] 
[11123] 
[11124] 
[11125] From Result Exposition:
[11126] Thus from practice,
[11127] Signs and measure this-like:
[11128] Body light, appearing transparent-penetrate,
[11129] Without touch, without obstacle to ground,
[11130] Speech power complete, speech pair exhausted,
[11131] Mind able to transfer,
[11132] Eye, form, nose, tongue,
[11133] All body sense-faculties cease—
[11134] Measure of becoming without nature.
[11135] Third: grasping well path measures by saying other distinctions of signs—three aspects:
[11136] General showing of unborn obtaining signs,
[11137] Particular explanation of qualities signs,
[11138] Separate saying of distinction of three mixed signs.
[11139] Of the first:
[11140] Yogin entering confidence in primordially-pure realization, signs of not taking birth again in existence—no insects on body, hair and fingernails not growing. Then in three months, seen by others, five lights center, five race kayas, rising in sky and dissolving.
[11141] From Blazing Relics:
[11142] Who, by whom, unborn
[11143] Root-cut person that,
[11144] Signs like this also arise.
[11145] Who possesses this sign,
[11146] Is equal fortune with me.
[11147] Insects etcetera on body,
[11148] All these birth continuum ceases.
[11149] Who hair and fingernails,
[11150] All these not growing, continuum ceases—
[11151] This is without birth.
[11152] Thus possessing signs,
[11153] Even in three months,
[11154] This dissolves elements to self,
[11155] Contaminated aggregates not appearing,
[11156] Own body in light tone center,
[11157] With race this becomes.
[11158] This is exhaustion time yogin, great fortune.
[11159] Second: praise of that qualities—appearance body speech qualities, immeasurable awareness empty qualities not.
[11160] Enjoying peaceful-wrathful mandalas and dharma-kaya qualities in own-appearance buddha field.
[11161] 
[11162] 
[11163] 
[11164] 
[11165] 
[11166] 
[11167] 
[11168] From that:
[11169] Thus realized person,
[11170] Existing-non-existing qualities inconceivable,
[11171] Wisdom dwelling as one,
[11172] Great teacher self-showing self,
[11173] Primordial tone dwelling in self without arrangement,
[11174] From nature of method and wisdom,
[11175] Buddha race also appearing as two,
[11176] All this appearing as that retinue,
[11177] From ground-appearance without nature,
[11178] Appearing as dharma unspeakable, unthinkable, inexpressible,
[11179] Also equality of three times,
[11180] Primordially all these self-dwelling.
[11181] Third: from single only signs, from two mixed, from three possessing—if body signs complete, liberate in bardo; if body and speech two exist suitably, possessing speech signs on body, liberate in emanation field; if mind signs complete, liberate in bardo in three instants; if all three complete, do other benefit with compassion, knowing self-benefit obtain certainty, blessed for countless lives, doing benefit, that support liberates into light; if body and mind signs two exist, obtain self-benefit quickly and liberate; if speech and mind signs gather, obtain light-body in ten years; also if three signs of body, speech, and mind gather, other benefit not arising, liberate in two years.
