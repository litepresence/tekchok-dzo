[3040] First:
[3041] Nothing is established as objects.
[3042] Through unestablished awareness and wisdom, beyond speech and thought, merely in ultimate truth, existing as the manner of illusion.
[3043] The qualities of meditation and the grounds of the path.
[3044] Through the result at the end, obtaining the wisdom of Buddha like illusion, from the nature of dharma-body, working benefit like illusion.
[3045] From the intermediate mother:
[3046] All phenomena are like a dream, like an illusion.
[3047] Nirvāṇa is also like a dream, like an illusion.
[3048] If something more excellent than nirvāṇa exists.
[3049] That also is like a dream, like an illusion.
[3050] All phenomena are merely various objects and consciousness.
[3051] Nirvāṇa attains form-body and works benefit.
[3052] Therefore, the excellent dharma is one's own self-aware suchness and the supreme dharma-body.
[3053] In this, there are those who assert illusion as established reasoning.
[3054] And those who assert appearance as merely illusion.
[3055] And those who assert merely illusion—various divisions beyond measure.
[3056] This is called the autonomous lower.
[3057] Second: In ultimate truth, not even illusion abides.
[3058] Since there are no objects or aspects, even the self-aware experience does not exist.
[3059] Like a barren woman's son, there is no meeting consciousness.
[3060] Since conventional truth is not true, ultimate truth is non-abiding.
[3061] When awakening from a dream, the appearance of horse and ox stops.
