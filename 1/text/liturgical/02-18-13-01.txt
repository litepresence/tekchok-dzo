[5269] <ornament>First, regarding "Awareness Measure-Arrived":</ornament>
[5270] <prose>"Awareness" means the basis-abiding awareness manifestly becomes,
Having entered the path-door.</prose>
[5271] <prose>The basis-vision's self-resonance spontaneously-accomplished dawn-door,</prose>
[5272] <prose>Through body-form-vision, the path-vision approaches exhaustion,</prose>
[5273] <prose>Mandalas completing.</prose>
[5274] <prose>"Measure" is from first half-body to body mandala complete.</prose>
[5275] <prose>"Arrived" means there is no place beyond that—complete manifestation.</prose>
[5276] <prose>These are like the form of the full moon,</prose>
[5277] <prose>The mandala complete through waxing and waning,
Without fabrication upon self-essence.</prose> || 10 ||
[5278] <ornament>Second, explanation of three measures in particular has three parts:</ornament>
[5279] <list>Outer visions,</list>
[5280] <list>Inner body measure,</list>
[5281] <list>Secret awareness measure.</list>
[5282] <ornament>First:</ornament>
[5283] <prose>Controlling visions, completing lands in luminous clarity.</prose>
[5284] <tantra>From the Thal 'gyur:</tantra>
[5285] <verse>The measure of completion having thus arrived—</verse>
[5286] <verse>Direct objective visions cease,</verse>
[5287] <verse>The vision of earth and stones melts away,</verse>
[5288] <verse>Self-knowing enters into everything,</verse>
[5289] <verse>Inert things move when directed,</verse>
[5290] <verse>The measure of wind's movement is grasped,</verse>
[5291] <verse>The body's dust-particles become visible.</verse>
[5292] <verse>Whatever appears becomes complete as form-kayas,</verse>
[5293] <verse>From that fathers and mothers embrace,</verse>
[5294] <verse>The five and five fathers and mothers unite,</verse>
[5295] <verse>All within the round periphery—</verse>
[5296] <verse>The yogin's body also luminous,</verse>
[5297] <verse>Appearing to go, come, and sit.</verse>
[5298] <verse>All is awareness arriving at its measure.</verse>
[5299] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5300] <ornament>Second:</ornament>
[5301] <prose>Purifying the dust of the body, from the heart center, white <mantra>A</mantra>,
Five light-rays coil like the sun's reflection in the heart-window,
Piercing into the star-window of light within intermediate space.</prose>
[5302] <prose>Rising through the crown-uspa, wisdom wind abides,
Appearing naturally uplifted.</prose>
[5303] <prose>From the urna, five light-rays, one fathom, shine clearly.</prose>
[5304] <prose>Upon the five fingers of the hand, five lights garland and coil.</prose>
[5305] <prose>Through the doors of the body's pores and so forth,
Outer and inner parts smaller than dust-particles' scope,
Each containing numberless lands, measureless Buddhas and beings appear—
These are all visions of the spontaneously-accomplished eight doors dawning here,
Appearing to self-vision without excess or lack.</prose> || 30 ||
[5306] <prose>In the crown-palate, the wrathful mandala; in the heart, the peaceful mandala.</prose>
[5307] <prose>In all parts of the body, natural emanations,</prose>
[5308] <prose>Emanations taming beings,</prose>
[5309] <prose>Various emanations appear,
Doing the benefit of self-vision beings in Buddha-fields.</prose>
[5310] <prose>Through the door of compassion, the six clairvoyances and</prose>
[5311] <prose>The wisdom knowing all dharmas dawn.</prose>
[5312] <prose>Through the door of pure wisdom,
The pure Buddha-fields complete as self-vision Sambhogakaya.</prose>
[5313] <prose>The mind's defilements purified,
Obtaining separation from dust and doubt,</prose>
[5314] <prose>The latencies of ground and grounds self-purify.</prose>
[5315] <tantra>From the Thal 'gyur:</tantra>
[5316] <verse>The body arriving at measure also becomes thus:</verse>
[5317] <verse>Free from the dust of individual bodies,</verse>
[5318] <verse>The star-window of light in intermediate space appears.</verse>
[5319] <verse>Then light-rays in the shape of hooks,</verse>
[5320] <verse>Subtle and coiling, hold the vision.</verse>
[5321] <verse>The body's dust naturally ceasing,</verse>
[5322] <verse>The copper-shining stainless light-body.</verse>
[5323] <verse>The <mantra>A</mantra> mark in the center,</verse>
[5324] <verse>And the urna's light-ray, one fathom measure.</verse>
[5325] <verse>The crown-uspa lifted by wind, appearing.</verse>
[5326] <verse>From the peaceful body's fingers,</verse>
[5327] <verse>Light-garlands coil in form.</verse>
[5328] <verse>Activity of silent mind,</verse>
[5329] <verse>From the skull palace of the head,</verse>
[5330] <verse>Herukas manifestly arise.</verse>
[5331] <verse>At this time, the self-body arrives at measure—</verse>
[5332] <verse>The copper-shining three kayas coil as one.</verse>
[5333] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5334] <ornament>Third, the secret awareness measure:</ornament>
[5335] <prose>Although the subtle and coarse moving mind is purified,</prose>
[5336] <prose>There exists merely the all-ground consciousness mind,</prose>
[5337] <prose>Dawn of awareness qualities, clairvoyance and unobstructed eye.</prose>
[5338] <tantra>From that itself:</tantra>
[5339] <verse>At this time the mind is clear,</verse>
[5340] <verse>Together with the six clairvoyances,</verse>
[5341] <verse>Far and concealed</verse>
[5342] <verse>Dharmas become known in a moment.</verse>
[5343] <verse>Measureless Buddha-realms and</verse>
[5344] <verse>Likewise kayas appear to mind.</verse>
[5345] <verse>Defilements exhaust in empty mind,</verse>
[5346] <verse>Nature unmoving obtains empty-luminosity.</verse>
[5347] <verse>Unmixed equal-complete pervades the expanse,</verse>
[5348] <verse>Through manifest clarity, not separate from the many.</verse>
[5349] <verse>Without parts, without elaboration.</verse>
[5350] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5351] <prose>That also: in the two upper visions,
Purifying the manifest defilements of affliction-mind and mind-consciousness,</prose>
[5352] <prose>At the time of obtaining this,
Through the purity of the first seven of the eight collections,</prose>
[5353] <prose>Free from subtle and coarse defilements,</prose>
[5354] <prose>Body-mind connection cut,</prose>
[5355] <prose>Outer visions' objects appear to awareness.</prose>
[5356] <prose>The investigating agent consciousness part,
Acting as self-condition through the power of all-ground consciousness,</prose>
[5357] <prose>Like a shooting star moving in the sky,
The momentary investigating agent self-dawning, self-freeing,
Pure without looking to separate antidotes.</prose>
[5358] <prose>At the time of the two upper visions,
Wind is thrown outward and not held inward,</prose>
[5359] <prose>Arising through the ability to purify conceptuality not abiding in two moments,</prose>
[5360] <prose>The body copper-shining,</prose>
[5361] <prose>The all-ground consciousness part clear-vivid
Like fire-sparks of concept-free object-awareness emitting.</prose>
[5362] <prose>Seeing the two aspects of outer extending vision and inner self-vision,
Body and mind separate and cut,</prose>
[5363] <prose>Accomplishing the great mandala,
The supreme ground of not returning outward to the three realms.</prose>
[5364] <tantra>Again from the Thal 'gyur:</tantra>
[5365] <verse>At all times of such vision,</verse>
[5366] <verse>The cutting of body-mind connection,</verse>
[5367] <verse>From the contaminated exhausted body also,</verse>
[5368] <verse>The mind with clear characteristics arising outward,</verse>
[5369] <verse>Like a shooting star emitting,</verse>
[5370] <verse>Clearly seen in the realm of space.</verse>
[5371] <verse>At the first times of that itself,</verse>
[5372] <verse>From separation from wind also,</verse>
[5373] <verse>Through the action of pure wind, effortful,</verse>
[5374] <verse>Arising from throwing outward from the body.</verse>
[5375] <verse>From the part of the two see-agents also,</verse>
[5376] <verse>The body luminous and pure,</verse>
[5377] <verse>The mind like fire-sparks emitting,</verse>
[5378] <verse>Not abiding as one, self-clear basis,</verse>
[5379] <verse>Arising in the manner of two vision aspects.</verse>
[5380] <verse>Through this, having cut body-mind connection,</verse>
[5381] <verse>There is no returning to the three realms.</verse>
[5382] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5383] <prose>At this time, the see-agent also,
Like a shooting star or fire-sparks, the all-ground consciousness part,</prose>
[5384] <prose>Together with the compassion-wisdom part of awareness,</prose>
[5385] <prose>Arise as the wisdom part seeing the two outer and inner objects.</prose>
[5386] <prose>At this time there is no intentionally setting gaze manner etc. through antidote,</prose>
[5387] <prose>For one never passes beyond the wheel of dharmata.</prose>
[5388] <prose>This is called "completion of practice measure."</prose>
[5389] <ornament>Fourth, the dharmata-exhausting vision has two parts:</ornament>
[5390] <list>Brief showing of exhaustion manner, and</list>
[5391] <list>Extensive explanation of nature.</list>
[5392] <ornament>First:</ornament>
[5393] <prose>From the vision like the full moon of previous measure-arrival,</prose>
[5394] <prose>The manner of self-resonance dissolving into the expanse,</prose>
[5395] <prose>Like the moon waning from that,</prose>
[5396] <prose>Again that body fading until reaching the bindu,
Certain vision to the first mind.</prose>
[5397] <prose>That applies in sequence to the manner of purifying the four visions
Through the fourfold sequence of container-contents'
Arising, abiding, destruction, and emptiness.</prose>
[5398] <prose>Similar to the increase and decrease of the four—
Birth, aging, sickness, and death—</prose>
[5399] <prose>The outer container's arising manner dissolves, and</prose>
[5400] <prose>The inner contents' beings' life measure rising and</prose>
[5401] <prose>Waning downward—the sign of exhaustion.</prose>
[5402] <prose>If these do not exhaust, the self is not free from the three realms.</prose>
[5403] <prose>Thus, through the exhaustion of the outer container world,</prose>
[5404] <prose>Support-ground not existing,</prose>
[5405] <prose>The vital point of no ground of return.</prose>
[5406] <prose>Through the exhaustion of inner contents' beings, the birth continuum cut,</prose>
[5407] <prose>Now awareness itself is separate from death.</prose>
[5408] <prose>Then, whatever essence vision may have, there is no establishment,</prose>
[5409] <prose>Difficult to express as "this is" or "this is not,"</prose>
[5410] <prose>Therefore called "dharmata exhaustion"—the meaningful result.</prose>
[5411] <prose>The result: difficult for a person to express "this is" or "this is not,"
For it is inconceivable.</prose>
[5412] <prose>Moreover, dharma exhaustion:
At the time of measure-arrival, the dharmas of outer objects, inner body,
Together with dust, exhausted—here, the dharmas included by the all-ground consciousness mind exhausted,</prose>
[5413] <prose>And purifying the root non-awareness
That abides as the dharmata of the three doors of the all-ground part.</prose>
[5414] <prose>Depending upon the dharmas of delusion,</prose>
[5415] <prose>That luminosity of vision without arising or destruction,
Abiding as ultimate dharmata,</prose>
[5416] <prose>Through the exhaustion of those two dharmatas,
Is called "dharmata exhaustion."</prose>
[5417] <prose>Vision: when that previous spontaneously-accomplished vision, existing,
Dissolves inward, part by part going,</prose>
[5418] <prose>The primordially-pure vision, like a cloudless sky,
Momentarily abiding naturally pure, is called "vision"—</prose>
[5419] <prose>Not like vision as entity and characteristic.</prose>
[5420] <prose>At this time, there is no reference even to mere dharmas—dharmata exhaustion.</prose>
[5421] <prose>The dharma-possessor object and</prose>
[5422] <prose>The dharmata's emptiness, the holding part,
Included by the object-possessor,</prose>
[5423] <prose>The time of return of the three realms' mind, mental-events, together with all-ground.</prose>
[5424] <ornament>The manner of exhaustion:</ornament>
[5425] <list>Gradual and</list>
[5426] <list>Instantaneous, from the two.</list>
[5427] <prose>Gradual exhaustion is at the time of the four visions arriving at measure.</prose>
[5428] <prose>Instantaneous exhaustion is through habituating having seen dharmata manifestly at first.</prose>
[5429] <prose>There is also exhaustion without the arising of visions of increasing experience and so forth—</prose>
[5430] <prose>This is called "supreme instantaneous mind."</prose>
[5431] <prose>Moreover, merely through each act of respect for the guru,
Greater than others, possessed of the potential of previously purified action—
Such an exhaustion manner merely exists.</prose>
[5432] <ornament>Second, the extensive explanation of nature has five parts:</ornament>
[5433] <list>Essence,</list>
[5434] <list>Definition,</list>
[5435] <list>Nature,</list>
[5436] <list>Dharmata,</list>
[5437] <list>Boundary.</list>
[5438] <ornament>The essence of dharmata exhaustion:</ornament>
[5439] <prose>Outer lights-five vision, together with kayas, exhausted;</prose>
[5440] <prose>Inner dust, together with concepts and aggregates, exhausted;</prose>
[5441] <prose>Experience vision objects exhausted,</prose>
[5442] <prose>Awareness abiding in a manner like the sky, the primordially-pure vision.</prose>
[5443] <tantra>From the Thal 'gyur:</tantra>
[5444] <verse>The vision of dharmata exhaustion—</verse>
[5445] <verse>Experience vision emptying,</verse>
[5446] <verse>Body exhausted, sense objects also exhausted,</verse>
[5447] <verse>Free from concepts, aggregates, and delusion,</verse>
[5448] <verse>Separate from words of expressive basis.</verse>
[5449] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5450] <ornament>Definition:</ornament>
[5451] <prose>"Dharma" means the dharmas of body, speech, and mind aggregates,
Together with afflictions.</prose>
[5452] <prose>"Itself" is together with the part of meditating
the luminosity vision of the purifying path.</prose>
[5453] <prose>"Exhaust" is "empty,"</prose>
[5454] <prose>Mind's meditation, together with object-vision, self-reversing, not existing—</prose>
[5455] <prose>Called "non-observation."</prose>
[5456] <tantra>From that itself:</tantra>
[5457] <verse>Thus the certain definition of dharmata—</verse>
[5458] <verse>To the gathering of dharma-knowing aggregates,</verse>
[5459] <verse>Doing actions and holding characteristics,</verse>
[5460] <verse>Making self-vision empty,</verse>
[5461] <verse>Holding individual families.</verse>
[5462] <verse>"Itself" is to the unfabricated,</verse>
[5463] <verse>Pervading the real through natural abiding,</verse>
[5464] <verse>To the unfabricated, original, continuous,</verse>
[5465] <verse>Exhausting the numbers of sounds, words, and names.</verse>
[5466] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5467] <ornament>Nature:</ornament>
[5468] <prose>Outer and inner vision-mind exhausted,
Activity merely upon primordially-pure self-resonance
Like the resonance of blue-grey sky.</prose>
[5469] <tantra>From the Rtsal rdzogs:</tantra>
[5470] <verse>At this time, the characteristic of exhaustion—</verse>
[5471] <verse>Like the sky, free from action.</verse>
[5472] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5473] <ornament>Dharmata has two parts:</ornament>
[5474] <list>The dharmata of vision:</list>
[5475] <prose>Through the exhaustion of outer and inner dust, channels and winds exhaust.</prose>
[5476] <prose>Through that exhaustion, the subtle defilements, the seed-parts of latencies
Depending upon mind, with the characteristic of arising from all, also exhaust.</prose>
[5477] <prose>Abiding in the samadhi of continuity, not passing beyond the wheel of dharmata,</prose>
[5478] <prose>Controlling the great eye and clairvoyance,
Obtaining the power as regent of the dharma king of the three realms.</prose>
[5479] <prose>The all-ground subtle knowable obscurations very cut—
Except for being cut by merely a white silk curtain, there are no obscurations.</prose>
[5480] <prose>This is called "the result of path dharmas exhaustion."</prose>
[5481] <prose>Having cleared that, separation from all Buddha-obscurations,
Entering the primordially-pure dharmakaya of the inner expanse, the very peace.</prose>
[5482] <tantra>From the Thal 'gyur:</tantra>
[5483] <verse>The dharmata of self-Buddha cessation:</verse>
[5484] <verse>Elements ceasing, dust ceases,</verse>
[5485] <verse>Dust and particles ultimately cease,</verse>
[5486] <verse>Not even a mere part abides.</verse>
[5487] <verse>Afflictions ceasing, delusion and</verse>
[5488] <verse>Concept-free attachment not abiding,</verse>
[5489] <verse>Latencies and all-arising</verse>
[5490] <verse>Not even dust-parts abide.</verse>
[5491] <verse>Thus through subtle and coarse cessation,</verse>
[5492] <verse>The five aggregates also gradually subtle at the end,</verse>
[5493] <verse>The body of four elements exhausted,</verse>
[5494] <verse>All is wisdom, Sambhogakaya.</verse>
[5495] <verse>Concept-free samadhi self-abiding,</verse>
[5496] <verse>Having exceeded the aggregates of fabrication,</verse>
[5497] <verse>"Dharma" does not abide in words.</verse>
[5498] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5499] <list>The empty dharmata:</list>
[5500] <prose>Through the exhaustion of coarse channels and winds,
Mind and mental-events exhaust.</prose>
[5501] <prose>The vision aspect of kaya and wisdom, like the measure-arrived full moon,
Also setting into the inner expanse, abiding in primordially-pure vision,</prose>
[5502] <prose>This is expressed as "the dharmakaya vision,
The core result dharmata, self-vision."</prose>
[5503] <tantra>Again from the previous:</tantra>
[5504] <verse>The dharmata of cause and result:</verse>
[5505] <verse>Coarse conceptuality source ceasing,</verse>
[5506] <verse>Memory self-pure from the continuum also,</verse>
[5507] <verse>Dependent-arising wind itself fully pure,</verse>
[5508] <verse>The dharmata arising from cause.</verse>
[5509] <verse>To the primordially-pure nature,</verse>
[5510] <verse>The numbers of one and many exhaust,</verse>
[5511] <verse>Kaya and wisdom non-existent,</verse>
[5512] <verse>Arriving at the ground of exhausted dharmas—</verse>
[5513] <verse>Considered to be the result dharmata.</verse>
[5514] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[5515] <prose>Moreover, delusion regarding these three later words.</prose>
[5516] <prose>Nyingtigpas who think that in the result primordially-pure
There is no kaya and wisdom having arisen—</prose>
[5517] <prose>That is a great error.</prose>
[5518] <prose>They have not understood the intention of that being said
Regarding the part like the resonance kaya and wisdom of outer vision,
Crystal light returning inward.</prose>
[5519] <prose>If in meaning there is nothing in the inner expanse,
It contradicts spontaneous accomplishment;</prose>
[5520] <prose>Being unconditioned, it contradicts going to complete non-existence in the future;</prose>
[5521] <prose>It contradicts the arising of benefit for beings
From the basis of dawn of kaya and wisdom from the expanse;</prose>
[5522] <prose>It contradicts Samantabhadra, having arrived at the end of pure basis expanse,
Showing the compassion and action of showing the path to beings and Buddhas—
Such faults exist in great number.</prose>
[5523] <prose>Such faults are not suitable to accept.</prose>
[5524] <ornament>Fifth, the boundary:</ornament>
[5525] <prose>At the time of beginning exhaustion from the measure-arrived curtain,
There merely exists the clarity of five lights in the fingers of one's own four hands and feet,</prose>
[5526] <prose>The occasion from which there is outward entry into the inner expanse and</prose>
[5527] <prose>The boundary of inward return to outer vision.</prose>
[5528] <prose>Moreover, although that kaya form does not actually arise extensively
As benefit for beings at this time,</prose>
[5529] <prose>Focusing awareness upon the light of the fingers,</prose>
[5530] <prose>Outer visions and</prose>
[5531] <prose>The luminosity of one's own body increasingly dissolve and go into the inner expanse,</prose>
[5532] <prose>From merely the pure blue of direct objective vision,</prose>
[5533] <prose>Like light-body fading and crystal light dissolving inward,</prose>
[5534] <prose>The self-resonance of body and vision also reverses,</prose>
[5535] <prose>Awareness abiding merely upon the depth resonance of kaya and wisdom
Within the shell of inner clear spontaneously-accomplished jewel,</prose>
[5536] <prose>Like a shadow abiding in the self-lucidity of a crystal mirror,
Without even a mere part of vision in the blue of outer vision,</prose>
[5537] <prose>Awareness buddha-fied into dharmakaya, coiled.</prose>
[5538] <prose>If returning inward to outer vision,
The sign that that kaya does not accomplish the equal of Buddha action,</prose>
[5539] <prose>Moreover, through control of birth and entry,
Awareness focusing compassion upon beings,
That primordially-pure vision without anything, self-reversing.</prose>
[5540] <prose>This vision of delusion-vision appears like a mirror's reflection,</prose>
[5541] <prose>And that self-kaya also, like the moon in water,
Self-appears as wisdom illusory body through copper-shining,
Free from elemental harm, obtaining the vajra kaya—</prose>
[5542] <prose>Called "arising as the great transfer kaya for the benefit of beings."</prose>
[5543] <prose>Others' impure eyes see merely dust together, not the copper-shining—</prose>
[5544] <prose>Like the great master Vimala and</prose>
[5545] <prose>Padma.</prose>
[5546] <prose>Then, having obtained control over birth and entry,</prose>
[5547] <prose>Although buddha-fied in a moment, there is delay,</prose>
[5548] <prose>Yet doing the benefit of beings until samsara is not empty, possessing self-power.</prose>
[5549] <ornament>Control over birth:</ornament>
[5550] <prose>At the occasion of entering the inner expanse,
Entering awareness into three thousand beings,
Obtaining the great power to free all simultaneously,</prose>
[5551] <prose>Even insects cease into light.</prose>
[5552] <prose>Having obtained control over birth,
Emanating whatever is desired, spontaneously accomplishing the benefit of beings.</prose>
[5553] <ornament>Control over entry:</ornament>
[5554] <prose>Although entering awareness into inert things, making them move and emit sound,</prose>
[5555] <prose>Through the dharma sound arising from lotus, wishing tree, jewel, and so forth,
Ripening all beings,</prose>
[5556] <prose>Making rain of food and clothes.</prose>
[5557] <prose>Moreover, having obtained these two controls over birth and entry
Following exhaustion at the occasion not-there of entering the inner expanse,</prose>
[5558] <prose>If not returning inward for beings' benefit,
Having made three thousand beings in the bardo free instantaneously,
Entering the expanse;</prose>
[5559] <prose>If doing, through control over birth, returning inward,
Gradually making three thousand free,</prose>
[5560] <prose>Doing whatever benefit for beings through many births and entries
For kalpas numbering the dust of fields.</prose>
[5561] <prose>Through earth treasures,</prose>
[5562] <prose>Jewels,</prose>
[5563] <prose>Dharma classifications, and so forth—
Although benefit may be accomplished after a long time,
There is not even a moment's passing in that means,</prose>
[5564] <prose>For compassion wonder arises from others and activity vision enters.</prose>
[5565] <prose>Those relying upon our holy gurus Vimala and Padmakara,
Such very sublime ones, are certain to be liberated without doubt
In this life or the bardo.</prose>
[5566] <tantra>This manner from the Guhyasamaja Seed Tantra:</tantra>
[5567] <verse>When arriving at the ground of inner body exhaustion,</verse>
[5568] <verse>Fingers and so forth appear thus.</verse>
[5569] <verse>Focusing this, elements naturally cease.</verse>
[5570] <verse>Through the difference of birth and entry,</verse>
[5571] <verse>Upon the self-ground of all dharmas exhausted,</verse>
[5572] <verse>Without holding anything whatsoever,</verse>
[5573] <verse>One abides—this is the emanation kaya.</verse>
