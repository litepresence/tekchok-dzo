[11761] <prose> The Grounds of Power and Spontaneity
[11762] <tantra> Four there are: the ground of power over life, the ground of the Great Seal, and the ground of spontaneous accomplishment. Yet these persons do not swiftly attain the fruit; having first obtained their respective grounds, they must remain for long periods training to bring them to perfection, as proclaimed in the Blazing Reliquary Tantra:
[11763] <prose> When earth trembles at the time
[11764] <prose> A being separates from breath,
[11765] <prose> This one obtains the sravaka ground. || 30 ||
[11766] <prose> Likewise, should it tremble in three days,
[11767] <prose> The self-same ground gives rise to motion—
[11768] <prose> This is the pratyekabuddha's ground.
[11769] <prose> When in six days it comes to be,
[11770] <prose> This is the bodhisattva's ground,
[11771] <prose> Entering therein, O dakini.
[11772] <prose> If in nine days it should come
[11773] <prose> That earth does tremble and transform,
[11774] <prose> This one has power to freely roam
[11775] <prose> The ground of the vidya-dhara. || 40 ||
[11776] <prose> Yet buddhahood's fruit does not appear
[11777] <prose> To one endowed with trembling grounds;
[11778] <prose> Thus in grounds and paths alike
[11779] <prose> Long cultivation must one dwell.
[11780] <prose> Those of scant learning nowadays, failing to understand that the vehicles' entry-paths are distinct, apply all grounds of the causal vehicle's path and stages only to the nature of causes. This resembles calculating for all travelers the days required to reach Lhasa based only on the days needed by burden-bearers—yet not all can be indicated thus. Just as horsemen, swift-footed ones, birds, and others cover in a few days what takes the heavily-burdened long periods, so too slower ones take more time—these are not certain.
[11781] <prose> Likewise, the methods and wisdom-activities of each path should be understood by the wise and discerning.
[11782] <prose> The second topic concerns the signs of birth-taking by the six realms' confusion. This has two aspects: the general arrangement and the presentation of actual signs.
[11783] <ornament> First: For all sentient beings there are two paths to go, two results—making four in all. Without the intermediate state of dharmata and the intermediate state of existence, no path is possible. Without the two—the buddha-return and the being-return—there is no destination.

[11786] <prose> 
[11787] <prose> 
[11788] <prose> 
[11789] <prose> 
[11790] <prose> 
[11791] <prose> 
[11792] <prose> 
[11793] <prose> 
[11794] <prose> 
[11795] <prose> || 60 ||
[11796] <prose> 
[11797] <prose> 
[11798] <prose> 
[11799] <prose> 
[11800] <prose> 
[11801] <prose> 
[11802] <prose> 
[11803] <prose> To proceed toward buddhahood, there are five paths: the path of accumulation, the path of application, the path of seeing, the path of meditation, and the path of completion.
[11804] <prose> The path of confusion leading to birth as a sentient being also has five continua: the path of dreams, the path of latent tendencies, the path of the limits of karma, the path of the uncertain confusion-mandala, and the path where cause and result are each uncertain.
[11805] <ornament> Regarding results, the distinctive buddha-fruits are twofold: the fruit of buddhahood just-as-it-is, and the fruit of buddhahood with manifest realization. || 70 ||
[11806] <prose> The results of birth as a sentient being are six: hell, hungry ghost, animal, human, god, and asura—beyond these, no destination exists.
[11807] <ornament> Second, regarding actual signs, from among six:
[11808] <prose> First, the sign of birth in hell: at the time of death, the sky gathers with black clouds, and one proceeds as if darkness were kindled. When rain, steam, great wind, hail, and dust-whirlwinds swirl, one takes birth among the eight hot hells, the eight cold hells, the intermittent hells, the neighboring hells, the unbearable birth-being hell, and the seven vajra hells.
[11809] <prose> The latter two, although included in the category of the eight hot hells, are distinguished separately due to their long lifespans and great suffering.
[11810] <prose> Moreover, by the karma of immediate actions and so forth, all who take birth in the last of the hot hells dwell for one intermediate kalpa, while those who have abandoned the Dharma remain billions of hundreds of thousands of kalpas longer—hence it is called the Unbearable Birth-Being Hell. As proclaimed in the Noble Sutra of the Transcendence of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines:
[11811] <prose> Through the ripening of the karma of abandoning Dharma,
[11812] <prose> One takes birth in the great unbearable birth-being hell,
[11813] <prose> Experiencing unbearable suffering.
[11814] <prose> Even when the great fire-gathering kalpa arises there,
[11815] <prose> One takes birth where the great birth-being hell exists || 80 ||
[11816] <prose> In the eastern worlds—thus it is proclaimed
[11817] <prose> To extend throughout the ten directions, limitless and boundless.
[11818] <prose>
