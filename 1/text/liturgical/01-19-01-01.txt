<tantra> [6414] From that, between-between, other aeons numberless-transcended arisen,
<tantra> [6415] Explained here as those arisen of clear light essence;
<tantra> [6416] That also, from primordial time until arriving at this field's sequence,
<tantra> [6417] First, the primordial first teaching arose,
<tantra> [6418] Ripened numberless beings by the secret heart-essence.
<tantra> [6419] Then, at the second teaching, the Buddha Śikhin, protector of the world,
<list> [6420] At the third, the thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector, and
<list> [6421] At the fourth, the thousand suns' king, and
<list> [6422] At the fifth, the web-protector Buddha, and
<list> [6423] At the sixth, the thousand light-rays' rim-protector, and
<list> [6424] At the seventh, the saṃsāra-destroyer king, and
[6425] Then, in the aeons of the intervals of sixty-four hundred-thousand, holding this secret heart-essence, acting for the benefit of beings,
[6426] Until the great aeon of strife-possessing, arranged by Vajradhara of the great Brahma.
[6427] The sequence of these extensively:
[6428] Arises from the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra—
[6429] Each aeon,
[6430] Each enumeration of Buddha,
[6431] Each manner of liberation of gathered retinue, and the first:
[6432] From the primordial first Buddha,
[6433] Until the aeon of strife-possessing, actually taught sixty-six within the category of the inexpressible—
[6434] The teaching of all, the number of sixty-four hundred-thousand.
[6435] The primordial first Buddha:
<tantra> [6436] "First, the superior Smṛti-protector,
<tantra> [6437] Mudrā of self-remembering wheel,
<tantra> [6438] The word distinguishing superior from base,
<tantra> [6439] Śikhin, arisen at the previous beginning.
<tantra> [6440] By seventy myriads of this time,
<tantra> [6441] This mudrā is supreme."
<tantra> [6442] To:
<tantra> [6443] "The wisdom-protector of exhausted mindfulness,
<tantra> [6444] The essence, self-word, secret understood,
<tantra> [6445] To the aeon of strife-possessing,
<tantra> [6446] By the nineteen lineage-holders,
<tantra> [6447] The definitive mudrā supreme held."
<tantra> [6448] Thus inexpressible,
<tantra> [6449] From the blessings of the Buddhas,
<tantra> [6450] In the self-arisen great letter,
<tantra> [6451] Of the great primordially pure abiding,
<tantra> [6452] From the descent, all this self-arisen arose;
<tantra> [6453] All this sequence of blessing also,
<tantra> [6454] Self-shown from the first descent.
<tantra> [6455] Thus to:
[6456] "Inexpressible" means other aeons and the sequence of Buddhas of the interval aeons condensed.
[6457] Those also, from the Great Arrangement:
<tantra> [6458] "The primordial first Buddha,
<tantra> [6459] The supreme thousand Maṇḍala gathered.
<tantra> [6460] Then at the second teaching,
<tantra> [6461] Called Śikhin, protector of the world,
<tantra> [6462] By the supreme thousand, this mudrā.
<tantra> [6463] At the third teaching,
<tantra> [6464] The thousand Brahmas' Yama-world-protector,
<tantra> [6465] The thousand Buddhas' very heart essence rolled.
<tantra> [6466] Then at the fourth teaching,
<tantra> [6467] The thousand suns' king, and
<tantra> [6468] By the thousand Buddhas, dominion conquered.
<tantra> [6469] At the fifth teaching,
<tantra> [6470] Called Jvalamukha, protector of the world,
<tantra> [6471] In the heart of the supreme thousand, concealed.
<tantra> [6472] At the sixth teaching,
<tantra> [6473] The thousand light-rays' rim-protector,
<tantra> [6474] By the thousand families, this very concealed.
<tantra> [6475] Then at the seventh teaching,
<tantra> [6476] The all-pervading saṃsāra-destroyer, Brahma-protector,
<tantra> [6477] By the thousand great bliss, crown held.
<tantra> [6478] Thus, thus is the teaching:
<tantra> [6479] To sixty-four hundred-thousand,
<tantra> [6480] By that many number of Buddhas,
<tantra> [6481] This great secret fully held.
<tantra> [6482] The definitive Buddhas of the teaching:
<tantra> [6483] By nineteen hundred-thousand,
<tantra> [6484] This very mudrā, essence rolled.
<tantra> [6485] Thus it is spoken.
[6486] That also, sixty-four hundred-thousand aeons,
[6487] Is the aeon of the great Brahma.
[6488] From the arrangement of sixty-four hundred-thousand great emanations of that first protector himself,
[6489] Emanating as Buddhas, nineteen hundred-thousand to the perception of disciples, acting for benefit:
[6490] The arrangement of great Brahma in the abode of king supreme Samantabhadra,
[6491] The teaching showing the deed in the sky of the abode of one Kaustubha jewel, the thirteenth within the center of lotus petals on the palm of Vairocana's hand.
[6492] And in all the abodes of that kāya,
[6493] The teaching showing the deed in fields existing in other abodes of the five families transcends thought—
[6494] The Buddha's deed,
[6495] Qualities and activities,
[6496] Called "Three Kayas equal to the sky"—
[6497] Tenth-ground Bodhisattvas cannot measure;
[6498] How can worldly, seeing mind measure?
<tantra> [6499] From the Uttaratantra:
<tantra> [6500] "Buddha-element and Buddha-awakening,
<tantra> [6501] Buddha qualities and Buddha activities,
<tantra> [6502] Even for pure beings, inconceivable."
<tantra> [6503] Thus it is spoken.
<tantra> [6504] From the Ratnaketu:
<tantra> [6505] "As much as the sky is pervaded,
<tantra> [6506] The kāya also pervades that much.
<tantra> [6507] As much as the kāya is pervaded,
<tantra> [6508] Light also pervades that much.
<tantra> [6509] As much as light is pervaded,
<tantra> [6510] Speech also pervades that much."
<tantra> [6511] Thus it was spoken.
<ornament> [6512] Second, showing the enumeration of obtained liberation:
[6513] In this Jambudvīpa, by this great secret definitive teaching,
[6514] Although hundred-thousand non-human Ḍākinīs beyond number are liberated,
[6515] Here on this occasion, the definite enumeration of liberation in this life and the intermediate state by the enumeration of men, women,
[6516] Fully ordained,
[6517] Boys and girls is:
<tantra> [6518] From the Great Arrangement:
<tantra> [6519] "Listen, fortunate monk Pal:
<tantra> [6520] I, from not abiding here,
<tantra> [6521] Until sixty years of life,
<tantra> [6522] One thousand results of liberation
<tantra> [6523] Arising as self-release:
<tantra> [6524] Monk form, half of that;
<tantra> [6525] Remainder, Bodhisattvas.
<tantra> [6526] Then until fifty,
<tantra> [6527] Arising, returning to self-place,
<tantra> [6528] By two hundred-thousand, obtain birthless.
<tantra> [6529] Mostly females' form,
<tantra> [6530] Males, two thousand.
<tantra> [6531] Then, in the interval of thirty years of life,
<tantra> [6532] Six hundred-thousand,
<tantra> [6533] These mostly males,
<tantra> [6534] By one hundred-thousand females.
<tantra> [6535] Arising, self-release.
<tantra> [6536] Those, my former retinue,
<tantra> [6537] In degenerate time, obtained Buddhahood.
<tantra> [6538] The definite secret essence even gathered,
<tantra> [6539] From obtaining the result itself,
<tantra> [6540] Not the result of other teaching.
<tantra> [6541] If to other teaching,
<tantra> [6542] Manifest Buddhas arise,
<tantra> [6543] This meets, thus it is.
<tantra> [6544] In the heart of all results,
<tantra> [6545] This is the definite teaching."
<tantra> [6546] Thus it is spoken.
[6547] Shown is the number of self-pure arising in this life.
[6548] All who have obtained Buddhahood, wherever from, have become Buddha from the abode of this great secret,
[6549] Having seen the direct dharmatā of awareness-manifest, becoming Buddha—
[6550] For that is not surpassed by others.
[6551] That also, by the power of having gathered accumulations over many former aeons,
[6552] First meeting with this teaching,
[6553] Called the heart of the result for becoming Buddha without taking long;
[6554] All meeting with this teaching quickly obtain Buddhahood,
[6555] For they meet the heart of the result.
[6556] O fortunate master-disciple, possessor of Dharma,
[6557] In this life, or
[6558] In the bardo, or
[6559] In whichever field of natural emanation-kāya, definitely accomplish Buddhahood quickly,
[6560] For the cause, the power of definite Buddhahood-accomplishment without obstruction, meeting the pure teaching's heart of result, and by faith conducting in that.
[6561] O fortunate master-disciple, possessor of Dharma,
[6562] Formerly worshipped countless Buddhas and gathered in the retinue of Samantabhadra,
[6563] For conducting in the unsurpassed secret vehicle again.
[6564] If even merely meeting the common vehicle definitely has former merit-roots such as worshipping Buddhas,
[6565] Meeting such uncommon teaching has special former accumulations, and it pervades that well-practiced before.
<tantra> [6566] Also from the Abhisamayālaṃkāra:
<tantra> [6567] "Having specially served the Buddhas,
<tantra> [6568] Planted merit-roots toward that,
<tantra> [6569] Protected by spiritual friends,
<tantra> [6570] Are vessels for hearing this."
<tantra> [6571] Thus it was spoken.
[6572] The enumeration of liberation in the bardo:
[6573] Also from the former:
<tantra> [6574] "Between the two births, manifestly Buddha,
<tantra> [6575] In the interval of ten years of life, these:
<tantra> [6576] Seven thousand meet the mother of appearances;
<tantra> [6577] Males, indeed six thousand;
<tantra> [6578] Female form, one thousand.
<tantra> [6579] Thus males and females, boys and girls,
<tantra> [6580] Whatever form they dwell in, easy—all who meet this are completely liberated."
<tantra> [6581] Thus it is spoken.
[6582] That also, having entered this definite secret supreme and obtained guidance and instructions,
[6583] Although the meaning is not obtained,
[6584] Those males, females, and children, by the benefit of hearing, definitely liberate quickly,
[6585] For they meet the unsurpassed heart of the result.
<ornament> [6586] Third, expressing the definite prophecy of vidyādhara:
<tantra> [6587] From the Thalgyur:
<tantra> [6588] "I, after parinirvāṇa,
<tantra> [6589] In the land of Uḍḍiyana of the west,
<tantra> [6590] To the goddess of Dhana Kośa,
<tantra> [6591] The fatherless son, Vajra-He,
<tantra> [6592] By this one, the supreme teaching is held.
<tantra> [6593] That successor, in the western direction,
<tantra> [6594] A brahmin child, fortunate,
<tantra> [6595] Called Mañjuśrīpati,
<tantra> [6596] Holds for seventy-five years.
<tantra> [6597] That successor, fortunate,
<tantra> [6598] In the place called Sośa Island,
<tantra> [6599] Householder-born Śrī Siṃha,
<tantra> [6600] By that one, will hold.
<tantra> [6601] After that, the holder of outcaste family,
<tantra> [6602] Jñānasūtra, holds this very teaching.
<tantra> [6603] After that, the holder of householder family,
<tantra> [6604] Holds by Mahāmudrā-holders.
<tantra> [6605] After that, in the king family,
<tantra> [6606] Holds together with emanation-reflection.
<tantra> [6607] After that, in monastic form,
<tantra> [6608] By Lhun-gyal-tshen.
<tantra> [6609] After that, Siddha Śvara holds.
<tantra> [6610] After that, dwelling on earth,
<tantra> [6611] By Bodhisattvas holds.
<tantra> [6612] After that, Vajrapāṇi's
<tantra> [6613] Emanation, Vajra Pha, holds.
<tantra> [6614] After that, King Senge,
<tantra> [6615] By Zangpo holds.
<tantra> [6616] After that, Drakhar-Pa holds.
<tantra> [6617] After that, by Yogi Srawa holds.
<tantra> [6618] After that, King Khri-'od,
<tantra> [6619] After that, monk Pal-dang-ldan,
<tantra> [6620] Then by Lodrö Chok holds.
<tantra> [6621] Then by Ḍākinī Pal-'dzin-ma,
<tantra> [6622] Having held this teaching,
<tantra> [6623] Flourishes at the time of ten years of life;
<tantra> [6624] Then, not abiding, to self-place."
<tantra> [6625] Thus it is spoken.
[6626] Thus our holy master, monk Pal-dang-ldan,
[6627] The sequence of prophecy of emanations arising until Kumārarāja, protector of beings,
[6628] Especially, in hundreds of years,
[6629] In this Tibet, Vimalamitra's emanation, time, definitely clarifying the places of this essence—established in the great history:
[6630] This is the supreme one, possessing the mole-mark of A on the nose-tip,
[6631] The definite key point of oral instructions excelling others,
[6632] Prophesying the future by clairvoyance,
[6633] Clearly showing the definite difficult points,
[6634] And filling the world with definite, exceeding marks even at the time of parinirvāṇa.
[6635] Whoever meets this, liberated without effort from the town of saṃsāra, has arisen as the ornament of Jambudvīpa.
[6636] Protector of beings, extremely compassionate,
[6637] Having become the world's Guru-ornament, now arisen,
[6638] Having clearly shown the teaching of Clear Light Essence,
[6639] Gone to the peaceful sphere—to you, respectful prostration.
[6640] Always holding all of saṃsāra with compassion,
[6641] Although not passing to one-sided nirvāṇa peace,
[6642] By final deed, seeing beings' benefit,
[6643] Pervading the world with wonder—to you, respectful prostration.
[6644] In the first month of autumn, peaceful,
[6645] Having relinquished body-life in the supreme forest-retreat,
[6646] Again, what marvelous blessing-compassion,
[6647] Excelling others—to you, respectful prostration.
[6648] Where the protector became parinirvāṇa,
[6649] At that time, this earth with forests moved;
[6650] The appearance of five lights pervaded the sky,
[6651] Music's sweet sound played—to you, respectful prostration.
[6652] From melting body-relics, light-rays blazing in the sky,
[6653] Adorned by Ḍākinīs' offering-clouds and music,
[6654] All beings obtained non-conceptual meditation—
[6655] To the one showing limitless emanations, respectful prostration.
[6656] Siddhas, mantra-holders, and Ḍākinī gatherings,
[6657] Completely surrounded by arrangements of immeasurable offering-clouds,
[6658] Gone to the field of vidyādhara-victors,
[6659] To the sky-goer who obtained siddhi, respectful prostration.
[6660] For future beings, as a supreme merit-field,
[6661] From placed body-relics, the five families came,
[6662] From the crown, the fields of five families like rainbows,
[6663] Adorned with five lights, come—to you, respectful prostration.
[6664] Wherever body-relic fragments were invited,
[6665] Even when stūpas were erected and charity was done,
[6666] Five lights' appearance pervaded the sky,
[6667] Greatly moving beings' minds—to you, respectful prostration.
[6668] Vimalamitra, protector, compassionate,
[6669] By many emanations acting for beings' benefit,
[6670] Gone as emanation-ornament to the land of Tibet,
[6671] To Kumārarāja, the teacher, respectful prostration.
[6672] This clearly expresses the prophecy of our holy master as the emanation of vidyādhara.
[6673] Thus, in Jambudvīpa, by the gathering of vidyādhara-victors holding the supreme teaching, seven generations of flourishing passed,
[6674] From passing of ten years of life:
[6675] As shown before, the teaching's seed leaped to fields such as the Beautiful Arrangement, and acting for the benefit of ripening all beings.
[6676] When, from this good eon's thousand, passed a hundred million aeons of formation and destruction,
[6677] At the eon called "Saṃsāra-Emptier,"
[6678] Buddha Wheel Lightning Garland completely holding this supreme teaching,
[6679] Having liberated beings from saṃsāra,
[6680] All beings of the great Brahma aeon arranged by Vajradhara are liberated in the primordial ground, and the three seeds of the teaching also dissolve into the sphere of reality;
[6681] Saṃsāra is emptied;
[6682] From here, in twenty thousand great aeons, embodied ones do not appear.
[6683] Then again, as before, from the arising of latent tendencies, when the vessel and environment of beings appear,
[6684] The teacher of method also arises from the power of primordial Samantabhadra.
<tantra> [6685] As said in the Sound Great Thalgyur Tantra:
<tantra> [6686] "This secret heart-essence teaching,
<tantra> [6687] Thus, from the passing of seven teachings,
<tantra> [6688] From definitely experiencing seven fields,
<tantra> [6689] Thus, from the passing of seven also,
<tantra> [6690] On the threshold of Vajra Seat,
<tantra> [6691] The seed of all teachings' speech,
<tantra> [6692] The very self-arisen great syllable,
<tantra> [6693] Descends with sound;
<tantra> [6694] Here, in a hundred-million aeons,
<tantra> [6695] By Wheel Lightning Garland,
<tantra> [6696] Will appear to the Bhagavān.
<tantra> [6697] Then, three hundred years,
<tantra> [6698] Thus, below the passing of three,
<tantra> [6699] The teaching's mind-vajra also
<tantra> [6700] Will appear to that teacher.
<tantra> [6701] Then, in five hundred years,
<tantra> [6702] The teaching's kāya also descended there;
<tantra> [6703] Thus, from the actual descent of teaching,
