[10] <ornament> Treasury of Supreme Vehicle named. || 10 ||
[11] <ornament> To Glorious Samantabhadra I prostrate.
[12] <verse> Samantabhadra, whose innate nature holds the five perfections, complete in dominion,
[13] <verse> Together with the regent of the five families, the Great Ocean, the sublime guide, the Teacher,
[14] <verse> The five vidyādharas, hosts of the aural lineage, ornament of the three worlds together with the gods,
[15] <verse> To that crown of all joy, the glorious source of excellence and auspiciousness, I offer homage.
[16] <verse> That which from the primordial is pure, where all elaborations cease into space, beautifully arrayed,
[17] <verse> Nature ever-abiding, clear light, seven horses, pervading all three bodies and qualities,
[18] <verse> Not dwelling in existence or peace, spontaneously entered, uncompounded and spontaneously accomplished—
[19] <verse> To that Vajra-point, supreme possessor of all, the Sugata-essence, I prostrate.
[20] <verse> From the Dharma-sun, stainless, vast, immeasurable, ornament of space, || 20 ||
[21] <verse> The unsurpassed secret vajra vehicle, supreme among all, glorious as the wish-fulfilling jewel,
[22] <verse> Among these, the most supreme, the holy nature, the pinnacle of the Great Perfection,
[23] <verse> Revealing the essence of suchness directly—by that, this day, protect the lotus-throne of my mind.
[24] <verse> The place of the teaching-ocean, the throne of the makara-holder,
[25] <verse> The sphere of the Vajra-essence, supreme among all,
[26] <verse> Clearly revealing the profound and vast abodes—
[27] <verse> The explanation of the Treasury of Supreme Vehicle I shall compose.
[28] <prose> When the nectar of the Dharma-body is obtained,
[29] <prose> And the Enjoyment-body complete,
[30] <prose> And the Emanation-body manifests, || 30 ||
[31] <prose> The ocean of Dharma-principles spoken also depends upon teacher and
[32] <prose> Place and
[33] <prose> Teaching, whereby through classification into three aspects it is arranged:
[34] <prose> The perfection of place, the basis of dharmatā luminous clarity,
[35] <prose> In the precious spontaneously-accomplished field where appearances arise from uncompounded qualities that none have compounded.
[36] <prose> Teacher possessing perfections, complete power, the Victorious One, Samantabhadra, together with hosts of wisdom-ocean retinue,
[37] <prose> Abides in the intention where body and wisdom are inseparable,
[38] <prose> Teaching the nature of the Dharma-body beyond cause-effect and effort,
[39] <prose> The time beyond action and effort in dharmatā,
[40] <prose> Abiding in the primordial sphere of subtle inner clarity-wisdom. || 40 ||
[41] <prose> From that nature, or from blessing, the self-appearing field of dense arrangement,
[42] <prose> When adorned with outer lights of five, the individual teachers of the five families self-appear as the play of the mandala,
[43] <prose> When teaching dharmatā, luminous-clarity, dzogchen, self-appearing spontaneously accomplished,
[44] <prose> Abides in great self-arisen wisdom.
[45] <prose> Self-appearing beyond even the objects of action of pure trainees.
[46] <prose> From the strength and blessing of that nature, in Akanisṭha, the field of the Vajradhara of complete marks, dense arrangement, the sixth teacher Vajradhara arises in the form of the body of complete qualities,
[47] <prose> With retinue of perfections dwelling upon the earth, and
[48] <prose> Awareness-holders, and
[49] <prose> Ḍākiṇīs, and
[50] <prose> Accomplished ones, and || 50 ||
[51] <prose> Hosts completely arranged as self-appearances—to inconceivable ones, teaching the ocean-like tantra sections of the result-vajra vehicle,
[52] <prose> When perfect places appear individually to the self-appearances of beings,
[53] <prose> The perfect teacher in emanation-body appears as holy guides to tame each according to their capacity,
[54] <prose> When karma and aspiration are pure, teaching the perfections of sūtra sections,
[55] <prose> The Vinaya basket establishing ethical discipline,
[56] <prose> And the Abhidharma basket analyzing phenomena, appear as various vehicles suited to different capacities.
[57] <prose> To that, the three vehicles of causal characteristics are shown as cause and method for entering the result-vajra vehicle,
[58] <prose> While the secret mantra vajra vehicle, the completely complete peak, the supreme result, is the unsurpassable vehicle of dzogchen.
[59] <prose> That definitive realm is the teaching of luminous clarity, the vajra-essence,
[60] <prose> The self-nature wondrous and marvellous—the great complete vajra realm of the unsurpassable secret of all Tathāgatas' minds. || 60 ||
[61] <prose> Thus, from the Treasury of the Secret King:
[62] <prose><tantra> From the primordial protector's manifest enlightenment, the ocean of manners in which fields are arranged,
[63] <prose><tantra> And the manner of obtaining peace in this field through Vajradhara's emanation,
[64] <prose><tantra> From the manner of turning the Dharma-wheel through elaboration of emanation-kāya—
[65] <prose><tantra> First, before all, without any division of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa anywhere,
[66] <prose><tantra> The complete sovereign teacher, Samantabhadra himself,
[67] <prose><tantra> From the primordial basis, the awareness of self-arising wisdom, the Sugata's heart-essence, arises as basis-appearances,
[68] <prose><tantra> In the moment of transcending the basis, recognizing self-appearance—the precious cavity spontaneously accomplished by three self-arising dharmas,
[69] <prose><tantra> The great primordial purity, the exhaustion-place of beginning,
[70] <prose><tantra> Seizing the conquered place in the youth vase body's field, || 70 ||
[71] <prose><tantra> Having reached the end of abandon-realize qualities, becoming Buddha in the nature of dharmakāya, abiding in inner clarity.
[72] <prose><tantra> From the potency and blessing of that, the field pervaded by five wisdoms, self-appearing, spontaneous, dense—the maṇḍala arranged pervading the limits of sky, each of the five families as self-appearances, abiding beyond the trainee's objects.
[73] <prose><tantra> Then, long after, from the primordial basis arising as basis-appearance, seeing beings move like dreams, appearing like confusion without cause of confusion,
[74] <prose><tantra> Compassionate mind arises, arranging fields for the purpose of beings.
[75] <prose><tantra> From the appearance-aspect of self-appearing enjoyment-complete kāya, the kāyas of the five-family Buddhas, the great ocean, arranged at the limits of sky.
[76] <prose><tantra> The precious wheel of mudra,
[77] <prose><tantra> The vajra,
[78] <prose><tantra> The jewel,
[79] <prose><tantra> The lotus,
[80] <prose><tantra> And crosswise, appearing within, from the lotus-born, upon the upper portion, twenty-five fields, || 80 ||
[81] <prose><tantra> In the sphere where from pore-holes streams of perfume-water flow like a great ocean,
[82] <prose><tantra> Earth,
[83] <prose><tantra> Water,
[84] <prose><tantra> Fire,
[85] <prose><tantra> And subtle wind particles, as many as there are, pervading all places,
[86] <prose><tantra> The blessings of Buddha,
[87] <prose><tantra> And the diverse fields of beings' karma,
[88] <prose><tantra> Round,
[89] <prose><tantra> Four-cornered,
[90] <prose><tantra> Crescent, || 90 ||
[91] <prose><tantra> And semi-circle and so forth—forms and arrangements immeasurable, inconceivable, appearing—
[92] <prose><tantra> To the extent that sky pervades, to that extent body,
[93] <prose><tantra> Speech,
[94] <prose><tantra> Mind,
[95] <prose><tantra> Qualities,
[96] <prose><tantra> Activities,
[97] <prose><tantra> And fields arising from those pervade,
[98] <prose><tantra> Serving the purpose of beings in the perpetual continuous wheel.
[99] <prose><tantra> This is the training field and activities of the one, the first Samantabhadra.
[100] <prose><tantra> Vast like the dharma-sphere and the sky-field, || 100 ||
[101] <prose><tantra> From this first time only having arisen—years and eons, the field-particles like an ocean cannot be measured,
[102] <prose><tantra> Finally, these activities being complete cannot measure the latter end,
[103] <prose><tantra> In the great field-ocean possessing the essence of unmoving spontaneity,
[104] <prose><tantra> The Buddha naturally spontaneously accomplished, lama of all samsara and nirvana, having come in beginningless time,
[105] <prose><tantra> Arranging fields as three different appearances of the three bodies.
[106] <prose><tantra> In the time of dharma-body,
[107] <prose><tantra> Called the field of luminous-clarity vajra-essence.
[108] <prose><tantra> In the time of self-appearing enjoyment-complete body,
[109] <prose><tantra> Called the field of Brahma's drum-sound, or the great-Brahma eon and field.
[110] <prose> In this sense, the emanation Buddha of Samantabhadra himself, || 110 ||
[111] <prose> And those teachers who came in the three times, becoming Buddha through that blessing,
[112] <prose> All sentient-beings' realms exist.
[113] <prose> The training-field is very vast.
[114] <prose> That also—all earth, water, fire, wind, sky wherever pervading—all gathered within the great-Brahma eon.
[115] <prose> Then, when numberless fields beyond measure appear even in one particle-place of sentient-beings' confused appearance,
[116] <prose> To pure-karma appearance, Buddha's great activities appear variously,
[117] <prose> Again nirvana,
[118] <prose> Teaching dwelling,
[119] <prose> To impure ones enjoying bliss-fruit of higher-realms and liberation, path accomplishment etc., teaching subsides,
[120] <prose> Appearing as lower-realms, || 120 ||
[121] <prose> Enjoying various bliss-suffer appearance of eon-destruction etc.—
[122] <prose> Like a dream.
[123] <prose> Thus, even in one particle-place, great fields of mountains, continents, and so forth appear—
[124] <prose> Beings' confused appearance, clear appearance without truth—thus valid.
[125] <prose> As it is said:
[126] <prose><tantra> Even in the extent of a hair-tip, many Buddhas,
[127] <prose><tantra> As many as the sands of the Ganga river,
[128] <prose><tantra> Those Victors' fields also that many,
[129] <prose><tantra> Those characteristics not the same, eons not equal,
[130] <prose><tantra> In the extent of a hair, the five realms, || 130 ||
[131] <prose><tantra> Sentient hells and animals' realm,
[132] <prose><tantra> Yama's world, gods and humans dwell,
[133] <prose><tantra> Not mixed, not becoming harmful,
[134] <prose><tantra> In those places, lakes and oceans,
[135] <prose><tantra> Rivers, likewise lakes and pools,
[136] <prose><tantra> Not mixed, not becoming harmful.
[137] <prose><tantra> Thus the Victor's dharma is inconceivable.
[138] <prose><tantra> In that place, many mountains,
[139] <prose><tantra> Surrounding Sumeru, great Sumeru,
[140] <prose><tantra> Btang-zung and great btang-zung, || 140 ||
[141] <prose><tantra> 'Bigs-byed, vulture-heap, snow mountain,
[142] <prose><tantra> In that place, unbearable hell-beings,
[143] <prose><tantra> Hot and extremely hot, experiencing unpleasantness,
[144] <prose><tantra> Then hell-beings' feeling,
[145] <prose><tantra> Makes them experience following those sufferings.
[146] <prose><tantra> In that place, gods' palaces,
[147] <prose><tantra> Those twelve leagues of pleasantness,
[148] <prose><tantra> Even by many thousands of gods,
[149] <prose><tantra> With gods' joy, experiencing very great bliss.
[150] <prose><tantra> In that place, Buddhas arise, || 150 ||
[151] <prose><tantra> Teaching of world-knowledge blazing in appearance.
[152] <prose><tantra> In that very place, dharma also subsides,
[153] <prose><tantra> The sound of guide's nirvana also heard.
[154] <prose><tantra> Humans in their own houses like dreams,
[155] <prose><tantra> Intoxicated with joy in desire-qualities,
[156] <prose><tantra> Waking after, not seeing that desire.
[157] <prose><tantra> That is known as dream by that.
[158] <prose><tantra> Thus seeing, hearing, knowing, and distinguishing differences,
[159] <prose><tantra> All these are untrue, like dreams.
[160] <prose><tantra> So it is. || 160 ||
[161] <prose> Thus in the world of one particle-place, even in appearing subtle particles, sentient-beings' fields and arrangements are measureless.
[162] <prose> Thus in that world-system of a single particle's scope, within even the subtle particles of appearance, sentient beings' fields and displays are immeasurable.
[163] <prose> From the Sutra of Entering the Buddha Realm and Wisdom Inconceivable:
[164] <prose><tantra> The gods and humans of the three-thousand worlds are very few.
[165] <prose><tantra> An outsider sage with clairvoyance seeing sentient-beings across an earth-extent of a single chariot-wheel—that is more numerous.
[166] <prose><tantra> More than those seeing the three-thousand worlds, from the eight liberations of shravakas;
[167] <prose><tantra> More than those, from the eight liberations of bodhisattvas; more, a single meditator seeing across a single chariot-wheel.
[168] <prose><tantra> More than those seeing the three-thousand worlds,
[169] <prose><tantra> More, the Tathagata's eye seeing across the earth-extent of a chariot-wheel—thus spoke.
[170] <prose> Thus, wherever sky pervades, in those places sentient-beings pervade. || 170 ||
[171] <prose> Through Buddha's emanations pervading them, all purposes are accomplished.
[172] <prose> Some directly accomplish purposes through Samantabhadra's emanation as teacher.
[173] <prose> Some also accomplish purposes through Buddhas included in other tantras.
[174] <prose> Some through Buddhas included in other tantras accomplish purposes.
