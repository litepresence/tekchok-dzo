[10699] First, if one asserts like this: permanent and impermanent existents are established together,
[10700] Because impermanent things appear and dwell merely as appearances.
[10701] If one says impermanent things are established while permanent existents are not established,
[10702] Then the ability to accept anything whatsoever is damaged.
[10703] Likewise, it follows that samsara is liberated without effort,
[10704] And that those who are liberated would revert.
[10705] Because one accepts anything whatsoever.
[10706] Second, if one asserts like this: even rabbit horns and the son of a barren woman could create samsara and nirvana—one perceives faults that are limitless and endless.
[10707] From that,
[10708] Those who possess such assertions
[10709] The Teacher himself spoke of before:
[10710] <tantra> "All these are merely projections of directions,
[10711] <tantra> Because all are established as existing entities.
[10712] <tantra> Since faults are endless,
[10713] <tantra> Are not these knowable dharmas?
[10714] <tantra> What the Teacher spoke previously is the same."
[10715] Thus it is.
[10716] The sixth position is also expressed:
[10717] Because the essence arises everywhere, one holds that variegated appearances of multiplicity arise.
[10718] Second, the refutation of that:
[10719] Does one hold that multiplicity is outer appearance,
[10720] Or does one hold it is inner consciousness,
[10721] Or does one hold it is the gathering of those two?
