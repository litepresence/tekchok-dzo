[4468] First, emanation-kāya's posture:
[4469] Like a rishi hunched—
[4470] Two anklebones pressed: crucial point producing method-wisdom connection;
[4471] Two soles touching ground: crucial point suppressing action winds of grasping;
[4472] Knees pressed: crucial point dropping body's element into central channel;
[4473] Body straight stretched: crucial point channels not compressed, wind naturally slow;
[4474] Hands crossed: crucial point mixing expanse and awareness;
[4475] Elbows straight stretched: crucial point projecting wind to object, self-purifying.
[4476] From Thalgyur:
[4477] Emanation-kāya's posture: || 10 ||
[4478] Relying on rishi hunched,
[4479] Dharmatā appearances self-emanate,
[4480] Dharma eye sees—
[4481] Thus.
[4482] Definitive terminology:
[4483] "Emanation" means body's arising and various actions emanated, purified;
[4484] That purification matures into illusion-kāya;
[4485] Posture relies on ground tantra;
[4486] Relying on that posture, not returning to three realms—
[4487] From Golden Garuda: || 20 ||
[4488] Purifying body's aggregates,
[4489] Emanation-kāya's posture;
[4490] Whoever knows crucial point,
[4491] Liberates from that, Buddha.
[4492] Thus.
[4493] Saṃbhoga-kāya's posture:
[4494] Like elephant sleeping—
[4495] Hunched sleeping: crucial point pressing body's aggregate dharmas;
[4496] Knees pressed: crucial point dropping element heat;
[4497] Toes stretched outward: crucial point holding action wind; || 30 ||
[4498] Fingertips on ground: crucial point drawing awareness to expanse;
[4499] Elbows raised: crucial point awareness and expanse inseparable.
[4500] From Thalgyur:
[4501] Saṃbhoga-kāya's posture:
[4502] Relying on elephant sleep,
[4503] Dharmatā enjoyed,
[4504] Lotus eye sees—
[4505] Thus.
[4506] Definitive terminology:
[4507] "Enjoyment" means five desire-objects purified, || 40 ||
[4508] Leading into dharmatā unborn path;
[4509] Dharmatā direct crucial point engaged by eye faculty.
[4510] "Complete" means method liberating body's aggregate dharmas into light-clarity.
[4511] "Kāya" means ripening those, liberated from saṃsāra.
[4512] Relying on that crucial point, person always enjoying dharmatā direct,
[4513] Called saṃbhoga-kāya.
[4514] "Posture" means abiding in samādhi.
[4515] "Stance" means crucial point transcending three realms.
[4516] From Golden Garuda:
[4517] Enjoying from dharmatā expanse, || 50 ||
[4518] Relying on saṃbhoga-kāya's posture,
[4519] This engages three kāya fields,
[4520] Therefore supreme body crucial point,
[4521] Yogin supreme chief.
[4522] Thus.
[4523] Dharma-kāya's posture:
[4524] Like lion entering den—
[4525] Two soles on ground: crucial point equal element heat;
[4526] Body flexible sitting: crucial point suppressing action wind through wisdom wind projection;
[4527] Fingers bent on ground: crucial point reversing action wind; || 60 ||
[4528] Chest hollow placed: crucial point vision quickly dawning;
[4529] Neck strength relaxed: crucial point expanse and awareness never separating.
[4530] From Thalgyur:
[4531] Dharma-kāya's posture lion:
[4532] Delusion's fears all abandoned,
[4533] Vajra eye sees—
[4534] Thus.
[4535] Definitive terminology:
[4536] "Dharma" means liberating from body's aggregates;
[4537] "Kāya" means those completely pure, illusion-kāya always abiding. || 70 ||
[4538] "Posture" means not departing from samādhi abiding.
[4539] "Stance" means liberating from saṃsāra.
[4540] From Golden Garuda:
[4541] Dharma-kāya's posture manner:
[4542] Whoever knows body crucial point,
[4543] Compatible with that,
[4544] Yogin pure in dharmakāya bliss.
[4545] Thus.
[4546] Performing three kāyas' postures, not transgressing three kāyas' intent.
[4547] Emanation-kāya hunched: sign of future liberation through asceticism; || 80 ||
[4548] Saṃbhoga-kāya elephant: sign of future spontaneous effortless liberation;
[4549] Dharma-kāya lion: sign of future genuine fearless liberation.
[4550] Why elemental body's gaze transforms into three kāyas' gaze?
[4551] Three kāyas, luminous-clear, dwell in heart's innate presence;
[4552] Making gaze thus manifests three intents abiding within.
[4553] Since three kāyas exist as own constituents, own gaze becomes three kāyas' gaze.
[4554] When cold elemental body harmonizes with emanation-kāya: balanced warmth;
[4555] When hot: with dharmakāya;
[4556] When balanced: with saṃbhogakāya—auspicious.
[4557] Particularly, vision increases swiftly. || 90 ||
[4558] If posture not bent, awareness's self-resonance in body's channels does not arise;
[4559] Without raising, awareness-vision does not dawn in outer sky—therefore gaze precious.
[4560] Ordinary abiding cannot manifest awareness.
[4561] When dawn comes, ordinary abiding cannot increase; moreover decreases—therefore gaze precious.
[4562] As snake's limbs, though in body, not manifest—bend them, appear;
[4563] So awareness dawns from gaze's crucial point.
[4564] Are postures limited to three?
[4565] If one, two, three, or hundreds-thousands arise—what then?
[4566] Sentient beings led by three afflictions into three realms—liberated from that, therefore three determined.
[4567] Three afflictions ripening into body, speech, and mind—therefore three determined. || 100 ||
[4568] First from saṃsāra's karma wheel:
[4569] Desire impure ripening into form—bird form emerges,
[4570] Action and doer, speech chief, becoming;
[4571] When ripening into body, delight in speech,
[4572] Object chief, desire great,
[4573] Delight in desire comes.
[4574] Taking that into pure path,
[4575] Saṃbhogakāya posture shown.
[4576] Such beings always performing supreme saṃbhogakāya posture
[4577] Become supreme experts in dharmatā's meaning. || 110 ||
[4578] From saṃsāra's wheel, delusion impure ripening into form—pig emerges;
[4579] That producing latency, sentient beings' mind chief form ripening.
[4580] When ripening into form, mind changes much, intellect changes, conceptuality great,
[4581] Not delighting in speech,
[4582] Always delighting in sleep.
[4583] Always abiding in dharmakāya posture, determined to abide in dharmatā for three times.
[4584] First, aversion impure ripening into form—
[4585] Snake ripening, body action chief form emerging;
[4586] Delighting in body action, desire to move,
[4587] Body strength great, body coarse, || 120 ||
[4588] Body delighting in grooming, body emerged.
[4589] Always abiding in emanation-kāya posture, determined to become buddha.
[4590] Therefore posture determined as three.
[4591] Sentient beings' destiny emerging into body, speech, and mind,
[4592] Liberating from those bindings—therefore three alone determined.
[4593] More than that not needed;
[4594] Few incomplete—therefore three alone determined.
[4595] At this time, speech main-point: cutting speech.
[4596] From Thalgyur:
[4597] Speech—training, abiding, swallowing— || 130 ||
[4598] Must be made firm.
[4599] Thus.
[4600] Thus it is stated.
