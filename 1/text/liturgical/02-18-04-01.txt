[4520] <verse>Therefore the supreme crucial point of body,</verse>
[4521] <verse>The yogin supreme, the chief.</verse>
[4522] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[4523] <ornament>Dharmakāya's posture:</ornament>

[4549] <prose>The Dharmakāya lion: sign of future genuine fearless liberation.</prose>
[4550] <prose>Why does the elemental body's gaze transform into the three kāyas' gaze?</prose>
[4551] <prose>The three kāyas, luminous-clear, dwell in the heart's innate presence;</prose>
[4552] <prose>Making gaze thus manifests the three intents abiding within.</prose>
[4553] <prose>Since the three kāyas exist as one's own constituents, one's own gaze becomes the three kāyas' gaze.</prose>
[4554] <prose>When cold elemental body harmonizes with Nirmāṇakāya: balanced warmth;</prose>
[4555] <prose>When hot: with Dharmakāya;</prose>
[4556] <prose>When balanced: with Saṃbhogakāya—auspicious.</prose>
[4557] <prose>Particularly, vision increases swiftly. || 90 ||</prose>
[4558] <prose>If posture not bent, awareness's self-resonance in the body's channels does not arise;</prose>
[4559] <prose>Without raising, awareness-vision does not dawn in outer sky—therefore gaze is precious.</prose>
[4560] <prose>Ordinary abiding cannot manifest awareness.</prose>
[4561] <prose>When dawn comes, ordinary abiding cannot increase; moreover decreases—therefore gaze is precious.</prose>
[4562] <prose>As the snake's limbs, though in body, not manifest—bend them, they appear;</prose>
[4563] <prose>So awareness dawns from the gaze's crucial point.</prose>
[4564] <prose>Are postures limited to three?</prose>
[4565] <prose>If one, two, three, or hundreds-thousands arise—what then?</prose>
[4566] <prose>Sentient beings led by three afflictions into three realms—liberated from that, therefore three determined.</prose>
[4567] <prose>Three afflictions ripening into body, speech, and mind—therefore three determined. || 100 ||</prose>
[4568] <prose>First from saṃsāra's karma wheel:</prose>
[4569] <prose>Desire impure ripening into form—bird form emerges,</prose>
[4570] <prose>Action and doer, speech chief, becoming;</prose>
[4571] <prose>When ripening into body, delight in speech,</prose>
[4572] <prose>Object chief, desire great,</prose>
[4573] <prose>Delight in desire comes.</prose>
[4574] <prose>Taking that into pure path,</prose>
[4575] <prose>Saṃbhogakāya posture shown.</prose>
[4576] <prose>Such beings always performing supreme Saṃbhogakāya posture</prose>
[4577] <prose>Become supreme experts in dharmatā's meaning. || 110 ||</prose>
[4578] <prose>From saṃsāra's wheel, delusion impure ripening into form—pig emerges;</prose>
[4579] <prose>That producing latency, sentient beings' mind chief form ripening.</prose>
[4580] <prose>When ripening into form, mind changes much, intellect changes, conceptuality great,</prose>
[4581] <prose>Not delighting in speech,</prose>
[4582] <prose>Always delighting in sleep.</prose>
[4583] <prose>Always abiding in Dharmakāya posture, determined to abide in dharmatā for three times.</prose>
[4584] <prose>First, aversion impure ripening into form—</prose>
[4585] <prose>Snake ripening, body action chief form emerging;</prose>
[4586] <prose>Delighting in body action, desire to move,</prose>
[4587] <prose>Body strength great, body coarse, || 120 ||</prose>
[4588] <prose>Body delighting in grooming, body emerged.</prose>
[4589] <prose>Always abiding in Nirmāṇakāya posture, determined to become Buddha.</prose>
[4590] <prose>Therefore posture determined as three.</prose>
[4591] <prose>Sentient beings' destiny emerging into body, speech, and mind,</prose>
[4592] <prose>Liberating from those bindings—therefore three alone determined.</prose>
[4593] <prose>More than that not needed;</prose>
[4594] <prose>Few incomplete—therefore three alone determined.</prose>
[4595] <ornament>At this time, speech's main point: cutting speech.</ornament>
[4596] <tantra>From Thalgyur:</tantra>
[4597] <verse>Speech—training, abiding, swallowing— || 130 ||</verse>
[4598] <verse>Must be made firm.</verse>
[4599] <tantra>Thus.</tantra>
[4600] <tantra>Thus it is stated.</tantra>
