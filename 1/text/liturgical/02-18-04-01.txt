[4541] The manner of Dharmakaya's abiding—
[4542] Who knows this body's key point,
[4543] Compatible with that, the yogin
[4544] Becomes pure in great bliss of Dharmakaya.
[4545] Thus it was spoken.
[4546] By performing the three bodies' postures,
[4547] One does not transgress the intent of the three bodies.
[4548] The hunched nirmanakaya—sign of future liberation through asceticism;
[4549] The elephant sambhogakaya—sign of future spontaneous liberation through non-action;
[4550] The lion dharmakaya—sign of future genuine fearless liberation.
[4551] Why does the elemental body's gaze
[4552] Transform into the three bodies' gaze?
[4553] The three bodies, luminous and clear, dwell in the heart's innate presence.
[4554] By making the gaze thus,
[4555] One manifests the three intents abiding within.
[4556] Since the three bodies exist as one's own constituents,
[4557] One's own gaze goes into the three bodies' gaze.
[4558] When cold elemental body harmonizes with nirmanakaya—balanced warmth;
[4559] When hot—with dharmakaya;
[4560] When balanced—with sambhogakaya—auspicious.
[4561] Particularly, vision increases swiftly.
[4562] If posture is not bent, awareness's self-resonance in body's channels
[4563] Does not arise; without raising it, awareness-vision does not dawn in outer sky.
[4564] Therefore gaze is precious.
[4565] Ordinary abiding cannot manifest awareness.  When dawn comes, ordinary abiding cannot increase;  Moreover, it decreases again. Therefore gaze is precious.  As snake's limbs, though in body, are not manifest—  Bend them and they appear—  So awareness dawns from gaze's key point.  Are postures limited to three only?  If one, two, three, or hundreds-thousands arise—what then?

[4566] All sentient beings, led by three afflictions into three realms—
[4567] From that, liberation.
[4568] Three afflictions ripening into body, speech, and mind—
[4569] Therefore determined as three.
[4570] From the wheel of samsaric karma:
[4571] Desire impure ripening into form—bird form emerges;
[4572] Action and doer, speech chief, becoming;
[4573] When ripening into body, delight in speech,
[4574] Object chief, desire great,
[4575] Delight in desire comes.
[4576] To take that into the pure path,
[4577] Sambhogakaya posture is shown.
[4578] Such beings, always performing supreme sambhogakaya posture,
[4579] Become supreme experts in dharmata's meaning.
[4580] From samsara's wheel, delusion impure ripening into form—
[4581] Pig emerges;
[4582] That same producing latency, sentient beings' mind chief form ripening.
[4583] When ripening into form, mind changes much, intellect changes, conceptuality great,
[4584] Not delighting in speech,
[4585] Always delighting in sleep comes.
[4586] Always abiding in dharmakaya posture,
[4587] Determined to abide in dharmata for three times.
[4588] First, aversion impure ripening into form—
[4589] Snake ripening, body action chief form emerging;
[4590] This, delighting in body action, desire to move,
[4591] Body strength great, body coarse,
[4592] Body delighting in grooming, body emerged.
[4593] Always abiding in nirmanakaya posture, determined to become buddha.
[4594] Therefore posture is determined as three.
[4595] Sentient beings' destiny emerging into body, speech, and mind,
[4596] Liberating from those bindings—therefore three alone determined.  More than that not needed;  Few incomplete—therefore three alone determined.  At this time, speech main-point: cutting speech.

[4597] From Thalgyur:
[4598] Speech—training, abiding, swallowing—
[4599] Must be made firm.
[4600] Thus it was said.
