[10722] First: If one asserts that the basis is singular like the variety of appearances, there is the fault of that singular basis arising outwardly as variety. For if the ground were truly one, how could it manifest as the ten thousandfold display? The singular cannot become manifold—this is the logical consequence of such assertion.
[10722] 
[10722] From the Klongdrukpa:
[10722] <tantra>Declaring the basis as variety misses the essential point.
[10722] 
[10723] Second: If one asserts that the basis is multiple like the variety of appearances, there is the fault of that manifold basis failing to account for singular experience. For if the ground were truly many, how could there be unified consciousness? The manifold cannot become singular—this too has logical consequences.
[10723] 
[10723] From the Rigpa Rangshar:
[10723] <tantra>The ground taught as beyond number—why insist on multiplicity?
[10723] 
[10723] Third: The resolution transcending both extremes. The Tantra of the Garland of Views proclaims the ground is beyond singular and multiple. It is neither one, for it manifests as the infinite display; it is not many, for all appearances are of one taste in the expanse of Dharmakaya. The basis is the great Middle Way, free from the extremes of existence and non-existence.
