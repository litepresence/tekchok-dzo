[10722] First, if one asserts like this:
[10723] If the basis were singular like the variety of appearances, there is the fault of that singular basis arising outwardly as variety.
[10724] For if the ground were truly one, how could it manifest as the ten thousandfold display?
[10725] The singular cannot become manifold—this is the logical consequence of such assertion.
[10726] <tantra>Klong drug pa</tantra> declares the basis as variety, yet this misses the essential point.
[10727] At the level of intellectual understanding, such assertions may seem tenable.
[10728] But investigate: does the basis possess alternating effects, or does it revert to singularity?
[10729] The indeterminate becomes determined—this is the confusion of ordinary mind.
[10730] What is not established in itself cannot establish its own existence.
[10731] Determined action reaches its end in the seventh consciousness, yet this merely expresses acceptance.
[10732] The grasping at self-awareness becomes the basis for various views—mere names without substance.
[10733] Thus the refutation: if the basis were singular while self-awareness grasps at variety, fault arises.
[10734] Those who hold established tenets in this direction fail to see the fault of a manifold basis.
[10735] The singular ground cannot accommodate the diversity of phenomena—this is the great error.
[10736] Like space pretending to have color, the singular cannot contain the many.
[10737] Therefore, those who assert singularity fall into the extreme of eternalism.

[10738] Second, if one asserts the basis as multiple like the variety of appearances:
[10739] There is the fault of that manifold basis failing to account for singular experience.
[10740] For if the ground were truly many, how could there be unified consciousness?
[10741] The manifold cannot become singular—this too has logical consequences.
[10742] Multiple bases would generate multiple minds, yet we experience one continuous awareness.
[10743] The ten thousand things would be ten thousand grounds—absurd consequence indeed.
[10744] Each appearance would require its own basis, leading to infinite regress.
[10745] The manifold basis cannot explain the unity of meditative experience.
[10746] <tantra>Rig pa rang shar</tantra> teaches the ground as beyond number—why do you insist on multiplicity?
[10747] Those who hold the view of many bases fall into the extreme of nihilism.
[10748] For if each appearance has its own ground, what connects the perceptions of a single mind?
[10749] The multiple cannot produce the singular experience of clarity and emptiness united.
[10750] Like many lamps in separate rooms—how could they illuminate one space?
[10751] Therefore, those who assert multiplicity fail to reach the definitive meaning.
[10752] Both extremes—singularity and manifold—are conceptual constructs superimposed upon the nature.
[10753] Neither one nor many can describe the vast expanse of primordial purity.

[10754] Third, the resolution transcending both extremes:
[10755] <tantra>Man ngag lta ba'i phreng ba</tantra> proclaims the ground is beyond singular and multiple.
[10756] It is neither one, for it manifests as the infinite display of apparent existence.
[10757] It is not many, for all appearances are of one taste in the expanse of dharmakaya.
[10758] The basis is the great Middle Way, free from the extremes of existence and non-existence.
[10759] Like the moon reflected in water—neither one nor many, yet appearing as both.
[10760] The single essence displays as multiplicity; multiplicity resolves into singular essence.
[10761] This is the great secret of the primordial ground, not within the domain of intellectual analysis.
[10762] <tantra>Kun byed rgyal po</tantra> teaches: the basis is empty essence, nature clarity, compassion unobstructed.
[10763] In emptiness there is no one or many; in clarity, all distinctions manifest.
[10764] The inseparability of clarity and emptiness is the true nature of the basis.
[10765] Those who realize this have transcended the fault of both extremes.
[10766] They do not assert singularity, for they see the diversity of the display.
[10767] They do not assert multiplicity, for they know all is of one taste in luminosity.
[10768] This is the view of the Great Perfection, the summit of all vehicles.
[10769] The basis is not established as any extreme—neither existent, non-existent, both, nor neither.
[10770] Yet from this unestablished basis, all apparent existence arises unceasingly.
[10771] This is the wonder of spontaneous presence, the magical display of primordial wisdom.
[10772] Those who understand the basis in this way are liberated from all philosophical constructs.
[10773] They need not reject appearance, for appearance is the play of the basis.
[10774] They need not accept emptiness, for emptiness is the essence of the basis.
[10775] Acceptance and rejection both dissolve in the natural state beyond effort.
[10776] <tantra>Byang chub kyi sems kun byed rgyal po</tantra> declares this the definitive meaning.
[10777] Therefore, O fortunate ones, understand the basis as beyond one and many.
[10778] Rest evenly in this understanding, neither affirming nor denying.
[10779] This is the supreme path, the direct approach to the nature of mind.
[10780] Through this realization, may all beings awaken to their own true nature.
[10781] Thus is established the inconceivable ground, beyond singular and multiple.
