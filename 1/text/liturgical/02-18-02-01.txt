[4156] First, regarding bodily conduct that requires settling with necessity:
[4157] From the Single Son of Buddha:
[4158] The body—running and lying down,
[4159] Rising and moving the limbs,
[4160] Circumambulating and making prostrations,
[4161] Turning the limbs and bowing the head,
[4162] Whatever actions one remembers—
[4163] Dance and mudra transformations,
[4164] Whatever activities one engages in visualization:
[4165] Thus, whoever performs these,
[4166] Through naturally cutting the body's attachment,
[4167] Completely splitting open the body's attachment:
[4168] By this, one becomes the transformative body.
[4169] Thus it is said.
[4170] From Thalgyur:
[4171] The body—going and abiding,
[4172] Gathering and various illusory displays,
[4173] Extending and withdrawing the limbs,
[4174] Demonstrating various activities:
[4175] With mindful consciousness taking hold,
[4176] The bodily conduct of the six realms—
[4177] Mind takes hold, the body performs.
[4178] Thus, whoever is able to conduct,
[4179] Through whatever is contemplated, later the continuum ceases.
[4180] For this, there are two types of purpose:
[4181] Examine through the division of common and supreme.
[4182] Thus it is.
[4183] Moreover, through whatever is done here alone, in future times one will become enlightened right here,
[4184] From the Great Array Chapter Thirty-Two:
[4185] Whoever desires to split open attachment,
[4186] Through reversing the body's activities,
[4187] Through whatever conduct is performed now,
[4188] Later it will not be thus—
[4189] Through that reversal, even for the body,
[4190] Without abiding, throughout the three realms,
[4191] The body too does not enter.
[4192] Thus it is.
[4193] Moreover, at first when the body forms, speech and mind both depend upon it and form,
[4194] Therefore at first bodily conduct must be performed.
[4195] Through performing bodily conduct, later when bodily karma is exhausted, one lacks enthusiasm for activity, and there is the purpose of purifying bodily misdeeds.
[4196] From the Ornament Wheel:
[4197] Whoever splits open the body's attachment,
[4198] By this, cyclic existence's habitual patterns are cultivated.
[4199] Thus it is.
[4200] Through splitting open bodily attachment for seven days,
[4201] Or eleven,
[4202] Or half a month,
[4203] External bodily attachment self-reverses,
[4204] Internal body becomes endowed with peaceful discipline,
[4205] Secret illusory body is certainly liberated into clear light.
