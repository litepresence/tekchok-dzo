[4156] <prose> First: the need for settling the body's conduct, together with the purpose.
[4157] <tantra> From the Single Buddha Son:
[4158] <tantra> "Body moves and lies down,
[4159] <tantra> Rises and moves its limbs,
[4160] <tantra> Turns and makes prostrations,
[4161] <tantra> Limbs turn and head wraps—
[4162] <tantra> Whatever actions remembered,
[4163] <tantra> Dance and mudrā transformations,
[4164] <tantra> Whatever reference-actions done:
[4165] <tantra> Whoever does like this,
[4166] <tantra> Body's manifest grasping self-cut,
[4167] <tantra> Body's boundary divided—
[4168] <tantra> By this becomes the transformation body."
[4169] <ornament> Thus it is said, and:
[4170] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[4171] <tantra> "Body moves and sits,
[4172] <tantra> Bends and various delusion-wheels,
[4173] <tantra> Limbs extend and gather,
[4174] <tantra> Various action-forms shown;
[4175] <tantra> Remembering mind takes manifest,
[4176] <tantra> Six moves' form-conducts
[4177] <tantra> Mind takes, body does.
[4178] <tantra> Whoever can conduct like this,
[4179] <tantra> As thought, later continuum connects.
[4180] <tantra> Here needs are two,
[4181] <tantra> Common and supreme distinction examined."
[4182] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4183] <prose> That also: by just doing like this, in future times one becomes Buddha in that very state.
[4184] <tantra> From the Great Arrangement's Thirty-Second Chapter:
[4185] <tantra> "Whoever desires to divide the boundary,
[4186] <tantra> Body's action self-reversed—
[4187] <tantra> Now wherever conducted,
[4188] <tantra> Later it will not be thus;
[4189] <tantra> That self-reversed, body also
[4190] <tantra> Abides non-existent, in three realms
[4191] <tantra> Body does not enter."
[4192] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4193] <prose> That also: at first, when body attaches, speech and mind two rely on that and attach—thus first body conduct must be done.
[4194] <prose> Body conduct done, later body action ceases from desire to do, and there is need for body's sin purification.
[4195] <tantra> From the Wheel Arrangement:
[4196] <tantra> "Who divides the body's boundary,
[4197] <tantra> By this dispels saṃsāra's habits."
[4198] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4199] <prose> Dividing body's boundary: seven days, or eleven, or half a month done—
[4200] <prose> Outside body's attachment self-reversed, and
[4201] <prose> Inside body pacified and possessed, and
[4202] <prose> Secret illusory-body light-clear liberated—definite.
[4203] <prose> Then, settling for three days, or
[4204] <prose> Eleven, or
[4205] <prose> Seven done, aggregates expand and body applies to emanation-body.
[4206] <tantra> From the Golden Essence Tantra:
[4207] <tantra> "Who desires settling,
[4208] <tantra> Body's actions slow, engage;
[4209] <tantra> By this touches Buddha's body,
[4210] <tantra> Especially supreme, secret-accomplished."
[4211] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4212] <prose> Second: speech boundary-dividing conduct:
[4213] <tantra> From the Secret Conduct Seed Tantra:
[4214] <tantra> "That passed, speech conduct begins:
[4215] <tantra> Mantra and verbal Dharma sounds,
[4216] <tantra> Existent, non-existent, appearance,
[4217] <tantra> Mind-exist words variously spoken,
[4218] <tantra> Animals' various sign languages,
[4219] <tantra> Sounds of various forms—
[4220] <tantra> Whoever does like this,
[4221] <tantra> Speech's manifest grasping self-cut,
[4222] <tantra> Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's boundary divided by this."
[4223] <ornament> Thus it is said, and:
[4224] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[4225] <tantra> "Thus signs and measures reached, || 30 ||
[4226] <tantra> The yogin begins speech conduct;
[4227] <tantra> Expressing-realization's nature,
[4228] <tantra> Sound-voices of various forms,
[4229] <tantra> Whatever spoken, non-reversed—
[4230] <tantra> Gods, nāgas, yakṣas,
[4231] <tantra> Scent-eaters, gandharvas, pervaders' sounds,
[4232] <tantra> Good and bad distinctions spoken;
[4233] <tantra> Briefly, six moves' sounds,
[4234] <tantra> Mind's remembrance, thought, speech-spoken.
[4235] <tantra> Here also needs are two,
[4236] <tantra> Supreme and common, limit-distinction."
[4237] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4238] <prose> Thus, relying on speech's various expressed objects, saṃsāra's continuum in three realms is cut.
[4239] <tantra> From the Supreme Empowerment Tantra:
[4240] <tantra> "The suitable vessel, six family sounds,
[4241] <tantra> Self-suitable speaking,
[4242] <tantra> Six moves' wheel turns."
[4243] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4244] <prose> Above-explained days' effort begun:
[4245] <prose> For supreme effort, that self-attachment reversed; for common, recognizing all self-appearance as like definite non—
[4246] <prose> That body is ground, and
[4247] <prose> Mind is fruit; that two's related path is speech.
[4248] <prose> Speech conduct middle-definite,
[4249] <prose> Self and other's sound distinctions spoken, saṃsāra's expressing-related continuum cut,
[4250] <prose> Whatever speech speaks, that producing later non-entrance—
[4251] <prose> Need for letter-wheel's liberation exists.
[4252] <tantra> From the Wheel Arrangement:
[4253] <tantra> "Who divides speech's boundary,
[4254] <tantra> Saṃsāra's expression empties definite."
[4255] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4256] <prose> Third: mind's conduct:
[4257] <tantra> From the Single Buddha Son Tantra:
[4258] <tantra> "That self's below also:
[4259] <tantra> Mind's conduct should begin,
[4260] <tantra> Happy and unhappy, bliss and suffering,
[4261] <tantra> Eternal and non-eternal, etcetera,
[4262] <tantra> View-meditation-conduct's thought,
[4263] <tantra> Dharma and non-dharma, etcetera,
[4264] <tantra> Attachment, anger, ignorance,
[4265] <tantra> Virtue and non-virtue, etcetera's
[4266] <tantra> Thought-conducts variously done;
[4267] <tantra> Whoever does like this,
[4268] <tantra> Mind's manifest grasping self-cut,
[4269] <tantra> Saṃsāra-nirvāṇa's boundary divided."
[4270] <ornament> Thus it is said, and:
[4271] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[4272] <tantra> "Thus measures reached also,
[4273] <tantra> The yogin purifies mind;
[4274] <tantra> Past, future, present's
[4275] <tantra> Remember-think spread-gather wheel engaged,
[4276] <tantra> Happy, unhappy, good, bad mind,
[4277] <tantra> Existent, non-existent, various all,
[4278] <tantra> Outside examined, inside thought,
[4279] <tantra> Like thought, remembrance self,
[4280] <tantra> Later arise-continuum definite-ceases.
[4281] <tantra> This need, what distinction?"
[4282] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4283] <prose> Thus doing many suns, later three realms' wheel non-enters.
[4284] <tantra> From the Vajra Hut Arrangement:
[4285] <tantra> "Who thinks the wheel itself,
[4286] <tantra> Whoever can turn it,
[4287] <tantra> Later by that, mind-continuum ceases."
[4288] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4289] <prose> That after, spread-gather non-existent settling, remembrance's window self-closes.
[4290] <tantra> From the Glorious Possessor of Sky Light:
[4291] <tantra> "Concepts cut, window closes."
[4292] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4293] <prose> That also: body and speech two attachment non-existent time, mind root-cut conduct suitable.
[4294] <prose> Self-dissolving, trace-non purifying, from three realms liberated—
[4295] <tantra> From the Wheel Arrangement:
[4296] <tantra> "Who divides mind's boundary,
[4297] <tantra> By this mind not reversed."
[4298] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4299] <prose> Thus, boundary-dividing conduct three by means of, three realms non-entering done.
[4300] <tantra> From the Near Empowerment Realization:
[4301] <tantra> "Boundary divided self,
[4302] <tantra> Three realms reverse non—
[4303] <tantra> That settling shown.
[4304] <tantra> These are the preliminary rituals."
[4305] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4306] <prose> Thus, persons possessing effort doing conduct for three months, that self excellent some liberate also exist; middle and last, all to that direct-direct manifest introduction.
[4307] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[4308] <tantra> "Thus conduct complete done,
[4309] <tantra> Direct pith always engaged." || 50 ||
[4310] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4311] <prose> Nowadays, mind's preliminary after introduction, laziness-possessed power done.
[4312] <prose> Third: mind's introduction to body, speech, mind three's preliminary—
[4313] <prose> Preliminary actual and settling two.
[4314] <tantra> From that itself:
[4315] <tantra> "Before purifying sequence:
[4316] <tantra> Body's preliminary moving from,
[4317] <tantra> Individual action's cause ceases;
[4318] <tantra> Vajra posture done,
[4319] <tantra> Body purified benefits mind.
[4320] <mantra> Speech in hūṃ settled,
[4321] <tantra> Spread-applied and energy self-purified,
[4322] <tantra> Flexible energy path inserted—
[4323] <tantra> Thus speech purified benefits mind.
[4324] <tantra> Mind first arises place, and
[4325] <tantra> Middle abides place, last moves;
[4326] <tantra> Thus three examined, analyzed,
[4327] <tantra> Mind purified, mind's nature known."
[4328] <ornament> Thus it is said, and:
[4329] <tantra> The settling ritual also:
[4330] <tantra> "This time body, speech, mind's pith,
[4331] <tantra> Possessing yogin, settle do."
[4332] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4333] <prose> Those purposes, two from:
[4334] <prose> Common purpose: body, speech, mind three's obstacle, sin, obscuration purified.
[4335] <prose> Supreme purpose: body, speech, mind three liberated—
[4336] <tantra> From that itself:
[4337] <tantra> "Here purposes are two,
[4338] <tantra> Common-supreme distinction shown."
[4339] <ornament> Thus it is said.
[4340] <prose> Second meaning: actual not-leaking wisdom, mind continuum shown method two—
[4341] <prose> Actual word explanation, and
[4342] <prose> Meaning's progressive distinction.
[4343] <prose> First: word extremes decided, and
[4344] <prose> Meaning top-placed two from—
[4345] <prose> First:
[4346] <prose> "Actual" from four extremes:
[4347] <list> Ground-yet-not-actual: like seeing palace but not king—Great Completion some, attire-ground body hand-taking not, dharmata wide-gone, death-time ordinary dying.
[4348] <list> Actual-yet-not-ground: like seeing king but characteristics not definitely arrived—some instruction first pith top-arrived, yet final word extreme not decided, after that top-not-dwelling scattered.
[4349] <list> Neither actual nor ground: like neither king nor palace whatever seen—common vehicles' general word view-meditation intellect path done, meaning not meeting, final where-go not-knowing.
[4350] <list> Both actual and ground: like king again-again seen, characteristics well-known—direct Heart Essence's pith, rigpa actual-by-means-of seen, view-meditation thinking-only not-remaining, ground seen-by-means-of reverse place not-existing, saṃsāra-nirvāṇa time one-to cut yogi called.
[4351] <prose> That also: dharmata direct pith, guru-shown, seen-from confidence, although
[4352] <prose> Effort-by-means-of experience-to not-taken, this itself contaminated not-clear, Buddha not-become;
[4353] <prose> Later this meet difficult, world behind abandon, experience take important.
[4354] <prose> If pith exist although experience not-taken, lower ground treasure like—benefit not.
[4355] <prose> Second: meaning top-placed—
[4356] <prose> Rigpa self-instant placed, actual introduction: Vajra Linked-chain appearance seeing, thus said.
[4357] <prose> That also: actual show not, "rigpa" common express although, top not arrive—
[4358] <prose> Like Vajra-seat not-seeing, that story told, or
[4359] <prose> Blind good-speak, color other-show like.
[4360] <prose> Sometimes: "rigpa arise-not, emptiness" think;
[4361] <prose> Sometimes: "various dawn" think.
[4362] <prose> Those two, word guide good-good, essence emptiness sky-like, dawn-manner not-cease, mirror reflection-like—explaining although,
[4363] <prose> Now exist-exist;
[4364] <prose> Core empty flat, what not, one-only confidence—
[4365] <prose> Progressive nine vehicles' view-meditation-conduct, Buddha not become;
[4366] <prose> Intellect word go-return, experience arise-decrease, little arise time,
[4367] <prose> Sometimes "exist" think top, power-training realization raw what arise think, mind ease;
[4368] <prose> Sometimes "not" think in, mind falls,
[4369] <prose> Not-happy suffering hide-harm—
[4370] <prose> Definite what?
[4371] <prose> Now die what do, Dharma not, saṃsāra shal-thag do—rigpa's meaning see time not.
[4372] <tantra> From the Teacher Garab Dorje:
[4373] <tantra> "Intellect-grasping view, listen—affliction;
[4374] <tantra> Relying that, meditation—delusion;
[4375] <tantra> That arising conduct—hope cut;
[4376] <tantra> That fruit hope—delusion."
[4377] <ornament> Thus well-spoken, top arrived.
[4378] <prose> Here rigpa linked-chain seen time: rigpa's nature, good-bad and change-transformation not, all that state-from go place other not-existing—ground called, other-to wander not-possible.
[4379] <prose> That also: rigpa that, wind pith bind liberation sign, go-come exist;
[4380] <prose> Bindu rely liberation sign, bindu fine sphere exist;
[4381] <prose> Rigpa that, channel pith rely liberation sign, linked-chain fine crooked connection exist.
[4382] <prose> Those three, rigpa actual not although,
[4383] <prose> That rely quality, force method pith liberation.
[4384] <prose> Rigpa that see, familiarize need sign: linked-chain one-one connection exist.
[4385] <prose> That direct, that wisdom see purity eye see, see time liberation: born person heart arrow-strike like.
[4386] <prose> Dharmata see purity eye see,
[4387] <prose> Instant first, that distinction divide,
