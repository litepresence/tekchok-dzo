[4156] First, regarding bodily conduct that requires settling with necessity:
[4157] From the Single Son of Buddha:
[4158] The body—running and lying down,
[4159] Rising and moving the limbs,
[4160] Circumambulating and making prostrations,
[4161] Turning the limbs and bowing the head,
[4162] Whatever actions one remembers—
[4163] Dance and mudra transformations,
[4164] Whatever activities one engages in visualization:
[4165] Thus, whoever performs these, || 10 ||
[4166] Through naturally cutting the body's attachment,
[4167] Completely splitting open the body's attachment:
[4168] By this, one becomes the transformative body.
[4169] Thus it is said.
[4170] From Thalgyur:
[4171] The body—going and abiding,
[4172] Gathering and various illusory displays,
[4173] Extending and withdrawing the limbs,
[4174] Demonstrating various activities:
[4175] With mindful consciousness taking hold, || 20 ||
[4176] The bodily conduct of the six realms—
[4177] Mind takes hold, the body performs.
[4178] Thus, whoever is able to conduct,
[4179] Through whatever is contemplated, later the continuum ceases.
[4180] For this, there are two types of purpose:
[4181] Examine through the division of common and supreme.
[4182] Thus it is.
[4183] Moreover, through whatever is done here alone, in future times one will become enlightened right here,
[4184] From the Great Array Chapter Thirty-Two:
[4185] Whoever desires to split open attachment, || 30 ||
[4186] Through reversing the body's activities,
[4187] Through whatever conduct is performed now,
[4188] Later it will not be thus—
[4189] Through that reversal, even for the body,
[4190] Without abiding, throughout the three realms,
[4191] The body too does not enter.
[4192] Thus it is.
[4193] Moreover, at first when the body forms, speech and mind both depend upon it and form,
[4194] Therefore at first bodily conduct must be performed.
[4195] Through performing bodily conduct, later when bodily karma is exhausted, one lacks enthusiasm for activity, and there is the purpose of purifying bodily misdeeds. || 40 ||
[4196] From the Ornament Wheel:
[4197] Whoever splits open the body's attachment,
[4198] By this, cyclic existence's habitual patterns are cultivated.
[4199] Thus it is.
[4200] Through splitting open bodily attachment for seven days,
[4201] Or eleven,
[4202] Or half a month,
[4203] External bodily attachment self-reverses,
[4204] Internal body becomes endowed with peaceful discipline,
[4205] Secret illusory body is certainly liberated into clear light. || 50 ||
[4206] These are gathered into two: oral transmission and scriptures.
[4207] These are gathered into what is called mind sections.
[4208] The sections of space gathered into three spaces:
[4209] Space of meditation without meditation,
[4210] Space of nature without searching,
[4211] Space of no difference in characteristics—these three.
[4212] These are gathered into three thousand named tantras.
[4213] These are gathered into eleven thousand chapters.
[4214] These are gathered into twenty-two hundred thousand ślokas.
[4215] These are gathered into eight hundred thousand recitations. || 60 ||
[4216] These are gathered into two thousand distinctions.
[4217] These are gathered into nine hundred proclamations.
[4218] These are gathered into two thousand essential points.
[4219] These are gathered into fifty essence spheres.
[4220] These are gathered into fabricated liberation and
[4221] posited liberation,
[4222] liberated-as-is—these three aspects gathered.
[4223] These are gathered into space sections.
[4224] All pith instruction sections are gathered into three spaces:
[4225] Space of play without cessation, || 70 ||
[4226] Space of mind without liberation,
[4227] Space of essence without good or bad.
[4228] These are gathered into twelve thousand two named tantras.
[4229] These are gathered into twenty-four thousand chapters.
[4230] These are gathered into twenty-one hundred thousand ślokas.
[4231] These are gathered into eleven thousand recitations.
[4232] These are gathered into four thousand distinctions.
[4233] These are gathered into two thousand five hundred proclamations.
[4234] These are gathered into eighty-seven essence spheres.
[4235] These are gathered into three aspects: essential points gathered, || 80 ||
[4236] essential points seen,
[4237] essential points known.
[4238] These are gathered into two: oral transmission and scriptures.
[4239] Though scriptures are many,
[4240] tantras,
[4241] scriptures,
[4242] and pith instruction scriptures—these three gathered.
[4243] Though pith instruction scriptures are extremely many,
[4244] refutation,
[4245] accomplishment, || 90 ||
[4246] intention,
[4247] and recitation-focused scriptures—four gathered.
[4248] Regarding recitation:
[4249] recitation of intentional-meaning pith instructions,
[4250] recitation of abiding-nature essence,
[4251] recitation of philosophical system words,
[4252] recitation of non-dual samsara-nirvana—four gathered.
[4253] All of these are gathered into three: spreading essential points,
[4254] taming proclamations,
[4255] direct introduction, || 100 ||
[4256] and establishing directly in one's own essential point.
[4257] Gathering all of these, the great crucial general Dharma framework is well explained.
[4258] From the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
[4259] The detailed classification of philosophical systems: the fourth chapter.
[4260]
[4261] Thus having established the general framework of dharmas,
[4262] now explaining the unsurpassed vehicle in particular:
[4263] through the nature of tantra sections as knowables,
[4264] and the two determinations arising from that.
[4265] Regarding the nature of tantra sections, three aspects: || 110 ||
[4266] Brief showing of tantra framework,
[4267] Detailed explanation of its nature,
[4268] Determination of explanation method branches.
[4269] The first has six aspects:
[4270] Tantra essence,
[4271] Definitive term,
[4272] Divisions,
[4273] Reading measure,
[4274] Example,
[4275] and Proof. || 120 ||
[4276] First, the essence of tantra:
[4277] Awareness and the basis establishing it—the great secret place unable to be added to or subtracted from, decisive.
[4278] Definitive term:
[4279] Showing family, therefore tantra,
[4280] That which causes birth in whatever family, therefore continuum.
[4281] Decisive and unbroken continuity, therefore tantra.
[4282] Divisions: nature-meaning tantra
[4283] and indicating-word tantra, two aspects.
[4284] Meaning tantra is:
[4285] Mind-itself luminosity by nature, free from conceptualization stains, || 130 ||
[4286] Abiding permanently in all, therefore tantra,
[4287] Buddha family, therefore tantra,
[4288] Possessing Buddha characteristics, therefore posited as tantra.
[4289] Word tantra is:
[4290] That very thing indicated by name-word-letter nature, divided into chapters, etc.,
[4291] Generation stage primarily method,
[4292] Perfection stage primarily wisdom,
[4293] Both equally non-dual union,
[4294] Showing transcendence of all—Great Perfection essential point revealers.
[4295] Reading measure: generation stage chief, ten aspects: || 140 ||
[4296] First, basis empowerment and samaya two,
[4297] Deity and mantra two,
[4298] Mandala and offering two,
[4299] Concentration and conduct two,
[4300] Activity and view two, these ten complete, generation stage chief tantra.
[4301] Perfection stage reading measure:
[4302] View and result two,
[4303] Conduct and meditation two,
[4304] Mind and wisdom two,
[4305] Experience and instruction two—these eight complete, perfection stage chief reading measure. || 150 ||
[4306] Non-dual union:
[4307] Both of these must be complete, eighteen.
[4308] Great Perfection complete:
[4309] Generation and perfection two, perfection stage,
[4310] Perfection stage: lesser elaboration showing channels-winds-bindus,
[4311] Great showing clear light wisdom stage two,
[4312] Great: its reading measure, entering door, empowerment and samaya two,
[4313] Path and recitation two,
[4314] Result and five complete.
[4315] Example: like warp threads, || 160 ||
[4316] Depending on many cause threads, woven into cloth,
[4317] Depending on different words, revealing single meaning.
[4318] Proof: tantra abiding in oneself, showing indicator,
[4319] Therefore proven as tantra.
[4320]
[4321] Moreover, depending on word-essential points, meaning-place without error decisively established, realizing, therefore posited as tantra.
[4322] Second, detailed explanation of its nature, two aspects:
[4323] Detailed explanation of meaning tantra and word tantra.
[4324] The first, two aspects:
[4325] Method tantra || 170 ||
[4326] and nature tantra.
[4327] First:
[4328] Awareness and pith instructions applying its meaning.
[4329] Divisions: indicated-method tantra
[4330] and indicating-method tantra, two aspects.
[4331] First, essence:
[4332] Awareness pervading all beings, bodhicitta.
[4333] Definitive term: that very thing, indicated-meaning and realization-basis and liberation-method,
[4334] Therefore called indicated-method tantra.
[4335] Divisions: || 180 ||
[4336] emptiness
[4337] and clarity, two aspects.
[4338] Emptiness: awareness-essence empty of thing and mark dharmas in all, free from elaboration extremes, primordially abiding.
[4339] Clarity:
[4340]
[4341] That clarity, not entirely empty, self-light five wisdoms' clear appearance,
[4342] Warmth and coolness and lightness,
[4343] Vast nature chief five elements primordially spontaneously complete,
[4344] Compassion's resonance unceasingly arising, awareness primordially pervading.
[4345] Moreover, awareness clarity-emptiness great wisdom pervading all beings, || 190 ||
[4346] Called indicated-method tantra.
[4347] From the Pearl Garland:
[4348] All Buddhas' method tantra,
[4349] Single basis essence distinction,
[4350] Indicated and indicating.
[4351] Indicated tantra single pervader,
[4352] All connected as its following.
[4353] Pervasion has two aspects:
[4354] Emptiness pervasion and clarity pervasion.
[4355] Emptiness single cause without thing, || 200 ||
[4356] Transcending all things' dharmas.
[4357] Actual non-appearance single pervader,
[4358] All become basis single essence.
[4359] Pervader itself gathering.
[4360] Unborn mindfulness exhausted by
[4361] essence distinction.
[4362] Empty and appearing, appearing and empty.
[4363] Actual and non-actual both.
[4364] Exhausted, therefore primordially empty abiding.
[4365] Free from causes and conditions, empty object. || 210 ||
[4366] Pervading vast non-actual essence empty.
[4367] Stainless and unmixed complete.
[4368] Without concept empty nature.
[4369] Emptiness pervading, therefore tantra.
[4370] Clear, nature not ceased.
[4371] Illuminating appearance and pervader.
[4372] Clear and warmth and coolness.
[4373] Vast and moving essence holder.
[4374] Pervasion and self-resonance self-clear.
[4375] Liberating ripening seed. || 220 ||
[4376] From emptiness reverse, therefore clarity pervades.
[4377] Sudden and self-liberation.
[4378] Self-arisen clarity connected with body.
[4379] Stainless and individually clear.
[4380] Without grasping clear object appearing.
[4381]
[4382] Looking far with clarity pervasion,
[4383] Binding the clear expanse of space.
[4384] Not cut off, pervading sphere.
[4385] Pervading essential points essential. || 230 ||
[4386] Signs of seeing completely liberated.
[4387] Moving and pervading essential points.
[4388] Spheres connected with body.
[4389] Pervading signs pervading essential points.
[4390] Reversing through pervasion.
[4391] Here, seeing awareness like a chain,
[4392] Awareness' nature without good or bad, without change,
[4393] All from that state without other destination, therefore called basis,
[4394] Other wandering impossible.
[4395] Moreover, awareness bound by wind essential point liberated sign, || 240 ||
[4396] Coming and going, existing,
[4397] Depending on bindu liberated sign, subtle bindu sphere existing,
[4398] Awareness depending on channel essential point liberated sign, chain subtle and curved connection existing.
[4399] These three, awareness not actual,
[4400] First instant distinction parted.
