[6801] <prose> Through emptying the seeds of the six families within the student's mind-nature,
[6802] <prose> The six afflictions self-liberate into their own place—
[6803] <prose> The meaning of the six pristine cognitions dawns as spontaneous presence,
[6804] <prose> For such is the natural capability of awareness itself.
[6805] <prose> Regarding Gurus, recognize the display of wisdom:
[6806] <prose> Root and branch—two aspects of the single Dharmakaya.
[6807] <prose> The root Guru is not a person but self-arisen wisdom's display:
[6808] <list> Completing the four marks as natural wisdom-manifestation,
[6809] <list> Having established Empowerment as the spontaneous basis,
[6810] <list> Explains the Tantra as the play of one's own rigpa; || 10 ||
[6811] <list> Teaches oral instructions pointing directly to mind nature.
[6812] <prose> Through practicing these, one recognizes the Guru is one's own awareness.
[6813] <prose> The oral instruction Guru, having established Empowerment as the basis,
[6814] <prose> Explains the Tantra—possessing two qualities of wisdom-display;
[6815] <prose> If oral instructions transmit recognition, becomes the branch Guru
[6816] <prose> possessing three qualifications—yet all are your own rigpa's play.
[6817] <prose> The training master to be avoided—recognize these as projections:
[6818] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[6819] <tantra> "Great ignorance and pride—these are mind's own displays,
[6820] <tantra> Foolishness, words attached to externals—recognize their empty nature, || 20 ||
[6821] <tantra> Inattentive to the meaning of Secret Mantra, missing the pointing,
[6822] <tantra> Critical speech of arrogance toward others—failed to see self-appearance,
[6823] <tantra> Entered upon wrong paths, not recognizing the natural state,
[6824] <tantra> Face of the Empowerment Maṇḍala not seen—your own face obscured,
[6825] <tantra> Samaya spread casually, not knowing it's mind's natural purity,
[6826] <tantra> Unable to answer questions—how can one speak of what has no words?
[6827] <tantra> Little learning, great pride—these are the student's own obstacles;
[6828] <tantra> Such a master, unexamined, is your mind's confusion-display.
[6829] <tantra> Do not associate with failure to recognize your own nature."
[6830] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 30 ||
[6831] <prose> The self-nature of the student—recognize these ten as rigpa's natural expression:
[6832] <prose> Mind turned away from saṃsāra's dharmas through seeing their emptiness,
[6833] <list> Great devotion and longing dawning naturally toward Guru, Dharma, and companions—
[6834] <prose> For in recognizing mind nature, all appear as wisdom's play;
[6835] <list> Faith firm, mind not entering other than Dharma—recognition has no path elsewhere;
[6836] <list> Desiring the definitive meaning, great generosity and diligence arise spontaneously;
[6837] <list> Few attachments, good nature—self-liberation's natural ornament;
[6838] <list> Great wisdom, abiding in Samaya and vows—knowing these are mind's display;
[6839] <list> Harmonizing with others' minds, transforming through Dharma—self and other are one in rigpa;
[6840] <list> Listening to the Guru's speech, not confusing the secret door—hearing the unspoken; || 40 ||
[6841] <list> Great study and contemplation, self-nature tamed—recognizing nothing needs taming;
[6842] <list> Especially possessing devotion to the Guru as Buddha or surpassing that—
[6843] <prose> Recognizing: the Guru before you is your own awareness's spontaneous display.
[6844] <prose> Such is the excellent student of supreme liberation;
[6845] <prose> One who will certainly obtain supreme liberation from saṃsāra quickly
[6846] <prose> By recognizing that saṃsāra itself is the display of rigpa.
[6847] <prose> Thus also it is spoken:
[6848] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[6849] <tantra> "Great power of faith and diligence—natural dawning upon recognition,
[6850] <tantra> Great wisdom without attachment—recognizing there is nothing to attach to, || 50 ||
[6851] <tantra> Great humility, conducting Secret Mantra—knowing one's nature as humble openness,
[6852] <tantra> Mind without conception, not distracted—resting in the natural state,
[6853] <tantra> Possessing Samaya, diligent in practice—Samaya is awareness itself,
[6854] <tantra> Steady, clear, and longing devotion—rigpa's natural radiance,
[6855] <tantra> Lucid and natural in meditation conduct—no meditation, no distraction,
[6856] <tantra> Acting according to the master's teaching—the master is your own awareness,
[6857] <tantra> Not abandoning Samaya casually—how can awareness be abandoned?
[6858] <tantra> Conduct agreeable with others' conduct—for self and other are one in nature,
[6859] <tantra> Mind gentle through respect—respect for the Dharmakaya you are,
[6860] <tantra> Following even one word of teaching—following the pointing to your own face, || 60 ||
[6861] <tantra> Conducting thus for one's own benefit—benefit that requires no gaining,
[6862] <tantra> Making the secret object of seeking endure—seeking what was never lost,
[6863] <tantra> Not transgressing from the Vajra meaning—the meaning of your own mind,
[6864] <tantra> Relying upon the person of great learning—who points you to yourself,
[6865] <tantra> Not transgressing from one's own benefit—recognizing benefit is already complete,
[6866] <tantra> Speaking gently without arrogant words—for what is there to claim as mine?
[6867] <tantra> Making agreeable entry with others' minds—all minds are Dharmakaya,
[6868] <tantra> Making Guru and Tathāgata without difference—recognizing your own face,
[6869] <tantra> Of one nature—this is the student's true characteristic:
[6870] <tantra> Seeing all as the display of single awareness. || 70 ||
[6871] <tantra> Thus possessing such recognition,
[6872] <tantra> The student is spoken as the vessel of Great Perfection."
[6873] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6874] <prose> The student to be abandoned—recognize these as failure to see one's nature:
[6875] <tantra> From that same source:
[6876] <tantra> "Not performing honor and humility—failed to bow to one's own awareness,
[6877] <tantra> Conducting Secret Mantra carelessly—not recognizing the precious meaning,
[6878] <tantra> Without family lineage and without natural lineage—cut off from one's own face,
[6879] <tantra> Having become small in wisdom—obscured by grasping at duality,
[6880] <tantra> Disregarding kindness—forgetting all beings share one's nature, || 80 ||
[6881] <tantra> Speaking of one's own family lineage—clinging to constructs,
[6882] <tantra> Putting good ornaments upon the body—adorning the illusory,
[6883] <tantra> Having become spread without meaning—scattered, not recognizing rigpa.
[6884] <tantra> Such a student, unexamined, is the failure to recognize one's own nature;
[6885] <tantra> To the person who does not take recognition into practice,
[6886] <tantra> The meaning of Great Perfection is not explained—
[6887] <tantra> For it cannot be explained, only recognized."
[6888] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6889] <prose> Moreover, such a bad vessel cannot hold the essence of recognition,
[6890] <prose> Just as lion's milk cannot be held in a clay vessel. || 90 ||
[6891] <prose> If poured therein, the greatness of recognizing mind's nature is lost, and
[6892] <prose> Through that failure to recognize, one wanders in saṃsāra's display;
[6893] <prose> To such a vessel of non-recognition, it must be kept secret.
[6894] <tantra> From that same source:
[6895] <tantra> "The meaning of Great Perfection oral instructions—
[6896] <tantra> Do not pour into vessels of confusion generally;
[6897] <tantra> The essence of recognition, if possessed,
[6898] <tantra> If poured into vessels of non-recognition,
[6899] <tantra> Makes both essence and vessel obscured.
[6900] <tantra> Therefore, keep secret from those who have not recognized their nature." || 100 ||
[6901] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6902] <prose> Regarding the Dharma to be made common, there are three aspects:
[6903] <list> The Dharma that master and student recognize in common,
[6904] <list> The manner of relying upon and supplicating one's own awareness,
[6905] <list> The result of definite purpose—the recognition of Dharmakaya.
[6906] <prose> First:
[6907] <prose> That master beholds that student with continuous compassion—recognizing the student as awareness,
[6908] <prose> Timely benefit, care, and Dharma—pointing again and again to the nature of mind,
[6909] <prose> Even merely with food and drink giving benefit—everything becomes the path of recognition;
[6910] <prose> That student contemplates that Guru's qualities—recognizing the Guru as self-awareness's display, || 110 ||
[6911] <prose> Making longing devotion and faith continuous—the natural response to recognizing one's nature.
[6912] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[6913] <tantra> "Compassion's connection-rope—how could it be cut?
[6914] <tantra> It is the single thread of Dharmakaya,
[6915] <tantra> Longing, continuous—
[6916] <tantra> This is the recognition of master and student as one."
[6917] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6918] <prose> Second:
[6919] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[6920] <tantra> "To those possessing the complete characteristics of recognition, || 120 ||
[6921] <tantra> Kingdom and one's own body—all are awareness's display,
[6922] <tantra> By retinue and possessions serve—knowing all as the play of rigpa;
[6923] <tantra> By pleasing body, speech, and conduct,
[6924] <tantra> Rely upon the Guru who is Buddha—both are your own awareness,
[6925] <tantra> United as equal in the single Dharmakaya;
[6926] <tantra> Possessing faith and wisdom—recognizing mind nature,
[6927] <tantra> Faithful and without delusion—resting without confusion,
[6928] <tantra> Without error in expressed objects—all expressions are awareness,
[6929] <tantra> By clear faculties, rely upon the Guru—rely upon your own face."
[6930] <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 130 ||
[6931] <prose> That student, possessing aspiration for Empowerment of elaboration and so forth,
[6932] <prose> Desire to request instructions pointing to recognition, does not enter suddenly;
[6933] <prose> Even for common invitation, a former message must first be sent—just so.
[6934] <prose> Therefore, from former times of five, seven, or three years, offering maṇḍalas
[6935] <prose> of accumulations, gold, and so forth to the Guru—offering to your own awareness,
[6936] <prose> When self is of such age, requesting "This Empowerment," or "This instruction,"
[6937] <prose> requesting permission by asking—supplicating again and again,
[6938] <prose> At the beginning of one's virtue-practice session, contemplating that Guru's yoga
[6939] <prose> day and night, six times—recognizing that the Guru is never separate from you.
[6940] <prose> The Guru also, giving permission: "Son, if you ask for Empowerment, || 140 ||
[6941] <prose> for removing obstacles and purifying sins in that interval, contemplate the Guru
[6942] <prose> upon the crown day and night, six times—recognize the Guru is your own rigpa,
[6943] <prose> obtain supplication"—thus causing supplication to be made.
[6944] <prose> That purpose: ripening the body into the deity-kāya—recognizing the body as display,
[6945] <prose> Ripening speech into the self-sound of ali and kali—recognizing speech as resonance,
[6946] <prose> Ripening mind free from the face of emptiness meditation—recognizing mind as emptiness,
[6947] <prose> Such is the purpose of pointing to your own nature.
[6948] <prose> At that time, through making fierce aspiration, thinking "Whatever Empowerment I desire,
[6949] <prose> I must obtain by any means"—I must recognize my own nature by any means,
[6950] <prose> Explaining Dharma in dreams—mind nature explaining itself, || 150 ||
[6951] <prose> Prophecy, and so forth—signs of Guru accomplishment definitely arise—
[6952] <prose> Signs that you have recognized the Guru as your own awareness.
[6953] <prose> Third, the result of definite purpose:
[6954] <prose> Thus, having supplicated before and relied upon the Guru—relied upon recognition,
[6955] <prose> Whatever is desired all becomes accomplished—recognition fulfills all wishes,
[6956] <prose> Arising like a wish-fulfilling jewel and wish-fulfilling tree—the natural display of mind.
[6957] <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[6958] <tantra> "From relying upon that—relying upon recognition of one's nature,
[6959] <tantra> Qualities arise like a wish-fulfilling tree and wish-fulfilling jewel,
[6960] <tantra> Like a cow of desires—all needs spontaneously fulfilled, || 160 ||
[6961] <tantra> Obtain immeasurable qualities—naturally present, not acquired;
[6962] <tantra> Aiming at that, rely upon the Guru—rely upon the pointing to your own face,
[6963] <tantra> To reverse from saṃsāra's battle—reverse from the confusion of not recognizing."
[6964] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6965] <prose> Fourth, the activity of Empowerment—how to confer—five aspects:
[6966] <list> The benefit of Empowerment—recognition of mind nature,
[6967] <list> The defect of not being empowered—failing to recognize,
[6968] <list> The place where to empower—the natural place of awareness,
[6969] <list> The time when to empower—the timeless moment of recognition,
[6970] <list> The sequence of celebration—celebrating the recognition of one's nature. || 170 ||
[6971] <prose> First:
[6972] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[6973] <tantra> "Qualities, particularly these—the qualities of recognition:
[6974] <tantra> Great Jñāna-appearance—your own face seen clearly,
[6975] <tantra> Becoming without obstacles—for obstacles are self-liberated,
[6976] <tantra> Self-appearance shown as helper—all displays assist recognition,
[6977] <tantra> Becoming one who performs all actions—spontaneously accomplished."
[6978] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6979] <tantra> From the Jewel Empowerment Tantra:
[6980] <tantra> "By abandoning the Guru's desire—abandoning seeking outside, || 180 ||
[6981] <tantra> If the Empowerment ritual is completed—the ritual of recognizing one's nature,
[6982] <tantra> By the sequence of how Empowerment is conferred—the pointing to your own face,
[6983] <tantra> Even great Vajradhara—the nature you already are,
[6984] <tantra> Definitely becomes manifest in this life—recognized now, not later."
[6985] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6986] <tantra> From the Secret Essence:
[6987] <tantra> "If empowered by five essences—empowered by recognizing the five wisdoms,
[6988] <tantra> After this time, Buddha's son—child of your own awareness,
[6989] <tantra> All lower realms not—for saṃsāra is recognized as display,
[6990] <tantra> Becomes master of higher liberation—the master of your own mind." || 190 ||
[6991] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6992] <prose> Also from the Self-Arisen:
[6993] <tantra> "Benefits of Empowerment are like this—benefits of recognizing mind nature:
[6994] <tantra> In the intermediate state, self-appearance will be recognized;
[6995] <tantra> Having recognized, stability in that itself is obtained—
[6996] <tantra> Able to dissolve the Nirmāṇakāya in twenty-one days—
[6997] <tantra> Even one of excellent faculties, suffering and fear do not come.
[6998] <tantra> At the time of practice also, jñāna-appearance clearly does not cease—
[6999] <tantra> Continuous recognition without interruption. || 200 ||
[7000] <tantra> That is called 'special quality'—the quality of unceasing recognition.
[7001] <tantra> Common qualities are obtained like this: natural displays of awareness,
[7002] <tantra> Knowing the Ḍākinī's voice—hearing all sounds as mantras,
[7003] <tantra> Making the Ḍākinī's blessing—blessing that was never separate,
[7004] <tantra> Being seen as worthy of honor by humans through blessing,
[7005] <tantra> Loving-kindness toward all beings—for all are one's own display,
[7006] <tantra> Beautiful form, lovely to see—the beauty of recognizing nature,
[7007] <tantra> Great merit increasing—merit that needs no accumulation,
[7008] <tantra> Even after death, birth in the body of a Cakravartin king—
[7009] <tantra> Or better: birth as the display of one's own awareness.
[7010] <tantra> Great qualities arising like a precious jewel—naturally present, || 210 ||
[7011] <tantra> Conducting pure Dharma like a lotus—pure because never stained,
[7012] <tantra> Being seen as worthy of being surrounded by all like a Stūpa—
[7013] <tantra> The stūpa of Dharmakaya, naturally present,
[7014] <tantra> Overpowering common beings like a parasol—overpowering confusion,
[7015] <tantra> Able to liberate beings by wisdom like a mass of fire—
[7016] <tantra> Wisdom that burns the fuel of duality,
[7017] <tantra> Able to do benefit like a sword—cutting through confusion,
[7018] <tantra> Able to hold beings with compassion like a Vajra hook—
[7019] <tantra> Holding them in the recognition of their own nature,
[7020] <tantra> Realizing the meaning of Dharmadhātu and jñāna without gathering and separation— || 220 ||
[7021] <tantra> Realizing they were never separate,
[7022] <tantra> Performing all outer and inner actions—spontaneously accomplished.
[7023] <tantra> From these and so forth, one hundred eight qualities are obtained—
[7024] <tantra> Qualities of recognizing your own face."
[7025] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[7026] <prose> Second, the defect of not being empowered—the defect of non-recognition:
[7027] <tantra> From the Magical Display Secret Essence:
[7028] <tantra> "Not pleasing the master—not pleasing your own awareness,
[7029] <tantra> Not obtaining Empowerments—not obtaining recognition,
[7030] <tantra> Beginning to listen and so forth—activities without recognition, || 230 ||
[7031] <tantra> Become without result and ruined—wandering in saṃsāra's confusion."
[7032] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[7033] <tantra> From the Great Self-Arisen Empowerment Tantra:
[7034] <tantra> "Not relying upon Secret Mantra Empowerment—relying upon confusion instead,
[7035] <tantra> Does not accomplish; like a ferryman without hands,
[7036] <tantra> Unable to cross to the other shore of the river—unable to cross from confusion."
[7037] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[7038] <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[7039] <tantra> "The defect of not obtaining Empowerment is like this—non-recognition's results:
[7040] <tantra> Fainting in the intermediate state—confused by self-appearance, || 240 ||
[7041] <tantra> Fear, suffocation, obstacles, and losing perception arise—
[7042] <tantra> The suffering of not recognizing your own nature.
[7043] <tantra> Even until not abandoning the body of latent tendencies, not being seen
[7044] <tantra> as worthy of honor by beings—obscured by non-recognition,
[7045] <tantra> Little merit, short life, few enjoyments of livelihood,
[7046] <tantra> Close mouth, many obstacles arise—all from not recognizing;
[7047] <tantra> All actions are not accomplished—for confusion cannot accomplish.
[7048] <tantra> That is the defect of not obtaining Empowerment for Secret Mantra practice—
[7049] <tantra> The defect of not recognizing your own face.
[7050] <tantra> The yogi of Secret Mantra practice should obtain Empowerment— || 250 ||
[7051] <tantra> Should recognize the nature of mind.
[7052] <tantra> If Empowerment is not obtained, even a Buddha is unable to turn
[7053] <tantra> the Dharma-wheel on the ground of the Tathāgata—
[7054] <tantra> For one must recognize one's own nature to turn the wheel.
[7055] <tantra> If the wheel is not turned, by the compassion-Nirmāṇakāya, unable to do benefit for beings—
[7056] <tantra> Unable to point others to their nature.
[7057] <tantra> Therefore, the practitioner of Secret Mantra should obtain Empowerment—
[7058] <tantra> Should recognize the Dharmakaya that one is."
[7059] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[7060] <prose> Third, the place where to confer—the place of recognizing mind nature:
[7061] <prose> Secluded, pleasing, and near to siddhi—near to the siddhi of recognition.
[7062] <prose> Here, the general abode—auspicious, with good earth-examination,
[7063] <prose> good forest, and so forth; from four particular abodes:
[7064] <list> The abode of elaboration—if the student's body is earth, protect north from south expanse;
[7065] <list> If water, protect west from east expanse;
[7066] <list> If fire, protect east from west expanse;
[7067] <list> If wind, protect south from north expanse. || 260 ||
[7068] <prose> The abode without elaboration:
[7069] <prose> In dense forest ravines, follow shapes and marks suitable to the student's elements.
[7070] <prose> For extreme non-elaboration, the peak of a mountain where three valleys gather
[7071] <prose> is supreme and good—supreme for recognizing nature.
[7072] <prose> For complete non-elaboration, very secluded place or hermitage,
[7073] <prose> beyond one league from town—beyond the town of conceptual mind.
[7074] <prose> For all four Empowerments, abodes where other beings fear, where wild carnivores reside,
[7075] <list> Poisonous snakes,
[7076] <list> Cemeteries and charnel grounds, and so forth—
[7077] <prose> Places that remind one of impermanence and emptiness.
[7078] <prose> A cemetery abode where very wild, untamed Ḍākinīs reside
[7079] <prose> is supreme and auspicious—supreme for cutting through grasping.
[7080] <prose> Thus also it is spoken: || 270 ||
[7081] <tantra> From the Great Perfection Self-Arisen:
[7082] <tantra> "This supreme Empowerment is shown—in the center of great towns,
[7083] <tantra> The yogi does not accomplish the purpose—the purpose of recognition;
[7084] <tantra> At the end of towns and cities, in forests or empty mountain ravines,
[7085] <tantra> The yogi enters the meaning of Empowerment—enters recognition."
[7086] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[7087] <prose> Also, for very secluded and pleasant place,
[7088] <prose> The characteristics of the abode should be examined:
[7089] <tantra> At the end of wide town valleys,
[7090] <tantra> In places of ripe fruit forests, || 280 ||
[7091] <tantra> Where various flowers arise—like qualities of recognition,
[7092] <tantra> West high, east expanse,
[7093] <tantra> North like a protector,
[7094] <tantra> Abode like south valley,
[7095] <tantra> From self-manifest direction—your own awareness's direction,
[7096] <tantra> Without holes, empty, and vacant—like the nature of mind,
[7097] <tantra> Without forms in front—no object to grasp,
[7098] <tantra> Without being-like forms—no duality,
[7099] <tantra> Back supported by rock—supported by unchanging awareness,
[7100] <tantra> Side where various fruits blaze—fruits of recognition, || 290 ||
[7101] <tantra> Front where clear water flows with sandalwood—pure awareness flowing,
[7102] <tantra> Or abode like food—nourishing recognition,
[7103] <tantra> Mountain ranges all complete, not cut—complete recognition, not partial,
[7104] <tantra> Where various bird voices call—sounds as reminders of emptiness.
[7105] <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[7106] <prose> Fourth, the time when to empower—two aspects:
[7107] <list> Generally shown—the time of gathering conditions,
[7108] <list> Particularly explained—the timeless moment of recognition.
[7109] <prose> First: the auspicious time when dependent origination gathers,
[7110] <prose> granted by the Guru—granted by your own awareness. || 300 ||
