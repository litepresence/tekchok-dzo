[6801] <prose> Through emptying the seeds of the six families within the student,
[6802] <prose> Purifying the six afflictions,
[6803] <prose> The meaning of the six pristine cognitions arises—
[6804] <prose> For that itself possesses such capability.
[6805] <ornament> Moreover, regarding Gurus, there are divisions:
[6806] <prose> Root and branch, two aspects.
[6807] <prose> First, the root Guru:
[6808] <prose> Completing the four defining marks, having established Empowerment as the basis,
[6809] <prose><tantra> Explains the Tantra,
[6810] <prose> Teaches the oral instructions; || 10 ||
[6811] <prose> And now, one practices those oral instructions taught by that Guru.
[6812] <prose> The oral instruction Guru, having established Empowerment as the basis,
[6813] <prose><tantra> Explains the Tantra—possessing two qualifications;
[6814] <prose> If oral instructions are transmitted, becomes the branch Guru possessing three qualifications.
[6815] <prose> Incidentally, the training master to be avoided:
[6816] <prose> <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[6817] <prose> <tantra> "Great ignorance and pride,
[6818] <prose> <tantra> Foolishness, words attached to externals,
[6819] <prose> <tantra> Inattentive to the meaning of Secret Mantra,
[6820] <prose> <tantra> Critical speech of arrogance toward others, || 20 ||
[6821] <prose> <tantra> Entered upon wrong paths,
[6822] <prose> <tantra> Face of the Empowerment Maṇḍala not seen,
[6823] <prose> <tantra> Samaya spread casually,
[6824] <prose> <tantra> Unable to answer questions,
[6825] <prose> <tantra> Little learning, great pride—
[6826] <prose> <tantra> Such a master, unexamined, is the student's demon;
[6827] <prose> <tantra> Not a master who teaches Secret Mantra,
[6828] <prose> <tantra> Unable to teach Great Perfection Atiyoga;
[6829] <prose> <tantra> Do not associate with such."
[6830] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 30 ||
[6831] <prose> Second, the self-nature of the student:
[6832] <prose> Mind turned away from the dharmas of saṃsāra,
[6833] <list> Great devotion and longing toward Guru, Dharma, and companions;
[6834] <list> Faith firm, mind not entering into other than Dharma;
[6835] <list> Desiring the definitive meaning, great generosity and diligence;
[6836] <list> Few attachments, good nature;
[6837] <list> Great wisdom, abiding in Samaya and vows;
[6838] <list> Harmonizing with others' minds, transforming through Dharma;
[6839] <list> Listening to the Guru's speech, not confusing the secret door;
[6840] <list> Great study and contemplation, self-nature tamed; || 40 ||
[6841] <list> Especially possessing devotion to the Guru as Buddha or surpassing that—
[6842] <list> Possessing these ten dharmas,
[6843] <prose> Such is the excellent student of supreme liberation;
[6844] <prose> One who will certainly obtain supreme liberation from saṃsāra quickly.
[6845] <prose> Thus also it is spoken:
[6846] <prose> <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[6847] <prose> <tantra> "Great power of faith and diligence,
[6848] <prose> <tantra> Great wisdom without attachment,
[6849] <prose> <tantra> Great humility, conducting Secret Mantra,
[6850] <prose> <tantra> Mind without conception, not distracted, || 50 ||
[6851] <prose> <tantra> Possessing Samaya, diligent in practice,
[6852] <prose> <tantra> Steady, clear, and longing devotion,
[6853] <prose> <tantra> Lucid and natural in meditation conduct,
[6854] <prose> <tantra> Acting according to the master's teaching,
[6855] <prose> <tantra> Not abandoning Samaya casually,
[6856] <prose> <tantra> Conduct agreeable with others' conduct,
[6857] <prose> <tantra> Mind gentle through respect,
[6858] <prose> <tantra> Following even one word of teaching,
[6859] <prose> <tantra> Conducting thus for one's own benefit,
[6860] <prose> <tantra> Making the secret object of seeking endure, || 60 ||
[6861] <prose> <tantra> Not transgressing from the Vajra meaning,
[6862] <prose> <tantra> Relying upon the person of great learning,
[6863] <prose> <tantra> Not transgressing from one's own benefit,
[6864] <prose> <tantra> Speaking gently without arrogant words,
[6865] <prose> <tantra> Making agreeable entry with others' minds,
[6866] <prose> <tantra> Making Guru and Tathāgata
[6867] <prose> <tantra> Without difference, of one nature—
[6868] <prose> <tantra> That is the student's characteristic.
[6869] <prose> <tantra> Thus possessing such a student
[6870] <prose> <tantra> Is spoken as a vessel of Great Perfection." || 70 ||
[6871] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6872] <prose> Incidentally, the student to be abandoned:
[6873] <prose> <tantra> From that same source:
[6874] <prose> <tantra> "Not performing honor and humility,
[6875] <prose> <tantra> Conducting Secret Mantra carelessly,
[6876] <prose> <tantra> Without family lineage and without natural lineage,
[6877] <prose> <tantra> Having become small in wisdom,
[6878] <prose> <tantra> Disregarding kindness,
[6879] <prose> <tantra> Speaking of one's own family lineage,
[6880] <prose> <tantra> Putting good ornaments upon the body, || 80 ||
[6881] <prose> <tantra> Having become spread without meaning—
[6882] <prose> <tantra> Such a student, unexamined, is the master's enemy;
[6883] <prose> <tantra> To the person who does not take into practice,
[6884] <prose> <tantra> The meaning of Great Perfection is not explained."
[6885] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6886] <prose> Moreover, such a bad vessel cannot hold good essence,
[6887] <prose> Just as lion's milk cannot be held in a clay vessel.
[6888] <ornament> If poured therein, the greatness of Dharma is lost, and
[6889] <prose> Through that bad vessel, one goes to lower realms;
[6890] <prose> To such a bad vessel, it must be kept secret. || 90 ||
[6891] <prose> <tantra> From that same source:
[6892] <prose> <tantra> "The meaning of Great Perfection oral instructions—
[6893] <prose> <tantra> Do not pour into bad vessels generally;
[6894] <prose> <tantra> The essence of some possessing faith,
[6895] <prose> <tantra> If poured into bad vessels,
[6896] <prose> <tantra> Makes both essence and vessel ruined.
[6897] <prose> <tantra> Therefore, keep secret from those of inferior mind."
[6898] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6899] <ornament> Third, regarding the Dharma to be made common, there are three aspects:
[6900] <list> The Dharma that master and student contemplate in common, || 100 ||
[6901] <list> The manner of relying and supplicating,
[6902] <list> The result of definite purpose.
[6903] <ornament> First:
[6904] <prose> That master beholds that student with continuous compassion, timely benefit, care, and Dharma,
[6905] <prose> Even merely with food and drink giving benefit;
[6906] <prose> That student contemplates that Guru's qualities, making longing devotion and faith continuous.
[6907] <prose> <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[6908] <prose> <tantra> "Compassion's connection-rope—how could it be cut?
[6909] <prose> <tantra> Longing, continuous:
[6910] <prose> <tantra> This is the connection of master and student." || 110 ||
[6911] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6912] <ornament> Second:
[6913] <prose> <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[6914] <prose> <tantra> "To those possessing complete characteristics of each,
[6915] <prose> <tantra> Kingdom and one's own body,
[6916] <prose> <tantra> By retinue and possessions serve;
[6917] <prose> <tantra> By pleasing body, speech, and conduct,
[6918] <prose> <tantra> Rely upon the Guru and Buddha united as equal;
[6919] <prose> <tantra> Possessing faith and wisdom,
[6920] <prose> <tantra> Faithful and without delusion, || 120 ||
[6921] <prose> <tantra> Without error in expressed objects,
[6922] <prose> <tantra> By clear faculties, rely upon the Guru."
[6923] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6924] <prose> That student,
[6925] <prose> Possessing aspiration for Empowerment of elaboration and so forth, and
[6926] <prose> Desire to request instructions, does not enter suddenly;
[6927] <prose> Even for common invitation, a former message must first be sent—just so.
[6928] <prose> Therefore, from former times of five, seven, or three years, offering maṇḍalas of accumulations, gold, and so forth to the Guru, when self is of such age,
[6929] <verse> "This Empowerment," or
[6930] <verse> "This instruction," requesting permission by asking— || 130 ||
[6931] <prose> Wherein, supplicating again and again, at the beginning of one's virtue-practice session, contemplating that Guru's yoga day and night, six times, one should make supplication.
[6932] <prose> The Guru also, giving permission: "Son, if you ask for Empowerment, for removing obstacles and purifying sins in that interval, contemplate the Guru upon the crown day and night, six times, obtain supplication"—thus causing supplication to be made.
[6933] <prose> That purpose: ripening the body into the deity-kāya, and
[6934] <prose> Ripening speech into the self-sound of ali and kali, and
[6935] <prose> Ripening mind free from the face of emptiness meditation—
[6936] <prose> Such is the purpose.
[6937] <prose> At that time, through making fierce aspiration, thinking "Whatever Empowerment I desire, I must obtain by any means,"
[6938] <prose> Explaining Dharma in dreams,
[6939] <prose> Prophecy, and so forth—signs of Guru accomplishment definitely arise.
[6940] <prose> Third, the result of definite purpose: || 140 ||
[6941] <prose> Thus, having supplicated before and relied upon the Guru,
[6942] <prose> Whatever is desired all becomes accomplished, arising like a wish-fulfilling jewel and wish-fulfilling tree.
[6943] <prose> <tantra> From the Thalgyur:
[6944] <prose> <tantra> "From relying upon that, qualities—
[6945] <prose> <tantra> Wish-fulfilling tree and wish-fulfilling jewel,
[6946] <prose> <tantra> Like a cow of desires,
[6947] <prose> <tantra> Obtain immeasurable qualities;
[6948] <prose> <tantra> Aiming at that, rely upon the Guru,
[6949] <prose> <tantra> To reverse from saṃsāra's battle."
[6950] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken. || 150 ||
[6951] <prose> Fourth, the activity of Empowerment—how to confer—five aspects:
[6952] <list> The benefit of Empowerment,
[6953] <list> The defect of not being empowered,
[6954] <list> The place where to empower,
[6955] <list> The time when to empower,
[6956] <list> The sequence of celebration.
[6957] <ornament> First:
[6958] <prose> <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[6959] <prose> <tantra> "Qualities, particularly these:
[6960] <prose> <tantra> Great jñāna-appearance, || 160 ||
[6961] <prose> <tantra> Becoming without obstacles,
[6962] <prose> <tantra> Self-appearance shown as helper,
[6963] <prose> <tantra> Becoming one who performs all actions."
[6964] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6965] <prose> <tantra> From the Jewel Empowerment Tantra:
[6966] <prose> <tantra> "By abandoning the Guru's desire,
[6967] <prose> <tantra> If the Empowerment ritual is completed,
[6968] <prose> <tantra> By the sequence of how Empowerment is conferred,
[6969] <prose> <tantra> Even great Vajradhara
[6970] <prose> <tantra> Definitely becomes in this life." || 170 ||
[6971] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6972] <prose> <tantra> From the Secret Essence:
[6973] <prose> <tantra> "If empowered by five essences,
[6974] <prose> <tantra> After this time, Buddha's son,
[6975] <prose> <tantra> All lower realms not,
[6976] <prose> <tantra> Becomes master of higher liberation."
[6977] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[6978] <prose> Also from the Self-Arisen:
[6979] <prose> <tantra> "Benefits of Empowerment are like this:
[6980] <prose> <tantra> In the intermediate state, self-appearance will be recognized; || 180 ||
[6981] <prose> <tantra> Having recognized, stability in that itself is obtained,
[6982] <prose> <tantra> Able to dissolve the Nirmāṇakāya in twenty-one days.
[6983] <prose> <tantra> Even one of excellent faculties, suffering and fear do not come.
[6984] <prose> <tantra> At the time of practice also, jñāna-appearance clearly does not cease.
[6985] <prose> <tantra> That is called 'special quality.'
[6986] <prose> <tantra> Common qualities are obtained like this:
[6987] <prose> <tantra> Knowing the Ḍākinī's voice, and
[6988] <prose> <tantra> Making the Ḍākinī's blessing, and
[6989] <prose> <tantra> Being seen as worthy of honor by humans through blessing, and
[6990] <prose> <tantra> Loving-kindness toward all beings, and || 190 ||
[6991] <prose> <tantra> Beautiful form, lovely to see, and
[6992] <prose> <tantra> Great merit increasing, and
[6993] <prose> <tantra> Even after death, birth in the body of a Cakravartin king, and
[6994] <prose> <tantra> Great qualities arising like a precious jewel, and
[6995] <prose> <tantra> Conducting pure Dharma like a lotus, and
[6996] <prose> <tantra> Being seen as worthy of being surrounded by all like a Stūpa, and
[6997] <prose> <tantra> Overpowering common beings like a parasol, and
[6998] <prose> <tantra> Able to liberate beings by wisdom like a mass of fire, and
[6999] <prose> <tantra> Able to do benefit like a sword, and
[7000] <prose> <tantra> Able to hold beings with compassion like a Vajra hook, and || 200 ||
[7001] <prose> Wherein, <tantra> Realizing the meaning of Dharmadhātu and jñāna without gathering and separation like a Dharma cloud;
[7002] <prose> <tantra> Performing all outer and inner actions.
[7003] <prose> <tantra> From these and so forth, one hundred eight qualities are obtained.
[7004] <prose> <tantra> By that, whatever actions are done, all are accomplished.
[7005] <prose> <tantra> By that, not harmed by obstacles and wrong-leadings.
[7006] <prose> <tantra> Many children and great enjoyment are signs of obtained Empowerment.
[7007] <prose> <tantra> Former and later lifetimes are remembered.
[7008] <prose> <tantra> Beings taking birth are also seen.
[7009] <prose> <tantra> Others' minds are known.
[7010] <prose> <tantra> Associates with non-humans. || 210 ||
[7011] <prose> <tantra> From these and so forth, one hundred eight qualities are obtained."
[7012] <prose> Second, the defect of not being empowered:
[7013] <prose> <tantra> From the Magical Display Secret Essence:
[7014] <prose> <tantra> "Not pleasing the master,
[7015] <prose> <tantra> Not obtaining Empowerments,
[7016] <prose> <tantra> Beginning to listen and so forth,
[7017] <prose> <tantra> Becomes without result and ruined."
[7018] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[7019] <prose> <tantra> From the Great Self-Arisen Empowerment Tantra:
[7020] <prose> <tantra> "Not relying upon Secret Mantra Empowerment, does not accomplish; || 220 ||
[7021] <prose> <tantra> Like a ferryman without hands,
[7022] <prose> <tantra> Unable to cross to the other shore of the river."
[7023] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[7024] <prose> <tantra> From the Self-Arisen:
[7025] <prose> <tantra> "The defect of not obtaining Empowerment is like this:
[7026] <prose> <tantra> Fainting in the intermediate state,
[7027] <prose> <tantra> Fear,
[7028] <prose> <tantra> Suffocation,
[7029] <prose> <tantra> Obstacles,
[7030] <prose> <tantra> And losing perception arise. || 230 ||
[7031] <prose> Consequently, <tantra> Even until not abandoning the body of latent tendencies, not being seen as worthy of honor by beings,
[7032] <prose> <tantra> Little merit,
[7033] <prose> <tantra> Short life,
[7034] <prose> <tantra> Few enjoyments of livelihood,
[7035] <prose> <tantra> Close mouth,
[7036] <prose> <tantra> Many obstacles arise;
[7037] <prose> <tantra> All actions are not accomplished.
[7038] <prose> <tantra> That is the defect of not obtaining Empowerment for Secret Mantra practice.
[7039] <prose> <tantra> The yogi of Secret Mantra practice should obtain Empowerment.
[7040] <prose> <tantra> If Empowerment is not obtained, even a Buddha is unable to turn the Dharma-wheel on the ground of the Tathāgata. || 240 ||
[7041] <prose> Moreover, <tantra> If the wheel is not turned, by the compassion-Nirmāṇakāya, unable to do benefit for beings.
[7042] <prose> <tantra> Therefore, the practitioner of Secret Mantra should obtain Empowerment."
[7043] <prose> Third, the place where to confer:
[7044] <prose> Secluded, pleasing, and near to siddhi.
[7045] <prose> Here, the general abode—auspicious, with good earth-examination, good forest, and so forth;
[7046] <prose><tantra> From four particular abodes:
[7047] <list> The abode of elaboration—if the student's body is earth, protect north from south expanse;
[7048] <list> If water, protect west from east expanse;
[7049] <list> If fire, protect east from west expanse;
[7050] <list> If wind, protect south from north expanse. || 250 ||
[7051] <prose> The abode without elaboration:
[7052] <prose> In dense forest ravines, follow shapes and marks suitable to the student's elements.
[7053] <prose> For extreme non-elaboration, the peak of a mountain where three valleys gather is supreme and good.
[7054] <prose> For complete non-elaboration, very secluded place or hermitage, beyond one league from town.
[7055] <prose> For all four Empowerments, abodes where other beings fear, where wild carnivores reside,
[7056] <list> Poisonous snakes,
[7057] <list> Cemeteries and charnel grounds, and so forth.
[7058] <prose> A cemetery abode where very wild, untamed Ḍākinīs reside is supreme and auspicious.
[7059] <prose> Thus also it is spoken:
[7060] <prose> <tantra> From the Great Perfection Self-Arisen: || 260 ||
[7061] <prose> <tantra> "This supreme Empowerment is shown—
[7062] <prose> <tantra> In the center of great towns,
[7063] <prose> <tantra> The yogi does not accomplish the purpose;
[7064] <prose> <tantra> At the end of towns and cities,
[7065] <prose> <tantra> In forests or empty mountain ravines,
[7066] <prose> <tantra> The yogi enters the meaning of Empowerment."
[7067] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[7068] <prose> Also, for very secluded and pleasant place,
[7069] <prose> The characteristics of the abode should be examined:
[7070] <prose> <tantra> At the end of wide town valleys, || 270 ||
[7071] <prose> <tantra> In places of ripe fruit forests,
[7072] <prose> <tantra> Where various flowers arise,
[7073] <prose> <tantra> West high, east expanse,
[7074] <prose> <tantra> North like a protector,
[7075] <prose> <tantra> Abode like south valley,
[7076] <prose> <tantra> From self-manifest direction,
[7077] <prose> <tantra> Without holes, empty, and vacant,
[7078] <prose> <tantra> Without forms in front,
[7079] <prose> <tantra> Without being-like forms,
[7080] <prose> <tantra> Back supported by rock, || 280 ||
[7081] <prose> <tantra> Side where various fruits blaze,
[7082] <prose> <tantra> Front where clear water flows with sandalwood,
[7083] <prose> <tantra> Or abode like food,
[7084] <prose> <tantra> Mountain ranges all complete, not cut,
[7085] <prose> <tantra> Where various bird voices call.
[7086] <prose> <tantra> Thus it is spoken.
[7087] <prose> Fourth, the time when to empower—two aspects:
[7088] <list> Generally shown,
[7089] <list> Particularly explained.
[7090] <ornament> First: the auspicious time when dependent origination gathers, granted by the Guru; || 290 ||
[7091] <prose> However, the special time:
[7092] <prose> Autumn—ripening the fruit of awakening,
[7093] <prose> Shown as planting the seed of liberation in spring.
[7094] <prose> The year of the monkey is auspicious.
[7095] <prose> The eighth of the waxing moon is good;
[7096] <prose> The star is supreme;
[7097] <prose> The planet Jupiter is good.
[7098] <prose> Second, from four aspects:
