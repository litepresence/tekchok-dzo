[6801] Having emptied the seeds of the student's six families,
[6802] Purifying the six afflictions,
[6803] The meaning of the six wisdoms arises,
[6804] For that itself possesses that capability.
[6805] Also, dividing the guru, there are root and
[6806] Branch, two from:
[6807] First, the root guru:
[6808] Completing four characteristics, having established empowerment as the basis,
[6809] Explains the tantra,
[6810] Shows oral instructions,
[6811] Now also practices the oral instructions shown by that guru.
[6812] The oral instruction guru, having established empowerment as the basis,
[6813] Explains the tantra, possessing two;
[6814] If oral instructions are transmitted, becomes the branch guru possessing three.
[6815] Incidentally, the master who trains:
[6816] From the Rangshar:
[6817] "Great ignorance and pride,
[6818] Foolish words attached outward,
[6819] Not mindful of secret mantra's meaning,
[6820] Arrogant speech criticizing others,
[6821] Entered wrong path,
[6822] Face of empowerment's maṇḍala not seen,
[6823] Samaya spread,
[6824] Unable to answer questions,
[6825] Little learning, great pride—
[6826] The student's demon, master not examined,
[6827] Not a secret mantra teaching master,
[6828] Cannot teach Great Perfection Ati;
[6829] Do not associate with that."
[6830] Thus it is spoken.
[6831] Second, the student's self-nature:
[6832] Mind reversed from saṃsāra's dharmas,
[6833] Great devotion and longing-mind toward guru, Dharma, and companions,
[6834] Faith firm, mind not entering other than Dharma,
[6835] Desiring the definitive meaning, great giving-capability and diligence,
[6836] Few attachments, good nature,
[6837] Great wisdom, abiding in samaya and vows,
[6838] Accord with others' minds, transforming through Dharma,
[6839] Listening to guru's speech, not confusing the secret door,
[6840] Great study and contemplation, self-nature tamed,
[6841] Especially possessing devotion to guru as Buddha or surpassing that,
[6842] Possessing ten dharmas,
[6843] A good student of supreme liberation,
[6844] Definitely obtaining supreme liberation from saṃsāra quickly.
[6845] Thus also:


### PAGE 172

[6846] From the Rangshar:
[6847] "Great power of faith and diligence,
[6848] Great wisdom and without attachment,
[6849] Great humility and secret mantra conduct,
[6850] Mind without concept, not distracted,
[6851] Possessing samaya, diligent in practice,
[6852] Possessing steady, clear, longing devotion,
[6853] Conducting meditation lucid and natural,
[6854] Conducting as the guru spoke,
[6855] Not abandoning samaya casually,
[6856] Conduct agreeable with others' conduct,
[6857] Mind gentle through manner of respect,
[6858] Following and holding even one word of teaching,
[6859] Conducting thus for one's own benefit,
[6860] Making the secret-seeking place endure,
[6861] Not transgressing from the vajra's meaning,
[6862] Relying on the person of great learning,
[6863] Not transgressing from one's own benefit,
[6864] Speaking gently without arrogant words,
[6865] Making agreeable entry with others' minds,
[6866] Making guru and Tathāgata
[6867] Without difference, of one manner—
[6868] That is the student's characteristic.
[6869] Thus possessing student
[6870] Is spoken as a vessel of Great Perfection."
[6871] Thus it is spoken.
[6872] Incidentally, the student to be abandoned:
[6873] From that itself:
[6874] "Not doing honor and humility,
[6875] Conducting secret mantra carelessly,
[6876] Without family lineage and without natural lineage,
[6877] Having become small in wisdom,
[6878] Disregarding kindness,
[6879] Speaking one's own family lineage,
[6880] Putting good ornaments on the body,
[6881] Having become spread without meaning,
[6882] Master's enemy, student not examined,
[6883] To person not taking into practice,
[6884] The meaning of Great Perfection not explained."
[6885] Thus it is spoken.
[6886] Also, that bad vessel cannot hold good content,
[6887] Like lion's milk cannot be held in a clay vessel.
[6888] If poured, the greatness of Dharma is lost, and
[6889] From that bad vessel, that one goes to lower realms;
[6890] To such bad vessel, it must be secret.
[6891] From that itself:
[6892] "The meaning of Great Perfection oral instructions,
[6893] Do not pour generally into bad vessel;
[6894] The essence of some possessing faith,
[6895] If poured into bad vessel,
[6896] Makes both content and vessel ruined.
[6897] Therefore, secret to those of inferior mind."
[6898] Thus it is spoken.
[6899] Third, the Dharma to be made common, three:


### PAGE 173

[6900] Dharma for master and student to contemplate in common,
[6901] The manner of relying and making supplication,
[6902] The result of definite purpose.
[6903] First:
[6904] That master, seeing that student with steady compassion, timely benefit, care, Dharma,
[6905] Even merely with food and drink giving benefit,
[6906] That student, contemplating that guru's qualities, making continuous longing devotion.
[6907] From the Rangshar:
[6908] "Compassion's connection rope, not cut—how?
[6909] Longing, continuous,
[6910] Is the connection of guru and student."
[6911] Thus it is spoken.
[6912] Second:
[6913] From the Thalgyur:
[6914] "To complete characteristics of each,
[6915] Kingdom and own body,
[6916] By retinue and possessions serve,
[6917] By pleasing body, speech, and conduct,
[6918] Rely on guru and Buddha equal in union;
[6919] Possessing faith and wisdom,
[6920] Faithful and without delusion,
[6921] Without error in expressed objects,
[6922] By clear faculties, rely on guru."
[6923] Thus it is spoken.
[6924] That student,
[6925] Possessing aspiration for empowerment of elaborations, etc., and
[6926] To request instructions, is not entering suddenly;
[6927] Even for common invitation, a former message must be sent.
[6928] Therefore, from former times of five, seven, or three years, offering maṇḍalas of accumulations, gold, etc., to the guru, when self is this age,
[6929] "This empowerment," or
[6930] "This instruction," requesting permission by asking, supplicating again and again,
[6931] At the beginning of one's own virtue-practice session, contemplating that guru's yoga day and night, six times, should make supplication.
[6932] The guru also: "Son, if you ask for empowerment, for removing obstacles and purifying sins in that interval, contemplating the guru on the crown, day and night, six times, obtain supplication"—giving permission, causes to make supplication.
[6933] That purpose: ripening the body into deity-kāya, and
[6934] 


### PAGE 174

[6935] Ripening speech into the self-sound of ali and kali, and
[6936] There is the purpose of ripening mind free from emptiness meditation-face.
[6937] At that time, by making fierce aspiration, thinking "Whatever empowerment I desire, etc., I must obtain,"
[6938] Explaining Dharma in dreams,
[6939] Prophecy, etc.—signs of guru accomplishment definitely arise.
[6940] Third, the result of definite purpose:
[6941] Thus, having supplicated before and relied on the guru,
[6942] Whatever is desired all accomplished, arising like a wish-fulfilling jewel and wish-fulfilling tree.
[6943] From the Thalgyur:
[6944] "From relying on that, qualities—
[6945] Wish-fulfilling tree and wish-fulfilling jewel,
[6946] Like a cow of desires,
[6947] Obtain immeasurable qualities;
[6948] Aiming at that, rely on the guru,
[6949] To reverse from saṃsāra's battle."
[6950] Thus it is spoken.
[6951] Fourth, the activity of empowerment, how to confer, five:
[6952] Benefit of empowerment,
[6953] Defect of not being empowered,
[6954] Place where to empower,
[6955] Time when to empower,
[6956] Sequence of making celebration.
[6957] First:
[6958] From the Rangshar:
[6959] "Qualities, particularly these:
[6960] Great wisdom appearance,
[6961] Becoming without obstacles,
[6962] Self-appearance shown as helper,
[6963] Becoming doing all actions."
[6964] Thus it is spoken.
[6965] From the Empowerment Jewel Tantra:
[6966] "By abandoning guru's desire,
[6967] If empowerment ritual is completed,
[6968] By the sequence of how empowerment is conferred,
[6969] Even great Vajradhara,
[6970] Definitely becomes in this life."
[6971] Thus it is spoken.
[6972] From the Secret Essence:
[6973] "If empowered by five essences,
[6974] After this time, Buddha's son,
[6975] All lower realms not,
[6976] Becomes master of higher liberation."
[6977] Thus it is spoken.
[6978] Also from the Rangshar:
[6979] "Benefits of empowerment are like this:
[6980] In the intermediate state, self-appearance will be recognized;
[6981] Having recognized, also obtains stability in that itself,
[6982] Able to dissolve the emanation-kāya in twenty-one days.
[6983] Even one of excellent faculty completion, suffering, fear, etc., do not come.
[6984] At the time of practice also, wisdom appearance clearly does not cease.
[6985] That is called 'special quality.'
[6986] Common qualities are obtained like this:
[6987] Knowing the ḍākinī's voice, and


### PAGE 175

[6988] Making the ḍākinī's blessing, and
[6989] Being seen as a place of honor by humans through blessing, and
[6990] Loving-kindness toward all beings, and
[6991] Beautiful form, lovely to see, and
[6992] Great merit increasing, and
[6993] Even after death, birth in the body of a cakravartin king, and
[6994] Great qualities arising like a precious jewel, and
[6995] Conducting pure Dharma like a lotus, and
[6996] Being seen as worthy of being surrounded by all like a stūpa, and
[6997] Overpowering common beings like a parasol, and
[6998] Able to liberate beings by wisdom like a mass of fire, and
[6999] Able to do benefit like a sword, and
[7000] Able to hold beings with compassion like a vajra hook, and
[7001] Realizing the meaning of sphere and wisdom without gathering and separation like a Dharma cloud;
[7002] Doing all outer and inner actions.
[7003] From those, etc., one hundred eight qualities are obtained.
[7004] By that, whatever actions are done, all are obtained.
[7005] By that, not harmed by obstacles and wrong-leadings.
[7006] Many children and great enjoyment are signs of obtained empowerment.
[7007] Former and later lifetimes are remembered.
[7008] Beings taking birth are also seen.
[7009] Others' minds are known.
[7010] Associates with non-humans.
[7011] From those, etc., one hundred eight qualities are obtained.
[7012] Second, the defect of not being empowered:
[7013] From the Magical Display Secret Essence:
[7014] "Not pleasing the master,
[7015] Not obtaining empowerments,
[7016] Beginning to listen, etc.,
[7017] Becomes without result and ruined."
[7018] Thus it is spoken.
[7019] From the Empowerment Complete Self-arisen Great Tantra:
[7020] "Not relying on secret mantra empowerment, does not accomplish;
[7021] Like a ferryman without hands,
[7022] Unable to cross to the other shore of the river."
[7023] Thus it is spoken.


### PAGE 176

[7024] From the Rangshar:
[7025] "The defect of not obtaining empowerment is like this:
[7026] Fainting in the intermediate state,
[7027] Fear,
[7028] Suffocation,
[7029] Obstacles,
[7030] And losing perception arise.
[7031] Even until not abandoning the body of latent tendencies, not being seen as worthy of honor by beings,
[7032] Little merit,
[7033] Short life,
[7034] Few enjoyments of livelihood,
[7035] Close mouth,
[7036] Many obstacles arise;
[7037] All actions are not accomplished.
[7038] That is the defect of not obtaining empowerment for secret mantra practice.
[7039] The yogi of secret mantra practice should obtain empowerment.
[7040] If empowerment is not obtained, even a Buddha is unable to turn the Dharma wheel on the ground of the Tathāgata.
[7041] If the wheel is not turned, by the compassion-emanation-kāya, unable to do benefit for beings.
[7042] Therefore, the practitioner of secret mantra should obtain empowerment."
[7043] Third, the place where to confer:
[7044] Secluded, pleasing, and near to siddhi.
[7045] Here, general abode—auspicious, with good earth examination, good forest, etc.;
[7046] From four particular abodes:
[7047] The abode of elaborations—if the student's body is earth, protect north from south expanse.
[7048] If water, protect west from east expanse.
[7049] If fire, protect east from west expanse.
[7050] If wind, protect south from north expanse.
[7051] The abode without elaboration:
[7052] In dense forest ravines, follow shapes and marks suitable to the student's elements.
[7053] For extreme without elaboration, the peak of a mountain where three valleys gather is supreme good.
[7054] For complete without elaboration, very secluded or hermitage, beyond one league from town.
[7055] For all four empowerments, abodes where other beings fear, wild carnivores reside,
[7056] Poisonous snakes,
[7057] Cemeteries and charnel grounds, etc.


### PAGE 177

[7058] A cemetery abode where very wild, untamed ḍākinīs reside is supreme auspicious.
[7059] Thus also:
[7060] From the Great Perfection Self-arisen:
[7061] "This supreme empowerment is shown—
[7062] In the center of great towns,
[7063] The yogi does not accomplish the purpose;
[7064] At the end of towns and cities,
[7065] In forests or empty mountain ravines,
[7066] The yogi enters the meaning of empowerment."
[7067] Thus it is spoken.
[7068] Also, for very secluded and pleasant,
[7069] The characteristics of the abode should be examined:
[7070] At the end of wide town valleys,
[7071] In places of ripe fruit forests,
[7072] Where various flowers arise,
[7073] West high, east expanse,
[7074] North like a protector,
[7075] Abode like south valley,
[7076] From self-manifest direction,
[7077] Without holes, empty, and vacant,
[7078] Without forms in front,
[7079] Without being-like forms,
[7080] Back supported by rock,
[7081] Side where various fruits blaze,
[7082] Front where clear water flows with sandalwood,
[7083] Or abode like food,
[7084] Mountain ranges all complete, not cut,
[7085] Where various bird voices call.
[7086] Thus it is spoken.
[7087] Fourth, the time when to empower, two:
[7088] Generally shown,
[7089] Particularly explained.
[7090] First: the auspicious time of gathered dependent origination, granted by the guru;
[7091] However, the special time:
[7092] Autumn, ripening the fruit of awakening,
[7093] Shown as planting the seed of liberation in spring.
[7094] The year of the monkey is auspicious.
[7095] The eighth of the waxing moon is good;
[7096] The star is supreme;
[7097] The planet Jupiter is good.
[7098] Second, from four:
