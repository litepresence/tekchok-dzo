[4916] <prose>First, regarding the direct perception of Dharmata: experience increasing above, awareness measure-arriving, extensively explain dharmata-exhausting vision.
[4917] <prose>Two aspects: general direct connection place, identify self-characteristic.
[4918] <prose>First, general direct—conventional term famous direct, and ultimate dhātu-meeting direct—two from.
[4919] <prose>First: sense-power direct—form and so forth, five objects, vision nature; and mind direct—object near enjoyment, cause certain, conceptuality's object within vision; and self-awareness direct—within pleasure, pain, and so forth, experience called vision; and yogin's direct itself—meaning near meeting, actual point entering, particular correct awareness and that vision-object non-dual state, grasp-hold-separate experience certainty. || 10 ||
[4920] <prose><tantra>From Clear-Meaning:
[4921] <verse>Gathering mind from all,
[4922] <verse>Inner self unmoving,
[4923] <verse>Though abide, eye forms—
[4924] <verse>Seeing mind is sense-born.
[4925] <verse>Thus explained, like so.
[4926] <prose>Ultimate dhātu-meeting direct—awareness essence dharmatā existing in heart, determine;
[4927] <prose>that self-resonance, heart-to-eye connect cause, like sun and light-ray, certain cause-effect, reasoning faith meeting.
[4928] <prose>That reason: from world and transcend two, this is transcend direct.
[4929] <prose>Transcend: object-know mind chief, mind cause certain, || 20 ||
[4930] <prose>and main-point seal see chief, awareness direct—two from,
[4931] <prose>this called awareness direct.
[4932] <prose>Second: identify self-characteristic, called dharmatā direct vision.
[4933] <prose>Apply dharmatā word near, four from:
[4934] <list>—Samsāra dharmas,
[4935] <list>called this dharmatā nirvāṇa dharmatā;
[4936] <list>—Vision dharmas,
[4937] <list>called this dharmatā empty; || 30 ||
[4938] <list>—dharmas not liberating from non-existing main-point,
[4939] <list>famous dharmatā this dharmatā existing liberating certain;
[4940] <list>—dhātu dharmas,
[4941] <list>awareness dharmatā famous, desire non-dual both.
[4942] <prose>Direct: actually see existing in sense-power activity field; that also: not rely on intellect—
[4943] <prose>intellect wisdom, whatever seek, time not existing to find;
[4944] <prose>seeker not eye-possess,
[4945] <prose>cause not luminous-clear form-possess. || 40 ||
[4946] <prose><tantra>From Collection:
[4947] <verse>Investigate wisdom, aggregates' bottom not find.
[4948] <verse>Thus it was said.
[4949] <prose>This luminous-clear vision, term-famous, not form-possess—subtle particle and coarse entity, self-characteristic this not existing cause, element-four harm, destroy, crush not possible cause;
[4950] <prose>form-possess: existing destroy crush possible, that cause form's characteristic.
[4951] <prose>Three enumeration: outer body, speech, mind three, establish base with main-point three.
[4952] <list>—Inner: dharmatā field main-point;
[4953] <list>—dawn cause: gate main-point;
[4954] <list>—wind abiding: three main-points clear path,
[4955] <list>—secret: habituation measure sequence, || 50 ||
[4956] <list>—ripen: sign sequence,
[4957] <list>—ultimate end: exhaust sequence,
[4958] <list>and take measure with three,
[4959] <prose>supreme vision.
[4960] <prose>Ripen: point; complete: body and three fruit complete cause;
[4961] <prose>three group: four determine, therefore called three.
[4962] <prose>Or: dharmatā three-bodies spontaneous-completion existing, self-resonance vision three, outer dawn number;
[4963] <list>—dharmakāya self-resonance: inner experience awareness-empty;
[4964] <list>—saṃbhogakāya self-resonance: light five outer clear, wisdom self-clear;
[4965] <list>—nirmāṇakāya self-resonance: dawn liberation, equal limitless discriminating-awareness potency with three, || 60 ||
[4966] <prose>rely therefore called three.
[4967] <prose>That also: base three establish base, entity not-existing difference main-point,
[4968] <prose>and path three clear obstacle, path not-existing near far,
[4969] <prose>and measure three deliver measure, not-existing similar different random,
[4970] <prose>and fruit three exhaust end deliver, not-existing yes-no doubt,
[4971] <prose>therefore called direct.
[4972] <prose>Ordinary time: see three—pleasure, displeasure, equanimity, dawn three—pleasure, pain, middle;
[4973] <prose>Guru instruction experience take time: direct see three—dhātu, awareness, dharmas. || 70 ||
[4974] <prose>Dharmatā direct: main-point not-existing add intellect word;
[4975] <prose>habituation time: main-point self-cease delusion vision, see three-bodies' light point;
[4976] <prose>measure arrive time: direct see three—clear, empty, pleasure; main-point: dharmatā self-exhaust.
[4977] <prose>Thus: three enumeration place other rely, determine simultaneous liberate fruit.
[4978] <prose>Vision: whatever dawn, dharmatā dawn; field: whatever dawn, dhātu dawn; manner: whatever dawn, light, light-house, awareness hanging-cord with dawn.
[4979] <prose>Buddha: not-seeing with stone, fruit: take that vision experience.
[4980] <prose>Thus: dharmatā direct vision essence—dhātu awareness luminous-clear vision.
[4981] <prose><tantra>From Letterless:
[4982] <verse>Direct buddhas without birth, || 80 ||
[4983] <verse>see vision pure without field.

[4997] <verse>Dharmatā direct main-point not existing—
[4998] <verse>similar to going to precipice without eye.
[4999] <verse>Thus it was said.
[5000] <prose>Main-point from Thalgyur:
[5001] <verse>Main-point: arrow not moving;
[5002] <verse>apply three gaze manners this time. || 100 ||
[5003] <verse>Thus said, and:

[5008] <verse>Thus it was said.
[5009] <prose>Vision is:
[5010] <prose><tantra>From Thalgyur:
[5011] <verse>Dharmatā direct vision is;
[5012] <verse>certain emerge from sense-power gate; || 110 ||

[5021] <verse>fully clear in hanging-cord,
[5022] <verse>that also: go and come,
[5023] <verse>move and shake.
[5024] <verse>Thus said, and:
[5025] <prose><tantra>From Lion Power Complete:
[5026] <verse>That entity of self-vision awareness
[5027] <verse>abides in wisdom hanging-cord.
[5028] <verse>Thus said, and:
[5029] <prose><tantra>From Jewel Display:
[5030] <verse>Said: arrow, water lamp—fully perfect buddha,
[5031] <verse>awareness hanging-cord body fully clear.
[5032] <prose>Manner of taking experience: first short session number many do,
[5033] <prose>second extend session extend duration, third without day-night take experience,
[5034] <prose>make not move, place awareness in dhātu fence.
