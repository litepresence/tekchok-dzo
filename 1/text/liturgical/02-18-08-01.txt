[4916] <prose>First, regarding the direct perception of Dharmata: experience increasing above, awareness measure-arriving, extensively explain dharmata-exhausting vision.</prose>
[4917] <prose>Two aspects: general direct connection place, identify self-characteristic.</prose>
[4918] <prose>First, general direct—conventional term famous direct, and ultimate dhātu-meeting direct—two from.</prose>
[4919] <prose>First: sense-power direct—form and so forth, five objects, vision nature; and mind direct—object near enjoyment, cause certain, conceptuality's object within vision; and self-awareness direct—within pleasure, pain, and so forth, experience called vision; and yogin's direct itself—meaning near meeting, actual point entering, particular correct awareness and that vision-object non-dual state, grasp-hold-separate experience certainty.</prose> || 10 ||
[4920] <tantra>From Clear-Meaning:</tantra>
[4921] <verse>Gathering mind from all,</verse>
[4922] <verse>Inner self unmoving,</verse>
[4923] <verse>Though abide, eye forms—</verse>
[4924] <verse>Seeing mind is sense-born.</verse>
[4925] <verse>Thus explained, like so.</verse>
[4926] <prose>Ultimate dhātu-meeting direct—awareness essence dharmatā existing in heart, determine;</prose>
[4927] <prose>that self-resonance, heart-to-eye connect cause, like sun and light-ray, certain cause-effect, reasoning faith meeting.</prose>
[4928] <prose>That reason: from world and transcend two, this is transcend direct.</prose>
[4929] <prose>Transcend: object-know mind chief, mind cause certain,</prose> || 20 ||
[4930] <prose>and main-point seal see chief, awareness direct—two from,</prose>
[4931] <prose>this called awareness direct.</prose>
[4932] <prose>Second: identify self-characteristic, called dharmatā direct vision.</prose>
[4933] <prose>Apply dharmatā word near, four from:</prose>
[4934] <list>—Samsāra dharmas,</list>
[4935] <list>called this dharmatā nirvāṇa dharmatā;</list>
[4936] <list>—Vision dharmas,</list>
[4937] <list>called this dharmatā empty;</list> || 30 ||
[4938] <list>—dharmas not liberating from non-existing main-point,</list>
[4939] <list>famous dharmatā this dharmatā existing liberating certain;</list>
[4940] <list>—dhātu dharmas,</list>
[4941] <list>awareness dharmatā famous, desire non-dual both.</list>
[4942] <prose>Direct: actually see existing in sense-power activity field; that also: not rely on intellect—</prose>
[4943] <prose>intellect wisdom, whatever seek, time not existing to find;</prose>
[4944] <prose>seeker not eye-possess,</prose>
[4945] <prose>cause not luminous-clear form-possess.</prose> || 40 ||
[4946] <tantra>From Collection:</tantra>
[4947] <verse>Investigate wisdom, aggregates' bottom not find.</verse>
[4948] <verse>Thus it was said.</verse>
[4949] <prose>This luminous-clear vision, term-famous, not form-possess—subtle particle and coarse entity, self-characteristic this not existing cause, element-four harm, destroy, crush not possible cause;</prose>
[4950] <prose>form-possess: existing destroy crush possible, that cause form's characteristic.</prose>
[4951] <prose>Three enumeration: outer body, speech, mind three, establish base with main-point three.</prose>
[4952] <list>—Inner: dharmatā field main-point;</list>
[4953] <list>—dawn cause: gate main-point;</list>
[4954] <list>—wind abiding: three main-points clear path,</list>
[4955] <list>—secret: habituation measure sequence,</list> || 50 ||
[4956] <list>—ripen: sign sequence,</list>
[4957] <list>—ultimate end: exhaust sequence,</list>
[4958] <list>and take measure with three,</list>
[4959] <prose>supreme vision.</prose>
[4960] <prose>Ripen: point; complete: body and three fruit complete cause;</prose>
[4961] <prose>three group: four determine, therefore called three.</prose>
[4962] <prose>Or: dharmatā three-bodies spontaneous-completion existing, self-resonance vision three, outer dawn number;</prose>
[4963] <list>—dharmakāya self-resonance: inner experience awareness-empty;</list>
[4964] <list>—saṃbhogakāya self-resonance: light five outer clear, wisdom self-clear;</list>
[4965] <list>—nirmāṇakāya self-resonance: dawn liberation, equal limitless discriminating-awareness potency with three,</list> || 60 ||
[4966] <prose>rely therefore called three.</prose>
[4967] <prose>That also: base three establish base, entity not-existing difference main-point,</prose>
[4968] <prose>and path three clear obstacle, path not-existing near far,</prose>
[4969] <prose>and measure three deliver measure, not-existing similar different random,</prose>
[4970] <prose>and fruit three exhaust end deliver, not-existing yes-no doubt,</prose>
[4971] <prose>therefore called direct.</prose>
[4972] <prose>Ordinary time: see three—pleasure, displeasure, equanimity, dawn three—pleasure, pain, middle;</prose>
[4973] <prose>Guru instruction experience take time: direct see three—dhātu, awareness, dharmas.</prose> || 70 ||
[4974] <prose>Dharmatā direct: main-point not-existing add intellect word;</prose>
[4975] <prose>habituation time: main-point self-cease delusion vision, see three-bodies' light point;</prose>
[4976] <prose>measure arrive time: direct see three—clear, empty, pleasure; main-point: dharmatā self-exhaust.</prose>
[4977] <prose>Thus: three enumeration place other rely, determine simultaneous liberate fruit.</prose>
[4978] <prose>Vision: whatever dawn, dharmatā dawn; field: whatever dawn, dhātu dawn; manner: whatever dawn, light, light-house, awareness hanging-cord with dawn.</prose>
[4979] <prose>Buddha: not-seeing with stone, fruit: take that vision experience.</prose>
[4980] <prose>Thus: dharmatā direct vision essence—dhātu awareness luminous-clear vision.</prose>
