[4916] Dharmata direct,
[4917] Experience increasing above,
[4918] Awareness measure-arriving,
[4919] Extensively explain dharmata-exhausting vision.  First, two are:  General direct connection place,  Identify self-characteristic.  First: general direct—conventional term famous direct,  And ultimate dhatu-meeting direct—two from;  First: sense-power direct—form etcetera, object five, vision nature,  And mind direct—object near enjoy, cause certain, conceptuality object in vision,  And self-awareness direct—within pleasure pain etcetera experience called vision,  And yogin's direct itself—meaning near meet, actual point enter,  Particular correct awareness and that vision-object non-dual state,  Grasp-hold-separate experience certainty.

[4920] From Clear-Meaning:
[4921] Gathering mind from all,
[4922] Inner self unmoving,
[4923] Though abide, eye forms—
[4924] Seeing mind is sense-born.
[4925] Thus explained, like:
[4926] Ultimate dhatu-meeting direct—
[4927] Awareness essence dharmata
[4928] Existing in heart, determine;
[4929] That self-resonance, heart-to-eye connect cause,
[4930] Like sun and light-ray,
[4931] Certain cause-effect, reasoning faith meet.
[4932] That reason: from world and transcend two,
[4933] This is transcend direct.
[4934] Transcend: object-know mind chief,
[4935] Mind cause certain,
[4936] And main-point seal see chief,
[4937] Awareness direct—two from,
[4938] This called awareness direct.
[4939] Second: identify self-characteristic,
[4940] Called dharmata direct vision.
[4941] Apply dharmata word near, four from:
[4942] Samsara dharmas,
[4943] Called this dharmata nirvana dharmata;
[4944] Vision dharmas,
[4945] Called this dharmata empty;
[4946] Dharmas not liberating from non-existing main-point,
[4947] Famous dharmata this dharmata existing liberating certain;
[4948] Dhatu dharmas,
[4949] Awareness dharmata famous,
[4950] Desire non-dual both.
[4951] Direct: actually see existing in sense-power activity field;
[4952] That also: not rely on intellect—
[4953] Intellect wisdom, whatever seek, time not existing to find;  Seeker not eye-possess,  Cause not luminous-clear form-possess.  From Collection:  Investigate wisdom, aggregates' bottom not find.  Thus it was said.  This luminous-clear vision, term-famous, not form-possess—  Subtle particle and coarse entity,  Self-characteristic this not existing cause,  Element-four harm, destroy, crush not possible cause;  Form-possess: existing destroy crush possible,  That cause form's characteristic.  Three enumeration: outer body, speech, mind three,  Establish base with main-point three.

[4954] Inner: dharmata field main-point;
[4955] Dawn cause: gate main-point;
[4956] Wind abiding: three main-points clear path,
[4957] Secret: habituation measure sequence,
[4958] Ripen: sign sequence,
[4959] Ultimate end: exhaust sequence,
[4960] And take measure with three,
[4961] Supreme vision.
[4962] Ripen: point;
[4963] Complete: body and three fruit complete cause;
[4964] Three group: four determine,
[4965] Therefore called three.
[4966] Or: dharmata three-bodies spontaneous-completion existing,
[4967] Self-resonance vision three,
[4968] Outer dawn number;
[4969] Dharmakaya self-resonance: inner experience awareness-empty;
[4970] Sambhogakaya self-resonance: light five outer clear,
[4971] Wisdom self-clear;
[4972] Nirmanakaya self-resonance: dawn liberation,
[4973] Equal limitless discriminating-awareness potency with three,
[4974] Rely therefore called three.
[4975] That also: base three establish base,
[4976] Entity not-existing difference main-point,
[4977] And path three clear obstacle,
[4978] Path not-existing near far,
[4979] And measure three deliver measure,
[4980] Not-existing similar different random,
[4981] And fruit three exhaust end deliver,
[4982] Not-existing yes-no doubt,
[4983] Therefore called direct.  Ordinary time: see three—pleasure, displeasure, equanimity,  Dawn three—pleasure, pain, middle;  Guru instruction experience take time:  Direct see three—dhatu, awareness, dharmas.  Dharmata direct: main-point not-existing add intellect word;  Habituation time: main-point self-cease delusion vision,  See three-bodies' light point;  Measure arrive time: direct see three—clear, empty, pleasure;  Main-point: dharmata self-exhaust.  Thus: three enumeration place other rely,  Determine simultaneous liberate fruit.  Vision: whatever dawn, dharmata dawn;  Field: whatever dawn, dhatu dawn;  Manner: whatever dawn, light, light-house,  Awareness hanging-cord with dawn.  Buddha: not-seeing with stone,  Fruit: take that vision experience.  Thus: dharmata direct vision essence—  Dhatu awareness luminous-clear vision.
