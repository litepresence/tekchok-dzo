[13104] <prose>First, for the mind of the gandharva entering nearby, seeking a body—the manner of coming.</prose>
[13105] <prose>Father and Mother, joining and dissolving in wisdom-space, from the mother's birth passage entering.</prose>
[13106] <prose>The father's white essence, the size of a mustard seed, clear small eye—like quicksilver.</prose>
[13107] <prose>Absorbed into the red essence of the mother's lineage channel.</prose>
[13108] <prose>In the mother's womb, like blood and milk mixed, becoming one from that.</prose>
[13109] <prose>The manner of the body's formation explained: first, the support of the body's formation is:</prose>
[13110] <prose>From the four elements empty, space like the sky abiding.</prose> || 10 ||
[13111] <prose>From those parents' self-nature afflictions and the channels' leaves' wind, desire-mind moved.</prose>
[13112] <prose>From the channel-abode's letter wind's self-sound YAM, from that state the fire desire actually blazing.</prose>
[13113] <prose>RAM—like that sound moves, blazing and changing—appearance.</prose>
[13114] <prose>That desire becoming attached, desire cause and attached condition two joined.</prose>
[13115] <prose>Actually entering the water desire.</prose>
[13116] <prose>Looking at one another.</prose>
[13117] <prose>Smiling.</prose>
[13118] <prose>Embracing and so forth, attached by letter self-sound KHAM moves.</prose>
[13119] <prose>From embracing and sense-faculties joined.</prose>
[13120] <prose>From the earth stability of the body, bliss experienced.</prose> || 20 ||
[13121] <prose>SAM self-sound arises.</prose>
[13122] <prose>The mother's lineage five channels twisted, that moon-time and seven-day period becoming.</prose>
[13123] <prose>Red, like an iron hook drawing, the wind power possessing that.</prose>
[13124] <prose>The father's essence, the cause's self-nature from crown drawn.</prose>
[13125] <prose>Like iron gathering in the magnet.</prose>
[13126] <prose>From the father's twenty-eight vertebrae passed through, the white channel-path emerged from the white shell-like cavity.</prose>
[13127] <prose>For seven days, four times in the mother's womb, the body's basis held and son bodhicitta white arising—the essential point.</prose>
[13128] <prose>Then at the vajra channel-base, great bliss path opened.</prose>
[13129] <prose>At the navel, bliss poured into the sheep-like.</prose>
[13130] <prose>At the tip, bliss ripened.</prose> || 30 ||
[13131] <prose>Directly emerging to the mouth, into the mother's lineage channel nose inside red tone absorbed.</prose>
[13132] <prose>In the womb like blood and milk mixed, one absorbed into one, two lineages possessing.</prose>
[13133] <prose>From the lineage five's power, the father's consciousness also drawn inside like.</prose>
[13134] <prose>Later, free from attachment, going by vomit.</prose>
[13135] <prose>The mother whatever lineage pulling-possessing, to bliss contentment not-knowing is.</prose>
[13136] <prose>From desire-attachment cause-condition arisen.</prose>
[13137] <prose>Desire and attachment two.</prose>

[13141] <prose>Body and wisdom's result rolled.</prose>
[13142] <prose>Thus from the mother's womb one night's night, father-mother cause-condition two outer cause one becoming.</prose>
[13143] <prose>Inside not-mixed, like a mustard seed in a ga'u abiding, until son wind-mind held abiding, the four elements binding-cause vajra-like jewel-shell binding, separation no opportunity made.</prose>
[13144] <prose>Body complete time, food element not, life not abiding—from that arisen.</prose>
[13145] <prose>At that time, elements wind body held, that inside wind up-blown power up-arising, like mercury drops upward, flickering abiding.</prose>
[13146] <prose>Body complete time, body-mind sudden condition whatever arisen, bright-aware body trembling essential point—from that arisen.</prose>
