[13107] Absorbed into the red essence of the mother's lineage channel.
[13108] In the mother's womb, like blood and milk mixed, becoming one from that.
[13109] The manner of the body's formation explained: first, the support of the body's formation is:
[13110] From the four elements empty, space like the sky abiding.
[13111] From those parents' self-nature afflictions and the channels' leaves' wind, desire-mind moved.
[13112] From the channel-abode's letter wind's self-sound YAM, from that state the fire desire actually blazing.
[13113] RAM—like that sound moves, blazing and changing—appearance.
[13114] That desire becoming attached, desire cause and attached condition two joined.
[13115] Actually entering the water desire.

[13127] For seven days, four times in the mother's womb, the body's basis held and son bodhicitta white arising—the essential point.
[13128] Then at the vajra channel-base, great bliss path opened.
[13129] At the navel, bliss poured into the sheep-like.
[13130] At the tip, bliss ripened.
[13131] Directly emerging to the mouth, into the mother's lineage channel nose inside red tone absorbed.
[13132] In the womb like blood and milk mixed, one absorbed into one, two lineages possessing.
