[10766] First, the essential nature: vast and expansive, the great identity of clarity, self-illuminating.
[10767]
[10768] The definitive terms are these:
[10769] It is called the "center";
[10770] It is called the "expanse."
[10771] The nature of Dharmatā, the very substance of things, is vast and without limit.
[10772]
[10773] Divided, there is the outer expanse—space;
[10774] The inner expanse—the lamp;
[10775] The secret expanse—light and bindu; || 10 ||
[10776] The unsurpassed expanse—the great display of self-liberated delusory appearance.
[10777]
[10778] Moreover, in progressive order:
[10779] Awareness,
[10780] Wisdom,
[10781] The Three Kāyas,
[10782] Are the domain of Fruition.
[10783]
[10784] The characteristic is this: since it opens to the vast, has the capacity to appear, and pervades,
[10785] It appears as the domain of clarity—like a mirror of clear depth. || 20 ||
[10786]
[10787] In brief, Dharmatā is not a thing in itself;
[10788] It is that which brings forth the power to clarify the domain through which Dharmatā appears.
[10789]
[10790] The result is this: depending upon understanding without error the domain of Dharmatā,
[10791] Seeing the essential nature of Dharmatā itself, making the unchanging direct perception the Path—one awakens to Buddhahood.
[10792]
[10793] Through familiarity with such an expanse, external wondrous signs manifest as visionary experience:
[10794] From the Blazing Reliquary:
[10795] "One who becomes familiar with the expanse— || 30 ||
[10796] Their breath, inner and outer movement exhausted,
[10797] Goes like a bird through space,
[10798] And like a fish through water;
[10799] The one endowed with fortune proceeds thus.
[10800] Together with lands and Mount Meru,
[10801] And objects not seen before—
[10802] From a single seat they behold them,
[10803] And likewise the Buddha-fields—
[10804] Those not seen before—
[10805] All these become visible at once. || 40 ||
[10806] One possessing such signs and marks,
[10807] From this point, in sixteen months,
[10808] Shall also behold the Dharmadhātu."
[10809] Thus it is said.
[10810]
[10811] The internal visionary signs are these:
[10812] From the heart-mirror of Vajrasattva, these prior signs arise for that person:
[10813] When sitting alone, experiencing bliss;
[10814] The body light as a cotton leaf;
[10815] No desire to be with others; || 50 ||
[10816] Feeling as if flying through space;
[10817] The perception of joy when appearances cease;
[10818] No attachment to body or life;
[10819] Mind not engaging with any appearance;
[10820] Awareness clear without sinking;
[10821] Cognition naturally relaxed;
[10822] Happiness when with others;
[10823] Afflictions unable to arise through any circumstance;
[10824] Even when afflictions arise, not grasping them as thoughts;
[10825] No attachment arising to beautiful forms. || 60 ||
