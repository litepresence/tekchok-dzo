[10766] According to rank: awareness, wisdom, three kayas, result object.
[10767] Characteristic: vast and opening, able to appear, pervading, appearing as clear object, like clear mirror expanse.
[10768] Briefly: not reality thing, produces power to clearly appear as object making reality appear.
[10769] Result: depending on not-mistakenly understanding reality object, seeing reality own essence, making direct non-change into path, buddhahood.
[10770] Familiarizing with such expanse, wondrous outer signs appear as experience.
[10771] From Blazing Relics:
[10772] Who is familiar with expanse,
[10773] Outer-inner breath movement ceases,
[10774] Goes like bird in sky,
[10775] Likewise like fish in water—
[10776] This fortunate one goes,
[10777] And sees objects not seen before,
[10778] Continent and Meru together,
[10779] Sees from one sitting place,
[10780] Likewise buddha-fields
[10781] Not seen before,
[10782] All these sees at one time.
[10783] Thus possessing signs,
[10784] From this in sixteen months,
[10785] Dharma-expanse also sees.
[10786] Inner experience-signs:
[10787] From Vajrasattva's heart mirror,
[10788] These before-signs arise in that person:
[10789] Joyful experience sitting alone,
[10790] Body light like cotton leaf,
[10791] 
[10792] 
[10793] 
[10794] 
[10795] 
[10796] 
[10797] 
[10798] 
[10799] 
[10800] 
[10801] 
[10802] 
[10803] 
[10804] 
[10805] 
[10806]
