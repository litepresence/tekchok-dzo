[10766] First, the essential nature: vast, expansive, the great identity of clarity self-illuminating.
[10767] 
[10768] The definitive terms are these:
[10769] <list> It is called the "center";
[10770] <list> It is called the "expanse."
[10771] The nature of dharmatā, the very substance of things, is vast and without limit.
[10772] 
[10773] Divided, there is the outer expanse—space;
[10774] <list> The inner expanse—the lamp;
[10775] <list> The secret expanse—light and bindu;
[10776] <list> The unsurpassed expanse—the great self-liberated display of delusory appearance.
[10777] 
[10778] Moreover, in progressive order:
[10779] <list> Awareness,
[10780] <list> Wisdom,
[10781] <list> The Three Kāyas,
[10782] <list> Are the domain of Fruition.
[10783] 
[10784] The characteristic is this: since it opens to the vast, has the capacity to appear, and pervades, it appears as the domain of clarity—like a mirror of the expanse of clear depth.
[10785] 
[10786] In brief, dharmatā is not a thing in itself;
[10787] It is that which brings forth the power to clarify the domain through which dharmatā appears.
[10788] 
[10789] The result is this: depending upon understanding without error the domain of dharmatā,
[10790] Seeing the essential nature of dharmatā itself, making the unchanging direct perception the Path—one awakens to Buddhahood.
[10791] 
[10792] Through familiarity with such an expanse, external wondrous signs manifest as visionary experience:
[10793] From the Blazing Reliquary:
[10794] <verse> "One who becomes familiar with the expanse—
[10795] <verse> Their breath, inner and outer movement exhausted,
[10796] <verse> Goes like a bird through space,
[10797] <verse> And like a fish through water;
[10798] <verse> The one endowed with fortune proceeds thus.
[10799] <verse> Together with lands and Mount Meru,
[10800] <verse> And objects not seen before—
[10801] <verse> From a single seat they behold them,
[10802] <verse> And likewise the Buddha-fields—
[10803] <verse> Those not seen before—
[10804] <verse> All these become visible at once.
[10805] <verse> One possessing such signs and marks,
[10806] <verse> From this point, in sixteen months,
[10807] <verse> Shall also behold the Dharmadhātu."
[10808] <verse> Thus it is said.
[10809] 
[10810] The internal visionary signs are these:
[10811] From the heart-mirror of Vajrasattva, these prior signs arise for that person:
[10812] <list> When sitting alone, experiencing bliss;
[10813] <list> The body light as a cotton leaf;
[10814] <list> No desire to be with others;
[10815] <list> Feeling as if flying through space;
[10816] <list> The perception of joy when appearances cease;
[10817] <list> No attachment to body or life;
[10818] <list> Mind not engaging with any appearance;
[10819] <list> Awareness clear without sinking;
[10820] <list> Cognition naturally relaxed;
[10821] <list> Happiness when with others;
[10822] <list> Afflictions unable to arise through any circumstance;
[10823] <list> Even when afflictions arise, not grasping them as thoughts;
[10824] <list> No attachment arising to beautiful forms;
[10825] <list> No aversion arising to ugly forms;
[10826] <list> Through the power of samādhi, no perception of food or drink;
[10827] <list> When with others, causing their minds to be discordant;
[10828] 
[10829] These are the signs preceding complete liberation from sorrow—thus it is said.
[10830] 
[10831] Third, the signs of familiarity with bindu also...
