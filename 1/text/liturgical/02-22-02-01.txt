[10766] First, the essence:
[10767] Vast, pervading great, self-nature clear, self-clear.
[10768] Definition:
[10769] Called center,
[10770] Called expanse—the nature of reality things, vast, without end.
[10771] Divided: outer expanse sky,
[10772] Inner expanse lamp,
[10773] Secret expanse light and bindu,
[10774] Unsurpassed expanse great appearance of confusion-appearance self-ceasing.
[10775] According to rank:
[10776] Awareness,
[10777] Wisdom,
[10778] Three kāyas,
[10779] Result object.
[10780] Characteristic:
[10781] Vast and opening, able to appear, pervading, appearing as clear object, like clear mirror expanse.
[10782] Briefly: not reality thing,
[10783] Produces power to make reality appear as clear object.
[10784] Result:
[10785] Depending on not-mistakenly understanding reality object,
[10786] Seeing reality own essence, making direct non-change into path, buddhahood.
[10787] Familiarizing with such expanse, outer wondrous signs appear as experience.
[10788] From the Blazing Relics:
[10789] Who familiarizes with expanse,
[10790] Outer-inner breath movement ceases,
[10791] Goes like bird in sky,
[10792] Likewise like fish in water—
[10793] This fortunate one goes,
[10794] And sees objects not seen before,
[10795] Continent and Meru together,
[10796] Sees from one sitting place,
[10797] Likewise buddha-fields
[10798] Not seen before,
[10799] All these sees at one time.
[10800] Thus possessing signs,
[10801] From this in sixteen months,
[10802] Dharma-expanse also sees.
[10803] Thus it is spoken.
[10804] Inner experience-signs:

[10807] Body light like cotton leaf,
[10808] Heart not desiring human association,
[10809] Thinking of flying in sky,
[10810] Perception of joy when this appearance ceases,
[10811] No attachment to body and life,
[10812] Mind not entering whatever appearance,
[10813] Clear awareness not dull,
[10814] Awareness naturally slow,
[10815] Joy when associating,
[10816] Not able to be aroused by any affliction,
[10817] Not holding thought even when affliction arises,
[10818] Attachment not arising to beautiful forms,
[10819] Not hating ugly forms,
[10820] Perception of food and drink not arising through samādhi power,
[10821] Making others' minds not accord when associating with humans.
[10822] These are signs before complete nirvāṇa.
