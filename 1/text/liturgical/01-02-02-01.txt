[1424] <prose> First, the eight hot hells: The Reviving Hell—human years fifty constitute one day for the Four Great Kings,
[1425] <prose> Twelve months make one year; calculated thus, five hundred years equal one day in Rīrava, the Reviving Hell, enduring five hundred of its own years.
[1426] <prose> Likewise, one thousand years of the Thirty-Three Gods equal one day in Kālakāñja, calculated thus, one thousand of its own years,
[1427] <prose> Two thousand for Tuṣita equal one day in Saṃghāta, thus calculated, two thousand of its own years,
[1428] <prose> Four thousand for Nirmanarati equal one day in Raurava, calculated thus, four thousand of its own years,
[1429] <prose> Eight thousand for Paranirmitavaśavartin equal one day in Mahāraurava, thus calculated, sixteen thousand of its own years,
[1430] <prose> Half an intermediate age for Mahātāpana,
[1431] <prose> One intermediate age for Avīci, where beings engage in long suffering.
[1432] <prose> Arbuda and Arbudanirbheda,
[1433] <prose> Aṭaṭa, || 10 ||
[1434] <prose> Hahava,
[1435] <prose> Huhuva,
[1436] <prose> Utpala-like splitting,
[1437] <prose> Padma-like splitting,
[1438] <prose> Mahāpadma-like splitting—
[1439] <prose> These eight cold hells' life measure:
[1440] <prose> The load capacity of Kosala's cart filled with sesame, removing one grain each hundred human years,
[1441] <prose> When a hundred years have passed and the sesame husking is exhausted, Arbuda's life is exhausted,
[1442] <prose> The remaining twenty times as long—thus one should know.
[1443] <prose> The Preta's life: human years one hundred, one day calculated thus, enduring five hundred of its own years, || 20 ||
[1444] <prose> Animals' lifespan is indefinite,
[1445] <prose> The great eight nāgas and so forth each endure for intermediate ages:
[1446] <prose> 
[1447] <prose> Bees and so forth exist merely for an instant, flourishing not even for a single day.
[1448] <prose> Thus, from the first eon begin to form,
[1449] <prose> Called the formed eon, from birth until one being experiences the unrelenting suffering of hell.
[1450] <prose> Three thousand worlds simultaneously formed by the sequence of vessel and essence.
[1451] <prose> That also: between the four continents, Meru, and Brahmā's realm, empty—the first thousand, the foremost world.
[1452] <prose> To that thousand, a thousand more constitute the second intermediate world.
[1453] <prose> To that thousand, a thousand three constitute the great-thousand, the great world. || 30 ||
[1454] <prose> In this dwell ten million times a hundred Merus and so forth.
[1455] <prose> These forms endure for twenty intermediate eons.
[1456] <prose> Of these, abiding for twenty intermediate eons:
[1457] <prose> Decrease for one,
[1458] <prose> Increase and decrease for eighteen,
[1459] <prose> Increase for one—three manners. First:
[1460] <prose> Life's measure from immeasurable to eighty thousand, decreasing by two hundred years each time.
[1461] <tantra> From eighty thousand to ten, decreasing by a hundred years each time.
[1462] <ornament> Second:
