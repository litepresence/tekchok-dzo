[16409] <ornament> First: extensively explained Dharma-kāya field has essence,
[16410] <prose> Divisions,
[16411] <prose> Enumerations,
[16412] <prose> Extensive explanation—four.
[16413] <prose> Dharma-kāya's essence: self-arisen wisdom, empty-clarity, free from elaboration;
[16414] <prose> Abiding manner,
[16415] <prose> Defining characteristic,
[16416] <prose> Nature,
[16417] <prose> Compassion,
[16418] <prose> Appearance manner—five. || 10 ||
[16419] <prose> Essence's abiding manner: unstained by any flaw, nature pure from beginning.
[16420] <prose> That essence's defining characteristic: emptiness possessing awareness-essence.
[16421] <prose> That essence's nature: non-mixed with anything.
[16422] <prose> That essence's compassion: without opening, closing, or division-making.
[16423] <prose> That essence's appearance manner: non-dual.
[16424] <prose> Definitive terminology:
[16425] <prose> Maturation from labeled enumeration dharmas into kāya—thus without entity,
[16426] <prose> Defining characteristic nowhere determined,
[16427] <prose> Emptiness nowhere established—therefore called "Dharma-kāya."
[16428] <prose> Dharma means: || 20 ||
[16429] <prose> Buddha-ground's stainless dharmas connected with awareness;
[16430] <prose> Kāya means:
[16431] <prose> Marks and signs without face or hands, merely referring to unchanging awareness-essence.
[16432] <prose> Divisions:
[16433] <prose> Dharma-kāya connected with entity-defining characteristics;
[16434] <prose> Dharma-kāya connected with abiding-all-pervading manner;
[16435] <prose> Dharma-kāya connected with divisions-appearance manner—three.
