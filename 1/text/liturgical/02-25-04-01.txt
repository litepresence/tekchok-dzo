[16409] Dharma-kāya's field extensively explained comprises essence,
[16410] Divisions,
[16411] Enumerations,
[16412] And extensive explanation—four aspects.

[16413] Dharma-kāya's essence: self-arisen wisdom, empty-clarity, free from elaboration.
[16414] Abiding manner,
[16415] Defining characteristic,
[16416] Nature,
[16417] Compassion,
[16418] And appearance manner—five aspects.

[16419] Essence's abiding manner: abiding unstained by any flaw, the nature pure from the beginning.
[16420] That essence's defining characteristic: emptiness possessing awareness's essence.
[16421] That essence's nature: non-mixed with anything whatsoever.
[16422] That essence's compassion: without opening, dividing, or division-making.
[16423] That essence's appearance manner: without duality.

[16424] Definitive terminology:
[16425] Maturation from labeled enumeration's dharmas into kāya—thus without entity,
[16426] Defining characteristic nowhere completely determined,
[16427] Emptiness nowhere established—therefore called "Dharma-kāya."

[16428] Dharma means
[16429] Buddha-ground's stainless dharmas connected with awareness;
[16430] Kāya means
[16431] Marks and signs without face or hands, merely referring to unchanging awareness-essence.

[16432] Divisions:
[16433] Dharma-kāya connected with entity-defining characteristics;
[16434] Dharma-kāya connected with abiding-all-pervading manner;
[16435] Dharma-kāya connected with divisions-appearance manner—three.

[16436] The first:
[16437] Regarding Dharmatā, nowhere established as anyone's essence, free from elaboration-extremes,
[16438] Beyond entity-positing, without birth, cessation, transfer, or change,
[16439] Ultimate directly manifest—Dharmatā inconceivable.

[16440] The second:
[16441] The Dharma-kāya pervading all samsara and nirvāṇa, possessing twofold purity through purification of adventitious stains—

<tantra> [16442] From Hevajra:
<tantra> [16443] "Sentient beings are Buddhas themselves,
<tantra> [16444] Yet obscured by adventitious stains;
<tantra> [16445] When these are removed, Buddhas themselves."

<tantra> [16447] From Sublime Continuum:
<tantra> [16448] "Perfect Buddha-kāya is radiant,
<tantra> [16449] Suchness without distinction,
<tantra> [16450] And possessing disposition—therefore
<tantra> [16451] All sentient beings always possess Buddha-nature."
<tantra> [16452] This is the aspect directly manifest.

[16453] The third:
[16454] From individual vehicles, awareness and
[16455] Emptiness and
[16456] Qualities and so forth's manifestation is shown.

[16457] In Great Perfection, divided through emanation:
[16458] Dharma-kāya's Dharma-kāya field: inconceivable,
[16459] Field: Dharmatā beyond thought,
[16460] Samādhi: great immovable,
[16461] Retinue: various, nature non-dual,
[16462] Teaching: Dharmatā beyond expression,
[16463] Time: Dharmatā unchanging at any time.

[16464] Dharma-kāya's saṃbhoga-kāya field: free from dust, stainless,
[16465] Field: conception and thought self-exhausted,
[16466] Samādhi: mind and mental factors' sensations ceased, wisdom self-abiding,
[16467] Retinue: empty, self-appearing agent,
[16468] Teaching: completely pure observation,
[16469] Time: great openness, not determined, always equal.

[16470] Dharma-kāya's emanation-kāya:
[16471] Field: emptiness, without boundary,
[16472] Field: all's manifestation-basis aspect, great depth-clear self-clarity,
[16473] Samādhi: self-clear, without cessation,
[16474] Retinue: markless manifestation, clear appearance,
[16475] Teaching: natural, unfabricated,
[16476] Time: essence clearly manifest.

[16477] These too are merely labeled from primordially pure self-abiding Dharma-kāya's aspect.

<tantra> [16478] From Jewel Heap:
<tantra> [16479] "Through self-pure Dharma-kāya,
<tantra> [16480] In elaboration-free self-pure celestial palace,
<tantra> [16481] To appearance-retinue indivisible from oneself,
<tantra> [16482] Through markless Speech,
<tantra> [16483] Elaboration-free words
<tantra> [16484] Are emitted from self-exhausted Mind.
<tantra> [16485] Unspoken, without speaking,
<tantra> [16486] Shown in mahāmudrā's state."
<tantra> [16487] Thus it is spoken.

[16488] These too are merely labeled as aspects,
[16489] Actually nowhere established, abiding as extreme-free Great Perfection.

<tantra> [16490] From that very text:
<tantra> [16491] "This field, called 'this,'
<tantra> [16492] Renowned name with marked object,
<tantra> [16493] Aspects nowhere appearing,
<tantra> [16494] From non-existing emptiness,
<tantra> [16495] Great secret's own Expanse,
<tantra> [16496] Primordially abiding,
<tantra> [16497] Ungrasped, possessing abiding manner,
<tantra> [16498] Greatly displays emanation.
<tantra> [16499] No one abides from this,
<tantra> [16500] No one makes this abide;
<tantra> [16501] Without perfection here,
<tantra> [16502] Without abiding or coming.
<tantra> [16503] Thus great primordial emptiness's abode,
<tantra> [16504] From non-existence, Expanse's grove,
<tantra> [16505] Without outer or inner here,
<tantra> [16506] Without looking above or below,
<tantra> [16507] In directions and intermediate directions,
<tantra> [16508] Nothing whatsoever is grasped here."
<tantra> [16509] Thus it is spoken.

[16510] The fourth: extensively explained enumerations from body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities:
[16511] Dharma-kāya's body: empty-clarity, without marks;
[16512] Speech: expressionless, beyond words and sounds;
[16513] Mind: without mindfulness, thought, or elaboration;
[16514] Qualities: without return, change, or transfer;
[16515] Activities: spontaneously arising, unceasing manifestation-basis abiding.

<tantra> [16517] From Thalgyur:
<tantra> [16518] "Dharma-kāya: body, speech,
<tantra> [16519] Mind, qualities, and activities.
<tantra> [16520] Body: emptiness and clarity,
<tantra> [16521] Markless nature.
<tantra> [16522] Speech: free from sound and word names,
<tantra> [16523] Free from expression and discussion.
<tantra> [16524] Mind: without thought or movement,
<tantra> [16525] Beyond radiating and investigating.
<tantra> [16526] Qualities: without coming, returning, or change,
<tantra> [16527] Pervading Expanse and wisdom,
<tantra> [16528] Nature unfabricated.
<tantra> [16529] Activities: unarisen, unborn,
<tantra> [16530] Spontaneously arisen, without cessation,
<tantra> [16531] Without fabrication, without making."
<tantra> [16532] Thus it is spoken.
