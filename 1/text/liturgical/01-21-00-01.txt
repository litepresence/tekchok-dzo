<ornament> [9413] How Jambudvīpa manifests — the manner of this world's arising.

[9413] Realized yoga — in sequence, the Four Knowledge-Holders appear.

[9414] Ripened Knowledge-Holder (*smin rig 'dzin*): The mind, ripened as the deity's body through generation-stage cultivation; yet the physical form remains unripened — such a practitioner attains **liberation in the Bardo** (*bar do grol*).

[9415] Knowledge-Holder with Power Over Life (*tshe dbang rig 'dzin*): Through mastery of the subtle winds and bindus, such a one attains **liberation in that very life** (*tshe 'di grol*) — transcending death entirely.

[9416] Mahāmudrā Knowledge-Holder (*phyag chen rig 'dzin*): Both body and mind fully ripened as the deity — the Great Seal of appearance and emptiness inseparable, realization complete.

[9417] Spontaneously Accomplished Knowledge-Holder (*lhun grub rig 'dzin*): Beyond effort, beyond contrivance — spontaneously completing the twofold benefit of self and others through effortless enlightened activity.

<tantra> [9418] Apply these sixteen as before; know the qualities that manifest through authentic practice.</tantra>

[9419] The Ripened: If practice remains uninterrupted, obtaining life control in that very life; obtaining the supreme result.

[9420] Life Control: Through training in miracles for one great kalpa, obtaining the ground of the Vajra-holder — immutable awakened presence.

[9421] Mahāmudrā: In one hundred years of continuous practice, obtaining the ground of the Vajra-holder — the Great Seal fully realized.

[9422] Spontaneous Accomplishment: In one thousand years, obtaining the ground of the Vajra-holder — accomplishing the twofold benefit through the Four Enlightened Activities.

<list> [9423] The Four Enlightened Activities (*phrin las bzhi*):
[9424] Pacifying (*zhi ba*) — dispelling obstacles, illness, and negativity;
[9425] Increasing (*rgyas pa*) — developing qualities, lifespan, merit, and prosperity;
[9426] Empowering (*dbang gi*) — gathering influence, magnetizing beings and resources;
[9427] Wrathful (*drag po*) — destroying obstacles, subduing hostile forces, and cutting through delusion.</list>

[9428] Therein, through elaborated means, the Pacifying Activity manifests — removing obstacles of body and mind;
[9429] Pacifying both subtle and gross defilements of non-entity.

[9430] Divided thus: Pacifying's Pacifying — harmonizing consciousness and wind;
[9431] Pacifying's Increasing — extending life and merit;
[9432] Pacifying's Empowering — bestowing power of body and speech;
[9433] Pacifying's Wrathful — dualistic fixation pacified, abiding as singular awakened presence.

[9434] Through unelaborated means, the Increasing Activity is accomplished.
[9435] Divided thus: Increasing's Pacifying — exhausting all negative conceptions;
[9436] Increasing's Increasing — extending life, merit, retinue, enjoyments; reversing decline; bestowing blessings;
[9437] Increasing's Empowering — bringing forth whatever accomplishment is wished;
[9438] Increasing's Wrathful — establishing power through wrathful body, speech, and mind.

[9439] Through extremely unelaborate means, the Empowering Activity is accomplished.
[9440] Divided thus: Through pacifying empowerment, obstacles of body, speech, and mind are pacified;
[9441] Through increasing empowerment, view, meditation, conduct, and result all increase;
[9442] Through empowering empowerment, humans and non-humans are gathered as disciples;
[9443] Through wrathful empowerment, summoning, binding, and subduing are accomplished.

[9444] Through completely unelaborate means, Wrathful Activity is accomplished.
[9445] Divided thus: Through wrathful pacifying, summoning and binding hostile forces;
[9446] Through wrathful increasing, dividing and expelling obstructors;
[9447] Through wrathful empowering, at challenge, no adversary is found — complete victory;
[9448] Through wrathful wrathfulness, suppressing, subduing, and when necessary, destroying obstacles.
