[8083] Samsara cycles namelessly in delusion; yet the distinctive excellence of this life-force bringing liberation through light is exceptional.
[8084] From the Thalgyur:
[8085] <tantra> Since this reveals the natural realm,
[8086] <tantra> Without entering the circle of conditions,
[8087] <tantra> As primordial purity and spontaneous presence,
[8088] <tantra> From the sphere of objects and consciousness,
[8089] <tantra> Liberated at the very basis of each distinct essence.
[8090] Thus it is said.
[8091] Yet if one asks what difference exists between liberation through Trekchö and not reaching the full measure of appearance while being liberated from the aggregates,
[8092] there is a vast distinction. || 10 ||
[8093] Through Trekchö one is liberated, yet from atomic particles without remainder,
[8094] transformation into light is impossible.
[8095] Without going into light, the vajra body is not established;
[8096] through the temporary illusory body, the final result is not traversed.
[8097] Without obtaining the body of light, the great transference body is not attained,
[8098] and therefore the great benefit for others through that support is not accomplished.
[8099] Thus from the aspect of entering light and atomic particles,
[8100] the great transference cannot perform benefit, while the eye of wisdom and clairvoyance,
[8101] the accomplishment of miraculous powers—there exists distinction of magnitude.
[8102] Second: || 20 ||
[8103] Although rigpa is spoken of as luminosity from the beginning, through Trekchö's estimation of emptiness, its own light is not seen.
[8104] Through Thögal's application of crucial points, when dharmatā's essence-luminosity is internally captured,
[8105] the individual's own-resonance luminosity appears externally as practical display—this is superior.
[8106] From the Rangshar:
[8107] <verse> This King of Rigpa, self-appearance,
[8108] <verse> Exists in all yet is unrecognized.
[8109] Thus it is said.
[8110] Third:
[8111] The pristine wisdom of rigpa not seen in Trekchö, covered by expansion, determined as only one without seeing—
[8112] in Thögal, through the opening of pristine wisdom's vision, dharmatā's sun-rays appearing clear: || 30 ||
[8113] From the Thalgyur:
[8114] <tantra> Through dharmatā's direct appearance,
[8115] <tantra> The view of intellectual grasping is consumed.
[8116] Thus it is said.
[8117] Fourth:
[8118] In Trekchö, relying upon coarse nāḍī and prāṇa,
[8119] in Thögal, capturing the pure light-nāḍī and actualizing the four lamps on the Path—
[8120] From that very source:
[8121] <tantra> Moreover through nāḍī and illusory wheel,
[8122] <tantra> The five wisdoms of natural appearance, || 40 ||
[8123] <tantra> Are seen by the water-bubble eye.
[8124] Thus it is said.
[8125] Fifth:
[8126] In Trekchö, seeking clarity through the six sense-doors not purified, through the mind's phenomena; in Thögal, through the pure luminosity-door opened by wisdom-prāṇa, the four lamps' appearance dawns—this is superior.
[8127] From that very source:
[8128] <tantra> However it arises from the door,
[8129] <tantra> Through entering-prāṇa's force,
[8130] <tantra> From the four lamps, four activities arise.
[8131] Thus it is said.
[8132] Sixth: || 50 ||
[8133] In Trekchö, seeking clarity through the door of rigpa's self-clarity without seeing;
[8134] in Thögal, through the wisdom-door of external-internal spontaneous presence,
[8135] the appearance of dharmadhātu and wisdom without separation or dispersion is directly examined—this distinctive excellence is superior.
[8136] From the Thalgyur:
[8137] <tantra> To the pure dharmadhātu lamp,
[8138] <tantra> Bindus, bodies, and illusory appearances,
[8139] <tantra> Natural expression and essence-nature,
[8140] <tantra> Non-dual without separation or dispersion, appear.
[8141] Thus it is said.
[8142] Seventh: || 60 ||
[8143] In Trekchö, having caused external objects and internal mind's delusion to appear, through resting in the state without rejection or acceptance, those are not quickly liberated.
[8144] In Thögal, from the moment of applying crucial points,
[8145] external-internal illusory appearances together with deluded apprehension are self-liberated;
[8146] not depending upon purification resting in the state without abandoning,
[8147] wisdom's increasing appearance waxes like the moon's waxing fortnight,
[8148] the four appearances reaching full measure and quickly liberated.
[8149] From that source:
[8150] <verse> The manner of appearance is not delusion,
[8151] <verse> In the nature of pure causal conditions,
[8152] <verse> Entities and non-entities self-purified, || 70 ||
[8153] <verse> The five doors' object-grasping purified,
[8154] <verse> The coarse elements purified,
[8155] <verse> Pristine wisdom purified, increasing appearance shown,
[8156] <verse> From that, exhausted dharmatā.
[8157] Thus it is said.
[8158] Although these distinctions, analyzed in detail, are inconceivable,
[8159] I speak merely a brief outline.
[8160] In summary: through directly seeing rigpa's actual meaning and its visible presence,
[8161] delusion reverses in a single moment; through the body of investigation,
[8162] having made delusory appearance the Path, seeking the result of non-delusion—through this distinctive excellence, those possessing the eye of wisdom should understand. || 80 ||
[8163] Since this Dharma possesses such crucial points, it is called the supreme pinnacle of all.
[8164] Second: The presentation of Thögal possessing distinctive excellence has three parts:
[8165] <list> The general presentation of the three crucial points of dharmatā's wheel;
[8166] <list> The detailed explanation of the day-night luminosity wheel's manner of engagement;
[8167] <list> The extensive presentation of the vast expanse wisdom wheel.
[8168] First has four parts:
[8169] <list> The body's three crucial points of posture;
[8170] <list> The door's three crucial points of gaze;
[8171] <list> The dharmadhātu's three crucial points of guidance;
[8172] <list> The object's three crucial points of appearance. || 90 ||
[8173] First:
[8174] Whichever of the body's three postures one assumes,
[8175] there is purpose in resting the nāḍī-prāṇa in ease with relaxed abdomen;
[8176] if deliberately constrained, prāṇa and so forth become inverted and scattered, causing nāḍī constriction and excessive tension.
[8177] Therefore, together with the gaze, this distinctive Dharma of crucial points—drawing out slowly through the mouth from prāṇa dwelling extremely gently—is most important.
[8178] This, the common manner of exhaling and inhaling through the nose, filling the four wheels internally, generating clarity-luminosity samādhi,
[8179] in that manner: inverted prāṇa,
[8180] scattered prāṇa,
[8181] whirling prāṇa,
[8182] the four obscurations of sluggishness arising, various delusory appearances not dawning. || 100 ||
[8183] Here, purification of prāṇa does not increase the Path,
[8184] yet filling with the four wheels internally, although discursive thought's expansion is momentarily stopped, it cannot ultimately be stopped;
[8185] therefore, karmic prāṇa self-ceases and is released through the mouth.
[8186] Through the nose, entering solely the taste-channel,
[8187] then entering internally through the root of all four wheels,
[8188] discursive thought's various movements making the mind race—having blocked this here,
[8189] connecting mouth and throat,
[8190] through the throat's nāḍī like a grass-stalk's hollow, the mind's racing horse internally self-ceases and is released;
[8191] therefore, drawing prāṇa slowly out through the mouth and dwelling however long,
[8192] horse and rider separate individually, || 110 ||
[8193] the person dissolving into the heart's internal rigpa, accomplishing non-conceptual samādhi in spontaneous flow—this is the crucial point.
[8194] Occasionally, prāṇa with rushing sound and force violently expelled,
[8195] the obscuration of prāṇa-gathering, unpleasant mind,
[8196] afflictive discursive thought's movement,
[8197] heart-center's pain—all are cleared.
[8198] At those times, violent expulsion is the supreme crucial point.
[8199] Moreover, not knowing this prāṇa-crucial point, even if meditated, appearance's increase and signs reaching measure will certainly not arise.
[8200] Second, the door-gaze's three crucial points:
[8201] Whichever of the three gazes one performs, without constraining through effort,
[8202] relaxing internally in natural flow, || 120 ||
[8203] eyes unmoving, pressing the gaze is that crucial point.
[8204] From the Thalgyur:
[8205] <tantra> Distant-set without movement is the crucial point;
[8206] <tantra> At this time, apply the three gazes.
[8207] Thus it is said.
[8208] Third, regarding the dharmadhātu-guidance's three crucial points:
[8209] Slowly with eyes' corners, up and down, into dharmadhātu appearance's sharp edge, eyes unmoving, recognition unmoved, awareness resting in clarity-emptiness single-pointedly—this is the crucial point.
[8210] From that very source:
[8211] <tantra> Dharmadhātu's crucial point is guidance;
[8212] thus it is said, and: || 130 ||
[8213] From the Rtsal Dzog:
[8214] <verse> In dharmadhātu, mindfulness awakened, sky-space,
[8215] <verse> Appearing as five masses, garuḍa of gold soaring,
[8216] <verse> Without grasping attachment, without conceptual extremes, hovering.
[8217] <verse> In self-appearance without directional falling, sky-space,
[8218] <verse> Luminous-emptiness free from elaboration, garuḍa soaring,
[8219] <verse> Without grasping appearance, in that state hovering.
[8220] <verse> In signs free from elaboration, sky-space,
[8221] <verse> Free from grasping and apprehending, dharmakāya's garuḍa soaring,
[8222] <verse> Dharmatā's self-appearance in bindu's state hovering. || 140 ||
[8223] Thus it is said.
[8224] Fourth:
[8225] Through focusing upon external space-object cloudless sky, rigpa clears and opens, appearance quickly increasing;
[8226] through focusing upon internal dharmadhātu lamp, luminosity mother-child connect;
[8227] through focusing upon secret object rigpa's self-clarity, the meaning of primordial purity and exhausted phenomena self-clarifies in its own place—there exists this crucial point.
[8228] From the Rangshar:
[8229] <verse> In the sky-empty maṇḍala of space,
[8230] <verse> The uncontrived four lamps,
[8231] <verse> Unceasing through meaning's nature, clear.
[8232] <verse> Rigpa, dharmadhātu's lamp, || 150 ||
[8233] <verse> In sky-empty vast expanse's center,
[8234] <verse> Dharmadhātu's nature, light-body,
[8235] <verse> Unceasing, unceased, clearly appearing.
[8236] <verse> Five wisdoms complete, heart-mind's body,
[8237] <verse> Arising in garuḍa-fashion.
[8238] <verse> That too: going and coming,
[8239] <verse> Movement and trembling.
[8240] <verse> Rigpa, dharmadhātu's lamp,
[8241] <verse> Placed within, rigpa unmoved,
[8242] <verse> Unchanging realization excellently explained. || 160 ||
[8243] <verse> Self-arisen wisdom's lamp,
[8244] <verse> Cutting all superimpositions,
[8245] <verse> Empty bindu's lamp,
[8246] <verse> Without effort, arisen,
[8247] <verse> Distant ropes, water's lamp,
[8248] <verse> Gazing there unmoving,
[8249] <verse> Perfection of meditation's measure thus spoken.
[8250] Thus it is said, and:
[8251] From the Thalgyur:
[8252] <tantra> This itself, the object's crucial point is thus: || 170 ||
[8253] <tantra> In cloudless external object-emptiness,
[8254] <tantra> The yogin dwells in sky's bird-path;
[8255] <tantra> Not separating from this is dharmatā.
[8256] Thus it is said, and:
[8257] <tantra> Moreover:
[8258] <tantra> The characteristics of appearance's object are:
[8259] <tantra> In blue-green limitless sky,
[8260] <tantra> Light and color and form,
[8261] <tantra> Five wisdoms' self-appearance shown.
[8262] <tantra> To the pure dharmadhātu lamp, || 180 ||
[8263] <tantra> Bindus, bodies, and illusory appearances,
[8264] <tantra> Natural expression and essence-nature,
[8265] <tantra> Non-dual without separation or dispersion, appear.
[8266] Thus it is said.
[8267] At this time, although subtle discursive thought sha-ra-ra arises from prāṇa moving within the nāḍī,
[8268] there is no harm to directly perceived meaning;
[8269] that very discursive thought, unable to establish itself by itself, liberates and vanishes—
[8270] like a bird of prey catching and releasing,
[8271] though attention scatters elsewhere, without distraction like continuous garuḍa-thread,
[8272] karmic traces are not accumulated, || 190 ||
[8273] <verse> Luminosity's meditation is not destroyed;
[8274] <verse> Rigpa's potency placed in arising,
[8275] <verse> Wisdom spontaneously born, opening opportunity.
[8276] Moreover, through gaze-posture constraining, coarse discursive thought greatly blocked self-ceases;
[8277] subtle, small, fine discursive thought all self-liberated—
[8278] From the Thalgyur:
[8279] <verse> From single intent, no movement,
[8280] <verse> Appearance's appearance clear on appearance's peak,
[8281] <verse> From face and mirror-like,
[8282] <verse> Liberation is that and that itself liberated. || 200 ||
[8283] <verse> Knowing movement empty-vanished,
[8284] <verse> Seeing-knowing rigpa not different.
[8285] <verse> That itself liberated at its own peak.
[8286] <verse> Through single knowing, all liberated;
[8287] <verse> Two and three's numbers reach exhaustion.
[8288] <verse> Conceptualizing and grasping's object not appearing;
[8289] <verse> Movement and grasping primordially empty.
[8290] <verse> Empty intent clear-perfected,
[8291] <verse> Multiple numbers reach exhaustion.
[8292] Thus it is said. || 210 ||
[8293] At this time, the intent of View, Meditation, and Conduct three is gathered into single expanse:
[8294] From Vajrasattva's heart-mirror:
[8295] <verse> Without nihilistic extreme-falling, possessing View's measure;
[8296] <verse> Without conceptuality in clarity, possessing Meditation's measure;
[8297] <verse> Without contrivance in self-arising, possessing Conduct's measure;
[8298] <verse> Great bliss without outflow, this non-entity enlightenment,
[8299] <verse> Like water-moon, not held by grasping;
[8300] <verse> Like lord's treasure, self-arising desires.
[8301] Thus it is said.
[8302] Moreover, if dharmadhātu-rigpa's appearance has not dawned, through gazing evenly at the eye's corner, || 220 ||
[8303] at the time of seeing, looking unmovingly at the center of sky's maṇḍala of darkness and light is the crucial point.
[8304] From the Yige Medpa:
[8305] <verse> Rigpa resting-naturally, crucial instruction itself,
[8306] <verse> This is secret heart-essence;
[8307] <verse> Eyes should be firmly settled,
[8308] <verse> That too, examine without separation or dispersion.
[8309] <verse> From eye's corner, dharmadhātu arises;
[8310] <verse> Light, subtle, coiling arises.
[8311] <verse> That essence, garuḍa-fashion,
[8312] <verse> Subtle, trembling, and moving. || 230 ||
[8313] <verse> Eyes rest in sky's element;
[8314] <verse> Buddha-body's bindu appears.
[8315] <verse> From that, finding intent's warmth,
[8316] <verse> Rigpa's body is garuḍa-fashion,
[8317] <verse> Together with body, appearance.
[8318] Thus it is said.
[8319] At this juncture, the three certainty-pledges of luminosity's determining are:
[8320] <list> The manner of mind's stains purifying in essence-intent;
[8321] <list> The manner of resting evenly in state without movement;
[8322] <list> The manner of signs-measure time-certain arising from that. || 240 ||
[8323] First has three parts:
[8324] <list> Essence-intent itself;
[8325] <list> Mind and traces' illustrative examples;
[8326] <list> The main pledge of separation from that.
[8327] First:
[8328] From Samantabhadra's mind-mirror:
[8329] <verse> Unwavering sky, thus rigpa clear,
[8330] <verse> Clear without distraction, depth unfathomable state;
[8331] <verse> Luminous-emptiness vast, great bliss dharmadhātu, engage.
[8332] <verse> Single-pointed clarity, ultimate dharmadhātu's state; || 250 ||
[8333] <verse> Unmixed perfection, spontaneously accomplished ground abide.
[8334] Thus it is said.
[8335] In rigpa's essence, four wisdoms arising as self-potency show realization's superior seeing of natural state.
[8336] The four wisdoms:
[8337] From the Rangshar:
[8338] <verse> Moreover upon rigpa's essence,
[8339] <verse> Wisdom possessing four aspects,
[8340] <verse> These four wisdoms thus:
[8341] <verse> Liberating wisdom, liberating all,
[8342] <verse> Liberating everything completely; || 260 ||
[8343] <verse> Afflictions purified, liberated into pure field,
[8344] <verse> Without concept, without birth, liberated into state,
[8345] <verse> Ignorance into rigpa's expanse liberated,
[8346] <verse> Wisdom conceptuality into state liberated;
[8347] <verse> Therefore, liberating wisdom.
[8348] <verse> Stirring wisdom, moving
[8349] <verse> Five bodies pure, into dharmadhātu moving,
[8350] <verse> Five lights, grasping-free, into dharmadhātu moving,
[8351] <verse> Rigpa pristine wisdom, into dharmadhātu moving,
[8352] <verse> Lamps sky-space, into dharmadhātu moving; || 270 ||
[8353] <verse> Therefore, stirring wisdom.
[8354] <verse> Gathering wisdom, gathering
[8355] <verse> Elements five lights, internally gathering,
[8356] <verse> Sky-space lamps, internally gathering,
[8357] <verse> Five bodies' rigpa's state, internally gathering,
[8358] <verse> Rigpa without concept, internally gathering;
[8359] <verse> Therefore, gathering wisdom,
[8360] <verse> Gathering elements five lights internally,
[8361] <verse> Gathering sky-space lamps internally,
[8362] <verse> Gathering five bodies rigpa's state internally, || 280 ||
[8363] <verse> Gathering rigpa without concept internally;
[8364] <verse> Therefore, gathering wisdom.
[8365] <verse> Distinguishing wisdom, distinguishing
[8366] <verse> Ignorance and rigpa, distinguishing two,
[8367] <verse> Afflictions and pristine wisdom, distinguishing two,
[8368] <verse> Pure and impure, distinguishing two,
[8369] <verse> Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, distinguishing two,
[8370] <verse> Realized and unrealized, distinguishing two,
[8371] <verse> Good and bad, distinguishing two;
[8372] <verse> Therefore, distinguishing wisdom. || 290 ||
[8373] Thus it is said.
[8374] Second, at that time, mind and traces' intent-purifications purifying:
[8375] The illustrative example of that:
[8376] From Vajrasattva's heart-mirror:
[8377] <verse> Emaho, Vajradhara, listen!
[8378] <verse> Unmatured discursive thought, saṃsāra,
[8379] <verse> Like iron inserted in gold,
[8380] <verse> Not liberated, liberation's time not arising.
[8381] <verse> Ignorance iron-inserted, not liberated;
[8382] <verse> Ignorance like water, afflictions gather. || 300 ||
[8383] <verse> Anger-fire like kalpa's fire-mass;
[8384] <verse> Attachment, whatever, like drinking brine-water;
[8385] <verse> Delusion-darkness like empty house darkness;
[8386] <verse> Pride-arrogance like pressing down mountains;
[8387] <verse> Jealousy ill-will like narrow dark valleys;
[8388] <verse> Five afflictions, wisdom's obscuration making;
[8389] <verse> Mind like bitch-thief;
[8390] <verse> Consciousness like forest monkey;
[8391] <verse> Mind like impure swamp;
[8392] <verse> All-basis like sentient-being pig; || 310 ||
[8393] <verse> Knowing like bird-feather wind-carried;
[8394] <verse> Grasping-apprehending like man woman;
[8395] <verse> Karmic varieties like bird-swarm circling;
[8396] <verse> Suffering varieties like water's ripples;
[8397] <verse> Affliction-result, endurance method lacking;
[8398] <verse> Saṃsāra's suffering, grasping-apprehending thorn-needle this,
[8399] <verse> By doing not released, by leaving released becomes;
[8400] <verse> Abandoning done phenomena, ease accomplished;
[8401] <verse> Abandoning all thought, supreme wisdom unmoved;
[8402] <verse> Secret mantra king, afflictions into wisdom transformed; || 320 ||
[8403] <verse> Like empty house lamp-kindled,
[8404] <verse> Wisdom-lamp, ignorance into rigpa transformed.
[8405] Thus it is said.
[8406] Third, the manner of separation from that has three parts:
[8407] <list> Direct perception's own-time separation itself;
[8408] <list> Establishing separation's validity;
[8409] <list> Speaking other designations.
[8410] First:
[8411] Through looking at external appearance-luminosity,
[8412] without delusion, internal self-clarity's meditation self-clear at that time, || 330 ||
[8413] mind and wisdom momentarily parting back-to-back, all-basis eight-collections together with wisdom covered,
[8414] saṃsāra's phenomena not clear.
[8415] The perfected past self-established spontaneously—
[8416] From Samantabhadra's mind-mirror:
[8417] <verse> Rigpa separated from mind, Buddha himself;
[8418] <verse> Wisdom separated from intellect, intent itself;
[8419] <verse> Hidden recess separated from light-rays, pure appearance itself.
[8420] Thus it is said, and:
[8421] From the Rangshar:
[8422] <verse> Rigpa separated from mind, Buddha himself; || 340 ||
[8423] <verse> Intellect separated from Vajrasattva, I;
[8424] <verse> Clarifier-appearance, without concept, knows;
[8425] <verse> Without concept, wisdom's equality,
[8426] <verse> Self by self liberated, great.
[8427] Thus it is said.
[8428] Second, validity:
[8429] Through resting unmoved in appearance's state, saṃsāra's phenomena self-liberated into self-vanishing, like water unmoved, sediment self-vanishing—
[8430] through the example of wish-fulfilling jewel and pure water, showing intent depth unfathomable:
[8431] From the former source:
[8432] <verse> Self-arisen nectar-drop this, || 350 ||
[8433] <verse> Like wish-fulfilling jewel, pure water;
[8434] <verse> If sediment-having left, sediment clears;
[8435] <verse> Thus this heart-essence instruction,
[8436] <verse> Applied, afflictions' stain not transformed.
[8437] <verse> Solitary ease, appearance as companion dawning;
[8438] <verse> Unborn dharmadhātu, pristine wisdom luminosity,
[8439] <verse> Exists in all, yet by all not seen;
[8440] <verse> Unfathomable by calculation, like sky-dharmadhātu;
[8441] <verse> Clear and shining, like sun's light;
[8442] <verse> Unchanging, like king-mountain Meru; || 360 ||
[8443] <verse> Deep and hard to fathom, like ocean's depths;
[8444] <verse> Unstained, like swamp's lotus;
[8445] <verse> Without apprehending, like water-moon;
[8446] <verse> Appearing as whatever, like sky's miracle;
[8447] <verse> Clear and perfect, like rainbows;
[8448] Thus it is said.
[8449] Third, speaking other designations:
[8450] Dharmadhātu-rigpa and so forth, all intents, root-rigpa's single expanse equalized, determined—
[8451] moreover from that very source:
[8452] <verse> All meaning, unborn dharmadhātu, transfer; || 370 ||
[8453] <verse> Path's lamp Bodhi, recognize;
[8454] <verse> All phenomena, expression-free state, gather;
[8455] <verse> All tantras, letter-free great tantra, into self-rigpa's great tantra, transfer;
[8456] <verse> All scriptures, untaught root-great scripture, transfer;
[8457] <verse> All instructions, expression-basis-free, transfer;
[8458] <verse> All sādhanas, doing-acting-free, transfer;
[8459] <verse> All conduct, uncontrived supreme great, transfer;
[8460] <verse> All meditation, clear grasping-free great, transfer;
[8461] <verse> All views, spontaneous, unattached to anything, transfer;
[8462] <verse> All results, wisdom single-decision great, transfer; || 380 ||
[8463] <verse> All those, into non-dwelling single expanse, gather;
[8464] <verse> All saṃsāra's activities, abandon;
[8465] <verse> To pristine wisdom's appearance, constantly familiarize;
[8466] <verse> Pristine wisdom arising's time, recognize;
[8467] <verse> All ground's phenomena, essence-nature-compassion three, know;
[8468] <verse> All Path's phenomena, five bodies five wisdoms, know;
[8469] <verse> All result's phenomena, three bodies irreversible, know;
[8470] <verse> All essence's phenomena, empty, know;
[8471] <verse> All nature's phenomena, clear, know;
[8472] <verse> All compassion's phenomena, pervading all sentient beings, know; || 390 ||
[8473] <verse> All pristine wisdom's phenomena, unmixed, know;
[8474] <verse> All light's phenomena, grasping-free, know;
[8475] <verse> All ray's phenomena, emanation-retraction free, know;
[8476] <verse> All rigpa's phenomena, free from self-concept, know;
[8477] <verse> Thus all phenomena, not thinking, not contriving, transfer—thus it is said.
[8478] Second, the manner of resting evenly unmoving in state has two parts:
[8479] <list> Brief presentation of resting in essence-state;
[8480] <list> Extensive explanation of resting in natural appearance.
[8481] First:
[8482] From the Thalgyur: || 400 ||
[8483] <tantra> Meditation's characteristic, appearance's manner,
[8484] <tantra> Characteristic empty-luminous rigpa,
[8485] <tantra> Nature wherever unmixed,
[8486] <tantra> Grasping and apprehending's extremes exhausted,
[8487] <tantra> Dharmatā's own face pure.
[8488] Thus it is said.
[8489] Second, extensive explanation of resting in natural appearance:
[8490] From the Klong Drugpa:
[8491] <tantra> Past three bodies, gaze upon;
[8492] <tantra> Future three bodies, back-support; || 410 ||
[8493] <tantra> Present three bodies, enjoy—
[8494] <tantra> This is Buddhas' result made present;
[8495] <tantra> Three times equality, primordially abiding, thus called.
[8496] <tantra> Past five wisdoms, as basis made;
[8497] <tantra> Future five wisdoms, peak directed;
[8498] <tantra> Present five wisdoms, made Path—
[8499] <tantra> Clarity to clarity's light gathering, thus called;
[8500] <tantra> Three times equality, rigpa's yoga.
[8501] <tantra> Past rigpa, confidence made;
[8502] <tantra> Future rigpa, measure taken; || 420 ||
[8503] <tantra> Present rigpa, made Path—
[8504] <tantra> Mother catching child, thus called;
[8505] <tantra> Three times equality, rigpa's yoga.
[8506] <tantra> Past bindus, portion taken;
[8507] <tantra> Future bindus, mind directed;
[8508] <tantra> Present bindus, all gathered one—
[8509] <tantra> Single alone, root cut, thus called;
[8510] <tantra> Three times equality, gathered yoga, thus called.
[8511] <tantra> Past dharmadhātu and boundary joined;
[8512] <tantra> Future dharmadhātu and expanse grown; || 430 ||
[8513] <tantra> Present dharmadhātu and ground one-abiding—
[8514] <tantra> Rigpa entered dharmadhātu, thus called;
[8515] <tantra> Three times equality, primordially connected, thus called.
[8516] <tantra> Past lamps, gaze upon;
[8517] <tantra> Future lamps, hand-grasped;
[8518] <tantra> Present lamps, clarity applied—
[8519] <tantra> Empty dharma-source lamp, self-pure view;
[8520] <tantra> Three times equality, primordially appearing.
[8521] <tantra> Past lights, Path-directed;
[8522] <tantra> Future lights, mind-placed; || 440 ||
[8523] <tantra> Present lights, mind-set—
[8524] <tantra> All appearance to self-expanse reached, thus called;
[8525] <tantra> Three times equality, primordially without separation or dispersion, thus it is said.
[8526] Third, the manner of signs-measure time-certain arising from that has three parts:
[8527] <list> Luminosity three bodies' signs;
[8528] <list> Samādhi spontaneously accomplished's measure;
[8529] <list> Unmoving even-resting's time.
[8530] First:
[8531] Moreover from that very source:
[8532] <verse> Through samādhi first resting-naturally, || 450 ||
[8533] <verse> Three bodies gradually accustomed,
[8534] <verse> Entity-nature's yogin,
[8535] <verse> Through this meaning, supreme nearness becomes.
[8536] <verse> Three bodies accustomed samādhi experienced,
[8537] <verse> Simultaneous arising is not;
[8538] <verse> All this gradually, mind's object.
[8539] <verse> At first, samādhi nirmāṇakāya obtained,
[8540] <verse> At that time, to self-knowing,
[8541] <verse> Previously unseen phenomena,
[8542] <verse> Without thinking, to mind arise. || 460 ||
[8543] <verse> Self-instruction's conventional words,
[8544] <verse> Without grasping, to mind radiate;
[8545] <verse> To person possessing fortune,
[8546] <verse> Dharma's taste, mind expanding,
[8547] <verse> Body too, six-seven days,
[8548] <verse> Existing things not felt,
[8549] <verse> Earth's surface transcending,
[8550] <verse> To intermediate space going experience,
[8551] <verse> Self's activity sphere arising.
[8552] <verse> Rigpa uncontrived, castle-placed, || 470 ||
[8553] <verse> Self thus obtains nirmāṇakāya.
[8554] <verse> That transcended, rigpa unmoved,
[8555] <verse> Saṃbhogakāya body too,
[8556] <verse> Self-knowing's continuum,
[8557] <verse> Self-appearance effort all-free,
[8558] <verse> Experience thus arising.
[8559] <verse> Previously unseen light-appearance too,
[8560] <verse> Mass by mass, who sees,
[8561] <verse> This too saṃbhogakāya trained;
[8562] <verse> Fortunate person, yogin, possessing family, || 480 ||
[8563] <verse> Knowing self-clear, experience each clear.
[8564] <verse> Self-clear mind gradual familiarity,
[8565] <verse> Internal clear, wavering-mind externally not moving,
[8566] <verse> Entity's after-mind not following,
[8567] <verse> World's activities mind not appearing.
[8568] <verse> Through this, saṃbhogakāya obtained.
[8569] <verse> Then rigpa to sky,
[8570] <verse> Resting-naturally great gaze,
[8571] <verse> Without distraction evenly resting,
[8572] <verse> Again dharmakāya's samādhi appears. || 490 ||
[8573] <verse> That time, knowing depth-clear,
[8574] <verse> Garuḍa-fashion directly engaging,
[8575] <verse> Appearance-increase's measure is.
[8576] <verse> Knowing sharp, quick,
[8577] <verse> Previously unseen Buddha seen,
[8578] <verse> This, that time, people,
[8579] <verse> Hundred-thousand million to mind appear.
[8580] <verse> Body's previously done,
[8581] <verse> Knowing-without knowing's crafts and,
[8582] <verse> Illusion-magic and letters and, || 500 ||
[8583] <verse> Signs and sounds and dependent-arising and,
[8584] <verse> How previously unseen,
[8585] <verse> All this experience and,
[8586] <verse> Earth and water and fire and wind's
[8587] <verse> Sound too through this self-power obtained;
[8588] <verse> In short, six clairvoyances too,
[8589] <verse> Fortunate person, this obtains,
[8590] <verse> Self and other benefits,
[8591] <verse> Person this accomplishes.
[8592] Thus it is said. || 510 ||
[8593] Second, samādhi spontaneously accomplished's measure:
[8594] Moreover from that very source:
[8595] <verse> Three bodies self-arisen intent,
[8596] <verse> In short, thus experience-measure found.
[8597] <verse> Nirmāṇakāya body's yogin engaging,
[8598] <verse> Previously non-existent great compassion,
[8599] <verse> Self-continuum supreme arising,
[8600] <verse> This time, nirmāṇakāya's samādhi obtained.
[8601] <verse> Clear without concept, knowing's experience,
[8602] <verse> Saṃbhogakāya's samādhi called. || 520 ||
[8603] <verse> Outflow-free emptiness bindu's body,
[8604] <verse> Effort-free self-arisen time,
[8605] <verse> Dharmakāya's samādhi,
[8606] <verse> Yogin possessing this obtains.
[8607] Thus it is said.
[8608] Third, unmoving even-resting's time has two parts:
[8609] <list> Luminosity direct-appearance's time;
[8610] <list> Instruction arising-place application time.
[8611] First:
[8612] Moreover from that very source: || 530 ||
[8613] <verse> All appearance self-power transformed,
[8614] <verse> Rigpa directly shown time,
[8615] <verse> Intent true-seeing's time called.
[8616] <verse> All appearance self-direction arisen,
[8617] <verse> Experience's seed increasing time,
[8618] <verse> Rigpa itself to balance reached time called.
[8619] <verse> Person arising's strength exhausted,
[8620] <verse> Knowing all inward-looking time,
[8621] <verse> Rigpa's arising-place applying time.
[8622] <verse> Dharmatā condition-free, all appearance blissfully vast time, || 540 ||
[8623] <verse> Dharmatā mother-child equal time called.
[8624] <verse> Buddhas' truth-light, self-body filling expanding,
[8625] <verse> Body manifestly enlightened time,
[8626] <verse> Stability self-obtained's time called.
[8627] Thus it is said.
[8628] Second, instruction arising-place applying time:
[8629] From the Rangshar:
[8630] <verse> Continuum-knowing-rigpa arising time,
[8631] <verse> Body recognize;
[8632] <verse> Realization continuum-born time, rigpa's object recognize; || 550 ||
[8633] <verse> Samādhi power-transformed time, lamps pure, recognize;
[8634] <verse> Strength distinctive born time, samādhi path-clear, recognize;
[8635] <verse> Rigpa's body seen time, desire-free, know;
[8636] <verse> Wisdom distinctive continuum-born time, māra's deception recognize;
[8637] <verse> No-difficulty conduct vast-expanse time, wisdom's entering-direction recognize;
[8638] <verse> Emptiness object-pervading time, light recognize;
[8639] <verse> Lamp object-appearing time, dharmadhātu and object recognize—thus it is said.
[8640] From the Senge Tsal Dzog:
[8641] <verse> Appearance mass by mass time,
[8642] <verse> Scholar should well examine; || 560 ||
[8643] <verse> Extremely subtle and trembling time,
[8644] <verse> Through familiarity well abide.
[8645] <verse> Trembling and subtle and trembling time,
[8646] <verse> Through seeing well grasp;
[8647] <verse> Round and subtle and coiling time,
[8648] <verse> Scholar unmoved samādhi stabilize.
[8649] <verse> Flickering and fire-like and body-appearing time,
[8650] <verse> Through familiarity appearance expand, grasp;
[8651] <verse> Perfectly all-appearing time,
[8652] <verse> Scholar appearance gather explained. || 570 ||
[8653] <verse> Attachment and clinging-free time,
[8654] <verse> Scholar grasping-method should know.
[8655] <verse> Secret mantra familiarization's characteristic.
[8656] Thus it is said.
[8657] Second, day-night luminosity wheel has three parts:
[8658] <list> Dharmadhātu-luminosity's arising-basis recognition;
[8659] <list> From that, lamps' practice shown;
[8660] <list> Day-night wheel-revolution's meditation manner determined.
[8661] First:
[8662] Although spoken before, here extensively summarized, clearly shown in five: || 580 ||
[8663] <list> Dharmadhātu's abiding manner;
[8664] <list> Lamps' location manner;
[8665] <list> Dharmadhātu-rigpa arising manner;
[8666] <list> Practice engagement manner;
[8667] <list> Distinctive certainty manner.
[8668] First:
[8669] Dharmadhātu's luminosity, Sugata's essence, exists without distinction in all sentient beings.
[8670] From the Norbu Phradak:
[8671] <verse> Like sesame or mustard seed,
[8672] <verse> Oil itself primordially spontaneously complete, || 590 ||
[8673] <verse> Sentient being body-appearance,
[8674] <verse> Thus Tathāgata's seed,
[8675] <verse> Harmonious light and self-complete
[8676] <verse> Abiding, Path-entering door-pure,
[8677] <verse> Arising variously, benefit engaging.
[8678] <verse> Sky-space everywhere pervading sentient beings,
[8679] <verse> Rigpa's meaning also that much.
[8680] Thus it is said.
[8681] Where it exists:
[8682] From that very source: || 600 ||
[8683] <verse> Emaho, rigpa's abiding nature,
[8684] <verse> Self's heart-center abides;
[8685] <verse> Father-mother two's aspect-holding,
[8686] <verse> Method-wisdom manner abides.
[8687] <verse> Father's aspect-holding, method's body;
[8688] <verse> Mother's aspect-holding, wisdom's body;
[8689] <verse> Light and rays manner abides.
[8690] <verse> Dharmadhātu and rigpa excellently adorned,
[8691] <verse> Spontaneously perfected great bindu abides.
[8692] Thus it is said. || 610 ||
[8693] Moreover, how body and wisdom abide as dharmadhātu-rigpa's light-expanse,
[8694] location certainty is what and what:
[8695] From the Rtsal Dzog:
[8696] <verse> Each-own mind-jewel within,
[8697] <verse> Colorful light-blazing, vase-fashion,
[8698] <verse> Inside pristine wisdom fire-light blazing,
[8699] <verse> Measureless various pristine wisdoms appearing.
[8700] <verse> Body's essence each-each,
[8701] <verse> Speech's emanation countless,
[8702] <verse> Mind's intent unsurpassable one. || 620 ||
[8703] <verse> Thus it is said, and:
[8704] <verse> All-basis dharma-source great treasury,
[8705] <verse> Rigpa's pristine wisdom as mass abides;
[8706] <verse> Appearance grasping-free object's treasury,
[8707] <verse> Rigpa's pristine wisdom dharmadhātu abides.
[8708] <verse> Secret-gathering jewel eight-cornered treasury,
[8709] <verse> Rigpa's pristine wisdom as mass abides;
[8710] <verse> Appearance grasping-free object's treasury,
[8711] <verse> Rigpa's pristine wisdom dharmadhātu abides.
[8712] <verse> Secret-gathering jewel eight-cornered treasury, || 630 ||
[8713] <verse> Rigpa's pristine wisdom father-mother fashion,
[8714] <verse> Life-gathering jewel four-cornered treasury,
[8715] <verse> Rigpa's pristine wisdom bindu abides.
[8716] <verse> Meaning-coiled bhāṇḍa's measureless palace treasury,
[8717] <verse> Rigpa's pristine wisdom wrathful body abides.
[8718] <verse> Unceasing clear two-doors treasury,
[8719] <verse> Dharmadhātu and garuḍa-fashion abides.
[8720] <verse> Emptiness signless sky-space treasury,
[8721] <verse> Rigpa's pristine wisdom light abides;
[8722] <verse> That is shown as secret treasury. || 640 ||
[8723] Thus it is said.
[8724] Moreover, rigpa's essence that basis-heart abiding, time, dharmadhātu five lights within exists, like peacock's egg.
[8725] Path dharmadhātu dawning time, sky-space's rainbow-light;
[8726] completion time, like chick freed from egg-shell.
[8727] From the Rtsal Dzog:
[8728] <verse> Basis-abiding rigpa,
[8729] <verse> In pristine wisdom dharmadhātu, three bodies complete;
[8730] <verse> Like peacock's egg example,
[8731] <verse> Internal light pristine wisdom clearly shown.
[8732] <verse> Path-dawning rigpa, || 650 ||
[8733] <verse> Like rainbow example shown;
[8734] <verse> Completion-directed rigpa,
[8735] <verse> Like peacock chick eggs,
[8736] <verse> Breaking, emerging, benefit-engaging.
[8737] Thus it is said.
[8738] Moreover, that pristine wisdom unmatured time, opening for all;
[8739] appearing time, light;
[8740] <verse> Familiar time, body-appearance;
[8741] <verse> From that, expression-free dharmadhātu,
[8742] <verse> Luminosity unobstructed touch arises; || 660 ||
[8743] <verse> Appearing time, light-appears,
[8744] <verse> Perfection time, self-appearance.
[8745] <verse> Familiar time, body transforms,
[8746] <verse> Wisdom-method connected,
[8747] <verse> Ultimate maṇḍala five seen.
[8748] Thus it is said.
[8749] Thus abiding body and rigpa and dharmadhātu and wisdom's characteristics:
[8750] Moreover from that very source:
[8751] <verse> Body's characteristics thus:
[8752] <verse> Unchanging and clear and, || 670 ||
[8753] <verse> Empty and concept-free.
[8754] <verse> Rigpa's characteristics thus:
[8755] <verse> Subtle and spreading and,
[8756] <verse> Garuḍa-fashion and moving.
[8757] <verse> Dharmadhātu's characteristics thus:
[8758] <verse> Vast and spontaneously thick, empty limitless,
[8759] <verse> Clear and warm and cool and,
[8760] <verse> Soft and trembling nature-holding.
[8761] <verse> Pervading and boundary and encircling.
[8762] <verse> Pristine wisdom's characteristics thus: || 680 ||
[8763] <verse> Arising and arisen and self-clear and,
[8764] <verse> Pristine and knowing and realized.
[8765] <verse> Clear and shining and vast-extent,
[8766] <verse> Appearance and darkness and opening,
[8767] <verse> Empty and clear pristine wisdom supreme.
[8768] <verse> Secret mantra's characteristics thus considered.
[8769] Thus it is said.
[8770] Second, lamps' location manner:
[8771] For gods, one cubit;
[8772] for demigods, four inches; || 690 ||
[8773] for humans, one joint;
[8774] for animals, self-clear;
[8775] for hungry ghosts, sesame-size;
[8776] for hell-beings, horse-hoof size.
[8777] For Buddhas, immeasurable;
[8778] for bodhisattvas, arrow-length.
[8779] For nirmāṇakāya, one fathom.
[8780] Self-light pristine wisdom's appearance existing:
[8781] Moreover from that very source:
[8782] <verse> Pristine wisdom abiding-nature great-small and, || 700 ||
[8783] <verse> Six appearances' directions from,
[8784] <verse> Well-explained thus:
[8785] <verse> Tuṣita gods, one cubit abides;
[8786] <verse> Contention gods, four inches abides;
[8787] <verse> Equal gods, one joint;
[8788] <verse> Two-possessing gods, self-clear;
[8789] <verse> Hunger-possessing, sesame-size;
[8790] <verse> Suffering-possessing, horse-hoof size;
[8791] <verse> Thus and thus, abiding explained.
[8792] <verse> Buddhas, immeasurable; || 710 ||
[8793] <verse> Bodhisattvas, arrow-length;
[8794] <verse> Nirmāṇakāya body, one fathom abides.
[8795] <verse> Buddha bodhisattvas and,
[8796] <verse> Nirmāṇakāya body and gods,
[8797] <verse> Directly object-appearing.
[8798] <verse> Those below, five objects,
[8799] <verse> Not shown, not seen.
[8800] Thus it is said.
[8801] Moreover, that intermediate space self-appearance Buddha-bodhisattva-god three lamps' appearance great is due to vast object;
[8802] others five, self-body's object, therefore small. || 720 ||
[8803] Third, dharmadhātu-rigpa's arising manner has two:
[8804] <list> Dharmadhātu is internal existing five lights, pristine wisdom's self-resonance external object blue vast great light;
[8805] <list> from that expanding five possessing great pristine wisdom's light, two object-appearance self-arisen.
[8806] Rigpa is vajra garuḍa-fashion appearance portion body together with—
[8807] From the Rtsal Dzog:
[8808] <tantra> All Buddhas' heart-center,
[8809] <tantra> Dharmadhātu-rigpa two not transcending.
[8810] Thus it is said, and:
[8811] From the Vajra Garuḍa itself:
[8812] <verse> Portion body inconceivable, || 730 ||
[8813] <verse> Self-arisen dharmadhātu's lamp,
[8814] <verse> Self-appearance light inconceivable.
[8815] <verse> Empty bindu's lamp,
[8816] <verse> Ray-possessing bindu inconceivable.
[8817] <verse> Five pristine wisdoms' essence,
[8818] <verse> Indicating words inconceivable.
[8819] <verse> Condition-free object's appearance,
[8820] <verse> Unceasing arising inconceivable.
[8821] Thus it is said.
[8822] Fourth, practice engagement manner has two: || 740 ||
[8823] <list> Constraining through crucial points;
[8824] <list> From that, arising experience-appearance.
[8825] First also: general resting method and,
[8826] <list> distinctive extracting method, two from:
[8827] First:
[8828] Resting in the lap, applying thumb-finger covering to red-clear pure light round appearance, engage in practice.
[8829] Short sessions, many numbers make,
[8830] thumb-finger's effort released, slowly gazing,
